  "Arbok": {
    "overview": "<p>Arbok's wide offensive movepool alongside Coil makes it a potent setup sweeper. Arbok can also surprise the opposing team thanks to its access to a plethora of coverage moves such as Seed Bomb, Earthquake, Aqua Tail, and Sucker Punch. In particular, Seed Bomb makes Arbok a very good physical sweeper, allowing it to break past Quagsire, a common deterrent to physical setup sweepers due to Unaware and Scald. Arbok also has decent physical bulk when bolstered by Intimidate, allowing it to take advantage of its Fighting-type resistance and softening physical hits in general. Arbok also has access to one of the best boosting moves in the game in Coil, boosting its Attack, Defense, and accuracy all at once. However, Arbok relies heavily on Sucker Punch to hit faster threats such as Mesprit, Archeops, and Xatu. Its average Speed means that it struggles against more offensive teams as well. Arbok is also specially frail, as it has no way of boosting its Special Defense. Lastly, it is easily checked by Quagsire, Rhydon, or Mawile if it lacks the appropriate coverage move.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A bulky Coil + Rest set with Shed Skin gives Arbok a way of setting up and avoiding status ailments while taking hits from the foe; however, Arbok is better off simply setting up and hitting as hard as possible. A combination of Choice Band and Switcheroo allows Arbok to hit really hard initially and cripple the opponent's walls by locking them into one particular move later in the game. This, however, forces Arbok to miss out on Coil and Sucker Punch, as the former is a boosting move and the latter is not a good move to be locked into. Fire Fang is a decent option to nail Ferroseed, which is immune to Arbok's STAB moves and takes neutral damage from Earthquake. Crunch gives Arbok a more reliable coverage move for Ghost-types, but most of them are frail anyway and Crunch provides less coverage than Arbok's other coverage options. Shuca Berry grants Arbok a one-time chance to tank a Ground-type move while setting up, most notably from Rhydon; however, Arbok will miss the power of Life Orb or the passive recovery of Black Sludge.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Weezing</strong>: Weezing is immune to Earthquake, resists Seed Bomb and Arbok's STAB moves, and can burn Arbok with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Rhydon, Quagsire, and Torterra can tank Arbok's STAB moves with ease and can take a hit from its coverage moves if they are healthy and Arbok hasn't set up. Rhydon can OHKO Arbok with Earthquake, while Quagsire can cripple it with a Scald burn or hit it hard with Earthquake. The former two, however, fear Seed Bomb, though Torterra is only hit neutrally by Arbok's STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Jynx, Mesprit, and Xatu can use their super effective STAB moves to OHKO Arbok. Mesprit and Xatu also tend to run Colbur Berry, so they can take Sucker Punch. Jynx in particular can bypass Arbok's Sucker Punch with Lovely Kiss, but it must be wary of Lum Berry variants when attempting to put Arbok to sleep instead of attacking it. Musharna can also tank any of Arbok's moves at +1 while OHKOing Arbok with its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Mismagius and Rotom resist Arbok's STAB moves, are immune to Earthquake, and can cripple Arbok with Will-O-Wisp and hit hard with their STAB moves on Arbok's unboosted Special Defense. However, they both fear Sucker Punch unless Arbok is burned.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Pyroar, Aurorus, and Rotom-S can all hit Arbok on its unboosted Special Defense, crippling it or OHKOing it; however, the former two must watch out for Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Regirock and Miltank can tank Arbok's STAB moves and proceed to cripple it via Thunder Wave or Body Slam respectively.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Klinklang, Mawile, Pawniard, and Ferroseed can beat Arbok lacking Earthquake, as they are immune to its STAB moves. Ferroseed can even beat Arbok with Earthquake one-on-one, as it takes neutral damage from it.</p>",

      "Offensive Coil": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Coil raises Arbok's Attack, Defense, and accuracy simultaneously. Gunk Shot benefits from Coil, as the accuracy boost negates its chance to miss. Earthquake hits Steel-types such as Klinklang, Pawniard, and Mawile that are immune to Arbok's STAB moves as well as Poison-types such as Garbodor. However, Seed Bomb allows Arbok to punch holes in bulky Ground-types such as Rhydon, Piloswine, and Quagsire while also hitting Carracosta hard. Sucker Punch bypasses Arbok's middling Speed and hits faster threats such as Archeops and Tauros hard after a boost. Aqua Tail allows Arbok to hit Rhydon slightly harder than Seed Bomb, with a +1 Adamant Life Orb Aqua Tail guaranteeing the OHKO on offensive Rhydon and having an over 50% chance of OHKOing bulky Rhydon after Stealth Rock damage. It also allows Arbok to hit Steel-types neutrally, but it misses out on hitting Quagsire and Carracosta super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs allow Arbok to hit as hard and as fast as possible. An Adamant nature gives Arbok a significant boost in power, while a Jolly nature allows Arbok to outspeed other neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Mesprit and Shiftry. Life Orb gives Arbok's attacks more initial power; however, Lum Berry gives Arbok protection against status ailments while setting up. Intimidate gives Arbok more setup opportunities against offensive teams by softening physical hits, while Shed Skin lets it set up against defensive teams by giving it a chance to get rid of status conditions.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to set up mid- or late-game, as Arbok doesn't really have the power to break through early-game and is better used when the opposing team is weakened. Arbok should set up on walls such as Mega Audino, which cannot break past Arbok thanks to its resistance to Dazzling Gleam. Arbok can also set up on Vileplume and Roselia lacking Sleep Powder thanks to its resistance to both of their STAB moves. Arbok can set up on Cradily, a plethora of opposing Poison-types such as Garbodor and Skuntank, and non-Choiced Fighting-types such as Hariyama, Hitmonchan, and Gurdurr. However, Arbok must scout for moves on said Fighting-types, as the former two might be running Earthquake, while Gurdurr can severely hinder Arbok's sweeping capabilities should it have Knock Off. Do not switch Arbok in at all early-game because it has no recovery and taking damage early-game limits Arbok's sweeping capabilities.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dark-types such as Skuntank, Shiftry, Malamar, and Liepard can get rid of Psychic-types such as Musharna and Mesprit. Skuntank and Liepard can also Pursuit trap foes, whittling down the opposing team so that Arbok can sweep; however, Skuntank stacks a Ground weakness with Arbok. Fire-types such as Magmortar and Pyroar can absorb Will-O-Wisp and deal with Ghost-types as well as Weezing. Spikes support from Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Cacturne can help wear down Steel-types such as Klinklang that are immune to Arbok's STAB moves. One layer of Spikes also guarantees an OHKO with Aqua Tail on bulky Rhydon. Healing Wish support from Mesprit or Lilligant can give Arbok a second chance at sweeping if it has been weakened throughout the match. Defensive Grass-types such as Vileplume, Torterra, and Ferroseed can help wear down the bulky Ground-types that Arbok has trouble with. Note that having support from Grass-types is much more important if Earthquake is used, as Seed Bomb and Aqua Tail already provide coverage versus  Ground-types.</p>"

  "Dodrio": {
    "overview": "<p>With its high Speed and Attack stats, Dodrio makes for a hard-hitting hole-puncher. Along with its powerful STAB attacks, Return and Brave Bird, it has access to the coveted Knock Off. However, it faces huge competition from other Normal-types, such as Kangaskhan, Swellow, and Zangoose, has low defenses, and is weak to Stealth Rock; it is also completely walled by Rock- and Steel-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dodrio has quite a varied movepool that includes support moves, boosting moves, and even reliable recovery. Agility can be used to allow Dodrio to outspeed any unboosted threat, though such a set would miss the sheer power of Choice Band. Taunt can be used to effectively stop walls, but Dodrio is too frail to utilize it properly. Pursuit can be used to catch Pokemon switching out off guard, but Knock Off is usually the superior choice. Roost can be used for a reliable source of recovery, but Dodrio would almost always rather just punch holes in its opponents. Dodrio can use some other items effectively. A Life Orb can be used to hit almost as hard as Choice Band, while allowing it to switch moves. Its recoil, however, is almost always detrimental for Dodrio. Finally, a Choice Scarf set can be used as a revenge killer, but that role is typically done better by other Choice Scarf users, such as Rotom and Jynx.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Probopass, Mawile, and Klinklang can all switch in on Dodrio, and take relatively little damage from any of its moves. Probopass can status it and wear it down with a status move or a strong Power Gem. Additionally, Klinklang can even render it setup bait, and proceed to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Kabutops, Carracosta, Regirock, and Rhydon can switch into and tank any of Dodrio's attacks. Carracosta can use Dodrio as setup bait, while the other three can either set up Stealth Rock or quickly dispose of it with a STAB Rock-type move. Kabutops and Golem cannot switch in too many times, however, as they are worn down quite easily.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Archeops, Swellow, and Choice Scarf Rotom can all outspeed Dodrio and easily revenge kill it with their hard-hitting respective STAB moves. They cannot switch in most of the time, however, as they take loads of damage from Dodrio's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burns from Pokemon such as Weezing, paralysis from Pokemon such as Lanturn, and poison from any walls all hinder Dodrio, halving its Attack, drastically cutting its Speed, and wearing it down gradually, respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is Dodrio's main STAB move, hitting extremely hard with a Choice Band, while Return is the other STAB option that is a bit more reliable, as it doesn't deal recoil damage, and provides decent coverage. Knock Off is one of the only reasons to use Dodrio, as it is a powerful attack and utility move that removes threatening opponents' items, such as Rhydon's Eviolite, as well as hitting Rotom for super effective damage. Lastly, Quick Attack can be used as a hard-hitting priority move to finish off faster, weakened Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs used maximize Dodrio's Attack and Speed, its best and most important stats. Choice Band is the best item to give Dodrio, letting it act as a wallbreaker and clean through teams with its extremely powerful STAB attacks. A Jolly nature lets Dodrio outspeed or Speed tie with relevant Pokemon, such as Rotom, Jynx, Xatu, Charizard, Ninetales, Kangaskhan, Haunter, and Electivire, therefore it is preferred over Adamant. Early Bird is the only ability worth using, and allows Dodrio to wake up quickly if it's ever put to sleep.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to remove entry hazards for Dodrio, as it does not appreciate taking Stealth Rock damage. Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon should be removed beforehand so that Dodrio can have an easier time picking off the opponent's Pokemon. Dodrio's most powerful move is Brave Bird; hence, it should be used most of the time. Return is a more reliable STAB move, and should be used whenever Brave Bird's recoil is not wanted. Always predict switch-ins, and use Knock Off to cripple Pokemon such as Rhydon and Rotom, as Dodrio does not want to be caught off guard and helpless. Use Dodrio mid- to late-game for best results, as you'll want Dodrio as a hole-puncher and revenge killer that can easily take out slower opponents.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-types such as Mawile and Pawniard make for good teammates, as they can beat threatening Rock- and Ice-type Pokemon for Dodrio. Additionally, Mawile can set up Stealth Rock, and Dodrio appreciates its ability to wear down Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon. Ground-types work especially well with Dodrio, as they are able to take out Electric-, Steel-, and Rock-types, which are Dodrio's main counters, with great ease. Additionally, Ground-types appreciate Dodrio's ability to take out Grass-types. Sandslash is one of Dodrio's best teammates, as it can also Rapid Spin away Stealth Rock, which Dodrio dislikes. Water-type Pokemon such as Samurott and Gorebyss that can set up on Steel- and Rock-types are good teammates, as they can eliminate Dodrio's biggest threats. In particular, Kabutops and Pelipper make for good teammates, as they can help prevent Dodrio from taking Stealth Rock damage with Rapid Spin and Defog, respectively. Finally, Guts users such as Gurdurr and Hariyama make for good teammates, as they can absorb status, and can threaten Steel- and Rock-types that give Dodrio trouble.</p>"

  "Electrode": {
    "overview": "<p>Electrode is the second fastest relevant Pokemon in NeverUsed with a blistering Speed stat of 140 that allows it to outspeed many threats in the metagame. This, combined with a great offensive typing in Electric and a decent base Special Attack, makes Electrode a great revenge killer and late-game cleaner. Electrode's abilities, Soundproof and Aftermath, allow it to have some offensive utility in being able to switch into sound moves like Swellow's Boomburst and to chip away at physical attackers that KO it, respectively. However, Electrode is still not very strong, even if it runs a Modest nature, making it difficult to break through specially defensive Pokemon and common Electric-type checks such as Lanturn and Steelix. Due to its limited movepool, Electrode is forced to miss out on certain Electric-type checks, relying on Hidden Power to take on most others. It also faces competition from the other Electric-types and fast Pokemon in general, including Rotom, Swellow, and Floatzel, as they usually have more utility or better coverage than Electrode.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Rain Dance lead set with Damp Rock can be used to make use of Electrode's amazing Speed stat and take advantage of Electrode's STAB Thunder, but it faces competition from other Rain setters such as Liepard, which has Prankster to set up Rain Dance with ease, and Mesprit, which can provide additional utility via Stealth Rock and a Fighting resist. Toxic is an option to cripple many of Electrode's counters on the switch, but Electrode cannot fit it onto any of its movesets. Taunt can be used over Signal Beam to prevent walls from using their recovery moves, but it doesn't provide any coverage, unlike Signal Beam, and Electrode usually doesn't have enough power to bust through walls without losing a lot of its health in the process.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Steelix and Piloswine are immune to Electrode's STAB moves and don't take much from Hidden Power Grass either. However, some of them, such as Rhydon and Gastrodon, must fear Hidden Power Grass, as they are 4x weak to it.</p> <p><strong>Lanturn</strong>: Lanturn is immune to Electrode's STAB moves thanks to Volt Absorb, and Hidden Power Grass is only a 4HKO against it, making it an effective switch-in to Electrode. Lanturn can also wear Electrode down with Scald or Volt Switch, which can really take a toll on Electrode on top of its Life Orb recoil.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Assault Vest Hariyama and Mega Audino can easily switch into Electrode, and Mega Audino can Wish off the damage or take advantage of it by setting up Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Mesprit and Haunter can outspeed Electrode and revenge kill it due to Electrode's frailty.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is Electrode's main STAB move. Volt Switch allows Electrode to gain momentum against the opposing team and to wear down bulkier Pokemon by repeatedly using the move and keeping up pressure against them. Hidden Power Grass is vital to hit Lanturn and Gastrodon, which otherwise wall Electrode completely, while also hitting Ground-types such as Rhydon and Golurk. Signal Beam provides coverage against Grass- and Psychic-types such as Shiftry and Mesprit. Hidden Power Ground is a decent option over Hidden Power Grass, hitting Steelix hard while still dealing with Lanturn. Hidden Power Water loses out on hitting Lanturn, but it hits all of Steelix, Camerupt, and Rhydon for significant damage. However, both of these moves lose out on hitting Gastrodon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment with a Modest nature is used to boost Electrode's relatively low power, while maximum Speed investment allows Electrode to outspeed all unboosted base 115 Speed Pokemon and below. A Timid nature can still be used to outspeed Swellow, Adamant Choice Scarf Kabutops and Shiftry, and Jolly Rhydon after a Rock Polish, but it loses out on much-needed power. Soundproof is chosen to block Boomburst from Choice Specs Swellow, making Electrode an effective switch-in to it. It also makes Electrode immune to Aurorus and Pyroar's Hyper Voice, but it needs proper prediction in order to switch into them. Aftermath is a secondary ability to be used with a Timid nature that can punish physical attackers for KOing Electrode, but switching into Choice Specs Swellow and other users of sound-based moves is usually more worth it. Life Orb is chosen over Choice Specs, as Electrode prefers the ability to switch between moves over the additional power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Electrode should be used as a revenge killer and late-game cleaner, as its high base Speed lets it outrun fast Pokemon such as Floatzel and hit them hard with its STAB moves or a coverage move. Electrode isn't very bulky, so try to bring it in after a teammate has fainted or on a resisted hit. Thanks to Soundproof, Electrode can switch into sound-based moves such as Boomburst, making it a great switch-in to Choice Specs Swellow and a decent switch-in to other users of these moves such as Choice Specs Aurorus. However, it can be risky to do so, as the Swellow user can use U-turn to bring out something that can prevent Electrode from gaining offensive momentum, such as Lanturn. Using Volt Switch as much as you can early-game is useful to gain momentum and chip away at specially bulky Pokemon. Try to use Electrode's coverage moves when the opponent has the appropriate target for them, such as on a predicted switch into Gastrodon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers that can break down walls that Electrode can't beat, such as Abomasnow and Magmortar, make for good teammates, as Electrode's high Speed gives it a good matchup against the offensive teams with which these wallbreakers can struggle. Abomasnow synergizes especially nicely with Electrode, as it beats Lanturn and Gastrodon, resists Ground-type attacks, and breaks down Hariyama with Wood Hammer. Pokemon that can pivot into Electrode via U-turn or Volt Switch such as Scyther can form a nice VoltTurn core with Electrode. Scyther also beats Hariyama, one of Electrode's best counters. Teammates that can capitalize on Electrode's weaknesses, such as Mismagius to deal with bulky Ground-types or Lilligant to deal with Lanturn, make for good teammates. Lilligant is a great partner for Electrode, as it deals with Electrode's worst enemies, Lanturn, Steelix, and Gastrodon, and it can use all of them as potential setup fodder. Meanwhile, Electrode revenge kills Flying-types and can wear down Magmortar by repeatedly using Volt Switch on it. Samurott is one of the best partners for Electrode, as it benefits heavily from the revenge killing of several threats it hates fighting, such as Swellow, and can also wallbreak for Electrode with its Life Orb set.</p>"

  "Exeggutor": {
    "overview": "<p>An excellent Special Attack stat, the enormous Base Power of Solar Beam, the coverage of Psyshock against specially defensive tanks such as Hariyama and Magmortar, and Sleep Powder to neutralize remaining threats all make Exeggutor a nightmare to deal with while sun is up. Meanwhile, its decent physical bulk lets it enter battle on certain attacks, such as Earthquake from Rhydon and Close Combat from Hariyama, alongside nice resistances to Aqua Jet and Mach Punch. However, vulnerability to Sucker Punch isn't great for a Chlorophyll sweeper and forces Exeggutor to rely on Sleep Powder more than it likes, and its low special bulk ensures it takes heavy damage from even strong resisted attacks such as Samurott's Hydro Pump (outside of sun) and Choice Specs Mesprit's Psychic. Exeggutor's low base Speed also means that it requires full Sunny Day support to function more effectively than Shiftry on the average team and makes it easy to deal with outside of sun when combined with its multiple weaknesses, including a crippling 4x weakness to Bug-type attacks such as U-turn and a weakness to Pursuit from Pokemon such as Skuntank and Liepard. Furthermore, even during sun, Exeggutor can be outsped by Choice Scarf users such as Jynx and Rotom. Overall, Exeggutor requires a lot of team support to be more effective than other Grass-types in this metagame but is arguably the most dangerous Chlorophyll user due to its immense power and coverage. Other sets are generally better left to faster wallbreakers such as Shiftry or less vulnerable defensive Grass-types such as Vileplume.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A standalone wallbreaker set using Leaf Storm, Giga Drain, a Psychic-type attack, and either Life Orb or Choice Specs can deal major damage to Pokemon that fail to outspeed it, such as Hariyama and Vileplume. However, it is generally outclassed by other wallbreakers such as Magmortar, is too susceptible to U-turn users such as Mesprit to have much defensive value, and is slower than other wallbreakers such as Abomasnow, Aurorus, and Magmortar. Ancient Power can be used to deal more damage to Charizard and Xatu, but these are the only real targets of the move. Trick Room can be used on offensive sets to circumvent Exeggutor's lacking Speed, but it rarely gets opportunities to set up due to its many weaknesses and mediocre bulk, compared to other Trick Room users such as Musharna and Mega Audino.</p> <p>Harvest can be used alongside a variety of Berries to give Exeggutor some extra defensive capability on balanced teams, but these strategies are generally inconsistent due to the chance of a Berry regenerating being only 50% and Knock Off's ability to permanently remove Berries. Rest with Lum Berry gives Exeggutor relative immunity to status and reliable recovery, making it a fairly good Scald switch-in, but this defensive value can be circumvented quite easily by simply OHKOing Exeggutor with a super effective move, of which there are many. Other resist Berries can be used to circumvent Exeggutor's other weaknesses, such as Yache for Ice-type attacks, but many of the moves that these Berries block still inflict significant damage regardless, so this strategy is only really useful for dealing with targets that run niche target moves, such as Ice Beam Lanturn, and hitting them with a powerful attack before they can follow up for more damage. Colbur Berry with Harvest is tempting to provide a decent Knock Off switch-in, but is mostly done better by other Pokemon with fewer weaknesses.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Attackers</strong>: Powerful priority attacks can bypass Exeggutor's Speed in sun and threaten a KO if super effective. Sucker Punch from Skuntank and Shiftry forces Exeggutor to either switch or use Sleep Powder, while Ice Shard from Piloswine and Abomasnow also threatens heavy damage. Meanwhile, Fake Out from Kangaskhan and Hariyama inflicts good chip damage while also burning a turn of sun, making Exeggutor's team easier to deal with. While not an attack, Protect from users such as Mega Audino can also stall out sunlight and reduce Exeggutor's effectiveness.</p> <p><strong>Skuntank</strong>: Skuntank is particularly problematic for Exeggutor to face, as it can take most moves aimed at it except for Explosion or the suboptimal Hidden Power Ground. Furthermore, it often runs a Lum Berry, meaning Exeggutor can only put it to sleep successfully if Exeggutor uses Sleep Powder as it switches in and then again as it stays in, which can backfire depending on prediction and accuracy. Skuntank also outspeeds Exeggutor out of sun and can use Pursuit to trap it.</p> <p><strong>Weather Setters</strong>: Snow Warning Abomasnow and Aurorus can switch into Exeggutor directly if they predict a Solar Beam, as their weather forces Solar Beam to charge for a turn and gives them a chance to outspeed Exeggutor and KO it with STAB Blizzard. These Pokemon also cancel out sun for the rest of Exeggutor's team, completely cutting off its momentum. Liepard can also switch into Psyshock or Psychic and either use Encore to neutralize Exeggutor, and either waste sunlight turns paralyzing switch-ins with Thunder Wave or simply set up its own weather in response.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: While Exeggutor is fast when Chlorophyll is activated, some Choice Scarf users are still faster, such as Rotom, Primeape, and Jynx, which can all threaten OHKOs. Additionally, most other Chlorophyll users, such as Shiftry and Lilligant on standard teams, can also outspeed Exeggutor in sun and KO it with Knock Off and sunlight-boosted Hidden Power Fire, respectively. Furthermore, when sun runs out or Exeggutor is brought in without Sunny Day being used, most offensive Pokemon, including other slow wallbreakers such as Aurorus and Magmortar, can outspeed it and force it out or KO it. Many support Pokemon, such as defensive Mesprit and Xatu, can also outspeed Exeggutor and use U-turn to either deal heavy damage or secure momentum as it switches out. Skuntank and Liepard can also trap Exeggutor with Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Sap Sipper Pokemon</strong>: Sap Sipper provides Pokemon such as Sliggoo, Miltank, and Bouffalant with immunity to Exeggutor's strongest move, and they all pack enough bulk to take Exeggutor's other attacks and either heal up with Rest or Milk Drink or simply KO back with a boosted attack. However, Sliggoo and Bouffalant take heavy damage from Life Orb Psyshock if the Exeggutor user predicts their arrival.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Charizard, Scyther, and Xatu can all take Exeggutor's STAB Grass-type attacks and force it out when sun is down, gaining opportunities to Roost off the damage or KO Exeggutor with their own STAB attacks. However, the former two take heavy damage from Psyshock without defensive investment.</p>",

      "Chlorophyll Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Solar Beam is an extremely powerful, consistent Grass-type attack during sunlight that OHKOes most offensive Pokemon and 2HKOes most that resist it, such as Lilligant. Psyshock lets Exeggutor deal more damage to specially defensive targets such as Assault Vest Hariyama and Magmortar, in addition to Sliggoo. On the other hand, Psychic provides more consistent KOs against physically defensive targets such as Weezing and Garbodor. Hidden Power Fire is boosted by sun and lets Exeggutor deal more damage to Grass-, Bug-, and Steel-types that resist Solar Beam, such as Gourgeist-XL, Scyther, and Klinklang. Sleep Powder gives Exeggutor a good chance of crippling its foes and is a good way of using the last turn of sun, providing teammates with opportunities to set it up again. Alternatively, Sunny Day lets Exeggutor start its own sweeps, if you'd rather use it as a standalone sweeper than with team support or if its supporters are out of commission. However, Exeggutor cannot use the move consistently due to its low Speed and multiple weaknesses, and the lack of Sleep Powder makes it less threatening against Skuntank in particular. Explosion can alternatively be used to inflict heavy damage on Skuntank and Grumpig as they switch in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Special Attack and Speed EVs are maximized to give Exeggutor as much offensive presence and sweeping potential as possible. A Modest nature is used for the extra power, as Exeggutor still has enough Speed to outspeed Swellow and doesn't outspeed many notable targets with a Timid nature, aside from tying with +2 Timid Omastar. Chlorophyll is mandatory to give Exeggutor the boost to Speed in sun it needs to be an effective sweeper and cleaner. A Life Orb is necessary to give Exeggutor the power it needs to sweep effectively. Heat Rock can be used alongside Sunny Day so that Exeggutor can sweep for longer by itself, but it packs a lot less power than Life Orb and makes Exeggutor less threatening against balanced teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Exeggutor should be brought into battle as soon after a teammate sets sunlight as possible to ensure that it has the maximum amount of time to utilize Chlorophyll. This should be either by switching into a resisted or weak attack, such as Steelix's Earthquake or Hariyama's Fake Out, or by using U-turn or Volt Switch on a slow pivot such as Mesprit or Lanturn to bring it in without taking any damage. Alternatively, a teammate can use a self-KO move such as Regirock's Explosion or Mismagius's Memento to give Exeggutor an opportunity to enter battle unscathed. While sun is up, Exeggutor should use its attacking moves to break through the opponent's defensive cores, before finishing with a Sleep Powder or Explosion when sun is about to run out. Make sure not to spam Solar Beam and Sleep Powder while the opponent has Sap Sipper Pokemon on their team, to avoid giving them Attack boosts and momentum. Make sure to remove Xatu and Magmortar as well before trying to use Sleep Powder against obvious targets such as Skuntank. Exeggutor should be used sparingly when sun isn't active, either switching into a defensive Pokemon to set up sunlight for itself or into a slow Pokemon so that it has time to fire off a powerful Psyshock. Do not attempt to use Solar Beam without sun being active. If Exeggutor is setting its own sun, it should generally do this late-game to have the best shot at cleaning.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Exeggutor should almost always be teamed with additional Sunny Day users, even if it uses the move itself, to ensure that it has consistent opportunities to sweep in any matchup. Liepard all but guarantees at least one sunny spell due to Prankster and can also cripple opponents with Thunder Wave if required, while Mesprit and Regirock are bulkier users of Sunny Day that can use U-turn and Explosion, respectively, to bring Exeggutor into combat safely while also being able to provide Stealth Rock support. Stealth Rock support from these two is extremely useful for wearing down checks such as Charizard and Scyther, as well as Xatu if they manage to play around its Magic Bounce. Fire-type Pokemon such as Magmortar, Pyroar, and Charizard should be used to complement Exeggutor's Speed with the raw power of their STAB Fire-type attacks in sunlight, breaking through bulkier defensive walls such as Mega Audino that can take a hit from Exeggutor otherwise. Charizard is especially good, as it gains an extra power boost in sunlight due to Solar Power, having good synergy with the rest of Exeggutor's team. Ninetales and Flareon are also notable for having Flash Fire, being able to switch into Fire-type attacks aimed at Exeggutor with impunity, even during sun. Other Chlorophyll users can also help overwhelm typical Grass-type checks; Victreebel and Sawsbuck can sweep easily once Exeggutor manages to blow holes in the opposing team while also catching faster threats such as Choice Scarf Primeape that outspeed Exeggutor in sun. Teammates that provide counterplay against other weather teams, such as rain and hail teams, can also be highly useful. Kangaskhan and Hariyama can use Fake Out and priority attacks to stall out weather turns and KO opposing weather sweepers such as Ludicolo and Kabutops, while Assault Vest Hitmonchan can threaten Omastar, Aurorus, and Abomasnow effectively while also providing Rapid Spin support for other teammates.</p>"

  "Mantine": {
    "overview": "<p>Mantine's excellent typing and ability allow it to check many of NU's most prominent threats such as Ludicolo, Samurott, Steelix, Pyroar, and Hariyama. Thanks to Water Absorb, Mantine also has a niche as one of the only Pokemon immune to Water in the tier and as an excellent Scald absorber. Mantine's solid coverage with its STAB combination can also be quite difficult for teams to switch into, especially when considering the chance of Scald inflicting a burn onto the opponent. This offensive prowess combined with its great set of resistances and immunities makes Sub Toxic Mantine a very difficult set for balanced teams to deal with, and also lets Mantine play around Volt Switch users such as Lanturn somewhat. Moreover, although a weakness to Stealth Rock hinders it, Mantine's astounding defensive typing, ability to beat most Stealth Rock users, and high Special Defense stat let it act as a fairly reliable Defogger. However, Mantine's middling Special Attack stat and reliance on Scald burns to inflict damage don't let it build momentum for its team. Low Defense combined with a lack of reliable recovery hurts Mantine's longevity and makes it difficult to repeatably check strong physical attackers throughout a battle. Although Mantine's typing covers a plethora of threats throughout NU, a 4x weakness to Electric makes Mantine a liability versus Volt Switch users such as Rotom and Manectric, which gives up more momentum in a match. Pelipper also gives Mantine some competition as a defensive Water-type, as it has the same typing, superior physical bulk, and access to roost and U-turn that allows it to keep up momentum and fit on a wider range of teams. Despite these traits, Mantine separates itself from Pelipper with much higher Special Defense, an immunity to Water, and offensive capabilities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Many Pokemon that switch in on Mantine such as Rotom, Lanturn, and opposing Mantine cannot properly deal with it once it is behind a Substitute, so a Substitute + Toxic set can work excellently. This set is often not as effective as defensive Mantine, as it loses bulk and cannot Defog as effectively. Mantine can go an even more offensive route by running a Rain Dance + Swift Swim set, as STAB Life Orb-boosted Hydro Pump in the rain can 2HKO most Pokemon that don't resist it, and Air Slash allows Mantine to beat Grass-types that typically check offensive Water-types. This set is often overlooked because it loses out on one of Mantine's greatest strengths in Defog. A Chesto Berry + Rest set can be used to help alleviate Mantine's struggle with status and give Mantine a semi-reliable form of recovery outside of Leftovers. This set is oftentimes overshadowed by Leftovers Mantine, as not being able to Toxic bulkier Pokemon such as Pelipper and Musharna makes Mantine even more of a defect to momentum, and Mantine truly needs Leftovers to keep it alive as long as possible and Defog efficiently.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-type Pokemon such as Lanturn and Rotom really threaten Mantine, as they can do massive damage with STAB 4x super effective Thunderbolts and Volt Switches. Electric-types also steal momentum from Mantine with Volt Switch, as Mantine is forced out every time. Lanturn in particular should be noted as a counter to Mantine, as it can switch in on any of Mantine's attacks with ease, Heal Bell off any Scald burn or Toxic Mantine goes for, and do massive damage with its Electric STAB moves. However, Rotom is not a safe switch in due to the threat of Choice Specs-boosted Scald or Hydro Pump</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Due to its lack of reliable recovery, weakness to Stealth Rock, and reliance on Leftovers, Mantine is very susceptible to passive damage from sources like Stealth Rock and status.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Incredibly bulky Pokemon such as Malamar and Mega Audino can be troublesome, as they both use Mantine as setup bait and don't care about getting burned or poisoned due to RestTalk and Heal Bell. Malamar is easily dispatched by Signal Beam from its Choice Specs set, however.</p> <p><strong>Freeze-Dry Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that carry Freeze-Dry such as Aurorus, Lapras, and Articuno greatly threaten Mantine, as the move is 4x super effective against it and will do massive damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SubToxic": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Mantine to dodge status moves and take advantage of bulky mons in general, as Mantine's good natural bulk means many defensive Pokemon fail to break its Substitute. Toxic cripples and wears down walls such as Gastrodon that Mantine fails to break by using its attacking moves alone. Scald serves as a decently powerful STAB move that deals a good chunk of damage to offensive Pokemon that might get a free switch on Mantine when it's using Substitute or Toxic, such as Swellow. Scald burns are also useful for wearing down the opposing team, especially if the opponent is forced to rely on offensive checks such as Rotom to beat Mantine, and they're also Mantine's only means of breaking past Ferroseed. Air Slash hits Grass-types such as Shiftry, Lilligant, and Vileplume super effectively, which are unaffected by Toxic and don't mind being hit by STAB Scald.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Water Absorb and Leftovers allow Mantine to best make use of its natural bulk so it that can continuously set up Substitutes and check threats defensively if needed. Maximum Special Attack and a Modest nature allow Mantine to hit as hard as possible, which makes it more effective against balanced teams, as its STAB moves 2HKO a plethora of offensive Pokemon that can take advantage of the defensive set, such as Rotom. 252 Speed EVs allow Mantine to Speed tie with opposing neutral-natured base 70s such as Samurott and Ludicolo, which can make it a more effective check to them. If these Pokemon are a huge threat to your team, Mantine can run a Timid nature to more reliably check them in exchange for some power. 8 HP EVs allow Mantine to maximize Leftovers recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>SubToxic Mantine works as an effective balance breaker due to its ability to take advantage of defensive Pokemon while remaining difficult for offensive threats to break. Bring Mantine in on passive defensive Pokemon that balanced teams often carry, especially bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon and weaker Grass-types such as Ferroseed. After bringing Mantine in safely, use Substitute to either scout your opponent's switch-ins or take advantage of status moves such as Gastrodon's Toxic and Ferroseed's Leech Seed. Even with no defensive investment, Mantine's Substitutes will not break when hit by moves like Steelix's Heavy Slam, Ferroseed's Gyro Ball, Poliwrath's Focus Blast, and Air Slash from defensive Mantine and Pelipper. Once Mantine is safely behind a Substitute, begin spreading status with Toxic and Scald until Mantine's Substitute has been broken and it is threatened by a faster offensive Pokemon or a bulky setup sweeper such as defensive Calm Mind Audino that Mantine cannot touch. Beware of certain moves defensive Pokemon may carry such as Toxic, Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, and Knock Off, as SubToxic Mantine is heavily crippled by these. If SubToxic Mantine is a big threat to the opponent's team, bringing Mantine in using slow VoltTurn support or on double switches may be safer, as a smart opponent will be looking to cripple Mantine as it switches in. Pay attention if the opponent has users of strong sound-based moves such as Swellow or Pyroar, as STAB Boomburst and Hyper Voice hit hard and bypass Substitute. If you play lazily, the opponent may be able to switch in for free and take Mantine out if it's at lower health. If you are playing an offensive team against which it has little room to set up, Mantine is used most effectively by defensively checking Pokemon such as Samurott and Ludicolo. If your opponent switches to a faster, offensive Electric-type such as Rotom as Mantine uses Substitute, using Substitute again may be a viable play if you want to keep Mantine in against their team, as a Volt Switch is likely coming.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steelix makes a good balanced or defensive core with Mantine because it can help take on various Electric-types and bulky Fairy-types such as Audino and Clefairy that Mantine can't break. Mantine appreciates other bulky Ground-types such as Gastrodon and Torterra that can switch into Lanturn and deal with it with their STAB attacks. Be sure to scout for Lanturn's set, as these bulky Ground-types can switch into defensive variants more reliably. Although it is Mantine's hardest counter, Lanturn is also useful as a teammate, as it helps alleviate Mantine's weakness to Electric moves. Lanturn mutually benefits from Mantine's ability to lure and cripple Gastrodon. Entry hazard control is helpful for Mantine to be able to more reliably set up Substitutes, as Stealth Rock strips away a good chunk of its health every time it switches in. Shiftry is helpful, as it can remove hazards with Defog and beat Lanturn. Claydol and Hitmonchan also provide hazard control in the form of Rapid Spin and have a useful resistance to Rock. Powerful special attackers such as Swellow, Pyroar, and Haunter all assist Mantine in breaking Lanturn and Clefairy (if Haunter or Taunt Pyroar) and other special walls, and they can clean many balanced teams after Mantine cripples their Pokemon. Swords Dance Samurott appreciates Mantine's ability to lure in and cripple many of its hard checks such as Gastrodon, Ferroseed, and Pelipper, and it can help in breaking Lanturn in return.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Defensive Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog provides useful team support by keeping entry hazards off the field. Scald is Mantine's most spammable offensive move and can also burn common switch-ins such as Ferroseed and Lanturn. Scald is generally good for warding off powerful physical attackers that prey on Mantine's low Defense stat, as getting a burn on Pokemon like Klinklang or Samurott makes them much easier to deal with. Air Slash is used for super effective coverage versus Grass- and Fighting-types and helps to make sure Mantine isn't total setup bait for Pokemon like Samurott and Lilligant. Toxic is used to status bulkier Pokemon that don't take much damage from Mantine's dual STAB moves such as Lanturn, Pelipper, and Musharna. Protect can also be used to increase Mantine's longevity, as Mantine relies solely on Leftovers to recover health. Protect also has good synergy with Scald, as Protect + Scald can effectively wear down opposing Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment increases Mantine's overall bulk, and 16 Special Defense EVs along with a Calm nature hit a jump point, which allows Mantine to take special attacks better with minimal investment. The rest of the EVs are thrown into Defense to allow Mantine to better take on strong physical attackers such as Primeape, Hariyama, and Swords Dance Samurott and Shiftry. Leftovers is the item of choice to increase Mantine's longevity throughout the battle, and Water Absorb is the best ability for Mantine, as it adds another useful immunity and can provide Mantine with recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Unless your opponent has a Water-immune Pokemon, it is usually fairly safe to spam Scald, as even Pokemon that resist it such as Lanturn don't appreciate a burn. Due to its lack of reliable recovery and weakness to Stealth Rock, avoid letting Mantine take unnecessary damage throughout a battle. Be cautious of status moves from Pokemon Mantine typically switches into such as Toxic from Steelix or Thunder Wave from Xatu. Similarly, Mantine must beware of a surprise Hidden Power Electric. Pokemon that Mantine can normally wall such as Combusken and Samurott will often run Hidden Power Electric to cripple Mantine. However, Protect is a good way to scout for potential coverage moves or status that can significantly cripple Mantine. Protect is also useful for racking up burn damage against foes and gaining extra HP from Leftovers. Knock Off users also pose a threat, as Mantine completely relies on Leftovers for recovery.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to its Defog support and excellent defensive typing and stats, Mantine finds itself in the heart of many solid cores in NU. Steelix is a terrific partner for Mantine, as the two cover each other's weaknesses well, and provide both entry hazard support with Stealth Rock and hazard removal with Defog. Hariyama pairs great with these two, as it helps check Fire-types that can break through Mantine such as Magmortar. Due to its low Defense, Mantine shouldn't be your team's sole Fighting resistance. Pairing Mantine up with another Pokemon that resists Fighting such as Vileplume or Weezing creates a strong defensive backbone for teams. Wish passers such as Mega Audino are also great partners for Mantine, as passing a Wish to Mantine aids its longevity throughout a match. Mega Audino can also use Heal Bell to remove any status inflicted upon Mantine. Similarly, status absorbers such as Malamar and Clefairy are good partners for Mantine, as they can easily switch in on any Toxic, Wil-O-Wisp, or Thunder Wave directed at Mantine. Ground-types such as Rhydon and Piloswine work well with Mantine, as they can cover Mantine's 4x weakness to Electric and stop opponents from Volt Switching around freely. Teammates that appreciate hazard control such as Jynx, Archeops, and Scyther also work well with Mantine, as Mantine can reliably keep hazards off the field for them.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Mantine's strongest STAB option, coming with a high Base Power to deal high amounts of damage to the foe. Scald is a great secondary STAB move that is perfectly accurate and has the chance to cripple physical attackers with burn. Air Slash is Mantine's best Flying-type STAB move and has a chance to make the foe flinch. Air Slash is also one of the main reasons to use Mantine over other offensive Water-types like Samurott and Floatzel. Signal Beam is used in order to hit Malamar super effectively, as it can boost up against Mantine otherwise. Hidden Power Grass is an option to hit common Pokemon that resist Water for better damage such as Lanturn. Hidden Power Electric is another option in order to hit opposing Mantine hard, preventing them from using Defog.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment along with a Modest nature is used in order for Mantine to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment is used in order to outspeed all Pokemon with base 58 Speed or lower, such as Aurorus, Omastar, and Combusken, while a Timid nature can be used to get the jump on Pokemon like Assault Vest Magmortar. Choice Specs increases Mantine's damage output and allows it to threaten the tier with its powerful moves. Water Absorb allows Mantine to switch in and heal up on Water-type moves such as Samurott's Waterfall and Floatzel's Hydro Pump.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mantine should be switched in on Water-types such as Floatzel, Samurott, and Ludicolo, as it can get back any HP it has lost with Water Absorb, though it should be cautious of some coverage moves like Hidden Power Electric from Pokemon like Samurott and Floatzel. Hydro Pump should only be used if Scald is not able to KO the foe, as its accuracy is not very reliable. Scald can also be spammed early-game in order to burn the opponent's Mantine switch-ins, such as Lanturn and Sliggoo. It should not be brought into stronger physical attacks such as Primeape's Close Combat, as it is easily 2HKOed by those moves. Mantine can still be used as a pivot into special attackers like Lilligant, Samurott, and Combusken, however, due to its high Special Defense. Because Mantine does not normally run maximum Speed, it can lure in Pokemon like Aurorus, which may switch in thinking that they can outspeed it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon like Mega Audino, Musharna, and Garbodor that can deal with physical attackers like Primeape, Tauros, and Shiftry are all viable partners. Partners that are able to remove Mantine's biggest check in Lanturn, such as Lilligant, Shiftry, and Hex Rotom, are appreciated as well. Mantine's ability to beat Steel-types such as Steelix and Klinklang is appreciated by common attackers like Vivillon and Kangaskhan. Partners that are able to cover Mantine's weakness to Electric-type attacks such as Lanturn and Steelix are useful. Mantine fits best on slower offensive teams that appreciate its special bulk and access to Water Absorb, with common partners for this playstyle being Pokemon like Piloswine. Mantine also appreciates Pokemon with entry hazard control such as Hitmonchan, Claydol, and Shiftry that help it overcome its Stealth Rock weakness. Due to Mantine's only average Special Attack even after the Choice Specs boost, entry hazard support from the likes of Garbodor, Steelix, and Omastar is worth considering.</p>"

  "Swellow": {
    "overview": "<p>Having the highest Speed stat in the tier and the ability to use both specially and physically offensive sets makes Swellow a force to be reckoned with. Due to Swellow's access to STAB Boomburst and Scrappy, its Choice Specs set is one of the best cleaners in the tier, and coverage in Heat Wave lets it get past Steel-types such as Steelix and Ferroseed. In addition, the combination of its ability Guts and high-Base Power moves in a boosted Facade and Brave Bird also makes it a viable physical attacker. However, such a set is much more easily walled by Rock- and Steel-types than the special set and quickly whittles itself down between self-inflicted status conditions, Stealth Rock, and recoil damage from Brave Bird. The main flaw of Swellow lies in its low overall bulk and bad defensive typing, which often forces it out, limits its sweeping potential, and keeps it from offering almost any defensive niches.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pursuit can be an option for Guts Swellow, as its immunity to Ghost-type attacks may often force switches, allowing it to take out Pokemon such as Rotom or Mismagius. As Swellow forces many switches, Roost offers it a means of recovery to further prolong its longevity. Endeavor can weaken bulky Rock- and Steel-types that wall Swellow if it has already lost a significant portion of its HP, especially given how Guts Swellow often finds itself at low HP between Stealth Rock damage, status damage, and Brave Bird recoil.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-type Pokemon, such as Regirock and Rhydon, take little damage from Swellow's moves and directly threaten it with their Rock-type STAB moves. Only Choice Specs Swellow has a chance to break through some Rock-types, but only those whose dual typing gives them a 4x weakness to Grass, such as Rhydon and Carracosta.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon, such as Steelix and Ferroseed, resist one or both of Swellow's STAB moves and can obtain free setup opportunities against it. However, Boomburst still does notable damage, and they can be hit on the switch by Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Due to Swellow's poor bulk, most Choice Scarf users such as Jynx, Mesprit, and Rotom can threaten to OHKO it, though they cannot freely switch into its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Swellow's poor bulk makes it take huge amounts of damage from neutral priority moves, such as Sucker Punch and Fake Out. Being weak to Ice-type moves leaves Swellow susceptible to being easily revenge killed by the likes of Piloswine. Guts Swellow has a small advantage over opposing priority users due to its high Speed stat, which allows it to outprioritize them and gives it the chance to render useless incoming Sucker Punches from Pokemon such as Cacturne and Pawniard.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Even if it is immune to other types of entry hazards, Swellow loses a quarter of its HP when switching into Stealth Rock. Multiple switches into Stealth Rock, self-inflicted status conditions, and possibly attacking a Pokemon with Rocky Helmet or Iron Barbs, such as Garbodor or Ferroseed, respectively, will harshly reduce Swellow's longevity.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Boomburst reaches an outstanding 210 Base Power due to STAB, managing to hit incredibly hard even coming from a Pokemon with a low base Special Attack stat. As Steel-types such as Steelix, Klinklang, and Ferroseed are very often inclined to switch into Swellow, Heat Wave is a great means of weakening them or even scoring a 2HKO. U-turn maintains momentum on your side of the field during the early-game, when Swellow's checks are not weakened enough. Sleep Talk makes Swellow a decent sleep absorber, coming in on Pokemon such as Vileplume and Lilligant while also being able to dish out huge damage and burn sleep turns. Tailwind can take advantage of Swellow's high Speed stat and create a sweeping opportunity for a teammate when Swellow's job is done. While it may seem like an odd choice on a Choice Specs set, Brave Bird is an option to hit Hariyama, but has little use outside of that. Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit Rock-types, such as Rhydon and Carracosta, that take little damage from Swellow's other moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs and 252 Special Attack EVs increase Swellow's damage output to considerable levels. Fully invested Speed and a Timid nature allow Swellow to outspeed a huge part of the metagame. The remaining 4 EVs are used in either Defense or Special Defense in order to leave Swellow's HP as an odd number, allowing five switches into Stealth Rock. Scrappy allows Swellow to hit Ghost-types without being forced to run an extra coverage move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swellow's lack of bulk means that in order to deal damage, it has to get a free switch into the battle, which is why getting switch opportunities with U-turn and Volt Switch is very important for its longevity. Swellow should be used throughout the game to revenge kill foes and whittle down its checks and counters such as Rhydon and Steelix, which it can usually do by simply spamming Boomburst. Swellow fails to OHKO a lot of bulkier Pokemon, such as Musharna and Ludicolo, so taking them on when they are at full health is not suggested, because Swellow can be heavily damaged even by defensive Pokemon. Keeping entry hazards up on the opposite side of the field, especially Stealth Rock, is very appreciated to help Swellow 2HKO bulky Pokemon such as Musharna and physically defensive Mantine.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Water- and Grass-type Pokemon, such as Samurott, Ludicolo, and Lilligant, are great offensive partners for Choice Specs Swellow because they can break through bulky Rock-types, while Swellow lures in and defeats their checks, such as Ferroseed. Powerful Normal-types, such as Kangaskhan, Tauros, and Zangoose, are also great offensive teammates for Swellow, as they constantly pressure the same defensive Pokemon, such as Rock- or Steel-types trying to wall them. Hitmonchan, Claydol, and Sandslash are all entry hazard removers that pair up well with Swellow, the first threatening Ice-types and all of them threatening Rock- and Steel-types, which check Swellow. Lanturn resists Ice-type attacks, is immune to Electric-type moves, and provides switch initiative with Volt Switch. Bulky Ground-types that can set up Stealth Rock, such as Piloswine and Rhydon, can easily come in on the Rock-types that threaten Swellow.</p>"

      "Guts Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Facade is the most spammable move on this set, getting boosted to 140 Base Power and having no recoil. Brave Bird lets Swellow hit Ghost-types while also allowing it to defeat bulky defensive Pokemon such, as Vileplume and Gourgeist, and Normal-resistant Pokemon, such as Crustle, Cradily, and Ferroseed. U-turn keeps momentum on your side of the field and slowly whittles down common switch-ins such as Rhydon. Quick Attack is a STAB priority move that picks off weakened faster Pokemon, especially Choice Scarf users such as Jynx, Mesprit, and Rotom-S. Protect allows Swellow to safely activate Guts.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs maximize Swellow's Speed, allowing it to outpace most of the metagame. Guts increases Swellow's Attack to considerable levels. 252 Attack EVs further augment Swellow's offensive presence. The 4 extra EVs are placed in either Defense or Special Defense, leaving Swellow's HP as an odd number and thus allowing it to take less damage from entry hazards. Toxic Orb is the most reliable way of activating Guts, inflicting a status condition that whittles it down the least over a longer period of time.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Activating Guts early in the game offers Swellow as much offensive pressure as it can achieve. Unless it can ensure an OHKO or heavily damage the foe, staying in with Swellow over an extended period of time is detrimental to its longevity, as it will gradually lose HP. Brave Bird further weakens Swellow with recoil damage, and therefore it should only be used when it will be able to pick off a Pokemon that Facade wouldn't, such as Vileplume or Gourgeist. In the early stages of the game, Swellow can be used as a momentum gainer through the use of U-turn, while also being able to heavily weaken the opposing team with Guts-boosted Facade during the mid- or late-game. Entry hazard control on your side of the field will help Swellow a lot, as Stealth Rock damage, possible recoil from Rocky Helmet users, and poison damage can lead to an early demise.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Fire-type Pokemon, such as Magmortar and Pyroar, threaten any Steel-type Pokemon that attempts to wall Swellow. Offensive Water- and Grass-type Pokemon, such as Samurott and Ludicolo, can easily dispatch of bulky Rock-types that threaten Swellow, such as Rhydon and Regirock. Offensive Normal-types, such as Kangaskhan, Tauros, and Zangoose, have the same switch-ins as Swellow and can whittle down one another's checks and counters, such as Rhydon and Ferroseed. Hitmonchan, Claydol, and Sandslash have decent offensive and defensive synergy with Swellow and are able to clear the field of entry hazards, allowing Swellow to repeatedly switch in. Bulky Ground-types such as Rhydon and Piloswine can take Rock- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Swellow while also pressuring opposing Rock- and Steel-types with their STAB Earthquake. Lanturn resists Ice- and Electric-type attacks, even regaining HP from the latter, and helps create switch-in opportunities for Swellow with a slow Volt Switch.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Pelipper has a great defensive typing, resisting Water, Fighting, Bug, Steel, and Fire while also sporting a Ground immunity. Pelipper has good physical bulk as well, allowing it to check a plethora of physical attackers such as Hariyama and Samurott. It also has reliable recovery in Roost, allowing it to tank hits throughout the match. Pelipper's special bulk, however, is slightly lackluster, meaning it is 2HKOed by powerful, resisted special attacks such as Life Orb Samurott's Hydro Pump. Pelipper's Stealth Rock weakness cuts into its bulk even further, chipping off a fourth of its HP every time it switches in while Stealth Rock is up. As a Defogger, Pelipper has a decent matchup against Stealth Rock setters such as Rhydon and Regirock thanks to its Water-type STAB moves, though it fears the Rock-type STAB moves they tend to carry; however, this is remedied by Roost temporarily getting rid of that weakness. It also beats Steelix, another common Stealth Rock setter, as it resists its Steel-type STAB moves while being immune to its Ground-type STAB moves. Pelipper only has two weaknesses to Rock and Electric, though those two types are quite common. Pelipper also lacks an offensive presence causing it to be taken advantage at times, though U-turn somewhat makes up for this.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off lets Pelipper remove items and wear down foes even more by getting rid of Eviolite and Leftovers. Tailwind is a nice option on more offense-oriented teams to allow nothing but priority to revenge kill them; however, Pelipper is better off on more balanced teams and is already pressed for moveslots. Air Slash is a more reliable Flying-type STAB move compared to Hurricane, though the power difference is very noticeable with Pelipper lacking an offensive presence. An offensive pivot set with Hydro Pump, Hurricane, U-turn or Defog, and Roost is another possible set, allowing Pelipper to hit hard while still checking Fighting-types, Klinklang, and Swords Dance Samurott, albeit not as reliably as the defensive sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Lanturn resists both of Pelipper's STAB moves and has Heal Bell to ward off any unwarranted Scald burns. Lanturn can also force Pelipper out with STAB-boosted Volt Switch or cripple it with Toxic. Rotom, Manectric, and Electivire all are able to outspeed and OHKO Pelipper with their STAB moves; however, they are all frail and cannot continually switch into Pelipper for fear of Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Mega Audino, Musharna, and Ferroseed can tank Pelipper's attacks and set up on it in Mega Audino's case or force it out using Leech Seed in Ferroseed's case. Mega Audino and Musharna can also get rid of Scald burns with Heal Bell or use Pelipper as Calm Mind setup fodder, while Ferroseed has a harder time dealing with Pelipper after being burned, as it has no passive recovery, which severely limits the number of times it can switch in.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Aurorus, Pyroar, and Mesprit all hit Pelipper on its weaker Special Defense. Jynx deserves a special mention, as it is immune to Pelipper's Water-type STAB moves thanks to Dry Skin and can hit Pelipper hard with a STAB-boosted Ice Beam. Jynx must be wary of switching into U-turn, however.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog clears all entry hazards on both sides of the field. Roost gives Pelipper a form of reliable recovery while removing its weakness to Rock and dampening its Electric weakness for one turn. Scald gives Pelipper a solid STAB move that has a 30% chance to burn the foe, deterring physical attackers. Hurricane is a good Flying-type STAB move that hits Pokemon resistant to Water, such as Gurdurr, Ludicolo, Lilligant, and Poliwrath, hard and heavily damages Samurott, which otherwise easily sets up on Pelipper. Alternatively, U-turn can be used to allow Pelipper to provide momentum while getting out of a possibly unfavorable situation.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs give Pelipper an HP number not divisible by four, allowing it to switch into Stealth Rock five times from full HP. Maximum Defense investment is used for Pelipper to tank as many hits as it can from physical attackers. A Bold nature further bolsters Pelipper's Defense stat. Leftovers gives Pelipper a form of passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pelipper can pivot in multiple times throughout the match thanks to its access to Roost and its many resistances against Pokemon such as Klinklang, Swords Dance Samurott, and Hariyama. However, special Samurott variants can 2HKO it with Hydro Pump, so Pelipper must be more careful switching into them. Pelipper can use its switch in opportunities to Defog when necessary, and while it can threaten common Stealth Rock setters, such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Regirock, it can sometimes be hard to switch into them because of its weakness to Rock. When Pelipper doesn't need to Defog or Roost, it's best to either use Scald on switch-ins to fish for a burn or use U-turn to maintain momentum. Pelipper should focus on pivoting into physical attackers, taking advantage of its decent resistances and invested physical bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pelipper should be used on balance teams that appreciate a bulky Defogger that can take on the many Fighting-types in NU, namely Primeape, Hitmonchan, and Hariyama. Ground-types, such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Torterra, all pair well with Pelipper, as they are immune to Electric and resist Rock; meanwhile, Pelipper takes on Water- and Grass-types that threaten Ground-types. Lanturn is a really good partner, as, thanks to Volt Absorb, Lanturn can tank Electric-type hits for Pelipper, while Pelipper takes the Ground-type moves aimed at Lanturn; Lanturn also tanks special attacks, while Pelipper takes care of physical attackers. Frail attackers such as Liepard and Jynx appreciate Pelipper's slow U-turn and ability to get rid of entry hazards as do hazard-weak Pokemon such as Magmortar, Scyther, Pyroar, and Aurorus, all of which are worn down fairly quickly by entry hazards. Focus Sash Jynx, in particular, appreciates entry hazard removal to keep its Focus Sash intact. Pelipper fits nicely on balanced VoltTurn teams, as it can provide one's team with a physical wall, entry hazard control, and decent resistances all in one slot. Klinklang is a good partner as well, as it appreciates Pelipper's ability to threaten its common checks, such as Poliwrath and Hitmonchan, with Hurricane; however, Hurricane-lacking Pelipper cannot check these threats as well. Grass-types such as Lilligant, Shiftry, Cradily, and Ferroseed appreciate Pelipper's ability to clear entry hazards; in return, they break down Water-types such as Lanturn, Samurott, and Prinplup, which tend to switch into Pelipper.</p>"

  "Solrock": {
    "overview": "<p>Solrock carves itself a niche in NU thanks to its unique typing, respectable bulk, and useful ability, Levitate. This combination allows it to check many dangerous Fire-, Flying-, and Normal-type wallbreakers such as Magmortar, Pyroar, Charizard, Archeops, Swellow, Kangaskhan, and non-Iron Tail Tauros. Levitate complements Solrock's role as a wall nicely, letting it avoid entry hazard damage from Spikes and Toxic Spikes, thus allowing it to consistently switch into targets without being whittled down easily. Moreover, Solrock has a great support movepool including Stealth Rock, Morning Sun, and Will-O-Wisp, which makes it a valuable asset to teams that need its specific resistances. This recovery and access to Will-O-Wisp further aid Solrock in tackling common Stealth Rock setters as well as crippling physical attackers such as Hitmonchan, Garbodor, and Thick Fat Hariyama. Unfortunately, Solrock is weak to common special attacking types including Water, Ghost, and Grass, leaving it vulnerable to common attackers such as Samurott, Floatzel, Rotom, Haunter, Mismagius, Lilligant, Ludicolo, and Vileplume. Furthermore, Solrock does not get to invest in its Defense stat due to its reliance on Special Defense investment to check Fire-types; therefore, it is very dependent on Will-O-Wisp to check strong physical attackers. Solrock also faces huge competition from other Stealth Rock setters such as Rhydon and Steelix, which offer a wider range of resistances and superior overall bulk, as well as greater offensive presence; therefore, it is only suited to teams that require its specific set of traits.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earthquake can be used to hit Rock- and Steel-types as well as Skuntank significantly harder; however, Solrock loses the ability to hit Charizard, and Stone Edge is significantly more powerful against neutral targets. Rock Tomb can be used for reliability and also to help slow down faster threats, although it comes at the cost of being significantly weaker than Stone Edge. Furthermore, Solrock can pull off a decent dual screens set with Light Clay; however, it is generally a niche set. Overall, Solrock has little room for other options, as the moves on its standard set are all necessities.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon such as Lilligant, Vileplume, Abomasnow, and Torterra can force Solrock out with their super effective STAB moves, although none of them appreciate being crippled by Will-O-Wisp. Lilligant can even set up a Quiver Dance on Solrock, making it much more difficult to deal with.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Samurott, Floatzel, Ludicolo, Poliwrath, and Omastar can deal huge amounts of damage to Solrock with their STAB moves if not OHKO it with ease. Moreover, Swords Dance Samurott commonly runs Lum Berry, meaning it can set up on Solrock without the fear of being crippled by Will-O-Wisp. Floatzel can also switch into Will-O-Wisp because of its Water Veil ability, although it takes a significant amount of damage from Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Solrock is very vulnerable to being Pursuit trapped by Pokemon such as Skuntank and Liepard. Cacturne and Shiftry are both able to deal devastating amounts of damage to Solrock with Dark Pulse and Knock Off, respectively, although they hate switching into Will-O-Wisp, and they take a large chunk of damage from Stone Edge. Finally, Malamar uses Solrock as complete setup fodder, being able to stack Superpower boosts on it and use Rest to cure itself of Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Stallbreaker Mismagius is a hard stop to Solrock, preventing it from using Stealth Rock or any other status moves through Taunt while also being able to cripple it with Will-O-Wisp and hammer it with a boosted Hex. Offensive Ghost-types such as Golurk, Trevenant, and Haunter can easily OHKO Solrock with their STAB moves, therefore preventing it from setting up Stealth Rock. However, Haunter must be wary of switching into Stone Edge, while Golurk should avoid Will-O-Wisp. Finally, Rotom can either cripple Solrock by Tricking a Choice Scarf onto it or simply 2HKO it with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu can prevent Solrock from setting up Stealth Rock or crippling its teammates with Will-O-Wisp thanks to Magic Bounce. Although Xatu cannot switch into Stone Edge or Rock Slide comfortably, it can reliably stall out the former with Roost and proceed to set up Calm Mind or pivot out with U-turn.</p>",

      "Special Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock wears down the opponent's team by punishing switches. Morning Sun provides Solrock with a form of recovery, allowing it to maintain longevity throughout a match. Will-O-Wisp lets Solrock annoy switch-ins and cripple physical attackers, particularly preventing Double Dance Rhydon from freely setting up on it. Stone Edge hits relatively hard and nabs KOs against Pokemon such as Swellow, Archeops, and Magmortar, as well as preventing Xatu from switching in safely.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment turns Solrock into a solid special wall, capable of taking repeated hits from Pokemon such as Magmortar, Pyroar, Swellow, and Charizard. With a Careful nature, Solrock avoids getting 2HKOed by Life Orb Pyroar's and Charizard's Hidden Power Grass. Leftovers is necessary to help Solrock avoid getting overwhelmed by passive damage and maintain its ability to switch into powerful Fire-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Solrock is an effective pivot that can reliably set up Stealth Rock thanks to a combination of its bulk, typing, and Levitate ability. Switch Solrock into powerful Fire-type attacks from Pokemon such as Pyroar and Magmortar to either force a switch or easily OHKO them with Stone Edge. Morning Sun should be used conservatively, as Solrock will be pivoting into attacks frequently. Solrock can pivot into Normal-type attacks such as Kangaskhan's Double Edge and Tauros's Rock Climb and either heal up with Morning Sun or cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. However, Solrock should scout Tauros's moveset first, as the rare Iron Tail will do huge amounts of damage to it. Use Will-O-Wisp to annoy potential switch-ins and improve Solrock's matchup against strong neutral attackers such as Hitmonchan, Thick Fat Hariyama, Rhydon, and Piloswine.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Water-type checks such as Poliwrath, Lanturn, and Vileplume are beneficial partners, as they tend to synergize quite well with Solrock. For example, Poliwrath can also handle most Dark-types that Solrock struggles with, Lanturn helps ease matchups with Rotom, and Vileplume can deal with Grass-types. It's important to be well prepared for Grass-types should Pokemon like Poliwrath and Lanturn be used as a partner, as Grass-types such as Shiftry and Lilligant can be very menacing to deal with. Fire-types such as Magmortar and Pyroar can take out the Grass-types that trouble Solrock. Magmortar in particular stands out, as it is able to lure in Water-types such as Mantine and Lanturn and take them out with Thunderbolt and Earthquake, respectively. In return, Solrock provides these Fire-types with a Ground-type immunity and Stealth Rock support. Solrock works well on hazard-stacking teams; therefore, Spikes users such as Garbodor, Ferroseed, and Roselia make solid partners. The former punishes Dark-types such as Skuntank and Shiftry while the latter two cover Solrock's weakness to Water-types. Skuntank is another notable partner due to its Pursuit trapping utility, letting it deal with Ghost- and Psychic-types, such as Rotom, Haunter, Mismagius, Musharna, and Xatu, while also being a good check to Shiftry. Finally, Flying-types such as Vivillon, Scyther, Charizard, and Rotom-S are helpful, as they can dispose of Grass-types as well as Guts Hariyama, which are huge threats to Solrock. Furthermore, these Flying-types love Stealth Rock support and appreciate Solrock's ability to wear down bulky Rock-, Steel-, and Ground-types such as Regirock, Steelix, and Rhydon for them.</p>"

  "Crustle": {
    "overview": "<p>Crustle has access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes, as well as Sturdy, making it an excellent suicide lead. In addition, its Bug / Rock typing gives it a good matchup against Xatu, which is a common anti-lead that can utilize Magic Bounce to prevent entry hazards from going up on the opponent's side of the field; Crustle's STAB moves prevent it from coming in safely, while its access to Rock Blast allows it to beat other leads such as Archeops. However, Crustle's low speed means that it's often Taunt bait, preventing it from setting up Stealth Rock or Spikes if hit by the move. Furthermore, Crustle is ridiculously one-dimensional, as opponents will know its set the majority of the time and will often send out a lead with good matchup against it, occasionally preventing it from doing its job.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter can allow Crustle to get a surprise KO on a physical attacker in a lead matchup or otherwise, and it works well with Sturdy. Running Shell Smash with three attacks such as Stone Edge, X-Scissor, and Earthquake is an option if Crustle can forgo setting up entry hazards in favor of being a stronger offensive threat. Toxic is an option to cripple opposing Pokemon that might try switching in to beat Crustle. Red Card is another option that forces the foe to switch out after attacking, possibly netting Crustle a more advantageous matchup where it can set up more entry hazards or Shell Smash. Mental Herb is a viable option to nullify Taunt and always ensure that Crustle sets up at least one entry hazard. Finally, a set utilizing Power Herb and Solar Beam can be used to weaken Rhydon and Quagsire without too much difficulty. However, Crustle's moveset being strapped often makes the majority of these options simply outclassed, so it's often just best to stick with Crustle's main job as an offensive entry hazard stacker.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt shuts down Crustle by forcing it to attack, preventing it from using Shell Smash and setting up entry hazards. Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Pyroar can accomplish this but fear Knock Off and Rock Blast, respectively. Archeops and Floatzel have super effective STAB attacks and can effectively Taunt Crustle as well, but Archeops is threatened by Rock Blast.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit Moves</strong>: Rock Blast and other multi-hit moves from Pokemon such as Rhydon can break Crustle's Sturdy and KO it before it sets up entry hazards or Shell Smash. Klinklang can also easily KO it with Gear Grind and can freely set up Substitute and Shift Gear should Crustle lack Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Pinsir</strong>: Choice Band Pinsir can use Stone Edge, OHKOing Crustle through Sturdy due to Mold Breaker and preventing it from setting up any entry hazards.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Hazard Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is arguably the best entry hazard in the game, and with Sturdy, Crustle is a very reliable setter of it. Spikes is another entry hazard that Crustle has access to and can often set aside Stealth Rock. Shell Smash boosts Crustle's attacking stats and Speed and enables it to pose an offensive threat, with Sturdy guaranteeing at least one chance to set up. Knock Off is an option that provides useful utility in removing the foe's item, especially against Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Sliggoo, which hate losing their Eviolite. Rock Blast is Crustle's main STAB attack and beats Xatu, which can bounce back entry hazards, as well as Focus Sash Archeops variants if the move hits more than twice. Stone Edge is an option if guaranteed power is needed and the higher chance to miss doesn't matter as much. X-Scissor is an alternative STAB move that hits Psychic- and Dark-types harder and takes advantage of Xatu when it uses Roost and subsequently loses its Flying-type, thereby beating it more reliably. It also prevents Lilligant from setting up Quiver Dance on Crustle. Earthquake is another option that hits Steel-types such as Pawniard, Klinklang, and Mawile for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Custap Berry works well with Sturdy to get an extra layer of entry hazards up or an attack off before Crustle gets KOed. Sturdy prevents Crustle from being OHKOed by any one move, guaranteeing it can set up Shell Smash or entry hazards at least once. A Naughty nature is preferred, as after a Shell Smash boost, Crustle outspeeds virtually the entire unboosted tier and it appreciates the increase to its Attack. EVs are invested in Attack and Speed to maximize Crustle's ability to set up entry hazards as quickly as possible and to pose a decent offensive threat. 0 IVs in HP, Defense, and Special Defense allow Crustle to more reliably get into Custap Berry's activation range. 31 IVs in HP, Defense, and Special Defense can be used as well to avoid the 2HKO from Xatu's Psychic and then get into Custap Berry range.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Crustle's access to Shell Smash, which allows it to beat Xatu and exert some offensive pressure, it should almost always be led with to set up entry hazards early on in the game. If the opponent has Xatu, it is better to simply attack or set up Shell Smash to prevent it from switching in and bouncing back the entry hazards. If there are probable or obvious Taunt users, it is advantageous to not lead with Crustle to prevent it from having a bad matchup on the first turn. If the entirety of the opponent's team is grounded, going for Spikes might be the best option, but Stealth Rock should be set up first the majority of the time.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Crustle should predominately be used on hyper offense teams that appreciate its ability to set up Stealth Rock and Spikes. Defiant users such as Pawniard and Primeape are good partners to help deter Crustle's entry hazards from being removed by Defog. Ghost-types such as Haunter and Rotom can spinblock to prevent the foe from removing Crustle's entry hazards. Powerful attackers such as Magmortar, Zangoose, and Tauros enjoy Stealth Rock and Spikes on the opposing side of the field to make breaking down the opposing team easier.</p>"

  "Vanilluxe": {
    "overview": "<p>In a tier where there are few specially bulky Pokemon and non-Water-type Pokemon that resist Ice, Vanilluxe has the appeal of possessing the strongest Freeze-Dry in NU. Vanilluxe has a high Special Attack and a decent Speed stat that allows it to outspeed Ludicolo and Samurott, although it misses out on the base 80 Speed tier, occupied by the likes of Kabutops, Shiftry, Mesprit, and Grumpig. Its workable Attack stat, coupled with moves such as Explosion and Ice Shard, gives it mild utility. Unfortunately, being a pure Ice-type with average Speed plagues Vanilluxe with several weaknesses and only one resistance, making it a trying task for it to enter battle safely. Vanilluxe is also mostly outclassed by the numerous available Ice-types in the tier, such as Jynx, Abomasnow, Aurorus, and Lapras. Vanilluxe's coverage is very poor in comparison, and it offers little defensive benefit even compared to its Ice-type brethren. This narrows down Vanilluxe's niche to purely being a lure for Pokemon that resist Freeze-Dry, namely Magmortar, Hariyama, and Grumpig, with Explosion.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Deviating from the current moveset listed above would leave Vanilluxe mostly outclassed by other Ice-types. While Hidden Power Ground may be considered to hit frailer Fire-types without needing to resort to Explosion, the likes of Earth Power Aurorus, Earthquake Abomasnow, and Hydro Pump Lapras should be considered instead. Hidden Power Ground also does pitiful damage to Assault Vest Magmortar, which defeats one of the main reasons to even use Vanilluxe in the first place. Other moves such as Taunt, Magic Coat, Mirror Coat, and Toxic usually aren't used very well by Vanilluxe and have no place on its moveset anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon</strong>: Most Ice-types, such as Aurorus, Piloswine, Jynx, Cryogonal, Regice, Rotom-F, and Articuno, have the bulk to repeatedly take Vanilluxe's STAB moves, and Aurorus and Piloswine can even stomach an Explosion. They can retaliate with their alternate STAB attacks, target Vanilluxe with super effective coverage, or even simply attempt to stall it out, forcing it to either switch or prematurely use Explosion. However, they don't appreciate taking Flash Cannons.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: The likes of Pyroar, Charizard, speedy Magmortar, and Ninetales can check or revenge kill Vanilluxe. Eviolite Combusken, Assault Vest Magmortar, and Ninetales even have the special bulk to take repeated Ice-type hits fairly comfortably. None of them want to take an Explosion, although Vanilluxe wants to tread carefully around Combusken's Protect.</p> <p><strong>Thick Fat Pokemon</strong>: Thick Fat Miltank is an extremely hard counter to Vanilluxe, and it can easily stomach the Explosion and Milk Drink all the damage away. Faster variants of Grumpig only really fear Explosion on the switch, as they can outpace Vanilluxe and KO it with Focus Blast before Vanilluxe can blow up.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: While few Steel-types in the tier have the bulk to comfortably tank Vanilluxe's STAB moves, they usually aren't at risk of being KOed and can return fire with their super effective Steel-type moves, which should finish Vanilluxe. Klinklang and Metang boast being able to withstand Vanilluxe's hits exceptionally well. Steel-types can easily take Explosion too, so their presence alone can make things tricky for Vanilluxe.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon</strong>: The presence of Ghost-types can put Vanilluxe in a difficult spot, as there is a very real risk of them switching in on Vanilluxe's Explosion. Faster Ghost-types are especially problematic for Vanilluxe; Mismagius and Rotom can burn Vanilluxe to weaken its Explosion or power up their own Hex while being able to survive a hit from Vanilluxe, whereas Haunter can do a lot of immediate damage or end Vanilluxe prematurely with Destiny Bond.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Vanilluxe's poor typing and average bulk mean it doesn't want to take any direct attacks. Faster attackers such as Primeape, Tauros, Kabutops, Kangaskhan, Pinsir, and Zangoose can take down Vanilluxe with little effort. While some faster Pokemon are vulnerable to Ice Shard, such as Shiftry, Vivillon, and Swellow, they can still do massive damage to if not outright KO Vanilluxe if they survive the hit. Bulkier Pokemon such as Hitmonchan, Throh, Steelix, Ferroseed, Musharna, and Mega Audino can survive Vanilluxe's blows and threaten with super effective STAB attacks or status conditions, though sometimes they may end up prompting an Explosion from Vanilluxe.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Freeze-Dry is one of Vanilluxe's best selling points, as its ability to hit Water-types, such as Lanturn, Samurott, and Mantine, super effectively makes it difficult for most cores to resist. Ice Beam gives Vanilluxe more raw power against neutral targets such as Garbodor, Steelix, and Mesprit and is able to 2HKO Aggron despite its resistance to Ice-type attacks. Explosion is crucial for Vanilluxe, as it allows it to KO or deal massive damage to nearly anything that resists both Freeze-Dry and Ice Beam, the primary targets being Thick Fat Hariyama, Assault Vest Magmortar, and Thick Fat Grumpig. However, keep in mind that Explosion sacrifices Vanilluxe, which can be problematic if its Freeze-Dry is still required, and the fact that it can only be used once means Vanilluxe can whiff if the opponent ends up switching to a Ghost-type or a bulky Rock- or Steel-type. Ice Shard allows Vanilluxe to target faster foes, finishing off weakened ones and threatening those that are weak to Ice, such as Swellow, Archeops, and +1 Lilligant or Vivillon. Flash Cannon allows Vanilluxe to strike Aurorus and Piloswine, which would otherwise shrug off all of Vanilluxe's moves. Frost Breath is an option over Ice Beam to allow Vanilluxe to circumvent bulky Calm Mind users at the cost of slightly lower accuracy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment coupled with a Life Orb allows Vanilluxe to do the most damage with its Ice-type attacks and Explosion. Despite Vanilluxe's odd Speed tier, maximum Speed investment is preferred to outrun as much as possible, most notably certain variants of Assault Vest Magmortar. Vanilluxe is also able to outspeed and revenge kill any variant of Samurott, provided it is healthy enough to survive Aqua Jet. A Naive nature can be considered to outrun fast variants of Grumpig and Assault Vest Magmortar to be able to hit them with Explosion while also getting the jump on neutral-natured Shiftry, Kabutops, and Mesprit. The remaining EVs can be placed into Attack to slightly boost the power of Vanilluxe's physical moves. Weak Armor may be considered to have Vanilluxe gain a boost in Speed upon taking a physical hit, but Vanilluxe detests any form of direct damage, and it is usually more worthwhile to have Ice Body to heal off some of Life Orb's recoil whenever hail is active.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Vanilluxe can usually just toss out Freeze-Drys and Ice Beams if the opposing team lacks sufficient Pokemon that resist it, as well as using the occasional Ice Shard to fend off faster Pokemon or pick off weakened ones. If the opponent does have a Freeze-Dry counter, Vanilluxe doesn't really have to be concerned about hitting them on the switch, as it can use its superior Speed to simply target them with Explosion the turn after. Be warned that there is little surprise factor to Explosion, as it is the sole reason Vanilluxe is used. Therefore, expect the opponent to be aware of Explosion and to attempt to bait it by pulling consecutive switches, making Vanilluxe waste its Explosion on an unintended target. Vanilluxe is meant to be played as offensively as possible with little to no concern regarding its longevity or survival, particularly by capitalizing on Explosion; attempting to play Vanilluxe more conservatively probably means your team may be better off with the likes of Abomasnow (particularly Wood Hammer variants) and Lapras.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vanilluxe can deal massive damage to some of the tier's bulkiest Fire-resistant Pokemon with either Freeze-Dry or Explosion. This makes Fire-type Pokemon, such as Pyroar, Charizard, Combusken, and Magmortar, some of the most appealing teammates, as they can start picking off the opponent's team after Vanilluxe removes or cripples their obstacles. Due to the way Vanilluxe is played, counters to some of Vanilluxe's bulkier switch-ins, such as Hariyama and Magmortar, are usually not necessary. However, it is still crucial to run switch-ins against faster threats to Vanilluxe, such as Pyroar, Charizard, and Primeape. The likes of Mantine and Sliggoo help keep Fire-types at bay, while Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL, Weezing, Vileplume, and Rotom can handle most of the faster physical attackers Vanilluxe has trouble with.</p>"

Furthermore, its immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, excellent Special Defense, respectably powerful Ice-type coverage, and access to Recover give it significant niches over competitors such as Kabutops, Claydol, and Hitmonchan. These attributes allow Cryogonal to act as an effective offensive spinner that can keep up with the pace of offensive teams without sacrificing too much momentum. Meanwhile, it still has good longevity with Recover and provides a good switch-in to a number of specially attacking Pokemon, including powerful wallbreakers such as Aurorus. However, a weakness to Stealth Rock and an abysmal Defense stat are significant drawbacks that really hinder Cryogonal's general reliability, offsetting its good special bulk and making it extremely vulnerable to priority attackers and Pursuit trappers. Cryogonal's Speed, while good, still leaves it outsped by some prominent physical attackers such as Tauros and Archeops. Cryogonal should only be used if your team can compensate for its glaring weaknesses and significantly benefits from its specific characteristics.</p>",

Haze can be used on this set to stop sweepers such as Lilligant and Vivillon from setting up effectively, and Safety Goggles can even be used to block Sleep Powder from these foes and make Cryogonal a hard counter. Knock Off can remove items from Pokemon Cryogonal has difficulty breaking through, but this role is better left to other Pokemon due to Cryogonal's low Attack stat and lack of space for the move. Hidden Power Ground hits Fire- and Steel-types, while Flash Cannon hits other Ice-types, particularly Jynx and Aurorus, for decent damage, but both require use of a Life Orb to be effective. Toxic can be used to cripple defensive responses that Cryogonal can't normally deal decent damage to, such as Mega Audino and Musharna. Explosion can similarly be used to weaken switch-ins such as Assault Vest Magmortar and Hariyama, allowing other teammates to break through them later.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Cryogonal is extremely physically frail even with investment, leaving it susceptible to faster physical attackers, such as Tauros, Swellow, and Archeops, and physical priority users, such as Hariyama, Kangaskhan, and Hitmonchan. Thick Fat Hariyama is a particularly good check, as it also effectively resists Ice-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit users, such as Skuntank and Liepard, can capitalize on Cryogonal's low Defense stat and trap it with Pursuit, doing about 50% damage to it even if it stays in. This makes Cryogonal a much less reliable spinner against teams with these threats.</p> <p><strong>Psyshock</strong>: Psychic-type Pokemon, such as Mesprit and Jynx, can also use Psyshock to exploit Cryogonal's low Defense stat and force it out. Even if they lack the move, they can still bluff it effectively in the early-game.</p> <p><strong>Fire- and Steel-types</strong>: Fire-types, such as Magmortar and Pyroar, and Steel-types, such as Klinklang and Mawile, can comfortably switch into Freeze-Dry and Ice Beam and hit back with their STAB moves. Additionally, Pyroar can outspeed Cryogonal, while Klinklang can set up without worry on Cryogonal that lack Haze.</p>",

      "Offensive Spinner": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin clears entry hazards from your side of the field, allowing hazard-weak teammates to switch into battle throughout the match. This is the main reason to use Cryogonal over other Ice-types, such as Jynx, Vanilluxe, and Aurorus, that sorely outclass it otherwise due to its relative lack of offensive coverage and power. Ice Beam is Cryogonal's strongest STAB move and hits most spinblockers for good damage, especially Gourgeist-XL, which most other spinners struggle to break through. Frost Breath is an alternative that, while only 90% accurate, deals the same damage overall and always lands a critical hit, letting Cryogonal wear down or break through setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Audino if needed. Freeze-Dry hits Water-types super effectively, allowing Cryogonal to do well against threats such as Lanturn, Ludicolo, and Mantine, though it has notable decrease in power. Recover restores health and makes Cryogonal a decent special tank for offensive teams, letting it spin multiple times in a match if necessary and preventing defensive Pokemon such as Vileplume from wearing it down.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum offensive investment with a Timid nature lets Cryogonal outspeed as many offensive threats as possible and hit them hard, reinforcing its main offensive niche over Claydol. A Modest nature can also be used, allowing Cryogonal to Speed tie with Timid Rotom while hitting slightly harder. Levitate is Cryogonal's only ability and is useful for avoiding Spikes damage, avoiding poison from Toxic Spikes, and switching into Earth Power without taking damage. Never-Melt Ice boosts all of Cryogonal's attacks without inflicting recoil, making it a better option for taking on special attackers than Life Orb. Leftovers is a good alternative if you'd prefer to have more staying power on your spinner, mitigating Cryogonal's weakness to Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cryogonal can make use of its high Speed and Rapid Spin to sacrifice itself to clear entry hazards for a sweeper if necessary, being able to spin against fast attackers such as Choice Band Primeape and allow a response such as Scyther or Vivillon to switch in without taking hazard damage, securing the endgame. Cryogonal is walled by Ice-, Fire-, and Steel-type Pokemon as well as Thick Fat Hariyama, so if these threats are still in play, it should only be brought out to use Rapid Spin. Cryogonal can use its good special bulk to switch into many defensive threats that can cause offensive teams problems, such as Vileplume, Lanturn, and Gourgeist-XL, and either hit them with STAB Ice-type attacks or spin away hazards. Switch into predicted Earthquakes at your own risk, and only if the opponent would be a fool to use any other move with their physical attacker in that context. Recover should be used against defensive Pokemon such as these that provide Cryogonal with free turns to heal or against special attackers that pose little threat, such as Aurorus locked into an Ice-type attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate the absence of Stealth Rock, such as Vivillon and Scyther, benefit from the Rapid Spin support that Cryogonal provides. Offensive Water-types, such as Swords Dance Samurott and Kabutops, appreciate Cryogonal's ability to threaten the Fire-type Pokemon that can beat Cryogonal and pressure defensive Grass-types, such as Gourgeist-XL and Vileplume. Teammates that can switch into physical attacks are absolutely mandatory due to Cryogonal's abysmal Defense. On balance teams, Rotom-S and Weezing are great partners that can switch into many threats and burn the opponent's physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp. Teammates that can deal with Pursuit trappers in advance are also highly appreciated, such as Fighting-types like Gurdurr and Primeape, which also boast good offensive synergy with Cryogonal's Ice-type attacks. Thick Fat Hariyama is another good option in this regard, as it can also take on Fire-types. While tempting, Cryogonal should not be used as a spinner on Hail teams due to stacking considerable defensive weaknesses to Fighting-, Steel-, Fire-, and Rock-type attacks, particularly with Aurorus.</p>"

  "Vivillon": {
    "overview": "<p>Because of its access to one of the most potent setup moves in the game, Quiver Dance, Vivillon is able to establish itself as one of the most threatening setup sweepers in the tier. However, this is not the only trait that makes Vivillon so strong; Vivillon also has access to a strong STAB move in Hurricane, a coverage move that complements Hurricane in Energy Ball, and a move that effectively creates setup turns in Sleep Powder. Vivillon's ability Compound Eyes also gives Hurricane 91 accuracy and Sleep Powder 97 accuracy. Unfortunately, Vivillon's poor defensive typing leaves it weak to a lot of common offensive types and gives it a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock. Vivillon's average Speed means it is typically overly dependent on Focus Sash for finding setup opportunities against offensive teams with common fast Pokemon, such as Floatzel, Archeops, and Scyther. Additionally, Vivillon is cursed with poor defenses, making it quite vulnerable to priority moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bug Buzz can be used if your team is weak to Malamar, but otherwise it provides no relevant coverage over Hurricane. Lum Berry gives Vivillon the ability to set up on Lilligant with Sleep Powder and Xatu with Thunder Wave. Additionally, it's a great option for outmaneuvering Sucker Punch users that try to revenge kill Vivillon. Life Orb can turn Vivillon into a more effective wallbreaker.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Vivillon has a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, meaning it will not only have its Focus Sash broken upon entry but also lose half of its health in the process.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Vivillon's mediocre defenses make it vulnerable to priority moves, such as Ice Shard from Piloswine, Fake Out from Kangaskhan, and Aqua Jet from Kabutops, and faster Pokemon, such as Scyther, Floatzel, and Archeops, but it's important to note that its Focus Sash must be broken ahead of time.</p> <p><strong>Magmortar</strong>: Magmortar can switch into Sleep Powder because of its ability Vital Spirit and it has a fair amount of bulk with Assault Vest. However, Magmortar needs to be at a high amount of HP to threaten Vivillon, as a +1 Hurricane has a strong chance to 2HKO Magmortar from full HP and will always 2HKO after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Klinklang</strong>: Vivillon struggles to deal damage to Klinklang if your opponent already has sleep fodder because it resists Vivillon's Hurricane and common coverage moves. Additionally, Vivillon's Focus Sash has no effect versus Klinklang because of Gear Grind.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Choice Scarf Rotom can switch into any of Vivillon's moves, except Sleep Powder, and threaten it by outspeeding and getting a KO with Thunderbolt. Electivire can switch into Sleep Powder because of Vital Spirit and resists Hurricane. Lanturn, while 2HKOed by +1 Vivillon's Energy Ball, can pressure Vivillon with Thunder Wave or Volt Switch. Rotom-S resists Hurricane and Vivillon's common coverage moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>One Quiver Dance boost is enough to allow Vivillon to outspeed and threaten every common Pokemon in NU, with the exception of Choice Scarf Rotom. Hurricane is very powerful, even without a boost, and is fairly reliable with Compound Eyes boosting its accuracy. Sleep Powder incapacitates the foe so Vivillon can safely set up. Energy Ball is Vivillon's best coverage option for dealing damage to common Flying-resistant threats, such as Lanturn and Rhydon. If Vivillon has been knocked down to its Focus Sash, Endeavor is an option to weaken a safe Vivillon switch-in, such as Assault Vest Magmortar or Klinklang, for another teammate.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature ensures Vivillon will be hitting as hard as possible while still outspeeding important threats, such as Kabutops. Focus Sash gives Vivillon more set up opportunities by allowing it to survive most attacks at full HP. Sharp Beak, while allowing for fewer setup opportunities, awards Vivillon's Hurricane with a significant boost in power. Compound Eyes boosts the accuracy of Hurricane and Sleep Powder, making them far more reliable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Vivillon should use Sleep Powder to incapacitate the opposing Pokemon for at least a turn to set up with Quiver Dance. Vivillon has the choice to be played as a lead to disrupt the opponent's team or as a late-game sweeper. Don't let Vivillon take unnecessary damage in case it needs its Focus Sash to set up or the extra health to survive a priority attack from the likes of Kabutops, Skuntank, and Swellow. Vivillon will find more setup opportunities by creating offensive pressure on slower Pokemon weak to Hurricane, such as Vileplume and Torterra. Vivillon can also force out or set up on Choice-locked Fighting-types, such as Primeape locked into Close Combat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rapid Spin and Defog support from the likes of Sandslash and Shiftry is valued for Vivillon because of its Stealth Rock weakness. If you've forgone Sharp Beak on Vivillon, Stealth Rock and Spikes support is appreciated to assist in getting KOs Vivillon would fall short of, such as on Weezing and Vanilluxe. Torterra is a notable partner because of its ability to check a lot of the priority users that give Vivillon trouble, such as Kabutops, Kangaskhan, and Hariyama, while providing a useful Electric-type immunity, which helps it switch into Choice Scarf Rotom, another notable Vivillon check. Offensive Normal-types, such as Tauros and Kangaskhan, work together with Vivillon to whittle down common switch-ins, such as Regirock and Piloswine. In addition, Normal-types greatly appreciate Vivillon breaking past Rhydon with Energy Ball so they can spam their STAB moves with more freedom.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute lets Vivillon identify how the opponent will respond to it, whether by bringing in a Flying-resistant Pokemon, switch to a Pokemon that can take Sleep Powder, or outright attack it. This lets Vivillon make the correct move the following turn, reducing its dependence on prediction and giving it a safety net against priority attacks, particularly Sucker Punch from Shiftry and Skuntank, as well as attacks from faster threats such as Tauros and Archeops. Sleep Powder has an almost-guaranteed chance to incapacitate a slower foe and gives Vivillon many opportunities to set up either a Substitute or a Quiver Dance depending on the situation. Quiver Dance lets Vivillon outspeed most unboosted foes after a single use and makes Vivillon extremely threatening against offensive teams that lack Flying-type checks. It also lets Vivillon survive special attacks such as Swellow's Boomburst and Pyroar's Hyper Voice after a boost, which could otherwise bypass Substitute and KO Vivillon. Hurricane is Vivillon's strongest STAB move, has good neutral coverage in the tier, and has a good chance to inflict confusion on switch-ins, making Vivillon hard to deal with.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Vivillon's Speed is maximized so that it can outspeed threats such as positive-natured Mesprit, Kabutops, Shiftry, and Pinsir, as well as neutral-natured Kangaskhan and Lilligant, forcing them out with either Sleep Powder or a STAB-boosted Hurricane. Maximum Speed investment also forces Shiftry to use Sucker Punch to beat Vivillon when it is unboosted, letting it set up a free Substitute. 16 HP EVs are used to give Vivillon the most efficient Leftovers recovery, letting it spam Substitute while continuously recovering HP to stall out Sucker Punch users if necessary, while still letting Vivillon switch into Stealth Rock twice. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Attack to make Vivillon's Hurricane as threatening as possible after a single boost. Compound Eyes makes Hurricane a more consistent sweeping move and makes Sleep Powder 97.5% accurate, a vast improvement over other sleep-inducing moves such as Lilligant's Sleep Powder and Jynx's Lovely Kiss.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Vivillon should enter battle against a slower target, either through a slow pivot such as Lanturn or after a teammate faints. Vivillon's set will be revealed as soon as it takes any residual damage, so the opponent will know that they don't have to account for a Focus Sash. If the target is likely to attack, Sleep Powder can be used to immediately incapacitate it if there aren't any other threats that need to be put to sleep before Vivillon can boost peacefully. Otherwise, Vivillon can set up a Substitute to block status effects and to scout the opponent if they switch to a teammate. Once the foe is asleep, Substitute should be used to protect Vivillon in case the foe wakes up the next turn and attacks. Quiver Dance should usually be used when Vivillon is behind a Substitute, unless the opponent has a threat that can bypass Substitutes such as Pyroar, Swellow, or Refrigerate Aurorus. If a sleeping foe stays in, Vivillon should use Quiver Dance until its Substitute is broken, then use Sleep Powder on the foe again, set up another Substitute, and hit it with Hurricane until it is KOed. This minimizes the consequences of a Hurricane miss and Vivillon being taken by surprise in general.</p> <p>Vivillon can beat most Flying-resistant Pokemon one-on-one with this strategy, but if the opponent packs another check, Vivillon won't be able to sweep due to Sleep Clause. If the opponent's Vivillon check is Vital Spirit Magmortar, Vivillon should use Hurricane immediately to inflict chip damage as it switches in, after which it should switch to a teammate that can take the incoming attack. The standard Assault Vest set is usually 3HKOed, so Vivillon can break through it the second time it tries to switch in. While this set is normally most effective late-game once Pokemon that resist Flying are removed, it can still be a decent lead, bluffing the Focus Sash and firing off Sleep Powder or Hurricane.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>While Vivillon doesn't need full health to function, anti-entry hazard support is still recommended, as Vivillon is easily picked off by neutral priority moves such as Samurott's Aqua Jet and Zangoose's Quick Attack if it switches into Stealth Rock and lacks a Substitute. Hitmonchan and Claydol are good choices for offensive Rapid Spin users that can threaten most Flying-resistant Pokemon, such as Steelix and Lanturn, with their STAB attacks. Shiftry and Skuntank can also use Defog to clear the way for Vivillon while also dealing with Lanturn and Steelix, respectively. Hazard support punishes foes for trying to switch around to bait Sleep Powder and lets Vivillon secure KOs with fewer boosts. Omastar provides a solid defensive backbone alongside Spikes and Stealth Rock and also deals with most Steel- and Rock-types, while Cacturne and Roselia provide Spikes and have excellent matchups against Lanturn in particular.</p> <p>Additional Flying-types can be useful for overwhelming Flying-type checks like Lanturn, Rotom, and Rhydon that lack reliable recovery. Archeops is a great choice, outspeeding most offensive threats while packing serious power against defensive ones with Stone Edge, Earth Power, and even Aqua Tail. Dealing with Rhydon is particularly important, as Rock Blast can bypass Vivillon's Substitute, making Jumpluff another decent option. A sturdy Rock-resistant Pokemon can also be useful, especially with Flying-type partners; Gastrodon can also deal with Electric-types such as Rotom and Lanturn, while Steelix can deal with attackers such as Archeops and Tauros that outspeed unboosted Vivillon. Fast offensive threats such as Tauros, Floatzel, and Swellow are useful for threatening Pokemon that Vivillon can't enter battle against safely, such as Jynx, with Swellow's U-turn being able to bring Vivillon safely into slow responses such as Rhydon so that it can hit them with Sleep Powder.</p>"

  "Weezing": {
    "overview": "<p>Weezing has a fantastic defensive typing, with an immunity to Ground-type attacks due to Levitate, only a single weakness to Psychic-type attacks, and an excellent Defense stat making it one of the best physically defensive pivots in the tier, stopping potent threats such as Steelix and Primeape in their tracks. Furthermore, Weezing's expansive support movepool, including Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Toxic Spikes, allows it to provide a lot of utility to its team and prevents it from being too passive compared to other defensive Pokemon. However, its only sources of recovery are Black Sludge and the easily exploitable Pain Split, making it easily worn down throughout the match if it lacks sufficient team support. Additionally, its low Special Defense stat and mediocre Speed stat make it easy to force Weezing out with powerful specially offensive Pokemon such as Magmortar, Aurorus, and Samurott, as well as most Psychic-type Pokemon. Weezing is particularly effective in balanced and defensive teams due to its ability to complete defensive cores, where its teammates can compensate for its shortcomings.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Memento can be used to give teammates setup opportunities and allows Weezing to complete its function as a pivot once its health has been depleted too much to switch back in later. An offensive set with either Choice Specs or Life Orb, Sludge Bomb, Fire Blast, Thunderbolt and one of Memento and Explosion can lure in and remove threats for a setup sweeper like Barbaracle or a cleaner like Swellow using unexpected raw attacking power. Thunderbolt is a good coverage option for dealing with bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Mantine and Pelipper on this set in particular. A specially defensive EV spread can let Weezing deal with Grass-type Pokemon such as Vileplume and Lilligant more effectively but is often used to better effect by Skuntank and Muk, which have better special bulk and offensive presence against specially defensive targets. Toxic can be used on stall teams that require more specific status control than Toxic Spikes and don't want to do something like accidentally normal-poison Musharna, but this is usually unnecessary on balanced teams. It also ensures status on Fire-types that like to switch in, while Sludge Bomb does not guarantee this.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Weezing's low Special Defense and lack of Speed make it easy for powerful special attackers such as Samurott and Aurorus to force it out or KO it, provided they can switch in safely. Specially offensive setup sweepers such as Vivillon and Calm Mind Mesprit can also set up on Weezing, knowing it likely won't stay in to stop them with Taunt, Clear Smog, or Haze.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Substitute Users</strong>: Weezing relies on its status moves to disrupt the opponent's team, and Pokemon that outspeed it can use these moves to shut it down completely, such as Skuntank and Mismagius. Skuntank in particular takes very little damage from Sludge Bomb and does not risk being poisoned by it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Fire-types such as Magmortar and Pyroar are especially effective against Weezing, as they can switch into its Will-O-Wisp without penalty, outspeed it, and inflict heavy damage to its team with powerful Fire Blasts. Magmortar is the most reliable choice due to its high special bulk when using an Assault Vest.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon</strong>: Psychic-types such as Mesprit and Jynx can take down Weezing with their super effective STAB attacks, even if they run Psyshock. Xatu in particular is annoying, as it can bounce back Will-O-Wisp, Toxic Spikes, and even Taunt while using Roost to mitigate Sludge Bomb damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp is one of Weezing's main attributes as a physical wall, allowing it to completely cripple physically offensive Pokemon such as Steelix and Scyther, wearing them down while also making them setup fodder for teammates such as Swords Dance Samurott. Sludge Bomb is a strong STAB Poison-type attack that has a good chance to inflict poison on troublesome Pokemon that may attempt to switch into Will-O-Wisp and other moves, such as Magmortar, Pyroar, and Xatu. Taunt prevents Weezing from being setup fodder for entry hazard setters such as Garbodor and Steelix and sweepers such as Malamar, Mega Audino, and Gurdurr. It also prevents slower defensive Pokemon from healing themselves, such as Vileplume, Quagsire, and Gourgeist-XL. Toxic Spikes allows Weezing to wear down the opponent's team throughout the match if they lack a grounded Poison-type Pokemon, but it will often only be able to set one layer at a time due to how easy it is to force out. Pain Split provides Weezing with semi-reliable recovery and lets it wear down Pokemon such as Lanturn and Hariyama when at low health, being an especially good option if your team lacks Wish support. Clear Smog and Haze can remove boosts from setup sweepers, with the former inflicting damage and bypassing Taunt, while the latter bypasses Substitute and can be used on Steel-type Pokemon. Flamethrower lets Weezing attack Steel-types such as Steelix and Mawile directly, in addition to Substitute Klinklang, but Will-O-Wisp is usually sufficient for dealing with them.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Levitate allows Weezing to bypass Ground-type attacks and both Spikes and Toxic Spikes. However, it also prevents Weezing from absorbing Toxic Spikes for its team, so it may need to be paired with a grounded Poison-type or entry hazard controller if desired. Black Sludge provides passive recovery for Weezing while also deterring Trick users such as Choice Scarf Jynx and Rotom from taking advantage of it. 108 Speed EVs allow Weezing to outspeed uninvested Malamar and use Taunt to prevent it from using Rest to heal or remove status, as well as outspeeding Pelipper and Mantine and preventing them from using Defog. The nature and remaining EVs are used to maximize Weezing's HP and Defense so that it can take physical hits throughout the match. If Malamar is not a big threat to the rest of your team, the Speed EVs can be dropped and put in Defense for even more bulk. If Weezing has reliable Wish support, Rocky Helmet can be a good item choice for punishing contact attackers such as Hariyama more effectively, breaking Sturdy, and stacking residual damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Weezing should be used as a pivot to switch into physical attackers throughout the match, either spreading status on the opponent's team with Will-O-Wisp or setting up Toxic Spikes if it gets a chance. Toxic Spikes should not be used until the opponent's grounded Poison-types have been removed. Weezing can switch into bulky setup sweepers such as Malamar, Mega Audino, and Gurdurr and stop them with Taunt, but it usually shouldn't do so against faster Pokemon, as it will likely be hit by a boosted attack before it can do anything. Sludge Bomb can be used to punish usual switch-ins such as Psychic- and Fire-types with a 30% chance to poison, but only if there is little risk in switching to a teammate afterwards. It should also be used with caution when there are specific threats that you don't want to inflict normal poison on, such as Rhydon and Scyther, which Weezing can usually only beat by burning them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wish support is fantastic to keep Weezing at good health throughout a match, and Mega Audino is good at providing this due to its great bulk and ability to deal with special attackers with either Calm Mind or raw bulk. Specially defensive Pokemon can be used to compensate for Weezing's lack of Special Defense on balanced and defensive teams. Lanturn can deal with Fire-types fairly well and appreciates Weezing's immunity to Ground-type attacks while also providing Heal Bell support for defensive teams. Altaria can similarly remove status and deter setup sweepers with Haze, and it appreciates Weezing dealing with Fairy-types like Mega Audino. Skuntank can trap problematic Psychic-types such as Xatu for Weezing with Pursuit, as well as absorbing Toxic Spikes for defensive teams and appreciating Weezing's Levitate. Dark-type Pokemon in general, such as Malamar and Shiftry, are also good responses to Psychic-types. Stealth Rock users such as Steelix and Rhydon can punish Fire-type Pokemon for switching into Weezing and help it stack residual damage on the opponent's team. Cacturne is a good Spikes user for balanced teams that also threatens Psychic-types. Weezing synergizes particularly well with these candidates due to Levitate and its Fighting-type resistance. Finally, if Weezing runs Toxic Spikes, Ghost-type Pokemon such as Rotom and Mismagius can capitalize on them, as they can use Hex against targets immediately instead of having to spend a turn burning them, and they can also prevent foes from using Rapid Spin to remove these entry hazards.</p>"

  "Leafeon": {
    "overview": "<p>Leafeon is a decent Swords Dance sweeper in the metagame due to good bulk that lets it set up on certain physical attackers such as Rhydon and Torterra, a solid Speed tier that lets it outpace key threats such as Mesprit, Lilligant, and Kangaskhan, and high Attack. In addition, its unique coverage options in Leaf Blade, Knock Off, and Natural Gift can break apart common balance cores. However, although Leafeon's Grass typing comes with very helpful resistances to Water-, Ground-, and Electric-type attacks, weaknesses to numerous common attacking types and low Special Defense leave it vulnerable to very common Pokemon such as Scyther, Garbodor, and Vileplume, which can prevent Leafeon from setting up Swords Dance while taking minimal damage from its attacks, and sometimes prevent Leafeon from switching into threats it should, such as Assault Vest Lanturn and Poliwrath with Ice Beam. Furthermore, it faces heavy competition as an offensive Swords Dance user from Sawsbuck and Shiftry due to their access to secondary STAB in Double-Edge and Knock Off respectively. Due to this competition Leafeon is a relatively niche pick and should only be used on teams which need its particular qualities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leafeon can afford to run an Adamant nature on sun teams, and while it is preferable that it keep Swords Dance or a coverage move and something else set up sun, it can drop a move for Sunny Day. Facade can be an interesting option to prevent Leafeon from being completely useless after a burn. Yawn is a neat option to force switch-ins back out, giving Leafeon easier setup opportunities. X-Scissor can be run to OHKO Shiftry and Cacturne, which otherwise resist all of Leafeon's attacks. Micle Berry (Rock) and Watmel Berry (Fire) can be run over Starf Berry to gain different Natural Gift typings if hitting Charizard and Scyther or Grass-types other than Vileplume is considered more important than hitting Poison-types. While it may seem like Leafeon has all the tools to act as a physically defensive cleric with its superb physical bulk and access to support moves such as Wish, Heal Bell, and Roar, its weakness to numerous common attacking types, its easily exploitable Special Defense, and the significant competition it faces from other clerics such as Vileplume and Mega Audino make such a set subpar and outclassed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Archeops, Swellow, and Scyther are all capable of outspeeding and OHKOing Leafeon. However, only the last is capable of switching into the Swords Dance set well, and even it hates taking a Knock Off, especially with Stealth Rock up.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Pyroar and Charizard can outspeed and OHKO Leafeon, with the former even being able to hit through its Substitute, while Magmortar can comfortably take any hit and OHKO back and Combusken can use it as setup bait. Again, however, none take a Knock Off particularly well and therefore cannot safely switch into offensive Leafeon.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: While Psychic-type Natural Gift is something to fear from the offensive Swords Dance set, Garbodor and Weezing easily wall Leafeon without a Swords Dance boost. Additionally, if the Leafeon user mispredicts and wastes Natural Gift, Poison-types can wall it comfortably.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn status from Weezing or Mismagius will render Leafeon dead weight. Paralysis will cripple Leafeon by making it much easier to revenge kill and causing the job of setting up to be significantly harder. Lanturn in particular is capable of inflicting Leafeon with paralysis or Toxic on a predicted switch, and Gastrodon can Toxic it as well.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance gives Leafeon the potential to sweep by significantly boosting its already high Attack. Leaf Blade is Leafeon's strongest, most consistent physical STAB attack. Knock Off provides near-perfect neutral coverage alongside Leaf Blade while also having the utility of removing the items of opposing Pokemon such as Magmortar and Scyther that resist Leaf Blade. Starf Berry Natural Gift gives Leafeon a one-time 100-Base Power Psychic-type attack, allowing it to deal solid damage to Poison-types such as Garbodor, Vileplume, and Weezing that would otherwise wall it completely.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>While normally something of a gimmick item, Starf Berry lends Leafeon key Psychic-type coverage, allowing it to hit threatening Poison-types. Chlorophyll gives Leafeon a leg up on opposing sun teams. Maximum investment in Attack and Speed is paired with a Jolly nature in order to take full advantage of Leafeon's offensive prowess and outspeed a number of key threats including Rotom and Kangaskhan.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Leafeon can contribute in any stage of a game thanks to its access to Knock Off, which cripples opposing Pokemon early-game, and its great Speed and physical bulk, which gives it a good number of setup opportunities and the potential to sweep late-game. When first bringing out Leafeon on something it forces out, the move of choice should nearly always be Knock Off in order to cripple the opponent's Leafeon counter for later in the game. Hold off on using Natural Gift until late-game, when Leafeon can boost to +2 and OHKO even slightly weakened Vileplume, Garbodor, and Weezing; it is especially key to be conservative with Natural Gift, because it can only be used once. Set up with Swords Dance once Leafeon's checks have been thoroughly weakened or eliminated.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Scyther, Primeape, and Kangaskhan that share Leafeon's checks appreciate this set's ability to lure in and eliminate Garbodor and Weezing. Assault Vest Magmortar is capable of checking many of the Grass-, Bug-, Flying-, and Ice-types such as Cacturne, Vivillon, Xatu, and Jynx that threaten Leafeon, as well as special attackers in general. Rhydon is catch-all check for a number of Fire- and Flying-type answers to Leafeon such as Charizard and Swellow and can also set up Stealth Rock to weaken Leafeon's checks and facilitate a sweep. Normal-type wallbreakers such as Tauros, Zangoose, and Swellow appreciate Leafeon's ability to break down bulky Rock- and Ground-types and in return can clean up the opposing team and keep up offensive pressure.</p>"

  "Gourgeist-Small": {
    "overview": "<p>Gourgeist-S stands out in NU because of its respectable Speed stat for a support Pokemon, as well as its impressive physical bulk that allows it to outpace and cripple physical attackers such as Kangaskhan, Pinsir, and Shiftry. Gourgeist-S's defensive typing is helpful, allowing it to check Fighting-, Water-, and Ground-types, such Kabutops, Primeape, Torterra, and Rhydon. Moreover, Gourgeist-S has a wide range of support moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Leech Seed at its disposal. It is also a reliable spinblocker that outspeeds every relevant spinner in the tier. Unfortunately, Gourgeist-S's typing leaves it vulnerable to Dark-, Fire-, and Flying-type attacks, all of which are commonly seen. Additionally, Gourgeist-S is hindered by its huge weakness to Knock Off, as it hates losing its item and takes a large amount of damage in the process. It is also extremely dependent on using passive moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Leech Seed to wear down its foes, thus leaving it shut down by Magic Bounce and Taunt users, such as Xatu and Mismagius, respectively. Finally, Gourgeist-S also faces competition from its counterpart Gourgeist-XL, which is significantly more physically bulky albeit much slower.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Slide is a viable option that lets Gourgeist-S OHKO Vivillon and Jynx, as well as 2HKO Magmortar, Rotom-S, Scyther, and Abomasnow after Stealth Rock is factored in. Disable can be used to prevent foes from using their last move and works especially well against Choice-locked Pokemon. Synthesis gives Gourgeist-S reliable recovery, but it generally does not have the room for it, and Gourgeist-XL utilizes it more effectively. Worry Seed prevents Malamar and Mega Audino from using Rest; however, Skill Swap can be used with Insomnia to achieve the same outcome while also removing Magic Bounce from Xatu. More offensive sets are also plausible for taking advantage of Gourgeist-S's unique offensive movepool.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu is unaffected by Leech Seed and Will-O-Wisp due to its Magic Bounce ability and takes minimal damage from Foul Play. Furthermore, Xatu can set up Calm Mind on Gourgeist-S or just 2HKO it with Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Magmortar, Pyroar, and Charizard can all switch into Will-O-Wisp unharmed and proceed to OHKO Gourgeist-S with their STAB Fire Blast. However, they must be wary of switching into the rare Rock Slide, as well as getting worn down by a combination of Stealth Rock damage and Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Vivillon, Rotom-S, and Scyther can hit Gourgeist-S with their Flying-type STAB attacks; however, the latter hates being burned by Will-O-Wisp, and they all must be careful of getting hit by Rock Slide on the switch. Guts Swellow is able to absorb Will-O-Wisp, while the special set is able to hit through Gourgeist-S's Substitutes with Scrappy Boomburst.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types such as Jynx, Aurorus, and Abomasnow can OHKO Gourgeist-S with their STAB Ice-type moves. Aurorus is also able to hit through Gourgeist's Substitute with Hyper Voice or wear it down with hail damage if it is the Snow Warning set. However, Abomasnow dislikes being crippled by status, and both Jynx and Aurorus must be careful of switching into Seed Bomb.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SubSeed": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute is used to protect Gourgeist-S against weaker attacks such as Primeape's Earthquake, Gastrodon's Scald, and Lanturn's Volt Switch. It also helps Gourgeist-S avoid being crippled by status afflictions. Substitute works particularly well with Leech Seed and Will-O-Wisp in wearing down the Pokemon Gourgeist-S walls, as well as whittling away at switch-ins. Leech Seed provides passive recovery, allowing Gourgeist-S to set up many Substitutes while chipping away at its foes. Will-O-Wisp punishes physical attackers that attempt to switch into Gourgeist-S while further wearing down foes alongside Leech Seed. Foul Play prevents setup sweepers such as Samurott, Klinklang, Pinsir, and Barbaracle from setting up on Gourgeist-S. Seed Bomb is another alternative to hit Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types such as Poliwrath, Rhydon, and Kabutops</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers provides Gourgeist-S with passive recovery, allowing it to set up more Substitutes, and works well in tandem with Leech Seed. Alternatively, Colbur Berry can be used so that Gourgeist-S can tank a Knock Off from Haryiama, Shiftry, and Zangoose, but it generally isn't worth the loss of passive recovery. Frisk enables Gourgeist-S to scout a foe's item, being particularly helpful in finding out which Pokemon are holding a Choice item. The Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Gourgeist-S to outpace Pokemon with base 95 Speed and below, such as Jynx, Primeape, and Kangaskhan, and burn them before they can attack. 152 HP EVs provide a compromise between bulk and Leech Seed recovery, allowing Gourgeist-S to create four Substitutes from full HP. The remaining EVs are invested in Defense to maximize physical bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gourgeist-S should be brought in against predicted Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks such as Samurott's Waterfall, Primeape's Close Combat, and Steelix's Earthquake, as it takes minimal damage and can attempt to burn them with Will-O-Wisp. Set up a Substitute on Pokemon that cannot do much to Gourgeist-S, namely Gastrodon, Torterra, and Lanturn. If the opponent has a Fire-type such as Pyroar or Magmortar, then it is better to throw out a Leech Seed or Foul Play rather than lose momentum by clicking Will-O-Wisp. In addition, Gourgeist-S should avoid Knock Off, as it deals a lot of damage and it hates losing the passive recovery Leftovers provides it. Lastly, avoid switching Gourgeist-S into status-inflicting moves such as Scald, Toxic, and Will-O-Wisp, as they will cripple it for the remainder of the match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can handle Dark-types and absorb Knock Off such as Mega Audino and Garbodor are solid partners, as the former can also pass Wishes and provide Heal Bell support, while the latter can set up entry hazards. Rock-types such as Regirock and Rhydon have great defensive synergy with Gourgeist-S, as they can pivot into Fire-type attacks, set up Stealth Rock, and take on Flying-types such as Archeops, Rotom-S, and Scyther. In return, Gourgeist-S can deal with Water- and Ground-types that give them trouble. Entry hazard removers are important, as Gourgeist-S is worn down very quickly by Toxic Spikes due to its lack of recovery. Therefore, Defoggers such as Mantine, Skuntank, and Prinplup are good partners, as are spinners such as Hitmonchan and Kabutops. Fire-types are decent partners, as they can take on Ice-types and, in Magmortar's case, other Fire-types. Pyroar is notable because it provides a handy Ghost immunity for Gourgeist-S while Gourgeist-S can tackle Water-types such as Samurott in return.</p>"

  "Shiftry": {
    "overview": "<p>Shiftry has a terrific offensive typing and mixed stats, which allow it to threaten many bulky Pokemon in the tier. It also has a powerful offensive movepool that contains strong STAB attacks such as Knock Off and Leaf Storm as well as numerous coverage options such as Extrasensory, Explosion, and Focus Blast. Access to STAB Sucker Punch not only lets Shiftry circumvent its rather average Speed, but it is also the second strongest priority attack in the tier behind Cacturne's Sucker Punch. These qualities make Shiftry a fearsome offensive force, especially if backed by Chlorophyll with sun support. Shiftry even makes for a good offensive Defog user because it is able to threaten and force out a large majority of the tier's entry hazard setters with its powerful STAB moves. One of Shiftry's flaws is that its average Speed makes it more reliant on Sucker Punch than it would like to be. Shiftry not only has weak defenses, but its typing is not stellar defensively either, granting it common weaknesses to Fighting, Flying, Fire, and Ice and leaving it vulnerable to basically any strong neutral STAB attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shiftry has access to Growth, which turns it into a monstrous mixed powerhouse if used under the sun; however, it can be tricky to find the moveslot for it, much less find the opportunity to safely set up while sun is active, as opponents are likely pressured to take Shiftry down. Shiftry can attempt to set up Sunny Day on its own, but it isn't advised, as Shiftry's low defenses make this a risky endeavor while also taking up one of Shiftry's valuable moveslots. Tailwind doubles the Speed of Shiftry and its teammates for three usable turns, but Shiftry already has Chlorophyll for a much more efficient boost in Speed.</p> <p>Focus Blast and Hidden Power Fire heavily dent Steel-types such as Pawniard, Mawile, and Ferroseed, but Shiftry's STAB attacks can do enough damage to them as is. Hurricane does more damage than Extrasensory to targets such as Vileplume and Hariyama and has arguably better neutral coverage alongside Shiftry's STAB moves, but the inaccuracy is a turnoff, especially in the sun. Rock Slide and Rock Tomb allows Shiftry to hammer Flying- and Fire-types on the switch, particularly Scyther, but most of them take a ton from Knock Off already. X-Scissor is purely for skewering Malamar while also netting coverage on opposing Shiftry, but it has minimal use overall. Fake Out's free damage might be appealing, but the damage is too low to be worth the moveslot.</p> <p>Shiftry has access to Nasty Plot, but such a set would forgo one of Shiftry's biggest advantages over Cacturne, being that it possesses stronger STAB attacks; resorting to Nasty Plot means that Shiftry will have a weaker Giga Drain, Dark Pulse, and Sucker Punch than Cacturne. Nasty Plot Shiftry does have access to a +2 Leaf Storm, which can majorly damage Mega Audino and Mawile, but it is still less efficient overall than Cacturne. Pickpocket has occasional use due to Shiftry's resistance to Knock Off, but Shiftry usually prefers not taking unnecessary damage or trading its Life Orb for a less beneficial or more restrictive item. A specially based Defog set with Dark Pulse, Leaf Storm, and either Extrasensory, Sucker Punch, or Focus Blast hits certain targets such as Garbodor and Steelix harder, at the expense of Knock Off and a stronger priority attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: The worst thing Mega Audino has to fear from Shiftry would be a +2 Explosion. Aside from that, it's a hard counter to anything else Shiftry tries to pull as it has the raw bulk to shrug off repeated hits and is not crippled by Knock Off, and can fire back with a super effective STAB Dazzling Gleam. Mawile can handle the Swords Dance set but risks getting worn down by Knock Off and taking substantial damage from repeated use of Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Poison-types</strong>: Skuntank resists both of Shiftry's STAB types, making it a solid response outside of eating an Explosion. Weezing, Vileplume, and Garbodor can all stand up reasonably well to mixed Shiftry, but the latter two need to watch out for a +2 fully powered Knock Off from the Swords Dance set, and all three need to be wary of Extrasensory.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types can be problematic for Shiftry, particularly Combusken, which resists both of Shiftry's STAB types and overrun it with Speed Boost and super effective STAB moves of its own. Primeape outspeeds Shiftry and resists its Sucker Punch, while other Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Hitmonchan are bulky enough to survive a hit or two and OHKO Shiftry back. Hitmonchan and Poliwrath can also retaliate with Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types are rather shaky at checking Shiftry, but Pawniard and Intimidate Mawile both resist Shiftry's STAB types, making them decent responses to the Swords Dance set; however, Pawniard gets 2HKOed by Knock Off followed by Leaf Storm and Mawile doesn't shrug off Leaf Storm either. Ferroseed is not likely to beat Shiftry upon switching in, but the threat of accumulating Iron Barbs + Life Orb damage followed by Gyro Ball can set Shiftry back to a manageable degree.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Shiftry's average Speed means that it is outsped by a good deal of Pokemon, but those Pokemon need to be able to circumvent or at least stomach a Sucker Punch to claim being able to revenge kill Shiftry safely. Such examples include U-turn Liepard, Eviolite Scyther, Will-O-Wisp Pyroar, and Lovely Kiss Jynx, although Jynx needs to be wary of the occasional Early Bird. Priority attackers such as Quick Attack Zangoose and Ice Shard Piloswine can also work around Shiftry, but they need to be able to threaten the KO lest they risk eating Shiftry's more powerful attacks. Faster Pokemon that can simply survive the Sucker Punch, such as Kangaskhan, Tauros, and Rotom-S, can be used as a last-ditch stop to Shiftry. Note that Chlorophyll Shiftry under the sun is capable of zipping past a majority of these threats. In addition, all faster Pokemon in general must be wary of Choice Scarf Shiftry.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Mixed": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off does significant damage to any target that doesn't resist Dark while removing its target's item. Leaf Storm deals tremendous damage to the tier's physically bulky Rock- and Ground-types, such as Rhydon and Carracosta. Even without investment it still deals solid neutral damage due to the high Base Power of the move, and it is stronger than physical Grass moves against the likes of Torterra and Mawile that would otherwise shrug off Knock Off with ease. If using Shiftry on a sun team, Solar Beam is a recommendable substitute over Leaf Storm for staying power. Sucker Punch allows Shiftry to combat faster Pokemon.</p> <p>Explosion punches a massive hole into any target that doesn't resist Normal at the cost of sacrificing Shiftry. This is made more effective by the fact that Rock-types and Ghost-types greatly hesitate to switch into Shiftry. It is also Shiftry's best attack against Skuntank, Assault Vest Hariyama, and Mega Audino, which stop Shiftry otherwise. Extrasensory is an option to allow Shiftry to hit Combusken as well as break bulky Poison-types, notably 2HKOing Weezing; it can also be used as a follow-up move after Knock Off in order to KO Vileplume and Garbodor or simply 2HKO them on the switch outright, although Shiftry needs Stealth Rock support in order to achieve this. Defog allows Shiftry to clear the field of entry hazards, providing valuable team support for various entry hazard-weak Pokemon such as Pyroar and Scyther.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment greatly enhances Shiftry's offensive potential, notably powering up Shiftry's Knock Off and Sucker Punch. Shiftry does not need Special Attack investment in order for Leaf Storm to sufficiently damage its targets. A Lonely or Naughty nature is used to maximize the damage output of Shiftry's Dark-type moves; a Lonely nature leaves Shiftry more vulnerable to priority attacks but allows it to take better advantage of its resistances to various special moves such as Scald, Giga Drain, Volt Switch, and Shadow Ball, whereas a Naughty nature does the opposite. Naughty is definitely the preferred nature on a sun team, as Shiftry would commonly be subject to priority attacks amidst its sweep.</p> <p>If you desire more Speed on Shiftry or simply want to reduce its reliance on Sucker Punch, Hasty or Naive natures are fine alternatives, allowing Shiftry to outspeed Zangoose, Magmortar, Mesprit, Kabutops, Kangaskhan, and opposing Shiftry should they not run a Speed-boosting nature themselves, as well as Speed tie positive-natured Mesprit and Kabutops. Life Orb augments Shiftry's damage output even further. Chlorophyll is useful for Shiftry whether it be fighting alongside a sun team or against one. However, if sun teams are not an issue, Early Bird is worth consideration to give Shiftry better odds of combating Jynx.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Being powerful but frail, Shiftry should always start in a position where it is threatening KOs on slower foes. Fortunately, this is not difficult to achieve due to the potency of Shiftry's STAB types against many of the slower Pokemon in the tier; Shiftry can also threaten faster Pokemon with its Sucker Punch. Shiftry excels greatly in hole punching, employing a hit-and-run tactic while doing massive damage to the opposing team. Throwing out Knock Offs early-game is a safe tactic as it cripples Shiftry's switch-ins, limiting their ability to check Shiftry continuously.</p> <p>If using Defog on Shiftry, it is best to send Shiftry in on a slower foe that it can easily threaten to KO, which is usually a Rock-, Water-, Ground-, or Psychic-type; it would be even better if Shiftry can threaten the entry hazard setter itself, as it means the foe will not be able to reset the entry hazards in a hurry. Explosion is best used if one feels that Shiftry's usefulness has expired and it has just one more attack left in it, or if it could be used as an unexpected lure to brutally surprise and cripple the foe.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire- and Flying-types make for some of Shiftry's best teammates, as they provide powerful offensive synergy to break the opponent's team, can cover each other's weaknesses, and appreciate anti-entry hazard support should Shiftry choose to run Defog. Pyroar and Magmortar can break the bulky Grass- and Poison-types that Shiftry can struggle with while resisting Bug- and Ice-type attacks for Shiftry; Shiftry, meanwhile, resists Water- and Ground-type moves for them and threatens bulky Pokemon that resist Fire with Leaf Storm and Knock Off. The likes of Scyther, Archeops, and Swellow can cover for Shiftry against faster offensive teams and threaten Fighting- and Grass-types; Shiftry can take Electric-type attacks aimed at the Flying-types while taking advantage of possible U-turn support to enter the battle safely, and it can return the favor by demolishing Rock-types and softening up Steel-types. However, note that if Shiftry is not using Defog and Scyther is still used as a partner, an alternative Defog or Rapid Spin user, such as Prinplup, Claydol, or Sandslash, is highly recommended, as Scyther absolutely needs Stealth Rock off the field.</p> <p>Fighting-types make for strong offensive partners for Shiftry as well, as they can soften each other's checks and put dents in the opponent's team. They also resist Bug- and Rock-type moves for Shiftry while Shiftry can handle their Psychic weakness. Thick Fat Hariyama can safeguard Shiftry against Fire- and Ice-type moves. Shiftry also has a place on sun teams, predominantly as the physical hole puncher of the team. Between moves such as Knock Off and Explosion, Shiftry's sun sweeper teammates, such as Victreebel, Exeggutor, and Pyroar, should have little trouble cleaning up the battered remains of the opponent's team. Sunny Day users such as Regirock, Mesprit, and Liepard are also obviously vital partners for this Shiftry.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance bolsters Shiftry's Attack stat, allowing it to hit incredibly hard. Knock Off is Shiftry's most powerful and reliable attack, hitting foes for great damage while also removing their item. Seed Bomb hits many Pokemon that resist Dark hard while also bypassing Unaware Quagsire. Sucker Punch gives Shiftry powerful priority, threatening to OHKO a large majority of faster foes after a Swords Dance boost. If Shiftry is used on a sun team, Shiftry may consider Explosion over Sucker Punch. Explosion, especially if boosted by Swords Dance, can obliterate foes and provide a free switch for a sun sweeper or sun setter. If Explosion is used, Shiftry can now run Leaf Blade which is otherwise incompatible with Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment is used to maximize Shiftry's offensive potential. An Adamant nature further boosts Shiftry's power, while a Jolly nature allows Shiftry to outrun neutral-natured base 80 Speed to base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Zangoose, Kangaskhan, Magmortar, Mesprit, and Kabutops, while Speed tying positive-natured Mesprit, Kabutops, and opposing Shiftry. Life Orb further increases Shiftry's damage output, but Black Glasses is a fine alternative, as Shiftry will usually be relying on the damage output of its Dark-type moves, especially after a boost, than its Grass-type attack. Lum Berry is also an option on Shiftry to reliably set up on Scald users while staving off status ailments in general, such as those from Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, and Thunder Wave. Chlorophyll is the ability of choice if one is considering using or combating sun teams, whereas Early Bird can sway the matchup against Jynx in Shiftry's favor.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Shiftry variant is more inclined to go for the sweep as opposed to pivoting in and out, but it can also soften its checks early-game with Knock Off so that they succumb to Swords Dance-boosted attacks later on. However, against physically bulky Pokemon that resist Grass, such as Garbodor, Vileplume, Weezing, and defensive Rotom-S, it might be wise to not prematurely use an unboosted Knock Off on them in order to avoid weakening future uses of Knock Off. Instead, Shiftry should try to nail them with a +2 fully powered Knock Off and drop them in a single blow; however, all four of them require some prior damage, preferably from Stealth Rock, in order to achieve this.</p> <p>Shiftry can find setup opportunities by threatening the numerous slower Pokemon weak to its dual STAB attacks. This Shiftry set also functions well under sun. If Explosion is used, it is best used on the final turn of sun, as Shiftry is not expected to continue its sweep without Sucker Punch or Chlorophyll to augment it. Be warned that using Leaf Blade will alert opponents that Shiftry lacks Sucker Punch, so it isn't advised to reveal Leaf Blade if sun isn't up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-types such as Pyroar and Magmortar make for great offensive partners, plowing through most of the Pokemon that give Swords Dance Shiftry trouble, such as Mawile, Vileplume, Weezing, and Pawniard; Shiftry, meanwhile, can set up on the Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types that the Fire-types lure in. Ground-types are also good teammates, as they can take down Garbodor, Skuntank, and defensive Mawile with ease while offering strong offensive presence in return; Rhydon, Golurk, and Piloswine can all set up Stealth Rock for Shiftry and help weaken the opponent's physical walls, and Rhydon and Golurk can even threaten the opposing team with their own form of setup. Fighting-types are solid Pokemon to use alongside Swords Dance Shiftry, as their combined offensive potency can put immense pressure on teams. They also resist Bug- and Rock-type moves for Shiftry while Shiftry can handle their Psychic weakness. Thick Fat Hariyama can shield Shiftry against problematic Fire- and Ice-type attacks. Psychic-types can defend Shiftry against Fighting-types while also handling problematic Poison-types for Shiftry; the likes of Mesprit and Mr. Mime can also provide Healing Wish support to give Shiftry a second shot at sweeping. Sun-setting teammates, such as Regirock, Mesprit, and Liepard, as well as sun sweepers, such as Victreebel, Pyroar, and Jumpluff, are also fine partners for Shiftry if one intends to have Shiftry sweep with the help of Chlorophyll.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off allows Shiftry to surprise Pokemon that otherwise check it such as Mismagius and Jynx, which would normally throw out a status move to dodge Sucker Punch. It also allows Shiftry to deal a chunk to Ghost- and Psychic-types like Rotom and Mesprit and remove items of bulkier Pokemon like Steelix and Hariyama. Leaf Blade can allow Shiftry to pressure Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types such as Samurott, Gastrodon, and Rhydon. Rock Slide is used primarily for Charizard, Vivillon, and non-Choice Scarf Scyther, three Pokemon that this set can lure, as it can allow Shiftry to OHKO the former two and Scyther with a Choice Band. Swords Dance Scyther can be OHKOed after taking one Knock Off. Explosion is good for weakening switch-ins like Garbodor and works well on Spikes-stacking teams to pseudo-block any form of entry hazard removal. If Shiftry's other moves can't do the trick, Explosion can be used as a last-ditch move for revenge killing.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf with maximum Speed investment lets Shiftry outspeed some Pokemon that would otherwise outspeed and KO it like Jynx, Charizard, and Scyther and get a surprise revenge kill if Choice Scarf has not yet been revealed. Maximum Attack EVs and an Adamant nature make Shiftry hit as hard as possible. Pickpocket can sometimes allow Shiftry to punish the opponent for removing its item if Shiftry comes on a weaker move like Knock Off or Aqua Jet. Pickpocket will only ever come into play if you decide to let Shiftry take a Knock Off, making it situational. Chlorophyll can be used to outspeed Leafeon and Sawsbuck in the sun, but this is even more situational than Pickpocket, since sun teams are very rare.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>For as long as possible, try to mask Choice Scarf until the opportunity comes to surprise a faster Pokemon like Rotom, which might try to cripple Shiftry with Will-O-Wisp. Also limit yourself from using Rock Slide until a Pokemon weak to it comes in. If you use it too early, the opponent might be more cautious around Shiftry and start to play more carefully. Use Knock Off often early in the match to start crippling the opponent's team by removing their items. Explosion should only be used when you don't have any other options left, like for KOing a faster threat that can't be OHKOed by one of Shiftry's other moves or on a bulky Pokemon like Garbodor and Mega Audino that Shiftry's teammates fail to beat without prior chip damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types can be aided by Shiftry's capabilities, such as luring Pokemon like Charizard, Scyther, Jynx, and Swellow; naturally checking Ghost- and Psychic-types with Knock Off; and sometimes using Explosion on bulky Poison-types. In return, Fighting-types can check Kangaskhan, which weakens Shiftry with Fake Out, and occasionally drop coverage like Stone Edge in exchange for a move that's more practical in different situations. Gurdurr sets up on the majority of physically defensive Pokemon that Shiftry can't beat. Hariyama acts as a switch-in for Ice Shard and Fire-types such as Magmortar, Pyroar, and Combusken not locked into Rock Slide. Primeape can also help to lure in Pokemon that Shiftry wants to beat with U-turn, including Ghost-types or Pokemon such as Scyther, Charizard, and Weezing. Slower wallbreakers like Zangoose appreciate faster Pokemon being lured in and beat by Shiftry to stop the threat of a revenge kill. Of course, other types of wallbreakers like Life Orb Samurott and Magmortar could work well, as they can threaten bulky Grass-types for Shiftry and in exchange Shiftry can get rid of Lanturn, which walls the two mentioned Pokemon. Entry hazard setters appreciate Shiftry, since it can pressure Xatu and pseudo-spinblock with Explosion. This works well with Spikes setters, especially considering Spikes take a lot more effort to put up but get removed much more easily. Garbodor is a prime example, since it can also absorb Mach Punch for Shiftry, and Shiftry can remove Ground-types like Rhydon and Gastrodon in return. Mesprit and Grumpig are nice partners for Shiftry, as they can absorb Mach Punches and retaliate with a strong Psychic STAB move. Grumpig also acts as a switch-in to Fire- and Ice-types like Articuno and Magmortar. Calm Mind users also benefit from Shiftry weakening their checks, like Liepard or Skuntank, with Explosion.</p>"

  "Prinplup": {
    "overview": "<p>Prinplup is unique in the sense that it's the only viable Pokemon in NU with access to both Defog and Stealth Rock, being able to act as a capable support Pokemon. It is also one of the few Defoggers not weak to Stealth Rock, which, combined with its excellent bulk backed by Eviolite, makes it reliable at clearing the field of entry hazards. Its Water typing also gives it a good matchup against common Stealth Rock users such as Steelix and Rhydon. Prinplup has its fair share of shortcomings, though, most notably its passive nature, which leaves it vulnerable to offensive Pokemon such as Ludicolo and Abomasnow. Due to a lack of any sort of recovery, Prinplup is very prone to being worn down by repeated attacks, status, and entry hazards, causing it to have trouble staying on the field for long. This flaw becomes even more apparent against offensive teams, as Prinplup tends to have a hard time keeping hazards off the field while setting up Stealth Rock itself in the same match.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Defog or Stealth Rock and three attacks is also an option, as Prinplup may only need one of the moves if its teammates already carry either move, letting it run additional coverage moves such as Signal Beam, Ice Beam, and Grass Knot. Just note that doing so leaves Prinplup somewhat outclassed by other Pokemon because its main niche lies in being able to use both moves together. Ice Beam provides good coverage alongside Scald, letting Prinplup hit Grass-types such as Lilligant, Shiftry, and Vileplume on the switch, though Prinplup typically has trouble fitting it in its moveset and it generally has worse coverage than Signal Beam. Feather Dance lets Prinplup cut the Attack of physical attackers, letting it more comfortably take attacks and preventing it from being set up on by Swords Dance Samurott. A specially defensive spread is also viable to better take on some special attackers such as Pyroar and Life Orb Samurott. An offensive Agility set has some merit on specific teams but is generally outclassed by other offensive Water-types such as Samurott and Floatzel.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Vileplume and Roselia can freely switch into Prinplup thanks to their resistance to Scald and immunity to Toxic and retaliate with Giga Drain. Both, however, do not appreciate being worn down by Scald burns. Ludicolo, Abomasnow, Shiftry, and Lilligant serve as great offensive checks, switching safely into all of Prinplup's moves with the exception of Toxic. Cacturne gets a special mention thanks to its ability Water Absorb giving it an immunity to Scald.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Lanturn can switch into Scald, remove any burn or poison inflicted with Heal Bell, and hit Prinplup with Volt Switch, stealing momentum from it. Other Electric-types, such as Rotom and Electivire, can KO Prinplup with ease with their respective STAB moves, although the latter does not appreciate being burned by Scald.</p> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu has the ability to bounce back Stealth Rock and Toxic and does not mind switching into Scald very much. In return, Xatu can wear down Prinplup with Psychic or steal momentum from it with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Putting Prinplup in situations where it's pressured to keep entry hazards off the field is an easy way to take advantage of it, as this can be used as an opportunity to freely bring in Pokemon that can KO it, preventing it from performing its intended role.</p>",

      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog is great for keeping entry hazards off the field, and Prinplup is a reliable user of the move thanks to its great natural bulk and pure Water typing, which let it switch into common Stealth Rock users such as Steelix and Rhydon. While it may seem like Stealth Rock conflicts with Defog, it works well on this set because Prinplup has enough raw bulk to perform both roles if necessary. Scald is a reliable STAB move that has a nice chance to burn the target, deterring physical attackers from switching directly in and ensuring that Grass-types cannot switch in for free either. Toxic lets Prinplup cripple typical switch-ins to it, such as Ludicolo and Lilligant, as well as some Calm Mind users, such as Musharna, Mesprit, and Mega Audino. Signal Beam is also an option to 3HKO Malamar and hit Pokemon such as Shiftry, Abomasnow, Jynx, and Ludicolo on the switch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and a Bold nature maximize Prinplup's physical bulk, letting it tank several hits throughout the game, and is preferred over investment into special bulk primarily because most Stealth Rock users are physical attackers. Eviolite further augments Prinplup's bulk, increasing both of its defenses substantially. Torrent is chosen to give a boost to Scald should Prinplup be at a third of its HP or less.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Prinplup to pivot into Pokemon that cannot do much in return, such as Steelix, Kabutops, and Piloswine. Do not switch in Prinplup haphazardly, however, as it has no means of recovery, meaning repeated attacks will only make it go down faster. Once it's brought in, use Stealth Rock or Defog depending on the situation. If entry hazards are on Prinplup's side of the field, use Defog to clear them. Once the opportunity presents itself, use Stealth Rock in order to get chip damage on the opposing team. When matched up against Xatu, be hesitant when using Stealth Rock, as Xatu can bounce it back and steal momentum with U-turn. Counteract this by using Scald, fishing for the potential burn, or by double switching to a teammate that can threaten Xatu. Scald should be used when there are no hazards that need to be cleared and in situations where getting off damage and possibly a burn on a potential switch-in is more beneficial than setting up Stealth Rock. Use Toxic to catch Grass-types such as Ludicolo and Lilligant on the switch. Toxic should also be used against Pokemon that could otherwise use Priplup as setup bait, such as Calm Mind Musharna and Mesprit. Just note that against Musharna, doing so means Prinplup will be poisoned as well due to Synchronize, so only use it if necessary.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates that appreciate entry hazards being off the field, such as Vivillon and Jynx, pair well with Prinplup, as they want to keep their Focus Sash intact in order to survive a hit from full health. Other hazard-weak Pokemon, such as Magmortar and Abomasnow, also work well, with both of them being able to threaten Grass-types that take advantage of Prinplup. Defensive Grass-types such as Vileplume and Roselia all make for good partners, with the former acting as a much more reliable check to Swords Dance Samurott and not being too troubled by Knock Off, while Roselia can better take on Lilligant and Ludicolo. Mega Audino is a decent switch-in to Knock Off users, most notably Shiftry, and can keep Prinplup alive with Wish and Heal Bell support. Xatu may seem redundant when paired with Prinplup, but both form a solid anti-hazard core, keeping hazards off the field much more reliably and enabling them to better support Pokemon 4x weak to Stealth Rock such as Scyther and Vivillon.</p>"

  "Charizard": {
    "overview": "<p>Charizard is one of the tier's premier Fire-types, boasting great offensive stats and powerful attacks that threaten a good majority of the tier. While it is not as fast as Pyroar, Charizard sits in a comfortable Speed tier, able to outrun Pokemon such as Jynx, Primeape, Rotom, and Lilligant, and is equipped with good coverage options, such as Earthquake and Focus Blast. Charizard also has the choice to run a physical set, using Swords Dance alongside its physical Flying STAB move Acrobatics. Despite already possessing great strength and offensive versatility, Charizard is not a pushover when it comes to taking hits either, as its resistances, access to Roost, and not-too-shabby bulk allow it to withstand punishment decently well. However, Charizard still has its flaws; Water and Electric are common attacking types that can serve as annoyances to it. The Stealth Rock weakness is especially huge, as it greatly compromises Charizard's longevity and durability. Charizard's Rock weakness can also be exploited by certain Pokemon that it otherwise checks, such as Stone Edge Hariyama and Primeape and Hidden Power Rock Lilligant. Reliable entry hazard removal is mandatory to ensure Charizard's success at massacring the opponent's team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Charizard has a couple of appealing offensive options at its disposal. A Dragon Dance set with Flare Blitz, Earthquake, and Thunder Punch has effective neutral coverage and decent sweeping potential, although Dragon Dance is incompatible with Acrobatics. Charizard can wield Choice Specs, which performs best with Solar Power to throw out obscenely strong attacks, although sun teams aren't known for good entry hazard control, which can limit Solar Power Charizard's presence. The limited entry hazard control on sun teams makes Solar Power Charizard a shaky idea in general, even with items such as Leftovers and Flame Plate to help preserve its longevity and staying power. Both Choice Specs and Choice Scarf sets also tend to be outperformed by Pyroar, as Pyroar is not as pressured by Stealth Rock while constantly switching, and Charizard's movepool advantage over Pyroar is diminished when it cannot switch moves. Charizard has access to other Speed-boosting options, including Flame Charge and Tailwind, to outrun its foes. Belly Drum is a far riskier alternative to Swords Dance, and the risk greatly outweighs the reward, as Charizard greatly depends on its bulk and health to set up and maintain a sweep, not to mention Swords Dance is effective enough as it is. Charizard can attempt a set without an item using Fire Blast and Acrobatics to exploit players that rely on Team Preview to deduce Charizard's set by determining the presence of its item. While this itemless all-out-attacking variant of Charizard can lure most of its traditional defensive checks to unfavorable positions, the relative lack of raw or potential power compared to its other sets adversely affects its consistency.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Easily the bane of Charizard's existence, Stealth Rock renders Charizard much more vulnerable to being picked off. Being forced to start at only 50% of health will prompt Charizard to use Roost, delaying its attack, as well as make it very inconvenient for Life Orb Charizard to choose between attacking and healing.</p> <p><strong>Faster Super Effective Attackers</strong>: The likes of Archeops, Manectric, Floatzel, and Rock Slide Tauros can revenge kill Charizard. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Kabutops, Barbaracle, Rotom, and Primeape can bring Charizard down with super effective STAB moves, or Rock coverage in Primeape's case. Charizard falls victim to Swift Swim sweepers as well, such as Ludicolo, Omastar, and Kabutops.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types resist both of Charizard's STAB moves and do an especially good job at fending off the Swords Dance variant while being able to retaliate for an easy KO with their Rock-type STAB moves. However, the special variant of Charizard can prove to be troublesome to handle, as it can hit them hard with Hidden Power Grass or Focus Blast, and only a few Rock-types aren't immediately crippled by Will-O-Wisp from Swords Dance Charizard.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types do well, as they resist Charizard's Fire-type STAB moves and usually have the bulk to take a hit from most of its other attacks. Lanturn does especially well due to its resistance to both of Charizard's STAB moves and even has Heal Bell to shrug off burns, though it does not appreciate taking Earthquake. Mantine fares decently against special Charizard and Omastar and Gastrodon can handle Swords Dance Charizard, but they fear boosted Acrobatics and Hidden Power Grass, respectively. If one's Water-type cannot reliably check Charizard defensively, Aqua Jet from the likes of Samurott or Kabutops can still fend off Charizard.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: While it's not easy, there are a number of Pokemon in the tier that can shrug off most of Charizard's neutral attacks, although they're usually only able to handle one variant of Charizard at a time or only win in one-on-one scenarios as opposed to being able to switch into Charizard. Sliggoo, Calm Mind Mega Audino, and Calm Mind Musharna can boost on special Charizard, but they may risk getting overpowered by Swords Dance Charizard. Assault Vest Magmortar with Thunderbolt can check most variants of special Charizard but loses to Earthquake and Swords Dance variants. Many Electric- and Steel-type Pokemon can take advantage of Swords Dance Charizard's relatively lesser immediate offensive presence but detest taking Fire Blasts. If worst comes to worst, simply having a Pokemon with a Rock-type move and enough bulk and health to take a hit from Charizard may be enough to put Charizard out of commission.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is Charizard's main attack, doing a lot of damage to any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. For example, it possesses enough power to OHKO the likes of Rotom and bulky Scyther and 2HKO Musharna. Air Slash is Charizard's alternate STAB attack. It doesn't hit a lot of Pokemon that Fire Blast does not, aside from Thick Fat Hariyama, certain Water-types, and opposing Fire-types such as Pyroar, Combusken, and opposing Charizard, but it still has decent neutral coverage and is a more accurate move to finish off a weakened target with. Hidden Power Grass primarily targets Pokemon that can withstand both of Charizard's STAB attacks, such as Rhydon, Gastrodon, Omastar, Barbaracle, and Kabutops. Focus Blast maintains coverage on the aforementioned Rock-type Pokemon as well as sturdier Pokemon that resist Fire, such as Regirock and Thick Fat Miltank, though it comes at the cost of accuracy. Roost is useful to offset Life Orb recoil and keep Charizard healthy, especially if Charizard is used to check Pokemon such as Grass-types and Fighting-types, as well as slightly helping Charizard to deal with its Stealth Rock weakness. Earthquake is primarily used to 2HKO less bulky variants of Lanturn and Assault Vest Magmortar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed maximizes Charizard's offensive prowess, while a Timid nature is used to make the most out of Charizard's good Speed tier to outspeed the likes of Jynx, Primeape, Lilligant, and Rotom. The remaining investment should not be placed in HP, lest Charizard be KOed by two switches into Stealth Rock. Blaze is the ability of choice, as powering up Charizard's Fire Blast for massive damage is useful for a last-ditch attack. Solar Power also clashes with Life Orb, causing Charizard to take excessive damage. Note that even with a Timid nature, Earthquake can still 2HKO its main targets while preserving Charizard's bulk to take resisted hits, so there is no need to deviate from the suggested EV spread and nature. However, a Naive nature can be considered if Charizard prefers to dent more physically defensive variants of Lanturn with its Earthquake.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Charizard would prefer nothing more than to raze foes to the ground with its powerful Fire Blast; its other attacks should usually only be used against threats that resist Fire or perhaps against a weakened foe. Charizard does an especially good job at punishing bulkier builds that rely on Hariyama as their Fire-type switch-in of choice, as Air Slash can tear through it with ease. Charizard can use its resistance to Grass- and Fighting-type moves as well as its immunity to Will-O-Wisp and Ground-type moves to enter battle and launch powerful attacks. Examples of Pokemon Charizard can switch into include Hariyama, Hitmonchan, Lilligant, Mismagius, Gourgeist-XL, and Steelix. With Roost, Charizard can check additional threats, such as Shiftry, Combusken, and Weezing, and handle the ones it already checks even more effectively, though Earthquake can delegate Charizard into an even more focused wallbreaking role, being able to break down Lanturn and Magmortar. In the mid- or late-game, should the opponent no longer have any faster Pokemon or priority users, Charizard can attempt to clean up the opposition with Blaze-boosted attacks and can even make use of Stealth Rock to activate Blaze if the situation permits it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removers are paramount to Charizard's success, as they get rid of Stealth Rock, which plagues Charizard. Shiftry and Kabutops are very strong offensive partners that can remove Stealth Rock with Defog and Rapid Spin, respectively. The two can also beat down or weaken most Water-types, Rock-types, and specially bulky Pokemon for Charizard, with Shiftry resisting Electric attacks as well, whereas Charizard can severely damage bulky Grass-types, Poison-types, and other physically defensive Pokemon while taking Will-O-Wisp plus Fighting-, Bug-, Grass-, and Ground-type attacks. Defog Skuntank can work as well, especially since it can easily dispatch of Grumpig, one of Charizard's few hard counters, and help lure Rock- and Ground-types, such as Rhydon and Gastrodon, to weaken them with Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p>Hitmonchan and Claydol are great Rapid Spin partners from a defensive standpoint, as they resist Rock for Charizard, as well as Electric in Claydol's case, and can spin away Stealth Rock; both also beat down most Rock-types. Xatu's Magic Bounce can prevent Stealth Rock from being set on Charizard's side at all and can either support Charizard with Thunder Wave or U-turn or weaken its checks with its coverage moves. Outside of hazard control, Grass-types such as Lilligant and Shiftry appreciate Charizard breaking down their checks for them while offering Water and Electric resistances; Gastrodon offers perfect defensive synergy alongside Charizard and can wear down bulkier foes that Charizard cannot break through by using Toxic and Recover; and Lanturn can switch into Water- and Electric-type moves with ease while offering a slow Volt Switch to allow Charizard to safely enter battle, especially against opposing Grass-types that intend to take advantage of Lanturn.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance doubles Charizard's Attack, greatly improving its damage output. Acrobatics is the STAB move of choice, packing a solid 110 Base Power provided Charizard does not wield an item. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical Rock-types, which serve as hard counters to Charizard otherwise. It also weakens physical attackers in general, particularly Sucker Punch users, making it much easier for Charizard to set up. Roost keeps Charizard healthy, giving Charizard multiple opportunities to check foes or set up as well as offset Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs maximize Charizard's bulk without putting it at risk of being 2HKOed by Stealth Rock. 252 Speed EVs alongside a Jolly nature take advantage of Charizard's good Speed tier to outrun the likes of Primeape, Jynx, Lilligant, Haunter, and Vivillon. The remaining investment goes into Attack to add a bit more punch to Charizard's Acrobatics. Going itemless not only gives Charizard's Acrobatics consistent power but also allows Charizard to easily pivot into Knock Off from the likes of Hariyama and Shiftry. While neither ability benefits this variant of Charizard, Solar Power has the risk of depleting Charizard's health, so Blaze is chosen. Alternatively, a more offensive Swords Dance variant focusing on Attack and Speed investment can be considered. Said offensive Swords Dance Charizard may consider Earthquake or Flare Blitz over Will-O-Wisp for greater offensive potential.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Charizard's main goal is to set up Swords Dances on a foe that cannot hurt it much, use Roost to remain healthy if necessary, and sweep with Acrobatics. Early-game, it's usually best to use Will-O-Wisp to cripple its checks, such as Rock- and Steel-types. Charizard can also check frailer foes, most notably Fighting- and Grass-types, as Acrobatics still has good initial power. However, Charizard must be wary about being nailed by Rock-type coverage moves on the switch from the Fighting-types. Once Charizard's checks and counters are sufficiently dealt with, Charizard can aim to set up Swords Dances on weaker foes; using Will-O-Wisp against physical attackers makes the task of setting up much easier for it as well.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removers are crucial for Charizard, as Stealth Rock greatly hinders Charizard's ability to set up. Shiftry can Defog away Stealth Rock while synergizing very nicely with Charizard; it can crush Rock- and Water-types and resists Electric attacks for Charizard, while Charizard can set up on most Grass-, Poison-, and Fairy-types, resists Fighting- and Bug-type attacks, and can switch into Will-O-Wisp for Shiftry. Hitmonchan and Claydol are great Rapid Spin partners from a defensive standpoint. They resist Rock-type moves, as well as Electric in Claydol's case, can spin away Stealth Rock, and can take on Rock- and Steel-types for Charizard. Xatu's Magic Bounce can prevent Stealth Rock from being set on Charizard's side at all and can either support Charizard with Thunder Wave or U-turn or weaken its checks with its coverage moves. Charizard's burn support can be useful for specially bulky Pokemon such as Hariyama, Lanturn, and Gastrodon, as well as Calm Mind users such as Mega Audino, Musharna, and Xatu. Fast cleaners such as Tauros, Swellow, and Choice Scarf users, such as Primeape and Kabutops, can also capitalize on Charizard's ability to wear down their checks with burns and repeated Acrobatics.</p>"

  "Raichu": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its access to Nasty Plot and an exceptional Speed tier, Raichu proves itself to be a unique Electric-type that is as underprepared for as it is dangerous. With its excellent ability in Lightning Rod, Raichu makes for a unique stop to opposing Electric-types; combine this with the fact that Raichu offensively checks most U-turn users, such as Scyther and Liepard, and it proves to be a unique offensive check to VoltTurn teams. Additionally, Raichu's access to Nasty Plot allows it to boost its Special Attack to formidable levels, letting it potentially break past common checks to Electric-types, such as Rhydon and Lanturn. However, Raichu does suffer from its flaws, chief among them being its atrocious frailty. As such, Raichu finds few opportunities to set up Nasty Plot, and its damage output will be hindered accordingly. Furthermore, Raichu faces steep competition from other Electric-types, such as Rotom and Rotom-S, which boast secondary STAB attacks, have defensive typings that actually let them check certain Pokemon, and have more raw power. It should also be noted that, while its Speed is commendable, Raichu falls prey to many priority attackers and revenge killers, such as Kangaskhan and Swellow, respectively. Raichu also has difficulty breaking past specially defensive walls, such as Roselia and Lanturn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Encore is an option to lock a foe into a move such as Stealth Rock or Protect in order to gain more opportunities to set up, but Raichu prefers a coverage move. Raichu can choose to use an all-out attacking set utilizing either Life Orb or Choice Specs to take advantage of its excellent coverage; however, this set is underwhelming in power because it provides much less of a boost to Raichu's Special Attack than Nasty Plot. Grass Knot is an alternative to Hidden Power Grass, hitting foes like Golurk and Rhydon for incredible amounts of damage, but both are hit hard as it is by Hidden Power Ice and Focus Blast, respectively, and Grass Knot hits for less damage than Hidden Power Grass does against most everything else, most notably Lanturn. Raichu has a unique physical movepool, so Choice Band with Volt Tackle, Return, Knock Off, and Iron Tail can be used as a strong physical wallbreaker; however, this set is generally not worth it and is done better by other physical attackers such as Tauros. Finally, Raichu can utilize an array of support moves, such as Knock Off and Nuzzle, but it is far too frail to effectively fulfill a purely supportive role.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Lanturn</strong>: Being both one of the most common and solid Raichu checks, Lanturn can handle any attack that Raichu can go for, as it can only 4HKO Lanturn with Focus Blast or Hidden Power Grass, and this assumes that the former connects on all four uses. However, Lanturn cannot entirely counter Raichu, as it can 2HKO Lanturn with these moves at +2 after Stealth Rock. Nonetheless, this is not a likely scenario, so Lanturn is often the best defensive check that most teams have for Raichu.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types, such as Roselia, Vileplume, and Gourgeist-XL, make for effective checks to Raichu, resisting both Raichu's STAB Thunderbolt and Focus Blast. Note that Vileplume and Gourgeist must be very healthy in order to survive a +2 Hidden Power Ice, while Roselia needs significantly more prior damage to be KOed by a boosted Hidden Power Ice. Roselia can use Raichu as fodder to set up Spikes or 2HKO it with Sludge Bomb after either one round of Life Orb recoil or Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to its frailty and susceptibility to being worn down from Life Orb recoil, Raichu is very vulnerable to revenge killing from both priority users and faster attackers; however, they cannot switch into Raichu safely. Strong priority attacks, such as Sucker Punch from Cacturne or Shiftry, can revenge kill Raichu once it has suffered some prior damage. On the other hand, faster attackers, such as Swellow and Floatzel, can pick off a weakened Raichu with Boomburst or Hydro Pump, respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot is used to boost Raichu's Special Attack to terrifying levels, allowing it to break holes in the opposing team more easily. Thunderbolt is Raichu's primary STAB attack, being reliable and powerful and having decent neutral coverage against most of the tier. Focus Blast provides excellent coverage alongside Thunderbolt, most notably hitting Rhydon, Ferroseed, and Piloswine. Hidden Power Ice is the preferred option to take up the last moveslot, hitting the Grass-types such as Roselia, Torterra, Lilligant, and Vileplume that otherwise give Raichu a hard time; however, Hidden Power Grass is an option to hit Lanturn and Quagsire harder. Before using Hidden Power Grass, it should be noted that Focus Blast 2HKOes Lanturn at +2 and Quagsire unboosted, so Hidden Power Grass should only be used if you favor reliability over the additional coverage that Hidden Power Ice would have.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed allows Raichu to hit as hard and as fast as possible, letting it Speed tie with Tauros and Archeops. Life Orb grants Raichu a much better damage output, most notably giving it the ability to OHKO Klinklang and 2HKO Mega Audino after Stealth Rock with Focus Blast and +2 Thunderbolt, respectively. Lightning Rod increases Raichu's defensive utility by boosting its Special Attack if it is hit with an Electric-type attack, letting it check opposing Electric-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ideally, Raichu should be sent out mid- or late-game once its checks have been sufficiently weakened, potentially set up a Nasty Plot, and clean up the opposing team. Be sure to recognize when to set up Nasty Plot and when to hold off on it, as a misprediction can often spell the end for Raichu due to its frailty; accordingly, Raichu should set up either against Pokemon that can't hurt it, such as Rotom-S, or against foes it threatens out, such as Pelipper. Raichu can be played early-game as a pivot to punish users of Electric-type attacks, taking advantage of foes that utilize common attacks such as Volt Switch and Thunder Wave. It should be noted that this strategy is risky, as most Pokemon that use these attacks can still beat Raichu with alternative attacks, such as Rotom's Shadow Ball. Using coverage moves as needed is recommended; for example, if you are predicting Rhydon or Piloswine to come in on Raichu to take the predicted Thunderbolt, Raichu should use Focus Blast.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Raichu appreciates being paired with strong wallbreakers such as Shiftry, Magmortar, and Primeape, as they can pave the way for Raichu to sweep late-game. Shiftry in particular makes for an outstanding offensive partner to Raichu, removing or severely weakening most of its checks, such as Lanturn, beating most opposing Grass-types, and generally breaking walls so that Raichu can clean up late-game, while Raichu beats the Flying-types that trouble Shiftry, such as Scyther. Magmortar can defeat Grass-types, wear down Lanturn, and bust holes in defensive teams so that Raichu can have an easier time cleaning them up; in return, Raichu beats the Water-types that trouble Magmortar. Flying-types such as Archeops and Vivillon can help wear down Lanturn, pressure Grass-types, and appreciate Raichu discouraging the use of Electric-type attacks with Lightning Rod. In general, Pokemon that appreciate Raichu deterring the use of Electric-type attacks make for solid partners, as Raichu provides them with a safety net of sorts. Raichu greatly appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Mesprit and Garbodor, getting chip damage on the foe as it switches in. Mesprit in particular can set up Stealth Rock, is immune to the Ground-type attacks that comprise Raichu's sole weakness, and provides Healing Wish support to bring back a weakened Raichu so that it can play more recklessly. Alternatively, Garbodor can set up Spikes and punishes users of priority moves, which Raichu is susceptible to.</p>"

Unfortunately, it faces a lot of competition from other Rapid Spin users that also resist Stealth Rock; Claydol also has an immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes thanks to Levitate as well as a superior offensive movepool to defend itself with, especially when combating spinblockers, whereas Hitmonchan boasts far greater utility throughout a match with Drain Punch and Mach Punch. Steelix, Rhydon, and Piloswine overshadow Sandslash as a bulky Ground-type due to their greater bulk and number of resistances, whereas Rhydon, Torterra, and Golurk are superior Ground-type attackers due to their access to secondary STAB moves and better coverage. Because Sandslash is outclassed in several roles, it is thus relegated to being one of the main driving forces behind sand teams, due to its Sand Rush ability giving it access to speedy Ground-type attacks, while its spinning capabilities are put to better use. Be warned that sand teams are extremely exploitable defensively and face competition from the more rewarding and less restrictive weather playstyles in rain and sun, plus the fact that Sandslash isn't worth using anywhere else, so you'd have to be pretty committed if you're considering using this Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sandslash doesn't really have much business attempting any other set aside from being a Sand Rush sweeper, so it doesn't have many options to choose from its already narrow movepool. X-Scissor nets coverage against Grass-types such as Shiftry, Lilligant, Ludicolo, and Torterra, as well as nailing Malamar, though its coverage risks being redundant with Earthquake and Knock Off otherwise. Sandslash can attempt to support the team on its own using moves such as Stealth Rock and even Sandstorm, but that isn't recommended, as it costs Sandslash a valuable moveslot, and spending an idle turn not boosting or attacking puts Sandslash in a riskier position, which can dash its chances for a sweep. Passho, Yache, and Rindo Berry can be considered to keep Sandslash from being revenge killed by Water-, Ice-, and Grass-types, respectively, allowing it the opportunity to overwhelm them or even simply get the Rapid Spin off. However, Sandslash's Special Defense is still too low to comfortably survive hits from the primarily specially offensive Water- and Grass-type moves of the tier, so the Berries primarily apply to physical blows. Lum Berry is a decent option to improve Sandslash's matchup against Ghost-types if spinning is of greater importance to your team, and it helps to thwart status ailments in general to enable easier Swords Dance opportunities. Super Fang is an option to shave off half the HP of Sandslash's switch-ins, though Sandslash would most likely remain unable to finish them off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Negating Sand</strong>: Abomasnow stands out one of Sandslash's most threatening foes, as it automatically wipes out the sand that gives Sandslash the speed advantage, resists Earthquake, and can destroy Sandslash with either of its STAB attacks, although it doesn't take kindly to switching into Rock-type moves and fails to outrun Jolly Sandslash. While Ludicolo doesn't summon rain automatically, it does have the luxury of being able to set up Rain Dance in front of Sandslash without much trouble and threaten a countersweep. Weather setters such as Liepard, Mesprit, Regirock, and Volbeat can set up weather and rob Sandslash's offensive momentum and proceed to have their Swift Swim or Chlorophyll teammates pick Sandslash off.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Torterra has an easy time keeping Sandslash in check due to its high Defense and Ground resistance and can easily dispose of Sandslash with its Grass-type STAB attack or even take advantage of it by setting up. Vileplume can stomach an Earthquake and OHKO Sandslash with Giga Drain, while Gourgeist-XL survives even +2 Life Orb-boosted Adamant Knock Off and can retaliate with Will-O-Wisp or Foul Play; however, both of these Pokemon need to be wary of Sandstorm reducing Synthesis's effectiveness, meaning they risk being whittled into KO range. Offensive Grass-types such as Shiftry and Lilligant aren't OHKOed by Sandslash's unboosted attacks bar X-Scissor, and they easily revenge kill it outside of the sandstorm. Shiftry can also pick off a weakened Sandslash with Sucker Punch, and Sandslash risks running out of sand turns if it attempts to stall out Sucker Punch's PP.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Sandslash can struggle with various physically defensive Pokemon in the tier, especially if they threaten Sandslash enough to deter Swords Dance. Weezing can threaten with Will-O-Wisp, Gastrodon and Pelipper can threaten with Scald, and Quagsire simply does not care about anything Sandslash does. Tanky Pokemon give Sandslash trouble as well, with Piloswine picking off Sandslash with Icicle Crash followed up with Ice Shard, while Gurdurr's bulk plus access to Drain Punch and Mach Punch allows it to take on Sandslash one-on-one fairly consistently. Bulk-invested Levitate Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Mesprit, Rotom, and Mismagius, that wield a Colbur Berry can also stop Sandslash in its tracks using Energy Ball and Will-O-Wisp, respectively; the Ghost-types can also spinblock against Sandslash if need be.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Sandslash outside of sand is really quite vulnerable, as nearly every faster Pokemon in the tier either does major damage to it, cripples it with status, or simply OHKOes it, with only a handful losing in a one-on-one matchup. A special mention goes to those that either resist or are immune to Earthquake, such as Charizard, Haunter, Lilligant, Ludicolo, SubToxic Mantine, Choice Specs Mesprit, Swellow, Rotom, and Vivillon.</p>",

      "Sand Rush": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Sandslash's STAB attack and cleaning tool, giving Sandslash very reliable damage output. Stone Edge lets Sandslash beat down Flying-types such as Charizard, Archeops, and Scyther while also allowing it to 2HKO Colbur Berry Xatu. Knock Off hits Ghost-types looking to block Rapid Spin and is a good coverage move in general due to its decent neutral coverage with Ground as well as its disruptive item removal effect. Swords Dance bolsters Sandslash's power and greatly improves its sweeping potential as well as its ability to punch holes into bulkier Pokemon, particularly by beating down the frailer Colbur Berry spinblockers with +2 Knock Off. Rapid Spin is a good option if Sandslash's team has many alternative sweepers, as it clears the field of entry hazards, particularly Toxic Spikes, which can be dangerous for its teammates.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment maximizes Sandslash's damage output, enhancing its sweeping ability with Sand Rush. Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature allow Sandslash to outrun base 95 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Jynx, Haunter, and Primeape, as well as +2 Speed Adamant Barbaracle, after the Sand Rush boost. When outside of sand, Sandslash can outrun Hasty Abomasnow and neutral-natured Samurott and Ludicolo, as well as Speed tie with offensive Adamant Hitmonchan. An Adamant nature can be used for more power in exchange for failing to outspeed the likes of Choice Scarf Rotom, Jynx, Haunter and +2 Barbaracle. Sandslash can adopt an alternative bulkier spread, incorporating maximum Attack investment alongside an Adamant nature, 136 Speed EVs, and the remaining EVs into HP. This gives Sandslash more opportunities to set up Swords Dance and sweep while still allowing it to naturally outrun Adamant Aggron and outspeed up to Swellow with the aid of Sand Rush. Life Orb maximizes Sandslash's power and KO potential, but Earth Plate can be considered so Sandslash doesn't incur recoil damage, especially when using Rapid Spin.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sandslash should aim to sweep with Earthquakes, preferably Swords Dance-boosted ones, after the opposing team has been sufficiently weakened mid- to late-game. Sandslash can also throw out Earthquakes to weaken or take out bulky Rock- and Steel-types early-game if a Swords Dance boost isn't necessary, and it helps to maintain offensive presence as well as support Stoutland. It can gain Swords Dance opportunities by scaring out Pokemon it can OHKO, such as Pyroar, Magmortar, Garbodor, Skuntank, and Aggron, or against Pokemon that aren't strong enough to threaten it, such as Steelix, Regirock, and Clefairy. Sandslash can also be brought in directly on the likes of Regirock and non-Grass move Garbodor to start attacking or setting up. Sandslash can also use Rapid Spin if entry hazards need to be cleared to ease switching. Because spinning isn't a particularly high priority for Sandslash, the Sandslash user can afford to bluff the spin and lure in the opponent's spinblocker to get free turns or attacks off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Smooth Rock Hippopotas is absolutely mandatory as a teammate, as Sandslash badly needs Sand Rush active in order to function adequately. Stoutland is an important partner for Sandslash as well, as they complement each other well offensively and form a powerful, speedy core, with Stoutland functioning as the immediate holepuncher among the duo. Mesprit can be a very appealing teammate, as it has the bulk and Speed to be able to perform supportive roles such as Stealth Rock and Healing Wish, as well as being a switch-in for Fighting- and Ground-type attacks. Though novel, Mesprit can even act as a backup Sandstorm setter with Smooth Rock. Teammates that can deal with Pokemon that Sandslash, and by extension Stoutland, have difficulty breaking through are recommended. Powerful wallbreakers such as Magmortar, Charizard, Aurorus, Jynx, Shiftry, Will-O-Wisp + Hex Rotom, and Haunter can pummel the likes of Weezing, Gourgeist-XL, and Pelipper, while Sandslash can provide Rapid Spin support for most of these wallbreakers, which are weak to Stealth Rock. Aurorus even receives a Special Defense boost from sand, though it must obviously forgo Snow Warning. Attackers that resist Sandslash's weaknesses to Grass, Ice, and Water, or simply can help take special attacks for it, are especially notable partners.</p>"

  "Clefairy": {
    "overview": "<p>Clefairy's main niche lies in its stellar ability, Magic Guard, granting it an immunity to all forms of passive damage, making it stand out among other defensive Pokemon. Additionally, Clefairy sports great special bulk bolstered by Eviolite, which lets it soft check some of NU's most powerful special attackers such as Magmortar, Pyroar, and mixed attacking Samurott. Though Clefairy does face stiff competition from Mega Audino, which sports better bulk and is immune to Knock Off's item-removal effect, Clefairy sets itself apart with its ability to only take one to turn to restore lost HP and only use up one moveslot in doing so, letting it use a wider array of support options. However, Clefairy relies on Eviolite in order to stomach hits from powerful attackers, making it vulnerable to Knock Off and therefore unable to switch into Dark- and Fighting-types as well as it would like to despite its resistances. Clefairy also suffers from being passive, as even with Calm Mind boosts its damage output is still disappointing, causing it to be a free switch in for quite a few Pokemon such as Steelix and Rhydon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Encore can be used to take advantage of setup sweepers that would otherwise use Clefairy as setup bait. Heal Bell can be used to provide cleric support, providing more utility for more defensively inclined teams, but generally, Mega Audino works better in this regard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steelix is one of the best answers to Clefairy, as it resists Moonblast and is immune to Thunder Wave, while in return, it 2HKOes with Heavy Slam. Other Steel-types such as Mawile and Klinklang threaten to OHKO Clefairy with their respective STAB moves, but both cannot reliably switch in due to Thunder Wave and Fire Blast. Ferroseed takes very little from Moonblast, doesn't mind being paralyzed by Thunder Wave, and it can use Clefairy to freely set up Spikes or Knock Off its Eviolite; however, Fire Blast 2HKOes and its Calm Mind set uses Ferroseed as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Weezing hits Clefairy with Sludge Bomb and can Taunt it, preventing it from using Calm Mind or Thunder Wave, though it potentially loses to Calm Mind if it has been paralyzed on the switch. Skuntank switches into Clefairy's moves comfortably and can 2HKO with Poison Jab or render it helpless with Taunt. Bulky Garbodor 2HKOes with Gunk Shot, and offensive variants have a chance to OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as Mismagius and Pyroar work well at preventing Clefairy from spreading status or setting up, and both can take Moonblast very well with their high Special Defense and typing, respectively. However, both cannot stand being slowed down by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Eviolite Removal</strong>: While it does resist Knock Off, Clefairy relies heavily on its Eviolite in order to take on powerful special attackers and thus is left vulnerable against even Dark- and Fighting-types because most of them carry the move, particularly Hariyama, Shiftry, and Liepard. Trick from the likes of Rotom, Rotom-S, and Jynx also heavily cripples Clefairy, as not only does it lose a lot bulk from the loss of Eviolite but it also despises being locked into a move by Choice items.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast is Clefairy's most powerful and reliable STAB move that targets Fighting- and Dark-type Pokemon such as Hariyama, Hitmonchan, and Shiftry and has a decent chance to lower the foe's Special Attack, letting it tank hits much more comfortably. Seismic Toss is an alternative to deal more damage to the likes of Steelix, Weezing, and Garbodor. Make sure to use it in tandem with Knock Off as Clefairy cannot touch Rotom otherwise. Soft-Boiled grants Clefairy reliable recovery, ensuring it stays healthy throughout the match. Thunder Wave cripples Pokemon that attempt to use Clefairy as setup bait and is also useful for slowing down speedy threats such as Pyroar and Swellow. Stealth Rock supports the entire team by racking up chip damage. If the team already has another Pokemon with Stealth Rock, Knock Off lets Clefairy remove items, which is beneficial to weaken wallbreakers that use Life Orb or Choice items and hinder defensive Pokemon that rely on their item for longevity such as Steelix, Weezing, and Rhydon. Healing Wish can be used to give a weakened Pokemon a second shot at sweeping.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and a Calm nature maximize Clefairy's special bulk, enabling it to switch into powerful special attackers such as Pyroar, Magmortar, and Samurott. Eviolite increases Clefairy's defenses further, letting it take special hits more effectively and additionally letting it soft check some Fighting-types. Magic Guard is chosen to make it immune to status such as burn and poison and all entry hazards.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Clefairy to pivot into powerful special attackers such as Magmortar and Samurott. Just be sure to scout for Samurott's set before switching into it, as Clefairy loses to its Swords Dance set. Clefairy can also be brought in on status moves such as Rotom's Will-O-Wisp, letting it act as a status sponge for the team. Once Clefairy is brought in, it's generally best to throw out Thunder Wave, crippling potential switch-ins. Try to keep Clefairy healthy with Soft-Boiled and use it in situations where the foe cannot deal much damage in return. However, when at low HP and pinned up against a setup sweeper, do not use Soft-Boiled, as this gives the opponent a free setup opportunity; instead, either use Thunder Wave or switch out to the appropriate teammate. When a free turn presents itself, use it as an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock if Clefairy has not already done so. Healing Wish should be used carefully; it may be tempting to bring back a weakened teammate to full health, but its use should generally be avoided if Clefairy is needed to check a specific threat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Pelipper and Poliwrath pair best with this set, as they are able to switch into Steelix, one of Clefairy's best and most common answers, and can check other Steel-types such as Klinklang and Mawile. Samurott functions in a similar manner, being able to threaten Steelix and Rhydon while also appreciating Clefairy's ability to give it a second shot at sweeping with Healing Wish or slow down faster foes with Thunder Wave. Weezing also switches into Steelix freely and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp; it also switches into Fighting-types reliably, while Clefairy is able to switch into powerful special attackers that take advantage of Weezing's mediocre Special Defense. Rotom switches into Steelix, Klinklang, and Scyther very well, burns all of them with Will-O-Wisp, and takes advantage of Clefairy's ability to spread Thunder Wave, not only slowing down faster threats for Rotom but also providing it with a full-powered Hex without the need for it to spread status of its own. Slower wallbreakers such as Magmortar and Aurorus also pair well with Clefairy, as both appreciate its ability to slow down faster threats with Thunder Wave.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind lets Clefairy simultaneously boost its Special Attack and Special Defense, making it difficult for the opposing team to manage after a couple boosts. Moonblast is a reliable STAB move that has good neutral coverage, notably hitting Dark- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Shiftry, Hariyama, and Hitmonchan, as well as a nice chance the lower the foe's Special Attack. Soft-Boiled is mandatory to ensure Clefairy is able to stay healthy so it can keep setting up Calm Mind. Thunder Wave lets Clefairy slow down its checks, such as Garbodor, Weezing, and Klinklang, while also potentially netting free turns. Fire Blast is an alternative that lets Clefairy hit Steel-types, which wall this set otherwise, and is used over Flamethrower to score the 2HKO on Steelix after a Calm Mind boost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread plus Eviolite lets Clefairy avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Primeape's Earthquake and Stone Edge, Choice Specs Swellow's Boomburst, and non-Life Orb Magmortar's Fire Blast. Magic Guard is used to grant Clefairy an immunity to all forms of passive damage, ensuring that it can keep setting up even after inflicted with poison or burn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While Clefairy's checks and counters are still present, use Thunder Wave to catch them on the switch so it has a better shot at cleaning through teams. When matched up against Steelix, though, switch into teammates that are able to check it, as Clefairy has no means of dealing with it. If Fire Blast is used, however, use it to catch Steel-types on the switch to wear them down to the point where they cannot check Clefairy anymore. Once Clefairy's checks have been crippled or weakened, set up Calm Mind to initiate a sweep mid- to late-game. When setting up Calm Mind, try not to be greedy with the boosts, as the more turns it wastes, the more likely it is to be KOed with a critical hit. Use Soft-Boiled to stay healthy throughout the game, and use it on turns that it is its safe to do so. In some situations where Clefairy has around half of its HP, the opponent might try to take advantage of Clefairy using Soft-Boiled that turn to get a free switch in. Respond to this by using Thunder Wave or attacking. Try to avoid being hit by Knock Off, as without Eviolite, Clefairy is left vulnerable to more physical attackers and cannot set up Calm Mind as comfortably against special attackers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Weezing is a great partner, as it can burn foes with Will-O-Wisp, letting Clefairy set up Calm Mind against physical attackers much more comfortably, as well as switch into Steelix, one of the biggest stops to this set without Fire Blast. Weezing's access to Toxic Spikes also aids Clefairy when setting up, letting it stall out foes it cannot beat otherwise such as Musharna. Rotom also works well at dismantling Steelix and supports Clefairy by spreading burns as well. Steelix can switch into a multitude of physical attackers that can heavily damage Clefairy such as Klinklang, Garbodor, Tauros, Kangaskhan, and Archeops. It also hard stops Musharna and Mega Audino, which can otherwise win a Calm Mind war versus Clefairy. Pelipper can switch into Steelix by virtue of its typing and switches into Fighting-types semi-reliably. Vileplume functions in a similar manner, except that it tends to invite Fire-types that Clefairy can use as setup bait. Fire-types such as Magmortar and Pyroar are useful for breaking past Steel-types that otherwise are a hard stop to this set. Magmortar in particular appreciates Thunder Wave support, letting it threaten faster threats.</p>"

  "Ninetales": {
    "overview": "<p>Ninetales distinguishes itself from other Fire-types in the tier with its access to a Special Attack-boosting move in Nasty Plot, as well as a very useful ability in Flash Fire, which allows it to pivot into predicted Fire-type attacks from the likes of Magmortar, Pyroar and Combusken and absorb Will-O-Wisp from Gourgeist-XL and Mismagius. Ninetales also has good coverage with moves such as Psyshock and Energy Ball, allowing it to get past many traditional Fire-type checks, namely Hariyama and Rhydon. Additionally, a great Speed stat allows Ninetales to outspeed many common offensive Pokemon, including Mesprit, Lilligant, Jynx, Vivillon, and Haunter. However, Ninetales is easily revenge killed by faster threats such as Archeops, Tauros, and Floatzel. Unfortunately, Ninetales also has a reliance on boosting with Nasty Plot in order to hit anything substantially hard due to its middling power and is easily worn down due to its dependence on Life Orb and susceptibility to all forms of entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A bulkier set with Substitute and Calm Mind and Leftovers can be used, but it means Ninetales is not going to be hitting very hard until it has accumulated many boosts. A set with Will-O-Wisp and Charcoal can be used; however, most targets of Will-O-Wisp are getting hit very hard by Psyshock regardless. Passho Berry makes Ninetales an effective Water-type lure, allowing it to survive one Water-type move from the likes of Samurott, Kabutops and Floatzel and potentially OHKO with Energy Ball. Likewise, Shuca Berry can be used to let Ninetales better handle Sturdy Steelix, Rhydon, and Piloswine. Leftovers is another option for passive healing, but it sacrifices the much-needed power boost that Life Orb provides. Finally, Hypnosis is a fun option to catch switch-ins off guard, but it is unreliable and comes at the cost of sacrificing vital coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Ninetales's frailty and Speed tier leave it vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster threats such as Archeops, Tauros, and Floatzel. Ninetales is also quite vulnerable to being picked off by strong priority from the likes of Kabutops, Samurott, Kangaskhan, and Shiftry.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Ninetales is weak to Stealth Rock and is further harmed and crippled by Spikes and Toxic Spikes, respectively. Entry hazard damage is especially detrimental for Ninetales as it quickly whittles away at its health when combined with Life Orb recoil.</p> <p><strong>Thick Fat Users</strong>: Grumpig and Miltank can both comfortably come in on a Fire Blast and cripple Ninetales with Thunder Wave. Hariyama can also switch into Fire Blast, though it is unable to check Ninetales once it has a boost up due to Psyshock hitting it on its weaker defense.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Ninetales's Special Attack to incredible levels, turning it into an extremely threatening late-game sweeper. Fire Blast is Ninetales's most powerful STAB move, netting OHKOs and 2HKOs Flamethrower misses out on. Psyshock allows Ninetales to get past the most common Fire-type check in the tier, Hariyama, as well as other specially bulky walls such as Magmortar and Mantine. Energy Ball grants Ninetales coverage on Rock types such as Rhydon, as well as bulky Water-types such as Prinplup, Gastrodon, Samurott, Lanturn, Kabutops, and Barbaracle. However, Hidden Power Electric is an option over Energy Ball to hit Pelipper and Mantine, which would otherwise threaten Ninetales out, while also maintaining coverage on most other Water-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and a Timid nature maximize Ninetales's offensive presence and Speed, allowing it to outspeed many offensive threats including Lilligant, Vivillon, Jynx, Mesprit, and Kangaskhan. Ninetales is quite weak before boosting, so Life Orb is used to increase its power. Flame Plate can be substituted over Life Orb to retain a boost on Fire Blast without the cost of recoil, but this takes away from the power of Ninetales's important coverage moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Take advantage of Flash Fire by pivoting Ninetales into common Will-O-Wisp users such as Weezing, Rotom, and Gourgeist-XL, as well as Fire-type attacks from the likes of Pyroar and Magmortar. However, It is important to keep hazards off the field when using Ninetales, as they hinder its ability to pivot and can wear it down quickly in conjunction with Life Orb recoil. Ninetales should try to set up on passive pokemon such as Mega Audino, Gourgeist-XL, Vileplume, and Weezing, which cannot do much back to it. However, if the opponent has a pokemon capable of revenge killing Ninetales, it is better to just fire off an attack rather than boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal is crucial when using Ninetales, so Pokemon such as Pelipper, Mantine, Hitmonchan, Prinplup, and Sandslash make for great teammates. Bulky Water-types such as Poliwrath, Lanturn, and Samurott are spectacular partners, being able to check Ground-, Rock- and other Water-types, which harass Ninetales. In return, Ninetales uses the Grass-types that plague them as setup fodder. Poliwrath in particular makes for a good partner, resisting Rock-type moves and sporting an immunity to Water. Grass-types such as Lilligant, Abomasnow, and Shiftry appreciate the utility Ninetales provides with Flash-Fire, and they check Water-, Ground- and Rock-types in return. For the same reason, physically offensive teammates such as Kangaskhan, Tauros, and Primeape appreciate having a partner than can absorb Will-O-Wisps. Entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes are very beneficial to Ninetales, as it lacks the raw power needed to muscle past neutral targets. Specifically, entry hazards are useful to break Steelix's Sturdy as well as securing the OHKO on uninvested Rotom after Stealth Rock. Partnering Ninetales with strong Fire-types such as Pyroar and Magmortar creates a powerful wallbreaking core, as Ninetales breaks down common Fire-type switch-ins such as Hariyama, Rhydon, and Lanturn.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Vileplume is a fantastic defensive pivot thanks to its great typing coupled with solid defenses, and its easy access to recovery options in both Giga Drain and Moonlight enhances its durability and capacity to handle many offensive Pokemon. Effect Spore is a great ability, punishing contact move users such as Kangaskhan, Primeape, Hitmonchan, Tauros, and Hariyama, further aiding Vileplume's matchup against physical attackers. Unlike most other defensively inclined Pokemon, Vileplume has a great Special Attack stat that allows it to hit hard even without investment. Unfortunately, its typing gives it weaknesses to many common special attacking types, such as Ice, Fire, and Psychic. These common weaknesses in conjunction with its low Speed leave Vileplume easily forced out early-game and can make its role as a defensive pivot a bit more difficult.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aromatherapy instead of Sleep Powder or Hidden Power allows defensive Vileplume to act as a cleric for its team. Stun Spore allows Vileplume to annoy common Fire-type switch-ins and cripple them for the rest of the match. Finally, a standalone Chlorophyll sweeper set could potentially be used; however, it sacrifices the defensive capabilities of Vileplume, and despite its better bulk, it is mostly outclassed by Victreebel due to Victreebel's access to a stronger Fire-type coverage move in Weather Ball.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Combusken, Charizard, Magmortar, and Pyroar are solid answers to Vileplume, being able to switch into Giga Drain comfortably, and in Magmortar's case, into Sleep Powder too. These Pokemon can also outspeed Vileplume and threaten to OHKO it with their STAB moves. However, they do not appreciate switching into a Sludge Bomb, particularly disliking the poison chance, which can severely hamper their longevity.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types including Mesprit, Musharna, and Jynx force Vileplume out or threaten to KO it with Psychic. Due to their typically high Special Defense, they can also switch into Vileplume directly in a pinch; however, none of them want to be poisoned, and Jynx will have a hard time switching in, especially with Stealth Rock up.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types such as Aurorus, Jynx, and Abomasnow can easily KO Vileplume if it chooses to stay in, although they hate getting poisoned by Sludge Bomb. Abomasnow and Aurorus are particularly annoying for Vileplume, as the hail they set reduces the amount of HP Moonlight recovers, and it also negates any healing Vileplume would be receiving from Black Sludge.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Scyther, Archeops, Vivillon, and Rotom-S aren't weak to Vileplume's common coverage moves and can KO it back with their super effective STAB moves. However, they must be wary of switching into Sleep Powder.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain is a decently strong STAB move that lets Vileplume restore some HP. Moonlight provides Vileplume with reliable recovery, allowing it to heal itself when damaged and come in more easily throughout the match. Sludge Bomb is Vileplume's strongest STAB move and has a decent 30% chance to poison the foe, thus punishing switch-ins. Sleep Powder puts common switch-ins such as Garbodor, Charizard, Weezing, and Klinklang to sleep, letting Vileplume safely switch out to a teammate and generate free turns. Synthesis can be run alongside Moonlight to increase the amount of recovery Vileplume has, helping it significantly in longer games. Worry Seed is a useful option that turns the foe's ability into Insomnia, preventing Malamar from setting up with Superpower, and Calm Mind Mega Audino from using Rest. Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types such as Ferroseed, Magnet Rise Klinklang, and Mawile, all of which would otherwise be able to set up on Vileplume or lay entry hazards. Hidden Power Ground is an alternative option that hits Poison-types, specifically Garbodor and Skuntank, while retaining coverage on Steel-types with the exception of Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and a Bold nature maximize physical bulk, allowing Vileplume to sponge hits from threats such as Primeape, Hariyama, Barbaracle, Shiftry, and Samurott. Black Sludge gives Vileplume passive recovery, making it even harder to wear down. Effect Spore punishes physical attackers, letting Vileplume potentially inflict a status ailment upon the foe, and it can also work well in conjunction with Rocky Helmet. Vileplume can run a fully specially defensive spread to better wall Water-, Grass-, and Electric-types; however, this greatly detracts from its physical bulk, meaning you will need a better check for Fighting-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Vileplume can pivot into strong physical hits, such as Primeape and Hariyama's Close Combat, Samurott's Waterfall, Steelix's Heavy Slam, and Barbaracle's Razor Shell. Thanks to its typing, Vileplume can also comfortably switch into most status moves such as Sleep Powder and Toxic. Take advantage of switches to heal back HP with Moonlight if Vileplume has taken significant amounts of damage. However, use Moonlight conservatively, as it is a low-PP move, and Vileplume wants to be able to heal up often throughout the course of a match. Both of Vileplume's STAB moves are very spammable, with Sludge Bomb in particular having good power and a high chance to poison the foe. Vileplume can also use Sleep Powder on switch-ins looking to take advantage of it, such as Garbodor, Klinklang, Mawile, and Haunter. Worry Seed should be used discreetly, as Malamar and Mega Audino are less likely to begin setting up if they know Vileplume has Worry Seed in its arsenal. When running Hidden Power Fire, try to catch Ferroseed on the switch so you can prevent it from setting up entry hazards. Alternatively, with Hidden Power Ground, Vileplume can lure in Poison-types such as Garbodor and Skuntank and deal large amounts of damage to them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that resist Fire and Ice partner up very nicely with Vileplume, namely bulky Water-types such as Lanturn, Mantine, Prinplup, and Carracosta. Thick Fat users such as Grumpig and Hariyama also have fantastic synergy with Vileplume, resisting those types while also checking most special attackers in general. Moreover, Pokemon that resist Flying-type attacks, such as Regirock, Rhydon, Omastar, and Steelix, are extremely useful, the former three also providing a handy resistance to Fire-types. Furthermore, Dark-types such as Shiftry, Skuntank, and Liepard check most Psychic-types and appreciate Vileplume checking Fighting- and Fairy-types. The latter two can also provide Vileplume with Pursuit support to dispose of Xatu, Mesprit, and other Psychic-types.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain is a relatively strong STAB move that lets Vileplume restore some HP in the process. Sludge Bomb is Vileplume's strongest STAB move, hitting extremely hard while also having a solid 30% chance to poison the foe. Moonlight provides Vileplume with consistent recovery, allowing it to maintain its role as an offensive tank throughout the match. Hidden Power Ground hits Poison-types, specifically Garbodor and Skuntank, while also hitting most Steel-types with the exception of Ferroseed. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire lets Vileplume 2HKO Steel-types such as Klinklang, Steelix, Mawile, and Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and a Modest nature maximize Vileplume's offensive pressure while also maintaining its ability to tank hits. Black Sludge gives Vileplume a source of passive recovery. Toxic Plate is an option that lets Vileplume deal huge amounts of damage with Sludge Bomb; however, it comes at the cost of passive recovery, and it can hinder Vileplume's ability to switch into Pokemon it is meant to check. 52 Speed EVs allow Vileplume to outspeed uninvested Torterra as well as base 55s and below, such as Hariyama, Mega Audino, Regirock, Gourgeist-XL, and Omastar.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Vileplume should pivot into resisted hits from the likes of Samurott, Primeape, and Barbaracle and proceed to fire off powerful attacks. Furthermore, Vileplume can prey on bulky Water-, Ground-, Rock-, and Grass-types, such as Lanturn, Gastrodon, Rhydon, Omastar, Regirock, and Gourgeist-XL. Vileplume should use its dual STAB moves to punch holes into the opposing team in order to catch switch-ins off guard. This Vileplume set is best fitted onto more offensively oriented teams that need a switch-in for common Fighting- and Water-types that doesn't lose much momentum. If the opponent has a Fire-type such as Magmortar or Pyroar, it is best to throw out a Sludge Bomb rather than allow them a safe switch. Finally, take advantage of the switches forced against Water- and Grass-types to heal up with Moonlight.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can pivot into Fire- and Ice-type attacks, such as Hariyama, Magmortar, Prinplup, Lanturn, and Mantine, make great partners, while in return, Vileplume can cover any weaknesses to Rock-, Ground-, Grass-, Water-, and Fighting-types. Dark-types such as Skuntank and Liepard can check and Pursuit trap Psychic-types while also appreciating Vileplume's ability to switch into Fighting- and Fairy-types. Water-types such as Swords Dance Samurott and Shell Smash Barbaracle are good partners, as they can take advantage of the Fire-types that Vileplume tends to lure in, such as Charizard, Pyroar, and Magmortar.</p>"

  "Primeape": {
    "overview": "<p>Primeape stands out in the NeverUsed tier because of its great offensive typing coupled with a powerful STAB move in Close Combat and a formidable Attack stat. It further distinguishes itself from other Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Hariyama with its access to U-turn and high Speed stat. When equipped with a Choice Band, Primeape's wallbreaking prowess reaches frightening levels, capable of 2HKOing all but the bulkiest Pokemon. Additionally, Primeape is one of the few viable Choice Scarf users in the tier, outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame with a Jolly nature, as well as being able to revenge kill Lilligant and Vivillon at +1 and Omastar and Barbaracle at +2. Defiant is a useful ability that complements Primeape's role as a wallbreaker and pivot, letting Primeape punish the use of Defog from Pokemon such as Pelipper and Mantine, although it risks getting OHKOed if they choose to attack instead. Furthermore, Primeape's typing grants it a useful resistance to Sucker Punch, making it a decent offensive check to Kangaskhan, Shiftry, and Skuntank and also penalizing the latter two if they use Defog. Unfortunately, Primeape has mediocre bulk, meaning it can be difficult to justify using it over other Fighting-types that provide defensive utility, similar power, and priority moves, such as Hariyama and Hitmonchan. Primeape is also reliant on using a Choice Scarf, which makes it unable to wallbreak as effectively as it can with a Choice Band, to outspeed faster offensive Pokemon such as Archeops, Tauros, and Charizard. Finally, Primeape struggles to break through common Ghost- and Poison-types in the tier such as Gourgeist-XL, Golurk, Rotom, Weezing, Garbodor, and Vileplume as they resist or are immune to its main STAB move.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Encore and a Fist Plate can be used to prevent Pokemon from attempting to set up or heal against Primeape. However, it lacks both the power that Choice Band offers and the Speed that Choice Scarf provides. Thunder Punch hits Mantine and Pelipper harder than Stone Edge, but it is much weaker against Scyther and lacks coverage versus other Bug-types such as Pinsir. Finally, Punishment is a coverage option against Ghost- and Psychic-types, especially if the latter have set up with Calm Mind.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Poison-types</strong>: Bulky Poison-types such as Weezing, Vileplume, and Garbodor can switch into Close Combat with ease, and the former two are immune and neutral to Earthquake, respectively. Vileplume and Garbodor can even punish U-turn with Effect Spore and Rocky Helmet, respectively, while Vileplume can also heal off any damage Primeape inflicts upon it with Moonlight.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Mismagius, Rotom, and Haunter are completely immune to Close Combat and Earthquake and take hardly any damage from U-turn. Golurk in particular takes minimal damage from everything in Primeape's arsenal besides the rare Ice Punch. Rotom, Mismagius, and Gourgeist-XL can also cripple Primeape with status, effectively making it useless for the rest of the match.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Common Flying-types such as Scyther, Xatu, and Rotom-S are able to switch in on Primeape and OHKO it with their super effective STAB moves. Scyther also outspeeds and OHKOes Choice Band Primeape before it can attack. However, all Flying-types must be wary of switching into Stone Edge, especially Scyther, as a Stone Edge from even Choice Scarf Primeape with OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Musharna, Mesprit, and Claydol can comfortably take a Close Combat and threaten to OHKO Primeape with Psychic. However, Primeape can pivot out with U-turn and slowly wear them down. Musharna in particular is a huge threat to Primeape, as it can heal off any damage from U-turn with Moonlight.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Primeape's mediocre bulk, any powerful attacker that outspeeds it will be able to OHKO it. Examples include Archeops, Scyther, Tauros, Floatzel, Swellow, Choice Scarf Jynx, and Pyroar. However, all of these Pokemon must be wary of Primeape's Choice Scarf set, which is capable of revenge killing them with either Close Combat or Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with high physical bulk in general can put a halt to Choice Scarf Primeape, as it does not have the power to break through them. Some of these Pokemon include Torterra, Poliwrath, Mega Audino, Weezing, and Musharna.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat obliterates Normal-, Rock-, Steel-, Dark-, and Ice-types, as well as dealing huge amounts of damage to neutral targets. For example, it OHKOes Assault Vest Lanturn, Hitmonchan, Magmortar, Lilligant and Ludicolo from full HP. U-turn is one of Primeape's biggest niches over other Fighting-types, allowing it to maintain momentum while also hitting Psychic-types such as Musharna, Mesprit, Malamar, and Claydol super effectively. Stone Edge lets Primeape hit Flying-types such as Scyther, Rotom-S, and Xatu extremely hard if they switch in. Earthquake primarily hits Garbodor, which is otherwise very problematic, as it can wear down Primeape with Rocky Helmet. Earthquake also KOes Skuntank without triggering Aftermath. Alternatively, Ice Punch gives Primeape a way to hit Vileplume, Gourgeist-XL, and Torterra hard while providing coverage against Flying-types at the cost of being unable to OHKO Scyther. Gunk Shot is an option to 2HKO defensive Mega Audino and OHKO mixed defenses Clefairy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Primeape sports a standard offensive spread with maximum Attack and Speed investment to hit as hard and be as fast as possible. Jolly is the preferred nature, as an Adamant nature doesn't help it score any extra notable OHKOs and leaves it vulnerable to base 90 Speed threats such as Lilligant and Mr. Mime. With a Jolly nature, Primeape outspeeds positive-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon and below, such as Lilligant, Vivillon, Kangaskhan, Mr. Mime, and Zangoose, and Speed ties with base 95 Speed Pokemon, including Jynx, Haunter, and offensive Xatu. With a Choice Band, Primeape's Attack stat rises to extremely threatening levels, giving it significant wallbreaking power. Defiant allows Primeape to pivot into and punish Defoggers such as Pelipper and Mantine with a +2 Stone Edge. Alternatively, Vital Spirit lets Primeape absorb Sleep Powder from Lilligant and Vivillon and Spore or Dark Void from Smeargle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Primeape thrives in VoltTurn cores, which enable it to switch out of its counters and come into battle unscathed, as it does not have the bulk to switch into even neutral hits. After coming in, Primeape should be played as a wallbreaker that can punch holes in the opponent's team and make way for a teammate to sweep. Close Combat is Primeape's most spammable move, but if the opponent has a Fighting-type switch-in such as Vileplume or Gourgeist, it's best to simply use U-turn to gain momentum. Sometimes clicking the appropriate coverage move, such as Stone Edge on a predicted Scyther switch-in, can gain a huge amount of momentum, but it is important to weigh the risk versus the reward, as Primeape does not have the bulk to stomach hits if a prediction is wrong. Finally, Primeape's presence alone can be enough to deter the use of Defog due to the threat of Defiant, but if it seems likely that the opponent will use it, pivot Primeape in and punish them for doing so.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primeape fits best on VoltTurn offense; Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Rotom, Lanturn, Scyther, Xatu, and Manectric are all spectacular partners that can keep up momentum and help wear down one another's checks. Spikes-stacking support from Garbodor and Ferroseed pairs extremely well with Primeape, as Primeape can wear down its checks through pivoting with U-turn more effectively and, as a bonus, act as a Defog deterrent to keep hazards up. Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank and Liepard are amazing partners, trapping the bothersome Psychic- and Ghost-types that prevent Primeape from spamming Close Combat. Furthermore, speedy late-game sweepers such as Floatzel, Swellow, Archeops, and Choice Scarf Jynx work well in conjunction with Primeape's wallbreaking capabilities and can take on faster threats such as Charizard, Tauros, Pyroar, and Scyther in return. Additionally, Fire-types such as Magmortar and Pyroar can pivot into Will-O-Wisp from Weezing and Mismagius and appreciate Primeape's ability to break down their checks such as Assault Vest Hariyama, Regirock, Rhydon, and Lanturn.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is a strong STAB move capable of revenge killing fast threats such as Tauros, Swellow, Pyroar, Jynx, and +2 Omastar. U-turn lets Primeape gain momentum throughout the match, pivot out and wear down the opponent's side, and OHKO Shiftry and Malamar after Stealth Rock. Earthquake targets grounded Poison-types such as Garbodor and Skuntank, as well as Fire-types such as Magmortar and Combusken. Finally, Stone Edge lets Primeape revenge kill Flying-types such as Rotom-S, Scyther, Vivillon, and Archeops.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Primeape runs a standard offensive spread of maximum Attack and Speed investment in order to hit as hard as possible and outspeed the entire unboosted metagame with a Choice Scarf. A Jolly nature is pivotal for Primeape, as it grants it the ability to revenge kill Pokemon such as Omastar and Barbaracle at +2 and Lilligant and Vivillon at +1, as well as Speed tie with common base 95 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Jynx, Haunter, and opposing Primeape. Furthermore, an Adamant nature does not grant any extra relevant OHKOs and 2HKOs that Jolly Primeape misses out on. Defiant gives Primeape the opportunity to boost its Attack by two stages if it switches into a correctly predicted Defog, and it also punishes Intimidate Mawile. However, Vital Spirit is a viable alternative, allowing Primeape to pivot into Sleep Powder from Lilligant and Vivillon, as well as Spore or Dark Void from Smeargle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Primeape functions much differently from Choice Band Primeape, as it is a revenge killer rather than a wallbreaker. In order to preserve momentum, it is usually best to U-turn out early-game if the opponent has a healthy switch-in to Primeape's Close Combat. In this scenario, it would be wiser to avoid bringing in Primeape too often, as it can quickly drain momentum for your team if it is forced to click U-turn frequently. When using Defiant, Primeape should attempt to pressure Defoggers. Switch Primeape in when you predict that the opponent will use Defog, but be wary, as bulkier Defoggers such as Pelipper and Prinplup will not be OHKOed even at +2.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Primeape should be used on teams that appreciate a revenge killer that can maintain momentum with U-turn and OHKO fast threats such as Tauros, Pyroar, Jynx, and Archeops. Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Samurott, Nasty Plot Jynx, Shell Smash Omastar, and Swords Dance Pinsir appreciate Primeape's ability to revenge kill Pokemon that outspeed them and clean up after their sweep has been ended. In addition, Pursuit trappers are fantastic partners for Primeape, as they can easily be brought in against Psychic- and Ghost-types through U-turn and proceed to dispatch them. Pokemon such as Rotom, Scyther, Floatzel, and Lanturn are great partners for Primeape, forming a VoltTurn core with it and keeping up momentum while wearing down one another's checks. Hazard users such as Omastar, Garbodor, Ferroseed, and Steelix are good partners, as Primeape can take advantage of the passive damage they provide and, in return, can dissuade the use of Defog through the threat of Defiant.</p>"

  "Poliwrath": {
    "overview": "<p>Poliwrath's solid Water / Fighting typing along with Water Absorb grants it a unique array of resistances. This, combined with its impressive bulk, enables it to serve as an offensive check to many physical Water-types, such as Samurott, Kabutops, and Barbaracle, as well as Rock- and Steel-types such as Rhydon, Aggron, and Klinklang. Unfortunately, it is weak to many common offensive Pokemon like Rotom, Mesprit, Lilligant, and Ludicolo, which can all outspeed it. Poliwrath's lack of access to reliable recovery prevents it from fully utilizing its defensive typing. Poliwrath also lacks a good physical movepool, lacking a solid physical Fighting-type attack in particular, which leaves it reliant on its lower Special Attack stat to threaten most targets. Despite being a Water-type, it struggles to check Fire-types because of their strong secondary coverage like Magmortar's Thunderbolt or Charizard's Air Slash. Poliwrath is also slower than all the common Fire-types, forcing it to sponge at least one hit before attacking.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A combination of RestTalk + Circle Throw allows Poliwrath to check Aggron and Swords Dance Samurott better than Gastrodon can and shuffle the opposing team, making them take entry hazard damage, but unlike the more consistent Gastrodon, Poliwrath doesn't have Recover or Clear Smog. Substitute can be used block status. It can also be combined with Toxic to punish defensive switch-ins or with Focus Punch to punch holes in the opponent's team. Swift Swim + Belly Drum on rain teams can act as a deadly wincon, although it can be difficult to execute in certain matchups. Life Orb can be used to gain some power but wears Poliwrath down faster, making it harder for it to check certain Pokemon later in the match. Life Orb is usually used on a lure set to help weaken checks for other teammates. Hidden Power Electric can allow Poliwrath to lure in and KO Mantine and Pelipper for teammates. Choice Specs can allow Poliwrath to 2HKO Vileplume with Ice Beam and Gastrodon with Focus Blast but comes at the cost of Leftovers and being locked into a move, which is unfavorable for Poliwrath. Toxic lets Poliwrath cripple common defensive switch-ins like Mantine, Gastrodon, and Mega Audino, which could pave a way for other teammates that struggle with them. Hidden Power Grass can be used to beat Gastrodon consistently. Earthquake can be used for dealing with Lanturn better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Mantine can sponge Poliwrath's STAB moves and isn't weak to Ice Beam, and Air Slash heavily dents Poliwrath. Lanturn can also freely switch in and use Volt Switch but gets worn down faster by Focus Blast or a potential Scald. Gastrodon can beat Poliwrath if it isn't running some variation of the main set that is meant to beat Gastrodon.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Sliggoo, Clefairy, Musharna, and Mega Audino can shake off Poliwrath's attacks and use it for setup bait or fire off some attacks. All of these Pokemon also have recovery.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Most Grass-types like Ludicolo and Lilligant can come in on Scald and set up Rain Dance and Quiver Dance, respectively. Shiftry can threaten Poliwrath with Seed Bomb or Leaf Storm depending on if it has already locked itself into a move other than Vacuum Wave. Vileplume comes in much more easily, since it resists Poliwrath's Fighting-type STAB moves, and it can threaten it back with Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon with Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Pokemon with super effective attacks like Manectric, Scyther, Jynx, and Mesprit can all threaten to OHKO or 2HKO Poliwrath. Pokemon like Charizard, Scyther, and Mesprit also resist Vacuum Wave, making them harder for Poliwrath to win against.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Poliwrath's main STAB move and can burn the opponent's Pokemon to wear them down faster. Focus Blast hits a lot of Water-resistant Pokemon like Ferroseed and Gastrodon while also severely damaging Normal- and Steel-types like Kangaskhan and Klinklang. Ice Beam hits Grass-types like Lilligant and Vileplume on the switch. Vacuum Wave lets Poliwrath pressure faster Pokemon like Pyroar, Tauros, Swellow, and Shiftry and Speed-boosting Rock-types like Shell Smash Omastar, Barbaracle, and Rock Polish Rhydon; it also allows Poliwrath to become a situational revenge killer.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers provides passive recovery to let Poliwrath continuously come in on Pokemon like Kabutops and Swords Dance Samurott. Maximum Special Attack investment lets Poliwrath hit as hard as possible. 160 Speed EVs let Poliwrath outpace neutral-natured Aurorus and Torterra as well as base 55s like Exeggutor, Cacturne, and Golurk. The remaining 96 HP EVs are dumped into HP to boost Poliwrath's bulk. Water Absorb lets Poliwrath check certain Water-types like Floatzel and recover some HP off Water-type attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Preserve Poliwrath so it can check fast Pokemon like weakened Tauros, Pyroar, and Floatzel with Vacuum Wave. Note they all have ways of severely damaging Poliwrath, so make sure that Vacuum Wave will actually KO them before attempting to revenge kill them. Poliwrath should be brought out when a physical Water-type like Swords Dance Samurott hits the field, but beware of directly switching Poliwrath carelessly on Water-types, as they may be using a move like Grass Knot or Toxic to beat it. Poliwrath should try to be using Scald as often as possible to weaken traditional Water-type checks so it can punch through them later. Beware of switching Poliwrath into Fire-types like Magmortar and Combusken because they can hit it super effectively. Watch out for status users like Steelix or Piloswine, since Poliwrath despises being worn down faster.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-types like Combusken, Magmortar, and Charizard appreciate Poliwrath's ability to check Water-types like Kabutops and Barbaracle for them. In exchange, they can KO the opponent's Grass-types like Vileplume and Lilligant. Dark-types like Liepard, Skuntank, and Shiftry can help to remove Psychic-types like Musharna and Mesprit for Poliwrath, limiting Focus Blast switch-ins and one of Poliwrath's main weaknesses, with the former two being able to Pursuit trap them. Pinsir and Scyther are great partners, as Poliwrath can check the Rock-, Steel, and Fire-types that they dislike, while Pinsir and Scyther can get rid of Psychic-types and pressure Grass-types. Heal Bell from teammates such as Audino and Altaria can help Poliwrath remove unwanted status effects that chip it down. Poliwrath is a nice priority sponge, as it resists Sucker Punch, is immune to Aqua Jet, and is able to take Quick Attacks and Fake Outs with relative ease. This can help out frailer Pokemon like Swellow, Pyroar, and Manectric, which are all susceptible to priority. Since Poliwrath doesn't like hazards, a good entry hazard remover is key. Skuntank stands out as a great example, since it removes Toxic Spikes on the switch while also pressuring Grass- and Psychic-types that want to threaten Poliwrath. Claydol is also another decent partner for Poliwrath, since it can pivot into Volt Switch users attempting to gain momentum on Poliwrath.</p>"

  "Kadabra": {
    "overview": "<p>Kadabra sets itself apart from other Psychic-types thanks to Magic Guard, which lets it hold Focus Sash without worrying about it getting broken by residual damage, most notably entry hazards,  thus making Kadabra a good revenge killer. Due to its respectable Speed tier, high Special Attack, and good number of coverage options, it fares well against offensive teams. Kadabra also has some good support moves in Encore and Thunder Wave, both of which aid in neutralizing setup sweepers. Once its Focus Sash is broken, however, Kadabra is incredibly easy to revenge kill due to its paper-thin defenses. Moreover, it faces competition from Pokemon like Liepard and Focus Sash Jynx that are also good at taking out offensive threats. Kadabra is also relatively weak, especially because it often holds Focus Sash, meaning that it struggles to break through bulkier foes such as Musharna and Mega Audino.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb gives Kadabra much more firepower behind its attacks, with Magic Guard negating the recoil, but Kadabra's main niche lies in revenge killing Pokemon, and Mesprit is generally a better Life Orb user due to it having much better overall bulk. Calm Mind can be used to significantly increase Kadabra's Special Attack, but its general frailty and being slower than several offensive Pokemon generally make this an inferior option. Hidden Power Fighting can be used mainly to hit Pawniard while still dealing super effective damage to Klinklang and Ferroseed. Taunt has use in preventing Pokemon from recovering, setting up entry hazards, or removing entry hazards with Defog. Dazzling Gleam still hits Dark-types while nailing the likes of Zweilous, but it doesn't provide much coverage otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Audino and Musharna can take hits from Kadabra quite easily thanks to their fantastic natural bulk and recover off any damage taken with Wish and Moonlight, respectively. Both can take advantage of Kadabra to set up Calm Mind, but do note that Kadabra can take advantage of this by using Encore.</p> <p><strong>Skuntank</strong>: Skuntank can switch in on all of Kadabra's moves except for Hidden Power Ground and can trap it with Pursuit or revenge kill it with Sucker Punch; however, Kadabra can lock Skuntank into Sucker Punch with Encore and switch to another teammate.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Without the appropriate Hidden Power, Steel-types such as Ferroseed, Pawniard, and Klinklang can freely switch in on Kadabra, with the latter two being able to set up on it. Klinklang is also notable for its ability to bypass Kadabra's Focus Sash with Gear Grind.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Due to Kadabra's pitiful bulk, almost any priority move can pick it off. Kangaskhan is notable in that it can break its Focus Sash with Fake Out and follow up with Sucker Punch, preventing Kadabra from doing anything. Other priority users such as Samurott and Kabutops can pick off Kadabra once its Focus Sash is broken; however, neither of them appreciates getting crippled by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Tauros, Archeops, Liepard, and Pyroar are all capable of outspeeding and eliminating Kadabra; however, these Pokemon are only effective checks once its Focus Sash is broken, as Kadabra can cripple all of them with Thunder Wave. However, Liepard gets a special mention for its ability break Kadabra's Focus Sash with U-turn and switch out to a teammate to take a hit or absorb Thunder Wave.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic deals good damage to targets such as Primeape, Gurdurr, Garbodor, and Weezing. Psyshock is an alternative to hit specially bulky foes harder, most notably Assault Vest Hariyama and Magmortar. Signal Beam lets Kadabra revenge kill Pokemon such as Shiftry, Liepard, Cacturne, and Malamar while also letting it deal meaningful damage to Mesprit, Jynx, and Exeggutor. Hidden Power Ground hits Skuntank as well as Steel-types such as Klinklang and Mawile. Energy Ball is an alternative to primarily revenge kill Rhydon after a Rock Polish boost as well as target Lanturn, Quagsire, and other bulky Water-types. Thunder Wave cripples faster Pokemon such as Archeops, Tauros, and Floatzel as well as Speed-boosting sweepers such as Lilligant and Vivillon. Encore is an alternative to prevent Pokemon such as Calm Mind Musharna and Mega Audino from setting up freely on Kadabra and can lock a foe into an unfavorable move in general. Hidden Power Fire maintains coverage against Klinklang and Mawile, with the bonus of nailing Ferroseed. However, note that using Hidden Power Fire forces Kadabra to use a lower Speed IV and as such cannot speed tie with opposing base 105 Pokemon such as Scyther and Mismagius.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature ensure that Kadabra outspeeds Pokemon such as Jynx and Haunter, while maximum Special Attack EVs let it hit as hard as it possible. Magic Guard lets Kadabra avoid any sort of residual damage, keeping its Focus Sash intact until it takes direct damage. Focus Sash lets Kadabra effectively revenge kill faster Pokemon or cripple a foe that has set up, such as Quiver Dance Lilligant, with Thunder Wave.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As this set plays mostly as a revenge killer, it is absolutely critical to not directly switch Kadabra in; only switch it in after a Pokemon has fainted or with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. When Kadabra is brought in, use the appropriate STAB or coverage move to revenge kill a problematic foe. Try to keep its Focus Sash intact if it's vital for it to be around to check a sweeper. Against bulkier foes such as Musharna and Mega Audino, use Encore to lock them into an unfavorable move, switch out to a teammate, and respond accordingly. Encore is also useful to prevent Klinklang from setting up Substitute or Shift Gear for free and to lock defensive Pokemon into recovery moves. It also has a neat utility in locking Pokemon such as Cacturne and Shiftry into Sucker Punch, which can give a teammate a free opportunity to set up. If running Thunder Wave, it is best to use it against a fast Pokemon that the team struggles with otherwise, such as Archeops, Tauros, Scyther, or +1 Lilligant or Vivillon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set generally fits best on offensive teams that want a nice blanket check to a variety of fast Pokemon and threatening setup sweepers. Dark-types such as Shiftry and Cacturne make for good teammates, as they appreciate Kadabra's ability to revenge kill Pokemon such as Primeape, Gurdurr, and Hariyama, while they are able to switch in on Psychic-types such as Mesprit and Musharna in return. Rhydon can switch in on Skuntank, one of Kadabra's most consistent answers, and either threaten it with Earthquake or take advantage of it to set up Rock Polish. Encore makes this even easier, as Kadabra can lock Skuntank into Sucker Punch or Pursuit. In a similar vein, Fighting-types are also decent switch-ins to Skuntank, as are other Dark-types such as Liepard and Pawniard. Setup sweepers such as Klinklang and Swords Dance Samurott can also take advantage of a Pokemon locked into Encore by setting up freely, while the former appreciates Fighting-types weakened in order for it to sweep. Garbodor gets a special mention, as it punishes physical attackers by wearing them down with Rocky Helmet damage and provides Spikes support, which goes well with Kadabra's ability to force switches.</p>"

  "Machoke": {
    "overview": "<p>Impressive mixed defenses when boosted by Eviolite along with a high Attack stat and powerful STAB attack make Machoke a solid tank in the NU metagame. 100% accurate Dynamic Punch thanks to No Guard is what truly sets Machoke apart from other Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Gurdurr, as confusion allows it to more easily break through traditional Fighting-type counters such as Xatu, Mesprit, and Garbodor. Machoke also sports higher Special Defense than Gurdurr, which allows it to more easily combat special attackers such as Pyroar, Floatzel, and Magmortar, and more physical bulk than other popular Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Hariyama, allowing it to handle physical attackers such as Rhydon, Aggron, and Kangaskhan with greater ease. Unfortunately, Machoke is hindered by its low Speed stat and reliance on Eviolite to properly fulfill its role as a tank. Said reliance on Eviolite also makes it difficult for Machoke to serve as a Knock Off sponge, especially in comparison to fellow Dark-resistant Pokemon such as Throh and Poliwrath.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Machoke has a bountiful movepool with access to moves such as Earthquake, Rock Slide, Ice Punch, Poison Jab, Bullet Punch, and Thunder Punch, so an all-out attacking set consisting of Dynamic Punch, Knock Off, and two of these coverage moves can be very effective. However, this set is worn down incredibly easily and in many cases is outdone by other Fighting-types such as Hariyama, which have more immediate power and similar coverage. In theory, a Guts set utilizing Close Combat / Knock Off / Rest / Sleep Talk would work well; however, this set is almost always outclassed by other Fighting-types such as Hariyama, Hitmonchan, and Throh, which each offer more utility for a team than Machoke.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Bulky Ghost-types such as Colbur Berry Rotom and Gourgeist-XL are immune to Dynamic Punch and can take Knock Off fairly easily before burning Machoke and forcing it to use Rest.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Mesprit, Xatu, and Musharna all resist Dynamic Punch, can survive Knock Off, and are able to threaten Machoke with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Poison-types</strong>: Bulky Poison-types such as Garbodor, Weezing, and Vileplume all take negligible damage from both Dynamic Punch and Knock Off; however, they must beware of coverage options such as Earthquake and Ice Punch. Weezing in particular is threatening to Machoke, as it can burn it with Will-O-Wisp and also prevent it from Resting off the burn with Taunt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dynamic Punch is by far Machoke's best and most spammable move. The powerful and accurate STAB move with a 100% confusion chance and essentially no drawbacks allows Machoke to demolish bulky Rock- and Steel-types such as Aggron and Steelix while also potentially giving a teammate a free switch in or opportunity to set up. Knock Off has excellent coverage alongside Dynamic Punch, hitting Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Rotom, Mismagius, and Xatu for super effective damage while also removing the item from bulky Poison-types such as Vileplume, Weezing, and Garbodor. Unfortunately, without access to Drain Punch, Machoke relies on Rest to stay healthy throughout a battle. Rest is also useful for removing a harmful status ailment from Machoke. Sleep Talk allows Machoke to avoid being passive after using Rest and also can preserve Dynamic Punch PP for longer battles.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment alongside 212 Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature allows Machoke to always survive two Fire Blasts from Life Orb Pyroar and gives it a solid chance to tank two of Life Orb Samurott's Hydro Pumps without giving up too much Speed. 44 Speed EVs let Machoke outspeed common base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Regirock and Mega Audino. Eviolite increases Machoke's already decent defenses to impressive levels. A spread of 252 HP / 212 Def / 44 Spe allows Machoke to check physically offensive threats such as Kangaskhan, Hitmonchan, and Tauros lacking Zen Headbutt, avoiding a 3HKO from all three.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Unless you predict the opponent to switch in a Ghost-type such as Colbur Berry Rotom or Gourgeist-XL, it is almost always beneficial to click Dynamic Punch, as confusing a foe can give Machoke a free turn to follow up with a Knock Off or potentially allow a teammate to switch in and take advantage of the confused foe. If the opponent's team relies solely on Psychic- and Poison-types such as Mesprit, Xatu, and Garbodor to check Machoke, attacking with Dynamic Punch is usually the best play, as even if the opponent switches to said check, getting chip damage and confusion is incredibly beneficial. It is also unwise to recklessly switch Machoke into incredibly strong special attacks such as Choice Specs Pyroar's Fire Blast and Aurorus's Hyper Voice, as it will be promptly 2HKOed. Instead, get Machoke in safely against them and threaten them out with Dynamic Punch. With this said, Machoke does make for an excellent pivot into weaker special attacks such as Swellow's Boomburst, Magmortar's Fire Blast, and Rotom's Volt Switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong users of Pursuit such as Choice Band Liepard, Skuntank, and Scyther make for excellent partners, as they can trap the Psychic-types that resist Dynamic Punch and, more importantly, the Ghost-types that are immune to it. Thunder Wave support from the likes of Xatu, Mega Audino, and Miltank similarly works incredibly well with Machoke, not only remedying its poor Speed stat but also synergizing well with Dynamic Punch's confusion. Lastly, Heal Bell users such as Altaria, Musharna, and Mega Audino can not only wake Machoke up when it has used Rest but also heal Machoke of a problematic status ailment without forcing it to put itself to sleep.</p>"

  "Victreebel": {
    "overview": "<p>Victreebel's main niche in NU is being one of the best sun sweepers in the tier. With fantastic wallbreaking capabilities thanks to its very high Special Attack stat and great overall coverage with STAB moves in Solar Beam and Sludge Bomb, it's a staple on almost every sun team. It also has access to Weather Ball, a very strong Fire-type move in the sun that hits Pokemon that its STAB moves can't. What separates Victreebel from other sun sweepers like Exeggutor is that it can outspeed a large portion of Choice Scarf Pokemon under the sun without running a Timid nature, thus allowing it to have more power. However, Victreebel cannot function outside of sun due to its lackluster Speed and defenses, which leave it susceptible to common priority moves such as Bullet Punch, Fake Out, Ice Shard, and Sucker Punch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Giga Drain is usable over Solar Beam to help recover damage from Life Orb recoil and entry hazards. Knock Off and Sucker Punch are also viable options over a coverage move, as Knock Off removes the foe's item and Sucker Punch can provide priority for Victreebel. A mixed set is also an option by running Power Whip to defeat the Pokemon Victreebel lures in like Hariyama. Encore, Growth, and Sunny Day are all options for the fourth slot. Encore can be used to disrupt Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Hariyama that want to stall sun out with Fake Out and KO Victreebel with other priority moves. Growth can allow Victreebel to double both of its attacking stats in the sun, though using this move is not recommended with Victreebel's frailty. Sunny Day can allow Victreebel to set up its own sun or support its teammates with it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Sliggoo and Assault Vest Hariyama and Magmortar can easily take on Victreebel due to their boosted Special Defense. Magmortar and Sliggoo in particular are immune to Sleep Powder due to their abilities, and Hariyama can stall out sun turns with the use of Fake Out as well. Musharna can also stall out Victreebel's sun with the use of Moonlight and Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-type Pokemon such as Skuntank and Garbodor resist both of Victreebel's STAB moves and can OHKO it in return, though they should be wary of Sleep Powder so that they don't become severely crippled.</p> <p><strong>Weather Setters</strong>: Snow Warning users such as Abomasnow and Aurorus can immediately get rid of sun with their ability. Other Pokemon that can set weather such as Prankster Rain Dance Liepard can also stop Victreebel from sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Strong priority moves like Sucker Punch, Fake Out, and Ice Shard from Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Hariyama, and Abomasnow can easily wear down Victreebel.</p>",

      "Chlorophyll Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Solar Beam is Victreebel's preferred Grass-type STAB move, as it has no downside besides the fact that it must be used when sun is active. Sludge Bomb allows Victreebel to hit Fairy- and Fire-types that its other moves can't like Mega Audino, Clefairy, Charizard, and Ninetales. It's also the only move that Victreebel can use outside of sun. Weather Ball is a 100-Base Power Fire-type move when used under the sun that hits Steel- and Poison-types like Ferroseed and Garbodor, which don't care about both of Victreebel's STAB moves. Lastly, Sleep Powder is used to put Pokemon to sleep and allow Victreebel to subsequently launch strong attacks or potentially get sun up again if it has faded. It also allows Victreebel to play around Sucker Punch users like Kangaskhan by shutting them down completely.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb gives a nice boost to Victreebel's overall power and allows it to make full use of its great coverage by switching between its STAB moves and Weather Ball. Chlorophyll is the only viable ability, as Victreebel's only niche in NU is to be a sun sweeper, and if its ability isn't activated, it's borderline useless. A Modest nature gives Victreebel another boost to its power, allowing it to OHKO or 2HKO most foes. Running a Timid nature is an option to outspeed Choice Scarf Scyther and Pyroar, but it comes with a significant decrease in power and doesn't let Victreebel outspeed enough relevant Pokemon, so it's usually not recommended. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Victreebel to dish out as much damage as possible while also outspeeding most Pokemon under the sun.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Setting up Sunny Day before bringing in Victreebel is crucial to its effectiveness as a sun sweeper. Try to utilize the five to eight turns that Sunny Day provides very efficiently with Victreebel, as every turn counts. Try to use Sleep Powder against Pokemon that Victreebel can't OHKO such as Garbodor, Skuntank, and Assault Vest Hariyama and Magmortar, as there's a good chance Victreebel will get KOed back if it can't OHKO the foe due to its generally low defenses.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The most important teammates for Victreebel are Sunny Day setters such as Liepard, Mesprit, and Regirock. Entry hazard setters such as Regirock and Mesprit can provide Stealth Rock, which can break potential Focus Sashes and further increase the chances of pulling off a sweep with Victreebel; these two in particular can also set up Sunny Day. Mesprit in particular can provide a variety of support roles and the ability to threaten common switch-ins to Victreebel such as Hariyama, Weezing, and Garbodor. It also has the ability to bring in Victreebel safely with U-turn or heal it late-game with Healing Wish. Other sun sweepers and Fire-types such as Exeggutor, Shiftry, and Charizard can take advantage of the sun with their abilities or use boosted Fire-type STAB moves to break through Steel-types. Shiftry can easily lure and KO Skuntank with Explosion, one of Victreebel's most reliable checks. Lastly, a fast, non-weather-dependent Pokemon such as Tauros, Archeops, or Choice Scarf Jynx allows the team to regain momentum in case sun fades away.</p>"

  "Golem": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Rhydon sports much better bulk, a better movepool, and the same typing, Golem has a few niches over Rhydon that make it worth using, Golem has Sturdy, Explosion, and Sucker Punch, allowing it to utilize a Custap Berry set. Unlike Rhydon, it isn't reliant on Eviolite for bulk and can make use of its STAB EdgeQuake combination to run a Choice Band set. However, Golem cannot make use of its resistances to Normal- and Flying-type attacks and immunity to Electric-type attacks as well as Rhydon because of its significantly worse bulk and reliance on Sturdy. Its low Speed and Rock / Ground typing also make it vulnerable to the common Water- and Grass-type attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Punch allows Golem to hit Ferroseed for more damage. Alternatively, Golem can run a Rock Polish + Weakness Policy set to make up for its low Speed. Golem can also be used on sun teams to set up Sunny Day and Stealth Rock. Golem can also run a tank set with 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD and an Adamant Nature, but Rhydon is a better tank, as it has much better bulk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Levitating Ghost-types</strong>: Levitating Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Rotom are immune to Explosion and Earthquake and can cripple Choice Band Golem with Will-O-Wisp. The former can also Taunt Custap Berry Golem, preventing it from setting up Stealth Rock, and the latter can cripple it with Trick. However, they dislike Stone Edge and Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Tangela and Torterra don't mind most of Golem's attacks, and they can deal 4x super effective damage to it. The former can put Golem to sleep and the latter resists both of Golem's STAB attacks. However, Tangela is 2HKOed by Choice Band Golem's Stone Edge after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Quagsire and Prinplup can take Golem's attacks and deal 4x super effective damage to it. The former can also remove Stealth Rock with Defog while the latter can burn Golem with Scald. However, they cannot switch into Choice Banded Golem, as they are 2HKOed by Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as lead Archeops can prevent Custap Berry Golem from setting up Stealth Rock, but they must watch out for Stone Edge and Earthquake on both sets.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Spinners such as Claydol and Sandslash can easily switch into Custap Berry Golem's attacks and remove Stealth Rock. However, although Claydol is immune to Earthquake and resists Stone Edge, it cannot switch into Choice Band Golem, as it is 2HKOed by Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Golem's Rock / Ground typing gives it weaknesses to Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Poliwrath, Ground-types such as Piloswine and Rhydon, and Ice-types such as Cryogonal and Aurorus, which can knock it down to Sturdy range and make it easier to KO.

Stone Edge hits Flying-types, such as Rotom-S and Scyther, super effectively. Explosion is a powerful last-resort attack used to severely damage any Pokemon that resists Golem's STAB combination, such as Torterra and Claydol. Sucker Punch allows Golem to pick off weakened foes and threaten Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Rotom.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature combined with an EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe allows Golem to hit as hard as possible and outspeed as much as possible. Sturdy allows Golem to survive at least one hit. Choice Band allows Golem to inflict more damage, but it comes at the cost of being locked into one move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to preserve Sturdy by not switching Golem directly into attacks. Golem should come in mid- to late-game on a free switch to break through physical walls with its STAB combination. Be careful of using Sucker Punch, as Golem is locked into it and Pokemon such as Mismagius can take advantage of it by crippling it with Will-O-Wisp. Explosion should be used sparingly, as Golem may be needed later in the match, and Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Rotom can switch in and take no damage. Explosion should be used to break through Pokemon that resist Stone Edge and Earthquake, such as Claydol and Torterra. Golem should use Sucker Punch to threaten fast and frail Pokemon, such as Jynx, which threatens to KO Golem with Ice Beam, but it must be wary of Lovely Kiss.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Volt Switch and U-turn users, such as Rotom and Liepard, allow Golem to switch in while keeping Sturdy intact. Spinners such as Cryogonal and Kabutops can remove entry hazards for Golem. Pokemon that appreciate Golem's wallbreaking ability, such as Scyther and Tauros, make for good partners. Ice-types such as Piloswine and Jynx can take care of Torterra and Claydol, which resist or are immune to both of Golem's STAB attacks, while they appreciate Golem's wallbreaking. Pokemon that appreciate a teammate that can take Electric-type attacks, such as Scyther and Pelipper, are good partners. In addition to this, Pelipper can provide Defog support for Golem.</p>"

      "Custap Berry": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock breaks Focus Sashes and Sturdy users, such as Crustle, Aurorus, and Archeops. Earthquake hits Steel-, Fire-, and Electric-types such as Klinklang, Pyroar, and Lanturn super effectively. Rock Blast completes Golem's STAB coverage and can hit through Substitute, Sturdy, and Focus Sash. Stone Edge can be used over Rock Blast to deal more consistent damage. Explosion can deal massive damage to the foe and provides momentum for the team. Sucker Punch has priority and can allow Golem to pick off weakened Pokemon, but it can be very risky to use.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This EV spread with an Adamant nature ensures that Golem hits as hard as possible. Golem could also run a Jolly nature to outspeed threats such as Adamant Mawile and Jolly Rhydon. Sturdy almost always guarantees that Golem can set up Stealth Rock. Custap Berry allows Golem to more first when Sturdy has activated.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Golem on a free switch and proceed to set up Stealth Rock, or use it as a lead if it has a good matchup. Use Explosion or Sucker Punch once Sturdy has activated. Be wary of Taunt users, as they prevent Golem from setting up Stealth Rock. Use Explosion on spinners and Defoggers such as Claydol and Mantine in order to prevent them from removing Stealth Rock. Be wary of using Sucker Punch, as Pokemon such as Mismagius can take advantage of Golem by crippling it with Will-O-Wisp. Sturdy is important to make use of Custap Berry and to reliably set up Stealth Rock, so keep it intact as much as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits well on offensive teams because of its ability to reliably set up Stealth Rock thanks to Sturdy and then do significant damage thanks to Custap Berry. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Scyther and Rotom allow Golem to switch in freely and keep Sturdy intact. Spinners such as Claydol and Kabutops help to keep Stealth Rock off Golem's side of the field in order to keep Sturdy intact. Wallbreakers such as Electivire and Magmortar appreciate entry hazard support in order to break through opposing Sturdy users and Focus Sashes. Spikes from Pokemon such as Cacturne and Roselia combined with Stealth Rock support can wear down the opposing team more easily. Golem also has nice synergy with these Pokemon, as Golem can take Fire- and Flying-type attacks aimed at Cacturne and Roselia, while Cacturne and Roselia can take take Water- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Golem. Spinblockers such as Mismagius and Gourgeist-XL help keep Stealth Rock on the field. Defiant users such as Pawniard and Primeape can switch into Defog and receive a +2 Attack boost.</p>"

  "Muk": {
    "overview": "<p>Muk is a Pokemon that struggles to find itself a place in the NU metagame. Being a Poison-type with a low Defense stat leads to being outclassed by Garbodor and Weezing, both of which provide utility beyond their walling ability. Though Muk has higher Special Defense than the two, letting it more effectively wall the likes of Lilligant and Mega Audino, Skuntank is generally better at walling said threats due to its less exploitable typing and access to Pursuit. In addition to being outclassed defensively, Muk still faces competition from the multitude of other wallbreakers in the tier, all of which may either provide better team synergy or have better overall coverage. These factors combined make Muk very hard to justify using on a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Assault Vest can be used to allow Muk to switch between any of its coverage moves without having to worry about being locked into something, but it doesn't pack as much of a punch as the usual set. Curse is an option if you want Muk to become a wincon due to its nice overall bulk, but this loses out on Muk's fantastic coverage options. Going mixed with Giga Drain and Fire Blast to hit the likes of Rhydon and Steelix is also an option, but it's generally less effective due to the lack of power Choice Band provides. Lastly, Memento can be used in the last slot as an effort to help a teammate setup with ease, but Muk usually has a hard time using it due to its low Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Rhydon, Steelix, and Golurk can easily come in on Muk and set up Stealth Rock or KO it with a STAB Ground-type attack. Rhydon for one can take advantage of Muk by setting up a Swords Dance or Rock Polish. However, Rhydon and Steelix must be wary of Focus Punch, and Golurk must be wary of Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Mesprit, Xatu, and Jynx can easily KO Muk with a STAB Psyshock, though they can't really switch into any of Muk's Choice Band-boosted attacks.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Steelix and Klinklang are immune to Muk's main STAB move, Gunk Shot, so Muk may have to rely on predicting around them with Focus Punch or Fire Punch. Klinklang can also get a free opportunity to set up for a potential sweep if Muk is locked into the wrong move.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: With Muk's lackluster physical defenses, strong physical attackers such as Tauros, Archeops, and Kangaskhan don't have a hard time wearing it down.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Other Poison-types such as Garbodor and Weezing can take any attack Muk throws at them besides an Explosion and get a free turn to setup Toxic Spikes or spread status. Garbodor can set up layers of Spikes while also wearing Muk down easily with Rocky Helmet and Aftermath recoil, while Weezing can burn it with Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gunk Shot is Muk's main STAB move, dealing a massive amount of damage when boosted by a Choice Band. Shadow Sneak's priority makes up for Muk's lackluster Speed stat and lets it pick off frail Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Jynx and Rotom. Focus Punch can be used to land a heavy hit on Rock- and Steel-types such as Rhydon and Steelix that come in and try to wall Muk. Note that if Focus Punch fails on the first turn, Muk can still change moves, even with a Choice Band. Ice Punch is used to hit Ground- and Flying-types such as Claydol, Rhydon, and Archeops for super effective damage. Fire Punch is an option over Focus Punch, but Muk will then lose the ability to hit Rock-types for super effective damage. Explosion can be used over Ice Punch, just as a last ditch effort to break a wall down for Muk's teammates, notably striking opposing Poison-types such as Garbodor and Weezing.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Band increases Muk's wallbreaking prowess with an impressive boost to its overall power. Poison Touch is the preferred ability that gives Muk a 30% chance to poison an opponent with a contact move, whereas Sticky Hold allows Muk to become a nice Knock Off or Trick absorber. Adamant is the preferred nature, as it further increases Muk's power. 36 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Gourgeist-XL, and investing the rest in HP and Attack means it can hit as hard as possible while still having some defensive presence.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to use Muk to pivot into certain special attacking threats such as Lilligant, Shiftry, and Mega Audino, so that it can start launching strong attacks at anything that's in or tries to come in. Being Choiced with any Pokemon may take some prediction, so always try to deal a decent amount of damage to something that tries to switch-in whether Muk is using a STAB move or one of its coverage moves. Only use Focus Punch if you're expecting a switch to a Steel- or Rock-type, as losing a turn is crucial to Muk's overall effectiveness, if it fails. If using a Sticky Hold set, try to switch Muk into a predicted weak Knock Off from a passive user or Trick, as Muk is a nice absorber of both.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Late game cleaners and sweepers such as Shiftry and Swellow make for good teammates, as they appreciate Muk's wallbreaking capabilities. Dark- and Water-types such as Shiftry, Skuntank, and Samurott make for good teammates as well since they help cover the Psychic- and Ground-type weaknesses that Muk has. Fighting- and Fire-types such as Hariyama and Magmortar are also great, as they can take out Steel-types such as Steelix and Klinklang so that Muk doesn't have to rely on Focus Punch to hit them. Rotom and Mismagius make for excellent teammates to handle strong physical attackers thanks to Will-O-Wisp, cover Muk's Ground-type weakness with Levitate, and deal with bulky Psychic-types that trouble Muk, such as Mesprit and Musharna. Clerics with Heal Bell such as Mega Audino and Lanturn are also useful to Muk, as they can heal a potential burn.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Haunter's solid Speed tier allows it to outspeed a good portion of NU, including common Pokemon like Lilligant, Mesprit, and Rotom. Furthermore, simply between its dual STAB types Haunter has excellent neutral coverage, with a strong secondary STAB type that allows it to break through Pokemon that many Ghosts have trouble with, such as Pyroar and Mega Audino. This frees up Haunter's last two moveslots, allowing it to run neat support moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Destiny Bond, and Reflect Type. Unfortunately, Haunter has terrible bulk, meaning it can sometimes struggle to make proper use of these moves. With low stats in both HP and defenses, Haunter can only afford to take resisted attacks that have low Base Power or are uninvested. However, even with its horrific bulk, Levitate gives Haunter an impressive third immunity and helps its matchup versus offense, as it is not affected by Spikes. On the downside, Levitate also means Haunter cannot absorb Toxic Spikes, potentially leaving your team at a disadvantage versus teams employing them. Haunter faces competition from Ghost-types such as Rotom and Mismagius, the former of which acts as a better pivot due to STAB Volt Switch and better defenses, and the latter of which has access to Nasty Plot and a higher Speed tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Substitute + Disable set is plausible, as Disable grants Haunter more opportunities to get up a Substitute and allows it to beat certain Pokemon like Hariyama and Throh that it otherwise could not. This is set is often outdone by the all-out attacking set, though, as Haunter loses a huge amount of utility by dropping Will-O-Wisp and Destiny Bond or Reflect Type. Eviolite is an option to give Haunter more bulk and allows it to take better advantage of its resistances to decently common attacking types such as Bug, Poison, and Grass. It also works particularly well with Reflect Type, making Haunter even more difficult to Pursuit trap. Haunter can make good use of coverage moves such as Energy Ball and Thunderbolt, hitting Pokemon such as Rhydon and Mantine, if an all-out-attacking set suits your team better. Aside from these colorful coverage moves, Haunter can also make decent use of Taunt, although it is typically outclassed by Mismagius, which sports a higher Speed stat and better defenses.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Haunter is incredibly frail, and while base 95 Speed is solid, it does leave it vulnerable to a plethora of faster Pokemon that have no problem OHKOing Haunter such as Pyroar, Swellow, and Archeops. Pyroar and Swellow can also switch into Shadow Ball, but both take heavy damage from Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Due to its frailty, Haunter can often be revenge killed by strong priority attacks such as Samurott's Aqua Jet and Shiftry's and Skuntank's Sucker Punch. Haunter's weakness to Sucker Punch can be mitigated by Will-O-Wisp and Destiny Bond, though.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Pursuit trappers can put a great amount of stress on Haunter, as every time it gets a KO, it is at risk of being trapped. Reflect Type and Will-O-Wisp can help alleviate this problem, but faster trappers such as Liepard and Choice Band Scyther are still threatening. Skuntank in particular should be noted for its ability to switch into both of Haunter's STAB moves with impunity and trap it.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off is everywhere, and Haunter must be incredibly careful to avoid it. Even a non-STAB Knock Off coming from a very weak Pokemon such as Clefairy will do decent damage and cripple Haunter, so be wary of Pokemon that could be carrying it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Very specially bulky Pokemon like Assault Vest Hariyama and Magmortar are threatening to Haunter, as they can pretty easily sponge Sludge Bomb and OHKO it in return.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sludge Bomb is Haunter's strongest attack and allows it to break through most Pokemon that resist Shadow Ball such as Mega Audino and Pyroar. Sludge Bomb is also helpful for punishing Pokemon that like to switch into Will-O-Wisp such as Assault Vest Magmortar, as it does solid damage and can poison these Pokemon, wearing them down quickly throughout a battle. Shadow Ball provides good coverage with Sludge Bomb and hits Psychic-types, such as Mesprit and Musharna, as well as slower Ghost-types, such as Rotom and Golurk. Hex is an option over Shadow Ball, as it has terrific synergy with Will-O-Wisp and has the potential to hit much harder. Shadow Ball is usually preferred, though, as it is far more spammable and provides more consistent damage output. Will-O-Wisp deters Dark-type Pokemon from using Sucker Punch and also helps patch up Haunter's horrid Defense stat. Will-O-Wisp also works fantastically with Hex and allows Haunter to burn Pokemon that can take both Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb like Skuntank. Destiny Bond can be useful in a pinch, as with high Speed and pitiful defenses, Haunter can usually take another Pokemon down with it as it faints. Reflect Type is an alternative that provides further insurance against Pursuit trappers, Skuntank being the main target.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment allows Haunter to hit as hard and fast as possible. A Timid nature is used over Modest to allow Haunter to outspeed base 91s an below such as Lilligant, Rotom, and Vivillon as well as Speed tie opposing base 95s like Jynx and Primeape. Life Orb is the item of choice, as it gives Haunter a large power boost and the freedom to switch moves and take full advantage of its coverage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Haunter is very frail, so avoid switching it into almost any attacks because even resisted hits will do a lot. Conversely, Haunter has very few guaranteed switch-ins and excels in the early- and mid-game, where it can break down walls for teammates to sweep later. Between its terrific dual STAB types and access to Taunt, Haunter also works as a decent stallbreaker. Opponents will often attempt to Pursuit trap Haunter with the likes of Skuntank, so using Reflect Type on a predicted Pursuit allows Haunter to resist the hit and avoid getting trapped. Will-O-Wisp and Destiny Bond are helpful for Sucker Punch mind games versus Pokemon like Shiftry and Skuntank, as Haunter can punish the opponent for mispredicting.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Late-game cleaners such as Swords Dance Samurott, Choice Specs Swellow, and Klinklang appreciate Haunter's ability to wallbreak mid-game. Haunter appreciates entry hazards to allow it to do as much damage as possible, so Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock or Spikes such as Omastar, Ferroseed, and Garbodor are solid teammates. Similarly, Haunter's Ghost typing allows it to block Rapid Spin, so other Pokemon that appreciate hazards being kept up such as Floatzel, Pyroar, and Tauros make for good partners. Specifically, Shiftry is a solid partner for Haunter, as Haunter can break through Mega Audino, which would otherwise give Shiftry trouble, as well as cripple Pursuit trappers with Will-O-Wisp, providing Shiftry an opportunity to set up.</p>"
      },
      "SubSplit": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball is a decently strong STAB move that is Haunter's most spammable attack, and Sludge Bomb provides great coverage alongside it. Substitute eases prediction, helps Haunter avoid getting revenge killed by faster threats, and allows it to avoid status. Pain Split allows Haunter to stay healthy throughout a match, has solid synergy with Life Orb and Substitute, and can help Haunter break through special sponges like Assault Vest Hariyama and Malamar more easily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment allows Haunter to hit as hard and fast as possible. Along with this, a Timid nature lets it outpace common threats such as Rotom, Vivillon, and Lilligant. Life Orb is used to increase Haunter damage output significantly, and it has excellent synergy with Pain Split. Life Orb also synergizes well with the set, as the passive damage is mitigated by Pain Split's recovery, and the Life Orb recoil actually makes Pain Split more effective in wearing down targets. This makes the recoil an advantage instead of a disadvantage, as Haunter's frailness means it can't really tank hits anyway.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When low on HP from the combination of Life Orb and Substitute, use Pain Split. Otherwise, Haunter is a prolific wallbreaker, so it does very well in the early- and mid-game, where it can break through opposing teams for other Pokemon to sweep. Substitute can be used to aid Haunter in winning Sucker Punch mind games, as well as avoid getting Pursuit trapped. In conjunction with Pain Split, it also allows Haunter to have an easier time breaking down Pokemon such as Hariyama and Malamar, which would otherwise have no trouble sponging hits from it. Avoid switching Haunter in on attacks unless the foe is locked into a move it's immune to such as Primeape's Close Combat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Haunter struggles with Pokemon carrying Pursuit such as Skuntank and Liepard, so Pokemon that can handle those two such as Primeape, Hariyama, and Mawile are great partners. While Haunter's Ghost typing leaves it vulnerable to Pursuit, it also lets it act as a spinblocker in a pinch, so Pokemon that also appreciate entry hazards like Samurott, Archeops, and Kangaskhan are viable partners. Pokemon like Magmortar and Pyroar that appreciate Haunter's ability to wear down special tanks like Hariyama and Lanturn make for solid partners. Choice Scarf Primeape is a strong partner in particular for this set, as many of its checks and counters such as Musharna, Mesprit, Garbodor, and Weezing are broken down by Haunter. In return, Primeape can threaten Dark-types such as Skuntank and Liepard that prey on Haunter. Shiftry appreciates Haunter's ability to break down walls, and, in return, it can lure out Skuntank and OHKO it with Explosion, opening the opposing team up for Haunter.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sludge Bomb is a powerful STAB move and provides solid neutral coverage alongside Shadow Ball, and Shadow Ball is Haunter's most spammable move. Trick allows Haunter to cripple Pokemon that give it trouble such as Malamar, Lanturn, and Skuntank. Destiny Bond lets Haunter take another Pokemon down with it as it faints and is especially useful on this set because Haunter's Speed reaches absurd levels when it's holding a Choice Scarf. Energy Ball is a decent option over Trick or Destiny Bond, as it allows Haunter to better revenge kill Adamant +2 Speed Barbaracle and +2 Speed Rhydon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment allows Haunter to hit as hard and fast as possible. A Timid nature lets Haunter get the jump on base 91 and below Choice Scarf users, such as Rotom and Mesprit, as well as outspeed Vivillon and Lilligant after one Quiver Dance. Choice Scarf is the selected item, as it mitigates Haunter's trouble with faster Pokemon that can threaten it out and changes it from an early- or mid-game breaker to a late-game cleaner.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Haunter should be used predominately as a revenge killer rather than a wallbreaker. Haunter excels in the late-game as a cleaner once the opposing team has been weakened. Avoid switching Haunter into attacks, as its frailty means even strong resisted hits will do a lot. Another thing to beware of is mindlessly clicking Destiny Bond, as if the foe doesn't take Haunter out on that turn, it can lead to a big loss in momentum. Once Haunter no longer needs the Speed that comes with holding the Choice Scarf, Tricking it away allows Haunter to take advantage of its coverage to its fullest extent and potentially cripple an opposing wall such as Malamar in the process, clearing the way for itself and its teammates. Scout for Pursuit trappers switching into Haunter by making aggressive double switches to a teammate that threatens said Pursuit trappers, as once Haunter locks itself into either of its STAB moves, they can trap it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Haunter is particularly prone to getting Pursuit trapped, so Pokemon that can combat Skuntank and Liepard such as Rhydon, Steelix, and Hariyama make for solid partners. In particular, Rhydon and Barbaracle pair well with Haunter, as both can switch in on Pursuit Skuntank and set up a Rock Polish or Shell Smash versus it. Shiftry is also an excellent partner for Haunter, as it appreciates Haunter's ability to break down bulkier Pokemon such as Mega Audino and can even lure in Skuntank and OHKO it with Explosion. Haunter fits well on many hyper offensive builds due to its ability to spinblock and blazing Speed while holding a Choice Scarf, so entry hazards leads such as Omastar and Pinsir work well. Haunter also appreciates Pokemon that can break through walls early- or mid-game for it to clean up later, so Pokemon that provide immediate wallbreaking power like Choice Band Primeape, all-out attacking Samurott, and Floatzel are good partners. Haunter can also Trick Pokemon its Choice Scarf to leave them locked into a move that allows a teammate to set up.</p>"

  "Marowak": {
    "overview": "<p>When holding its signature item, Thick Club, Marowak gains a titanic Attack stat, which, along with its good coverage, allows it to 2HKO almost every Pokemon in the NU metagame. Unfortunately, Marowak suffers from various flaws that make it a very mediocre Pokemon. Chief among this is the competition from other Ground-types, as Marowak is very hard to justify using over the likes of Rhydon, Golurk, Torterra, and Piloswine, all of which possess better bulk and typings, allowing them to check far more of the metagame. In addition, Marowak is cripplingly slow, leaving it easily revenge killed, which isn't helped by its common weaknesses to Grass-, Water-, and Ice-type moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Facade is an option so that Marowak isn't useless if it's burned. Thunder Punch is more accurate than Stone Edge, but it should never be used over Double-Edge.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types and Levitate Users</strong>: Flying-types and Levitate users can come in on Marowak's STAB move and threaten it out or at least make it waste a crucial Trick Room or Tailwind turn; however, most of them are subsequently KOed by Double-Edge or Knock Off. Weezing in particular is one of the better checks to Marowak, as it survives even a +2 Double-Edge, but it is worn down very quickly.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water- and Grass-types</strong>: Although most bulky Water- and Grass-types are 2HKOed by Marowak, a lot of them can avoid the OHKO and KO Marowak back with their super effective STAB moves. Tangela and Gourgeist-XL in particular are bothersome; however, Tangela has a high chance to be 2HKOed by Double-Edge after taking Stealth Rock damage if its Eviolite has been removed, and Gourgeist-XL is OHKOed by a +2 Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Because of Marowak's low Speed, it is easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Archeops, Jynx, and Lilligant. However, Marowak's acceptable bulk allows it to survive most neutral hits, and it can turn the tide against faster Pokemon with the speed control that it's often paired with.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Even if Marowak is under Trick Room or Tailwind, if weakened, it can be revenge killed by priority; Aqua Jet, Ice Shard, and Fake Out are especially deadly for it, as the former two hit Marowak super effectively and the latter makes Marowak waste a Trick Room or Tailwind turn. It's important to note that Marowak can avoid Sucker Punch with Substitute and that its decent bulk allows it to tank most priority if it isn't weakened.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bone Crusher (Wallbreaker)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bonemerang allows Marowak to OHKO Sturdy and Focus Sash users; however, if its imperfect accuracy is unappealing, Earthquake can be chosen instead. Double-Edge has no recoil thanks to Rock Head and hits Grass- and Flying-types and Weezing neutrally. Stone Edge maims Flying-types such as Archeops and Pelipper in addition to these Pokemon, but it is weaker and less reliable than Double-Edge. Swords Dance lets Marowak beat walls with recovery and makes it an even more fearsome wallbreaker, but Marowak's low Speed stat makes it fairly hard to use, and a lot of times just attacking can be more useful. Substitute eases prediction, punishes Protect users, avoids Sucker Punch and status, and keeps Marowak from being revenge killed by priority users or once Trick Room or Tailwind turns are over. Knock Off nails the Gourgeist formes and Levitating Ghost-types, which otherwise wall Marowak. Stealth Rock can be used if it can't be fitted on anything else on the team. Fire Punch can be used in the third slot to nail Ferroseed and deal more damage to other Grass-types and Scyther.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Thick Club doubles Marowak's Attack, which makes it insanely powerful. Rock Head prevents recoil damage from Double-Edge; however, Battle Armor is Marowak's only useful ability if it opts to run Stone Edge. The spread makes Marowak as fast and as powerful as possible, outspeeding the likes of maximum Speed Adamant Rhydon and Lanturn. A Jolly nature is also an option to outspeed Jolly Rhydon and Mawile. If you're using Marowak on a full Trick Room team, the Speed EVs should be moved to HP, and a Brave nature and a 0 Speed IV should be used to outspeed as many foes as possible under Trick Room.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Send in Marowak against Pokemon that can't do too much to it, such as physical Skuntank, Garbodor, and defensive Mawile, preferably when Trick Room or Tailwind is up; however, Marowak can certainly work without them as a wallbreaker to weaken its teammates' and its own checks. It can also be brought in through U-turn or Volt Switch support from the likes of defensive Mesprit, taking advantage of its teammates' switch-ins. Bonemerang is Marowak's most powerful move and thus the one Marowak will most often use, putting at least a dent on most Pokemon in the tier; however, when appropriate, Marowak can nail a switch-in such as Gourgeist-XL or Scyther with its coverage moves or even set up Swords Dance or Substitute. If necessary, Marowak can take a hit at full health thanks to its decent bulk and KO the opposing Pokemon. Late-game, once its checks are weakened and dangerous priority users are gone, Marowak can sweep with the speed control typically paired with it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>When using Marowak, you should usually pair it up with some form of speed control. Trick Room is probably the best option, as it lasts several turns, supports the entire team, and allows Marowak to outspeed even Choice Scarf users. Mega Audino, Audino, Musharna, Mesprit, Carbink, and Exeggutor are all good setters; the former three also provide Healing Wish support, Mesprit and Carbink can set up Stealth Rock, and Exeggutor is a nice offensive partner. Sticky Web lets Marowak outspeed a fair number of grounded foes that would outspeed it otherwise; however, because of Marowak's low Speed stat, it will only outspeed up to fully invested base 90s with the same nature. Tailwind support from the likes of Shiftry, Scyther, and Mantine doubles Marowak's Speed, supports the entire team instead of just Marowak, and doesn't require Marowak to directly switch in, unlike Combusken support, but it doesn't last many turns, and most of the time, it involves sacrificing the Tailwind setter. Teammates with access to Thunder Wave, such as defensive Mesprit and Lanturn, can also provide speed control. Fire-, Ice-, Poison-, and Flying-types, such as Pyroar, Aurorus, Garbodor, and Swellow, maim the Grass-types that check Marowak, such as Tangela and the Gourgeist formes. Checks to Water-types, specifically Aqua Jet users, are also welcome partners, as they can revenge kill Marowak regardless of speed control; Pokemon such as Exeggutor and Vileplume fit well on the Trick Room teams Marowak most often finds itself in, while the likes of Lilligant and Zebstrika threaten the faster teams that Marowak can struggle against without speed control. Other wallbreakers, such as Aurorus and Magmortar, can also take advantage of the speed control that is often paired with Marowak. Pokemon such as Samurott and Klinklang share a lot of switch-ins with Marowak and can sweep after Marowak almost inevitably breaks through them.</p>"

  "Hitmonchan": {
    "overview": "<p>High Attack combined with a decent Speed stat, powerful STAB moves, and a respectable Special Defense stat makes Hitmonchan a solid offensive threat. Iron Fist powers up most almost all of Hitmonchan's common moves, particularly STAB Mach Punch, which hits most offensive Pokemon really hard. Another big thing that sets Hitmonchan apart from other Fighting-types in the tier is Rapid Spin, letting it provide great support to its team. Hitmonchan struggles with Ghost-types like Rotom and Gourgeist-XL, though, as it doesn't learn Knock Off to hit them super effectively, having to rely on Ice Punch or Stone Edge to hit them, while pretty much all of them outspeed Hitmonchan and can get a quick Will-O-Wisp off against it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Punch and Earthquake can be used to hit different checks to Hitmonchan, although Earthquake has very specific Pokemon it aims to hit and leaves Hitmonchan completely countered by Ghost-types, as the relevant ones have access to Levitate. Foresight can be used over either Mach Punch or Ice Punch to catch Ghost-types on the switch in order to spin away entry hazards on them or hit them hard with Drain Punch. A Lum Berry works well with the move, as most Ghost-types will try to burn Hitmonchan as they get identified with Foresight, letting Hitmonchan OHKO both Mismagius and offensive Rotom. Fist Plate is an option to boost the power of Hitmonchan's Fighting-type moves without having to suffer Life Orb recoil, but Life Orb and Assault Vest have more consistent uses.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Hitmonchan doesn't have a solid way to touch Ghost-types, and it risks getting spinblocked by them and getting crippled by Will-O-Wisp, which all of the relevant Ghost-types tend to run.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Mesprit, Musharna, and Grumpig can easily take multiple hits from Hitmonchan and proceed to either set up on it or KO it with a STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Mega Audino and Clefairy can easily switch into Hitmonchan and can set up on it or pass Wish to teammates.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Garbodor and Weezing take very little damage from anything Hitmonchan throws at them, giving them a free turn to set up Toxic Spikes. Weezing can also cut Hitmonchan's attack with Will-O-Wisp. Garbodor also punishes Rapid Spin with Rocky Helmet and Aftermath damage.</p> <p><strong>Fast Flying-types</strong>: Charizard and Scyther, while both can be lured by Stone Edge, are normally pretty safe switch-ins to Hitmonchan as long as Stealth Rock is not on the field. They can then proceed to OHKO Hitmonchan with Acrobatics or Aerial Ace, respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Drain Punch is a great reliable STAB move, getting boosted by Iron Fist and recovering HP that Hitmonchan might've lost when switching in. Close Combat can be used over Drain Punch, as it offers more damage, being able to OHKO Skuntank and Ferroseed, but it doesn't recover HP and lowers both of Hitmonchan's defensive stats. Mach Punch is a great STAB priority move that can pick off weakened foes. Ice Punch and Stone Edge both provide solid coverage on lots of Pokemon that are normally able to switch in on Drain Punch, such as Mantine, Charizard, and Scyther. Stone Edge also hits Rotom and Mismagius for more damage than Ice Punch. Rapid Spin is what sets Hitmonchan apart from other Fighting-types in the tier, as it gets lots of opportunities to spin away entry hazards throughout the match.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Hitmonchan to hit as hard as possible, while Drain Punch, Ice Punch, and Mach Punch are boosted further by Iron Fist. An Adamant nature is preferred over Jolly, as the important Pokemon Hitmonchan gets to outspeed with Jolly are limited to Shiftry and Kabutops, which faint to a Mach Punch anyway. Life Orb offers more damage on all of Hitmonchan's attacks at the cost of 10% of Hitmonchan's HP every time it uses one.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hitmonchan should be used to revenge kill powerful attackers like Barbaracle and Shiftry with Mach Punch. When predicting a switch to a defensive check that Hitmonchan can hit super effectively with a coverage move, the appropriate move can be used, but Rapid Spin should be prioritized most of the time depending on the situation. If there are no entry hazards on the field to spin away and there is a hard counter to Hitmonchan such as Weezing or Mesprit on the opposing team, there is no real reason to stay in and attack it for a pathetic amount of damage, so you're better off double switching in that scenario to keep up momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hitmonchan is checked by most Psychic-types and Ghost-types such as Mesprit, Musharna, Mismagius, and Rotom, which makes Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank and Liepard great partners. In return, Hitmonchan is able to break past the likes of Steelix and Rhydon, both which easily switch into Skuntank and Liepard. Steelix is a good partner due to its ability to check Mega Audino and other Psychic-types, while providing Stealth Rock support. Pairing these two together comes at the cost of being vulnerable to Rotom, so make sure to pair the two with a solid check such as Magmortar, Pyroar, or Lanturn. Charizard, Scyther, and Archeops are good teammates for Hitmonchan too, as all of them greatly benefit from Hitmonchan's ability to spin away entry hazards and beat Steel- and Rock-types. Ice-types also benefit from Hitmonchan's hazard control, as well as it dealing with Steel-types and having good matchups versus most of the Fire-types in the tier.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bulk Up allows Hitmonchan to break through its bulkier checks like Vileplume much more easily than with standard Life Orb sets. Drain Punch is used in combination with the Iron Fist boost in order to gain back HP after taking hits to set up. Close Combat is an option to hit a lot harder but also lowers defenses and causes Hitmonchan to be worn down a lot more easily. It allows Hitmonchan to also net KOs on Rhydon and Steelix when running a Jolly nature. Mach Punch is also boosted by Iron Fist and gives Hitmonchan a priority attack to hit faster threats like Tauros and Archeops. Ice Punch is the coverage of choice, as it hits common Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Vileplume and Xatu. Iron Fist-boosted Ice Punch also hits Fighting-resistant Pokemon a lot harder than coverage moves like Knock Off that are used by other Bulk Up sweepers like Gurdurr.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs are to maximize attacking capabilities, with maximum Speed investment used to outspeed Pokemon like Claydol, Pursuit Skuntank, and neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon like Samurott and Ludicolo. It also allows Hitmonchan to not have to rely on Mach Punch to revenge kill certain Pokemon, something that similar attackers like Gurdurr are forced to do. An Adamant nature can be used to guarantee the OHKO on threats like Vileplume and Archeops with Ice Punch and Mach Punch, respectively, after Stealth Rock. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Pokemon that aim to outpace Adamant Hitmonchan such as Xatu, which Hitmonchan can then proceed to OHKO with Ice Punch after a boost. Iron Fist gives a boost to all the punch-based attacks on the set. Life Orb is used to boost all the attacks on the set, and Drain Punch helps mitigate its recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hitmonchan is able to force Pokemon like Steelix and Shiftry out quite easily, so it's able to set up Bulk Ups on them in order to break through whatever counter the opponent switches in, like Vileplume or Xatu. Hitmonchan is also able to bluff the Rapid Spin set quite often, so setting up on obvious switches to spinblockers like Gourgeist takes advantage of this well. It can also be played as a revenge killer early in the game, as Iron Fist-boosted Mach Punch is a great tool to revenge kill threats like Tauros and Pyroar. It's also smart to know what the checks to Hitmonchan are and strategically chip them throughout the game to get them in range of Hitmonchan's Mach Punch. This includes Pokemon like Garbodor and Clefairy that need to be chipped earlier in the game, as they are hard stops to this Hitmonchan set.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As most of Hitmonchan's checks are Psychic- and Ghost-types like Mesprit, Xatu, and Mismagius, it's smart to pair it with a Pursuit trapper like Liepard or Skuntank. Pairing Hitmonchan with Volt Switch and U-turn users like Rotom and Mesprit allows you to chip at the opposing team in order to get them in range of Hitmonchan's attacks as well as getting it in safely. Choice Band Scyther also makes for a great partner, as it provides Pursuit support and is able to break down physical walls like Garbodor and Clefairy, while Hitmonchan switches in on Steel- and Rock-types through U-turn and forces them out. Rhydon and Steelix make for great partners, as they are able to check the numerous physical attackers like Scyther and Charizard that plague Hitmonchan prior to setting up; they also provide Stealth Rock for Hitmonchan to guarantee KOs on Pokemon like Vileplume and Archeops.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Drain Punch is a STAB move boosted by Iron Fist that provides Hitmonchan with semi-consistent recovery. Mach Punch is a strong priority move that helps support Hitmonchan's poor Speed by letting it revenge kill offensive threats such as Tauros and Shiftry. Ice Punch provides neutral coverage on Pokemon that resist Hitmonchan's STAB attacks and allows Hitmonchan to deter Ghost-types from blocking Rapid Spin. Another option is Stone Edge, which, in addition to dealing more damage to Ghost-types, hits several Flying-types that are neutral to Ice Punch super effectively, such as Charizard, Mantine, and Pelipper. It's also a non-contact move and therefore preserves Hitmonchan from Rocky Helmet and Aftermath damage, although it loses coverage against Grass-types such as Vileplume and is less reliable overall due to its low accuracy. Rapid Spin constitutes much of Hitmonchan's value in NU, as its favorable matchup against many entry hazard setters gives it many opportunities to spin throughout the course of a battle.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Iron Fist raises the Base Power of Hitmonchan's punch-based attacks. 48 EVs in Speed allow Hitmonchan to outpace Adamant Aggron; however, depending on how much bulk you desire or what threats you believe are worth outspeeding, the amount of Speed is highly customizable. Examples include running 96 EVs to Speed creep Adamant Torterra and Trevenant and 208 EVs to do the same for neutral-natured Samurott and Ludicolo. An Adamant nature along with maximum Attack investment gives Hitmonchan the greatest ability to pressure opposing teams, and the remaining EVs are dumped into HP to allow Hitmonchan to sponge hits as well as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With Assault Vest equipped and some HP investment, Hitmonchan can pivot into numerous special attackers in the tier, such as Magmortar and Swellow. Rapid Spin will often be the move of choice when entry hazards are up, but be wary of opposing spinblockers such as Rotom and Mismagius, which may require an Ice Punch or a double switch to a Pursuit trapper to take care of, as well as of chip damage from Rocky Helmet users such as Garbodor and Xatu. Although Hitmonchan's power is significantly decreased due to a lack of a power-boosting item, it is still adept at revenge killing weakened and frail attackers such as Pyroar and Jynx.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As is the case with any spinner, but especially with a Fighting-type one, Pursuit support from the likes of Skuntank and Liepard is key for dealing with Ghost-type spinblockers such as Rotom and Psychic-type threats such as Mesprit and Xatu. Psychic-types such as the aforementioned Mesprit and Xatu can remove bothersome Poison-types such as Garbodor and Weezing which largely wall Hitmonchan and can even chip away at its health with Rocky Helmet, punishing it for spinning away entry hazards. Scyther, Charizard, and other Flying-types greatly benefit from Hitmonchan's ability to keep Stealth Rock off the field and pressure the Rock- and Steel-types that can easily thwart their sweeps. Due to the Special Defense boost from Assault Vest, Hitmonchan pairs well with frailer attackers such as Vivillon and Samurott which are forced out by strong special attackers like Swellow, Lilligant, and Aurorus.</p>"

  "Rhydon": {
    "overview": "<p>Rhydon is one of NU's most potent physical attackers thanks to its monstrous Attack stat complemented by excellent dual STAB types, making Rhydon difficult to switch into. In addition, Rhydon has great overall bulk due to its high HP stat and good defenses when holding Eviolite, as well as access to both Rock Polish and Swords Dance, allowing it to sweep through fast offensive teams or break through some of the bulkiest Pokemon with ease. Though Rhydon does come with substantial strengths, it has some notable weaknesses that hold it back. Low initial Speed means that some defensive Pokemon are able to outspeed Rhydon even when it is fully invested in Speed. While Ground / Rock is great offensively, it comes with some crippling weaknesses, including a 4x weakness to Water- and Grass-type attacks, as well as a weakness to common Fighting-type attacks. Rhydon is also prone to being worn down by repeated attacks, status ailments, and entry hazards due to its lack of passive recovery.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragon Tail is an option over Roar to phaze setup sweepers while dealing damage, but it is generally less reliable because it cannot phaze Substitute users and has a chance to miss. Choice Band is an option to make Rhydon's attacks hit very hard, but the loss of Eviolite makes Rhydon significantly less bulky, and Rhydon is outclassed by Golem in this role. Rock Head or Reckless Double-Edge may sound appealing at first, but it doesn't provide any coverage that Megahorn already doesn't provide. Rest plus Sleep Talk is Rhydon's only form of recovery, but generally this wastes a lot of Rhydon's potential and tends to be unreliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Torterra, Tangela, Vileplume, and Gourgeist-XL are Rhydon's bane, as all of them can take even boosted attacks from Rhydon and OHKO it with their respective Grass-type STAB moves. The former two do not appreciate taking a Megahorn, however. More offensive Grass-types such as Lilligant, Shiftry, and Cacturne cannot safely switch in, but they force Rhydon out with their Grass STAB moves. Shiftry is also able to clear the field of Stealth Rock with Defog.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Prinplup and Poliwrath switch into Rhydon with relative ease and deal heavy damage with Scald, though neither appreciates taking a boosted Earthquake. Samurott and Kabutops can put Rhydon's sweeps to a halt, as both have access to priority in Aqua Jet. Quagsire is another great answer to Rhydon, as it ignores any stat increases due to Unaware and retaliates with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Many Pokemon that Rhydon otherwise reliably checks are able to lure it in and hit it with a coverage move. Pyroar, Magmortar, and Archeops in particular all commonly carry Hidden Power Grass to deal heavy damage to Rhydon. Archeops and Kangaskhan, both of which Rhydon otherwise easily switches into, can also carry Aqua Tail to 2HKO Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Fast Special Attackers</strong>: Even when its Speed is boosted with Rock Polish, Rhydon is still outsped by many Choice Scarf users that can revenge kill it, such as Lilligant, Jynx, and Mesprit. Naturally fast Pokemon such as Floatzel and Zebstrika are able to outspeed Adamant Rhydon after a Rock Polish and revenge kill it with their STAB or coverage moves. However, none of these Pokemon are capable of switching into Rhydon safely.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Rhydon tends to be worn down by poison, burn, and repeated switches into Spikes, as it has no form of recovery. Burns in particular greatly hinder Rhydon, as they cut its Attack, making it much easier to switch in to.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Polish boosts Rhydon's Speed, allowing it to outspeed many unboosted offensive Pokemon. Earthquake and Stone Edge together have great coverage, hitting a good majority of Pokemon for at least neutral damage. Swords Dance boosts Rhydon's Attack to frightening levels, making it very difficult for opposing Pokemon to safely switch into. Megahorn is an alternative move that rounds out Rhydon's coverage by hitting Pokemon that resist both Earthquake and Stone Edge, such as Torterra and Claydol, as well as nailing Ludicolo, Lilligant, Musharna, Mesprit, and Malamar. Rock Slide is another option over Stone Edge if the accuracy proves to be an issue, but the damage output is significantly lower. Stealth Rock can also be used to have Rhydon act as both a team supporter and a late-game cleaner.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs allow Rhydon to hit as hard as possible, while maximum Speed EVs plus a Jolly nature ensure it outspeeds defensive Lanturn, uninvested Malamar, and Jolly Carracosta before a boost, as well as Floatzel and Modest Choice Scarf Mesprit after a Rock Polish. Eviolite increases Rhydon's bulk significantly, giving it many opportunities to set up throughout the match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to set up on Pokemon that cannot do much in return, such as Tauros, Kangaskhan, and Pyroar locked into Fire Blast or Hyper Voice, or on forced switches. Do not bring in Rhydon recklessly, as it needs to stay healthy to be able to set up without being KOed. In addition, watch out for Pokemon that try to lure in Rhydon, such as Archeops running Hidden Power Grass or Aqua Tail. Rhydon can be used as a mid-game wallbreaker by setting up Swords Dance, tearing apart slower teams. Once Rhydon's checks have been weakened, set up Rock Polish to clean late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mesprit is a good partner, as it covers Rhydon's Fighting and Ground weaknesses, provides Stealth Rock support, and can give Rhydon a second shot at sweeping the opposing team with Healing Wish. Garbodor pairs well with Rhydon due to its Fighting-type resistance and provides Spikes and Toxic Spikes support, weakening Pokemon so Rhydon is able to clean late-game with more ease. Bulky Grass-types such as Torterra, Gourgeist-XL, and Tangela give this set issues, as all of them are able to take a hit and OHKO with their respective Grass-type STAB moves, so Flying-types such as Scyther and Archeops all pair well with Rhydon. Similarly, Ice-types, most notably Freeze-Dry users such as Vanilluxe and Articuno, are good teammates, as they appreciate Rhydon's ability to threaten Fire-types while in return they threaten Grass- and Water-types that are able to put Rhydon's sweep to a halt. Cacturne is a good partner thanks to its resistance to Grass and immunity to Water, Spikes support, and ability to break down many Pokemon, paving the way for Rhydon to sweep late-game. Swords Dance Samurott does a great job wallbreaking early- and mid-game and provides a secondary check to Fire-types, as despite Rhydon's resistance, it is still threatened by Fire-types due to most of them have a coverage move or secondary STAB move to hit Rhydon with.</p>"
      },
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rhydon is a great user of Stealth Rock thanks to its good bulk and favorable matchup against Xatu. Earthquake is Rhydon's most reliable STAB move and hits a good majority of Pokemon hard even with minimal Attack investment. Rock Blast is more accurate than Stone Edge, making it more reliable against Pokemon such as Scyther and Xatu. It also breaks Sturdy and Focus Sash, which gives Rhydon a better matchup against lead Archeops. If the inconsistent Base Power proves to be an issue, however, Stone Edge can be used instead. Megahorn hits Pokemon that resist Ground / Rock coverage such as Torterra and Claydol while also hitting Mesprit, Musharna, and Malamar. Swords Dance is another option to allow Rhydon to break through bulkier Pokemon such as Musharna, Mega Audino, and Miltank. Roar is also useful to phaze setup sweepers as well as Water- and Grass-type switch-ins, allowing Rhydon to wear them down with repeated entry hazard damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP EVs increase Rhydon's overall bulk, while 240 EVs go into Special Defense, allowing Rhydon to take Fire-type attacks much more comfortably; investing in Special Defense is generally the better option, as Rhydon's Defense is already high enough when boosted with Eviolite. The remaining EVs plus an Adamant nature allow Rhydon to hit a jump point in Attack, giving its attacks a little more power. Eviolite boosts Rhydon's bulk substantially, allowing it to switch into many Pokemon throughout the match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set plays as a bulky tank; it should be switching in against Pokemon that cannot do much back, such as Tauros, Kangaskhan, and Archeops, and setting up Stealth Rock to support its teammates. Once Stealth Rock is up, use Rhydon's typing to switch in on many Pokemon and weaken the opposing team, as even without heavy Attack investment, Rhydon's attacks still deal great amounts of damage. If the opponent has a Pokemon that resists the combination of Ground / Rock, predict their switch in by using Megahorn. Swords Dance is best used to break down bulkier Pokemon mid-game, allowing a teammate to clean late-game with ease. Before switching Rhydon in against the Pokemon it checks, try to scout for moves such as Hidden Power Grass from Pyroar and Aqua Tail from Archeops and Kangaskhan.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Grass- and Water-types switch into this set with ease, so teammates such as Vileplume and Roselia pair well with Rhydon, with both covering these Pokemon in addition to Rhydon's Fighting-type weakness while Rhydon threatens Fire-types that give Vileplume and Roselia issues. Roselia in particular switches into Lilligant and Ludicolo with ease. Cacturne and Lilligant are good teammates for Rhydon for their ability to switch into Scald and threaten bulky Water-types such as Prinplup and Lanturn. Garbodor can switch into Fighting-types while also wearing them down with Rocky Helmet damage, as well as providing Spikes and Toxic Spikes support, which pairs well with the number of switches Rhydon forces. Though Rhydon does check Fire-types, it still fears the coverage moves they carry, so Lanturn in particular is recommended, as it is able to heal any status inflicted with Heal Bell and bring in Rhydon safely with Volt Switch. Poliwrath is a good partner, as Water Absorb allows it to gain back HP from Water-type moves aimed at Rhydon. Poliwrath is also a good switch-in to Knock Off, which Rhydon does not appreciate losing its Eviolite to, despite taking the move very well otherwise.</p>"

  "Tangela": {
    "overview": "<p>Tangela's high physical bulk, access to Eviolite, and relatively high Special Attack allow it to check various physical threats in NU. Tangela isn't forced to run a recovery move, as it has access to Regenerator, which allows it to recover HP every time it switches out, making it a decent pivot and durable if running an offensive set. Even though Tangela has access to recovery, it struggles against status ailments such as poison, which puts a timer on it, limiting Tangela's switch-ins, especially against teams that carries Toxic Spikes. Tangela faces strong competition from Vileplume, which, thanks to Poison typing, is immune to Toxic and able to absorb Toxic Spikes as well as take Fighting-type moves better. However, Tangela isn't totally outclassed, as it provides good niches in its resistance to Ground-type moves, higher physical bulk, and Regenerator. Tangela's poor typing along with its mediocre Special Defense leave it weak to common special attackers that carry Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-type coverage. Tangela relies on Eviolite to be bulky, so it struggles against Knock Off users such as Gurdurr and Hariyama. Additionally, Tangela's shallow movepool allows Fire-types such as Magmortar to switch in on it easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off is useful to surprise bulky Pokemon that rely on Eviolite such as Gurdurr and Ferroseed, but its damage output is negligible. Infestation is a good option on the defensive set to trap troublesome threats and weaken them. Stun Spore can be useful to cripple fast offensive Pokemon such as Pyroar and Magmortar, which usually find themselves switching into Tangela easily.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types can tank Tangela's Giga Drain and Leaf Storm without too much trouble and can OHKO it with their STAB moves. Magmortar is a hard counter to Tangela because of its high Special Defense and access to Vital Spirit, which prevents Magmortar from being put to sleep. They still don't appreciate getting hit by Ancient Power or Toxic, though, as those moves will quickly remove a large part of their health.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Garbodor, Haunter, and Roselia threaten Tangela, as they take little damage from Tangela's attacks and can either set up Spikes or Toxic Spikes or directly take down Tangela with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Specially defensive Ice-types such as Cryogonal and Regice take next to no damage from Tangela's attacks bar Ancient Power and can set up on Tangela or KO it outright.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off Users</strong>: Knock Off users such as Hariyama and Pawniard don't really appreciate getting put to sleep or hit by a STAB move from Tangela, but they can still remove Tangela's Eviolite, making it much more vulnerable to attacking moves.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Sap Sipper</strong>: Thanks to Sap Sipper, Pokemon such as Bouffalant and Zebstrika can absorb Tangela's Grass-type moves and use it as a setup fodder or force it to switch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Lilligant resists Tangela's main STAB moves, is immune to Sleep Powder, and can make use of Tangela's Special Attack drops from Leaf Storm to set up Quiver Dance, though it doesn't appreciate getting hit by Toxic. Mega Audino and Musharna both have high Special Defense, so they can use Tangela as a setup fodder, but if the latter is not carrying Heal Bell it does not like getting hit with Toxic or Sleep Powder. Musharna can also recover the damage and if it gets hit with Toxic, Tangela will also get crippled because of Synchronize.</p> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu has enough Special Defense to safely switch in on Tangela's attacks and it is able to recover any damage taken and bounce back Tangela's status moves with Magic Bounce. Alternatively, Xatu can cripple Tangela with its own Toxic or attack Tangela with Heat Wave.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is Tangela's main and most powerful STAB move, heavily damaging any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, but it comes at the cost of halving Tangela's Special Attack, which can potentially make Tangela setup fodder for Pokemon such as Lilligant and Xatu. Giga Drain is Tangela's secondary, consistent STAB move and main source of recovery outside of Regenerator. Ancient Power lets Tangela hit Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-types such as Magmortar, Scyther, Rotom-S, and especially Xatu, which is a very common counter to Tangela. However, most of them will still win a 1v1 situation if carrying an Assault Vest or if they are not caught on the switch. Sleep Powder lets Tangela put foes that otherwise counter it to sleep, especially physical threats and setup sweepers which could threaten the team. Hidden Power Fire is used to hit Grass- and Steel-types such as Lilligant, Klinklang, and Ferroseed super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>224 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature are used to make full use of Tangela's high Special Attack, increasing its damage output. 236 HP EVs along with 48 EVs in Defense make Tangela bulkier and allow it to tank a few physical hits, even strong ones such as Kabutops's Stone Edge, letting it avoid the 2HKO after Stealth Rock. Eviolite further increases Tangela's bulk and makes up a bit for its terrible Special Defense. Regenerator strengthens Tangela's role as a durable pivot, even with an offensive set.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tangela plays the role of a bulky special attacker on offensive teams thanks to its good mix of offensive and defensive stats. It can be switched in on physical attackers such as Carracosta and Rhydon, tank the attack, and then attack them or the switch-in and pivot out the next turn. Be wary when switching into special attackers, as Tangela's Special Defense is mediocre even with an Eviolite boost. Sleep Powder can to be used when checking troublesome physical attackers such as Kangaskhan and setup sweepers such as Mawile to prevent them from causing too much trouble, or on predicted opposing switch-ins. Leaf Storm has to be used carefully when the opponent is carrying a setup sweeper, as it drastically drops Tangela's Special Attack and makes it setup fodder for a lot of threats such as Lilligant and Musharna. Giga Drain should be spammed when Tangela has the opportunity, as it deals good damage against Pokemon that don't resist it and recovers Tangela's HP, bolstering Tangela's longevity along with Regenerator.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Tangela fits better on bulky offensive and balanced teams as a bulky pivot because Tangela can both tank hits and hit back hard. Boosting sweepers such as Rhydon and Mawile can make use of Sleep Powder support and pivoting by Tangela to gain more opportunities to set up. Hariyama is a good partner thanks to Thick Fat, which makes it successfully check the Fire- and Ice-types that trouble Tangela, such as Pyroar and Cryogonal. Lanturn is a great partner for Tangela thanks to its typing synergy, as it is able to tank Fire- and Ice-type moves with ease. Ground-types such as Rhydon have great type synergy with Tangela, as they deal with Fire- and Poison-types for Tangela while Tangela handles physical Water-types such as Kabutops for them. Rock- and Fire-types such as Carracosta and Magmortar can also check Flying-, Fire-, Bug-, and Ice-types while while Tangela can take Ground- and Water-type moves for them.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain is Tangela's main STAB move and provides reliable damage and extra recovery. Hidden Power Fire is used to hit Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Mawile, and Cacturne, which resist Giga Drain. Sleep Powder gives Tangela some utility, letting it put troublesome threats to sleep and get free turns to gain momentum or KOs. Toxic is mainly used to cripple common switch-ins such as Bouffalant and Magmortar. Leech Seed is Tangela's main choice for recovery, as it not only heals Tangela over time but also damages foes, making it useful in sticky situations. Synthesis is Tangela's only source of instant recovery along with Regenerator and lets it switch with more freedom on attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in HP along with maximum Defense investment and a Bold nature are needed to maximize and make use of Tangela's physical bulk. Eviolite allows Tangela to be a good physical wall and also makes up a bit for its low Special Defense, putting it one step ahead of other bulky Grass-types such as Vileplume. Regenerator is what makes Tangela a good pivot, as it gives Tangela extra recovery, allowing it to switch in on foes constantly without getting worn down.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tangela is a physical wall and a bulky pivot, so it has to be brought in on physical attackers such as Kangaskhan and then use Sleep Powder or Toxic to cripple them or directly attack them. Giga Drain is the preferred move to use early-game to pull off reliable damage while recovering HP, while Toxic and Sleep Powder should also be used early on to cripple foes. Before switching in on a physical attacker, Tangela has to be careful about Knock Off users such as Hariyama, as they can remove its Eviolite, making it a lot easier to take down. Tangela has to be wary against special attackers such as Lilligant and Mismagius, as its Special Defense is mediocre even with Eviolite. Tangela must also take care against Sap Sipper users such as Bouffalant, as they can absorb its Grass-type moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tangela fits best on bulky offense and balance teams thanks to its ability to tank physical hits with ease and either retaliate or support its teammates. Tangela struggles against residual damage from status ailments and entry hazards, so Defog and Rapid Spin users and clerics are good teammates to remove entry hazards and status afflictions. Poison-types such as Garbodor are also appreciated, as they can both absorb Toxic Spikes, which trouble Tangela, and set up their own entry hazards to support Tangela and its teammates in getting KOs and wearing down foes, while Tangela also helps them by checking Ground-types such as Rhydon. Ground- and Rock-types such as Kabutops, Rhydon, and Carracosta have a good type synergy with Tangela, beating Fire-, Poison-, Bug-, and Flying-types while Tangela is able to check Ground- and Fighting-types for them.</p>"

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "overview": "<p>With a good Attack stat along with dual priority, Kangaskhan is an excellent check to frail offensive Pokemon and most weather sweepers. Kangaskhan's great ability Scrappy augments its good neutral coverage, making its Double-Edge difficult to switch into while also letting it pick off Ghost-types such as Rotom, Haunter, and Mismagius. Solid overall bulk also lets it take some neutral hits with ease, giving it plenty of opportunities to switch in. Kangaskhan is a self-sufficient Pokemon and oftentimes provides a nice blanket check to a wide array of threats. However, Kangaskhan struggles to break past very bulky Normal-resistant Pokemon such as Steelix, Regirock, and Rhydon without the appropriate coverage move. Lack of recovery coupled with Double-Edge recoil also means that Kangaskhan is worn down very fast.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Assault Vest can be used to give Kangaskhan a significant boost in Special Defense, but it comes at the price of a significant drop in power. Facade can be used over Double-Edge or Return to let Kangaskhan take advantage of burns and other status ailments. Fire Punch is another coverage move to mainly hit Ferroseed and other Steel-types, but it leaves Kangaskhan helpless against Rock-types. Wish lets Kangaskhan recover some HP it pass it to teammates, but generally Mega Audino is better in this regard. A more offensive approach to a Wish set, utilizing Power-Up Punch and Facade, is also an option to break past bulky foes that rely on status to check Kangaskhan, such as Weezing, but this comes at the cost of Kangaskhan's main niche in checking offensive Pokemon. Life Orb is another item that can be used, but combined with Double-Edge recoil and repeated Life Orb hits from Fake Out, Kangaskhan gets worn down fast, making it suboptimal. Circle Throw is an interesting option for Kangaskhan, as it allows it to phaze foes that use it as setup bait such as Dual Dance Rhydon and, thanks to Scrappy, has no Pokemon immune to it. Substitute plus Focus Punch lets Kangaskhan harass bulkier teams, but in general having dual priority is better because it has much more use against offensive teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Rhydon and Regirock can give Kangaskhan a lot of issues, as even Earthquake deals very little damage to them. The former can use it to freely set up Swords Dance and Rock Polish, while the latter can cripple it with Thunder Wave and wear it down with repeated attacks. Both, however, are worn down over time due to their lack of reliable recovery. Rhydon is also easily 2HKOed by Aqua Tail, which can make it a shaky check. Archeops resists Fake Out and can avoid Sucker Punch with Roost, while in return, it easily 2HKOes Kangaskhan with Acrobatics. However, it does not appreciate taking a Silk Scarf-boosted Double-Edge and is OHKOed by Aqua Tail after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Quagsire is able to take Kangaskhan's attacks relatively well while recovering off any damage in the process with Recover and can potentially burn Kangaskhan with Scald, crippling it for the rest of the match. Garbodor is a decent answer, as it can take advantage of Kangaskhan's tendency to use Fake Out, wearing it down with Rocky Helmet damage. Garbodor, however, has to watch out for Earthquake, which 2HKOes it and lets Kangaskhan avoid Rocky Helmet and Aftermath damage. Although Weezing takes a decent amount from Double-Edge, it can generally switch in, take a hit, and burn Kangaskhan on the following turn with Will-O-Wisp. Mega Audino has enough physical bulk to stand up against Double-Edge and recover off the damage with either Wish or Rest.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types, in particular Ferroseed and Steelix, are a major pain for Kangaskhan. It has no way of significantly damaging Ferroseed outside of the suboptimal Fire Punch, while Ferroseed wears down Kangaskhan with Iron Barbs and Leech Seed and cripples it with Thunder Wave or Toxic. Klinklang and Mawile can switch into non-Earthquake variants and use Kangaskhan as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Poliwrath can use Vacuum Wave to revenge kill Kangaskhan at low health, and has the physical bulk on its defensive sets to take a hit and use Circle Throw to force it out. Similarly, Hitmonchan can use Mach Punch to revenge kill Kangaskhan when it is at low HP, but it is otherwise outsped and KOed by Silk Scarf Double Edge. Primeape can revenge kill Kangaskhan with Close Combat and outspeeds it no matter what, but it is somewhat frail, meaning it can be picked off by Fake Out after the Defense drop from Close Combat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fake Out enables Kangaskhan to pick off weakened foes or get free damage after switching in. Double-Edge is Kangaskhan's most powerful Normal-type STAB move and has good neutral coverage. Sucker Punch in conjunction with Fake Out lets Kangaskhan have a much easier time picking off weakened foes, though it's worth noting that this move can be taken advantage of. Earthquake rounds out Kangaskhan's coverage by hitting common switch-ins such as Garbodor, Klinklang, and Steelix. Aqua Tail can be used over Earthquake to hit Rhydon much harder while maintaining coverage on Regirock, but it's worth noting that this leaves Kangaskhan walled by Klinklang and forces Kangaskhan to hit Garbodor with Double-Edge, causing it to get worn down significantly in the process.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs plus an Adamant nature ensure Kangaskhan hits as hard as possible, while maximum Speed EVs ensure it outspeeds as many Pokemon as possible. Jolly is an alternative to outspeed positive-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon including Mesprit, Kabutops, and Shiftry, as well as to outspeed Jolly Pinsir, Timid Lilligant, and Hidden Power Fire Timid Lilligant. Silk Scarf is chosen for the decent boost to Kangaskhan's STAB moves without inflicting any recoil. Lum Berry is another option to let Kangaskhan fare better versus Will-O-Wisp users at the cost of some power. Scrappy is mandatory, as it lets Kangaskhan damage Ghost-types with its Normal-type attacks, making its STAB moves harder to switch into.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kangaskhan should be primarily used as revenge killer, so bring it in against a weakened foe to pick it off with dual priority. Sometimes, using Fake Out is obvious, and the opponent will respond by switching into a bulky Pokemon, so predict the switch by using either a coverage move or Double-Edge to get a heavy hit. In some cases, however, when trying to revenge kill or get extra damage against a foe, it is best to use Fake Out, then switch out to a pivot or death fodder, and then switch Kangaskhan back in to hit the foe again with Fake Out. Against Pokemon that Kangaskhan cannot do much back to, such as Ferroseed and Regirock, predict their switches in by double switching to a teammate that can take care of them. Kangaskhan should also be preserved if the opposing team has a frail sweeper that it can revenge kill. Sucker Punch should be used cautiously against Ghost-types, as they can take advantage of this by using Will-O-Wisp, so it's generally safe to scout for the Will-O-Wisp by switching to another teammate. Kangaskhan can also be used as an early- and mid-game wallbreaker against slower teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Kangaskhan fits well on teams that need a blanket check to offensive Pokemon such as weather sweepers and frail Pokemon. Garbodor is the best teammate, as it can switch into Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan, which can give Kangaskhan issues, as well as set up Toxic Spikes, which pair incredibly well with Kangaskhan's Fake Out. Mesprit is able to switch into Fighting-type attacks aimed at Kangaskhan, revenge kill their users with Psychic, and provide Healing Wish support, which is useful for healing Kangaskhan if it has been worn down too much by repeated Double-Edge recoil or crippled by status ailments. Water-types such as Floatzel and Samurott are good teammates because of their ability to threaten Rock-types such as Rhydon, Regirock, and Archeops and Taunt bulkier Pokemon, preventing them from recovering any HP. Grass-types such as Lilligant, Shiftry, and Torterra are also decent partners because all are able to force out Rock-types, with the former two using them as setup bait and the latter using them to set up Stealth Rock freely. Kangaskhan also tends to bait in Poison-types such as Garbodor and Weezing, allowing it to wear them down for Lilligant to clean late-game. Choice Band Primeape gets past bothersome foes for Kangaskhan such as Ferroseed, Rhydon, and Regirock, while Kangaskhan picks off faster foes that can revenge kill Primeape.</p>"

  "Mr. Mime": {
    "overview": "<p>Mr. Mime separates itself from the other Psychic-types of the tier with its secondary Fairy typing and access to Healing Wish, as well as the ability to hit Steelix hard with Focus Blast, something that some other Psychic-types, such as Mesprit, cannot do. Mr. Mime can provide a lot of offensive utility to a team with Healing Wish and two great abilities in Soundproof and Filter, which let it block sound moves such as Hyper Voice and Boomburst and take less damage from super effective attacks, respectively. On the other hand, Mr. Mime's low physical bulk means it's vulnerable to strong physical attacks and gives it a worse matchup against certain Fighting-types, with Knock Off doing a lot of damage. Its base 90 Speed stat also leaves it outsped by some offensive Pokemon such as Tauros, Archeops, and Jynx, leaving it susceptible to getting revenge killed. Furthermore, it faces competition from other Psychic-types, which have either better defensive stats or better Special Attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Nasty Plot set with dual STAB moves and Focus Blast can be used to turn Mr. Mime into a deadly sweeper or wallbreaker that can muscle through its specially defensive checks with brute force after a boost, but it has trouble setting up due to low bulk and forgoes the utility of Healing Wish, making it usually inferior. Soundproof also makes this set immune to Roar, which can be marginally useful. A Choice Scarf set can be used to make Mr. Mime a decently powerful revenge killer with utility moves such as Trick or Healing Wish. However, it lacks the power of other Choice Scarf users such as Haunter, making it somewhat outclassed in this role outside of its offensive typing and utility. Mr. Mime's Technician ability can boost the power of many of its moves, such as Icy Wind, various Hidden Powers, and Charge Beam, but those cover very little of what Mr. Mime doesn't already handle, and it doesn't offer the defensive utility that Mr. Mime's other abilities have.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: If Mr. Mime is not running Nasty Plot, it runs the risk of being walled by prominent special walls such as Mega Audino, as it isn't powerful enough to break through some of them. However, it does have a good matchup against some walls such as Sliggoo and Miltank due to its unique STAB moves and coverage.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Mesprit and Musharna can take any hit Mr. Mime throws at them due to their high base Special Defense stats and can attack Mr. Mime with moves like Signal Beam or set up Calm Mind on it. Musharna and Xatu also have recovery moves that make them even better checks to Mr. Mime. However, some of them, such as Musharna and Grumpig, struggle against Taunt variants of Mr. Mime, as they cannot use their recovery moves or Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Due to Mr. Mime's bad Defense, it is prone to being revenge killed by priority moves such as Skuntank's Sucker Punch and Hariyama's Bullet Punch. Kangaskhan can also KO Mr. Mime with the combination of Fake Out and Sucker Punch, making it a exceptional revenge killer against Mr. Mime. Other priority users, such as Shiftry and Samurott, are decent revenge killers, but Mr. Mime's 4x Fighting resistance at least means it isn't revenge killed by Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Mr. Mime has a decent base Speed stat, but it is still prone to being revenge killed by the many Pokemon that outspeed it, such as Pyroar, Tauros, and Archeops. However, Pyroar has to be careful about using Hyper Voice on Mr. Mime due to the possibility of Soundproof.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is a reliable and powerful STAB move that hits Fighting- and Poison-types such as Throh and Weezing for big damage while also having great coverage alongside Dazzling Gleam. Dazzling Gleam hits Dark- and Dragon-types such as Liepard and Altaria for super effective damage and also a strong neutral hit against opposing Psychic-types. It also gives Mr. Mime a reliable way of beating Malamar, which can be a problem for most other Psychic-types. Focus Blast hits Steel-types such as Steelix for big damage, and it also hits Normal-types such as Miltank, giving Mr. Mime perfect neutral coverage against most of the tier. Healing Wish is amazing on Mr. Mime to heal a teammate's HP and status, giving Mr. Mime a nice utility move to use when its job has been done. Psyshock is an option over Psychic, as it does more damage against specially defensive targets such as Assault Vest Magmortar and Assault Vest Lanturn, but it can't hit physically defensive targets such as Weezing as hard as Psychic, which Mr. Mime can take heavy damage from. Taunt can be used over Healing Wish to disrupt bulkier Pokemon by preventing them from using their recovery moves, but Mr. Mime won't be beating them one-on-one without taking a lot of damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature augments Mr. Mime's offensive potential, and a Life Orb is used to increase Mr. Mime's power significantly. Choice Specs can be used to further increase Mr. Mime's power at the cost of being locked into a move. Soundproof is the preferred ability in order to switch into Boomburst from Choice Specs Swellow and Chatot, and it allows Mr. Mime to switch into Aurorus and Pyroar locked into Hyper Voice, giving Mr. Mime more utility. Alternatively, Mr. Mime can opt to use Filter, decreasing the damage done by super effective moves such as Hariyama's Bullet Punch and Rotom's Shadow Ball.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Mr. Mime's frailty, it does not want to be switched into attacks, so try to bring it in after a teammate has fainted or with a pivot move such as Volt Switch or U-turn. However, with Soundproof, it is immune to sound-based moves such as Swellow's Boomburst and Aurorus's Hyper Voice, so it can easily switch in on them and take momentum if they are locked into those moves. On the other hand, it can be risky to do this at times, as Swellow and Chatot have U-turn to pivot into a potential check to Mr. Mime. Once Mr. Mime is in safely, it can use its STAB moves and coverage to damage the opposing team with its decent power. Healing Wish should only be used if Mr. Mime or its teammate is weakened or crippled and its teammate has a better matchup against the opposing team. Due to it being one-time use, it is extremely important to use this on the right Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that utilize Volt Switch or U-turn can be valuable by bringing Mr. Mime in safely, so Pokemon such as Scyther and Rotom are good partners. Scyther also appreciates Mr. Mime breaking down Steelix with Focus Blast, and the VoltTurn users all appreciate Healing Wish recovering them back up to full health. Offensive Pokemon that appreciate being given a second chance to break the opposing team, such as Floatzel and Primeape, can make for good partners to Mr. Mime. A defensive backbone is good for Mr. Mime if it is being used on a more balanced team, as it can take the hits Mr. Mime can't, and Mr. Mime can use Healing Wish to restore its partners' HP if they're weakened; Steelix and Weezing can synergize very well with Mr. Mime. Dark-types such as Liepard and Skuntank can partner up well with Mr. Mime due to being able to break through the Psychic-types Mr. Mime can't. Mr. Mime returns the favor by checking Fighting-types like Hitmonchan. Wallbreakers such as Samurott and Kabutops can break down specially defensive walls that Mr. Mime has trouble hitting very hard, and they can benefit well from Healing Wish. Pokemon that rely on recoil moves to do damage, such as Kangaskhan and Wood Hammer Abomasnow, also make for good partners, as they get worn down easily and appreciate Healing Wish patching them up. Offensive teams with Mr. Mime want a good response to faster Pokemon such as Tauros that force Mr. Mime out, so Pokemon like Choice Scarf Rotom partner well with Mr. Mime to help out with this problem.</p>"

  "Scyther": {
    "overview": "<p>High Attack and Speed make Scyther a potent offensive threat, and solid HP and defenses, especially when holding an Eviolite, provide Scyther with defensive utility as well, allowing it to switch into many of the tier's biggest threats such as Shiftry, Hariyama, Musharna, and Malamar. Scyther is also one of the best momentum grabbers in the tier with a strong and quick U-turn, especially when equipped with a Choice Scarf. With Choice Scarf, Scyther is a premier revenge killer, even outspeeding weather threats such as Swift Swim Ludicolo and Chlorophyll Victreebel. Scyther is also very versatile with the item it can run, as alongside Eviolite and Choice Scarf, it can use the Choice Band to become an incredibly powerful wallbreaker with its high Attack stat. From a defensive standpoint, its Bug / Flying typing allows Scyther to take powerful Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon such as Primeape and Hitmonchan; however, it makes Scyther 4x weak to Rock-type attacks and Stealth Rock. In a similar vein, despite 4x resisting both Grass and Fighting, Scyther is somewhat of an inconsistent check to Lilligant and Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Primeape, as all of these Pokemon commonly carry Rock-type coverage options. Its Bug / Flying typing also leaves Scyther weak to other common attacking types such as Fire and Electric. Furthermore, if Scyther loses its Eviolite, it suddenly struggles to check the Pokemon it previously could with its increased bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Brick Break is useful on Choice Band Scyther, as it gives Scyther a way to hit most Steel- and Rock-types super effectively, although due to its low Base Power and the naturally high Defense stat of most Steel- and Rock-types, it is usually better to just U-turn out. An offensive Eviolite set running maximum Attack and Speed gives Scyther better immediate damage output and more reliably OHKOes Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Mesprit, and Xatu after Stealth Rock damage, but the defensive utility that comes with the bulky Swords Dance set is often too useful to pass up. Reversal is a neat coverage option for Choice sets, as once Scyther has switched into Stealth Rock twice, Reversal is an insanely powerful 200-Base Power Fighting-type attack that can surprise bulky Rock- and Steel-types that think they're safe against Scyther. Reversal is incredibly unreliable, though, as it can only be used when Scyther is at a very low amount of HP and is often a wasted coverage slot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock is extremely detrimental to Scyther's success, as Scyther is 4x weak to it. This weakness either causes Scyther to lose momentum by clicking Roost to stay healthy or severely hinders the Choice sets and prevents Scyther from clicking U-turn freely.</p> <p><strong>Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Rhydon, Regirock, and Steelix can switch into any of Scyther's attacks without much fear and can demolish it with a Rock-type attack, status it, or set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Bulky Swords Dance Scyther requires its Eviolite to tank attacks like Kangaskhan's Double-Edge better, and the Choice sets are either too weak or too slow to fulfill their purpose on a team without their item.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Poison-types</strong>: Bulky Poison-types such as Weezing and Garbodor resist U-turn, and the former can cripple Scyther with Will-O-Wisp, while the latter can punish Scyther for using U-turn with Rocky Helmet and Aftermath damage. Garbodor can even run Rock Blast to directly beat Scyther, while Scyther has no counterplay against Weezing other than U-turning out and letting Weezing do what it pleases.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Scyther to boost its Attack to extremely high levels. U-turn is used over a stronger alternative in Bug Bite, as it allows Scyther to weaken its checks such as Rhydon and Steelix so that it can break through more easily in the late-game. U-turn is Scyther's most spammable move early- and mid-game, and it is also useful for stopping bulky Psychic- and Dark-types such as boosted Musharna and Malamar once Scyther has a Swords Dance under its belt. Aerial Ace is the best cleaning tool Scyther has access to, and its impressive mono-attacking coverage makes it a consistent sweeping tool. Lastly, Roost lets Scyther stay healthy throughout a battle and increases its longevity.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs provide Scyther with as much mixed bulk as possible while also ensuring that it can switch into Stealth Rock at least twice. Maximum Speed with a Jolly nature is crucial to make sure Scyther outspeeds everything it can to U-turn out or sweep late-game. Eviolite is used to increase Scyther's already impressive bulk. Technician boosts Scyther's main cleaning tool, Aerial Ace, to an impressive 90 Base Power. Alternatively, a spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe can be used, but this greatly decreases Scyther's bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swords Dance Scyther is best used as a late-game sweeper once its checks and counters have been weakened or eliminated, but setting up early-game and weakening your opponent's check with U-turn is also a viable option. Scyther does have a strong early- and mid-game presence, though, as U-turn allows it to keep up momentum even before an Attack boost. Try to avoid sending out Scyther when Stealth Rock is up on your side of the field, as losing 50% of its HP often means Scyther is forced to use Roost instead of U-turn or Swords Dance, losing momentum. It is usually best to click Roost when Scyther is low on health, when you are attempting to dodge a Sucker Punch, or when removing Scyther's Flying typing is beneficial. An example of this situation would be Roosting to make Scyther neutral to a Lanturn's or Rotom's Volt Switch. Roost can also be used to stall out foes inflicted with burn or toxic if this is preferable to outright attacking them, such as when facing a burned Garbodor or Skuntank to avoid Aftermath recoil.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Volt Switch users such as Lanturn and Rotom make for excellent partners alongside Scyther, as they help each other grab momentum and form a potent VoltTurn core. Rotom in particular deserves a mention, as it can burn bulky Rock- and Steel-types that give Scyther trouble, such as Rhydon and Steelix. Lanturn has terrific defensive synergy with Scyther and also tends to bait in Grass-types, which Scyther can capitalize on. Shiftry provides Defog support and takes down Rhydon and Steelix, as well as removing Garbodor's and Weezing's items, which makes the former no longer able to punish Scyther for spamming U-turn and the latter easier to wear down throughout the battle. Fighting-types such as Primeape and Hitmonchan work well with Scyther, as they can break through the bulky Rock- and Steel-types that Scyther despises. Hitmonchan in particular works well with Scyther, as it can also Rapid Spin away Stealth Rock, which is a nuisance to Scyther. Powerful wallbreakers such as Swellow, Samurott, and Abomasnow are good partners for Scyther, as they appreciate the free switches that Scyther provides for them with U-turn. Spinners and Defoggers such as Kabutops, Mantine, Pelipper, and Prinplup are necessary partners alongside Scyther, as Scyther's crippling weakness to Stealth Rock hinders it greatly. Conversely, Scyther really appreciates entry hazards, in particular Spikes, as they wear down bulky Rock- and Steel-types with ease, especially in conjunction with U-turn. Hazard setters such as Omastar, Crustle, and Garbodor are all viable partners.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn is the most spammable move on the set, providing momentum throughout the battle while also weakening Scyther's checks and counters such as Rhydon and Steelix. Aerial Ace provides good neutral coverage alongside U-turn and doesn't force Scyther to switch out. Knock Off hits most Pokemon that resist Scyther's STAB combination like Steelix, Rotom, and Klinklang hard, and it also has general utility in removing items and shortening bulkier Pokemon's longevity. Pursuit can be used over Knock Off if trapping Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Mesprit and Mismagius is more beneficial for the team. Quick Attack is a priority move boosted by Technician, and with a Choice Band it hits fairly hard. It is particularly useful for picking off faster weakened threats such as Pyroar, Floatzel, and Swellow.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Scyther to hit as hard and fast as possible, while the remaining 4 EVs are put into Defense instead of HP to allow Scyther to switch in on Stealth Rock at least twice. Technician powers up Aerial Ace while also making Pursuit fairly powerful, allowing Scyther to notably OHKO Rotom after Stealth Rock. Choice Band is used to maximize Scyther's immediate power and has terrific synergy with U-turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>U-turn is the move you want to click most often, especially early-and mid-game, as it not only weakens Scyther's check and counters but also provides momentum. Scyther does not have access to reliable recovery in Roost and has only average bulk, so avoid switching it into anything other than resisted attacks such as Primeape's Close Combat and Lilligant's Giga Drain. Beware of crippling status moves such as Thunder Wave from Pokemon Scyther usually has little trouble switching in on, such as Xatu, Musharna, and Mesprit. Be very cautious when clicking Quick Attack, as being locked into it can often leave you at a disadvantage. It is best to use Pursuit when the opposing Pokemon doesn't threaten to either status or KO Scyther. For example, using Pursuit on a Rotom locked into Shadow Ball is usually safe, but clicking Pursuit versus a Rotom with Colbur Berry that can still burn or use Thunderbolt on Scyther is often suboptimal.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal support is necessary for Scyther, as it is 4x weak to Stealth Rock and has no means of recovery, so Pokemon that can remove hazards such as Claydol, Mantine, Hitmonchan, and Prinplup are solid partners. Each of these hazard removers provides different alternate uses for Scyther, as Claydol can switch in on Rhydon, Garbodor and Weezing; Mantine and Prinplup have good defensive synergy with Scyther, and Hitmonchan breaks down bulky Rock- and Steel-types for Scyther. Scyther greatly appreciates having hazards on the opponent's side of the field, so hazard setters like Ferroseed, Steelix, and Garbodor work well. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Rotom, Lanturn, and Swellow can form terrifying VoltTurn cores alongside Scyther that keep momentum up throughout a battle. Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan, Primeape, and Hariyama are all fantastic partners alongside Scyther, as they can break through the Rock- and Steel-types that plague Scyther and appreciate the free switches it provides with U-turn. Since Choice Band Scyther is a solid wallbreaker in its own right, late-game cleaners such as Klinklang, Barbaracle, and Lilligant make for quality partners.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn provides momentum and weakens Scyther's checks and counters for later in the game. Choice Scarf Scyther has the quickest U-turn in the tier, which makes it a very reliable hit-and-run revenge killer. Aerial Ace is best used late-game once the opponent's team has been sufficiently weakened and when Scyther wants to attack without being forced to switch. Knock Off is useful for removing items, especially on bulkier Pokemon such as Rhydon and Steelix, allowing Scyther to easier combat them late-game. Knock Off also has utility in revenge killing non-Colbur Berry variants of Rotom. Bug Bite is a stronger alternative to U-turn that doesn't force Scyther to switch out but can often result in a loss in momentum. Tailwind can also be used as a last-ditch utility move to speed up your team for four turns, but beware of mindlessly clicking Tailwind, as it is not a move you want to be locked into.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed are used to hit as hard and fast as possible, while the remaining 4 EVs are placed in Defense over HP to ensure Scyther can switch into Stealth Rock at least twice throughout a battle. Technician provides a power boost to Scyther's strongest STAB moves, Aerial Ace and Bug Bite. A Jolly nature allows Choice Scarf Scyther to outpace common threats such as Choice Scarf Rotom, Choice Scarf Jynx, and +1 Lilligant. Choice Scarf lets Scyther outspeed almost the entire metagame and has solid synergy with U-turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because it lacks Eviolite and recovery, Choice Scarf Scyther can only rely on its average bulk to tank attacks, so avoid switching it in on strong neutral attacks when possible. U-turn is the move you should be clicking the most, especially early- and mid-game, as it provides momentum for the rest of the team and gets chip damage off on Scyther's checks. Beware of clicking Aerial Ace and Bug Bite early on in a battle, as it can result in a loss of momentum that your opponent can easily capitalize on. Late-game, once the opposing team has been weakened, is where Scyther shines, as it can use Aerial Ace or Bug Bite more freely and clean up teams. Avoid switching Scyther into Knock Off from Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Throh if revenge killing Floatzel, Swellow, and opposing Choice Scarf Pokemon is important. Tailwind is best used as a last-ditch effort once Scyther proves to no longer be useful, although you should beware of clicking Tailwind because being locked into it is very easy for an opponent to take advantage of.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers that can punch through defensive cores, such as Choice Band Primeape, Samurott, and Magmortar, are amazing partners for Scyther, as they clear the way for it to sweep late-game. Primeape in particular forms an effective U-turn core with Scyther, allowing them to threaten each other's checks and counters. Entry hazard removal is key to Scyther's success, so Pokemon such as Pelipper, Xatu, and Hitmonchan are all good partners alongside Scyther. Scyther appreciates the chip damage that comes with having hazards on the opponent's side of the field, so Pokemon that can set them up like Omastar, Rhydon, and Cacturne work well. Pokemon with Volt Switch or U-turn such as Xatu and Lanturn make for excellent partners, as they keep momentum up throughout a battle. Choice Scarf Scyther sits in a terrific Speed tier, so Pokemon that appreciate faster threats such as Swellow, Floatzel, and weather abusers being removed, like Aurorus and Choice Band Primeape, make for quality partners.</p>"

  "Jynx": {
    "overview": "<p>In terms of sheer wallbreaking prowess, few NU Pokemon compare to Jynx thanks to its amazing offensive typing, unique ability in Dry Skin, impeccable coverage, and access to Lovely Kiss, which allows it to cripple what it cannot beat. Thanks to its access to Psyshock and Focus Blast alongside respectable Special Attack, Jynx can bypass traditional checks to Ice-types such as Magmortar, Hariyama, and Piloswine, further solidifying it as an offensive powerhouse. Dry Skin allows Jynx to be among the few solid offensive checks to the ever-present Water-types in NU, most notably Samurott, Carracosta, and Floatzel, giving it a solid defensive niche. Additionally, Jynx's Speed hits a nice benchmark, letting it outspeed a good portion of the metagame, most notably Pinsir, Xatu, and Lilligant. However, Jynx is ultimately faulted by its horrendous defensive typing and terrible bulk, meaning it offers very little defensive utility and is awkward to fit on teams; this is further compounded by its weakness to Stealth Rock, limiting its opportunities to switch in. Furthermore, Jynx faces competition both as a Psychic-type with Mesprit, which boasts a useful defensive typing, decent bulk, and a unique support movepool including Stealth Rock and Healing Wish, and as an Ice-type with Aurorus, which hits harder due to wielding Choice Specs, while having access to Freeze-Dry, allowing it to wallbreak more effectively and eliminate Water-types. While Jynx does boast commendable Speed, it finds itself susceptible to many faster attackers and priority attackers such as Tauros and Kangaskhan due to its atrocious defenses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Energy Ball is an option to turn Jynx into a more effective check to Water-types; however, it otherwise provides redundant coverage. Similarly, Signal Beam can be used to hit Malamar and other Psychic-types. A set utilizing Counter can be used to surprise physical attackers; however, it is incompatible with Dry Skin, so using it takes away one of Jynx's best traits.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Despite its respectable Speed tier, Jynx falls prey to faster attackers and priority attackers alike. While they won't want to directly switch into Jynx, faster attackers such as Swellow and Tauros can outspeed and eliminate Jynx with a little prior damage. However, these Pokemon must be wary of the Choice Scarf set which they cannot revenge kill, depending on the move it is locked into. Priority attackers such as Kangaskhan and Hitmonchan can pick off a weakened Jynx due to its abysmal Defense. Kangaskhan in particular can even get past Focus Sash variants of Jynx with the combination of Fake Out and Sucker Punch; however, using Sucker Punch on Jynx can be risky, as it could easily go for Lovely Kiss to put Kangaskhan to sleep while avoiding damage from Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: While they won't appreciate switching into Focus Blast or Lovely Kiss, Steel-types such as Klinklang and Metang can take any one hit from Jynx and eliminate even Focus Sash variants with Gear Grind or the combination of Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Grumpig, Magmortar, and Mega Audino can comfortably come in on Jynx due to their admirable bulk. However, it should be noted that these Pokemon with the exception of Magmortar can still be put to sleep by Lovely Kiss. Magmortar should be wary of switching into Psyshock, but it prevents Jynx from putting a Pokemon to sleep thanks to Vital Spirit and can shrug off Ice Beams with ease.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Focus Sash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam provides Jynx with a strong, reliable STAB attack that hits a large portion of the tier for at least neutral damage. Lovely Kiss cripples what Jynx cannot otherwise beat, giving it free turns to attack or set up on the foe. Psyshock provides Jynx with excellent coverage to use alongside Ice Beam, most notably hitting Magmortar, Hariyama, and Lanturn. Alternatively, Psychic can be used in this slot to hit foes like Prinplup and Samurott harder, but Psyshock's targets are generally more useful for Jynx to hit. Focus Blast is the recommended choice for the last move, rounding out Jynx's already incredible coverage by hitting foes like Piloswine, Steelix, and Ferroseed. Alternatively, Jynx can forgo Focus Blast for Nasty Plot, which lets Jynx boost its already stellar Special Attack and take advantage of the many switches it forces, as well as letting it defeat Mega Audino and Musharna more easily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum EV investment in Special Attack and Speed allows Jynx to hit as hard and move as fast as possible. Focus Sash allows Jynx to take any one hit and retaliate with an attack or Lovely Kiss to put the foe to sleep when it cannot otherwise beat it. Additionally, Jynx does an excellent job of shutting down suicide leads, putting them all, bar Archeops, to sleep before they can lay entry hazards and 2HKOing them in retaliation. Alternatively, Jynx can hold a Life Orb, turning it into an even more dangerous wallbreaker; however, because of the recoil, this power comes at the cost of furthering Jynx's issue with longevity. If Life Orb is the chosen item, Jynx should always use Focus Blast over Nasty Plot, as Life Orb Jynx vastly prefers the coverage Focus Blast provides to the ability to boost its Special Attack. Dry Skin gives Jynx a useful immunity to Water-type moves, granting it switch in opportunities against the likes of Lanturn and Mantine, as well as letting it check Samurott and Floatzel.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When holding Focus Sash, Jynx should usually be used as a lead, as it can almost always KO the foe or at least cripple it with Lovely Kiss, letting Jynx break walls and put offensive pressure on the foe early-game. Dry Skin should typically be taken advantage of to the fullest; this means switching Jynx into Water-types such as Prinplup or Lanturn to punish their reliance on dealing damage with Scald. Due to its poor bulk, getting Jynx in on a free switch, such as after a teammate has fainted or on a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, is essential for it to optimally perform. With Jynx's incredible power and coverage, it naturally forces a lot of switches; this provides prime opportunities to set up Nasty Plot, as a boosted Jynx is incredibly difficult for any team to handle.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Jynx's ability to dismantle defensive cores like Swellow, Lilligant, and Tauros can often clean up once the opponent's team has been weakened while also threatening the faster-paced offensive teams that Jynx isn't as threatening against. Pokemon like Rhydon and Samurott that appreciate Jynx's ability to offensively check Water-types are good partners as well; Rhydon in particular makes for an excellent partner, as it checks Kangaskhan and Fire-types, which greatly trouble Jynx, while also providing Stealth Rock support; in return, Jynx threatens the Grass- and Fighting-types that check Rhydon. Samurott also appreciates Jynx's ability to offensively check most Grass-types. As Jynx functions best with its Focus Sash intact, entry hazard control from the likes of Hitmonchan and Skuntank is recommended to maximize Jynx's efficiency. Hitmonchan in particular makes for a notable partner, as it removes both the entry hazards and Dark-types that trouble Jynx. On the other hand, Jynx appreciates having teammates than can set up entry hazards to wear down the opponent's team, making it easier for it to wallbreak. In particular, Ferroseed can lay Spikes and check Kangaskhan, and it also appreciates Jynx's ability to offensively check Fighting-types.</p>"

      "Substitute + Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute gives Jynx many setup opportunities, the ability to avoid Sucker Punch, and a shield from status. Nasty Plot gives Jynx significantly more power and lets it deal huge amounts of damage; for example, it can OHKO defensive Rhydon at +2. Lovely Kiss incapacitates foes, allowing Jynx to set up either Substitute or Nasty Plot and attempt to sweep. Ice Beam is the most reliable move on this set, though, as it has great neutral coverage. Psyshock is a strong STAB move that hits Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Thick Fat Hariyama and Magmortar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximizing Speed EVs is the best choice for Jynx due to its poor bulk and decent Speed tier, allowing it to be as fast as possible. This lets Jynx Speed tie with opposing Speed base 95s, such as Primeape, opposing Jynx, and Sawsbuck. A Timid nature is used to outspeed 90 Base Speed like Lilligant, Kangaskhan, and Rotom. Maximum Special Attack investment lets Jynx hit extremely hard. Dry Skin is the only viable ability for Jynx, as it allows it to switch safely into Water-type moves and recover some HP back. This set appreciates Leftovers recovery to alleviate the HP loss from Substitute, allowing Jynx to set it up more than four times in a single game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jynx should set up Substitute against Pokemon that might use Thunder Wave, Sleep Powder, or Toxic such as Musharna, Vivillon, and Gastrodon or so that it can start setting up Nasty Plot or simply throw out an attack. Jynx can attempt to switch into Water-type attacks such as Samurott's Waterfall and Ludicolo's Scald and either put the attacker to sleep or KO it. It should watch out while switching into some of them, such as Samurott, Kabutops, and Barbaracle, due to their coverage moves dealing heavy damage. Jynx takes huge amounts of damage from all forms of priority besides Aqua Jet; therefore, it should only stay in versus priority users such as Hariyama and Hitmonchan if it is safely behind a Substitute and can KO them with Psyshock. Jynx shouldn't use Substitute while Pokemon that resist Ice such as Piloswine, Thick Fat Hariyama, and Magmortar are around if it's not using Psyshock, as it gets easily walled by those. Pokemon with sound-based moves such as Swellow, Pyroar, and Aurorus can cause many issues, since their moves bypass Substitute and the former two also outspeed Jynx, so make sure not to let it in against them. Defog Skuntank can also be a threat to Jynx, as it can not only absorb Toxic Spikes, which are usually used in conjunction with Jynx, but also easily stop its sweep attempt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can switch into priority users such as Hitmonchan and Hariyama are very useful. Garbodor is a solid choice, as it can sponge hits from these Fighting-types as well as set up Toxic Spikes to help Jynx sweep more easily. It's also an answer to some of Jynx's checks, such as Mega Audino and Lanturn. Pokemon that can switch into Pyroar and Swellow, such as Regirock, make for great partners, as sound-based moves revenge kill Jynx even when it's behind a Substitute. Additionally, having a teammate that KOes faster Pokemon such as Archeops, Tauros, Swellow, and Charizard is helpful. Don't forget that Jynx works very well against stall teams and defensive teams in general, so the support of anti-offense Pokemon such as Floatzel and Swellow is highly appreciated. Hazard control is important because Substitute, Stealth Rock, and Spikes damage racks up quickly for Jynx; therefore, Hitmonchan is a good partner, and it deals with Dark-type Pokemon such as Liepard, Skuntank, and Shiftry. Water-type Pokemon such as Samurott, Kabutops, and Floatzel are great partners, as they can wear done Fire-type Pokemon comfortably and help Jynx sweep. Toxic Spikes support pairs well if Jynx is running Psyshock so that it doesn't conflict with Lovely Kiss, and it's also useful for wearing down bulky targets and for stalling out with repeated Substitutes.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam is the most accurate Ice-type STAB move Jynx has access to, and it hits common Pokemon like Lilligant and Scyther. It's also a great revenge killing tool, as the only relevant Pokemon that is faster than Jynx and resists Ice is Pyroar, allowing Jynx to revenge kill a majority of Pokemon above base 100 Speed. Psyshock is the choice as the Psychic-type STAB move, being able to hit common special walls like Hariyama and Magmortar for much more damage than Jynx's other moves. Psychic is an alternative that gets alternative coverage, being able to hit more physically bulky Pokemon like Samurott for more damage. Focus Blast hits Steel-types that try to switch in on Jynx's STAB moves, like Klinklang and Steelix, as well as getting super effective coverage on Piloswine, Pyroar, Tauros, and Barbaracle. Trick is an option to cripple bulkier walls that Jynx has no real business attacking; this includes threats like Malamar, Lapras, Musharna, and Lanturn. Lovely Kiss is an option to put a check or a counter to sleep in order to ease prediction, but it's difficult to use when the opponent has a Vital Spirit user like Magmortar. Additionally, due to Sleep Clause, it forces Jynx to switch out the next turn, so be prepared with an answer to whatever is out on the field.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf is used to revenge kill faster Pokemon Jynx can't outspeed unboosted, including Scyther, Swellow, and Tauros, while also letting it beat setup sweepers like Gorebyss and Barbaracle. Maximum Special Attack is used to hit as hard as possible, while maximum Speed is used to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in the tier. A Timid nature is used to maximize Jynx's Speed, allowing it to outspeed Choice Scarf Rotom and to be as fast as possible after Tricking away its Choice Scarf. Dry Skin gives Jynx a key immunity to Water, which allows it to check threatening Pokemon like Samurott and Floatzel.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its high Speed with a Choice Scarf, great coverage, and STAB combination that allows it to hit most of the tier for at least neutral damage, Jynx's main role is as a revenge killer. Due to its frailty, it's best to bring it in after a Pokemon has fainted or on a predicted double switch in order to keep it as healthy as possible. Jynx is also able to be brought in on predicted Water-type moves such as Lanturn's Scald and Floatzel's Hydro Pump. Be wary of revenge killing a foe if your opponent has a Pursuit trapper such as Liepard or Skuntank, as they can trap Jynx after it has locked itself into a move like Psyshock. Trick should be used if there is an obvious switch-in to Jynx on the opposing team, such as Malamar or Lanturn, but it's also smart to use against bulkier teams, where Jynx does not need its Speed as much and would prefer switching up moves in order to get the most out of its coverage options. It can also act as an emergency stop to common setup sweepers like Rhydon with its great coverage, and it can stop a Musharna from sweeping by Tricking away its Choice Scarf or putting it to sleep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Jynx's susceptibility to Pursuit trapping, Pokemon that can beat common trappers like Liepard and Skuntank are good partners; this includes Stealth Rock setters like Steelix and Rhydon, which can help Jynx guarantee the OHKO on Pokemon like Barbaracle and Floatzel. Entry hazard support is especially appreciated because Jynx does not have a boosting item or move. Slow Volt Switch and U-turn users also help Jynx get in safely; these include Pokemon like Pelipper and Lanturn. Hazard removal is also beneficial, as Jynx is weak to Stealth Rock and will normally switch in multiple times throughout the match; Pelipper and Xatu both are good picks, as they also provide a slow U-turn. Hitmonchan is another option that beats Steel- and Dark-types for Jynx while appreciating Jynx's ability to remove faster Flying-types like Archeops and Scyther. In order for Jynx to sweep late-game, powerful wallbreakers make for good partners, particularly ones that can break past bulky Steel-types, such as Rhydon and Magmortar.</p>"

  "Pinsir": {
    "overview": "<p>Pinsir is one of the only notable offensive Bug-types in the tier, possessing a high Attack stat alongside good coverage and Swords Dance, as well as good offensive abilities in Mold Breaker and Moxie: the former allows Pinsir to bypass Levitate and Unaware, making it trickier to check, and also allows Stealth Rock Pinsir to disrupt any team reliant on Xatu for entry hazard control, whereas the latter grants Pinsir snowballing potential. However, Pinsir's Speed is only decent, and its typing gives it weaknesses to all entry hazards and no useful resistances; moreover, while it has the bulk to take some Fighting-type attacks, Pinsir cannot do much to Fighting-types in return. This means Pinsir is more of a glass cannon than it appears to be at first. The Base Power of Pinsir's attacks can also leave a bit to be desired, with its best attack in STAB X-Scissor having only a mediocre 80 Base Power, much lower than that of the STAB moves of most other common attacking types such as Fighting, Fire, and Normal.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pinsir can attempt a Choice Scarf set that steamrolls foes with Moxie boosts, but it is rather weak without any boosts, has difficulty sweeping with any move it locks itself into, and has to work around its entry hazard weakness to boot. Pinsir has access to Knock Off, but its targets boil down to pretty much just Golurk. Pinsir can learn Bulk Up, but the Defense boost is rather insignificant in the long run, and Swords Dance's greater Attack boost is much more important.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Audino</strong>: Any attack Pinsir wants to go for simply bounces off Mega Audino's impenetrable hide, while Mega Audino's unboosted Dazzling Gleam can 3HKO Pinsir as is, much less with Calm Mind boosts, not to mention its access to Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Poliwrath</strong>: Poliwrath counters Pinsir remarkably well due to its high Defense, resistance to Bug, and lack of weaknesses to any of Pinsir's attacks. It can then retaliate with a powerful Hydro Pump or simply resort to burning Pinsir with Scald. However, non-defensive variants of Poliwrath risk being 2HKOed by Choice Band-boosted Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Faster Flying-types such as Swellow, Archeops, Scyther, and Vivillon can switch into X-Scissor or Earthquake and promptly KO Pinsir with their STAB moves. Bulkier Flying-types such as Pelipper and Rotom-S can take most of Pinsir's attacks with ease and keep themselves healthy enough to do so repeatedly. However, the fast Flying-types fall to a Rock-type move on the switch, whereas the bulky ones get taken down by a +2 Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Pinsir shouldn't take any sort of powerful neutral hit if it doesn't have to. Tauros, Rotom, Jynx, Pyroar, Kangaskhan, and +1 Speed Combusken can do some major damage if not outright KO Pinsir.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance doubles Pinsir's Attack, allowing it to OHKO a far greater number of targets. X-Scissor is Pinsir's STAB move and primary attack. Earthquake hits Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types, including Weezing and Rotom with the aid of Mold Breaker; it also nails Garbodor, whose Rocky Helmet and Aftermath strongly dissuade Pinsir from freely using X-Scissor. Stone Edge hits bulky Flying-types, such as Rotom-S, Scyther, and Pelipper. Quick Attack helps pick off weakened faster Pokemon, especially after a Swords Dance boost, and can easily activate Moxie.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment maximizes Pinsir's sweeping prowess. A Jolly nature allows Pinsir to Speed tie with positive-natured Articuno, as well as outrun positive-natured Kabutops, Magmortar, Shiftry, and Mesprit plus Adamant Kangaskhan, improving Pinsir's odds of preserving its sweep. An Adamant nature can be used to give Pinsir as much power as possible if Speed tying or outrunning those threats is not as much of a concern. Mold Breaker allows Pinsir to bypass abilities like Levitate and Unaware, meaning the likes of Rotom and Weezing no longer become huge issues. Moxie, on the other hand, can let Pinsir steamroll teams as it snowballs into a sweep with each KO, and it is more useful when paired with Quick Attack. Life Orb gives Pinsir a significant boost in power to OHKO most bulky Pokemon after a boost, though Lum Berry helps Pinsir sets up safely against status users such as Weezing, defensive Mesprit, and Scald users such as Lanturn, Pelipper, and Mantine.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pinsir can break through most bulky cores without much difficulty after a boost thanks to its impressive neutral coverage. However, finding an opportunity to set up Swords Dance safely is not easy, as Pinsir does not have the best bulk and typing to facilitate this. Slower Psychic- and Grass-types, such as Shiftry, Mesprit, Musharna, Malamar, Ludicolo, and Claydol make for the best opportunities to use Swords Dance, as they will usually switch out of fear of Pinsir's strong X-Scissor. Be warned that Pinsir risks taking significant damage or getting crippled by status should they not switch, so you can keep the opponent on edge by attacking immediately. Pinsir should only really aim to use Swords Dance when pitted against bulkier teams; against faster teams, Pinsir is usually better off throwing out attacks, as its hard-earned Attack boosts can get nullified prematurely by a revenge killer. However, Quick Attack can help improve Pinsir's matchup against offensive teams, especially if they lack a fast switch-in to Normal-type moves such as Rotom or Archeops.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Primeape make for good offensive partners, as Pinsir commonly lures and weakens Poison-types while also breaking Psychic-types for them; Stone Edge Pinsir also eliminates Flying-types for them. While Hariyama isn't quite fast enough to make as good use of Pinsir's hole punching abilities, it does offer a switch-in to Fire-type moves for Pinsir by virtue of its ability, Thick Fat, protecting Pinsir from the likes of Pyroar and Speed Boost Combusken. Both Pinsir and Fighting-types share a Flying-type weakness, so that must be remedied. Rhydon covers all of Pinsir's weaknesses and makes for a powerful offensive partner due to Pinsir's ability to crack open the likes of Weezing and Rotom. Steelix doesn't offer as much defensive synergy or offensive presence as Rhydon, but it does easily handle Mega Audino. Rotom and Rotom-S both tackle Flying-types, can provide Volt Switch support to bring Pinsir into its intended targets more easily, and can handle the bulky Flying-types that Quick Attack Pinsir would struggle to beat.</p> <p>Pinsir mainly preys on bulkier teams, so teammates should be able to take on offensive teams on its behalf. The likes of Swellow, Tauros, Pyroar, Kangaskhan, Combusken, and Klinklang can take on most faster foes for Pinsir and, in turn, appreciate Pinsir softening up their checks. While it's not mandatory, Pinsir appreciates entry hazard control from the likes of Xatu, Claydol, Hitmonchan, and Pelipper to not get worn down quickly and also facilitate easier boosting opportunities.</p>"
      },
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thanks to Mold Breaker, Pinsir can set up Mold Breaker Stealth Rock without any regard for Xatu switch-ins. X-Scissor is Pinsir's STAB move and primary attack. Rock Tomb provides coverage for Flying-types, but its main use is to slow down faster Pokemon, giving Pinsir flexibility in deciding its next move. Earthquake hits Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types, including Weezing and Rotom with the aid of Mold Breaker.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment maximizes Pinsir's offensive presence. Focus Sash allows Pinsir to set up Stealth Rock or use Rock Tomb without fear of being promptly KOed. An Adamant nature is used over Jolly, as Pinsir has little concern about outspeeding foes off the bat, and can use Rock Tomb to slow down anything faster anyway. Mold Breaker allows Pinsir to set up Stealth Rock against Magic Bounce Xatu, and bypass Levitate with Earthquake.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pinsir's primary objective is to set up Stealth Rock, and it can do so with the knowledge that few Pokemon can stop it, or at least do so while coming out unscathed. Pinsir's best move against faster foes is to use Rock Tomb on the first turn. This allows Pinsir to act accordingly: if its Focus Sash is not broken on that turn, Pinsir can attempt to KO the foe and set up Stealth Rock later. However, this is not an advisable tactic should the foe have a priority move. Stealth Rock Pinsir is not meant to survive long at all, so there is almost no need to preserve it outside of the early-game. In fact, it may be beneficial to sacrifice Pinsir as soon as possible to grant the opponent as few openings as possible, as Pinsir doesn't have a good anti-setup tool outside of relying on its coverage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock Pinsir best fits on offensive teams that give little wiggle room for the opponent to remove entry hazards. Offensive Ghost-types such as Rotom, Haunter, and Mismagius make for excellent teammates, as they can block Rapid Spin, provide strong offensive and disruptive presence, and can ward off Defog users such as Pelipper, Mantine, and Prinplup through the former's Electric-type STAB moves and the latter two's access to Taunt. Powerful offensive Pokemon, such as Tauros, Archeops, Magmortar, Shiftry, and Samurott, make great use of the quick Stealth Rock Pinsir provides and can easily punish the opponent's attempts to remove said Stealth Rock using their sheer damage output or setup potential.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>X-Scissor is Pinsir's STAB move and primary attack and shreds bulky Psychic-types such as Musharna, Malamar, and Mesprit. Earthquake targets Poison-, Fire-, and Steel-types, including Weezing and Rotom with the aid of Mold Breaker. It also bypasses Garbodor's Rocky Helmet and Aftermath, which would otherwise strongly dissuade Pinsir from freely using X-Scissor. Stone Edge hits bulky Flying-types, such as Rotom-S and Pelipper. Close Combat's main target is Ferroseed, but it is Pinsir's best attack in general against Mega Audino and Fighting-types, and it hits Rock- and Steel-types, such as Rhydon and Steelix, harder than Earthquake.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment maximizes Pinsir's sweeping prowess. Choice Band gives Pinsir a large boost in power, making the most out of the attack that it uses once or twice before being forced out. An Adamant nature gives Pinsir as much power as possible, which is valuable for this set's hit-and-run role. A Jolly nature allows Pinsir to Speed tie with positive-natured Articuno, as well as outrun positive-natured Kabutops, Magmortar, Shiftry, and Mesprit plus Adamant Kangaskhan. Mold Breaker allows Pinsir to hit Levitate users with Earthquake, greatly easing prediction against Rotom, Haunter, and Weezing. Moxie may allow Pinsir to pull off a snowball sweep, but Choice-locked Pinsir is so easily forced out that Moxie's boost is almost useless.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Pinsir set adopts a hit-and-run approach and relies on prediction to make the most out of each attack. Pinsir can start by launching powerful attacks on slower Pokemon, primarily Grass- and Psychic-types such as Shiftry, Mesprit, Musharna, and Malamar, which get swiftly OHKOed by X-Scissor. Pinsir should make use of its wide arsenal of strong coverage moves to cover the opponent's switch-ins to Bug-type attacks, and for the most part, Pinsir only really needs to predict correctly once to do significant, if not irreparable, damage to the opponent's Pinsir check, which is a major draw for this set. Pinsir can occasionally even scare an Audino into Mega Evolving early with the threat of Close Combat, forcing it to lose Regenerator early.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Pinsir is easily forced out, anti-entry hazard support is vital for Pinsir to function at its best, lest it be heavily worn down by Stealth Rock or Spikes just by switching around. Preferably, such support should come from Pokemon that can switch into Pinsir's checks: Claydol, Pelipper, and Xatu can all switch into Ground- and Fighting-type Pokemon and can handle Poison-types for the most part, with Claydol also boasting a resistance to Rock. Alternatively, Defog Shiftry is a more offensive entry hazard remover that appreciates Pinsir softening its checks. Conversely, Pinsir appreciates entry hazard support on the opposing side of the field, as it makes it easier for Pinsir to pressure teams. Steelix and Garbodor make for great teammates in this regard thanks to their ability to combat Mega Audino.</p> <p>VoltTurn support from the likes of Rotom, Mesprit, and Xatu can allow Pinsir to enter the battle more safely, and attain favorable matchups against the Grass- and Psychic-types that usually switch into those Pokemon. Fast, powerful all-out attackers or setup sweepers, such as Lilligant, Swellow, Tauros, Ludicolo, Kangaskhan, and Barbaracle, help to patch up Pinsir's lackluster matchup against offensive teams. In return, Pinsir can weaken their checks to make it easier for them to sweep.</p>"

  "Tauros": {
    "overview": "<p>With good Attack, a wide array of coverage moves, and a fantastic ability in Sheer Force that further boosts its power, Tauros is the definition of a powerhouse in NU. Tauros is also renowned for its excellent Speed stat, making it a very deadly Pokemon capable of threatening both offense and balance alike. Decent Defense lets it tank a hit or two before it goes down as well and even lets it survive Shiftry's Sucker Punch or Life Orb Hitmonchan's Mach Punch, just as testament to its good natural bulk. All of these traits make Tauros one of the best Pokemon in the tier and one that should never be underestimated under any circumstances. However, it struggles to break past bulky Rock-types such as Rhydon, Omastar, Carracosta, and Regirock, though it has ways to circumvent them through its coverage. Most of its attacks are also inaccurate, which means it can be inconsistent at times. Its Normal typing also does not bring much to the table in terms of synergy due to the lack of resistances, and while its Speed is great, it is still left outpaced and revenge killed by Floatzel and Swellow, two potent offensive threats in their own right.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Work Up has use in raising both of Tauros's offensive stats to higher levels at the cost of coverage, making Pokemon such as Musharna and Mega Audino no longer effective checks to Tauros. Choice Scarf is a decent option, as Tauros is still fairly powerful and has enough Speed to allow it to outspeed weather sweepers such as Ludicolo and Kabutops, but this takes away from Tauros's excellent wallbreaking prowess. Choice Band with Double-Edge lets Tauros serve as a more reliable cleaner at the cost of not being able to switch between coverage moves. Pursuit can be useful to trap Ghost-types that fear getting 2HKOed such as Rotom and Mismagius. Substitute eases prediction for Tauros but comes at the cost of one of its coverage moves, taking away from its wallbreaking potential. Rock Slide can be used for Eviolite Scyther, but it provides very little coverage outside of that. Iron Head may be tempting to use, as it seemingly covers the same targets as Iron Tail with the bonus of being 100% accurate; however, it does not have the necessary power to 2HKO Rhydon and Mega Audino, making it an inferior option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rhydon, Regirock, and Carracosta all sport great physical bulk, meaning that they all take very little from Earthquake and, for the former two, only really fear Iron Tail. All of them can use Tauros to freely set up Stealth Rock and, in the case of Regirock, can cripple Tauros with Thunder Wave. Though Barbaracle isn't a direct switch-in by any means, with a Shuca Berry, it easily sets up Shell Smash on Tauros. Defensive Omastar is also a decent check because with a Shuca Berry, it is not 2HKOed by any of Tauros's moves and can set up Stealth Rock or Spikes, as well as have a chance to burn Tauros with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Musharna and Mega Audino both have enough physical bulk to the point where they cannot be 2HKOed by Rock Climb, though Mega Audino must watch out for Iron Tail. Both of these Pokemon are capable of setting up on Tauros or crippling it with status. Barrier variants of Musharna are particularly problematic because they set up on Tauros with impunity.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Floatzel and Swellow naturally outspeed and revenge kill Tauros, while Choice Scarf users such as Jynx, Primeape, Rotom, and Kabutops are all capable of taking down Tauros as well, though none of these Pokemon can switch in by any means. Hitmonchan is also notable because after some prior damage, it takes down Tauros with Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Weezing and Vileplume are both decent checks to non-Zen Headbutt variants of Tauros, as the former is capable of burning it with Will-O-Wisp, while the latter can shut it down temporarily with Sleep Powder and restore any lost HP with Moonlight. Weezing must be wary of switching in too much, however, because repeated Rock Climbs will wear it down fast, especially if it is not using Pain Split.</p> <p><strong>Steelix</strong>: Steelix is a decent one-time check to Tauros, as it takes very little damage from all of Tauros's attacks with the exception of Fire Blast, which has a high chance to 2HKO after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, making it a shakier response, but to retaliate, Steelix can wear Tauros down with Earthquake or set up Stealth Rock on it.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: If Tauros is running Iron Tail, Rotom can act as decent switch-in, especially defensive variants, as it is not 2HKOed by any of Tauros's moves and cripples it with Will-O-Wisp. However, Rotom crumbles against Tauros should it carry Zen Headbutt. Although it's less common, Misdreavus serves as a fairly sturdy check thanks to its great bulk with Eviolite, immunity to Rock Climb, and access to Will-O-Wisp, letting it cripple Tauros immensely.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Climb is Tauros's most powerful Normal-type STAB move boosted by Sheer Force, being able to 2HKO most neutral targets. Earthquake lets Tauros hit Garbodor, Omastar, and Aurorus. It also has the added bonus of avoiding Rocky Helmet and Aftermath damage from Garbodor and Skuntank. Fire Blast rounds out Tauros's coverage, breaking past Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Steelix, and Gourgeist-XL. The last slot depends on the rest of the team's composition. Iron Tail lets Tauros 2HKO Mega Audino and Rhydon after a little prior damage, as well as Piloswine, the former two of which have no issue switching into Tauros otherwise. Zen Headbutt is an alternative to OHKO Hariyama after one layer of Spikes, 2HKO Weezing after Stealth Rock, and 2HKO Rotom.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs plus a Speed-boosting nature are necessary to take advantage of Tauros's excellent Speed tier, while maximum Attack EVs allow it to hit as hard as possible. A Naive nature is chosen over Jolly to preserve some of Fire Blast's power and is preferred over Hasty because of Tauros's decent Defense. Sheer Force boosts the power of all of Tauros's moves with the exception of Earthquake. Life Orb boosts the power of Tauros's attacks even further and has its recoil negated by Sheer Force.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tauros can be brought in at any point in the game to break down various defensive cores, although it prefers to be brought in via Volt Switch or U-turn to preserve its HP in case it needs to take a hit later on. Prediction can be key when dealing with Tauros's checks. For example, if the opponent has Rhydon, depending on risks, it may be best to predict their switch by using Iron Tail, especially if it's their only response to Normal-type attacks. That way, Rhydon is forced to pick whether it should set up Stealth Rock or just damage Tauros with Earthquake. Similar situations apply for Pokemon such as Steelix, Weezing, and defensive Omastar. This is to ensure that Tauros can keep applying offensive pressure throughout the course of the match.</p> <p>If the opponent has a Ghost-type such as Rotom, Gourgeist-XL, or Golurk, be wary of spamming Rock Climb, as it can lose Tauros a lot of offensive momentum if they bring it in on the move. This is especially problematic against Choice Scarf Rotom, as it can not only revenge kill Tauros after prior damage but also gain offensive momentum with Volt Switch. Thanks to its excellent Speed tier, Tauros can act as a revenge killer for slower offensive threats such as Pyroar, Jynx, and Magmortar if needed. Tauros can be saved for the late-game as well if desired, as when it's paired with another wallbreaker that breaks past its checks such as Zangoose or its checks are just worn down in general, it can clean up weakened teams with ease.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Garbodor provides Spikes support, which helps Tauros score easier KOs on the likes of Omastar and Steelix, and can switch into Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Hariyama, wearing them down with Rocky Helmet and Aftermath damage. Mesprit has similar uses in switching into Fighting-type attacks but has the added bonus of having a Ground immunity, which can help it soft check the likes of Rhydon. It also has various support moves in Stealth Rock, Healing Wish, U-turn, and Thunder Wave, which can all aid Tauros greatly. Lilligant breaks past and even sets up on a few of Tauros's hardest checks such as Regirock and Rhydon, while in return, Tauros weakens the likes of Garbodor, Weezing, Vileplume, and Ferroseed, the latter two of which wall Lilligant if it's not carrying Hidden Power Fire. Lanturn is notable for its ability to switch into Floatzel and Choice Specs Swellow very well, two Pokemon that revenge kill Tauros, as well as provide support in the form of Thunder Wave and Volt Switch.</p> <p>Other Normal-types such as Kangaskhan, Swellow, and Zangoose are very effective when paired with Tauros, because each of them wear down Normal-resistant Pokemon. For example, Zangoose is capable of dealing heavy damage with Close Combat to Steelix, Regirock, and Rhydon, all Pokemon that Tauros struggles to take down without the appropriate coverage move. Skuntank is an interesting option, as it can run two different sets to suit Tauros's needs. With Pursuit, Skuntank can trap Pokemon such as Rotom and Musharna, the former of which switches into Iron Tail Tauros with little issue, while the latter uses Tauros as setup bait. Skuntank can also break past Mega Audino, which is helpful should Tauros opt to use Zen Headbutt instead. On the other hand, Expert Belt Skuntank is also effective, as it deals heavy damage to Steelix, Rhydon, and Omastar with Fire Blast and Hidden Power Grass, bringing them down to the point where none of them are capable of reliably checking Tauros anymore.</p>"

  "Lapras": {
    "overview": "<p>Lapras sports great neutral coverage between its Water-type STAB move and Freeze-Dry, with the former hitting typical Freeze-Dry switch-ins, such as Piloswine and Fire-types. Lapras also possesses some defensive utility with its impressive natural bulk, a 4x resistance to Ice-type attacks, and Water Absorb. However, Lapras is susceptible to common offensive types, such as Fighting, Grass, Electric, and Rock. Lapras's Ice typing particularly spells trouble for it, as it will lose a quarter of its health every time it switches into Stealth Rock. A mediocre Speed stat also leaves Lapras wishing it could match the pace of other offensive threats, such as Mesprit, Primeape, and Kabutops. Lapras is also overly reliant on Choice Specs for power because of its average Special Attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Block / Dragon Dance / Waterfall / Rest can trap common defensive Pokemon, such as Prinplup and Weezing, and then set up on them thanks to Lapras's impressive bulk. Frost Breath pressures Calm Mind sweepers, such as Mega Audino and Musharna. Icicle Plate or Splash Plate can be used to lessen the need for prediction at the cost of having significantly less power. Running Assault Vest with 252 Special Defense EVs instead of Speed EVs makes Lapras a very good special Water-type switch-in despite its lack of offensive presence. Ice Shard can pick off some weakened offensive threats, such as Lilligant and Swellow.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Any Pokemon that doesn't get hit super effectively by one of Lapras's STAB attacks and has a good Special Defense stat to back it up, such as Mega Audino, Musharna, or Hariyama, can threaten it out by setting up on it or crippling it with a status condition.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Lapras is slow and has a lot of weaknesses, so revenge killers, such as Primeape, Tauros, and Electivire, all force Lapras out with their respective STAB or coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Because of its low Speed, Lapras will usually be forced to take some damage before it can launch an attack; combine this with Lapras's weakness to Stealth Rock and lack of recovery, and you might find its HP in critical condition or completely depleted.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferroseed can take advantage of Lapras Choice-locked into Hydro Pump or Freeze-Dry by setting up Stealth Rock, Spikes, or Leech Seed; however, it must be wary of Hidden Power Fire and Ice Beam, as they both threaten to 2HKO it. Klinklang can also take advantage of Lapras locked into Ice Beam or Freeze-Dry by setting up with Shift Gear, but it must be wary of switching into Hydro Pump or Hidden Power Fire.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Lapras's strongest Water-type STAB move for Ice-resistant foes, such as Magmortar and Piloswine. Freeze-Dry hits Water-types, such as Lanturn and Prinplup, that resist Ice Beam and Hydro Pump. Ice Beam sports a higher Base Power compared to Freeze-Dry, but it loses out on coverage against Water-types. Hidden Power Fire is the best option for Jynx, which switches into Lapras's STAB moves with ease, and it has the bonus of hitting Ferroseed harder than Ice Beam does. Signal Beam can be used if your team is weak to Malamar, with the added benefit of still hitting Jynx. Surf is an alternate Water-type STAB move that has perfect accuracy, unlike Hydro Pump.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Running a Modest nature with Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Lapras to hit as hard as possible and to not get left behind by the likes of Aurorus and Cacturne. Choice Specs increases Lapras's Special Attack as much as possible. Water Absorb gives Lapras the option of switching into Scald and other Water-type attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lapras should be brought in safely with offensive momentum or from a slow U-turn or Volt Switch user, such as Pelipper or Lanturn, respectively. Utilizing its great natural bulk, Lapras can usually take a neutral or sometimes even a super effective special attack from full health. Be meticulous in keeping entry hazards off the field, or else Lapras's bulk will pay the price. Before deciding which coverage move to lock Lapras into, identify which foe that resists Lapras's STAB attacks the easiest to wear down. For example, Piloswine resists both of Lapras's Ice-type STAB attacks but lacks recovery, as opposed to Roselia, which resists Water and can heal off any damage with Synthesis or Rest. Lapras can utilize its typing and ability to pivot into Water- and Ice-type attacks from the likes of Quagsire, Mantine, Vanilluxe, and Aurorus without Ancient Power.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon with momentum-grabbing moves, such as U-turn Primeape and Volt Switch Lanturn, can bring Lapras in safely. Lanturn also provides a nice immunity to Electric for Lapras. Rapid Spin or Defog support from the likes of Claydol and Pelipper keeps Spikes and Stealth Rock off the field for Lapras. Claydol and Pelipper can also switch into the Fighting-type attacks that give Lapras trouble. Bulky Poison-types, such as Garbodor and Vileplume, cover the Fighting- and Grass-types that hit Lapras super effectively. Garbodor also sets Spikes, which wears down Lapras's switch-ins.</p>"

  "Ditto": {
    "overview": "<p>Ditto is essentially a one trick pony, though it is amazing at what it does. Ditto's ability Imposter allows it to copy the foe's stat boosts, ability, and moveset upon switching in, while also making Ditto a decent scout. When given a Choice Scarf, Ditto becomes a well-rounded revenge killer, albeit one easily played around.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Using any item other than Choice Scarf defeats Ditto's main purpose as a revenge killer, leaving any matchups against opposing setup sweepers to a Speed tie. Running minimum happiness is an option to do more damage with Frustration; however, this greatly lowers the damage output of Return, should Ditto encounter it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: If the foe is behind a Substitute, Ditto won't be able to transform. However, this only works if a Substitute is set up before Ditto comes in.</p> <p><strong>Happiness variability</strong>: If Ditto locks itself into Frustration with maximum happiness or Return with minimum happiness, the attack will be pitifully weak and cause it to lose the matchup.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room</strong>: Trick Room can turn Ditto's Choice Scarf-augmented Speed against it, causing it to move after the foe it has transformed into.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Mind Games</strong>: As Ditto's Choice Scarf locks into one move, it can be played around with Pokemon that have proper resistances and immunities to its moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killing</strong>: Pokemon faster than a transformed Ditto as well as Pokemon with priority moves can usually pick off Ditto due to its low HP stat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Imposter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Transform is the only move Ditto learns, although it's quite useless because Imposter does the exact same thing as Transform without wasting a turn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs are simple: 248 HP EVs are used because HP is the only stat that transfers over after Ditto transforms, and it also hits a Stealth Rock number. 252 EVs are allocated to Defense on the off chance that a Ditto versus Ditto PP stall occurs. A Relaxed nature further improves Ditto's Defense and lowers Speed so that your Ditto will succumb to Struggle recoil later than an opposing Ditto. Setting the Attack IV to 0, Defense IV to 30, and Speed IV to 1 gives Ditto Hidden Power Ice when transforming into a Pokemon with Hidden Power and keeps Ditto's Speed and Attack as low as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The sheer presence of Ditto on your team should keep your opponent cautious when considering using setup sweepers. Watch out for opposing Choice Scarf users, as Ditto can only Speed tie with them and risks taking a lot of damage from an attack. Don't ever directly switch Ditto into an attack, as it is meant to revenge kill, not tank hits. Try to save Ditto for late-game, and don't sacrifice it unless absolutely necessary, as losing a revenge killer can be the turning point of a game, especially if the opponent still has a setup sweeper present. Ditto doesn't have the best matchup against bulkier setup Pokemon like Gurdurr and Musharna, having difficulty KOing them while receiving a huge chunk of damage in return because of its pitiful HP stat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>All Ditto really needs is to switch in safely. Because of this, Ditto fits really well on teams with slow U-turn or Volt Switch users such as Probopass, Lanturn, or Xatu, that will get Ditto in safely. Since Ditto usually transforms into a sweeper, entry hazards are appreciated.</p>"

  "Flareon": {
    "overview": "<p>Flareon's most prominent trait is its high Attack, giving it the strongest Flare Blitz in the tier. However, this is much less scary than it sounds, as NU is home to some of the physically bulkiest Fire-resistant Pokemon in the game, such as Rhydon, Carracosta, Quagsire, and Regirock. Moreover, Flareon has some glaring issues holding it back, namely its mediocre Speed, low physical bulk, and susceptibility to entry hazards. These traits not only make Flareon prone to getting forced out but also give it a hard time entering the battle healthy; this is not helped by Flareon's constant use of Flare Blitz combined with its modest HP stat wearing it down even more quickly. Flareon is also strapped for coverage options, having only Superpower as its alternative attack against most Pokemon that resist Fire. While it's not awful coverage, it is very lackluster when considering what most other Fire-types have to offer.</p> <p>Most notably, Flareon's primary issue is fierce competition with its Fire-type brethren. Flareon may have good Special Defense, but Assault Vest Magmortar performs the same role in checking most specially offensive threats while possessing better Speed, superior coverage, and an immunity to sleep moves such as Sleep Powder and Lovely Kiss. Pyroar and Ninetales also give Flareon significant competition, with the former boasting much higher base Speed and a secondary STAB move, and the latter, while it is much weaker unboosted, it has access to a boosting move and nearly perfect coverage. Between its natural downfalls and harsh competition with fellow Fire-types, Flareon very rarely warrants a spot on serious teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flareon has access to Natural Gift, which, with a Liechi Berry, becomes a 100-BP physical Grass-type attack for the likes of Rhydon, Carracosta, and Quagsire; should Natural Gift not prove necessary, Flareon can even attempt to consume Liechi Berry and make use of the Attack boost, although this will prove short lived due to Flareon's poor longevity. Additionally, this move can only be used once and thus should be used sparingly, and more importantly, it forces Flareon to forgo a power-boosting item to equip the Berry. While Flareon has a couple of status-inducing options, such as Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, and Yawn, that can mess with its counters, it should really just be breaking down foes. Flareon can use Sleep Talk to absorb sleep from the likes of Lilligant, Vivillon, and Jynx, but the more effective Vital Spirit Magmortar should be considered as an option first. Flareon may seem appealing as a Toxic Orb Guts sweeper, but Flare Blitz recoil alongside poison damage reduces Flareon's longevity even more than usual, meaning that its most used attack would often be a non-STAB Facade, at which point it would be outclassed by Normal-type Facade sweepers, such as Zangoose and Ursaring. Flareon's high Special Defense and access to Wish may suggest that it can run a specially defensive set, but its Stealth Rock weakness and lackluster HP stat prevent Flareon from doing a good job at being a passive Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-type Pokemon are major nuisances for Flareon. The likes of Pelipper, Quagsire, and Lanturn can tank its Flare Blitz and threaten it with STAB moves or even set up on it. More offensive Water-types, such as Ludicolo, Floatzel, and Samurott, do not like switching into Flare Blitz but can swiftly revenge kill Flareon. Choice Band Superpower stings all Water-types bar Pelipper on the switch, though.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: While Rock-types such as Rhydon, Carracosta, Kabutops, and Regirock are rather susceptible to Superpower, they are still massive threats to Flareon, as their STAB moves can easily punch through Flareon's low Defense while their high Defense allows them to shrug off Flare Blitz with ease.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Faster physical attackers such as Tauros, Archeops, and even Shiftry can outspeed Flareon and easily OHKO it with their powerful STAB moves. Even then, Flareon usually inches itself into KO range via Flare Blitz recoil or Superpower's Defense drops, allowing other weaker attackers, such as Earthquake Magmortar and Eviolite Scyther, to KO it sooner or later. Priority moves from the likes of Carracosta, Gurdurr, Skuntank, and Hariyama are also major problems for Flareon.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: As Flareon already wears itself down very quickly with Flare Blitz, any other form of residual damage on Flareon adds up very quickly. Entry hazard damage, especially Stealth Rock, is the most common example, but Rocky Helmet, Aftermath, and poison damage can swiftly do Flareon in as well.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz hits anything that doesn't resist Fire extremely hard; however, each use wears Flareon down extremely quickly. Superpower is Flareon's best bet against anything that resists Fire-type attacks, nailing Rock-types such as Rhydon, Regirock, and Carracosta while dealing decent damage to the likes of Lanturn and Quagsire. However, it comes at the cost of dropping Flareon's Attack and Defense. Quick Attack is used to mitigate Flareon's poor Speed, finishing off heavily weakened Pokemon that outspeed Flareon, such as Jynx, Swellow, and Floatzel.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment along with an Adamant nature allows Flareon to be as offensively threatening as possible. Flash Fire allows Flareon to switch in on Fire-type moves from the likes of Magmortar and Pyroar and gain a power boost for Flare Blitz rather than taking damage. Choice Band grants Flareon enough power to 2HKO physically defensive Mega Audino over 90% of the time with Flare Blitz as well as most bulky Pokemon that resist Fire, such as Lanturn and bulky Rhydon, with Superpower on the switch at the cost of being locked into one move. Charcoal can be considered if being locked into a move is unfavorable, but Flareon loses a very noticeable amount of power. In addition, Flareon gets forced out very often anyway, so the handicap of Choice Band usually isn't very noticeable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Flareon's main strategy is to punch holes into teams with Flare Blitz, preferably on a foe that is slower or cannot KO Flareon in return. It can be tricky to find an opening to get in safely; stray Will-O-Wisps from the likes of Gourgeist-XL and Rotom are Flareon's best bets, while Pyroar Choice-locked into a Fire-type move or Magmortar lacking Earthquake provide good opportunities as well. Flare Blitz dents anything that doesn't resist it; even bulky Pokemon such as Musharna and Mega Audino can be sent reeling from the blow. Note that the many frail Pokemon that resist Fire, such as Pyroar and Archeops, still take significant damage from Flare Blitz. Quick Attack should be used sparingly, as being Choice-locked into such a weak attack kills momentum and can give the opponent free turns. The stat drops caused by Superpower mean that it should only really be used to hit foes on the switch. Note that Flareon is essentially meant to be a kamikaze attacker, meaning that it will not last long in battle at all, so try to do as much damage to the opponent's team as possible with little regard for Flareon's longevity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Shiftry and Cacturne are useful for combating Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types for Flareon, with Shiftry having access to Defog to get rid of entry hazards for Flareon and Cacturne having Water Absorb to switch into Water-type attacks. In return, Flareon punches through bulky foes they cannot break, such as Mawile, Weezing, and Mega Audino, while even offering a switch-in to Fire-type moves thanks to Flash Fire. Flareon is a wallbreaker, so sweepers appreciate its presence, particularly those like Lilligant, Torterra, and Jynx, which have little issue with Pokemon that Flareon can struggle to bypass, namely Water- and Rock-types. Fast Pokemon in general, such as Floatzel, Tauros, and Archeops, also help patch up Flareon's unfavorable matchup against faster teams.</p> <p>Flareon can have a hard time entering the battle safely, so VoltTurn support from the likes of U-turn Scyther and Volt Switch Lanturn is recommended to give it better opportunities to start blasting the opponent's team. While not mandatory due to Flareon's already short lifespan, anti-entry hazard support can be nice to let Flareon stick around just a little bit longer. Shiftry and Kabutops can keep entry hazards off the field while maintaining strong offensive pressure, while Claydol and Xatu are bulkier alternatives that also serve as good switch-ins to Ground-type moves, as well as Rock-type moves in Claydol's case.</p>"

  "Omastar": {
    "overview": "<p>Omastar is one of the most flexible Water-types in the tier, able to run both defensive and offensive sets successfully and fitting on both offensive and balanced team archetypes. Having access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes means it can fulfil a team's need for entry hazard support entirely on its own, and its excellent Defense and Special Attack stats give it many switch in opportunities and a good matchup against many anti-hazard Pokemon, such as Kabutops, Pelipper, and Xatu that lack Grass Knot. Meanwhile, Shell Smash and Swift Swim make offensive sets extremely deadly and give Omastar pride of place as one of the best rain sweepers available, with its aforementioned Defense making it difficult to revenge kill with most priority attacks. However, its low initial Speed, Special Defense, and crippling 4x weakness to Grass-type attacks, alongside weaknesses to common Electric-, Fighting-, and Ground-type moves, make it fairly easy to force out when it does not have a Speed boost. This results in Omastar relying on strong team support to make the most of its defensive and offensive attributes outside of early-game. Furthermore, Omastar faces competition as a sweeper from Barbaracle and Kabutops, which have better Speed tiers and boast different coverage options.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ancient Power is Omastar's strongest special Rock-type attack, but it doesn't hit many targets significantly harder than Omastar's Water-type moves aside from Jynx and Lapras. Hidden Power Rock has more PP than Ancient Power, but it has no chance to boost Omastar's stats and is inferior to Hidden Power Electric against Mantine and Pelipper. Hidden Power Grass has the advantage of hitting both Lanturn and most other Water-types for decent damage, but it has no utility against Mantine and Pelipper, which can otherwise force Omastar out and remove its entry hazards. Knock Off can be used to deal with threats such as Jynx, Ferroseed, and Cryogonal as well as removing items from other checks such as Lanturn, which is especially useful for the defensive set. Toxic is also a decent option for the defensive set, crippling bulky foes and setup sweepers such as Mega Audino and Musharna, but it doesn't really capitalize on Omastar's great Special Attack stat and it makes Omastar very vulnerable to Vileplume. A Choice Specs set can be pretty good on rain teams, as it'll probably just use Surf repeatedly anyways, and the extra coverage it can run in the fourth moveslot can make it harder to check with standard responses. Custap Berry can be used to guarantee Omastar an extra layer of entry hazards, but it is inconsistent as the easiest way to deal with Omastar is just to OHKO it outright with a Grass-type move or suitably powerful special attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Almost any Grass-type Pokemon can switch into Omastar's Water-type attacks, outspeed it, and threaten it back with an easy OHKO, although they have to watch out for Ice Beam. Ludicolo is 4x resistant to Water-type attacks and neutral to Ice Beam, and it can set up Rain Dance and sweep. Lilligant and Abomasnow can also capitalize on a forced switch by either setting up or landing a heavy attack on a teammate, with the latter even cancelling out rain and shutting down a Swift Swim team's strategy. Ferroseed can also wall Omastar and be a nuisance with Leech Seed and Toxic, possibly stalling out Rain.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Water</strong>: Omastar's biggest threat lies in its powerful Water-type attacks, and Cradily and Cacturne can switch into them with impunity and force Omastar out with their Grass-type attacks, although they should watch out for Ice Beams. Mantine and Poliwrath also beat most sets that lack Hidden Power Electric, while Jynx can deal with any set that doesn't run Rock-type STAB or a physical coverage move, putting Omastar to sleep with Lovely Kiss and setting up Nasty Plot or KOing with Focus Blast. Gastrodon can switch into Water-type attacks with ease but dislikes switching into boosted Ice Beams.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: While they might not be able to switch into the Shell Smash set directly, some particularly bulky Pokemon can take a boosted hit and KO Omastar back. Assault Vest Lanturn and Hariyama can take a boosted Hydro Pump and retaliate with their super effective STAB attacks. Meanwhile, Prinplup can easily deal with either entry hazard set and use Defog to remove Omastar's progress without being pressured by it too much.</p> <p><strong>Faster Special Attackers</strong>: If Omastar lacks a Speed boost, its low special bulk ensures that it is easily KOed by powerful special attacks. Rotom and other Electric-types can seize momentum with Volt Switch, with Choice Scarf Rotom outspeeding even +2 Omastar, while wallbreakers such as Assault Vest Magmortar and Shiftry can force it out with their coverage options if Omastar lacks a Speed boost.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Priority Attacks</strong>: If Shell Smash Omastar doesn't run White Herb or a Chople Berry, it is susceptible to being revenge killed by super effective priority attacks. Hitmonchan can OHKO it after a defense drop with Life Orb Mach Punch, while Choice Specs Poliwrath can switch into Surf and hit back with Vacuum Wave before being hit by a boosted Hidden Power Electric.</p>",

      "Defensive Entry Hazards": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock damages any Pokemon that switches in and particularly limits foes such as Scyther, Vivillon, and Charizard from entering battle repeatedly. It also punishes many entry hazard removers, such as Mantine and Pelipper, that might want to remove entry hazards later. Spikes damages any grounded Pokemon regardless of their typing and can be stacked up to three times to make it easier for offensive teammates such as Swellow and Primeape to clean up or sweep. Toxic Spikes cripples defensive threats such as Hariyama and Gourgeist-XL and provides teams with a countermeasure against bulky setup sweepers such as Mega Audino and Musharna. Scald has a good chance to burn the physical attackers that Omastar can deal with, such as Garbodor, Kangaskhan, and Steelix. Scald also lets Omastar potentially inflict status on Xatu if it tries to switch in. Protect is also an option to let Omastar scout for potential coverage moves or to ease prediction against Choice item users, such as Choice Specs Pyroar, while also providing Omastar with another turn of Leftovers recovery. On the other hand, Icy Wind lets Omastar hit Grass-types that attempt to switch in for decent damage, particularly frail ones such as Shiftry and Lilligant. It also slows down offensive Pokemon that try to stop Omastar from setting entry hazards, so that a slow teammate such as Magmortar can switch in and hit them back hard. Ice Beam is a more powerful alternative that deals more damage to Xatu in particular, and it can 2HKO Vileplume after Stealth Rock with 40 Special Attack EVs, but it doesn't provide the speed control for teammates that Icy Wind provides. Toxic lets Omastar cripple common switch-ins such as Gastrodon, Lanturn, and Mantine.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum defensive investment makes Omastar as physically bulky as possible, letting it check many physical attackers such as bulky Charizard, Kangaskhan, and Tauros while taking non-STAB Earthquakes with ease. Leftovers is usually the best item choice to compensate for Omastar's lack of reliable recovery, but a Shuca Berry or Chople Berry can be used to let Omastar tank a hit from the likes of Rhydon and Primeape to strike back with a decently powerful Scald. Shell Armor prevents Omastar from being KOed unexpectedly by a critical hit. Swift Swim is less useful, as Omastar is too slow to outspeed most offensive foes without any investment, even at +2 Speed. Weak Armor makes Omastar much worse at handling physical attackers and should be saved for a more offensive entry hazards set that can better capitalize on the increased Speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used as a defensive pivot that can switch into physical attackers and force them out, either setting up entry hazards for its team or using its attacking moves to cripple physical attackers or potential anti-hazard Pokemon. If the opponent has a Grass-type Pokemon, early-game it's often best to set up a hazard and switch out to a teammate that can deal with them better, such as Assault Vest Magmortar. After you've set up all the entry hazards you want, Omastar should use Icy Wind as they switch in to inflict chip damage and let a teammate outspeed them after switching in, or just spam Scald if the opponent lacks a Grass-type threat or sponge such as Sliggoo. Against teams where the opponent has many Pokemon weak to Rock-type attacks, Omastar should set Stealth Rock before doing anything else, especially if they have a 4x-weak member such as Charizard or Scyther. Otherwise, Spikes should generally be Omastar's first priority, unless the opponent has many non-grounded Pokemon such as Mesprit and Mismagius. One layer of Toxic Spikes is usually sufficient for crippling offensive teams, so unless the opponent has a bulky setup sweeper such as Musharna that you want to stop at all costs, Omastar shouldn't bother setting a second layer over Stealth Rock or hitting something with Scald. Toxic Spikes also shouldn't be used while the opponent has a grounded Poison-type, unless you want to force them to bring it in so that a teammate such as Mesprit or Musharna can capitalize on it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spinblockers are highly appreciated for preventing Omastar's entry hazards from being removed by Rapid Spin. Mismagius and Rotom are both great choices for balanced teams, with the former being able to take special attacks more easily and the latter being able to pivot into Electric-types that threaten Omastar and pivot back out with Volt Switch. Cleaners and other offensive Pokemon appreciate having multiple hazard layers up to wear down foes into KO range. Swellow's Boomburst in particular becomes a lot more dangerous when switch-ins take damage from both Stealth Rock and Spikes, while wallbreakers such as Magmortar and Abomasnow can secure KOs more easily with defensive checks being weakened by the entry hazards. Vileplume is a particularly good partner, as it can switch into Grass-types that force Omastar out and threaten them with a strong Sludge Bomb. Meanwhile, Omastar appreciates Toxic Spikes being removed from its own side of the field and can switch into Flying-type attacks that threaten Vileplume. Faster Grass-types such as Lilligant and Shiftry are also useful for forcing opposing Water-types out, which can otherwise usually break past Omastar's mediocre special bulk. Pokemon that discourage Defog can also be useful, albeit only indirectly. Malamar gains increased Evasion if Defog is used on it, making it easier to set up and sweep; Primeape and Pawniard gain an Attack boost from switching into the move, but they must watch out for Scalds from the likes of Pelipper and Mantine. If Icy Wind is being used, powerful offensive threats that can take advantage of slowed Pokemon, such as Charizard and Kangaskhan, also make good teammates, both of which also appreciate Toxic Spikes for stalling out foes with Roost or Fake Out.</p>"

      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash allows Omastar to set up and become a huge threat very quickly, both under and out of rain. It gives Omastar the Speed to outspeed most foes outside of fast Choice Scarf users, and absolutely everything in rain if desired. Surf is reliable and deals high damage, and its consistency is generally preferred to Hydro Pump's higher Base Power due to Omastar's immense power at +2 or during rain. However, Hydro Pump has a better chance at OHKOing foes such as Assault Vest Hariyama at +2 with a Life Orb. Ice Beam is required to hit Grass- and Dragon-types and prevent them from stopping Omastar's sweep; at +2 it can let Omastar break through even bulky tanks such as Vileplume and Sliggoo that could otherwise beat Omastar. Hidden Power Grass lets Omastar break through Gastrodon, Poliwrath, and Lanturn. Hidden Power Electric is an alternative that still maintains coverage on most Water-types, but additionally lets Omastar break through Mantine and Pelipper, while Earth Power allows Omastar to hit Lanturn harder after a boost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Modest nature lets Omastar outspeed most unboosted Pokemon after a Shell Smash or during rain. The extra damage output of a Modest nature lets Omastar run an item to make setup easier instead of being forced to run Life Orb. However, a Timid nature and a Life Orb can be more useful for Omastar on rain teams, as they let it outspeed +1 Mesprit, +1 Vivillon, and +1 Timid Lilligant variants that run Hidden Power Rock or Fire, while Speed tying with other Timid Lilligant, without a Shell Smash boost. Furthermore, the power boost from Life Orb allows Omastar to clean reliably with Surf during rain without needing a Shell Smash boost in most circumstances. The remaining EVs are invested in Special Attack to boost Omastar's damage output as much as possible. Shuca Berry allows Omastar to set up on Pokemon that use Ground-type coverage, such as Kangaskhan and Tauros, as well as weaker Ground-types such as Steelix. White Herb allows Omastar to preserve its defenses after a Shell Smash, making it less susceptible to priority attackers such as Hitmonchan and Shiftry, as well as threats that still outspeed Omastar after a boost, such as Choice Scarf Scyther. Swift Swim is the best ability for this set, as this set will generally be used on rain teams and this ability allows Omastar to sweep without setting up if desired. Even on non-weather teams, Swift Swim allows for counterplay against opposing rain teams. Weak Armor can be used for even more Speed, but it makes Omastar very susceptible to being revenge killed by priority attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>On weatherless teams, this set should generally be saved for late-game, where Omastar can seize opportunities to set up and sweep without being blocked by something like Lanturn, Mantine, or Poliwrath. Early-game, Omastar can pivot into resisted attacks and force foes out with the threat of Shell Smash and powerful special attacks, so that you can double switch Omastar into the appropriate teammate. If it runs Shuca Berry, Omastar can pivot into Rock Climb from Tauros or Fake Out from Kangaskhan and set up as they try and fail to KO Omastar with Earthquake. Meanwhile, when Omastar is used on rain teams, it should only enter battle on these teams after a teammate such as Liepard or Mesprit sets Rain Dance and pivots out, or if it can switch into a resisted physical move such as Scyther's Aerial Ace. Omastar will rarely need to use Shell Smash against offensive teams under rain and is usually better off just firing off a boosted Surf or a coverage move. However, Shell Smash can be used to break through very bulky threats such as Sliggoo or to bypass Sucker Punches with good prediction to potentially continue a sweep after rain expires.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Memento can be used to give Omastar guaranteed setup opportunities late-game. Mismagius and Skuntank can provide reliable Memento support due to their good Speed stats, making Omastar less susceptible to revenge killers, especially in combination with White Herb. Omastar's main advantage over other Shell Smash users and rain sweepers, such as Barbaracle and Kabutops, respectively, is its enormous Special Attack stat, so make sure to pair it with physical attackers such as Tauros and Archeops that can break through specially defensive tanks such as Hariyama. On rain teams, a fast Rain Dance user such as Liepard or Electrode should be used so that rain can be set up in last-resort situations to allow Omastar to revenge kill certain foes, or to give Omastar a crucial sweeping opportunity late-game. A bulky Rain Dance user such as Mesprit should also be used to set weather reliably early-game and give Omastar more chances to wallbreak for teammates. Other rain sweepers such as Kabutops, Ludicolo, Mantine, and Poliwrath should be used to overwhelm the opponent's Water-type checks with their STAB attacks and different coverage options. Mesprit is a particularly good teammate, as it can also provide Stealth Rock support, resists Fighting-type attacks, and can use a slow U-turn to bring Omastar in safely or Healing Wish to give it a second chance at sweeping later in the match. This also applies to non-rain teams that use the standard defensive pivot.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Entry Hazards": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock damages any Pokemon that switches in and punishes many entry hazard removers, such as Mantine and Pelipper, that might want to remove entry hazards later. Spikes damages most grounded Pokemon regardless of their typing and can be stacked up to three times to make it easier for offensive teammates to clean up or sweep. Scald is very powerful with some offensive investment and difficult to switch into unless your opponent has a Water-type immunity such as Cradily or a bulky status absorber such as Malamar. Hydro Pump is an alternative that has much more power and can OHKO many offensive Pokemon that Omastar outspeeds after a Weak Armor boost, such as Vivillon, Haunter, and bulky Charizard. Ice Beam is Omastar's most powerful and consistent coverage option, letting it KO Grass-types that try to stop it after it gets a Weak Armor boost or as they switch in. Icy Wind is less powerful but lets Omastar hit targets such as Tauros and Liepard and outspeed them after the combination of Omastar's Speed boost and their Speed drop. It also provides team support for slower wallbreakers and more opportunities for Omastar to set entry hazards. Hidden Power Electric is an option that targets opposing Water-types, especially hazard removers such as Mantine, Pelipper, and Prinplup. Toxic Spikes cripples defensive threats such as Hariyama and Gourgeist-XL but is generally ill-suited to a suicide lead, as any team with a grounded Poison-type can quickly remove them early-game. However, it is useful for supporting certain threats, such as Kangaskhan and Hex users.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is used so that Omastar can outspeed foes such as Mismagius and Pyroar after a Speed boost from Weak Armor, letting it either set an extra layer of entry hazards before being hit by Taunt or KOed or hit back with a powerful attack of its own. The rest of the EVs are placed in Special Attack to give Omastar's attacks more power, letting it OHKO foes such as Pyroar with Scald, Vivillon with Ice Beam, or Liepard with Hydro Pump. Focus Sash is the best item choice, as it usually guarantees that Omastar can set an extra Spikes layer if it leads or has sufficient Rapid Spin support, and it lets Omastar tank hits from Grass-types if necessary. Weak Armor is used so that Omastar can outspeed physical attackers such as Scyther and Kangaskhan after tanking a hit from them, setting up an extra layer of entry hazards before being KOed or getting a surprise KO as a result.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used as a lead to preserve Omastar's Focus Sash, usually letting it set up at least two layers of entry hazards so that offensive sweepers and cleaners can do their jobs more easily later on. It's generally unwise to run all three entry hazards together on this set, as Omastar will rarely be able to stay in long enough to set them all, and it becomes too passive to deal with anti-hazard Pokemon, such as Mantine or Pelipper, or other threats such as Vileplume. If the opponent packs a reliable Defog user such as Prinplup, it is rarely worth Omastar's time to set up entry hazards if they can be easily removed later, so Omastar probably shouldn't lead in these circumstances and if Omastar is brought in it may be worthwhile to double switch to a teammate that can quickly deal with the Defog user. Weak Armor should be used either from the lead position so that Omastar can set more entry hazards against leads such as Scyther, or so that Omastar can grab a Speed boost by switching into a weak physical attack such as U-turn or even Rapid Spin, potentially forcing out a normally-faster threat or preventing one from coming in after U-turn. Omastar can stay in against Grass-types if the opponent has no hazard removal and you only want two layers of entry hazards, but only do this if you are certain you won't need more entry hazards or Omastar's type resistances later.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is best paired with offensive Pokemon that require consistent entry hazard support to secure KOs. Choice Specs Swellow and Silk Scarf Kangaskhan highly appreciate entry hazards chipping away responses until they fall into KO range, with Toxic Spikes working particularly well with Kangaskhan's Fake Out. Meanwhile, offensive Grass- and Electric-types such as Lilligant and Manectric also appreciate the residual damage on checks and can force out Defog users such as Prinplup that try to remove Omastar's entry hazards. Offensive spinblockers are mandatory teammates to prevent these entry hazards being removed after Omastar has potentially sacrificed itself to lay them, as this set doesn't have the bulk to switch into battle repeatedly. Mismagius, Haunter, and Rotom are all good options that can also capitalize on Toxic Spikes with powerful Hexes, with Mismagius being able to block Defog with Taunt and Rotom having a particularly good matchup against the common Water-type Defog users. Offensive pivots such as Choice Band Scyther and Choice Scarf Rotom can force foes to switch in and out continually to deal with them, racking up damage from the entry hazards that Omastar sets. Defiant teammates such as Malamar and Primeape can also deter Defog users from removing Omastar's entry hazards by gaining increased evasiveness and Attack from the move, respectively. If Omastar lacks Toxic Spikes, Poison-types such as Garbodor, Weezing, and Roselia can provide them to complete the full set of entry hazards and make threats such as Kangaskhan and Fake Out Hariyama even more dangerous.</p>"

  "Kabutops": {
    "overview": "<p>Kabutops has an excellent offensive STAB combination, allowing it to hit most of the tier for neutral damage. It is also one of the only two relevant Aqua Jet users in the tier, which allows it to revenge kill fast Pokemon such as Archeops and Pyroar, which may otherwise threaten Kabutops with their coverage moves. While Kabutops's typing is really good offensively, it's below average defensively, leaving Kabutops weak to common types such as Grass, Ground, and Fighting. It also isn't that bulky, which makes it somewhat difficult to set up or spin and limits the usefulness of its resistances to Normal and Flying.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off allows Kabutops to hit Gourgeist-XL as well as remove items from walls that commonly switch into it, such as Gastrodon and Ferroseed. Giga Drain, while coming off of Kabutops's weaker attacking stat, can help it lure in and defeat Gastrodon, paving a way for Kabutops to beat the opponent. Stealth Rock can take advantage of Kabutops's ability to force switches; however, Kabutops is better off launching an attack or setting up. Assault Vest can patch up Kabutops's weaker defensive stat, but the increase in bulk doesn't make up for the lack of power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gastrodon</strong>: Gastrodon is a hard counter due to being immune to Waterfall with Storm Drain and its resistance to Stone Edge. Additionally, Gastrodon has access to Recover, as well as Clear Smog to negate any stat boosts attained.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Ferroseed, Gourgeist-XL, and Torterra can wear Kabutops down with Life Orb recoil and Iron Barbs in Ferroseed's case, and with reliable recovery in the last two's case. They also have 4x super effective STAB moves to make sure Kabutops goes down.</p> <p><strong>Fast Pokemon That Resist Water</strong>: Jynx and Lilligant either are immune to or can tank Kabutops's Aqua Jet, and they can hit back with a super effective Focus Blast in Jynx's case and STAB Giga Drain in Lilligant's case. However, neither of them can switch into Stone Edge and must also be wary of its Choice Scarf set.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fighting-types</strong>: Gurdurr and Poliwrath resist Stone Edge and can use their super effective STAB moves to punish Kabutops. Hitmonchan has access to priority in Mach Punch, while Poliwrath's Water Absorb makes it immune to Kabutops's Water-type moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Kabutops's Attack to high levels. Stone Edge provides good neutral coverage, hitting common Pokemon such as Magmortar and Xatu hard. Aqua Jet gives Kabutops priority to pick off faster Pokemon such as Archeops, Pyroar, and +2 Rhydon. Waterfall gives Kabutops a secondary, more reliable Water-type STAB move that helps break bulky teams and hits Ground- and Fighting-types such as Claydol, Rhydon, and Hariyama harder than any other move Kabutops has. Rapid Spin can be used over Swords Dance if in dire need of hazard control. Superpower can be used in the fourth moveslot instead to hit Ferroseed, Cradily, and Poliwrath, as these Pokemon tank Kabutops's STAB moves with ease.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Swift Swim allows Kabutops to function on or against rain teams. Weak Armor can be used instead for a Speed boost to have an easier time sweeping, but it makes it more difficult to set up after repeated physical hits. Life Orb gives Kabutops extra power, while Lum Berry provides Kabutops with protection against status from defensive Pokemon. A Jolly nature allows Kabutops to get the jump on neutral-natured base 85 Speed Pokemon and below, such as Pinsir and Shiftry, while an Adamant nature gives Kabutops more power, and Kabutops can circumvent not outspeeding those threats with a more powerful Aqua Jet.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Set up mid-game to break balanced teams or late-game to clean offensive teams. Try to spin on Pokemon that Kabutops can force out, because it isn't bulky enough to survive much. Save Kabutops for its priority when necessary; otherwise, you can play more recklessly with it. Kabutops can come in on Fire-types such as Pyroar and Magmortar easily and force them out with its STAB moves. Faster Pokemon that are weak to Kabutops's Aqua Jet such as Archeops or frail threats, such as Liepard and Swellow, can be forced out as well.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Healing Wish support from Mesprit or Lilligant allows Kabutops to essentially set up twice in one game, as it can break teams down early-game and sweep late-game. It also allows Kabutops to play more recklessly throughout the match. Pokemon weak to entry hazards, such as Scyther and Pyroar, appreciate the Rapid Spin support Kabutops can provide. Strong special attackers such as Magmortar, Pyroar, and even Skuntank can pressure physical walls, such as Ferroseed and Gastrodon, allowing Kabutops to set up and sweep. Toxic Spikes support from Garbodor or Weezing is amazing as well because most of Kabutops's best checks, such as Gastrodon and Poliwrath, are crippled by the entry hazard.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Waterfall is the most reliable Water-type STAB move Kabutops gets, hitting most targets that don't resist it hard, as well as having a decent flinch chance. Stone Edge is Kabutops's most powerful STAB move, hitting most Pokemon that resist Waterfall extremely hard, such as Lilligant, Samurott, Jynx, Lanturn, Mantine, Pelipper, and Ludicolo. Rapid Spin allows Kabutops to get off an emergency spin at the cost of potentially sacrificing itself. Superpower rounds out Kabutops's coverage, hitting Pokemon that take little from its STAB moves such as Ferroseed and Cradily super effectively while also hitting Poliwrath neutrally. Alternatively, Knock Off is an option to hit Gourgeist-XL as well as remove items from walls that commonly switch into it, such as Gastrodon and Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Scarf allows Kabutops to outspeed Pokemon it would normally get forced out by, such as Lilligant, Jynx, Rotom, and Zangoose. An Adamant nature gives Kabutops more power while still enabling it to outspeed the entire unboosted tier. A Jolly nature lets Kabutops outspeed +2 Jolly Rhydon, Modest Omastar, and Adamant Golurk, as well as +1 Modest Lilligant; however, it generally isn't worth the noticeable drop in power. Lastly, with Swift Swim Kabutops outspeeds all rain sweepers, including Ludicolo, Floatzel, and opposing Jolly Kabutops, and is able to OHKO them with the appropriate coverage move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its high Speed with a Choice Scarf, great coverage, and STAB combination that allows it to hit a majority of the tier for at least neutral damage, Kabutops's main role is that of a revenge killer. Kabutops's solid defensive typing allows it to pivot into predicted Fire-, Rock-, and Normal-type attacks when necessary. Sometimes getting off an emergency Rapid Spin can be crucial and can relieve the pressure of entry hazards from Kabutops's teammates. Unfortunately, being locked into Rapid Spin comes with the risk of becoming setup fodder once the opponent realizes Kabutops is holding a Choice Scarf, so it should be used with caution.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong special attackers such as Magmortar, Charizard, and Pyroar can pressure physical walls such as Ferroseed, Mega Audino, Gourgeist-XL, and Gastrodon, clearing the way for Kabutops to clean up late-game. In return, they appreciate Kabutops's ability to spin away hazards and take out Rock-, Fire-, and Ground-types for them. Slower wallbreakers such as Pinsir, Haunter, and Magmortar particularly appreciate Choice Scarf Kabutops's Speed and utility in beating faster Pokemon such as Swellow, Archeops, and Tauros. Setup sweepers such as Cacturne, Vivillon, Lilligant, and Rhydon value Choice Scarf Kabutops's ability to clean up late-game after they go down. In particular, Cacturne makes for a decent partner, setting up Spikes to further weaken Kabutops's checks. Toxic Spikes support from Garbodor or Weezing is amazing as well because most of Kabutops's best checks, such as Gastrodon and Poliwrath, are crippled by the entry hazard. Bulky Psychic-types such as Mesprit, Musharna, and Xatu are great partners, combatting any Fighting- and Poison-types for Kabutops. Xatu especially makes for a great partner, forming a consistent anti-hazard core.</p>"

  "Articuno": {
    "overview": "<p>Articuno's typing is excellent offensively, allowing it to hit the majority of the tier neutrally with its STAB moves except for Steel-types. Articuno also has access to the rare Freeze-Dry, which allows it to hit Water-types super effectively and makes it even harder to switch into. Articuno's natural special bulk along with its access to Roost also allows it to act as a decent pivot, switching into weak special hits and then threatening the foe out. On the other hand, Ice / Flying is not good defensively, as Articuno has a variety of weaknesses and loses half of its health if it switches into Stealth Rock. On top of this, Articuno's Speed is somewhat average, which means that it is outpaced by common offensive threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Agility can be used to turn Articuno into a dedicated late-game cleaner against offensive teams. A set running an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature, Substitute, and Toxic in combination with Pressure can wear down a lot of bulky teams by PP stalling their only ways to break Articuno's Substitute while whittling them down with Toxic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock strips 50% of Articuno's HP upon switching in and effectively neutralizes all of the switching that Articuno wants to do. Common Stealth Rock setters include Rhydon, Golurk, and Mawile.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Offensive pressure from Pokemon such as Pyroar, Magmortar, Archeops, and Rotom can force Articuno out. However, most of these Pokemon can't switch directly into Articuno, as they will risk taking a lot of damage.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Regirock, Musharna, and Lanturn can all switch into Articuno's attacks and take little damage in return. They can all also threaten Articuno out with their STAB moves or use it as setup fodder. However, they have to be careful of switching in on U-turn and subsequently losing momentum.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Offensive Fire-types such as Pyroar can take a Hurricane and proceed to OHKO Articuno back with Fire Blast. Other Fire-types such as Assault Vest Magmortar can take multiple hits, and Articuno has to rely on hitting multiple Hurricanes in order to break through them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Burd (Offensive)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Freeze-Dry is one of the main draws of using Articuno, as it gives it nearly perfect neutral coverage, hitting Water-types such as Lanturn and Kabutops super effectively. Hurricane is a more powerful STAB move that hits Pokemon that resist Ice, such as Thick Fat Hariyama, Magmortar, and Piloswine. Roost is used for recovery on sets that utilize a Life Orb, while Ice Beam is used as a more powerful alternative to Freeze-Dry. U-turn is used to gain momentum early-game, pivoting out of Pokemon that Articuno can't break, and it also has the added benefit of hitting Malamar. Substitute in conjunction with Roost can be used to Pressure stall foes. Hidden Power Fire can be used over U-turn, as it targets common Steel-types that switch into Articuno like Klinklang, Ferroseed, and Mawile.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs are used to maximize Articuno's Speed and power. Life Orb is used to increase Articuno's damage output and afford it the ability to switch moves. Choice Specs can be used for even more power at the cost of locking Articuno into a move. Using a Timid nature allows Articuno to outspeed Adamant Kangaskhan and positive-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Mesprit and Kabutops, as well as Speed tie with Jolly Pinsir.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Articuno should be used to force switches, as its STAB moves threaten the majority of the tier, but it usually can't OHKO foes early-game. Bring it in on foes that can't do too much back or that Articuno threatens out such as Ludicolo, Poliwrath, and Vileplume. You then have two options: either use the appropriate STAB move or, if the opponent has a specially bulky Pokemon such as Mega Audino or Regirock, use U-turn to gain momentum. After the opponent's special walls have been weakened enough, just use Articuno's STAB moves accordingly. Roost can be used on predicted switches to gain back health, as well as on relatively weak special attacks due to Articuno's good bulk. Set up a Substitute agsinst weak defensive Pokemon that cannot break Articuno's Substitute or Pokemon that Articuno forces out such as Misdreavus, Prinplup, Gourgeist-Super, and Quagsire. Because Articuno has relatively good special bulk, you can use it as a pivot, switching in on special attackers and then using U-turn for momentum. Having Stealth Rock off the field is pretty much mandatory before bringing Articuno in, as one round of Life Orb recoil means it can't switch back in after Stealth Rock, so if you need to bring it in to force a switch, you can click Roost instead of attacking to save Articuno for the late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A Defogger such as Prinplup or a spinner such as Claydol is pretty much required when using Articuno, as it is 4x weak to Stealth Rock. Prinplup also appreciates Articuno's ability to check Grass-types, and Claydol can threaten Rock- and Steel-types for Articuno. Shiftry and Sandslash are also good options for this role, as they can additionally break through common Steel-types such as Klinklang and Probopass, which Articuno has a hard time dealing with. Xatu in particular provides a much-needed Stealth Rock deterrent due to Magic Bounce. Unfortunately, Articuno's and Xatu's typings clash, so having a Pokemon immune to Electric such as Lanturn or Rhydon is a good idea. Lanturn and Rhydon are also nice switch-ins to Fire-type moves. Because Articuno has a tough time dealing with Steel-types, Pokemon that can break through them such as Gurdurr, Hariyama, and Magmortar make for great teammates. Another option is to use Articuno on a rain team for its perfectly accurate Hurricane and decent matchup against other rain teams; common Pokemon on rain teams include Ludicolo, Kabutops, Liepard, and Mesprit. Toxic Spike users such as Garbodor and Weezing can wear down Articuno's checks, giving it an easier time PP stalling foes if it is running Substitute.</p>"

  "Lanturn": {
    "overview": "<p>Lanturn boasts a fantastic typing and an amazing ability in Volt Absorb, which grant it a huge variety of resistances, namely to Fire, Water, Ice, Flying, and Steel, plus an immunity to Electric. Moreover, it has excellent utility moves in Scald, Volt Switch, and Heal Bell, making it one of the best supportive pivots in the tier. It even has a workable offensive movepool coupled with decent neutral coverage, which grants it a mild offensive niche. However, while Lanturn's HP stat is huge, its remaining stats are pretty unimpressive. It doesn't have reliable recovery either, and its large HP stat works against it when it comes to healing via Wish, so it can be awkward to help keep it going. While Lanturn has only a few weaknesses in Grass and Ground, they happen to be quite common coverage moves on various Pokemon in NU, particularly Earthquake from the likes of Magmortar, Electivire, and Archeops, which will do a number on Lanturn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest + Sleep Talk allows Lanturn to fully restore itself while retaining its ability to function while asleep at the cost of taking up moveslots that would have allowed Lanturn to support its team better. However, Lanturn benefits greatly from being able to choose when to use Scald or Volt Switch. ChestoRest is an alternative to RestTalk, though forgoing Leftovers is less than favorable. Discharge can be used to paralyze the foe, but it can clash with the more useful burn effect of Scald, plus Lanturn can already guarantee paralysis with Thunder Wave. Soak turns the target into a pure Water-type, removing their STAB to their attacks and rendering them vulnerable to Lanturn's Electric-type moves, but this effect can be reset by switching out, and Lanturn is too slow to effectively pull this off. Agility speeds Lanturn up, although its lackluster power can hold its sweeping potential back. Lanturn has access to the ability Water Absorb, but trading a Water resistance for an immunity is usually not worth being hit by Electric moves for neutral damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types resist both of Lanturn's STAB moves and threaten back with their own STAB attacks in kind. Grass-types such as Shiftry, Lilligant, Ludicolo, Abomasnow, Vileplume, and Exeggutor can deal massive damage to Lanturn, while certain Grass-types such as Water Absorb Cacturne and Torterra can even switch in for free on one of Lanturn's STAB moves. However, the possibility of a Scald burn or a coverage move can give most of them pause.</p> <p><strong>Gastrodon</strong>: Gastrodon prevents Lanturn from maintaining offensive momentum with Volt Switch and gains a Special Attack boost when hit by Scald due to Storm Drain. Additionally, Gastrodon can hit Lanturn with either Earthquake or Earth Power, dealing significant damage. However, Gastrodon is crippled by Toxic, which is commonly seen on defensive sets, and is 2HKOed by Hidden Power Grass from more offensive variants.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Lanturn's less than desirable Defense stat leaves it vulnerable to a wide variety of physical attackers in the tier, such as Tauros and Kangaskhan. Chief amongst these threats are Ground-type Pokemon or even just Ground-type moves in general. While most Ground-types can find it tricky to switch into Lanturn due to the threat of Scald, they can try to switch in on Volt Switch and smack Lanturn with a STAB Earthquake to the face, though said Ground-type needs to be faster to attempt this. Non-STAB Earthquakes from attackers such as Tauros, Archeops, Magmortar, and Electivire can also leave a sizable dent in Lanturn. However, most attackers need to be wary of Scald and Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: If all else fails, Lanturn's lack of reliable recovery should be taken advantage of. While Heal Bell means status ailments such as burn and poison have limited effectiveness on Lanturn, Lanturn's inability to heal would prompt it to use Heal Bell immediately, making for a decent distraction to pull off a safe switch. Entry hazards can cut Lanturn's Volt Switching sprees short, hurting it repeatedly upon reentry. Leech Seed can also recover a lot of health for the recipient due to Lanturn's large HP stat.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is a reliable Water-type attack that can induce burns to wear down foes. Hydro Pump is Lanturn's strongest attack, trading Scald's utility for hole-punching capability by dealing a solid chunk to non-resistant foes. Volt Switch offers Lanturn an Electric-type STAB move and serves as a pivoting move to allow frailer teammates to enter battle safely. Ice Beam deters Grass-types such as Lilligant, Cacturne, and Exeggutor from switching into Lanturn easily. Hidden Power Fire nails Ferroseed as well as Abomasnow, which otherwise shrugs off all of Lanturn's attacks. Hidden Power Grass primarily targets Gastrodon, which otherwise walls this set, but it also hits opposing Lanturn. Thunderbolt can be used for an alternative Electric-type STAB move that doesn't force Lanturn out. Signal Beam can be used to hit Malamar in exchange for missing out on some Grass-types such as Vileplume and Gourgeist.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment and a Modest nature give Lanturn's attacks a much-needed punch. 124 Speed EVs allow Lanturn to outspeed Jolly Rhydon and Adamant Aggron as well as Malamar factoring the drop in Speed from Hidden Power Fire, letting Lanturn get chip damage on Malamar with Volt Switch without having to eat a Superpower, while keeping ahead of Mantine. Proportionally low Special Defense compared to its HP means that Special Defense investment should be prioritized over HP; thus, the remaining EVs are dumped into Special Defense. Splitting up EV investment between Special Defense and Defense is an option if one wants a better Klinklang check, although this can noticeably impact Lanturn's ability to tank most special attacks. Assault Vest is used to allow Lanturn to take strong special hits much better within a brief period of time.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Lanturn variant makes use of its resistances to switch into foes and pivot away with Volt Switch or smack the foe with its decently strong attacks. It functions as a bulky pivot with offensive presence, gaining offensive momentum for its faster teammates while softening the foe up with its good neutral coverage. Volt Switch is very safe to spam due to the scarcity of Electric-immune targets that aren't threatened by Water-type attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The mix between bulk and strength of this Lanturn variant make it a neat fit on more balanced teams. Fast attackers such as Tauros, Pyroar, and Archeops appreciate the safe switches granted by Lanturn, allowing them to enter battle much more frequently. Flying-types and Grass-types can make use of Lanturn's pivoting while complementing each other defensively as well as offensively. Flying-types such as Swellow, Scyther, and Archeops can take out and threaten Grass-types while Lanturn protects them from Electric-, Water-, and Ice-type attacks (bar Freeze-Dry) and takes out bulky Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon for them. Grass-types such as Lilligant, Ludicolo, Cacturne, and Exeggutor can swiftly beat the Ground-types that can give Lanturn trouble; Lanturn in turn resists Fire- and Ice-type moves for them and targets problematic Flying- and Steel-types.</p>"

      "Supportive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald can burn foes and deters physical attackers from waltzing in. Volt Switch allows Lanturn to pivot, using its bulk and low Speed to send its frailer teammates into battle without them having to take a hit. Against slower foes, it instead allows Lanturn to do chip damage while making the switch. Heal Bell allows Lanturn to cleanse its teammates and itself from status. This is especially useful for Lanturn, as it is commonly subjected to burns and poison. Toxic cripples opposing defensive Pokemon such as Musharna, Gourgeist-XL, and other Lanturn. Thunder Wave cripples speedy threats such as Pyroar, Mismagius, Vivillon, and Jynx while still deterring the likes of Shiftry, Lilligant, and Ludicolo from switching in and setting up on Lanturn with the threat of paralysis. Lanturn can also safely throw this move out even in the presence of Xatu, as Lanturn's Volt Absorb would only make Xatu's Magic Bounce backfire on itself. Protect is useful for stalling for Leftovers recovery, inching Lanturn out of 3HKOs from the likes of Choice Specs Pyroar's Hyper Voice, Choice Specs Rotom's Shadow Ball, Jynx's Psyshock, and Magmortar's Earthquake. It can also be used to stall for burn damage from Scald or scout Choice item users. Ice Beam is another option to deter Grass-types such as Cacturne and Torterra from switching in freely.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Proportionally low Special Defense compared to its HP means that Special Defense investment should be prioritized over HP. 208 Special Defense EVs would hit the highest jump point in Special Defense, while 40 HP EVs hit a Leftovers number for the most efficient HP recovery. 120 Speed EVs allow Lanturn to outrun Adamant Aggron and Jolly Rock Polish Rhydon before the boost, allowing to KO Rhydon and avoid a fatal Earthquake. 16 Special Attack EVs can even be used to guarantee the OHKO on said Rhydon, if it is truly a bothersome threat to the team. The remaining EVs are poured into Defense, giving Lanturn effective mixed bulk and allowing it to better take hits from Scyther and Klinklang.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lanturn has many resistances and a slow Volt Switch, making it a remarkable bulky pivot that can facilitate safe switches for its faster and frailer teammates. Additional supportive options in Scald and Heal Bell grant it even more utility, allowing it to spread burns and keep its teammates, as well as itself, free of status. If Pokemon immune to Electric are present on the opposing team, Scald is a safer move to throw out, as it nails Ground-types hard and stings the likes of Electivire, as well as having the potential to cripple them via a burn. If Lanturn has Protect, it should best be used to inch Lanturn out of potential KOs from various attackers it would have an advantage against, namely Fire-, Electric-, and Flying-types, effectively forcing them out. It can also stall for burn damage from Scald and scout Choice item users. However, this move should be used with discretion to avoid becoming predictable, so Lanturn should only Protect if it really needs to. Thunder Wave can shut down most attackers Lanturn confronts, and it shouldn't really have to worry about Pokemon immune to Electric because it either doesn't struggle with them or can strike back with Scald.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lanturn has weaknesses to Grass and Ground, which are fortunately very easy to cover. Grass-types and Flying-types are the best teammates, synergizing defensively with Lanturn, as it resists their weaknesses in turn. From a defensive standpoint, the likes of Gourgeist, Leafeon, Torterra, and Vileplume can take care of Lanturn's issues with Ground- or Grass-types, whereas more offensive Grass-types such as Lilligant and Cacturne appreciate the slow Volt Switch bringing them safely into battle to start wreaking havoc. Bulky Flying-types or even Levitate Pokemon, such as Xatu, Weezing, and Mesprit, can switch into Grass- and Ground-type moves with ease and bring their own brand of supportive moves alongside Lanturn. Offensive Flying-types such as Archeops, Rotom-S, and Scyther can easily remove Grass-types, and Scyther with U-turn is also able to form a VoltTurn core with Lanturn. Bulky teammates appreciate the numerous resistances Lanturn brings to the table, while fast and frail teammates like the slow Volt Switch allowing them to safely enter battle. Slower wallbreakers such as Aurorus, Magmortar, and Beheeyem can make use of Lanturn's paralysis support.</p>"

Ice Beam deters Grass-types such as Lilligant, Shiftry, Cacturne, and Exeggutor from switching into Lanturn easily. Signal Beam puts down Malamar while still retaining coverage on Grass-types, especially Ludicolo, though it misses out on a few Grass-types such as Gourgeist and Vileplume. Hidden Power Grass hits Gastrodon and  opposing Lanturn, while Hidden Power Fire nails Ferroseed and Abomasnow. Thunderbolt can be used for an alternative Electric-type STAB move that doesn't force Lanturn out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment, a Modest nature, and a Choice Specs maximize Lanturn's damage output. 184 Speed EVs allow Lanturn to outspeed everything up to neutral-natured base 58 Speed Pokemon, namely Aurorus, Torterra, Golurk, Exeggutor, and Cacturne, and swiftly OHKO them. If more bulk is favored, 52 Speed EVs are the advised minimum to still keep ahead of Malamar, letting Lanturn get chip damage on Malamar with Volt Switch without having to eat a Superpower or simply hit it with Signal Beam, while also outspeeding Mantine. Proportionally low Special Defense compared to its HP means that Special Defense investment should be prioritized over HP, so the remaining EVs are dumped into Special Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Specs Lanturn is intended to be a hole puncher; what it lacks in sheer power, it makes up for with its switch-in opportunities and decent neutral coverage, by virtue of its good defensive and offensive typing. Choice Specs Volt Switch can soften up foes for its teammates to finish off, while Lanturn's Water-type attacks can nail most Pokemon immune to Electric hard. Because this Lanturn is Choiced, it should exercise more caution when using its Volt Switch, as it won't be able to immediately respond with Water-type STAB attacks; instead, Lanturn should predict and hit Electric-immune Pokemon on the switch with its respective coverage move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Pokemon that also complement Lanturn defensively make for the best partners. The likes of Lilligant, Pyroar, and Swellow can be safeguarded from Fire, Ice, Water, and Electric attacks while making use of the advantageous switch granted by Lanturn's Volt Switch; these Pokemon can also protect Lanturn from its weakness to Grass- and Ground-type moves, as well as Freeze-Dry in Pyroar's case. Choice Specs Lanturn is also fairly easy to support offensively. U-turn users such as Swellow, Mesprit, and Scyther can form a VoltTurn core alongside Lanturn to grant each other favorable switch-ins and keep the pressure on the opponent. While not too necessary, entry hazard support from Garbodor, Mesprit, and Cacturne can help Lanturn wear down foes more efficiently.</p>"

  "Xatu": {
    "overview": "<p>Xatu is gifted with the ability Magic Bounce, which allows it to act as a solid anti-entry hazard pivot and gives it an effective immunity to status moves such as Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, and Taunt. It also boasts reliable recovery in Roost, which helps alleviate some of its weaknesses and ensure it stays healthy throughout the match to continue pivoting into common entry hazard setters such as Mesprit and Garbodor. Additionally, a rather colorful movepool, with many support and offensive options alike, allows Xatu to fulfill a number of roles, from a Calm Mind user to a U-turn pivot to even an offensive set. All of these factors make Xatu a staple on more balanced teams, where it acts as the team's main source of entry hazard control. However, its bulk isn't exactly amazing, even with investment, and its typing leaves it susceptible to many common attacking types such as Dark, Ghost, and Rock. Its Dark weakness is particularly troublesome, as it leaves it vulnerable to Pursuit, making it liability in some matchups, especially if it’s not running any Defense investment. Said typing also causes Xatu to falter against certain Stealth Rock users such as Rhydon and Piloswine, meaning it’s not always reliable at keeping hazards at bay.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Xatu has a variety of support moves it can use, such as Tailwind to boost its team's Speed for four turns and dual screens to allow a teammate to set up. Haze is another option that nullifies any stat changes made on the field, allowing Xatu to stop some setup sweepers. Shadow Ball is an option that strikes Ghost-types harder than any other move Xatu has. Trick + Choice Scarf can be used to cripple certain defensive walls the opponent might have and allows Xatu to act as a revenge killer before using Trick. Night Shade is an option to deal a consistent 100 damage, allowing Xatu to slowly whittle down most foes at the cost of doing nothing to Normal-types. Feather Dance is an option which harshly drops the foe's Attack, notably making Xatu's matchup versus a potential Skuntank much easier.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Shiftry, Skuntank, Pawniard, Liepard, and Cacturne can KO Xatu with Dark-type STAB moves and threaten it with Pursuit, and Sucker Punch alleviates any Speed problems; however, they all need to be wary of switching in, as Xatu can either play around them with U-turn or damage them with Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Musharna and Mesprit can take some hits from Xatu's Calm Mind set assuming it lacks Signal Beam, but they need Calm Mind or super effective coverage moves such as Shadow Ball and Thunderbolt to do anything significant back.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Moves</strong>: Archeops, Mismagius, Jynx, and Rotom are some Pokemon that carry super effective moves that can make quick work of most Xatu that haven't set up; however, Xatu often has a move that can 2HKO them or neuter them with status, making switching in sometimes difficult.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Strong attackers such as Magmortar and Pyroar can quickly decimate almost any Xatu, while it cannot 2HKO them in return, but Xatu can use U-turn on the switch to create a more advantageous matchup.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is the mandatory STAB option, doing decent damage to Fighting- and Poison-types such as Poliwrath, Weezing, Vileplume, and Garbodor despite no investment. Alternatively, Psyshock can be used to hit specially bulky Pokemon such as Hariyama, Hitmonchan, and Magmortar. Roost is necessary given that Xatu will be pivoting in and out frequently and allows Xatu to stay healthy and function as a great anti-entry hazard and anti-status pivot. Grass Knot targets Rhydon, Barbaracle, and Samurott while still dealing significant damage to Steelix. Heat Wave can be used to hit Steelix, Ferroseed, Pawniard, Mawile, and Klinklang (also breaking Klinklang's Substitutes). Thunder Wave is an option to cripple fast offensive Pokemon such as Tauros and Pyroar, and prevents the likes of Scyther and Lilligant from setting up on it.  U-turn is an option to allow Xatu to pivot around and gain momentum for the team and working fantastically in tandem with Magic Bounce. Signal Beam hits Malamar for heavy damage, notably dealing significantly more damage than U-turn due to the Defense boosts Malamar accumulates with Superpower.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>16 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Xatu to outspeed neutral-natured Hitmonchan and Garbodor. The rest of the EVs are placed into HP and Defense to maximize Xatu's bulk. Rocky Helmet is used to slowly wear down foes that make contact with Xatu as it pivots in and finds moments to Roost off the damage. Colbur Berry is an option that makes Xatu a much more reliable Fighting-type check by significantly reducing the damage taken from Dark-type attacks, particularly Knock Off. Leftovers is also an option to slightly increases Xatu's longevity, but is not as useful as the other two. Magic Bounce bounces back entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and prevents status moves such as Taunt and Toxic from stopping recovery or crippling Xatu or its team with status.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Xatu can bounce back entry hazards with Magic Bounce, but it must be wary of switching in on entry hazard setters that carry super effective coverage that could dispatch it, such as Rhydon. Xatu should also be used and switched in throughout the entirety of the game to reflect entry hazards and status moves whenever the opportunity presents itself. Psychic should be used to whittle down opposing Pokemon that cannot threaten Xatu, but it shouldn't be used as much if the opponent has a Dark-type Pokemon that can get a free switch. When predicting a foe to switch in, Xatu should generally try to hit it with a coverage move or simply U-turn out to catch momentum and shift into a more favorable matchup. Against faster Pokemon that could possibly threaten Xatu with super effective coverage, it is better to hard switch to avoid the risk of damage instead of using U-turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Poliwrath and Hariyama are good partners, as Xatu has trouble with Dark-, Rock-, and Ice-types such as Liepard, Pawniard, Rhydon, and Aurorus which can all KO it without much trouble. Rhydon is a good partner as it resists Rock and is immune to Electric, which prevents Volt Switch users such as Rotom from getting momentum off of Xatu. Lanturn is a similarly strong partner, as it is one of the only Pokemon to resist the famous Ice + Electric combo, both of which hit Xatu for super effective damage; Xatu also forms a VoltTurn core with Lanturn. Lanturn shuts down opposing Volt Switch users with Volt Absorb, while Xatu resists Grass and is immune to Ground. Cacturne, Liepard, and Pawniard are also good partners, as they can use Knock Off or Pursuit to trap pesky Psychic- or Ghost-types, while Xatu covers their Fighting-type weakness. Liepard itself can run U-turn to provide more momentum as well. Grass-types such as Lilligant resist Electric-type moves and are useful to take on bulky Rock-types, which Xatu can occasionally struggle to KO. Naturally, any Pokemon that has a weakness to Stealth Rock such as Scyther, Pyroar, or Vivillon, is a good teammate, as it appreciates Xatu's ability to keep entry hazards, which would otherwise severely cripple, it off the field.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind allows Xatu to boost its uninvested Special Attack and Special Defense stats, giving it the ability to break down or sweep the opponent's team after attaining enough boosts. Roost is necessary for reliable recovery, giving Xatu 50% of its health back and keeping it healthy throughout the match. The preferred STAB move is Psyshock, which hits Pokemon on their Defense stat as opposed to their Special Defense stat, doing significantly more damage to foes such as Mantine and allowing it to beat Calm Mind Mega Audino. Heat Wave provides coverage on Steel-types such as Steelix, Klinklang, and Ferroseed. Signal Beam is mainly used to beat Malamar and other Psychic- or Dark-types. Giga Drain is also a notable option to beat both Quagsire and Rhydon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>16 Speed EVs allow Xatu to outspeed neutral-natured Hitmonchan and Garbodor. The rest of the EVs are placed into HP and Defense with to maximize Xatu's bulk. Leftovers increases Xatu's longevity. Colbur Berry is another option allows Xatu to survive one super effective Dark-type attack. Magic Bounce is the ability of choice to bounce back entry hazards as well as status moves, and it also allows Xatu to boost without the fear of being crippled by status or phazed with Roar or Whirlwind.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Xatu should mainly attempt to break through the Pokemon it checks, as its typing and bulk aren't the greatest and the chance of a sweep happening against offense is minimal. Xatu should try to set up against Pokemon it threatens such as Weezing, which can't inflict status on it or set up entry hazards while it's on the field. Calm Mind Xatu should be used in an effort to trample stall teams due to Magic Bounce negating most phazing attempts and status inflictions. Psyshock and Stored Power are preferred over Psychic, as they can help Xatu win Calm Mind wars; Psyshock also strikes Pokemon with a high Special Defense stat, such as Cryogonal and Mantine, on their weaker Defense. Be wary of setting up against Pokemon that carry moves with secondary effects, such as Scald and Sludge Bomb, as they could cripple Xatu and make it much more difficult to set up. Xatu can also beat Calm Mind Mega Audino by boosting along with it and then dispatching it with Psyshock. However, Xatu should not try to set up against other Calm Mind users with better bulk, such as Musharna.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primeape and Hitmonchan can defeat Dark-, Rock-, and Steel-types such as Pawniard, Liepard, and Klinklang, which Xatu can't touch if it lacks the appropriate coverage move. Lanturn can take Ice- and Electric-type attacks, KO Rock-types with its STAB Water-type moves, and help Xatu enter the field safely with Volt Switch. Pawniard, Liepard, and Cacturne are good partners, as they can use their STAB Knock Off and Pursuit to deal with Psychic-types that Xatu cannot sufficiently hurt during its setup, while Xatu resists any Fighting-type moves thrown their way. Another good teammate is Thick Fat Hariyama, which can tank Rock- and Ice-type moves aimed at Xatu and is also bulky enough to take most special attacks that Xatu can't survive without any Calm Minds up.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic provides Xatu with a decently strong, reliable STAB attack that allows it to deal significant damage to most Pokemon that don't resist it. However, if hitting Mantine, Hariyama, and Magmortar harder is more useful to your team, Psyshock can be used instead. Grass Knot is chosen to hit Ground-types such as Rhydon and Golurk. Heat Wave provides Xatu with much-needed coverage to hit Steel-types, particularly Steelix, Ferroseed, and Klinklang. Roost provides Xatu with means of recovery, furthering its longevity. Hidden Power Ground can be used in place of Roost to 2HKO Skuntank, a common switch-in to Xatu; however, it hits nothing outside of that. Signal Beam can be used to hit Malamar, which otherwise walls Xatu; however, this hardly provides any additional utility. Tailwind can be used in place of Roost to temporarily boost the Speed of Xatu and its teammates.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in both Special Attack and Speed ensures Xatu hits as fast and as hard as possible. Life Orb gives Xatu a much-needed boost in power, but it comes at the cost of recoil after each attack. Magic Bounce is an amazing ability, allowing Xatu to reflect back entry hazards and status moves, such as Garbodor's Spikes and Steelix's Toxic.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Typically, Xatu will be using Psychic, as it is its most powerful move, using its powerful coverage moves to heavily damage Pokemon that comfortably switch into other, more passive, Xatu sets, such as Steelix and Rhydon. When using offensive Xatu, it should be kept in mind that this set lacks the bulk that other Xatu variants have, meaning it will not be able to defensively check foes such as Primeape and Garbodor as effectively as its other sets would. This, combined with a poor defensive typing, means that Xatu will typically want to be brought in via a free switch, such as after a slow Volt Switch or U-turn or after a teammate has fainted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>More than other Xatu sets, offensive Xatu fits best on offensive teams that appreciate Pokemon like Steelix and Rhydon lured and hit with its powerful coverage moves in addition to a form of entry hazard control. While Xatu does provide a form of hazard control, it should be noted that it should not be relied upon as the sole source of hazard removal for Pokemon that need it to perform effectively, like Vivillon and Scyther, as Xatu cannot reliably keep entry hazards off the field. Ground-types such as Rhydon, Steelix, and Camerupt are immune to the Electric-type moves that burden Xatu, check Skuntank, and can provide Stealth Rock to whittle down the opposing team, thus allowing Xatu to have an easier time creating holes in the opponent's defensive cores. Fighting-types like Primeape and Hitmonchan make for effective partners, as they can handle the Dark- and Rock- types that plague Xatu. Hitmonchan in particular makes for an effective teammate to Xatu, as together they create an excellent core that can effectively keep hazards off their side of the field.</p>"

  "Jumpluff": {
    "overview": "<p>Jumpluff's access to Sleep Powder plus Infiltrator lets it temporarily incapacitate a Pokemon even when behind a Substitute and goes well with its very good Speed tier, which lets it outspeed Scyther and Pyroar while Speed tying with Archeops and Tauros. Other moves such as Memento and U-turn make it a great team supporter, letting Pokemon set up with more ease in the former's case and letting it keep up offensive momentum in the latter's case. Jumpluff also sports decent typing that gives it good STAB moves and nice resistances to Water, Fighting, and Grass. However, Jumpluff's pitiful Attack stat means it often can be taken advantage of and relegates it to strictly a support role, as it's otherwise outclassed by other Grass-types such as Shiftry and Lilligant. Additionally, its average defensive stats and weakness to Stealth Rock make it difficult for Jumpluff to switch in safely and utilize its resistances as well as it would like.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance Jumpluff has some merits over Shiftry such as access to Sleep Powder, a much higher Speed stat and STAB on Acrobatics, but it is generally too weak. Substitute can be used to avoid status and to prevent Jumpluff from being revenge killed as easily. Synthesis can be used to give Jumpluff additional longevity, but it is generally not worth it due to Jumpluff's middling bulk and because it forces it to give up one of its STAB or support moves. Chlorophyll can be used, as Jumpluff can outspeed the entire unboosted metagame under the sun and provides sun teams with a fast Sleep Powder user.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Archeops, Regirock, Rotom, Steelix, Klinklang, and Aggron all can take Acrobatics and Seed Bomb with ease and retaliate with their respective STAB moves, though none of these Pokemon should directly switch in if Jumpluff hasn't put anything to sleep yet.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Poison-types such as Garbodor and Weezing can take Jumpluff's attacks with little issue, with the former wearing down Jumpluff with Rocky Helmet plus Aftermath damage and the latter burning Jumpluff with Will-O-Wisp or dealing heavy damage with Sludge Bomb. Mega Audino takes very little damage from Jumpluff and can chip away at its HP with Dazzling Gleam and heal off any lost HP with Wish or Rest. If Jumpluff does not have Encore, Mega Audino can also use Jumpluff as setup bait for Calm Minds. Steelix and Piloswine take a pittance from all of Jumpluff's attacks and can use it to freely set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Sleep Powder</strong>: Sap Sipper Miltank is immune to Sleep Powder, takes a pittance from Acrobatics, and can paralyze Jumpluff with Body Slam in return. Electivire and Magmortar can switch into a Sleep Powder and threaten Jumpluff with Ice Punch and Fire Blast, respectively; however, Magmortar is not very reliable, as it is 2HKOed by Acrobatics after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Floatzel, Electrode, and Swellow can outspeed and threaten to OHKO Jumpluff, but none of these Pokemon can safely switch in.</p>",

      "Support Puff": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sleep Powder temporarily incapacitates one of the opponent's Pokemon. Acrobatics works well with Sleep Powder, hitting Grass-types immune to Sleep Powder super effectively. Memento sacrifices Jumpluff and cuts the foe's offenses in half, allowing a teammate to set up safely. U-turn keeps up offensive momentum and allows Jumpluff to potentially bring a teammate on the field safely. It also takes advantage of the switches Jumpluff forces with the threat of Sleep Powder. Seed Bomb is an alternative to let Jumpluff deal significant damage to Flying-resistant Pokemon such as Rhydon, Carracosta, and Lanturn while also enabling Jumpluff to break past Gastrodon. Encore can be used to lock a Pokemon into an unfavorable move such as Shift Gear from Klinklang or Stealth Rock from Steelix, which a teammate can capitalize on. It also prevents Jumpluff from being taken advantage of by various setup sweepers. Encore can be used over U-turn or Memento, both of which snag momentum from the foe, with Memento being one-time use only but offering more opportunities for teammates to set up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs plus a Jolly nature allow Jumpluff to take full advantage of its good Speed tier, while maximum Attack EVs give Jumpluff an offensive presence, allowing it to inflict decent damage with Acrobatics. Infiltrator allows Jumpluff to hit foes behind a Substitute, most notably letting it put Klinklang behind a Substitute to sleep. No item is used to ensure that Acrobatics is always at full power and also lets Jumpluff take less damage from Knock Off.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jumpluff makes for a decent lead thanks to its access to a fast Sleep Powder, letting it disable a foe early-game. Be wary of using the move if the opponent has a Pokemon immune to Sleep Powder such as Xatu or Magmortar, as it can completely ruin your offensive momentum. Acrobatics should generally be used to get chip damage on the opposing Pokemon as well as hit Grass-types that pivot into Sleep Powder. Memento should be used wisely, as using the move sacrifices Jumpluff, so if there is a threat around that Jumpluff still needs to check, refrain from using it. U-turn is great for keeping up offensive momentum throughout the game and should be used if the opponent has Steel-types such as Steelix and Klinklang.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers that appreciate Memento support pair very well with Jumpluff. Omastar and Barbaracle in particular greatly benefit from it, as they can more easily use Shell Smash. Other setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Samurott and Double Dance Rhydon work as well. Primeape pairs very well with this set, as it breaks past Steel- and Ice-types that give Jumpluff issues such as Klinklang, Mawile, and Aurorus, while Jumpluff can bring in Primeape safely with U-turn. Hitmonchan functions in a similar manner, with its Rapid Spin support being the key difference. Floatzel appreciates U-turn support and can threaten a lot of answers to Jumpluff such as Archeops and Regirock. Assault Vest Magmortar can switch into most Ice-types with little issue and break past other problematic Pokemon such as Klinklang and Mawile.</p>"

  "Quagsire": {
    "overview": "<p>While Quagsire faces a lot of competition from its rival Water / Ground type Gastrodon due to the latter's better Special Attack and special bulk, it does have a unique niche in Unaware, an excellent ability that lets it ignore boosts from setup sweepers entirely. This lets it effectively wall the likes of Swords Dance Scyther, dual dance Rhydon, and Malamar, making it a very helpful asset for stall teams. While Gastrodon can use Clear Smog to remove boosts, this does not work against Steel-types such as Klinklang and it doesn't let Gastrodon ignore boosts as it switches in or until after the move executes, making Quagsire much more reliable in this regard. Regardless, Quagsire must watch out for powerful special attackers such as Jynx and Samurott due to its lower Special Defense stat, as they can deal heavy damage with unboosted attacks. Grass-type Pokemon also deal tremendous damage to Quagsire, and most fear only status when switching into it. While Unaware is certainly a great ability, you should decide whether it's necessary for your team to function well before choosing Quagsire over Gastrodon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Water Absorb might seem like a good choice at first, but practically any set using this ability is outdone by Gastrodon due to its better stats, especially with the Special Attack boost from Storm Drain. Overall, the extra recovery isn't needed against targets like Barbaracle and Kabutops that Gastrodon already beats, and other Water-types such as special Samurott and Ludicolo simply run coverage to break past Gastrodon anyway, making Water Absorb a moot point at best. Yawn is a neat option that lets Quagsire force switches and potentially rack up entry hazard damage and spread Toxic Spikes. Protect can be useful for letting Quagsire scout for coverage moves such as Hidden Power Grass on Lanturn and Seed Bomb on Garbodor; the move also helps Quagsire stall foes out with Scald burns or Toxic poison. Encore lets Quagsire lock down Stealth Rock users, status users, and setup sweepers that aren't bothered by Quagsire's other moves, but is difficult to pull off due to Quagsire's low Speed. Rocky Helmet is an interesting choice that lets Quagsire punish the many contact attackers it checks with more residual damage, but the lack of Leftovers forces Quagsire to use Recover more often. While a Choice Band set can be mildly threatening, this is mostly due to surprise value, and Grass-types can deal with it very easily provided they can avoid switching directly into Ice Punch (or Stone Edge in Abomasnow's case).</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-type Moves</strong>: Almost all Grass-types in the tier are special attackers and can hit  Quagsire on its weaker defensive stat. Lilligant and Ludicolo can easily force Quagsire out and set up for a sweep regardless of Unaware, and don't particularly mind Scald or Toxic. Even physical Grass-types like Swords Dance Shiftry and Jumpluff can take advantage of Quagsire's massive weakness and hit it very hard. Weaker non-STAB and non-invested Grass-type attacks like Seed Bomb from Garbodor might not do much to a Curse-boosted Quagsire, but they may force Quagsire to use Recover until it succumbs to a critical hit. All Grass-types bar Roselia and Vileplume don't appreciate taking a Toxic on the switch in, though.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Jynx, Mesprit, Haunter, Vivillon, Samurott, Aurorus, and Musharna can all take advantage of Quagsire's low Special Defense and hit it with a strong STAB attack. Quagsire is generally helpless against them due to its low Speed and only mildly threatening attacks. Xatu can switch into Toxic and bounce it back while also threatening Quagsire with Grass Knot, while SubToxic Mantine can switch into Scald, use Substitute to block Toxic, and cripple Quagsire with a Toxic of its own.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Unaware Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Quagsire's best STAB attack due to its great power and perfect accuracy, dealing good damage against most threats that do not resist it and letting Quagsire deal heavy damage to Lanturn in particular. Scald makes Quagsire slightly more difficult to switch into and can cripple physical attackers, complementing Quagsire's physical bulk nicely. Recover allows Quagsire to regain 50% of its HP regardless of weather and keeps it healthy throughout the battle. Toxic can wear down common  switch-ins to Quagsire, mainly Grass-types such as Ludicolo and Lilligant. Alternatively, Curse allows Quagsire to raise its Attack and Defense, allowing to beat Pokemon it normally has to stall out such as Malamar and Audino. Curse's Defense boost also helps Quagsire against physical attackers like Tauros, Kangaskhan, Hariyama, and Guts-boosted Gurdurr so that it won't have to use Recover nearly as much.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in HP and Defense maximize Quagsire's defensive bulk. A Relaxed nature allows both of Quagsire's STAB moves to be at full power while lowering its irrelevant Speed stat. Unaware allows Quagsire to ignore the opponent's stat changes, allowing it to check almost all setup sweepers. Leftovers provides Quagsire with some passive recovery every turn, which is important for avoiding 2HKOs from certain powerful attackers such as Tauros and Kangaskhan after switching into Spikes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Quagsire should be using Scald and Toxic early on to wear down the opposition. Bring Quagsire in on setup sweepers, as it can check almost all physical setup sweepers lacking a Grass-type coverage move, mainly Scyther, Samurott, and Klinklang, but also all-out-attackers such as Archeops, Kangaskhan, and Tauros. Avoid opposing Toxic and other status effects if your team has no cleric, as they hinder Quagsire's ability to continually check setup sweepers. In particular, try not to switch Quagsire into Toxic Spikes; use a grounded Poison-type or hazard removal Pokemon to remove them first. Use Recover to keep Quagsire healthy, not leaving it at the point where it can be 2HKOed after switching in. Be wary about using Recover to stall out attacks such as Hariyama's Close Combat if your team has another solid check, as this increases the likelihood of a surprise critical hit KOing Quagsire. Earthquake can hit frail Pokemon that don't mind Scald such as Jynx and Floatzel as they switch in, and can be used to rack up damage against statused targets if Quagsire doesn't need to heal up. Scout for Grass-type coverage moves like Seed Bomb from Garbodor and Hidden Power Grass from Magmortar before switching Quagsire into them if possible. While Quagsire can handle most offensive Pokemon, extremely powerful physical attackers such as Zangoose, Choice Band Hariyama, and Choice Band Golurk can easily break through Quagsire's only decent physical bulk, so don't try and switch into these foes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that resist Grass-type attacks such as Garbodor, Charizard, and Scyther are essential teammates. Vileplume and Ferroseed are particularly helpful; the former absorbs Toxic Spikes while the latter can provide Stealth Rock support, and both are excellent responses to Grass-type setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Shiftry and Jumpluff that can break through Quagsire. Heal Bell users such as Mega Audino and Sap Sipper Miltank work well to cure status for Quagsire, with Miltank being able to use Sap Sipper to completely nullify Grass-types such as Lilligant while also dealing with Vivillon, another setup sweeper Quagsire has problems with. In general, passive Pokemon that give setup sweepers free turns highly appreciate Quagsire's support; Bronzor and Gourgeist-XL are some other notable partners. Absorbing Toxic Spikes is mandatory for keeping Quagsire healthy, so make sure to pack a grounded Poison-type such as Vileplume, Skuntank, or Garbodor; a Rapid Spin user such as Hitmonchan, Claydol, or Cryogonal; a Defog user such as Shiftry or Mantine; or Xatu to keep them off the field.</p>"

  "Misdreavus": {
    "overview": "<p>While Misdreavus faces a lot of competition from its evolution, Mismagius, its superior bulk with an Eviolite equipped gives it a decent niche as a defensive spinblocker and check to physical attackers for certain teams. Full defensive investment combined with Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and its pure Ghost typing makes Misdreavus hard to deal with for certain powerful Normal- and Fighting-types such as Tauros, Primeape, and Hitmonchan. Furthermore, unlike Mismagius, it is not as prone to being KOed by a stray coverage attack as it tries to spinblock, such as Claydol's Psyshock or Kabutops's Stone Edge, making it a safer switch-in to these foes, and Misdreavus still has enough Speed to outspeed most Defog users and Taunt them before they can remove the hazards set. However, Misdreavus suffers terribly from its vulnerability to Knock Off, which prevents it from checking foes such as Hariyama and Zangoose that Ghost-types with Colbur Berry can normally deal with; furthermore, compared to Rotom and Gourgeist-XL, it lacks resistances to switch into attacks with. Misdreavus also relies on the combination of Will-O-Wisp and Hex to deal good damage, conceding a lot of momentum to Pokemon that don't mind these moves, such as Pyroar and Choice Specs Swellow. As Misdreavus relies on Eviolite for its niche over Mismagius, any team that uses the little ghost must have Pokemon that can switch into Knock Off reliably for it to not become a liability. However, any team that absolutely requires entry hazards on the field consistently will highly appreciate Misdreavus's support as one of the bulkiest and most reliable spinblockers around.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic does more chip damage to foes and breaks down walls such as Mega Audino and Lanturn much easier in combination with Taunt, but it struggles to find a moveslot over the listed options. Notably, it gives Misdreavus a means of inflicting damaging status on Fire-types, but Toxic Spikes support is usually more consistent for this purpose. Heal Bell is a useful utility move that makes Misdreavus and its team less susceptible to status, but Misdreavus will struggle to fulfill its spinblocking niche successfully if it replaces Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, or Pain Split with it; Misdreavus will also become very vulnerable to faster Taunt users, such as Archeops and Floatzel, when without an attacking move. Memento + Taunt lets Misdreavus provide team support for sweepers such as Barbaracle and Omastar and has good synergy with Spikes-stacking teams, but this is usually done better by Mismagius thanks to its higher Speed. Destiny Bond can similarly be used with Taunt to force slower attackers into a bad position, but Misdreavus shouldn't be sacrificing itself when it has other roles it should fulfill, and Mismagius once again boasts a greater Speed stat to more effectively use these moves. Finally, Mean Look + Perish Song can be used to trap and KO certain threats, but Will-O-Wisp + Taunt usually does a good enough job and has much more useful general applications.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Fire-types, such as Charizard, Pyroar, Magmortar, and Combusken, are immune to Will-O-Wisp and can switch into Misdreavus with few problems if it doesn't run Thunder Wave. They can either threaten Misdreavus immediately with powerful STAB attacks or set up with Swords Dance or Flame Charge. Pyroar poses a particular threat due to its immunity to Hex.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off undermines the core premise of Misdreavus—its raw bulk in conjunction with its decent Speed. Knock Off not only removes its Eviolite but also hits it super effectively, almost always 2HKOing Misdreavus despite its defensive investment. While Misdreavus is most threatened by Dark-types that run the move, such as Shiftry and Liepard, other users of the move such as Hariyama and Zangoose can still heavily damage it, and even weak users such as Ferroseed can cripple Misdreavus so that a stronger teammate can take it down afterwards. However, most of these Pokemon fear switching directly into Will-O-Wisp, except for the rare Guts Hariyama.</p> <p><strong>Status Blockers</strong>: In general, stopping Misdreavus from spreading burns is an effective countermeasure against it. Fast Skuntank variants can outspeed Misdreavus and use Taunt + Pursuit to lock it down. Calm Mind Xatu, if it outspeeds Misdreavus or is at full health, can set up on it despite its super effective STAB move, as it cannot be inflicted with status by Will-O-Wisp and will thus only have to take a weak 65-Base Power attack most of the time.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Misdreavus lacks reliable recovery and can easily be worn down over time if it can't pull off a good Pain Split. Strong special attackers, such as Life Orb Samurott, Manectric, and Choice Specs Swellow, still dislike the chip damage that Will-O-Wisp inflicts, but they are not crippled by it and can hit Misdreavus hard with their STAB attacks if it chooses to stay in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple the physical attackers that Misdreavus switches into, such as Tauros and Kabutops, while also inflicting chip damage and boosting Hex's power to respectable levels. Hex inflicts decent damage to most Pokemon that are not Normal-types if they have been burned or inflicted with status by a teammate or Toxic Spikes; it does enough damage to prevent Misdreavus from being too passive. Foul Play is a good option to hit Normal-types such as Tauros directly, giving Misdreavus a better matchup against some of the specific targets it can check. It also does good damage to physical setup sweepers, such as Swords Dance Samurott and Shell Smash Barbaracle, dissuading these faster threats that could avoid a Taunt from setting up if necessary. Pain Split is Misdreavus's best recovery move and can also inflict chip damage on foes, being most effective against targets with high HP, such as Lanturn, Audino, and Aurorus. Taunt can be used to stop setup attempts from slower threats such as Mega Audino, block entry hazard moves from Steelix and defensive Omastar, and protect Misdreavus against status attacks such as Steelix's and Quagsire's Toxic. Thunder Wave can also be used to punish Fire-types that try to switch into Will-O-Wisp, as well as special attackers that don't mind a burn and faster targets such as Archeops in general.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>56 Speed EVs are used to outspeed maximum Speed neutral-natured Pawniard, Torterra, and Aurorus, while the remaining EVs are invested in HP and Defense to improve Misdreavus's physical bulk as much as possible, emphasizing its niche over Mismagius as a bulky spinblocker. An EV spread of 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 Spe with a Timid nature can be used to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Sandslash as well as positive-natured Golurk and Omastar, while 96 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Misdreavus to outspeed maximum Speed neutral-natured Samurott, Hitmonchan, Garbodor, and most Skuntank and Xatu variants. Outspeeding Skuntank will generally allow Misdreavus to win against it one-on-one even if it runs a Lum Berry, so consider whether the loss in bulk is worth the opportunity to outspeed and Taunt or inflict status on a wider range of targets before they can move. Levitate is useful for dodging Earthquakes from Rhydon, Steelix, and Torterra and lets Misdreavus ignore Spikes and Toxic Spikes; the latter gives Misdreavus a solid niche over Gourgeist-XL. Eviolite is mandatory for the extra bulk it provides Misdreavus with and also allows it to tank strong special attacks such as Life Orb Haunter's Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock despite a lack of investment in Special Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Misdreavus should switch into Rapid Spin users, such as Hitmonchan and Kabutops, whenever they try to remove entry hazards, as well as physical attackers such as Tauros and Primeape that struggle to hit it hard. While Rotom and Mismagius take significant amounts of damage from a Life Orb-boosted Ice Punch from Hitmonchan or Waterfall from Kabutops, Misdreavus can tank those hits, making it a more consistent spinblocker than most other fast Ghost-types. It can then use Will-O-Wisp to burn them or another foe if they switch out or use Pain Split to heal up if it's significantly weakened. Misdreavus can switch in and Taunt threats such as Calm Mind Musharna and Mega Audino to stop them from setting up; it can also make for a good lead against slower entry hazard setters, such as defensive Omastar and Garbodor, by outspeeding them and using Taunt, thus forcing them to attack or switch out. Misdreavus can also use Taunt to block Defog from slow users, such as Pelipper and Mantine, giving it even more utility in keeping its team's entry hazards up. Even Lum Berry Skuntank can be beat with Taunt unless it runs Crunch, as Pursuit inflicts minimal damage to Misdreavus if it stays in and Sucker Punch can easily be bypassed by using Will-O-Wisp or Pain Split. Knock Off users, such as Hariyama and Zangoose, should be avoided at all costs, as the move will deal significant damage even from a burned target and will severely hinder Misdreavus's ability to take hits for the rest of the match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Misdreavus is one of the most consistent spinblockers around, teammates that use Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes highly appreciate its support. Toxic Spikes users such as Garbodor and Omastar synergize particularly well with it, as they appreciate Misdreavus's immunities to Ground- and Fighting-type moves, respectively, while Misdreavus enjoys the boosted Hex damage on poisoned targets. These two Pokemon can also provide Spikes support to wear down offensive Pokemon that Misdreavus can switch into repeatedly, such as Tauros and Primeape. Meanwhile, Omastar, Steelix, and Rhydon can use Stealth Rock and similarly appreciate Misdreavus's immunities. Strong cleaners, such as Kangaskhan and Swellow, appreciate Misdreavus's ability to spread residual damage, both through status and through the entry hazards it protects, and they can both beat opposing Ghost-types with their Scrappy STAB attacks. They can also reduce the opponent's opportunities for using Defog through the offensive pressure they provide. Fire-types, such as Pyroar, Magmortar, and Charizard, can usually switch into Misdreavus without fear, so packing a solid Pokemon that resists Fire-type moves, such as Hariyama, Grumpig, or Lanturn, is highly recommended, with the latter also potentially providing Heal Bell support to remove crippling status from Misdreavus. These Pokemon can also check other special attackers such as Floatzel and Manectric, which aren't too bothered by a burn from Misdreavus. Finally, having a dedicated switch-in to Knock Off is highly beneficial given Misdreavus's huge weakness to the move; Mega Audino can fill the role while also providing Wish and Heal Bell support, while bulky itemless Charizard is another option.</p>"

  "Steelix": {
    "overview": "<p>A combination of typing, bulk, and offensive presence makes Steelix arguably the best Stealth Rock setter in the tier. Its great typing lets it check prominent Normal-, Flying-, Psychic-, Steel-, and Fairy-types, such as Kangaskhan, Archeops, Musharna, Klinklang, and Mega Audino. This is backed up by Steelix's titanic physical bulk, letting it take on any physical attacker without a super effective STAB move. Powerful STAB moves also complement Steelix's decent Attack stat to give it a threatening offensive presence. However, Steelix's special bulk is mediocre, especially uninvested, so it can't quite take on Pokemon such as offensive Mega Audino and Choice Specs Swellow without taking significant damage. Common weaknesses to Fire-, Fighting-, Ground-, and Water-type moves don't do Steelix any favors, either, and allow Pokemon Steelix typically checks to eliminate it with a special coverage move, such as Fire Blast Mega Audino and Mawile. Lastly, Steelix's exceedingly low Speed stat is a hindrance, leaving it outsped by most defensive Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Passho Berry or Chople Berry can be useful on teams weak to Water- and Fighting-types, respectively. Custap Berry takes advantage of Sturdy and Steelix's ability to take numerous hits to give it a last-ditch chance to set up Stealth Rock or attack the foe. A fast spread with 164 Speed EVs is an option to let Steelix outspeed base Speed 50 Pokemon, such as Vileplume and Hariyama, at the cost of bulk. Taunt can be run with the above spread to keep Pokemon such as Vileplume, Musharna, and Ferroseed from gaining back health or, in the latter's last one's case, setting up entry hazards. Holding Lum Berry and running Crunch messes with Rotom and helps against other Will-O-Wisp users. An Autotomize set with Sheer Force, holding Life Orb and running Iron Head, Earthquake, and one of Crunch, Fire Fang, and Rock Slide, can work as a wincon. Special Steelix with Earth Power, Flash Cannon, Stealth Rock, and either Dark Pulse for Rotom and Psychic-types or Thunder Fang for Pelipper and Mantine is a niche option to lure typical checks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types, such as Samurott, resist Steelix's Steel-type STAB moves, usually have the bulk to stomach Earthquake, and can retaliate with their super effective STAB moves. Pelipper, Mantine, and Ludicolo also are immune to or resist Earthquake, making them particularly good switch-ins, and the former two can get rid of Stealth Rock with Defog. However, they all fear Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Rotom</strong>: Rotom resists Steel and, thanks to Levitate, is immune to Earthquake, and in return it can burn Steelix and deal significant damage to it with its Ghost STAB moves, making it a very good and common check. It does fear the occasional Crunch, though, and doesn't appreciate Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Physically bulky Pokemon such as Vileplume, Weezing, and Torterra can easily take on Steelix's dual STAB moves, and, in the former two's cases, are immune to Toxic and KO back. Many of them dislike Toxic, though.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types can KO or deal heavy damage Steelix with their STAB moves; Poliwrath in particular can switch in with ease due to its resistance to Heavy Slam. In addition, Gurdurr's high physical bulk with Eviolite makes it a very reliable check to Steelix and Gurdurr can use Steelix as setup fodder for Bulk Ups or even take advantage of a potential Toxic with Guts. However, physically frailer Fighting-types, such as Hitmonchan, Primeape, and Hariyama, don't enjoy switching into Steelix.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Steelix is one of the best Stealth Rock setters in the tier. Heavy Slam has high Base Power against most targets thanks to Steelix's high weight. Earthquake is a powerful and reliable Ground-type STAB move. Toxic cripples switch-ins such as Pelipper, Gastrodon, and Rotom and most notably lets Steelix counter Musharna. Protect can be used to snag some Leftovers recovery, which also has the nifty use of restoring Sturdy after a switching into Stealth Rock, and lets Steelix scout Choice-locked attackers such as Charizard and Pyroar. Gyro Ball, with 0 Speed IVs and a Brave nature, is an alternate Steel-type STAB move that hits anything faster than fully invested, positive-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon harder than Heavy Slam but loses damage against anything slower than that, most notably Mega Audino. Roar can be used in the fourth moveslot, especially on hazard-stacking teams; it also lets Steelix phaze boosting threats such as Musharna and Malamar, the latter in an emergency situation. For more offensive variants, especially those using Sheer Force and Life Orb, Toxic can be replaced by Crunch for Rotom or Rock Slide for Mantine, Rotom-S, and Pelipper.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The HP investment gives Steelix a Leftovers number, the Special Defense investment lets Steelix avoid the 2HKO from Tauros's Fire Blast, and the rest of the EVs are dumped into Attack with an Adamant nature to give Steelix much-needed power. A simple spread with maximum Attack also works fine for more power if Tauros isn't a concern. Leftovers gives Steelix much-needed passive recovery. Sturdy is this set's most useful ability, as it doesn't use any Sheer Force-boosted moves, and letting Steelix survive moves such as Pyroar's Fire Blast and Samurott's Hydro Pump from full health in a pinch. Sheer Force with Life Orb, Iron Head, and a coverage option in the fourth moveslot is an option to make Steelix more offensively threatening.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Steelix's great typing and good bulk to switch into the likes of Archeops, Kangaskhan, and Mesprit. Usually, set up Stealth Rock as soon as possible. However, if the opponent has Pelipper or Mantine, which can use Defog freely against Steelix, hit them with Toxic on the switch to gradually wear them down. After that, switch Steelix in and out as necessary, and dish out some damage to any switch-ins with its powerful STAB moves, or use Toxic against Pokemon that can handle Steelix's attacks, such as Gastrodon and Ludicolo. Be mindful of switching Steelix into threats such as Swellow, Tauros, and Mega Audino, as being hit by a coverage move will leave Steelix unable to check them or their partners. Normal spam in particular is a potent strategy to be mindful of, as it quickly weakens Steelix and leaves it unable to check the Normal-types, so sacrificing a teammate or pivoting around is the best move if it is necessary to keep Steelix around. Keeping Sturdy intact can be useful in emergency situations to KO Pokemon such as Pyroar, Combusken, and Barbaracle.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steelix fits well in almost all archetypes, though it's most useful on balance and bulky offense. Water-types, such as Samurott and Lanturn, handle the Fire- and Water-types Steelix struggles with. Pelipper and Mantine in particular also check Fighting-types. Poison-types such as Vileplume, Weezing, and Garbodor check Grass- and Fighting-types, and the former three also handle Ground-types. Any of the last three can also form an entry hazard-stacking core with Steelix, and Weezing paired with Steelix is a notable core for balance. General special sponges such as Assault Vest Hariyama and Magmortar, which also check Fire-types, complement Steelix well, and in return Steelix takes care of most physical attackers, in addition to Psychic-types for the former. Ghost-types such as the Gourgeist formes and Rotom can spinblock for Steelix if it's used on entry hazard-stacking teams. Fast revenge killers such as Floatzel and Swellow make up for Steelix's low Speed, and Steelix's Stealth Rock support helps to weaken their checks and counters.</p>"

With its good offensive typing and high Base Power moves such as Earthquake and Icicle Crash, Piloswine is a potent attacker, hitting the majority of the tier for neutral damage with just its STAB moves.

Stealth Rock makes Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon more manageable for both Piloswine and its teammates. Icicle Crash is consistently powerful, while Icicle spear is weaker and more accurate; both pair well with Earthquake and allow Piloswine to hit bulky Ground- and Flying-type Pokemon super effectively. Ice Shard gives Piloswine the ability to pick off weakened foes, especially those that utilize Focus Sash. Toxic is another option to cripple the likes of Musharna, Rotom, and Pelipper.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment paired with an Adamant nature lets Piloswine hit as hard as possible with its STAB attacks. 36 Speed EVs allow Piloswine to outspeed Gourgeist-XL, and the remaining EVs are put into HP to let Piloswine tank powerful attacks and set up Stealth Rock reliably in combination with Eviolite. Thick Fat allows Piloswine to survive powerful Fire-type attacks such as Magmortar's Fire Blast and eases Piloswine's matchup versus Ice-type Pokemon such as Jynx and Cryogonal. An EV spread utilizing maximum HP and Defense EVs with an Impish nature can be used on more defensive teams, but in general Piloswine's moveset and stat distribution favor a tankier build.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Set up Stealth Rock as early as possible, but beware of common leads such as Archeops, which prevent Piloswine from doing so with Taunt. It should be noted that while Archeops can prevent Stealth Rock with Taunt, it will always go down to either the combination of Icicle Crash and Ice Shard or Icicle Spear. Earthquake is useful for hitting common Stealth Rock users such as Rhydon and Probopass super effectively. Switch Piloswine into Electric- and Ice-type attackers such as Rotom, Electivire, and Cryogonal, as they typically fail to deal large amounts of damage to Piloswine and do not appreciate taking its STAB moves. Ice Shard can be useful late-game to clean up weakened offensive Pokemon such as Swellow, Archeops, and Lilligant. Note that Piloswine does not have access to recovery; as such, allowing it to take repeated hits is not wise.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-type Pokemon such as Vileplume and Gourgeist can switch into Water- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Piloswine, and they also appreciate Piloswine's ability to switch into Ice-type moves. Psychic-type Pokemon such as Mesprit, Musharna, and Xatu can take Fighting-type attacks aimed at Piloswine; however, they need to be wary of Knock Off. Fairy-type Pokemon such as Mega Audino can switch into both Fighting-type attacks and Knock Off. Wish and Healing Wish users such as Audino, Mesprit, and Lilligant can offer Piloswine recovery throughout the game.</p>"

  "Smeargle": {
    "overview": "<p>Smeargle's ability to learn every move in the game makes it an excellent suicide lead on offensive teams, as it's the only Pokemon that is able to learn all of Spore, Stealth Rock, and Sticky Web. Its decent Speed tier allows it to effectively get up multiple hazards versus slower Pokemon, and it is one of the few viable Sticky Web users in the tier. However, Smeargle can be played around fairly easily and is shut down by Taunt, Lum Berry Pokemon, and Xatu for the most part. Smeargle also becomes setup fodder for any Pokemon that doesn't care about Nuzzle, such as Rhydon, Torterra, or Golurk, after Sleep Clause is activated. It is also pressured by Rapid Spin and Defog users like Hitmonchan, Skuntank, and Claydol, as they can get rid of all hazards Smeargle sets up; Rapid Spin users do this most effectively due to their ability to KO Smeargle with Rapid Spin once it's brought down to its Focus Sash. Furthermore, when running Dark Void, Smeargle may fail to do its job of setting up hazards if Dark Void misses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>U-turn can be used over either Skill Swap or Nuzzle to gain momentum and safely switch out versus Taunt users like Floatzel and Mismagius and into a teammate that can handle said Pokemon. Magic Coat can be used to ensure at least one layer of hazards versus Taunt users. Memento can be picked over Skill Swap or Nuzzle, as it prevents the foe from using Rapid Spin or Defog on the same turn, as well as providing a free switch to something that can threaten the Pokemon currently on the field. It also allows for easier setup opportunities for Pokemon like Shell Smash Barbaracle and Swords Dance Samurott.</p> <p>Smeargle can also pull off a level 1 Trick Room + Endeavor set with decent success, but it is stopped easily by any priority attack and is pretty easy to deal with, especially considering there are much better Trick Room users than Smeargle.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fast Taunt Users</strong>: Faster Taunt users like Archeops, Mismagius, and Floatzel usually prevent Smeargle from getting up any entry hazards, although they have to be wary of getting crippled by Nuzzle.</p> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu's ability Magic Bounce allows it to bounce back any hazards Smeargle tries to set up, as well as Spore and Dark Void, completely ruining Smeargle's chances to do anything. While Skill Swap is exclusively used for Xatu, not all Smeargle run it, and the Smeargle user still has to predict correctly in order to be able to get up hazards.</p> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Kangaskhan can outspeed Smeargle and KO it with the combination of Fake Out and Return, breaking through its Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Absorbers</strong>: Sleep absorbers such as Magmortar, Sliggoo, and Malamar, Grass-type Pokemon, and Lum Berry Pokemon can all avoid getting hit by Spore and prevent Smeargle from setting up multiple layers of hazards.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Inducers</strong>: Sleep inducers such as Lilligant, Jynx, and Vivillon can put Smeargle to sleep, limiting the number of hazards it can set up depending on the number of sleep turns.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sticky Web lowers the Speed of all opposing grounded Pokemon so your team gains the Speed advantage over the opponent's. Stealth Rock allows Smeargle to wear down Pokemon on the switch in, as well as breaking Sturdy and Focus Sash. Smeargle running Stealth Rock also frees up an extra slot for teammates like Mesprit and Rhydon. Spore and Dark Void provide Smeargle free turns to set up hazards, which it struggles to do otherwise due to its low bulk. Spore is generally more useful, as it has perfect accuracy, but Dark Void allows Smeargle to put Grass-types to sleep at the cost of having a chance to miss. Skill Swap is used to take away Xatu's Magic Bounce ability so that Smeargle can set up hazards on it instead of them getting bounced back to your side of the field. It can also be utilized as an emergency check to Malamar and a way to prevent Lanturn from using Volt Switch on Smeargle while regaining health. Nuzzle allows Smeargle to paralyze faster Taunt users such as Floatzel and Archeops, which normally completely shut it down. It also makes Smeargle able to paralyze Xatu through Magic Bounce, which is why it's preferred over Thunder Wave. Smeargle can also run Explosion in the last slot, as it prevents foes from using Defog or Rapid Spin, as well as being a decently strong move in general.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature make Smeargle outpace Xatu, Samurott, Adamant Shiftry, and Adamant Hitmonchan, allowing it to either Spore them or put up multiple layers of hazards. The Speed also makes it so Smeargle can Skill Swap Xatu and lay up hazards on the next turn so it can get up at least one layer of hazards in a one-on-one situation. Smeargle doesn't get any useful abilities for its supposed role, and Own Tempo is the only ability that may come in handy sometimes, as it can help versus random Hurricane confusions or Confuse Ray users. An EV spread of 80 HP / 96 Def / 80 SpD maximizes Smeargle's bulk while maintaining maximum Speed. This is useful for taking weaker hits like multiple Rock Blasts from Rhydon, as well as avoiding the 2HKO from common defensive Pokemon such as Lanturn, Mantine, and Mega Audino. However, if Explosion is used, the HP, Defense, and Special Defense EVs should be placed in Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Smeargle should always be used as a suicide lead and is almost never worth preserving for later in the match. Against most teams, going for Spore or Dark Void, Sticky Web, and Stealth Rock in that specific order is the best series of plays. Sticky Web should always be prioritized when facing more offensive teams, and Stealth Rock versus more defensive ones. Exceptions for this are if the opposing team has multiple Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Scyther and Charizard and doesn't care much about Sticky Web. This is especially important if the opponent has poor or no hazard removal. Be wary when setting up Sticky Web versus teams with Pokemon that can take advantage of it such as Malamar and Pawniard, as it boosts their Speed and Attack, respectively. Faster Taunt users like Archeops and Floatzel completely shut down Smeargle aside from Nuzzle, which is something to keep in mind. Setup Pokemon that don't mind Nuzzle from Smeargle such as Rhydon, Torterra, and Golurk can set up for free after Sleep Clause is activated. Lastly, opposing Rapid Spin and Defog users should be kept under high pressure throughout the entire game, and as few opportunities for Defog should be given as possible. Hazard removal can be prevented with Taunt users and spinblockers, such as Mismagius, Rotom, and Skuntank.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spinblockers like Rotom and Mismagius are great partners for Smeargle, as they prevents foes from using Rapid Spin to get rid of any entry hazards Smeargle has managed to put up on the field. Slower setup sweepers that benefit from Sticky Web, such as Samurott and Shiftry, are good partners for Smeargle because they are far more threatening when they get the Speed advantage on their offensive checks. Slower wallbreakers like Aurorus, Aggron, and Magmortar heavily appreciate the Sticky Web support that Smeargle provides, as it allows them to outpace a majority of offensive checks that would normally be able to outspeed and KO them. Lastly, Pokemon that either can prevent Defog via Taunt or are able to pressure common Defog users like Shiftry, Mantine, and Skuntank are great partners for Smeargle, as they allow the hazards that it has set up to be on the opposing side of the field for as long as possible, if not for the entirety of the match. Good examples include Tauros and Archeops.</p>"

  "Miltank": {
    "overview": "<p>With its great physical bulk, Miltank is able to take on top-tier threats such as Tauros and Kangaskhan. In addition, access to reliable recovery makes sure that Miltank is able to outlast the Pokemon it checks. Miltank also has a slew of support options in Thunder Wave, Heal Bell, and Stealth Rock, making it a very helpful asset for some teams. Miltank's Speed also sets it apart other walls such as Mega Audino, as it outspeeds some slower offensive Pokemon with minimal investment. Thanks to Sap Sipper, Miltank has an immunity to Grass-type attacks, particularly Sleep Powder, making it a great check to Grass-types such as Lilligant and Shiftry. Though Miltank does face some competition from Mega Audino, Miltank does not rely on Wish and Protect for recovery, freeing up a moveslot for it to run another support move and giving it more versatility. Miltank does, however, have mediocre Special Defense, which leaves it vulnerable to special attackers such as Samurott, Magmortar, Mesprit, and Ludicolo. Miltank's Normal typing leaves it with almost no resistances and causes it to be threatened by the many Fighting-types that roam the tier, hindering its walling capabilities. Miltank also tends to be setup bait for Substitute users and Pokemon that resist Body Slam such as Klinklang, Rhydon, and Mismagius.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Curse set with a specially defensive spread can work well and allow Miltank to fulfill a win condition once it attains a few boosts and Fighting-type Pokemon are eliminated. Scrappy can be chosen so that Miltank is not walled by Ghost-types such as Rotom and Haunter, but Sap Sipper generally has much better utility. An offensive set can also be used, as Miltank sits at a good Speed tier and is able to get past Ferroseed with Fire Punch, but it is otherwise largely outclassed by Kangaskhan. A specially defensive spread with Thick Fat is another option that allows Miltank to take on specially based Fire- and Ice-types very well at the cost of significantly lowering its physical bulk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Primeape, Hitmonchan, and Hariyama switch in on most of Miltank's moves and threaten Miltank with their respective STAB attacks, though they do not appreciate Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Life Orb Samurott, Ludicolo, and Mesprit take advantage of Miltank's mediocre Special Defense by easily 2HKOing it, though none of these Pokemon can safely switch in because they would be crippled by status ailments.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Substitute users such as Klinklang, Huntail, and Articuno can use Miltank to set up Substitute freely, blocking any status moves. Klinklang also resists Miltank's Body Slam and can set up on it with Shift Gear, while Articuno is able to stall Miltank with the combination of Roost and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users, such as Samurott, Haunter, and Pyroar, stop Miltank from healing itself, spreading status ailments, and setting up Stealth Rock. Miltank still has a chance to paralyze these Pokemon with Body Slam with the exception of Haunter due to its immunity to the move, crippling them for the rest of the match.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Body Slam is a reliable STAB move with a nice chance to paralyze the foe, discouraging Pokemon from switching in. Milk Drink is a reliable recovery move that ensures Miltank stays healthy throughout the match. Toxic wears Pokemon down with residual damage and is the only move Miltank can hit Rotom with. Thunder Wave allows Miltank to reliably paralyze the foe, crippling many fast Pokemon such as Tauros, Kangaskhan, and Lilligant. Stealth Rock wears down the opposing team with residual damage, supporting teammates very well. Heal Bell rids Miltank and its teammates of any harmful status ailments such as poison and burn. Seismic Toss is another option over Body Slam so that Miltank is able to reliably break Klinklang's Substitute. Earthquake is another option that can be used over either status move to ensure that Miltank is not setup bait for Klinklang, as well as to hit Garbodor and Probopass.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread with an Impish nature makes Miltank as physically bulky as possible, allowing it to take on Tauros and Kangaskhan. 16 Speed EVs are used to outspeed neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Samurott and Ludicolo. Sap Sipper allows Miltank to check Grass-types such as Lilligant and prevents it from being put to sleep by Sleep Powder. Thick Fat is another option to give Miltank resistances to Fire- and Ice-type attacks, allowing Miltank to check Abomasnow, Ninetales, Aurorus and non-Focus Blast Magmortar and Jynx. If Thick Fat is chosen, a specially defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 240 SpD / 16 Spe with a Careful nature is a viable option as most Ice- and Fire-type Pokemon are special attackers.  Leftovers gives Miltank passive recovery, increasing its longevity and lessening the need to use Milk Drink to restore HP. Rocky Helmet is another option to wear down physical attackers, most notably Klinklang, as it takes Rocky Helmet damage twice with Gear Grind, as well as to punish U-turn users such as Scyther.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to keep Miltank healthy throughout the match with Milk Drink. Generally, it's best to restore HP or set up Stealth Rock against Pokemon that cannot do much damage to Miltank such as Tauros and Kangaskhan. Furthermore, Miltank can even set up Stealth Rock freely against Grass-type Pokemon such as Lilligant and Jumpluff thanks to Sap Sipper. It is also worth noting that Miltank is able to stall out Pokemon inflicted with Toxic by repeatedly using Milk Drink. Body Slam is usually a decent move to use early-game to get chip damage and possibly paralyze switch-ins. It also should be used when Miltank is relatively healthy to discourage Pokemon from switching in due to the risk of paralysis. Thunder Wave should be used against fast offensive Pokemon and some weather sweepers to cripple them for the rest of the match. Heal Bell should be used whenever Miltank or a teammate has been inflicted with a status ailment.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Poison-types such as Garbodor, Weezing, and Vileplume make for great partners, as they can switch in on Fighting-types with ease, and the former is also able to absorb Toxic Spikes, support Miltank with entry hazards of its own, and punish physical attackers with chip damage from Rocky Helmet and Aftermath. Vileplume appreciates Miltank's ability to heal status conditions, particularly burns, enabling it to check Scald users more easily. Psychic-types such as Mesprit, Xatu, and Musharna pair well with Miltank due to their ability to check Fighting-types and retaliate with their STAB moves. Musharna also appreciates Miltank's ability to heal any harmful status effects, enabling Musharna to stay healthy throughout the match. Xatu has a 4x resistance to Fighting-type moves and bounces back any entry hazards that may wear Miltank down, specifically keeping Toxic Spikes off the field so that Miltank is not forced to use Heal Bell each time it switches in.</p> <p>Miltank also fits well on balanced teams that are in need of a Stealth Rock user that can cripple offensive Pokemon with Thunder Wave. Pokemon such as Swords Dance Samurott and Magmortar appreciate Thunder Wave support, allowing them to sweep faster teams easily, and also appreciate Miltank's ability to switch into Lilligant thanks to Sap Sipper. Bulky Water-types such as Prinplup and Pelipper pair well with Miltank, as they appreciate Miltank's ability to switch in on Grass-type attacks and its Heal Bell support. In return, both can remove entry hazards with Defog, and the latter easily switches in on Fighting-type attacks.</p>"

  "Combusken": {
    "overview": "<p>Combusken stands out thanks to an incredible ability in Speed Boost, causing it to be more and more difficult to revenge kill as turns pass and making it an effective mid- to late-game cleaner. Combusken also sports high-Base Power STAB moves that are nearly unresisted on their own, and with the flexibility to run both special and physical sets, it can be quite the terror for offensive and balanced teams alike to switch into. Its Fire / Fighting typing is also beneficial defensively, helping it check some particularly threatening Pokemon such as Shiftry, Abomasnow, and Liepard and making it one of the few physical attackers in the tier immune to burn. However, without Eviolite, Combusken's bulk is rather mediocre, making it relatively easy to take down, especially with a priority user such as Samurott or Kabutops. Combusken's base Speed is also very lacking, which causes it to still be outsped by some prominent offensive Pokemon even at +1 such as Tauros, Archeops, and Floatzel. While its STAB moves do possess high Base Power, its low offensive stats ultimately hold it back against bulkier Pokemon such as Musharna and Mega Audino, both of which can use Combusken as setup fodder depending on the set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Rock could be used on the Special set to OHKO Charizard; however, it is extremely weak and sacrifices the ability to 2HKO Mantine with Hidden Power Electric.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Mantine and Pelipper both resist Combusken's STAB combination, with the former being a more consistent check to its Life Orb set and the latter to its Swords Dance set. Both, however, need to watch out for Hidden Power Electric, as it OHKOes Pelipper and 2HKOes Mantine. Lanturn can switch into both sets relatively well and does not fear any coverage move Combusken carries. More offensive Water-types such as Samurott and Kabutops cannot switch in safely, but with prior damage, they can revenge kill Combusken with Aqua Jet, regardless of how fast it is.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Combusken's very lacking base Speed, fast Pokemon such as Tauros, Floatzel, and Swellow can outspeed and revenge kill it at +1. Some Choice Scarf users such as Jynx, Haunter, and Rotom are all capable of outspeeding Combusken at +2 and KOing it with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Charizard</strong>: Charizard resists both of Combusken's STAB moves and threatens to OHKO in return with a STAB Air Slash or Acrobatics. However, it must be wary of Hidden Power Electric or Thunder Punch.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Altaria, Grumpig, Sliggoo, Mega Audino, and Clefairy all can switch into any of Life Orb Combusken's moves thanks to their resistances or raw bulk. Assault Vest Hariyama and Magmortar can both switch into Combusken's specially based set with ease, making them solid checks; however, they will fall to Swords Dance sets, as both are OHKOed by a +2 Low Kick.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Quagsire hard counters Combusken's Swords Dance set, taking a pittance from all of its moves and ignoring its Swords Dance boosts thanks to Unaware. Though Garbodor takes a significant amount of damage from a +2 Flare Blitz, the combination of Rocky Helmet, Aftermath, and Flare Blitz recoil wears down Combusken to the point where it's heavily weakened or KOes itself. Do note, though, that both of these Pokemon are swiftly taken down by its special set.</p>",

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast has good neutral coverage, targeting Pokemon such as Shiftry, Lilligant, Steelix, and Scyther. Focus Blast nails Rock-types that resist Fire Blast such as Rhydon, Barbaracle, and Regirock and lands solid damage against the likes of Lanturn, Poliwrath, Samurott, and Hariyama. Protect is primarily used to stall a turn out so that Combusken can gain a free Speed boost, but it also is useful for scouting for the foe's next move. Hidden Power Electric targets Mantine, Pelipper, and Charizard, all of which can otherwise switch into Combusken's STAB combination. Will-O-Wisp lets Combusken cripple physical attackers such as Hariyama and Samurott on the switch and lets it punish the use of Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs and a Timid nature are crucial for Combusken to outspeed Liepard and Pyroar after +1, while maximum Special Attack EVs ensure it hits as hard as possible. Speed Boost is absolutely necessary, as it enables Combusken to gradually gain boosts to its Speed at the end of each turn, making it the threat it is to many offensive teams. Life Orb is used to boost Combusken's power further and lets it switch its moves. Eviolite is also an option to give Combusken additional bulk to let it better pivot into certain Pokemon such as Shiftry and Vileplume at the cost of some power. Running Eviolite generally works better on teams where another Pokemon, such as Musharna, can pass Special Attack boosts.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Combusken's bad defenses, it's generally advised not to bring it directly into attacks; rather, it should be brought in with U-turn or Volt Switch or after a Pokemon has fainted. Once it's brought in, use Protect to gain a Speed boost, letting Combusken outspeed faster offensive Pokemon on the following turn. Protect also has use in scouting for the foe's next move; this is especially helpful for Choice item users such as Primeape and Aurorus or Fake Out users such as Hariyama and Kangaskhan. Be wary when using Protect against a Pokemon that can set up, as the free turn can give the foe an opening to sweep. Just be aware that the foe can react to a switch to another teammate by double switching themselves or using a coverage move that deals significant damage. When pinned up against Samurott or Kabutops, do not stay in or use Protect as both revenge kill Combusken no matter how fast it is with Aqua Jet and can set up a Swords Dance should they force Combusken out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-types such as Lilligant are great offensive checks to the likes of Samurott, Lanturn, and Kabutops. Both are also capable of repeatedly wearing down Hariyama, while the former can threaten Magmortar with a Life Orb-boosted Earthquake. Malamar can use bulky Pokemon that switch into Combusken as setup fodder. Slower offensive Pokemon such as Samurott and Kabutops are capable of breaking through specially bulky Pokemon that give Combusken trouble, while Combusken destroys Grass-types in return. Samurott in particular pairs very well with Combusken as it greatly appreciates Mantine and Pelipper lured in with Hidden Power Electric. Moreover, Combusken is able to take down the likes of Vileplume and Ferroseed for the former two.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance increases Combusken's Attack significantly, letting it easily sweep through weakened teams. Flare Blitz is Combusken's strongest, and most reliable, physical Fire-type STAB move, heavily denting any Pokemon that does not resist it, though it comes with the cost of recoil damage. Low Kick lets Combusken nail Rhydon, Barbaracle, and Hariyama, all of which switch into Flare Blitz with ease. Protect lets Combusken gain a free Speed boost, letting it revenge kill some offensive Pokemon before a boost. Brick Break can be used over Low Kick to hit Lanturn, but this is generally not advised because it misses out on a lot of power versus Rhydon and Hariyama. Thunder Punch can be used over Protect to hit Pelipper, Mantine, and Charizard, all of which wall this set otherwise. Just note that giving up Protect makes Combusken significantly easier to revenge kill.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Jolly nature let Combusken outspeed Pyroar and Liepard after +1, while maximum Attack EVs are used to ensure it hits as hard as possible. An Adamant nature is also an option for additional power if Combusken doesn't mind missing out on outspeeding a few select Pokemon. Speed Boost is necessary to let Combusken outspeed more and more Pokemon after each turn, making it difficult to revenge kill with several boosts outside of priority. Eviolite is used to increase Combusken's bulk significantly, giving it more opportunities to set up and sweep the opposing team.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thanks to its typing and decent Eviolite-boosted bulk, Combusken can find setup opportunities against Pokemon such as Shiftry, Skuntank, Vileplume, and Lilligant. Passive Pokemon such as Audino and Ferroseed can also make for good setup bait; just watch out for Thunder Wave from the latter. Generally, Combusken should not be brought in until the mid- or late-game, as it needs all the HP it can preserve in order to set up easily later. Use Protect in order to gain a free Speed boost, allowing Combusken to outspeed its foe and potentially KO it. Protect is also useful to scout for any stray status or coverage moves the foe may have, as well as evade being hit by Fake Out from the likes of Hariyama and Kangaskhan.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-types such as Lilligant and Shiftry are all able to threaten Water-types such as Lanturn, Quagsire, Pelipper, and Mantine. Shiftry is also notable for its ability to threaten bulky Psychic-types such as Musharna and Mesprit with Knock Off. Rotom threatens both Mantine and Pelipper with its STAB moves and pressures Lanturn with the combination of Will-O-Wisp and Hex. It also performs well against Psychic-types, most notably Xatu, which can otherwise take a hit from Combusken and OHKO it back with Psychic. Entry hazard support from the likes of Mesprit and Ferroseed helps soften up checks to Combusken, with Stealth Rock putting a lot pressure on Pelipper and Mantine. In addition, Mesprit can give Combusken a second shot at sweeping with Healing Wish and threaten Garbodor, which can significantly wear down Combusken with Rocky Helmet and Aftermath. Ferroseed can also can switch into other bulky Water-types and cripple Musharna with Toxic. Lanturn can pivot into Mantine, Pelipper, and other Water-types and also tends to invite Grass-types in, which Combusken can use as set up bait.</p>"

Unfortunately, poor defensive stats and HP often make it challenging to successfully use Belly Drum. Linoone also lacks a reliable way to bypass Steel-types such as Steelix, Ferroseed, and Mawile even at +6, and its poor Attack stat means it will fail to OHKO bulkier Pokemon such as Weezing and Mega Audino. Lastly, Linoone is very one-dimensional, so an experienced opponent will know what to expect and be wary of giving Linoone an opportunity to set up.</p>",

Salac Berry can be used over Sitrus Berry, allowing Linoone to outspeed Ghost-types that usually revenge kill it such as Mismagius, Haunter, and Rotom while maintaining an Adamant nature, but most of the time the extra HP from a Sitrus Berry is more useful for setting up with Linoone and avoiding revenge killers with priority.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types, especially Steelix, Ferroseed, Mawile, and Aggron, completely wall Linoone and can beat it one-on-one even when it is at +6.</p> <p><strong>Faster Ghost-Types</strong>: Ghost-types that outpace Linoone such as Rotom, Mismagius, and Haunter are immune to Extreme Speed and can revenge kill Adamant Linoone.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Any form of chip damage, such as from Rocky Helmet, entry hazards, sand and hail, or Aftermath from Garbodor and Skuntank, makes it very difficult to set up a Belly Drum with Linoone.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Incredibly physically bulky Pokemon such as Miltank, Weezing, and Mega Audino can take a +6 Extreme Speed from full and respond with a status move that will hinder Linoone's sweep.

      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Belly Drum raises Linoone's otherwise lackluster Attack stat to +6 at the cost of 50% of its maximum HP. Extreme Speed is a powerful STAB and priority move and maximizes Linoone's sweeping potential alongside Belly Drum. Seed Bomb hits bulky Rock-types such as Rhydon, Regirock, and Omastar that resist Extreme Speed, with the added benefit of nailing Quagsire for 4x super effective damage. Shadow Claw smacks Gourgeist-XL and Trevenant for super effective damage while also hitting Ferroseed neutrally and nailing Psychic-types such as defensive Mesprit and Musharna for more damage than Extreme Speed. Substitute allows Linoone to dodge status from defensive Pokemon such as Bronzor, Altaria, and Clefairy and makes it even harder to revenge kill.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment allows Linoone to hit as hard as possible, while the HP and mixed defensive investment maximizes its bulk. An alternate spread of 160 HP / 252 Atk / 96 Spe can be used to outpace non-Speed-boosting nature base 80s, such as Mesprit and Kabutops, and smack them with super effective Shadow Claw and Seed Bomb; however, this is fairly niche and normally outclassed by the increased bulk of the main EV spread. Another EV spread of 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Ghost-types that can usually revenge kill Linoone and cut its sweep short, such as Haunter and Rotom. This niche, however, is usually not worth the drop in power and loss of bulk when compared to the main spread. Sitrus Berry is the selected item, aiding Linoone in its search to find opportunities to set up a Belly Drum throughout a battle. Linoone's ability is largely irrelevant, as Quick Feet is illegal with Extreme Speed, and Sitrus Berry already activates at 50%, so Gluttony is essentially useless as well. Pickup is similarly almost never actually useful in battle but is slightly more optimal than the other abilities listed, as it can allow Linoone to pick up an item vs other Sitrus Berry users such as Drifblim and opposing Linoone on rare occasions.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Linoone is a frail Pokemon that offers next to no defensive utility, so avoid switching it into attacks. Linoone is also typically best used as a late-game cleaner, once its checks such as Steelix, Ferroseed, Mawile, and faster Ghost-types have been weakened. In almost all cases, Linoone will only have one opportunity to set up Belly Drum throughout a battle, so do not recklessly attempt to do so. It is usually unwise to attempt to set up on any offensive Pokemon without the assistance of Light Screen, Reflect or Memento, and any defensive Pokemon with status moves such as Will-O-Wisp will also deter Linoone's sweep. Due to these factors, setting up with Linoone is often very difficult but can be done against Taunted defensive Pokemon such as Miltank, Bronzor, and Clefairy or a handicapped offensive Pokemon, such as a burned physical attacker or a Pokemon that has been put to sleep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can pressure or lure in opposing Steel-types such as Hidden Power Fire Mesprit, Heat Wave Archeops, and Focus Blast Garbodor work well with Linoone, as they blow through the aforementioned Steel-types that Linoone despises. Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank, Liepard, and Choice Band Scyther are solid teammates to pair with Linoone, as they can efficiently trap Ghost-types that make it hard for Linoone to spam Extreme Speed. In a similar vein, Probopass can trap Steel-types such as Steelix, Mawile, and Aggron with ease due to Magnet Pull while also setting up Stealth Rock to aid Linoone in an eventual Belly Drum sweep. Linoone greatly appreciates Spikes support from the likes of Garbodor, Ferroseed, and Omastar, as Spikes helps mitigate Linoone's mediocre Attack stat by weakening defensive Pokemon capable of surviving a +6 Extreme Speed, such as Mega Audino, Miltank, and Mawile. These entry hazards also break Focus Sashes and Sturdy, which would otherwise likely cut Linoone's sweep short. Similarly, Linoone requires hazard removal of its own, as it is already hard enough for Linoone to set up from full HP. Light Screen and Reflect help mitigate Linoone's somewhat poor defenses and make setting up a Belly Drum much easier. Some better users of Light Screen and Reflect are Xatu, Claydol, and Mesprit. Finally, Memento support from the likes of Skuntank and Mismagius also makes setting up with Linoone far easier and has the added benefit of providing Linoone with a free switch in against a vulnerable foe.</p>"

  "Ludicolo": {
    "overview": "<p>Ludicolo is the definition of a Rain Dance sweeper in the NU tier. With access to Swift Swim, which doubles its Speed under rain, it can easily sweep teams late-game, especially offensive ones, which tend to be more fragile. On top of that, Ludicolo sports an amazing secondary typing in Grass, which greatly helps it deal with other Water-types that could switch into it, like Lanturn, Poliwrath, and Prinplup. Finally, its good special bulk coupled with a decent defensive typing means that it can also act as a soft check to some Pokemon and even set up Rain Dance on them, including Steelix, Lilligant, and Samurott lacking Megahorn. Unfortunately, while Ludicolo is incredibly fast under rain, in a weatherless situation, it can only dream of outspeeding common threats due to it sitting in a bad Speed tier for an offensive Pokemon, Ludicolo might have trouble setting up Rain Dance against offensively inclined teams, usually relying on support given by its teammates to work properly. As if that weren't already bad enough, it struggles to get past common Pokemon such as Mantine, Ferroseed, and Abomasnow, with the first two not minding Ludicolo's assaults at all and the latter even being able to cancel rain.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A specially defensive set is an option if your team needs an overall good check for specially offensive Grass-, Fire-, and Water-types. With access to disruptive moves such as Scald, Synthesis, Leech Seed, Substitute, Toxic, and Knock Off, Ludicolo can easily annoy the opposing team, spreading status and removing items. Choice Scarf is a good alternative item for Ludicolo, letting it outspeed the likes of Lilligant and Swellow, making it an immediate threat against offensive teams, while also pairing very well with teammates that can deal passive damage to the opposing team through the match, such as Garbodor and Ferroseed, weakening the foe enough to help Ludicolo clean up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Water</strong>: With Hydro Pump being Ludicolo's strongest move, the likes of Mantine, Cacturne, Jynx, and Cradily can stop Ludicolo from spamming its Water-type STAB move thanks to their access to Water Absorb, Dry Skin, or Storm Drain. From there, the foe can answer accordingly by either threatening Ludicolo offensively in Jynx's and Cacturne's cases or poisoning it in Mantine's and Cradily's cases.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Even though Ludicolo has Ice Beam, it won't always get past bulky Grass-types such as Vileplume, Roselia, Ferroseed, and Abomasnow. The first two can stomach Ice Beam and hit back with Sludge Bomb, Ferroseed can take any hit and cripple Ludicolo with Thunder Wave or remove its Life Orb with Knock Off, and Abomasnow makes use of Snow Warning to summon hail, completely erasing rain from the field, and can threaten Ludicolo with a strong Blizzard or Wood Hammer.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Scyther and Tauros are able to outspeed Ludicolo with or without rain present and OHKO with their STAB moves. Scyther is outsped by Timid Ludicolo, however. Kabutops can take advantage of Ludicolo's Rain and OHKO with a powerful Stone Edge. Priority users such as Shiftry, Skuntank, and Kangaskhan take advantage of Ludicolo's bad Defense by hitting with a strong Sucker Punch or Fake Out.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Even though nothing neutral to Water enjoys taking a rain-boosted Hydro Pump, some bulky Pokemon can tank one hit and handle Ludicolo appropriately. Mega Audino can use the combination of Wish and Protect to stall out rain turns, Malamar can remove Ludicolo's Life Orb and greatly decrease its damage output, bulky Scyther can live one hit and strike back with a super effective Aerial Ace or U-turn, and Articuno can promptly OHKO Ludicolo with Freeze-Dry.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rain Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Ludicolo's main STAB option and receives a strong power boost if rain is on the field; alternatively, Surf offers a more accurate, yet weaker, Water-type STAB move that shines against offensive teams, which often rely on Ludicolo missing its move, but running it comes at the cost of missing important benchmarks, like the 2HKO on Assault Vest Hariyama after Stealth Rock under rain. Giga Drain is Ludicolo's secondary STAB move, allowing it to deal super effective damage against bulky Water-types such as Lanturn and Samurott that could switch in on Hydro Pump, as well as Pokemon immune to Water thanks to abilities like Water Absorb, Dry Skin, and Storm Drain, while recovering its HP in the process, which greatly helps it last longer. Ice Beam pairs nicely with Ludicolo's STAB moves, hitting Grass- and Dragon-types such as Vileplume, Roselia, and Altaria super effectively. Rain Dance turns Ludicolo into a fearsome sweeper, doubling its Speed and boosting Hydro Pump's Base Power. If Rain Dance support is already offered by another teammate, Ludicolo can opt for Focus Blast, an amazing coverage move that helps it deal with common checks to rain teams, such as Abomasnow, Ferroseed, and Cradily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment augments Ludicolo's offensive prowess, helping it deal as much damage as possible while outspeeding the majority of the tier. A Modest nature coupled with Life Orb further boosts Ludicolo's damage output, increasing its sweeping capabilities. Timid is an option over Modest, allowing Ludicolo to outspeed Choice Scarf Scyther in rain, Swift Swim Kabutops, and every neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon, most notably Adamant Dance Samurott.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thanks to its typing and special bulk, Ludicolo can easily use the likes of Lilligant, Steelix (though it must watch out for Toxic), Samurott without Megahorn, and Xatu and Lanturn, both without Thunder Wave, to set up Rain Dance, but take care not to use it too early, as Ludicolo needs the opposing team to be properly weakened before attempting a sweep. The fact that it also needs a free turn to use Rain Dance before turning into a fearsome sweeper means that Ludicolo has to be healthy, so playing conservatively with it early- and mid-game is a good idea, especially by trying not to force a sweep too early: even if there are still a couple of rain turns on the field, switching it out is wise if the opposing Pokemon poses a threat by being able to tank a hit and cripple Ludicolo. That doesn't mean that you can't make use of its offensive power, though, as even without rain Ludicolo can threaten the opposing team with its Water, Grass, and Ice coverage, firing off powerful hits to weaken its checks, paving the way for a sweep later.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can deal with the likes of Mantine and bulky Grass-types are needed to help Ludicolo succeed. Rotom and Rotom-S are great for this job, with both being able to hit Mantine super effectively and the latter also being able to use Air Slash to hit Grass-types. Fire-types, while at first seeming contradictory when paired with a Rain Dance user, actually make for nice partners. They can take on annoying Grass-types such as Vileplume, Roselia, and Ferroseed while soft checking the annoying Abomasnow and letting Ludicolo deal with Water-types, helping each other achieve the goal of sweeping the opposing team. Mixed Abomasnow presents itself as a great option to take out both Grass-types and generally bulky Pokemon that could take on Ludicolo, like Mantine and Mega Audino.</p> <p>Pokemon that directly benefit from Rain Dance also are good teammates. Other Swift Swim sweepers, especially Kabutops, can take advantage of Ludicolo's rain to break through the opponent's team, forming a scary core of incredibly fast Pokemon with a strong, boosted STAB type. In terms of supporters, dedicated Rain Dance setters like Liepard and Mesprit can help Ludicolo by giving it rain without having to risk finding free turns to do so. On top of that, the rain setter will often carry Damp Rock, giving even more turns for Ludicolo to attempt to sweep.</p>"

  "Vigoroth": {
    "overview": "<p>Vigoroth has a niche in the NU metagame due to its decent Speed tier that allows it to outspeed almost every defensive Pokemon, great Eviolite-boosted bulk, and ability to act as a setup sweeper. Its combination of decent Speed, Taunt, and reliable recovery makes it really difficult for stall to beat, allowing it to act as an effective stallbreaker. Vigoroth's access to Vital Spirit also allows it to check sleep inducers like Lilligant and Vivillon, which are very threatening in the NU metagame. Besides that, Vigoroth has a decent defensive typing in Normal, giving it only one weakness in Fighting, which can help it serve as a wincon. However, Vigoroth has a serious lack of power before it boosts with Bulk Up, and any status ailment that it acquires can severely hinder its ability to perform sufficiently. Vigoroth also suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, meaning that it doesn't have room to run any good coverage moves, which prevents it from hitting Ghost-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Amnesia can be used in the third slot to let Vigoroth take advantage of its Special Defense to make it bulkier overall; however, Taunt is generally better and more useful, and Substitute is crucial to let Vigoroth absorb status moves. An offensive set with Earthquake, Fire Punch, Sucker Punch, and either Substitute or Slack Off can be used to give Vigoroth the ability to 2HKO Aggron, Ferroseed, and Rotom respectively, all of which are normally counters to it. You can even use Encore in the last moveslot to let Vigoroth take advantage of its Speed and lock the foe into a status move like Stealth Rock or Sleep Talk; however, this set requires a Normal-type STAB move so Vigoroth isn't dead weight versus frail offensive threats. A defensive set with Taunt, Toxic, Seismic Toss, and Slack off is a viable option to lure Ghost-types in and stall them out with Toxic, which makes Vigoroth good on Normal spam teams, although Pokemon like Swellow and Pyroar are better choices. Body Slam can be used over Return because, despite the lower Base Power, it lets Vigoroth paralyze certain switch-ins such as Primeape and Pyroar, giving it more early game utility, and the loss of power is a moot point if Vigoroth manages to boost up to +6 later on.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types like Choice Scarf Rotom can use Trick against Vigoroth to remove its Eviolite while it can't do anything in return. Mismagius and Haunter can also break Vigoroth easily due to their coverage, secondary STAB moves and access to Taunt. Moreover, Ghost-types in general can easily counter Vigoroth because it has absolutely zero way of hitting them, considering that all of its attacking moves are Normal-type.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fast Fighting-types, like Hitmonchan and Primeape, can prevent Vigoroth from setting up with their offensive pressure. Vigoroth can Taunt Gurdurr to stop it from setting up against it, but it's still a difficult matchup unless Vigoroth already has a lot of boosts from Bulk Up due to Gurdurr's Knock Off and STAB Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status like poison and burns can cripple and wear down Vigoroth really easily if it is not behind a Substitute; however, Vigoroth needs to worry most about getting burned or badly poisoned on the switch from Scald and Toxic users if it lacks Substitute or Facade.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Vigoroth may have great special bulk, but it's still relatively unprotected, so strong special attackers like Pyroar, Aurorus, Jynx, Ludicolo, Choice Specs Mesprit, and Magmortar can put a lot of pressure on Vigoroth while it struggles to take them down quickly enough; however, they all need to be cautious of Body Slam paralyzing them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bulk Up lets Vigoroth boost its Attack and Defense, letting it properly perform as a bulky setup sweeper. Slack Off is Vigoroth's main form of recovery, letting it maintain a decent level of health, spam Bulk Up, and continuously attack the foe and heal up. Taunt lets Vigoroth cripple setup sweepers, clerics, and phazers, and it lets it take care of passive Pokemon like Bronzor and Ferroseed. Substitute provides Vigoroth with a buffer for moves that can harm it, such as Scald, Sludge Bomb, and Clear Smog, and it also lets it scout for revenge killers. Most importantly, though, Taunt and Substitute prevent bulkier Pokemon from inflicting Vigoroth with status, and Taunt lets Vigoroth prevent them from using their recovery moves. Return is Vigoroth's main STAB move because of its high Base Power and reliability. Body Slam can be used over Return; however, the ability to paralyze foes is minimally important over the higher Base Power and PP of Return.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment, 240 Special Defense EVs, and an Eviolite give Vigoroth decent enough bulk to let it check the metagame's most notorious sleep inducers, Vivillon and Lilligant, and in general give Vigoroth more help against special attackers. It also lets Vigoroth set up Substitute against weaker special moves like Lanturn's and Gastrodon's Scald and Weezing's Sludge Bomb. 16 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature let Vigoroth outspeed threats like Skuntank and Abomasnow, letting Vigoroth use Bulk Up or Slack Off before they can attack it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try not to send out Vigoroth until all of the opposing Ghost-types are removed, as Vigoroth has no way of hitting them and therefore has to switch out. Feel free to stay in against Rhydon and Regirock, because as long as the former isn't running Swords Dance and the latter isn't running Counter, Vigoroth can just set up and KO them; however, try to scout their moveset first. If you opt to use Facade, use it to inflict heavy damage on status users such as Weezing and Charizard that may try to burn Vigoroth, and to break through defensive checks such as Quagsire. Be cautious of faster Taunt users like Pyroar and Archeops, as they can easily hinder Vigoroth's usability; try to get rid of them before sending Vigoroth out. Vigoroth is best suited to being a late game wincon once most of its checks are KOed, so it can easily set up and sweep; in the early game, Vigoroth can pivot into weak attackers and force them out with the threat of setup. Try to avoid Knock Off, because Vigoroth becomes incredibly frail when it loses its Eviolite.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit trappers like Skuntank and Liepard are useful for getting rid of Ghost-types like Mismagius, which Vigoroth has no way of hitting, in order to let it sweep. Pokemon that can check Fighting-types, such as Weezing, Garbodor, and Vileplume, can help Vigoroth because Fighting-types threaten unboosted Vigoroth the most. Vigoroth relies on Eviolite heavily for its bulk, so having a Knock Off absorber like Mega Audino, Garbodor, or Vileplume is great. Mega Audino is especially helpful because its role as a cleric is highly useful for healing Vigoroth, especially if it chooses to run Facade and thus lets itself get statused. Healing Wish users are very useful for Vigoroth, as the health that Healing Wish gives Vigoroth back gives it a second chance to sweep without a status ailment. Vigoroth can beat some Rhydon and Regirock variants, but having a teammate that can easily KO them and other Rock-types, such as Ludicolo, Hariyama, and Mantine, is highly appreciated for ensured removal.</p>"

  "Ninjask": {
    "overview": "<p>Ninjask is the fastest Pokemon in the NU metagame and can use its Speed to outspeed almost everything. Coupled with Infiltrator and a STAB U-turn it becomes a very competent revenge killer and pivot that can revenge kill boosted threats even without a Choice Scarf. However, thanks to non-existent defenses, a barren movepool, and a huge Stealth Rock weakness, Ninjask rarely gets to switch in against threats and requires a decent amount of support to function at its best. It also competes with Choice Scarf Scyther for a slot on a team; Ninjask has a significantly stronger U-turn and outspeeds most of the same threats, but it lacks Technician to boost its low-powered moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>It is possible to use Toxic to wear down some of Ninjask's more common switch-ins, whereas Sleep Talk could be used if you want to use Ninjask to absorb sleep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock is Ninjask's biggest fear, as its opportunities to switch in are limited at best with Stealth Rock up and it is worn down incredibly fast, making it far less useful during the battle.</p> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Pokemon using Rocky Helmet such as Garbodor, Weezing, and Xatu can easily wear Ninjask down simply by switching in as it U-turns out, weakening its Final Gambit and discouraging Ninjask from using U-turn before the Rocky Helmet is removed.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon That Resist Bug-type Moves</strong>: Anything with passable defenses and a typing that resists Bug-types, excluding Fighting- and Ghost-types, can generally come in on anything Ninjask tries to attack with, such as Mega Audino, Weezing, and Klinklang. However, Ninjask can still U-turn out.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: The only priority moves that Ninjask resists are Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, so priority users without these moves such as Kangaskhan, Piloswine, and Samurott can deal large amounts of damage.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with high Defense such as Regirock, Garbodor, Weezing, and Rhydon take very little damage from any of Ninjask's attacks, and they each have some way to take advantage of a Choice-locked Ninjask; by using Stealth Rock, Spikes, or other status moves, for example.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Revenge Killer + Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn is used to grab momentum or keep the momentum on your side. Final Gambit helps stop sweepers, but with Ninjask's HP, it doesn't net many OHKOs. Aerial Ace is the only physical Flying-type STAB move that Ninjask has access to; but it is weak, so it only hits hard when it's super effective. X-Scissor is Ninjask's strongest attack, which makes it the best option for late-game cleaning. Night Slash is used to hit Ghost-types, but it is not incredibly useful otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs are used to hit as hard and be as fast as possible. With a Jolly nature, Ninjask outspeeds Pokemon with base 90 Speed at +1 such as Lilligant. A spread of 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe and an Adamant nature can be used for the extra power while still being able to outspeed Pokemon with base 80 Speed at +1 with a neutral nature and slightly stronger Final Gambit, but the decrease in Speed is easily noticeable. Infiltrator ignores Reflect and can hit through Substitute, making it the most useful ability because Ninjask won't stay in a lot, and Choice Band boosts Ninjask's Attack to maximize its damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Keep Stealth Rock away from Ninjask's side of the field, as Ninjask can't switch in as long as Stealth Rock is up without weakening its Final Gambit. Ninjask should mainly use U-turn to build momentum when it is in against Pokemon such as Malamar that Ninjask forces out. Rocky Helmet can quickly wear down Ninjask, so have a partner that can lure in the Rocky Helmet user and remove it with Knock Off. Final Gambit is best used on foes that Ninjask can't knock out with any of its other moves and when it is too risky to U-turn out. However, don't use Final Gambit on Pokemon such as Hariyama or anything else with a large HP stat unless they're severely weakened, as it doesn't do much damage to them. Avoid switching Ninjask in on attacks, as even 4x resisted moves such as Close Combat still do a lot of damage. Similarly, most Pokemon that commonly carry priority moves are able to hit Ninjask for either neutral or super effective damage, so they can pose a threat to Ninjask even if they don't outspeed it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Xatu is a great partner for Ninjask, as it prevents Stealth Rock while Ninjask can deal with the Dark-types that threaten Xatu. However, be careful, as they do share several weaknesses. If you aren't using Xatu, it is mandatory to have Rapid Spin or Defog support from Pokemon such as Claydol and Prinplup if you want Ninjask to switch in more than twice and keep its Final Gambit as strong as possible. Water-types, such as Poliwrath and Samurott, that benefit from Ninjask being able to remove the Grass-types that threaten them are also good partners. Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Hariyama can take out the Steel-types that Ninjask can't touch and threaten most Stealth Rock setters with their super effective STAB moves; Hitmonchan in particular can provide Rapid Spin support for Ninjask. The aforementioned Fighting-types enjoy the pressure Ninjask puts on Psychic-types in return.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Shedinja has an amazing ability in Wonder Guard that leaves it immune to anything it isn't weak to, giving it loads of switch-in opportunities against some very threatening Pokemon such as Samurott, Kangaskhan, Klinklang, and Ludicolo. It also has a decent Attack stat backed by STAB priority in Shadow Sneak to somewhat make up for its lack of Speed. Thanks to Wonder Guard, Shedinja forces a lot of switches because many foes don't carry coverage moves to hit it with, rendering them helpless. Unfortunately, not only does Shedinja have a number of common weaknesses and a pathetic 1 HP that can't even be invested in, but it is also weak to all entry hazards, meaning that it cannot even switch in if they're on the field. Moreover, Shedinja is extremely vulnerable to being pursuit trapped by Pokemon like Skuntank and Liepard, making it a liability in certain matchups. Therefore, in order for Shedinja to be effective, it needs support in the form of Pokemon that resist its weaknesses, status absorbers, and hazard control in some from, whether that be Magic Bounce, Rapid Spin, Defog, or any combination of the three.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sucker Punch can be used over Shadow Sneak to hit a little bit harder, but it is far less reliable and doesn't have that much extra power. Air Balloon can be used over Focus Sash because it makes Shedinja immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes and puts less pressure on your hazard control, but it is not as reliable and the extra hit Shedinja can take thanks to Focus Sash is much more useful in most cases.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Shedinja is hit by all entry hazards and can't switch into any of them other than Sticky Web; setting them up is a very easy way to prevent Shedinja from doing anything at all. In particular, Rhydon is one entry hazard setter that also carries Rock Blast, which bypasses Shedinja's Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Status Moves</strong>: Due to Shedinja's unique HP stat, Toxic and Will-O-Wisp are both effective ways to take it out if it doesn't carry a Lum Berry.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank, Liepard, and Scyther can easily trap Shedinja and either break its Focus Sash on the switch or OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Ferroseed</strong>: Ferroseed can switch in and set up Spikes without fearing anything but a burn while also threatening Shedinja with Iron Barbs and Leech Seed. Ferroseed can also set up Stealth Rock or Spikes to stop Shedinja from switching in.</p> <p><strong>Pyroar</strong>: With an immunity to Will-O-Wisp and Shadow Sneak and a resistance to X-Scissor, Pyroar is able to switch in on Shedinja with very little fear and proceed to use a super effective STAB Fire-type move, either KOing Shedinja or hitting a teammate for substantial damage. However, Pyroar will take quite a bit of damage switching in if both Stealth Rock and Spikes are up.</p> <p><strong>Coverage Moves</strong>: Anything with a super effective move such as Knock Off, Hidden Power Rock, and Hidden Power Fire is a decent check to Shedinja. Pokemon that Shedinja could otherwise deal with, such as Hariyama, Lilligant, and Audino, have a way past it with their coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Sandstorm, Hail, and Leech Seed all deal damage to Shedinja and prevent it from even being able to switch in. Pokemon that carry Rocky Helmet such as Garbodor and Weezing all stop Shedinja from attacking; however, Shedinja can still spread burns.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Shedinja to take advantage of Pokemon that it can wall such as Samurott and Ludicolo by boosting its Attack. Will-O-Wisp is used to cripple physical attackers on the switch and to soften their attacks for the rest of the team. X-Scissor is the reliable Bug-type STAB move of choice, as it hits decently hard when Shedinja can spare turns attacking. Shedinja can use Shadow Sneak to revenge kill some weaker foes and works well in combination with Swords Dance. Alternatively, Protect allows further scouting for moves that might hit Shedinja, increasing its longevity.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>As Shedinja's defenses aren't possible to increase, all of the EVs are put into Attack and Speed. Focus Sash allows Shedinja to take a second hit if needed, while Lum Berry lets Shedinja be a one-time status absorber. A Lonely Nature is used alongside minimized Defense and Special Defense stats to slightly improve the matchup against Ditto at no cost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It's important to play conservatively against Pokemon such as Lilligant, Mesprit or Vileplume that might have a move that hits Shedinja. If possible, scout which coverage moves the foe is running. However, Lilligant and Mesprit don't like switching in on Shedinja, which can be used to your advantage. Use Will-O-Wisp on a predicted switch if the foe could be hindered by a burn. Always look out for Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Clefairy that might carry Toxic or Knock Off as a filler move. Strive to keep Shedinja's Focus Sash intact for as long as possible, but if it can grab an important KO or burn a dangerous threat, it can be worth it to waste its Focus Sash to do so. Using X-Scissor on a predicted switch is a decent option if Shedinja can OHKO or 2HKO the switch-in with a combination of it and Shadow Sneak. However, misjudging this means that your team will have to take more damage, so it's not always the best option.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Thanks to its ability, Magic Bounce, Xatu makes for a perfect partner, as it easily keeps entry hazards off the field and can switch into status with ease. Entry hazards can also be kept off the field with Rapid Spin or Defog support from Pokemon such as Sandslash, Cryogonal, Pelipper, and Mantine. Other good partners are Rock- and Ground-types, such as Rhydon and Regirock, as their typing gives them many resistances to the attacks Shedinja fears, and they can also set up Stealth Rock. In return, Shedinja can take the Grass- and Water-type moves aimed at them. Water-types also pair up nicely with Shedinja, as they resist Fire-type moves for it while Shedinja can cover both of their weaknesses. Prinplup can also set up Stealth Rock for the team, while Pelipper can remove the entry hazards which Shedinja can't live with. Dark-types, such as Liepard and Skuntank, also make for decent partners, as they can Pursuit trap and deal with Ghost-types, as well as take some Dark-type moves aimed at Shedinja. Status absorbers such as Guts Hariyama are also helpful to take Toxic or Will-O-Wisp for Shedinja.</p>"

  "Hariyama": {
    "overview": "<p>Thick Fat, mono-Fighting typing, and a huge HP stat make Hariyama one of the best checks to Fire-, Ice-, and Dark-types, such as Magmortar, Abomasnow, and Shiftry, in the tier. In addition, Assault Vest makes Hariyama an excellent special tank that can easily fit onto most teams. It's no sitting duck, either; its great Attack stat, STAB Close Combat, and Knock Off make Hariyama decently offensively threatening. However, due to its lack of a boosting item, Hariyama struggles to do much to most Fighting-type checks outside of getting rid of their item with Knock Off. It's also vulnerable to the common Flying- and Psychic-types. Its bulk is undermined by its lack of any form of recovery, which makes it very easy to wear down. Hariyama's unfortunate Speed leaves it outsped by almost all offensive Pokemon and a significant number of defensive ones.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Life Orb set utilizing Sheer Force lures checks such as Vileplume and Pelipper and can remove them with Ice Punch and Thunder Punch, respectively. A set consisting of Belly Drum, Close Combat, Knock Off, and Bullet Punch is very niche and lacks utility, but it's a fun option nonetheless. Holding Leftovers over Assault Vest allows Hariyama to run Toxic to cripple checks such as Mantine and Pelipper, but the drop in special bulk is very noticeable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Vileplume and Weezing have nothing to fear from Hariyama and can KO it back eventually, and both Weezing and Garbodor use Hariyama as (Toxic) Spikes fodder. Garbodor is 2HKOed by the occasional Earthquake, though.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Scyther, Rotom-S, and Pelipper aren't weak to Hariyama's common coverage moves and KO it back with their super effective STAB moves. However, none of them like Knock Off, especially Scyther because it loses its Eviolite, and Rotom-S doesn't have reliable recovery. In addition, while requiring prediction, Stone Edge can catch them by surprise.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Musharna, Xatu, and Mesprit are good checks or counters to Hariyama, and they often run Colbur Berry to take less damage from Knock Off. However, Xatu must wary of its Choice Band set, as it OHKOes with Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Very physically bulky Pokemon such as Mega Audino, Quagsire, and Gourgeist-XL serve as effective checks or counters to Hariyama due to its lack of a boosting item. Mega Audino and Quagsire can use Hariyama as setup fodder for Calm Mind and Curse respectively, while Gourgeist-XL can cripple Hariyama with Will-O-Wisp and chip away at it with Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Faster Physical Attackers</strong>: Due to its low Speed and mediocre physical bulk, faster physical attackers such as Tauros and Kangaskhan can revenge kill Hariyama fairly easily.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is a powerful STAB move, at least 2HKOing most offensive threats that don't resist it. Knock Off removes items, crippling most switch-ins; hits Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Mesprit and Rotom super effectively; and hits Poison- and Flying-types such as Weezing and Mantine neutrally. Bullet Punch provides useful priority to chip away at faster Pokemon, such as Shiftry, Archeops, and Lilligant. Fake Out pairs very well with Bullet Punch, letting Hariyama revenge kill physically frail Pokemon such as Jynx and Vivillon, the latter if it has been weakened. Earthquake hits Garbodor, preventing Hariyama from being setup fodder, and has the nice bonus of hitting Fire-types without defense drops. Stone Edge hits Flying-types such as Xatu, Mantine, Pelipper, and especially Scyther.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature give Hariyama good power, and maximum Special Defense and Assault Vest make it very specially bulky. Thick Fat gives Hariyama its niche as one of the best Fire- and Ice-type checks. Guts is an alternative, as it allows Hariyama to beat Pokemon such as Rotom, Weezing, and Mismagius that rely on burns to cripple it, but Thick Fat is better, as the Fire- and Ice-type resistances are key parts of Hariyama's niche.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Come in on the various threats Hariyama checks, namely Fire- and Ice-types such as Magmortar and Aurorus. Hariyama can also come in on special attackers that can't hit it super effectively, such as Shiftry and Samurott, though it can easily be worn down after switching in a few times, so don't rely on Hariyama as the sole answer to them. Hariyama generally can't do too much to sturdy Fighting checks, so use Knock Off as they switch in to at least get rid of their items. The combination of Fake Out and Bullet Punch can be used to revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Jynx, Vivillon, and Lilligant, the latter two only when they're weakened to around 50% HP. When running Earthquake or Stone Edge, try to hit Garbodor or Flying-types on the switch, respectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hariyama fits easily on almost any team because of its unique resistances, decent offensive presence, and the fact that it doesn't need much support. Balance staples such as Vileplume and Xatu really appreciate Hariyama's Fire and Ice resistances. In addition, Water-types such as Mantine, Pelipper, and Ludicolo appreciate Hariyama's resistance to Freeze-Dry. Physical sponges such as Rhydon and Weezing pair very well with Hariyama, as they take on the physical attackers it can't; Steelix in particular handles Flying- and Psychic-types while Hariyama checks Fire-types and most special attackers in general. Xatu, Claydol, and Mantine can remove (Toxic) Spikes or, in the case of Xatu, bounce them back thanks to Magic Bounce, which is fairly important for Hariyama, as not only is it worn down quickly by entry hazards due to its lack of recovery, it's also hard checked by Garbodor and Weezing, the two most common (Toxic) Spikes setters. Fast offensive Pokemon such as Floatzel and Swellow make up for Hariyama's lackluster Speed.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Hariyama's powerful STAB move, able to cause massive damage to opposing teams that lack a Pokemon resistant or immune to it. However, Close Combat lowers Hariyama's defenses, which makes it easier to revenge kill. Knock Off has great coverage with Close Combat, able to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Mesprit, Mismagius, and Gourgeist-XL, which are the most common switch-ins for Fighting-type attacks after Poison-types. It also removes the foe's item, which is very useful to wear teams down in the long run. Stone Edge is needed to hit bulky Flying-types such as Pelipper, Scyther, Charizard, and Mantine, which can switch into any of Hariyama's other attacks. Bullet Punch gives Hariyama a priority move and the ability to deal a massive damage to or KO frail attackers weak to it, such as Archeops and Jynx. It can be really useful late-game as well to pick off weakened Pokemon. Earthquake offers super effective coverage against Poison-types such as Garbodor and Skuntank, avoiding the Aftermath damage from the latter as well. It also gives Hariyama a way to hit Rock- and Steel-types, such as Steelix and Rhydon, super effectively without lowering its defenses and using up Close Combat PP. Heavy Slam could be an option to deal massive damage to Mega Audino, as well as deal neutral damage to Poison-types such as Vileplume and Weezing, with Hariyama having a nice chance to 2HKO them after prior damage. Keep in mind that Close Combat still has a chance to 2HKO Mega Audino. Hariyama can run other coverage moves such as Ice Punch, which can be used to 2HKO defensive Vileplume while providing solid neutral coverage and hitting Flying-types super effectively. Facade is another choice for breaking down typical Fighting-type counters, such as Weezing and Vileplume, which commonly rely on status to neuter Fighting-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in Attack combined with an Adamant nature allows Hariyama to hit as hard as possible and 2HKO every Pokemon in the tier with Close Combat that doesn't resist or is immune to it after Stealth Rock, which makes it a hard move to switch into. 108 EVs in Defense help Hariyama out in taking hits from the likes of Kangaskhan, Tauros, and Shiftry, most notably guaranteeing that it survives Kangaskhan's Fake Out + Double Edge from full health as well as letting it survive Tauros's Zen Headbutt after two switches into Stealth Rock. The Speed investment is to outpace base 54 Speed Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL and Vileplume, and the remaining EVs are put into Special Defense to avoid the OHKO from Choice Specs Aurorus's Hyper Voice after Stealth Rock. An alternative EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe with an Adamant nature can be considered to allow Hariyama to outpace positive-natured base 40 Speed Pokemon such as Rhydon, Pelipper, Mantine, and Lanturn. It also lets Hariyama Speed tie with other offensive base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Aggron and Mega Audino. Guts is the ability of choice to take full advantage of status effects, which is one of the usual ways to deal with Fighting-types. It's also the main niche Hariyama has over other Choice Band Fighting-types such as Primeape. With a Guts boost, Hariyama is able to 2HKO Vileplume and Weezing with a resisted Close Combat and has a nice chance to OHKO defensive Mesprit with Knock Off. With this ability, it can also surprise defensive Ghost-types such as Rotom, Mismagius, and Gourgeist-XL. Thick Fat can still be useful if your team needs the extra insurance against Fire- and Ice-types, as Hariyama is still pretty bulky. Choice Band is the item of choice to pump up Hariyama's already high Attack stat so it can hit as hard as possible immediately and have a nice chance to OHKO bulky Pokemon such as Malamar, Lanturn and Rhydon with Close Combat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hariyama should be used as wallbreaker and must be brought in safely against bulkier Pokemon such as Lanturn or predicted Rock- or Dark-type moves such as Rhydon's Stone Edge and Skuntank's Dark Pulse. This way, it can use Choice Band-boosted moves to threaten the opposing team. Thanks to Guts, Hariyama can switch in on bulky Water-types looking to score burns with Scald, such as Lanturn, without much worry, but this means it'll be worn down more quickly. It can also function as a status absorber and switch in on a predicted status-inflicting move. Try to avoid getting Hariyama hit by Knock Off and losing its Choice Band so that it won't lose wallbreaking capabilities. You have to predict correctly in order to not waste a turn or take unnecessary residual damage. Also, make sure to conserve Close Combat's PP. Hariyama possesses great bulk, but it cannot take special attacks very well. Instead, try to bring it in for free against passive Pokemon such as Lanturn or Pokemon that Hariyama can threaten out such as Rhydon and Miltank. Don't predict recklessly, as this could cost you offensive momentum; for example, if you have a check to Flying-types, don't try to catch them on the switch, as your opponent could have another initial switch-in, so scout for it first. Also be careful of setup sweepers that can take advantage of the move you lock Hariyama, such as Scyther being able to set up when it's locked into Earthquake.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Mesprit and Garbodor can give Hariyama an easier time breaking down the opposition. Mesprit has the best synergy possible with Hariyama, as it can get rid of Poison-types and switch in on Psychic-type attacks that threaten Hariyama. Garbodor can chip away damage at strong physical attackers that force out Hariyama thanks to Rocky Helmet and Aftermath. A way to compensate for Hariyama's low base Speed is with Thunder Wave support. Some Pokemon that help with this are Xatu, Mesprit, and Liepard. Another strong physical attacker, such as Primeape, Kangaskhan, or Tauros, can weaken opposing physical walls such as Weezing and Vileplume to the point that Hariyama can easily them pick off, or vice versa. Tauros is also a really good partner, as it can run Pursuit to trap a Choice Scarf Rotom locked into Shadow Ball or just trap and weaken Psychic- and Ghost-types in general. Skuntank and Liepard are solid partners, as they have access to Pursuit, are immune to Psychic-type moves, and can trap Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Mesprit, Rotom, and Xatu, making it easier for Hariyama to spam Choice Band-boosted Close Combat. Bulky Pokemon that can shrug off hits such as Rhydon, Steelix, and Mega Audino are good teammates, as, despite Hariyama's decent bulk, it cannot take multiple hits and can worn be down very quickly. Rhydon and Steelix are great teammates because they have access to Stealth Rock, which helps Hariyama get crucial KOs; for example, Stone Edge is guaranteed OHKO on Pelipper after Stealth Rock damage. Also, both are great switch-ins to Flying-types that threaten Hariyama.</p>"

  "Mawile": {
    "overview": "<p>Mawile is a unique Pokemon in NU, as it has a great ability in Sheer Force boosting the power of both its STAB moves and its coverage moves. Mawile is a great wallbreaker, able to lure in and break down walls for other teammates to sweep, and it can be a pain for defensive teams to handle because of its inability to be worn down by Life Orb recoil and its powerful STAB moves and coverage allowing it to easily break past defensive cores. Mawile can also make use of its typing and Intimidate to be an effective wall versus the likes of Shiftry, Liepard, and Skuntank. However, Mawile is slow and frail without any investment in bulk, meaning its offensive set has to rely on Sucker Punch against faster teams, and its poor bulk means that even resisted hits can do a significant amount of damage, preventing Mawile from utilizing its resistances, most of which are of specially based attacking types. It also faces competition from other wallbreakers such as Samurott and Magmortar, which can provide more defensive utility to a team with their better Speed, bulk or defensive typings. Defensively, it also faces competition with Steelix as it has much better defensive stats, letting it more effectively utilize its set of resistances.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance is an option on the offensive set over Iron Head, as a +2 Mawile is a very dangerous wallbreaker and can be dangerous to offensive teams as well thanks to Swords Dance boosting Sucker Punch's power. Stealth Rock is an option on the offensive set as well thanks to Mawile's ability to force switches, but it doesn't have room for the move and Mawile is usually better used wallbreaking than setting up. Grass Knot can also be used to OHKO Rhydon and Gastrodon, but it has little use outside of that.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types resist Mawile's STAB moves and can usually take a Sucker Punch and OHKO Mawile with their STAB attacks. Charizard can even predict a Sucker Punch and Roost off the damage. Pyroar and Charizard can also circumvent Sucker Punch by using Will-O-Wisp and crippling Mawile. Combusken doesn't resist Play Rough, but it does resist Sucker Punch, making it an easy revenge killer to Mawile.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Mawile has a low base 50 Speed, meaning almost all offensive Pokemon will outspeed and potentially KO it. Sucker Punch mitigates this problem somewhat, but it can only KO weakened Pokemon, leaving Mawile with a bad matchup against faster teams. Powerful special attackers and Pokemon that can resist or shrug off Sucker Punch or can circumvent it with status have an easier time revenge killing Mawile as well. Examples of these revenge killers include Rotom, Hitmonchan, and Primeape. Even offensive Pokemon like Magmortar and Samurott can outspeed Mawile and revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types resist both of Mawile's STAB moves, only fearing Fire Blast on the switch, and can retaliate with their STAB moves or coverage, making them reliable Mawile checks. Examples of these Steel-types include Steelix, Klinklang, and Ferroseed.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types resist Play Rough and can usually take an Iron Head and retaliate. Garbodor can whittle Mawile down with Rocky Helmet, Weezing can threaten with its Will-O-Wisp or Flamethrower, and Vileplume can cripple Mawile with Effect Spore and hurt Mawile badly with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types, like Golurk and Rhydon, can take a hit from Mawile and OHKO it with Earthquake or Earth Power. Rhydon and Piloswine run the risk of being 2HKOed by Iron Head, however. Steelix also deserves a mention, as it tanks every one of Mawile's STAB moves and forces it to run Fire Blast. However, none of these Ground-types want to switch into Mawile due to its powerful STAB moves and coverage, so they are shaky checks at best.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Play Rough is quite powerful after the boost from Sheer Force and Life Orb, having good neutral coverage in general and forcing out Pokemon like Hariyama and Liepard. Iron Head provides important coverage against Mega Audino and hits Rock-types such as Rhydon and Regirock. It also hits Poison-types like Garbodor fairly hard. Fire Blast is needed to 2HKO Steelix, which would otherwise counter Mawile entirely, and also hits Steel-types like Ferroseed and Klinklang as well as Vileplume and Gourgeist-XL hard. Sucker Punch is Mawile's best move against offensive teams, as it can pick off weakened threats like Swellow and Magmortar with its priority.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed maximizes Mawile's offensive potential. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack with a Naughty nature to keep Fire Blast decently powerful. Sheer Force is chosen over Intimidate to negate Life Orb recoil on moves with a secondary effect, which is all of Mawile's moves except Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mawile should be used as a wallbreaker, breaking down defensive Pokemon with its coverage moves. Play Rough should be spammed unless the opponent has a Pokemon that resists it. Use Mawile's coverage moves in Iron Head and Fire Blast if the opponent has the appropriate target to these moves. Use Sucker Punch to pick off weakened threats, but use it carefully if the opponent has a Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp like Rotom. Mawile's poor special bulk means it is 2HKOed by even resisted special hits like Abomasnow's Blizzard, but its excellent defensive typing lets it be a one-time check to attackers like Swellow and offensive Mesprit. Mawile should still not switch into these Pokemon, as it is easily 2HKOed by their attacks. Try to get Mawile in by VoltTurn or after one of your Pokemon has fainted. Try to scout special attackers like Vileplume to see if they have a Hidden Power type that can hit Mawile hard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can deal with Fire-types, such as Samurott, Floatzel, and Kabutops, make for good partners to Mawile. In addition, Mawile threatens out Hariyama, one of Floatzel's most common checks. Fast Pokemon that have a good matchup against offensive teams, such as Archeops and Tauros, make for good partners as well due to Mawile's focus as a wallbreaker, letting it break down their bulkier checks or counters, such as Mega Audino. Sweepers such as Swords Dance Scyther and Vivillon appreciate Mawile's luring in and breaking down of some of their checks and counters, such as Steelix and Rhydon. Pokemon that have a problem with bulky Pokemon and walls in general, such as Haunter and Pyroar, appreciate Mawile's wallbreaking. Bulky Pokemon that can take the hits that Mawile can't take, mainly strong special hits like Blizzards and Fire Blasts, such as Mega Audino and Hariyama, are good partners as well. Pokemon that can bring in Mawile safely with Volt Switch or U-turn, like Scyther and Rotom, make for good partners. Mawile synergizes well with the VoltTurners by weakening or KOing their checks. Other examples of good VoltTurn users are Primeape and Lanturn.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock inflicts damage on targets that switch in and is necessary to cripple threats such as Scyther and Charizard. Play Rough can help Mawile beat Dark-type Pokemon such as Liepard, Shiftry, Skuntank, and Liepard. Super Fang gives Mawile some offensive pressure, particularly letting it dent Steel-types such as Steelix, Ferroseed, and Klinklang. Pain Split provides Mawile with semi-reliable recovery and increases its longevity. Knock Off is a viable option to remove the foes items, such as Clefairy's Eviolite and Steelix's Leftovers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximizing HP and Defense is preferred, since Mawile's poor Special Defense makes it hard for it to tank special hits, even with a maximum HP and Special Defense spread. This spread lets Mawile take on physical Dark-type Pokemon. An Impish nature is used to boost up Mawile's Defense even more. Intimidate is the preferred ability, since it helps Mawile check physical Pokemon better. Rocky Helmet can be used over Leftovers to deal chip damage on foes that use contact moves, and it forms a good combination with Super Fang.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Feel free to switch Mawile into physical Dark-type Pokemon such as Liepard, and Skuntank. Mawile resists Normal-type attacks and can come into Tauros's Rock Climb once, but don't keep it in after it takes a hit because Tauros always runs Fire Blast, which 2HKOes Mawile. Do not switch Mawile into any special Normal-type Pokemon like Swellow or Pyroar, as it will get 2HKOed by the former's Boomburst and OHKOed by the latter's Fire Blast. Mawile also has a good matchup against Shiftry and Hitmonchan, both of which are common offensive anti-entry hazard Pokemon. Super Fang can be risky if the opponent has a weakened Pokemon on their team, as it can basically switch in for free; this makes Super Fang better in the early-game, when Mawile is used best anyway. Mawile is a great switch-in to Knock Off and its users in particular, especially if it runs Rocky Helmet. Pain Split should be used once Mawile's HP is low to maintain longevity and chip away at the foes HP. One of Mawile's main advantages over other pivots is its defensive typing coupled with Intimidate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mawile appreciates Ground-type checks such as Mesprit, Gastrodon, and Gourgeist-XL, as well as Fire-type checks such as Thick Fat Hariyama, Miltank, Solrock, and Lanturn, since it's pretty weak to those types. Pokemon that like Dark-type Pokemon gone are important as well, so mainly Ghost-type Pokemon such as Haunter, Mismagius, Rotom, Trevenant, and Golurk, as well as some Psychic-type Pokemon such as Mesprit, Xatu, Musharna, and Jynx make for good partners. Mawile can beat physical Skuntank but still takes a lot from the special variant, so having something that checks it and most special sweepers such as Magmortar, Lanturn, Audino, or Hariyama is important. Mawile's niches that justify its use over Pokemon such as Steelix are mainly Super Fang and Intimidate, so use wallbreakers and setup sweepers that have difficulty switching in such as Archeops and Jynx. Eviolite users such as Scyther and Roselia also appreciate having a Knock Off switch-in.</p>"

  "Aggron": {
    "overview": "<p>Aggron's power is often overwhelming due to Head Smash and its high Attack stat, especially when using a Choice Band. This offensive presence is what allows it to threaten two of the bulkiest Pokemon in the tier, Musharna and Mega Audino, without losing any offensive merit versus other slow threats. The ability Rock Head allows Aggron to repeatedly use Head Smash against slower targets without suffering recoil damage, which allows it to flourish against slow teams, often picking up multiple KOs. However, Aggron has a weak matchup versus offense due to its low Speed and typing, leaving it weak to common Fighting- and Ground-type moves, which are commonly carried as extra coverage by Normal-type Pokemon. A low Special Defense stat also keeps Aggron from using its resistances. This is especially noticeable against Ice- and Normal-types, as they can muscle past Aggron or have appropriate coverage to hit it hard. Aggron also occupies the Rock- and Steel-type slot on a team while not effectively checking Normal- or Flying-types, stacking defensive weaknesses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aggron has plenty of alternative moves that allow it to hit more specific targets, but the given moveset provides the most coverage. Earthquake allows for free damage on Garbodor without triggering Rocky Helmet or Aftermath recoil, while Double-Edge does decent damage to Gastrodon, Poliwrath, and Torterra but is too weak to use regularly. Toxic can be used to cripple the previously mentioned checks, but using it on a Choice set is not recommended, as your opponent can play around it once Aggron is locked into it. A Substitute and Magnet Rise set can be effective in circumventing certain checks to the wallbreaking set and allowing Aggron to avoid being burned. Aggron gets Stealth Rock, so a lead set is possible, as you're able to force switches due to Aggron's offensive prowess while also not having to worry about Xatu switching in due to it being KOed by the potential Head Smash. Rock Polish allows Aggron to sweep late-game, as Aggron outspeeds everything except Ninjask when you give it a Jolly nature after a Speed boost. Aggron doesn't hit nearly as hard without Choice Band and it's also vulnerable to Fighting-type priority moves such as Hitmonchan's Mach Punch and Poliwrath's Vacuum Wave; however, Sucker Punch and Aqua Jet are much less threatening while Aggron is healthy. Sleep Talk is a viable move to run, as two very common threats in Vivillon and Jynx run sleep-inducing moves, although you have to be wary of Jynx possibly carrying Focus Blast.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Poliwrath and Gastrodon are as close to counters as it gets, taking reasonable damage from every move Aggron has and being able to OHKO Aggron in return with their STAB priority Vacuum Wave and Earth Power, respectively. Offensive Water-types such as special Samurott and Floatzel can outspeed and OHKO Aggron before it can attack.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Torterra and Steelix are both able to effectively switch into Head Smash but have trouble with Ice Punch and Superpower, respectively. Their presence prevents Aggron from mindlessly spamming Head Smash, and upon switching, they threaten to OHKO Aggron with their STAB Earthquake or set up Stealth Rock as it switches out.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Combusken, Hitmonchan, and Primeape are all able to outspeed and OHKO Aggron with their 4x super effective STAB moves, while Hariyama is able to take a hit and threaten back with Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Aggron's weaknesses are easily exploited by both physical and special attackers. Pokemon that have access to moves that can take advantage of Aggron's 4x weakness to Ground and Fighting like Tauros, Jynx, and Archeops can easily outspeed and OHKO Aggron. Pyroar and Magmortar are also deadly because of their high Special Attack stats, and despite taking Fire-type attacks neutrally, Aggron's Special Defense is pitiful.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Head Smash 2HKOes Rock-resistant Pokemon such as Hariyama and Golurk. Only a couple of Pokemon can reliably switch into Head Smash, such as Gastrodon and defensive Poliwrath, but even they take a substantial amount of damage from it. Heavy Slam allows Aggron to easily beat Mega Audino and Rhydon, hitting both for super effective damage. Its use extends beyond that, though, as there might be situations where its power is enough and you can't risk missing Head Smash. Superpower in combination with an Adamant nature and Choice Band allows Aggron to 2HKO Steelix and Ferroseed, two prominent Head Smash responses. Superpower is the Fighting-type move of choice because Low Kick offers either equal or less damage depending on the target, but it does offer a more reliable 2HKO on Steelix and does not leave Aggron at -2 Attack and Defense after the KO. Ice Punch is primarily used for Torterra, which is able to switch into Head Smash with ease and threaten to KO with Earthquake, though Ice Punch requires Stealth Rock to be set up to OHKO defensive Torterra sets.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rock Head allows Aggron to use Head Smash without the worry of recoil, while maximum Attack and Speed EVs, a Choice Band, and an Adamant nature allow Aggron to be as threatening as possible. A Jolly nature can be considered to ensure that Aggron outspeeds neutral-natured Aurorus, offensive Mega Audino, and other Adamant Aggron, but the power from an Adamant nature is often more sought after. Stone Plate is an option over Choice Band to bait Head Smash switch-ins with a surprise follow-up coverage move, but the damage drop is noticeable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aggron has trouble switching into offensive threats and dealing with fast teams in general due to its weaknesses to common coverage moves. In terms of offensive Pokemon Aggron can switch into, Scyther and Swellow present opportunities, as Scyther's STAB moves do pitiful damage, and Swellow can only hurt Aggron with Heat Wave. Look towards using Head Smash the most against offensive teams, as their Pokemon are frail for the most part and won't be able to take the hit. Despite Aggron's bad matchup versus fast teams, Aggron has little trouble with slower ones, being able to come in on passive Pokemon such as Miltank and Musharna. Being wary of Rock-resistant Pokemon is important, as using Head Smash and being forced out will sap momentum, so be ready to opt for your coverage moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Late-game cleaners and physical Water-types such as Kabutops, Samurott, and Barbaracle especially appreciate having bulky walls and their common checks being broken by Aggron, while faster Pokemon can pick up the slack where Aggron lacks. Reliable pivots such as Lanturn, defensive Xatu, and Rotom greatly aid Aggron in getting into the battle safely, and all of the aforementioned Pokemon are good switch-ins to Pokemon that use the Fighting- and Ground-type moves that easily beat Aggron. Since Aggron is so slow, Sticky Web from Smeargle or Thunder Wave from Mesprit or Lanturn can easily turn faster offensive threats into sitting targets for Head Smash. Entry hazard support is key, as entry hazards can dissuade Aggron's usual switch-ins from repeatedly taking hits. Stealth Rock secures the 2HKO on defensive Poliwrath, while Spikes ensures Gastrodon can be 2HKOed. Defensive Mesprit is a particularly good choice due to its resistance and immunity to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks respectively.</p>"

  "Manectric": {
    "overview": "<p>Manectric has a solid Speed tier that lets it outspeed tons of offensive threats such as Jynx, Rotom, and Charizard. Its access to Overheat and Flamethrower combined with its high Special Attack stat allows it to bypass a few Ground-types and Steel-types such as Torterra, Ferroseed, and Steelix, which would check it otherwise. It is also a great offensive Pokemon with access to Volt Switch, which lets it whittle down Pokemon at a fast pace. Manectric's Electric immunity via Lightning Rod further lets it switch in for free occasionally and pressure the opponent's team late-game if it can grab a boost. Unfortunately, Manectric faces competition from other Electric-types such as Rotom, which is a much better pivot due to Rotom's useful set of resistances, and Electivire, which boasts more offensive versatility. It also struggles to get OHKOs on Pokemon like Camerupt, Gastrodon, and Piloswine, which are immune to its STAB move, without quite a bit of chip damage. Lastly, Manectric is very susceptible to priority users and faster Pokemon such as Sucker Punch Shiftry, Tauros, and Swellow due to its frailness.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set with Switcheroo over either Overheat or Hidden Power Grass can be used to cripple switch-ins like Lanturn and Camerupt. Choice Scarf can turn Manectric into a revenge killer capable of beating Flying-types that normally outspeed it, but without the power of Life Orb Manectric's attacks are less than optimal. Hidden Power Water can be used to damage Camerupt while still retaining coverage on Rhydon, but it loses out on many important targets such as Gastrodon and Lanturn. Camerupt also isn't extremely common, making Hidden Power Water useless in most situations.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Lanturn</strong>: Lanturn takes little to nothing from Manectric's Overheat and is immune to and recovers HP from Manectric's STAB moves. Hidden Power Grass, while super effective, doesn't do much damage to Assault Vest variants and often requires prediction to hit Lanturn on the switch. Lanturn can also reliably 2HKO Manectric with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Camerupt</strong>: Camerupt's unique typing lets it act as a surefire counter to Manectric, as the best Manectric can do to it is hit it with Hidden Power Grass. Camerupt can threaten to KO Manectric with its STAB Ground-type attacks or use the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Manectric's fragility it will often get OHKOed by powerful STAB attacks from Pokemon like Pyroar, Tauros, and Archeops as well as some Choice Scarf Pokemon. It also dislikes having to take strong priority moves like Sucker Punch and Aqua Jet, which can be found on a plethora of Pokemon like Shiftry, Kangaskhan, and Samurott.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Piloswine, Golurk, and Claydol can block Manectric's STAB moves, take minimal damage from Overheat in most situations, and are capable of OHKOing Manectric with ease. Rhydon can even use Manectric as setup bait with Rock Polish or Swords Dance. However, they do have to be wary of taking a Hidden Power Grass or in Steelix's case an Overheat or Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon like Mega Audino, Assault Vest Hariyama, and Sliggoo that don't take super effective damage from Manectric's attacks can check Manectric, since it doesn't have the power to break through them. They can also OHKO Manectric in Hariyama's case or use it as setup fodder in the case of the other two. Unlike against Ground-types and Lanturn, though, Manectric can get chip damage on them with repeated Volt Switches.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt makes good use of Manectric's high Special Attack, and Volt Switch is able to grab momentum. Overheat is a great coverage move to hit common switch-ins to Electric-types such as Vileplume, Steelix, and Ferroseed. The former two cannot survive an Overheat (unless Steelix still has Sturdy intact), which means Manectric has a big niche over Electivire, which fails to OHKO either of them with Flamethrower. Flamethrower can be used over Overheat to avoid becoming setup fodder for Lilligant or Rhydon, as Manectric can't do much to either of them when at -2 Special Attack, but two Overheats are still stronger than two Flamethrowers, which makes it a better pick in most situations. Flamethrower also fails to OHKO Steelix and Vileplume after Stealth Rock damage. Hidden Power Grass is used to hit Rhydon, Gastrodon, and Lanturn, which can otherwise wall Manectric.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Lightning Rod gives Manectric an Electric immunity while also boosting its Special Attack, making it the superior ability over Static. Maximum Speed and a Timid nature make Manectric hit a very important Speed tier, outspeeding Charizard, Jynx, and Primeape, as well as allowing it to Speed tie with Mismagius and Scyther, which is something it couldn't achieve with a Modest nature. Life Orb is usually chosen over Choice Specs because Manectric heavily prefers being able to switch up moves, as it may otherwise lose you momentum, such as if your opponent switches in their Lanturn on a Volt Switch. Life Orb also overshadows Expert Belt, since Manectric needs the extra damage on neutral targets like Primeape and Kangaskhan.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Volt Switch a lot early-game to whittle down and cripple the opponent's team quickly. Thunderbolt should be used when the opponent is likely to sacrifice a Pokemon to an incoming Volt Switch to get the advantage on the next Pokemon coming out; this lets you keep up the offensive pressure. Try to predict the opponent switching in Electric-immune Pokemon such as Lanturn and Rhydon and hit them with Hidden Power Grass, or with Fire coverage in Steelix's case; this is very important because once they have been weakened or removed Manectric can use its STAB moves without any drawback. Manectric should attempt to come in on predicted Electric-type moves such as Rotom's and Lanturn's Volt Switch to acquire a Lightning Rod boost. However, you should only do this if Manectric can OHKO the foe at +1, as it is extremely frail and struggles to stomach neutral hits. Manectric should be played aggressively and utilize its coverage to break apart balance cores and maintain offensive pressure.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that are able to switch in on Electric-immune foes and pressure them such as Rotom and Vileplume are good partners for Manectric because they help wear down one another's checks and counters. Spikes and Toxic Spikes setters like Garbodor help wear down Manectric's checks such as Lanturn, and the residual damage allows it to KO Pokemon that could otherwise take a hit from it, such as Rhydon and specially defensive Vileplume. Stealth Rock setters also help to chip the opponent's team and break Steelix's Sturdy and any random Focus Sashes; these Pokemon are typically Flying-type checks as well, like Archeops and Rhydon, which help versus Swellow and opposing Archeops, Pokemon that Manectric struggles to beat one-on-one. Other VoltTurn users to accompany Manectric like Primeape and Scyther help to wear down the opposing team really quickly. Choice Band Primeape also helps to pressure a lot of Manectric's switch-ins like Rhydon and Gastrodon. Fire-types such as Charizard and Pyroar like having Water-types like Kabutops and Samurott dealt with, and they both work together to break down Gastrodon and Rhydon with Hidden Power Grass.</p>"

  "Roselia": {
    "overview": "<p>Access to Spikes and Toxic Spikes gives Roselia a unique niche as one of the better entry hazard stackers in the tier and separates it from other Grass-types, especially Vileplume. Roselia also boasts a nice typing with great resistances to Water-, Grass-, Electric-, and Fighting-type moves, and its special bulk is bolstered to great levels thanks to Eviolite. A good Special Attack stat gives it a great niche as an offensive Spiker and prevents it from being a sitting duck when using defensive sets. However, Roselia faces competition from Vileplume, which boasts far greater physical bulk and lacks Roselia's susceptibility to Knock Off, letting it function as an actual Fighting-type check and, in general, check a significantly larger portion of the metagame. Other Spikers in Garbodor, Ferroseed, and even Cacturne also give Roselia stiff competition for a teamslot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physically defensive EV spread is a viable option, but it's done better by Vileplume and still doesn't check Fighting-types effectively. Rest is an alternate form of recovery over Synthesis that immediately heals Roselia up to full health, but it requires Roselia to switch out. Hidden Power Fire or Ground is an option on the offensive set in order to hit Steel-types, with the former hitting Ferroseed super effectively and the latter targeting Garbodor and Skuntank, but Roselia typically doesn't have the room for it. Both Sleep Powder and Aromatherapy look like solid utility moves on the defensive set, but in reality, it's very hard for Roselia to give up a moveslot for them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Thanks to Magic Bounce, Xatu can bounce back Roselia's Spikes and threaten it with its Psychic-type STAB moves. However, Xatu can't switch into offensive sets.</p> <p><strong>Poison- and Steel-types</strong>: Steel- and Poison-types wall both of Roselia's STAB moves, a lot of them can 2HKO it, and the likes of Garbodor and Ferroseed can even set up entry hazards all over it. Skuntank and Klinklang are noteworthy counters, as the former can Taunt and Pursuit trap Roselia and even Defog away its entry hazards, and the latter can use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Fire-, Flying-, Psychic-, and Ice-types</strong>: Fire-, Flying-, Ice-, and Psychic-types threaten Roselia with their super effective STAB moves, and a lot of them are decent switch-ins because of their resistance to one of Roselia's STAB moves in the former two's cases or their usually decent special bulk in the latter two's cases. Magmortar is even immune to sleep, and Assault Vest sets can take any hit Roselia throws at them. Cryogonal also switches in with ease, and it gains back health with Recover and can Rapid Spin Roselia's entry hazards away.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off removes Roselia's Eviolite and therefore its ability to wall threats, so it is the main reason why Roselia is a poor check to Fighting-types even if it runs a physically defensive EV spread.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Physical attackers, such as Kangaskhan and Tauros, hit Roselia on its lower Defense stat and can 2HKO it with neutral hits or even powerful resisted hits.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes wears down grounded Pokemon very quickly, especially when paired with Stealth Rock. Giga Drain is a decent Grass-type STAB move that can recover HP. Synthesis provides Roselia with reliable recovery and lets it remain healthy and set up Spikes throughout the match. Sludge Bomb hits Flying-, Bug-, and Fire-types neutrally and opposing Grass-types neutrally or super effectively. Using Toxic Spikes over Spikes is an option, but it is generally inferior, as they are easily absorbed by the common Poison-types and Spikes are more universally useful.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread and a Calm nature maximize Roselia's special bulk, but 56 EVs can be moved to Speed to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Rhydon. Eviolite gives Roselia great special bulk and boosts its Defense stat to functional levels. Natural Cure makes Roselia a good status absorber, especially for Scald users such as Lanturn. An alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 SpD with a Calm nature hits a jump point in Special Defense and lets Roselia survive +2 Samurott's Megahorn after Stealth Rock most of the time.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch in on the special Water-, Grass-, and Electric-types, such as Floatzel, Lilligant, and Rotom, that Roselia checks. Pokemon like Weezing, Vileplume, and Mega Audino also give Roselia free opportunities to switch in, and while it can't beat them one-on-one, Roselia can lay Spikes against them. In general, use most of Roselia's free turns to set up Spikes, occasionally attacking when wearing down switch-ins would be more useful; specifically, if the opponent has Xatu, it's best to go for Sludge Bomb as it switches in and potentially poison it, making it significantly easier to wear down.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive Roselia fits nicely on both balance and stall teams, with its Spikes wearing down the checks and counters of the former's fast sweepers and gnawing away at the opposing team for the latter. Rock-types such as Carracosta, Rhydon, and Regirock check the Flying- and Fire-types and, in general, the physical attackers that threaten Roselia and can also set up Stealth Rock, creating a nice entry hazard-stacking core; in return, Roselia takes on the Water- and Grass-types that maim them. Fire- and Water-types such as Magmortar and Samurott also beat Fire-types, with the former also checking Ice-types and the latter checking Archeops, and in return, Roselia's Spikes enhances their ability to sweep or wallbreak. Checks to Psychic-types, such as Scyther, Klinklang, and Dark- and Ghost-types, are decent partners to Roselia; notably, Skuntank can also Pursuit trap Xatu to allow Roselia to set up entry hazards more easily, and Ghost-types such as Mismagius can spinblock to help keep Spikes up. Quagsire is a particularly nice partner, as it compensates for not using Vileplume thanks to its ability to counter Swords Dance Samurott, Klinklang, and many other physical attackers, and the two possess good type synergy overall.</p>"

      "Focus Sash Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roselia is one of the best Spikers for hyper offense teams, and it can set them reliably with a combination of its other moves and its surprise factor. Sludge Bomb is a strong STAB move with solid neutral coverage, notably hitting Xatu neutrally. Toxic Spikes in tandem with with Spikes chips away at teams without a grounded Poison-type with great ease. On the other hand, Leaf Storm hits extremely hard and nails opposing entry hazard setters such as Rhydon and Regirock, entry hazard removers such as Claydol and Sandslash, and Water-types such as Samurott, though Roselia can put most of them to sleep anyway. Sleep Powder immobilizes the foe for a few turns, keeping entry hazard setters and setup sweepers from setting up and entry hazard removers from doing away with Roselia's entry hazards. It also gives Roselia free turns to set up Spikes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature allow Roselia to outspeed as much as possible, particularly most Skuntank sets, slow variants of Xatu, Mesprit, and Klinklang, Modest Claydol, and neutral-natured Samurott, and maximum Special Attack investment lets Roselia hit fairly hard. With Focus Sash, Roselia can take any hit if it hasn't taken any prior damage, guaranteeing that Roselia will set up at least one layer of Spikes. Poison Point is lead Roselia's only useful ability and can occasionally cripple physical attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Roselia should lead in most matches in order to lay down Spikes as early as possible and avoid having its Focus Sash broken by entry hazards. Roselia should typically start off by using Sleep Powder, preventing the foe from setting up or attacking it and creating a few free turns to lay entry hazards. When up against a team with Xatu, it's not recommended to set up Spikes until Xatu is out of the way; try to catch it on the switch with Sludge Bomb, 2HKOing it and potentially poisoning it. Certain setup sweepers such as Klinklang, Mawile, and Pawniard can be tricky to play around after Roselia has put a foe to sleep or if it's a fast Klinklang variant, and so they should be played around with teammates that can check them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lead Roselia is a great option on hyper offense teams looking for a reliable entry hazard-stacking lead. Generally speaking, Roselia doesn't really need much support to perform its role, but certain teammates will make it more effective overall. Spinblockers such as Mismagius and Rotom are incredibly useful for keeping entry hazards up. A Pursuit trapper, such as Skuntank or Liepard, or a Xatu lure, such as Mesprit with Ice Beam, can make it easier for Roselia to set up Spikes against teams with Xatu, but it can 2HKO Xatu with Sludge Bomb anyway. Klinklang checks are also good partners, especially considering that fast variants can use Roselia as setup fodder. Pair Roselia up with offensive Pokemon that can take advantage of Spikes and Toxic Spikes to break through the opposing team, such as Tauros, Archeops, and Shiftry.</p>"

      "Offensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes-stacking is one of the most threatening strategies in the metagame, and Roselia makes for a potent offensive Spiker. Leaf Storm dents anything that doesn't resist it, and it takes the most advantage of the few turns Roselia will typically stay in. Sludge Bomb offers solid coverage and nails Grass-, Flying-, Bug-, and Fire-types. Sleep Powder allows Roselia to immobilize would-be counters, especially Poison- and Steel-types, and creates free turns for it to set up more Spikes. Giga Drain is a more consistent Grass-type STAB move that also gives it Roselia more longevity, but Leaf Storm typically ends up doing more damage regardless because Roselia will rarely stay in for more than a few turns, and Sludge Bomb is already a consistent STAB move anyway. Synthesis is an option, especially in for bulky variants, that allows Roselia to play as a more reliable Grass- and Water-type check.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment and a Modest nature make Roselia surprisingly powerful, notably 2HKOing Xatu with Sludge Bomb. The Speed EVs let Roselia outspeed neutral-natured base 55 Speed Pokemon such as Cacturne and Golurk, and the remaining EVs are put into HP to make Roselia bulkier. A bulkier spread is also an option, running at least 56 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Rhydon. Eviolite gives Roselia passable bulk. Natural Cure allows Roselia to act as a status absorber, especially for Scald users.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Roselia should come in on resisted Water-, Grass-, and Electric-type moves, but you must be careful of super effective coverage moves, as this set doesn't have the bulk to shrug them off. Use most free turns afforded by Sleep Powder and Roselia's ability to threaten Pokemon out to set up Spikes, occasionally dishing out Leaf Storm and Sludge Bomb to dent switch-ins such as Garbodor, Magmortar, and especially Xatu, which can bounce back Roselia's entry hazards. Go for Sleep Powder against switch-ins such as Garbodor and Skuntank that otherwise counter Roselia; use the free turn to either set up Spikes or switch out to a teammate that takes advantage of the switch-in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Roselia fits best on fast offensive teams that appreciate its ability to check Water-, Rock, and Ground-types better than Garbodor and its ability to check Grass-types, not fall over to Fighting-types and Mega Audino, and actually hit harder with Leaf Storm than Cacturne. Offensive checks to Fire-types, such as Samurott, Magmortar, and Hariyama, are good partners, with the latter two also checking Ice-types. The likes of Klinklang and Rhydon handle the Flying-types Roselia struggles with; Klinklang can beat Psychic-types for Roseila as well. Dark- and Ghost-types, such as Liepard and Mismagius, can also beat Psychic-types. Generally speaking, fast Pokemon such as Tauros, Archeops, and Floatzel help to make up for Roselia's middling Speed. In return, Roselia's Spikes support allows its offensive partners to swiftly wear down their checks and counters so that they can sweep.</p>"

  "Camerupt": {
    "overview": "<p>Camerupt holds a firm niche in the tier thanks to its defensive typing, which allows it to counter Rotom, a prominent threat in the metagame, and absorb Will-O-Wisp. With decent bulk when invested, it is also a solid user of Stealth Rock, making it a good support option for balanced teams. Its excellent STAB coverage and powerful Fire Blast when equipped with Choice Specs make it a potent offensive threat as well. However, its low Speed means it is very susceptible to being forced out or revenge killed, and it often has to hit its checks with coverage moves on predicted switches, as Camerupt is often slower than various defensive Pokemon. Camerupt can easily become setup bait for various Water-types, as defensive sets will fail to do enough damage to Samurott or Ludicolo, while offensive sets may find themselves Choice locked into the wrong move. Finally, Camerupt faces competition from other Pokemon, such as Steelix, which sports more useful resistances as a bulky Stealth Rock setter, and other offensive Fire-types such as Charizard, Magmortar, and Pyroar, all of which are faster and have either greater coverage, more versatility, or more support options.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Polish can be used to make Camerupt a late game sweeper, as it can find plenty of setup opportunities, but its lower bulk than Rhydon and inability to tank priority moves, means there are better options for cleaners. On defensive sets, Camerupt can make use of Roar or Yawn in the last slot to phaze foes and rack up entry hazard damage, but generally speaking it is better off spreading as much status as possible.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Mantine and Pelipper in particular resist or are immune to Camerupt's STAB moves and can KO it with Scald or Defog away the Stealth Rock it sets up. Pelipper needs a specially defensive spread or it gets 2HKOed by Fire Blast, however. Both must also beware of Hidden Power Electric. Other Water-types such as Samurott, Kabutops, and Ludicolo can all switch in and force out Camerupt unless they come in on the wrong STAB move. These three Water-types, along with Barbaracle, can all set up on Camerupt if it's locked into the wrong STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Even offensive variants of Altaria and Sliggoo can switch in on Camerupt and retaliate with a powerful Draco Meteor or Muddy Water, respectively. Fire Blast nearly 2HKOes Altaria, so it needs Stealth Rock off the field in order to switch in safely. Defensive Sliggoo is the best answer to Camerupt in NU, as it takes a pittance from Fire Blast, is only 3HKOed by Choice Specs Earth Power, and it has Rest to heal off a potential Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Malamar and RestTalk Mega Audino set up easily on defensive Camerupt and can set up on the Choice Specs set if it is locked into Hidden Power Electric. They should avoid freely switching into Choice Specs variants, however, as Fire Blast 2HKOes both of them.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is essential for every competitive team, and Camerupt can provide it thanks to its typing that allows it to beat Pokemon such as Weezing and Rotom, to which nearly every Stealth Rock user in the tier loses. Lava Plume is the main STAB move on this set thanks to its chance to burn foes, which is more useful on a defensive set, potentially allowing Camerupt to cripple Thick Fat Hariyama and bulky Rock-type switch-ins such as Rhydon. It also helps prevent Xatu from trying to bounce back Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce, as a burn drastically decreases its longevity. Earthquake hits Pokemon that resist Fire such as Lanturn and bulky Rock-types. Earthquake is preferred over Earth Power because Camerupt will often be taking on Magmortar, which takes much more damage from physical attacks. Toxic and Will-O-Wisp are both useful for wearing down bulkier switch-ins. Toxic is preferred because it wears down Mantine and Pelipper more quickly while also not being completely useless against Charizard. It is also useful for crippling Calm Mind Musharna, even though it comes at the cost of poisoning Camerupt too. Will-O-Wisp is still useful if crippling Thick Fat Hariyama and Rhydon is more important for your team. Rock Slide can have use in the last slot if your team is very weak to Charizard, as it allows Camerupt to defeat it with much more ease. Finally, Protect is helpful for letting Camerupt gain additional recovery through Leftovers, as well as scouting choiced locked Pokemon such as Mesprit, Pyroar, and Primeape.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum special bulk alongside a Calm nature is necessary so that Camerupt can tank hits from the likes of Rotom, Mismagius, Magmortar, and other special attackers and set up Stealth Rock or retaliate appropriately. Leftovers is important so that Camerupt doesn't get worn down too quickly over the course of the match. Solid Rock allows Camerupt to take various super effective hits, such as non-STAB Earthquake from the likes of Tauros and Archeops, and potentially set up Stealth Rock or put the foe in range of a revenge killer. An offensive Stealth Rock set with an EV spread of 140 HP / 252 SpA / 116 Spe is viable if you specifically need both Stealth Rock and Camerupt's wallbreaking ability. In this case, Hidden Power Electric is preferred in the last slot, as it does heavy damage to Mantine and Pelipper and can deter them from trying to come in immediately to Defog away Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Camerupt's ability to come in on Rotom, Weezing, Mismagius, Garbodor, and bulky Grass-types to set up Stealth Rock. Using status moves on predicted Mantine and Pelipper switch-ins is often very beneficial, as it will be difficult for them to continuously use Defog over the course of the match. Likewise, if you have Will-O-Wisp on Camerupt, it can be very useful for your team to opt for this move on the switch to cripple an incoming Thick Fat Hariyama or Rhydon. Although defensive Camerupt does not hit very hard, it can also be more beneficial for your team to fish for Lava Plume burns or hit Lanturn switch-ins with Camerupt's Earthquake, depending on the circumstance.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Camerupt pairs well with sweepers that dislike Rotom's presence in general, as a large draw to using Stealth Rock Camerupt is because it is one of few Stealth Rock setters in the tier that don't lose to Rotom. Barbaracle in particular likes Camerupt as a partner, as Stealth Rock helps Barbaracle clean, and Camerupt helps Barbaracle deal with Rotom and Gourgeist-XL, with the former giving it a very difficult time in the early- and mid-game and the latter being a hard counter. Scyther also appreciates defensive Camerupt, as its bulk allows it to stay around longer to come in on Scyther's checks and counters. Fighting-types such as Primeape and Hitmonchan pair well with Camerupt, as it beats a lot of their checks one-on-one, including Rotom, Gourgeist, Weezing, and Garbodor, and provides Stealth Rock, which helps them break past their counters. Xatu must also risk taking a Lava Plume burn and damage if it wants to try to reflect Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce, meaning it won't be able to check Fighting-types for the opposing team. Strong checks to Water-types are necessary on the same team thanks to Camerupt's weakness to them.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is a powerful STAB move that at least 2HKOes pretty much everything that doesn't resist it. Earth Power is a great secondary STAB move that hits bulky Rock-types such as Rhydon and Regirock, other Fire-types such as Magmortar and Ninetales, and Lanturn super effectively while hitting other Water-types hard. Lava Plume is the most spammable move on the set in part because of its perfect accuracy, which can be useful when Camerupt doesn't need Fire Blast's power, as well as its chance to burn foes, which can cripple certain counters. Hidden Power Electric 2HKOes Mantine, which otherwise hard counters Camerupt. It also deals with Charizard, which resists Camerupt's STAB moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs, a Modest nature, and 252 Special Attack EVs allow Camerupt to hit as hard as possible. The Speed EVs allow Camerupt to outspeed Gourgeist-XL. It also ensures that Camerupt will be able to outspeed uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon even if they run some Speed creep EVs. The rest of the EVs go into HP to help it tank various attacks. Solid Rock allows Camerupt to survive various super effective attacks, such as Earthquake, that would otherwise OHKO it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bulky Rotom, Weezing, and Garbodor are all common threats that Camerupt can easily switch in on. Don't be afraid to double switch to punish these Pokemon for switching in. Utilizing slow Volt Switch and U-turn users can also be effective in bringing Camerupt onto the field safely. Once Camerupt hits the field, proceed to annihilate the opposing team by clicking the appropriate coverage move. Lava Plume is generally the safest play to make, such as when the opponent has Hariyama or has absolutely nothing to take Camerupt's attacks. It is also useful for scouting switch-ins and burning counters. Use Earth Power when you predict your opponent to go into Lanturn or a bulky Rock-type, but be mindful that being Choice locked into the move can be risky due to it not hitting Levitate users and Flying-types. When it looks like your opponent's best switch-in to Camerupt is a bulky Pokemon that doesn't resist Fire such as Musharna or Audino, use Fire Blast. Use Hidden Power Electric to catch Mantine on the switch, but beware that Camerupt becomes very exploitable if it locks itself into the move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Scyther can get Camerupt into the battle easily thanks to U-turn. Camerupt also has a very good matchup against most Scyther checks, which include Steelix, Rotom, Weezing, Garbodor, and Rhydon. Bulky Grass-types such Vileplume and Ferroseed deal with Water-types that threaten Camerupt, a lot of which, such as Samurott, Kabutops, and Barbaracle can freely set up on Camerupt locked into a Fire-type move. Electric-types such as Lanturn and Rotom can help Camerupt deal with Mantine. They can also use Volt Switch to get Camerupt onto the field. On the flip side, pairing Camerupt with late-game cleaners in general is beneficial to take advantage of the mess that Camerupt makes of the opposing team. Both Mixed and Swords Dance Shiftry, two notable sets capable of cleaning late-game, work well with Camerupt. Mixed Shiftry helps with wearing down Hariyama and Sliggoo, while Swords Dance Shiftry appreciates Camerupt's ability to switch into and destroy Weezing. Likewise, Pokemon such as Swords Dance Samurott and other sweepers that are walled by Mantine and Pelipper appreciate Camerupt's ability to lure them in and weaken them with Hidden Power Electric.</p>"

  "Grumpig": {
    "overview": "<p>Grumpig's uncommon access to Thick Fat sets it apart from other bulky Psychic-types in the tier by allowing it to switch into threatening Fire- and Ice-type wallbreakers, such as Magmortar, Vanilluxe, and Aurorus. Its useful defensive niche for teams is outlined by its variety of support moves, such as Heal Bell, Thunder Wave, Whirlwind, and Taunt, and its impressive special bulk. Additionally, Grumpig is one of the few Psychic-types in NU with access to Focus Blast, which allows it to fight back against the Steel- and Dark-types that try to switch into its Psychic-type STAB move. However, Grumpig is cursed with a lacking Defense stat, meaning it struggles to effectively check Fighting-types, such as Primeape and Hariyama, like its fellow Psychic-types. Due to a lack of reliable recovery moves, Grumpig is prone to being easily whittled down throughout a match. It also faces stiff competition from other bulky Psychic-types, such as Mesprit and Musharna, which have access to better utility moves and recovery and serve as effective Fighting-type switch-ins because of their superior physical bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Grass Knot is an option on the offensive set to deal a lot of damage to Rhydon. Shadow Ball can be used to hit Xatu while retaining coverage against other Psychic-types, albeit at the expense of coverage against Dark-types. A physically defensive set can be used to allow Grumpig to check Fighting-types like Hariyama more easily, but it faces stiff competition from Mesprit and Musharna and sacrifices a lot of the utility of the specially defensive set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types that carry Knock Off and Pursuit can deal massive damage to Grumpig, although they must be wary of Focus Blast and Signal Beam. However, Malamar cannot be 2HKOed by defensive Grumpig's Signal Beam, so it is especially threatening. Skuntank is probably the hardest Dark-type for Grumpig to deal with because, at worst, it takes neutral damage from Grumpig's common coverage moves and threatens it with Pursuit and Sucker Punch. Additionally, Skuntank commonly carries Lum Berry, meaning it is not as susceptible to Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu resists all of Grumpig's common coverage moves and isn't affected by any status moves because of Magic Bounce. Xatu can cripple Grumpig with Thunder Wave or use it as setup fodder for Calm Minds.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Grumpig is very physically frail, so it will often lose large chunks of HP against strong physical attackers, such as Archeops, Scyther, and Kangaskhan. However, most of these attackers cannot switch in because of the threat of status or Grumpig's coverage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Grumpig's Special Attack and Special Defense, giving it an easier time breaking through bulkier Pokemon and making it harder to revenge kill with special attacks. Psyshock gives Grumpig the upper hand in Calm Mind wars versus the likes of Xatu and Mega Audino while also hitting specially bulky Pokemon such as Hariyama and Hitmonchan. Alternately, Psychic can be used to deal more immediate damage to physically bulky foes such as Samurott, Vileplume, and Weezing. Focus Blast crushes Steel-types such as Steelix and Ferroseed, as well as Dark-types such as Shiftry and Liepard. It also has other uses in targeting the likes of Rhydon, Regirock, and Abomasnow, as well as being Grumpig's strongest attack against Skuntank. Signal Beam hits opposing Psychic-types such as Malamar and Mesprit while doubling as a perfectly accurate attack with which to hit Dark-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment and a Modest nature are used to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment allows Grumig to take advantage of its good Speed tier and outpace the likes of Garbodor and Samurott while tying with opposing base 80 Speed Pokemon. Thick Fat reduces the damage Grumpig takes from Fire- and Ice-type attacks. Leftovers provides passive recovery, though a Colbur Berry can be used to provide insurance versus Dark-type attacks, allowing Grumpig to take a Sucker Punch or Knock Off if it is healthy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Generally, you should use Grumpig's ability to force out the likes of Hitmonchan and Weezing to set up Calm Mind, but in some scenarios it may be more beneficial to attack, especially if your opponent has a Dark-type. Specifically, if your opponent has a Skuntank, setting up a Calm Mind is almost pointless, as Grumpig will just be trapped after KOing a Pokemon. Due to Grumpig's average Speed and low physical bulk, it will rarely pull off a full sweep; because of this, as well as its great coverage, it should be played as a mid-game breaker. While it cannot switch into Fire- and Ice-type attacks over and over, use Grumpig's resistances to them to give it opportunities to set up on the likes of Magmortar and Aurorus.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steelix checks powerful physical attackers that threaten Grumpig such as Kangaskhan, Tauros, and Scyther and can deal with Skuntank. Other checks to Dark-types such as Mega Audino and Primeape are also helpful. Late-game cleaners such as Swellow and Tauros appreciate Grumpig's ability to break through defensive cores. Tauros specifically enjoys Grumpig breaking through bulky Rock- and Steel-types such as Rhydon and Steelix. Spikes support from the likes of Ferroseed and Garbodor helps Grumpig break the opponent's team even faster. Most notably, entry hazard support is useful to break Steelix's Sturdy. Ferroseed also appreciates Grumpig's handy Fire resistance, and Garbodor acts as a secondary and much more durable Fighting switch-in. Weezing acts as a more reliable Fighting switch-in and a flexible check for strong physical attackers, such as Rhydon, Kangaskhan, and Scyther.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is Grumpig's strongest STAB move, but Psyshock can be used as an alternative to hit some physically frailer Pokemon, such as Magmortar, Ninetales, and Cryogonal, for more damage. Focus Blast provides great neutral coverage alongside Grumpig's Psychic-type STAB move because it nails Dark- and Steel-types, such as Shiftry, Liepard, Mawile, and Klinklang. Taunt shuts down slower Pokemon that rely on status moves to beat Grumpig, such as defensive Mawile, Mega Audino, Ferroseed, and Regirock, and prevents them from taking advantage of Grumpig. Thunder Wave cripples fast offensive Pokemon, such as Lilligant, Vivillon, and Mismagius. Alternatively, Toxic whittles down bulky Pokemon that Grumpig has trouble with, such as Mesprit, Mega Audino, and Musharna. Signal Beam can be used instead of Focus Blast to hit Malamar and Psychic-types harder while still retaining super-effective coverage for Dark-types. However, without Focus Blast, Grumpig struggles to take down opposing Steel-types. Power Gem is also an option to hit primarily Charizard as well as other Fire-types such as Pyroar and Magmortar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment is preferred to take advantage of Grumpig's great special bulk. Running 96 Speed EVs allows Grumpig to outspeed everything up to Adamant Pawniard. The remaining EVs are invested in Special Attack with a Modest nature to give Grumpig's attacks some more power. Thick Fat sets Grumpig apart from other bulky Psychic-types by providing it with invaluable Fire- and Ice-type resistances. Leftovers provides Grumpig with passive recovery throughout the match. Colbur Berry can weaken a Dark-type's STAB attack for Grumpig to give it the opportunity to retaliate with Focus Blast, Signal Beam, Thunder Wave, or Toxic. Additionally, Fighting-types that commonly carry Knock Off, such as Hariyama, cannot OHKO Grumpig if it's holding a Colbur Berry. Assault Vest is also an option that sacrifices some its utility moves for being a more consistent switch in to Fire- and Ice-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Thick Fat to switch Grumpig into high-powered Fire- and Ice-type attacks from the likes of Magmortar, Vanilluxe, and Aurorus. However, do not keep Grumpig in against strong physical attackers, such as Archeops and Tauros, because they can KO Grumpig with a little prior damage. Make use of aggressive double switches to prevent Pokemon with Pursuit, such as Liepard and Skuntank, from trapping Grumpig. Grumpig should spread paralysis on opposing offensive teams to slow them down to a pace that it can keep up with, while it can defeat slower, passive Pokemon, such as Mega Audino, Regirock, and Pelipper, by incapacitating them with Taunt and whittling them down with attacks or Toxic damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Grumpig fits well on balanced teams in need of a stallbreaker with the ability to switch into Fire- and Ice-types. Grass-types, such as Tangela, Vileplume, and Lilligant, appreciate Grumpig's ability to switch into Magmortar and Ice-types. Physically bulky Poison-types, such as Weezing and Garbodor, beat the physical attackers that threaten Grumpig, such as Klinklang, Samurott, and Scyther. Additionally, Grumpig provides these Poison-types with a useful Psychic-type resistance. Ground-types, such as Rhydon and Sandslash, beat Skuntank, one of the safest switch-ins to Grumpig available. Ironically, Skuntank is a great partner for Grumpig as well because it is a safe switch-in to many of the Psychic-types in the tier, such as Musharna, Xatu, and Mesprit.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is Grumpig's strongest and most reliable STAB move. Heal Bell removes status conditions from Grumpig and its teammates. Thunder Wave slows down opposing offensive Pokemon that try to take advantage of Grumpig's weak offensive presence. Toxic whittles down bulky foes, such as Gourgeist-XL and Mega Audino. Whirlwind is useful to phaze Pokemon that try to set up on Grumpig, such as Klinklang and Mega Audino. Taunt can prevent slower Pokemon, such as Musharna, Regirock, and Roselia, from setting up entry hazards or healing against Grumpig. Signal Beam can be used to punish Dark-types, such as Malamar and Liepard, that try to switch into Grumpig.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment with a Calm nature maximizes Grumpig's special bulk, granting it a variety of safe opportunities to switch in. Thick Fat is Grumpig's defining quality because of the useful Fire- and Ice-type resistances it provides. Leftovers provides Grumpig with invaluable passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because Grumpig fits best on defensive teams that require its unique combination of resistances and utility moves, you should play it safe and not make overly risky decisions that have a chance of incapacitating Grumpig. Grumpig should use its great special bulk and resistances to switch into special wallbreakers, such as Magmortar, Poliwrath, and Aurorus, while letting its teammates handle physical attackers because of its lacking Defense. If Grumpig's teammates have set multiple entry hazards, it can use Whirlwind to phaze foes to quickly whittle them down. If Grumpig or its teammates are afflicted by any detrimental status conditions, it can use Heal Bell to refresh your team's condition.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially defensive Grumpig only fits on passive, defensive teams in need of a reliable Fire-type check that can support the team with Heal Bell. Mega Audino provides Grumpig with Wish support and a handy Dark-type resistance, which especially comes in handy for absorbing Knock Off to preserve Grumpig's precious Leftovers. Additionally, Mega Audino appreciates that it doesn't need to run Heal Bell if Grumpig already carries it. Garbodor is a more reliable Fighting-resistant Pokemon and sets up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which work well with Grumpig's Whirlwind to phaze and whittle down its foes. Defensive Grass-types, such as Gourgeist-XL, Vileplume, and Ferroseed, appreciate Grumpig's Heal Bell and ability to switch into powerful Fire- and Ice-type wallbreakers.</p>"

  "Cacturne": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its great mixed offensive prowess alongside a potent STAB type combination of Dark and Grass, Cacturne finds its place in NU as a stellar wallbreaker. To complement its formidable offensive capabilities, Cacturne possesses a myriad of support options, including Spikes, Destiny Bond, and Spiky Shield. In particular, Cacturne is an excellent user of Spikes, being able to offensively pressure all common users of Rapid Spin while being more offensively inclined than the other two relevant users of Spikes, Garbodor and Roselia. In addition, Cacturne's ability Water Absorb lets it check many of the Water-types of NU, most notably Lanturn, Prinplup, and Quagsire. Despite these positives, Cacturne is not without its issues, the most apparent being how it faces stiff competition from Shiftry, which boasts better Speed, access to the coveted Defog and Knock Off, and a level of unpredictability, as it's able to run a multitude of sets alongside unique coverage options, most notably Explosion and Extrasensory. However, Cacturne separates itself with its excellent mixed attacking stats, Water Absorb, and access to Spikes. Cacturne's frailty is also noteworthy, preventing it from switching in on much other than a Water- or Psychic-type attack; even then, most Pokemon that use those attacks have coverage to hit Cacturne, such as Lanturn carrying Ice Beam and Mesprit having Signal Beam, making every direct switch into Cacturne a risky one. Furthermore, due to its low Speed, Cacturne struggles against faster-paced offensive teams, as its reliance on Sucker Punch to deal with faster attackers can be easily exploited by sweepers to achieve free turns to set up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute can be used in the last slot, as it capitalizes on Cacturne's ability to force switches and can make it far harder to revenge kill; this also synergizes well with Giga Drain, giving Cacturne a form of recovery to make up for the Substitute damage and Life Orb recoil. Cacturne can utilize a Swords Dance set to break down defensive teams; however, such a set is largely outclassed by Shiftry, only sporting a stronger Sucker Punch over it. Cacturne can act as a suicide lead, setting Spikes, eliminating physical attackers with Counter combined with a Focus Sash, and using Destiny Bond once its job is done; however, this set is mostly outclassed by other suicide leads, such as Crustle and Archeops.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Roselia and Garbodor can switch in on any attack Cacturne can use and retaliate with a super effective STAB move. Garbodor could be used as a soft check to Cacturne, resisting Grass-type attacks and taking little from Sucker Punch while being able to OHKO in return with Gunk Shot; however, it cannot outspeed Hasty variants of Cacturne, which 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Combusken, Magmortar, and Pyroar make for decent answers to Cacturne, being able to stomach a Sucker Punch and OHKO in return. Combusken in particular can reliably switch into any attack Cacturne might want to go for thanks to its resistance to both Grass- and Dark-type attacks and access to Eviolite, and it can retaliate with an OHKO. Pyroar can also play mind games with Cacturne, using Will-O-Wisp or Substitute to dodge Cacturne's Sucker Punch, meaning Cacturne will be crippled or give Pyroar a free Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Zweilous and Malamar can easily OHKO Cacturne with an Outrage or Superpower, respectively. Zweilous in particular is a solid counter to Cacturne, being able to switch into its STAB attacks with ease and to eliminate Cacturne with its powerful Outrage and use Rest to heal off any damage. Although it may not resist Cacturne's STAB attacks, Malamar has the Special Defense needed to survive any attack Cacturne might want to go for and can use it as setup fodder thanks to Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: While they won't enjoy switching into an Energy Ball, Fighting-types such as Primeape and Hariyama resist Cacturne's Dark-type attacks and can OHKO it in return with their respective STAB moves. It's also worth noting Hitmonchan can pick off Cacturne with Mach Punch, preventing it from setting up a last-ditch layer of Spikes or firing off a Giga Drain. Hariyama can switch into any attack Cacturne might want to go for at least once and OHKO with Close Combat in return.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Mega Audino and Mawile can switch into a Dark-type move from Cacturne and OHKO it in return. However, Cacturne's Energy Ball has a chance to 2HKO both of these Pokemon after some chip damage, so keeping these Pokemon healthy is necessary for them to check Cacturne effectively.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Scyther and Articuno can comfortably come in on any attack Cacturne might want to go for, use Roost to recover the damage dealt, and threaten it back with an Aerial Ace or Freeze-Dry, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Given a free switch, faster attackers such as Tauros, Rotom-S, Samurott, and Liepard can come in on Cacturne, take a Sucker Punch, and OHKO in return with their respective attacks. Be aware that these Pokemon are simply offensive checks and should not be switching into Cacturne.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dark Pulse is Cacturne's main STAB attack, 2HKOing most of the tier thanks to its respectable Base Power and the small pool of reliable Pokemon that resist Dark-type attacks. Giga Drain is a powerful secondary STAB move, hitting Water-, Ground-, and Fighting-types for significant damage, recovering some health, and providing excellent coverage alongside Dark Pulse. Energy Ball can be used for the higher power; however, it misses out on the recovery of Giga Drain, and the power gain is minimal. Cacturne's Sucker Punch is the strongest, albeit somewhat unreliable, priority move in NU, easily threatening faster Psychic- and Ghost-types that lack a Colbur Berry, as well as letting Cacturne overcome its lackluster Speed and pick off a faster foe. Spikes is the preferred choice for the last moveslot, letting Cacturne support its team by weakening grounded foes as they switch in. Cacturne is a particularly effective user of Spikes, as it beats nearly all users of entry hazard control outside of Skuntank. Destiny Bond can be used to take down a foe when Cacturne will be going down anyway, and it is particularly useful against a Mega Audino's Dazzling Gleam or Hariyama's Close Combat. Spiky Shield can be used to ease prediction against users of Choice items and to punish use of physical attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread and a Mild nature allow Cacturne to hit as hard and as fast as possible without taking away from its ability to switch into weaker special attacks or the power of Sucker Punch. Life Orb boosts Cacturne's power to incredible levels, with only a minor toll in the form of a small amount of recoil damage after each attack. Water Absorb is the necessary ability, as it makes Cacturne an excellent offensive check to the abundance of Water-types in the tier, most notably Lanturn, Prinplup, and Quagsire. A Hasty nature can be used over Mild; however, all this accomplishes is outspeeding neutral-natured Aurorus, Exeggutor, and standard Garbodor while tying with neutral-natured Flareon and Sandslash, at the cost of a noticeable drop in power that isn't really worth it for most teams. If you do choose to use a Hasty nature, however, Energy Ball should be chosen over Giga Drain to somewhat compensate for the loss of power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its frailty, Cacturne should be brought in on a safe switch, such as by a slow U-turn or Volt Switch or after a teammate has fainted, to keep it as healthy as possible. If necessary, Cacturne should be switched in on an attack it's immune to, such as Lanturn's Scald or Musharna's Psychic, or a weaker attack, such as Quagsire's Earthquake or Rotom's Shadow Ball. Cacturne is often best played aggressively early-game, punching holes in the team with its powerful STAB attacks or setting Spikes to whittle down foes upon them switching in. Destiny Bond, if chosen, should be used when Cacturne would otherwise be knocked out, in an attempt to take the foe down with it. This is especially useful when up against slower attackers that can knock Cacturne out, such as Hariyama and Mega Audino, if they choose to attack Cacturne. Be wary when using Sucker Punch, as your opponent can play around this by going for a non-attacking move, often forcing 50-50 situations. This is particularly troublesome when Cacturne is facing setup sweepers, such as Klinklang, as they can avoid Sucker Punch while getting a free turn to set up. Additionally, it should be noted that many foes that Sucker Punch threatens, such as Rotom and Mismagius, can use Will-O-Wisp to avoid Sucker Punch and cripple Cacturne for the rest of the match. If Spiky Shield is run, it should be used primarily to get off chip damage on physical attackers such as Hariyama or to scout what move users of Choice items will be locking themselves into.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cacturne fits best on faster-paced offensive teams that appreciate a check to Water-types and Spikes support more than they would the speed and Defog support that Shiftry can provide. Klinklang is the near-perfect partner for Cacturne in offensive synergy, with Klinklang setting up on the Fairy-, Flying-, and Bug-types that plague Cacturne and Cacturne defeating the Electric- and Water-types that stop Klinklang; however, be aware that this core struggles with common Fighting- and Fire-types, so this should be accounted for accordingly. Electric-types, such as Rotom and Zebstrika, appreciate Cacturne eliminating Lanturn and Ground-types, while they check Flying-types in return. Lanturn makes for a noteworthy partner, checking the Fire- and Flying-types that Cacturne struggles with while Cacturne eliminates opposing Lanturn. Garbodor makes for a great partner, taking on the Fighting- and Fairy-types that trouble Cacturne while Cacturne handles the Ground- and Psychic-types that trash Garbodor. Using Garbodor also allows Cacturne to forgo Spikes for Destiny Bond or Spiky Shield. Running Spiky Shield on Cacturne when it is paired with Garbodor is also beneficial in that Cacturne can use Spiky Shield to maximize the damage stacked up by the Toxic Spikes set by Garbodor. Garbodor also punishes usage of U-turn with Rocky Helmet and Aftermath, which Cacturne attracts due to its 4x weakness to Bug-type attacks. Mesprit and Cacturne form a potent entry hazard-stacking core, with Mesprit setting Stealth Rock and Cacturne laying Spikes, whittling the foes down as they switch in. Late-game cleaners, such as Swellow, appreciate Cacturne punching holes in the opponent's team and laying Spikes so the cleaner can sweep up once the opposition is sufficiently weakened.</p>"

It has a decent defensive typing that makes it a solid answer to powerful threats like Magmortar, Hariyama, Gurdurr, Combusken, and Swords Dance Samurott. Altaria carves itself a solid niche on stall and semi-stall teams alike through its access to reliable recovery in Roost, support moves such as Heal Bell and Haze, and the ability to relieve itself of status with Nautral Cure. Furthermore, Its offensive Choice Specs set serves as a pivot on offensive teams that can be threatening with a strong Draco Meteor at the same time. However, Altaria faces competition from Sliggoo, which has no Stealth Rock weakness, a wider offensive movepool, and a more reliable ability. In addition, Altaria's offensive capabilities are significantly hindered by its sparce movepool and low base Special Attack. Altaria's defensive capabilities are also hampered by its weakness to Stealth Rock and 4x weakness to Ice-type attacks, both of which are very common in the NU metagame, as most Grass- and Water-types run an Ice-type attack for coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set consisting of Dragon Dance, Outrage, Earthquake, and Roost can be used as a late-game sweeper, but it is easily walled and still weak, even after multiple Dragon Dance boosts. Heal Bell is another option over Earthquake to get past Pokemon that use status moves in order to deal with Altaria; however, it is hard walled by all Fairy-types and pretty much all Steel-types. Life Orb is an option on the offensive set, letting Altaria run Roost instead of Rest and switch between moves. The power that Choice Specs gives, however, combined with not losing 10% HP after every attack, makes it the better option. Swapping out Dragon Pulse for Power Swap can be an option to catch opponents off guard. Power Swap restores Altaria's Special Attack to normal after it uses Draco Meteor. This allows Altaria to get past specially defensive Pokemon like Mantine better, but it doesn't work that often, making it not the most viable option. Cloud Nine can be chosen over Natural Cure to better check sun and rain teams; however, those are both quite uncommon and the utility that Natural Cure provides is way more useful most of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types like Mega Audino and Clefairy are both immune to Altaria's most spammable move in Draco Meteor and can pass off Wishes or set up Calm Mind on it.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Altaria's 4x weakness to Ice leaves it vulnerable to any Ice-type move and Pokemon. Bulkier Ice-types such as Lapras and Piloswine can switch in on Altaria's attacks and easily OHKO it with their STAB moves, while frailer ones like Jynx and Aurorus can't safely switch in but are still able to OHKO Altaria at full health.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types stop Altaria from spamming Draco Meteor, but they should still be aware of the possibility of Fire Blast. Furthermore, less bulky Steel-types, particularly Klinklang, still take significant damage from Draco Meteor.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roost provides Altaria with reliable recovery and keeps it healthy throughout the game. Flamethrower allows Altaria to hit Steel-types such as Steelix, Ferroseed, and Klinklang, which are immune to Toxic. Dragon Pulse can be used over Flamethrower to give Altaria better damage output versus neutral targets; however, it is still relatively weak and leaves Altaria completely walled by Steel-types, so it is not recommended. Toxic is key for wearing down Pokemon like Musharna, Rhydon, Gastrodon, Regirock, and Magmortar. Haze helps Altaria halt setup sweepers such as Samurott, Shiftry, and Gurdurr. However, Heal Bell can be used as an alternative, as it allows Altaria to act as a cleric for its team, which in turn allows Mega Audino to run a different support move such as Encore or Thunder Wave. Finally, Roar is a viable option to let Altaria phaze Pokemon and helps rack up entry hazard damage against the opponent's team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs maximize Altaria's overall bulk while also letting it switch into Stealth Rock four times. 212 Defense EVs with a Bold nature help Altaria tackle Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Gurdurr, as well as avoiding the 3HKO from Choice Band Primeape's Close Combat. 28 Special Defense EVs allow Altaria to avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Pyroar's Hyper Voice and Choice Specs Charizard's Air Slash after Leftovers recovery, therefore allowing it to act as a secondary check to most Fire-types. The Speed investment lets Altaria outrun Jolly Rhydon, allowing it to get off a last-ditch Toxic on Rhydon. Leftovers provides Altaria with passive recovery throughout a match. Natural Cure is Altaria's most useful ability, giving it the ability to heal itself by switching out should it be afflicted by status.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Altaria should be used primarily as a check to threatening Pokemon such as Swords Dance Samurott, Gurdurr, Hariyama, Combusken, Magmortar, and Shiftry. With Haze, Altaria is able to stop setup sweepers such as Samurott and Klinklang from overwhelming its team and therefore works effectively in aiding passive Pokemon such as Mega Audino and Bronzor, which could be used as setup bait. Use Roost frequently to keep Altaria healthy, as it can get worn down by Stealth Rock rather quickly. Altaria can attempt to cripple switch-ins with Toxic, as it will eventually outlast them thanks to Roost and Natural Cure. Moreover, Altaria can pivot into status moves such as Weezing's Will-O-Wisp, Gastrodon's Toxic, and Miltank's Thunder Wave to protect its teammates from being afflicted and either heal itself with Heal Bell or switch out and let Natural Cure activate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive Altaria fits primarily on stall and semi-stall teams, which need its specific set of resistances to counter certain threats like Magmortar, physical Samurott, Hariyama, and Shiftry. Steel-types including Steelix and Ferroseed are great partners for Altaria, as they can pivot into Fairy-types like Mega Audino and also set up entry hazards. They also appreciate Altaria's ability to pivot into Fire-types such as Magmortar while providing a sturdy resistance to Fighting-types as well. Partners that resist Ice-type moves, like Bronzor, Hariyama, Thick Fat Miltank, and Piloswine, are near-mandatory for Altaria, as it is extremely vulnerable to them. Finally, Altaria also appreciates entry hazard control, as it gets worn down by Stealth Rock very easily, which makes Hitmonchan and Skuntank good partners due to their ability to remove entry hazards from the field while sharing decent type synergy.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Altaria's most spammable move, even dealing significant damage to less bulky Pokemon that resist the move such as Klinklang. Fire Blast nails Steel-types such as Steelix, Ferroseed, and Klinklang that try to come in on a resisted Draco Meteor. Dragon Pulse is used in situations in which you can't afford to have Altaria's Special Attack stat lowered by Draco Meteor but still want to use a Dragon-type move. Rest takes advantage of Natural Cure, as Altaria's sleep will be cured right after it switches out. Sleep Talk can be picked over Rest to let Altaria act as a sleep absorber for the likes of Lilligant and Vivillon; however, Natural Cure clashes with this, as it removes sleep after Altaria switches out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment together with a Modest nature makes the best of Altaria's offensive stats. While a Timid nature may seem appealing to outspeed base 80 Pokemon such as Kabutops and Shiftry, the power provided by a Modest nature is important given how low Altaria's base Special Attack is. Natural Cure is useful, as Altaria doesn't need to worry about status ailments too much, making it easy to switch in to Scald or Will-O-Wisp, for example; it is also used to get rid of sleep caused by Rest.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Altaria is mainly used as an offensive switch-in to status users like Weezing, Vileplume, and Gourgeist, and it is also able to check offensive threats like Swords Dance Samurott, Combusken, and Magmortar due to its typing. Draco Meteor is the move of choice most of the time, as it hits pretty much everything that doesn't resist it for great damage. Use Fire Blast when predicting a possible switch to something that resists Draco Meteor like Steelix or Ferroseed. In a situation where Altaria is against a hard counter like Mega Audino or Clefairy, it is in your best interest to switch out and preserve Altaria, as Fire Blast has quite underwhelming damage output on a neutral hit. While Draco Meteor is Altaria's most spammable move, always be wary of Pokemon that can set up on a -2 Altaria, such as Samurott, Barbaracle, and Jynx.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Pokemon that hate dealing with fast Fire- or Fighting-types like Shiftry, special Skuntank, and Hariyama are good partners for offensive Altaria, as they help break each other's checks and counters. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Kabutops, Shiftry, and Hitmonchan is really beneficial for Altaria, as Stealth Rock hinders its ability to repeatedly get opportunities to attack and check threats. Sweepers that need their counters to be severely weakened in order to sweep and hate dealing with status users, such as Swellow, Barbaracle and Archeops, are good partners for Altaria, as Natural Cure allows it to come in on most status users and threaten them out with a strong attack. Lastly, Pokemon that deal with Fairy-types such as Mega Audino and Clefairy, such as Garbodor, Skuntank and Steelix, make for good team members, as they completely shuts down Altaria.</p>"

  "Zangoose": {
    "overview": "<p>A sky-high Attack stat coupled with Toxic Boost and Facade makes Zangoose a premier wallbreaker. Solid coverage options in Knock Off and Close Combat also grant Zangoose near-perfect coverage and allow it to bypass traditional Normal-type checks such as Rotom, Steelix, and Ferroseed. Zangoose has access to priority in Quick Attack, which allows it to pick off faster weakened threats such as Pyroar, Swellow, and Jynx. Unfortunately, Toxic Orb wears Zangoose down very quickly throughout a battle, limiting its late-game potential. Zangoose also has pitiful bulk, so it relies almost entirely on free switches in to do its job effectively, and although it does sport a decent Speed stat, it is still outpaced by many common threats such as Charizard, Archeops, and Primeape. This only decent Speed stat combined with its very poor bulk often makes Zangoose very easy to revenge kill, although Quick Attack does alleviate this to an extent. Additionally, Zangoose faces heavy competition from other Normal-types such as Tauros, Kangaskhan, and Swellow, which all sport either far superior Speed or far better bulk than Zangoose.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Protect can be used to ensure Zangoose can safely activate its Toxic Orb, but this is very situational and usually far less useful than Close Combat or Quick Attack. Swords Dance is another option that can be used over Close Combat, increasing Zangoose's late-game cleaning ability, but the ability to hit Rock- and Steel-types super effectively is usually better and Zangoose's terrible bulk makes it very difficult to find setup opportunities anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Faster offensive Pokemon such as Swellow, Archeops, and Floatzel greatly threaten Zangoose, as they can outspeed and OHKO it with ease. However, if weakened, they can be picked off by Quick Attack.</p> <p><strong>Garbodor</strong>: Garbodor annoys Zangoose, as Rocky Helmet + Aftermath + Toxic Orb damage immediately brings Zangoose down to half HP. Defensive Garbodor can also survive one Facade, racking up even more Rocky Helmet damage.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Between pitiful bulk and Toxic Orb residual damage, Zangoose is very susceptible to priority moves such as Kangaskhan's Fake Out, Poliwrath's Vacuum Wave, and Hitmonchan's Mach Punch, which all do large amounts of damage and can cut Zangoose's rampage short.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-type Pokemon prevent Zangoose from mindlessly clicking Facade and are immune to Quick Attack, making them rather annoying for Zangoose to go up against. Faster Ghost-types such as Rotom and Haunter can switch in on any attack other than Knock Off and do huge damage to Zangoose in return with STAB Thunderbolt and Sludge Bomb, respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Toxic Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Facade is Zangoose's most spammable and strongest attack, being boosted by STAB and Toxic Orb to an absurd 315 Base Power. Knock Off hits Ghost-types such as Gourgeist, Mismagius, and Haunter for huge damage. Close Combat smacks Rock-and Steel-types such as Rhydon, Steelix, and Ferroseed for super effective damage and has excellent synergy with Facade and Knock Off. Quick Attack is useful priority for revenge killing weakened offensive threats, and it somewhat mitigates Zangoose's only decent Speed stat.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs are used to hit as hard and as fast as possible. An Adamant nature is preferred over Jolly because the extra Speed will very rarely matter due to Zangoose's awkward Speed tier, and the extra power that comes with Adamant allows Zangoose to revenge kill offensive threats with Quick Attack more reliably. A Jolly nature does allow Zangoose to outspeed Pinsir, Adamant Kangaskhan, Vivillon, Timid Mesprit, and Hidden Power Rock and Fire variants of Lilligant. Toxic Orb is the most reliable way to status Zangoose, triggering Toxic Boost and increasing Facade's power. Toxic Boost provides Zangoose's main niche over other Normal-types in the tier.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Zangoose is best used in the early- and mid-game, where it can break down walls for late-game cleaners such as Swellow and Barbaracle to clean up. Activating Toxic Orb can often be tricky, but the easiest way to do so is to give Zangoose a free switch in, usually through a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. Other opportunities to safely activate Toxic Orb throughout the battle are forcing out a low-HP Focus Sash user such as Jynx with Quick Attack and revenge killing a weakened slower threat such as Mesprit with Knock Off or Aurorus with Close Combat. Zangoose wears itself down very quickly, so it is essential to fully utilize every turn that it is alive. If your opponent has a Ghost-type such as Rotom or Mismagius, it is often optimal to click Knock Off, as even if they chose not to switch in said Ghost-type, knocking another foe's item off is useful as well. Lastly, if your opponent lacks a Ghost-type, it is very safe to click Facade, as it will do huge damage to anything that doesn't resist it, and any Rock- or Steel-type that does resist Facade will be slower than Zangoose and will not enjoy taking a super effective Close Combat the following turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that make use of Volt Switch and U-turn such as Lanturn, Scyther, and Rotom are great partners for Zangoose, as they generate momentum and grant Zangoose with free switches in to start tearing through an opposing team. Musharna can effectively pivot into Fighting-types which plague Zangoose. Other Normal-types such as Tauros, Swellow, and Kangaskhan are also solid partners for Zangoose, as Zangoose muscles through typical Normal-type checks such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Ferroseed, clearing the way for another Normal-type to wreak havoc. Healing Wish support coming from Mesprit, Mega Audino, or Lilligant is also terrific for Zangoose, as it gives Zangoose a second opportunity to break down the opposing team after it has been weakened in the early- or mid-game. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Omastar, Garbodor, and Ferroseed is very useful for Zangoose, as having Spikes and Stealth Rock up on the opponent's side of the field makes Zangoose's job of wallbreaking far easier.</p>"

  "Claydol": {
    "overview": "<p>Claydol is one of the few Pokemon in NU with access to Rapid Spin, and it is one of the better users of the move. Its resistance to Stealth Rock plus immunity to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web make it downright impervious to the entry hazards it tries to remove. These qualities also grant Claydol a rare resistance to Rock + Ground, shared only by Torterra in NU. Claydol boasts good defenses as well as a wide movepool to hit various threats, particularly entry hazard setters and spinblockers, meaning it is quite capable of performing its job. However, Claydol's most notable flaws include mediocre offenses and lack of reliable recovery, and most of all its typing leaves it with a huge amount of weaknesses, making it susceptible to the majority of Pokemon in NU, so it needs to be heavily accounted for from a defensive standpoint.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Claydol's bulk would imply it can pull off a defensive set, it really relies on making use of its coverage to be effective, and giving up its offensive presence would turn it into one of the easiest setup fodders in the tier due to its numerous weaknesses. Life Orb gives Claydol's attacks a significant boost in power, but it cuts into Claydol's longevity, which is one of Claydol's main selling points. Claydol's physical movepool consists of Earthquake, Zen Headbutt, and Rock Slide, but covers less targets than its special movepool.</p> <p>Claydol's decent offensive movepool for a Psychic-type might imply it has a shot at performing Calm Mind sweeping sets, but its mediocre Speed and defensive typing not only make setup difficult but also leave it easily revenge killed. Alternatively, Claydol can attempt a Choice Specs set with Trick, but Psychic-types with superior wallbreaking potential, such as Mesprit and Mr. Mime, give it major competition. Claydol could try to take advantage of its numerous weaknesses with a Weakness Policy, but it due to its lackluster bulk it will not be able to take most super effective hits.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types prove a major obstacle at impeding Claydol's job, as they can both block Rapid Spin and threaten Claydol with super effective STAB moves. While they do not enjoy a Shadow Ball on the switch, Mismagius, Rotom, and Gourgeist all make solid checks, as they can force Claydol out should they switch into any other attack. Keep in mind that Gourgeist would detest switching into Toxic or Ice Beam, while offensive variants of Mismagius would feel the sting of Psyshock. Haunter and Golurk are riskier switch-ins in comparison due to their vulnerability to Shadow Ball / Psychic-type STAB and Grass Knot respectively, but they can also make good answers to Claydol.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: With their Ground-type resistance and super effective STAB attacks, Grass-types make for fine responses against Claydol. Some of the greatest threats to Claydol include Lilligant, Exeggutor, and Ludicolo, which can easily set up on Claydol and proceed to end it with boosted STAB attacks. Other Grass-types such as Leafeon, Torterra, Tangela, and Cacturne can also send Claydol packing. The Grass-types should beware of bothersome moves on the switch, such as Toxic or Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types can make quick work of Claydol, either with powerful STAB attacks or simply shrugging off its neutral attacks. Samurott, Ludicolo, Huntail, and Gorebyss can do away with Claydol easily or even take the time to set up in its face. Bulkier Water-types such as Mantine, Pelipper, and Prinplup can brush off Claydol's attacks and shower it with Scalds. Note that some Water-types, such as Kabutops, Carracosta, Quagsire, and Lanturn, dislike taking Claydol's Earth Power and/or Grass Knot.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Aside from Psyshock, Cryogonal has little to fear from Claydol and can beat it easily while also outlasting it. Jynx can take a hit or two from Claydol and start threatening it with powerful Ice-type attacks. Aurorus dislikes Earth Powers, but otherwise it is in the same league as Jynx, though it cannot switch in. While uncommon, Articuno and Regice pretty much make Claydol their playthings.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Liepard and Pawniard can all threaten Claydol with their STAB Knock Off, although switching them into Claydol is usually not advised. Cacturne has the benefit of resisting nearly every common move in Claydol's arsenal bar Ice Beam and being able to threaten Claydol with both STAB types. Malamar is barely scratched by any of Claydol's attacks bar Signal Beam and either uses Claydol as setup fodder or just simply attacks with STAB Knock Off. Pursuit proves a serious threat as well, heavily limiting Claydol's survivability if not KOing it outright as it tries to flee. Shiftry resists both of Claydol's STAB moves, only fearing Ice Beam and the rare Signal Beam, and in return threatens with both of its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Scyther</strong>: Scyther is a very effective check to Claydol as it is immune to Earth Power and takes paltry damage from Psychic, even Ice Beam cannot 2HKO bulky Scyther. Scyther can use Claydol as setup fodder for Swords Dances or threaten with U-turn to deal heavy damage and gain offensive momentum.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: While Claydol has good longevity as far as entry hazards are concerned, its lack of reliable recovery is still a problem for it. Status ailments such as Toxic and burn are amongst the best ways to wear it down, and even simply removing its Leftovers via Trick or Knock Off can make a decent hit to Claydol's survivability. Ferroseed gets special mention here, as it can wear down Claydol with Leech Seed and discourages the use of Rapid Spin to get rid of Leech Seed due to Iron Barbs. This also makes Ferroseed one of the few hazard setters with an outright advantage over Claydol.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Despite Claydol's good coverage allowing it to put up a decent fight, it can still fall prey to numerous setup sweepers in the tier. Examples include Mega Audino, Malamar, Lilligant, Xatu, Musharna, Samurott, Huntail, Gorebyss, Vivillon, and Togetic. Claydol's best option against most setup sweepers is Toxic, but that only delays the sweep, as Claydol itself is still not out of danger.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage Moves</strong>: Coverage moves are easily Claydol's biggest issue, as they undermines its otherwise decent bulk. Nearly every Pokemon in the metagame carries a move that happens to be super effective against Claydol, giving them a way to take out Claydol without even consciously realizing it. Discounting the amount of Pokemon with super effective STAB moves against Claydol, even non-STAB coverage moves, the most common of which include Knock Off, Hidden Power, and U-turn, can put a sizable dent in Claydol, especially considering Claydol's lack of reliable recovery.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Spinner": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin clears the field of entry hazards. Earth Power is Claydol's main STAB move, and it does good damage to various entry hazard setters such as Crustle, Garbodor, Regirock, and Mawile. Shadow Ball allows Claydol to hit Ghost-types such as Mismagius, Rotom, and Gourgeist, which not only block its Rapid Spin but would also take its Earth Power with ease. Shadow Ball also hits Psychic-types such as Mesprit, opposing Claydol, Xatu, and Exeggutor, all of which also resist or are immune to Earth Power.</p> <p>Psyshock allows Claydol to hit specially bulky targets such as Hariyama and Hitmonchan; it also hits Mismagius for a more solid 2HKO than Shadow Ball. Psychic allows Claydol to hit Weezing, a potential Toxic Spikes user, for major damage, as well as being Claydol's strongest attack against the likes of Poliwrath and Vileplume. Grass Knot can be used to score great damage against heavyweights or 4x Grass-weak Pokemon, such as Golurk, Rhydon, and Carracosta. Ice Beam allows Claydol to take down or deter Flying- and Grass-types, such as Rotom-S, Scyther, Jumpluff, Swellow, Cacturne, and Torterra, while still netting coverage against Gourgeist. Signal Beam is another coverage option that mainly targets Malamar, but also OHKOes Shiftry and Cacturne unlike Ice Beam which cannot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment and a Modest nature allows Claydol to make the most of its coverage options. Alternatively, a Timid nature can be used to outspeed neutral natured Hitmonchan, Magmortar, and Shiftry. Colbur Berry gives Claydol a spinning opportunity against Fighting-types and occasionally even Dark-types by weakening Knock Offs or Sucker Punches, which might deny the Rapid Spin. Soft Sand is another option which increases the power of Claydol's Earth Power, notably allowing it to OHKO offensive variants of Garbodor and 2HKO at worst all Rhydon variants.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Should there be entry hazards on its side of the field, Claydol's biggest priority is to spin them away. Despite its resilience to entry hazards and decent bulk, one should not play recklessly with Claydol, as its numerous weaknesses render it vulnerable to a wide variety of foes. Claydol is best sent in on foes that it can force out, or on passive foes that cannot hurt it very much. Slower Ground-weak Pokemon, namely Rock-, Poison-, and Steel-types such as Rhydon, Regirock, Carracosta, Garbodor, Stunfisk, and Mawile, usually present the best opportunity for Claydol to enter battle and use Rapid Spin by threatening them out with its Ground-type STAB move, but Claydol's wide movepool and decent bulk allow it to choose a greater selection of foes to use Rapid Spin on or threaten out, such as Aurorus, Lanturn, and even Torterra if Ice Beam is used.</p> <p>Claydol can also find the chance to spin against slower passive walls such as Audino, Weezing, and Regirock. Against more offensive teams, Claydol relies more on its resistances than its overall bulk to find spinning opportunities. Claydol can even be used as an anti-lead against entry hazard leads such as Archeops and Crustle, shrugging off most of their attacks and continuously spinning their entry hazards away. Keep an eye out for spinblockers; while Claydol can hit them on the switch with Shadow Ball, it will be forced back out by the threat of their Ghost STAB moves. Also remember that Claydol's offenses aren't great, so it shouldn't try to tackle attackers that aren't weak to its moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that suffer from major entry hazard weaknesses greatly appreciate Claydol as a partner. Scyther is one of the most notable partners, as its effectiveness is greatly improved in the absence of Stealth Rock; it even boasts good offensive synergy with Claydol as most bulky Pokemon that resist U-turn can be threatened by Claydol. Other partners include Pyroar, Rotom-S, Archeops, and Focus Sash Jynx, which all boast powerful offensive presence to compensate for Claydol's lack of immediate power. Claydol also appreciates a Pursuit trapper to take on the Ghost-types that would impede it. Liepard is a fine candidate for a Pursuit trapper, and it has the important Prankster Encore to deter foes from taking advantage of Claydol's passiveness, particularly the likes of Shell Smash Huntail and Quiver Dance Lilligant.</p>"

  "Cradily": {
    "overview": "<p>Excellent mixed defensive stats combined with access to Stealth Rock, Recover, and Storm Drain can make Cradily the perfect fit on defensive teams that need a reliable Stealth Rock setter and Scald switch-in. Its unique defensive typing lets it handle many Water-, Electric-, and Normal-types well, such as Ludicolo, Lanturn, and Swellow, while also giving it a good matchup against many entry hazard removers, such as Mantine, Xatu, and Kabutops, and special attackers in general, such as Pyroar and Vivillon. This makes Cradily a fantastic bulky pivot in general thanks to the number of threats it checks at once, and it is suitable both as a member of a defensive core on stall teams and as the glue that holds a more offensive team together. However, its average attacking stats and low-powered STAB attacks make Cradily quite easy to switch into or set up on, especially for bulky foes such as Weezing and Malamar. Furthermore, Cradily's low Speed stat and numerous weaknesses to common attacking types mean that it's easily forced out in the early-game. As a result, Cradily's passive nature ensures that it requires good defensive synergy with its teammates to be effective and not present too many opportunities for the opponent to capitalize on its weaknesses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physically defensive set with a Rocky Helmet can be used to improve Cradily's matchup against physical Normal-types such as Kangaskhan, Tauros, and Guts Swellow, as well as certain physical Water-types such as Kabutops and Barbaracle, but this is generally not as useful, as common Pokemon such as Primeape and Steelix can still break through it easily. Weakness Policy on the standard specially defensive set allows Cradily to take advantage of non-STAB super effective coverage moves such as Swellow's U-turn, Lanturn's Ice Beam, and Lilligant's Hidden Power Ice and strike back hard with a powerful STAB attack. Earth Power or Earthquake can be used on this set to hit threats such as Steelix, Skuntank, and Garbodor for more damage. However, the lack of passive recovery from Leftovers for this set makes it less consistent in general, and its utility is diminished if Cradily switches out after the item is activated. An offensive set with Swords Dance and Recover can turn Cradily into an unusual sweeper, making use of Cradily's surprisingly good STAB coverage, its ability to set up easily on weak Pokemon, and its ability to break through Quagsire. Alternatively, Rock Polish can be run with Weakness Policy and three attacks or Swords Dance to secure an endgame sweep, but forgoing Recover or a Ground-type attack leaves Cradily with lacking longevity and coverage, respectively. Mirror Coat is a niche option that can help Cradily lure in and KO certain attackers, but it can often deal with most of Mirror Coat's targets, such as Samurott and Abomasnow, by using Giga Drain or Rock Slide. Ancient Power and Hidden Power Rock are alternative special Rock-type attacks that gain a boost from Storm Drain, but they generally shouldn't be used because physical Rock-type attacks are more consistently useful against most targets, especially Cryogonal and Assault Vest Magmortar. Rock Tomb can also be used for higher accuracy and the ability to lower the foe's Speed for a teammate to take advantage of, but Cradily is usually too slow to make use of the Speed drop itself.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers with Super Effective Moves</strong>: If Cradily does not invest in its Defense stat, powerful physical attackers can easily take advantage of its many type weaknesses. Choice Band Primeape, Choice Band Scyther, and Steelix can break past Recover with ease. Likewise, Choice Specs Aurorus can easily break past even fully invested Cradily with its strong Ice-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Due to Cradily's low Speed and attacking power, setup sweepers can easily take advantage of it if it lacks Toxic, and many can deal with it even if it does carry the move, such as Malamar and Heal Bell Musharna.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Cradily relies on Recover to stay healthy throughout the match, Toxic to cripple bulky Pokemon, and Stealth Rock to support its teammates. Therefore, Taunt users such as Mismagius and Skuntank can completely lock Cradily down due to its low Speed, making it very easy for a threatening teammate to switch into it due to its mediocre attacking power.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Cradily struggles to do much damage against defensive threats that aren't weak to its attacks, with Vileplume, Weezing, and Ferroseed being particularly strong counters due to their immunity to Toxic and ability to punish Cradily's passive nature with their support moves.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock allows Cradily to provide entry hazard support for its teammates and punish the opponent for switching in dangerous wallbreakers such as Magmortar and Aurorus that usually threaten defensive teams. Stealth Rock also breaks Focus Sashes and Sturdy, which is useful for helping a cleaner secure KOs in the late-game. Recover is Cradily's main niche over other Stealth Rock setters, allowing it to stay healthy throughout the match with much more PP than Moonlight or Morning Sun and no weather dependence, preventing it from being worn down by weaker attackers. Giga Drain is a reliable STAB attack that provides extra recovery and has great synergy with Storm Drain, both by gaining considerable power after the boost and by directly threatening the Water-types that Cradily switches into, such as Lanturn and Kabutops. Rock Slide is another STAB attack that improves Cradily's matchup against many Pokemon it checks well, such as Swellow, Pyroar, and Xatu. While Stone Edge can be used for its higher power, its low PP and accuracy are unappealing for a defensive Pokemon like Cradily. Toxic is also a good option, as it makes Cradily less passive against bulky Pokemon in general, such as Assault Vest Hariyama and Calm Mind Mega Audino, and Cradily can Toxic-stall foes quite effectively through the use of Recover.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment makes Cradily as specially bulky as possible and significantly improves its matchup against most of the threats it checks best, such as Swellow, Pyroar, and Vivillon. It also lets Cradily take Ice Beams from specially offensive Water-types, such as Samurott, offensive Lanturn, and Floatzel, much more comfortably in a pinch. A Sassy nature should be used alongside Rock Slide to avoid lowering Cradily's Attack stat, but a Calm nature is fine if Toxic is used instead. Likewise, a Careful nature should be used if Toxic is used over Giga Drain, which is also viable if your team already carries a strong Grass-type such as Lilligant. Storm Drain is one of the main reasons to use Cradily, providing an immunity to Scald and all other Water-type moves while also boosting Giga Drain's power if Cradily absorbs a Water-type move. Storm Drain vastly increases the number of Pokemon that Cradily can check or counter, improving its role compression on defensive teams and its versatility as a pivot on balanced and offensive teams. Leftovers gives Cradily some passive recovery, making it even harder to take down and letting it Toxic-stall foes more easily by reducing the number of attacks that can reliably 2HKO it and break past Recover spam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cradily makes for a decent lead for defensive teams and can set Stealth Rock early on in the match if the opponent does not lead with a strong Fighting- or Ice-type attacker, such as Hariyama, Combusken, or Aurorus. Through its use of Recover to keep its health high, Cradily can also come in throughout the match and set up Stealth Rock multiple times if the entry hazard is removed by Rapid Spin or Defog. Thanks to its good recovery options and many resistances, Cradily makes a good mid-game pivot into many special attackers, as well as certain physical attackers, such as Kangaskhan, Kabutops, and Barbaracle without Fighting-type coverage, because of its above-average uninvested Defense stat. Likewise, Cradily can also spread Toxic effectively throughout the match thanks to the switches that it forces so that its teammates can stall out the opponent's offensive Pokemon or stallbreakers such as Mismagius more easily. However, Cradily should be wary of potentially switching into certain coverage moves, such as Samurott's Megahorn. Cradily is highly susceptible to Toxic poison and should be careful about switching into foes that are likely to use the move, such as Mantine and Quagsire, unless there is little opportunity cost in switching to a Heal Bell or Aromatherapy user later, such as Lanturn or Mega Audino. Similarly, Cradily should not switch into Toxic Spikes before it is removed by a teammate. Immunity to Sleep Powder also makes Cradily a decent pivot into certain setup sweepers, such as Lilligant and Vivillon. However, it struggles to KO them without Toxic and Rock Slide, respectively, and it can't stop them if they already have a few boosts.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cradily appreciates teammates that can switch into Pokemon that threaten it, namely strong Bug-, Ice-, Fighting-, and Steel-type attackers. Musharna and Weezing are good responses to Fighting-types such as Primeape and Hitmonchan, while Fire-types such as Magmortar, Pyroar, and Combusken are good at dealing with the others on more balanced and offensive team builds. These Fire-types also highly appreciate Cradily's immunity to Water-type attacks. Lanturn, Piloswine, and Assault Vest Hariyama can also deal well with most Ice- and Steel-types. Grounded Poison-types, such as Skuntank and Garbodor, are highly useful teammates on both balanced and defensive teams thanks to their ability to absorb Toxic Spikes, which completely cripples Cradily and many of its common teammates. Heal Bell users, such as Lanturn and Musharna, are similarly good partners for Cradily thanks to their ability to remove Toxic poison and burns. Bulky setup sweepers, particularly Malamar, Musharna, and Mega Audino, can easily take advantage of Cradily that lack Toxic, so teammates that can deal with setup sweepers in general, such as Curse Quagsire and Haze Altaria, are highly appreciated.</p>"

  "Kecleon": {
    "overview": "<p>Kecleon holds its place in the NU tier as a niche wallbreaker thanks to its spectacular coverage and movepool, along with its ability, Protean. These traits allow it to break past many common Normal-type checks, making Kecleon a great addition to Normal spam archetypes. Kecleon also sports the fourth strongest Sucker Punch in NU, which lets it deal with fast offensive Pokemon such as Manectric. However, Kecleon's abysmal Speed requires it to invest heavily in the stat simply to outspeed walls and forces it to rely on an only partially invested Sucker Punch to damage anything faster, making it nearly useless against faster teams. Kecleon also has subpar bulk, which makes opportunities to switch Kecleon in extremely rare, as even moderately powerful neutral attacks will leave a dent in it. While physical sets are more common in general due to Kecleon's large physical movepool, a mixed attacker is generally more effective due to the tier's plethora of physically defensive Pokemon, such as Steelix, Vileplume, and Gastrodon, that are vulnerable to special coverage moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Assault Vest and Power-Up Punch set with Knock Off, Sucker Punch, and Drain Punch is able to turn Kecleon into a bulky sweeper; this set also provides a good pivot into the likes of Magmortar and specially based Charizard, but most physically defensive Pokemon are able to handle this set with relative ease, such as Garbodor, Weezing, and Vileplume. Another possible set would be a Life Orb set with Fake Out, Drain Punch, Shadow Sneak, and Sucker Punch, which is difficult for offensive teams to deal with. However, physically bulky Pokemon, such as Vileplume and Pelipper, can wall Kecleon; even Steelix and Rhydon can wall it despite Drain Punch being super effective. A Facade set is able to take advantage of burn and paralysis, both of which are commonly inflicted upon Kecleon, in order to give Kecleon a 140 Base Power attack that is able to dent many Pokemon. Kecleon's priority has the ability to threaten a variety of Pokemon out, allowing it to use Substitute on predicted switches. This allows it to avoid being revenge killed easily and can help prevent it from being hit with status. Kecleon has a colorful movepool but the coverage isn't usually worth it, since it doesn't provide much more than the main set. Thunder Punch and Rock Slide are the two most notable ones, being able to hit Pelipper and Charizard, respectively. Kecleon also has a decent support movepool with moves like Recover and Magic Coat, although Kecleon's low Speed and type changing can be easily exploited when not attacking, exposing it to Fighting- and Dark-type coverage respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Physical Pokemon such as Tauros, Hitmonchan, Malamar, and Zangoose can outspeed Kecleon and are able to take advantage of Kecleon's flawed Defense stat. Kecleon is also scared of faster priority moves such Sucker Punch, Ice Shard, and Fake Out, which can be seen on a multitude of Pokemon, such as Skuntank, Kangaskhan, and Abomasnow. Hitmonchan, Skuntank, Shiftry, and physical Combusken have an easier time against Kecleon, as they do not fear Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Hariyama, Musharna, Mantine, and Pelipper are all able to pivot in on Kecleon and force it to take Life Orb damage while they proceed to OHKO it or heal up and then KO Kecleon due to their good natural bulk. Musharna is able to take advantage of Kecleon that lack Knock Off by freely setting up Calm Mind and shrugging off the damage it takes with Moonlight, while Barrier variants are also able to beat Kecleon one-on-one. Mantine and Pelipper are able to come in on anything but Knock Off, and they can scare out Kecleon with the prospect of Scald burns, halving its Attack, and wearing it down extremely quickly. Bulky Charizard only fears the occasional Rock Slide, can Roost off damage from all of Kecleon's attacks, and can proceed to burn Kecleon with Will-O-Wisp or attack with a fast Acrobatics.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sucker Punch is a very strong priority move that aids Kecleon in deterring faster, frailer Pokemon that might attempt to revenge kill it, and is a decent primary attack most of the time. Fire Blast is Kecleon's strongest coverage move, allowing it to OHKO many defensive Pokemon, such as Steelix, Gourgeist, and Vileplume after Stealth Rock damage, and 2HKO bulky Poison-types like Garbodor and Weezing. Grass Knot allows Kecleon to beat Gastrodon, Quagsire, Regirock, and Rhydon while also ensuring that Omastar and Barbaracle are not able to set up on it. Knock Off is a more reliable and spammable primary move providing Kecleon with the excellent utility of removing items such as Eviolite and Leftovers. It also hits Musharna and Lanturn hard, both of which might otherwise attempt to pivot into some of Kecleon's other attacks. Iron Tail is Kecleon's best alternate coverage move, allowing it to break past Mega Audino and Clefairy while also giving Kecleon a Steel typing, which has temporary defensive benefits. Stealth Rock is a great utility move that Kecleon can easily make use of due to the fact that it forces so many switches thanks to its power and coverage. Shadow Sneak is a priority move that allows Kecleon to act as a last ditch spinblocker, though Kecleon is unable to switch into Rapid Spin.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>116 Speed EVs allow Kecleon to outspeed Gourgeist-XL and not get burned by Will-O-Wisp before attacking with Fire Blast. 200 Special Attack EVs with a Life Orb and a Mild nature is enough to let Kecleon OHKO some switch-ins, such as Gourgeist-XL, Steelix, and Vileplume, with Fire Blast after Stealth Rock damage. The remaining 192 EVs are dumped into Attack, powering up Kecleon's physical moves and allowing Sucker Punch to have a 75% chance to OHKO Swellow after Stealth Rock damage, as well as a good chance to 2HKO Mega Audino with Iron Tail.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kecleon is decently powerful and able to break down common defensive cores with its range of physical and special attacks. Kecleon can take advantage of the fact that fully physical sets are quite common, allowing it to lure its targets more easily. Due to its low Speed, Kecleon will mostly be using Sucker Punch to dole out damage to offensive teams. When facing balanced, slower teams, Kecleon needn't rely on Sucker Punch as heavily, as these balance teams tend to carry slower Pokemon such as Mega Audino, Gourgeist, and Vileplume, all of which are outsped and dealt with by Kecleon. Kecleon can utilize Protean's ability to effectively create mind games, such as using Dark-type attacks on Psychic-type Pokemon in order to evade their STAB moves and clicking Fire Blast on Gourgeist-XL to avoid being burnt by Will-O-Wisp. Kecleon's physical frailty means that it should only be switched in on weaker special attacks, pivoted in via a slow Volt Switch or U-turn, or brought in on a double switch. Kecleon's reliance on priority to hit anything faster means fast status users, such as Rotom and Mismagius, are able to avoid Sucker Punch and cripple Kecleon with Will-O-Wisp, so try and hit these with Knock Off as they switch in if possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate defensive staples such as Audino and Steelix being severely weakened by Kecleon's various coverage options, such as Tauros, Archeops, Kangaskhan, and Swellow, make for good partners. Pokemon with access to speed control are also viable partners, as they are able to mitigate Kecleon's horrendous Speed stat, allowing Kecleon to fare much better against offensive teams, albeit only for a few turns. Slow VoltTurn users are also great options to get Kecleon into battle, as they can bring Kecleon in after the opponent attacks so that Kecleon does not take damage; some Pokemon that can do this well are Pelipper and Lanturn. Hazard-stacking cores such as Garbodor + Steelix make for excellent partners because of the extra damage accumulated by the entry hazards they set, helping Kecleon assure KOs on certain targets such as Vileplume and Steelix. Omastar also makes for a great partner, as it has access to three entry hazards, and checks common threats to Kecleon, such as Archeops, Kangaskhan, physical Charizard, and Tauros. Mesprit and Audino are able to significantly slow down threats with Thunder Wave, and the former is able to support Kecleon with Healing Wish, should Kecleon acquire too much Life Orb recoil, and Stealth Rock so Kecleon can nab the KO on Vileplume, Steelix, and Swellow after Stealth Rock damage.</p>"

  "Gorebyss": {
    "overview": "<p>Gorebyss has a great boosting move in Shell Smash, an impressive base 114 Special Attack, and a great offensive movepool with Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, and Signal Beam, which make it a threatening sweeper. Gorebyss also has access to Swift Swim, making it really dangerous in rain. Due to its low Speed stat, however, Gorebyss fails to outspeed Choice Scarf Rotom and Rotom-S even at +2, making it vulnerable to being revenge killed, and has a hard time setting up against various Pokemon. Gorebyss also lacks special bulk, making it hard to set up against powerful special attackers such as Rotom, Lilligant, and Ludicolo.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Surf can be used instead of Hydro Pump or Scald for more power than Scald and more reliability than Hydro Pump. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Ferroseed, and Hidden Power Electric can be used to hit Mantine. White Herb can be used over Life Orb in the first set to increase Gorebyss's longevity and make it less prone to being revenge killed, but reduces the power of Gorebyss's attacks. Focus Sash can be used over Life Orb to guarantee a set up, but decreases Gorebyss's attack prowess as well. Hydration can be used instead of Swift Swim on rain teams to prevent Gorebyss from being inflicted by any status ailments. Psychic can be used alongside Signal Beam to hit Vileplume, Roselia, and Poliwrath.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Rotom, Lilligant, and Jynx outspeed Gorebyss even at +2 and can OHKO Gorebyss with a powerful super effective attack.</p> <p><strong>Liepard</strong>: Liepard's Prankster Encore allows it to lock Gorebyss into Shell Smash, meaning it can turn Shell Smash against Gorebyss entirely, although Liepard is OHKOed by Hydro Pump. Liepard also has access to Sucker Punch, which can KO a weakened Gorebyss.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Powerful attackers such as Mismagius, Primeape, Pyroar, Samurott, Tauros, and Zangoose have little trouble 2HKOing Gorebyss, making it very difficult for Gorebyss to set up Shell Smash safely.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Priority moves such as Kangaskhan's Fake Out + Sucker Punch, Cacturne's Sucker Punch, and Zangoose's Quick Attack damage Gorebyss heavily after a Shell Smash, limiting its sweeping capabilities. Priority attacks from Kabutops and Assault Vest Hitmonchan won't deal as much damage, however.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Ludicolo can survive most hits from Gorebyss at +2 and KO it with Giga Drain, but loses to Signal Beam. Lanturn resists Gorebyss's STAB moves and can cripple it with Thunder Wave or heavily damage it with Volt Switch, although it must be wary of Hidden Power Grass. Poliwrath is immune to Gorebyss's STAB moves and resists most of Gorebyss's coverage moves and can retaliate with either Focus Blast or Circle Throw. Mantine is immune to Gorebyss's STAB moves, takes little from its coverage moves, and can damage Gorebyss with Air Slash or cripple it with Toxic. In addition, Mantine can remove Gorebyss's boosts with Haze.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash boosts Gorebyss's Special Attack and Speed by two stages, at the cost of lowering its defenses. Hydro Pump hits really hard after a Shell Smash boost. Alternatively, the more reliable, yet weaker Scald can be used, which has a 30 percent chance to burn the foe. Ice Beam lets Gorebyss deal with Grass-types such as Vileplume, Gourgeist, and Roselia, which otherwise wall it. Signal Beam is used to KO common switch-ins such as Ludicolo, Lilligant, and Jynx as well as Malamar. Hidden Power Grass lets Gorebyss deal with Water-types such as Lanturn, Gastrodon, and Prinplup.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment enhances Gorebyss's power and Speed in order to allow it to sweep the opposing team. Life Orb is used to increase Gorebyss's damage output at the cost of HP with each attack. A Modest nature is used to maximize Gorebyss's Special Attack. However, a Timid nature can also be used to further increase its Speed, which makes Gorebyss outspeed Jolly Cacturne, Exeggutor, and Aurorus before a Shell Smash boost, and Jolly Choice Scarf Pinsir and Timid Choice Scarf Mesprit after a Shell Smash boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Gorebyss's low Speed, it cannot set up a Shell Smash on most Taunt users, such as Archeops and Mismagius. However, once Gorebyss gets to +2, it outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame and certain Choice Scarf users, though it still fails to outspeed Choice Scarf Rotom, Lilligant, and Rotom-S. Gorebyss should use slow defensive Pokemon such as Rhydon, Carracosta, Gourgeist, and Weezing, as well as Choice-locked Fire-types such as Pyroar, as setup bait by forcing them to switch out. Gorebyss's decent physical bulk and good defensive typing allow it to set up on various offensive Pokemon, although it should not set up on specially offensive Pokemon, as it lacks special bulk. Gorebyss should be used as a late-game cleaner; when the opponent's team is weakened, Gorebyss can set up easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gorebyss appreciates Pokemon that can take Grass- and Electric-type attacks aimed at it, such as Magmortar and Rhydon, respectively. Memento support from Skuntank or Jumpluff makes it easier for Gorebyss to set up a Shell Smash. Mesprit, Liepard, and other Rain Dance users can aid Gorebyss by triggering Swift Swim. Liepard can use Encore and then U-turn to Gorebyss, giving it an easier time to set up and sweep.</p>"

  "Relicanth": {
    "overview": "<p>Relicanth separates itself from other physical Rock-types in the tier with access to the combination of Rock Head and Head Smash, which amplifies its wallbreaking prowess to exceptional levels. Furthermore, Relicanth has excellent coverage in NU between its STAB and coverage moves to hit almost all of the relevant Pokemon for at least neutral damage. Similarly to other Rock-types, Relicanth has outstanding physical bulk, which, when combined with its Rock typing, allows it to offensively check various threats such as Tauros, Scyther, and Kangaskhan. Unfortunately, Relicanth is weak to common attacking types such as Grass and Fighting from the likes of Lilligant and Hariyama. It also faces competition from other Water- and Rock-types such as Samurott, Omastar, and Barbaracle, all of which are either more versatile or simply faster. A very mediocre Speed stat is a significant hindrance for Relicanth as well, given that it is outsped by nearly all offensive Pokemon and a handful of defensive Pokemon. Contrary to its great physical bulk, Relicanth's Special Defense is rather lacking, meaning that even some resisted hits such as Swellow's Boomburst will deal significant damage. Lastly, most of Relicanth's moves outside of Head Smash are of relatively average Base Power, which can hurt its consistency.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Polish can be used to act as a standalone sweeper; Rhydon generally performs such a role better, but Relicanth's higher base Speed and different secondary STAB move set it apart. A more defensively-inclined set utilizing moves such as Stealth Rock, Scald, Toxic, and Head Smash may seem appealing but is mainly outclassed by Carracosta and Omastar due to their access to Solid Rock and more entry hazards, respectively. A set with Rain Dance can be used on full rain teams due to the fact that Relicanth provides Stealth Rock alongside said Rain Dance and benefits from the rain itself too. Sleep Talk allows Relicanth to soft check non-Focus Blast Jynx.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Poliwrath and Hitmonchan resist Relicanth's main STAB move, Head Smash, and force it out with a super effective attack, but the latter takes a significant amount of damage from Waterfall, while Poliwrath is 2HKOed by Zen Headbutt.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: While they take massive damage from Head Smash, Grass-types such as Lilligant, Abomasnow, and Shiftry resist Waterfall and easily force out Relicanth with their STAB moves. Defensive Grass-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Vileplume are still 2HKOed by Head Smash, but unlike the previously mentioned Pokemon, they can survive one hit and retaliate.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Steelix and Ferroseed punish Relicanth for using Head Smash, each in their own way. Steelix takes very negligible damage due to its 4x resistance to Rock but must be wary of switching into Waterfall. Ferroseed has absolutely nothing to fear from Relicanth, as it resists both of Relicanth's STAB moves and Relicanth has no coverage moves to hit it with. Ferroseed also punishes Relicanth for using any move other than Earthquake with Iron Barbs recoil.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Rhydon, Torterra, and Quagsire all resist Head Smash, and the latter two take minimal damage from Waterfall. All of these Pokemon can threaten out Relicanth with a super effective STAB move, and Rhydon and Torterra can use Relicanth locked into Head Smash as setup fodder for a Rock Polish while Quagsire can use Relicanth as Curse fodder no matter what move it chooses.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Head Smash is an absurdly powerful Rock-type attack that deals massive damage to anything that does not resist it, even 2HKOing extremely bulky Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL and Mega Audino. Even some less physically bulky Pokemon that resist it such as Hariyama take heavy damage from this move. Waterfall hits Ground-types such as Steelix and Rhydon and doubles as a fully accurate STAB move, which can be useful given Head Smash's unreliable accuracy. Earthquake hits Klinklang and Garbodor, notably avoiding Rocky Helmet and Aftermath damage from the latter. Zen Headbutt strikes down Poliwrath, which otherwise walls this set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band amplifies Relicanth's power to significantly high levels. Rock Head eliminates the recoil that Head Smash would normally entail. Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature is used to hit as hard as possible, and maximum Speed investment is used to outspeed as many defensive Pokemon as possible, as well as Jolly Rhydon and everything below.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Relicanth can pivot into Normal- and Flying-type attacks such as Kangaskhan's Double-Edge and Scyther's Aerial Ace in order to get itself in safely for a free attack. In most cases, using Head Smash early- or mid-game is the best course of action, but if your opponent has a physically bulky Pokemon that resists it such as Steelix, Rhydon, Quagsire, or Poliwrath, it is best to hit it on the switch with the appropriate coverage move or use the opportunity to bring in a teammate that threatens it. On the off chance you end up using a move other than Head Smash, be wary of locking Relicanth into a move such as Earthquake or Zen Headbutt, as it can give free setup opportunities to the likes of Vivillon and Shiftry, depending on which move is chosen. Due to its high physical bulk, Relicanth can act as an emergency check to certain sweepers such as Swords Dance Samurott and Rock Polish Rhydon, provided it has not set up a Swords Dance as well, if it is near full HP and OHKO them in return with the appropriate STAB move. Be wary of using Head Smash too often, as its low PP can run out quickly due to a potential miss or being used against a Protect user such as Mega Audino.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Checks to Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mesprit, Rotom, and Scyther make for good teammates. In addition, all of these Pokemon can use their respective momentum-grabbing moves to get Relicanth in unscathed. Grass-type checks such as Magmortar, Charizard, and Sliggoo also pair well with Relicanth to handle the likes of Lilligant and Ferroseed. Furthermore, these Pokemon directly threaten bulky Rock-resistant Pokemon such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Torterra with a STAB or coverage move. Fast late-game cleaners such as Swellow benefit from Relicanth's wallbreaking ability. Swellow in particular greatly appreciates Relicanth weakening or eliminating specially bulky Pokemon and bulky Pokemon that resist Normal-type attacks such as Hariyama and Rhydon, respectively. Thunder Wave support from the likes of Xatu and Mega Audino helps remediate Relicanth's low Speed.</p>"

  "Regirock": {
    "overview": "<p>Incredible mixed bulk alongside its Rock typing means Regirock can serve as a premier Normal-, Flying-, and Fire-type check. Regirock also has access to an expansive support movepool with status options such as Thunder Wave and Toxic, which make it very difficult for offensive Pokemon to set up on it; entry hazards in Stealth Rock; and even weather moves in Sunny Day. From a defensive standpoint, mono-Rock typing allows Regirock to serve as a more reliable check to Fire-and Normal-types such as Pyroar and Tauros than Pokemon such as Rhydon, as common Water and Grass coverage moves are only 2x super effective rather than 4x. Unfortunately, Regirock relies solely on Leftovers for recovery, making it very vulnerable to getting worn down throughout a battle. Regirock also faces competition from Rhydon and Steelix, as both are similarly capable Stealth Rock setters, also provide solid Normal and Flying resistances, and have other niches, such as Steelix checking Psychic-types and Rhydon having a potent dual STAB combination and higher Attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Although it's illegal with Sturdy, if one opts to use Clear Body instead, Regirock can make solid use of Counter. With the highest Defense stat in the NU tier, Regirock can survive any unboosted physical attack with ease such as Shiftry's Leaf Blade, Primeape's Close Combat, or Samurott's Waterfall and strike back to KO the foe. Drain Punch can be used to hit Steel- and Rock-types super effectively and give Regirock another form of recovery, but it is usually outclassed by Earthquake, which is stronger and nails Poison-types such as Garbodor super effectively. Protect can be used to help keep Regirock healthy throughout a battle with Leftovers recovery, but the ability to hit Poison-, Steel-, and Rock-types super effectively is usually more useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Poliwrath, Prinplup, and Gastrodon only fear Toxic from Regirock and can all threaten it out with their STAB attacks, set up on it, or even remove its Stealth Rock with Defog in Prinplup's case. Offensive Water-types such as Floatzel, Barbaracle, and Samurott also check Regirock, but these Pokemon are crippled by Thunder Wave and thus are not safe switch-ins.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-type Pokemon such as Vileplume, Ferroseed, and Torterra almost completely wall Regirock and can do big damage to it with their STAB attacks or even set up entry hazards on it. Offensive Grass-types such as Lilligant and Shiftry also check Regirock well, but they are not safe switch-ins, as they are crippled by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-type Pokemon such as Rhydon, Steelix, Piloswine, Golurk, and Claydol all give Regirock issues, as they can either set up on it or smack it for massive damage with a super effective STAB Earthquakes while only fearing Toxic in return. Claydol in particular can also spin away Regirock's Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Status Absorbers</strong>: Pokemon such as Malamar and Mega Audino that don't mind status due to Rest and take little damage from Stone Edge are very threatening, as they have no problem using Regirock as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon that commonly run Taunt such as Weezing and Misdreavus prevent Regirock from spreading status and setting up Stealth Rock and Sunny Day, and they can burn Regirock with Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

      "Mixed Defensive Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is a terrific entry hazard, and due to Regirock's excellent bulk, it is one of the more consistent setters of it in the tier. Stone Edge is Regirock's most powerful STAB attack, allowing it to do the most damage possible to the Flying-, Fire-, and Normal-types it is meant to check. Alternatively, Rock Slide has higher accuracy and terrific synergy with Thunder Wave, as the two in conjunction create a paraflinch combination to wear opposing Pokemon down. Thunder Wave prevents offensive Pokemon such as Lilligant, Shiftry, and Klinklang from setting up on Regirock and has generally great utility in slowing down threats throughout a battle. Earthquake allows Regirock to hit opposing Poison-, Steel-, and Rock-types such as Garbodor, Klinklang, and Rhydon super effectively. Toxic can be used over Earthquake, as Pokemon that don't necessarily mind getting paralyzed, such as Mega Audino, Musharna, and Gourgeist, despise being inflicted with Toxic. Finally, Seismic Toss is a decent option which lets Regirock deal consistent damage to bulkier targets such as Steelix, Weezing, Ferroseed, and Piloswine.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and 56 Special Defense EVs allow Regirock to avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Pyroar's Hidden Power Grass after Stealth Rock. Similarly, 16 Defense EVs with an Impish nature let Regirock avoid a 2HKO from Life Orb Tauros's Iron Tail while also hitting a jump point. The rest of the available EVs are poured into Attack to allow Regirock to hit as hard as possible. Leftovers maximizes Regirock's survivability by granting it passive recovery. Chople Berry can also be used on teams that need extra insurance versus Fighting-types such as Primeape and Hitmonchan, as the item allows Regirock to survive even a Choice Band-boosted Close Combat from the two with ease and retaliate with a status move. Another option for Regirock is Custap Berry, which can net it some surprise KOs with Stone Edge or even let it get off a surprise Thunder Wave when under 25% HP. The item has excellent synergy with Sturdy and is fairly reliable, as Regirock gets worn down easily throughout a battle. Clear Body is the optimal ability for Regirock, as it allows it to block Memento from Skuntank and Mismagius, bypass Intimidates from Mawile, and avoid Special Defense drops from common attacks such as Shadow Ball and Psychic. Sturdy is also an option over Clear Body, as it allows Regirock to survive any attack from full HP. This can be especially useful when leading with Regirock, as it allows it to take attacks such as Samurott's Hydro Pump and Shiftry's Leaf Storm and proceed to either set up Stealth Rock or cripple the foe with status.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Regirock should be used as a defensive tank that can switch into common Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Tauros, Pyroar, Magmortar, Archeops, and Swellow and force them to switch out in fear of status or being KOed by STAB Stone Edge. Although Regirock does check all of these Pokemon individually, it will struggle to check several of them in the same battle due to its lack of reliable recovery, so only switch Regirock into these Pokemon when necessary. Beware of status coming from Pokemon Regirock can usually switch into, such as Will-O-Wisp from Pyroar and Charizard. If using Custap Berry, Regirock can trigger it by switching into entry hazards to get a surprise revenge kill. Once its HP is below 25%, saving Regirock for the late-game to get off a priority Thunder Wave is usually optimal. Do not blindly spam status moves; if the opponent has Pokemon such as Claydol or Steelix that is unaffected by Thunder Wave or Toxic, it is better to double switch into a teammate that can take advantage of these Pokemon and gain momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-types such as Vileplume, Lilligant, and Ferroseed have excellent synergy with Regirock, as they resist the common Water- and Grass-type attacks often aimed at Regirock, while in turn, Regirock resists the Fire- and Flying-type attacks that threaten them. Regirock relies solely on Leftovers to stay healthy throughout a battle, so Wish passers such as Mega Audino make for great partners. Regirock can also easily switch in on Poison-types that threaten Mega Audino such as Garbodor and Skuntank. Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Mesprit, Xatu, and Rotom can help deal with the Fighting-types that threaten Regirock. Regirock is a very reliable status spreader, so slower Pokemon that appreciate Thunder Wave support such as Abomasnow, Kabutops, and Samurott work well with Regirock. These Pokemon in particular can all break through Steelix and Rhydon with ease, which otherwise give Regirock trouble.</p>"
      },
      "Sunny Day Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is a great entry hazard, and Regirock is a solid setter, as Sturdy combined with impressive mixed bulk makes it very reliable. Sunny Day in conjunction with Heat Rock provides the team with eight turns of sun to utilize. Explosion is an incredibly powerful attack that hits everything but Ghost-types hard and can help get in sun sweepers safely after Regirock has set up Sunny Day. Stone Edge is a hard-hitting STAB move that allows Regirock to do damage without having to KO itself with Explosion.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Attack investment allows Regirock to hit as hard and be as bulky as possible. Heat Rock is necessary for this set to maximize the number of sun turns for the rest of the team. Sturdy essentially guarantees Regirock the ability to either set up Stealth Rock or Sunny Day at the start of a battle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Regirock set is best used as a lead, as the ability to reliably set up Stealth Rock and Sunny Day at the beginning of a battle is hugely important for sun teams. If the opponent leads with a Pokemon that outspeeds and can 2HKO Regirock such as Samurott, Lilligant, or Primeape, it is likely you will have to choose between setting up Sunny Day and setting up Stealth Rock. In this situation, evaluate the opposing team, and if they are particularly weak to your sun sweepers, immediately set up Sunny Day. Conversely, if the opposing team is very weak to Stealth Rock or has too many checks and counters to your sun sweepers, it is to your benefit to set up Stealth Rock early and get your sun going in the following turns. Explosion can be used to provide a sun sweeper such as Victreebel or Exeggutor with a free switch in to start wreaking havoc or as a powerful last-ditch effort to remove an opposing Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sun sweepers such as Victreebel, Exeggutor, Shiftry, Lilligant, and Vileplume all make for excellent partners alongside Regirock, as they can take full advantage of the sun that Regirock sets up and often just run through teams. Fire-types such as Magmortar, Pyroar, Combusken, and Charizard also greatly appreciate the sun that Regirock sets up, as it not only powers up their main STAB move by 1.5x but also cuts the damage of super effective Water-type attacks in half. Liepard is almost always seen with this Regirock set, as once the sun set by Regirock has faded, Liepard can reliably set up eight more turns with Prankster Sunny Day. Lastly, a grounded Poison-type such as Victreebel or Vileplume is almost required, as it can absorb the Toxic Spikes that plague not only Regirock but also its other sun sweeping teammates such as Lilligant and Exeggutor.</p>"

  "Regice": {
    "overview": "<p>Regice's extreme bulk makes it a good general response to special attackers that can't hit it super effectively, such as Samurott, Swellow, and Floatzel. Its pure Ice typing, while giving it weaknesses to key attacking types such as Fire, Fighting, and Rock, also makes it one of the best switch-ins to Ice-type attacks from dangerous wallbreakers such as Aurorus and Abomasnow, as it's not bothered by Freeze-Dry, unlike most Water-types. While Regice is mostly outclassed by these two as an offensive Ice-type, its much better defensive stats and relative lack of crippling weaknesses make it more effective as a bulky pivot that can both throw out powerful Ice Beams and cripple incoming responses with Thunder Wave, Toxic, or a coverage move. In particular, Regice is one of the most consistent Thunder Wave users due to it threatening most of the typical responses to the move, such as Ground-types and bulky tanks like Assault Vest Hariyama and Magmortar, with either a super effective Ice Beam or a crippling Toxic. However, Regice's low Speed, vulnerability to physical Fighting-type attacks, and weakness to Stealth Rock make it struggle to pivot into offensive teams reliably without good team support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Frost Breath has slightly lower accuracy than Ice Beam but always lands a critical hit, bypassing defensive boosts from Calm Mind users such as Musharna and Mesprit. A RestTalk set is generally too passive to be effective, lacking either coverage or Thunder Wave, but Sleep Talk is a decent choice on its own, as Regice is a pretty good response to sleep inducers such as Lilligant and Vivillon. A Rock Polish set with a Life Orb or Weakness Policy can be used as a late-game sweeper and finds many opportunities to set up due to Regice's good bulk and lack of 4x weaknesses compared to Aurorus. However, it lacks consistency and can be revenge killed even once boosted by Choice Scarf users such as Primeape. Choice Specs can be used to turn Regice into a bulky wallbreaker, but it is quite easy to exploit once its chosen attack has been revealed, lacks the support utility of the other sets, and is usually outclassed by Aurorus.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Fire-types can generally switch into Regice's STAB attacks with ease and force it out with their own super effective STAB attacks. Magmortar takes very little damage from Ice Beam and deals a ton back to it and most switch-ins with Fire Blast, while Camerupt can switch into Thunder Wave with impunity. However, most Fire-types are crippled by status, and Pyroar can be OHKOed easily by a well-timed Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: Regice's Fighting-type weakness means that physical Fighting-types can usually outspeed it and force it out. Hariyama in particular tanks Ice Beam thanks to Thick Fat and takes very little damage from Regice due to Assault Vest; alternatively, it gains a big power boost from Thunder Wave if it runs Guts instead. However, Toxic can wear Hariyama down significantly.</p> <p><strong>Lanturn</strong>: Lanturn can take any attack Regice throws at it, with even Focus Blast doing only minor damage, and it recovers HP when hit by Thunder Wave. It can then cripple Regice with Toxic or just pivot out with Volt Switch as Regice is forced out. Even if Regice runs Toxic, Lanturn can use Heal Bell to remove it, allowing a teammate such as Klinklang to switch in as Regice tries to inflict Toxic again.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Other bulky Pokemon in general that don't mind Thunder Wave are also good responses to Regice. Grumpig can take Ice Beam with impunity and use Taunt to stop Regice from spreading status, while Mega Audino can perform clerical duties unimpeded or set up Calm Mind against Regice without Toxic. Musharna enjoys switching into Thunder Wave thanks to both Synchronize and the paralysis preventing it from being stopped by Toxic users, and can also set up Calm Mind for days against Regice that lack Toxic regardless. Malamar also avoids the 3HKO from Ice Beam and can set up easily with Superpower.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam is a reliable STAB attack that Regice can use to hit most of the tier for good damage without any drawbacks. Thunderbolt lets Regice hit Water-types such as Samurott and Omastar for super effective damage, doing particularly well against Mantine and Pelipper. It also lands a reliable neutral hit on Fire-types, dealing a lot of damage to Charizard in particular. Focus Blast completes Regice's coverage by hitting other Ice-types harder, particularly Aurorus and Abomasnow, while also hitting many Pokemon that resist BoltBeam coverage, such as Piloswine and Rotom-F, as well as generally bulky foes such as Regirock for good damage. Toxic can also be used to deter defensive threats such as Lanturn, Hariyama, and Grumpig, as well as setup sweepers such as Mega Audino, from attempting to take advantage of Regice's slight lack of power. Thunder Wave lets Regice paralyze opposing Pokemon reliably, making threats such as Ludicolo and Tauros vulnerable to a follow-up attack, as Regice outspeeds them, or making them a target for a teammate to pick off later. Protect can also be used, netting Regice more Leftovers recovery and potentially racking up Toxic damage on bulky foes such as Musharna that Regice can't deal with otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>52 Speed EVs allow Regice to outspeed defensive Torterra and Gourgeist-XL before they can respond with a strong STAB attack or status move respectively. Maximum Special Attack investment alongside a Modest nature maximizes Regice's damage output, and the remaining EVs are invested in HP to improve Regice's general bulk, letting it take even powerful super effective hits such as Pyroar's Fire Blast. Leftovers is necessary to compensate for Regice's lack of recovery, ensuring it can act as a pivot for a larger portion of the game. Clear Body, while situational, is useful to let Regice switch into Memento users with impunity and hopefully stop any setup sweepers that switch in by using Thunder Wave or Toxic afterwards. It also prevents defensive stat drops from certain attacks such as Razor Shell and Psychic.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Regice should switch into special attackers that can't threaten it, such as Ludicolo, Floatzel, and Swellow. It should then either use Thunder Wave to paralyze them or the opponent's switch-in, or use Ice Beam or a coverage move to go straight for the KO if status has already been inflicted on them. Thunder Wave should also be used if the opponent sends in a setup sweeper that can't block the move, to either cripple the Pokemon or stop it from setting up altogether if it switches. It's also a good move to throw out in general when the opponent has a Fire-type Pokemon that they are likely to switch in. Toxic should be used when the opponent brings in a bulky wall or setup sweeper to try to take advantage of Regice's modest damage output, and Regice can then chip away at it with Ice Beam or switch to a more appropriate teammate to take advantage of the crippled foe. Regice should be preserved for later if Stealth Rock is present on its side of the field, as losing 25% of its health every time it switches in is extremely detrimental, especially if the opponent packs a consistent response to Regice, such as Lanturn. Even though Regice has a good Defense stat, it takes enough damage from physical attackers to prevent it being an effective pivot against things it normally beats such as Swellow and Floatzel in the late-game, so use it against them only if absolutely necessary.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard control is highly appreciated so that Regice can keep switching into foes throughout the battle and attack or spread status effectively. Pelipper and Mantine can use Defog and resist Fire- and Fighting-type attacks while appreciating Regice's resistance to Freeze-Dry. Hitmonchan and Claydol can use Rapid Spin while dealing with Steel-types more effectively and resisting Rock-type attacks. Physically defensive partners are useful for handling foes that can exploit Regice's weaker Defense stat. Mesprit and Musharna can deal with Fighting-types reliably, while Weezing can also use Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers and Taunt to shut down setup sweepers such as Mega Audino. Steelix also makes for an excellent response to Calm Mind Psychic-types, such as Musharna and Mesprit, that can set up on Regice lacking Toxic. Slow wallbreakers highly appreciate Regice paralyzing fast offensive threats that could otherwise beat them, such as Swellow and Archeops. Magmortar and Samurott can handle other Ice- and Fire-types, respectively, and will take chunks out of most switch-ins with their powerful STAB attacks. Fire-types such as Pyroar appreciate Regice's ability to cripple common defensive switch-ins such as Hariyama and Lanturn with Toxic, while also dealing with faster offensive threats such as Swellow and Archeops that can otherwise outspeed and KO it.</p>"

  "Torterra": {
    "overview": "<p>Torterra sports a great offensive presence that is supported by its high Base Power STAB moves. Furthermore, Torterra has solid all-around bulk and a decent typing, which make it a reliable tank that can take on many pertinent threats in the tier such as Lanturn, Garbodor, Rhydon, and Steelix. Torterra is also very versatile, being able to play the roles of tank, late-game sweeper, and wallbreaker. Sadly, Torterra is weak to common Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-type attacks from the likes of Pyroar, Archeops, and Jynx, and it is unable to reliably pressure Xatu, which greatly hinders its role as a Stealth Rock setter. Torterra's lackluster Speed also leaves it very susceptible to being KOed by revenge killers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance can be used on the Rock Polish set, but without Stone Edge Torterra will be unable to harm most Bug- and Flying-types. Curse can be used to increase Torterra's Attack and Defense but comes at the cost of lowering its Speed. Substitute is an alternative for Torterra to block status moves and set up a Rock Polish or Swords Dance more easily; it also eases prediction. Again, however, you will lose out on valuable coverage, and the recoil from Substitute and Wood Hammer will quickly build up. Yache Berry can be used for Torterra to take an Ice-type attack from the likes of Jynx and Piloswine and KO them in return.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Scyther, Vivillon, Swellow, Rotom-S, and Xatu have an immunity to Earthquake and resist Wood Hammer. Scyther and Vivillon can set up a Swords Dance and Quiver Dance against Torterra, respectively, and hit it hard with their STAB moves. Xatu, though it does not have a Flying-type STAB move to hit Torterra with, can either set up with Calm Mind or heavily dent it with Heat Wave. Xatu also deters Torterra from setting up Stealth Rock as it can bounce it back with Magic Bounce. Archeops does not like taking a Wood Hammer but can easily damage Torterra with a STAB-boosted Acrobatics. It should be noted that none of these Pokemon appreciate taking a Stone Edge from Torterra.</p> <p><strong>Weezing</strong>: Weezing is one of the best counters to Torterra. Due to Levitate, it is immune to Torterra's Earthquake, and it also resists Torterra's Grass-type attacks. It can then either burn Torterra with Will-O-Wisp or slowly wear it down with Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Pyroar, Magmortar, and Combusken can easily OHKO Torterra with their Fire-type attacks, but they have to be wary of Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Vileplume, Gourgeist-S, and Gourgeist-XL can stomach many hits from Torterra very well. Gourgeist-S and Gourgeist-XL are able to cripple Torterra by burning it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types such as Cryogonal, Articuno, Regice, Jynx, and Piloswine cannot take a hit from Torterra but can easily outspeed and OHKO Torterra with their STAB attacks. Piloswine and Vanilluxe can also easily revenge kill Torterra with Ice Shard even after it has a Rock Polish boost, and the latter can take a hit if needed, though it must watch out for Stone Edge.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Polish is used to increase Torterra's Speed by two stages, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted tier as well as some Choice Scarf users such as Rotom and Mesprit. Wood Hammer hits very hard when boosted but comes at the cost of taking recoil damage. Earthquake has great coverage with Wood Hammer, nailing Poison- and Fire-types such as Garbodor and Pyroar. Stone Edge forms the EdgeQuake combination with Earthquake, nailing Flying-types such as Scyther, Rotom-S, and Xatu, all of which otherwise can wall Torterra.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment is used for Torterra to hit as hard as possible. A Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment are used to outspeed positive-natured Choice Scarf Mesprit and Rotom after a Rock Polish boost as well as neutral-natured Aurorus, Pawniard, and Flareon before a boost. An Adamant nature can be used for a significant boost in power at the cost of being outsped by the previously mentioned Choice Scarf users. If running an Adamant nature, an EV spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe should be used, as it outruns Swellow at +2. Soft Sand gives a boost in power to Earthquake, which is generally Torterra's most consistent attack to use. Lum Berry is another option to provide a safety net against Will-O-Wisp and Scald users, which can hinder its sweep, so that Torterra can set up more easily. A Life Orb can be used instead to greatly increase Torterra's damage output, though it can easily wear Torterra down, especially combined with Wood Hammer's recoil. Overgrow gives Torterra a significant boost to its Grass-type moves when it is low on health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Torterra should not try to sweep unless its checks and counters are either heavily weakened or knocked out. It should be noted that Torterra can be revenge killed even after a Rock Polish boost by priority moves such as Piloswine's and Vanilluxe's Ice Shard as well as some Choice Scarf users such as Scyther and Jynx. Torterra should not repeatedly use Wood Hammer if it's not necessary, as its recoil along with Life Orb's recoil can heavily wear Torterra down. Torterra's best situations to set up a Rock Polish are on Pokemon that it forces out, such as Gastrodon and Rhydon, as well as Rotom locked into an Electric-type attack. If Torterra is not your primary sweeper, it can be used early- and mid-game to pressure the opposing team due to the sheer power that it possesses.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-types such as Pyroar and Magmortar have great defensive synergy with Torterra, dealing with Grass- and Bug-types that annoy it, while Torterra handles Water- and Rock-types that they struggle with. Rock-types such as Regirock, Archeops, and Kabutops work well with Torterra, as they can easily threaten Flying- and Ice-types with their powerful STAB moves. Mesprit is a solid teammate which threatens most of Torterra's defensive checks such as Weezing and Vileplume and can provide Healing Wish support to give Torterra another chance at sweeping. Wallbreakers such as Kangaskhan, Pyroar, and Samurott can help wear down Torterra's checks and counters, paving the way for it to sweep. Pokemon such as Xatu and Lanturn work well with Torterra, as they can give it a safe switch in via a slow U-turn and Volt Switch, respectively.</p>"
      },
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wood Hammer is an extremely strong STAB move, though it comes at the cost of recoil damage. Seed Bomb can be used over Wood Hammer if you do not want to inflict recoil damage on Torterra. Earthquake has great coverage alongside Wood Hammer, nailing Fire-, Poison-, and Steel-types such as Magmortar, Garbodor, and Klinklang very hard. Stealth Rock is a great utility move, as it wears down the opposing team's Pokemon each time they come in. Synthesis provides Torterra with longevity, making it a more efficient tank. Stone Edge can be used to nail Flying-types such as Scyther and Xatu, which otherwise can set up Swords Dance or Calm Mind, respectively, on Torterra. Being able to heavily damage the latter is really important, as it can stop Torterra from setting up Stealth Rock. Note that another attack can be used over Stealth Rock if your team already has a Stealth Rock setter.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment and 196 Defense EVs ensure that Tauros's Rock Climb and Fire Blast as well as Kangaskhan's Silk Scarf-boosted Double-Edge will not 2HKO Torterra after Stealth Rock damage and Leftovers recovery. The remaining EVs are placed in Attack with an Adamant nature for a solid damage output. A fully physically defensive spread is an option to take on physical attackers much more reliably. Leftovers is used to provide Torterra with passive recovery. Overgrow boosts the power of Torterra's Grass-type moves when it is low on health, which can be crucial.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>You should take advantage of Torterra's great STAB combination in order to scare out or beat many common entry hazard setters, which can help prevent the foe from setting up entry hazards. Switch Torterra into Pokemon that it can beat one-on-one, such as Tauros, Kangaskhan, defensive Lanturn, and Rhydon, to take hits from them for the team. From there, Torterra can set up Stealth Rock or heavily damage them with its attacks. Use Synthesis whenever Torterra is low on health so that it can take hits more comfortably, but do not use it too often, as it only has 8 PP. Though Torterra can beat many bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon and Lanturn, it does not appreciate a Scald burn from them, so it is highly encouraged that you do not directly switch Torterra into them unless it is needed. Use Torterra's STAB attacks accordingly depending on which Pokemon it is against and which Pokemon you expect the opponent to bring in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Garbodor makes for a great partner, as it can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which work well in conjunction with Torterra's Stealth Rock; it can also deal with Grass-types such as Lilligant, which could otherwise use Torterra as setup fodder, while Torterra takes care of Ground-types such as Rhydon and Steelix. Bulky Water-types such as Lanturn and Poliwrath work well with Torterra, as they cover its Ice- and Fire-type weaknesses. Clerics such as Mega Audino and Lanturn also make for great partners, as Torterra is very vulnerable to being crippled by status ailments. Pokemon that can take on Flying-types such as Xatu and Scyther are greatly appreciated. Malamar is able to take on Xatu lacking Signal Beam, and Rhydon beats Scyther with ease. Klinklang can also use Scyther as setup fodder and appreciates Torterra's ability to check Garbodor and bulky Water-types which give Klinklang trouble.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wood Hammer is Torterra's strongest STAB move, severely damaging most Pokemon that don't resist it and even some of the frailer ones that do, but it inflicts recoil damage. Earthquake is Torterra's alternate powerful STAB move that doesn't have a drawback and easily wipes out any Fire-, Poison-, or Steel-type Pokemon, such as Pyroar, Garbodor, and Klinklang, that resist Wood Hammer. Stone Edge targets Flying-types, such as Charizard, Scyther, and Xatu, which resist both of Torterra's STAB options, while being Torterra's strongest way of hitting Weezing. Seed Bomb is a STAB Grass-type move to use that doesn't incur recoil on Torterra and is especially useful if Torterra is in Overgrow range.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment optimizes Torterra's damaging potential, and maximum Speed investment allows Torterra to outrun as many threats as possible, such as Golurk, Omastar, and Aggron. An Adamant nature bolsters Torterra's power, notably allowing it to achieve feats such as cleanly 2HKOing Vileplume with Earthquake and 2HKOing Musharna with Wood Hammer. A Jolly nature can be considered to allow Torterra to get the Speed advantage against the likes of Modest Aurorus, Jolly Aggron, Timid Omastar, and offensive Lanturn variants. Choice Band elevates Torterra's Attack stat to staggering levels, allowing it to dent nearly anything with its unresisted STAB attacks. Overgrow gives an extra boost to Torterra's Grass-type moves if Torterra's health drops low, especially from its own repeated Wood Hammers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Torterra can find multiple opportunities to enter battle and wreak havoc using its high Defense as well as its resistance to Ground-type moves and Stealth Rock. Bulky Rock- and Ground-types such as Rhydon, Steelix, and Regirock make for great opportunities to switch in. Alternatively, Torterra can simply scare out Water- and Poison-types that it outspeeds, such as Lanturn, Gastrodon, Garbodor, and physically offensive Skuntank. From there, it can threaten the foe with its powerful dual STAB moves. Keep an eye out for Pokemon that resist both of Torterra's dual STAB moves; Torterra can attempt to hit them with Stone Edge on the switch, but in the cases of bulkier Pokemon that resist Grass and Ground, such as Weezing and Gourgeist-XL, it may be wiser to pull a double switch and let a teammate handle them. If Torterra's health drops into Overgrow range, it can either resort to Seed Bomb as its main Grass-type attack, or use a last-ditch Wood Hammer to dent the foe.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Normal-type attackers such as Tauros, Kangaskhan, and Swellow easily lure in bulky Rock- and Steel-types, giving Torterra an easier time switching in to start pummeling foes. These Normal-types are also fast and can threaten most offensive teams, patching up Torterra's lackluster Speed. Flying-types can U-turn out to make the process even smoother: Scyther, Swellow, and Archeops can bait Steel- and Rock-types, whereas Xatu attracts Pursuit Skuntank for Torterra to get a free hit off on the opposing team. Torterra takes Rock- and Electric-type moves aimed at the Flying-types, while the Flying-types cover for Torterra's sluggishness, but you should beware of their weakness to Ice-type attacks. Fire-types such as Pyroar, Magmortar, and Charizard have decent defensive synergy with Torterra, as they resist Bug-, Fire-, and Ice-type hits while absorbing Will-O-Wisp, whereas Torterra resists Ground- and Rock-type moves and has an immunity to Electric-type attacks. Fire-types and Torterra also have terrific offensive synergy with one another, as they boast immense power and can easily break what the other cannot; the Fire-types heavily pressure, if not destroy, Gourgeist-XL, Weezing, and Sap Sipper Miltank, which are some of Torterra's biggest obstacles, while Torterra can easily check slower Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types.</p>"

  "Rampardos": {
    "overview": "<p>With a gargantuan Attack stat and relatively decent Speed with a Choice Scarf, Rampardos stakes its claim in NU as one of the strongest revenge killers in the tier. To complement its impressive Attack, Rampardos also has a fantastic movepool and possesses the ability Sheer Force to boost most of its moves' power. Aside from its Attack, however, Rampardos's base stats are terrible and hinder its effectiveness. Its only relevant set is Choice Scarf, meaning that it will be locked into one move, and with its low base Speed it can also end up being outpaced by the likes of Floatzel and other relevant Choice Scarfed Pokemon such as Rotom, Jynx, and Primeape. Rampardos also possesses terrible defensive stats, which further decrease its overall offensive potential. On top of all this, Rampardos is also usually outclassed by other common offensive Rock-types such as Archeops and Barbaracle due to their better base Speed and dual typings.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band or Life Orb can be used on Rampardos to further increase its already gigantic Attack stat, but it loses out on the Speed needed to outspeed many of the Pokemon it actually wants to outspeed, such as Lilligant, Charizard, and Tauros. A mixed set containing Surf or Fire Blast can be useful for surprising physical walls such as Rhydon and Steelix, but most physical sets can already hit those Pokemon. A Sheer Force-boosted Fire Punch is also an option to hit Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Klinklang. A Rock Polish set is decent, but Rampardos usually just wants to use attacking moves to get heavy hits off. Rampardos can also run a Mold Breaker set with Stealth Rock and Endeavor, but it's usually outclassed by Pinsir as a Mold Breaker Stealth Rock setter due to its low Speed stat, which also means that KOing itself with Head Smash recoil is relatively easy to do, since most Rapid Spinners are faster. With the Mold Breaker set, it can also be used on a Sunny Day-based team as a suicide lead to set up Stealth Rock and sun.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Rhydon, Torterra, and Steelix can wall most of Rampardos's attacks, barring Superpower, so playing around these Pokemon might require some prediction.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Pokemon with priority moves, such as Hariyama, Hitmonchan, Shiftry, and Samurott, can easily take out Rampardos with some prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that are faster than Rampardos, such as Floatzel and other Choice Scarf users like Kabutops, Primeape, and Barbaracle, can outspeed Rampardos and KO it with a super effective attack.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Head Smash is Rampardos's strongest attack, dealing massive damage even if it's resisted and 2HKOing defensive Pokemon like Hitmonchan and Weezing. Rock Slide is Rampardos's Rock-type, Sheer Force-boosted STAB option, with more accuracy than Head Smash and no recoil. Superpower is one of the preferred coverage options, as it allows Rampardos to hit Pokemon such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Ferroseed that would otherwise be able to shrug off one of its STAB moves. Lastly, Zen Headbutt is a Sheer Force-boosted move used to nail defensive Poison-types and Fighting-types such as Weezing, Garbodor, and Hariyama. Earthquake is a more accurate option than Zen Headbutt that avoids Garbodor's Aftermath and Rocky Helmet damage, but it provides less power, and most of the things that Earthquake hits are already covered by Superpower and Rampardos's STAB moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf is the item of choice, as it allows Rampardos to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible—specifically very common offensive Pokemon such as Tauros and Archeops. Sheer Force is Rampardos's ability for this set, as it grants a boost to moves like Rock Slide and Zen Headbutt. A Jolly nature and maximum investment in Attack and Speed allow Rampardos to hit as hard and fast as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rampardos's main draw in NU is the fact that it's one of the tier's most powerful wallbreakers, so it should stick to being just that. Never try to pivot into Rampardos, as its frailty can lead to it being easily KOed on the switch. Instead, use Rampardos as a revenge killer. Try to bring it in early- and mid-game so teammates that can clean late-game have an easier time doing their job. It might not always be best to use STAB moves, especially when using a Choice Scarf. Playing with Rampardos may take some prediction, as choosing a move that's super effective against a Rhydon or Steelix switch-in can be crucial.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Late-game sweepers or cleaners such as Combusken or Swellow greatly appreciate Rampardos's ability to break down physical walls for them. Faster Pokemon such as Rotom and Tauros can pick up the slack against more offensive or balanced teams to make up for Rampardos's low Speed. Entry hazard setters such as Omastar, Garbodor, and Ferroseed make for great teammates, as they can wear down some of Rampardos's common checks, such as Steelix and Rhydon, which can allow it to spam one of its STAB moves. U-turn or Volt Switch users such as Scyther and Rotom have the ability to bring Rampardos in safely if the opponent decides to switch out on either of the aforementioned Pokemon. Healing Wish users such as Mesprit are also decent teammates for Rampardos, as they can bring it back to full health if it whittles itself down with Head Smash.</p>"

  "Floatzel": {
    "overview": "<p>Floatzel's excellent Speed tier allows it to outspeed almost all relevant Pokemon in the tier bar Swellow, notably including potent offensive threats such as Tauros, Archeops, and Pyroar. It also has a decent enough movepool that allows it to hit most of the tier hard. Floatzel's abilities are useful in some cases, as Swift Swim allows it to outpace and OHKO Kabutops and Omastar under rain, while Water Veil can be used to avoid getting burned by the likes of Scald and Will-O-Wisp. Although its strong coverage moves mostly make up for it, Floatzel's Special Attack isn't very high, leaving it struggling to pressure Pokemon like Lanturn and Pokemon immune to Water without having to rely on Focus Blast hitting multiple times. Floatzel is also quite frail, leaving it vulnerable to being revenge killed by priority from Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Hitmonchan, and Shiftry. Lastly, Floatzel faces competition from other Water-types such as Samurott and Ludicolo, as they are bulkier and have better movepools.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set capitalizes on Floatzel's naturally higher Attack stat, although this set is usually suboptimal, as Choice Band Floatzel is unable to switch attacks, which restricts its coverage. Besides that, Floatzel's physical movepool is far less impressive than its special one. Crunch can be used on the specially offensive set to OHKO Jynx, which otherwise has a chance to switch into Floatzel, as it can only 2HKO Jynx with Focus Blast, which is inaccurate and unreliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Floatzel can struggle to reliably damage Water-types such as Mantine and Poliwrath, as it has to rely on Focus Blast or Hidden Power Electric, to hit them. Lanturn is especially bothersome to Floatzel, as it has great Special Defense, is immune to Hidden Power Electric and has a super effective STAB move to hit Floatzel with.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Floatzel's low defenses mean almost all Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom and Primeape, as well as strong priority attacks such as Fake Out and Sucker Punch, can act before it and either KO or greatly damage it. Swellow outright outspeeds and OHKOes Floatzel with Choice Specs-boosted Boomburst.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: All Grass-type Pokemon can take on Floatzel with their respective STAB moves. Not all of them can safely switch in on it, but Lilligant, Vileplume, and Roselia can survive an Ice Beam from full HP and OHKO Floatzel with Giga Drain or any other Grass-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Pokemon such as Hariyama, Musharna, and Mega Audino can all tank multiple hits from Floatzel and proceed to hit it hard or set up on it. The latter two have to be wary of Taunt, though, as it can pressure both of them to switch out if they are low on HP.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump does solid damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Ice Beam provides great coverage alongside Hydro Pump, nailing Grass-types such as Vileplume, Gourgeist-XL, and Lilligant for super effective damage. Focus Blast rounds out Floatzel's coverage, hitting Ferroseed, Abomasnow for super effective damage, notably OHKOing Kangaskhan; it also provides neutral coverage on other Water-type Pokemon such as Samurott and Lanturn, and 2HKOes Jynx with it. Hidden Power Electric can 2HKO Mantine, as well as allowing Floatzel to reliably hit Water-types for the same damage as Focus Blast. Taunt is an alternative that allows Floatzel to break through bulkier Pokemon such as Musharna and Mega Audino by preventing them from healing up; it also prevents Pokemon such as Mantine and Prinplup from removing entry hazards from the field with Defog. Lastly, Hidden Power Grass is a viable option for luring in Gastrodon and comfortably achieving a 2HKO.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb provides Floatzel with a necessary power boost while also allowing it to take full advantage of its coverage options. Maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs allow Floatzel to hit as hard and fast as possible. A Timid nature is necessary to outspeed Tauros and Archeops, one of Floatzel's main perks. Swift Swim is chosen to give Floatzel a better matchup versus dedicated rain teams, and the ability to avoid burns with Water Veil is not as useful for this set.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Floatzel is best used as a late-game cleaner, when it can run through weakened teams with its fantastic Speed and coverage moves. Floatzel also has utility in being able to revenge kill fast offensive threats such as Archeops, and Tauros, and Scyther that has lost its Eviolite. In situations where your opponent has a counter to Floatzel such as a healthy Lanturn, it is often optimal to switch to a Pokemon that can handle said counter safely and maintain momentum. Floatzel can also use Ice Beam to pick off weakened targets without having to risk inaccurate Hydro Pumps. Try to avoid switching Floatzel in on anything other than weak resisted attacks, as its pitiful defenses combined with continual Life Orb damage cause it to faint quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong wallbreakers such as Primeape and Archeops are great partners for Floatzel, as Floatzel helps them get past annoying Pokemon like Steelix and Piloswine, while Stone Edge from both Primeape and Archeops helps Floatzel deal with Pokemon against which it struggles. Grass-types like Lilligant and Vileplume can make quick work of Water-types that Floatzel struggles with such as Lanturn and Poliwrath, while Floatzel can conversely demolish the Fire-types that threaten them. Floatzel also greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ferroseed and Garbodor, as most of Floatzel's checks and counters lack reliable recovery, making them fairly easy to wear down. Mesprit is another great partner, as it helps bring Floatzel in safely and provides support in both Thunder Wave and Healing Wish.</p>"

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon's excellent defensive typing allows it to check prominent threats in the tier such as Steelix, Aggron, and Swords Dance Charizard. Furthermore, Storm Drain gives it a Water immunity, allowing it to check Pokemon such as Lanturn, Kabutops, and Floatzel a lot more easily. It makes for a nice Scald and Volt Switch absorber thanks to its ability and its secondary Ground typing, while having access to Recover also means that Gastrodon can continually pivot throughout the match. Sadly, it is very slow, meaning it has to take a hit before firing back. It is also very susceptible to status, making it prone to being worn down and potentially forcing it to use Recover more often than it would like. It also isn't the best Fire-type check, since Fire-types such as Magmortar and Pyroar tend to carry Grass-type coverage for it and other targets such as Rhydon. Grass-types in general such as Gourgeist-XL, Vileplume, and Lilligant are a pain for Gastrodon, as they resist its STAB moves and can OHKO with their own.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive set utilizing either Life Orb, Choice Specs, or Leftovers can be used, but it struggles with breaking down bulky cores due to Gastrodon's weak STAB moves and coverage options. Ice Beam gives Gastrodon a way to do damage to Grass-types such as Vileplume and Lilligant, but it has to forgo Toxic, leaving Gastrodon susceptible to bulkier teams and becoming setup bait. Yawn is an option to force out Pokemon that would otherwise switch into Gastrodon such as Vileplume, but it can prove problematic should Gastrodon happen to start spreading burns. Counter is an option over Toxic to punish attackers such as Swords Dance Rhydon and Malamar that attempt to set up on Gastrodon; however, Clear Smog can do this a lot better without potentially forcing Gastrodon to sacrifice itself to whatever comes in next. A Curse set with a spread of 252 HP / 140 Def / 116 SpD, a Sassy nature, and the moves Curse, Recover, Earthquake, and Scald is an option to allow Gastrodon to tank physical and special hits better and possibly sweep late-game once Grass-types are removed. Mirror Coat can be used in tandem with a Rindo Berry to surprise Grass-types like Lilligant and Shiftry as well as lure Pokemon like Hidden Power Grass Pyroar and Energy Ball Vivillon. Memento is a neat option to give Gastrodon's teammates opportunities to set up and sweep; however, it is too slow to effectively use the move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Lilligant, Shiftry, Ludicolo, and Vileplume can easily take anything Gastrodon has and OHKO it with a STAB move. However, they dislike Scald burns, Shiftry in particular, and all of them with the exception of Vileplume must be wary of getting hit with Toxic on the switch in.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic poison from the likes of Steelix and Mantine, which Gastrodon would otherwise have no issue checking, as well as Toxic Spikes, wears down Gastrodon, meaning it can't consistently check threats like Swords Dance Charizard later in the game. Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon like Rotom and Weezing can be extremely crippling as well.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Many dangerous attackers including Aurorus, Magmortar, and Pyroar all normally carry coverage that can heavily damage Gastrodon, and due to its low Speed they force it to either take the attack and get KOed or switch to a teammate that could potentially take heavy damage from a STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Mega Audino, Sliggoo, and Roselia can generally switch into Gastrodon with ease and force it out via Toxic or STAB moves. The former two are also capable of setting up on Gastrodon with Calm Mind and Curse, respectively, and shrug off status due to the combination of Rest and Sleep Talk.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald allows Gastrodon to hit many of the Pokemon it checks super effectively, such as Archeops and Rhydon, and can cripple potential switch-ins with a burn. Earth Power complements Scald, as it hits most offensive Water-types, such as Omastar and Kabutops, super effectively, as well as Pokemon like Skuntank. Earthquake can be used instead to hit physically frail Pokemon such as Lanturn, Jynx, and Magmortar harder than Earth Power. Recover allows Gastrodon to keep itself healthy throughout the match. Toxic racks up damage against many of Gastrodon's common switch-ins, such as Abomasnow, Lilligant, and Mantine, as well as generally bulky Pokemon, such as Scyther and Mega Audino. Clear Smog can be used over Toxic to dissuade physical sweepers such as Malamar and Swords Dance Samurott from trying to set up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense EVs allow Gastrodon to better tank physical hits. Storm Drain allows Gastrodon to act as a Scald blocker and helps it check Water-types. 12 Speed EVs are used to outspeed uninvested Rhydon and cripple it with Scald. Leftovers provides a form of passive recovery. If using Earthquake, use a Relaxed nature and move the 12 Speed EVs into Special Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Gastrodon as a pivot into the likes of Garbodor, Steelix, Lanturn, Aggron, and Barbaracle in order to utilize its resistances and gain momentum to fire off an attack or get an opportunity to recover. Be wary of Grass-types such as Shiftry and Ludicolo when using Gastrodon, as they can pivot in on both of its STAB moves and proceed to OHKO it. Make sure to scout for Grass-type coverage on Pokemon Gastrodon would otherwise check such as Samurott and Magmortar. It should try to avoid status, particularly burn and poison, as Gastrodon gets worn down more quickly if afflicted by one of these. It can pivot into Water-type attacks to gain a Special Attack boost thanks to Storm Drain. Gastrodon should use Recover whenever necessary, as it needs to keep itself healthy to avoid being overwhelmed when switching into strong attackers. Use Scald to cripple switch-ins such as Shiftry and Xatu with a potential burn, making them less dangerous for teammates to handle.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can check Grass-types such as Magmortar, Scyther, Sap Sipper Miltank, and Sliggoo make for good teammates to cover Gastrodon's crippling 4x weakness to Grass-types. Toxic Spikes also heavily cripples Gastrodon, as it has no means of curing status conditions once inflicted, so grounded Poison-types such as Garbodor and Skuntank make for decent teammates. In return, Gastrodon is able to soft-check the likes of Rhydon and Steelix, both common switch-ins to either one. Specially bulky Pokemon such as Hariyama and Grumpig can compensate for Gastrodon's uninvested Special Defense stat and also resist Freeze-Dry, making them excellent switch-ins for Aurorus in particular, as well as other powerful special attackers such as Magmortar and Choice Specs Swellow. Flying-types such as Charizard,  Archeops, and Vivillon enjoy Gastrodon being able to take on the Rock- and Steel-types that resist their STAB moves.</p>"

  "Drifblim": {
    "overview": "<p>Drifblim is an uncommon threat that can make good use of Unburden and its varied movepool to disrupt opposing teams. STAB Acrobatics, Hex, and Will-O-Wisp make it very hard to wall completely, as common Flying-resistant Pokemon such as Steelix and Rhydon are crippled by Will-O-Wisp and Hex while most specially defensive targets such as Skuntank, Magmortar, and Hariyama dislike taking a boosted Acrobatics. Combined with incredible Speed once Unburden has triggered and a solid range of resistances and immunities, Drifblim can cause a lot of trouble for unprepared teams once it enters battle safely. However, despite its strong moves, Drifblim lacks the power of other cleaners like Tauros and Archeops, which is further emphasized by its need to split its offensive investment and by both of its attacking moves having conditions for maximum power. It's also very difficult to hit a good middle ground between giving Acrobatics good cleaning power and Hex good wallbreaking power, meaning Drifblim often comes up short without heavy entry hazard support. Drifblim also struggles against most special attackers due to Will-O-Wisp not crippling them while still being necessary to use a strong Hex against them, especially if they have the Defense to take Acrobatics. Furthermore, its multiple type weaknesses combined with its low uninvested defensive stats make it hard to use defensively and make it difficult to preserve its Substitutes for long. Finally, while Unburden is useful and gives Drifblim a solid niche, it also allows only one chance to sweep during a match, so Drifblim can be dealt with easily if it tries to sweep early and gets forced out by a priority attack user.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Drifblim can run a physically based Unburden set with an EV spread of 252 Atk / 76 Def / 180 Spe and an Adamant nature, using either a physical coverage move such as Knock Off or a support move such as Destiny Bond or Disable. This can provide Drifblim with additional utility and some extra defense against priority attacks such as Samurott's Aqua Jet, but this also makes it significantly easier to wall. Destiny Bond can usually net a KO after Unburden is activated and is difficult for the opponent to play around if they lack a status user or a faster Choice Scarf user such as Pyroar. Disable is a good choice on Drifblim due to its multiple immunities and resistances, which mean that many dangerous Pokemon such as Steelix and Rhydon can be completely walled once their super effective attack is Disabled. This lets Drifblim inflict free burns or set up Substitutes with ease. However, both of these options use up a valuable moveslot and can make sweeping more difficult overall. Different items can be used with Unburden, with Colbur Berry letting Drifblim actually switch into Knock Offs to activate Unburden, luring in usual checks such as Shiftry and Liepard and crippling them with Will-O-Wisp or Disable. A Liechi or Petaya Berry can be used to give Drifblim a surprise power boost, making Drifblim's health situation more precarious but potentially securing a sweep under the right conditions. However, Sitrus Berry is generally more reliable than these options, as it can be triggered reliably regardless of the opponent's actions. Defensive investment can be used on these sets to help Drifblim avoid being OHKOed before it can sweep. While Drifblim can also run specially based Unburden sets and defensive sets, these are usually not consistent enough to warrant using over the given options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially based attackers, particularly Fire-types such as Pyroar and Charizard, aren't too bothered by Will-O-Wisp and force Drifblim to either trigger Unburden and Acrobatics early to deal with them effectively or use Will-O-Wisp against a non-Fire-type and tank a hit in the process. Assault Vest Lanturn can stop a sweep outright due to its resistance to Acrobatics and ability to take a boosted Hex with ease. Floatzel is also immune to Will-O-Wisp if it runs Water Veil and thus won't take boosted Hex damage. Aurorus resists Acrobatics and can bypass Drifblim's Substitute with Refrigerate Hyper Voice.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Drifblim struggles to deal with faster attackers such as Kangaskhan, Archeops, Jynx, and Scyther, but they can only force it out if it hasn't been able to trigger Unburden or set up a Substitute to block them yet. Maintaining offensive pressure with these Pokemon can deny Drifblim opportunities from entering battle safely until it's too late for it to make a difference. Priority attackers such as Kabutops and Piloswine can also inflict heavy damage if Drifblim is left without a Substitute for some reason, although Sucker Punch users have to watch out for Substitute and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Normal-type Pokemon</strong>: Normal-type Pokemon are immune to Drifblim's strongest attack, and they can usually take an Acrobatics or Will-O-Wisp and hit back if necessary. Mega Audino is particularly threatening, as it can set up against Drifblim without much worry and can take repeated Acrobatics without issue. Pyroar is also immune to Will-O-Wisp and can take a single boosted Acrobatics if need be, while Swellow can bypass Drifblim's Substitute altogether with Scrappy Boomburst.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute lets Drifblim block Sucker Punch and status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, making it easier to disrupt foes consistently, while also letting it lower its own HP into Sitrus Berry's activation range after Stealth Rock so that it can trigger Unburden on its own. Acrobatics is a powerful physical STAB attack for Drifblim to use after Unburden is triggered, giving Drifblim good matchups against Grass-, Bug-, and Fighting-types such as Lilligant, Vivillon, and Guts Hariyama, particularly special attackers that don't mind Will-O-Wisp. It also lets Drifblim hit Normal-types directly and hits most Fire-types that can absorb Will-O-Wisp for good damage, such as Pyroar and Magmortar. Will-O-Wisp lets Drifblim cripple physical attackers that it can sometimes switch into, such as Rhydon and Primeape, as well as Choice item users in general that are locked into a resisted move or one that Drifblim is immune to, and it boosts Hex to ridiculous power levels. It also helps Drifblim set up Substitutes more easily against weak physical attackers. Hex is an extremely powerful special attack against foes inflicted with status and has excellent neutral coverage in general, especially with Acrobatics. Most physically defensive Pokemon that can take an Acrobatics, such as Aggron and Steelix, strongly dislike taking a full-powered Hex.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Unburden allows Drifblim to double its Speed and become a threat. 176 Speed EVs let Drifblim outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Samurott, maximum Speed Hasty Abomasnow, and many other Pokemon that hang around that Speed tier before an Unburden boost, as well as outspeeding Modest Ludicolo in rain, Choice Scarf Jynx, and Choice Scarf Primeape after Unburden activates. Investing more Speed EVs to outspeed Skuntank lets Drifblim burn it before it can Taunt back, but underspeeding means that Pursuit can trigger Unburden and let Drifblim get an extra boosted Acrobatics off, potentially letting it break through Skuntank depending on Sucker Punch mind games. The Attack investment guarantees that Acrobatics 2HKOes standard Skuntank after Stealth Rock damage while ensuring OHKOs against super effective targets such as Lilligant and Shiftry. The rest of the EVs are invested in Special Attack alongside a Rash nature to boost Hex's power; a Rash nature is generally preferred so that Drifblim can take the occasional priority attack better, but a Mild nature prevents its Substitutes from being broken by defensive Vileplume. Alternative EV spreads can be used to make Acrobatics a more potent cleaning tool; 216 Attack EVs ensure the 2HKO on Skuntank without Stealth Rock support, while 176 Attack EVs and a Naughty or Lonely nature let Drifblim OHKO standard Hariyama after Stealth Rock damage, but these spreads make Hex considerably weaker against targets such as specially defensive Rhydon. 30 HP IVs give Drifblim a stat of 440, which is divisible by 4 so that it's at exactly 50% when it uses Substitute after taking Stealth Rock damage, triggering Unburden automatically. Sitrus Berry is the item of choice because it lets Drifblim trigger Unburden on its own and provides Drifblim with an extra opportunity to use Substitute.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Drifblim should be preserved until the late-game, when checks such as Mega Audino and Aurorus have been removed by teammates and Drifblim can break through the remaining defensive foes. Drifblim only gets one opportunity to sweep in a match, so don't waste it too early. Additionally, Drifblim's Acrobatics is powerful enough to OHKO targets it hits super effectively, but it will need extra residual damage on neutral targets to clean effectively. Drifblim should enter battle against an initially slower foe that it can switch into and use Will-O-Wisp or Substitute freely against, such as Vileplume, Weezing, or Garbodor, so that it can set up a sweep more easily. Will-O-Wisp and Hex should be used to break down threats until Drifblim's Substitute is broken, at which point it should keep using Substitute until Unburden triggers and it can sweep and use Acrobatics effectively. Drifblim can also switch into Choice item users such as Primeape if you predict an attack that it is immune to, guaranteeing Drifblim can set up a Substitute the following turn. In some cases it may be worth it to let the opponent set up Stealth Rock or avoid removing it with your own entry hazard controller so that Drifblim can trigger Unburden automatically upon switching into it, letting it revenge kill targets such as Speed-boosted Lilligant, Vivillon, and Ludicolo with Acrobatics. While Drifblim's Ghost typing lets it block Rapid Spin, it shouldn't be relied on for this due to its low defensive stats and multiple weaknesses to coverage moves such as Hitmonchan's Ice Punch and Kabutops's Stone Edge.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes support lets Drifblim hit targets with Hex for heavy damage, letting it sweep more reliably in the late-game by not having to burn weakened targets such as Rhydon and Steelix first to OHKO them with Hex. Garbodor and Weezing can set these entry hazards reliably while also setting Spikes and spreading burns with Will-O-Wisp, respectively, to complement Drifblim's sweep. Additional cleaners such as Swellow and Tauros can take advantage of the holes Drifblim can break in offensive teams due to its disruptive capabilities and excellent speed after Unburden triggers. They can also soften up Rock- and Steel-types such as Aggron and Steelix with their coverage moves, or less sturdy foes such as Aurorus and Kabutops with repeated attacks, helping Drifblim sweep later instead if required. Wallbreakers such as Life Orb Magmortar and Choice Specs Aurorus can break down bulky specially offensive Pokemon such as Mega Audino that can otherwise tank Acrobatics with ease and aren't particularly bothered by Will-O-Wisp. Slow pivots such as Mesprit and Lanturn can use U-turn and Volt Switch to bring Drifblim into foes safely, mitigating its poor defensive stats and letting it set up more consistently. They can also use Thunder Wave to paralyze faster threats that resist Acrobatics, such as Archeops, so that they can be easily KOed with Hex. A second Ghost-type can also be somewhat useful for spinblocking and preserving entry hazards, relieving pressure from Drifblim to fill this role and letting it sweep more consistently while potentially overwhelming the opponent's Ghost-type checks with repeated Hexes. Rotom and Mismagius are good candidates for this due to their decent bulk, offensive power, and utility in coverage moves such as Trick, Thunder Wave, and Memento.</p>"

  "Mismagius": {
    "overview": "<p>Mismagius is one of the best Pokemon at preserving a team's entry hazards due to its Ghost typing to block Rapid Spin with, access to Taunt to block Defog with, and great Speed stat to ensure it can use the move well. Furthermore, its wide support movepool including Will-O-Wisp, Memento, Thunder Wave, Destiny Bond, and many other options lets it function as an unpredictable and potent stallbreaker on balanced and offensive teams. Its immunities to Ground-, Fighting-, and Normal-type attacks and good special bulk also give it some opportunities to switch in, but its low physical bulk makes it difficult to switch in against most offensive teams outside of Choice-locked attackers. Additionally, while Mismagius outspeeds threatening offensive Pokemon such as Charizard and Jynx, it's quite vulnerable to faster attackers such as Tauros and Archeops, and it strongly dislikes Speed ties with foes such as Scyther, which can OHKO it if they win. Mismagius also usually requires a Colbur Berry to avoid being Pursuit trapped or taken advantage of by Pokemon that use Knock Off as a coverage move, such as Hariyama, meaning it can easily be worn down without passive recovery, especially if it lacks Pain Split. Overall, while Mismagius has a solid Special Attack stat, its best niche over other Ghost-types such as Rotom and Haunter is a support-based set that makes the most of its better Speed tier and movepool, as it lacks the power or secondary STAB to be as offensively threatening as its competition.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Power Gem hits many Pokemon that normally deal with Mismagius, such as Charizard, Pyroar, Archeops, Swellow, and Scyther, for good damage as they switch in, but it requires Special Attack investment to be useful, and it still doesn't let Mismagius beat Assault Vest Magmortar without Nasty Plot. Hidden Power Ground hits Skuntank, one of Mismagius's best counters, for decent damage, but it can usually be beaten by Pain Split regardless if Skuntank lacks Crunch or Dark Pulse. Life Orb and maximum Special Attack investment can be used on the support set to boost the power of Hex and coverage attacks and to make Pain Split more effective in general, but this chips away at Mismagius's longevity as a spinblocker and stallbreaker. An offensive Nasty Plot set can be a decent late-game sweeper, but it requires a Life Orb to reliably get the KOs it needs, and it's quite vulnerable to faster threats such as Archeops and priority attackers such as Kangaskhan and Samurott. A Choice Specs set can hit decently hard and use Trick to cripple defensive responses or a coverage move such Thunderbolt or Energy Ball to surprise Mantine or Gastrodon, respectively, but it's usually outdone by Haunter due to its Poison-type STAB attacks and higher Special Attack. A Substitute + Calm Mind set has a decent matchup against special attackers but is again highly susceptible to physical attackers without defensive investment, and a defensive set is done better with Misdreavus.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Charizard, Pyroar, Camerupt, and Magmortar take little damage from Mismagius's Hex and are immune to Will-O-Wisp, giving them a free turn to fire off a powerful STAB attack. However, they fear switching into Thunder Wave with the exception of Camerupt.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Although threatened by Will-O-Wisp, Shiftry and Liepard take little from Hex and can hit Mismagius for massive damage, even through a Colbur Berry. Special variants of these Dark-types have even less to fear from Mismagius, as they are not crippled by Will-O-Wisp. Skuntank can also deal with Mismagius well if it runs Crunch or Dark Pulse, but sets with only Sucker Punch and Pursuit lose to it if Mismagius runs Pain Split.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Though Mismagius has a high Speed stat itself, faster Pokemon, such as Archeops, Tauros, and Swellow, can easily revenge kill it if it fails to hit them with Thunder Wave as they switch in. Strong priority attacks such as Kabutops's Aqua Jet and Kangaskhan's Fake Out can also inflict significant damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers that can take a boosted Hex on top of burn damage, such as Aurorus, Articuno, and Lapras, can switch into Mismagius without many issues, deal heavy damage or KO it with their STAB attacks, and threaten switch-ins if Mismagius attempts to switch out after burning them.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Mismagius relies on Taunt to prevent itself from being burned or poisoned when facing stall teams; moves such as Steelix's Toxic or Garbodor's Gunk Shot can hit Mismagius as it switches in and cripple it for the rest of the game, especially if it lacks Leftovers. Paralysis also severely cripples Mismagius, as it can no longer Taunt foes as effectively with its lowered Speed.</p> <p><strong>Guts</strong>: Pokemon such as Hariyama and Throh that can utilize Guts can switch into Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave and use the status to their advantage while threatening Mismagius back with a Guts-boosted Knock Off.</p>",

      "Bulky Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp can spread burns to the opponent's team and stop slower physical attackers such as Hitmonchan and Primeape from being a threat to Mismagius, letting it follow it up with a powerful Hex. Taunt forces its foes to attack Mismagius instead of setting up or removing entry hazards, using stat-boosting moves, restoring their HP, or removing status with Heal Bell or Rest, which makes Mismagius very difficult to deal with without attacking, given its Speed tier. Hex is a powerful STAB move when the foe is affected by status and is preferred to Shadow Ball due to Mismagius's uninvested Special Attack stat. However, it deals little damage to non-statused foes, although it is still usually enough to KO opposing Ghost-types without burning them first. Pain Split is inconsistent but provides Mismagius with somewhat reliable recovery and lets it cripple healthy Pokemon when at low HP, allowing it to stallbreak more consistently. Thunder Wave cripples offensive Pokemon that don't mind Will-O-Wisp as much such as Choice Specs Swellow, setup sweepers like Lilligant, and Fire-types such as Charizard and Pyroar. It also lets Mismagius fire off a status-boosted Hex on most of these targets afterwards, excluding Pyroar. Memento sacrifices Mismagius to provide setup opportunities for sweepers such as Barbaracle and Lilligant.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Colbur Berry lets Mismagius survive a single Dark-type attack, allowing it to switch into attackers potentially carrying Knock Off as coverage such as Hariyama and Choice Scarf Scyther and letting it tank a Pursuit from Skuntank if it stays in, beating it one-on-one. Leftovers is an alternative to give Mismagius more recovery, which is more useful for variants that lack Pain Split when its team already has a solid switch-in to Knock Off and Pursuit users, such as Mega Audino. Maximum Speed EVs let Mismagius Speed tie with Scyther, with the remainder being put into HP and Defense for maximum bulk, letting it tank more physical attacks after burning Pokemon. Levitate provides Mismagius with a handy immunity to Ground-type attacks, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, giving it more opportunities to switch in and stopping it from being worn down so easily or being poisoned by Toxic Spikes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mismagius's role depends a lot on what move it runs in its last slot; Pain Split lets Mismagius act as a dedicated stallbreaker, while Thunder Wave and Memento are more useful for and against offensive teams, respectively. Early-game, Mismagius should aim to spread status to the opponent's team, and it should be led with if your team needs Mismagius's Taunt to keep entry hazards from setters such as Garbodor off the field. Taunt should also be used on Defog users such as Mantine and Pelipper if Mismagius can switch in before they use the move, as well as to stop Pokemon such as Mega Audino and Musharna from restoring HP or setting up. Memento should be used against offensive Pokemon that are either forced out by or helpless to stop a setup sweeper on your team, giving it a guaranteed free turn if the opponent lacks other means of stopping it, such as status or phazing. Mismagius should be switched into users of Rapid Spin if hazards need to be kept on your opponent's side. Even if they predict this, Mismagius can usually survive an Ice Punch from Hitmonchan or a Shadow Ball from Claydol and block the spin attempt even if it faints in the process. Even when heavily weakened, Mismagius still serves as a deterrent to Fighting- and Ground-type attackers such as Primeape and Rhydon using their main STAB attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mismagius is the perfect partner for most entry hazard setters. Garbodor and Omastar can provide Spikes and either Toxic Spikes or Stealth Rock, respectively, while appreciating Mismagius's Ground-type immunity and matchup against Defog users. Toxic Spikes support in particular can be useful for letting Mismagius fire off boosted Hexes without using a status move first; Weezing is another good user of the move and provides its team with a sturdier Fighting-type check in general. Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Jynx make for good partners, as they appreciate Mismagius wearing down bulky Pokemon for a late-game sweep as well as having the ability to revenge kill offensive threats that severely dent Mismagius such as Archeops and Tauros. Setup sweepers such as Barbaracle, Omastar, and Rhydon appreciate Memento support as well as Mismagius wearing the opposing team down with burns. Checking Fire-types such as Pyroar and Charizard that can beat Mismagius easily is also important. Samurott and Kabutops resist their STAB attacks and force them out with strong Aqua Jets, while Hariyama can use Thick Fat to check them well, especially if it runs Stone Edge. Fighting-types such as the aforementioned Hariyama and Hitmonchan can deal with the Dark-types that threaten Mismagius, such as Shiftry and Liepard.</p>"

  "Purugly": {
    "overview": "<p>Purugly has high Speed, allowing it to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame; however, it lacks the power to hit hard. This is made better by its ability, Defiant, which allows Purugly to get an Attack boost if it is switched into a Defog or Sticky Web. This is a great asset for teams that rely on stacking entry hazards, as Defiant discourages the use of Defog. Purugly faces competition as a Defiant user from Pawniard, which is bulkier and has a better movepool, but Purugly has merits such as a higher Speed and access to U-turn. It also faces competition as a Normal-type, as Pokemon such as Zangoose and Kangaskhan are stronger, bulkier, and have a wider movepool. Purugly also has low bulk, so a misprediction could be fatal. Its small movepool also makes it easily walled by Rock- and Steel-types such as Regirock and Probopass.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Purugly has limited coverage, its only options being Play Rough, which hits Fighting-types harder, Iron Tail, which 2HKOes Clefairy, and Wake-Up Slap, which hits Rock- and Steel-types, though many of them don't take much damage from it. Support-wise, Purugly can use Taunt, which prevents status and recovery, Hypnosis, though it has low accuracy, and Super Fang, which is Purugly's best way of wearing down walls. Quick Attack can be used as more reliable priority, but it is weaker than Sucker Punch, and Facade allows Purugly to take advantage of status, but is otherwise much weaker than Return. Lastly, a Choice Band set can be used for more strength, but Purugly prefers the ability to change moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Rhydon and Steelix completely wall Purugly and can use it as entry hazard fodder or deal a lot of damage with their STAB moves. Other Pokemon such as Klinklang and Barbaracle can use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Purugly struggles to get past common physical walls such as Vileplume or Seismitoad, which can retaliate or status Purugly.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Poliwrath and Hariyama can take a hit and deal a large amount of damage with their STAB moves. Gurdurr can recover its lost health with Drain Punch or set up Bulk Ups.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority</strong>: Due to Purugly's lack of bulk, Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Scyther, and naturally faster Pokemon, like Swellow, can easily revenge kill it. Priority, such as Kangaskhan's Fake Out, also does a lot of damage.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis makes Purugly easily revenge killed. Ferroseed and Liepard, common Thunder Wave users, can survive a hit and outprioritize due to Prankster. Pokemon such as Vivillon can put Purugly to sleep, shutting it down, while Pokemon such as Rotom-F can burn it, preventing it from doing much damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fake Out allows Purugly to revenge kill or get damage on faster threats and boosted Pokemon. Return is Purugly's main STAB move and strongest attack. U-turn allows Purugly to gain momentum on predicted switches into its counters. Sucker Punch provides stronger priority and hits Ghost-types. Knock Off can be used instead, as it is stronger, more reliable, and can cripple switch-ins due to its secondary effect and Purugly already outspeeds every unboosted Ghost-type. However, Knock Off lacks priority, making Purugly easier to revenge kill.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Purugly to outspeed as much as possible. 252 Attack EVs increase power and can be backed up by either a Silk Scarf, which boosts the power of Normal-type moves, or a Life Orb, which provides a stronger boost to all attacks but can wear Purugly down. Defiant is the chosen ability, as it allows Purugly to switch into Defog and Sticky Web and get a +2 Attack boost, while discouraging Defog as a whole.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its poor bulk, Purugly dislikes switching in on possible hits, so it prefers to switch in after a KO in order to revenge kill. However, Purugly could also be switched in on a predicted Defog to get a +2 Attack boost and then dish out heavy damage. Fake Out shouldn't always be used first turn; on a predicted switch, Purugly should either U-turn to gain momentum or use another, stronger attack. Fake Out followed by Sucker Punch can be used to revenge kill Pokemon that are weakened, faster, or have their stats boosted. Purugly shouldn't be pressured to stay in if it has a boost; using U-turn or hard switching is fine if Purugly is against a Pokemon that walls or outspeeds it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Purugly should be used with entry hazards, as they bait Defog and Purugly appreciates the chip damage. Entry hazard setters such as Crustle and Cradily work well, as Purugly prefers to be used on a hyper offensive team with suicide leads. Partners that use Volt Switch and U-turn can bring Purugly in safely while creating a VoltTurn core. Of these, Mesprit can beat Fighting-types, and Primeape can beat Rock- and Steel-types, which otherwise wall Purugly. Because of this, it also appreciates Ground- and Fighting-types such as Golurk and Gurdurr, respectively. Wallbreakers such as Magmortar can wear down the opponent's walls to a point where Purugly can KO them.</p>"

  "Skuntank": {
    "overview": "<p>Skuntank's incredible Poison / Dark typing gives it a very unique set of resistances that allows it to check many threatening Pokemon including Musharna, Mesprit, Mega Audino, Shiftry, Lilligant, and Haunter. Access to Pursuit lets it trap a myriad of Pokemon, making Skuntank an excellent support Pokemon for offensive teams, and Sucker Punch gives it a way to harass frail offensive Pokemon. Skuntank also has good utility moves in Taunt and Defog, which allow it to shut down defensive Pokemon and clear entry hazards from the field, respectively. Aftermath lets Skuntank also serve as an emergency check to physical attackers, shaving off some of the foe's HP as it goes down. However, Skuntank is threatened by common Ground-type Pokemon such as Rhydon, Torterra, and Quagsire. Average stats overall don't help Skuntank either, as it's left with middling bulk and only decent Attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Another option is to use a Choice Band set, as a strong Dark-type STAB attack comes in handy against bulkier teams. Choice Band-boosted Pursuit also does a good job at letting Skuntank trap Psychic-type Pokemon running Colbur Berry like Xatu and Mesprit. Rocky Helmet is an alternative item to wear down physical attackers such as Klinklang and Swords Dance Shiftry. Explosion softens one of the foe's Pokemon and safely brings another Pokemon onto the battlefield. Roar lets Skuntank phaze special sweepers such as Lilligant, Mesprit, and Musharna, as well as wear down Pokemon in tandem with entry hazards, while Haze eliminates the stat boosts outright. Play Rough gives Skuntank a way to deal more damage to Fighting-types, but doing so forces it to give up either Poison Jab or Sucker Punch, hindering its overall effectiveness. A physically-based Defog set can also be used, combining anti-hazard support, priority, and trapping roles into one Pokemon, but it struggles to be effective against most hazard setters.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Rhydon, Torterra, and Sandslash are very threatening Pokemon for Skuntank, as they are physically bulky enough to take hits from Skuntank with ease and can force Skuntank out with Earthquake. Rhydon also takes advantage of Skuntank to freely set up Rock Polish or Swords Dance, but it does fear Life Orb-boosted Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Hariyama, Primeape, Gurdurr, and Hitmonchan resist Skuntank's Dark-type STAB moves and threaten it with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Skuntank is usually overwhelmed by strong physical attackers due to its middling Defense, so Pokemon such as Archeops, Tauros, Kangaskhan, Kabutops, and Samurott can easily take it on, and the former three are even able to avoid Aftermath damage with Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sucker Punch allows Skuntank to pick off some offensive Pokemon. Pursuit allows Skuntank to trap Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Musharna, Mesprit, Haunter, and Mismagius. Poison Jab lets Skuntank reliably damage Grass-types such as Shiftry, Cacturne, and Lilligant, as well as 3HKO Mega Audino. Taunt gives Skuntank a way to shut down defensive Pokemon such as Musharna and Mega Audino, as well prevent slower Pokemon from setting up any entry hazards. Crunch can be used if a reliable Dark-type STAB move is needed to prevent Klinklang from setting up for free and to deal reliable damage to Xatu, Mesprit, and Musharna.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>232 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature allow Skuntank to 3HKO Mega Audino with Poison Jab. 144 Speed EVs allow Skuntank to outspeed neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Ludicolo and Samurott. The rest of the EVs go into Special Defense to let Skuntank better check special attackers such as Lilligant, Cacturne, Mesprit, and Audino. Lum Berry gives Skuntank some insurance against Will-O-Wisps from the Ghost-types which it aims to Pursuit trap, as well as well avoiding being put to sleep from Lilligant's Sleep Powder. Black Sludge can be used to give Skuntank consistent recovery that allows it to last a bit longer, but the extra insurance against Will-O-Wisp from Lum Berry to aid in Pursuit trapping is generally more beneficial. If using Black Sludge, 24 HP EVs should be moved from Special Defense to HP in order to maximize the recovery from Black Sludge. Aftermath is chosen to damage physical attackers after they KO Skuntank with a contact move. An alternative EV spread of 24 HP / 232 Atk / 168 SpD / 84 Spe can be used to ensure that Skuntank is slower than minimum Speed Xatu, allowing Skuntank to take it down with Pursuit when it uses U-turn, while giving Skuntank more bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Skuntank's typing to switch into Pokemon it checks such as Lilligant, Shiftry, Musharna, Mesprit, and Exeggutor. When anticipating an opposing Pokemon's switch, use Pursuit to heavily damage or eliminate it from the match. When using Sucker Punch, be wary of Will-O-Wisp and Substitute users, as they can take advantage of Skuntank by using it as setup fodder. Similarly, while Skuntank switches into both Haunter and Mismagius easily, it must watch out for Will-O-Wisp if it's not holding a Lum Berry. Use Taunt to shut down defensive Pokemon such as Audino and Musharna, as well as prevent Pokemon from using any non-attacking moves, easing prediction with Sucker Punch. Taunt is also useful for shutting down slower entry hazard setters such as Garbodor and Crustle.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primeape pairs incredibly well with Skuntank, as it appreciates the Pursuit support Skuntank provides, allowing it to easily wallbreak. Primeape also has access to U-turn, which works great with its ability to lure in Ghost- and Psychic-types for Skuntank to trap. Calm Mind Mesprit pairs well with Skuntank, as Skuntank is able to eliminate both Musharna and Mega Audino, two Pokemon that are bulky enough to stomach Mesprit's boosted attacks, while Mesprit is able to switch into Ground-type attacks aimed at Skuntank due to Levitate. Skuntank also traps faster Ghost-types that threaten Mesprit such as Haunter, Rotom, and Mismagius. Swords Dance Kabutops and Samurott appreciate Skuntank's ability to switch into Lilligant and Shiftry and threaten both with Poison Jab, making it easier for Samurott and Kabutops to clean late-game. Mixed Samurott and Floatzel also threaten problematic Ground-types such as Rhydon and Torterra. Lilligant is a great partner, as it threatens Ground- and Rock-types with its Grass STAB type, while Skuntank shuts down Mega Audino, one of the few Pokemon bulky enough to take Lilligant's attacks after a Quiver Dance.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacking Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dark Pulse is Skuntank's most reliable Dark-type STAB move, dealing heavy damage to Musharna, Mesprit, and Exeggutor while dealing reliable damage to Garbodor. Fire Blast hits many common switch-ins to Skuntank, such as Pawniard, Mawile, Ferroseed, and Vileplume. Hidden Power Grass deals heavy damage to Rhydon, Carracosta, and Quagsire. Alternatively, Acid Spray allows Skuntank to break through bulkier foes such as Mega Audino, Sliggoo, and Mantine while softening up switch-ins. Defog allows Skuntank to remove all entry hazards from the field, making it act as a team supporter. This set in particular utilizes Defog well because it is able to beat common hazard setters by luring them in and KOing them, making it easier to keep hazards off the field. Memento is another decent option that weakens a foe, allowing a sweeper to get a free opportunity to set up. Sludge Bomb can be used as a reliable Poison-type STAB move to hit Mega Audino and Lilligant, but it is generally inferior to Dark Pulse.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs plus a Modest nature allow Skuntank to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed EVs allow Skuntank to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, most notably Modest Mesprit. Black Sludge is used to increase Skuntank's longevity and let it switch into Pokemon such as Mesprit and Garbodor more comfortably. Alternatively, Shuca Berry has use in reducing the amount of damage taken from a Ground-type attack from the likes of Rhydon and Steelix, allowing Skuntank to get off a crucial Defog or attack if needed. Life Orb is another option that gives a more significant boost in power, which makes up for Skuntank's lacking Special Attack against neutral targets at the cost of longevity. Aftermath is used to wear down physical attackers if they KO Skuntank with a contact move. Alternatively, an EV spread of 112 HP / 252 SpA / 144 Spe with a Modest nature gives Skuntank more bulk and lets it outspeed up to neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon, such as Ludicolo and Samurott.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is designed to lure in conventional answers to Skuntank such as Rhydon, Mawile, and Quagsire. It also has a better matchup against entry hazard setters, allowing Skuntank to effectively run Defog and support its teammates. Generally Defog should be used against a Pokemon that cannot do much in return, such as Lilligant or Shiftry. Do not directly switch Skuntank into Stealth Rock users such as Rhydon and Carracosta, as they all have a way to threaten Skuntank.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate entry hazards being removed, such as Archeops and Swellow, pair well with Skuntank. They also appreciate Skuntank's ability to eliminate Rhydon, a common answer to both Pokemon. Mesprit appreciates Skuntank's ability to switch into and check Ghost-types, while in return Mesprit is able threaten Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Hitmonchan, switch into Ground-type attacks thanks to Levitate, and restore Skuntank's HP with Healing Wish if it has been worn down too much by residual damage. Setup sweepers such as Belly Drum Linoone and Swords Dance Samurott also work well with Skuntank if it runs Memento, allowing them to have a free setup opportunity.</p>"

  "Bronzor": {
    "overview": "<p>Bronzor has a very unique role in NU, sporting great typing in tandem with Levitate, which allows it to check several prominent threats such as Jynx, Mesprit, Musharna, Tauros, Steelix, and Rhydon. Additionally, Bronzor has good bulk that's boosted further with Eviolite, making it very difficult to break past. All of these characteristics make it a valuable Pokemon for stall teams in particular thanks to the wide array of Pokemon it helps deal with, but it can also work on more balanced archetypes if necessary. However, Bronzor's main issues lie in general passivity and vulnerability to Fire- and Dark-types, especially Skuntank and Malamar, the former of which is immune to Toxic and is capable of Pursuit trapping Bronzor, while the latter couldn't care less about Toxic due to Rest. Furthermore, being forced to use Rest to recover any significant amount of HP, as well as being crippled severely by Knock Off, only makes matters worse. Said passivity and very low Speed also make Bronzor susceptible to Taunt.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sleep Talk lets Bronzor remain functional during the turns it is asleep, but this is only really useful if a different Pokemon is using Stealth Rock, as otherwise it is essentially a 33% accurate Psywave once Stealth Rock is set up. Hypnosis has use in putting some of Bronzor's checks to sleep; however, the move is very unreliable. Rain Dance and Sunny Day sound like appealing options at first glance, but Bronzor is outclassed by Mesprit as a weather setter due to the latter's access to U-turn and lower passivity. Heatproof is not worth running as Bronzor's main niche is avoiding Ground-type coverage that most Pokemon run to hit Steel-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Skuntank is Bronzor's worst enemy, as it sports an immunity to both Psywave and Toxic, is able to trap Bronzor with Pursuit, and also has the ability to remove Stealth Rock with Defog. It's also worth noting that Skuntank completely shuts down Bronzor with Taunt. Malamar is particularly threatening, as it's immune to Psywave and rids itself of poison with Rest, making Bronzor free setup bait for it unless it removes Contrary with Skill Swap, most likely being KOed in the process. Other Dark-types such as Shiftry and Liepard also significantly threaten Bronzor, being able to remove its Eviolite with STAB Knock Off, but none of them particularly appreciate being hit by Toxic on the switch, especially Shiftry when it's carrying Life Orb.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Magmortar, Pyroar, Charizard, and Combusken all threaten to significantly damage Bronzor with Fire Blast, though none of these Pokemon appreciate switching into Psywave or Toxic. Pyroar gets an extra nod for being able to prevent Bronzor from spreading status and setting up Stealth Rock with Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types, in particular Hex users such as Mismagius and Rotom, can be troublesome for Bronzor, as they can both hit Bronzor with a full-powered Hex while it is asleep from Rest. Mismagius can also use Taunt to prevent the use of Toxic, Stealth Rock, or Sleep Talk, while Rotom can potentially set up a Substitute to prevent being worn down by poison.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Calm Mind Xatu poses a significant threat to Bronzor, as it's able to recover lost HP from Psywave with Roost and additionally bounces back Stealth Rock and Toxic, leaving Bronzor helpless. Bronzor can set up Stealth Rock if it's using Skill Swap, but trying to poison Xatu is a different case, because it's easily telegraphed after their abilities are swapped. While less common, Taunt Roost Archeops stops Bronzor cold, as even if it cannot immediately do heavy damage, it'll wear it down while recovering Psywave damage.</p> <p><strong>Eviolite Removal</strong>: Bronzor fears Knock Off like the plague, as not only does it take significant damage from it, it also loses Eviolite, cutting its walling capabilities. Trick from the likes of Choice Scarf Mesprit, Jynx, and Rotom also neuters Bronzor as, in addition to losing Eviolite, it is locked into whatever move it chooses, making it much easier to take advantage of.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is an essential move for any team, and Bronzor is decent user of the move thanks to its ability to set it up on a multitude of threats such as Jynx, Steelix, and Rhydon. Psywave is Bronzor's best move at dealing damage, though it's inconsistent, as it deals anywhere between 50 and 150 HP. Toxic is useful for letting Bronzor beat Musharna and Rhydon one-on-one and gives it a means to cripple Fire- and Dark-type switch-ins with the exception of Skuntank and Malamar. Rest gives Bronzor a way to recover off damage sustained, letting it continually pivot into the Pokemon it needs to, as well as allowing it to outlast the likes of Musharna and Steelix. Skill Swap is an alternative that lets Bronzor set up Stealth Rock versus Xatu as well as be able to cripple it with Toxic.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Bronzor's special bulk, allowing it to switch into the likes of Mesprit, Vivillon, Aurorus, Swellow, and Jynx with ease. Bronzor usually doesn't need Defense EVs as it already avoids 3HKOs from physical attackers that can't hit it hard enough, such as most Tauros and Archeops, while Bronzor shouldn't stay in against physical attackers that can, such as Knock Off users like Hariyama and Shiftry, or setup sweepers such as Samurott and Barbaracle.  Levitate is crucial for the Ground immunity, increasing the number of Pokemon Bronzor is able to wall. Eviolite is used to further increase Bronzor's already substantial bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Bronzor's typing to pivot into Pokemon such as Jynx, Mesprit, Rhydon, Steelix, and Tauros, and set up Stealth Rock. If Stealth Rock is already set up, throw out a Toxic or a Psywave depending on the circumstances. Also be sure to not directly switch into Jynx until a teammate is put to sleep. Though switching into Jynx and Mesprit is generally safe, try to watch out for Trick from either of them, as being tricked a Choice item completely neuters Bronzor. Be wary of Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank and Liepard, especially the former, as it completely walls Bronzor. Against Liepard, either double switch to a teammate that can take it on, or hit it with Toxic on the switch to put it on a timer. There's also the possibility that Skuntank may be special, meaning it's not nearly as much of a threat to Bronzor, so try to figure out what set it may be from looking at Team Preview. Once Bronzor is low on HP, use Rest to bring it back to full; just be aware that Bronzor will be passive during the two turns it is asleep and thus can be setup fodder or a free opportunity to switch in for dangerous Pokemon. Without Skill Swap, generally avoid using any status move if Xatu is in Team Preview, as Bronzor does not have the means of breaking through it. However, if Skill Swap is being used, it is best to use it on the switch so that it lets Bronzor force out Xatu in fear of Toxic and grants the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. Keep in mind that on stall teams, Bronzor does not have to be played nearly as aggressively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bronzor best fits on stall teams, as they do not mind its passive nature and can easily account for its flaws. Sliggoo and Altaria are particularly effective partners due to their ability to freely switch into Fire-types such as Magmortar and Pyroar, while Bronzor is able to switch in on Pokemon such as Jynx, Abomasnow, and Aurorus, all Pokemon that prey on their Ice weaknesses. Poison-types such as Skuntank and Weezing switch into Dark-types reasonably well, and both provide some extra utility with Pursuit and Toxic Spikes, respectively. Weezing also walls Pursuit Skuntank and takes pressure off Bronzor by crippling physical attackers such as Rhydon and Tauros with Will-O-Wisp. Mega Audino provides Wish support so that Bronzor is less dependent on Rest to restore lost HP or is able to wake it up with Heal Bell. It also is a great switch-in to all Dark-types barring Skuntank.</p> <p>Bronzor can also work on balanced teams as long as the team can account for its passivity. Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Hariyama are great teammates for their ability to take hits from Dark-types and KO them back. Hariyama also switches into Magmortar and non-Will-O-Wisp Pyroar, both Pokemon that fear little from Bronzor and deal heavy damage if not accounted for otherwise. In return, Bronzor switches into the likes of Mesprit, Jynx, and Vivillon with near-impunity. Swords Dance Samurott is able to revenge kill Magmortar and Pyroar, while Bronzor acts a good switch for Grass-types such as Lilligant, Vileplume, and Ferroseed, all of which are capable of stopping Samurott from sweeping the opposition. Liepard and Skuntank are able to Pursuit trap the likes of Rotom and Mismagius, both of which can wear down Bronzor with burns and hit it with a full-powered Hex while it is asleep.</p>"

  "Chatot": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its access to STAB Boomburst, one of the strongest Normal-type attacks in the game, Chatot sets itself apart as one of the most destructive wallbreakers in the tier. Chatot's offensive tools, such as Heat Wave, Nasty Plot, and U-turn, give it options against common Normal-resistant foes, such as Klinklang and Ferroseed. Chatter, despite not offering as much coverage as Heat Wave, is usable because of its unique ability to simultaneously inflict damage and cause confusion. Unfortunately, Chatot's Speed tier, while allowing it to outspeed some threats such as Lilligant and Mesprit, often leaves it outpaced by other offensive Pokemon, such as Tauros, Floatzel, and Scyther. Chatot faces stiff competition from Choice Specs Swellow as an offensive Normal-type because of its inferior Speed and Swellow's access to Scrappy, although Chatot's Boomburst hits nearly twice as hard as Swellow's. Chatot sports an unfortunate defensive typing and poor defenses, making it easier to revenge kill. Additionally, its abilities are almost completely worthless, usually having little to no positive impact on Chatot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Encore is a nice alternative on the Substitute set to lock the foe into a passive move, such as Stealth Rock or Swords Dance, giving Chatot an opportunity to set up. A set with Boomburst / Heat Wave / Hidden Power Grass / Agility can make it hard for faster offensive Pokemon to revenge kill Chatot. Alternatively, you can use Tailwind to boost Chatot and its teammates' Speed for a limited number of turns. Silk Scarf can be used in place of Choice Specs if you dislike being Choice-locked. However, this makes Chatot's Boomburst significantly weaker.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Misdreavus, Mismagius, and Rotom are all immune to Boomburst and take neutral damage from Chatot's coverage moves; Rotom even resists Chatter.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Bulky Rock-types, such as Regirock and Rhydon, comfortably switch into Boomburst and Chatot's coverage moves. However, Rhydon has to watch out for Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: If Chatot doesn't have a Substitute up, it's threatened by any offensive Pokemon faster than it, such as Archeops, Floatzel, and Electivire, and priority attacks from the likes of Kangaskhan, Samurott, and Shiftry because of its poor bulk.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Chatot will lose a quarter of its HP every time it switches into Stealth Rock, limiting how long it can stay on the field.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Boomburst is an absurdly powerful STAB move for Chatot with virtually no downsides. Even frailer Pokemon that resist Boomburst, such as Pawniard and Mawile, are 2HKOed by it. Heat Wave provides coverage against bulkier Steel-types, such as Klinklang and Ferroseed, as well as Gourgeist-S and Gourgeist-XL. Hidden Power Grass is Chatot's only option for scoring a 2HKO on Tank Rhydon. U-turn maintains momentum if you haven't properly whittled down Chatot's safe switch-ins. Chatter can be very disruptive because of its guaranteed confusion rate, but it should be noted that a super effective Chatter is weaker than a neutral Boomburst.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Running maximum Special Attack investment is a given to ensure all of Chatot's attacks do as much damage as possible. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Chatot to outspeed the likes of Lilligant, Zangoose, and other offensive Pokemon with a base Speed of up to 90. Choice Specs maximizes Chatot's Special Attack to ensure its coverage attacks and, more importantly, Boomburst hit as hard as possible. Chatot's abilities are mostly worthless, but Tangled Feet can give it a lucky break for a turn against opposing Chatot with Chatter.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Boomburst is usually the safest option for Chatot to use because of the ridiculous amount of damage it does even on resisted hits. However, if your opponent has a very solid Boomburst switch-in, Chatot can use U-turn to gain momentum on the switch. Chatot is quite frail, so be careful about letting it take Stealth Rock damage because it might push it into the KO range of a priority attack from the likes of Hitmonchan, Shiftry, and Kabutops. Chatot should not switch into most attacks, but it can capitalize on Choice-locked Ghost- and Ground-type attacks, such as Rotom's Shadow Ball and Torterra's Earthquake. Because of how frail Chatot is, teammates with slow momentum-gaining moves, such as Lanturn with Volt Switch and Mesprit with U-turn, are useful assets for bringing it in safely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock and Spikes goes a long way for Chatot because its common switch-ins rarely have reliable recovery. Garbodor and Ferroseed make especially great partners for Chatot because of their ability to both set up Spikes and punish priority users, which are used to revenge kill Chatot, thanks to Rocky Helmet and Iron Barbs damage, respectively. Rapid Spin or Defog support from the likes of Hitmonchan and Skuntank is appreciated because of Chatot's weakness to Stealth Rock. Special Defog Skuntank is a worthy mention because of its ability to lure in Steel-types and Rhydon and surprise them with Fire Blast and Hidden Power Grass. Bulky Ground-types, such as Claydol and Sandslash, are great switch-ins for the difficult Rock-types that hard wall Chatot, not to mention Claydol's and Sandslash's ability to provide Rapid Spin support. Teammates that have slow momentum-gaining moves, such as Lanturn with Volt Switch and Xatu with U-turn form tight VoltTurn cores with Chatot. Expert Belt Rotom-S is a notable partner because of its access to Volt Switch and ability to lure Rhydon, a common check to Choice Specs Chatot, and heavily damage it with Hidden Power Grass. Pursuit support from the likes of Skuntank and Liepard can trap Ghost-types so Chatot can comfortably use Boomburst. Late-game cleaners that share similar switch-ins to Chatot, such as Archeops, Tauros, and Swellow, appreciate the extra damage on the aforementioned switch-ins.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Chatot's Special Attack to terrifying levels. Substitute can provide a safety net for Chatot so it can safely fire off an attack of its own or set up with Nasty Plot. Additionally, it is a good option for punishing Sucker Punch users. Boomburst is insanely powerful when it's backed by a Nasty Plot boost. Chatter disrupts the opponent by inflicting damage and causing confusion, and it is Chatot's best way to handle Ghost-types, which don't fear Boomburst. Heat Wave can be used to hit Steel-types, such as Klinklang and Ferroseed, which resist Boomburst.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment is preferred because Chatot wants to hit as hard as it can. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature ensures Chatot does not miss out on the benefits of its great Speed tier, such as outspeeding Mesprit and Lilligant. Leftovers helps recover a bit of the health lost from Substitute and Stealth Rock damage. Tangled Feet is mostly worthless, but it can come into play against opposing Chatot with Chatter.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Even without a boosting item, Chatot can create offensive pressure thanks to Boomburst, allowing it to set up a Substitute. Don't be overly aggressive by letting Chatot take a hit to set up a Nasty Plot or Substitute, as it shouldn't be taking any hits it doesn't need to due to its frailty. Chatter can punish switch-ins to Boomburst, such as Mismagius and Rhydon, by inflicting confusion. Chatot can use the free turns confusion can generate to set up with Substitute or Nasty Plot. Chatot appreciates being brought in with slow, momentum-gaining moves, such as Volt Switch from Lanturn and U-turn from Pelipper.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Ground-types, such as Claydol, Sandslash, and Torterra, switch into the Rock-types that handle Chatot so well. These Pokemon also provide an immunity to Electric-type attacks, which give Chatot trouble. Claydol and Sandslash can also provide Rapid Spin support to keep Stealth Rock off the field. Pursuit support from the likes of Skuntank and Liepard is helpful to trap the Ghost-types that can switch in safely on Boomburst. Rapid Spin or Defog from the likes of Skuntank and Hitmonchan can keep Stealth Rock off the field for Chatot. Special Defog Skuntank can also lure Rock- and Steel-types for Chatot and hit them with Hidden Power Grass and Fire Blast. Offensive Flying- and Normal-types, such as Archeops and Kangaskhan, whittle down shared switch-ins to Chatot, such as Rhydon and Regirock.</p>"

  "Hippopotas": {
    "overview": "<p>Hippopotas find its place in NU as a very reliable sand setter, and the only one with Sand Stream. A decent defensive typing, access to Stealth Rock, and reliable recovery in Slack Off makes it a reliable, albeit specific, team supporter. However, due to its low base stats, it's fairly frail even when invested, and is prone to being set up on unless it runs a phazing move. Its typing leaves Hippopotas weak to common special Water- and Grass-type moves. Because of the unique support it gives, it only fits on a certain type of team and fails to do much other than set up sand.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hippopotas doesn't have much else to offer. A set with Bulldoze is possible to lower the opponent's Speed for a bit more team support. Sandstorm can also be used to beat opposing weather starters that try to remove the sand that Hippopotas sets up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Weather Starters</strong>: Opposing weather starters can replace the sand Hippopotas sets up with a different weather.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: As Hippopotas will be switching in and out a lot, it's easy to wear it down with Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Stealth Rock as it has no passive recovery.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Any powerful special attacker will take Hippopotas out in a few hits, even with neutral STAB moves. Most Pokemon with a special super effective move can easily deal with it.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Moves</strong>: Both physical and special super effective moves can easily take non-Eviolite Hippopotas out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sand Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock gives Hippopotas entry hazards support, and damages Flying-types, which are immune to Earthquake. Whirlwind can phaze out anything that tries to set up on Hippopotas and racks up hazard damage. Yawn can be used instead of Whirlwind to force switches. It's more unreliable, but it can spread sleep and help bring in team members safely on predicted double switches or on sleeping Pokemon. Slack Off is reliable recovery and ensures that Hippopotas stays healthy thoughout the game. Earthquake hits Rock- and Steel-types decently hard, but it should rarely be used, as Hippopotas has a low Attack stat. Toxic can be used as a more reliable way to damage the opposing team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Smooth Rock extends the turns of sand from five to eight, which in most situations is preferable over the extra bulk from Eviolite. Sand Stream is mandatory, as it is the only reason to use Hippopotas. Eviolite can be used over Smooth Rock to give Hippopotas better overall bulk. However, Eviolite forces Hippopotas to switch in more to keep up sand.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hippopotas is used for the support it gives its team, so it should be in as little as possible when sand is already up to avoid wasting sand turns. However, it can still set up Stealth Rock or take on weaker physical attackers if needed. Note that even with defensive investment Hippopotas is fairly frail, so avoid strong attackers and powerful moves. When switching Hippopotas in make sure it will survive the entry hazards damage as Sand Stream activates after hazards damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that work well with Hippopotas can take advantage of the sand it brings. Sand Rush users such as Stoutland and Sandslash are a must, as they become dangerous sweepers with boosted Speed under sand. Rock-types such as Cradily, Rhydon, and Carracosta get their Special Defense boosted by the sand, allowing them to more effectively do their jobs. Other options to consider are Pokemon with Sand Veil such as Cacturne that benefit from the evasion boost that sand gives it. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Mega Audino that can take common Grass- and Water-type moves aimed at Hippopotas can support it. A Pokemon with Sandstorm can be used to relieve the pressure on Hippopotas. While it is not mandatory as Hippopotas can function without it, Rapid Spin or Defog support helps it to switch in more times throughout a game.</p>"

  "Abomasnow": {
    "overview": "<p>Abomasnow's excellent offensive typing combined with high-powered STAB attacks and decent mixed offensive stats makes it an extremely dangerous wallbreaker that can break down common defensive cores. Being able to run both specially and physically based sets makes Abomasnow highly unpredictable and difficult to switch into with Pokemon that have one high defensive stat and an exploitable lower one, such as Steelix, Mantine, and Hariyama. Furthermore, Snow Warning is an extremely useful ability that stacks chip damage on the enemy's non-Ice-types, prevents targets such as Musharna and Vileplume from healing effectively, breaks Focus Sash and Sturdy on Pokemon like Omastar, Archeops, and Steelix, and allows Blizzard to be used reliably over Ice Beam as Abomasnow's Ice-type attack of choice. It can also shut down weather teams and standalone sweepers such as Ludicolo quite effectively, so long as Abomasnow gets an opportunity to switch in. While these attributes combine to make Abomasnow a potent offensive threat, its multiple weaknesses to common attacking types, particularly Fire, Fighting, and Rock, make it difficult for it to capitalize on its decent defensive stats and to fit into a balanced team. For example, it makes a poor general check to Water-types, such as Samurott, Kabutops, and Floatzel, because of its vulnerability to their coverage or secondary STAB moves, in addition to disliking Scald burns from defensive Water-types such as Lanturn and Prinplup. When combined with a mediocre Speed stat, this makes Abomasnow very easy to revenge kill after it scores a KO. With sufficient team support, Abomasnow can find many opportunities to break holes in the opponent's cores, but without this it can also be dead weight against certain matchups, making it a risky choice compared to other wallbreakers such as Magmortar.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Grass Knot and Energy Ball are powerful special Grass-type attacks, with Grass Knot being especially good against heavy targets such as Aurorus, Hariyama, and Regirock. However, Giga Drain is generally preferred, as its healing offsets Abomasnow's vulnerability to residual damage, and it's strong enough against most of its targets for the extra power provided by other moves to be mostly unnecessary. Focus Blast can be used to hit Normal- and Steel-types, such as Pyroar, Miltank, and Ferroseed, harder than usual, but its low accuracy is annoying and Abomasnow is already strapped for moveslots as it is. Ice Punch can be used to provide Abomasnow with a more powerful physical Ice-type attack, especially on the Swords Dance set, but Blizzard's damage output is generally superior in this metagame. Substitute + Leech Seed can let Abomasnow capitalize on the switches it forces and stack residual damage with hail, but the ease of breaking its Substitutes and its low Speed often make this set less effective than a direct attacking set. A set with Substitute and three attacks can be used instead, as such a set can capitalize more effectively on the switches Abomasnow forces, but it will sorely miss the utility of the move it replaces, usually Earthquake or Ice Shard. Growth boosts Abomasnow's Special Attack as well as its Attack, but Swords Dance makes more efficient use of a single turn of setup, and an unboosted Blizzard is usually powerful enough to break through any physically bulky Pokemon that could take a +2 Seed Bomb. Finally, a specially based Choice Scarf set with Snow Warning can be used as a deterrent against weather sweepers such as Ludicolo, Kabutops, and Victreebel, but it has limited use against non-weather teams due to its inability to switch moves, the attribute that makes Abomasnow so dangerous in the first place.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Most Fire-type Pokemon can switch into Abomasnow's STAB attacks and OHKO it easily with their Fire-type attack of choice, provided they can avoid switching into Earthquake. Assault Vest Magmortar can comfortably take Blizzards, while Charizard can switch into Grass-type attacks and Earthquake with impunity.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Klinklang can switch into anything other than Earthquake, outspeed Abomasnow, and either KO it with Gear Grind or start to set up, while Metang can take any unboosted hit and retaliate with Meteor Mash. Ferroseed can also take a Blizzard, or two if specially defensive, and retaliate with Gyro Ball or Thunder Wave, taking little from Abomasnow's other attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Abomasnow's only defense against faster revenge killers is Ice Shard, and this is usually not powerful enough to OHKO them outright without a boost. Primeape, Kangaskhan, and Tauros can all take an Ice Shard with ease and force Abomasnow out with their STAB attacks or Fire Blast from Tauros.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Abomasnow gets worn down very quickly due to recoil from Life Orb and potentially Wood Hammer, so setting Stealth Rock and Spikes will help to whittle it down even faster. Burning or poisoning it will also reduce the number of turns it can stay in and fire off its powerful attacks, as will inflicting chip damage with Fake Out from Kangaskhan.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blizzard is Abomasnow's most powerful attack, and it hits a lot of physically defensive targets, such as Vileplume, Steelix, and Musharna, for good damage, as well as most other offensive Pokemon. Giga Drain provides Abomasnow with a strong Grass-type STAB move that doesn't inflict heavy recoil, unlike Wood Hammer, and generally deals enough damage to common targets such as Lanturn, Samurott, and opposing Ice-types such as Aurorus to be effective. Earthquake is a useful physical coverage move that hits Fire-types such as Assault Vest Magmortar, Pyroar, and Combusken as they attempt to switch into Abomasnow and KO it. It also deals a decent amount of damage to Assault Vest Hariyama, which can otherwise handle specially based Abomasnow. Ice Shard provides a countermeasure against faster offensive threats that might try to revenge kill Abomasnow, such as Shiftry, Lilligant, Swellow, and Archeops, as well as deterring setup sweepers such as Vivillon and Lilligant. Wood Hammer is a powerful physical attack that hits the specially defensive targets that can take Abomasnow's special attacks, particularly Assault Vest Hariyama, extremely hard. However, the extreme recoil from Wood Hammer combined with the high HP of Abomasnow's targets often prevents it from attacking more than once with the move without KOing itself, and Giga Drain's recovery generally makes it more useful as a Grass-type attack.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Hasty nature allow Abomasnow to outspeed neutral-natured Samurott and Barbaracle, preventing them from setting up or KOing it. The Special Attack stat is then maximized to ensure that Abomasnow's main STAB attacks hit as hard as possible, and the remaining EVs are invested in Attack to improve the power of its physical coverage options. A Hasty nature is similarly chosen to preserve its Attack stat, as Abomasnow will rarely utilize its Defense stat effectively due to its type weaknesses. A Mild nature can be used to give Abomasnow's main attacks more power, particularly against bulky neutral targets such as Mega Audino, but it doesn't secure any more notable KOs and losing against physical Samurott and Barbaracle is not pleasant. Snow Warning is the ability of choice, as it not only allows Blizzard to be used with 100% accuracy but also lets Abomasnow inflict chip damage after it attacks, breaking Focus Sashes and Sturdy while increasing damage output in general, for both itself and its teammates for Hail's duration. Life Orb is used to maximize Abomasnow's damage output against neutral targets.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Abomasnow should be used early in the game to break down balanced defensive cores that rely on a physically defensive Pokemon, such as Weezing, paired with a specially defensive Pokemon, such as Magmortar. Abomasnow can deal good damage to either member on its weak defensive stat if you predict correctly, forcing the opponent into a 50-50 situation. Abomasnow should not usually try to switch into foes, unless it is obvious that the opponent will use a move that can't directly hurt it, such as Stealth Rock or Taunt. Abomasnow can also switch into Water-, Grass-, and Electric-type attacks, such as Lilligant's Giga Drain, but it should avoid switching into Scald or Volt Switch for fear of being burned and of the opponent switching in a deadly response. Abomasnow should usually come in either after a teammate has been KOed by a vulnerable threat (such as Swellow or Quagsire) or after a teammate uses U-turn, Volt Switch, Healing Wish, or Memento, to minimize Abomasnow's chances of being KOed by a stray coverage move. Giga Drain should be used when Abomasnow is at low health to prevent it from KOing itself with recoil from Stealth Rock, Life Orb, and potential Scald burns if it switches into bulky Water-types.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Abomasnow is highly vulnerable to entry hazards, but it also appreciates having them on the opposing team's side to give it an easier time with wallbreaking. Rapid Spin users such as Hitmonchan and Claydol can keep them off the field while providing good offensive synergy with their STAB attacks. Defog users such as Pelipper and Mantine can also be good teammates, boasting better defensive synergy with Abomasnow while still threatening most Fire-types, and Pelipper can also use its slow U-turn to bring Abomasnow into battle safely. Entry hazard setters can help Abomasnow's team capitalize on the hail it provides by inflicting masses of chip damage as foes try to switch into Abomasnow's attacks. Garbodor and Weezing can take on Fighting-types while laying Spikes or Toxic Spikes, while Mesprit can similarly lay Stealth Rock. Teammates that can use a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Pelipper, Mesprit, and Lanturn, can help Abomasnow enter combat and start tearing up teams without risking being hit by a coverage move. Mesprit is a particularly good choice, as it can also provide Stealth Rock support, a solid Fighting-type resistance, Thunder Wave support to paralyze faster threats and make them vulnerable to Abomasnow's strongest moves, and Healing Wish to give Abomasnow more chances to wallbreak throughout the match. Lanturn and Mega Audino can also provide Thunder Wave support, while the latter can additionally use Healing Wish while luring in Steel-types and KOing them with Fire Blast. Finally, teammates that can capitalize on hail support, such as Rotom-F, Clefairy, and offensive cleaners and setup sweepers that appreciate the residual damage, such as Kangaskhan and Jynx, also appreciate Abomasnow's presence.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Abomasnow to become a deadly physical threat, allowing its Ice Shard to pick off a much wider range of targets that outspeed it and letting it break through most defensive Pokemon without prediction. Ice Shard allows Abomasnow to potentially sweep after a boost or two due to its priority and lack of resistances, and it hits faster targets such as Shiftry, Lilligant, Swellow, and Archeops. It also lets Abomasnow force out other setup sweepers, such as Vivillon, Scyther, and Lilligant, providing itself with opportunities to set up instead. Seed Bomb is a consistent Grass-type attack that deals good damage after a boost, doesn't inflict recoil like Wood Hammer does, is usually powerful enough to get the job done, and lets Abomasnow KO multiple Pokemon without KOing itself afterwards. However, even at +2 Seed Bomb requires Stealth Rock, a round of Hail damage, or an Adamant or Lonely nature to OHKO Hariyama. Blizzard is used to let Abomasnow 2HKO physically bulky threats such as Weezing and Steelix without boosting, as well as OHKO bulky Grass-types such as Vileplume and Gourgeist-XL that could otherwise take a +2 Ice Shard. It also provides Abomasnow with a strong Ice-type attack for immediate use when boosting or priority isn't required. Earthquake can be used instead so that Abomasnow can hit Fire- and Steel-types such as Pyroar, Combusken, and Klinklang as they attempt to switch in, providing better coverage in general, but it isn't too useful after the first turn, as most of its targets can outspeed and KO Abomasnow before it can use it, boosted or not.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Hasty nature is used to surprise threats such as Samurott and Barbaracle and either KO them with Seed Bomb or force them out and secure a Swords Dance boost. The nature also preserves Abomasnow's Special Attack stat, as it shouldn't be taking too many physical hits anyway and doesn't need the extra Defense, but a Jolly nature can be used to preserve its Defense stat instead if Blizzard isn't used. Attack is then fully invested in so that Abomasnow has as much power as possible to sweep or wallbreak with. A Lonely nature, or an Adamant nature if not using Blizzard, can be used to boost Abomasnow's Attack stat if the extra damage is more useful to you than outspeeding Samurott and Barbaracle. For example, an Attack-boosting nature gives Abomasnow a good chance to OHKO Aurorus with Seed Bomb without a boost. Life Orb is the best item choice because it helps Abomasnow inflict more damage against neutral targets than the likes of Expert Belt and Never-Melt Ice. Lum Berry is also a decent choice, as it lets Abomasnow switch into Scald users, as well as threats such as Mismagius and Rotom, and set up Swords Dance semi-reliably against these targets. Snow Warning is an obvious choice when using Blizzard, but it is also an option when running a different move in that slot, as it still increases residual damage as well as breaking Steelix's Sturdy and diminishing Musharna's recovery from Moonlight. However, Swords Dance Abomasnow is more likely to OHKO opponents outright and doesn't appreciate this as much as mixed Abomasnow does. Soundproof is a good alternative if Blizzard isn't being used that provides Abomasnow with some unusual setup opportunities, such as against Swellow's Boomburst and Choice Specs Pyroar's and Aurorus's Hyper Voice.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swords Dance Abomasnow should be conserved until Pokemon that can threaten its sweep, such as Kangaskhan, Magmortar, and Will-O-Wisp users, have been dealt with. Earthquake can be used to hit Fire-types if they attempt to switch in, but the opponent will most likely bring them into a boosted Abomasnow after it has KOed a teammate, as it is unlikely to KO them with Ice Shard after they have come in. Abomasnow should generally aim to blow holes in the opponent's team so that a more consistent sweeper or cleaner can have an easier time with its defensive checks weakened or removed. Abomasnow can also use a boosted Ice Shard to seriously cripple offensive responses, such as Choice Scarf Primeape, so that a teammate such as Kangaskhan, Samurott, or Skuntank can break through them later with another priority attack. Abomasnow should use Swords Dance when it forces a switch against an Ice Shard target such as Swellow or when it is against a passive defensive Pokemon that can't hit it for good damage, such as Calm Mind Musharna or Mega Audino without Fire Blast.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Follow-up sweepers and cleaners really appreciate Abomasnow's ability to break through bulky Pokemon and wear down speedier responses with Ice Shard. Swellow can KO physically defensive Pokemon that can take Abomasnow's attacks while also appreciating the pressure on Rock- and Steel-types due to Abomasnow's coverage. Meanwhile, other wallbreakers of your own such as Magmortar and Samurott are useful for softening up the opponent's defensive checks to Abomasnow, making it easier for it to sweep on its own. This is important because many threats that Abomasnow fails to beat can KO it in return due to its many weaknesses. Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Claydol can remove entry hazards from Abomasnow's path and let it use Wood Hammer more often before KOing itself with the recoil, as well as tank certain attacks such as Hydro Pump. Entry hazards of your own can complement Abomasnow's sweeping capabilities, drawing offensive targets closer to Ice Shard's KO range. Omastar can reliably set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes for an offensive team, whereas Archeops can provide Stealth Rock support while dealing with other hazard teams and blowing holes in teams with STAB Head Smash and Endeavor. Healing Wish users such as Mesprit and Mega Audino are also highly useful for giving Abomasnow more opportunities to sweep or wallbreak in a match. These two candidates can also provide Thunder Wave support so that Abomasnow can use its more powerful attacks against vulnerable foes.</p>"

  "Electivire": {
    "overview": "<p>Electivire is well known for its wide movepool allowing it to hit most Pokemon for super effective damage. Due to Electivire's good attacking stats, it is able to utilize both its physical and special coverage options to run an effective mixed wallbreaker set. Electivire's niche doesn't end there, as it possesses a nice Speed tier, which gives it solid wallbreaking capabilities and makes it a decent balance breaker. However, it's worth noting that Electivire's relatively low Special Attack forces it to rely on super effective coverage to break past bulkier foes, meaning bulky Pokemon that Electivire lacks coverage against such as Musharna and Mega Audino can stop it in its tracks. Moreover, possessing only a couple of resistances, poor bulk, and middling Speed, Electivire struggles versus offensive teams and finds itself forced out by faster Pokemon such as Tauros, Archeops, Swellow, and Charizard. It faces competition as an Electric-type from other Electric-types like Rotom and Lanturn, which provide a huge amount of defensive utility to teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Volt Switch can be used instead of Hidden Power Grass, as it gives offensive momentum and the ability to pivot away from bulky Pokemon, which often switch into Electivire. Keep in mind that the remaining members on your party should be able to deal with bulky Ground-types. Ice coverage is a nice way to deal with Dragon-types such as Altaria and Sliggoo, as they are often specially bulky, and Ice Punch is a better way to deal with them due to their high Special Defense stats; however, the damage output against Pokemon such as Rhydon and Gastrodon is much lower. Focus Blast can be considered to hit Pokemon such as Aurorus, Regirock, and Piloswine for a lot more damage than Earthquake and Hidden Power Grass. Another reason to consider this move is that it has a high chance to OHKO Steelix after entry hazards or a little bit of damage. However, the move tends to be unreliable due to accuracy issues, which makes this option generally not worth it. Electivire is able to run a physically based mixed set to further distinguish itself from Manectric, as it possesses a great base Attack combined with a solid movepool. The set that gives the best coverage is Earthquake, Ice Punch, Wild Charge, and Hidden Power Grass, although the first two moves can be replaced by Fire Punch and Iron Tail and still maintain decent coverage; Iron Tail allows Electivire to hit Mega Audino, with a high chance of 2HKOing it if Stealth Rock is up. Expert Belt can be used over Life Orb for more longevity or to bluff a Choice item, but the power loss is notable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority and Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that naturally outspeed Electivire such as Tauros, Archeops, and Pyroar are all able to revenge kill it, though none of these Pokemon can safely switch in. Electivire's poor Defense stat allows strong priority to threaten it such as Hitmonchan's Mach Punch, Shiftry's Sucker Punch, and Samurott's Aqua Jet. They can deal even more damage if Electivire runs a Hasty nature.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Audino, Musharna, and Malamar are not 2HKOed by any of Electivire's attacks and can even use it as setup bait for Calm Mind and Superpower, respectively. Mega Audino and Musharna can also stall Electivire with Life Orb recoil by recovering HP with Wish and Moonlight, while Malamar can Knock Off its Life Orb and stall it out with Rest. Regirock takes all of Electivire's attacks very well, avoiding the 2HKO from Earthquake, and threatens Electivire with its own Earthquake, although it still needs to watch out for the rare Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Claydol and Piloswine are some of the best answers for Electivire, as both can survive any two hits and retaliate back with their STAB moves of choice to deal heavy damage. Rhydon and Gastrodon are shakier checks, as both are 2HKOed by Hidden Power Grass, but they can take any other attack plus one Hidden Power Grass and threaten Electivire with a Ground-type STAB move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>A physically based set is easier to wall in this metagame, so this set relies mostly on Electivire's special movepool. Thunderbolt hits most Pokemon that do not resist it for decent damage, especially physically defensive targets such as Weezing, and it lacks Wild Charge's recoil, making it preferable in most situations. Flamethrower has good coverage alongside Thunderbolt, hitting Grass- and Steel-types such as Gourgeist-XL, Vileplume, Torterra, Steelix, and Ferroseed. Earthquake allows Electivire to deal significant damage to Electric-types such as Lanturn and Fire-types such as Camerupt and Assault Vest Magmortar, and is Electivire's main niche over its rival Manectric. It's also worth mentioning that Earthquake 2HKOes Assault Vest Hariyama with a bit of prior damage, which many teams rely on to deal with special attackers. Hidden Power Grass completes Electivire's coverage by hitting Gastrodon and Rhydon, which otherwise wall this set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs plus a Speed-boosting nature make Electivire as fast as possible, letting it outspeed Pokemon such as Rotom, Kangaskhan, and Vivillon, while maximum Special Attack EVs are preferable because Pokemon that tend to switch into Electivire have a higher Defense stat. The rest is dumped into Attack to power up Earthquake and deal more damage to special walls with the move. A Hasty nature is chosen over a Naive nature as Electivire takes heavy damage from physical attacks regardless, whereas Electivire can switch more comfortably into Electric-types and sleep inducers, which are often special attackers such as Vivillon and Lilligant. Keep in mind that a Hasty nature makes Electivire even weaker to common priority such as Hitmonchan's Mach Punch and Shiftry's Sucker Punch, however, and a Naive nature is a completely viable option. Motor Drive gives Electivire an immunity to Electric-type moves and can be really useful against Pokemon such as Lanturn and Rotom, as getting a Speed boost allows Electivire to clean weakened teams late-game. Vital Spirit should be considered as well to avoid being put to sleep by Vivillon's Sleep Powder and Jynx's Lovely Kiss. Life Orb is used to give a needed boost to Electivire's attacks while allowing it to switch between its moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Electivire's poor bulk, it appreciates being brought in safely by Volt Switch and U-turn from pivoting teammates, or after a Pokemon has fainted. It can also be brought in on a predicted Electric-type move, such as Rotom's or Lanturn's Volt Switch, if it runs Motor Drive, and receive a free boost in Speed, preventing foes such as Tauros and Swellow from checking it effectively. Another way of getting Electivire in for free is on a predicted sleep-inducing move, such as Vivillon's Sleep Powder or Jynx's Lovely Kiss, if it runs Vital Spirit. Electivire should be used on offensive teams due to its lack of defensive merit outside of its immunities, and balanced teams are generally better off with Magmortar for a coverage-based wallbreaker due to its higher Special Attack and subsequent ability to make good use out of Assault Vest. Make sure to predict correctly between Electivire's coverage moves, as it can be worn down quickly by Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support is crucial to ensure some KOs; for example, after three layers of Spikes, Flamethrower has a high chance to OHKO Steelix. The best Spiker Electivire can have as a teammate is Garbodor because it can deal with Mega Audino's attacks with relative ease and set up layers of Spikes or Toxic Spikes. Other good partners for Electivire with access to Stealth Rock are Mesprit and Torterra, as these Pokemon are able to switch into Ground-type moves, which threaten Electivire, and form a nice defensive synergy with Garbodor. Mesprit also has access to Healing Wish, which can be useful late-game if Electivire is needed but is too weakened. Lilligant has the ability to force out Ground-types, which creates a setup opportunity for Electivire to weaken bulky Pokemon, while Electivire can put pressure on Lilligant's checks such as Vileplume and Assault Vest Magmortar with its respective coverage option. Scyther and Swellow are great partners for Electivire, as they can U-turn out on a predicted check, such as Steelix, Regirock, Rotom, or Rhydon, and bring in Electivire, which threatens all of them with the appropriate coverage move. Scyther is also immune to Ground-types and can use the bulky Pokemon that Electivire struggles to break such as Musharna and Mega Audino as setup fodder. Other U-turn users are Primeape and Archeops, which form a VoltTurn core with Electivire if you choose Volt Switch in its last slot. Strong wallbreakers such as Aurorus and Samurott form a good offensive core with Electivire, as they deal with bulky Ground-types. Fast offensive Pokemon such as Swellow and Floatzel also benefit from Electivire's ability to block Thunder Wave.</p>"

  "Magmortar": {
    "overview": "<p>With its tremendous Special Attack and expansive coverage, Magmortar sets itself apart as one of the most terrifying wallbreakers in NU. Excellent mixed attacking stats and diverse coverage options, such as Thunderbolt, Earthquake, and Focus Blast, allow Magmortar to hit most of the tier for at least neutral damage. Magmortar's ability, Vital Spirit, allows it to safely switch in on sleep-inducing moves such as Sleep Powder from the likes of Vileplume and Lilligant, as well as Lovely Kiss from Jynx. Respectable special bulk alongside a decent defensive typing allows Magmortar to check a number of special Ice-, Grass-, and Fire-type threats. Magmortar sports a Speed tier just fast enough to outspeed some relevant offensive Pokemon, such as Shiftry, Mesprit, and Kabutops. However, its Speed and lacking Defense typically leave it helpless against faster, physically oriented Pokemon, such as Scyther, Tauros, and Archeops. Magmortar's pure Fire typing also leaves it weak to Stealth Rock and vulnerable to Spikes with no reliable way to heal back the damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magmortar can use a set consisting of Belly Drum / Fire Punch / Mach Punch / Earthquake to boost its Attack to +6 and attempt to sweep despite having very few setup opportunities. Psychic is an option on the Life Orb set to 2HKO Hariyama, which avoids a 2HKO from Magmortar's other moves. A Sunny Day set consisting of Sunny Day / Fire Blast / Solar Beam / Thunderbolt can be used to boost Magmortar's Fire Blast and give it access to a powerful 120 Base Power Grass-type attack in Solar Beam for Rock- and Water-types. Substitute avoids Sucker Punch and can let Magmortar take a hit. A Choice Band set with Flare Blitz / Earthquake / Mach Punch / Cross Chop hits fairly hard with a strong STAB move, solid coverage, and a respectable Attack stat, although it's mostly outclassed by Flareon. Will-O-Wisp can cripple Thick Fat Hariyama, Regirock, and Rhydon as an alternative to a coverage move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Archeops, Tauros, and Kangaskhan all outspeed Magmortar provided it has not gained a Speed boost from Flame Charge and can OHKO it. Users of strong priority moves, such as Shiftry, Hitmonchan, and Kangaskhan, and especially strong Pokemon with Aqua Jet, such as Samurott and Kabutops, also put a lot of pressure on Magmortar regardless of any Flame Charge boosts.</p> <p><strong>Thick Fat Users</strong>: Due to Thick Fat, Assault Vest Hariyama and Grumpig tank all of Magmortar's common coverage moves and threaten it with Close Combat and Thunder Wave, respectively. However, Hariyama fears uncommon options such as Will-O-Wisp and Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Rock-types</strong>: Rhydon and Regirock resist Fire Blast and can take a Focus Blast. They can't switch in safely every time, but they are able to switch into three out of four of Magmortar's common coverage moves. Regirock also has an easier time against Hidden Power Grass variants and has the bonus of Leftovers recovery over Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Lanturn</strong>: Lanturn is different from other bulky Water-types because of its immunity to Thunderbolt. Lanturn's special bulk also lets it weather Magmortar's onslaught of coverage moves, with the exception of Earthquake, and retaliate with Scald, Thunder Wave, or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Magmortar is grounded and sports an unhealthy Rock-type weakness, leaving it vulnerable to every entry hazard upon switching in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Assault Vest Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is Magmortar's preferred STAB move because of its high power with minimal drawbacks. Thunderbolt targets most Water-type Pokemon that resist Fire Blast, such as Prinplup, Mantine, and Pelipper. Hidden Power Grass is a safer alternative to Focus Blast because, while Magmortar loses stronger coverage for Regirock, it is a perfectly accurate option for Rhydon and Quagsire. Focus Blast nails bulky Rock-types, such as Rhydon and Regirock, which can take the onslaught of Magmortar's coverage and STAB moves. Flame Charge is very useful against weaker targets that can't deal much damage to Magmortar, such as Mismagius and Lilligant, or on the switches that Magmortar forces because it boosts Magmortar's Speed, making it much harder to revenge kill. Earthquake is the strongest move Magmortar has to hit Lanturn and Pokemon with Flash Fire, such as Flareon and Ninetales.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Running 192 Speed EVs gives Magmortar enough Speed to outspeed neutral-natured base 75 Speed Pokemon, such as Claydol and Garbodor, as well as neutral natured base 70 Speed Pokemon, such as Samurott and Ludicolo. Maximum Special Attack is preferred because you want Magmortar to hit as hard as possible. The rest of the EVs are put into HP to help increase Magmortar's bulk in tandem with its Assault Vest. Vital Spirit gives Magmortar an immunity to sleep-inducing moves. A Modest nature should be used if not using Earthquake because Flame Charge's damage output is irrelevant. However, if running Earthquake, you can use a Mild nature in order to make it a bit more powerful at the cost of Magmortar's Defense. However, Earthquake with a Modest nature still manages to 3HKO Lanturn after Stealth Rock damage, so the extra boost is all about preference. 248 HP EVs can be used for significantly higher bulk and as such a more reliable check to some Fire-types; however, you should be prepared for Ludicolo and Samurott because they will threaten Magmortar out if they are allowed to switch in. Maximum Speed can allow Magmortar to outpace base 80 Speed Pokemon, such as Mesprit and Shiftry.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Assault Vest Magmortar is one of the safest offensive answers to Lilligant and defensive Grass-types, such as Vileplume, Ferroseed, Gourgeist-S, and Gourgeist-XL in the tier, fearing, at worst, Leech Seed or getting poisoned from Sludge Bomb. Magmortar has the ability to check special Fire- and Ice-types, such as Pyroar, Aurorus, and Jynx, as well but should be wary of coverage moves, such as Hyper Voice, Earth Power, and Psyshock, respectively. Assault Vest gives Magmortar just enough bulk to take one neutral or resisted hit, such as Rotom's Shadow Ball or Swellow's Boomburst, and retaliate with its impressive coverage. Magmortar struggles to take these hits if it switches into entry hazards, so be conservative with your switches or make sure the field is cleared.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defog and Rapid Spin support from the likes of Prinplup and Claydol keeps Stealth Rock and Spikes off the field for Magmortar. Swords Dance Samurott is a great offensive partner for Magmortar because it struggles against the bulky Grass-types that Magmortar easily handles. Bulky Grass-types, such as Gourgeist-XL, Torterra, and Tangela, also pair well with Magmortar because of its ability to handle opposing Fire- and Ice-type Pokemon. These Grass-types can also switch in safely against the Ground- and Rock-types that can revenge kill Magmortar.</p>"

Focus Blast nails bulky Rock-types, such as Rhydon and Regirock, which can take the onslaught of Magmortar's coverage and STAB moves. Earthquake is the strongest move Magmortar has to hit Lanturn and Pokemon with Flash Fire, such as Flareon and Ninetales. Flamethrower is a safe alternative to Fire Blast, trading the extra power away for the inability to miss.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Magmortar to hit hard and with as little opposition as possible. Having as few Pokemon that outspeed Magmortar as possible will preserve as much of its HP as possible for more attacks with Life Orb. Vital Spirit gives Magmortar an immunity to sleep-inducing moves such as Sleep Powder and Lovely Kiss from the likes of Lilligant and Jynx. Life Orb is preferred to ensure Magmortar hits as hard as possible while still retaining the ability to switch moves. However, if you would like an alternative with no recoil damage, Magmortar sports enough raw power to use an Expert Belt, still boosting its relevant super effective coverage moves without inflicting recoil. A Rash nature preserves Magmortar's Defense so that it takes less damage from physical priority attacks, such as Fake Out and Sucker Punch. Mild preserves Magmortar's Special Defense in case you want Magmortar to take powerful special attacks better. A Hasty nature sacrifices some power for the ability to outspeed base 80 Speed Pokemon, such as Mesprit and Shiftry, along with Adamant Pinsir.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Magmortar has little to no safe switch-ins in the tier, so its main job is to break down defensive cores. If Magmortar is in against a foe that it can KO, don't be afraid to just click Fire Blast. Most Pokemon that resist fire don't appreciate taking a Fire Blast and one of Magmortar's coverage moves as a follow up. Magmortar is very susceptible to residual damage between Life Orb recoil, entry hazard damage, and tanking potential resisted hits, so try to bring it in safely with double switches, on a predicted sleep-inducing move, or with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. However, if you are switching into a sleep-inducing move, you should be cautious about letting Magmortar take a Sludge Bomb or Psyshock from Vileplume and Jynx, respectively. You can afford to be aggressive against switch-ins that can tank a Fire Blast and a follow-up coverage move, as sometimes your opponent is just forced to switch in their Regirock, Lanturn, or Rhydon, hoping that Magmortar didn't use the correct coverage move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defog or Rapid Spin support from the likes of Prinplup and Claydol keeps Stealth Rock and Spikes off the field for Magmortar. Slow U-turn or Volt Switch users, such as bulky Mesprit, Lanturn, and Xatu, can grab momentum for Magmortar and bring it in safely. Rock-, Ground-, and Water-types appreciate Magmortar's ability to check Grass-types and absorb Sleep Powder. Setup sweepers and cleaners, such as Lilligant, Floatzel, and Swellow, appreciate Magmortar's ability to wallbreak for a late-game sweep. Sticky Web support slows down offensive threats, such as Tauros, Zangoose, and Electivire, for Magmortar. Similarly, Stealth Rock and Spikes support make switching into Magmortar even more difficult, guaranteeing a 2HKO on specially defensive Mega Audino and punishing the likes of Hariyama and Grumpig, which have no reliable recovery.</p>"

  "Probopass": {
    "overview": "<p>Probopass has a unique niche as the only viable Pokemon with access to Magnet Pull in the NU metagame. Rock / Steel typing and impressive defenses allow Probopass to check a myriad of relevant threats such as Vivillon, Swellow, Mega Audino, and Mesprit, but its typing also leaves Probopass weak to common attacking types such as Fighting, Water, and Ground and gives it heavy competition from Rhydon, Regirock, and Steelix as a Stealth Rock setter and Normal- and Flying-type check. Being weak to such common attacking types means that despite Probopass's impressive defenses, any kind of defensive set is outclassed, and Probopass should only be running an offensive Steel-type trapping set. Also, a lack of recovery makes Probopass very easy to wear down throughout a battle. Due to its lackluster offensive stats and movepool, Probopass is often very passive and easy to take advantage of when not trapping Steel-types. Unless a team has a sweeper such as Linoone that absolutely requires the removal of Steel-types, it is not strictly necessary to use Probopass to trap them. Oftentimes running a lure set such as Hidden Power Fire Mesprit is better. Lastly, due to a lack of solid Dragon- and Fairy-type Pokemon, Steel-types have a less prominent role in the NU metagame than in most other tiers. This diminished role lessens Probopass's niche as a Steel-type trapper and often makes it dead weight against teams without a Steel-type.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An all-out attacking set consisting of Flash Cannon / Volt Switch / Earth Power and Stealth Rock might seem plausible due to Probopass's decent coverage, but it is outclassed by other stronger and faster special attackers such as Samurott, Magmortar, and Aurorus. In theory, a defensive or specially defensive set would work well due to Probopass's immense defenses and useful set of resistances, but in practice this is not the case. Probopass's typing does not allow it to properly check Normal-types such as Kangaskhan and Tauros due to their access to Earthquake. Similarly, Probopass is too passive to actually stop special attacking Normal- and Flying-types such as Vivillon and Mega Audino, as they can usually set up on Probopass and power right through it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Hariyama, Primeape, and Hitmonchan have 4x super effective STAB moves to use against Probopass, and they can switch in almost for free, only fearing the potential status condition.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Rhydon, Golurk, and Torterra are all examples of Ground-types that immensely threaten Probopass due to their 4x super effective STAB moves, and they are able to set up Rock Polishes or Stealth Rock without fear after switching in.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Lanturn, Gastrodon, and Quagsire can all easily switch in on Probopass, only fearing Toxic. These Water-types threaten Probopass with super effective STAB moves and put the Probopass user in a difficult situation, likely having to risk a Scald burn on a Pokemon that resists Water-type attacks or losing momentum on a double switch.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Teams lacking a Steel-type</strong>: A lack of a Steel-type for Probopass to trap essentially means Probopass has very little purpose during the battle outside of setting up Stealth Rock and checking Normal- and Flying-types in a pinch. Even with these decent niches, Probopass is severely outclassed in these roles by other Pokemon in the metagame such as Rhydon, Regirock, and Steelix.</p>",

      "Steel Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock chips away at the foe's HP every time they switch in and provides fantastic support for teammates. Probopass is a decent user of the move, as it can set it up with ease on almost any trapped Steel-type without worry of the opponent switching to Xatu or a Rapid Spin user or Defogger, but it will struggle in other circumstances due to its passivity. If the team already has a Stealth Rock user, another coverage move can utilized such as Flash Cannon to provide better neutral coverage and hit Fairy-types such as Mega Audino and Clefairy for super effective damage. Volt Switch is another coverage option if the team already has a Stealth Rock user, providing offensive momentum for teammates and hitting Defog users such as Mantine and Pelipper for 4x super effective damage. Toxic can also be used here to cripple Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Claydol, and Hariyama that would otherwise have no problems switching into Probopass. Earth Power hits Pokemon Probopass likes to trap such as Steelix and Aggron for maximum damage while also having the added benefit of hitting Fire-types such as Pyroar and Magmortar and Rock-types like Rhydon, Regirock, and Aurorus. Hidden Power Fire is also a viable coverage move for Probopass, hitting Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Vivillon, and Scyther harder than Earth Power without anything being immune to it. Although this might seem appealing, Hidden Power Fire is usually inferior to Earth Power, as it is far weaker, and Probopass can Taunt Steel-types such as Ferroseed and chip them with Earth Power regardless. Magnet Rise is crucial, as it allows Probopass to effectively trap Steel-types without having to fear 4x super effective Earthquakes. It is also useful for making Probopass harder to revenge kill for the likes of Archeops, Tauros, and Kangaskhan after it has trapped a foe. Similarly, Taunt is valuable because it prevents trapped Steel-types from setting up entry hazards before they faint and can prevent a setup sweeper from boosting any further in a pinch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment with a Modest nature allows Probopass to hit as hard as possible, while 84 Speed EVs allow Probopass to outpace uninvested base 50 speed Pokemon and below, such as Regirock and tank Rhydon. The rest of the EVs are poured into Probopass's HP stat to allow it to be as bulky as possible. If your team is particularly weak to Piloswine, an alternate EV spread of 252 SpA / 120 Spe / 136 HP can be used to outspeed it and easily win the matchup with Flash Cannon. Magnet Pull is the entire reason one uses Probopass and allows it to fulfill its job of trapping Steel-types. Air Balloon is the item of choice, as it prevents Steel-types such as Steelix from simply using Earthquake against Probopass as it switches in to trap them.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aside from Steelix, beware of switching Probopass directly into Steel-types such as Aggron and Ferroseed, as Probopass is KOed by Aggron's Superpower and cannot beat Ferroseed if it is affected by Leech Seed and lacks Hidden Power Fire. Since Probopass is also very one-dimensional, your opponent will often predict you to switch in Probopass on their Steel-type and switch out first, so finding opportune times to trap said Steel-types is essential. In order to trap a Steel-type, it is often useful to sack another Pokemon on your team to said Steel-type and then trap it as the opponent does not have a chance to switch out predicting Probopass to come in. Once Probopass has trapped the opposing Steel-type and set up Stealth Rock, it is often dead weight and potential setup fodder, so beware of just throwing it out recklessly in the midst of battle, as it is very easy to take advantage of.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that struggle to break through Steel-types such as Scyther, Kangaskhan, and Swellow make for excellent teammates. Other Pokemon such as Archeops, Tauros, and Jynx that appreciate Stealth Rock also work well with Probopass. Furthermore, Pokemon that resist Fighting, Ground, and Water such as Garbodor, Torterra, and Mesprit respectively make for good partners with Probopass, as they have good defensive synergy. Mesprit, in particular, works well with Probopass, as not only do they have fantastic offensive and defensive synergy, but Mesprit can also provide Stealth Rock, freeing up a slot for Flash Cannon on Probopass. Versus teams without a Steel-type, Probopass often finds it difficult to set up Stealth Rock due to its low Speed and multitude of weaknesses, so Mesprit can fulfill that role. Pokemon that make excellent use of U-turn and Volt Switch such as Scyther and Rotom are solid partners for Probopass, as they provide free switches into Steel-types Probopass yearns to trap.</p>"

  "Dusknoir": {
    "overview": "<p>Dusknoir carves its niche in NU as a bulky spinblocker that distinguishes itself from other Ghost-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Golurk by virtue of its higher Special Defense and lack of secondary typing. This in turn rids it of exploitable weaknesses to common attacking types, Ice in particular, making it capable of taking on the likes of Hitmonchan with few problems. Dusknoir also possesses priority in Shadow Sneak, which allows it to take out targets like Mismagius and Rotom with very little prior damage. Despite its average Attack stat,  Dusknoir is able to soften up more defensively oriented Pokemon such as Steelix and Rhydon with Earthquake when running its Choice Band set. However, lack of a strong STAB attack means that it struggles to break defensive threats, especially Normal-types such as Miltank and Mega Audino, which are immune to Shadow Sneak and not weak to Dusknoir's coverage. Despite boasting acceptable physical and special bulk, Dusknoir is unable to use either stat fully as a result of its poor HP. Low Speed causes it to rely on Shadow Sneak in order to deal with faster Pokemon like Archeops and Jynx, which is problematic due to the move's low power, and means it's outpaced by some defensive Pokemon such as Lanturn and Weezing. Additionally, Shadow Sneak's inability to hit fast Normal-types such as Tauros, Kangaskhan, and Swellow prevents Dusknoir from taking on said Pokemon effectively. Furthermore, its low Base Power prevents Dusknoir from KOing certain offensive Pokemon such as Lilligant and Floatzel from full HP. Lastly, since Dusknoir has to wield a Choice Band in order to have decent damage output, one must predict constantly. A single misplay can be incredibly costly and end up losing a lot of momentum.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sucker Punch can be used in order to hit Normal-types such as Tauros and Pyroar, which are immune to Shadow Sneak. If using Sucker Punch, Dusknoir is required to choose Pressure as its ability, as the combination of Sucker Punch and Frisk is illegal. Be wary when using Sucker Punch, however, since Pokemon that opt out of using an attacking move can completely rob Dusknoir of any momentum. Pressure also presents some use in draining certain low-PP moves such as Primeape and Hariyama's Close Combat. Other elemental punches also warrant some consideration, as Fire Punch quickly disposes of Ferroseed, and Thunder Punch is able to nail both Mantine and Pelipper. Additionally, Memento over Trick in the last slot enables Dusknoir to cripple otherwise strong attackers and provide a teammate with a setup opportunity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon boasting high physical bulk such as Mega Audino, Gastrodon, Miltank, Quagsire, and Weezing are relatively unbothered by Dusknoir's attacks, although the latter is crippled by a well-timed Trick. It's also worth noting that even moderately physically bulky Pokemon such as Pelipper and Swords Dance Charizard are usually able to switch into Dusknoir's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types like Shiftry and Liepard threaten Dusknoir with a STAB Knock Off but are unable to switch in due to their middling bulk. Skuntank, in particular, can switch in on both Shadow Sneak and Ice Punch and Pursuit trap Dusknoir.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Because of Dusknoir's lackluster HP, it gets worn down easily by powerful attackers such as Mesprit and Magmortar, which force it to either take heavy damage or pivot out into one of its teammates. It's strongly advised that you keep Dusknoir away from Pokemon like these lest it have what little HP it does possess depleted and end up death fodder.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Sneak is Dusknoir's main STAB attack, dealing relatively decent damage while allowing it to attack faster Pokemon such as Mesprit, Jynx, and Rotom before they can move. Shadow Sneak is also an excellent option for targeting frail offensive Pokemon such as Floatzel and Archeops and is capable of knocking the latter into Defeatist range. Earthquake is Dusknoir's highest-Base Power move and can be used to take care of the likes of Steelix, Garbodor, Rhydon, and Skuntank, which would otherwise trouble Dusknoir. Ice Punch allows Dusknoir to hit Flying- and Grass-types like Scyther and Vileplume super effectively and prevents it from being walled by Swellow and Shiftry. Trick is used to cripple defensive Pokemon that rely on their items, namely Eviolite users such as Ferroseed, Clefairy, and Gurdurr, which can give Dusknoir trouble, as well as Pokemon that rely on their non-damaging moves to stay afloat such as Gastrodon and Vileplume.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Attack and an Adamant nature maximize Dusknoir's damage dealing capabilities and allow it to threaten as much as possible, most notably netting the 2HKO on Steelix with Earthquake, and 212 HP EVs grant it substantial bulk, enabling it to pivot into weaker attacks such as Hitmonchan's Ice Punch. Lastly, 44 EVs in Speed allow Dusknoir to outpace and 2HKO Vileplume, Regirock, and uninvested Hariyama before they can get a hit off. Choice Band helps to make up for Shadow Sneak's somewhat underwhelming Base Power, and Frisk allows Dusknoir to scout for common Choice item users, particularly Choice Scarf users such as Scyther and Primeape.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dusknoir's Ghost typing and lack of weakness to Ice-type moves allow it to spinblock against common Rapid Spin users such as Hitmonchan to keep hazards on the field without fear of an Ice Punch. Dusknoir's favorable bulk enables it to pivot into weaker attacks such as Xatu's Psychic and Garbodor's Gunk Shot; use this to your advantage by switching in and threatening to KO back with one of Dusknoir's coverage moves. Shadow Sneak can also be used as a safety blanket to fall back on whenever a fast threat like Jynx or Vivillon gets out of control. Most notably, Shadow Sneak is able to KO Jynx after its Focus Sash is broken, and uninvested Rotom has a chance to be OHKOed. Use Trick to cripple Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Clefairy, which would otherwise wall Dusknoir. Before using Trick, observe your opponent's behavior and take note of how they react to Dusknoir. Make sure Dusknoir will be able to Trick its intended target lest it lose its Choice Band unnecessarily and be robbed of its ability to break bulkier archetypes. It's often beneficial to play Dusknoir aggressively, especially if your opponent has healthy defensive threats such as Steelix and Rhydon waiting in the wings.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dusknoir's spinblocking capabilities give it favorable synergy on offense teams that enjoy its ability to keep entry hazards on the field. Stealth Rock users such as Steelix and Rhydon, in particular, are very appreciative of Dusknoir's ability to spinblock, and users of Spikes and Toxic Spikes such as Weezing, Garbodor, and Ferroseed benefit for similar reasons. Psychic-types such as Jynx and Mesprit threaten many of Dusknoir's checks such as Weezing and Gurdurr with their strong STAB moves, but Xatu deserves a special mention; although it isn't nearly as powerful as Jynx or Mesprit, it can bounce away status moves that may harm Dusknoir. However, despite their excellent offensive synergy with Dusknoir, Psychic-types are just as susceptible to Ghost- and Dark-type moves, meaning you'll have to stack weaknesses if you wish to use them. Gurdurr makes an excellent status absorber and is able to threaten Dark-types such as Shiftry that trouble Dusknoir, whereas strong wallbreakers like Tauros, Samurott, and Magmortar can help soften up opposing Pokemon that Dusknoir may have trouble breaking such as Mega Audino and Weezing.</p>"

  "Rotom": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom's fantastic typing and Levitate give it resistances to Flying, Steel, Bug, and Electric and immunities to Normal, Fighting, and Ground, letting Rotom check dangerous threats such as Archeops, Scyther, Vivillon, Tauros, and others. A Ghost typing allows Rotom to spinblock and hit the common Psychic-types super effectively with STAB Shadow Ball. Access to Volt Switch makes Rotom an excellent pivot for many different teams, and moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Trick give it the ability to cripple switch-ins, especially bulky Pokemon immune to Electric. Unfortunately, the low Base Power of most of its moves means that Rotom's power is often rather lackluster. Because of this, most Pokemon immune to Electric have little problem blocking Rotom's Volt Switch, as they can generally stomach several Shadow Balls. Rotom's susceptibility to the common Dark-types doesn't help, either. In addition, even though it sports many great resistances and immunities, Rotom simply doesn't have the bulk to make the best use of them. However, in spite of its flaws, Rotom's qualities make it one of the easiest Pokemon in the metagame to fit onto various different teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Expert Belt with Hidden Power Grass allows Rotom to bluff a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs set and lure Gastrodon and Rhydon, however the combination of Will-O-Wisp and a Spell Tag boosted Hex deals heavy damage to these Pokemon. Substitute + Pain Split with a Life Orb hits fairly hard, avoids Sucker Punches, and wears down counters with high HP stats such as Lanturn and Hariyama.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Electric</strong>: Pokemon immune to Electric such as Lanturn and Gastrodon block Rotom's Volt Switch and generally have the bulk and typing to take Shadow Balls. Many Pokemon immune to Electric fear Will-O-Wisp, Trick, or a full-powered Hex with the sole exception being Camerupt.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Vileplume and Lilligant take little from Rotom's Electric STAB moves, and many are bulky enough to stomach Shadow Balls. Lilligant in particular can easily use Rotom as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Because Rotom is generally weak without a boosting item, most bulky Pokemon such as Hariyama and Magmortar can stomach Rotom's attacks with relative ease. However, Rotom can simply Volt Switch out as they come in, and Choice Specs-boosted moves and full-powered Hex can hurt for the former.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types resist Shadow Ball or have more than enough bulk to take one in Malamar's case, and they threaten Rotom with their STAB moves. Shiftry also resists Electric-type moves, and Skuntank can Pursuit trap Rotom, though it must watch out for Choice Specs-boosted Thunder.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Though Rotom is generally a solid Normal-type check, Normal-types can come in for free on Choice sets when Rotom is forced to use Shadow Ball. Kangaskhan and Kecleon are especially threatening to Rotom, the former because of Scrappy and the latter because of its access to Protean Knock Off, Sucker Punch, and Shadow Sneak. Mega Audino can be troublesome, as it's immune to Shadow Ball, is able to cure burns with Heal Bell, and is immune to Trick.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks</strong>: Priority moves such as Aqua Jet, Ice Shard, and Sucker Punch can bypass Rotom's high Speed and Choice Scarf and KO it if they're boosted or if Rotom is weakened; Sucker Punch even outright OHKOes Rotom. Sucker Punch users have to be wary of Will-O-Wisp, however.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch works well with Rotom's ability to force switches, letting it gain momentum while doing solid damage. Thunderbolt is a more powerful Electric-type STAB move that doesn't force Rotom to switch out, being particularly useful when cleaning weakened teams. Shadow Ball provides great coverage, hitting Psychic-types and Pokemon immune to Electric. Trick cripples defensive switch-ins and makes them useless for the rest of the match while also giving Rotom a better matchup against slower, bulkier teams after it Tricks away its Choice Scarf. Will-O-Wisp can be used over Thunderbolt to enable Rotom to cripple switch-ins such as Rhydon, Lanturn, and Kangaskhan and allows it to avoid Shiftry's, Cacturne's, and Mawile's Sucker Punch and burn them, but this causes Rotom to be less reliable in late-game scenarios.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment maximizes Rotom's damage output, and maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature let Rotom outspeed the likes of +1 Vivillon, +1 Lilligant, +2 Gorebyss, and Choice Scarf Mesprit. Choice Scarf makes Rotom a very fast and reliable revenge killer. Maximum HP can be run over Special Attack to make Rotom significantly bulkier and check the likes of Archeops and Swellow better at the expense of a lot of power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pivot into moves that Rotom resists or is immune to, such as Archeops's Acrobatics or Earthquake, Scyther's Aerial Ace, Swellow's Facade or Brave Bird, and Tauros's Rock Climb, but be wary of coverage moves such as Archeops's Stone Edge and Swellow's Boomburst, as they can OHKO Rotom. Spam Volt Switch throughout most of the game unless there's a Pokemon immune to Electric, such as Stunfisk, Rhydon, or Lanturn, on the opposing team, in which case it's best to use Shadow Ball, use Will-O-Wisp, or simply hard switch to a teammate. This situation gets even trickier if there's a Normal- or Dark-type on the opposing team, where the best solution is to go out to a teammate or burn them as they switch in. Unless the foe has Mega Audino, Trick away Rotom's Choice Scarf early-game against bulky, slow teams, against which it doesn't need the Speed Choice Scarf provides. Similarly, Rotom can Trick away its Choice Scarf to cripple Pokemon such as Stunfisk and Lanturn to make it easier for a teammate such as Klinklang to sweep late-game. Use Will-O-Wisp against Sucker Punch users such as Cacturne, Mawile, and Kangaskhan to avoid their priority move and severely cripple them. Sacrificing Rotom to burn Pokemon such as Kangaskhan or Liepard is an option when you don't need Rotom anymore in order to give teammates such as Swords Dance Mawile, Lilligant, and Klinklang the opportunity to set up and sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom doesn't need a lot of support thanks to its ability to be easily slapped onto many teams. A switch-in to Pokemon immune to Electric is a necessary partner for Rotom; Water- and Grass-types both work well. Checks to the Dark-types that take advantage of Rotom, such as Pawniard, Cacturne, and Liepard, are also important due to their popularity and how threatening they are, with Mawile, Mega Audino, Hariyama, and Scyther pairing with Rotom nicely. Wallbreakers such as Aurorus, Magmortar, and Exeggutor appreciate Rotom's ability to bring them in with Volt Switch, and they also take advantage of Rotom's Ground and Grass switch-ins. U-turn and Volt Switch users, such as Mesprit, Liepard, Lanturn, Scyther, and Xatu, form a good VoltTurn core with Rotom that gradually wears down the opposing team. Entry hazard-stacking teams love Rotom's ability to spinblock; Garbodor, Crustle, Cacturne, and Kricketune are good examples of effective entry hazard setters that each work in very different team archetypes. Sweepers such as Klinklang, Scyther, and Samurott love Rotom's ability to take on Water-types while weakening or crippling Grass- and Ground-types and Lanturn with Shadow Ball, Will-O-Wisp, and Trick.</p>"

      "Spell Tag Hex": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hex packs a powerful punch when the foe has a status ailment, and it allows Rotom to lure and beat Pokemon immune to Electric such as Lanturn, Steelix, Piloswine, and Rhydon. Will-O-Wisp lets Rotom spread status to power up Hex and is generally useful to cripple physical attackers and defensive Pokemon. Volt Switch hits decently hard and lets Rotom pivot out into a teammate. Discharge is a slightly more powerful Electric-type STAB that has good chance to paralyze the foe and does not force Rotom to switch. Shadow Ball is a more reliable Ghost-type STAB move and does solid damage thanks to the Spell Tag boost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment lets Rotom hit as hard as possible, and maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Rotom outspeed Lilligant, Vivillon, Jolly Pinsir, Timid Mesprit, and others. Spell Tag boosts the power of Rotom's Ghost-type moves, allows it to switch between moves, and lets it bluff a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs set due to the lack of Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Take advantage of Rotom's great resistances and immunities to switch into the likes of Archeops, Swellow, Tauros, and Zangoose, among others; however, the former two can 2HKO Rotom even with their Flying STAB moves, so it should bluff Choice Scarf to force them out. Bluffing Choice Scarf in general lets Rotom force faster Pokemon out and lure in Pokemon immune to Electric. Rotom's primary role is to lure its usual switch-ins, such as Stunfisk, Rhydon, and Lanturn, burn them as they come in, and smack them with a full-powered Hex, weakening them for a teammate and allowing Rotom to freely spam Volt Switch once they are gone. If there are Toxic Spikes on the foe's side of the field, however, feel free to spam Rotom's powerful Hex. Spam Volt Switch to chip away at the opposing team if there's no Pokemon Rotom needs to weaken or, better yet, if it has already done so. Be careful around Lanturn, however, as Volt Absorb can let it recover the HP that Rotom took away.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can sweep once Rotom has lured and weakened the Pokemon that'd typically wall it are ideal partners for Rotom. Klinklang is arguably Rotom's best partner, as most stops to its sweep are lured and beaten by it. Pokemon such as Scyther also pair decently. Toxic Spikes support is very helpful, as it allows Rotom to spam Hex without having to burn the opposing Pokemon first. In exchange, Rotom can spinblock foes that try to remove those Toxic Spikes. Other forms of entry hazard stacking also work nicely with Rotom. A switch-in to Pokemon immune to Electric is appreciated in the cases where Rotom is needed for another threat, as Rotom generally cannot 2HKO them as they come without burning them first. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Scyther, Mesprit, Liepard, Lanturn, and Zebstrika form a solid VoltTurn core that constantly chips away at the opposing team.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is a decently powerful STAB move that provides momentum for Rotom's team with opportunities to switch in freely for heavy-hitting teammates such as Tauros and Scyther. Shadow Ball has solid neutral coverage alongside Volt Switch and Thunderbolt, hitting common Grass, Electric-, and Ground-types such as Vileplume, Lanturn, and Steelix for respectable damage. Thunderbolt is Rotom's strongest, most reliable STAB option and provides it with an Electric-type STAB move that doesn't force it to switch out. Alternatively, Thunder allows Rotom to break through traditional checks such as Skuntank and non-specially defensive Mega Audino, having a chance to OHKO the former and 2HKO the latter after Stealth Rock damage. Finally, Trick cripples defensive Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Gastrodon, and Clefairy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Rotom to hit as hard and fast as possible. Levitate provides Rotom with an extra immunity to Ground and allows it to easily check threats such as Archeops and Tauros, which cannot hit it super effectively with Earthquake. Choice Specs differentiates this set from the others, as it plays the role of a wallbreaker, unlike the Choice Scarf set, which cleans, or the Hex set, which is more of a disrupter.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Look to make use of Volt Switch as much as possible early- or mid-game to generate momentum for teammates and weaken checks to Rotom such as Mega Audino, Hariyama, and Skuntank. However, beware of using Volt Switch or any Electric-type STAB move when the opponent has an Electric immunity such as Volt Absorb Lanturn, or more commonly, a Ground-type such as Rhydon or Steelix still on their team. In these situations, it is often beneficial to use Shadow Ball to weaken these checks or double switch into a Pokemon better equipped to handle them in order to not lose momentum. Pursuit trappers such as Liepard and Skuntank are very threatening to Rotom and can switch into Choice Specs Rotom's Shadow Ball with impunity. To avoid easily getting trapped by these Pokemon, do not mindlessly use Shadow Ball throughout the game, and be careful of knocking Pokemon out with Thunderbolt, as it provides a Pursuit trapper with a free chance to switch in. Thunder can be utilized early-game to lure in and heavily damage Skuntank and Mega Audino.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom greatly appreciates Stealth Rock from the likes of Rhydon and Steelix and Spikes from Pokemon such as Garbodor and Ferroseed, as they chip away at typical counters to Rotom such as Mega Audino and Lanturn. In particular, Pokemon with access to Toxic Spikes such as Weezing and Garbodor make for excellent partners, as Toxic Spikes quickly wears down bulky Ground-types like Rhydon, Piloswine, and Gastrodon, which prevent Rotom from spamming its Electric-type STAB moves. In return, Rotom can block Rapid Spin with its Ghost typing to keep said entry hazards up. Other Pokemon with access to U-turn and Volt Switch such as Scyther, Mesprit, and Lanturn are solid choices alongside Rotom, as they can also generate momentum for teammates and wear each other's checks and counters down. Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan, Gurdurr, and Hariyama work well with Rotom, as they don't mind switching into Dark-types such as Liepard and Skuntank, and they can also break down Ground-, Rock-, and Steel-types. Conversely, Rotom can check the Flying-types that give these Pokemon trouble such as Mantine, Scyther, and Vivillon. Late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Jynx, Swellow, and Floatzel also appreciate Rotom's ability to break down bulky Pokemon such as Mega Audino, Lanturn, and Clefairy so they can run through a team late-game with their power and Speed. Lastly, Shiftry, Mesprit, and Musharna are solid partners for Rotom, as they all appreciate Skuntank being lured in and heavily weakened by Thunder.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Hex": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute is used to stall out the foe so they take more burn damage, allowing Rotom to pick them off with Hex. It also allows Rotom to dodge status moves from Pokemon like Steelix and Mantine. Will-O-Wisp is Rotom's main way of statusing the foe, in order to wear them down as well as boost Hex's power; it also halves the Attack stat of opposing Pokemon, which lets Rotom set up Substitutes on common physical attackers like Steelix. Hex becomes a 130-Base Power move once the foe has been statused that puts huge dents in most non-Normal-, Dark-, or Ghost-types. Discharge is an alternative way for Rotom to spread status in order to power up Hex that is also able to target common Defoggers like Mantine and Pelipper. Discharge's high paralysis rate also makes it a good way to status Magmortar, which is why it is the Electric STAB move of choice on this set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP is used in order to tank as many hits as possible and create Substitutes with the most HP, which is required in order to keep them up against walls such as Weezing and Steelix. Maximum Speed with a Timid nature is used in order to hit the best possible Speed tier, outspeeding threats such as Kangaskhan and Lilligant. An alternative is to use 104 Special Attack EVs to get the guaranteed KO on Mantine after it has taken Stealth Rock damage, but Rotom generally prefers the ability to take more hits, and wearing down common walls like Mantine usually is not a problem for Rotom and its teammates. Leftovers is used to gain back HP slowly after creating Substitutes, allowing Rotom to create additional Substitutes throughout the match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Rotom's great typing, it can switch in on a plethora of threats and proceed to set up Substitutes or start statusing the opposing team in order to wear it down; good examples include common Pokemon such as Archeops, Scyther, Steelix, and Garbodor. Even if there is the possibility Rotom will faint to a Rapid Spin user like Hitmonchan going for an alternative move, it is generally safe to switch in just to prevent the opponent from removing the entry hazards from their side of the field. Early-game, Rotom should be more focused on trying to status the opposing team than on attacking with Hex, as it becomes much easier to spam late-game once most of the opposing team has been statused. Rotom should also be cautious of switching into Mantine and Steelix, as while it does beat them, it does not like being hit by Toxic and crippled for the rest of the match. Rotom should also be cautious with inflicting the wrong status on certain Pokemon; for example, it does not want to paralyze certain Pokemon such as Musharna, as paralysis prevents it from being worn down by other status ailments such as burn and poison.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes support is very beneficial for Rotom, as it helps Rotom spam Hex earlier in the match without having to worry about statusing the other team with Will-O-Wisp or Discharge first; good options for Toxic Spikes support include common hazard setters Weezing, Garbodor, and Roselia, as they can get up multiple layers of Toxic Spikes for Rotom. Rotom can also spinblock to prevent entry hazard removers like Hitmonchan and Claydol from spinning away the Toxic Spikes and has Discharge to scare away the common Defoggers Mantine and Pelipper. Due to this Rotom set's lack of Special Attack investment, additional hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock or Spikes is beneficial; for example, with Stealth Rock up Discharge becomes a KO on Mantine. Good partners would include common Stealth Rock setters such as Steelix and Rhydon, which can reliably get up the hazard for Rotom to get the knockouts it needs to. Pokemon that appreciate bulky Steel-types removed, such as Klinklang and Scyther, make good partners; Klinklang also appreciates Rotom's ability to knock out bulky Water-types like Pelipper for it. Due to Rotom's tendency to switch in on Pokemon that are able to status it, Heal Bell support from Pokemon like Audino and Musharna is appreciated.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>STAB Volt Switch lets Rotom act as a bulky pivot for more balanced or defensive teams. Thunderbolt can be used for a more powerful Electric STAB move that doesn't force Rotom to switch out. Hex deals significantly more damage to statused foes, and the low base power unboosted isn't as important on a defensive set. Shadow Ball can be used as a reliable Ghost STAB move that hits Pokemon immune to Electric. Will-O-Wisp cripples the physical attackers Rotom checks, in addition to many of its switch-ins, and in general greatly enhances Rotom's physical bulk. Pain Split gives Rotom a somewhat unreliable form of recovery that takes advantage of its low HP stat and the high HP of the walls that check Rotom, such as Audino, Lanturn, and Hariyama.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature allows Rotom to be as fast as possible, outspeeding key threats such as positive natured Kangaskhan and Lilligant. Maximum HP investment enhances Rotom's bulk to respectable levels. Sitrus Berry gives Rotom immediate recovery when it reaches low HP, giving it more opportunities to pivot into attacks, while Colbur Berry can be used to weaken the damage from a Dark-type Attack. Leftovers is another option to give Rotom passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch into moves Rotom resists or is immune to, or even into weak defensive Pokemon that it can threaten such as Mantine. Use Will-O-Wisp frequently in order to spread burns, as even with investment Rotom is not bulky enough to stomach multiple physical hits and burns are generally useful for wearing down the opposing team. Will-O-Wisp is also useful for crippling the Pokemon immune to Electric that often switch into Rotom. Spam Volt Switch if there's nothing Rotom needs to burn to gain momentum. Shadow Ball should only be used when Rotom is focused on dealing damage or when there's a Pokemon immune to Electric that Rotom needs to get chip damage on. Use Pain Split if Rotom is weakened to regain some health. Pain Split is also Rotom's best option to deal damage against the likes of Hariyama, Lanturn, and Mega Audino, outside of burning them, due to their high HP stat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>U-turn and Volt Switch users form a solid VoltTurn core with Rotom, with Mesprit, Xatu, Lanturn, and Scyther all being solid options. Scyther stands out for its solid bulk with Eviolite and defensive investment in addition to its solid synergy with Rotom, notably checking the Dark-types that give Rotom trouble, especially Malamar, and being a good secondary Pokemon that resists Fighting. Lanturn, meanwhile, provides a Fire check, a necessity in most teams. Pokemon that take advantage of the bulky Pokemon immune to Electric that give Rotom trouble are mandatory partners. Grass- and Water-types are generally good checks to them, and they appreciate Rotom's Flying and Electric resistances, respectively. A teammate that checks Dark-types is an important partner for Rotom, as they otherwise easily take advantage of it; Mega Audino, Mawile, Hariyama, and Garbodor pair nicely. Rotom works well in defensive entry hazard stacking teams that also need a Flying check thanks to its ability to spinblock. Sweepers such as Klinklang and Samurott appreciate Rotom's ability to weaken Ground-types and Lanturn with Will-O-Wisp and Pain Split in order to sweep late-game, and in return they have solid defensive synergy with Rotom.</p>"

  "Rotom-Frost": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-F is the only Pokemon in the game to have STAB on both Ice- and Electric-type attacks. In combination with a decent Speed tier and a respectable Special Attack stat, this makes it an effective offensive threat that can deal good damage to the majority of the tier. With a Choice Scarf, it can outspeed key threats such as Archeops and Swellow and OHKO them with the correct STAB move, while Volt Switch allows it to grab momentum for its teammates when required, and Trick gives it further utility against defensive foes. Meanwhile, a Life Orb set gives Rotom-F considerable power and allows it to use Pain Split to deal with usual checks and counters. However, certain threats such as Lanturn and Piloswine are able to block Rotom-F's STAB combination completely, and given its numerous exploitable weaknesses, its only above-average bulk, and the inaccuracy of Blizzard outside of hail, it requires a lot of support to stand out compared to similar Pokemon such as Rotom and Abomasnow. Rotom-F's unique combination of qualities can make it difficult to deal with once the appropriate support has been provided, but make sure it is the best choice for your team before using it over a more standard threat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set can be used to turn Rotom-F into a powerful wallbreaker, but this prevents it from making the most of its neutral coverage and also makes it easily stopped by faster threats, giving it few opportunities to excel. Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are interesting utility options that can be used to cripple certain responses, particularly on the Life Orb set, but Rotom-F rarely has space in its movesets to accommodate these over more important moves. Discharge can be used to provide paralysis support for Rotom-F's teammates, particularly Choice Specs Aurorus, on either set, but it lacks the power to remove foes as consistently as Thunderbolt. Hidden Power Grass hits Lanturn, Piloswine, Gastrodon, and Rhydon for consistent damage, but also isn't worth a moveslot and doesn't have enough power to be particularly useful. Finally, a ChestoRest strategy gives Rotom-F some one-time recovery and a response to status moves, but Rotom-F's immunity to paralysis and numerous weaknesses, as well as the effectiveness of Pain Split for healing, makes this not worth it most of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Lanturn and Piloswine</strong>: These two Pokemon have the rare quality of resisting both of Rotom-F's STAB attacks while also being immune to Volt Switch. Rotom-F similarly resists its own attacks in a rare mirror match but is usually unable to capitalize on this.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Rotom-F lacks power without a Life Orb and relies on super effective attacks to deal with bulky threats. Assault Vest Hariyama, Calm Mind Musharna, and Mega Audino can switch into it easily and start attacking or setting up. Mega Audino in particular is a threat because it is also immune to Trick.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Hitmonchan's Mach Punch can inflict heavy damage if Rotom-F is not behind a Substitute, while Sucker Punch users such as Shiftry and Skuntank can easily force a switch against the Choice Scarf set.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Without a Choice Scarf, Rotom-F is quickly disposed of by fast attackers such as Tauros and Pyroar after its Substitute is broken.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Electric</strong>: While most Ground-types dislike Blizzard, Pokemon with abilities that give them immunity to Electric-type attacks, such as Motor Drive Electivire and Lightning Rod Raichu, can stop Rotom-F from using Volt Switch and inflict heavy damage with their respective boosts.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch lets Rotom-F grab momentum if the opponent switches out, and it deals enough damage to KO weakened foes. It also breaks Focus Sashes on threats such as Jynx as it switches to a better response. Blizzard has excellent neutral coverage with Rotom-F's Electric-type attacks and provides its main niche as a Choice Scarf user, punishing common responses to Volt Switch such as Rhydon, Claydol, and Vileplume. Thunderbolt provides a perfectly accurate Electric-type attack that lets Rotom-F stay in against the opposing Pokemon and deal damage with certainty, unlike Volt Switch or Blizzard. Trick is a good way to deal with defensive responses such as Piloswine and Ferroseed, which don't enjoy being locked into their attacks. It also allows Rotom-F to switch moves freely after use and lets it capitalize on its excellent type coverage when the extra Speed is no longer required. Hidden Power Ice can be used in the last slot as a reliable Ice-type attack, although it sorely lacks power and fails to OHKO Pokemon such as Lilligant and Rotom-S even after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Using a Choice Scarf with a Timid nature allows Rotom-F to outspeed many Speed-boosting sweepers such as Rock Polish Torterra, Golurk, and Rhydon, as well as all unboosted Pokemon. Even after its Choice Scarf is removed by Trick or Knock Off, it can still outpace threats such as Timid Mesprit and Timid Magmortar and KO them without taking an attack. Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs are required to secure as many revenge killing opportunities as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This is Rotom-F's most consistently effective set and capitalizes on its immunities to paralysis and Ground-type attacks, which provide many opportunities to switch in. Between Blizzard and Thunderbolt, it can hit almost any offensive foe for good neutral damage if it uses the right move. Early in the match, Volt Switch should be used to scout the opponent's responses to your team, unless they have obviously Electric-immune Pokemon such as Lanturn and Piloswine, in which case Rotom-F should be saved until these threats are removed. Rotom-F's mediocre bulk and few resistances mean it should not be switched directly into attackers unless they are obviously walled, such as Articuno, or locked into a resisted move. Against teams that pack multiple bulky threats, Rotom-F should use Trick early on to cripple a defensive Pokemon and give itself the flexibility to alternate its STAB attacks as required.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>While Rotom-F can be run without hail support, doing so gives it significantly more competition from other Ice-type Pokemon with access to Ice Beam. Snow Warning Aurorus provides this hail support and can damage Lanturn with Choice Specs-boosted Freeze Dry or Earth Power, while Rotom-F can switch into Ground-type attacks aimed at Aurorus. They can also wear down each other's checks with repeated Blizzard spam, making them an effective offensive core. Entry hazards can wear down common responses to Rotom-F and make it easier for it to secure KOs. Garbodor and Mesprit are good candidates for hazard setters that can deal with Fighting-types, while Rhydon and Prinplup can deal with Fire- and Rock-types that lack the coverage to beat them. Hazard removal ensures that Rotom-F can switch in and revenge kill effectively throughout the match. Spinners such as Hitmonchan and Claydol, Defog users such as Mantine and Pelipper, and Magic Bounce Xatu have particularly good synergy with Rotom-F. Slow U-turn or Volt Switch users such as Pelipper and Lanturn allow Rotom-F to enter the battle without taking a hit and can be used to form momentum cores that continually keep the opponent on the back foot.</p>"
      },
      "SubSplit": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Rotom-F to scout for the opponent's tactics and to use the correct attacking move the next turn without risking misprediction, making the most of its excellent coverage. It also lets Rotom-F lower its own HP to make Pain Split more effective if required. Pain Split capitalizes on Rotom-F's low base HP stat and vulnerability to residual damage, letting it recover a significant amount of health while still inflicting heavy damage to targets with high base HP, allowing teammates to secure the KO against them more easily later in the match. A notable example of this would be Lanturn, one of the most common answers to Rotom-F. Thunderbolt provides a consistent STAB attack that hits many targets for good damage, while Blizzard provides excellent coverage with Thunderbolt and hits very hard with a Life Orb boost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb maximizes Rotom-F's power and makes it more difficult for checks that lack recovery to deal with it, as they will continually be worn down by powerful attacks. Furthermore, Rotom-F doesn't mind the extra recoil damage, as it lets Rotom-F make better use of Pain Split later in the match and, as it will be behind a Substitute whenever possible, the loss of health doesn't matter as much. A Timid nature is highly recommended in order to let Rotom-F outspeed threats such as Timid Mesprit and to let Rotom-F use Substitute more easily against offensive teams. A Modest nature can also be used for extra power, but this doesn't really help Rotom-F get past its usual counters. Maximum Special Attack EVs are used to maximize its offensive presence, while Rotom-F's lack of bulk is mitigated by Substitute and Pain Split. Never-Melt Ice, Magnet, or Expert Belt can be used with this set to bluff the Choice Scarf more effectively, but the lack of general power and synergy with Pain Split make these niche options.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-F can force a lot of switches thanks to its offensive coverage and power, giving it opportunities to set up a Substitute and hit the opponent's response with the correct attack the next turn. This extra flexibility makes Life Orb Rotom-F more effective against defensive teams that rely on pivoting around threats with Choice items. Substitute should not be used recklessly because if the opponent intends to sacrifice a slower Pokemon that can break the Substitute, this just results in Rotom-F losing HP unnecessarily, making it easier to revenge kill afterwards. Substitute is best used against targets that are forced out by the Choice Scarf set or slower threats that are likely to use status moves. Early in the match, if a defensive threat with high HP like Lanturn or Thick Fat Hariyama switches in, Rotom-F can spam Substitute until at low HP and then use Pain Split to recover almost all of its HP while inflicting around 50% damage to a healthy foe.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Snow Warning Aurorus provides hail support and complements this set well, as it can deal with faster attackers such as Eviolite Scyther that can force Rotom-F out if it lacks a Substitute. Teammates that can deal with faster offensive threats are important, as without a Choice Scarf, Rotom-F is outsped by key threats such as Archeops and Swellow. Musharna and Mesprit are bulky pivots that can either switch into Fighting-types and hit them with Psychic or switch into other attackers and use Thunder Wave so that Rotom-F can deal with them later. Pokemon with priority attacks such as Sucker Punch Shiftry and Skuntank can prevent faster threats from securing a sweep after KOing Rotom-F. Finally, while anti-hazard support is always appreciated, Rotom-F can capitalize on the large amounts of residual damage it takes with Pain Split, so if it runs this move, a spinner or Defog user is not necessarily required as a teammate. Likewise, entry hazards of your own reduce potential healing from Pain Split against bulky targets but can be nice to let Rotom-F secure KOs; Garbodor and Rhydon are good choices in this regard.</p>"

  "Rotom-Fan": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-S's most standout trait is its unique Electric / Flying typing, which gives it important resistances to Fighting-, Ground-, and Flying-type attacks, letting it act as a great check to Pokemon such as Hariyama and Scyther, and in tandem with its access to Volt Switch makes Rotom-S a great offensive pivot. Furthermore, balanced stats all around give it good bulk, decent power, and a crucial Speed tier that lets it outspeed Mesprit, Shiftry, Kabutops, and Pinsir, among others. Like all Pokemon, though, Rotom-S has its fair share of shortcomings, such as being troubled by some common Pokemon in the tier, most notably Lanturn and Rhydon, both of which block Rotom-S's Volt Switch and resist Air Slash; however, Rotom-S has ways to circumvent them. Additionally, low-Base Power moves make its offensive presence underwhelming at times, and thus it struggles breaking through very bulky Pokemon such as Mega Audino and Musharna. A weakness to Stealth Rock is a hindrance as well, especially because Rotom-S tends to switch in and out of the match frequently due to Volt Switch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rotom-S doesn't have too many other options because of its movepool being somewhat barren, but Signal Beam can be used to mainly hit Malamar; however, it has limited use outside of that. A defensive set with Pain Split and Will-O-Wisp has use in acting as a decently reliable check to a wide array of Pokemon such as Scyther, Lilligant, Vivillon, and Klinklang. Leftovers can be used on an offensive set for additional longevity. Choice Specs may sound appealing, but it's generally lacking, as Rotom-S doesn't have the coverage to break through defensive Pokemon very well and dislikes being locked into a move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-immune Pokemon</strong>: Lanturn is the biggest thorn in Rotom-S's side, as it stops Rotom-S from keeping up offensive momentum with Volt Switch while restoring a portion of its HP with Volt Absorb, takes a pittance from Air Slash, and can cure any burns with Heal Bell. However, Lanturn doesn't appreciate taking repeated hits from Hidden Power Grass or being Tricked a Choice Scarf. Rhydon is another Pokemon that troubles Rotom-S quite a bit, as it can easily take advantage of Rotom-S locked into Volt Switch or Air Slash by setting up Stealth Rock, using Rock Polish, or threatening it with Stone Edge. Though much less common, Electivire can gain a Speed boost from an Electric-type attack thanks to Motor Drive and threaten Rotom-S with Ice Punch. Claydol and Golurk are also decent checks, as both have enough natural bulk to withstand Air Slash and can retaliate with Ice Beam and Stone Edge, respectively; however, both get worn down very fast by burns, with the latter being heavily crippled due to having its Attack cut, and they don't appreciate taking Hidden Power Grass. Piloswine is also worth noting for its ability to pick off a weakened Rotom-S with Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Thanks to its excellent bulk, Audino can take repeated hits with impunity and restore lost HP with either Wish or Rest while curing any burns with Heal Bell. Mega Audino can respond by chipping away at Rotom-S with Dazzling Gleam or using it to set up Calm Mind freely. It's also worth noting that due to Mega Audino holding a Mega Stone, it cannot be crippled by Trick. Musharna checks Rotom-S in a similar manner, but it's heavily crippled when it's Tricked a Choice Scarf. Other Pokemon with naturally high special bulk such as Cryogonal, Aurorus, and Magmortar are decent answers, as they can easily take any attack and hit back with their respective STAB moves. Addtionally, Cryogonal is able to restore any lost HP with Recover.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Jynx and Tauros are able to revenge kill non-Choice Scarf variants of Rotom-S with Ice Beam and Rock Climb with prior damage, respectively, though the latter dislikes being hit by Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is a decent Electric-type STAB move that keeps up offensive momentum. Thunderbolt is an alternative for a more consistent, powerful STAB option, at the cost of keeping up momentum. Air Slash deals with Grass-types such as Torterra, Vileplume, and Lilligant and hits Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Hitmonchan, as well as having a decent chance to induce flinch. Hidden Power Water damages Pokemon that block Rotom-S's Volt Switch such as Rhydon, Camerupt, and Steelix. Alternatively, Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit Lanturn  and Quagsire while maintaining coverage on Rhydon but missing out on Steelix. Will-O-Wisp lets Rotom-S cripple and wear down Pokemon such as Lanturn, Rhydon, and Steelix and is also useful against other physical attackers such as Thick Fat Hariyama and Kangaskhan.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs plus a Timid nature are used to outspeed Jolly Pinsir and below, while maximum Special Attack EVs let Rotom-S hit as hard as possible. Expert Belt is used to let Rotom-S bluff a Choice Scarf, letting it lure Pokemon that think it's locked into Volt Switch or Air Slash, and gives an additional power boost to super effective hits.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Volt Switch early and often to keep up offensive momentum, though do be careful using the move against Electric-immune Pokemon, especially Lanturn, which can gain back a portion of its HP due to Volt Absorb. If the opponent has an Electric-immune Pokemon such as Lanturn or Rhydon, predict the incoming switch in by using Hidden Power Grass or Will-O-Wisp. In some cases, it's key to play Rotom-S as if it's using Choice Scarf, as it scares off normally faster Pokemon such as Floatzel and Archeops and can catch the opponent off-guard later in the game. Will-O-Wisp should be used to wear down and cripple Ground-type switch-ins such as Rhydon, making it much easier for a teammate to switch in, as well as other physical attackers such as Thick Fat Hariyama and Kangaskhan. It can also be used to play mind games with Sucker Punch users such as Shiftry, Cacturne, and Mawile, keeping Rotom-S from taking any additional damage before it picks them off with Air Slash. Rotom-S can also be used to pivot into Pokemon such as Scyther, Klinklang, Hariyama, and Archeops due to its slew of resistances; just be aware that Hariyama and Archeops can catch Rotom-S with Stone Edge. Also make sure that Rotom-S is healthy and that Stealth Rock is kept on the field if Rotom-S needs to check Archeops.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Klinklang is an excellent partner, as Rotom-S lures in and weakens many checks to it, such as Lanturn, Rhydon, and Quagsire, and hits other checks including Prinplup, Pelipper, and Hitmonchan, paving the way for Klinklang to sweep. Setup sweepers that appreciate the removal of Quagsire, such as Swords Dance Samurott and Rock Polish Rhydon, pair well with Rotom-S. Normal-types such as Tauros and Kangaskhan are great partners due to Rotom-S's ability to lure and heavily weaken Rhydon and Quagsire. Rhydon is a decent partner, as Rotom-S takes care of common checks to it such as Torterra, Prinplup, and Quagsire, letting Rhydon sweep through teams with ease. Mesprit appreciates Rotom-S's ability to threaten and eliminate Xatu, which lets Mesprit set up Stealth Rock without fear of getting them bounced back, and is also a good check to other Mesprit checks such as Scyther and Shiftry. Because Rotom-S pivots a lot throughout the match, it prefers having Stealth Rock off the field. Hitmonchan is a decent partner, as it can switch in on and threaten some problematic Stealth Rock users such as Regirock and Ferroseed while Rotom-S is able to switch in on Flying-type Pokemon such as Scyther, Vivillon, and Archeops lacking Stone Edge.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is a decently powerful Electric-type STAB move that lets Rotom-S maintain offensive momentum. It is, however, blocked by Pokemon such as Lanturn and Rhydon. Air Slash is Rotom-S's only Flying-type STAB move, coming with decent Base Power and a nice flinch chance, and it targets Grass-types that resist Volt Switch. Will-O-Wisp cripples checks to Rotom-S such as Rhydon and Lanturn while helping against other Pokemon such as Shiftry and Klinklang. Thunderbolt is an alternative for a more powerful Electric-type STAB move that doesn't force Rotom-S to switch out. Trick lets Rotom-S cripple defensive switch-ins, giving Rotom-S a better matchup against slower teams once it Tricks away its Choice Scarf.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs allow Rotom-S to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, and maximum Special Attack EVs allow Rotom-S to hit as hard as possible. The choice between a Modest and Timid nature depends on the team's needs; because Rotom-S is often used to check Fighting-types, it often has its Choice Scarf removed due to Knock Off as well as using Trick quite frequently, so it's generally the better option to maintain its Speed tier; however, Modest is an alternative to make up for this set's lacking power. Choice Scarf boosts Rotom-S's Speed, allowing it to revenge kill normally faster Pokemon such as Floatzel, Archeops, Scyther, and Tauros.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Generally, it's best to use Volt Switch throughout the match to maintain offensive momentum, but you must be mindful of using the move when Lanturn or Rhydon is on the opposing team, as both stop Rotom-S cold, with the former gaining HP back with Volt Absorb and the latter threatening Rotom-S with Stone Edge or getting a free opportunity to set up. To respond to Pokemon immune to Volt Switch, use Will-O-Wisp to cripple and wear them down. Against Lanturn, Rotom-S is better off Tricking its Choice Scarf, as Lanturn can heal off burns with Heal Bell. Additionally, Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple Sucker Punch users such as Pawniard, Mawile, and Shiftry. Though at some points it may be tempting to use Trick to cripple defensive Pokemon, try to keep Rotom-S's Choice Scarf if it's crucial for it to outspeed a fast threat such as Floatzel or Archeops. Though this set acts primarily as a revenge killer, Rotom-S can use its unique set of resistances to switch into Pokemon such as Scyther, Archeops, and Hariyama. Do be careful when switching in on Archeops and Hariyama, as both can swiftly take down Rotom-S by catching it on the switch with Stone Edge.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-types are the best partners, as they eliminate problematic Pokemon such as Lanturn and Rhydon while Rotom-S revenge kills Flying-types such as Archeops and Scyther. Lilligant is notable for its ability to use many of Rotom-S's defensive answers as setup bait and can even temporarily shut down a Pokemon with Sleep Powder. Shiftry appreciates Rotom-S's ability to check Fighting-types and can provide Defog support, allowing Rotom-S to switch in with less repercussions. Torterra is a more defensive partner that checks Lanturn and Rhydon by virtue of its favorable type matchup while also providing support in the form of Stealth Rock; in return, Rotom-S is able to threaten answers to Torterra such as Scyther, Archeops, and Xatu. Fighting-types are also good partners, because they appreciate Flying-types being revenge killed. Primeape is notable, as it breaks down numerous Pokemon with ease, with some of the more notable ones being Rhydon and Regirock, allowing Rotom-S to clean late-game without too many issues. It also forms a VoltTurn core with Rotom-S. Hitmonchan is also a decent partner for similar reasons, with the key difference lying in its ability to provide Rapid Spin support. Freeze-Dry users such as Vanilluxe and Aurorus are good partners, as they break down Lanturn and Rhydon effortlessly while Rotom-S covers their Steel- and Fighting-type weaknesses. Magmortar is an interesting partner for its ability to switch in on Ice-types that trouble Rotom-S as well as lure in Lanturn and KO it with Earthquake, with Rotom-S revenge killing faster threats to Magmortar such as Archeops and Floatzel in return. Just note, however, that pairing either of these Pokemon with Rotom-S requires a reliable form of entry hazard control due to the shared Stealth Rock weakness.</p>"

  "Mesprit": {
    "overview": "<p>Mesprit is NU's most versatile Pokemon thanks to its large movepool and balanced stats all-around that give it good bulk and attacking prowess, allowing it to run a variety of sets. Mesprit also has access to very good support moves in Stealth Rock and the coveted Healing Wish, which allows it to bring a weakened teammate back to full health, giving it another chance to break through the opposing team. Its Psychic typing plus Levitate gives Mesprit useful resistances to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, giving it many opportunities to switch in. However, the same typing also leaves it vulnerable to Pursuit trappers, most notably Skuntank, which can switch in on almost all of Mesprit's attacks, causing it to be a liability at times. Choice Scarf sets are also easily revenge killed by Sucker Punch users such as Shiftry and Skuntank. Mesprit also has average Speed for an offensive Pokemon, which leaves it struggling against more offensive teams. While Mesprit does have a wide movepool, it tends to struggle fitting all of the moves it wants on one set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to Mesprit's surprisingly good physical movepool, it can also run a Choice Band set consisting of Zen Headbutt / Knock Off / Fire Punch / U-turn. Physical Choice Scarf can also be used, but it's more prone to being walled by physical walls and has worse coverage. Future Sight is another option to pressure Fighting- and Poison-type Pokemon while Mesprit is not on the field. Power-Up Punch can also be used on non-Choiced physical sets to boost Mesprit's Attack while letting it switch between its coverage moves. Magic Coat can be used to reflect back opposing entry hazards and prevent Taunt from leads such as Stealth Rock Archeops. A dual screens set can also be used, but generally other support options provide more significant utility.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Skuntank, Shiftry, and Liepard are all good answers to Mesprit, as the first is able to switch on any move Mesprit has to offer with the exceptions of Hidden Power Ground and Choice Specs-boosted Ice beam, while all of them are capable of revenge killing Mesprit, no matter how fast it is, with Sucker Punch. Skuntank is also able to Pursuit trap Mesprit locked into Psychic, and the same goes for Liepard, which can additionally Encore Mesprit into an unfavorable move and set up Nasty Plot or cripple Choice Scarf variants greatly with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Scyther outspeeds all non-Choice Scarf Mesprit, threatens it with STAB U-turn, and, with Eviolite, can even use Mesprit as setup bait if it doesn't have Ice Beam or Thunderbolt. Scyther, however, doesn't appreciate being crippled by Thunder Wave. Pinsir naturally outspeeds Mesprit and threatens to OHKO non defensive Mesprit with a Life Orb-boosted X-Scissor.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steelix is able to switch into most of Mesprit's coverage moves and either greatly damage it with Heavy Slam or set up Stealth Rock. However, Steelix must be wary of Hidden Power Ground or Choice Specs-boosted Ice beam from offensive Mesprit sets. Klinklang is able to switch into most of Mesprit's attacks bar Hidden Power Ground and can use Mesprit to set up Shift Gear freely. Bulkier Steel-types such as Ferroseed, Bronzor, and Metang are generally able to take any move Mesprit has and use it to set up Spikes or Stealth Rock. Aggron is the shakiest check of all Steel-types due to its very low Special Defense and 4x weakness to Ground, but it can deal massive damage if not OHKO Mesprit with a Choice Band Head Smash.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Haunter, Mismagius, and Rotom naturally outspeed Mesprit and threaten it with Shadow Ball, though none of these Pokemon can safely switch in. Mismagius also commonly carries Taunt, which prevents Mesprit from setting up Stealth Rock or attempting to heal a teammate with Healing Wish.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Musharna and Mega Audino are capable of taking almost any hit from Mesprit and, as a result, can use Mesprit to set up Calm Mind with ease. However, Mega Audino loses to Calm Mind Mesprit one-on-one due to Psyshock hitting on its physical defense, which it cannot boost up. In addition, Musharna does not appreciate taking Life Orb Mesprit's Calm Mind-boosted Signal Beam. Xatu is able to take most moves from Mesprit with the exception of Ice Beam, prevent Stealth Rock from going up with Magic Bounce, and hit Mesprit with Signal Beam or cripple it with Thunder Wave. Malamar is bulky enough to use non-Signal Beam Mesprit to boost with Superpower and can threaten it with STAB Knock Off. Assault Vest Magmortar easily handles Mesprit lacking Psyshock due to its high special bulk and threatens to deal significant damage in return with a powerful Fire Blast.</p>",

Ice Beam 2HKOes Steelix after switching in on one layer of Spikes or on Stealth Rock twice and almost always 2HKOes Skuntank with no prior damage. It also targets Xatu, which can otherwise switch in safely. Signal Beam is crucial for dealing significant damage to Psychic-types such as Malamar, Musharna, Jynx, and opposing Mesprit. Healing Wish lets Mesprit sacrifice itself to bring a teammate back to peak condition. Shadow Ball is a decent alternative over Signal Beam, notably hitting Bronzor and dealing more damage to other Psychic-types. U-turn is used to maintain offensive momentum, but Mesprit prefers just nailing switch-ins with its sheer power and coverage. Trick can be useful for crippling bulky Calm Mind users such as Musharna and Xatu. Psyshock can be used in place of Psychic in order to hit Specially Defensive Pokemon such as Lanturn, Hariyama, and Clefairy harder, however is typically a worse option as it is significantly weaker than Psychic and less easy to spam over the course of a battle.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Mesprit's offensive capabilities, with a Modest nature being particularly crucial in order to achieve some important 2HKOs on Steelix and Skuntank. Choice Specs turns Mesprit into a fearsome wallbreaker, boosting its Special Attack to frightening levels. Timid is also an option for outspeeding special Skuntank in particular; however, this causes Mesprit to miss out on the aforementioned KOs.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mesprit is best brought in on Ground- and Fighting-type attacks such as Rhydon's Earthquake and Hariyama's Close Combat, though be wary of Megahorn from the former and Knock Off from the latter. While Psychic-resistant Pokemon are still around, throw out a coverage move in order to 2HKO them on the switch in. Be especially wary of using Psychic if Skuntank or Liepard is present because both can Pursuit trap Mesprit, dealing heavy damage if not knocking it out. After Dark- and Steel-types have been heavily weakened or eliminated, spam Psychic to ensure Mesprit 2HKOes or OHKOes every Pokemon in its way. Once Mesprit no longer is useful, use Healing Wish to heal a weakened teammate, particularly a setup sweeper, to give them a second shot at dismantling the opposition. Because of the ubiquity of its Stealth Rock set, Mesprit can also be used to catch foes off guard, dealing heavy damage in the process.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Despite being able to 2HKO both Skuntank and Steelix, Mesprit still appreciates a Pokemon that can switch in and threaten these two, as prediction cannot always be relied on. Rhydon fits very well because it fears little from either of these Pokemon and even uses them as a way to either set up Stealth Rock or boost its Speed with Rock Polish. As was implied earlier, this set needs entry hazards up in order to achieve certain 2HKOs. Garbodor is a decent choice for a Spikes setter, as it soft checks the likes of Shiftry and Skuntank and also weakens Psychic-resistant Pokemon such as Steelix with Focus Blast. Steelix is a good choice because it shuts down Musharna and Mega Audino, both of which, if given the opportunity, can set up on Mesprit locked into any of its moves, bar Signal Beam for the former. It also provides Stealth Rock support and switches into Pursuit variants of Skuntank. Late-game cleaners such as Swellow, Vivillon, and Lilligant appreciate teams being heavily weakened by Mesprit's attacks. The former two in particular struggle to break Steelix with their STAB moves, which Mesprit heavily weakens, while the latter appreciates Magmortar being weakened, a common Pokemon that can put Lilligant's sweep to a halt.</p>"

      "Offensive + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is Mesprit's most powerful and reliable STAB move, dealing high amounts of damage to Weezing and Garbodor. Psyshock is an alternative to hit Mega Audino, Assault Vest Hariyama, and Magmortar harder. Note that Psyshock should only be used alongside Calm Mind, as it gives Mesprit a slightly better matchup versus opposing Calm Mind users, most notably Mega Audino. Signal Beam has good coverage with Mesprit's Psychic STAB type, hitting targets such as Shiftry, Liepard, Malamar, Exeggutor, and Musharna. Ice Beam hits Xatu, Scyther, and Torterra, while still covering Shiftry and Exeggutor. Hidden Power Ground hits Skuntank, Steelix, Klinklang, and Mawile, which otherwise take Mesprit's attacks very well. Energy Ball is an alternative to nail Rhydon, Gastrodon, Samurott, Prinplup, and Lanturn. Healing Wish allows Mesprit to bring back a heavily damaged teammate. Calm Mind is an option over Healing Wish to make Mesprit hit very hard after a boost, allowing it to act as a bulky win condition. Thunderbolt hits Water-types neutral to Grass such as Mantine and Pelipper, as well as retaining coverage against Xatu and Scyther. Hidden Power Fire is also an option to mainly hit Ferroseed harder while retaining coverage against Klinklang and Mawile.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs allow Mesprit to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, while maximum Special Attack EVs allow it to hit as hard as possible. A Modest nature is preferred as Mesprit appreciates the additional boost in power. However, a Timid nature is also an option, as it allows Mesprit to outspeed Modest maximum Speed Magmortar, as well as Speed tie with opposing positive-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Shiftry and Kabutops. Life Orb is chosen for the good boost in damage output and allows Mesprit to switch between its moves, which lets it get the most mileage out of its great coverage. Colbur Berry in conjunction with Calm Mind ensures that Mesprit's sweep is not ended prematurely against a Dark-type. Another variant of this set involving four attacks is also an option if Healing Wish support is not desired, making Mesprit much harder for the opponent safely switch a Pokemon into.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use powerful Life Orb-boosted attacks early- and mid-game to break down the opponent's bulkier Pokemon. If the opponent has a Pursuit user, use the appropriate coverage move to catch them on the switch. Don't switch in Mesprit haphazardly; rather, bring it in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch or after a Pokemon has fainted, as Mesprit already gets worn down by Life Orb recoil. Healing Wish should be used when it is absolutely crucial to keep a teammate healthy against a threatening Pokemon on the opposing side or when a sweeper has been significantly weakened. Calm Mind is generally best used against balanced teams where Mesprit needs a bit more power to break through bulkier Pokemon; against offense, it is far more beneficial to attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primeape and Hariyama are excellent partners for Mesprit, as both are able to check Dark-types very well, while Mesprit takes down Garbodor and Weezing. Combusken is also a decent partner due to its ability to check Dark-types such as Shiftry, Pawniard, and Liepard. Swords Dance Mawile is a great partner, as it switches into Scyther and uses it as setup bait, while Mesprit breaks down Garbodor and Weezing and can replenish Mawile's HP and rid it of any status ailments with Healing Wish. Other setup sweepers such as Shiftry, Samurott, Lilligant, and Klinklang also greatly benefit from Healing Wish, and all of them appreciate Mesprit's early- and mid-game wallbreaking capabilities, making it easier for them to clean late-game. Mesprit tends to have issues breaking through Mega Audino and Musharna, so Skuntank and Haunter are good partners for their ability to threaten both with their respective STAB moves and prevent them from setting up or healing with Taunt. Skuntank is also able to Pursuit trap other Psychic-types, as well as eliminate faster Ghost-types, including Haunter, Rotom, and Mismagius.</p>"
      },
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock supports Mesprit's teammates, and Mesprit makes for a decent user of the move due to its ability to set it up against Pokemon it walls. Psychic lets Mesprit deal consistent damage, nailing Fighting- and Poison-types such as Gurdurr and Garbodor in particular. U-turn lets Mesprit keep up offensive momentum, allowing it to bring in teammates safely. Thunder Wave lets Mesprit cripple fast offensive Pokemon, giving slower teammates the advantage. Healing Wish is an alternative that allows Mesprit to bring a sweeper back to full HP and rid it of status. Coverage moves such as Energy Ball and Signal Beam to hit Rhydon and Malamar, respectively, can be used if your team is weak to these specific setup Pokemon. Rain Dance or Sunny day is also an option on the last slot to allow Mesprit to act as dedicated weather starter.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP EVs in tandem with 240 Defense EVs and a Bold nature allow Mesprit to take on physical attackers with ease. The remaining EVs go into Speed to let Mesprit outspeed Adamant Mawile and below. Leftovers gives Mesprit passive recovery, allowing it to last a little longer. Colbur Berry is another option to let Mesprit more reliably check certain Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Gurdurr while also letting it avoid being Pursuit trapped one time. Leftovers is another option to give Mesprit passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its heavy Defense investment, you can use Mesprit as a pivot into physical attackers. Try to set up Stealth Rock as soon as possible, and use it against a Pokemon that cannot do much in return. If Xatu is on the opposing team, anticipate its switch in by using U-turn to maintain offensive momentum and let a teammate take care of it. Thunder Wave is a good move to use against fast offensive Pokemon, aiding slower teammates to run through the opponent's team. Only attack with Psychic when Mesprit absolutely needs to get damage on Pokemon such as Hariyama and Garbodor. Healing Wish should generally be used when a vital teammate or setup sweeper has been significantly weakened. However, it shouldn't be used when there are Pokemon on the opposing team that Mesprit needs to check. If Mesprit is not holding a Colbur Berry, be wary of Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank and Liepard, and be more cautious when switching into Fighting-types, as Mesprit is vulnerable to Knock Off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mesprit pairs incredibly well with setup sweepers such as Mawile, Klinklang, Samurott, and Shiftry due to its ability to bring them in safely with U-turn, give them a second shot at sweeping with Healing Wish, and provide them with Thunder Wave support. Mesprit also switches into Fighting-types such as Hariyama, which Klinklang and Shiftry greatly benefit from. Wallbreakers such as Samurott and Aurorus pair well with this set, as Mesprit can slow down faster Pokemon with Thunder Wave and bring both of them in safely with a slow U-turn. Other U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Scyther, Zebstrika, and Lanturn are good teammates for Mesprit, as together they maintain offensive momentum while the opposing team gets worn down by repeatedly switching into Stealth Rock. More defensive partners such as Mega Audino can keep Mesprit healthy with Wish while also curing any status ailment with Heal Bell, while Mesprit is able to take on problematic Pokemon such as Garbodor. Miltank is also a decent partner, as it appreciates Mesprit's ability to switch into Fighting-types.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute gives Mesprit the ability to easily set up Calm Minds against defensive walls without worry of being worn down by status moves and weak attacks. With the given EV spread, it can easily set up Substitutes against defensive Pokemon such as Mega Audino, Lanturn's pivot set, and Xatu's pivot set. Calm Mind allows Mesprit to greatly boost its Special Attack and Special Defense, giving it the ability to break many defensive teams and to break through bulky Pokemon it otherwise cannot. Psyshock is a great STAB move for Mesprit, as it allows it to hit enemy Pokemon on their Defense stat rather than their Special Defense stat. This allows Mesprit to set up Calm Minds alongside, and win against, enemy Mega Audino, ignoring their Special Defense boosts, while also hitting Magmortar, Lanturn, and Hariyama much harder. Ice Beam provides excellent neutral coverage with Psyshock, hitting targets such as Steelix and Skuntank neutrally and getting a near-guaranteed OHKO against Shiftry after a boost. Ice Beam also gives Mesprit a much better matchup against physically bulky Pokemon such as Rhydon, Xatu, Torterra, and Gourgeist-XL. Alternatively, Signal Beam gives more reliability against enemy Psychic-type Calm Mind users, such as Mesprit and Musharna, and hits Shiftry and Malamar for very high damage, even when unboosted. However, running Signal Beam means that Mesprit cannot break through Steelix and has a significantly worse matchup against Pokemon such as Rhydon and Xatu.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximizing Speed EVs with a Timid nature allows Mesprit to Speed tie with major threats such as Shiftry and Kabutops, as well as outspeed Jolly Hitmonchan and maximum Speed Modest Magmortar. Leftovers is used here in order to provide Mesprit with passive recovery and allow it to set up more Substitutes. 48 Special Attack EVs give Mesprit a near-guaranteed chance to OHKO Shiftry with Ice Beam after a single Calm Mind boost. If needed, Mesprit can run an alternate spread of 200 HP / 56 SpA / 252 Spe, which guarantees a KO on Shiftry after a single Calm Mind boost, although it loses some Leftovers recovery. The remaining EVs are then put into HP, as it makes Mesprit's Substitutes much bulkier and allows it to set up on a larger number of Pokemon in the tier while maximizing Leftovers recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mesprit should be switched into many of the tier's defensive Pokemon, such as Mega Audino, Gastrodon, and Lanturn, and then set up a Substitute, as they often lack a way to break it. After it has a Substitute up, Mesprit can proceed to force out these Pokemon or easily set up Calm Minds on them. Mesprit is also able to force out a large number of the tier's Fighting- and Poison-types, such as Hariyama, Hitmonchan, and Weezing, as they do not appreciate taking a STAB Psyshock, and set up a Substitute or Calm Mind; however, it can often only switch in on a predicted double switch or Fighting-type attack, as it detests losing its Leftovers from a Knock Off, which Fighting-types often carry. Early- and mid-game, it is often better to attack your opponent's Pokemon, rather than trying to set up a Substitute, as it is not immediately apparent that the set used is a Calm Mind one, let alone with Substitute, so you may be able to capitalize on that later on in the game. Proper usage of Substitute allows Mesprit to potentially avoid taking damage from the Sucker Punches of Pokemon such as Skuntank and Shiftry, allowing it much more freedom to play around them. Additionally, it grants Mesprit a buffer to severely mitigate damage from opposing Pursuit users such as Skuntank.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mesprit is very vulnerable to Dark-type attackers, so it naturally pairs well with Fairy-types such as Mega Audino and Clefairy, as they often take very little damage from attacks such as Knock Off, appreciate Mesprit's ability to take on enemy Poison-types, and benefit from its ability to lure in Steelix and effectively damage it with Ice Beam. Thunder Wave support from Mega Audino, Clefairy, or Miltank helps this Mesprit set tremendously, as it allows it to outspeed a large number of threats such as Floatzel and Archeops and grants it more opportunities to set up Substitutes on many more Pokemon. Wish and Heal Bell support from Mega Audino can also assist this Mesprit set to play more aggressively in the mid-game, giving it more opportunities to switch into status while still being able to set up in the late-game. Fighting-type teammates such as Gurdurr, Hitmonchan, and Hariyama can come in on Dark-types, which threaten Mesprit, while Mesprit can easily come in on, threaten out, and set up a Substitute on the Poison-types that wall them. If Mesprit is running Signal Beam, it can even combat enemy Psychic-types, while Ice Beam variants also beat Xatu. As Ice Beam variants of this set struggle to effectively beat enemy Psychic-types, it can often be helpful to pair this Pokemon with Dark-types, which can threaten enemy Psychic- and Ghost-types, both of which can threaten Mesprit and prevent it from sweeping. In return, Mesprit can often set up on Pokemon such as Hariyama, Mega Audino, and Hitmonchan, all of which can often wall Dark-type attackers. Pokemon that lure in defensive Water- and Grass-types, such as Rotom, Samurott, or Barbaracle, are good partners for Mesprit, as it can easily come in on a predicted Grass- or Water-type switch in, and either set up, or fire off an attack for very low risk. Floatzel is especially notable for luring in these Pokemon and can revenge kill many Pokemon that normally outspeed Mesprit, such as Liepard, Tauros, and Archeops.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock supports Mesprit's teammates, and it makes for a good user of the move due to Levitate giving it a good matchup against Rhydon. Psychic is a reliable STAB move that hits targets such as Weezing and Garbodor very hard. Hidden Power Ground is useful for hitting Skuntank and Steel-types, such as Steelix, Klinklang, Mawile, for super effective damage. Ice Beam most notably hits Xatu, which will attempt to bounce back Stealth Rock, as well as hitting Torterra, Shiftry, Scyther, and Rhydon. Healing Wish brings an ally back to full HP and cures any status ailments. Signal Beam primarily hits Malamar, as well as Musharna, Shiftry, and opposing Mesprit. U-turn is another option to keep up offensive momentum and potentially let a teammate safely switch in. Psyshock is an alternative to Psychic to hit Mega Audino, Assault Vest Hariyama, and Magmortar harder. Energy Ball scores the OHKO on Rhydon and Gastrodon and does good damage to both Lanturn and Prinplup. Thunderbolt is also an option for hitting bulky Water-types such as Prinplup, Pelipper, and Mantine, as well as retaining coverage on Xatu. Hidden Power Fire lets Mesprit mainly hit Ferroseed while also getting damage on other Steel-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs plus a Modest nature allow Mesprit to let it hit as hard as possible, while maximum Speed EVs let it Speed tie with other neutral base 80 Speed Pokemon. A Timid nature is also an option as it lets Mesprit outspeed Modest Magmortar as well as Speed tie with positive base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Shiftry and Kabutops. Life Orb increases Mesprit's damage output, most notably getting a guaranteed OHKO on Malamar with Signal Beam and 2HKOing Skuntank after Stealth Rock with Hidden Power Ground. Leftovers is an alternative for added longevity at the cost of drop in power. Colbur Berry is also an option that allows Mesprit to act as a more reliable check to certain Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Gurdurr as well as avoid being trapped by Pursuit one time. Levitate is Mesprit's only ability, but it is very useful for providing an immunity to Ground-type moves and all entry hazards bar Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set generally makes for a good lead thanks to its favorable matchup against most Stealth Rock users. If Xatu is on the opposing team, avoid the use of Stealth Rock and instead use Ice Beam or, if not running the move, make a double switch to a Pokemon that threatens it, such as Skuntank or Liepard. If Mesprit is not running Colbur Berry, be cautious when switching into Hariyama, as both deal heavy damage with Knock Off. Try to play carefully with Mesprit when a Pursuit user is on the opposing side, as keeping Mesprit around may be crucial if it is the team's only way to check Fighting-types. Healing Wish should only be used in situations where a teammate needs to stay healthy in order to check a specific threat or if a sweeper has been heavily weakened or crippled by status.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Samurott, Swords Dance Shiftry, and Rock Polish Rhydon are excellent partners, as all three of them appreciate Stealth Rock support and can be played more recklessly thanks to Healing Wish support. Rhydon in particular pairs well with Mesprit, as it threatens Skuntank and uses it as setup bait, while Mesprit checks Fighting-types including Hariyama and Gurdurr, all of which can halt Rhydon's attempt to sweep. Dark-types such as Liepard and Skuntank are an issue for Mesprit, especially when it's not using a Colbur Berry, as both are able to Pursuit trap Mesprit; therefore, Hariyama and Primeape make for excellent partners, as they threaten both of them greatly, while Mesprit's Stealth Rock support discourages one of their best offensive checks in Scyther from switching in. Skuntank also works well for its ability to Pursuit trap Xatu as well as Ghost-types that threaten Mesprit, while in return, Mesprit covers Skuntank's lone weakness to Ground and is able to threaten Fighting-types that give Skuntank issues.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is Mesprit's most powerful and reliable STAB move and doubles as a decent late-game cleaning tool. Ice Beam is very useful for Mesprit to revenge kill Pokemon such as Archeops, Scyther, Swellow, and Lilligant, as well as hitting Xatu, Torterra, and Rhydon. Signal Beam is an alternative to hit Malamar, Musharna, Jynx, Shiftry, Lilligant, and opposing Mesprit. U-turn is great for retaining offensive momentum, notably letting Mesprit switch out safely on expected switches to a Pursuit user. Healing Wish brings a teammate back to full HP and cures it of status, at the cost of sacrificing Mesprit. Thunderbolt is another option to hit Water-types such as Floatzel, Prinplup, Mantine, and Pelipper, in addition to already hitting Archeops, Scyther, Swellow, and Xatu. Psyshock can be used over Psychic to hit targets such as Cryogonal, Assault Vest Magmortar, and Hariyama much harder. Trick is another option over Healing Wish to cripple a wall, but the utility of Healing Wish makes this inferior most of the time.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs allow Mesprit to hit as hard as possible, while maximum Speed EVs ensure it outspeeds as many Pokemon possible. A Modest nature is generally preferred for more attacking power, but Timid is another option to outspeed Jolly Rock Polish Rhydon. Choice Scarf boosts Mesprit's Speed significantly, allowing it to outspeed and revenge kill a good majority of the unboosted metagame. Levitate gives Mesprit a Ground immunity, which can allow it to switch in unscathed and makes it less prone to being worn down by entry hazards.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mesprit should almost always be brought in after a Pokemon has fainted or with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. Mesprit should also take advantage of Levitate and its typing to pivot into Ground-, Fighting-, and Psychic-type attacks. Early-game, when answers to Mesprit are still around, use U-turn to switch out on their expected switch in to retain offensive momentum. Try to prioritize keeping Mesprit healthy for a Pokemon that it is able to revenge kill. Once Mesprit's checks and counters are weakened, clean up late-game with the appropriate move. Healing Wish should generally be used if an important teammate or setup sweeper has been significantly weakened.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits well on teams that need a fast Psychic-type to revenge kill faster Fighting-types such as Primeape while also keeping up offensive momentum, so partners such as Archeops and Klinklang pair well with it. Both also appreciate Healing Wish support, as it can bring the former out of Defeatist range and gives the latter a second shot at sweeping the opposing team. Skuntank is also a good partner due to its ability to threaten both Musharna and Mega Audino, both of which are bulky enough to take repeated hits easily from Mesprit. Entry hazard support is very beneficial for Mesprit, as it allows Mesprit to clean late-game with much more ease. Garbodor is an excellent partner, as it sets up hazards against several of Mesprit's answers such as Scyther and Mega Audino. Setup sweepers including Samurott, Shiftry, and Lilligant pair incredibly well with Mesprit, because all of them appreciate Healing Wish support. Swords Dance Mawile in particular is a great partner, as it switches into Scyther and Skuntank easily, while Mesprit takes care of problematic Pokemon such as Garbodor and Weezing and can give Mawile a second chance at sweeping with Healing Wish.</p>"
      },
      "Weather Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rain Dance doubles the Speed of Swift Swim Pokemon and strengthens the power of Water-type attacks, while Sunny Day doubles the Speed of Chlorophyll users while boosting the power of Fire-type attacks. Stealth Rock is used to break Focus Sashes, which is extremely important on weather teams, as a Focus Sash Pokemon can cripple one of your sweepers before they can do much. Furthermore, Stealth Rock punishes opposing switches, which is especially helpful because loop switching is a common tactic used to burn weather turns while taking minimum damage. U-turn can be used as a momentum grabber, allowing weather sweepers, which tend to be frail, to come in for free on a slow pivot. Psychic provides Mesprit with a STAB attack so that it is not completely passive and can threaten Pokemon such as Garbodor. Psyshock is another option to better hit Hariyama, which weather teams tend to struggle with because of its high special bulk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs with 240 Defense EVs and a Bold nature allow Mesprit to come in on many physical attackers in the tier such as Kangaskhan and Hitmonchan, which can pressure Omastar and Kabutops with strong priority. The 16 extra EVs go into Speed to allow Mesprit to outpace Adamant Aggron and Jolly Rhydon. Damp Rock and Heat Rock allow Mesprit to keep up rain and sun, respectively, longer.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mesprit makes for a phenomenal lead on weather teams due to the role compression it provides with both weather moves and Stealth Rock as well as its ability to take on common threats to weather teams such as Hitmonchan and Hariyama. Mesprit should usually set up Stealth Rock and then weather; however, should the situation arise where Mesprit can only use one, the first choice should almost always be weather, since this benefits the team more immediately and significantly. It is typically best to preserve Mesprit for later in the game so it can set up weather again and continue to check threatening attackers. Sometimes it is not worth setting up rain at the risk of it being outsped and Taunted or having its weather rock removed via Knock Off. After Mesprit has done its job, it should always immediately U-turn out, because without Thunder Wave or much offensive presence, Mesprit can be set up on by a good number of threats. Be wary of Dark-types, as they completely wall this set, and be particularly careful against Liepard, as not only can Mesprit not touch it outside of U-turn, but it can also come in when Mesprit sets up weather, threaten to cripple it with Encore, and then U-turn out as Mesprit hard switches, snatching momentum away, which can severely cripple weather teams. The wisest way to handle Dark-types is to predict their switch and U-turn as they come in, preventing them from trapping Mesprit and getting off a good amount of damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rain sweepers such as Ludicolo, Kabutops, and Omastar are best paired with Rain Dance Mesprit because they can take advantage of the rain with Swift Swim and boosted STAB moves. Sun sweepers such as Sawsbuck and Shiftry are good partners with Sunny Day Mesprit because they can use the sun to boost their Speed with Chlorophyll. Fire-types that can take advantage of the sun, such as Charizard and Pyroar, are good partners as well, as they can hit extremely hard with sun-boosted STAB moves. Fast weather setters like Liepard and Electrode are ideal because they can outspeed the whole metagame and virtually guarantee that weather is set up. Garbodor forms a useful anti-Fighting-type defensive core with Mesprit and provides additional hazards that support weather sweepers immensely.</p>"

  "Samurott": {
    "overview": "<p>Gifted with great mixed attacking stats and a boosting move in Swords Dance, Samurott is a versatile threat capable of being either a powerful wallbreaker with nuclear Hydro Pumps or one of the best sweepers in the metagame. Samurott also boasts a solid typing, defensively and offensively, backed by acceptable defenses for an offensive Pokemon, letting it check Fire-, Ground-, and Rock-types such as Pyroar, Rhydon, and Archeops. STAB priority in Aqua Jet is the cherry on top, allowing Samurott to clean weakened teams after a Swords Dance boost and revenge kill faster Pokemon throughout the game. Unfortunately, Samurott is relatively slow, leaving it outsped by most offensive Pokemon and, accordingly, overreliant on Aqua Jet and vulnerable to getting revenge killed. Moreover, Samurott is checked by common Grass- and Water-types such as Vileplume, Ludicolo, Lanturn, and Poliwrath, in addition to physically bulky Pokemon such as Weezing and Garbodor if running the physical set and specially bulky Pokemon such as Hariyama and Mega Audino if running the special set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Though the special set really appreciates its wide coverage, it can sometimes sacrifice a slot for another move. Substitute is an option to ease prediction and makes Samurott harder to revenge kill overall. Dragon Tail can be used on Spikes-stacking teams to weaken the opposing team and bring Samurott's checks into KO range. Superpower nails Ferroseed, though it doesn't hit anything else notable. Hidden Power Electric can be used on the special set to hit the likes of Pelipper, Mantine, and Poliwrath.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Faster Grass-types such as Lilligant, Shiftry, and Servine take little damage from Aqua Jet and can easily KO Samurott. Bulky Grass-types such as Vileplume, Ferroseed, and the Gourgeist formes wall the Swords Dance set, but a lot of them have trouble dealing with the special set.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Most bulky Water-types can take any two hits from both of Samurott's sets and retaliate with status move, a Scald burn, or a secondary STAB move. Gastrodon and Lanturn in particular are very common counters to the physical and the special set, respectively, with the former being immune to Waterfall due to Storm Drain, and Poliwrath and Mantine are general counters to both sets if Samurott doesn't pack the appropriate coverage move.</p> <p><strong>Respective Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Physically bulky Pokemon such as Weezing, Miltank, and Garbodor can take even boosted hits from the Swords Dance set and burn, paralyze, or KO Samurott with Rocky Helmet and Aftermath damage, respectively. Meanwhile, specially bulky Pokemon such as Hariyama and Audino are decent checks to the special set.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon That Can Take an Aqua Jet</strong>: Due to Samurott's underwhelming Speed stat, a lot of Pokemon, such as Jynx and Tauros, can outspeed Samurott and take even a +2 Aqua Jet, revenge killing both sets with some prior damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance enables Samurott to sweep, boosting its Attack stat to high levels. Aqua Jet makes up for Samurott's middling Speed and KOes many faster weakened threats at +2, and it can also be used throughout the game to revenge kill foes. Waterfall is a more powerful STAB move that breaks through slower, bulkier foes after a boost. Megahorn gives Samurott super effective coverage against Grass-types such as Torterra, Ludicolo, and Lilligant, and hits opposing Water-types neutrally. Knock Off is an option to hit the Gourgeist formes super effectively in addition to hitting Mantine and Pelipper neutrally, giving Samurott a better matchup against stall teams but leaving it with significantly less powerful coverage against other, generally more common Grass- and Water-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Samurott packs a simple offensive EV spread, making Samurott as fast and strong as possible, with an Adamant nature giving it a much-appreciated boost in power. A Jolly nature is an option to outspeed neutral-natured Ludicolo and opposing Samurott, in addition to the various Pokemon that creep the base 70 Speed benchmark. 112 HP / 252 Atk / 144 Spe can be used for more bulk, with enough Speed to outrun fully invested Adamant Torterra as well as neutral-natured base 55 Speed Pokemon, such as Cacturne, Exeggutor, and Golurk. Lum Berry allows Samurott to set up without having to fear status ailments from the likes of Weezing and Scald users such as Prinplup. Wave Incense boosts the power of Samurott's Water-type STAB moves without recoil. Life Orb is useful for a stronger Megahorn, but the recoil severely hinders Samurott's longevity. Rindo Berry lets Samurott avoid being revenge killed by Lilligant and Ludicolo, which are oftentimes an offensive team's only response to a +2 Samurott. An EV spread of 252 Atk / 100 SpD / 156 Spe with an Adamant nature should be used, as it Samurott can avoid being revenge killed by Electric-types, such as Rotom and Lanturn, by holding a Wacan Berry; however, this is somewhat less useful than Rindo Berry, as Samurott can KO weakened, faster Electric-types with Aqua Jet. Torrent makes it significantly easier for Samurott to sweep late-game thanks to the boost it gives to Samurott's Water-type STAB moves, as Samurott will often find itself below 33% health after it sets up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Samurott should typically be saved for late-game, only being used before then to revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Archeops, check Pokemon such as Rhydon, and possibly dish out a Megahorn or two to weaken checks such as Lanturn and Prinplup. However, Samurott is mostly useless if one of its counters, such Vileplume, the Gourgeist formes, or Poliwrath, is on the opposing team, so it should double switch to a teammate that threatens them to at least force them to take entry hazard damage. If necessary, Samurott can act as a check to the likes of Archeops and Pyroar, but it can only switch into them one time and is often left at such low HP that it probably won't be able to set up and sweep late-game; on the flip side, it can then use its Torrent-boosted STAB moves to wallbreak. Late-game, Samurott can set up a Swords Dance against a foe that can't do too much to it, such as Pyroar locked into a Fire-type move or even the likes of Hariyama and Archeops if Samurott is at high HP, often leaving it in Torrent range, and then it can proceed to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Checks to Grass-types are important partners, with Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-types such as Pyroar, Aurorus, and Scyther covering them well; Garbodor is also a notable partner, as it not only walls Grass-types but can also set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes to get them into +2 Megahorn KO range. Grass- and Electric-types and Freeze-Dry users such as Torterra, Rotom, and Vanilluxe take care of the bulky Water-types that check Samurott. Ground- and Grass-types, such as Rhydon and Lilligant, are also nice partners for their ability to handle Electric-types. Fast Pokemon such as Archeops, Zebstrika, and Tauros cover Samurott's low Speed stat and improve its team's matchup against more offensive teams. Wallbreakers such as mixed Archeops, Aurorus, Mawile, and Beheeyem can weaken or even outright beat most walls standing in the way of Samurott's sweep with relative ease. Healing Wish support from the likes of Mesprit and Musharna is helpful to potentially give Samurott a second chance at sweeping and is especially useful when Samurott is using Wave Incense, as it compensates for the loss of status protection given by Lum Berry.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Samurott's strongest viable Water-type STAB move and plows through anything that doesn't resist it. Ice Beam nails the Grass-types that resist Hydro Pump, such as Vileplume, Tangela, and the Gourgeist formes. Aqua Jet hits faster Pokemon such as Archeops and Pyroar, letting Samurott act as a decent check to them. Grass Knot targets Gastrodon, Poliwrath, and opposing Samurott, which wall this set otherwise. Megahorn is an alternative that hits Lanturn on its lower Defense stat, OHKOes Ludicolo and Jynx, and hits most Water-types neutrally. Taunt prevents Pokemon such as Audino and Ferroseed from recovering health or using utility moves, allowing Samurott to beat them one-on-one. Knock Off hits most of Megahorn's targets neutrally, in addition to Mantine, and is able to remove Prinplup's Eviolite and Hariyama's Assault Vest; however, it's weaker than Megahorn, especially if the foe's item has already been removed, and doesn't hit Ludicolo and Cradily super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Samurott packs a simple offensive spread, making it as fast and strong as possible, with a Rash or Mild nature giving Samurott an extra boost in power in its special moves while not weakening its physical ones. Rash lets Samurott check physical attackers such as Rhydon and Archeops better, while Mild lets it handle special Fire-types better. Alternatively, a Naive or Hasty nature allows Samurott to outspeed Modest Ludicolo and opposing Samurott. Life Orb makes Samurott an extremely powerful wallbreaker by boosting all of Samurott's moves. Torrent makes Hydro Pump ridiculously powerful when under 33% HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Samurott can come in on Rock- and Ground-types, preferably while they set up Stealth Rock, and slower, specially frail Pokemon such as Weezing and launch a powerful Hydro Pump. Even if the opponent has Grass-types such as Vileplume, Tangela, and the Gourgeist formes, Samurott doesn't have to predict with Ice Beam, as the combination of Hydro Pump and Ice Beam easily KOes them. However, it's best to nail Lanturn and, to a lesser extent, Ludicolo, Jynx, and Cradily switch-ins, with Megahorn, 3HKOing Lanturn, 2HKOing Cradily, and OHKOing Ludicolo and Jynx, as they can all easily shrug off Hydro Pump due to their resistance or immunity to the move. If the opponent has a hard counter to Samurott, such as Poliwrath or Mantine depending on its coverage, it's best to switch out to a teammate that threatens them and force them out to make them take entry hazard damage. Samurott can be used as a check to the likes of Archeops and Pyroar if necessary, nailing them with Aqua Jet or even using them as an opportunity to launch another attack if you predict the foe will switch, but Samurott will often be left with barely any HP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass- and Electric-types and Freeze-Dry users, such as Lilligant, Rotom, and Vanilluxe, beat the bulky Water-types that check Samurott, such as Lanturn, Poliwrath, and Mantine. While special Samurott has a good matchup against slower Grass-types thanks to its strong, Life Orb-boosted Ice Beam and Megahorn, it still wants partners to handle faster Grass-types such as Lilligant; Vileplume, Garbodor, and Fire-types make for decent partners in this regard. Pokemon such as Klinklang, Barbaracle, Zebstrika, Lilligant, and Pyroar can sweep teams after Samurott breaks down their walls, as Samurott can weaken or even outright beat the Grass- and Water-types and general bulky Pokemon that prevent them from sweeping. Though Samurott has the bulk to switch into weak and resisted hits, it really appreciates U-turn and Volt Switch support from the likes of Scyther, Rotom, and Manectric, whose common checks are handled by Samurott, in order to be able to come in unscathed.</p>"

  "Stoutland": {
    "overview": "<p>Stoutland faces stiff competition from the abundance of Normal-types in the tier such as Zangoose, Kangaskhan, and Tauros, which all almost completely outclass it, but Stoutland finds its niche in Sand Rush, which doubles its Speed in sand. Stoutland also has good Attack and usable bulk for an offensive Pokemon, making it a lethal sweeper and wallbreaker with the right support. Unfortunately, it is dependent on sand being up for it to outspeed threats, and because of this, Hippopotas is a mandatory teammate.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sleep Talk can allow Stoutland to switch in to absorb sleep moves. A Scrappy or Intimidate Stoutland set is an option, but it isn't worthwhile because it is overshadowed by immediate Normal-type attackers like Tauros, Kangaskhan, and Zangoose. Another option is Play Rough, but it isn't really worth it because it only hits Malamar and Hariyama and doesn't hit much harder than Return. Life Orb is an option, but the power drop is noticeable. Life Orb also cuts into Stoutland's bulk, taking away HP after every attack. A Silk Scarf set with Rain Dance or Sunny Day can be used to help a teammate sweep when Stoutland fails to.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Lack of Sand</strong>: Outside of sand, Stoutland is slow and easier to KO. Common offensive Pokemon can revenge kill it outside of sand such as Primeape, Tauros, and Archeops.</p> <p><strong>Other Weather</strong>: Opposing weather teams take away Stoutland's sand and usually have a favorable matchup because rain and sun rely on two setters and can usually overwhelm sand.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Hitmonchan, Skuntank, Shiftry, and Zangoose can pick off Stoutland when it is low on health, although its fair bulk allows it to survive a priority attack if it's healthy enough. Kangaskhan is particularly noteworthy because of its combination of Fake Out and Sucker Punch, allowing it to stall out sand turns. Liepard can neuter Stoutland with Prankster Thunder Wave. Hitmonchan and Poliwrath can hit Stoutland with super effective priority.</p> <p><strong>Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types</strong>: Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types such as Rhydon, Klinklang, Steelix, and Rotom prevent Stoutland from just spamming Return, but they don't appreciate taking a coverage move on the predicted switch. Regirock can take even a Superpower and cripple Stoutland with Thunder Wave. Klinklang and Rhydon can easily take advantage of Stoutland locked into Return for free setup opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Weezing and Garbodor can take a hit and cripple or wear Stoutland down in return.</p> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes</strong>: Toxic Spikes users such as Weezing, Garbodor, and Roselia lay down entry hazards that wear down Stoutland and its teammates quickly throughout the battle.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sand Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is a powerful STAB attack and Stoutland's main attacking move. Crunch is a good coverage move to hit Ghost-types. Superpower can hit Pokemon that resist Return such as Klinklang, Carracosta, Rhydon, Regirock, and Ferroseed very hard. Pursuit is a good option to trap Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Kadabra, Haunter, and Rotom. Trapping Ghost-types helps Stoutland spam Return late-game, although it risks being burned if the target isn't in KO range of Pursuit. Facade is another option, allowing Stoutland to function even when burned and get powered up by status.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature along with maximum Attack investment and the Choice Band allows Stoutland to hit as hard as possible. A Jolly nature can be used to outpace Adamant Kangaskhan and Zangoose when sand isn't up, but Stoutland shouldn't be sweeping outside of sand anyway and the extra power is appreciated. Maximum Speed investment along with Sand Rush allows Stoutland to outpace nearly the entire NU metagame when sand is up; it even outspeeds many Speed-boosting sweepers after a single boost, such as +1 Lilligant.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Stoutland being too slow to sweep outside of sand, try to only bring it in under sand to avoid it getting outsped and taking hits. In order to keep sand up, keep Hippopotas healthy throughout the battle. Try to predict Normal-type checks such as Klinklang, Rotom, Steelix, Rhydon, and Regirock on the switch and hit them hard with Crunch or Superpower to avoid wasting sand turns using an ineffective move. Stoutland can be used as a wallbreaker or a late-game cleaner.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hippopotas is mandatory, as it is the only automatic sand setter in the NU tier, supplying the sand necessary for Stoutland to get its Speed boost. Sandslash is another Sand Rush wallbreaker that can break past Rock- and Steel-types, which stop Stoutland from just spamming Return. Stoutland forces a lot of switches and thus appreciates entry hazard stackers on top of Hippopotas like Garbodor and Cacturne to help secure KOs, such as a 2HKO on defensive Rhydon with Superpower after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Stoutland fits best on offensively oriented teams so it can perform its role as a late-game sweeper or strong wallbreaker. Pokemon that have good offensive synergy with Stoutland, such as Magmortar and Samurott, are good options. Double Dance Rhydon, Poliwrath, and Lilligant are in a similar boat and can open up holes for each other to sweep late-game. Poliwrath, Lilligant, and Samurott can help break down Rock- and Steel-types alongside Sandslash for Stoutland to spam Return.</p>"

  "Liepard": {
    "overview": "<p>Prankster is one of the best abilities in the game, and Liepard can capitalize on it by using support moves such as Encore, Thunder Wave, and Rain Dance or Sunny Day to help its teammates. The threat of Encore alone can prevent the opponent's sweepers from setting up early in the match, while Thunder Wave provides a good catch-all response to sweepers that have already set up or faster threats like Floatzel in general. Meanwhile, this same ability also makes Liepard the face of many weather teams in NU, guaranteeing that at least one sweeper on their team will get a chance to shine regardless of the circumstances. STAB Knock Off, Sucker Punch, and Pursuit are also powerful tools that Liepard can use to cripple the opponent's Pokemon and inflict good damage. Liepard can even become a decent late-game sweeper itself with Nasty Plot, Dark Pulse, and Copycat, bypassing other priority attackers such as Shiftry and Samurott to become a unique threat. However, Liepard is extremely frail and shouldn't switch into anything other than obvious Psychic-type attacks; even then, Liepard risks being OHKOed by a stray Signal Beam from many Psychic-type Pokemon. It also lacks the raw power to break past bulky foes, limiting its effectiveness as an all-out attacker, and it struggles to fit all of the tools it wants on the same moveset. These factors make Liepard highly reliant both on good prediction when dealing with most foes to avoid being KOed and make the most of its opportunities to support its teammates and on good teambuilding to compensate for the moves it chooses not to run.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An all-out Life Orb attacker set can be used to lure and eliminate certain threats, running Play Rough to hit Fighting- and Dark-type Pokemon, Gunk Shot to hit Mega Audino, and Grass Knot to hit Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Rhydon particularly hard. A sweeping set with Hone Claws and Gunk Shot is very effective at letting Liepard lure and KO Mega Audino, but such a set has much less value than the standard set in most situations due to its lack of support moves and its lack of power and priority compared to the Choice Band and Nasty Plot sets. Trick lets Liepard swap a Choice Band or Choice Scarf onto a wall and could be used well on all-out attacking sets, but Encore is just as good at disrupting opponents on non-Choice sets and can be used more than once in a match, boasting greater reliability. Taunt is an alternative to Encore that can be used to stop non-attacking moves altogether. Aside from stopping entry hazards, however, Liepard can generally get more utility out of Encore, as a foe locked into one specific move is much easier to exploit than an opponent locked into attacking moves in general. Yawn can also be used to force foes to switch or put them to sleep, providing setup opportunities for teammates, and doesn't depend on the opponent using non-attacking moves, but again, Encore is generally more consistent. Finally, if no non-attacking moves are used, Limber gives Liepard a handy immunity to Thunder Wave and other paralysis moves, while Unburden gives Liepard a hefty-if-unnecessary speed boost if it can survive a Knock Off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: Liepard can't hit Fighting-types for decent damage without niche options such as Play Rough, and they can wallop it back with their STAB moves, with even non-STAB Knock Offs doing decent damage. Guts Hariyama also gets a boost if Liepard tries to hit it with Thunder Wave, although Combusken and Primeape in particular hate being paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Mega Audino takes pitiful damage from anything other than Choice Band-boosted Gunk Shot. Meanwhile, Dazzling Gleam does heavy damage, although Mega Audino often won't set up due to the threat of Encore. Clefairy can similarly strike back with Moonblast but doesn't particularly like losing its Eviolite to Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Liepard struggles to inflict much damage to bulky Pokemon such as Vileplume, Steelix, and defensive Garbodor, especially after their items have been removed by Knock Off. Meanwhile, they can all inflict significant damage to Liepard, which can't really do much in response other than U-turn or switch out.</p> <p><strong>Weather Setters</strong>: Abomasnow, Aurorus, and Hippopotas can automatically remove any weather conditions Liepard tries to set with their abilities, disrupting its team's strategy entirely. Furthermore, the former two can launch strong attacks to either KO Liepard or heavily damage one of its teammates, while Hippopotas can easily set up Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is one of the best moves in the tier and serves as a powerful STAB attack that Liepard can use to either revenge kill weakened threats or cripple bulkier responses by removing their items. Encore has fantastic synergy with Prankster, allowing Liepard to lock stat-boosting sweepers into moves such as Quiver Dance and Shift Gear so that it can attack them repeatedly, paralyze them, or switch to a teammate. It can also be used to punish Defog, Stealth Rock, Substitute, and many other non-attacking moves and to lock Psychic-types into their STAB attack if they want to try to KO Liepard with Signal Beam, making them easy to Pursuit trap if it's desired. Thunder Wave is a good option on bulky offense teams, paralyzing faster threats such as Tauros and Floatzel so that they can be finished off later on by slower teammates. It can also be used as an emergency response to sweepers such as Vivillon and Lilligant, as well as to weather sweepers if they manage to set up and use an attacking move before Liepard can disrupt them with Encore. Sucker Punch is a powerful priority attack and is superior to Thunder Wave on offense teams, which would rather have Liepard attempt to KO these threats directly or at least weaken them enough to be KOed by a faster teammate. U-turn also synergizes well with Encore and Thunder Wave, allowing Liepard to pivot out the turn after locking down the opponent's Pokemon. It capitalizes on the many switches Liepard forces and allows a teammate to come in for free if the foe stays in for some reason. Pursuit can be used alongside Sucker Punch and Encore, letting Liepard be a good trapper for offensive teams that struggle with Psychic-type Pokemon such as Calm Mind Musharna and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Rotom and Haunter.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature ensure that Liepard can use Encore before any other Pokemon can act, even other Prankster users, and ensures that Liepard can outrun Mismagius and Kadabra and revenge kill them. An Adamant nature can be used to power up Pursuit and other STAB attacks while still letting Liepard outspeed Timid Rotom. Maximum Attack investment ensures that Knock Off is able to reliably revenge kill weakened targets and inflict good chip damage during the early-game while also making U-turn able to do good damage to Malamar. Black Glasses boosts all of Liepard's STAB moves and is generally superior to Life Orb due to the lack of recoil. However, a Life Orb can be used if a more powerful U-turn is desired.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Liepard's main aim is to support its teammates and give them good opportunities to either set up and sweep or break through the opponent's team. Liepard should not try to switch into foes unless it is very likely they will be using a non-attacking move, as it will be OHKOed by practically any neutral STAB attack. If they are very likely to use a non-attacking move, however, such as Lilligant using Quiver Dance after putting one of your Pokemon to sleep with Sleep Powder, Liepard should switch in, as the threat of Encore will either force them to switch out or lock them into their boosting move to be taken down by Knock Off and Pursuit. Sacrificing Liepard to land Thunder Wave on a foe is sometimes necessary to ensure a teammate can sweep in the late-game. Do not use Thunder Wave against bulky Pokemon, as they will likely just take the opportunity to wallop Liepard for no real penalty. Sucker Punch should only be used against faster Pokemon, and only if it is likely that they will try to attack Liepard. Otherwise, Liepard should use Encore to lock them into moves such as Roost and Substitute or use U-turn to pivot out. Knock Off can be spammed in the early-game at little cost and be used to cripple certain bulky foes by removing their item, such as Sliggoo and Ferroseed's Eviolite, making them easier for teammates to deal with. Pursuit should be used when a foe is locked into an unfavorable move, such as Psychic or Stealth Rock after being Encore locked, and is likely to switch. It can also be used if a foe is likely to switch out to avoid being revenge killed by Knock Off, such as a weakened Magmortar. However, Psychic- and Ghost-types commonly run Colbur Berry to make them less vulnerable to Dark-type attacks, so try to trigger the Berry before Pursuit trapping them, and avoid using the move in risky situations, particularly where Liepard risks being burned by Will-O-Wisp if it stays in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers highly appreciate Liepard's ability to lock down foes with Encore and U-turn and provide them with switch in and setup opportunities. Speed-boosting sweepers such as Vivillon, Ludicolo, and Barbaracle are especially deadly with the free turn that Liepard can provide them with. Fast offensive Pokemon such as Archeops and Floatzel similarly like Liepard's ability to shut down opposing setup sweepers that could threaten them later in the match. Fighting-type Pokemon such as Primeape and Hitmonchan synergize well with Liepard, as it can effectively trap and remove problematic foes to these Pokemon, such as Musharna, Rotom, and Mesprit, with Encore and Pursuit. Poison-type Pokemon can switch into the Fairy- and Fighting-types that like to switch into Liepard, such as Mega Audino and Hariyama. Garbodor is an especially good teammate, as it can provide Spikes support to help Liepard whittle down foes throughout the match, while Liepard can trap Xatu with Pursuit and prevent it from interfering with Garbodor's entry hazards. Tanks and wallbreakers such as Hariyama and Magmortar appreciate Liepard paralyzing or using Sucker Punch on faster offensive Pokemon such as Archeops that could otherwise revenge kill them, as well as using Knock Off to weaken defensive targets that require items for recovery, such as Weezing.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Liepard's main STAB move, which does a huge amount of damage to any target that doesn't resist Dark while removing its item. Pursuit allows Liepard to trap Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Mesprit, Haunter, Mismagius, Jynx, and Xatu. U-turn helps Liepard maintain momentum early-game against teams with hard counters to it such as Mega Audino, bulky Charizard, and Skuntank. Seed Bomb rounds out Liepard's coverage, giving it a way to deal significant damage to Rock-, Ground-, and Water-types such as Rhydon, Gastrodon, and Poliwrath. Alternatively, Play Rough gives Liepard powerful coverage versus Fighting-types such as Primeape, Hitmonchan, Hariyama, and Gurdurr, most notably achieving the OHKO on the former two. Finally, Gunk Shot nabs the 2HKO on Mega Audino after Stealth Rock as well as obliterates Clefairy and Grass-types such as Ludicolo, Lilligant, and Abomasnow.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature ensure Liepard can outrun base 105s and below such as Scyther, Mismagius, Manectric, and Charizard as well as Speed tie with Timid Pyroar. 252 Attack EVs coupled with Choice Band gives Liepard as much power as possible, allowing it to fire off very powerful Knock Offs. Limber protects Liepard from being crippled by Thunder Wave users such as Miltank, Xatu, Regirock, Clefairy, and Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Knock Off can be spammed in the early-game to cripple certain bulky foes by removing their item, such as Steelix and Regirock's Leftovers as well as Gurdurr and Ferroseed's Eviolite, making them easier to wear down. Switch Liepard into predicted Psychic-type attacks from the likes of Xatu, Mesprit, and Claydol and attempt to Pursuit trap them as they switch out. However, be cautious of recklessly bringing Liepard into attacks, as it is very frail and will get KOed by coverage moves such as Choice Specs Mesprit's Ice Beam and Musharna's Signal Beam should the opponent predict a switch. Liepard should also make sure that any Colbur Berries have been used up before it attempts to trap Psychic-types, as they can OHKO Liepard with Signal Beam if they survive the hit. Pivot out with U-turn if the opponent has hard counters to Liepard, such as Mega Audino and bulky Charizard. It is sometimes better to pivot out of Fighting-types rather than use Knock Off as to prevent them from getting off a free attack or Rapid Spin, in Hitmonchan's case. Use the appropriate coverage move to punish switches, though be wary of locking Liepard into Gunk Shot, as Poison-type coverage is easy for dangerous setup sweepers like Rhydon and Klinklang to take advantage of.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types including Gurdurr, Primeape, and Hitmonchan love the Pursuit trapping support Liepard provides for eliminating pesky Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Rotom, Xatu, Mesprit, and Mismagius. In return, they can smash Rock- and Steel-types such as Regirock and Steelix, which Liepard has a hard time breaking past. Poison-types, for instance Weezing, Haunter, and Vileplume, are great partners, as they can pivot into Fighting-, Bug-, and Fairy-type moves, while in return, Liepard can trap Psychic-types such as Choice Specs Mesprit and Claydol. Garbodor is a particularly solid teammate, as it can provide Spikes support to help Liepard whittle down foes throughout the match, while Liepard can trap Xatu with Pursuit and prevent it from bouncing back Garbodor's entry hazards. Spikes and Toxic Spikes in general work very well with Liepard's trapping and pivoting capabilities, as its respectable coverage tends to force many switches. Furthermore, Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Rotom, Manectric, Scyther, and Primeape make for excellent partners alongside Liepard, as they help each other grab momentum and form a potent VoltTurn core. Lanturn and Mesprit are also beneficial VoltTurn partners, as their low speed enables them to bring Liepard in unscathed. Pokemon commonly found on stall teams, such as Bronzor, Mega Audino, and Sliggoo, appreciate Liepard's ability to selectively trap stallbreakers such as Calm Mind Xatu, Jynx, Mismagius, and Zangoose with some prior damage. Choice Band Liepard can lure specific Pokemon and eliminate them with its coverage to clear the way for other wallbreakers and sweepers. For example, Seed Bomb enables it to lure and KO Quagsire, which clears the way for Malamar. Aurorus and Magmortar appreciate Hariyama getting lured and KOed by Play Rough so they can spam their STAB attacks. Finally, Rotom and Pyroar love Mega Audino and Clefairy being smashed by Gunk Shot.</p>"
      },
      "Weather Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rain Dance and Sunny Day can be used alongside Prankster to set up weather for eight turns in almost any situation, even against priority attackers such as Aqua Jet Samurott, making Liepard the most reliable one-off weather setter in the tier. Encore provides Liepard with opportunities to force switches and lock down foes, allowing it to set up weather against passive Pokemon reliably and disrupt certain offensive Pokemon such as Fake Out Kangaskhan to provide more setup opportunities. Knock Off is a reliable STAB attack that can be used to revenge kill certain Pokemon or weaken defensive Pokemon for weather-abusing teammates to break through later. U-turn allows Liepard to scout the opponent's decisions and send in an appropriate threat immediately after setting weather, conserving momentum and making the most out of the weather turns. Thunder Wave is a possibility to provide further support to teammates, but most weather sweepers outspeed the unboosted metagame when weather is up anyway, so it's not optimal to spend turns paralyzing Pokemon in this context.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Damp Rock and Heat Rock provide an extra three turns of weather for the team when Rain Dance or Sunny Day is used, which is useful given how Liepard is almost certain to pull off the respective weather moves due to Prankster. Maximum Speed and Attack investment is used to give Liepard as much offensive presence as possible, helping it weaken defensive threats for teammates more effectively. An Adamant nature can be used to power up Knock Off, but outspeeding Jynx and Mismagius is generally more useful. A set with 136 HP / 60 Def / 60 SpD / 252 Spe EVs can be used to give Liepard more bulk, allowing it to survive certain hits such as bulky Swords Dance Scyther's and Mesprit's U-turns and set up weather more often in a match if required. Alternatively, Liepard's defensive IVs can be reduced to 0 to make it easier to KO, making it more efficient at sacrificing itself and giving teammates more weather turns if necessary.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Liepard should usually enter battle when weather is about to run out or a teammate is KOed outside of weather so it can guarantee more weather turns with Prankster. It shouldn't generally be used as a lead, as other weather leads have access to entry hazards, and these should be set up before any weather sweeps should be attempted under most circumstances. Liepard also shouldn't switch into foes directly due to its lack of bulk, and bringing it in during weather turns should be avoided unless a setup sweeper desperately needs to be stopped with Encore. Once the appropriate weather has been set, Liepard should exit battle quickly to ensure that its teammates can take advantage of the weather for as long as possible. Liepard should be preserved for later if weather-setting foes like Abomasnow and Aurorus are present, as it can achieve little while they are free to switch in, and it risks either being KOed or letting a teammate take heavy damage as it switches out. In the late-game, Liepard can also be sacrificed to set up weather for one final sweep, with its low bulk making it very easy to KO, allowing an abuser to come in for free after it is defeated.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Weather sweepers are mandatory partners to capitalize on Liepard's support. Swift Swim users such as Kabutops and Ludicolo are the main threats to take advantage of Rain Dance with, while Chlorophyll users such as Victreebel and Exeggutor are the best options to use if Sunny Day is run. Additionally, wallbreakers and generally fast offensive Pokemon such as Samurott, Magmortar, and Pyroar can make good use of the boosts to their STAB attacks in their respective weather conditions. A bulky weather setter should be used alongside Liepard so that weather can be established in a wider range of situations and with less risk against powerful offensive Pokemon. Mesprit can make good use of Rain Dance, Sunny Day, and Stealth Rock to support its team and can use a slow U-turn to get weather sweepers into battle safely and efficiently. Checks to Snow Warning Pokemon, namely Abomasnow and Aurorus, are also important, as they automatically remove Liepard's weather by switching in and must be dealt with before a sweep can be completed. Assault Vest Magmortar can switch into Ice-type moves reliably but must be wary of coverage moves.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot allows Liepard to increase its Special Attack and pose a threat to unprepared teams, letting it OHKO many of the offensive Pokemon it outspeeds after a boost. Dark Pulse is a powerful STAB attack that often makes the target flinch, which is useful given Liepard's speed and frailty and lets it occasionally break through bulky Pokemon that could KO it if they got a chance to hit back. Copycat can be used immediately after Dark Pulse KOes a foe to become Dark Pulse, gaining priority due to Prankster and allowing Liepard to bypass slower priority attackers and faster threats once its sweep has begun. It can also be used to copy utility moves such as Spikes and Will-O-Wisp to make Liepard a more unpredictable support threat or to copy coverage moves to revenge kill foes, such as Shadow Ball against Colbur Berry Rotom and Hurricane against Vivillon. Encore provides Liepard with lots of setup opportunities, both from the switches it forces and from its ability to lock down foes. Setting up on other setup sweepers is Liepard's speciality. Substitute gives Liepard more insurance against attacks, letting it 2HKO bulkier targets such as Assault Vest Magmortar if required. Liepard can still bluff Encore effectively if required, but the opponent can punish it if they manage to figure out that it lacks the move. Liepard's lack of U-turn, Thunder Wave, or Knock Off is usually enough to tip the opponent off if it stays in for more than a few turns.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>While Liepard has priority once it starts to use Copycat Dark Pulse, maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is still preferred, as it lets Liepard reliably KO threats such as Mismagius with Dark Pulse without any additional setup and gives it more opportunities to use Copycat on its own attack against offense teams in general. It also ensures that Liepard outspeeds all other priority attackers, preventing them from revenge killing it or intercepting Copycat. However, a Modest nature can be used instead for more power if the loss of Speed is unimportant to your team. Black Glasses gives a boost in power to Liepard's Dark Pulse, which is useful given how frail Liepard is. Leftovers is another option if using Substitute that allows Liepard to stay healthy throughout a sweep and ensures that it can use Substitute without much risk. This allows Liepard to attempt sweeps at multiple points in the match more effectively and mitigates residual damage from entry hazards. It also allows Liepard to set up on Will-O-Wisp users that might otherwise try to burn Liepard, assuming a physical set, and mitigates Toxic damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Nasty Plot Liepard should be saved for the late-game if possible, as it is easily walled by Pokemon that resist Dark and once the opponent knows it is a Nasty Plot sweeper, they do not have to worry about other utility options Liepard could bluff, such as Thunder Wave and Pursuit. Liepard's teammates should be used to wear these foes down if they lack recovery, such as Assault Vest Hariyama, until Liepard is able to break through them, or KO them outright if this is not an option, such as against Mega Audino. Once these threats have been removed, Liepard should switch in on an opportunity to Encore, such as a foe setting up, using Defog, or using a Psychic-type attack, and either lock the foe into one of these moves or use Nasty Plot if it is likely to switch out. If Substitute is being used instead of Encore, it can be used before Nasty Plot so that Liepard can more effectively scout the opponent's responses. However, it shouldn't be used if the opponent has means to bypass the Substitute, such as Swellow's Boomburst or Pyroar's Hyper Voice.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates to remove bulky Fighting- and Fairy-type Pokemon are mandatory for this set to not be dead weight. Calm Mind Psychic-types such as Mesprit and Musharna have a good matchup against most Fighting-types and can beat Mega Audino one-on-one with Psyshock. Similarly, teammates that can remove other Dark-type Pokemon, such as Primeape and Scyther, are also appreciated to help propagate Liepard's sweep. Wallbreakers and stallbreakers that can wear down teams in general, such as Magmortar and Mismagius, are also highly useful for making Liepard's sweep easier to accomplish. Entry hazard support is also highly recommended to make up for Liepard's lack of raw power. Mesprit can use Stealth Rock consistently while dealing with Fighting-types and being able to give Liepard a second chance at sweeping with Healing Wish if necessary. Garbodor can switch into both Fighting- and Fairy-type Pokemon and threaten most of them with a STAB Gunk Shot. It can also provide Spikes support to help Liepard secure KOs more easily. Shiftry can lure in defensive responses such as Assault Vest Hariyama and cripple or remove them with Explosion or Extrasensory.</p>"

  "Simisage": {
    "overview": "<p>Simisage faces a lot of competition as an offensive Grass-type in NU from Shiftry and Lilligant. However, its good Speed tier, good mixed offensive stats, and excellent mixed coverage give it a niche for outspeeding and KOing threats like Rotom, Jynx, and Primeape. Simisage also has excellent coverage moves in Knock Off, Superpower, Rock Slide, and Gunk Shot, letting it hit most of the metagame for neutral damage and making it dangerous against offensive teams when facing a slower Pokemon. Sadly, though, Simisage's meager bulk, combined with its weakness to common types in Bug, Fire, Ice, Flying, and Poison, requires it to almost always come in as a revenge killer or via a slow pivot to avoid taking damage; it also makes it difficult for Simisage to make use of its resistances to common moves like Earthquake and Hydro Pump. Even though Simisage's two most used moves, Superpower and Leaf Storm, are incredibly strong, Simisage can be forced out after using them, and it lacks power against neutral foes without them. Besides that, while Simisage's Speed tier is decent, it leaves it slower than threatening foes like Scyther and Pyroar. In general, Simisage is a pretty unreliable Pokemon because almost all of its useful moves incur stat drops, have imperfect accuracy, or both.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A special set with Focus Blast and an appropriate Hidden Power can be used to lure in physically defensive foes and KO them with ease while also providing stronger Leaf Storms with either Choice Specs or Life Orb. Nasty Plot can be used to threaten a sweep but is difficult to make work due to Simisage's decent-at-best Speed tier and mediocre bulk. Taunt lets Simisage prevent entry hazard setters, status users, and setup sweepers from performing their roles but is difficult to use due to Simisage's low bulk and is hard to fit into a moveslot over a highly needed coverage move. Substitute is good for avoiding Sucker Punch and other forms of priority and can be used alongside Life Orb to trigger Overgrow for boosted Giga Drains to deal heavy hits and regain health with. Gluttony + Salac Berry can be used but is unnecessary and difficult to use unless you're trying to go for a late-game sweep with Simisage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types like Garbodor, Vileplume, Weezing, and Skuntank can survive any of Simisage's attacks with ease and OHKO it in return with their Poison-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users, Faster Pokemon, and Revenge Killers</strong>: Sucker Punch Shiftry, Skuntank, and Kangaskhan, Bullet Punch Hariyama, Ice Shard Piloswine and Abomasnow, Quick Attack Zangoose, and Mach Punch Gurdurr and Hitmonchan can all either survive a hit from Simisage and 2HKO it with their respective priority moves or come in on it while it's weakened and revenge kill it. Faster Pokemon like Scyther, Swellow, Archeops, Tauros, and Pyroar can switch in on Simisear's main STAB move, Leaf Storm, and force it out, even after Stealth Rock damage. However, even though they all survive a Leaf Storm from Simisear, the amount of damage that they take really hinders their play later in the match, so they're better off just coming in after a teammate has been KOed and forcing Simisage out.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Pokemon like Mega Audino and Musharna are barely even fazed by any of the moves Simisage has to throw at them and can proceed to set up on, PP stall, or outright KO Simisage with ease; they also disregard Leaf Storms from Simisage with recovery moves like Wish and Moonlight, thus rendering Simisage useless.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is Simisage's strongest STAB move and hits prevalent Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types like Rhydon, Barbaracle, and Samurott super effectively. To add on to this, Leaf Storm also takes a chuck of health out of any Pokemon that it hits; for example, it takes about 40% of Skuntank's health away. Superpower provides extremely needed coverage for Steel-types like Klinklang and Ferroseed, as well as other threatening Pokemon like Shiftry, Abomasnow, and Pyroar on the switch; it also deals a substantial amount of damage to Miltank, which is immune to Leaf Storm due to its access to Sap Sipper. Rock Slide lets Simisage hit a plethora of Pokemon that threaten it, like Charizard and Vivillon; it can also be used for deterring Assault Vest Magmortar, defensive Xatu, and Scyther from switching in. Gunk Shot allows Simisage to OHKO other Grass-types like Lilligant and Ludicolo, and it can be used against Shiftry if you don't want Simisage to lower its Defense and Attack with Superpower. Gunk Shot also obliterates Clefairy, and it has a chance to 2HKO Mega Audino after it takes Stealth Rock damage if Simisage attacks it on the switch. Giga Drain can be used if you want Simisage to have a form of recovery and a consistent STAB move that doesn't lower its Special Attack two stages every use; however, it is discouraged, considering Simisage loses crucial coverage and power from Gunk Shot, and every Pokemon that Giga Drain hits, Leaf Storm hits for greater damage. Knock Off could also be used over Gunk Shot to give Simisage a way to deal with Eviolite users like Bronzor and Ferroseed; however, Simisage again loses out on crucial coverage and power.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment, alongside 152 Attack EVs and 104 Special Attack EVs, Life Orb, and a Naive nature, allow Simisage to be as fast as possible, outspeeding base 100s, while still having enough EVs to OHKO prominent threats like Kangaskhan with Superpower, Jynx and bulky Charizard with Rock Slide, and Lilligant and Ludicolo with Gunk Shot. Overgrow lets Simisage hit any Pokemon with a freakishly strong Leaf Storm and Giga Drain when it's low on health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avoid switching Simisage in directly, as its lackluster bulk causes it to get OHKOed by a lot of neutral hits very often. Avoid Jynx and Vivillon on the chance that they're running Focus Sash, as they can survive one of any move from Simisage and OHKO it in return with Ice Beam or Hurricane. Try to use Leaf Storm, or Giga Drain if you're predicting the opponent to switch in a faster Rock- or Water-type like Choice Scarf Kabutops and Floatzel to deal as much damage to them as possible before being forced out by their huge offensive pressure. Try not to spam Superpower unless necessary, as the stat drops normally force Simisage out unless it can deal a lot of damage with Leaf Storm. Use Leaf Storm to take out huge chunks of health on multiple Pokemon, as Simisage is commonly used as a hit-and-run attacker. Try to spam Rock Slide as much as possible, as it deals decent amounts of damage to all of its targets and can be used for securing a KO on a weakened Pokemon without having to worry about too low of accuracy or dropping Simisage's stats. Use Gunk Shot to predict opposing Fairy- and Grass-types like Clefairy and Lilligant coming in or just to heavily damage, as well as even OHKO them, the first turn in. Switch in on weak or resisted attacks to potentially trigger Overgrow to hit the target or switch-in with a strengthened Leaf Storm or Giga Drain; you can also use this to get a strong Giga Drain and then regain the lost health to repeat the process.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock setters like Mesprit and Omastar are good teammates because the entry hazard support that they provide can turn 2HKOs from Simisage into OHKOs against bulky Pokemon like Regirock and Pelipper, in addition to breaking Focus Sashes from Vivillon and Jynx, allowing Simisage to KO them without worrying about them surviving with one HP and OHKOing it in return. Mesprit also has a slow U-turn, which means that it can safely bring Simisage in most of the time. On the other hand, Omastar can set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes, as well as tank Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-type moves aimed at Simisage and KO the users in return. Water-types like Samurott and Lanturn take care of the Fire-types that threaten Simisage; Lanturn also threatens a lot of the Flying-types that outspeed and can easily OHKO Simisage. Simisage in return takes care of the Grass-types that threaten Samurott and Lanturn, like Ludicolo and Lilligant, with Gunk Shot. Poison-resistant Pokemon like Rhydon, Piloswine, and Steelix are good teammates for Simisage because they can take Poison-type moves from opposing Garbodor and Skuntank with ease and KO them in return; however, be aware that Rhydon and Steelix only take care of physical Skuntank, so Piloswine is a better option if you're worried about facing special Skuntank. Wallbreakers like Tauros are good teammates too because they can weaken a lot of the foes that threaten Simisage and get rid of its checks and counters before it comes in. Hariyama is a good choice of a teammate as well, as its amazing HP stat and access to Thick Fat let it tank Ice- and Fire-type moves for Simisage.</p>"

  "Musharna": {
    "overview": "<p>Musharna stands out as one of the most physically bulky Pokemon in the tier, which in combination with reliable recovery in Moonlight makes it an excellent catch-all check to most physical attackers that can't hit it super effectively, such as Tauros and Archeops. While Mesprit is often a better choice for many roles due to its larger movepool and higher Speed, Musharna is usually a better choice for a bulky Calm Mind sweeper because Mesprit lacks reliable recovery. Musharna can run many different variants of its signature Calm Mind set, each of which is stopped in different ways, making it incredibly deadly if the opponent has mispredicted Musharna's set and preserved the wrong checks, and it can wipe out teams from the very start of the game if the opponent lacks appropriate countermeasures. However, its extremely low Speed ensures that Musharna quickly becomes dead weight if it's significantly weakened, meaning it must heal often to sweep or pivot consistently, and Moonlight's low PP prevents it from stalling out foes indefinitely. Furthermore, if Musharna chooses to run support moves instead of coverage, it can be quite easily walled regardless of its boosts if the opponent packs a Dark-type, and unless it runs Heal Bell, Toxic poison shuts it down completely.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set can be used without Calm Mind, making room for an extra support move such as Heal Bell or Thunder Wave instead, sacrificing sweeping potential and offensive utility for more consistent team support. Alternatively, Musharna can use its low Speed to its fullest potential by running an offensive Trick Room set with maximum Special Attack EVs, a Quiet nature, and Life Orb, using coverage options such as Signal Beam, Shadow Ball, Hidden Power Ground, and Energy Ball KO specific targets that it lures in such as Malamar, Mismagius, Steelix, and Gastrodon. Choice Specs can be used alongside the aforementioned coverage moves to surprise counters, but such a set is generally less consistent at wallbreaking than the likes of Mesprit. Magic Coat can be used on the standard Calm Mind set to block status users and entry hazards with prediction, but generally doesn't help Musharna sweep more consistently, with Steelix, the most common response to Musharna, being immune to Toxic itself. Kee Berry can also be used to further increase Musharna's physical bulk as it stacks Calm Mind boosts, but the passive recovery from Leftovers is sorely missed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon</strong>: Dark-type Pokemon such as Skuntank, Shiftry, and Liepard are immune to Musharna's STAB moves and can hit it for super effective damage. Skuntank and Pawniard only take neutral damage from Signal Beam, and Skuntank can shut Musharna down with Taunt, making it a reliable counter to most Musharna sets.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn and poison decrease Musharna's longevity considerably and make it difficult for it to pivot into powerful attackers later in the game. Toxic poison can be one of the best checks to Stored Power Musharna due to the increasing damage per turn preventing it from stacking boosts reliably, with Steelix being a particularly dangerous user of the move due to its resistance to Psychic-type attacks and immunity from being poisoned by Synchronize.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Pokemon such as Mismagius, Pyroar, and Skuntank that commonly run Taunt are able to shut down both Musharna's primary means of stat boosting and its primary means of recovery, making it fairly useless until it can switch out.</p> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Rotom, Mesprit, and Jynx can use Trick to give their items to Musharna and lock it into a single move, removing Musharna's passive recovery if it runs Leftovers and removing all of Musharna's sweeping capability unless it has already boosted.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Pyroar, Life Orb Samurott, and Work Up Tauros can be difficult for Musharna to deal with given any prior damage, especially considering Musharna will often have to use Moonlight multiple times to avoid a 2HKO from one of their attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bug-type Pokemon</strong>: Bug-types such as Pinsir and Scyther can boost their stats and hit Musharna for super effective damage; both Pinsir and Scyther often carry Choice Band and can deal huge chunks of damage to Musharna without a boost as well.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind lets Musharna beat strong special attackers such as Charizard, Pyroar, and Magmortar after some boosts and gives Musharna some offensive presence after even just one boost thanks to its solid Special Attack. Calm Mind can also be used against physical attackers that can't threaten Musharna back, such as Hitmonchan and Garbodor. Psyshock hits specially bulky Pokemon such as Magmortar and Hariyama as well as giving Musharna the significant upper hand versus other Calm Mind users such as Mega Audino and Xatu. Alternatively, Psychic can be used to hit physically bulky Pokemon such as Weezing and Vileplume harder unboosted. Moonlight is Musharna's best means of recovery, letting it set up with impunity against weaker attackers. Signal Beam lets Musharna hit most Dark-types such as Shiftry and Malamar for good damage as they switch in or if Musharna has accrued enough boosts to stop specially offensive threats such as Defog Skuntank; the move is especially useful with Colbur Berry so that Musharna can take an attack and strike back. Thunder Wave slows down the fast threats that Musharna is often faced with, can provide extra setup opportunities, and can provide extra turns of recovery when the foe is fully paralyzed. Heal Bell can be used to counteract Musharna's weakness to Toxic poison and to support its teammates, but its low PP makes it easy for checks such as Steelix to stall the move out, and it's generally best left to supportive sets.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>240 HP EVs provide Musharna with a Leftovers number, while the remaining EVs and a Bold nature are used to maximize Musharna's physical bulk, letting it counter physical attackers such as Hitmonchan and Garbodor and giving it more opportunities to set up Calm Mind boosts, which eventually supplements Musharna's lower Special Defense. 16 Speed EVs can be used to let Musharna outspeed Steelix. Synchronize is the best ability for this set because it punishes opponents that attempt to inflict status on Musharna to stop a sweep, such as Mantine and Pelipper. Leftovers gives Musharna some passive recovery that turns some 2HKOs into 3HKOs, such as Swellow's Boomburst and Floatzel's Hydro Pump, and reduces Musharna's reliance on Moonlight to tank hits, making its meager 8 PP stretch further. Colbur Berry is another great option that lets Musharna deal with Knock Off from Hariyama more easily as well as lure in usual checks such as Shiftry and Malamar and beat them with Signal Beam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early-game, Musharna should generally pivot into foes which cannot break it, such as Hitmonchan and Archeops, and proceed to fire off attacks. Alternatively, Musharna can be either used to lure in Dark-types such as Shiftry and Malamar and beat them with Signal Beam or conserved until late-game when its checks have been removed, taking setup opportunities when given but only if you feel it can sweep without any obstacles. A full-HP Skuntank, a Steelix known to have Toxic, and a number of other things can easily cut a sweep short. Musharna's HP should be conserved whenever possible so that it can switch into and avoid the 2HKO from strong physical attackers such as Archeops and Tauros before healing up with Moonlight. Musharna can easily get worn down throughout the course of a match, so keeping this in mind can be vital to your success. If Musharna runs Heal Bell or Thunder Wave, it has a stronger early-game presence that can be used to support its teammates at the cost of late-game utility.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types such as Hariyama, Primeape, and Hitmonchan are great for switching into and threatening the Dark-types that prevent Musharna from sweeping. This is important even if Musharna uses Signal Beam, as threats such as Skuntank can still get around it, and it relieves pressure on Musharna so that it can sweep more effectively. Similarly, Mega Audino is a good partner that can threaten most Dark-types and either provide Heal Bell support or act as a supplementary sweeper while also being able to pass Wishes and provide Musharna with more setup opportunities, in addition to being immune to Trick. Meanwhile, defensive threats that are weak to Fighting-type attacks, such as Ferroseed and Regice, highly appreciate Musharna's being a sturdy response to these attacks. Grounded Poison-types such as Garbodor and Skuntank are able to absorb Toxic Spikes, which also plagues Musharna, and are mandatory against teams that pack that entry hazard to ensure a late-game sweep. Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank and Liepard can deal with opposing Psychic- and Ghost-types that can either wall Musharna that lack Psyshock with their own Calm Mind boosts or hit it hard with status and super effective Hexes, such as Xatu and Mismagius.</p>"
      },
      "Stored Power": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind both boosts Musharna's Special Attack and Special Defense and raises the Base Power of Stored Power, rapidly increasing Musharna's offensive capability. Barrier makes Musharna almost impenetrable to physical attacks and also increases the Base Power of Stored Power, meaning that Musharna can inflict reasonable damage even without using Calm Mind if it is too pressured to do so. Moonlight gives Musharna a recovery option to help it succeed against Pokemon that can still deal significant damage to it after a few boosts, such as Choice Band Scyther, and it generally gives Musharna an easier time initially setting up boosts. Stored Power can hit anywhere between 20 and 360 Base Power depending on the number of boosts Musharna has. This can get scary pretty quickly if your opponent is not well equipped to deal with it, OHKOing almost any non-Dark-type after Musharna has maximized its Special Attack stat.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>240 HP EVs give Musharna a Leftovers number, while the remaining EVs and a Bold nature are used to make it as physically bulky as possible, letting it beat physical attackers such as Hitmonchan and Garbodor and set up Calm Mind boosts more easily, which eventually fix Musharna's lower Special Defense. While this is generally the most effective approach, as Calm Mind increases Musharna's Special Attack at the same time as it patches up its special bulk, a specially defensive spread can be used instead to let Musharna switch into special attackers such as Floatzel and Swellow more easily, with Barrier fixing Musharna's Defense as physical attackers switch in. 16 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Steelix and grab an extra Calm Mind before it uses Toxic, potentially allowing Musharna to beat Steelix 1v1 with Stored Power. This can be useful if you have a Healing Wish user that can give Musharna another chance at a full sweep later in the match. Synchronize is the best ability for this set because it punishes foes that attempt to inflict status on Musharna to stop a sweep, such as Mantine and Pelipper. Leftovers gives Musharna some passive recovery so that it can rely less on Moonlight to stay healthy, making its pitiful 8 PP stretch further.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be played as a dedicated wincon, not being brought in until it has a high probability to sweep the opponent's team. As this set lacks other useful support options, such as Heal Bell, or a coverage move such as Signal Beam, and it has no immediately powerful STAB attack to hit Fighting- and Poison-types with, it is generally much worse as a pivot, only being able to heal up with Moonlight or force something out with Barrier and then switch out, giving the opponent momentum. Removing Dark-types, Toxic Spikes, and any potential Toxic users on the opposing team is key to ensuring a clean sweep with Stored Power. However, it is possible to beat Dark-type Pokemon that Musharna cannot damage through means of passive damage such as Life Orb recoil, poison, and burn. Given the ease with which Musharna can boost its defensive stats, setting up on a Dark-type that is equipped with a Life Orb and either weakened or afflicted with damaging status can be plausible. Barrier should be used against physical attackers or when the opponent is likely to switch in a physical threat such as Choice Band Scyther to stop Musharna, while Calm Mind should be used when the opponent is likely to bring in a special attacker, such as Aurorus or a rival Calm Mind user, or just when Musharna has free turns in general. Moonlight should be used when Musharna is in range of being KOed by a surprise critical hit and a subsequent follow-up attack, to minimize the risk of critical hits disrupting Musharna's sweep. However, if Moonlight's PP is running low, it can be worth the risk to wait for longer before healing if Musharna's health would not fall below 50% after an attack. Generally speaking, Stored Power should only be used when it's strong enough to OHKO a foe to avoid giving it more turns to potentially land a critical hit; this means that Musharna should usually secure one or two Calm Minds regardless of how many Barrier boosts it has before attempting a KO. Going all the way to +6 Defense, Special Attack, and Special Defense is generally unnecessary unless Musharna is your last Pokemon and the opponent has a dedicated Pokemon that resists Psychic-type attacks, such as Metang, due to Stored Power's ridiculous Base Power.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>For the most part, Dark-types absolutely have to be removed before Musharna can sweep. Fighting- and Bug-types such as Primeape, Hariyama, Scyther, and Pinsir can inflict heavy damage to most Dark-types, especially if they run Earthquake to deal with Skuntank reliably. Using a second Psychic-type with Signal Beam and Hidden Power Ground, such as Calm Mind Mesprit or Choice Specs Beheeyem, can be useful for luring in Dark-types such as Skuntank and securing the KO with their boosted coverage moves, with Explosion Shiftry also being a good lure for Skuntank in particular. This set is also extremely vulnerable to Toxic poison, so using grounded Poison-types such as Vileplume and Skuntank, potentially in combination with a reliable Defog user such as Pelipper, is important for removing the threat of Toxic Spikes. Heal Bell and Healing Wish users also greatly benefit Musharna by removing status after the fact and giving Musharna more chances to sweep, with Mega Audino being a good choice for either role due to its ability to take on Dark-types with its Fairy typing.</p>"

  "Audino": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Audino is one of the bulkiest Pokemon in the tier, which, in combination with its unique defensive typing, makes it almost impossible to take down quickly. It is also the only viable Wish user available because of these traits, completely outclassing other potential users. Regenerator in particular allows it to pivot very effectively in the early-game to support teammates, especially in combination with other support moves such as Heal Bell and Encore, without being worn down unless Mega Evolving is necessary. Mega Audino's bulk and vast movepool allow it to fill a number of roles effectively, making it not only an excellent cleric but also a defensive wincon with Calm Mind or even an offensive lure and pivot using its wide special coverage. Its Fairy typing and lack of removable item also make it the most reliable switch-in to Knock Off and Trick throughout the match, a highly useful attribute for defensive teams. This also allows it to deal with most Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-types well, such as Shiftry, Sliggoo, and Hariyama, provided it doesn't attempt to switch into the latter's STAB attacks before Mega Evolving.</p> <p>While Mega Audino has a large number of unique and highly useful attributes, its lack of immediate offensive power and speed can make it easy to exploit depending on its moveset. Setup sweepers can capitalize on sets without Encore or Toxic, Steel- and Poison-types can wall sets that lack coverage, and Toxic completely shuts down most sets without Heal Bell or Rest. Overall, once Mega Audino has been sufficiently scouted, it becomes a lot easier to deal with if appropriate checks are preserved throughout the game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave, Healing Wish, Trick Room, Knock Off, Toxic, and Yawn can all be used on the defensive pivot set in the third slot, but they have less general utility than the options selected. Draining Kiss can be used over Dazzling Gleam, allowing Mega Audino to spend fewer turns using Wish or Rest to heal itself, but the lack of power is very noticeable even at +6, and even more so if Calm Mind is not being used alongside it. It can actually be PP stalled quite easily on boosting sets because of its low power. Hyper Voice is an alternative STAB attack that boasts greater power than Dazzling Gleam, has the ability to bypass Substitutes, and allows the defensive Calm Mind set to eventually break through Fire-types such as Magmortar and Poison-types such as Garbodor and Weezing. However, it lacks the super effective coverage that Dazzling Gleam provides against Dark- and Fighting-types, and it is completely blocked by Ghost-types, making it a poor choice for a mono-attacking set without dedicated Pursuit support. Audinite is absolutely mandatory as the item for all sets due to the extra bulk, attacking power, and Fairy typing that Mega Evolution provides, not to mention the utility that Audino gets from shifting playstyles so dynamically. Leftovers can be used on the pivot set to prevent Audino from being worn down so quickly by entry hazard damage as it pivots around, but it's never worth the drawbacks of having a worse STAB option, significantly worse general bulk, and weakness to Fighting-type attacks. In NU, there is no opportunity cost for using Mega Audino as your Mega Evolution of choice due to its complete lack of competition.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon</strong>: Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon, such as Steelix and Garbodor, can easily switch into Mega Audino's main attack, even after multiple boosts due to its lack of raw power, and threaten to 2HKO with their own STAB attacks. Skuntank is neutral to Dazzling Gleam but has good special bulk, can use Taunt to prevent Mega Audino from boosting or using support moves, and threatens to 3HKO with Poison Jab. However, these threats may take significant damage from a boosted Fire Blast or Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Mega Audino has no way to deter other setup sweepers outside of the rare Encore, and Pokemon with access to both Calm Mind and Psyshock, such as Mesprit and Xatu, can boost alongside Mega Audino and KO it by hitting its unboosted Defense stat. Musharna can also break through it easily with Calm Mind and Stored Power, while Swords Dance users such as Samurott and Charizard can similarly break through Mega Audino without too much trouble after a boost or two. However, Speed-boosting sweepers can be crippled with Thunder Wave if they are played recklessly.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore</strong>: Mega Audino relies on its non-attacking moves to be an effective pivot and wincon, for the most part, and Taunt users such as Pyroar, Mismagius, and Weezing can outspeed it and shut it down completely. Mega Audino can similarly be forced out by using Encore on a move like Protect or Heal Bell, with threats such as Liepard turning it into a setup opportunity for a teammate, provided they can avoid switching into an attack.</p> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes</strong>: Mega Audino requires multiple turns to act as a wincon in the late game, or to act as a defensive response to powerful attackers, and Toxic Spikes completely ruin any longevity it has. The best-case scenario is that Mega Audino is forced to waste a turn every time it switches in using Heal Bell or risk being worn down to the point of being KOed. Garbodor, Weezing, and Roselia can all set the entry hazard while forcing Mega Audino out, although they should be careful for boosted Fire Blasts. Rest sets cope much better with this hazard, however.</p> <p><strong>Quagsire</strong>: Unless Mega Audino chooses to run Grass Knot, Quagsire usually walls it due to the low power of its STAB attack and Unaware's ability to ignore Calm Mind boosts, although it is 3HKOed by a fully invested Dazzling Gleam. It can usually take a hit, use Toxic, and either stall Mega Audino out with Recover or attempt to boost itself with Curse, and it can also switch into Thunder Wave with ease.</p>",

      "Defensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind turns Mega Audino into a highly effective wincon by boosting its Special Attack and Special Defense. After a few boosts, it becomes practically unbreakable with special attacks and a big threat to teams once Pokemon that resist Fairy are removed. Dazzling Gleam is Mega Audino's best STAB attack and hits the majority of foes for neutral damage without having anything immune to it, unlike Hyper Voice. It also lets Mega Audino check Fighting- and Dark-types, such as Hariyama, Shiftry, and Malamar, without having to boost its stats, giving it decent early-game utility. The combination of Wish + Protect provides Mega Audino with reliable recovery while also letting it heal its teammates throughout the match, again making it useful before it attempts a sweep. However, Rest + Sleep Talk can be used instead to make Mega Audino less vulnerable to status and more of a dedicated wincon than a supportive pivot. Fire Blast is an option to prevent Mega Audino from being walled by common Steel- and Poison-types, but using it in one of the latter two slots drastically reduces the reliability of Mega Audino's recovery, and generally the move is used better on other sets.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>48 Special Attack EVs give Mega Audino an 87% chance to 3HKO specially defensive Malamar so it doesn't have to use Calm Mind to stop Malamar from using RestTalk. The remaining EVs and Bold nature are used to make Mega Audino as physically bulky as possible to prevent its sweep from being interrupted by powerful physical attackers such as Kangaskhan and Tauros. Regenerator should be the pre-Mega ability so that Audino can pivot in and out of the match more effectively before deciding to set up for a sweep, letting it provide more consistent Wish support.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early in the game, Audino can be used effectively as a physical pivot, switching into attackers such as Shiftry and Piloswine, making the most of its immunity to Knock Off's effect and damage boost, and using Wish to either heal its teammates or provide them with safe opportunities to switch in they would not normally have. Regenerator's passive healing lets Audino take weaker attacks and provide Wish support indefinitely, so it should not Mega Evolve early unless it has to. However, for example, if the opponent is threatening to clean up with Malamar, Audino should Mega Evolve so that it can deal with it. Mega Audino can still be used well as a physically defensive pivot after Mega Evolving, but it is more susceptible to being worn down by repeated attacks if it attempts to support its teammates with Wish rather than heal itself.</p> <p>Mega Audino should not attempt to sweep with Calm Mind until Poison- and Steel-types that threaten it, such as Steelix and Garbodor, have been removed, as it lacks the power to beat them without a coverage move even after several boosts. Mega Audino can set up on many Pokemon until it reaches +6 Special Attack and Special Defense, but it usually shouldn't attempt this, as the chances of being hit with a critical hit increase the longer it stays in, and due to Wish's delayed nature, it may be difficult to salvage the sweep after this. If RestTalk is the chosen healing method, Mega Audino can also set up against Pokemon that would normally use Toxic to beat it, such as Mantine and Lanturn. It can also be used as a status sponge for your team in the early-game, dealing with threats such as Rotom and Mismagius instead of providing Wish support.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Attackers with strong Ground- and Fire-type coverage, such as Rhydon and Magmortar, are highly useful for breaking through the Poison- and Steel-types that can prevent Mega Audino from sweeping. Specially defensive teammates that lack reliable recovery also appreciate Mega Audino's physical bulk and Wish support. Mantine is an especially good partner for this set, as it can also deal with most Steel- and Poison-types using either Scald or a powerful Hydro Pump, provided these foes don't hit it with Electric-type coverage on the switch. Camerupt similarly deals major damage to Steel- and Poison-types while also providing Stealth Rock and status support. If Wish and Protect are used, Heal Bell support is necessary. Otherwise, Mega Audino is completely shut down by Toxic, being forced to heal more often instead of boosting and never being able to become a substantial threat. Lanturn and Musharna are solid choices that can also deal with threatening foes such as Magmortar and Muk. Toxic Spikes completely cripple Calm Mind Mega Audino, so using a grounded Poison-type to absorb them is also mandatory. Skuntank can do this while dealing with Calm Mind Psychic-types that could boost alongside Mega Audino and beat it with Psyshock, such as Musharna and Xatu. Vileplume and Garbodor are other options to provide more backup against physical attackers, with the latter also providing Spikes support. Weezing can also be a good teammate due to its ability to take on many physical attackers that could otherwise force Mega Audino into healing instead of boosting, and it highly appreciates Wish and Heal Bell support from Audino, but it can't absorb Toxic Spikes.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind is used to increase Mega Audino's offensive power and prevent it from being revenge killed by special attackers, and it only needs to be used once for this set to become a significant offensive threat. Healing Wish is an alternative option that lets Mega Audino sacrifice itself to fully restore a teammate, and this set makes good use of the move due to its ability to force switches, with opponents often assuming a defensive set is being used and switching to a threat that can break through it. Dazzling Gleam is a decent, reliable STAB attack that can deal significant damage after a single boost and has good overall neutral coverage. Fire Blast deals heavy damage to usual responses to defensive sets, such as Steelix, Ferroseed, and Vileplume, OHKOing them after one or two Calm Mind boosts. Surf is an excellent additional attack that gives Mega Audino perfect neutral coverage and hits certain targets that could otherwise exploit it, such as Rhydon, Magmortar, Ninetales, and Charizard, making it quite difficult to wall outside of dedicated specially defensive Pokemon. Thunder Wave is a useful support option, paralyzing faster foes that might switch in to break through a defensive set, such as Swords Dance Samurott. This can make them fodder for a teammate such as Abomasnow or Aurorus. Psychic is another coverage option that more reliably deals with Poison-types, such as Garbodor and Weezing, being useful on sets that lack Calm Mind to boost Fire Blast to similar levels of power against them. Grass Knot is an excellent niche option for luring in and removing Quagsire, which can stop other setup sweepers on your team, such as Barbaracle and Samurott, with Unaware.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment is used to outspeed Rhydon, Weezing, and uninvested Malamar and Garbodor sets, letting Mega Audino hit them hard after a boost as they expect to outspeed it. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack alongside a Modest nature to give Mega Audino as much immediate power as possible. A bulkier spread of 168 HP / 252 SpA / 88 Spe can be used to outspeed uninvested Weezing and Sliggoo, but Audino's high base HP means that this doesn't increase its bulk too much. In addition, Weezing tends to run Speed EVs, which generally makes this a moot point. Regenerator should be used as the pre-Mega ability so that Audino can pivot into enemies and use its support moves more reliably before Mega Evolving.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Offensive Mega Audino should be used as a lure that draws in its usual checks, such as Steel- and Poison-types like Steelix and Weezing, and either hitting them with Fire Blast on the switch or using Calm Mind to set up and hit them harder on the following turn. These targets usually do not expect to be threatened by Mega Audino and thus can be outright KOed quite often as they try to hit it with their own STAB attacks. While Audino can attempt to pivot throughout the game, using Thunder Wave to paralyze threats early on, it's often more effective for it to Mega Evolve immediately so that it can draw in responses as soon as possible, opening up the way for a sweep for a teammate before the opponent realises Mega Audino's strategy. Healing Wish should be used in the late-game to give a sweeper such as Swords Dance Scyther another chance at securing a victory or to give a wallbreaker such as Abomasnow another chance to break through the opponent's defensive checks. Due to the Speed investment, Mega Audino can usually use this move against defensive Pokemon such as Lanturn and Mantine without risk of being KOed by a surprise attack. This set lacks significant defensive investment and thus should not be switched into strong attacks before Mega Evolving or be expected to avoid 2HKOs from attacks such as Samurott's Hydro Pump thereafter.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any Pokemon that appreciates the removal of Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon will highly appreciate this set as a partner. Pokemon that like Fire-types being removed, such as Will-O-Wisp users like Rotom and Mismagius, also appreciate this set if it runs Surf. Scyther, Tauros, and Pinsir particularly love Rhydon and Steelix being lured in and removed by the appropriate coverage moves, and being able to either set up and sweep or make the most of a strong STAB attack against a defenseless team. Likewise, Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Hitmonchan appreciate Poison-types being removed, while Psychic-types such as Musharna and Mesprit enjoy the removal of Steel-types. The latter can also form Calm Mind cores with Mega Audino that can wear down bulky defensive Pokemon throughout the match. Slow, powerful attackers such as Abomasnow and Aurorus can capitalize on Mega Audino's ability to reliably pull off Thunder Wave against powerful attackers like Shiftry and Lilligant and highly appreciate its ability to restore them fully with Healing Wish, as do other Pokemon with issues against residual damage, such as Rock Polish Torterra.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The combination of Wish + Protect allows Audino to keep itself healthy throughout the match and to provide recovery for its teammates, both before and after Mega Evolution. Heal Bell makes Audino less susceptible to Toxic and lets it act as a dedicated cleric for its teammates, allowing them to play more offensively against the opponent's status users that can't threaten it otherwise, such as Lanturn. Fire Blast can be used to prevent Mega Audino from being completely walled by Steelix as it completes its Wishing responsibilities, although it does significantly less damage without any offensive investment. Encore is also a good option for locking down setup sweepers that may try to capitalize on Audino's passive nature, such as bulky Swords Dance Charizard and Scyther, providing its teammates with opportunities to switch in or providing itself with more opportunities to support them with Wish. Finally, Dazzling Gleam is a consistent STAB attack that prevents this set from being completely blocked by Taunt and allows Mega Audino to deal with Dark- and Fighting-types more effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread gives Mega Audino a good amount of mixed bulk to tank attacks with, avoiding the 2HKO from both Samurott's Hydro Pump and Tauros' Rock Climb after Stealth Rock. 48 SpA EVs can be used to ensure Dazzling Gleam 3HKOes Malamar, but extracting these EVs from either defensive stat allows small chances for the previously mentioned 2HKOs to occur. A spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature can be used to better deal with Life Orb Magmortar and specially offensive weather sweepers such as Omastar and Exeggutor, in addition to boosting special attackers such as Nasty Plot Ninetales if Mega Audino uses Encore. Regenerator should always be used as the pre-Mega ability on this set, as Audino is likely to forgo Mega Evolution until absolutely necessary so that it can pivot in and out of weaker attackers more reliably.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The aim of this set is to switch into the opponent's attacks throughout the game, tank them, and follow up with a suitable support move depending on the needs of the team at the time. Wish can be used in the early-game to give Audino's teammates opportunities to switch in that they would normally lack, or it can be used in the late-game to simply restore their health after they have taken a powerful attack. Audino should switch in when it gets a chance against defensive Pokemon if it runs Heal Bell so that it can remove status from teammates and ensure that defensive cores on a team can avoid being worn down by burns/poison and so that offensive Pokemon can remain unhindered by burns or paralysis. Encore should be used to provide Audino's teammates with setup opportunities against foes locked into exploitable moves, such as Stealth Rock and Substitute, usually needing to use Encore on the same turn as the opponent uses these setup moves due to Audino's low Speed stat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that lack reliable recovery and are vulnerable to status highly appreciate Audino's ability to support them with Wish and Heal Bell. Generally, this set is most useful to fully defensive teams that require reliable healing and status removal for all teammates, so defensive Pokemon such as Weezing and Steelix are good teammates that also provide good defensive synergy. Assault Vest users such as Hariyama and Magmortar also appreciate this support, as do general tanks such as Piloswine that are susceptible to stallbreakers like Rotom and Mismagius. Setup sweepers appreciate Audino's ability to lock down defensive responses with Encore. In particular, Double Dance Rhydon can take on Steel- and Poison-types easily with its powerful STAB attacks and can capitalize on Encore with its variety of setup options. Musharna also appreciates Heal Bell support from Audino, as this allows it to use Synchronize to inflict status on opponents that try to use moves such as Toxic to prevent it from sweeping, before coming back healthy in the late-game to complete the sweep.</p>"

  "Gurdurr": {
    "overview": "<p>In a tier filled with powerful physical attackers, Gurdurr excels in its ability to tackle on top-tier threats by virtue of its solid typing and bulk. Access to STAB Drain Punch allows Gurdurr to heal itself, and Mach Punch gives it useful priority that makes it one of the best checks to common offensive Normal- and Dark-types such as Kangaskhan and Shiftry. Common Psychic-types are a major issue for Gurdurr, however, as they can take advantage of its low Special Defense. Moreover, Gurdurr's low Speed leaves it reliant on Mach Punch to deal with faster Pokemon, and Gurdurr can be worn down by repeated hits fairly quickly due to its lack of reliable recovery and low Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Punch can be used to hit Vileplume, but Flying-types that would be targeted by Ice Punch take massive damage from Stone Edge, and other Grass-types either are setup bait or can shrug off Ice Punches easily. Poison Jab hits Fairy-types, but Mawile is immune to it and the other Fairy-types don't take that much damage from it anyway. Iron Fist powers up Gurdurr's punching moves, but the benefits from Guts significantly outweigh it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Bulky Poison-types, such as Garbodor, Weezing, and Vileplume, resist Gurdurr's STAB moves and don't mind Knock Off too much. Garbodor can quickly wear down Gurdurr with Rocky Helmet damage, and Weezing and Vileplume can target Gurdurr's low Special Defense with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Mega Audino</strong>: Mega Audino can easily survive Gurdurr's boosted attacks and force it out with Dazzling Gleam, or even use it as setup fodder for Calm Minds. However, Audino must have Mega Evolved prior, otherwise it will take heavy damage from Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Fast Psychic-types, such as Mesprit and Xatu, will deal serious damage to Gurdurr before it can use Knock Off. Mesprit OHKOes Gurdurr, while Xatu 2HKOes it and will usually survive a Knock Off followed by a Mach Punch. However, neither can safely switch into Gurdurr due to the threat of Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Charizard, Scyther, Rotom-S, and Vivillon resist Gurdurr's STAB moves and can either use Gurdurr as setup fodder or hit it hard with a STAB move. However, they must all be wary of switching into a Stone Edge, and only Bulky Charizard is not bothered by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Gurdurr really needs a boost in order to be used to its fullest potential. Despite its bulk, enough repeated hits will wear it down and prevent it from reliably setting up. Its low Speed and reliance on Drain Punch are easy to take advantage of as well.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Due to Gurdurr's low Special Defense even with Eviolite, it won't stand up to powerful special attacks such as Magmortar's Fire Blast and Samurott's Hydro Pump.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Drain Punch is a decently powerful STAB move that also recovers half the damage dealt to the foe. Mach Punch allows Gurdurr to revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Jynx and Pyroar. Knock Off is an important utility move that removes the opposing Pokemon's item and hits Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Rotom, Mismagius, Mesprit, and Exeggutor. Bulk Up boosts Gurdurr's Attack and Defense, greatly increasing its power and longevity versus opposing physical attackers. Alternatively, Stone Edge can be used to hit Flying-types, particularly Scyther and Charizard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite increases Gurdurr's overall bulk to respectable levels. Guts allows Gurdurr to benefit from status conditions. The given EV spread avoids the 2HKO from both Adamant Silk Scarf Kangaskhan's Double-Edge and Life Orb Tauros's Rock Climb after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs are placed into attack to maximize Gurdurr's offensive presence.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early-game, Gurdurr should use Knock Off to get chip damage off or to cripple its checks, and there really aren't any drawbacks to using the move. Pivot into physical attackers such as Kangaskhan, Aggron, Steelix, and Kabutops in order to gain momentum and threaten them with a STAB move. Be sure to be wary when switching into Aggron though, as Choice Band Heavy Slam is capable of 2HKOing. If using Stone Edge, don't reveal it too early, as it holds some surprise factor, so it is best used to hit Flying-types as they switch in or if you predict them to stay in on Gurdurr thinking that they have a free opportunity to set up. While Gurdurr is very effective at checking Dark-types, it is severely crippled by losing its Eviolite and they commonly run Knock Off, so be wary of repeatedly switching Gurdurr in on them. Gurdurr can be used as a status absorber thanks to Guts, but it should stay away from Toxic users because the rapidly increasing residual damage is more detrimental to Gurdurr than the boost from Guts. Use Bulk Up when Gurdurr threatens the opposing Pokemon with a STAB move or against more passive defensive Pokemon, especially those lacking Toxic, such as Torterra and Regirock.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>In order to combat the bulky Psychic-types that trouble Gurdurr, Dark- and Ghost-types such as Liepard, Haunter, and Mismagius make for good teammates. Conversely, Psychic-types themselves are excellent teammates, as they appreciate having a bulky check to Dark-types, and good examples include Xatu, Mesprit, and Musharna. Grass-types, such as Lilligant, Torterra, and Ludicolo, appreciate Gurdurr eliminating troublesome Flying-types with Stone Edge. Poison- and Steel-types such as Garbodor, Weezing, Klinklang, and Mawile are helpful to threaten Fairy-types such as Mega Audino and Clefairy. Vivillon is a good teammate for Gurdurr as it appreciates Gurdurr's ability to break through bulky Rock- and Steel-types, and Gurdurr appreciates Vivillon breaking though bulky Grass-types such as Vileplume and Gourgeist-XL. In addition, Vivillon can incapacitate bulky Poison-types that Gurdurr struggles with such as Garbodor and Weezing.</p>"

  "Throh": {
    "overview": "<p>Throh is a very unique Pokemon with fairly impressive bulk that allows it to pivot into weaker special attackers during a match. While Throh faces heavy competition from other popular Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Gurdurr, which sport higher Attack and Defense, respectively, Throh manages to create a niche for itself as an extremely bulky phazer with STAB Circle Throw. Throh also has a useful ability in Guts, which allows it to boost its Attack stat to decent levels when inflicted with status, making it a good status or Scald absorber for teams. Unfortunately, it is hard for Throh to utilize its potential without Spikes support, and Ghost-types like Rotom, Mismagius, and Gourgeist-XL completely shut down sets lacking Knock Off, which is a suboptimal move. If Throh has acquired no boosts and has no entry hazard support, it essentially has no means of generating any significant pressure. Additionally, boosts can often be challenging to accumulate, which makes Throh passive for a good portion of the battle. While Throh has impressive bulk, mono-Fighting typing doesn't offer many useful resistances, so teams will almost always require a secondary check to special attackers such as Mesprit, Jynx, and Charizard, which will always force it out. Throh's subpar defensive typing allows it to be 3HKOed by many of the tier's stronger special attackers such as Swellow and Magmortar, forcing Throh to rely on good Sleep Talk rolls to win one-on-one.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Offensive Bulk Up sets with Storm Throw / Knock Off / Zen Headbutt are solid in theory, as Throh's decent coverage allows it to break through traditional Fighting-type checks such as Garbodor and Vileplume; however, an offensive Bulk Up set is almost always outperformed by other Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Gurdurr, which are stronger and have access to Drain Punch and priority Mach Punch. A Choice Band set with Guts and a moveset consisting of Storm Throw / Knock Off / Zen Headbutt / Stone Edge transforms Throh from an annoying phazer into a wallbreaker with perfect neutral coverage; however, they are outclassed by Hariyama, which is stronger and has access to multiple forms of priority.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Mesprit, Musharna, and Xatu can threaten out Throh with their STAB moves while being able to switch in safely to any attack outside of Knock Off, which still will never OHKO them due to Throh's somewhat low Attack stat, especially when uninvested.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Scyther, Charizard, and Vivillon threaten Throh with their STAB attacks and can switch into anything Throh can dish out outside of the very rare Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Weezing, Garbodor, and Worry Seed Vileplume are very annoying for Throh to deal with, as they resist Circle Throw and take minimal damage from Knock Off. Weezing in particular is a hindrance, as it can use Taunt to prevent Throh from setting up with Bulk Up or healing itself with Rest.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Throh is very reliant on Rest + Sleep Talk and is 3HKOed by many of NU's most powerful attackers such as Swellow, Tauros, and Aurorus; as such, Throh is very vulnerable to being overwhelmed by immense offensive pressure from an opposing team.</p>",

      "Phazer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>When coupled with entry hazards, Circle Throw works well to phaze opposing Pokemon, forcing them to take more damage every time they enter the field, and potentially stop weaker setup sweepers from boosting. Rest is Throh's only means of recovery, giving it longevity during the match. Sleep Talk allows Throh to not be passive after using Rest with the added benefit that moves selected by Sleep Talk will get an Attack boost from Guts. Bulk Up boosts Throh's Attack and Defense to very high levels and makes it hard to take down after a single boost. Knock Off allows Throh to hit Ghost-types that would otherwise wall it while also hitting Psychic-types such as Mesprit, Xatu, and Musharna and is overall useful for removing opposing Pokemon's items early-game. The inability to boost, however, is very troubling for Throh, and oftentimes it's better to just run a Pursuit trapper to deal with Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment with a Careful nature allows Throh to make the most of its special bulk and allows it to set up on weaker special sweepers or phaze them. Guts is the preferred ability, as it boosts Throh's Attack when it's inflicted with status and pairs well with Rest as Throh's sole way to restore its health. Leftovers is the item of choice, as it increases Throh's longevity over the course of a battle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Throh to pivot into weaker attackers such as Lanturn, Piloswine, and Steelix early- and mid-game, allowing Throh to phaze them, remove their item with Knock Off, or use them as setup fodder. Throh functions best in the later stages of a game after opposing Psychic-, Poison-, and Ghost-types have been removed or severely weakened, as setting up early-game will almost always result in Throh being revenge killed. Throh's early- and mid-game offensive presence is almost nonexistent, as all it can hope to do is phaze opposing Pokemon with weak Circle Throws or potentially remove their items with Knock Off. Ghost-types completely shut down Throh if it doesn't have Knock Off, so it should not set up before they are eliminated. Use Rest whenever Throh is at low HP, but still beware of mindlessly clicking Rest, as it forces Throh to rely on Sleep Talk, which is rather unreliable. Throh also receives an Attack boost by virtue of Guts when asleep, which is always beneficial.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes support works incredibly well alongside Throh and is almost mandatory when using it; Pokemon such as Garbodor, Omastar, Ferroseed, and Roselia are quality setters that can assist in Throh's attempt to effectively shuffle an opposing team. In particular, Omastar's resistance to Flying-type moves from Pokemon such as Archeops and Ferroseed's resistance to Psychic-type moves from Pokemon such as Mesprit are very useful for Throh. Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank, Liepard, and Choice Band Scyther are also some of the best partners for Throh, as they not only eliminate the Ghost-types that prevent Throh from sweeping, but can also can deal with Psychic-types that plague Throh. Ghost-types that can block Rapid Spin to keep Spikes up such as Rotom, Gourgeist-XL, and Mismagius are terrific partners as well. Lastly, bulky Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon such as Piloswine, Steelix, and Rhydon can combat Flying-types such as Scyther and Archeops that force Throh out while also providing Stealth Rock to aid Throh's phazing capability.</p>"

  "Leavanny": {
    "overview": "<p>Leavanny is the fastest user of Sticky Web in the tier, allowing it to set up Sticky Web against most foes even without the aid of a Focus Sash. Leavanny also has dual STAB types that allow it to threaten a wide variety of entry hazard removers and Stealth Rock users, giving it a good lead matchup compared to the other Sticky Web users. This also grants Leavanny the best offensive presence out of all the available Sticky Web users. However, like all Sticky Web users, Leavanny has a poor typing and average bulk, which give it a very short lifespan, preventing it from setting up Sticky Web repeatedly and keeping it on the field, as most entry hazard removers have better longevity than Leavanny. Leavanny also struggles to bypass Xatu, which can ward off Sticky Web with its Magic Bounce. Leavanny's most notable flaw is that it lacks a real way to deter bulky foes from setting up on it outside of raw power, and Leavanny isn't exactly a powerhouse in that regard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Leavanny's Attack stat is superior to its Special Attack stat, the fact that Leaf Storm gives Leavanny the most favorable matchups possible means that running physical moves alongside it is considered less efficient than running full Special Attack investment. Leaf Blade is inferior to Leaf Storm against a large majority of its targets. While X-Scissor is stronger against Skuntank and Cryogonal, a fully invested Bug Buzz does more damage against most targets, particularly Psychic-types that typically run physically defensive investment. Knock Off is the most appealing physical move Leavanny gets, but considering most Xatu run physically defensive investment and commonly hold a Colbur Berry, it is much less effective against Xatu in practice. Knock Off would also require substantial Attack investment, which Leavanny cannot afford without detracting from its Speed or Leaf Storm's power. Leavanny has Flail, which makes mild use of its Focus Sash, but it doesn't offer much in either coverage or consistency. Leavanny has Heal Bell, but Leavanny hardly possesses the longevity required to use it effectively, and Magic Coat is a better response against incoming status moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu's Magic Bounce reflects Leavanny's Sticky Web back to its own side and reduces the Speed of Leavanny's already slow team even further, ensuring that even if Leavanny does successfully use Sticky Web, it would only reset its Speed disadvantage. However, Xatu dislikes switching directly into Bug Buzz, and it should also tread carefully when attacking Leavanny, as a Swarm-boosted Bug Buzz puts a lot of pressure on Xatu.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Pokemon</strong>: Leavanny's main flaw is that it doesn't really have much to deter foes from setting up on it outside of raw damage or slowing down foes with Electroweb. Klinklang and Combusken can set up on Leavanny with ease, and they are even protected from Electroweb's Speed drop due to their abilities Clear Body and Speed Boost, respectively. Garbodor and Roselia can set up Spikes on Leavanny or hit it with Poison-type STAB moves at their leisure, while Mega Audino can effortlessly set up Calm Mind on Leavanny. Leavanny becomes even easier to set up on after Leaf Storm's Special Attack drop, leaving it helpless against most setup sweepers.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Sticky Web</strong>: Flying-type Pokemon such as Scyther, Archeops, Swellow, Vivillon, and Rotom-S are massive threats due to their Sticky Web immunity and powerful offensive presence, which allow them to overwhelm both Leavanny and its teammates. Levitate users such as Mesprit, Haunter, Cryogonal, and Rotom are also notable offensive threats. However, they usually get forced out by Leavanny's teammates if they have been hit by Electroweb beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: While Leavanny has little issues against many of the tier's entry hazard removers, it does have its unfavorable matchups. Cryogonal and Skuntank can clear away Sticky Web and proceed to beat Leavanny with their super effective STAB moves. The far less common Torkoal and Avalugg can also do the same. Alternatively, the other entry hazard removers can attempt to outlast Leavanny and clear Sticky Web in its absence.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sticky Web": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sticky Web slows down the opponent's grounded Pokemon, giving powerful teammates such as Magmortar and Aurorus the advantage in Speed. Leaf Storm is Leavanny's main weapon, demolishing common entry hazard removers such as Kabutops, Prinplup, Claydol, and Sandslash, as well as pummeling various Stealth Rock users such as Rhydon, Piloswine, and Carracosta. Electroweb is an important move for Leavanny, as its Speed drop grants Leavanny more flexibility as a lead. Electroweb lets Leavanny gain the advantage against faster Taunt users such as Archeops and Mismagius, allowing Leavanny to properly decide its next course of action depending on the foe's move without wasting any precious turns. Electroweb also deals some chip damage against faster foes while still allowing Leavanny to set up Sticky Web, as well as slow down foes that have not been affected by Sticky Web for its teammates. Bug Buzz gives Leavanny an additional STAB move and is Leavanny's best weapon against Xatu, especially if boosted by Swarm, while also striking down Mesprit, Torterra, Lilligant, and Shiftry, which may try to set up or use Defog. More importantly, Bug Buzz provides the team insurance against Malamar, which may try to take advantage of Sticky Web with Contrary and pull off a sweep.</p> <p>Magic Coat is a possible alternative to prevent Leavanny from being Taunted outright and allow it to set up Sticky Web, and it is notably useful against defensive Mawile by reflecting back Stealth Rock and Taunt. Magic Coat can also reflect back Spikes and Lovely Kiss from the likes of Garbodor, Roselia, and Jynx, but it would be risky to attempt Magic Coat against these foes due to their super effective STAB moves. Magic Coat also requires stellar prediction and has the potential to do nothing, whereas Electroweb also already makes a fine response against the faster Taunt users and is much safer to use.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature allow Leavanny to outspeed as much as possible, maximizing its chances to set up Sticky Web even without its Focus Sash intact. It also allows Leavanny to outspeed uninvested +1 Malamar, which Leavanny can proceed to KO with Bug Buzz. Maximum Special Attack investment allows Leavanny to dish out the most damage possible, which is important, as its time on the field is short. Focus Sash allows Leavanny to survive any one hit from faster foes. Swarm gives a significant boost to Bug Buzz, which can overwhelm Xatu, but Overcoat is a possible alternative to prevent hail or sand from rendering Leavanny's Focus Sash useless, although neither weather condition is very common.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Setting up Sticky Web should be Leavanny's main priority. However, Leavanny does not necessarily have to lead, as its Speed usually allows it to set up Sticky Web on at least one of the opponent's Pokemon. Because of this, Leavanny can afford to hold off on setting up Sticky Web if it can threaten a KO on a slower Pokemon, namely a Rock-, Water-, or Ground-type, and if the opponent has other slower Pokemon available that can give Leavanny additional opportunities to set up Sticky Web. Should Leavanny, with its Focus Sash intact, face a faster foe, it should use Electroweb before setting up Sticky Web to both deal chip damage and slow down the foe for its teammates; however, this strategy is not advised if the foe has access to any priority moves besides Sucker Punch. Leavanny should exercise caution if Xatu is present on the opponent's team, as Sticky Web can be bounced back via a timely Xatu switch in. Leavanny should hit Xatu on the switch with either Electroweb or Bug Buzz in order to prompt it to use Roost, giving Leavanny's teammates a free switch into it. While it isn't advised to preserve Leavanny, it can be saved for the late-game, as it can launch strong and fast attacks of its own and act as insurance against Malamar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Leavanny only really fits on offensive teams, as they best take advantage of the opposing team's decreased Speed and punish any attempts to use Rapid Spin or Defog with powerful blows. Spinblockers prevent Rapid Spin from clearing Sticky Web, making them useful partners; Misdreavus makes for a reliable bulky spinblocker that can make decent use of Sticky Web with access to Taunt and Will-O-Wisp, Rotom is a more offensive spinblocker that can deal with Flying-types, which are immune to Sticky Web, and Golurk is an offensive powerhouse that is more than capable of making use of Sticky Web. Fighting-types, such as Hitmonchan and Primeape, can punch through slowed foes with little trouble while providing insurance against Pawniard, which is a threat against Sticky Web teams due to Defiant, by virtue of their resistance to Sucker Punch; Primeape even has Defiant as a bonus to take advantage of the opponent's Defog users. Malamar, Servine, and Pawniard make opposing Xatu's attempts at bouncing back Leavanny's Sticky Web fruitless, as the Contrary users will receive a boost in Speed and outrun foes, while Pawniard trades Speed for a +2 Attack boost, which is incredibly useful when using Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Powerful attackers in general highly appreciate Sticky Web support; the likes of Magmortar, Jynx, Aurorus, Kabutops, Zangoose, Kangaskhan, and Mawile gain a wider range of targets that they can now plow through. It is advisable to have teammates that can counter Flying-types and Levitate users, most of which pack great offensive presence of their own and are immune to Sticky Web; Rhydon, Piloswine, Aurorus, and Kabutops make for decent stops against Flying-types, while priority moves can also help to keep both Flying-types and Levitate users in check. Alternatively, equipping a Choice Scarf on the likes of Jynx and Rotom can also help combat airborne Pokemon. Rapid Spin users such as Kabutops and Sandslash can get rid of entry hazards for Leavanny should it not want to lead but still intend to keep its Focus Sash intact, but this isn't particularly necessary.</p>"

  "Lilligant": {
    "overview": "<p>Lilligant is able to effectively utilize one of the best boosting moves in the game, Quiver Dance. This is complemented by its access to Sleep Powder, which can ease setup and shut down potential threats. Lilligant is also one of the few setup sweepers in the tier that can reliably switch into bulky Water-types. Unfortunately, Lilligant has limited coverage and thus must rely on Hidden Power and Nature Power. Lilligant's poor defensive typing leaves it very vulnerable to Ice-, Flying-, Poison-, and Fire-types; Scyther, Vileplume, and Magmortar are all quite common in NU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ground can be used to hit Skuntank, Garbodor, Fire-types, as well as the majority of Steel-types, while Hidden Power Rock can target Scyther, Fire-types, and Flying-types. Leech Seed grants Lilligant added recovery while wearing down its foes, but Lilligant loses out on coverage. Synthesis and Heal Bell lend Lilligant a more supportive role. Substitute can be used to ease prediction and block status, but again, Lilligant loses out on coverage. Quiver Dance + Petal Dance with Own Tempo is a viable option, but Petal Dance's lock-in effect might give the opponent a chance to revenge kill it. Yache Berry is also an option to take a hit from Ice-types such as Jynx and retaliate, but its usage is quite situational.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Garbodor, Roselia, and Vileplume can take any attack from Lilligant and retaliate with their respective STAB attacks. However, the former two have to be careful of Sleep Powder from Lilligant, as it can cripple them severely, and the latter two fear Hidden Power Fire variants.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Magmortar, Charizard, Pyroar, and Ninetales can beat Lilligant, but all of them should be wary of Hidden Power Rock variants. Magmortar is immune to Sleep Powder, and Assault Vest variants of Magmortar can survive a boosted Hidden Power Rock and retaliate with a STAB move. Pyroar and Ninetales naturally outspeed Lilligant and can use their powerful Fire STAB moves to heavily damage it.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Xatu is immune to Lilligant's Sleep Powder and resists Lilligant's STAB moves. It can set up a Calm Mind against Lilligant, paralyze it, or pivot out with a super effective U-turn. However, Xatu loses to Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Rock variants of Lilligant. Other bulky Flying-types such as Vullaby fear boosted Hidden Power Rock or Hidden Power Ice, but Vullaby can take a hit from Lilligant at full health and is immune to Sleep Powder. Offensive Flying-types such as Vivillon, Rotom-S, and Scyther only fear Hidden Power Rock and Sleep Powder and can use their powerful Flying-type moves to heavily damage Lilligant. The latter has to be careful of Hidden Power Fire too.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Sap Sipper</strong>: Pokemon that have the ability Sap Sipper, such as Sliggoo, Miltank, and Bouffalant, are immune to Lilligant's STAB moves as well as Sleep Powder and take minimal damage from its coverage moves. Sliggoo is also able to set up on Lilligant with Curse, while Bouffalant can use it to set up with Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Bulky Ice-types such as Cryogonal can take a hit from Lilligant and only fear Sleep Powder. Other Ice-types such as Jynx and Aurorus cannot safely switch in, but both of them can KO Lilligant with their STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance boosts Lilligant's Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed in one fell swoop. Giga Drain is used as a consistent STAB move that has the additional benefit of healing Lilligant. Hidden Power Rock primarily targets Fire- and Flying-types such as Charizard, Pyroar, Scyther, and Xatu. Hidden Power Fire hits Grass-, Steel-, and Bug-types such as Ferroseed, Abomasnow, Klinklang, and Scyther. Hidden Power Ice is an option to nail bulky Grass-types such as Vileplume and bulky Flying-types such as Xatu in one moveslot without reducing Lilligant's speed IV. Sleep Powder eases setup and shuts down foes that are slower than Lilligant.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb is used to further amplify Lilligant's already high damage output. A Yache Berry is also an option that prevents Lilligant from being revenge killed by Abomasnow and Piloswine's Ice Shard. Chlorophyll grants Lilligant a better matchup against occasional sun teams. 252 EVs are placed in Special Attack to maximize Lilligant's power. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Lilligant to outspeed threats such as positive-natured Pinsir and Mesprit and neutral-natured Kangaskhan and Zangoose before boosting, as well as to Speed tie Jolly variants of the latter two Pokemon, if not running Hidden Power Rock or Fire. Lum Berry acts as a safety net against annoying status conditions such as poison and paralysis and allows Lilligant to switch into Water-types more safely, most of which carry Scald.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Players should only attempt to sweep once Lilligant's checks and counters have been weakened or eliminated, otherwise Lilligant may be forced out regardless. It should also be noted that Lilligant needs two boosts to outspeed some Choice Scarf users such as Haunter, Scyther, and Rotom. Players should switch Lilligant into bulky Water- and Ground-types such as Quagsire and Rhydon, as Lilligant resist their STAB moves. However, it cannot safely switch into the latter's Rock Blast and Megahorn. Try to bring Lilligant in on predicted switches, as Lilligant does not like taking unnecessary damage. Players should also not use Sleep Powder recklessly, as it has poor accuracy and grants free switches to Pokemon such as Magmortar and Xatu. Try to predict the opponent's switches into Lilligant's counters, and use Sleep Powder to make it easier to set up. Lilligant can use Sleep Powder early-game to support its teammates or use it late-game when it will attempt to sweep. Players should predict when their opponent will send in certain Pokemon as sleep fodder. This can be accomplished in Team Preview by looking for the least-useful Pokemon on the opponent's team in its current matchup, as well as mid-battle by looking for weakened Pokemon on the opponent's team. If Lilligant is not your primary sweeper, it can be used to poke holes in the opposing team to support its teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Water-types such as Samurott, Kabutops, and Lanturn can benefit Lilligant, as they can dispatch Fire-types such as Magmortar and Pyroar for it. Entry hazards can also greatly aid Lilligant by weakening its checks and counters; good setters include Carracosta, Garbodor, and Archeops. Carracosta in particular can handle Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-types for Lilligant, while Lilligant can deal with Ground- and Electric-types for it. Entry hazards can also pick up crucial KOs for Lilligant that it cannot achieve without them. For instance, Stealth Rock guarantees a 2HKO on Malamar with +1 Life Orb-boosted Giga Drain after Leftovers recovery. Wallbreakers such as Kangaskhan, Aurorus, and Tauros can greatly benefit Lilligant, as they can weaken its checks and counters with their massive offensive presence. Lastly, Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Primeape make good partners, as they can get rid of Steel-types such as Klinklang and Mawile as well as Bouffalant, one of the best counters to Lilligant. Hariyama is a great partner in particular, as it can handle Ice- and Fire-types for Lilligant. Primeape and Hariyama can also carry coverage moves such as Earthquake to weaken Poison-types such as Garbodor and Muk.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is Lilligant's strongest move; its high damage output makes Lilligant an efficient revenge killer. Hidden Power Rock allows Lilligant to KO a bunch of Pokemon that otherwise would wall it completely, like Scyther and Vivillon. Giga Drain is Lilligant's secondary STAB move, making it able to reliably pick off weakened targets without having to fear a miss, as well as increasing Lilligant's longevity. Sleep Powder can be used to avoid getting Pursuit trapped by Skuntank, for example, and is used to create free turns for teammates. Healing Wish gives Lilligant the ability to support the rest of its team by completely healing them up when needed. Since Choice Scarf Lilligant outpaces almost the entire metagame, this can often be a quite reliable backup check to many major threats that may otherwise get out of hand. Petal Dance is an alternative over Giga Drain to give Lilligant the ability to pick between a one-off nuke in Leaf Storm and a strong cleaning move to use when Pokemon that resist Grass have been weakened and Lilligant has a potential chance to sweep late-game. However, it has several drawbacks such as making contact and preventing Lilligant from switching out, which makes it easy to be revenge killed by a majority of Pokemon that can survive multiple Petal Dances, such as Garbodor and Skuntank. When you are running Petal Dance, Own Tempo is the preferred ability to avoid getting confused and to keep spamming Petal Dance without any additional drawbacks. Lastly, Hidden Power Fire can be used over either Giga Drain or Hidden Power Rock to hit common Pokemon that resist Grass like Ferroseed, Vileplume, and other Lilligant. Running Hidden Power Fire does have some drawbacks, however; being outsped by +2 Combusken and Omastar and not being able to revenge kill Vivillon with a Quiver Dance under its belt might be crucial in some matches.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Lilligant, while equipped with a Choice Scarf, is able to outpace the entire unboosted metagame including major threats like Archeops and Tauros. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Lilligant to outspeed Vivillon after it gets up a Quiver Dance, as well as various other threats like Swellow and Floatzel, which can otherwise KO it when it is slightly weakened. Maximum Special Attack investment maximizes Lilligant's offensive power, making it a scary threat that is able to revenge kill a bunch of offensive Pokemon when slightly weakened like Floatzel, Archeops, and Swellow, depending on the chosen move. When you run Petal Dance, however, Own Tempo is the preferred ability, as it allows Lilligant to endlessly spam it, not having to fear confusion.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lilligant should mostly be used as a revenge killer, as its already high Speed combined with a Choice Scarf allows it to effectively pick off faster targets such as Archeops, Floatzel, and Tauros when they are weakened slightly. Lilligant should sometimes be wary of using Leaf Storm or Giga Drain, as it allows free setup for Pokemon like Scyther and Vivillon, which both don't take much damage from it but are heavily dented if not OHKOed by Hidden Power Rock. Sleep Powder can be used versus targets that Lilligant can't deal with by using its own attacks, such as Pyroar, Garbodor, and Skuntank. If Lilligant isn't as useful in the match anymore and a weakened teammate needs some support, use Healing Wish. Make sure to carefully think through whether or not Lilligant's high Speed tier is still necessary to secure a victory.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Lilligant struggles to deal with bulky Poison-types such as Garbodor and Skuntank, Psychic-types like Mesprit and bulky Ground-types like Rhydon and Steelix are great partners for Lilligant; they can handle the majority of checks to Lilligant as well as set up Stealth Rock to heavily dent most Pokemon that resist Grass like Magmortar and Scyther. Setup sweepers such as Samurott and Barbaracle have great synergy with Lilligant, as they can wear down each other's checks quite easily, offer decent synergy, and heavily appreciate the Healing Wish support Lilligant offers. Pokemon that tend to wear themselves down like Zangoose, Guts Swellow, and Abomasnow heavily appreciate Lilligant's ability to support them with Healing Wish. Besides that, they also offer decent synergy type-wise, wearing down each other's checks and counters. All hazard support from Pokemon like Garbodor is also heavily appreciated, as it helps out with weakening some of Lilligant's checks such as Skuntank and Magmortar. Regirock and Rhydon have great type synergy with Lilligant, most importantly being hard checks to Scyther, and can also set up Stealth Rock to help Lilligant wear down bulkier Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Weezing and Magmortar. Lanturn is another great teammate for Choice Scarf Lilligant, as it deals with most Fire-types relatively well, can Volt Switch out to bring Lilligant in safely, and heavily appreciates Lilligant's ability to check Gastrodon, as well as Lilligant's Healing Wish.</p>"

  "Carracosta": {
    "overview": "<p>A solid typing combined with excellent physical bulk lets Carracosta check Archeops, Scyther, Normal-types, Fire-types, and various other physical attackers. Solid Rock further enhances its defensive capabilities, allowing it to take weak or non-STAB super effective moves with ease. Carracosta also boasts access to the coveted Shell Smash, the best setup move in the game, which it finds ample opportunity to use due to its aforementioned qualities. Shell Smash pairs well with Carracosta's high Attack and decent Special Attack stats, as it is able to attack with boosted physical or special hits to surprise its checks and counters. Carracosta isn't perfect, however; its low Speed stat means that it can't outspeed much of anything, and even at +2 it's not that fast. A low Special Defense stat makes Carracosta struggle to check most moderately strong special attackers. For all its advantages, its typing leaves it weak to several common types, most notably giving it an exploitable 3x weakness to Grass with Solid Rock and mild susceptibility to Fighting- and Electric-types. Carracosta also faces competition from Barbaracle as a physical Shell Smash user, as Barbaracle has important niches in its wide coverage, Tough Claws, and, most importantly, a higher Speed stat that lets it outspeed Swellow and most Choice Scarf users.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A fully physically based Shell Smash set can be used, but it is generally outclassed by Barbaracle due to its higher Speed. An offensive Stealth Rock set still has plenty of opportunities to set it up, has an excellent matchup against Xatu, spinners, and Defoggers, and functions as a powerful bulky attacker. White Herb allows Carracosta to retain its bulk after setting up and makes it less susceptible to priority, but it comes at the significant cost of Life Orb's power boost. Zen Headbutt can be used to hit Poliwrath and Gurdurr, while Hidden Power Grass deals heavy damage to Gastrodon. Weakness Policy gives Carracosta a ridiculous power boost combined with Shell Smash, and it pairs nicely with both Solid Rock, Sturdy, and Carracosta's many common weaknesses. However, this strategy is rather unreliable, and Carracosta will more consistently benefit from other items. An Assault Vest set can lure in special attackers that expect to KO it easily and hit them hard with its STAB attacks or cripple switch-ins with Knock Off or Scald burns.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Most Grass-types can come in with relative ease as Carracosta goes for a Water-type move, outspeed, and OHKO with their STAB move. After a Shell Smash, however, only very physically bulky Grass-types, such as Gourgeist-XL, Leafeon, and Ferroseed, can survive a +2 Stone Edge, though the former two are beaten by Ice Beam variants of Carracosta.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types can usually take even a boosted Stone Edge and severely weaken if not outright beat Carracosta with Scald or even a super effective secondary STAB or coverage move. Poliwrath and Gastrodon in particular counter most sets, with the former resisting both of Carracosta's STAB moves and having access to Vacuum Wave and the latter simply tanking its attacks with Recover and KOing with Earth Power, though Poliwrath is OHKOed by the occasional +2 Zen Headbutt, and Gastrodon can be OHKOed by a boosted Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p><strong>Fast Pokemon and Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Due to Carracosta's extremely low Speed stat, it is outsped even at +2 by Pokemon with a Speed stat higher than 98 if Adamant or 110 if Jolly or Timid, which includes basically all common Choice Scarf users, Floatzel, and Swellow, which can deal heavy damage with its Boomburst due to Carracosta's low special bulk. However, Aqua Jet bypasses their higher Speed and can KO weakened foes or those hit super effectively by it. Choice Scarf Lilligant and Jynx get special mentions due to their resistance and immunity to Aqua Jet, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage Moves</strong>: Grass- and Electric-type coverage allows Fire-types that would otherwise be walled by Carracosta, such as Pyroar and Magmortar, to beat it as it comes in; however, Aqua Jet can KO them before they can attack. Physical super effective coverage moves, such as Earthquake from Tauros and Archeops, on the other hand, don't deal much damage due to Solid Rock and Carracosta's high physical defense.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is one of the best moves in the game and Carracosta is one of its better setters, finding ample opportunities to set it up and having decent matchups against most spinners and Defoggers. Scald has decent power and has a high chance to burn the foe, severely crippling physical attackers and wearing down otherwise hard counters to Carracosta such as Vileplume and Torterra. Rock Slide hits from Carracosta's higher Attack stat and has solid coverage alongside Scald, and it has higher accuracy and PP than Stone Edge. It also smacks Xatu, which might want to try to bounce back Carracosta's Stealth Rock. Carracosta has a very versatile last slot. Knock Off removes items and cripples switch-ins such as Gurdurr. Toxic statuses switch-ins and helps Carracosta more quickly wear down the foe. Protect gives Carracosta a little extra HP from Leftovers, gains an extra turn for burn damage on the foe, and lets Carracosta scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Primeape and Mesprit. Aqua Jet picks off weakened foes and Pokemon weak to it, notably allowing Carracosta to hit Double Dance Rhydon, as well as Fire-types before they can KO Carracosta with a Grass-type coverage move, but is generally very weak. Stone Edge can be used over Rock Slide, as it hits harder in general and, in particular, OHKOes Pyroar after one round of Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The spread and a boosting nature make Carracosta ridiculously physically bulky, and the Special Defense investment ensures Carracosta can avoid an OHKO from Life Orb Pyroar's Hidden Power Grass. Relaxed is chosen as to not weaken Carracosta's attacking options, and Carracosta is exceedingly slow anyways. A spread of 252 HP / 92 Def / 168 SpD lets Carracosta take special attacks significantly better, specifically allowing it to take a Life Orb Pyroar's Hidden Power Grass after Stealth Rock. Solid Rock lets Carracosta take non-STAB physical super effective moves, notably Earthquake coverage, much better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Come in on the Normal-, Flying-, and Fire-types, such as Kangaskhan, Archeops, and Choice Specs Pyroar, and various other physical attackers that Carracosta walls throughout the game. Set up Stealth Rock early-game, unless the opponent has Shiftry or any other entry hazard remover that beats Carracosta, against which it's better for Carracosta to cripple them as they switch in with Toxic, Knock Off, or even a Scald burn. If the opponent has a Xatu and they are aware this is defensive Carracosta, go for Rock Slide or Scald if predicting it to switch in to bounce back Stealth Rock. Scald is Carracosta's most spammable move due to its burn chance, and should be used if the opponent is likely to send in a counter such as Vileplume and Gourgeist-XL. Knock Off and Toxic can similarly be used to cripple most common switch-ins. Use Protect when in against Choice-locked Pokemon such as Primeape and Mesprit to see which move they use, and then switch or stay in accordingly. If running Aqua Jet, Carracosta can be used as a revenge killer for Pokemon weak to the move or low on health. Due to its lack of reliable recovery, be careful switching in if Carracosta is needed for another threat, as, for example, the Fire-types it checks can severely weaken if not outright KO it with super effective coverage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A check to Grass-types is a mandatory partner for Carracosta, with Xatu, Scyther, Ice-types, Poison-types, and Fire-types all working well as partners. Garbodor or Roselia also forms an entry hazard-stacking core with Carracosta, with the former being an overall better Grass and Fighting check and the latter being a check to the Water-, Electric-, and Ground-types that trouble Carracosta. Most Grass-types make quick work of the Water-, Electric-, and Ground-types that wall or threaten Carracosta, and in return it takes on Flying- and Fire-types for them. Thanks to its access to Freeze-Dry and great special bulk, Cryogonal also serves as a solid answer to the aforementioned threats to Carracosta. Psychic-, Flying-, Poison-, and Ghost-types can check or counter Fighting-types, which can severely dent if not outright KO Carracosta with their STAB moves. Pokemon such as Klinklang and Electric-types appreciate Carracosta's ability to cripple the likes of Gastrodon and Grass-types with Toxic, Knock Off, and Scald burns in the latter case. Due to Carracosta's somewhat passive nature, it gives common sweepers a lot of setup opportunities, making answers to the likes of Malamar, Gurdurr, and Calm Mind Psychic-types, such as Scyther and Signal Beam Psychic-types, very welcome partners.</p>"

      "Mixed Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash doubles Carracosta's Speed, Attack, and Special Attack, giving it great sweeping and wallbreaking potential. Hydro Pump swamps the numerous physically bulky Pokemon in the tier, such as Weezing, Gurdurr, Garbodor, Klinklang, and other such Pokemon that would expect to take a boosted Waterfall. Stone Edge is Carracosta's main weapon against Water-types, such as Lanturn, Ludicolo, and Samurott, as well as nailing Jynx and Roselia; it is also Carracosta's strongest attack in general. Ice Beam demolishes bulky Grass-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Vileplume and is more reliable than Stone Edge to KO frailer Grass-types with.</p> <p>Superpower is a viable option to surprise Ferroseed and Hariyama, KOing them after a Shell Smash boost and Spikes damage, while also having enough power to beat the likes of Ludicolo at +2 and Jynx without risking a miss from Stone Edge. The Attack drop is not as much of a hindrance, as Carracosta can fall back on Hydro Pump, though the Defense drop alongside that of Shell Smash can make Carracosta more susceptible to priority attacks such as Sucker Punch and Mach Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment coupled with a Naive nature allows Carracosta to Speed tie with opposing positive-natured Carracosta and offensive Adamant Rhydon while also outrunning positive-natured base 110 Speed Pokemon, such as Tauros and Archeops, after a Shell Smash boost. The Naive nature is chosen because Special Defense is Carracosta's least important stat. 28 Attack EVs allow Carracosta to OHKO bulky Lanturn with +2 Stone Edge after Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack, maximizing Carracosta's damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mixed Carracosta is primarily a wallbreaker that can punch holes in defensive cores expecting a physically inclined set. It can sweep late-game if given the chance, though its lack of priority makes it ill suited at that role. Carracosta can set up on Normal-type and Flying-type attackers such as Tauros, Kangaskhan, Archeops, and Scyther, as well Pyroar Choice-locked into a Fire-type move. It can also find additional setup opportunities by bluffing Aqua Jet to force out weakened foes and Pokemon weak to Water such as Pyroar and Magmortar. However, be aware of foes that Carracosta cannot outspeed after a Shell Smash boost, such as Floatzel, Swellow, and Choice Scarf users, as they can easily stop its sweep.</p> <p>Mixed Carracosta can be an effective lure, as revealing only Stone Edge would not give away Carracosta's true nature as a mixed attacker. Thus, Carracosta usually finds itself easily KOing the opponent's physically defensive Pokemon with its boosted special attacks. On the other hand, revealing Hydro Pump early prompts the opponent to switch in their specially defensive Pokemon or a Pokemon resistant to Water, most of which fear a boosted Stone Edge. Note that Carracosta's lack of priority means it should try to minimize damage when switching in and before it uses Shell Smash, as its opportunities to set up and thus punch holes can be diminished as a result.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes support is very helpful to help Carracosta achieve certain OHKOs; Garbodor, Cacturne, and offensive Roselia are good Spikers that can cover Carracosta's weaknesses to Grass, Ground, Fighting, and Electric as well. Stealth Rock Mesprit is a good partner as well, as it can take Ground- and Fighting-type attacks aimed at Carracosta, fend off Poison-types, provide Healing Wish support, and take on Hariyama should Carracosta lack Superpower. In return, Carracosta can take on the likes of Scyther and Skuntank for Mesprit. Pokemon like Swellow, Tauros, Kangaskhan, Scyther, and Lilligant, which pressure offensive teams, can apply immediate offensive pressure and benefit from Carracosta's ability to lure their checks and counters while softening up the opponent's team. Fire-types, such as Pyroar and Magmortar, make for especially helpful teammates, as they can switch into Grass-type moves and Freeze-Dry for Carracosta while dispatching of Ferroseed, lessening Carracosta's need for Superpower.</p>"

  "Archeops": {
    "overview": "<p>With its gargantuan mixed attacking stats and a blazing Speed that lets it outspeed almost all of the unboosted metagame, Archeops has established itself as one of the best Pokemon in the tier. Its offensive stats are matched with an equally strong offensive movepool, with a wide variety of both special and physical moves that allow Archeops to potentially beat almost every one of its counters. In particular, STAB Acrobatics is one of the most spammable and powerful attacks in the tier, though it comes at the price of not being able to viably run an item. Archeops's typing is even decent defensively, giving it resistances to Normal-, Fire-, Bug-, and Flying-type moves, and its access to reliable recovery in Roost and support moves in Taunt and Defog gives Archeops both defensive and supportive utility. While these would all be traits of an easily OverUsed or even Ubers Pokemon, Archeops's wings are clipped by Defeatist, which makes Archeops virtually useless when it's below half HP. A Stealth Rock weakness and low defenses don't do Archeops any favors in compensating for its ability, either. In addition, very common Pokemon such as Rhydon, Steelix, and Regirock check Archeops with ease if it lacks the appropriate coverage move.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set with Stone Edge / Earthquake / U-turn / Knock Off or Aerial Ace gives Archeops ridiculous power, 2HKOing stupidly bulky Pokemon such as Prinplup, and Archeops even has Switcheroo to cripple walls and be able to use its coverage afterwards. A Life Orb also gives a significant power boost while allowing Archeops to switch moves, use Roost, and even go mixed, but the recoil will eventually bring Archeops down to Defeatist range, especially if it switches into Stealth Rock. Carrying an item in general, however, is a pretty subpar option on Archeops, as STAB Acrobatics is just too good to give up. Taunt on offensive Archeops sets allows it to get past all of non-Surf Mega Audino, Musharna, Weezing, and Seismic Toss Miltank, but its coverage moves are typically more useful, and Archeops is forced to run Roost alongside Taunt. BulkyCheops can set up Stealth Rock if nothing else on its team can. Tailwind is an option to support its teammates, with Archeops usually sacrificing itself to set Tailwind up when it isn't needed anymore to let a slower teammate outspeed the foe. Iron Tail can also work on certain teams to 3HKO Mega Audino, but has very little use outside of that.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Rock-types</strong>: Bulky Rock-types such as Rhydon, Omastar, and Regirock are found on most teams as Stealth Rock setters and check Archeops with relative ease, as they don't take much damage from either of its STAB types. They have to watch out for Earth Power, however, and due to their lack of reliable recovery, they can be worn down by a combination of repeated chip damage and entry hazards, especially if their Leftovers or, in the case of Rhydon, Eviolite gets removed by the rare Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Prinplup and Carracosta can switch into Archeops well and KO it with their Water-type STAB moves. Samurott and Kabutops can revenge kill Archeops with Aqua Jet, but they aren't reliable switch-ins because they get 2HKOed by Acrobatics and Earth Power, respectively. Carracosta and Shuca Berry Barbaracle can use either Archeops lacking Hidden Power Grass or Focus Blast or BulkyCheops as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Some physically bulky Pokemon, even those that don't resist Acrobatics, such as Mega Audino, Musharna, Miltank, Piloswine, and Weezing, wall Archeops because of their high bulk and because they aren't weak to Archeops's coverage moves. A lot of these can be beaten by sets with Taunt and Roost, however. Note that Miltank and Piloswine are 2HKOed by the rare Focus Blast, and the latter takes significant damage from Aqua Tail.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Steelix, Ferroseed, Klinklang, and Pawniard make for good checks to Archeops as they resist Acrobatics and threaten Archeops with their STAB moves. Ferroseed makes for the best check out of all of them given that it only fears the rare Heat Wave and is only 3HKOed by Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Not only is Archeops weak to Stealth Rock, but it also gets brought down to Defeatist range after switching into it three times, making Stealth Rock especially deadly for it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon, Choice Scarf Users, and Priority Moves</strong>: Faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users, such as Floatzel, Choice Scarf Jynx, and Choice Scarf Rotom, can outspeed and KO Archeops, but they can only switch into it once at best. STAB super effective priority attacks from the likes of Piloswine and Samurott can KO Archeops, but even neutral or non-STAB super effective priority moves such as Shiftry's Sucker Punch and Hariyama's Bullet Punch can spell doom for Archeops by bringing it down to Defeatist range.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Acrobatics is a powerful Flying-type STAB move and Archeops's most spammable move. Stone Edge targets most Pokemon that resist Flying-type attacks, dealing great damage against Rotom and Lanturn, as well as notably OHKOing Rotom-S, Xatu, Pelipper, Mantine, bulky Charizard, and opposing Archeops. Earth Power primarily targets Steel-types and takes advantage of the low Special Defense typical of common Archeops switch-ins, such as Mawile, Garbodor, Omastar, Rock Polish Rhydon, and most notably Steelix. Roost lets Archeops recover health on forced switches and against Pokemon that can't do much to it to keep it out of Defeatist range, but it typically doesn't get too many opportunities to use it. Heat Wave is also an option over Earth Power that targets Ferroseed, which walls this set otherwise, as well as still hit the likes of Steelix and Mawile. Hidden Power Grass nails bulky Rock-, Ground-, and Water-types such as Rhydon, Carracosta, and Quagsire for, most of the time, 4x super effective damage. Focus Blast can be used to hit almost all of Hidden Power Grass's targets except for Quagsire for about the same damage, with the bonus of beating Steelix, Regirock, Ferroseed, and Miltank, but its low accuracy makes it rather unreliable. Aqua Tail is another option to 2HKO Rhydon as well as hitting opposing Archeops. Knock Off nails Rotom, does good damage to Musharna, and removes Leftovers and Eviolite from the likes of Regirock and Rhydon, respectively, making them significantly easier to wear down and beat, notably letting Archeops 2HKO tank Rhydon with Hidden Power Grass or Focus Blast.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Hasty nature let Archeops outspeed the majority of the tier and Speed tie with other base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Tauros while not weakening any of its moves. The rest of the EVs are placed into Attack in order to give Acrobatics and Stone Edge a powerful punch. Archeops can opt to run maximum Special Attack investment in order to 2HKO standard tank Rhydon with Hidden Power Grass or Focus Blast and Regirock with Focus Blast, and it can still hit hard physically due to its naturally high Attack and the high Base Power of Acrobatics. No item is used as to double Acrobatics's power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because of Archeops's frailty, its Stealth Rock weakness, and the threat of getting down to Defeatist range, it should rarely switch into even resisted hits, especially if it doesn't have Roost. Generally, it's best to bring Archeops in on a teammate's U-turn or Volt Switch on a predicted switch, preventing it from taking any damage. Once in, Acrobatics is usually Archeops's most spammable move due to its high Base Power and great neutral coverage, and even if the opponent has a Pokemon that resists Flying such as Klinklang or Barbaracle, Archeops can simply go for the appropriate coverage move in the next turn and KO it. If the opponent has a bulky Rock-type or Steel-type such as Omastar, Rhydon, or Steelix, it's best to go for Earth Power as they switch in in order to 3HKO or 2HKO them. If one of Archeops's counters such as Musharna, Regirock, or Miltank (the latter two are counters only if it lacks Focus Blast, though) is on the opposing team, double switch into a teammate that threatens them in order to maintain momentum and potentially make them take entry hazard damage. Roost off damage on forced switches to stay out of Defeatist range. Roost is also useful to evade a Sucker Punch that could otherwise KO Archeops.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Water-, Grass-, and Fighting-type partners, such as Samurott, Torterra, and Primeape, handle the Rock-, Water-, and, to a lesser extent, Steel-types that check Archeops. Generally speaking, Archeops appreciates special wallbreakers, such as Life Orb Haunter and Magmortar, that can pressure physically bulky Pokemon. Entry hazard control from the likes of Xatu, Prinplup, Shiftry, and Hitmonchan is recommended, as not only is it weak to Stealth Rock, but it also becomes useless in Defeatist range; Archeops doesn't need this support, however, as it is generally found on offensive teams. Pokemon such as Garbodor or Cacturne can stack up (Toxic) Spikes to help Archeops wear down its checks and counters. Sweepers such as Swords Dance Samurott, Swords Dance Mawile, and Tauros love Archeops's ability to lure Rock- and Steel-types and Quagsire and weaken them with its wide coverage so that they can sweep late-game. U-turn and Volt Switch support from the likes of Scyther, Rotom, and Lanturn helps Archeops get in safely.</p>"
      },
      "BulkyCheops": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Acrobatics is a powerful Flying-type STAB move and has good neutral coverage by itself. Roost provides Archeops with reliable recovery and allows it to remain healthy throughout the match. Taunt prevents foes from using support moves, setting up, and healing themselves, allowing Archeops to beat Pokemon it otherwise wouldn't such as Mega Audino and Weezing. Earthquake hits Steel- and Electric-types that resist Acrobatics such as Mawile and Lanturn and lets Archeops get at least some damage on bulky Rock-types, in addition to hitting Garbodor without making contact. Defog supports the team by getting rid of entry hazards, and while Archeops has a terrible matchup against most Stealth Rock setters, it handles Garbodor pretty well. U-turn allows Archeops to pivot out of its switch-ins and gain momentum.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment allows Archeops to take both physical and special hits better, and maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature allow it to outspeed common Pokemon it checks such as Pyroar and Speed tie with the likes of Tauros and Jumpluff. No item is used as to maximize the power of Acrobatics.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Archeops can come in on the Normal-, Fire-, Flying-, and Flying-types it checks throughout the game, but it will often find itself taking around 50% damage from these Pokemon. Because of this, Archeops often wants to use Roost after switching in, particularly if it took Stealth Rock damage. If Archeops didn't take too much damage, however, it can spam Acrobatics to deal good damage against anything that doesn't resist it. However, if there is a bulky Rock-type on the opposing team, Archeops can either Taunt it as it comes in to prevent it from setting up Stealth Rock or switch to a teammate that threatens it. Other typical answers to Archeops lose to this set, however, as Pokemon such as Musharna, Seismic Toss Miltank, Weezing, and Mega Audino without Surf can't inflict status on Archeops, set up, or recover HP because of Taunt and can't 2HKO Archeops with their unboosted attacking options. Defog Archeops can switch into (Toxic) Spikes setters such as Garbodor and Weezing, Defog away their entry hazards, and Taunt them, though it has to play around Will-O-Wisp in the latter's case and hates getting poisoned by Gunk Shot and Sludge Bomb; moreover, keep in mind that Defog Archeops has a uniformly terrible matchup against most Stealth Rock setters.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>BulkyCheops fits on most playstyles as a glue Pokemon that checks Fire-, Normal-, and Flying-types, stallbreaks, and even removes entry hazards while still being extremely fast and hitting hard. Archeops appreciates Water-, Ground-, and Fighting-type partners, such as Samurott, Torterra, and Hariyama, that can check and beat the Rock- and, to a lesser extent, Steel-types that handle Archeops. Grass- and Electric-types such as Torterra, Vileplume, and Lanturn put a stop to the Water- and Electric-types that beat Archeops. Pokemon such as Hariyama and Assault Vest Magmortar that check the Ice-types Archeops struggles with are also decent partners. Although it's not necessary by any means, entry hazard control from the likes of Shiftry and Prinplup helps Archeops check foes with greater ease, as it won't have to take Stealth Rock damage when coming in.</p>"
      },
      "Suicide Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is necessary for all teams, and Archeops is a decent setter for hyper offensive ones due to its excellent Speed and matchup versus Xatu. Taunt prevents the foe from setting up entry hazards, weather, or a boosting move. Endeavor allows Archeops to essentially eliminate a foe by bringing it down to 1 HP once its Focus Sash is broken. Head Smash allows Archeops to smash Xatu and to KO itself to prevent the foe from using Rapid Spin or Defog.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature are necessary to outspeed as much as possible and to guarantee Archeops at least two turns on the field, and maximum Attack investment makes Head Smash even more powerful. Focus Sash lets Archeops survive any non-multi-hit move if it hasn't taken any prior damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Archeops should typically lead in order to avoid getting its Focus Sash broken and set up Stealth Rock as early as possible. In most scenarios, Archeops should prioritize setting Stealth Rock first. If the opponent leads off with an entry hazard setter of their own or a setup sweeper, Archeops can Taunt them. A lot of 50/50s are created when Archeops is up against Pokemon with multi-hit moves such as Rhydon, Crustle, and Klinklang. In the former two cases, it's generally best to go for Stealth Rock rather than to Taunt them unless the cost of Stealth Rock on Archeops's side is too high. Klinklang's case is trickier, however; if Archeops's team has an answer to it, it's generally safe to set up Stealth Rock, but if the team doesn't, it might be better for Archeops to Taunt Klinklang to prevent it from sweeping or creating huge holes in Archeops's team right after the first turn. After Archeops has been knocked down to its Focus Sash, go for Endeavor to effectively KO the foe by bringing it down to 1 HP. On the other hand, if Archeops is up against a spinner or Defogger, it should use Head Smash to KO itself with recoil to prevent it from successfully using Rapid Spin or Defog. If the opponent has Xatu but nothing that can revenge kill Archeops with its Focus Sash broken, nail Xatu with Head Smash on the predicted switch to prevent it from bouncing back Stealth Rock; if the opponent does have a priority attacker or a Pokemon that outspeeds Archeops, it might be best to lead with something else, or you can risk the 50/50 if necessary. Judging whether Xatu checks something important on Archeops's team or if its only role in the match is to bounce back Stealth Rock can ease prediction.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Archeops fits best on hyper offensive teams that want a fast Stealth Rock lead that can Taunt opposing leads. Archeops doesn't need much support, so it can be paired with just about any other offensive Pokemon, such as Swords Dance Samurott and Lilligant. An answer to Klinklang, such as Poliwrath or Steelix, is appreciated, as not only does Klinklang play obnoxious mind games with Archeops, but it also is one of the biggest threats to the fast, frail offensive teams that Archeops finds a home on. A spinblocker or Defog deterrent, such as Mismagius or Pawniard, respectively, prevents spinners and Defoggers from getting rid of Archeops's Stealth Rock. Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank and Liepard can prevent Archeops from having to play mind games with Xatu, but this isn't always necessary.</p>"

  "Garbodor": {
    "overview": "<p>Garbodor is the most consistent Spiker in NU thanks to its bulk and typing, which allow it to set up Spikes reliably throughout the match. Mono-Poison typing gives it great resistances to Bug, Poison, Grass, and Fighting, allowing it to check common threats such as Scyther, Skuntank, Hariyama, Hitmonchan, Lilligant, and Primeape. Garbodor is one of the very few defensive pokemon in the tier able to beat standard Mega Audino variants. With its all-around natural bulk, Garbodor easily survives repeated hits while chipping away at the foe's health via Rocky Helmet damage. It also has a great ability in Aftermath, which can severely weaken or take out physical attackers such as Tauros, Kangaskhan, Zangoose, Samurott, Klinklang, and Liepard if they knock Garbodor out with a contact move. Garbodor also has a diverse movepool, including moves such as Focus Blast, Thunderbolt, Seed Bomb, and Psychic, which can allow it to surprise various checks such as Steelix, Aggron, Pelipper, Rhydon, Piloswine, Weezing, and Gastrodon. Unfortunately its typing also gives it vulnerability to common Ground-type coverage, as well as a weakness to Psychic. A lack of reliable recovery means Garbodor can get worn down really quickly, often leaving it unable to do its job of checking physical attackers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Garbodor has a wide special movepool with moves such as Thunderbolt to punish Pelipper and Mantine; Giga Drain to have recovery while doing hefty damage to Water- and Ground-types; Psychic for coverage against Poison-types such as Vileplume, Weezing, and opposing Garbodor; and Focus Blast to hit Ferroseed and Steelix harder. Haze is an option that allows Garbodor to reset the boosts of setup sweepers, as well as Steel-types such as Klinklang and even Pokemon behind a Substitute. Rock Polish can allow Garbodor to set up and sweep, as it has decent Attack and Speed stats. It also has plenty of coverage to pick what it can beat, which can make it a surprisingly solid late-game cleaner. With a Shuca Berry, Garbodor can lure in Pokemon such as Rhydon and Steelix and hit them with Giga Drain and Focus Blast, respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu is the bane of Garbodor, reflecting back any entry hazards it might attempt to set with Magic Bounce. Xatu can also comfortably switch into defensive Garbodor, fearing nothing besides the potential to be afflicted with poison from Gunk Shot. However, Xatu must be wary of switching into offensive Garbodor, which can cleanly 2HKO it with Gunk Shot.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Mesprit, Musharna, and Jynx threaten to KO or heavily damage Garbodor with a STAB Psychic. Mesprit and Musharna have the bulk to take a hit or two if necessary, but Jynx can only revenge kill Garbodor or put it to sleep with Lovely Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Steelix is able to switch into all of Garbodor's moves bar Focus Blast with little issue and is not affected by Toxic Spikes. While most bulky Ground-types such as Rhydon, Sandslash, Gastrodon, and Camerupt can switch into Garbodor quite easily, all of them except Camerupt are hit hard by Seed Bomb, and none of them appreciate being poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Pokemon such as Magmortar, Pyroar and Samurott can threaten Garbodor out with a powerful STAB move, leaving it very weak for the rest of the match. However, none of them can switch into offensive Garbodor, as Garbodor 2HKOes Samurott while outspeeding it and can OHKO Magmortar and Pyroar after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Archeops, Mismagius, and Haunter all outspeed any variant of Garbodor and prevent it from setting up Spikes while resisting its STAB move. Haunter also doesn't fear being poisoned by Gunk Shot.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes wears down grounded Pokemon with residual damage very quickly. Toxic Spikes helps wear down bulky, defensive teams much faster, as they usually have a method of recovery to mitigate the damage of Spikes alone. Gunk Shot hits anything that does not resist it relatively hard, is boosted by STAB, and has a chance to poison Xatu, preventing it from repeatedly switching in and bouncing back the entry hazards that Garbodor tries to set. Seed Bomb targets common Pokemon that resist Gunk Shot, including Gastrodon, Claydol, Rhydon, Omastar, and Kabutops Drain Punch is an option that can help give Garbodor some passive recovery as well as a method of hitting Steel-types such as Klinklang, Ferroseed, Aggron, and Steelix; however, it is quite weak, especially against the latter. Focus Blast is an alternative option that lets Garbodor hit Steelix and Aggron significantly harder while maintaining coverage on Rock-, Steel-, and Ice-types by hitting them on their often weaker Special Defense stat. Rock Blast is another option to deal with Scyther much more easily while also hitting Xatu and other Flying-types reliably on the switch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>56 Speed EVs let Garbodor outrun maximum Speed Mega Audino, Aggron, and Jolly Rhydon. Alternatively, 96 Speed EVs can be used to outpace neutral-natured fully invested base 55 Speed Pokemon, such as Cacturne, Exeggutor, and Omastar. Maximum HP investment increases Garbodor's overall bulk. The remaining EVs are put into Defense with an Impish nature to maintain Garbodor's high physical bulk and punish users of physical contact moves, such as Samurott, Scyther, and Hitmonchan. Aftermath helps Garbodor check physical attackers that rely on contact moves. Rocky Helmet inflicts chip damage, which discourages spinners from removing entry hazards unless they want to take a lot of recoil damage and chips away at physical attackers in general. Black Sludge can be used instead to give Garbodor some passive recovery and increase its longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Garbodor should set either entry hazard depending on the opposing team. If the team relies on their bulk to check Pokemon, Spikes can wear them down quickly; however, teams that have no way to get rid of status or a team without a Poison-type will hate Toxic Spikes, as it wears the opposing Pokemon down with consistent passive damage. Only use Drain Punch on frail threats such as Liepard, as bulky Rock-, and Steel-types such as Steelix, Regirock, and Rhydon can easily take it and setting a layer of Spikes or Toxic Spikes is more beneficial against them. Similarly, it is much more constructive for Garbodor to be setting down Spikes rather than using Seed Bomb on bulky targets such as Aurorus and Regirock most of the time. Garbodor can pivot into contact moves such as Kangaskhan's Fake Out, Hariyama's Bullet Punch, and Hitmonchan's Drain Punch in order to rack up Rocky Helmet damage; however, be wary, as many physical attackers carry Earthquake as coverage to hit Garbodor while also avoiding Rocky Helmet and Aftermath recoil. Use Gunk Shot on predicted switches to entry hazard removers such as Xatu, Pelipper, and Mantine, as it is Garbodor's strongest move against them. Finally, if Garbodor's HP is low and it has done its job, you can sacrifice it to a Pokemon using a contact move, such as a weakened spinner, to deal massive recoil via Rocky Helmet and Aftermath to the attacker and prevent the entry hazards from being removed if the spinner faints.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steelix is a great partner, as it completes an entry hazard setting core, with Steelix being able to shut down Psychic-types that trouble Garbodor, particularly Mesprit and Musharna, and Garbodor switching in on Fighting-type attacks aimed at Steelix. Ghost-types are good partners, as they can spinblock. Rotom can provide momentum with Volt Switch, and Mismagius can prevent Defog as well thanks to Taunt, while they can both switch into Ground-type attacks for Garbodor. Dark-types, such as Liepard, can take on the Ghost- and Psychic-types that resist Garbodor's attacks. Liepard is a particularly good partner with its ability to Pursuit trap Xatu, allowing Garbodor to have an easier time setting up entry hazards. Liepard also appreciates a bulky Pokemon that resists Fighting-type moves to fall back on. Water-types such as Samurott, Floatzel, and Poliwrath can destroy the Rock- and Ground-types that can stop Garbodor, while Garbodor can handle some Grass-types such as Lilligant, Shiftry, and Cacturne. Psychic-types such as Musharna, Mesprit, and Xatu can force opposing Poison-types out.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes wears down grounded Pokemon, which is nice because Garbodor can force a lot of switches. Gunk Shot hits really hard with investment in Attack, always getting the 2HKO on Pokemon such as bulky Xatu, Hitmonchan, Mantine, and Mega Audino. Drain Punch allows Garbodor to some Steel-types, such as Klinklang and Pawniard, while gaining a decent amount of HP. However, Focus Blast, while less reliable, hits Steelix, Ferroseed, Aggron, and Regirock much harder. Seed Bomb, with the investment, can secure 2HKOs on Gastrodon and Rhydon while denting Claydol significantly, which otherwise can force Garbodor out with their Ground-type STAB moves. Explosion is useful to block Rapid Spin and Defog and can hit spinners such as Claydol extremely hard. Toxic Spikes is also a nice option to pressure more defensively oriented teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs allow Garbodor to outspeed neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon, such as Samurott and Ludicolo, as well as Hasty Abomasnow. A Jolly nature lets Garbodor outspeed defensive Xatu, which is extremely useful, as it can 2HKO with Gunk Shot and proceed to get hazards up. This nature also lets Garbodor outspeed Magmortar, Modest Mesprit, Adamant Kabutops and Lonely Shiftry. Alternatively, an Adamant nature further increases Garbodor's power, allowing it to hit Pokemon such as Xatu and Rhydon extremely hard. Aftermath allows Garbodor to check physical attackers, such as Klinklang and Hariyama. Rocky Helmet inflicts chip damage to punish physical attackers. Life Orb is an option to significantly increase damage output, letting Garbodor force many switches. Poison Barb can be used to avoid Life Orb's recoil while still dealing huge amounts of damage with Gunk Shot. Alternatively, Garbodor can utilize a specially offensive set consisting of moves including Gunk Shot, Giga Drain, Focus Blast, Thunderbolt, and Psychic to lure in specific checks and eliminate them with its wide coverage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Garbodor can be more lenient with its choice of moves because, with the Attack investment, it can surprise common checks such as Rhydon and Gastrodon. Garbodor can lure in and beat the common Pokemon that can either spin away or block entry hazards, such as Xatu, Mantine, and Pelipper, more reliably with the offensive investment. 252 Speed EVs allow Garbodor to outspeed a lot more Pokemon, giving it the ability to set up Spikes on more targets. This set can be a useful pivot on offensively oriented teams, as it has solid natural bulk, a good defensive typing, and power to hit spinners and Defoggers that may give offensive teams trouble, particularly Xatu. Common physical attackers that Garbodor gets chip damage on, such as Kangaskhan and Hariyama, may opt to use Earthquake, bypassing Aftermath and Rocky Helmet; however, offensive Garbodor can 2HKO both. If Garbodor is low on health and it has done its job, this set still works as an emergency check to a powerful physical attacker, inflicting around 41% to the foe with Rocky Helmet and Aftermath damage. Garbodor should use Explosion against Pokemon such as Pelipper, Mantine, Prinplup, and Skuntank to block their Defog.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is more useful on bulky offense teams, as it can keep up the offensive pressure while still laying down entry hazards effectively. Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Floatzel, Tauros, and Archeops appreciate their checks being worn down so that they can continue to pressure the opponent. Volt Switch and U-turn users, such as Scyther, Mesprit, and Manectric, appreciate the entry hazards, as they tend to force a lot of switches and can keep up offensive pressure while their own checks get worn down. Pokemon with Defiant, such as Primeape, can deter Defoggers from getting rid of your entry hazards, while Malamar can actually increase its evasion thanks to Contrary. Spinblockers such as Rotom and Mismagius can also keep entry hazards up as well as provide a Ground immunity for Garbodor and threaten out Psychic-types. Furthermore, these Ghost-types can take advantage of the Toxic Spikes Garbodor spreads to launch full-powered Hexes straight away.</p>"

  "Duosion": {
    "overview": "<p>While often less favored over Musharna, Duosion sets itself apart through Magic Guard, preventing it from being hindered by Toxic and other forms of residual damage, unlike other Calm Mind users. As opposed to Musharna, Duosion's recovery is not hindered by weather conditions such as rain and hail and has more PP, allowing it to set up for a longer period of time. Said characteristics with the combination of Calm Mind and Acid Armor make Duosion very difficult to take down, causing it to be a terror against more balance- or defensively-inclined teams. Duosion is also less passive compared to most Calm Mind users thanks to its naturally high Special Attack stat, being able to hit fairly hard after a boost or two. However, reliance on Eviolite plus its pure Psychic typing means that it's more vulnerable to Knock Off than most Pokemon. The Pursuit weakness only makes matters worse when it's matched up against Skuntank in particular, which is able to shut down Duosion with Taunt as well. Duosion also faces competition from other Psychic-types, particularly Musharna and Xatu, as the former has much greater bulk before setting up, has access to Stored Power, and is not nearly as weak to Knock Off, while the latter has Magic Bounce, which provides pseudo-hazard control.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Signal Beam can be used to hit Dark-types such as Malamar, Liepard, and Shiftry on the switch, but it is generally inferior to Acid Armor because Duosion cannot afford to stay in against any of these Pokemon. Psychic is an alternative STAB move that lets Duosion beat Quagsire and break through Steelix more quickly, but it is otherwise inferior to Psyshock. Thunder Wave cripples some of Duosion's checks upon their switch in exchange for Acid Armor or an extra coverage move. Magic Coat has use in reflecting Taunt and other various status moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Skuntank, Liepard, Shiftry, and Malamar all significantly threaten Duosion, as Duosion has no way to hit them unless it is running the suboptimal Signal Beam. Skuntank and Liepard get special mentions, as both are capable of trapping Duosion with Pursuit and shutting it down with Taunt and Encore, respectively. Malamar is able to use Duosion as setup fodder and threatens to remove its item with Knock Off. However, non-Swords Dance Life Orb Shiftry can lose due to Acid Armor letting Duosion take repeated hits, causing Shiftry to slowly be worn down by Life Orb recoil.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt from the likes of Skuntank, Mismagius, and Steelix can stop Duosion from setting up and restoring lost HP with Recover. However, Mismagius should be wary, as an unboosted Psyshock deals a significant amount of damage, making it a less reliable check than the other two.</p> <p><strong>Eviolite Removal</strong>: Duosion relies on its Eviolite in order to take hits from Pokemon it could not face otherwise and use them as setup bait. Knock Off from the likes of Shiftry, Malamar, Liepard, and even less common users such as Mega Audino and Clefairy works well in crippling Duosion. Trick from the likes of Rotom, Mesprit, and Jynx is even more effective, as Duosion cannot stand being locked into a move by Choice items.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Rotom, Mismagius, and Haunter all threaten Duosion with their respective STAB moves, while Duosion needs a significant amount of boosts to take their hits. The first two are particularly annoying because Duosion takes a hefty amount of damage from Hex if it has been inflicted with status. However, none of these Pokemon are safe switch-ins because Psyshock, especially when boosted by Calm Mind, hits them incredibly hard, if not taking them down outright.</p> <p><strong>Quagsire</strong>: Due to Unaware, Quagsire ignores any stat boosts Duosion has attained and takes little from Psyshock. Quagsire can use Curse to set up on Duosion and eventually take it down, though without Curse, Quagsire is at risk of being PP stalled.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Keeping Duosion from setting up too many boosts by bringing in Pokemon that can deal significant damage against an unboosted Duosion such as Tauros, Kangaskhan, Archeops, and Choice Band Scyther is also a decent approach at stopping it from sweeping, though in the long run Duosion can outlast all of these Pokemon if it manages to set up against a Pokemon that cannot do much in return.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Acid Armor + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind allows Duosion to simultaneously boost its Special Attack and Special Defense, making it even harder to take down. Psyshock is Duosion's best STAB option, as it allows it to break through other Calm Mind users such as Audino, Xatu, and non-Barrier Musharna. Acid Armor makes Duosion incredibly difficult to break through with physical attacks, ensuring it can set up against the likes of Steelix, Tauros, Kangaskhan, Kabutops, and Archeops, as well as ensure it wins Calm Mind wars against other Psyshock users. Recover keeps Duosion healthy so that it can keep setting up throughout the match.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread plus a Bold nature maximizes Duosion's physical bulk, allowing it to set up Calm Mind more comfortably on physical attackers. The 4 remaining EVs are put into Speed to allow Duosion to outspeed uninvested Steelix. Eviolite increases its defenses even further, making more difficult to take down. Magic Guard is key, as it gives Duosion an immunity to entry hazards and other forms of residual damage, most notably Toxic, which ensures it cannot be shut down as it sets up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Duosion should steer clear of setting up if Dark-types are present on the opponent's team, as it has no ways of dealing damage to them. It should also be used as more of a late-game cleaner, as it has little impact early on the match, especially with Pokemon that resist Psychic being healthy. Once its checks and counters are eliminated, initiate Duosion's sweep by using the appropriate boosting move, depending on what it's up against. However, do not get greedy with setting up Calm Mind or Acid Armor unless it's necessary, as the longer Duosion spends setting up, the more likely it is to be struck by an untimely critical hit, ending its sweep prematurely. Thanks to Magic Guard, Duosion can serve as a status absorber, making it a good switch-in to Scald and Toxic in particular, though avoid the likes of Hex Rotom or Mismagius, as it can deal significant damage against an unboosted Duosion inflicted with burn. Recover should be used if Duosion's HP is getting too low, but be wary of doing this if the opponent has a Pursuit trapper such as Skuntank or Liepard, as they can put Duosion in an awkward spot. Try to avoid Knock Off at all costs, even weaker ones from the likes of Mega Audino and Clefairy, as Duosion loses a fair sum of its bulk once its Eviolite is removed, making it difficult to set up. When matched up against a potential Pursuit trapper such as Skuntank or Liepard, make double switches to teammates that threaten those two, as Duosion has no other way of dealing with them once they switch in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types such as Primeape, Throh, and Hitmonchan are able to switch in on and take down problematic Dark-types that would otherwise end Duosion's sweep. In return, Duosion can switch in on the likes of Garbodor, Weezing, and Vileplume and threaten them with Psyshock. Toxic Spikes is devastating for the opponent, as it lets Duosion stall out Pokemon as it's setting up. Weezing and Garbodor are two notable examples, as both of them are able to soft check the likes of Shiftry, Skuntank, and Liepard, with the former crippling them with Will-O-Wisp and the latter wearing them with Rocky Helmet in conjunction with Aftermath. Mega Audino serves as a great Knock Off absorber, since it is able to switch in on the likes of Shiftry and Liepard with impunity once Mega Evolved. In exchange, Duosion absorbs Toxic for non-Heal Bell or Rest variants of Mega Audino and breaks past Poison-types, as well as slowly wearing down Steel-types, both of which are troublesome for Mega Audino. However, Duosion and Mega Audino are vulnerable to Skuntank, so make sure to pair them with solid response to it such as Rhydon or Steelix.</p> <p>Scyther threatens Skuntank, Shiftry, and Malamar with U-turn, while Duosion can break past the likes of Garbodor, Weezing, and Steelix, all of which prevent Scyther from sweeping with Swords Dance. Rotom is able to check opposing Scyther and burn Pokemon that switch in on it such as Shiftry, Skuntank, and Liepard. Rotom also switches in on Steelix and wears it down with the combination of Will-O-Wisp and Hex, speeding up the process for Duosion to break past it. In general, any Pokemon that uses Will-O-Wisp and doesn't come with clashing synergy works well, as Duosion appreciates the ease of setting up against burned physical attackers. Steelix, Rhydon, and Regirock are all able to freely switch in on Scyther and Pursuit Skuntank, as well as set up Stealth Rock, which is very helpful when combined with Duosion's tendency to force switches as it's setting up. Skuntank is also a good teammate as it can pursuit trap the Ghost-types which greatly threaten an unboosted Duosion.</p>"

  "Sawsbuck": {
    "overview": "<p>Sawsbuck distinguishes itself from other Grass-types in the tier thanks to its secondary Normal typing and Sap Sipper ability. With a relatively high Speed tier, Sawsbuck handles base 90 Speed Pokemon and below such as Lilligant, Vivillon, Zangoose, and Rotom while also Speed tying with base 95 Speed Pokemon, including Jynx, Primeape, Haunter, and Leafeon. Sawsbuck also serves as a fantastic offensive check to Rotom due to its immunity to Ghost and resistance to Electric. Moreover, with access to Swords Dance coupled with a high-powered STAB move in Double-Edge and the health-replenishing Horn Leech, Sawsbuck becomes a devastating late-game sweeper. Unfortunately, a combination of frailty and six weaknesses to common attacking types leaves Sawsbuck vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Archeops, Tauros, Charizard, and Scyther. Furthermore, before Sawsbuck can sweep, all defensive Steel- and Poison-types such as Ferroseed, Steelix, Garbodor, Vileplume, and Weezing must be weakened, as it is unable to deal substantial damage to them without a Swords Dance boost.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sawsbuck can run an effective double dance set with both Agility and Swords Dance, giving it ways of dealing with balanced and offensive teams alike. Substitute + Salac Berry can be used to take advantage of Sap Sipper boosts and turn Sawsbuck into a devastating sweeper that is hard to revenge kill. Furthermore, Sawsbuck can run a decent Chlorophyll set, breaking past traditional sun counters such as Hariyama and Magmortar. Finally, Sawsbuck can choose to run Toxic in its last moveslot specifically for Gourgeist-XL, but it comes at the cost of vital coverage against Steel-types or the ability to protect itself from status with Substitute, and Gourgeist-XL is not common enough to warrant this.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gourgeist-XL</strong>: Gourgeist-XL is the hardest counter to Sawsbuck in the tier, being immune or resistant to every move it has while also having recovery in Synthesis to consistently check it throughout the match. Gourgeist can also cripple Sawsbuck with Will-O-Wisp or deal heavy amounts of damage to it with Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Bulky Poison-types such as Garbodor, Weezing, and Vileplume can comfortably switch into any of Sawsbuck's moves and OHKO it with either Gunk Shot or Sludge Bomb. Furthermore, Vileplume and Garbodor both punish Sawsbuck for using contact moves due to Effect Spore and Rocky Helmet recoil coupled with Aftermath damage, respectively. Moreover, while Haunter does not enjoy switching into Horn Leech, it fears nothing else in Sawsbuck's arsenal and can OHKO with Sludge Bomb at the risk of a Speed tie. It is worth noting, however, that after a Swords Dance boost, these bulky Poison-types are no longer able to reliably check Sawsbuck without the risk of being OHKOed by a +2 Double-Edge.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Steelix, Mawile, and Ferroseed are extremely safe switch-ins to Sawsbuck, taking minimal damage from any of its moves. However, Ferroseed must be wary, as Sawsbuck has the potential to OHKO it with Jump Kick after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Archeops, Scyther, Swellow, and Charizard all outspeed Sawsbuck and can OHKO it with the appropriate move. Moreover, Charizard and Scyther can both switch into Horn Leech, although Charizard gets OHKOed by Double-Edge after a turn of Life Orb recoil, and Scyther is unable to switch in with Stealth Rock up.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Although Sawsbuck is reasonably fast, it can still be revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Pyroar, Tauros, Floatzel, Manectric, Choice Scarf Jynx, and Choice Scarf Primeape. In addition to this, Sawsbuck can be picked off through strong priority such as Hitmonchan's Mach Punch, Abomasnow's and Piloswine's Ice Shard, and Shiftry's Sucker Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Sawsbuck's Attack by two stages, letting it tear through defensive Pokemon such as Mega Audino, Musharna, and Miltank. Horn Leech is a decently strong STAB move that heals for 50% of the damage dealt and helps alleviate Life Orb recoil. Double-Edge is a hard-hitting Normal-type STAB move that targets Pokemon resistant to Horn Leech, particularly Poison-types such as Vileplume, Garbodor, and Weezing, as well as Fire-, Flying-, and Bug-types such as Magmortar, Xatu, Pinsir, and Vivillon. Jump Kick rounds out Sawsbuck's coverage, letting it hit Steel-types such as Ferroseed, Steelix, Klinklang, and Aggron extremely hard. Substitute can be run to protect Sawsbuck from status and let it set up on Rotom, defensive Omastar, defensive Lanturn, and Gastrodon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sawsbuck runs a standard offensive EV spread to ensure it can outspeed as many Pokemon as possible while also hitting as hard as possible. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed base 90 Speed Pokemon and below such as Lilligant, Rotom, Vivillon, Pinsir, and Zangoose; however, an Adamant nature can ensure cleaner KOs against Vileplume, Weezing, Ferroseed, and Musharna. Life Orb is used to dramatically increase Sawsbuck's damage output, and it works well in tandem with Horn Leech's recovery. Sawsbuck can viably hold a Lum Berry to shield itself from random status from moves such as Miltank's Thunder Wave, Rotom's Will-O-Wisp, and Smeargle's Dark Void. Sap Sipper allows Sawsbuck to get an Attack boost when hit by a Grass-type move, allowing it to pivot into Pokemon such as Lilligant, Torterra, and Cradily, as well as Vivillon's Sleep Powder.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sawsbuck functions best as a mid- or late-game sweeper that can break teams apart with a Swords Dance boost and good coverage. Thanks to its monstrous STAB Double-Edge, Sawsbuck can break past traditional Grass-type checks such as Weezing and Vileplume after a Swords Dance boost. However, it is better for Sawsbuck to set up for a sweep after its checks and counters such as Ferroseed, Steelix, Garbodor, and Weezing have been weakened to avoid risking close damage rolls. When switching into Grass-type attacks, be cautious, as if the switch is too obvious it can result in Sawsbuck taking a Sludge Bomb from Vileplume or a Hurricane from Vivillon, which it will not survive.  Bring Sawsbuck in on Pokemon that it can comfortably set up on, particularly bulky Water- and Ground-types such as Gastrodon, Carracosta, and Rhydon, as they get forced out by the threat of its STAB Horn Leech. Sawsbuck can also set up on passive Pokemon such as Mega Audino and Clefairy, as it can heal off any damage they might inflict with Horn Leech, although it should be wary of being crippled by Thunder Wave from the latter. Finally, Sawsbuck should set up a Substitute when possible to prevent itself from being revenge killed by strong priority such as Hitmonchan's Mach Punch or faster Pokemon such as Archeops, as well as shielding itself against status moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards are very useful for Sawsbuck, as they can make the difference between an OHKO and 2HKO; for example, after a Swords Dance boost and Stealth Rock Sawsbuck can OHKO Vileplume, Weezing, and Ferroseed with Double-Edge and Jump Kick, respectively. Fire-types such as Magmortar, Pyroar, and Combusken are also great partners, as they can KO the Grass- and Poison-type Pokemon that annoy Sawsbuck, while in return they can deal with Water-types such as Gastrodon, Samurott, and Kabutops. Psychic-types such as Xatu, Mesprit, and Musharna make fantastic partners, as they can eliminate any Poison-types standing in Sawsbuck's way and also provide a Fighting-type resistance. Mesprit in particular is a great partner, as the Choice Specs set can break down of all Sawsbuck's checks and the physically defensive set can pivot into Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan, as well as spread paralysis with Thunder Wave and set up Stealth Rock. Additionally, revenge killers such as Archeops, Floatzel, and Choice Scarf Jynx are fantastic partners that can clean up after Sawsbuck's sweep has been ended. Water-types such as Samurott, Poliwrath, and Floatzel appreciate Sawsbuck's ability to pivot into Grass-type attacks for them, and in return they can handle faster Fire-types such as Pyroar and Combusken that Sawsbuck struggles with. In Floatzel's case, it can revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Archeops, Pyroar, Charizard and Tauros.</p>"

  "Frillish": {
    "overview": "<p>Frillish's excellent defensive typing and access to Recover differentiate it from the otherwise superior Misdreavus and make it a decent spinblocker for stall teams and bulky balanced teams. Unlike Gourgeist-XL, Frillish lacks weaknesses to common coverage moves from the likes of Samurott, Hitmonchan, and Tauros, making it more reliable at dealing with these threats alongside others including Barbaracle and Klinklang. Water Absorb is particularly nice, as it lets Frillish switch into Scald with impunity and makes it a good response to physical Water-types even if they have already accrued several boosts. Meanwhile, access to Will-O-Wisp differentiates it from other Water-types, letting it more reliably cripple physical attackers, while Night Shade and Taunt prevent Frillish from being too passive despite its poor Special Attack. However, its reliance on Eviolite and weakness to Knock Off is crippling, making it vulnerable to Pokemon such as Shiftry, Hariyama, and even Sandslash, which all either beat Frillish or make it easier for a teammate to take down later. Furthermore, Frillish's low Speed stops Taunt from preventing one-turn setup sweepers such as Ludicolo and Vivillon from taking advantage of it, and faster Toxic users such as Mantine can also exploit this flaw. Finally, despite good special bulk, Frillish struggles with strong Electric- and Grass-types, such as Manectric, Abomasnow, and Shiftry, as well as other Ghost-types such as Haunter and Mismagius.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is a good option for letting Frillish stall out bulky targets such as Mega Audino and Musharna more reliably, especially in combination with Taunt and Recover. Hex does decent damage against statused targets, but Night Shade is usually more consistent in other situations, although Hex can work particularly well on teams that use Toxic Spikes. Frillish has an expansive offensive movepool including options such as Water Spout, Ice Beam, Energy Ball, and Dazzling Gleam, but it can't afford to invest in Special Attack, making these moves too weak in general to justify moveslots for. This coverage also isn't generally useful for stall teams in the first place. Magic Coat can be used over Taunt to better deal with other Taunt users, but it's generally less useful than being able to restrict the foe's options with a Taunt of your own. It also bounces back status and entry hazards, which can be useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick</strong>: Frillish is easily dealt with once its Eviolite has been removed by Knock Off, Trick, and other similar moves. This allows Pokemon such as Hariyama, Zangoose, and Sandslash that would normally struggle with it to either break through it or make it much easier for teammates to take down. More passive Pokemon such as Clefairy, Ferroseed, and Mega Audino can also cripple Frillish with Knock Off at little risk. Meanwhile, Choice Scarf Jynx can cripple Frillish with Trick, and Choice Scarf Barbaracle can lure it and neuter it effectively with Switcheroo.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Liepard, Malamar, and Shiftry obviously hit Frillish very hard with Knock Off, but Skuntank can also threaten it, using Taunt and a Lum Berry to prevent any chance of being burned (unless Frillish runs Scald) and either dealing heavy damage with Sucker Punch or Crunch if it tries to go for an attack or crippling it with Pursuit if it tries to switch.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Faster Taunt users such as Mismagius, Weezing, and Skuntank can prevent Frillish from using Recover or its other non-attacking moves, neutralizing it as a threat. While Night Shade can still deal moderate damage to these Pokemon, a Normal-type such as Zangoose can easily switch into it and proceed to set up or take Frillish down with a coverage move or pound a switch-in with a STAB attack. However, most of these Pokemon fear a potential burn as they switch in.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective STAB Attacks</strong>: While Frillish has impressive uninvested special bulk, it still takes heavy damage from the likes of Manectric, Lilligant, and Shiftry, with the latter also being able to threaten it with Knock Off. However, Frillish can generally use Recover to shrug off Volt Switches from the likes of defensive Lanturn and Choice Scarf Rotom, although it must watch out for Trick from the latter. Furthermore, as Frillish is slow and usually runs Night Shade over a STAB attack, it can't deal with other Ghost-types very effectively. Haunter and Mismagius can force Frillish out with their main attacking moves, while Rotom can threaten Frillish with its STAB Electric- or Ghost-type attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp cripples a large section of the metagame, particularly physical attackers such as Tauros and Hitmonchan that Frillish likes to switch into, but also Dark-types such as Liepard and Shiftry that might try to come in and remove Frillish's Eviolite with Knock Off. Night Shade provides consistent damage against non-Normal-types and makes up for Frillish's low offensive potential, being strong enough to break most Substitutes. Scald is weaker in general, but it provides a better matchup against specific targets like Rhydon and Pyroar. It also lets Frillish potentially burn targets while Taunted, so it's not completely redundant in combination with Will-O-Wisp. Recover lets Frillish wall threats such as Archeops, Kangaskhan, Swellow, and Rhydon indefinitely and keep itself healthy throughout the match as it forces switches, and it is much more useful than Pain Split, the recovery option that rival Ghost-types such as Rotom and Mismagius are forced to use. Taunt can stop switch-ins that might try to set up or inflict status on Frillish, and also cripples slow targets such as Steelix, Gastrodon, Ferroseed, and Musharna, preventing them from doing anything threatening to Frillish or its team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum physical bulk makes the most of Frillish's defensive typing and access to Will-O-Wisp, allowing it to take on powerful attackers such as Samurott and Tauros without many issues. Frillish's good special bulk doesn't require any investment to be useful, as most special attackers either are walled regardless (such as Pyroar and Combusken) or do too much damage to Frillish in the first place (such as Rotom and Lilligant), and the extra physical bulk is much preferred. Eviolite gives Frillish the overall bulk it needs to wall threats and be effective compared to fully evolved Ghost-types such as Rotom and Gourgeist-XL. Water Absorb is highly useful for letting Frillish switch into Scald for free and dealing with powerful Water-types such as Samurott and Barbaracle more effectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Frillish is generally best suited to stall teams, where its somewhat passive nature is less detrimental and it can receive consistent anti-status support from its teammates. However, it can also work on certain balanced builds that require a spinblocker with extreme longevity. Frillish can switch into common Rapid Spin users such as Hitmonchan and Kabutops with few issues, and use Recover after it forces them to switch out, conserving its health for later much more consistently than rivals such as Rotom, Mismagius, and Misdreavus. Will-O-Wisp can be used if Frillish is healthy to cripple switch-ins such as Abomasnow and Shiftry or just to wear down bulky targets such as Miltank and Mega Audino, as well as other Normal-types such as Tauros and Kangaskhan if they choose to stay in. Night Shade can deal chip damage against foes that stay in after being burned, making it easier to stall them out in combination with Recover. Frillish makes a good switch-in to most Water-types due to its immunity to Scald, but it should watch out for moves such as Volt Switch from Lanturn and Toxic from Mantine and Gastrodon. Frillish can use Taunt freely against slower foes such as Steelix, Gastrodon, and defensive Rhydon, and it can also hit faster threats with the move if they attempt to switch in. This can prevent a situation like Weezing laying Toxic Spikes after Frillish is forced out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard stackers greatly appreciate Frillish's ability to consistently block Rapid Spin. Garbodor and Roselia can set Spikes or Toxic Spikes while also absorbing the opposing team's Toxic Spikes to prevent Frillish from being poisoned. Steel- and Rock-types such as Steelix, Ferroseed, and Rhydon can set Stealth Rock consistently and greatly appreciate Frillish's immunities and resistances to Fighting-, Fire-, and Water-type attacks. Frillish is very vulnerable to status and greatly appreciates Heal Bell support. Miltank and Mega Audino are great options due to their immunity to Ghost-type attacks, general ability to handle Knock Off, and other valuable attributes; Mega Audino's immunity to Trick is particularly valuable. Skuntank can absorb Toxic Spikes while also Pursuit trapping Xatu, which is a large threat to stall teams that can wall Frillish effortlessly between Magic Bounce and Roost. Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Hitmonchan can deal with Dark-types such as Liepard and Shiftry that threaten Frillish with Knock Off, being able to switch into the move if required and dealing heavy damage back. Throh is particularly bulky and doesn't mind losing its item while shuffling teams with Circle Throw to spread damage from the entry hazards that Frillish spinblocks for.</p>"

  "Ferroseed": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferroseed has a unique defensive typing that gives it nine resistances and one immunity, as well as Eviolite-boosted defenses to complement them, allowing it to check a multitude of threats in NU such as Samurott, Kabutops, and Ludicolo. Ferroseed also serves as a reliable entry hazard setter thanks to its typing and access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock. Ferroseed's ability, Iron Barbs, allows it to punish physical attackers such as Scyther and Barbaracle. Its low Speed also works in its favor, powering up Gyro Ball against fast threats. However, Ferroseed has a crippling 4x weakness to common Fire-type moves as well as a 2x weakness to Fighting. Both of these weaknesses make Ferroseed easy to lure, as many Pokemon have access to Fire- and Fighting-type coverage. Ferroseed also relies on Leech Seed to recover from damage, which hinders its walling capabilities. Its STAB types are also commonly resisted, allowing many Pokemon to take advantage of it, most notably Substitute users.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Seed Bomb and Bullet Seed are alternatives to hit Water-types such as Kabutops, Carracosta, and Samurott, but generally this leaves Ferroseed as setup bait for many Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu switches in on any of Ferroseed's attacks and bounces back any entry hazard-setting attempt, while in return Xatu threatens Ferroseed with Heat Wave. Xatu also uses Ferroseed as setup bait, setting up Calm Mind with impunity.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Magmortar and Pyroar all force out Ferroseed with their STAB moves and resist both Gyro Ball and Seed Bomb, though neither appreciates being crippled by Thunder Wave or being worn down by Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as Mismagius and Samurott cripple Ferroseed by preventing it from setting up entry hazards, using Leech Seed, and crippling Pokemon with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Primeape, Hitmonchan, and Hariyama threaten Ferroseed with their STAB moves, while the latter can also weaken it by removing its Eviolite with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Many Pokemon that Ferroseed would normally wall such as special Samurott, Mesprit, and Exeggutor lure in Ferroseed and 2HKO it with Hidden Power Fire. Other Pokemon such as Jynx, Floatzel, and Ludicolo can all use Focus Blast to easily eliminate Ferroseed.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute blocks Leech Seed and status and because of Ferroseed's weak offensive presence, it cannot break through many Pokemon's Substitute. Klinklang takes very little damage from Ferroseed's attacks and sets up indefinitely.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes gets chip damage against any grounded Pokemon that switches in. Stealth Rock is an alternative if no other teammate carries the move. Gyro Ball, combined with Ferroseed's abysmal Speed that ensures that it is almost always fully powered, makes up for its lacking offensive presence. Knock Off cripples any switch-ins by removing their item. Leech Seed is Ferroseed's only form of recovery and pressures Pokemon to switch out. Protect, when used along with Leech Seed, lets Ferroseed wear down its foes and recover even more HP, as well as help scout for moves against Choice-locked foes. Thunder Wave cripples fast threats such as Pyroar, Magmortar, and Primeape, but do not use it with Gyro Ball, as lowering the Speed of opposing Pokemon powers down the move. Toxic hits Grass-types and stalls out opponents along with Leech Seed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread increases Ferroseed's physical bulk and allows Ferroseed to avoid the 3HKO from Life Orb Samurott's Ice Beam. A Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs should be used with Gyro Ball to increase its power, but if Knock Off is being run, Impish should be used instead. Eviolite boosts Ferroseed's defenses significantly, making it very hard to take down. A specially defensive spread is an alternative if the team needs a more reliable answer to specially offensive Water- and Grass-types, but this makes Ferroseed less effectively wall physical attackers such as Kangaskhan and Swords Dance Samurott.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Set up either Spikes or Stealth Rock against Pokemon that cannot do much in return, such as Kabutops, Lanturn, and Mawile, or on forced switches. Use Leech Seed to keep Ferroseed healthy and to pressure Pokemon that try to set up. Sometimes it is best to use Leech Seed again expecting a switch to get more HP back and chip damage against the foe. Protect is good for scouting for Pokemon that try to lure Ferroseed, such as Hidden Power Fire Samurott or Superpower Kabutops, and should be used to gain more Leech Seed recovery. Try not to use the move too much, as the opponent will take advantage of that by setting up on the turn Ferroseed uses Protect. Protect also helps against Choice-locked attackers by scouting for what move the Pokemon will lock itself into. If using Thunder Wave, use it to cripple fast Pokemon such as Floatzel and Archeops. Thunder Wave is also useful against rain teams, as Ferroseed is able to switch in on the majority of rain sweepers and slow them down.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Ferroseed's exploitable Fire weakness, it is generally best to pair it up with Water-types such as Lanturn, Prinplup, Quagsire, and Carracosta. All of these Pokemon are able to switch in on Fire-types such as Pyroar and Magmortar and threaten them with their STAB moves. Ferroseed can also run Spikes over Stealth Rock if paired with Carracosta or Prinplup. More offensively inclined Water-types such as Samurott and Kabutops also pair well with Ferroseed, if using it on balance teams. Ground-types such as Stunfisk, Rhydon, and Golurk pair well with Ferroseed, as they have good synergy, with Ferroseed covering their Water- and Grass-type weaknesses. All of these Pokemon are also capable of running Stealth Rock, allowing Ferroseed to run Spikes. Having a Ghost-type such as Mismagius, Rotom, or Haunter to spinblock is also very helpful for Ferroseed. Mismagius can also switch in on Primeape, which easily breaks past Ferroseed with Close Combat. Mismagius and Haunter also have access to Taunt to prevent Pokemon from using Defog. All of these Pokemon also threaten Xatu, which switches in on Ferroseed with impunity. Liepard is another good partner for Ferroseed, as it threatens Xatu with Knock Off and can also Pursuit trap it.</p>"

  "Klinklang": {
    "overview": "<p>Klinklang is NU's premier late-game sweeper thanks to an excellent setup move in Shift Gear, which boosts its Speed by two stages and Attack by one stage. Solid natural bulk with a great defensive typing that gives it many resistances lets it set up on a good majority of the metagame, most notably Calm Mind Psychic-types. While its Speed isn't the greatest before it sets up, after a Shift Gear it outspeeds almost every Pokemon, even the ones with Speed-boosting items. However, Klinklang has a poor early- to mid-game presence due to its Attack being very lacking before a boost. Very limited coverage does not help Klinklang's case either, as it is easily walled by any bulky Pokemon that resists Gear Grind. Its typing also leaves it susceptible to three very common attacking types in Fighting, Fire, and Ground, causing it to struggle to find an opportunity to set up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A more offensive Shift Gear set consisting of Gear Grind / Return / Hidden Power Grass with a Life Orb is another option, as it lures in most answers to Klinklang, but this comes at the cost of sacrificing most of its defensive qualities, making it inferior. Magnetic Flux in conjunction with either Plus or Minus is another option to boost Klinklang's defenses, but doing so forces Klinklang to sacrifice Substitute, making Klinklang vulnerable to status ailments. Volt Switch is an interesting option on Klinklang, as it enables Klinklang to pivot out of unfavorable situations, letting it retain offensive momentum.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steelix</strong>: Steelix's typing plus high physical bulk means that Klinklang cannot break past it with any attack, even when boosted from Shift Gear, making Steelix the most consistent switch in. In return, Steelix hits Klinklang with Earthquake or uses it to freely set up Stealth Rock. However, if Magnet Rise is used, Klinklang can defeat Steelix lacking Roar one on one, albeit taking significant damage in the process.</p> <p><strong>Quagsire</strong>: Due to Unaware, Quagsire can ignore all stat boosts accumulated by Klinklang and freely use it as setup fodder. Furthermore, Quagsire can potentially burn Klinklang with Scald, or simply 2HKO it with a STAB Earthquake, thus crippling it for the rest of the match.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Gurdurr can easily sponge Klinklang's attacks and retaliate with the combination of Drain Punch and Mach Punch. Poliwrath can easily take a Gear Grind and hit Klinklang with Circle Throw or Focus Blast, and can pick off a weakened Klinklang not behind a Substitute with Vacuum Wave. Primeape can also check Klinklang and OHKO it with Close Combat before it uses Shift Gear, but it loses if Klinklang has already boosted.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon that Resist Steel</strong>: Lanturn, Rotom, and Poliwrath all check Klinklang well thanks to their resistance to Gear Grind and good natural bulk, allowing them to take a boosted Return. Lanturn can burn Klinklang with Scald and cripple it with Thunder Wave, while Rotom can burn Klinklang with Will-O-Wisp. Poliwrath can burn Klinklang with Scald as well and phaze it with Circle Throw, and more offensive variants are able to pick off a weakened Klinklang with Vacuum Wave. Poliwrath must be wary of a boosted Wild Charge, however.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Garbodor and Weezing are able to take hits from Klinklang well and break through its Substitute with Drain Punch and Flamethrower, respectively. Weezing is also able to burn Klinklang with Will-O-Wisp, crippling it for the rest of the match. Physically defensive Carracosta is able to take a +1 Gear Grind and retaliate with Scald, possibly burning Klinklang in the process provided that it is not behind a Substitute. Gourgeist-S is another good switch-in, as it takes Gear Grind very well and naturally outspeeds Klinklang before it uses Shift Gear, enabling it to cripple it with Will-O-Wisp before it sets up a Substitute. It also has Foul Play, which punishes any boosts Klinklang has attained and breaks its Substitute.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shift Gear": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shift Gear boosts Klinklang's Speed by two stages and its Attack by one stage, letting Klinklang outspeed a good majority of Pokemon when boosted, making it an essential move for sweeping. Gear Grind is Klinklang's most powerful STAB attack and hits the foe twice, breaking past Substitutes, Sturdy, and Focus Sashes. Return has decent neutral coverage and hits Pokemon that resist Gear Grind such as Lanturn, Pyroar, Samurott, and Ludicolo. Substitute is very important for Klinklang to avoid any crippling status ailments such as burn and paralysis, both of which stop its sweep. Magnet Rise is another option which assists Klinklang in setting up on a lot of common Ground-types, such as Rhydon, Torterra, Claydol, and, most importantly, Steelix. Wild Charge can be used as a coverage option to hit Poliwrath, Pelipper, Mantine, and Prinplup, but this leaves Klinklang walled by Electric-types if used over Return.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs plus an Adamant nature allow Klinklang to hit as hard as possible, while 176 Speed EVs allow Klinklang to outspeed neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon, such as Shiftry and Kabutops. The rest of the EVs go into HP to increase its overall bulk, making it easier to set up. Klinklang can customize its EV spread to outspeed even more Pokemon before a boost; 160 HP / 252 Atk / 96 Spe allows it to outspeed neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon as well as base 95 Speed Choice Scarf users after a boost, while 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe lets it outspeed Adamant Pinsir. Clear Body prevents Klinklang's Attack from being lowered by Intimidate, as well as preventing the Speed drop from Sticky Web. Leftovers is chosen for passive recovery, allowing Klinklang to set up more Substitutes if needed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Generally, it's best to save Klinklang for mid- to late-game when its checks and counters have been sufficiently weakened. Bring in Klinklang against a Pokemon that cannot deal much damage in return, such as Scyther, Mesprit, or non-Heat Wave Xatu. Use Substitute against any predicted status move, against a Pokemon that cannot do much in return, or on forced switches. Substitute is also useful for scouting status moves, Leech Seed, and super effective coverage moves. Once the opposing team is significantly weakened, use Shift Gear to boost Klinklang's damage output, and choose the appropriate move to hit the foe with from there.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-types such as Lilligant, Shiftry, Cacturne, and Vileplume all make for great teammates, as they threaten Water-types that check Klinklang, such as Gastrodon, Lanturn, Poliwrath, and Quagsire. Fire-types, such as Magmortar and Pyroar, can cover the vulnerability to Steelix Klinklang gains when running Substitute instead of Magnet Rise; they are also helpful to block Will-O-Wisps and threaten Ferroseed and Vileplume, which are much easier to handle with Substitute. Additionally, Cacturne provides Spikes support for Klinklang, making it easier to sweep teams, and a useful Water-type immunity, which can cover the non-Substitute variant's weakness to Scald. Life Orb Samurott is a good partner, as it's able to break past several answers to Klinklang such as Steelix and Weezing. Mesprit, Xatu, and Musharna are also great teammates thanks to their ability to threaten Poliwrath, Weezing, and Garbodor. Mesprit in particular has access to Stealth Rock to support Klinklang, as well as U-turn to help bring it in safely, while also having Healing Wish to bring Klinklang back to full HP and rid it of any status conditions. Hex Rotom is an interesting partner, as it lures in Steelix and Lanturn, weakening them significantly for Klinklang. Scyther is able to switch in and threaten Fighting-types, as well as lure in Pokemon that Klinklang can use as setup bait, such as Mawile and Ferroseed. Scyther also has good synergy with Klinklang because of its immunity to Ground and resistance to Fighting and Klinklang's ability to cover Scyther's Ice-, Rock-, and Flying-type weaknesses. Powerful wallbreakers such as Archeops, Aurorus, and Life Orb Magmortar can weaken teams significantly, paving the way for Klinklang to clean late-game. Garbodor is a great partner, as it switches into Fighting-types relatively well and supports Klinklang with Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Toxic Spikes in particular pairs very well with Klinklang because it wears down threats that prevent a Klinklang sweep such as Gastrodon and Barrier Musharna.</p>"

  "Beheeyem": {
    "overview": "<p>Beheeyem's monstrous base 125 Special Attack coupled with Analytic allows it to hit extremely hard. With its respectable bulk, Beheeyem is able to survive a hit and consistently fire off strong Psychic-type attacks. Unfortunately, Beheeyem does not provide much defensive utility to teams and thus faces heavy competition from other Psychic-types such as Musharna, Mesprit, and Jynx. While Beheeyem's typing gives it a useful resistance to Fighting-type attacks, it also leaves it very vulnerable to Dark-types and Knock Off. Furthermore, Beheeyem's low Speed leaves it easily revenge killed by faster wallbreakers such as Samurott, Shiftry, Cacturne, Haunter, and Pinsir, as well as Pursuit trapped by the likes of Skuntank and Liepard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive Trick Room set can be used; however, Beheeyem lacks the bulk and useful resistances to consistently pull it off. Moreover, a set with both Nasty Plot and Recover can be used to demolish stall teams, but it becomes dead weight against offensive teams, and Beheeyem misses the immediate power Choice Specs provides. Colbur Berry is an option that can potentially score Beheeyem an extra KO by allowing it to tank a super effective Dark-type move from the likes of Shiftry, Skuntank, and Liepard. An Assault Vest allows Beheeyem to take neutral special hits decently and adds to its overall longevity. However, the difference in damage output is very noticeable, and Beheeyem will still be forced out by strong Dark-type Pokemon. Finally, a bulky set consisting of Barrier, Calm Mind, Recover, and Psyshock can be used for a surprise factor; however, it is completely walled by Dark-types and is pulled off more effectively by Musharna, which has access to Stored Power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Skuntank, Malamar, Shiftry, Liepard, and Cacturne can all come in unscathed on Psychic and threaten to KO with a STAB Knock Off or Dark Pulse. However, all of them, bar Skuntank, are cleanly KOed by Signal Beam, while Skuntank itself is KOed by Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types such as Steelix and Ferroseed can come in relatively safely on Beheeyem's Psychic-type STAB; however, Steelix fears Hidden Power Ground, and Ferroseed does not appreciate being Tricked.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Scyther and Pinsir can OHKO Beheeyem with their STAB moves or set up a Swords Dance on a forced switch, although neither can switch into Beheeyem's attacks. Bulky Scyther can live a Psychic if it has taken minimal prior damage but must be wary of Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Beheeyem's average physical bulk leaves it vulnerable to being KOed by strong wallbreakers such as Zangoose, Pinsir, Samurott, Archeops, and Shiftry.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is Beheeyem's strongest STAB move, coming off a ridiculous base 125 Special Attack stat. Alternatively, Psyshock can be used, hitting specially bulky Pokemon such as Mantine, Magmortar, Hariyama, and variants of Mega Audino significantly harder while still retaining huge damage output against defensive walls such as Weezing, Vileplume, and Garbodor. Signal Beam targets common Psychic- and Dark-types such as Musharna, Mesprit, Malamar, Shiftry, Grumpig, and Claydol, which may try to switch in. Hidden Power Ground hits Skuntank, as well as common Steel-types such as Steelix, Mawile, and Klinklang, for super effective damage. Trick is used to cripple bulky Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Steelix, and Quagsire while also providing Beheeyem with the ability to switch up its moves. However, Thunderbolt is a viable option, targeting Xatu and Scyther while also being a consistent form of damage output when a Dark-type is on the opposing side.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs, 252 Special Attack EVs, and a Modest nature maximize Beheeyem's power, making it extremely difficult to switch into. 124 Speed EVs are invested to outpace Pokemon with an uninvested base 55 Speed, such as Omastar, as well as other Pokemon around that Speed tier such as Gourgeist-XL and Hariyama. This allows Beheeyem to avoid unwanted status and any unnecessary damage, particularly from Hariyama's Knock Off. Analytic allows Beheeyem to take advantage of its low Speed, hitting faster Pokemon harder, as well as punishing switches.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Beheeyem should be using its Psychic-type STAB most of the time; however, in some cases, using Signal Beam or Hidden Power Ground on a predicted switch-in is necessary. Switch out when a faster threat is ready to revenge kill Beheeyem if you want to preserve it for the rest of the match; however, be careful of Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank that can KO it on the switch. As Beheeyem is almost always going to move last in the turn, it doesn't appreciate taking residual damage by switching into attacks, so it should be brought in after a teammate has fainted or through a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. By crippling switch-ins with Trick, Beheeyem can be a bit more reckless throughout the remainder of the match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Poliwrath are great teammates for Beheeyem, as they can take on any Dark or Steel-types that hassle it. Slow Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Lanturn, Xatu, and Pelipper can bring Beheeyem in safely, increasing its longevity throughout the match. Pokemon that can clean up late-game, such as Charizard, Tauros, and Swellow, all appreciate the holes Beheeyem punches into teams, and in return they can carry Beheeyem against faster, offensive teams which Beheeyem tends to struggle against.</p>"

  "Fraxure": {
    "overview": "<p>Fraxure possesses a high Attack stat, which, along with high-powered moves and good coverage, makes it remarkably hard to switch into. Additionally, Fraxure's access to the coveted Dragon Dance allows it to threaten offensive builds. Fraxure's useful mono-Dragon typing gives it resistances to the common Electric-, Fire-, Water-, and Grass-type moves thrown around the tier, and base 67 Speed is enough to outspeed most defensive Pokemon. On top of all this, Mold Breaker allows Fraxure to ignore abilities such as Sturdy, Solid Rock, and Unaware. However, Fraxure is quite frail, even getting 2HKOed by strong resisted hits and relying on Eviolite for any sort of bulk. This can make it difficult for Fraxure to set up and sweep at times. Furthermore, Fraxure's Speed stat isn't the best, as it gets outrun by most offensive Pokemon without a Speed boost including Tauros, Archeops, and Jynx.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Low Kick could be used over Superpower if you're worried about Superpower's stat drops, but it is significantly weaker against Ferroseed and Mawile, two of Superpower's main targets. A Choice Scarf would fix Fraxure's subpar Speed, but this would leave it relatively weak and frail, not to mention it would still be outrun by other Choice Scarf users such as Rotom and Jynx. Swords Dance could be a good option to pressure defensive teams more, but because Fraxure is rather slow, the Speed boost from Dragon Dance benefits it more. Swords Dance and Dragon Dance can be run simultaneously, but it's difficult to set up with both moves unless the opponent's team is very passive. Aqua Tail hits Rhydon for 4x super effective damage but otherwise has little merit besides hitting a good number of Pokemon neutrally. Sleep Talk allows Fraxure to switch into and sponge sleep-inducing moves from Grass-types such as Vileplume and Lilligant and could have some merit on the Choice Band set. Lum Berry ensures that stray status moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Scald won't prevent Fraxure from setting up, particularly giving it more wiggle room to set up against passive Water- and Grass-types such as Prinplup, Lanturn, and Roselia. Dual Chop could be used over Dragon Claw to break through Substitute and Focus Sash, but these moves are rather uncommon, and Dual Chop often becomes a liability due to its shaky accuracy. Substitute is an option on the Dragon Dance set to avoid status and ease prediction, though it forces Fraxure to forgo one of its coverage moves. Poison Jab still hits Fairies hard while having 100% accuracy, although the drop in power is noticeable, failing to 2HKO Mega Audino at +1 or even touch Mawile due to its secondary Steel typing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Mawile and Mega Audino are immune to Outrage and don't take much from Fraxure's coverage moves while being able to heavily damage Fraxure in return. Mawile has Intimidate to minimize the impact Fraxure will have on the rest of its team, while Mega Audino can take on Fraxure at a reasonably high HP and 2HKO with Dazzling Gleam.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Steelix, Aggron, Ferroseed, and Klinklang resist Fraxure's STAB moves and can often retaliate by attacking Fraxure directly or by crippling it with a status move. However they must be wary of Superpower which does a huge amount of damage to them.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure and Priority Moves</strong>: Because of Fraxure's bad defenses and middling Speed tier, it succumbs easily to offensive pressure from common Pokemon such as Archeops, Jynx, Tauros, and Primeape. In a similar vein, priority users such as Kangaskhan, Gurdurr, Pilowsine, and Shiftry are able to pick off a weakened Fraxure and cut its sweep short.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance turns Fraxure from shoddy to potent in one turn, boosting its Attack and Speed by one stage each and letting it take on offensive teams. Outrage is an insanely powerful STAB move that easily 2HKOes most neutral defensive Pokemon after a boost. Dragon Claw is a good alternative over Outrage, as it doesn't lock Fraxure in; it does miss out on a lot of KOs, though, which is a problem because many Pokemon will be able to take a hit and KO back thanks to Fraxure's unsatisfactory bulk. Superpower covers Rock- and especially Steel-types, such as Rhydon, Klinklang, Ferroseed, and Aggron. Iron Tail nails Fairy-types such as Mega Audino and Clefairy while also providing a decently powerful option if you don't want to lock Fraxure into Outrage. It's also a decent move for targeting Mawile without lowering Fraxure's Attack and Defense. Taunt is a nice option in the last moveslot for shutting down passive defensive Pokemon such as Musharna, Altaria, and Vileplume.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Fraxure's attacking power and Speed. A Jolly nature enables Fraxure to outrun maximum Speed Swellow, Floatzel, Tauros, and Archeops after using Dragon Dance. An Adamant nature could be used for more power, but Fraxure will miss out on the aforementioned threats, though it notably still manages to outspeed Pyroar at +1. Eviolite gives Fraxure a solid amount of bulk, which allows it to set up on a greater variety of Pokemon and survive weaker priority moves. Life Orb can be used for a significant boost in power; although forgoing Eviolite greatly restricts Fraxure's setup opportunities, Life Orb does grant Fraxure the ability to reliably 2HKO Mega Audino with Iron Tail at +1 with even a Jolly nature.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Fraxure generally shouldn't be brought into battle until its checks have been removed or sufficiently weakened, although this can be skipped over if Fraxure is needed to wear down a teammate's checks or if a teammate is carrying Healing Wish. Fraxure still has a decent amount of bulk with Eviolite, which can allow it to take weaker attacks and priority moves, such as Gurdurr's Mach Punch, Skuntank's Sucker Punch, and Samurott's Aqua Jet, depending on how much HP Fraxure has left after boosting up. Likewise, Fraxure can survive some powerful attacks when carrying an Eviolite, such as Life Orb Tauros's Rock Climb, but this should only be done if the opponent no longer carries any priority move users. If one opts for Life Orb on Fraxure, it should usually be played more aggressively and used to punch holes for a teammate to take advantage of. Though Fraxure doesn't get a ton of setup opportunities, some Pokemon Fraxure is able to set up on include Vileplume, Claydol, Prinplup, Pelipper, Roselia, and other defensive Pokemon that Fraxure can threaten at +1.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Mesprit, Garbodor, and Ferroseed to guarantees KOs on defensive Pokemon that could otherwise survive a hit and KO Fraxure. Additionally, Stealth Rock secures the 2HKO with +1 Iron Tail on Mega Audino, one of Fraxure's biggest checks. Fraxure likes having teammates that can deal with or weaken Mawile and Mega Audino, especially when you account for Iron Tail's shaky accuracy. Swords Dance Charizard and Klinklang can set up on Mega Audino, Mawile itself can switch into and set up on Mega Audino, and Fire-types such as Magmortar and Pyroar can deal with Mawile nicely. Because Mega Audino and Mawile both have ways of boosting their stats, a defensive answer, such as a Weezing or Skuntank with Taunt, could ensure that Fraxure's team isn't swept after Fraxure is forced out. Fraxure isn't able to switch into much besides passive Water- and Grass-types; therefore, Pokemon such as Scyther, Lanturn, Swellow, and Musharna are helpful to bring Fraxure in through pivoting moves without taking unwanted damage. Memento support from the likes of Jumpluff, Skuntank, and Mismagius is useful to give Fraxure a much easier time setting up. In a similar vein, Healing Wish users such as Mesprit and Lilligant can bestow Fraxure a second chance to sweep, especially if it has been crippled with a status condition.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Outrage completely destroys everything in its path bar Steel-types and Fairies. Superpower hits most Steel-types for good damage, as well as threats like Piloswine that can barely tank an Outrage. Iron Tail provides key coverage on Mega Audino while also hitting Mawile without having to lower Fraxure's Attack and Defense. Dragon Claw gives Fraxure a more reliable STAB move that still hits fairly hard and doesn't lock Fraxure in, which makes it a bit more spammable than Outrage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A simple spread of maximum Attack and Speed with a Choice Band is used to maximize Fraxure's damage output and Speed. An Adamant nature is preferred on this set to further bolster Fraxure's jaw-dropping power. Despite this, Jolly is still a very good option, allowing Fraxure to outrun neutral-natured base 70s such as Samurott and Ludicolo. Mold Breaker ignores Solid Rock from the likes of Carracosta.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Being a user of Choice Band, Fraxure will be employing more of a hit-and-run tactic, but it can stay in and sacrifice itself if there is a clear opening for a teammate to clean up. Fraxure should be brought into battle with pivoting moves or on weak resisted hits due to this set's lack of Eviolite. Fraxure is free to spam its STAB moves if the opponent is not carrying a Steel- or Fairy-type. However, in the case that the opponent is carrying a Steel- or Fairy-type, Fraxure should mostly use its coverage moves to hit them on the switch. Likewise, Outrage should be used sparingly or not at all if the opponent happens to be carrying a Fairy-type. Fraxure should also be wary of locking itself into Outrage against more offensive teams, as doing so will make it an easy target for revenge killers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Like any other offensive Pokemon, Fraxure appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Mesprit, Rhydon, and Garbodor to wear down its switch-ins. Scyther appreciates this set's ability to wear down certain physical walls, including Rhydon and Mawile, and can use U-turn to bring Fraxure in safely. Though this set is very powerful, Fraxure likes having a teammate that it can fall back on to deal with bulky Steel- and Fairy-types, such as Magmortar or Pyroar. Sticky Web support from Smeargle is a decent option for this set, allowing Fraxure to threaten offensive Pokemon such as Tauros, Pyroar, and Jynx a bit better. Fraxure also appreciates speed control from Thunder Wave users such as Liepard, Xatu, and Miltank that can neuter offensive Pokemon. Due to this set's lack of Eviolite, Pokemon with pivoting moves, such as Scyther, Mesprit, and Lanturn, are especially important in order for Fraxure to switch in safely.</p>"

  "Golurk": {
    "overview": "<p>Golurk has a unique typing with immunities to Normal, Fighting, and Electric, which allows it to block Rapid Spin and Volt Switch while being one of the few physical attackers in the tier unfazed by Fighting-type attacks. It boasts an extremely high Attack stat with a potent STAB combination as well as solid coverage, making it very tricky to wall. Golurk even has decent bulk for an offensive Pokemon, and it has usable abilities in the form of Iron Fist and No Guard; the former boosts the power of Golurk's various punching moves, while the latter ensures none of Golurk's (or its foe's) attacks miss. Unfortunately, Golurk often fails to fire off as many attacks as it would like, given that is very slow for an offensive Pokemon and carries numerous weaknesses to common attacking types such as Water, Grass, Ice, and Dark, the latter entailing a Pursuit weakness. This hinders its effectiveness as a spinblocker.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Polish can be used to potentially sweep offensive teams, but in most cases Golurk is better off using its turns on the field to set up Stealth Rock or simply attacking. The Stealth Rock set can use Magic Coat to reflect Taunt and opposing entry hazards, though Dynamic Punch is already effective at disrupting the foe's entry hazards while few foes would risk Taunting against Golurk due to its massive power. Drain Punch is a possible coverage option that gets boosted by Iron Fist, trading useful coverage for slightly better longevity. The use of Substitute and Focus Punch is an option for Golurk, but Golurk doesn't need the excessively powerful Fighting coverage and it can usually take better advantage of the free turn with Rock Polish instead of Substitute. Golurk could opt for a bulkier spread with max HP and slight defensive investment to better survive blows from Pokemon such as Tauros, though it doesn't really improve its matchup against many Pokemon in particular. Choice Scarf can patch up Golurk's Speed without wasting a turn setting up Rock Polish, but Golurk is still pretty slow in that it cannot outrun any boosted threats. Take into account its unboosted power, inability to switch moves, and the fact that its main STAB moves aren't the most spammable, Golurk's cleaning power as a Scarf user is limited. Stone Edge's utility is pretty much confined to taking out Pinsir, as most targets are dealt with sufficiently, perhaps even hit harder, by Golurk's other attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon that Resist or are Immune to Ground</strong>: While nearly any Pokemon risks taking severe damage from Choice Band Golurk's coverage moves, deterring Golurk from spamming its strongest attack can subject the defender to much less harm. Pokemon that work best for this role are Pokemon that can take most of Golurk's attacks, such as Weezing, Pelipper, Torterra, Tangela, and Mesprit. On the other hand, bulky walls such as Quagsire and Vileplume have a noticeably easier time against non-Choice Band Golurk, despite their lack of a Ground resistance.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon with a Super Effective STAB move</strong>: Due to Golurk's low speed and large assortment of weaknesses, most offensive Pokemon, such as Jynx, Samurott, Liepard, Shiftry, Lilligant, Aurorus, Ludicolo, Rotom, and Mismagius, can bring down Golurk without difficulty. However, Golurk's bulk means that it doesn't go down easily to weaker or non-STAB super effective strikes, and Rock Polish Golurk can zip past most of them, so caution must still be exercised. Speedy Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Rotom, Jynx, and Lilligant, can even outspeed Golurk after a Rock Polish boost.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Rock Polish Golurk is vulnerable to various forms of priority, including Sucker Punch, Aqua Jet, Ice Shard, and even Shadow Sneak. Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Kabutops, Cacturne, Samurott, Piloswine, and even Kecleon can help keep Golurk in check. However, Golurk is immune to Mach Punch and Fake Out.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: If one cannot prevent Golurk from snagging a KO, preventing it from snagging an additional KO is the next best thing. Golurk's weaknesses and sluggishness don't make this a challenging task, as most teams by default have at least one or two Pokemon with super effective STAB moves capable of taking down Golurk. This forces out slower Golurk or simply damages them beyond repair, while making it very difficult for Rock Polish Golurk to set up safely.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is an appealing option on Golurk. Golurk not only has an advantageous matchup against most Stealth Rock leads, but Golurk can also spinblock to keep its entry hazards up. Earthquake deals hefty damage to foes lacking a resistance, and especially hurting most grounded Stealth Rock leads. Ice Punch can also be used to hit the likes of Vileplume, Torterra, and Rotom-S. Dynamic Punch is primarily a disruption tool, being able to buy Golurk free turns and to trip foes up, particularly slower Pokemon; the likes of Crustle and Prinplup will face an uphill battle against confusion to fulfill their roles before Golurk knocks them out. The fact that Dynamic Punch can be spammed due to No Guard can cause foes to hesitate before making switches. Shadow Punch allows Golurk to hit Archeops and Mesprit, which are also commonly Stealth Rock users, and deters Xatu from switching in to Magic Bounce its Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Thunder Punch can be used to swiftly strike down Defog users, such as Mantine and Pelipper, before they can clear away Golurk's Stealth Rock. Note that Shadow Punch should only be used alongside Iron Fist due to its mediocre power without the boost from Iron Fist.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>As an offensive Stealth Rock setter, Golurk doesn't especially need bulk to do its job; it just opts for maximum power to dent the opponent as much as possible with its powerful attacks after using Stealth Rock. Maximum Speed investment is used to Speed tie with other base 55s, as well as to outspeed Jolly Crustle. A Jolly nature is an option for Golurk to outrun a few more threats, such as neutral-natured Aurorus and Pawniard. Dynamic Punch necessitates the use of No Guard, while Iron Fist pairs well with Thunder Punch while also boosting Shadow Punch. The item is the most customizable aspect about this Golurk variant. Colbur Berry weakens Knock Offs from Dark-types and Fighting-types, allowing Golurk to check the latter and to effectively spinblock against Sandslash. Passho Berry allows Golurk to survive Kabutops's Waterfall and OHKO with Earthquake, effectively denying the Rapid Spin, as well as to survive 2 Scalds from Defoggers such as Pelipper, Mantine, and Prinplup; this gives Golurk the chance to inflict more damage on them before it goes down.</p> <p>Focus Sash is a reasonable item choice as it allows Golurk to consistently set up Stealth Rock and proceed to hammer the foe if its Focus Sash remains intact. Lum Berry cures sleep and burn, while Leftovers increases Golurk's longevity should it be needed to set up Stealth Rock later in the match, or to simply stick around to throw out some attacks. Life Orb can be used for more power, giving Golurk better odds of OHKOing or 2HKOing Pokemon such as bulky Xatu, Garbodor, and defensive Carracosta.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used as a lead Stealth Rock setter. Golurk's three immunities, multiple resistances, and ability to force out certain threats with the threat of powerful attacks can give it the advantage in the lead matchup. No Guard Dynamic Punch is a fairly safe attack to throw out to mess with the opponent, putting them in a dilemma as to whether or not they should risk a switch. Be warned that No Guard exposes Golurk to perfectly accurate Sleep Powders, Hydro Pumps, and Will-O-Wisps. If Thunder Punch is used instead, Golurk does not have to worry unduly about Defoggers.</p> <p>Golurk can also be used to spinblock; even if it gets KOed right afterward due to its unfortunate weaknesses, faster teammates can be sent in to dispatch the spinners to prevent the Rapid Spin. If Golurk is not used as a lead, it should try to find an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock safely. It usually wants Focus Sash to do so consistently against offensive teams unless they have a weak link, such as a slower wall or weaker attacker, that can be exploited. Against defensive teams, there are more opportunities for Golurk to set up Stealth Rock; it might even get the chance to launch some powerful attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Golurk best fits on offensive teams, as they appreciate a Stealth Rock user that doesn't give the foe many setup opportunities. While Golurk can spinblock, its weakness against most of the spinners means a backup plan should always be in place; faster revenge killers such as Archeops, Tauros, Shiftry, and Lilligant can immediately respond to the spinners and scare them off, denying them the chance to use Rapid Spin. Golurk can even bait the spinner's attacks to allow its resistant teammates to enter battle and force them out, saving Golurk for further opportunities to spinblock.</p> <p>Offensive Pokemon in general appreciate Stealth Rock to secure more KOs. Flying-types, such as Swellow, Rotom-S, Archeops, and Scyther, make for decent teammates due to their great offensive synergy; Golurk handles Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-types for them, while they demolish Grass-types and can give frail offensive Pokemon a hard time. Most of them can even make use of U-turn or Volt Switch to maintain momentum and take advantage of Golurk's Stealth Rock. Most checks and counters to Grass- and Fighting-types such as Lilligant and Hariyama are vulnerable to Stealth Rock as well as Golurk's STAB types; the Grass-types can also protect Golurk from Water and Grass attacks while the Fighting-types handle Dark-types for Golurk.</p>"
      },
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Golurk's main damaging move, dishing out heavy damage against any non-Ground-resistant or -immune foes, and can even still hurt frailer Ground-resistant Pokemon, such as Lilligant. Shadow Punch receives STAB and is boosted by Iron Fist. It provides great neutral coverage alongside Earthquake, making it Golurk's next best attacking option. It nails most Levitate Pokemon such as Mesprit and Rotom, hammers bulky Psychic-types such as Musharna for major damage, and is Golurk's most powerful attack against Gourgeist, one of the physically bulkiest Pokemon in the tier. Ice Punch nails Grass-types for heavy damage on the switch, which makes foes such as Torterra, Leafeon, and Tangela hesitant to switch in and deters the likes of Torterra and Cacturne from setting up. It also provides coverage on Flying-types that aren't susceptible to Shadow Punch, such as Swellow and Rotom-S. Zen Headbutt 2HKOes Weezing on the switch, while Thunder Punch can be used to swiftly OHKO Pelipper; it's worth noting that Shadow Punch already 2HKOes Pelipper after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature, coupled with Choice Band, gives Golurk its greatest wallbreaking potential. Life Orb is a viable alternative over Choice Band to allow Golurk to switch moves. Maximum Speed investment allows Golurk to Speed tie opposing neutral-natured Golurk and Exeggutor, which are mutual threats, as well as to outrun slower Pokemon such as Mawile and various uninvested Pokemon such as Mantine and Malamar. Less Speed can be run in exchange for more bulk; 148 Speed EVs allow Golurk to outspeed uninvested Malamar and fully invested Adamant Rhydon, with the remaining EVs dumped into HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Golurk is best brought in on a free switch, either via double switching or the likes of U-turn, or brought in on a non-threatening foe such as Regirock or Garbodor. Alternatively, it can be used to revenge kill slower Pokemon, such as Lanturn and Musharna. Earthquake is the strongest move in Golurk's arsenal, so keep an eye out for the opponent's likely switch-ins to Ground-type moves. Because Shadow Punch has better neutral coverage, it is often the safer move for Golurk to throw out early-game. Identify the opponent's Golurk switch-ins and try to nail them on the switch with the appropriate coverage move. Golurk should consider carefully the move it locks itself into, as various setup sweepers such as Lilligant, Scyther, Carracosta, and Klinklang will take advantage of it; Shadow Punch is the move that grants opposing setup sweepers the fewest opportunities to set up, but does allow entry to hard-hitting Normal-types and Dark-types, such as Tauros, Kangaskhan, Zangoose, Swellow, Liepard, and Cacturne. Life Orb allows Golurk to switch moves to prevent this, but Golurk is regardless so prone to being forced out that Choice Band better suits for its hit-and-run nature, as it lets Golurk dish out more damage without reducing its longevity.</p> <p>Golurk specializes in dismantling bulky cores, and can find opportunities to do so by preying on the opponent's vulnerable Pokemon with its STAB types. Poison-, Rock-, Steel-, Psychic-, and grounded Electric-types, which include the likes of Garbodor, Regirock, Carracosta, Mawile, Musharna, Xatu, and Lanturn, are fair game for Golurk to start dishing out powerful hits. Golurk is slow, and thus will generally fare poorly against faster offensive teams outside of perhaps scoring a KO or two before being promptly revenge killed. Golurk's poor Speed entails a necessity to make correct predictions if it wants to contribute against offensive teams, as being Choice-locked makes Golurk quite prediction reliant. If that is an issue, Life Orb does ease prediction for Golurk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that fare well against offensive teams, such as Tauros, Shiftry, Lilligant, Kangaskhan, and Klinklang, can make up for Golurk's lackluster matchup against such teams. Golurk's unique resistances and its ability to easily dispatch many bulky Pokemon grant it respectable synergy with a wide variety of offensive Pokemon. Some of Golurk's best teammates include Flying-type U-turn users and Fighting-types. Flying-types, such as Swellow and Scyther, can lure in bulky Electric-, Rock-, and Steel-types and use them as an opportunity for Golurk to enter unscathed and start wreaking havoc. Fighting-types can check opposing Dark-types, possess potent wallbreaking prowess alongside Golurk, and appreciate Golurk luring in and dispatching problematic Pokemon that resist Fighting-type attacks with Zen Headbutt or Thunder Punch. Hariyama in particular synergizes well with Golurk as it possesses a resistance to Ice. Slowing down foes is another way to grant Golurk the advantage against faster teams. Bulky Thunder Wave users such as Musharna, Lanturn, and Probopass, and even Stun Spore Vileplume, can use their bulk and longevity to spread paralysis throughout the opponent's team, increasing the number of Golurk victims.</p>"

  "Pawniard": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its great offensive typing that grants it opportunities to use Swords Dance as well as its strong STAB attacks in Knock Off, Sucker Punch, and Iron Head, Pawniard is able to carve out a niche as a decent physical sweeper in the NU metagame. Furthermore, it has a good ability in Defiant that can discourage the use of Defog from the opposing team, although it's very situational and Pawniard loses to most Defoggers. On the downside, Pawniard has very low Speed and Special Defense, and its typing leaves it vulnerable to a multitude of special attackers such as Pyroar and Samurott and common types in general such as Fighting, Fire, and Ground. In an offensive metagame full of Pokemon such as Combusken, Magmortar, and Rhydon, Pawniard struggles to find setup opportunities, as it's often 2HKOed by even resisted attacks such as Swellow's Boomburst. Pawniard is also very weak before it gains the boost from Swords Dance, so it struggles to get past physically defensive Pokemon such as Steelix and Torterra.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Low Kick allows Pawniard to better take on Steel- and Dark-types such as Steelix and opposing Pawniard more effectively. X-Scissor lets Pawniard hit Malamar for big damage before it is knocked out; additionally, it OHKOes Shiftry. Stealth Rock is an option over Swords Dance that provides Pawniard with more utility for teams as well as an effective way to beat Xatu in the process, although it takes away from Pawniard's main niche, which is being able to set up and sweep. Pursuit allows Pawniard to trap Pokemon on a predicted switch and get off chip damage, although it's often better to just use Knock Off on an incoming switch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Poliwrath, Hitmonchan, and Hariyama can all take advantage of Pawniard's quadruple weakness to Fighting-type moves and KO it with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Torterra, Steelix, and Quagsire all have no trouble taking Pawniard's attacks, and the former two can take advantage of Pawniard to set up Stealth Rock, while the latter can use Pawniard as setup fodder for Curse. Torterra and Quagsire also both have reliable recovery, making them almost surefire checks to Pawniard, and additionally, Quagsire has Unaware, so Attack boosts from Swords Dance don't affect it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Pyroar, Magmortar, and Combusken are all able to exploit Pawniard's weakness to Fire-type moves and OHKO it, but if Pawniard is at +2 Attack, it can easily KO both Pyroar and Magmortar with Sucker Punch, although Pyroar can predict this and use Will-O-Wisp instead of attacking.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers such as Floatzel and Lilligant have no trouble KOing Pawniard thanks to its low Special Defense stat.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Pawniard's Attack, allowing it to break through bulkier Pokemon and making it a threatening sweeper. Knock Off is Pawniard's most spammable move, as it hits hardest if the foe has an item and it can cripple Pokemon such as Ferroseed by removing its Eviolite. Sucker Punch allows Pawniard to pick off faster foes such as Floatzel, especially at +2 Attack. Iron Head also gains the STAB boost, and it is important in taking on Fairy-types such as Mega Audino and Rock-types such as Regirock as well as hitting Fighting-types such as Hariyama for neutral damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment along with an Adamant nature makes Pawniard as strong and as fast as possible while still being able to outspeed Pokemon such as Golurk and Aurorus. Eviolite improves Pawniard's overall bulk, which allows it to take hits better and find more setup opportunities. Defiant discourages Defog from Pokemon such as Prinplup and Archeops and deters Pokemon with Intimidate such as Mawile from switching in.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Knock Off should be Pawniard's main move of choice, especially early in battles, as it can be helpful to weaken its checks and counters upon switching in while also crippling them by removing their item. Once Pawniard is in against a Pokemon that doesn't threaten it such as defensive Mawile or Musharna, it should use Swords Dance for a possible late-game sweep once its checks are weakened. On a predicted Defog from Pokemon such as Prinplup and Archeops, Pawniard can be switched in to gain a +2 Attack boost, although it should be wary of Scald and Earthquake, respectively. Don't switch Pawniard directly into strong special attacks, as it has trouble taking even resisted hits from Pokemon such as Aurorus.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pawniard works best on hazard stacking teams thanks to its ability Defiant, so Pokemon such as Rhydon and Garbodor make for great partners for their ability to set up Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, respectively. Physical wallbreakers such as Tauros are helpful for breaking down physical walls so that Pawniard can sweep. On the contrary, other physical setup sweepers such as Samurott and Combusken appreciate Pawniard's ability to cripple and break down walls with Knock Off. Pawniard appreciates Pokemon such as Pelipper and Mesprit that can take on opposing Fighting-types, which Pawniard struggles with greatly. Pokemon that can check Ground-types, such as Ludicolo and Gourgeist-XL, are very helpful in providing switches into Pokemon such as Rhydon and Torterra, which Pawniard struggles with.</p>"

  "Bouffalant": {
    "overview": "<p>Bouffalant's ability Sap Sipper, along with its good all-around bulk, helps it stand out among other Normal-types and makes it a great offensive switch-in to Grass-types such as Lilligant and Tangela. Bouffalant also gets access to a boosting move in Swords Dance. In terms of breaking down balance teams mid-game, Bouffalant is one of the best Pokemon for the job, thanks to its ability to set up on a plethora of Pokemon or 2HKO most of the tier, depending on which set it runs. Bouffalant is also a decent user of Pursuit, switching into and trapping the likes of Rotom and Mismagius that lack Will-O-Wisp as well as Haunter, Musharna, and Xatu. Though Bouffalant has many positive traits, it receives competition from other Normal-types such as Tauros, Zangoose, Kangaskhan, and Swellow, which have either more immediate power, higher Speed, or both. Its typing leaves it with only one immunity and a weakness to common Fighting-type moves; its general lack of resistances also undermines its good bulk. Additionally, Bouffalant still has trouble breaking through the likes of Rhydon, Regirock, and Gourgeist formes. In addition to status effects and entry hazards, Bouffalant is usually going to have to take a hit before it can attack because of its low Speed. It also gets worn down quickly by recoil from Head Charge, though this is somewhat mitigated by its solid HP stat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Assault Vest takes advantage of Bouffalant's ability Sap Sipper and decent bulk, turning it into a good switch-in to common special attackers such as Rotom, Lilligant, and Pyroar, as well as allowing it to take weaker special attacks better. However, Bouffalant loses a lot of power without a boosting item or move. Taunt shuts down opposing walls and could be used on the Swords Dance set, although Substitute already protects Bouffalant from status moves. It does shut down Quagsire, though, rendering it unable to recover its health or use Toxic. Soundproof could be used to take moves such as Bug Buzz and Boomburst, as well as Pyroar's Hyper Voice, but these attacks are not very common in the NU tier, and Bouffalant generally prefers the utility of Sap Sipper or the extra power of Reckless. Superpower hits Rock- and Steel-types harder than Earthquake, as well as notably hitting Ferroseed and Cradily super effectively in one move, but Earthquake already provides good enough coverage and Bouffalant doesn't like the stat drops that come from using the move. Toxic is nice to cripple physical walls such as Quagsire and Rhydon on the switch, opening the door for Bouffalant or a teammate to clean up later. Payback is a decent option on the Choice Band set, being able to smack Ghost-types that fear a Pursuit and decide to stay in on Bouffalant.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offensive Ghost-types</strong>: Offensive Ghost-types such as Haunter and Rotom are immune to Bouffalant's STAB moves as well as Earthquake and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp or wear it down with their secondary STAB moves. However, they must watch out for Pursuit or Stone Edge, especially from the Choice Band set.</p> <p><strong>Gourgeist formes</strong>: Gourgeist formes are immune to Bouffalant's STAB types and take little from its other moves while being able to either recover health, cripple Bouffalant with Will-O-Wisp, or wear it down with Foul Play. Gourgeist-S has a slight advantage over Gourgeist-XL as it can outspeed Bouffalant and burn it before it gets up a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Primeape and Hitmonchan can easily OHKO Bouffalant with their STAB moves, making them good offensive checks. Gurdurr can also 2HKO Bouffalant with a Drain Punch followed by a Mach Punch. Primeape should be careful against a Bouffalant with a Substitute up, as Close Combat's defense drops will leave them open to an OHKO. Gurdurr's bulk allows it to switch into Bouffalant much more easily than other Fighting-types, though it still gets 2HKOed by a Choice Band-boosted Head Charge.</p> <p><strong>Quagsire</strong>: Quagsire completely shuts down the Swords Dance set thanks to its ability Unaware, being able to heal off damage and eventually KO Bouffalant with repeated hits. It does, however, get 2HKOed by a Choice Band-boosted Head Charge.</p> <p><strong>Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Regirock, Carracosta, Cradily, Rhydon, and Ferroseed are great checks to the Choice Band set, even stomaching Earthquake pretty well thanks to their great physical bulk. However, all but the first are setup bait for the Swords Dance set.</p> <p><strong>Strong Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Bouffalant isn't particularly fast, so Pokemon such as Zangoose, Tauros, and Magmortar can outspeed it and overwhelm it with their STAB moves.</p>",

Substitute allows Bouffalant to avoid status moves, which gives it more setup opportunities, as well as avoid being revenge killed. Stone Edge can be used in the last slot if you want Bouffalant to be able to touch Mismagius and Rotom.

More EVs can be invested into Speed in order to outrun certain threats; for example, 148 EVs in Speed allow Bouffalant to outrun Malamar, while 216 EVs in Speed allow Bouffalant to get the jump on maximum Speed Adamant Mawile. Leftovers allows Bouffalant to recover damage taken from Substitute as well as negating Head Charge recoil. Lum Berry is an option to shield Bouffalant from status effects such as burn and paralysis. Lum Berry especially helps out if Bouffalant is running Pursuit, as it gives it some insurance against Ghost-types that might be carrying Will-O-Wisp. Sap Sipper is the preferred ability, as it gives Bouffalant more setup opportunities against Grass-types such as Vileplume, Lilligant, and Tangela.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set does well against bulkier teams, as they generally give Bouffalant more setup opportunities. Examples of Pokemon it can set up on include Ferroseed, Prinplup, Mega Audino, and Tangela. This set's main use is as a mid- or late-game sweeper, but it can also be used to break down walls for another Pokemon such as Scyther. Substitute should be used on slower Pokemon that commonly run status moves or against Pokemon that cannot do much in return. Obviously, Bouffalant serves as a great check to Grass-type Pokemon, so one should make sure to take full advantage of this ability. Try to generate free switches when facing offensive teams, as Bouffalant doesn't like taking extra damage when switching in on powerful attacks. A couple ways to do this are by using U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Scyther, Mesprit, and Lanturn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit support from the likes of Skuntank and Liepard is greatly appreciated, as this set can't touch Mismagius, Haunter, and Rotom. Pyroar, Primeape, Gurdurr, and Poliwrath can weaken or KO most Steel-types, making them good partners for Bouffalant. Bouffalant enjoys being paired with other setup sweepers such as Ludicolo, Shiftry, and Scyther, which can work with Bouffalant to wear down each other's checks in preparation for a sweep. These Pokemon can also cover Bouffalant against faster offensive teams. Water-types such as Samurott, Floatzel, Poliwrath, and Ludicolo can deal with the Rock-types that wall Bouffalant, namely Regirock and Rhydon. Ground-type Pokemon such as Rhydon, Torterra, Golurk, and Sandslash appreciate Bouffalant's ability to switch freely into Grass-types; in return, they can threaten Rock- and Steel-types as well as set up Stealth Rock. They also work with Bouffalant to essentially shut down Choiced Rotom through the combination of their typings.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Head Charge is Bouffalant's most powerful STAB move and destroys everything in its path, OHKOing most offensive Pokemon and even 2HKOing some defensive ones. Earthquake provides key coverage on Rock- and Steel-types, as well as hitting Garbodor without activating Rocky Helmet or Aftermath. Pursuit allows Bouffalant to trap Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Rotom, Mismagius, Haunter, Musharna, Mesprit, and Xatu as long as they do not carry Will-O-Wisp or aren't slower than it and carry U-turn. In the last slot, Megahorn is the preferred option, destroying Cradily as well as bulky Psychic-types such as Musharna, Mesprit, and Malamar. Alternatively, Stone Edge hits Ghost-types on the switch or hits the foe hard if it stays in on Bouffalant. Return can be used in place of Head Charge, as it is still reasonably powerful and doesn't come with the unfortunate side effect of recoil damage. Facade could be used instead of Pursuit or Megahorn, as it allows Bouffalant to switch into Scald users more safely and take advantage of being statused.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack along with an Adamant nature and a Choice Band gives Bouffalant a frightening amount of power behind its attacks. The Speed EVs allow Bouffalant to outspeed Malamar and KO it with Megahorn, even when it has +3 Defense. Alternatively, 216 EVs can be invested into Speed to outpace maximum Speed Adamant Mawile; however, this leaves Bouffalant a bit shortchanged on bulk. If you decide to use Bouffalant on a Trick Room team, Bouffalant should run a Brave nature, invest in HP rather than Speed, and reduce its Speed IV to 0. Sap Sipper lets Bouffalant switch in on Grass-type moves while gaining an additional Attack boost in the process. Reckless can be used to power up Head Charge even further, though this leaves Bouffalant with fewer opportunities to switch in, as it forgoes Sap Sipper in order to do so.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set aims to break through the opposing team using immediate, brute power. Head Charge is easily Bouffalant's most spammable move, so it'll be using it most of the time. The other moves mostly just provide coverage against Pokemon that can take a Head Charge. Be sure to make full use of Sap Sipper to switch in on Grass-types such as Tangela, Vileplume, and Lilligant; in particular, Bouffalant can act as a sleep absorber for its team, being able to switch into Sleep Powders left and right. Bouffalant should utilize its Ghost immunity to switch into Ghost-types that commonly carry a Choice Scarf, such as Rotom and Haunter, and trap them with Pursuit. Conversely, if the opponent is carrying a Ghost-type Pokemon, try to scout with Bouffalant's teammates to make sure they aren't carrying Will-O-Wisp before trapping them with Pursuit, as Bouffalant doesn't appreciate getting burned.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Water-types such as Samurott, Floatzel, Poliwrath, and Ludicolo pair well with Bouffalant, as they can deal with Regirock and Rhydon. Pyroar, Primeape, Gurdurr, and Poliwrath make for good partners, as they can weaken or KO most Steel-types for Bouffalant. Ground-types such as Torterra, Rhydon, Golurk, and Sandslash appreciate Bouffalant's ability to switch into Grass-types, and in return, they can threaten Rock- and Steel-types as well as set up Stealth Rock. Slow pivots such as Lanturn and Musharna are a good idea, being able to bring Bouffalant in safely if there is not a Grass-type on the opposing team. Conversely, Pokemon such as Carracosta, Rhydon, and Quagsire can lure in Grass-types for Bouffalant to switch into. Carracosta and Shiftry also appreciate Bouffalant's ability to deal with Tangela, Vileplume, and Cradily, as it aids them in being able to sweep the opponent's team later. Sweepers and faster Pokemon in general pair well with Bouffalant due to this set's wallbreaking potential. Some examples include Shiftry, Scyther, Samurott, and Archeops. This set works surprisingly well on a Trick Room team thanks to Bouffalant's good bulk and low Speed stat. Pokemon such as Xatu, Mesprit, and Musharna can deal with Fighting-types and should always be paired with Bouffalant. Mesprit in particular can use Healing Wish to bring Bouffalant back to full health.</p>"

  "Frogadier": {
    "overview": "<p>Frogadier possesses one of the greatest abilities in the game in Protean, which gives it STAB on any move it uses, making it a powerful wallbreaker. It's a very versatile Pokemon thanks to its high base Speed that allows it to outpace base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Haunter and Jynx and its diverse movepool that allows it to hit most of the tier for at least neutral damage. Frogadier's great movepool isn't limited to attacks, as it is one of the fastest and most viable Pokemon that can set up Toxic Spikes; as it forces switches, it can set up one layer with ease, and one of the common entry hazard control Pokemon in Xatu has a hard time switching in, as it's threatened by a Protean Ice Beam. Despite its multiple STAB moves, Frogadier's average Special Attack holds it back. Its poor defenses also make it so frail that it cannot take even resisted hits, and its lack of immunities leaves it with no opportunities to switch in; on top of that, it's easy to revenge kill. It faces competition as a special Water-type wallbreaker from Samurott, which is bulkier and more powerful but not as fast as Frogadier is. Frogadier also faces competition from other wallbreakers such as Magmortar and Samurott.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dark Pulse hits Musharna and Rotom but has little use outside of that. Hidden Power Electric allows Frogadier to hit Mantine, but this move also is rather team specific and situational. Hidden Power Grass, on the other hand, does hit Lanturn and other bulky Water-types. U-turn is a solid option in the last slot, as it functions as a way to gain momentum on a predicted switch, scout the foe, and hit Malamar, which can take multiple special attacks from Frogadier. An alternative set could be a Focus Sash suicide lead with Toxic Spikes, Taunt, U-turn, and a supportive attacking move such as Scald or Icy Wind, making it annoying to face.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Mega Audino, Lanturn, Mantine, Hariyama, and Malamar can eat up Frogadier's Protean-boosted attacks due to their high special bulk and neutrality to its attacks, and they can retaliate with any attack for a lot of damage due to Frogadier's frailness. However, Mega Audino, Lanturn, and Hariyama all take significant damage from Gunk Shot. Mantine is entirely safe unless Frogadier carries Grass Knot as a coverage move, which can hit it for a lot of damage, even 2HKOing if Stealth Rock is up.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Revenge killers such as Tauros, Archeops, Scyther, and Choice Scarf users are able to outspeed Frogadier and pick it off even with a neutral attack, as Frogadier is too frail to take strong attacks. It's worth mentioning that they can't switch into most of Frogadier's attacks, though, as they are solely revenge killers.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers</strong>: Hariyama, Skuntank, and Kangaskhan can easily pick off Frogadier with their priority moves, but most of them cannot safely switch in. The effectiveness of their priority moves depends on Frogadier's typing via Protean. For example, if Frogadier is a Water-type, it resists Hariyama's Bullet Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Although it is inaccurate, Hydro Pump offers the most damage output of Frogadier's moves, and due to Frogadier's average Special Attack, it really needs high-Base Power attacks. Ice Beam functions as a reliable move that offers excellent coverage alongside Hydro Pump, hitting the Grass- and Dragon-types that resist it such as Vileplume, Gourgeist-XL, Altaria, and Sliggoo. Gunk Shot is the best coverage move for the third slot, as it hits Hariyama, Mega Audino, Abomasnow, Ludicolo, and Clefairy all in one slot. Grass Knot is another option to hit Mantine slightly harder than Gunk Shot as well as hitting Samurott and preventing Barbaracle from using Frogadier as setup bait. Toxic Spikes quickly wears down bulky foes, and Frogadier is a good setter of them due to its respectable Speed and ability to force switches.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed allows Frogadier to hit hard and outspeed the most Pokemon it can. Run a Naive nature if you choose Gunk Shot so as to not decrease the damage output, but if you choose Grass Knot in that slot instead, a Timid nature should be your choice. Life Orb offers a much-needed power boost that lets Frogadier ensure KOs or do a hefty amount of damage, and due to its frailness, it doesn't mind taking recoil damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Frogadier in with a Volt Switch or U-turn user, when a teammate has fainted, or on double switches. Don't bring Frogadier into attacks for any reason, even if they are resisted, because it's unable to take any hit. Frogadier works better if you bring it in early- or mid-game with entry hazards up on the opponent's side of the field, as this way its wallbreaking capabilities are more effective. It also functions perfectly as a late-game cleaner once the opposing team is weakened enough. Toxic Spikes should be used when Frogadier forces out a foe with the threat of a super effective move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Frogadier appreciates being paired with Volt Switch or U-turn users, as every heavy hitter appreciates momentum. Entry hazard support punishes the many switches that Frogadier forces and is crucial for some 2HKOs; for example, if Stealth Rock is up, Frogadier's Grass Knot has a high chance to 2HKO Mantine, and if one layer of Spikes is up, Frogadier's Gunk Shot has a high chance to 2HKO Hariyama. Frogadier is going to be switching in and out of the field often, as it's easily threatened, and because entry hazards in conjunction with Life Orb recoil will wear it down quickly, Frogadier likes having Rapid Spin or Defog support from a teammate such as Hitmonchan, Skuntank, or Pelipper. Physical wallbreakers such as Kangaskhan can prove to be useful for taking out the special walls that Frogadier struggles with, and they also take advantage of Frogadier's Toxic Spikes taking down grounded foes more quickly. A Pokemon with access to Healing Wish gives Frogadier another chance to weaken bulky Pokemon that can take several hits and prevent a late-game sweep for a teammate, Mesprit being one of the most common users.</p>"

  "Pyroar": {
    "overview": "<p>Pyroar has great offensive presence due to its high Special Attack stat and powerful STAB moves. It also sits in a nice Speed tier, being able to outspeed the likes of Jynx and Scyther and Speed tie with Liepard. Furthermore, Pyroar has a decent defensive typing, which allows it to take on Ghost-, Grass-, and Steel-types such as Rotom, Lilligant, and Klinklang. However, Pyroar has an unfortunate weakness to Stealth Rock as well as a vulnerability to other forms of entry hazards, which means it can be worn down very easily. Its dual STAB combination leaves it walled by popular Rock-type Pokemon such as Archeops, Carracosta, and Rhydon, and for an offensive Pokemon, Pyroar has an extremely barren offensive movepool. As a result, Pyroar faces competition from Magmortar, which is much stronger and has a wider offensive movepool. Moreover, Pyroar is weak to common priority moves such as Mach Punch from Hitmonchan and Aqua Jet from Samurott, and its average bulk does not help it at all.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be used to revenge kill a weakened Rhydon or Barbaracle at +2 as well as Quiver Dance users such as Lilligant and Vivillon. Wild Charge can be used to hit Mantine, and to a lesser extent, Pelipper. Endeavor is an unexpected alternative to bring down the foe's health to match Pyroar's. Work Up boosts Pyroar's already high Special Attack, turning it into an even more fearsome wallbreaker. Sleep Talk can be used to absorb Sleep Powders from Lilligant and Lovely Kisses from Jynx.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Carracosta, Rhydon, Kabutops, and Regirock can easily take Hyper Voices and Fire Blasts and OHKO Pyroar with their attacks, but they have to be careful of Hidden Power Grass and Will-O-Wisp. Regirock, unlike the other three, can easily shrug off Hidden Power Grass when it is relatively healthy. Carracosta and Barbaracle can take advantage of Pyroar locked into Fire Blast or Hyper Voice and set up a Shell Smash on it. Archeops is able to outspeed Pyroar naturally and is not weak to Hidden Power Grass, but it needs to be careful of Will-O-Wisp, which cripples it by cutting its Attack. It also risks being knocked into Defeatist range by Fire Blast, which can allow Pyroar to beat it one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Lanturn, Mantine, and Prinplup are able to take any hit from Pyroar at full health and 2HKO it with their attacks. They all, however, are not the most reliable of switch-ins, as they lack reliable recovery, which means that they can be worn down rather easily and do not appreciate taking too many Hyper Voices.</p> <p><strong>Thick Fat Users</strong>: Assault Vest Hariyama is one of the best counters to Pyroar because of its ability Thick Fat. It can take any hits from Pyroar with ease and OHKO it with Close Combat. It does have to be wary of Will-O-Wisp, though. Grumpig does not mind taking a Will-O-Wisp as much as Hariyama does and can slowly whittle down Pyroar with its attacks or cripple it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Mesprit and Jynx can outspeed Pyroar and 2HKO or even OHKO it after some prior damage. Priority moves such as Aqua Jet from Kabutops and Samurott, Mach Punch from Hitmonchan, and Sucker Punch from Shiftry and Skuntank can easily pick off Pyroar when it is weakened. Pokemon that naturally outspeed Pyroar such as Tauros, Archeops, and Speed Boost Combusken at +2 are able to OHKO Pyroar with their powerful attacks.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazards of all kinds, most notably Stealth Rock, are able to greatly reduce Pyroar's longevity, especially when it is equipped with a Life Orb. Pyroar is also very susceptible to poison, which can wear it down even further.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is an extremely powerful STAB move that hits any Pokemon that does not resist it for a decent amount of damage. Hyper Voice provides great neutral coverage with Fire Blast, hitting Water- and Fire-types such as Lanturn and Magmortar reasonably hard. Hidden Power Grass rounds off Pyroar's coverage, nailing Rock-types such as Kabutops and Rhydon, which would otherwise wall Pyroar. Will-O-Wisp is used to punish Thick Fat Hariyama, and it also bypasses Sucker Punch users such as Shiftry, Kangaskhan, and Skuntank. Taunt allows Pyroar to halt Calm Mind and Wish users such as Mega Audino and Clefairy while stopping entry hazard users. Flamethrower should be used with Choice Specs and is used as a safer Fire-type STAB move that has 100% accuracy, unlike Fire Blast. Overheat can be used in the last slot for an even stronger STAB move that is useful early on in the game to weaken the opposing team severely.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment is used to give Pyroar as much offensive presence as possible. The maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is mandatory, as fully invested Pyroar is able to outspeed many pertinent threats such as Scyther and Lilligant. Life Orb is used to amplify Pyroar's attacks, though it comes at the cost of taking recoil damage. Choice Specs can be used over Life Orb for a bigger power boost, granting Pyroar the ability to 2HKO Lanturn after Stealth Rock, and it does not have recoil damage; however, it locks Pyroar into a move. Charcoal can be used to bluff a Choice Specs set to opponents, but it only boosts Pyroar's Fire-type attacks. Unnerve, while situational, is the most useful ability out of the three available, as it can stop foes such as Linoone and Sandslash from using their Sitrus Berry and Lum Berry, respectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pyroar is mainly used as a wallbreaker to wear down the opposing team to pave a way for its teammates to clean up late-game. For a majority of the battle, Pyroar should keep using Fire Blast, as it is able to dent the opposing team very hard. If running it, Pyroar can also use Overheat early-game, as Pyroar is a hit-and-run Pokemon most of the time anyway. Because Pyroar has a decent defensive typing, it can pivot into Grass- and Ghost-types with relative ease and hit them hard. However, against Grass-types such as Vileplume and Roselia, it has to be careful of Sludge Bomb, while against Tangela and Lilligant, it has to look out for Sleep Powder. Against Ghost-types such as Rotom, it has to be wary of Thunderbolt, but it can reliably switch into Mismagius and Misdreavus, as they cannot do much against it. Pyroar should not be exposed to any status moves; poison can severely wear it down, especially in tandem with the recoil from Life Orb, while Thunder Wave cuts its Speed. Players can attempt to predict switches to Rock-types such as Rhydon and Carracosta by clicking either Hidden Power Grass to 2HKO them or Will-O-Wisp to cripple them. If using Choice Specs, Pyroar should not recklessly lock itself into Hidden Power Grass, as this gives Klinklang and Lilligant free setup opportunities against it; in general, Pyroar should not use it when there is a setup sweeper on the opponent's team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-types such as Torterra and Shiftry have great defensive synergy with Pyroar, as they resist Ground-type attacks while Pyroar resists Bug-type attacks. Torterra and Shiftry are able to take on Rock- and Water-types for Pyroar easily, while Pyroar deals with the Grass- and Ice-types that they struggle with; Shiftry also has Defog to remove entry hazards, which helps Pyroar a lot. Physical wallbreakers such as Mawile and Kabutops work well with Pyroar, as they can wear down special walls for it. Pokemon that can deal with Rock-types are also greatly appreciated. Poliwrath and Gourgeist have no trouble doing so, being able to switch in with ease and proceed to fire of a Scald or Will-O-Wisp, respectively. Water-types such as Prinplup and Samurott also deals with the Rock-types that Pyroar has trouble with. Prinplup is also able to provide Defog support, while Samurott appreciates Pyroar's ability to weaken Vileplume and Gourgeist-S to ease setup for Samurott. Because Pyroar has some trouble getting a safe switch onto the field, it greatly benefits from a slow U-turn or Volt Switch from the likes of Mesprit and Lanturn. Garbodor in particular works well with Pyroar, as it easily handles Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Hitmonchan while Pyroar handles Ghost-types such as Rotom and Haunter for Garbodor. Garbodor also has the additional benefit of providing Spikes and Toxic Spikes support; two layers of Spikes guarantee the 2HKO on Prinplup with Hyper Voice. Pyroar also appreciates partners such as Xatu and Claydol, which can deter or remove entry hazards with Magic Bounce and Rapid Spin, respectively. A Ground-type such as Sandslash or Rhydon, while it shares a common Water-type weakness with Pyroar, appreciates Pyroar's ability to beat Grass-types; furthermore, the combination of the two Pokemon allows them to completely shut down Rotom by virtue of their typings.</p>"

  "Gogoat": {
    "overview": "<p>With its good bulk, decent Attack stat, and good defensive typing, Gogoat makes for an excellent setup sweeper in NU. Access to Bulk Up, Horn Leech, and Substitute, along with its good typing, means Gogoat typically has an easy time setting up against most teams. Its low Speed stat is its main drawback, as it leaves Gogoat susceptible to most revenge killers. Furthermore, its lackluster movepool leaves it very predictable and can cause problems for Gogoat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Although Gogoat is a decently effective setup sweeper, it does not have very many other options. Milk Drink or Synthesis could be used, but typically Horn Leech and Leftovers provide enough recovery. Brick Break can be used to hit Steel-types but is almost always worse than Earthquake coverage-wise. Leech Seed can be used to wear down Gogoat's foes, but again, Horn Leech and Leftovers usually prove to be enough. Wild Charge can be used as an alternative to hit Flying-types, but Gogoat cannot manage to find the room to run it. Lastly, Roar is an option to deter opposing setup sweepers, but usually Gogoat needs its coverage to be effective.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Weezing, Vileplume, Garbodor, and Arbok can all come in against a Substitute, Bulk Up, or Horn Leech and take out Gogoat with their respective super effective STAB attacks. All bar Weezing should watch out for Earthquake, however. Arbok can also Intimidate Gogoat, while Weezing is an exceptional counter thanks to its ability to burn Gogoat, as well as hit it hard with its super effective Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Archeops, Vivillon, Rotom-S, and Swanna can all outspeed Gogoat and put a dent in it with their super effective STAB Flying-type moves. Swanna and Archeops should watch out for boosted Horn Leeches, however.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Typing Advantage</strong>: Pokemon that have an upper hand against Gogoat with their typing, including Bug-types such as Scyther; Ice-types like Aurorus, Regice, and Jynx; and Fire-types such as Pyroar and Magmortar, can all come in on any move Gogoat has to throw at them and KO it with their super effective STAB attacks. Aurorus and Jynx must be wary of Horn Leech, however, and Pyroar and Magmortar of Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn, paralysis, and poison are all big obstacles to Gogoat, as they halve its Attack, drastically cut its Speed, and wear it down, respectively, hindering its sweeping capabilities. Gourgeist and Weezing can burn Gogoat, Liepard can paralyze it, and Toxic Spikes from Pokemon such as Roselia and Garbodor can poison it.</p> <p><strong>Taunt / Encore</strong>: Taunt users such as Archeops, Liepard, and Mismagius all prevent the use of Substitute and Bulk Up, two of Gogoat's main moves. Without these, Gogoat struggles to fill a good role on any team. Encore is a similar case, but there are few good users of the move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bulk Up allows Gogoat to tear through teams and remediates its more or less uninvested Attack and Defense stats. Horn Leech is Gogoat's go-to attacking move, hitting Ground-, Water-, and Rock-types hard and providing a reliable source of recovery. Substitute is a good way to avoid status and makes setting up on walls much easier. Additionally, the recovery from Horn Leech negates the lost health. Earthquake is a great coverage move that hits Fire-, Electric-, Poison-, and Steel-types. Rock Slide can be used for valuable coverage against Fire-, Bug-, Flying-, and Ice-types, but typically Gogoat can beat those either with another move or with the help of another teammate.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs are put into HP and Special Defense, maximizing Gogoat's special bulk. A Careful nature is used to further bolster Gogoat's Special Defense. Leftovers is used for a reliable source of residual health. Lastly, Sap Sipper is used to beat opposing Grass-types and get an Attack boost at the same time.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gogoat can come in on most Water-, Ground-, Grass-, Electric-, and Rock-types, such as Prinplup, Lilligant, Kabutops, Rotom, and Sandslash, and proceed to set up either Bulk Up or Substitute. It should watch out for Scald burns from Water-types, however. Before trying to sweep, you should dispose of Pokemon carrying Taunt. If Gogoat can get a few boosts, it should try to spam Horn Leech, as even if it is resisted, it can wear down foes quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Water-types such as Samurott and Carracosta work well as teammates, since they beat troublesome Fire-types, while Gogoat can beat Electric- and Grass-types for them. Fire-types such as Pyroar and Magmortar make for good teammates, as they beat Bug- and Ice-types, such as Vivillon, Scyther, and Jynx. Additionally, Gogoat can handle Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types in return. Gogoat, along with Fire-type and Water-type teammates, form a good core that handles one another's weaknesses. Garbodor makes for a good teammate, as it can deal with annoying Pokemon such as Vileplume for Gogoat, all the while setting entry hazards. Lastly, Ground- and Rock-types such as Sandslash and Kabutops make for good teammates, as Gogoat can beat troublesome Water- and Ground-types for them, respectively, as well as Grass-types, while they beat Bug-, Poison-, and Flying-types in return. Additionally, both can spin away entry hazards that can threaten Gogoat's ability to set up.</p>"

With investment, Malamar is capable of tanking a lot of strong special attacks such as Swellow's Boomburst and Magmortar's Fire Blast. On the downside, while Malamar's defensive typing leaves it with few weaknesses, it provides no resistances and only an immunity to Psychic-type moves, hindering its defensive utility; this is further compounded by Malamar's lack of physical bulk. Additionally, Malamar's Psychic / Dark typing leaves it vulnerable to common Bug-type moves such as Scyther's U-turn, Mesprit's Signal Beam, and Samurott's Megahorn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A more offensive set with an EV spread of 248 HP / 148 SpD / 112 Spe and a Careful nature running Superpower, Knock Off, Psycho Cut, and either Substitute or Rest can be used, though it is a lot less effective than RestTalk and is easily worn down. The main appeal to using this set is to surprise Weezing with a Psychic-type attack, as Weezing is normally an excellent defensive answer to Malamar. Support moves such as Topsy-Turvy, Destiny Bond, and Taunt can be helpful to take on some of Malamar's checks, though they are very situational and not as effective as Malamar's RestTalk set. Rock Slide can be used to lure and KO Scyther, which is one of Malamar's biggest checks. Choice Scarf can be used for the surprise factor and to use Malamar as a faster late-game cleaner, though it is relatively weak and much easier to take on. A Tanga Berry can be used on the defensive RestTalk set, allowing Malamar to tank a U-turn or Signal Beam and fire off an extra hit, but this generally has less utility than the passive recovery of Leftovers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bug-type Coverage Moves</strong>: Signal Beam from Mesprit, Xatu, and Musharna and Megahorn from Rhydon and Samurott are able to KO Malamar before it can set up.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Scyther and Pinsir can shake off any attack from Malamar and KO it or use it as setup fodder. However, both of these Pokemon dislike losing their item, as Scyther loses a significant amount of bulk without its Eviolite and Pinsir's damage output is greatly reduced without a Life Orb or Choice Band.</p> <p><strong>Curse Quagsire</strong>: Thanks to Unaware, Quagsire can ignore all stat boosts from Malamar and use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Weezing</strong>: While it dislikes losing its Black Sludge, Weezing takes little damage from Superpower and can burn Malamar with Will-O-Wisp. Furthermore, Weezing can prevent Malamar from using Rest or Sleep Talk with Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Mega Audino</strong>: Mega Audino takes very little damage from Superpower and Knock Off and can use Malamar as setup fodder; however, if the opponent is using cleric Mega Audino, Special Attack investment is required; otherwise, Malamar can beat it.</p>",

      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Superpower is a strong attack that boosts Malamar's Attack and Defense when used and hits Dark-, Steel-, and Normal-types super effectively. Knock Off is a strong STAB move that is able to cripple Pokemon such as Scyther and Weezing by removing their item. Rest provides Malamar with a way to rid itself of status as well as recover HP. Sleep Talk allows Malamar to attack while asleep, preventing it from becoming setup fodder for opposing Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment allows Malamar to most efficiently take special attacks. Leftovers gives Malamar a means of passive recovery, allowing it to survive longer throughout battles. Contrary turns stat drops into boosts and vice versa, meaning Superpower hits the foe with 120 Base Power while also boosting both Malamar's Attack and Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Malamar's best use is as a mid- or late-game cleaner once its checks and counters, such as Scyther and Weezing, are weakened. Use Superpower on something it hits super effectively or more passive foes such as Vileplume and Rotom-S to potentially start a sweep with the boosts Superpower gives. Use Knock Off early-game to whittle down checks and counters before setting up late-game. Be wary of Bug-type coverage moves such as Signal Beam from Mesprit and Megahorn from Samurott. If Malamar is low on health or inflicted with status, use Rest to heal up. Malamar can be switched into sleep-inducing moves such as Sleep Powder from Vivillon and Lovely Kiss from Jynx to pick up momentum and prevent a teammate from having to go to sleep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Malamar tends to fit best on balanced teams in need of a specially bulky Pokemon and a wincon. Entry hazard support from the likes of Rhydon, Steelix, and Garbodor helps Malamar a great deal considering most of its checks, such as Scyther, are susceptible to hazards. Strong wallbreakers such as Kangaskhan and Samurott are able to weaken the opponent's bulkier Pokemon to pave the way for a late-game sweep from Malamar; additionally, Primeape can lure Scyther and surprise it with Stone Edge and weaken Mega Audino greatly, making it much easier for Malamar to sweep. Steel-types like Steelix and Klinklang are able to take on Musharna and Mega Audino, which are two of Malamar's best checks. Scyther is also a common check to Malamar, so it appreciates Pokemon such as Rhydon and Rotom to check it.</p>"

  "Barbaracle": {
    "overview": "<p>With access to Shell Smash and respectable offensive stats, Barbaracle is a very potent sweeper in NU. This is furthered by Tough Claws, which gives essentially a Life Orb boost to contact moves such as Razor Shell and Cross Chop. In contrast to Carracosta, which shares Barbaracle's typing and role as a Shell Smash sweeper, Barbaracle has a significantly higher base Speed that allows it to outspeed the majority of Choice Scarf users after a boost, while Carracosta has to rely on Aqua Jet to hit them. However, Carracosta's combination of higher Defense and Solid Rock gives it more opportunities to set up, and its access to Aqua Jet gives Carracosta more early- and mid-game presence than Barbaracle. Barbaracle is also severely troubled by the abundance of Grass-types in NU, which put immense amounts of pressure on it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Grass Knot is an option to hit Gastrodon, which would otherwise wall Barbaracle due to Storm Drain, as well as dealing substantial damage to Carracosta. In addition, Cross Chop is another coverage move that hits Ferroseed, but has very little use outside of that. Barbaracle can utilize a Stealth Rock lead set, as it has access to support moves such as Taunt and Endeavor. Although it is generally outperformed at this role by Archeops, Barbaracle's value as a lead comes from its Water-type STAB moves to target common Stealth Rock users such as Rhydon and its neutrality to Water unlike Archeops. Stone Edge hits Grass-types and some Water-types harder than Barbaracle's other main attacks, but it is generally not worth the moveslot, as Return is almost always more reliable thanks to its perfect accuracy and the fact that it is just as strong as a STAB Stone Edge. White Herb can be used to restore Barbarace's defenses after a Shell Smash, which is useful to soften the damage taken from priority attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Tangela, Vileplume, Gourgeist, and Lilligant are major threats to Barbaracle. The first three all sport excellent physical bulk and resist Barbaracle's Water-type attacks and threaten back with a 4x super effective STAB move. Lilligant cannot take boosted attacks, unlike the others, but it acts as more of an offensive check to Barbaracle.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Pelipper, Prinplup, and Poliwrath resist Barbaracle's Water-type attacks and can prey off of Barbaracle's subpar Special Defense and also threaten to cripple it with a burn from Scald. Poliwrath also has STAB Vacuum Wave to pick off a weakened Barbaracle. Gastrodon walls all non-Grass Knot variants thanks to Storm Drain and Recover.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Pokemon such as Musharna and Weezing can all take a boosted hit from Barbaracle given that they are sufficiently healthy. Musharna can hinder Barabarcle's sweeping capabilities with Thunder Wave and Weezing can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, though Substitute twarts their attempt at crippling Barbaracle.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash doubles Barbaracle's Attack, Special Attack, and Speed at the cost of lowering its defenses. Razor Shell is boosted by Tough Claws and is Barbaracle's primary STAB attack, hitting neutral and super effective targets for heavy damage. Return has solid neutral coverage overall, hitting most Pokemon that resist Water for decent damage, and it is also boosted by Tough Claws. Earthquake, despite not being boosted by Tough Claws, OHKOes Garbodor after a boost and avoids Rocky Helmet and Aftermath damage as well as hitting Lanturn hard. Substitute is an alternative to dodge status moves from the likes of Weezing, Mesprit, and Xatu at the cost of a coverage move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment is used to hit as hard and as quickly as possible. An Adamant nature is preferred over Jolly, as even with a neutral Speed nature Barbaracle hits 470 Speed after a Shell Smash, outpacing a significant portion of the metagame after a boost. However, a Jolly nature can be used if outspeeding positive-natured base 95 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Haunter and Jynx is important. Shuca Berry significantly weakens damage taken from Ground-type attacks, allowing Barbaracle to set up on Normal- and Flying-types such as Tauros, Kangaskhan, and Archeops, which carry Earthquake for coverage. Lum Berry can be used to avoid status conditions from the likes of Miltank, Weezing, and Misdreavus. Tough Claws significantly boosts the power of all of Barbaracle's contact moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Barbaracle will often only get one opportunity in the match to set up, so make sure that you have either removed or significantly weakened its checks and counters first. With a Shuca Berry, Barbaracle can set up on Pokemon that would otherwise severely damage it with Earthquake, such as Archeops and Tauros. Set up on Choice-locked Pokemon such as Pyroar locked into Fire Blast and Scyther locked into Aerial Ace or against weaker defensive Pokemon such as Audino and Mawile.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Primeape, Tauros, and Haunter are good teammates, as they can wear down defensive cores for Barbaracle to sweep late-game. Fire- and Ice-types such as Pyroar, Magmortar, Aurorus, and Jynx act as wallbreakers and also threaten Grass-types, which are problematic for Barbaracle. Bulky Water-types are bothersome for Barbaracle, so Grass-types such as Lilligant, Cacturne, and Vileplume make for good teammates to cover them, and Vileplume also checks Grass-types thanks to its secondary Poison typing. Memento support from Jumpluff and Skuntank give Barbaracle more opportunities to set up. Healing Wish support from Mesprit, Lilligant, and Musharna is helpful to potentially give Barbaracle a second chance at sweeping.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Razor Shell is Barbaracle's strongest Water-type STAB attack thanks to the Tough Claws boost as well as its most reliable attack in general, dealing considerable damage with near-perfect accuracy. Stone Edge is a secondary STAB attack that has near-perfect neutral coverage beside Razor Shell and is useful for hitting Flying-types very hard; however, Return is another option that gets similar coverage and a Tough Claws boost while being much more dependable because of its perfect accuracy at the cost of being less powerful. Superpower is the preferred move in the third slot, as it's capable of OHKOing offensive Normal-types such as Tauros and Kangaskhan as well as hitting Ferroseed, which resists both of Barbaracle's STAB attacks, super effectively; however, Earthquake is another option that hits Garbodor for super effective damage and does not come with the drawback of lowering Barbaracle's stats. Switcheroo allows Barbaracle to switch items with its target, potentially crippling a defensive Pokemon such as Vileplume, Gourgeist, or Gastrodon, which are common switch-ins to the Shell Smash set, by preventing it from recovering or making it setup bait for a teammate.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs maximize Barbaracle's Speed and Attack to make it as effective an attacker as possible. Choice Scarf makes Barbaracle a fearsome revenge killer, combining its impressive power with the ability to outspeed the entire unboosted tier. An Adamant nature can be used to improve Barbaracle's attacking power; however, it will fail to outpace key threats such as Floatzel and Swellow without a Jolly nature. Tough Claws is easily Barbaracle's best ability, as it significantly boosts the power of its contact moves, particularly Razor Shell and Superpower.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Barbaracle works best as a late-game cleaner due to the high Speed afforded by Choice Scarf, so try to conserve it for late in the game when its checks have been sufficiently weakened. Barbaracle should attempt to bluff a Shell Smash set by coming in and threatening out foes that it can reliably KO and outspeed. Be wary of locking Barbaracle into a move that the opponent can take advantage of, such as Razor Shell when they have a Poliwrath, as it can result in a considerable loss of momentum; this also applies to Superpower, which should only be used against Pokemon that will not be KOed by one of Barbaracle's STAB attacks. Barbaracle should attempt to use Switcheroo against defensively oriented teams, as it can cripple them, gain momentum, and free itself up to threaten the opposing team accordingly. Be wary of using Switcheroo against Pokemon with unfavorable items, such as Weezing's and Vileplume's Black Sludge, as getting inflicted with passive damage throughout the match effectively cripples Barbaracle and cuts into its longevity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Barbaracle's combination of high Speed and power will inevitably force almost constant switches, Spikes support is crucial to punish the opponent even if they predict correctly. Pokemon such as Garbodor and Ferroseed provide Spikes while having decent type synergy with Barbaracle. Barbaracle will often be locked into a commonly resisted move such as Stone Edge or Earthquake, forcing it to switch out; therefore, pairing it with bulky Pokemon that can pivot repeatedly into attacks, such as Weezing and bulky Scyther, is ideal. The former can also provide Toxic Spikes to take advantage of the many switches Barbaracle forces, while the latter provides phenomenal synergy and can conserve momentum with its powerful U-turn. Offensive Ghost-types such as Rotom and Mismagius make for great partners, as they resist nearly all of Barbaracle's weaknesses and can break through or cripple the physically defensive Pokemon such as Mega Audino and Ferroseed that give it trouble. Grass-types such as Lilligant and Ludicolo can deal with Gastrodon and Poliwrath, which resist Barbaracle's STAB combination, as well as other bulky Water-types. Cacturne in particular can deal with Gastrodon while also providing Spikes support. Mesprit, Xatu, and other Psychic-types can switch into Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Hitmonchan as well as heavily pressuring Poison-types such as Garbodor, Weezing, and Vileplume, which clears the way for Barbaracle to clean.</p>"

  "Aurorus": {
    "overview": "<p>Aurorus's movepool and abilities cement its position as one of the most fearsome wallbreakers in the tier. It has Refrigerate to bolster its strong Normal-type moves and Snow Warning for a perfectly accurate Blizzard, giving it very strong Ice-type attacks to pound foes with. Aurorus's access to Freeze-Dry makes it incredibly reliable for breaking bulky cores that rely on their resistances as opposed to sheer bulk. Aurorus also boasts a large number of coverage options that let it handle almost any other obstacle, with its Ground-type attacks forming perfect neutral coverage alongside Aurorus's Ice-type moves. However, Aurorus's typing plagues it with common weaknesses to Fighting-, Water-, Grass-, and Ground-type moves, which when coupled with its mediocre Speed make it rather easy to revenge kill.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band Aurorus is a very viable alternative, as Aurorus has the movepool for such a set, containing moves like Return, Facade, Earthquake, Zen Headbutt, and even Aqua Tail, with its main draws being that it acts as a powerful physical wallbreaker with strong super effective and neutral coverage and doesn't care about burns. However, the metagame is more prepared for physical attackers in general, and Choice Band Aurorus is somewhat reliant on boosted Facade to exceed the crazily high damage output that Choice Specs Aurorus has.</p> <p>Life Orb is an alternative to a Choice item, but Aurorus heavily dislikes being worn down. Icicle Plate can boost Aurorus's main attacks, but its main attacks are already so easily spammed that being Choice-locked is of little consequence to Aurorus, not to mention the item does not boost Aurorus's coverage moves. Choice Scarf Snow Warning Aurorus can shut down weather sweepers, but its inability to outspeed Floatzel really hurts its overall revenge killing potential. Icy Rock can be used to prolong the duration of hail, but simply using Abomasnow alongside Aurorus is probably more practical than reducing Aurorus's offensive potential.</p> <p>Aurorus has access to Rock Polish, but it is difficult to set up due to Aurorus's low Speed and numerous weaknesses, and its weakness to priority moves such as Mach Punch, Aqua Jet, and Bullet Punch makes it hard to sustain the sweep. Flash Cannon on the Choice Specs set cleanly 2HKOes Piloswine and OHKOes Jynx half of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-type Attacks</strong>: Fighting-types such as Primeape, Hitmonchan, Poliwrath, and Combusken can threaten Aurorus with their STAB moves. Even non-Fighting-type Pokemon such as Zangoose, Garbodor, Magmortar, and Jynx can do major damage with moves like Close Combat, Drain Punch, and Focus Blast. Hitmonchan also happens to be one of the few entry hazard removers to not fear Stealth Rock Aurorus. Hariyama and Malamar can tank a hit or two from Aurorus and KO it with Close Combat and Superpower, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Thick Fat Pokemon</strong>: Thick Fat users such as Piloswine, Hariyama, Grumpig, and Miltank boasting a resistance to both Aurorus's powerful Ice-type attacks and Freeze-Dry and are not overly vulnerable to Aurorus's common attacking options, and all four have access to super effective moves to hit Aurorus with. Hariyama has to watch out for the occasional Psychic or even physical set, and Miltank wants heavy Special Defense investment to tank Aurorus's hits.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Attacks</strong>: Few Steel-types want to actually take Aurorus's attacks, but Steelix, Ferroseed, and Klinklang can usually survive one blow and retaliate for a surefire OHKO. Klinklang boasts being the ability to OHKO Focus Sash Aurorus as well by virtue of Gear Grind. Steel-type moves are not common on non-Steel-type Pokemon, but Bullet Punch Hariyama and Iron Head or Iron Tail Tauros can prove bothersome.</p> <p><strong>Faster Water-types</strong>: Samurott, Kabutops, Ludicolo, Poliwrath, and Barbaracle can drown Aurorus with their powerful Water-type STAB moves, but all of them must be wary of Freeze-Dry. Poliwrath and the Rock / Water-types do especially well at answering the occasional physical set.</p> <p><strong>Faster Grass-types</strong>: The likes of Lilligant, Shiftry, and Ludicolo outspeed Aurorus and can deal some major damage with their STAB attacks. Be warned that Aurorus's special bulk does allow it to survive Life Orb-boosted Giga Drain from full health, and, of course, none of these Pokemon want to switch into Aurorus's STAB moves. While not all Abomasnow run enough Speed investment to outrun Aurorus, some do carry Soundproof, meaning the risk of them switching into Hyper Voice for free is very real.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Refrigerate Hyper Voice is very strong and can penetrate Substitutes as well. Blizzard is the move of choice if Aurorus chooses Snow Warning, and it slightly outdamages Refrigerate Hyper Voice factoring in hail damage. Freeze-Dry smacks Water-types such Lanturn, Gorebyss, and Mantine, OHKOing the last, usually making it the safest move to lock into and throw out against bulkier cores. It also deters the likes of Samurott and Poliwrath from trying to switch into Aurorus and threaten it out. Earth Power allows Aurorus to OHKO Pyroar, Eviolite Combusken, and Klinklang, as well as 2HKO Assault Vest Magmortar and opposing Aurorus. Frost Breath allows Aurorus to break through Calm Mind users such as Mega Audino and Musharna. Psychic is an option to hit Hariyama, although that is the extent of its usefulness.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment with a Modest nature maximizes Aurorus's damage output. Maximum Speed investment is used to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, but a Timid nature should not be considered, as it doesn't allow Aurorus to outspeed anything relevant. The remaining EVs should not be placed into HP, as that would only allow Aurorus to switch into Stealth Rock three times. Choice Specs gives Aurorus tremendous power, boosting its wallbreaking potential; it also helps facilitate Aurorus's hit-and-run role, allowing Aurorus to deal as much damage as possible in one blow before being forced out.</p> <p>If Aurorus's teammates are hindered by hail (primarily Synthesis or Moonlight users, weather sweepers, and Sturdy users), Refrigerate is the safer, no-drawback ability to use. If your team isn't too heavily affected by hail or benefits from hail's disruption against the opposing team, Snow Warning can be used.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Aurorus's low Speed and exploitable typing, it mainly functions as a hit-and-run Pokemon. It usually uses a combination of its resistances and decent bulk to switch into foes like Weezing, Scyther, Haunter, Xatu, Articuno, and Choice Specs Swellow. From there, Aurorus can usually just click its most powerful Ice-type attack to shred the opponent's team, unless there is a particularly bulky foe that warrants the use of its other attacks. Although Aurorus can punch sizable holes into teams at any stage in the game, it should usually be used early-game to maximize wallbreaking opportunities. While Aurorus doesn't require entry hazard control to function, keeping Stealth Rock off its side of the field is helpful to preserve Aurorus's health, as it switches in and out often. Snow Warning has additional utility, as it allows Aurorus to disrupt the recovery of Vileplume, Gourgeist, and Musharna and proceed to threaten them with its powerful Ice-type moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Aurorus pairs excellently with Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Combusken and Primeape, as Aurorus can easily threaten the likes of Weezing, Gourgeist-Super, Vileplume, Musharna, Xatu, Swellow, and Pelipper and boasts the ability to switch in on most of them. In return, the Fighting-types do away with Steel- and Rock-types that may threaten Aurorus and help improve Aurorus's matchup against faster teams.</p> <p>Fighting-types also happen to be Aurorus's greatest enemies, as they easily force it out; Pokemon such as Mesprit, Xatu, Weezing, Vileplume, Pelipper, and Musharna are examples of good teammates that can switch into said Fighting-types. VoltTurn support from the likes of Scyther, Primeape, Rotom, and Swellow is nice to get Aurorus into battle safely or against a favorable matchup.</p> <p>While not necessary, Pokemon that can remove or prevent Stealth Rock can make for favorable teammates; in particular, Hitmonchan is yet another Fighting-type that benefits from Aurorus's wallbreaking, whereas Xatu and Pelipper cover many of Aurorus's weaknesses. Because Aurorus is slow and usually only threatens bulky Pokemon, fast attackers or setup sweepers are helpful to patch up Aurorus's weakness to faster teams. The likes of Tauros, Swellow, Scyther, Shiftry, and Lilligant fit the bill, with a few of them also covering some of Aurorus's weaknesses; in return all of them appreciate Aurorus's ability to pressure most of their checks. Aurorus also likes partners that can provide speed control, such as Thunder Wave Xatu, Stun Spore Vileplume, and Tailwind Swellow.</p> <p>If running Snow Warning Aurorus, it is important to note which Pokemon can benefit or get hindered from Hail. Rotom-F becomes an interesting teammate, as it can switch into Ground-type moves and its sole Ice-type STAB move in Blizzard becomes perfectly accurate. For the latter reason, Aurorus's teammates may consider Blizzard over Ice Beam as coverage moves. Some teammates may adapt around hail, such as Magic Guard Kadabra and Clefairy, whereas Pokemon that rely on weather for recovery, such as Vileplume, Gourgeist-Super, and Musharna, may not be advisable as teammates at all.</p>"
      },
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Aurorus makes for a decent Stealth Rock user as few entry hazard removers would dare attempt to remove Stealth Rock in front of it, much less stay in. Blizzard is Aurorus's best attack and allows Aurorus to anti-lead by OHKOing most other Focus Sash leads as well as threaten entry hazard removers such as Xatu, Shiftry, and Claydol. Freeze-Dry allows Aurorus to hit Water-types, particularly Defog users such as Pelipper, Prinplup, and Mantine, as well as Rapid Spin Kabutops. Rock Tomb is crucial for its Speed-lowering effect and is favored over Icy Wind for its additional coverage against Fire-types, particularly Assault Vest Magmortar, and Jynx, which also lessens the need for Earth Power.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed with a Speed-boosting nature allows Aurorus to set up Stealth Rock on as many foes as possible before it risks being KOed, as well as outspeed everything up to Tauros after a Rock Tomb. A Hasty nature is used over Timid to preserve Rock Tomb's power, and it is used over Naive nature because Aurorus's special bulk is still salvageable, whereas altering Aurorus's Defense stat does not affect its ability to withstand the physical hits it can or cannot take. 32 Attack EVs let Rock Tomb cleanly 2HKO Assault Vest Magmortar and nearly guarantee the 2HKO on Pyroar after hail damage, assuming Pyroar has not taken Life Orb recoil. The remaining EVs go into Special Attack to power up Blizzard and Freeze-Dry. Focus Sash guarantees that Aurorus will get to use Rock Tomb or set up Stealth Rock. Snow Warning helps to disrupt any other Focus Sash suicide leads, and the chip damage can increase Aurorus's chances of KOing the foe with Blizzard after using Rock Tomb.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aurorus plays the role as a dedicated offensive lead on the team that gives little leeway for the opponent to gain ground, especially with its ability to ward off entry hazard removers. This by extension means Aurorus functions like a suicide lead, so it does not need to be preserved. Aurorus can set up Stealth Rock against a slower foe and proceed with attacking as usual.</p> <p>If Aurorus is up against a faster foe not exceeding base 110 Speed and lacking priority moves, Aurorus should lead off with Rock Tomb to slow the foe down; this gives Aurorus more flexibility and wriggle room when deciding its next course of action. If Aurorus's Focus Sash is still intact, it should try to KO its target, as it can set up Stealth Rock on the next foe anyway by repeating the process. If Aurorus has taken damage or cannot immediately KO its foe, it can just set up Stealth Rock and let its teammates revenge kill the slowed threat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Aurorus best fits on offensive teams, which best capitalize on its efficient Stealth Rock setup or early damage. Ghost-types such as Rotom, Haunter, Golurk, and Mismagius can block Rapid Spin, making them great teammates. Offensive Garbodor is an interesting partner; it can set up Spikes to complement Aurorus's Stealth Rock, cover for it against priority attacks, and even use Explosion to prevent the foe from using Defog or Rapid Spin. Aurorus's other teammates should aim to keep the offensive pressure up and give no room for the opponent to try to clear Stealth Rock; Pokemon like Swellow, Jynx, Tauros, Pyroar, Barbaracle, Gorebyss, and Shiftry are such examples of powerful Pokemon with immediate offensive presence.</p>"

  "Sliggoo": {
    "overview": "<p>As far as special tanks go in NU, Sliggoo manages to hold its own thanks to a number of desirable traits, notably its unique mono-Dragon typing in conjunction with high special bulk, which enables it to check a myriad of threatening special attackers such as Magmortar, Rotom, and Life Orb Samurott. Sap Sipper furthers Sliggoo's walling capabilities, letting it serve as a hard counter to Lilligant without Hidden Power Ice, one of NU's most fearsome Pokemon, as well as granting it the ability to switch into Sleep Powder from the likes of Lilligant and Vivillon. Curse is another one of Sliggoo's main draws when compared to other special tanks in NU, as it is incredibly difficult to take down should it accumulate several boosts. Alternatively, Sliggoo can fulfill the role of an offensive tank thanks to a wide offensive movepool with a powerful STAB option in Draco Meteor and decent Special Attack to complement. However, Sliggoo relies on Eviolite in order to effectively switch into special attackers, making it vulnerable to the ever-present Knock Off and, to a lesser extent, Trick. Sliggoo also tends to take away offensive momentum from the team due to the nature of Rest + Sleep Talk. Lackluster Defense proves to be cumbersome as well, and somewhat difficult to manage in a metagame with influential physical attackers such as Kangaskhan, Tauros, and Rhydon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Slide can be used to deal a great amount of damage to Charizard, which can prove very helpful for taking on bulkier variants that are able to take Muddy Water. RestTalk with two attacks is also an option that lets Sliggoo immediately threaten a Pokemon such as Charizard with Rock Slide, but doing so foregoes Curse. Toxic can be used to cripple Musharna and non-Heal Bell Mega Audino, but it serves little use outside of that. Hidden Power Fire can be used on offensive sets to target Ferroseed in particular. Protect can used on the offensive set to scout the next move of a Choice item user such as Scyther or Rotom.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Mega Audino and Clefairy both wall Sliggoo's Curse set by virtue of their typing making them immune to Outrage and take a pittance from Sludge Bomb from offensive variants thanks to their massive special bulk. Both can use Sliggoo to freely set up Calm Mind or support their own team by using Heal Bell and spreading status.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types such as Aurorus, Abomasnow, and Jynx can easily pierce through Sliggoo's high Special Defense thanks to their respective STAB attacks, though all of them do not appreciate switching into Draco Meteor or a boosted Outrage.</p> <p><strong>Eviolite Removal</strong>: Knock Off users such as Scyther, Hariyama, and Gurdurr are all able to remove Sliggoo's Eviolite, making it much more vulnerable to attacks that it'd normally have little issue taking such as Ice Beam from Life Orb Samurott. Trick works even better in this regard because Sliggoo loathes being locked into a move, neutralizing its Curse set in particular.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt from the likes of Mismagius, Skuntank, and Haunter stops Curse Sliggoo cold, as it cannot restore lost HP with Rest or set up with Curse and can only lock itself into Outrage, which is easily taken advantage of.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Curse lets Sliggoo act as a bulky setup sweeper, making it increasingly difficult to break past with physical attacks. Outrage packs quite a punch after Sliggoo has gotten a couple Curse boosts under its belt. It also doesn't lock Sliggoo into the move if it's drawn by Sleep Talk. Rest lets Sliggoo stays healthy throughout the game and keeps it free of otherwise harmful status ailments such as poison and burn, while Sleep Talk ensures that Sliggoo is still functional during the turns when it's asleep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given HP and Special Defense EVs plus Eviolite grant Sliggoo enough special bulk to avoid the 3HKO from both Samurott's and Ludicolo's Ice Beam, as well as the 2HKO from Focus Sash Jynx's Ice Beam, while the rest goes into Defense to let it avoid the 3HKO from Tauros' Rock Climb after one Curse. Sap Sipper is chosen for the very useful immunity to Grass-type moves it provides, notably Sleep Powder, making Sliggoo a particularly good switch-in for Lilligant and Vivillon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Sliggoo's slew of useful resistances to pivot into the likes of Magmortar, Lilligant, and Samurott. Just be sure to scout for Samurott's set first because Sliggoo is overwhelmed by Swords Dance variants. Sap Sipper gives Sliggoo additional opportunities to enter the battle by letting it freely switch into Sleep Powder users if necessary and net a free Attack boost, making its Outrage pack more of a punch. Should Sliggoo get at half of its HP or lower, use Rest to bring it back to full health so it can stay healthy to check the Pokemon it needs to. Sleep Talk should always be used during the turns Sliggoo is asleep to ensure it doesn't stay completely passive. However, in some cases when Sliggoo needs to PP stall a Pokemon such as Quagsire, it's best to not click Sleep Talk to preserve PP. When awake, try to avoid being locked into Outrage, as this can put Sliggoo into unfavorable situations. Curse should generally be saved for when Sliggoo's checks, especially Fairy-types, are eliminated, as it cannot sweep otherwise. Usually, the best course of action when against Fairy-types is to double switch out to a teammate that can threaten them. If Sliggoo has set up some Curses prior, it can also beat Steelix one-on-one and eventually start wearing it down with boosted Outrages.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steelix is a fantastic teammate, as it switches in on Mega Audino, Clefairy, and Klinklang with little issue, all of which otherwise wall and set up on Sliggoo. In return, Sliggoo takes on most special attackers that threaten Steelix, such as Pyroar, Magmortar, and Samurott. Ferroseed functions in a similar fashion, but it provides more utility in the form of Spikes, Knock Off, and Leech Seed, chipping away at foes, while Sliggoo can easily switch into and defeat Fire-types as well as non-Calm Mind variants of Xatu. Quagsire is able to switch in on physical sweepers such as Klinklang, Barbaracle, and Malamar, all of which can significantly damage Sliggoo due to its lacking Defense before it sets up Curse. In return, Sliggoo is a superb switch-in to Grass-types, which heavily threaten Quagsire. Just note that these two are pressured by the likes of Choice Band Primeape and Shiftry, the former of which can 2HKO Quagsire with Close Combat and the latter can Knock Off Sliggoo's Eviolite while threatening to OHKO Quagsire with a Grass-type move, so pairing these up with a sturdy Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Weezing, Mesprit, or Xatu works best. While Mesprit and Xatu cannot directly switch into Shiftry safely, they often run Colbur Berry and can act as a one time check to Shiftry.</p> <p>Weezing is a good partner due to its ability to switch into and shut down defensive variants of Mega Audino with Taunt while also serving as a solid response to Fighting-types, a good majority of which can heavily damage Sliggoo with their powerful STAB moves or Knock Off its Eviolite, hindering its ability to tank attacks. Mega Audino serves as a Knock Off absorber and, depending on its EV spread, can switch into several Pokemon that can threaten Sliggoo such as Aurorus, Jynx, Gurdurr, and Hariyama. On more balanced teams, Magmortar works well with Sliggoo, as it switches into most Ice-types that threaten to break past it such as Jynx, Aurorus, and Vanilluxe, while in return, Sliggoo handles specially based Water-types that can revenge kill Magmortar.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Sliggoo's strongest STAB move and does good damage versus most neutral targets, but it has the downside of cuttings its Special Attack in half. Sludge Bomb ensures Sliggoo is not a free opportunity for Fairy-types to switch in and deals reliable damage against the likes of Lilligant and Ludicolo. Muddy Water primarily targets Steelix, which otherwise switches comfortably into all of Sliggoo's attacks, and has the added bonus of nailing Rhydon, Charizard, Magmortar, and Pyroar. Thunderbolt hits bulky Water-types, most notably Mantine and Pelipper as well as Prinplup, Samurott, and Poliwrath. Dragon Pulse can be used as a more reliable, albeit weaker, STAB attack that doesn't come with the downside of dropping Sliggoo's Special Attack. Rest can be used to bring Sliggoo back to full HP, which is especially helpful if it still needs to be healthy to pivot into Grass-types and other special attackers. Just note that during the two turns Sliggoo is asleep, it will remain completely passive.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Speed EVs let Sliggoo outspeed Jolly Rhydon and below, while maximum Special Attack EVs plus a Modest nature let it hit as hard as possible. The remaining EVs go into HP to provide complementary bulk. Eviolite is used to give Sliggoo a significant increase to both of its defensive stats, letting it switch into Pokemon such as Magmortar and Lilligant much more comfortably. Sap Sipper gives Sliggoo an immunity to Grass-type attacks, notably making it immune to Sleep Powder.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Sliggoo's set of resistances and ability to pivot into special attackers such as Lilligant, Magmortar, and Rotom. Don't bring Sliggoo in haphazardly, however, as it has no reliable means of restoring damage taken. Thanks to Sap Sipper, Sliggoo also acts a great sleep absorber, and alongside its high special bulk with Eviolite, it switches into the likes of Vivillon and Lilligant with ease. Once brought in, it's generally best to use Draco Meteor if the opponent has no Dragon-resistant Pokemon on their team. Be careful when using the move, however, as the Special Attack drop can leave Sliggoo setup bait for Pokemon such as Klinklang. Respond to Dragon-resistant Pokemon such as Steelix or Klinklang by hitting them with Muddy Water, which 2HKOes the former and keeps the latter from freely setting up Substitute. Stay away from powerful physical attackers, especially those with Knock Off, as most of them are able to heavily damage Sliggoo to the point where it can no longer reliably switch in on the Pokemon it's supposed to check.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is more suited for balanced and bulky offensive teams because it's played more aggressively and does not forfeit offensive momentum. Magmortar works well with Sliggoo, as it's able to switch into Ice-types that threaten to heavily damage Sliggoo, such as Aurorus and Jynx, while Sliggoo pivots into the likes of Life Orb Samurott, Ludicolo, and Floatzel. Steelix switches in on Mega Audino and Musharna, both of which can use Sliggoo to freely set up Calm Mind, while Sliggoo is able to switch on Fire- and Water-type attacks aimed at Steelix. Klinklang functions in a similar manner, though it loses to Barrier variants of Musharna and finds itself struggling to set up Shift Gear against Audino carrying Fire Blast. Weezing and defensive Mesprit both are capable of switching in on Fighting-types that threaten Sliggoo, with the former also being able to switch in on and shut down the likes of Mega Audino and Clefairy, while the latter is capable of bringing Sliggoo back to full health with Healing Wish. Kabutops and Samurott both appreciate Sliggoo's ability to pivot into and weaken faster Grass-types that can otherwise stop their sweep such as Lilligant. Rhydon appreciates Sliggoo's ability to switch into Grass- and Water-type attacks, while in return, Rhydon can use Musharna and non-Surf variants of Audino to set up either Rock Polish or Swords Dance. Mega Audino pairs well with Sliggoo, as it absorbs Knock Off and can restore Sliggoo's HP by passing a Wish to it, fixing the set's issue with being worn down.</p>"

  "Trevenant": {
    "overview": "<p>Trevenant boasts a high Attack stat with decent dual STAB options, which can hit many slower Pokemon in the tier for good damage. It is also backed up by decent coverage such as Earthquake and Rock Slide, giving it solid neutral coverage on the metagame. Natural Cure makes Trevenant a passable status absorber, especially with its resistance to Scald. However, Trevenant is slow, and it's not bulky enough to make up for it. Its numerous weaknesses to common attacking types such as Fire, Ice, Dark, Flying, and Ghost leave it easily revenge killed by many attackers and vulnerable to various coverage moves, which makes it a poor check to Normal- and Fighting-types, such as Tauros, Hitmonchan, and Hariyama. Although Trevenant has good resistances, it is largely outclassed in defensive and supportive roles by Gourgeist-XL, which has superior physical bulk and reliable recovery in Synthesis. Even with its supposed offensive niche, it still competes with Torterra as a Grass-type hole puncher due to the latter's superior resistances, bulk, and stronger STAB moves, although Trevenant's Ghost-typing does give Trevenant mild spinblocking abilities and different neutral STAB coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest could be considered alongside Natural Cure to give Trevenant effectively a Full Restore, but this forces Trevenant out when it has issues entering battle to begin with, and it doesn't really help Trevenant much more than Horn Leech's recovery would, when considering that Trevenant is not difficult to KO. Trevenant is one of the few self-sufficient Trick Room attackers in the tier, as it has high power and effective neutral coverage to attempt a sweep. However, Trevenant's average bulk and exploitable defensive typing gives it few safe setup opportunities, and its reliance on Wood Hammer for damage output heavily dwindles its longevity as well as its chances at maintaining the sweep.</p> <p>The large majority of Trevenant's gimmick potential comes from its Harvest sets, where it is capable of making use of a wide variety of Berries. Lum Berry allows Trevenant to absorb status, particularly from bulky Water- and Psychic-type Pokemon, and gives it a drawback-free Rest, but Trevenant doesn't have the bulk and typing necessary to take on many of the offensive attackers and even some of the status-inducing Pokemon of the tier, making its instant recovery much less valuable. Starf Berry gives a random +2 boost to one of Trevenant's stats, most notably including evasion, when Trevenant is below 25% health. Combined with Substitute, the luck-of-the-draw element of this set can either allow Trevenant to sweep the foe with little to no opposition or completely fall flat on its face as it gains useless boosts. Substitute + Leech Seed alongside Sitrus Berry sounds annoying to beat but is inefficient compared to Trevenant's other sets and stopped rather easily by the likes of Taunt Skuntank, pierced by sound-based moves from Scrappy Swellow and Refrigerate Aurorus, and outright shut down by Unnerve Pyroar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Poison-types</strong>: Weezing and Vileplume are rather hard counters to Trevenant, taking on all of the Choice Band set's attacks with relative ease and either outlasting it, crippling it, or beating it one-on-one. While these Pokemon dislike Trick, Trevenant also dislikes Black Sludge further limiting the number of Wood Hammers it can use before it succumbs to recoil. Garbodor can be a nuisance for Trevenant, as it can punish most of Trevenant's attacks with Rocky Helmet and hurt it with Gunk Shot, though it has to be wary of Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Sap Sipper Miltank</strong>: Miltank is barely scratched by any of Trevenant's common moves and can easily heal off any damage taken. However, Miltank might lack a way of actually hurting Trevenant back and is one of the few Trevenant answers that are badly crippled by Trick.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Skuntank is a major thorn in Trevenant's side, as its resistance to Trevenant's dual STAB types as well as its access to Taunt and Pursuit can shut down most Trevenant sets. Shiftry also resists Trevenant's STAB types and easily threatens the OHKO with Knock Off. Liepard has a much harder time switching in but can still threaten Trevenant with Knock Off or Pursuit. However, these Dark-types are physically frail and dislike eating hits from Choice Band Trevenant, as Wood Hammer cleanly 2HKOes Skuntank through its resistance.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types resist Grass and can easily revenge kill Trevenant, making them decent initial switch-ins. Pyroar receives a special mention due to its Ghost immunity, although Choice Band-boosted Wood Hammer can still 2HKO Pyroar and Earthquake drops it in one blow. Charizard 4x resists Grass, and bulky sets can stomach Shadow Claws, although Rock Slide will demolish Charizard with ease. Magmortar and Combusken have more difficulty finding safe switch-ins, but otherwise they still make for good checks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: While Trevenant is not the easiest Pokemon to switch into, it is one of the easiest Pokemon to force out due to its poor Speed and plentiful weaknesses. There are a multitude of Pokemon that can pick off Trevenant, such as Scyther, Archeops, Jynx, Rotom, Vivillon, Abomasnow, Haunter, and the aforementioned Dark- and Fire-type Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Coverage moves</strong>: Trevenant has a hard enough time against the large majority of fast attackers in the metagame, but limiting Trevenant's safe switches only curbs its presence even further, which isn't hard due to Trevenant's many exploitable weaknesses. Examples include Knock Off Gurdurr, Knock Off Hariyama, Ice Punch Hitmonchan, Fire Blast Tauros, Ice Beam Water-types, and Heat Wave Xatu.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wood Hammer is Trevenant's strongest STAB move, 2HKOing a majority of Pokemon that don't resist it and even some of the frailer ones that do, such as Magmortar, Swellow, and Pyroar, although it comes with hefty recoil damage. Shadow Claw is Trevenant's next best STAB option, with its better neutral coverage making it a decent move to throw out. It is also Trevenant's strongest attack against Psychic-types, particularly Xatu. Earthquake OHKOes Skuntank and Pyroar switch-ins, takes out Garbodor without making contact, and can hurt Steel-types such as Steelix and Aggron more efficiently. Rock Slide targets bulky Flying-types, such as Eviolite Scyther and Swords Dance Charizard, which can otherwise prove bothersome checks. Horn Leech is an alternative Grass-type STAB move for Trevenant to use that restores health instead of depleting it like Wood Hammer, making it decent for extending Trevenant's longevity.</p> <p>Trick can be used to cripple the likes of Weezing, Vileplume, and Ferroseed while allowing Trevenant to switch up moves, although its attacks do lose substantial power upon doing so and Tricking Choice Band doesn't cripple many of Trevenant's checks. The aforementioned Poison-types might be holding Black Sludge as well, which puts pressure on Trevenant to Trick it away immediately, as it has horrible synergy with Wood Hammer. X-Scissor has mild use in skewering Malamar as well as OHKOing Shiftry switch-ins, though it doesn't hit much outside of that.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Trevenant to outspeed and threaten as much as possible, most notably Jolly Rhydon, Malamar, Adamant Golurk, and Adamant Aggron. An Adamant nature further increases Trevenant's damage output, while a Jolly nature allows Trevenant to outspeed Pokemon such as Modest Aurorus, Timid Omastar, Jolly Aggron, and opposing Adamant Trevenant if any of these are of concern. Choice Band bolsters Trevenant's power to the point where even resisted Wood Hammer does substantial damage to frailer Pokemon that resist Grass while suiting its hit-and-run attacking style. Natural Cure allows Trevenant to take on status users without fear, particularly letting it not being permanently crippled by Scald burns.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Trevenant would preferably switch in on an attack it either resists or is immune to, such as Rhydon's Earthquake, Samurott's Waterfall or Aqua Jet, or Tauros's Rock Climb, or a status move from Pokemon that don't immediately threaten it, such as Toxic from Gastrodon or Thunder Wave from Musharna and non-Heat Wave Xatu. Alternatively, VoltTurn support from the likes of Swellow, Archeops, and Manectric can allow Trevenant to enter battle safely. Be wary of switching into Scald; even with Natural Cure ensuring Trevenant won't stay crippled, being burned on the switch means Trevenant would struggle to threaten the opponent's switch-ins. Once it enters battle, Trevenant should choose the move most capable of punching a hole through the opponent's team. Usually this move is Wood Hammer, as it has enough power to 2HKO, if not OHKO after Stealth Rock damage, the likes of Skuntank, Pyroar, Swellow, and Shiftry, which would be the opponent's most likely switch-ins given their resistance to both of Trevenant's STAB moves. However, Trevenant's low Speed and bad weaknesses mean it gets forced out really easily after using an attack or getting a KO, so it might be wise to go for the move with the most immediate results, which is when the other attacks and prediction come into play.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>VoltTurn teams allow Trevenant to enter battle without having to risk taking a direct hit and often absorb status moves or resisted attacks aimed at the VoltTurn users. VoltTurn Pokemon are also speedy, which helps cover for Trevenant's awful matchup against offensive teams. Flying-types such as Swellow, Archeops, and Scyther can use U-turn to pivot into Trevenant on various status moves and appreciate Trevenant threatening Ground- and Rock-types as well as softening up Steel-types for them. Primeape can U-turn away from Psychic-type switch-ins, such as Musharna and Xatu, for Trevenant to prey on, while Trevenant can cripple Poison-types with Earthquake or Trick. Lanturn and Manectric make for appealing Volt Switch teammates for Trevenant, as they can handle most Flying-type Pokemon, as well as Fire-type Pokemon in Lanturn's case, while Trevenant easily takes advantage of opposing Lanturn, Gastrodon, and Rhydon while also luring in and denting bulky Grass-types. Fire-types also can synergize well with Trevenant, as they offer speed, great offensive presence, and the ability to threaten most Pokemon that resist Grass, such as Vileplume, Weezing, and Scyther, which deter Trevenant from throwing out Wood Hammers. Trevenant meanwhile absorbs status for them and resists or otherwise covers for most of their weaknesses, including Pyroar's Fighting weakness and Combusken's Psychic weakness. Floatzel can be a good teammate for Trevenant, as it can revenge kill many of the Pokemon that would threaten Trevenant, while Trevenant can switch into Lanturn and Gastrodon and threaten them with powerful attacks, although switching into the former can be risky if they can Volt Switch into a Pursuit trapper.</p>"

  "Gourgeist-Super": {
    "overview": "<p>Gourgeist-XL is one of the physically bulkiest Pokemon in NU, which is further augmented by its defensive typing, allowing it to easily wall the physical Fighting-, Ground-, and Water-types of the tier. This allows Gourgeist-XL to fend off the likes of Rhydon and physical Samurott, which are some of the biggest threats to slower balance teams. Gourgeist-XL's access to Will-O-Wisp and Synthesis also makes it very challenging to break for most physical attackers in general. However, common weaknesses to Fire, Ice, and Ghost render Gourgeist-XL vulnerable to many special attackers in the tier, such as Pyroar, Abomasnow, and Mismagius, and it has mediocre offensive presence due to its unimpressive physical movepool and its Special Attack being too low to properly make use of its superior special movepool. Gourgeist-XL's recovery can be nerfed by Snow Warning, of which both users in Abomasnow and Aurorus can make for well-timed switch-ins into Synthesis and massively threaten it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Sneak can be used to ward off fast Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Rotom, Haunter, Jynx, and Mismagius, although it is not strong enough to OHKO any of them and definitely not enough to be used as a main attack. Access to moves such as Trick and Explosion is enough to consider a Choice Band set and catch foes off guard, but such a set still makes a lackluster attacker overall. Gourgeist-XL does not make for a bad setter of Trick Room due to its high physical bulk and access to Explosion, although Trick Room itself isn't a very consistent playstyle. Gourgeist-XL's special movepool has several interesting attacks such as superior STAB moves, Focus Blast, Psychic, and Fire Blast, but they are all rather weak due to Gourgeist-XL's poor Special Attack and are largely unnecessary.</p> <p>Running Worry Seed is an alternative to Skill Swapping Insomnia onto foes such as Malamar and Mega Audino, and it does not require Gourgeist-XL to switch back out to retain the ability to prevent them from using Rest. However, Skill Swap has more usefulness overall, particularly against Xatu. Phantom Force is Gourgeist-XL's strongest Ghost-type attack and can be used to stall an extra turn of burn or Leech Seed damage. However, the charging turn can be exploited, particularly by dangerous Normal-types such as Pyroar and Swellow.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Pyroar, Charizard, Magmortar, and Combusken can switch into the majority of Gourgeist-XL's moves and KO it with super effective STAB Fire-type moves. Do note that Pyroar, Magmortar, and especially Charizard dislike taking Rock Slide on the switch, whereas Combusken's threat level to Gourgeist-XL's teammates is greatly reduced if it is hit by Skill Swap on the switch. None of them appreciate getting hit with Leech Seed on the switch either, as they can get pressured, especially if Stealth Rock is on their side of the field.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Rotom, Haunter, and Mismagius can easily threaten Gourgeist-XL with their super effective STAB Ghost-type moves. They have a trickier time switching in safely due to their general physical frailty and lack of an immunity to Will-O-Wisp, but they can usually switch in directly at least once, even into Foul Play thanks to their low Attack stats. They must be cautious of the occasional Shadow Sneak, however.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Abomasnow, Jynx, and Aurorus have powerful STAB Ice-type moves that make short work of Gourgeist-XL, but they have issues switching in safely. The latter two dislike switching into any of Gourgeist-XL's damaging moves, and while Abomasnow resists Seed Bomb, it dislikes getting its Ice Shard weakened by a burn. Snow Warning from Aurorus and Abomasnow can help to greatly limit Gourgeist-XL's recovery.</p> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu gives Gourgeist-XL a hard time, as its mere presence discourages Gourgeist-XL from using Will-O-Wisp lest it accidentally burn itself. Even then, Xatu usually has the upper hand against Gourgeist-XL due to Heat Wave, as well as its fast Roost temporarily nullifying Rock Slide's effectiveness. Skill Swap does allow Gourgeist-XL to fight back to an extent, enabling it to burn Xatu with Will-O-Wisp and whittle it down.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt disables Gourgeist-XL's method of recovery and crippling its foes, which can leave it very vulnerable. Weezing and Skuntank are two Taunt users that utterly shut Gourgeist-XL down, whereas other users such as Mismagius and Samurott usually use it to ensure Gourgeist-XL is not able to recover or burn them.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: While Gourgeist-XL has a great matchup against the majority of the physical attackers in the metagame, it doesn't have a stellar matchup against most of the special attackers in the tier. Gourgeist-XL takes substantial damage from neutral special STAB attacks, such as Swellow's Boomburst and Vileplume's Sludge Bomb, as well as super effective coverage moves, such as Ice Beam from Samurott and Mesprit and Flamethrower from Electivire and Weezing.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp is important for crippling physical attackers while also adding on residual damage. Synthesis keeps Gourgeist-XL healthy, though be wary of hail and rain, which cut its recovery to a mere 25%. Foul Play is Gourgeist-XL's main attack, allowing it to hit setup sweepers such as Barbaracle, Swords Dance Samurott, Klinklang, and Torterra for a lot of damage. Seed Bomb is a usable option over Foul Play to deal with Water- and Ground-types, such as Omastar, Kabutops, and Rhydon, much more quickly. Leech Seed allows Gourgeist-XL to gain a small amount of recovery while putting pressure on switch-ins, as well as hindering bulky setup sweepers such as Musharna. It also allows Gourgeist-XL to rely less on Synthesis for recovery, which is especially handy if it runs a Colbur Berry. Rock Slide is a neat option for hitting Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-types, such as Charizard, Pyroar, Magmortar, Swellow, and Abomasnow, that usually want to switch into Gourgeist-XL, preventing it for being setup fodder for them. Skill Swap is a very interesting tool against setup sweepers, as it can rob Hariyama's Guts or pass on Insomnia onto RestTalk Pokemon such as Malamar and Mega Audino. It can even trip up certain switch-ins, such as Magic Bounce Xatu, Speed Boost Combusken, Scrappy Swellow, and Refrigerate Aurorus, making them easier to play around.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment with an Impish nature grants Gourgeist-XL maximum physical bulk, improving its walling capability against the tier's physical attackers without the help of Leftovers. Colbur Berry weakens super effective Dark-type moves, which allows it to shrug off hits such as Hariyama's Knock Off and tank Shiftry's Knock Off in order to get off a burn. Leftovers is an alternative if these two are sufficiently covered. Frisk is generally the most useful ability, as it allows Gourgeist-XL to scout the foe's item, most notably identifying if the foe is wielding a Choice item or not. If you're using Skill Swap, Insomnia is the preferred ability, as it can be used to stop RestTalk Pokemon, such as Malamar and Mega Audino.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gourgeist-XL has an easy time switching into physical Fighting-, Ground-, and Water-types, such as Hitmonchan, Rhydon, Samurott, and Barbaracle. Its main objective is to burn foes and keep itself healthy. However, it should be cautious about throwing out Will-O-Wisp to avoid giving free switches to certain Pokemon, such as Fire-types and especially Xatu, so it would be wise to either make double switches or try to hit them on the switch with an effective move. Gourgeist-XL can use its last attack to target switch-ins, usually consisting of special attackers that are weak to Rock, rely on their ability, or dislike getting their health worn down.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gourgeist-XL mainly fits on more passive and defensive teams, although it can also find its place on more balanced teams. Pokemon that resist Gourgeist-XL's weaknesses, primarily Fire, Ice, and Ghost, make for good teammates. Lanturn, Thick Fat Hariyama, and Assault Vest Magmortar resist Fire and Ice, but the former two share a Freeze-Dry and Flying weakness, respectively, with Gourgeist-XL, which should be covered with other teammates. Mega Audino and Skuntank can handle Gourgeist-XL's Ghost and Dark weaknesses, with the former providing Heal Bell support and the latter Pursuit trapping bothersome Ghost- and Psychic-types, notably Xatu. In return, Gourgeist-XL can fend off the Poison-, Steel-, and Ground-types that threaten them. Mega Audino also appreciates Gourgeist-XL luring in and KOing Fire-type setup sweepers, such as Ninetales and Charizard, with Rock Slide, as they would otherwise set up easily on Mega Audino. Gourgeist-XL makes for a good teammate for the Pokemon whose weaknesses it resists; the likes of Kangaskhan, Pyroar, Rhydon, Kabutops, and Archeops like Gourgeist-XL's ability to feasibly switch into most threatening physical attacks for them.</p>"
