It is outclassed by other Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Excadrill that have options to boost their Attack or Speed with greater efficiency than Dugtrio. While Dugtrio also sports utility moves such as Memento and Stealth Rock, it is severely outdone by Landorus-T as a suicide lead most of the time.

  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gengar returns for another bout in OU, still undisputed as one of the only Pokemon to consistently remain in the tier across all generations. It resists Fairy and can hit Fairy-types hard with its super effective Poison STAB moves, which makes it a very effective offensive answer to the likes of Mega Altaria, Mega Gardevoir, and Clefable, and the Steel-type losing its Ghost-type resistance makes it easier for Gengar to fit moves onto a set and harder to switch into it. Sadly, the presence of priority users, Assault Vest users, and powerful Mega Evolutions leaves Gengar struggling to keep up. However, Gengar's typing, ability, and support movepool let it act as a powerful stallbreaker, and its offensive stats and very good Speed tier don't let it down against offensive teams. A number of other traits, such as acting as a spinblocker and an effective Destiny Bond user, makes Gengar a rather consistent, yet still unpredictable choice for many teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Gengar has a couple of other coverage options that can beat some specific Pokemon, such as Energy Ball and Psychic, but these moves have limited application compared to the versatility and strength of Gengar's normal options. Destiny Bond can be used in order to better deal with offensive threats. A Choice Specs set using Gengar's coverage and the lack of resistances to Ghost-type moves may seem appealing, but it requires a lot of support to function. Gengar can also beat pretty much every counter with coverage or Trick, and the power granted by Choice Specs makes it very hard to switch into, but overall, it is inefficient compared to the other sets. A Choice Scarf set can be used to capitalize on Gengar's immunity to Normal-type moves to reliably revenge kill Extreme Speed users, but these are not the biggest threats in the metagame, and it is pretty weak overall. Pain Split is an option for Substitute Gengar to recover health, affording the use of Life Orb in most situations too. It can also hassle some defensive Pokemon like Chansey or Clefable pretty well by discouraging healing, but utility Life Orb Gengar fails to be as effective against stall as Black Sludge, nor as effective as all-out Destiny Bond attacker against offense, so it's a situational middle ground. The combination of Substitute and Disable allows Gengar to cripple Pokemon with Choice items or Pokemon that rely on Sucker Punch or priority moves to handle Gengar.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Utility Mega Sableye can switch into any move (barring the rare Dazzling Gleam) and OHKO with Knock Off. Specially defensive Heatran is immune to burns, takes Shadow Ball quite well, and does enough with Lava Plume to force Gengar out. However, it is narrowly 2HKOed by a Life Orb-boosted Focus Blast. Specially defensive Gliscor can switch into Gengar's STAB moves and OHKO Gengar with Knock Off, assuming previous damage. It must be wary of Icy Wind, however. Mandibuzz resists Shadow Ball, avoids the 2HKO from Sludge Wave, and can OHKO with Foul Play or Knock Off assuming prior damage. Dragalge avoids the 2HKO from Shadow Ball and can OHKO Gengar with Draco Meteor. Blissey can switch into Gengar, and unlike Chansey, threaten it by either attacking it with Thunderbolt or Ice Beam or boosting its Special Attack and Special Defense with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Users: Bisharp, Weavile, and Tyranitar are all capable of trapping Gengar with Pursuit, though Focus Blast on Gengar as well as the threat of Will-O-Wisp can be troublesome.</p> <p><strong>Assault Vest Users: Tornadus-T, Raikou, Conkeldurr, Goodra, and other Assault Vest users really ruin Gengar's day, and unless they can be neutered with Substitute + Disable, Gengar is fighting a losing battle. However, all typical Assault Vest users are crippled by a burn.</p> <p><strong>Strong Choice Scarf Users: Choice Scarf Garchomp, Tyranitar, Terrakion, Excadrill, and Landorus-T are all checks to a Gengar that is not behind a Substitute, as they cleanly outspeed and KO it. Tyranitar is especially troubling, as it effortlessly traps and KOes Gengar if it can get in for free.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority Moves: Scizor, Talonflame, Azumarill, and other powerful priority users have no trouble checking Gengar due to its frailty. Sucker Punch users may seem like a good check, but no Gengar set eschews a countermeasure to this move, whether it be Substitute, Destiny Bond, or Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Fast Offensive Checks: Thundurus, Starmie, Alakazam, and other Pokemon faster than Gengar can easily check it due to its poor defenses.</p> ",

        "name": "Life Orb Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball is Gengar's main STAB attack, as its neutral coverage is fantastic and it deals solid damage to most Pokemon. Sludge Wave is Gengar's secondary STAB attack, giving Gengar the ability to hit Fairy-types and Grass-types for super effective damage. Sludge Wave also hits some additional threats neutrally, such as Mandibuzz, Rotom-W, and Keldeo, and does more damage than Shadow Ball due to its higher Base Power. Focus Blast gives Gengar the ability to hit most Dark-types for super effective damage, dealing a lot of damage to or even OHKOing them. Alongside Shadow Ball it has perfect neutral coverage, and it gives Gengar a way of severely hurting more defensively-oriented Pokemon, such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Taunt is the primary choice for Gengar's last moveslot, as it stops defensively-oriented Pokemon such as Chansey and Amoonguss from healing and using status moves. It also prevents setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Gyarados from setting up. Substitute is an option over Taunt, as it allows Gengar to play around and take advantage of Sucker Punch. It also eases prediction against offensively oriented teams, which often carry Pokemon capable of switching into one or two of Gengar's attacks, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Like Taunt, it blocks status afflictions, but coupled with recoil from Life Orb, it will cause Gengar's health to go down fast. Finally, Icy Wind hits specially defensive Gliscor, a Pokemon commonly used to handle Gengar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb maximizes Gengar's damage output while maintaining the ability to switch moves. The given EV spread with a Timid nature makes Gengar's attacks deal as much damage as possible, while using its great Speed stat to its full extent. To take minimal recoil from Life Orb, running 29 HP IVs is required.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Gengar can be very hard to deal with, especially for balanced and stall teams, as it often comes in for free on many staple Pokemon on stall teams. Therefore, bringing Gengar in on Clefable, Quagsire, and Gliscor and Mega Venusaur without Knock Off is advised. Against more offensive teams, Life Orb Gengar can prove to be a problem, as its unpredictability makes it hard to prepare for. Utilizing Gengar's great defensive typing and bringing it in on predicted Fighting-, Ground-, or Normal-type moves is the best way to use it against offensive teams. Many offensive threats, such as Keldeo, Terrakion, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, are often Choice-locked, meaning Gengar can fire off an attack without the fear of getting attacked in return. If running Substitute, it's advised to use it carefully, as Gengar's health goes down very quickly with the recoil from both Substitute and Life Orb.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazards support is strongly advised for Gengar to have an easier time breaking down bulkier cores. Therefore, Spikes users such as Ferrothorn make good teammates. Wallbreakers that can take advantage of the switches Gengar forces against stall teams, such as Keldeo, Crawdaunt, Mega Gardevoir, and Kyurem-B, make good teammates as well, as the opponent's switch patterns often become predictable. U-turn or Volt Switch users such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Mega Manectric make good partners, as they can give Gengar a free switch into their counters, such as Gliscor and Clefable, both of which are beaten by Gengar. Pokemon that appreciate having the likes of Mega Venusaur, Clefable, and Gliscor taken out, such as Azumarill, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Mega Heracross, make great teammates, as breaking down the opposing team becomes much easier when Gengar has broken down their counters. Defensive, bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Scizor make good teammates due to their typing, as they can come in on priority attacks that threaten Gengar.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Hex",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hex allows Gengar to deal a good amount of damage to specially defensive Gliscor without having to take Life Orb recoil. Its 130 Base Power against Pokemon with status makes up for the poor power on Pokemon without status; this can turn Gengar into an unstoppable sweeper against stall teams as well as a decent late-game cleaner if the enemy's team has been weakened by status. Will-O-Wisp is Gengar's own method of spreading status, and is good to spam early- to mid-game in order to weaken the enemy's team if Gengar can't sweep yet. It's also Gengar's best way to wear down Chansey with residual damage, as Chansey is immune to Hex. Taunt prevents walls from recovering from the residual damage Gengar spreads. Sludge Wave is a more flexible option if you prefer a coverage move over Substitute; it is especially useful against Calm Mind Clefable, as it can eat a Hex and boost to avoid the 2HKO even if it has been statused. Substitute enables Gengar to set up on switches or on Pokemon that can't touch it, such as Chansey and Diggersby. It eases prediction a lot, but it is more suited to very defensive teams that apply low amounts of pressure. The choice between Substitute and Sludge Wave depends on your team. Sludge Wave is more suited to teams leaning toward a balanced style, whereas Substitute usually works best on stall.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Gengar needs to use a Timid nature with maximum investment in Speed to Speed tie with Latios and Latias and outspeed the likes of Keldeo, Terrakion, and Mega Pinsir. Maximum investment in Special Attack provides Gengar with the highest chance to 2HKO specially defensive Gliscor, even after the Poison Heal recovery. If you decide to go with Substitute over Sludge Wave, you might want to try a bulkier spread such as 144 HP / 108 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe. The defensive investment increases Gengar's longevity significantly, which can be crucial for this set to perform well. The EVs make sure Clefable's Moonblast does not break Gengar's Substitute and allow Gengar to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Gardevoir's Hyper Voice after Black Sludge recovery. The Special Attack investment ensures that Gengar will always 2HKO Gliscor after Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Be careful, as Gengar is probably your main win condition against stall teams, so you have to be patient. It can be better to let a teammate faint to let Gengar set up safely instead of switching it in recklessly, given the way it threatens this team archetype. On the other hand, you will probably not have a lot of chances to bring in Gengar, so your planning must be on point to never miss an opportunity and at the same time, never overcommit with Gengar. As this set's utility is greatly reduced against more offensive teams, it is important to make good use of Gengar against these teams as well. Burning a threat at the risk of Gengar's health is usually better than saving it for an unlikely late-game sweep. Inflicting status on annoying special sponges such as Heatran and setting up entry hazards are usually the only requirements securing a good Hex sweep. Hiding the set is really important, because this set carries a surprise factor. If your opponent knows that your sweep relies on Hex, they'll try to make spreading status harder, and will be possibly less afraid of your Gengar early- to mid-game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since spreading status is key, Pokemon that are able to paralyze, burn, or poison enemies are needed. In addition, teammates that can take care of Pokemon that are immune to status such as Heatran, which has great special bulk and can't be burned nor poisoned, deserve a special mention. Ferrothorn or Clefable with Thunder Wave can effectively lure Heatran and even possibly Knock Off its Leftovers. In addition, Pokemon that can use Knock Off are appreciated, given how important residual damage is for Gengar. Mew can spread status, Knock Off items, and handle faster special threats such as Latios and Latias. Gliscor makes for another great teammate because it can spread status, use Knock Off, and stall burned or poisoned Pokemon. VoltTurn partners are important in order to unlock Gengar's potential by providing it possible free switch-ins. Rotom-W and Mega Manectric are good at baiting Chansey in order to create a safe setup opportunity and gear your team toward a faster pace. Electric-types are great teammates in general because they can attract Ground-types; Gengar can take advantage of such Ground-types, especially Choice-locked Landorus-T. Knowing this, your opponent will probably not opt for that move, which gives Electric-types a clear edge during mindgames. When teambuilding with this set, you need to cover the other matchups because Gengar's usefulness will be reduced greatly if it's not maneuvering around defensive cores, especially when it has to face fast Pokemon that don't need to set up such as Talonflame and Thundurus. This set is usually present in defensive teams because they provide Gengar with teammates that are able to handle these sweepers.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Gengar has a wide support movepool and a good set of attacking moves, making it the perfect user of Substitute and Pain Split. While it has poor bulk, Gengar still manages to get a free Substitute on many occasions thanks to its good defensive typing and ability to force switches. Pain Split increases Gengar's longevity drastically, as Gengar's low base HP means it will recover lots of HP by using Pain Split on bulkier Pokemon. This makes Gengar a nuisance for stall teams, as it has an immunity to status conditions thanks to Substitute, and its typing gives it the ability to come in on commonly seen Pokemon in stall teams, such as Chansey, Mega Venusaur, Gliscor without Knock Off, and Clefable. Shadow Ball is Gengar's main STAB attack, as its neutral coverage is fantastic and deals solid damage to most Pokemon. Focus Blast rounds the set off nicely as it has perfect neutral coverage along with Shadow Ball. It also gives Gengar a way of severely hurting common switch-ins, including Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Bisharp and more defensively oriented Pokemon such as Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>When running Pain Split, Gengar can afford to have a Life Orb equipped. To take minimal recoil from Life Orb, 29 HP IVs are required. Life Orb increases Gengar's damage output a lot, making it very hard to switch into. A simple EV spread of maximum Speed and Special Attack with a Timid nature is run to make Gengar's attacks deal as much damage as possible, while using its great Speed stat to its full extent. Running an alternate EV spread of 28 HP / 148 SpA / 80 SpD / 252 Spe is also an option to prevent defensive Mega Venusaur and Clefable from breaking Gengar's Substitutes with their Giga Drains and Moonblasts, respectively.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Gengar is a force to be reckoned with, and can be very hard to deal with, especially for balance and stall teams. It often comes in on and gets free Substitutes against many staple Pokemon on stall teams. Entry hazards support is strongly advised for Gengar to have an easier time shuffling and slowly breaking down cores. Against Pokemon that Gengar cannot really touch or that are weakened more effectively by the use of Pain Split, using Substitute until Gengar's HP is low so Pain Split drains more HP is a viable strategy which can be used for great results against bulkier teams.</p> <p>Against more offensive teams, Life Orb Gengar can prove to be a problem, as Gengar's unpredictability makes it hard to prepare for. While the utility set isn't much of a threat to offense, this set surely is, as it scores many unexpected 2HKOs with its increased damage output. Utilizing Gengar's great defensive typing and bringing it in on predicted Fighting-, Ground-, or Normal-type moves is the best way to use it against offensive teams. Many offensive threats, such as Keldeo, Terrakion, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, are often Choice-locked, meaning Gengar can set up a free Substitute and proceed to do damage to the opposing team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gengar is an amazing pick for offensive teams, as it works wonders against more defensively oriented teams. Wallbreakers such as Keldeo, Landorus, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Medicham that can take advantage of the switches Gengar forces against stall make good teammates, as the opponent's switch patterns often become predictable. Water- and Fighting-types such as Azumarill and Mega Heracross that appreciate having the likes of Mega Venusaur, Clefable, and Gliscor taken out make great teammates, as their jobs at breaking down the opposing team becomes much easier with Gengar breaking down their counters. Defensive, bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Scizor make good teammates due to their typing, as they both can come in on strong priority attacks that threaten Gengar.</p> "

  "Raikou": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting high Speed, good Special Attack, and a key Electric typing, Raikou finds a niche in the metagame as a check to top-tier threats such as Thundurus, Talonflame, and Mega Pinsir. Choice Specs Raikou can fire off very powerful attacks that are difficult to switch into. With the aid of an Assault Vest, it can check even the likes of Gengar and pivot with Volt Switch, functioning as a nice glue Pokemon for offensive teams weak to these specific threats. Raikou can also function as a devastating Calm Mind sweeper against unprepared teams and has decent coverage that makes it far from one-dimensional. Poor physical bulk, generally unimpressive power without a boost, and being easily handled by special walls hold it back significantly, but Raikou still manages to shine in a tier dominated by powerful Flying- and Electric-types.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Zap Plate allows Raikou to bluff Choice Specs sets while giving its Electric-type moves a solid boost. Hidden Power Fire can be used to allow Raikou to 2HKO Ferrothorn, one of its most common switch-ins.

    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind not only increases Raikou's firepower, enabling it to break through Pokemon that would otherwise check it such as Heatran, Mew, Jirachi, and Hippowdon, as well as clean weakened teams, but also its special bulk, preventing Pokemon like Thundurus, Clefable, and Mega Alakazam from dealing much damage to it. Thunderbolt is a powerful, reliable Electric STAB move with no drawbacks. Hidden Power Ice gives Raikou almost perfect coverage alongside Thunderbolt; specifically, it deals a huge amount of damage to Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, as well as Dragon-types such as Latios and Altaria and certain Grass-types such as Serperior. Volt Switch enables Raikou to keep offensive momentum going, which makes it far more useful early on in the battle and enables its teammates to come in for free. Volt Switch also helps Raikou wear down its checks so that it can more easily sweep late-game, as well as bluff an Assault Vest set more convincingly, especially when carrying a Zap Plate. Substitute has multiple uses, such as enabling Raikou to evade status moves from Pokemon such as Heatran, Slowbro, Ferrothorn, Rotom , and Jirachi and safely set up Calm Mind on them, helping it scout for switches (particularly from opposing Volt Switch users), and letting it evade Bisharp's Sucker Punch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Running maximum Speed with a Timid nature enables Raikou to fully take advantage of its great Speed tier, letting it outspeed Serperior and Speed tie with Starmie and opposing Raikou. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack for as much firepower as possible. A bulkier EV spread can be used on the Substitute set in order for Raikou to set up more easily on certain Pokemon at the expense of power; for instance, a spread of 112 HP / 144 SpA / 252 Spe guarantees that uninvested Heatran's Lava Plume will never break Raikou's Substitute after one Calm Mind boost. Leftovers gives Raikou more longevity, helps it set up Calm Mind more reliably, and enables it to set up Substitute more often (particularly against low-accuracy moves such as Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and Thundurus's Focus Blast) provided that it's running the move. However, a Zap Plate can be used when running Volt Switch in order to bluff a Choice Specs or Assault Vest set. It also gives Raikou the ability to 2HKO standard Clefable after a Calm Mind boost. Pressure is Raikou's only ability, helping it against Pokemon that rely on attacking moves with low PP such as Serperior and Overheat Mega Manectric.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Raikou should be sent in against Pokemon it can easily set up on, such as Thundurus, Rotom-W, Mega Manectric, Jirachi, and opposing Raikou. However, don't let Raikou take too much damage for it to properly set up later on. Volt Switch should be used frequently in the early- and mid- game in order to maintain offensive momentum and wear down Raikou's checks, both of which are invaluable during these stages of the battle. However, if your opponent has Hippowdon, avoid using Volt Switch because that will give it a free turn to enter the battlefield, and double switch if you feel the need to. Substitute should be used against predicted uses of Volt Switch, Sucker Punch, and status moves. After one or two Calm Mind boosts, Raikou can also use it on predicted uses of Scald and Lava Plume in order to avoid a potential burn. Against offensive teams, do not attempt to set up Calm Mind; instead, rely on either Volt Switch for generating momentum or Substitute for scouting, depending on which one Raikou carries. However, when facing more defensive teams, don't reveal Calm Mind or Substitute too early, and only use them when you are ready to sweep with Raikou and have determined your opponent's response to it. That way, you can take advantage of the opponent sending in a Pokemon like Heatran, Venusaur, Jirachi, or his own Raikou to switch into yours. In the specific cases of Heatran and Venusaur, Raikou should try to set up Calm Mind immediately as they switch in; otherwise, it may not be able to beat them. If Raikou carries Substitute, your opponent will rely less on status moves and more on offensive moves to pressure Raikou once they know it does, so you can play around that by setting up Calm Mind instead. Before setting up, make sure that slower checks such as Hippowdon and Latias have been weakened to a range where they can be KOed by +1 Hidden Power Ice. Don't set up unless faster, physically offensive revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Sand Rush Excadrill, and Mega Lopunny have been removed, as they can easily prevent a sweep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Calm Mind Raikou fits very well on teams that want a boosting wincon as well as an answer to Electric-types such as Thundurus, Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, and opposing Raikou. Make sure that Raikou is paired up with answers to fast, powerful physical attackers that can easily dispose of it, particularly Mega Charizard X, which easily sets up on it. This can be a bulky Ground-type such as Landorus-T or Hippowdon, as well as a Water-type such as Manaphy or Slowbro. Garchomp is particularly good in this role because it can easily wear them down; however, it does not beat Mega Charizard X and therefore needs to be paired up with a check to it. Raikou also needs to be paired up with an answer to Ground-types such as Excadrill and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Skarmory is particularly good because it can switch into Dragon- and Fairy-types, both of which can be difficult for Raikou to handle, and provide Spikes support to help Raikou break past its checks. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Grass-types such as Serperior can also handle Ground-types and benefit from Raikou's ability to break past Venusaur. Raikou appreciates support from Pokemon that can either weaken or surprise Ground-types. For instance, Jolly Mega Charizard X can weaken Hippowdon and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and in return, Raikou handles Water-types and can bait in Heatran. Mega Metagross is also a solid partner for its ability to wear down Ground-types and check Dragon- and Grass-types, while Raikou handles Steel- and Water-types in return. Because most Pokemon that can check or counter Calm Mind Raikou, such as Chansey, Clefable and Choice Scarf Ground-types, rely on their items to do so, a Knock Off user that some of these Pokemon tend to switch into, such as Alakazam, Mega Gallade, or mixed Thundurus, can serve as a good teammate to Raikou. Talonflame is an excellent partner as well because it is immune to Ground, checks Fairies, can revenge kill physical attackers, and can also weaken bulky Water-types. In return, Raikou handles Electric- and Water-types, which are very threatening for Talonflame. Both Raikou and its usual partners are vulnerable to Weavile, so make sure your team is adequately prepared to face it by carrying a check to it such as Keldeo, Mega Scizor, Azumarill, which also checks other huge threats to Raikou such as Mega Charizard X and Sand Rush Excadrill, or Klefki, which can help Raikou wear down its checks with Spikes support. If running Volt Switch, U-turn users such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Scizor also act as good partners.</p> "

Volt Switch is decently powerful with a Choice Specs boost and moreover provides Raikou with a cost-free move that lets it pivot out of unfavorable matchups. Hidden Power Ice hits crucial Ground- and Dragon-types for super effective damage, especially Landorus-T, Garchomp, Gliscor, and any Hippowdon without more than the standard 140 Special Defense EVs. Shadow Ball is good for a heavier hit on Latios, taking off upwards of three-quarters of its HP, and it also takes away almost half of Excadrill's health, changing it from a safe switch-in into something that can only switch in once.

Against Ground-type foes, it's typically best to hard switch into a better matchup on the predicted switch so that you don't lose momentum. Thunderbolt should be used to clean and for extra power if it is needed to obtain a KO. Like all Raikou variants, you'll want to be careful switching it in, as Raikou is prone to being worn down by entry hazards and even resisted attacks. If the foe has a Pokemon such as Thundurus, Mega Pinsir, or Talonflame, you'll want to make sure Raikou isn't brought down to such a range where they can break through it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Raikou finds itself at home on offensive teams with VoltTurn cores. Pokemon such as Mega Scizor can form such cores; Mega Scizor specifically can pressure Chansey with Knock Off and generally threaten it, which is necessary for Raikou to break through defensive teams. Defog or spin support is essential to keep it in tip-top shape to handle threats; Skarmory and Mandibuzz can handle threatening Ground-types well and fill this role.

Hidden Power Ice is compulsory coverage to hit Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp, which otherwise completely wall Raikou. The last slot boils down to whether 2HKOing Latios (Shadow Ball) or actually threatening Mega Venusaur (Extrasensory) is preferred.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 EVs in Speed with a Timid nature allow Raikou to speed tie with Starmie and other Raikou while being able to outrun threats such as Serperior and Thundurus. 252 EVs in Special Attack maximizes Raikou's damage output. An Assault Vest enables Raikou to more comfortably switch into special attackers such as Thundurus, Mega Manectric, Manaphy, Keldeo, and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Be wary of switching in and out a lot with this Raikou, as it will be worn down quickly. When in doubt, unless the opponent has a bulky Ground-type to switch in, Volt Switching out is the best option unless you absolutely have to stay in and attack. This keeps the momentum of the battle in your favor. If the opponent has a bulky Ground-type to switch in, just hard switch out anticipating the play.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon such as Skarmory and Mandibuzz that can handle Ground-types and physical attackers in general are useful teammates. Entry hazards limit this Raikou's longevity immensely due to its lack of Leftovers, so Defog or Rapid Spin support is heavily appreciated. It fits well into VoltTurn cores with Pokemon such as Scizor and Landorus-T.</p> "

  "Suicune": {
    "overview": "<p>With a great defensive typing and amazing natural bulk, Suicune acts as a solid bulky Calm Mind sweeper as well as a check to common foes like Gliscor and Heatran. Suicune's ability Pressure allows it to outlast a large range of Pokemon that could otherwise wall it, which includes Chansey, Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Clefable, as well as stall out moves with low PP like Leaf Storm from Serperior. Suicune is also able to beat other bulky Calm Mind users thanks to Pressure as well as its access to Roar. Suicune does, however, struggle to consistently take on attacks due to its lack of recovery outside of Leftovers and Rest, which leaves leaving it passive for two turns if it is lacking Sleep Talk. Suicune also lacks a large movepool, making it very predictable.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There are not many other options for Suicune to run, as they are all subpar at best. Toxic can be used to wear down bulky Water-types like Gastrodon and Rotom-W. Rest can be used with Substitute, but this doesn't leave space for moves like Sleep Talk.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Thundurus can take a few Scalds from Suicune and threaten it back with Thunderbolt. Magnezone can also take Scald from Suicune and hit it back with Thunderbolt or use Volt Switch to gain momentum. However, neither can consistently switch into Scald, especially if it lands a burn. Zapdos and Rotom-W do not mind switching into Suicune and hit it super effectively, but they cannot beat it one-on-one as it sets up with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Ferrothorn resists Scald and threatens Suicune with Power Whip or Leech Seed if it lacks Substitute. Serperior can threaten Suicune with Leaf Storm and boost past its Calm Mind boosts thanks to its ability Contrary. Serperior can, however, be PP stalled out of Leaf Storm thanks to Pressure, especially if Suicune has Protect and Substitute. Amoonguss can take Scald easily and remove Suicune's Calm Mind boosts with Clear Smog if it does not run Substitute. Mega Venusaur can threaten Suicune with Giga Drain while also resisting its Scald, but it does lose to Suicune if it gets enough boosts with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Strong Offensive Foes: Strong offensive Pokemon like Mega Medicham, Thunder Punch Mega Metagross, and Choice Specs Latios, and Choice Specs Keldeo can all overload Suicune, making it tough for it to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Knock Off users like Bisharp, Weavile, and Clefable can all make Suicune easier to wear down by removing its Leftovers, especially if it lacks Rest.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Manaphy can set up on Suicune with Tail Glow and threaten it with Energy Ball. Mega Altaria can set up with Dragon Dance on Suicune, resists its Scald, and can remove any burns that Scald may inflict with Heal Bell. Calm Mind Mega Slowbro can set up Calm Mind with Suicune and threaten it with Psyshock. Mega Latias can also set up Calm Mind with Suicune and use Thunderbolt or Psyshock to beat it.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind allows Suicune to break through defensive cores while also getting bulkier. Substitute allows it to avoid status moves like Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Leech Seed. Substitute also helps Suicune against critical hits, which is useful against strong attacks and other Calm Mind users like Clefable. Substitute pairs very well with Protect to PP stall foes' moves like Leaf Storm from Serperior and Power Whip from Ferrothorn. Protect allows Suicune to scout moves from foes and get additional turns of recovery from Leftovers, which is important considering that Leftovers acts as Suicune's only form of recovery. Scald deals damage and has a nice benefit of a chance to burn foes.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs give Suicune exactly 404 HP, which means Seismic Toss from foes like Chansey cannot break its Substitute. 216 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Suicune to outspeed Heatran, defensive Excadrill, defensive Garchomp, Zapdos, Bisharp, and Metagross before it Mega Evolves. 40 SpD EVs allow Suicune to better take on special attacks, notably preventing Amoonguss from breaking its Substitute and also giving its Substitute a chance to withstand a Volt Switch from Rotom-W after one Calm Mind boost. Leftovers is mandatory, as it acts as Suicune's only way of recovery.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Suicune must avoid being statused, especially by burn or Toxic, as this set does not have reliable recovery or a way to remove status effects. Since Leftovers is its only form of recovery, it does not want it to be removed by Knock Off or other moves like Trick. Suicune finds setup opportunities on defensive foes that cannot threaten it, like Heatran and non-Thunderbolt Clefable, as well as foes Choice-locked into moves that cannot threaten it, which include Choice Specs Keldeo locked into Scald and Choice Scarf Magnezone locked into Hidden Power Fire or Flash Cannon. Utilize Pressure to stall out low PP moves with Substitute and Protect like Leaf Storm from Serperior and Power Whip from Ferrothorn. Protect can also be useful against Choice item users like Choice Scarf Magnezone, Tyranitar, and Excadrill.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pursuit users like Mega Metagross, Tyranitar, and Weavile are able to remove Latios and Mega Latias, both of which resist Suicune's Scald. Tyranitar and Weavile can also check Electric-types like Thundurus and Zapdos with Stone Edge and Icicle Crash. Do be aware of Tyranitar's summoned sand hindering Suicune's recovery. Status absorbers like Gliscor and Clefable are good partners to take on the likes of Will-O-Wisp and Toxic. Heatran can help Suicune deal with Grass-types like Serperior and Ferrothorn while also having access to utility moves like Stealth Rock. Latios can remove entry hazards, which chip away at Suicune, and also deal with Electric-types like Rotom-W and Thundurus. Latias does the same but also provides Healing Wish support to remove status and heal Suicune to full health. Clefable is another helpful Healing Wish user. Tornadus-T can help Suicune deal with Grass-types like Serperior as well as provide Knock Off and U-turn support. Magnezone is a good partner, as it has the ability to remove Ferrothorn, which could otherwise absorb Suicune's Scald and threaten it with Power Whip.</p> "

Rest provides Suicune recovery but has the downside of putting it to sleep for two turns. Calm Mind makes Suicune bulkier and makes it easier to break through defensive cores and sweep. Roar is useful to phaze setup users like Calm Mind Mega Slowbro and Clefable. Alternatively, Sleep Talk gives Suicune a chance to use Scald to burn foes or set up another Calm Mind while it sleeps due to Rest.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment allows Suicune to be as bulky as possible and better at taking on physical attackers like Mega Metagross, Excadrill, Gliscor, Mega Scizor, Weavile, and Landorus-T. Leftovers allows Suicune to stay healthy and reduces the need to use Rest. Pressure is Suicune's only legal ability and helps it win setup wars with other Calm Mind users like Clefable as well as stall out defensive Pokemon like Quagsire and Gastrodon. 20 EVs can be taken from Defense and put into Speed to allow Suicune to outspeed Rotom-W so it can use Calm Mind before Rotom-W uses Volt Switch. 20 Speed EVs also allow Suicune to outspeed Adamant Crawdaunt and some variants of specially defensive Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Roar should be used to phaze out foes that want to set up like Calm Mind Clefable, force switch-ins to take entry hazard damage, and scout out movesets early-game. Suicune should spam Scald early-game to spread burns on common switch-ins like Ferrothorn and Latios to cripple them. Rest should be used to help Suicune remove a status aliment like burn, Toxic poison, or paralysis and to help it stay healthy. Calm Mind should be used late-game to allow Suicune break through and sweep teams when all its checks are eliminated or weakened.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Skarmory can provide Spikes for Suicune, which is a good combination with Roar to force chip damage. Ferrothorn also has access to Spikes and can take strong attacks that Skarmory cannot, like Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Latios and Thunder Punch from Mega Metagross. It also appreciates Suicune's ability to resist Fire-type moves. Heatran can provide Stealth Rock support and take on Grass-types like Serperior and Ferrothorn that can check Suicune. Mega Latias can deal with Electric-types that threaten Suicune like Thundurus and Zapdos. Tornadus-T helps Suicune deal with Grass-types like Serperior while also providing utility via Knock Off and U-turn. Tyranitar can remove Latios and Latias, which resist Suicune's Scald, while also removing entry hazard removers to make Roar more effective. Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Heatran can take on Grass-types and cripple opposing Water-types like Gastrodon via Solar Beam or Toxic, respectively. Excadrill is able to spin away entry hazards that could wear down Suicune, resist Fairy-type attacks from the likes of Clefable, deal with Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Zapdos via Toxic or Rock Slide, and take on Electric-type attacks from the likes of Magnezone. Clefable can form a Calm Mind core with Suicune while also checking certain Electric-types like Thundurus.</p> "

  "Zygarde": {
    "overview": "<p>Zygarde is often ridiculed due to its low stats for a supposed titular legendary and is subsequently dismissed as an \"inferior Garchomp\". However, its very well-placed stats grant it great bulk, decent power, and usable Speed. Dragon- and Ground-type STAB is a powerful combination, able to hit nearly the entire tier for at least neutral damage. Zygarde has great boosting options as well, namely Dragon Dance and Coil, the latter of which is unique to Zygarde in the OU environment. While its offensive movepool is shallow, it is solid enough to threaten a majority of opposing Pokemon and also includes Extreme Speed. That said, Zygarde lacks immediate power compared to its fellow Dragon-type Pokemon and has an unfortunately useless ability. It also does not have a reliable Dragon-type attack, which can limit its sweeping ability. It takes a tad longer for Zygarde to become a threat compared to other Dragons, but that does not make it any less of one.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Camouflage may be used to remove most of Zygarde's weaknesses and give it STAB Extreme Speed, but Dragon Dance and Coil gives Extreme Speed the same boost and powers up Zygarde's other moves instead of weakening them like Camouflage does by removing their STAB. Land's Wrath is completely inferior to Earthquake, so don't let its title of \"signature move\" tempt you. Haze lets Zygarde stop setup sweepers, but Zygarde lacks the tools or offensive presence to deter most foes from setting up again, plus it has Dragon Tail anyway. Toxic can cripple some of Zygarde's bulkier checks, but none of its sets really have the moveslot for it. RestTalk + Dragon Tail can improve Zygarde's longevity, but Hippowdon makes a better bulky phazer due to its better recovery and spare moveslots.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Anti-Setup: Zygarde thrives on setting up, so disrupting it from doing so is a good way to keep it under control. Unaware Clefable and Quagsire stop Zygarde cold, the former of which threatens with STAB Moonblast. A quick Taunt can prevent Zygarde from doing much more, limiting its offensive presence. Tricking a Choice item onto Zygarde can utterly ruin it for the most part. Phazing can be an option, though most users are outsped by Zygarde's Dragon Tail, making it less effective.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types are immune to Dragon Tail and Outrage, and can hit Zygarde back with their super effective STAB attacks. Mega Gardevoir, Unaware Clefable, Azumarill, and Sylveon are good answers to most sets.</p> <p><strong>Status: Zygarde really doesn't like being hit by status at all. Even the Rest sets could do without being pressured to sleep early. Burns heavily cripple Zygarde, though Substitute coupled with Zygarde's Speed can make it difficult to cause a status affliction; Talonflame and fast Rotom-W are among the few status users that can outpace Zygarde. Gliscor can also Toxic Zygarde before the latter sets up a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon: Bulky Flying-types and Levitate users such as Landorus-T, Mandibuzz, Togekiss, Skarmory, and Rotom-W are immune to Zygarde's most reliable attack, forcing it to use less desirable attacks such as Outrage, Dragon Tail, and Stone Edge. That said, forcing Zygarde to use those attacks might not actually stop it on the spot, but it can potentially interrupt its sweep. This is especially problematic for Dragon Tail variants, as bulky Flying-types with recovery can typically outlast Zygarde's Dragon Tail PP while deterring it from using Earthquake to give them free switches. Zapdos might be at risk when Roosting due to it being potentially faster than Zygarde, but Pressure can punish mispredictions on Zygarde's part, and Skarmory and Mandibuzz do not mind repeatedly switching in and being phazed by Dragon Tails due to their high Defense, Roost, and in Skarmory's case, resistance.</p> <p><strong>Bypassing Substitute: Sylveon's and Mega Gardevoir's Hyper Voice, as well as Mamoswine's Icicle Spear, are all capable of busting through Zygarde's Substitute, rendering the SubCoil set's attempts to set up and sweep completely futile.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: In a similar vein, Pokemon that can still act before Dragon Dance Zygarde can potentially make it useless. Choice Scarf Garchomp and Ice Shard Mamoswine are such examples, as they can outspeed +1 Zygarde and KO it with super effective attacks, though Extreme Speed Zygarde will land a hit on them first, and the former two cannot stop a Zygarde that has attained more than one boost.</p> ",

        "name": "SubCoil",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute blocks status and various weaker attacks and also guards Zygarde against faster Pokemon. Coil is an enhanced Bulk Up, boosting Zygarde's Attack, Defense, and accuracy, which ensures a perfectly accurate Dragon Tail. This allows Zygarde to become exceptionally tanky. Earthquake is Zygarde's most reliable attack and offers good power. Dragon Tail prevents slower phazers from forcing out Zygarde's Substitute, while also hitting airborne Pokemon and forcing out unfavorable matchups or opposing stat boosters.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>56 Speed EVs allow Zygarde to outspeed Bisharp and hit it with Earthquake before Zygarde can be hit with Knock Off. The rest of the EVs are used to maximize Zygarde's special bulk. It has enough HP investment to create 101 HP Substitutes, which allows Zygarde's Substitute to tank two Seismic Tosses before breaking. Maximum Special Defense prevents weaker special attacks such as Mega Venusaur's Giga Drain from breaking Zygarde's Substitute, while Coil makes up for its Defense. Zero Attack EVs ensure STAB Foul Play will not break the Substitute, so it would be unwise to invest in Attack. Leftovers is the essential item, allowing Zygarde to recover health lost from Substitute.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>SubCoil Zygarde has a great advantage against defensive teams, setting up easily on Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Mandibuzz, Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, bulky Mega Scizor, and Heatran. Zygarde can set up a Substitute against the many foes unable to break it, then boost away. Should any problematic Pokemon trouble Zygarde, it can Dragon Tail them away behind the safety of the Substitute, and might even drag out the opponent's setup fodder again; continually repeating this will easily wear down Zygarde's checks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Specially based Fairy-types, especially Unaware Clefable and Togekiss, can pose a problem due to their immunity to Dragon Tail, so Pokemon that can threaten them make good partners; Scizor, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Venusaur are good options. Draco Meteor and Ice Beam are two special attacks Zygarde fears greatly, so Pokemon that resist one or preferably both of these moves make great partners; Azumarill, Sylveon, and Scizor come to mind. Entry hazard users make helpful teammates, as they can maximize the effectiveness of Zygarde's Dragon Tail, and Pokemon such as Heatran and Skarmory can even cover Zygarde's weaknesses; however, it is worth mentioning that the hazards do not stay long, as Zygarde does not do a good job of preventing Rapid Spin or Defog, so they are not essential. If you do choose a hazard user, make sure to have a response against anti-hazards on your team, such as spinblockers or Defiant Pokemon; Bisharp makes a great teammate as it can deal with Fairy-types as well.</p> <p>Pokemon immune to Ground-type moves such as bulky Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate can pose some issues for Zygarde, as they can force Zygarde to use its negative priority Dragon Tail, allowing them to respond accordingly by either healing or breaking Zygarde's Substitute. Thundurus can threaten a good majority of available Flying-types as well as Levitate users. Teammates should pick up the slack against offensive teams that do not provide Zygarde an opportunity to set up. VoltTurn users such as Talonflame and Thundurus can easily harass offensive teams, but slower users such as Scizor and Rotom-W can instead try to bring Zygarde in safely. Pokemon that can spread paralysis can slow down offensive Pokemon so they too fall victim to Zygarde, thus making Klefki and Thundurus good partners—Klefki even provides Spikes for Zygarde's Dragon Tail.</p> "

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Zygarde's Attack and Speed, readying Zygarde to sweep its opponent. Earthquake provides solid damage with no drawbacks, making it Zygarde's most reliable attack and premier sweeping move. Outrage hits hard after a single boost, but locks Zygarde in and confuses it afterward; however, it is effective at cleaning up opponents late-game. Stone Edge hits Togekiss and picks off Flying-types such as Thundurus and Tornadus-T without resorting to Outrage. Extreme Speed can be used to outpace opposing priority users, most notably Talonflame and Mamoswine, though their inability to OHKO Zygarde anyway means Extreme Speed isn't too necessary.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature provides Zygarde with greater sweeping potential after a single Dragon Dance, and maximum Speed investment ensures Zygarde Speed ties with neutral Kyurem-B, and also outspeeds neutral Mega Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Jolly Gyarados. Alternatively, Jolly with 164 Speed EVs outruns Mega Alakazam and Mega Aerodactyl at +1, though the lack of an Attack-boosting nature substantially drops Zygarde's power, not to mention the relative rarity of these threats. The remaining EVs can be placed in any other stat. Life Orb can be used to give Zygarde a significant power boost, considering its base Attack is not as good as other Dragons, but it cuts into Zygarde's bulk, an advantage it does have over other Dragon-types. Lum Berry allows Zygarde to set up on status users, such as Rotom-W, Chansey, and Gliscor, or snap Zygarde out of Outrage confusion. Yache Berry allows Zygarde to survive non-STAB Ice-type moves, allowing Zygarde to either set up on them or prevent itself from being revenge killed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Dragon Dance Zygarde's greatest advantage over Dragonite is its resistance to Stealth Rock, lessening the need for entry hazard removal from teammates. This set is very straightforward: boost once (twice if possible) and start attacking. Between the boosted Speed, high bulk, and a powerful STAB combination, Dragon Dance Zygarde can pose a serious threat to offensive teams. Zygarde should optimally be set to sweep after one Dragon Dance, cleaning up with a speedy and powerful Earthquake or Outrage. Ground resistant or immune Pokemon, or physically bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon, should be removed before going for the sweep, so as to avoid being forced into using Outrage early. Hard-hitting offensive Pokemon such as Thundurus and Azumarill do a great job at wreaking havoc and softening up opposing teams, which can pave the way for Zygarde to clean things up. When running Extreme Speed, it allows Zygarde to perform the occasional revenge kill on weakened Pokemon such as Talonflame. Zygarde uses its good bulk and resistances to tank a hit and set up, or threatens foes with STAB Earthquake to gain free turns. If Life Orb is used, take care not to let Zygarde's health drop too low before setting up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rotom-W is a great partner regardless of the coverage option; it takes on Togekiss for Zygarde that lack Stone Edge and can handle Talonflame and Mamoswine for Zygarde without Extreme Speed. While Stealth Rock benefits any offensive Pokemon, it is especially helpful for Zygarde, as it weakens a good majority of Ground-resistant Pokemon, which allows Zygarde to pick them off with its weaker move as opposed to using Outrage to KO them. Because Flying-type Pokemon and Levitate users can get in the way of a clean sweep, teammates that can handle these Pokemon are recommended. Kyurem-B, Thundurus, and Raikou are great anti-Flying-type measures, while luring and hurting a good majority of Levitate users as well. Zygarde finds it easier to set up on opponents weak to Ground-type moves; Talonflame lures in Rock-types or Steel-types such as Heatran and Tyranitar and U-turns away from them. Dual screens aren't necessary, but they ease Zygarde's job of setting up, while its natural bulk makes it even more challenging to take down behind them; Klefki, Azelf, or Latios can provide this support.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Zygarde's Attack and Speed, which allows Zygarde to sweep its foe when set up. Rest completely heals Zygarde of any damage and status and is best used when Zygarde has taken a beating from attacks and status moves while boosting with Dragon Dance, undoing your opponent's efforts and threatening them with a fresh, boosted Zygarde. Earthquake is Zygarde's most reliable attack and main sweeping move. The last move of choice complements Earthquake well. Outrage hits very hard after a boost or two, but locks Zygarde into the move and confuses it afterward. Stone Edge hits Togekiss and picks off other Flying-types such as Thundurus and Mega Pinsir without needing to confuse Zygarde, but it lacks STAB and can fall short on KOing most other Pokemon that resist Ground.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature maximizes Zygarde's sweeping potential. 136 Speed EVs allow Zygarde to outspeed Choice Scarf Terrakion at +2 Speed, likely the fastest Choice Scarf Pokemon one will see. This also allows Zygarde to outspeed Noivern at +1 Speed and conveniently outspeeds unboosted Adamant Dragonite. The remaining EVs go into HP, which gives Zygarde enough bulk to survive 2 Fire Blasts from Mega Charizard Y. The combination of Chesto Berry and Rest acts as a Full Restore, allowing Zygarde to set up freely on status users such as Rotom-W, Chansey, and Gliscor, then heal itself completely when the time is right so that Zygarde can sweep its foes unhindered by health or status concerns.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Zygarde set aims to use Dragon Dance a couple of times while taking damage and/or status, then use Rest to refresh itself and sweep with a good amount of health and boosts. With its great bulk, it can set up on numerous Pokemon that have trouble 2HKOing it, so long as they do not have Ice-type moves; this includes such Pokemon as Excadrill, Mega Scizor, Rotom-W, Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, Gengar, Mega Charizard Y, Chansey, Gliscor, and Terrakion. Alternatively, Zygarde can start getting boosts against Pokemon it can force out, such as Excadrill, Heatran, and Tyranitar, though the risk of Ice Punch makes the last option risky. Zygarde can also take advantage of weaker Choice-locked attacks, such as Terrakion's Stone Edge, Keldeo's Secret Sword, and Garchomp's Earthquake. Dragon Dance Rest Zygarde works best against balanced teams, where it exploits their weak links to set up and uses its combination of bulk, Speed, and strong dual STAB moves to overwhelm its foes, which are often unprepared to deal with the threat. Zygarde should only face an opponent that it can handle for certain, as Resting too early without getting enough boosts may cut its sweep short, and Zygarde likely won't get a chance to do it again.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Zygarde's main spamming move is Earthquake, making Flying-types and Levitate users notable annoyances. Stealth Rock can clip the wings of the former, with Clefable, Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, and Heatran being good users of the move. These Pokemon do not clash weaknesses with Zygarde, unlike most Ground-type Stealth Rock users such as Landorus-T and Hippowdon. Tyranitar can take on most Flying-types, while Ferrothorn and Heatran offer decent defensive synergy alongside Leech Seed and burn support, respectively. Kyurem-B, Thundurus, and Raikou are great anti-Flying-type measures, luring and hurting a good majority of Levitate users as well. Fairy-types can be a huge obstacle in Zygarde's path, most notably physically defensive variants of Clefable and Togekiss; Steel-types such as Scizor, Excadrill, Magnezone, and Heatran can take out these Pokemon. Additionally, Scizor can use U-turn to bring Zygarde in safely or Pursuit trap Latios and Latias, Excadrill can weaken or take out the opponent's Ground-type checks, Magnezone can trap Skarmory and has a slow Volt Switch which also takes care of Flying-types, and Heatran can spread burns to ease Zygarde's setup.</p> <p>Because this Zygarde aims to rack up multiple boosts and has the means to heal off any damage and status incurred, dual screens would heavily boost this set's effectiveness, with Klefki, Azelf, and Latios making great users. Klefki has Prankster Thunder Wave to slow down threats and has decent defensive synergy with Zygarde, Azelf can set up Stealth Rock or Taunt Defoggers, and Latios can use Memento to bring Zygarde in safely.</p> "

Earthquake is Zygarde's most reliable STAB move and targets grounded Electric-types such as Raikou and Mega Manectric, which cannot be paralyzed. Dragon Tail phazes foes, bringing out new opponents for Zygarde to paralyze. Substitute is used to take advantage of the free turns its paralyzed foes give, especially those that repeatedly switch in with the intent of shielding their teammates from the same fate, and it also guards against status such as burn and poison.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Because Zygarde cannot boost its Defense with Coil anymore, Defense is maxed out to tank physical attacks.

From there, it can Earthquake grounded Electric-types, use Substitute against status users so they do not impede Zygarde's job and shorten its staying power, and use Dragon Tail to phaze out paralyzed opponents so Zygarde has new foes to Glare. If the opponent persists in repeatedly sending out their already paralyzed Pokemon, Zygarde may take advantage by using Dragon Tail or Substitute on the switch, or make use of their paralysis by setting up a free Substitute.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Attackers that have trouble outspeeding opponents, such as Mega Heracross and Bisharp, greatly appreciate Zygarde's paralysis support, especially because paralysis affects Flying-types and cannot be Defogged away, unlike Sticky Web. This set's performance is greatly enhanced by entry hazards, as it forces a lot of switches; Klefki, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory can lay down Spikes while covering Zygarde's weaknesses, while Heatran and Tyranitar can provide Stealth Rock support, with more offensive variants even taking advantage of paralyzed foes. Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Gliscor are immune to both paralysis and Earthquake, making them big obstacles; Mega Venusaur, Sylveon, Clefable, and Kyurem-B can take on all three for the most part, although Kyurem-B does stack weaknesses, which is more prominent, as this Zygarde is a defensive variant.</p> "

  "Gardevoir": {
    "overview": "<p>By virtue of its incredible Special Attack stat and its ability, Pixilate, Mega Gardevoir is a very strong wallbreaker. Unlike most wallbreakers, Gardevoir also has a decent Speed stat, which doesn't make it dead weight against offensive teams. Gardevoir also has a solid typing with an immunity to Dragon, which all teams enjoy, and a great movepool which lets it potentially hit anything neutrally or super effectively. However, Steel-types are very common in OU, and they can switch in quite easily on any of Gardevoir's moves except Focus Blast. An only decent base 100 Speed coupled with terrible Defense also makes Gardevoir very easy to revenge kill with physical attackers and common strong priority moves, especially Bullet Punch.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shadow Ball hits Jirachi, Victini, and Mega Metagross, which would otherwise counter or check Gardevoir, super effectively. Future Sight works very well with a strong physical attacker as your opponent may have nothing to take a strong physical attack and a strong Future Sight simultaneously, usually leading to a Pokemon getting sacked if you play correctly. Destiny Bond can get rid of threats such as Mega Metagross, Ferrothorn, Bisharp, Manaphy, and a boosted Clefable in a pinch. Memento is an interesting move that creates setup opportunities for teammates, and Healing Wish can give a teammate a second chance to sweep. Hidden Power Fire lures in Mega Scizor and almost OHKOes it on the switch, but leaves Gardevoir walled by Heatran. Choice Scarf Gardevoir is an interesting set that can revenge kill weather sweepers with Trace, as well as Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Altaria. Additionally, Life Orb is an option over Gardevoirite if you already have a Mega Evolution on your team but still need an offensive Fairy-type. Encore can be used as an alternate method of breaking through defensive Pokemon by locking them into an unfavorable move, giving Gardevoir more opportunities to set up or launch off an attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Although some of them fear Focus Blast or Will-O-Wisp and thus can't switch in safely, if they get a free switch in, Steel-types such as Scizor, Mega Metagross, Jolly Excadrill, Jirachi, and Choice Scarf Magnezone can easily force Gardevoir out with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Gardevoir's Psyshock hits Poison-types for a huge amount of damage, but faster Poison-types, specifically Gengar and Mega Beedrill, can both easily KO it, provided they get a free switch in.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types resist Gardevoir's Fairy-type STAB, and most Fire-types can hit back very hard. The most notable ones are Victini, which is a good answer to non-Shadow Ball sets, and Heatran, which can take one Focus Blast and hit back with its Fire-type STAB moves, Flash Cannon, or use Toxic, depending on the set it uses. Both resist Psyshock as well, which is what makes them especially good checks.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Gardevoir's Defense stat is very low, so physical attackers that can survive a hit from it or simply outspeed it, such as Mega Metagross, Terrakion, Victini, Weavile, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, can easily KO it with just a little prior damage as long as they are not burned.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Although Gardevoir's Speed is far from horrible, it still leaves it vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Weavile, and Mega Lopunny. Strong priority moves such as Bisharp's Sucker Punch, Talonflame's Brave Bird, and Azumarill's Aqua Jet also do a ton of damage to Gardevoir because of its horrible Defense stat. However, the support set has a better matchup against them as it can usually survive a hit and use Will-O-Wisp to defeat them, granted Gardevoir is at good health.</p> ",

        "name": "Wallbreaker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyper Voice hits incredibly hard and does a huge chunk of damage against any Pokemon that does not resist it. Psyshock hits special walls, most notably Chansey, on their Defense, allowing Gardevoir to break through them. Focus Blast hits the Steel-types that resist Gardevoir's STAB moves, such as Ferrothorn. Will-O-Wisp is great for burning Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, and Jirachi on the switch. Taunt allows Gardevoir to break through defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Clefable, and it stops Pokemon such as Bisharp from setting up on Gardevoir. Calm Mind makes Gardevoir a powerful setup sweeper that can threaten bulky and fast teams alike. Substitute can also be used, as Gardevoir forces a ton of switches, and it makes Gardevoir harder to revenge kill, eases prediction, and protects it from status moves.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Trace is the preferred ability before Mega Evolution, as it makes Gardevoir capable of turning a foe's ability against them. Some example of this include countering specially defensive Heatran with Taunt, stealing Regenerator from Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Slowbro, taking advantage of Manectric's Lightning Rod, Intimidating Landorus-T and Gyarados, and trapping Magnezone locked into a Hidden Power. Additionally, Trace lets Gardevoir revenge kill weakened Dragonite with the aid of Multiscale, revenge kill weather sweepers such as Modest Kingdra and Adamant Excadrill if it is using a Timid nature, and Synchronize burn Mew as well in case you lack another Pokemon to absorb a burn from it. The defensive investment allows Gardevoir to avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Latios's Psyshock. The rest of the EVs are put into Speed, to make Gardevoir capable of outspeeding all defensive Pokemon and some slower offensive ones, such as Breloom and Tyranitar, and into Special Attack, to make Gardevoir hit very hard. A Timid nature improves Gardevoir's matchup against offensive teams by allowing it to outspeed Pokemon such as Jolly Excadrill, Pinsir on the turn it Mega Evolves, Jolly Landorus-T, and Timid Heatran. It also makes Gardevoir faster than Jolly Breloom and Jolly Bisharp on the turn it Mega Evolves, meaning Gardevoir can burn them with Will-O-Wisp before they can attack it, and makes Gardevoir capable of revenge killing most weather sweepers, as they usually do not run Speed-boosting natures. A Modest nature is, however, definitely viable if you would prefer the extra power instead.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set works best against stall and balance, destroying a lot of teams by just clicking Hyper Voice, using Focus Blast against Steel-types, and using Psyshock together with Taunt to get past dedicated special walls such as Chansey and Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. Gardevoir is not deadweight against offensive teams, however, because they usually have little to no switch-ins for it. Avoid physical attackers such as Azumarill, Talonflame, and Landorus-T, as Gardevoir has very poor physical bulk. Gardevoir actually has very good Special Defense, though, and it can use that to check Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Raikou, and Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo. Gardevoir can also use its typing to switch into Dragon-types and threaten them out with Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice, although it has to watch out for coverage moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pursuit support from Pokemon such as Bisharp, Weavile, and Tyranitar is very helpful to remove Jirachi, Victini, and Mega Metagross, which are common answers to Gardevoir. Pokemon that help Mega Gardevoir outspeed the foe are also great teammates, as its Speed is only decent. Tailwind support from Pokemon such as Talonflame, Latios, Mew, and Zapdos or Sticky Web support from Shuckle is also appreciated, as is Prankster Thunder Wave, which Thundurus and Klefki can dish out. Magnezone is a good teammate to remove bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn so Gardevoir does not have to rely on Focus Blast's low accuracy to defeat them. Partners to check Flying-types such as Raikou, Zapdos, and Tyranitar are mandatory because Gardevoir's Defense stat is horrible, and it is thus easily KOed by Talonflame's Brave Bird, as well as Mega Pinsir's Aerilate Quick Attack if weakened. Steel- and Dragon-types such as Heatran, Bisharp, Garchomp, Latios, and Latias are good teammates as well, because together with Gardevoir they can form a Dragon-Steel-Fairy core, which has great type synergy. Pokemon that can take advantage of Gardevoir's wallbreaking prowess are also good teammates. Talonflame pressures many of Gardevoir's checks, while Gardevoir pressures Talonflame's checks back in return. Sand Rush Excadrill handles all of Gardevoir's checks except for Bronzong, which is easy to take advantage of and not that difficult to accommodate for. In return, Gardevoir handles Chesnaught, Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Rotom-W.</p> "

  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, there seems to be little reason to use Magnezone in OU. It's slow, has crippling weaknesses to common attacking types, and faces stiff competition from other, better Electric-type options available, such as Thundurus. However, its signature ability, Magnet Pull, gives it the excellent niche of being able to trap and remove many common Steel-types, making it a good partner for certain sweepers, such as Mega Pinsir and Dragonite. It also has a whopping 11 resistances and one immunity, the most of any Pokemon in the game. However, at the end of the day, Magnezone is still a rather niche option, and it can struggle to be very effective outside of its niche, which is shrinking more and more by the generation.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A set with Analytic instead of Magnet Pull is usable, as it lets Magnezone hit insanely hard with Choice Specs, but Magnezone is rather outclassed outside of trapping Steel-types, so it isn't all that great. Magnezone can run a Substitute set with Leftovers, as Substitute protects it from being revenge killed after trapping a Steel-type and can allow it to get an extra KO before needing to switch out. Assault Vest is a decent item on Magnezone, as it has good bulk and a ton of resistances. However, its common weaknesses and lackluster power without a boosting item prevent such a set from being too effective. Hidden Power Ice is an option that hits Pokemon such as Garchomp and Dragonite, but Magnezone has no business staying in on these Pokemon a majority of the time and the loss of Hidden Power Fire can severely hinder its ability to do its job against other Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types, such as Garchomp, Excadrill, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Mamoswine, are a major thorn in Magnezone's side because they are immune to Volt Switch and Thunderbolt. In addition, they greatly threaten Magnezone with a STAB 4x super effective Earthquake or Earth Power. However, many of these Pokemon take massive damage from one of Magnezone's other moves, so they can't always freely switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types, particularly Terrakion, Conkeldurr, and Keldeo, can hit Magnezone hard with their super effective STAB moves. Despite this, they often take quite a bit of damage from Magnezone's moves and can easily lose momentum if they switch into a Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types, such as Talonflame, Heatran, Volcarona, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y, are very similar to Fighting-types in that they can easily check Magnezone but don't take its moves particularly well.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake: Other common Earthquake users, such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Venusaur, or Dragonite, can easily deal with Magnezone, as Magnezone cannot take even non-STAB Ground-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls such as Chansey do not mind Magnezone's moves in most cases and many of them can simply heal off its futile attempts to damage them.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch is a useful source of momentum for Magnezone, especially with a Choice Scarf. Hidden Power Fire is used in the second slot to 2HKO both Ferrothorn and Scizor, which Magnezone can trap with Magnet Pull and eliminate for its teammates. Flash Cannon serves as a consistent secondary STAB move that is useful for hitting Fairy-types super effectively and providing neutral coverage on Ground- and Dragon- types, which otherwise give Magnezone a hard time. Finally, Thunderbolt is used in the last slot for stronger Electric-type STAB.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf allows Magnezone to surprise the opponent potentially, as it's otherwise quite slow, and be a great cleaner late-game with STAB moves off its enormous base 130 Special Attack. It can also serve as a decent revenge killer to some Pokemon such as Mega Pinsir, Thundurus, and Talonflame. Maximum Special Attack investment is used to make the most of Magnezone's great base 130 Special Attack. Maximum Speed EVs with a boosting nature and a Choice Scarf allow Magnezone to outspeed everything slower than Thundurus, which is the majority of the unboosted tier. It also outspeeds non-Jolly Talonflame, which makes Magnezone a good check to teams that are centered around Flying-types.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Magnezone is a great late-game cleaner, 2HKOing a good portion of the metagame, and can revenge kill various threats throughout the game. It can also trap opposing Steel-types to help certain sweepers, such as Dragonite, Clefable, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Gyarados, sweep with more ease, though it only actually 2HKOes bulky Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Furthermore, Choice Scarf Magnezone can pick off weakened Excadrill after sand has ended. Thunderbolt should not be used very often, as Magnezone will be very easily exploited by common Ground-types, such as Excadrill and Landorus-T, if locked into Thunderbolt.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that struggle against bulky Steel-types, such as Dragonite, Mega Pinsir, Staraptor, Excadrill, Mega Tyranitar, Mamoswine, Latias, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Gyarados, really appreciate Magnezone's support to help them sweep. Magnezone is naturally fit for teams that have issues with said bulky Steel-types. Pokemon that resist moves that Magnezone is weak to, such as Azumarill, Latias, Landorus-T, and Latios, make good partners. Additionally, Stealth Rock users are really helpful, as Stealth Rock can help Magnezone get some important KOs. Finally, Landorus-T is one of the best teammates to Magnezone because it can form a VoltTurn core with it, having an immunity to Ground-type attacks, resisting Fighting-type attacks, and being able to set up Stealth Rock.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch gains tons of momentum, especially against opposing Steel-types, and can help it escape from revenge killers. Hidden Power Fire is used in the second slot as it OHKOes Scizor and Ferrothorn, both of which are very important for Magnezone to trap. Thunderbolt is used in the last slot for consistent secondary STAB that does not force Magnezone out, but it should not be used very often, as Pokemon locked into an Electric-type move are very easily exploited by common Ground-types, such as Excadrill.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment is used to make the most of Magnezone's great base 130 Special Attack. The listed Speed EVs let it outspeed minimum Speed Skarmory. The rest of EVs go into HP for more longevity. 144 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed minimum Speed Heatran, but beware that Heatran commonly runs Speed investment and can hit Magnezone much harder than it can hit back. Because of this, it is generally a better idea to use the given spread rather than to try and trap Heatran, which is risky. Choice Specs is the main item, as without it, Magnezone lacks the power to deal with many key threats.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The main goal of this set is to trap and eliminate opposing Steel-types that are causing trouble by walling its teammates. Magnezone is most effective at trapping Skarmory, Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Klefki, but it can occasionally trap Jirachi and Heatran as well. Because Ground-types love to switch into Magnezone, locking yourself into Volt Switch or Thunderbolt isn't often a good idea if the opponent has a Ground-type. However, this problem can be somewhat dealt with by good prediction, as most Ground-types hate switching into Magnezone's other moves. For example, Excadrill has a small chance of being OHKOed by Hidden Power Fire on the switch. Similarly, Flash Cannon has a chance of OHKOing Landorus-T and Gliscor on the switch after Stealth Rock. As this set's main targets are Steel-types, they are the Pokemon Magnezone should be switching in on most often. Ferrothorn and Skarmory in particular cannot touch Magnezone and are swiftly eliminated by it. Magnezone also outspeeds and OHKOes Scizor, but it must be wary of switching into Superpower.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Any Pokemon that needs certain Steel-types to be removed in order to sweep, such as Dragon Dance Dragonite, Swords Dance Mega Pinsir, or Calm Mind Clefable, makes a good partner for Magnezone. Teams that have trouble breaking through bulky Steel-types such as Skarmory or Ferrothorn as a whole also benefit from Magnezone as a teammate. Pokemon that can beat the bulky Ground-types that love to switch in on Magnezone, such as Rotom-W, Azumarill, or Manaphy, make good partners for it.</p> "

        "name": "Magnet Rise",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Magnet Rise is extremely helpful for Magnezone, making it immune to Ground-type attacks, which it is weak to, for 5 full turns. Hidden Power Fire 2HKOes most Steel-types, such as Mega Scizor, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn, even able to OHKO Mega Scizor after Stealth Rock damage if it doesn't have much Special Defense investment. This is extremely helpful in eliminating Steel- types for teammates to attempt a sweep later, such as Mega Gyarados, Dragonite, Mega Tyranitar, Mega Pinsir, and Staraptor. Finally, Thunderbolt and Flash Cannon serve as powerful, consistent moves, covering a wide variety of Pokemon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Air Balloon helps Magnezone check Excadrill, as it's too slow to use Magnet Rise before Excadrill attacks and in general gives it a chance against opposing Ground-types. Maximum Special Attack with a boosting nature maximizes Magnezone's damage output, which is extremely helpful, as it lacks a boosting item. The Speed EVs allow Magnezone to outspeed minimum speed Mega Scizor, while the rest of the EVs are dumped into HP for bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use this particular set of Magnezone carefully, as switching Magnezone around carelessly can result in losing its Air Balloon, which would result in making Magnezone unable to trap Excadrill later. Unless you are completely confident that Excadrill will use Earthquake, do not switch Magnezone directly in; instead, sack something and then send out Magnezone.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Magnezone set is most appreciated by teams that struggle with Excadrill, as it can trap it, removing the threat and allowing Magnezone's team to keep up its hazards. This is really helpful, as there aren't many viable spinblockers in the tier and none of them can spinblock Excadrill. Furthermore, Pokemon that struggle against bulky Steel-types, such as Dragonite, Latias, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Pinsir, Staraptor, Excadrill, Mega Tyranitar, Mamoswine, and Mega Gyarados, really appreciate Magnezone's support, which can also help them sweep later. Additionally, Pokemon that resist moves that Magnezone is weak to are really appreciated. Also, as this set effectively checks Excadrill, entry hazard setters can be slapped on the team to support other members of the team, including Magnezone; for example, non-specially defensive Mega Scizor has a good chance of being OHKOed by Hidden Power Fire after Stealth Rock damage. Finally, Landorus-T is one of the best teammates to Magnezone, forming a VoltTurn core with it, being immune to both Fighting- and Ground- type attacks, and setting up Stealth Rock.</p> "

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatran is an extraordinarily versatile and effective Pokemon in the OU tier. With excellent bulk and a nice defensive typing, it can serve as a check to an enormous amount of top-tier threats, such as Latias, Latios, Clefable, Mega Scizor, Talonflame, and Mega Charizard X. Due to these traits, it can serve as an effective bulky support Pokemon, boasting the ability to take advantage of many bulkier foes with the Taunt + Toxic combination. However, a defensive set is not all that Heatran can pull off in OU; it can also serve as an offensive Stealth Rock setter, stallbreaker, trapper, check to various Ground-type move users with Air Balloon, Choice Scarf user, and so much more. Having all these options means that Heatran can be molded to fit whatever purposes its team requires and is a true team player. Unfortunately for Heatran, it has weaknesses to Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks, which are extremely common in OU and threatening for it. Additionally, some of the Pokemon that Heatran is meant to handle can lure it in and then KO it, such as Superpower Mega Scizor, Knock Off Mega Venusaur, Earthquake Latios, and Focus Blast Clefable.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>SubToxic is a decent set for Heatran that allows it to put enormous pressure on opposing Pokemon by getting behind a Substitute and serving as a general nuisance to the opposing team by wearing down the foe with status and damage from Heatran's Fire-type STAB move. The primary issue is that it's walled by specially defensive Gliscor, a common threat, and is pretty much forced to run Taunt unless it wants to lose to Clefable. This forces it to forgo Protect, which makes Heatran play in a rather clunky manner by limiting its recovery and preventing it from getting useful extra turns of Toxic damage. Will-O-Wisp is a decent move choice for fast variants of Heatran, enabling it to check Bisharp effectively while also crippling Azumarill and Tyranitar. The issue with it as an option is that it gives Heatran no way of damaging Mega Charizard X or Talonflame and is less crippling to bulky Pokemon that don't mind the loss of Attack. A physically defensive EV spread is an option for the bulky set if the extra reliability against Talonflame and Mega Charizard X is appreciated. It also does some neat things such as allowing Heatran to survive a Close Combat from Mega Pinsir and an Earthquake from Latios with relative ease. However, this comes at the cost of either Speed or Special Defense, both of which are overall more useful for Heatran. Flame Charge provides somewhat of a surprise factor and lets Heatran clean up late-game. Rest fully heals up Heatran, but leaves it helpless as setup fodder for various sweepers. Heatran can also run Choice Specs in order to overwhelm Water-types that switch in such as Keldeo and Starmie and has effective wallbreaking capabilities, being able to 2HKO nearly everything in the tier that isn't Chansey.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types are the absolute best way of stopping Heatran, resisting its STAB moves and hitting it super effectively with their powerful attacks. Keldeo, Azumarill, Rotom-W, Manaphy, Gyarados, Starmie, and Suicune are just some examples taken from the myriad of Water-types in the OU tier that can switch into and pressure Heatran. However, most of these Pokemon are crippled by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Specially defensive Gliscor and Lum Berry Garchomp, outside of Hidden Power Ice, are flawless answers to Heatran, not caring about status and boasting a 4x super effective STAB move. Other versions of Garchomp and Gliscor in addition to Landorus-T, Diggersby, Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Excadrill (shaky due to its Fire weakness) are some examples of other Ground-types that, while they may not enjoy switching into Heatran due to a potential Lava Plume burn, they can put tons of pressure on it by virtue of their Ground-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Mega Lopunny, Terrakion, Keldeo, Gallade, and Hawlucha are some examples of powerful Fighting-type attackers that put immense amounts of pressure on Heatran. However, outside of Keldeo, they're not great switch-ins, as they fear a Lava Plume burn and are forced out by Choice Scarf variants.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Defensive Heatran absolutely despises Knock Off because Leftovers is its only form of recovery and is crucial to its survival. Mew, Mega Venusaur, and Ferrothorn are particularly effective users of the move because Heatran normally can switch into them for free and do as it pleases.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: As Heatran lacks recovery outside of Leftovers, smart play can allow it to be worn down via residual damage. Entry hazards and Leech Seed can potentially even limit Heatran's opportunities to switch in, as damage from them will rack up quickly so long as Heatran doesn't get too many Leftovers recovery turns.</p> <p><strong>Special Sponges and Pokemon that Resist Fire</strong>: Chansey, Blissey, Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Goodra can all tank Heatran's attacks easily by virtue of their bulk or resistances while being able to pressure it effectively. Chansey does not fare well against sets with Taunt, though, as it will be worn down quickly between Stealth Rock and potential Toxic damage without the ability to recover its health, so it has to be mindful of how frequently it switches in and how much health it is losing.</p> <p><strong>Lures: Due to Heatran's exploitable Water, Fighting, and Ground weaknesses, some Pokemon that lure in Heatran can opt to run moves in order to potentially KO or weaken it. Earthquake Latios, Surf Latias, fast Superpower Mega Scizor (only a threat to slower Heatran variants), Earthquake Mega Charizard X, Focus Blast Clefable, opposing Heatran with Earth Power, Hidden Power Ground Volcarona, Taunt Talonflame, and Knock Off Mega Venusaur are some examples of options that can be employed to prevent Heatran from handling these Pokemon effectively and even get it out of the way for a partner that struggles with it.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Lava Plume is a basic STAB option with a useful burn chance to punish common switch-ins, especially physical attackers such as Azumarill and Landorus-T. Toxic is critical for Heatran to cripple bulky Water-types, wear down Keldeo, and actually handle Roost Latios, Mega Charizard X, and Talonflame; it also prevents Pokemon from setting up for free. Taunt is is crucial for Heatran to deal with Calm Mind Clefable and is incredibly useful against balanced and stall teams, allowing Heatran to wear down defensive Pokemon, such as Chansey, Mandibuzz, and Mega Venusaur, when combined with Toxic and defeat slower Heatran that lack Earth Power. Protect is an excellent option to scout opposing Pokemon, prevent Choice Scarf Landorus-T from keeping momentum with U-turn, punish a potential double switch when it is first used, rack up Toxic damage, and increase Heatran's longevity by giving it extra turns of Leftovers recovery. Roar is another solid option to phaze setup sweepers, ensuring Heatran can deal with the likes of Mega Charizard X and Talonflame when Toxic damage won't be enough. The last slot is typically occupied by Stealth Rock because Heatran is perhaps the single most consistent Stealth Rock user in the OU tier, boasting a good matchup against every common Defog user, including Latios, Latias, Skarmory, Mandibuzz, and Zapdos, and threatening Adamant Excadrill while being able to set up the entry hazard on a high number of popular Pokemon. Earth Power prevents opposing Heatran from stalling this Heatran out with Taunt, hits Mega Diancie, and Mega Charizard X easier. Another option is Stone Edge if Heatran's team doesn't really have other ways of checking notable threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Talonflame, particularly Taunt variants. Ancient Power boasts perfect accuracy, but it doesn't do enough to specially defensive Talonflame variants to be worth it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EVs allow Heatran to outrun everything up to Jolly Mega Scizor and Jolly Mega Heracross, allowing Heatran to pick them off with Lava Plume. The HP EVs make Heatran as bulky as possible, in order to consistently take hits from the likes of Latios, while still being able to take on Fairy-types such as Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Diancie. Leftovers provides passive recovery which allows Heatran to deal with entry hazards more easily while being able to heal against forced switches against Grass- and Bug-types.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Heatran should be pivoted into Pokemon it beats, such as Latios, Clefable, Mega Venusaur, and Ferrothorn, in order to get Stealth Rock up as soon as possible; it can be pivoted in more recklessly than fast Heatran variants because it has more bulk to sponge hits. In some scenarios, it may be best to fire off a Toxic immediately in order to wear down a threatening Keldeo or Azumarill that will be more inclined to switch in directly when they anticipate Stealth Rock as opposed to Toxic. Scouting for lures such as Earthquake Latios and fast Superpower Mega Scizor is imperative with this set because you don't want to lose Heatran just because you were careless. If the opponent has a Pokemon that Heatran is necessary to deal with, such as Talonflame or Mega Charizard X, exercise extra caution. Due to its excellent special bulk, Heatran actually has the capacity to tank Scalds from bulky Water-types and even a Hydro Pump from Rotom-W and cripple them with a Toxic; unless keeping Heatran healthy is absolutely necessary, keep in mind the advantages of crippling these Pokemon with a Toxic, especially if wearing them down is compulsory for a teammate to sweep. Finally, if using Protect, keep in mind that it should only be used in scenarios in which it can't be punished; Protect can actually give certain foes of a free turn of setup if misused.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, Slowbro, Celebi, Ferrothorn, Latios, and Latias make for great teammates to deal with offensive Water-types, particularly Azumarill and Keldeo. A solid teammate that resists Fighting to switch into Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham is crucial; Clefable, Landorus-T, defensive Mega Altaria, and, Mega Slowbro, are some examples of Pokemon that can fulfill this role. A pivot for Landorus-T and physical Ground-types in general is pretty important; some choices are Rotom-W, Slowbro, your own Landorus-T, and Gliscor. A Pokemon that deals with Mega Diancie, as it shuts down Heatran completely outside of Lava Plume burns and OHKOes with Earth Power, is also recommended; Ferrothorn, Celebi, Chansey, Mega Scizor, and Mega Venusaur make for excellent partners due to this. Finally, Heatran should not be used as a sole answer for Latios or Scizor, as both have options to bypass it. Ferrothorn, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Clefable are great partners to deal with Earthquake Latios; Clefable is particularly effective, as it deals with many of the other threats mentioned. Mega Manectric, Keldeo, and Choice Scarf Magnezone are a few examples of teammates that can deal with Superpower Mega Scizor.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Stallbreaker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Heatran often lures in specially defensive walls and bulky stallbreakers, such as Chansey and Mew, and can trap them with Magma Storm; after doing so, Heatran can beat the foe with the combination of Taunt and Toxic. When playing against offensive teams, Magma Storm also deals nice chip damage to common threats to Heatran such as Keldeo and Azumarill, especially when your team has entry hazard users. Trapped foes cannot switch out, helping Heatran gain switch initiative, which really helps against offensive teams. Earth Power nails opposing non-Earth Power variants of Heatran, Tentacruel, and Mega Diancie; it is especially effective because opponents often assume that Leftovers Heatran are not running Earth Power. The move is also a solid option to hit Adamant Excadrill outside of sand without the risk of missing. Taunt is needed to stop Pokemon Heatran has trapped from recovering. It is also great against Calm Mind Clefable specifically, and while Magma Storm may not gain passive damage on this Pokemon, it does still trap it and, paired with Taunt, ensures that Heatran has a good chance beating it providing you do not allow it to get many boosts. Taunt also has the utility of preventing slower Stealth Rock setters from setting up the entry hazard and incoming Defog users from clearing the field of entry hazards. Toxic helps Heatran quickly whittle down threats such as Mew and Chansey, especially after they have been trapped by Magma Storm, as the passive damage racks up and these threats are dispatched of quickly. It also helps wear down common switch-ins such as Azumarill and Keldeo, making this annoying set even more difficult to switch into as well as being necessary to break stall, as it cripples bulky Water-types such as Slowbro. An interesting alternative is Solar Beam, which, combined with Power Herb, provides Heatran with a solid option to deal with Keldeo and Azumarill, which Heatran lures in. Moreover, it pairs well with Magma Storm's trapping capability to eliminate bulky Water-types such as Slowbro from the match. Lastly, Protect is another option that gives Heatran another turn of Leftovers recovery while also stalling out potential poison and Magma Storm damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread lets Heatran outspeed a plethora of threats such as Adamant Excadrill and Jolly Mega Heracross, both of which are decimated by Magma Storm; it also lets Heatran outrun and 2HKO standard bulky Will-O-Wisp Mega Charizard X with Earth Power. Other uses of the spread include outrunning Mega Tyranitar, standard stallbreaker Mew, Adamant Gyarados, Dragonite, Breloom, and Bisharp, giving Heatran the ability to cripple them with a Toxic, prevent setup with Taunt, or fire off a powerful Magma Storm. Maximum Special Attack investment is given to hit as hard as possible, wearing down stall quicker and making Heatran more difficult to switch into when facing against offensive teams. Leftovers is the preferred item due to the usefulness of passive recovery and ability to bluff standard defensive Heatran variants. Air Balloon is also an option if Ground-types, particularly Sand Rush Excadrill, pose a major threat to your team. Power Herb is slashed because it is required if using Solar Beam, eliminating the charge turn of the move and thus actually allowing Heatran to be used as an effective lure.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Playing with this set requires caution and prediction. When facing stall teams, it's usually a good idea to lead with Heatran and try to bait Pokemon such as opposing Heatran or Chansey , which can both usually be beaten, and pave the way for strong special attackers that are walled by Heatran or Chansey, such as Mega Charizard Y, Thundurus, and Volcarona, to break through the opposing team. When playing against more offensively oriented teams, Heatran needs to be played more carefully. Try to get it in on an opposing Scizor, Latios, or Latias and start to spam Magma Storm to wear down switch-ins and get some damage on the opposing team. This is particularly potent when combined with entry hazards to rack up even more residual damage. The choice between Leftovers and Air Balloon has a significant impact on how you use Heatran. With Leftovers, Heatran can be used to bluff a defensive set and claim victims such as Chansey and Heatran. Leftovers also gives Heatran more longevity, something that it loves to have against stall teams. With Air Balloon, Heatran can force a lot of switches against offensive teams against Pokemon such as Choice-locked Landorus-T, becoming a greater issue to deal with due to its temporary Ground immunity. As Air Balloon is a common item on offensive Heatran, keep in mind that the opponent will be more likely to scout for Earth Power. If using Solar Beam, exercise care in not using it unless you are sure it will connect with its intended target, as it is practically useless without the charge turn being eliminated by Power Herb.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set has quite a lot of utility. Heatran packs great resistances and immunities and can be used on just about any team. Steel typing with a Fire immunity lets Heatran check nearly every Grass-type in the game, and it is immune to Toxic and burns, making it a great asset. This set does appreciate entry hazard support in the form of both Spikes and Stealth Rock to help wear down switch-ins which are hit by Magma Storm. Ferrothorn is a great partner, as it can set up both entry hazards and has great synergy with Heatran, dealing with threats such as Kyurem-B, Azumarill, and Mega Gyarados. In general, Heatran is susceptible to strong STAB Fighting-, Water-, and Ground-type attacks. You need to make sure you have an answer for these. Latios and Latias are both great partners for Heatran, as they handle Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y pretty well. It's also worth adding that, against stall, Heatran often loves Healing Wish support from Latias, as it is easily worn down, increasing Latias's utility as a teammate. Landorus-T is also a great partner for Heatran, providing an answer to Earthquake Mega Charizard X, opposing Landorus-T, and Terrakion in addition to Stealth Rock support. Clefable is also worth a mention, as it's a great switch-in to Rotom-W, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gallade, all of which cause major issues for Heatran. Finally, Mega Venusaur partners well with Heatran, as it takes care of Keldeo, Azumarill, Thundurus, and Mega Lopunny.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>The main factor that distinguishes this set from more defensive Heatran variants is a powerful Fire Blast, which makes Heatran quite difficult to switch into. Alternatively, Magma Storm can be used to trap and whittle down slower defensive Pokemon such as Clefable, Hippowdon, and Gliscor. Earth Power provides important coverage on the likes of Mega Charizard X, Tentacruel, Mega Diancie, Tyranitar, and opposing Heatran. Flash Cannon targets Fairy-types which Heatran is used to check, such as Mega Altaria, Sylveon, Togekiss, and most notable, Clefable. Hidden Power Ice is another attacking option to hit Gliscor, Garchomp, Dragonite, as well as defensive Landorus-T. Finally, Stealth Rock is a fantastic move on Heatran and one of Heatran's main uses as an offensive Pokemon because Heatran pressures common forms of entry hazard removal. Stone Edge is an option in the third slot to hit the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. If one of the coverage moves in the second or third slots is not necessary due to team support, Taunt or Toxic can be used to cripple the likes of Chansey, Mew, and Water-types in general. Note that these moves work extremely well in tandem with Magma Storm to defeat said Pokemon one-on-one after trapping them.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EVs are simple yet effective, ensuring that Heatran outspeeds Mew, defensive Landorus-T, Breloom, Bisharp, Adamant Excadrill, and Mega Scizor while giving Fire Blast as much power as possible. Air Balloon is a useful item to cover Heatran's Ground weakness and is particularly useful for teams weak to Sand Rush Excadrill. On the other hand, Leftovers grants Heatran a rather significant amount of added longevity, which can definitely prove helpful in the long-term by making Heatran more difficult to wear down with repeated attacks; however, as this Heatran is generally run on more offensive teams, the utility of Air Balloon outweighs longevity in most cases.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Heatran should be played aggressively, punishing switches with status and breaking down defensive cores with the combination of Fire Blast and Taunt + Toxic. Taunt is also a solid choice to prevent an opposing Pokemon from setting up if required, and Toxic should typically be used on the switch, as Heatran does not want to stay in on the Water-types it wants to target with the move. Heatran should not be pivoted recklessly into attacks, however, as it lacks the longevity required to do so. If the opponent has a Pokemon that Heatran is required to deal with, such as Talonflame or Mega Charizard X, be sure to conserve its HP.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set is primarily useful on offensively minded teams that appreciate power as opposed to defensive consistency in Heatran. As it is rather easy to wear down due to its lessened bulk and lack of Leftovers if running Air Balloon, don't use it as the team's sole check to Pokemon such as Talonflame and Latios. Its offensive and defensive synergy is one of the primary reasons to put in on a team; its resistances and ability to take advantage of threats such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Clefable can make it a valuable contributor. Air Balloon should generally be used on teams that struggle with offensive Ground-types, particularly Sand Rush Excadrill. Partners to take on Fighting-types and Water-types that can take advantage of Heatran to some extent are crucial; some specific Pokemon that need to be covered are Mega Lopunny, Azumarill, and Keldeo. Mega Venusaur is a perfect partner for this role, handling all three effectively and synergizing well with Heatran overall as Heatran deals with Talonflame and Latios, which threaten Mega Venusaur greatly. Latios and Latias make for solid choices to check Keldeo, and Latias even provides Healing Wish support to increase Heatran's longevity if required. Both can also revenge kill Belly Drum Azumarill, which often uses Heatran as setup fodder. Mega Altaria checks both Mega Lopunny and Keldeo while having a favorable matchup against Azumarill if the Azumarill is a bit weakened and possessing the potential to set up for a sweep on these Pokemon. Mega Manectric, Thundurus, and Mega Sceptile are some other partners that can help pressure Water-types.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Overheat is the preferred STAB option for its sheer nuking power; for instance, Keldeo is only able to switch in once before being 2HKOed the next time it switches in. Its overall damage output, especially against Landorus-T and Mega Lopunny, is rather significantly greater than any of Heatran's other STAB options. That said, Fire Blast is a decent option if the lack of Special Attack drops is valued over a bit more power and accuracy. Flash Cannon is Heatran's secondary STAB attack and is very spammable; it also provides crucial coverage on Mega Diancie, Latios, Mega Altaria, Mega Gardevoir, Clefable, Kyurem-B, Azumarill, Tyranitar, and Terrakion. Earth Power hits Mega Charizard X and opposing Heatran, which are important enough targets to make it a solid move option. Hidden Power Ice is another solid choice for the third moveslot, allowing Heatran to revenge kill +1 Adamant Dragonite if its Multiscale is broken in addition to hitting Garchomp and providing crucial OHKOs on Landorus-T, and non-specially defensive Gliscor (it still 2HKOes specially defensive variants, which is useful). The last slot is filled with either Stone Edge or Ancient Power, which are both Rock-type attacks that are used to hit Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame. Stone Edge is typically the superior choice because it OHKOes Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, even with an Attack-reducing nature, something that Ancient Power does not do. However, Ancient Power is much more forgiving if the opponent chooses to switch out, as it hits off of Heatran's significantly higher Special Attack stat and boasts perfect accuracy as well as the necessary damage output on Mega Charizard X if Hidden Power is chosen over Earth Power. Moves such as Hidden Power Electric to prevent Gyarados from using Heatran as setup fodder and Toxic to cripple bulky Water-types can be substituted in depending on team-specific needs. Flamethrower and even Lava Plume are also options if a reliable STAB attack is desired; Lava Plume is meant to function like Keldeo's Scald, possessing the potential to cripple the likes of Azumarill and Gyarados if they switch into Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread provides Heatran with enough Speed to outrun Mega Lopunny and maximizes its power so as to increase its revenge killing capabilities. The remaining EVs are placed into HP for a bit of extra bulk. Timid is pretty much the only nature option, as outspeeding Mega Lopunny is crucial; Modest shouldn't be considered for the most part.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is generally meant to be played in a hit-and-run style, firing off an attack and then switching out. That doesn't necessarily mean that Heatran should always be switched out directly after attacking, as it should stay in if it has a favorable matchup, but the opponent's response to Heatran is usually something that forces it out, such as Keldeo or Azumarill. It can sometimes clean late-game with Flash Cannon, but situations that allow for this aren't that common. Although it does have some revenge killing utility, particularly for Dragon Dance Mega Altaria and—if it has Hidden Power Ice—Dragonite, the Choice Scarf is mainly used as a means to hit faster foes with Heatran's powerful attacks. In some scenarios, Heatran can be pivoted into Mega Charizard Y and Mega Gardevoir, though be wary of making this obvious, as they can predict the switch with Focus Blast; it's a decent mix-up if you've been playing around these Pokemon in different ways over the course of the match, however. This Heatran is a pretty poor direct switch-in for attackers such as Talonflame and Latios due to its low defensive investment and lack of Leftovers, so switch it into those Pokemon sparingly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Heatran should be used on offensive and balanced teams that appreciate Heatran's defensive contributions but already have a Stealth Rock user, need a leg up on faster Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, or require Heatran to check Mega Gardevoir and Mega Charizard Y. Azumarill and Keldeo are massive pains for Heatran, being able to switch in at least once depending on the set, making partners such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, Latios, Mega Altaria, Clefable, and Amoonguss effective teammates. Other Talonflame, Latios, and Latias checks are preferable, as this Heatran is not well-equipped to serve as a check to them due to its neutered defensive capabilities; the aforementioned Clefable and Ferrothorn can handle Latios and Latias effectively, while Rotom-W, defensive Landorus-T, Slowbro, and Hippowdon are good answers to Talonflame. In general, the defensive pivots mentioned are crucial so that your team has a safety net when Heatran is inevitably forced out by any of the ubiquitous Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attackers in the tier. Mega Charizard Y is a notable teammate that provides sun support for Heatran, increasing the damage output of Heatran's Overheat or Fire Blast to incredible levels.</p> "

  "Hawlucha": {
    "overview": "<p>Hawlucha has a high base Speed and an excellent ability, Unburden. Thanks to Unburden, Hawlucha's Speed is doubled after its item is removed or consumed, giving it the ability to outpace every unboosted Pokemon in OU. Hawlucha has a great Fighting / Flying typing that grants it excellent coverage as well as a neutrality to Stealth Rock. Hawlucha has a subpar base Attack stat compared to other Pokemon used in OU, which hinders its ability to break through common defensive Pokemon without boosting its Attack. It doesn't take hits very well because of its poor defenses. This limits its role to that of a late-game cleaner that relies heavily on Unburden.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stone Edge can be used to surprise a few Flying-type Pokemon that hope to switch in on High Jump Kick, such as Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, and Zapdos. Keep in mind that it won't have much use against Ground / Flying types such as Landorus-T and Gliscor, however. It's also not worth giving up Substitute's protection from attacks and pseudo-immunity to status. Taunt could also work over Substitute but, unlike Substitute, it fails to protect Hawlucha from attacks. Bulk Up is an alternative method of setting up, but lacks the instant power Swords Dance can provide and Hawlucha is very frail regardless so Defense boosts will not benefit it that well.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types: Zapdos is Hawlucha's biggest counter because it resists every attack on Hawlucha's moveset. Even at +2 Attack Hawlucha cannot OHKO Skarmory. Hawlucha has to rely on its teammates to weaken the aforementioned Pokemon. Talonflame and Pinsir are huge threats to Hawlucha, as they both can easily KO Hawlucha with their priority Flying-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Raikou, Rotom-W, Mega Manectric, Magnezone, and Thundurus can threaten Hawlucha before it activates Unburden. Raikou and Mega Manectric can outspeed and KO Hawlucha with their Electric-type STAB moves. Defensive Rotom-W can take two hits from High Jump Kick and KO or severely weaken Hawlucha. Choice Scarf Magnezone outspeeds and KOes Hawlucha with its Electric-type STAB moves. Thundurus can slow Hawlucha down with Thunder Wave so another teammate can revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro: Hawlucha fails to OHKO Slowbro after one Swords Dance boost and so has to rely on its teammates to weaken Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Clefable</strong>: Hawlucha's mediocre Attack makes it incapable of KOing Clefable before it's 2HKOed by Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Although non-super effective priority moves will not be able to OHKO Hawlucha, moves such as Azumarill's Aqua Jet, Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, Weavile and Mamoswine's Ice Shard can all be a huge thorn in Hawlucha's side as it cannot effectively set up and attempt to sweep with priority users still around. Talonflame deserves a mention in particular because of Gale Wings which makes revenge killing Hawlucha extremely easy, provided it doesn't have a Substitute.</p> ",
    "sets": [

        "name": "Substitute + Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute protects Hawlucha from status moves, such as Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Will-O-Wisp and provides it with a way of safely lowering its HP to consume Sitrus Berry and activate Unburden. Because Hawlucha's Attack stat is mediocre compared to other Pokemon in OU, Swords Dance is used to boost its Attack, supplying Hawlucha with the power it needs to pick apart weakened teams late-game. High Jump Kick is the most powerful Fighting-type move that Hawlucha has access to; it is also easily spammable and gives Hawlucha a tool to decimate opposing teams. Acrobatics is another strong and easily spammable attack; after Hawlucha has lost or used its Sitrus Berry, Acrobatics's Base Power is boosted to 110. Flying-type attacks are resisted by very few Pokemon, so Acrobatics should be Hawlucha's most-used move unless the foe is a Rock-, Steel-, or Electric-type.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The 12 HP EVs give Hawlucha an HP value that's divisible by 4, which allows its Sitrus Berry to be consumed after Hawlucha uses Substitute twice, thus activating its ability, Unburden. The remaining EVs are invested in Attack and Speed to maximize Hawlucha's offensive capability. A Jolly nature allows Hawlucha to outspeed a few threats, such as Latios, Latias, Raikou, Terrakion, Keldeo, and Speed tie with opposing Hawlucha before it receives a Speed boost from Unburden.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hawlucha should be used as a mid- or late-game cleaner, as it is most useful after its checks have been eliminated. Because of their Flying-type priority moves, Talonflame and Pinsir are two of its biggest checks and must be KOed before Hawlucha begins to setup. A few defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro, Garchomp, Zapdos, Clefable, and Mew should be weakened or KOed before setting up Swords Dance because Hawlucha has trouble breaking through them. Always switch Hawlucha in on a Pokemon it can force out, such as Chansey; use the free turn to set a Substitute up. After that, use Swords Dance as the switch-in breaks Hawlucha's Substitute. At this point, nothing should be able to outspeed Hawlucha so it should be able to set up another Substitute. Because its HP will drop below 50%, Hawlucha will consume its Sitrus Berry and activate Unburden. With +2 Attack and +2 Speed, Hawlucha is free to pick off the remaining Pokemon. Hawlucha can also be used at certain points mid- and early-game thanks to its high Speed letting it outrun Pokemon like Keldeo and Raikou, allowing it to revenge kill them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>A teammate that can check Talonflame and Pinsir is a necessity, as they both can easily KO Hawlucha with their priority Flying-type moves. Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Landorus-T are a few examples of Pokemon that excel at checking Talonflame and Pinsir. A teammate that can easily pressure offensive and defensive teams complements Hawlucha well. Gengar is a great example this because of its versatility and power. Gengar can effortlessly eliminate defensive threats, such as Clefable, Doublade, and Slowbro. Gengar can also get rid of offensive threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, making it significantly easier on Hawlucha to sweep late-game. A teammate that can provide entry hazard support is also vital because entry hazards can wear down the opposing team, making it easier for Hawlucha to perform a late-game sweep. Stealth Rock is the most important entry hazard because it does a great job of limiting the amount of times Flying-type Pokemon can switch in. This is great to deal with Talonflame and Pinsir, as well as defensive checks such as Zapdos.</p> <p>A teammate that does a great job of breaking down defensive Pokemon is extremely useful, as Hawlucha doesn't have the raw power to break through some defensive Pokemon. Mega Gardevoir fits this role perfectly, as it lures Pokemon such as Heatran and Chansey, two walls that Hawlucha has no problem setting up on or KOing. Mega Gardevoir can also KO Pokemon that Hawlucha has trouble dealing with, such as Zapdos, Mew, Clefable, and Slowbro. Adding a teammate that can check Electric-types such as Thundurus, Mega Manectric, and Raikou, would make it easier for Hawlucha to perform late-game sweeps; examples include Mega Latias, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Tyranitar, and Excadrill.</p> "

  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>With a seemingly average defensive and offensive typing, Mega Venusaur may not seem like much, and, to be fair, this instantaneous critique isn't completely unjust. Mega Venusaur's defensive typing leaves it weak to the relatively common Flying- and Psychic-type moves in the OU metagame, which makes Mega Venusaur a liability when facing many common OU threats, including Latios, Mega Metagross, Mega Alakazam, Talonflame, and Tornadus-T, while its offensive typing makes it easily switched into by prevalent bulky Steel-types such as Jirachi, Mega Metagross, and Heatran. Furthermore, as a Mega Evolution, Mega Venusaur lacks Leftovers recovery, and, as a Pokemon with only Synthesis for reliable recovery, it is heavily hurt by sand and rain as well as entry hazards, thus making up a Pokemon very easily worn down.</p> <p>Nevertheless, because of Mega Venusaur's defensive and offensive capabilities, it is a standard Pokemon on stall, balanced, and bulky offensive teams. Its defensive typing is perhaps its biggest asset, giving it resistances to Fighting-, Grass-, Water-, Electric-, and Fairy-type moves, and in tandem with its ability Thick Fat and impeccable bulk, it allows Mega Venusaur to check many common threats in OU, including Keldeo, Mega Altaria, Azumarill, Pursuit Bisharp, Clefable, Mega Diancie, Mega Gyarados, Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, Ferrothorn, and Mega Manectric. Mega Venusaur is also relatively versatile, capable of running an offensive set, more suited to switching into and checking foes with offensive force, or a defensive set that is used more for hard walling threats.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Earthquake can be used on either of the standard sets to cripple Heatran, a very common switch-in. A Life Orb sun sweeper set with Growth can be effective when paired with Mega Charizard Y. Sleep Powder is an option for the defensive set to use on a predicted switch, incapacitating the switch-in and therefore allowing momentum to switch to the side of Mega Venusaur and its team. A Swords Dance set with Power Whip and one of Knock Off or Earthquake can turn Mega Venusaur into a devastating lure and a bulky setup sweeper.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: As long as Mega Venusaur isn't running Earthquake, Heatran will always be able to wall it. However, Leech Seed and Sleep Powder annoy Heatran, and, if it's merely a specially defensive variant, Heatran won't even be able to 3HKO Mega Venusaur. However, Mega Venusaur is unable to do over 10% to it with Giga Drain and is likely to get burned, so Heatran is nevertheless a very good switch-in. Other Fire-types, in spite of Mega Venusaur having Thick Fat as its ability, also deal with it pretty well, with Victini, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Charizard X all acting as solid checks to it.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Flying-types are capable of demolishing Mega Venusaur with their STAB moves. Tornadus-T, Togekiss, Talonflame, and Mega Pinsir are all capable of crippling Mega Venusaur with their STAB moves. However, it should be noted that a well-timed Sludge Bomb or Sleep Powder from Mega Venusaur annoys all of them.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Mega Alakazam, Alakazam, Mega Medicham, Mega Gallade, Latios, Latias, Mega Latias, Reuniclus, and Mega Gardevoir all demolish Mega Venusaur with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Provided that Mega Venusaur isn't running Knock Off, Chansey risks nothing by switching into it.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-B</strong>: Kyurem-B's Teravolt allows it to hit Mega Venusaur super effectively with Ice Beam, and therefore it easily 2HKOes defensive variants of Mega Venusaur and OHKOes offensive variants after Stealth Rock damage.</p> ",

Sludge Bomb is a more powerful STAB move that lets Venusaur check Grass- and Fairy-type Pokemon, including Celebi, Breloom, Azumarill, Mega Altaria, and Clefable. It's also a great move to use on a predicted switch, as many Pokemon capable of switching into a Giga Drain and forcing Mega Venusaur out, such as Life Orb Tornadus-T, Latios, Thundurus, Mega Pinsir, and Talonflame, are crippled by Sludge Bomb.

Chlorophyll allows Mega Venusaur to revenge kill Pokemon on the turn in Mega Evolves if it is in the sun.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Your first goal when playing Venusaur should be to Mega Evolve as soon as possible, as without being Mega Evolved, Venusaur is hit super effectively by Fire- and Ice-type moves and also has far less bulk. Mega Venusaur does have good bulk, but it's imperative not to switch Mega Venusaur into Pokemon, even those handled by its typing, unless there wouldn't be any negative consequences or the situation is dire. Mega Venusaur has the freedom to switch into Clefable, Rotom-W, Keldeo, Alomomola, Landorus-T, Mega Manectric, and Azumarill, but it needs to be extremely wary of getting worn down, largely from the foe using U-turn or Volt Switch on it, burns, and switching Mega Venusaur into Stealth Rock. Because Mega Venusaur lacks Leftovers recovery, it gets worn down quickly from all of these elements, which severely cuts into its longevity. If you can, avoid switching Mega Venusaur directly into anything, and instead check threats when given a free switch. When selecting a move to use, Giga Drain is your best friend; Mega Venusaur is worn down quickly and really appreciates the recovery Giga Drain gives it. If you get Mega Venusaur in safely and see a Flying- or Dragon-type capable of switching into a Giga Drain and checking Mega Venusaur, use Sludge Bomb, as it does a surprising amount of damage to these potential checks. Additionally, while you can always switch Mega Venusaur safely into Ferrothorn, remember that Mega Venusaur cannot OHKO it with Hidden Power Fire. Overall, your goal with Mega Venusaur should be to switch into Pokemon it beats, deal massive damage, heal, and then switch out before it takes excessive damage. You have to be really careful with Mega Venusaur, because if you play recklessly, Pokemon that Mega Venusaur should be able to beat, such as Mega Diancie, can beat Mega Venusaur instead.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Venusaur absolutely despises being burned by Rotom-W and Keldeo, so Heal Bell or Aromatherapy users and burn absorbers such as Celebi, Clefable, Reuniclus, and Starmie are practically mandatory teammates. Celebi doubles as a counter to both Rotom-W and Keldeo, so it also can take the strain off of Mega Venusaur to deal with these Pokemon. Healing Wish Latias can also prove to be a great teammate, potentially healing Mega Venusaur of any unwanted burns while recovering Mega Venusaur's HP. Mega Venusaur also despises having to take entry hazard damage because entry hazards cut into Mega Venusaur's longevity, which helps Landorus-T and Mega Diancie's beat it. Entry hazard removers such as Latias, Latios, Starmie, Zapdos, Mandibuzz, and Excadrill can therefore make for good teammates. Psychic-types such as Reuniclus, Latios, Latias, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Alakazam also threaten Mega Venusaur. Bronzong can wall Latios, Latias, and Gardevoir, while Bisharp can deal with all of them with either Sucker Punch or Pursuit. Flying-types such as Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, and Tornadus-T are also a problem for Mega Venusaur. Rhyperior can deal with the former two as well as Superpower Tornadus-T, while Zapdos can check the latter two. Tyranitar may seem like a poor teammate, due to its sand nerfing Mega Venusaur's recovery, but Choice Scarf Tyranitar is actually a great one, eliminating Latios, Latias, and Starmie with Pursuit. Similarly to Tyranitar, Hippowdon may seem like a poor teammate because of Sand Stream, but, in reality, it's a great one, checking Flying-types and VoltTurn teams while appreciating Mega Venusaur's role as a Manaphy check. Additionally, to bypass the conflict between Sand Stream and Synthesis, try to use Sand Force Hippowdon when you're using it and Mega Venusaur on the same team.</p> <p>Additionally, Scizor and Conkeldurr can deal with Kyurem-B for Mega Venusaur, while Manaphy, Slowbro, and Landorus-T can deal with Heatran. Chansey is exceptionally annoying for Mega Venusaur to deal with, and as such Victini, Heracross, and Terrakion can make for great teammates. Both offensive and defensive pivots are immensely useful, as they make it easier for Mega Venusaur to switch into moves and give it more time to use Synthesis, therefore bolstering its longevity. Slowbro and Slowking are useful as more defensive pivots with Regenerator, Assault Vest Tornadus-T acts as a defensive Regenerator pivot with U-turn, and Raikou, Scizor, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T can all act as offensive pivots. Essentially, any teammate capable of dealing with a Pokemon that Mega Venusaur cannot makes for a great teammate, as Mega Venusaur's defensive abilities can prove to be a wincon in some games.</p> "

        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Giga Drain lets Mega Venusaur check Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types such as Keldeo, Azumarill, Landorus-T, and Mega Diancie while recovering some of Mega Venusaur's health. Sludge Bomb acts as a much more powerful STAB move that in spite of the lack of Special Attack investment, can hit neutrally-damaged targets such as Mega Pinsir pretty hard. However, its main purpose is to allow Mega Venusaur to check Fairy- and Grass-types such as Clefable, Sylveon, Breloom, and Serperior. Synthesis provides semi-reliable recovery, which lets Mega Venusaur easily stall out many more Pokemon. Hidden Power Fire lets Mega Venusaur deal with Scizor and Ferrothorn, although Knock Off can be used instead to hurt Latios on the switch and to allow Mega Venusaur to check Gengar while removing its Life Orb. Leech Seed is another option, whittling away at a foe's HP while simultaneously recovering Venusaur's HP.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>20 Speed EVs are used outpace Adamant maximum Speed Azumarill accounting for Hidden Power Fire's IV drop. However, only 16 Speed EVs are needed if you choose to run Knock Off or Leech Seed. Maximum HP investment is used for better neutral bulk, and 144 Special Defense EVs are used to cushion powerful special attackers such as Keldeo, specifically allowing it to take one Life Orb-boosted Psychic from Alakazam. The rest of the EVs are put in Defense to allow maximum physical walling potential, while Chlorophyll allows Mega Venusaur to revenge kill Pokemon in the sun.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Defensive Mega Venusaur is a lot bulkier than offensive Mega Venusaur, so it struggles less with taking passive damage. However, Stealth Rock damage and burns still bother it immensely and should be avoided at all costs. Regardless, countering Pokemon such as Attack-invested Mega Diancie, Earth Plate Landorus-T, and Life Orb Mamoswine is a lot easier now because of the added bulk, which gives Mega Venusaur more wiggle room in taking entry hazard damage. Still, you should try to Mega Evolve as soon as possible, because not having Thick Fat while having lower defenses is not ideal for a wall. Once in, you should use the move that'll help the most in the given scenario. It'll usually be Giga Drain, because the name of the game when playing Mega Venusaur, especially defensive Mega Venusaur, is recovering health. However, don't be afraid to use one of your other moves, namely Sludge Bomb if you're expecting a Flying-, Grass-, Fairy-, or Dragon-type switch-in, Knock Off if you're expecting Latios, Latias, or Gengar, or Leech Seed if you're expecting anything other than a Grass-type. Also, remember that when defensive, Mega Venusaur loses a lot of its offensive prowess and thus cannot OHKO or 2HKO some Pokemon that it used to be able to, such as Mega Diancie, Landorus-T, and Mega Altaria.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heal Bell, Aromatherapy, Healing Wish, and burn absorption support is crucial for Mega Venusaur's success in OU, as it'll often find itself switching into Scald and possibly Will-O-Wisp, so Celebi, Starmie, Reuniclus, Clefable, and Latias can make for good teammates. Excadrill, Starmie, Latios, Latias, Zapdos, and Mandibuzz can all remove entry hazards, and therefore can act as useful teammates for Mega Venusaur, reducing the amount of passive damage it's forced to endure. Psychic-types such as Reuniclus, Latios, Latias, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Alakazam all threaten Mega Venusaur immensely. Bronzong can wall Latios, Latias, and Gardevoir while Bisharp can deal with them all with Pursuit and Sucker Punch. Flying-types such as Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, and Tornadus-T are also a problem; to remedy this problem, Rhyperior can be used as a teammate to deal with the former two as well as Superpower Tornadus-T, while Zapdos can be used to check the latter two. Pokemon capable of dealing with Heatran, such as Manaphy, Slowbro, and Landorus-T, can also prove to be great teammates, as can Pokemon that are able to deal with Chansey, such as Heracross, Victini, and Reuniclus.</p> <p>Hippowdon can also act as a great teammate, checking Flying-types as well as VoltTurn teams, which are known for being able to wear Mega Venusaur down, while appreciating Mega Venusaur's ability to act as a Manaphy check. In spite of this, be aware that Sand Stream inhibits Mega Venusaur's recovery, so Sand Force is likely the best ability choice. Slowking, Slowbro, Assault Vest Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Raikou can all act as pivots that augment Mega Venusaur's recovering capacity. The first three are able pivots thanks to Regenerator, while the latter four are great because they have access to either U-turn or Volt Switch. Basically, any teammate capable of dealing with a Pokemon that Mega Venusaur cannot makes for a great teammate.</p> "

  "Charizard": {
    "overview": "<p>Blessed with being the only Pokemon in OU with two Mega Evolutions, Charizard has found both of them to be top-tier threats. The first forme, Mega Charizard X, is known to be one of the best Dragon Dancers in the entire tier; the combination of a base 130 Attack and essentially a 1.33x boost on both of its main STAB moves thanks to Tough Claws allows it to OHKO most foes at +1 with STAB Flare Blitz, meaning it can sweep almost effortlessly through teams, especially given how easy it is to set up with such a great defensive typing. Furthermore, Mega Charizard X can utilize its amazing typing, bulk, and movepool to be very unpredictable; it can run a variety of sets, including a defensive set that utilizes Will-O-Wisp and even a Double Dance set that contains both Swords Dance and Tailwind to bring the pain on both defensive and offensive teams, respectively. Given all these traits, Mega Charizard X is simply one of the best Pokemon in OU and offers a lot as a Mega Evolution.</p> <p>The second forme, Mega Charizard Y, is the most powerful wallbreaker in OU. At first glance, Mega Charizard Y's amazing Fire STAB type and base 159 Special Attack make it appear to be a powerful wallbreaker in and of themselves. However, Mega Charizard Y's claim to fame is its ability, Drought, which boosts its STAB Fire Blast's power even further, allowing it to OHKO or severely dent a significant portion of the tier, and makes Solar Beam a 120-Base Power Grass attack that takes only one turn to use, nullifying Water-types as possible checks. With Focus Blast rounding out the coverage, most of the metagame is in huge danger to Mega Charizard Y bar a select few—these are mostly limited to opposing Dragon-types such as Latios, Latias, Dragonite, Mega Altaria, and bulky Mega Charizard X and dedicated special walls such as Chansey and Cresselia. All of the aforementioned Pokemon are very easy to take advantage of, however; with the use of stallbreakers and Pursuit trappers, it is easy enough to clear a path for Mega Charizard Y. Outside of these Pokemon, Mega Charizard Y simply will dent the opponent's team every time it comes in, provided it can hit.</p> <p>However, Charizard's base 100 Speed for both formes is no more than good and leaves it outpaced in such a quick metagame, which is compounded by a quadruple Stealth Rock weakness that severely hinders it from executing its job effectively—it is very easy to take advantage of this with the use of priority moves or faster attackers that can finish it off at such low health. Mega Charizard Y is an extremely easy Pokemon to pressure; while it OHKOes an absurd number of Pokemon, it often can be outsped and KOed by faster Pokemon unless it switches out, which can ruin the momentum at times. Mega Charizard X, on the other hand, is worn down very quickly between Stealth Rock damage, Flare Blitz recoil, and general miscellaneous damage. This makes it harder to sweep and wallbreak to an extent. However, despite these flaws, Charizard is no less than a metagame-defining Pokemon and should be looked at as such.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Iron Tail is an alternate coverage move for Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X to hit Mega Altaria, which otherwise gives the set trouble because it resists both of Mega Charizard X's STAB moves and takes only neutral damage from Earthquake. Mega Charizard X can use a set of Roost and three attacks in order to combine its excellent dual STAB types, coverage, and longevity, but it faces stiff competition from other wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B and Latios.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>There are no Pokemon that hard counter Charizard, as it has such impressive stats and diversity in its sets. It does have a variety of checks depending on the set, though, which must be scouted first.</p> <p><strong>Respective Defensive Pokemon: While Charizard's Mega Evolutions require different responses, they do in fact have defensive answers, albeit rather few. Mega Altaria is a solid check to both Mega Charizard formes, as it resists Mega Charizard X's STAB combination and can threaten to set up a Dragon Dance, while Mega Charizard Y's coverage of Fire / Grass / Fighting is ineffective against Mega Altaria. Mega Charizard X is very difficult to switch into, especially because it can boost its Attack. Assuming the standard offensive sets (as Will-O-Wisp from the defensive one greatly cripples many potential answers), Quagsire, Landorus-T, Rhyperior, and Hippowdon are its most reliable counters, all of which threaten it with STAB Earthquake. However, Quagsire can be 2HKOed by Outrage, Landorus-T and Rhyperior lack reliable recovery, and Hippowdon, even with full Defense investment, can be worn down with entry hazards until Mega Charizard X can force its way past it. Slowbro can recover off damage and doesn't care too much about Will-O-Wisp, though it is actually OHKOed by +1 Outrage from a Dragon Dance set after some prior damage; however, this is not the case with Mega Slowbro, which can tank an attack and proceed to use Thunder Wave or Scald. Although typically not physically defensive, Heatran can stomach many hits and stall with Toxic if Mega Charizard X lacks Earthquake. Azumarill gets a special mention for resisting every common attack Mega Charizard X has while not being weak to Earthquake; however, like most of the aforementioned Pokemon, it is severely crippled by Will-O-Wisp. Additionally, Assault Vest Azumarill can beat Mega Charizard Y one-on-one, making it a solid check to that. Mega Charizard Y's reliable switch-ins are also limited to specialized specially defensive Pokemon. Blissey and Chansey wall Mega Charizard Y hard and can heal back the damage while stalling it out with Seismic Toss or Toxic. Assault Vest Goodra is also notable for taking a pittance from its attacks and can attack back with hard-hitting moves, though it can be a poor choice against other Pokemon in the metagame, as it lacks reliable recovery, meaning that it can be worn down over a game's span. Hippowdon's sand limits Solar Beam to being a two-turn move and halves its power, and Hippowdon can use this opportunity to OHKO Mega Charizard Y with Rock Slide or Stone Edge. Politoed can also do this, except it summons rain instead of sand, which decreases the power of Fire Blast. Physically defensive Gliscor can beat Mega Charizard X due to its access to STAB Earthquake and high defenses, given that it has not taken any prior damage. Bulky Tyranitar can beat Mega Charizard X too, as it can take an Earthquake and retaliate with Stone Edge. Specially defensive Gyarados can check Mega Charizard X with Intimidate and can even counter Mega Charizard Y by being able to hit it hard with Waterfall even in sun and by resisting its main STAB move and not taking much from Solar Beam or Focus Blast. Cresselia can check both Mega Charizard formes with its enormous bulk and can threaten with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Offensively Inclined Bulky Pokemon: Mega Charizard X has very few answers outside of revenge killing it or using a dedicated defensive Pokemon on a stall or balanced team. However, Mega Charizard Y has a few common offensive responses that can actually switch into it. Without the rare Earthquake, Mega Charizard Y lacks good coverage against Fire-type Pokemon, though Drought's power boost allows it to often 2HKO frailer ones. Opponents can rely on bulkier Fire-types as good offensive responses. Specially defensive Talonflame can take Mega Charizard Y's typical attacks very easily and wear it down with Brave Bird. Mega Charizard X itself also hard walls any set without the rare and suboptimal Dragon Pulse and can proceed to set up on it or hit Mega Charizard Y hard with its powerful Dragon-type attacks. Entei risks being 2HKOed by Fire Blast or Focus Blast, but it can tank one of these attacks in a pinch and respond with Stone Edge or Extreme Speed. Fire-types aren't the only offensive answers, though; many Dragon-types can function similarly as checks, sometimes even if it is carrying Dragon Pulse. Latios, Latias, and Garchomp are all faster than Mega Charizard Y and can tank at least one attack before hitting back with a powerful attack of their own. Specially defensive Dragonite can also tank Mega Charizard Y's attacks with the aid of Multiscale and set up or attack it. RestTalk Mega Ampharos is a powerful Pokemon that can switch into Mega Charizard Y and use a powerful Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Mega Charizard Y's Speed is rather average and isn't boosted by any move on its common sets. This makes it very vulnerable to revenge killing from powerful Pokemon with super effective STAB moves. Thundurus, Terrakion, Keldeo, Mega Diancie, and many other common threats all possess super effective or very strong neutral moves while outspeeding it naturally. When using a Choice Scarf, some other common Pokemon such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, Diggersby, and Tyranitar can also surprise and revenge kill it. Revenge killing Mega Charizard X is a bit more complex, though it is almost always the most practical solution for defeating it when using an offensive team. Not all Choice Scarf users can outspeed it after a boost, however. At +1 Speed, Adamant Mega Charizard X can be revenge killed by a few Choice Scarf users, including Garchomp, Terrakion, Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Kyurem-B, all of which can OHKO it with their STAB moves. With a Jolly nature, however, only the first two listed Pokemon can outpace it. While priority would normally be an answer, Mega Charizard X is physically bulky enough to withstand a couple of Ice Shards, Mach Punches, Aqua Jets, and Bullet Punches, with Roost to heal any damage that is racked up through a combination of priority moves. Talonflame's Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird gets a special mention, though, as it can deal up to 86% damage instantly to offensive variants. To an extent, Thunder Wave from Prankster Thundurus is also problematic because it completely nullifies Mega Charizard X's Speed boosts, making it susceptible to a wider range of revenge killers. Sand is a very effective way to beat both Mega Charizard formes, as Mega Charizard X and Y aren't able to break through Hippowdon and the former isn't able to beat bulky Tyranitar, while Excadrill in the sand outspeeds and OHKOes both. Mega Aerodactyl can outspeed both sets if they're not boosted and can OHKO them with Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Both of Charizard's Mega Evolutions are susceptible to an overload of passive damage. Mega Charizard X is more affected by this, as it takes recoil damage from Flare Blitz. However, some bulky Ground-types can use Toxic on either Mega Evolution before being 2HKOed, which allows them to wear Charizard down slowly. Perhaps the most significant form of passive damage that can be inflicted on either Charizard is Stealth Rock, which strips non-Mega-Evolved Charizard and Mega Charizard Y of half their health; Mega Charizard X still takes a heavy 25% damage from the entry hazard. Another issue is Ferrothorn, which, while OHKOed by Mega Charizard X's Flare Blitz, inflicts Iron Barbs recoil in addition to the regular Flare Blitz recoil.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance simultaneously boosts Mega Charizard X's Attack and Speed, allowing it to sweep weakened teams. Flare Blitz in tandem with Tough Claws provides ridiculous damage output, capable of OHKOing many foes unboosted and severely denting almost everything in the metagame at +1. To give a measure of its power, Mega Charizard X's unboosted Flare Blitz matches the power of +2 Adamant Garchomp's Dragon Claw. Dragon Claw completes the feared Dragon / Fire coverage and is a safe option to use against Water-types as well as when the player wishes to avoid recoil. Roost keeps Mega Charizard X healthy and helps mitigate Flare Blitz recoil as well as avoid Sucker Punch mind games. Earthquake is an option that allows Mega Charizard X to beat Heatran and bulky variants of Tyranitar, but the extra longevity provided by Roost is generally more useful. Fire Punch is an option over Flare Blitz if recoil tends to be a problem, but it is seriously discouraged due to its significantly lower damage output.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment is used to hit as hard as possible, and a Jolly nature is used to outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Jolly Choice Scarf Excadrill, Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, and Modest Choice Scarf Keldeo. This spread also allows Mega Charizard X to outspeed neutral-natured base 100 Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir and Mega Medicham as well as most Kyurem-B before a Dragon Dance. Alternatively, a slightly bulkier spread of 104 HP / 220 Atk / 184 Spe can be used to have a good chance to survive two Hydro Pumps from Rotom-W while still outspeeding Choice Scarf Landorus-T after a boost and OHKOing uninvested Landorus-T after Stealth Rock damage. If outspeeding the previously mentioned Choice Scarf users after a boost is not a concern, a spread of 96 HP / 252 Atk / 160 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Excadrill, Jolly Mega Scizor, and Mega Heracross while providing a noticeable boost in power. Running an Adamant nature specifically allows Mega Charizard X to 2HKO Azumarill after Stealth Rock damage and grants a high chance at 2HKOing mixed defensive Hippowdon after Stealth Rock damage. Blaze is the chosen ability before Mega Evolving despite being very situational, as Solar Power would accomplish nothing other than reducing HP at times.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It's best to set up Dragon Dance towards the end of the game, when Mega Charizard X's checks and counters are out of play or have been weakened enough to be picked off after a boost. Mega Charizard X should set up on Pokemon that it forces out, such as Mega Scizor and Celebi, or against Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Raikou. If running HP investment, Rotom-W is an easy target to set up on, as it can't 2HKO Mega Charizard X with Hydro Pump and is stalled out with Roost. Take note of Charizard's typing change upon Mega Evolving; for example, not Mega Evolving against Latios after it uses Draco Meteor allows Mega Charizard X to safely set up Dragon Dance on it, whereas Mega Charizard X sets up on non-Thunder Wave Thundurus with ease thanks to its neutrality to Hidden Power Ice and resistance to Thunderbolt.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard removal is an absolute must, as having Charizard lose half its health makes a huge difference in the game. Excadrill is the best option for this, as it can remove hazards with Rapid Spin while preserving your own and has good synergy in general with Mega Charizard X. In addition, Swords Dance Excadrill can severely weaken physically bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Slowbro to assist Mega Charizard X's sweep. The two of them also pair very well on sand teams, as Mega Charizard X can set up on or deal immense amounts of damage to the likes of Rotom-W, Celebi, and Mega Venusaur, which are bothersome to common Pokemon on these archetypes. Latios can nuke the opposition while using support options such as Tailwind and Memento to prepare for a sweep, in addition to clearing entry hazards for Mega Charizard X with Defog. Mew can support Mega Charizard X with Defog, while Mega Charizard X can absorb Knock Off for it. Powerful physical attackers such as Garchomp, Talonflame, and Terrakion can weaken or overwhelm Mega Charizard X's checks and counters. Grass-types such as Celebi and Serperior put immense amounts of pressure on the bulky Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types that are used to check Mega Charizard X. In addition, Celebi can take further advantage of these Pokemon by setting up a Substitute and passing it to Mega Charizard X for safety during setup. Chesnaught and Tangrowth work as well to combat sand teams, which are problematic for Mega Charizard X. Jirachi is a very notable teammate, as it can provide Healing Wish support, check Mega Altaria and Mega Diancie, and lure in bulky Water- and Ground-types and KO them with Grass Knot. Water-types such as Manaphy and Azumarill also pressure Rock- and Ground-types that bother Mega Charizard X, and the former can break down defensive cores for Charizard to clean up late-game.</p> "

        "name": "Wallbreaker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>In the sun provided by Mega Charizard Y's Drought, Fire Blast OHKOes or 2HKOes nearly all Pokemon that don't resist it as well heavily denting those that do. Flamethrower is a slightly less powerful alternative that is more reliable due to its perfect accuracy. Solar Beam doesn't require an extra turn to charge thanks to the sun, and it hits Water-types such as Azumarill, Suicune, Slowking, Slowbro, and Manaphy for great damage. Focus Blast rounds off Mega Charizard's coverage, targeting Tyranitar and Heatran. Roost keeps Mega Charizard Y healthy and somewhat mitigates Stealth Rock damage. Alternatively, Earthquake deals significantly more damage to Heatran than Focus Blast, but it does pitiful damage to Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment is used to hit as hard as possible. A Timid nature allows Mega Charizard Y to Speed tie with other positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon, namely Manaphy, as well as Jolly Excadrill outside of sand and maximum Speed Kyurem-B. If outspeeding these Pokemon is not required, a Modest nature can be used for a significant increase in Mega Charizard Y's wallbreaking potential. If using a Modest nature, a spread of 40 HP / 252 SpA / 216 Spe provides some bulk while still outspeeding neutral-natured maximum Speed Kyurem-B. Note that Fire Blast is best used with a Timid nature and Flamethrower is best used with a Modest nature, as the high power of Fire Blast makes up for the decrease in power by not using a Special Attack-boosting nature; conversely, when using a Modest nature, Mega Charizard Y can afford to use a slightly weaker move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y is best played as an early- and mid-game wallbreaker, utilizing its high-powered STAB moves along with its near-perfect complementary coverage movepool. The best way for Charizard to get in safely is through a double switch, a Volt Switch, or U-turn user. However, more aggressive plays such as switching into Ferrothorn's Stealth Rock or Clefable's Moonblast can be useful depending on the given situation. Note that the risk of such plays can result in Mega Charizard Y being crippled by a potential Leech Seed or Thunder Wave. Keeping Stealth Rock off the field is important to maximize Mega Charizard Y's wallbreaking, as if Mega Charizard Y takes Stealth Rock damage, it is forced to use Roost more often and thus waste turns that could have been used to attack. Take advantage of the switches Mega Charizard Y tends to force into the likes of Latias, Latios, and Chansey in order to pressure them with a double switch into the appropriate teammate.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard removal is one of the most important aspects to cover with Mega Charizard Y's teammates, so the likes of Excadrill, Latios, and Latias make for good partners. In addition to providing Rapid Spin support, Excadrill has good offensive synergy with Mega Charizard Y, as it can break past some of the specially bulky Pokemon that Mega Charizard struggles with while in return Mega Charizard Y can plow through physically bulky Pokemon such as Rotom-W and defensive Landorus-T. Latios and Latias provide useful resistances to Water- and Electric-type attacks, and the latter provides Healing Wish support so that Mega Charizard Y can be played more recklessly at times. Mew is another option for Defog support, as it can reliably beat Chansey one-on-one with the use of Taunt and Knock Off. Pursuit support from the likes of Tyranitar, Weavile, and Assault Vest Metagross is essential to remove Latios and Latias, both of which are some of Mega Charizard Y's most common offensive checks. In addition, these Pokemon can either cripple Chansey, in the case of Weavile and Bisharp, or heavily dent it with their STAB moves. Other Pokemon to deal with Chansey, including Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Keldeo, make for good teammates too.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers and spreads residual damage, deterring the likes of Landorus-T, Azumarill, and Tyranitar from switching in. Even with minimal Attack investment, Flare Blitz hits very hard against neutral targets. Flare Blitz is also important to deal substantial damage to Clefable. Roost heals half of Mega Charizard's HP, extending its longevity. Earthquake targets Heatran, which gives Mega Charizard X problems, as it can absorb Will-O-Wisps and Flare Blitzes due to Flash Fire. Dragon Claw is an alternative option that doubles as a reliable STAB move; it is especially useful to hit opposing Dragon-types that don't mind being burned by Will-O-Wisp such as Latios, Latias, and Hydreigon, which otherwise could gain offensive momentum by pivoting into an Earthquake or a Flare Blitz given they are healthy. Dragon Claw also hits Mega Charizard Y, which this set can check in a pinch. Dragon Tail can be used to phaze setup sweepers such as Manaphy and Reuniclus and is useful to rack up entry hazard damage. However, it is not fully accurate and is significantly weaker than Dragon Claw.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP EVs are used to minimize the damage taken from Stealth Rock. 160 Speed EVs allow Mega Charizard X to outspeed Adamant Excadrill, Jolly Mega Scizor, and Jolly Bisharp.

Choosing the time to Mega Evolve can be very important at times when one set of resistances is more important than the other, such as when spamming Roost on Latios's Draco Meteor before Mega Evolving. Be sure to keep entry hazards off the field and preserve Charizard throughout the match if your opponent has a threat that Mega Charizard X checks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard removal is very important for Mega Charizard X due to its crippling weakness to Stealth Rock. Due to how this set fits best on more balanced or defensive teams, the likes of Skarmory and Mew make for very good teammates to fulfill the role of entry hazard remover. Skarmory has excellent type synergy with Mega Charizard X, as it covers Ground- and Dragon-types to some degree while Mega Charizard X checks Fire- and Electric-types, which bother Skarmory. Mew appreciates having a bulky Mega Evolution to fall back on to absorb Knock Offs, as without Leftovers, it is pressured to use a recovery move more frequently. Regenerator Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Slowbro, Slowking, and Amoonguss pair well with Mega Charizard X, as they fit on the balanced builds that this set is typically used on and appreciate Mega Charizard X's pivot support. Physical sweepers such as Swords Dance Garchomp appreciate the likes of Landorus-T and Slowbro being whittled down by Will-O-Wisp.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance doubles Mega Charizard X's Attack, allowing it to plow through defensive cores. Roost is an alternative to provide Mega Charizard X with recovery, allowing it to heal off recoil and entry hazard damage. Flare Blitz is boosted by Tough Claws and deals massive damage to anything that does not resist it, even heavily denting some less bulky Pokemon that do resist it. Dragon Claw is a reliable secondary STAB move that hits most Pokemon that resist Fire for solid damage and has the benefit of not making Mega Charizard X suffer recoil damage, unlike Flare Blitz. Outrage is significantly more powerful than Dragon Claw, most notably 2HKOing Quagsire and having a high chance to OHKO Slowbro at +2, but it has the cost of locking Mega Charizard X into the move.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature is used to hit as hard as possible, and 216 Speed EVs allow Mega Charizard X to outspeed maximum Speed neutral-natured Kyurem-B and below. A Jolly nature can be used to Speed tie with opposing positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon and outspeed neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon as well as Jolly Excadrill outside of sand, but without an Adamant nature, Mega Charizard X loses out on quite a bit of wallbreaking power, most notably losing the ability to OHKO Azumarill after Stealth Rock with a +2 Flare Blitz.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With this set, it is important to assess the given matchup to determine how Mega Charizard X should be played throughout the game. Versus more offensive teams, it is generally best to just outright attack when Mega Charizard X forces a switch early- or mid-game and, if possible. Against balanced and defensive builds, set up a Swords Dance when Mega Charizard X forces a switch on the likes of Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and defensive Starmie. Don't set up if your opponent has a Quagsire; using Outrage on a forced switch is more beneficial. If possible, eliminate Unaware and Prankster Pokemon before attempting to set up in order to give Mega Charizard X much more breathing room. While Mega Charizard X can break through Quagsire with two Outrages and Clefable is cleanly 2HKOed by Flare Blitz, eliminating Quagsire means that Charizard doesn't have to lock itself into Outrage (or can forgo it for Dragon Claw), and eliminating Clefable is helpful because it can stall Mega Charizard X out between Wish and Protect. In most other scenarios, using Outrage generally has more risk than reward, so be wary of locking Mega Charizard X into the move.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard removal is very important, so teammates such as Excadrill, Latios, and Starmie fit well. Sand Rush Excadrill greatly appreciates Mega Charizard X's wallbreaking ability so it can clean up late-game versus offensive teams. Excadrill also appreciates Mega Charizard X's ability to set up on and eliminate Rotom-W and remove Slowbro if it is running Outrage. Azelf and Klefki can provide dual screens support, and the former provides Stealth Rock to wear down Mega Charizard X's checks and Explosion to get it in safely. Grass-types such as Celebi and Serperior have good offensive synergy with Mega Charizard X, most notably being able to pressure or eliminate Quagsire, which is a major nuisance to Mega Charizard X because it ignores its boosts with Unaware. Swords Dance Mega Charizard X struggles versus offensive teams, so fast Pokemon that perform well against those such as Weavile and Choice Scarf Jirachi pair well with it; the latter also provides Healing Wish support to give Mega Charizard X another chance at sweeping.</p> "

  "Beedrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Beedrill's Attack and Speed increase drastically upon Mega Evolving, turning what is arguably one of the worst Pokemon in the game into a terrifying glass cannon with the stats and ability to make its attacks really sting. Despite its newfound stat increases and ability making its STAB attacks incredibly powerful, it has poor coverage and still remains incredibly frail. On top of its frailty, it has a weakness to Stealth Rock that limits the number of times it can come in.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Beedrill doesn't really have any other effective options. Toxic Spikes, Swords Dance, and Defog might have merit in theory, but the only place they could fit is on Beedrill's coverage moveslot, as Protect is mandatory to Mega Evolve safely, and it does not have any bulk to utilize these moves effectively. Pursuit is another option to trap Pokemon such as Latias, Latios, and Starmie.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Beedrill is difficult to check with defensive Pokemon or Pokemon that resist its moves because of its ability to U-turn out without taking any damage. However, it still has switch-ins and methods of being checked effectively; defensive ones just aren't always perfect at the job because they don't punish Beedrill for getting momentum with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Beedrill likes to use U-turn frequently in order to keep up momentum. It is pretty difficult to land a hit on it directly due to its great Speed, so keeping up Stealth Rock is helpful as it will limit Beedrill to four switch-ins.</p> <p><strong>Priority and Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Beedrill may be fast, but it will not be able to outspeed Choice Scarf users with over base 80 Speed, such as Landorus-T, Keldeo, and Latios. It also has pitiful defenses, so priority attacks will deal significant damage to it if it has taken Stealth Rock damage or been weakened a bit in some other manner.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Landorus-T, Hippowdon, Gliscor, Alomomola, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor can all take a hit from Beedrill, and some are immune to poison. Be wary of the combination of Knock Off and a trapper if using Skarmory, however.</p> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Iron Barbs: Rocky Helmet on Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Skarmory, Alomomola, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn can punish Beedrill for using U-turn, causing it to lose almost 17% of its health in the process. Garchomp and Ferrothorn are particularly effective because of their abilities Rough Skin and Iron Barbs, respectively; when these abilities are combined with Rocky Helmet, Beedrill loses a total of 29.2% of its health by going for U-turn. Even without Rocky Helmet, these Pokemon are capable of punishing Beedrill's U-turn effectively by virtue of their abilities alone.</p> ",

        "name": "U-turn",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Protect is a necessity seeing as Beedrill does not get the Speed boost on the turn it Mega Evolves. Protect also enables it to scout movesets, Choice items, and potential priority attacks. U-turn is Beedrill's go-to move to gain momentum and just a very powerful move in general to get chip damage. Poison Jab is Beedrill's strongest attack and has a great secondary chance of poisoning the opponent. Poison along with Protect helps Beedrill wear down opposing Pokemon. Knock Off is one of the most versatile moves in the game and does exceptionally well against stall. Using Knock Off on Steel-types with Shed Shell can allow a Magnet Pull user to trap them later on in the game. Knock Off really excels at dealing with a lot of Beedrill's checks; Landorus-T, Heatran, and Magnezone do not appreciate their items being removed, and Gengar gets OHKOed by it. Meanwhile, Drill Run is primarily for Steel-types without Levitate, such as Heatran, Excadrill, and Magnezone, that resist both Beedrill's STAB attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread makes Mega Beedrill as powerful as possible and lets it outspeed threats such as +1 Mega Altaria, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Manectric while Speed tying with opposing Mega Beedrill and Mega Sceptile.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is incredible at maintaining momentum, so keeping up pressure with entry hazards is a great way to weaken the opposing team little by little. Try to keep entry hazards off your side of the field, as Mega Beedrill is quite frail and has a chance to get OHKOed by priority users such as Mamoswine and Dragonite after just one switch into Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Landorus-T and Rotom-W work pretty effectively as a core with Beedrill. They're both great pivots and have access to U-turn and Volt Switch respectively. Magnezone pairs up very nicely if Beedrill is utilizing Knock Off for Shed Shell Steel-types and also has the ability to form a VoltTurn core with Beedrill. Choice Scarf Magneton may not be as powerful or bulky as Magnezone, but it is capable of outspeeding base 115 to 130 Speed Pokemon that Magnezone cannot outspeed. Latias, Latios, and Excadrill are great partners for keeping Stealth Rock off the field, which ultimately gives Beedrill more opportunities to stay in the game.</p> "

  "Nidoking": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoking is a very scary wallbreaker in the OU metagame thanks to its huge offensive movepool, as well as Sheer Force bolstering its power even further. Its Poison / Ground typing allows it to function as a very solid Clefable switch-in, and thus it has a great matchup against balanced teams that use Clefable. However, despite being able to easily beat one of the biggest threats in the metagame, Nidoking has its fair share of flaws that prevent it from being a top-tier threat. Nidoking's Speed leaves it outpaced by the majority of offensive threats, though it outspeeds Pokemon like Mega Altaria, Gardevoir prior to Mega Evolution, and Heatran. Nidoking also lacks bulk, leaving it vulnerable to faster attackers and priority users. Furthermore, it faces strong competition from other wallbreakers such as Manaphy, Gengar, Alakazam, and Kyurem-B because they are either faster, stronger, or bulkier.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Nidoking has access to Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, but it would rather run an extra coverage move. It also faces strong competition as a Toxic Spiker from Dragalge and Scolipede. Nidoking can run Choice Scarf in order to improve its matchup against offensive teams, but it loses out on too much power and thus can't wallbreak effectively. Nidoking can run Superpower to deal extra damage to Chansey and Air Balloon Heatran, but this usually requires a lot more Attack investment.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Pokemon such as Weavile, Tornadus-T, Mega Lopunny, Mega Manectric, Raikou, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Diancie, Excadrill, Keldeo, Manaphy, and Mega Metagross are all capable of outspeeding Nidoking and dealing massive damage to it, if not outright OHKOing it.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers: Priority moves from the likes of Azumarill, Scizor, Weavile, Bisharp, and Talonflame are all capable of dealing massive to Nidoking, which can make it even easier to revenge kill.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Mega Latias are capable of easily walling Nidoking because of their high Special Defense and access to recovery.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types such as Alakazam, Mega Metagross, Mega Medicham, Latios, Latias, and Mega Gallade are all capable of outspeeding and OHKOing Nidoking, but Alakazam is OHKOed by Sucker Punch. Even though the aforementioned Pokemon are all capable of OHKOing Nidoking, they all have difficulty switching in outside of Latias.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types such as Keldeo, Manaphy, and Starmie are all capable of outspeeding and OHKOing Nidoking, while Choice Band Azumarill can OHKO it with Aqua Jet. Politoed and Slowking can also take a few hits from Nidoking and proceed to OHKO it.</p> ",

        "name": "Wallbreaker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earth Power is Nidoking's most spammable STAB move and hits Pokemon like Heatran, Magnezone, Bisharp, and Metagross before it Mega Evolves. Sludge Wave is slightly more powerful and hits Fairy-types such as Clefable, Mega Altaria, Gardevoir before it Mega Evolves, and Sylveon. It also hits Grass-types such as Breloom and has great coverage alongside Earth Power. Ice Beam allows Nidoking to OHKO Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus-T and 2HKO Hippowdon. Flamethrower hits Steel-types such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. Flamethrower is powerful enough that Fire Blast isn't recommended. Sucker Punch can be used to OHKO Mega Alakazam after prior damage and Gengar with no prior damage and helps pick off weakened Pokemon like Latios and Latias. Sucker Punch should be run over Flamethrower, as Earth Power already deals huge damage to Flamethrower's targets outside of Skarmory.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment maximizes Nidoking's damage output, while maximum Speed investment allows Nidoking to Speed tie with Heracross and outspeed the likes of bulky Garchomp, Heatran, Mega Altaria, Gardevoir before it Mega Evolves, and Adamant Excadrill. Life Orb along with Sheer Force boosts Nidoking's power to incredible levels. Sheer Force also negates Life Orb recoil on attacks with secondary effects, giving Nidoking more longevity than other wallbreakers. If running Sucker Punch, a Naive nature with 16 Attack EVs should be run to guarantee the OHKO on Mega Alakazam with Stealth Rock on the field.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because Nidoking lacks bulk, it struggles to switch into a lot of Pokemon easily and appreciates free switches provided by Volt Switch or U-turn support and double switches. However, Nidoking can easily switch into Clefable and pressure its team immensely, which is Nidoking's main advantage over other wallbreakers. When Nidoking is on the field against slower teams, just use the appropriate coverage move, and against faster teams, use the appropriate coverage move to hit faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Mega Metagross, Latios, and Gengar that can switch into at least one of Nidoking's STAB moves when they switch in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because Nidoking struggles to switch into a lot of threats, it appreciates having Volt Switch or U-turn support. Defensive Landorus-T is immune to the Ground-type moves that threaten Nidoking and helps with Nidoking's bad matchup against sand teams, while Nidoking is capable of breaking a lot of Pokemon that check it such as Ferrothorn, Garchomp, and bulky Water-types in general. Tornadus-T is capable of checking fast Water- and Grass-types such as Keldeo and Serperior. Raikou can help check faster Electric-types such as Mega Manectric, Thundurus, and opposing Raikou, as they all deal heavy damage to Nidoking with Hidden Power Ice. Raikou also helps check the likes of Gengar if Nidoking lacks Sucker Punch, as well as checking Keldeo and Talonflame. Klefki and Ferrothorn are capable of using Spikes to capitalize on Nidoking's wallbreaking ability and Thunder Wave to provide speed control and slow down faster Pokemon, allowing Nidoking to pick them off more easily. Klefki is notable for its ability to switch into Weavile and force it out. Though it lacks Spikes, Clefable can spread paralysis too, and it can pressure teams with the threat of a Calm Mind sweep thanks to Nidoking's ability to remove Steel-types for it. Tank Garchomp punishes powerful priority moves and helps weaken Pokemon by phazing them with Dragon Tail. Latias can switch into Electric-types and Keldeo and can provide Healing Wish support, which helps Nidoking if it gets worn down too quickly.</p> <p>Mega Lopunny, Mega Alakazam, Mega Manectric, Bisharp, and Weavile are all capable of pressuring offensive teams, which Nidoking doesn't have a decent matchup against, while Nidoking helps break bulkier Pokemon for said sweepers. Mega Manectric forces a lot of switches and provides Volt Switch support for Nidoking, while Nidoking can weaken Hippowdon, a notable counter to Mega Manectric. Mega Alakazam is also notable for its ability to handle weather teams with Trace. Pokemon weak to Clefable such as Latios appreciate having Clefable weakened so that it can be picked off easily. Substitute + Swords Dance Garchomp appreciates having Unaware Clefable weakened and Togekiss removed because they are both capable of walling it. Mega Scizor and Talonflame appreciate bulky Ground-types being weakened, while Nidoking appreciates their good matchups against offensive teams. Pokemon like Azumarill and Breloom are also good teammates for their ability to OHKO Excadrill and beat Hippowdon. Pokemon like Talonflame, Azumarill, Klefki, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp have great matchups against rain teams, which trouble Nidoking heavily. Fighting-types such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and Breloom are all capable of breaking Chansey, which walls Nidoking completely. Fairy- and Dark-types such as Mega Gardevoir, Mega Altaria, Clefable, Bisharp, and Weavile are capable of handling bulky Dragon-types that can wall Nidoking such as Mega Latias.</p> "

  "Clefable": {
    "overview": "<p>Clefable was a top-tier Pokemon when Generation 6 was coming to a close, and it seems hard to believe that it has only gotten better since then. With a Fairy typing leaving it weak to only Steel- and Poison-types, a wide movepool, good defenses, and Magic Guard, Clefable became a staple on almost every ORAS OU team. By virtue of its bulk, Clefable can take on many threats to the metagame such as Weavile, Gliscor, Slowbro, Mega Lopunny, and more. When using Calm Mind, Clefable becomes the most threatening Pokemon in this tier, able to sweep any team late-game with minimal support. However, Clefable does not just function as a standalone late-game cleaner; it is also a top-tier support Pokemon, being able to spread status with Thunder Wave, set Stealth Rock, and even remove items with Knock Off. However, due to Clefable’s top usage, there has been a surge in Mega Metagross, Leftovers Excadrill, specially defensive Gliscor, and more Pokemon to check it. Clefable is also rather susceptible to Thunder Wave and Knock Off from Pokemon it usually checks such as Rotom-W, Slowbro, Ferrothorn, and Tornadus-T. Despite teams always running countermeasures for Clefable, it continues to adapt and remain at the very top of the ORAS OU metagame.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Unaware is another option that could be used on stall teams, but it is completely outclassed by Magic Guard and used better by Quagsire. Healing Wish can be used with Calm Mind or Stealth Rock, bringing back a teammate at low health after Clefable has done its job. Trick with a Choice Scarf can be used to cripple opposing setup sweepers such as Gliscor, Suicune, and Clefable, but bear in mind that Clefable fails to outspeed many Pokemon without heavy investment in Speed. Toxic can cripple Slowbro but is generally less useful than Thunder Wave. Stored Power alongside Calm Mind can be used to blow through Pokemon such as Quagsire and Chansey.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Mega Metagross is the best offensive counter to Clefable, being able to OHKO it with Meteor Mash while not minding any of its moves barring a Life Orb-boosted Flamethrower or Thunder Wave. Excadrill with Leftovers walls most Clefable sets and can continuously switch in and force it out. Magnezone is able to check Clefable with Flash Cannon and fish for critical hits or Special Defense drops. Heatran can shut down Clefable with Taunt, preventing it from using Soft-Boiled, Thunder Wave, and Calm Mind. Mega Scizor comes in on any set that lacks Flamethrower and uses Clefable as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Mega Charizard Y can force Clefable out with Flamethrower and isn’t threatened by anything barring Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave. Choice Specs Keldeo heavily damages Clefable and even 2HKOes non-specially defensive Clefable after a Calm Mind with Hydro Pump. Choice Specs Latios’s Psychic can 2HKO Clefable and cripple it with Trick.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Pokemon: Calm Mind Mega Slowbro can set up alongside Clefable and OHKO it with a boosted Psyshock. Swords Dance Gliscor beats any Clefable set without Ice Beam. Suicune with Substitute can PP stall Clefable or phaze it with Roar.</p> <p><strong>Fire- and Poison-types: Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y can switch into Clefable with relative ease, only being threatened by Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt. Amoonguss can put Clefable to sleep and remove its boosts with Clear Smog. Venusaur can use Knock Off to remove Clefable’s Leftovers or Life Orb and proceed to heavily damage it with Sludge Bomb. Heatran takes little from Clefable’s attacks and can cripple it with Taunt to force it to attack and waste its PP. Volcarona can set up alongside Clefable lacking Thunder Wave and out damage it with Fire Blast.</p> ",

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind boosts Clefable’s Special Attack and Special Defense, making it both immensely threatening to bulkier teams and incredibly hard to revenge kill. Moonblast is Clefable’s strongest STAB move and boasts a 30% chance to drop the opponent’s Special Attack, aiding in Calm Mind wars against opposing Clefable. Flamethrower is typically chosen as the coverage move of choice, preventing Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Excadrill, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Bisharp from switching in freely or setting up. Ice Beam is your next best alternative coverage option so Clefable is not walled by specially defensive Gliscor, and it provides additional support when facing off against opposing Clefable thanks to its 10% chance to freeze. Thunder Wave is useful for crippling opposing Clefable, Mega Metagross, and Tornadus-T, to name a few; however, it is very undesirable to be hard walled by Gliscor and Excadrill. Soft-Boiled is used to keep Clefable healthy throughout the match and allow it to continuously check opposing Pokemon.</p> <p>There are a great number of acceptable options for Clefable’s last move. Bear in mind that if you are using a mono-attacking set, Moonblast is the most ideal attack of choice. Stealth Rock can be used with Calm Mind for role compression. Encore is an option to lock opposing Clefable, Gliscor, and Mega Slowbro into a boosting move. Knock Off removes Leftovers from Excadrill, Heatran, and other Clefable, aiding its late-game sweep. Thunderbolt in combination with Ice Beam allows Clefable to break through traditional counters such as specially defensive Talonflame, Heatran, and Gliscor. Psyshock is a niche option that allows you to beat other Clefable much more easily and helps with Pokemon such as Suicune and Roost Volcarona.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Defense in tandem with Leftovers allows Clefable to survive a myriad of threats to common OU teams. Attacks such as Choice Band Weavile’s Icicle Crash, boosted Gliscor’s Earthquake, Mega Lopunny’s Return, Choice Scarf Tyranitar’s Stone Edge, and Jolly Mega Medicham’s High Jump Kick into Zen Headbutt are not able to 2HKO Clefable. Magic Guard gives Clefable an immunity to status and entry hazards damage, making it incredibly hard to wear down. A more mixed defensive spread with a Calm nature is perfectly viable, providing a more reliable check to Tornadus-T, Choice Specs Keldeo, and Mega Alakazam. Keep in mind that Ice Beam should only be used on physically defensive EV spreads, as Gliscor’s boosted Earthquakes will 2HKO Clefable otherwise.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Clefable is an amazing early-game pivot, able to switch into relatively weak Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Tornadus-T with ease. By virtue of its Fairy typing, Clefable is able to stomach many strong attacks from common Pokémon such as Latios, Weavile, Medicham, and Lopunny. Clefable can even serve as a scout to Pokemon such as Crawdaunt and Keldeo; however, keep in mind that their attacks will deal a large chunk of damage; meaning that Clefable can only switch in once before having to use Soft-Boiled. Magic Guard also allows Clefable to function as a status absorber, taking Scald burns and Toxic that may annoy the team. Flamethrower should be used early-game to chip down the Steel-type that your opponent chooses to send out, while Thunder Wave should be used to inflict status on would-be checks such as Metagross and Heatran. When Clefable’s checks are either significantly weakened or removed, Calm Mind may be used to clean up the remainder of the opponent’s team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Magnezone, particularly with a Choice Scarf, is a great partner, as Magnet Pull allows it to trap Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, and Excadrill, the latter two only if weakened. Gliscor is also a fantastic partner, able to beat almost all of Clefable’s checks and appreciates Clefable being able to switch into Water- and Ice-type attacks. Fire types such as Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, Talonflame, and Volcarona are among the best switch-ins to Clefable. Pokemon such as Garchomp, Tyranitar, and Heatran can check these Pokemon thanks to their resistances and bulk while supporting Clefable by setting Stealth Rock. Latios can function as a temporary check to the threatening Fire-types, but without recovery it will be able to switch in a limited number of times, and it will need a Choice Scarf to outspeed a boosted Volcarona. Rotom-W acts as a pivot on more offensive teams, as it is able to spread status and can safely get Clefable onto the field. Spikes support from Ferrothorn and Skarmory helps wear down the opposing team. Bulky Water-types such as Mega Slowbro and Gastrodon can pivot into Steel- and Fire-types that threaten Clefable and can set up with Calm Mind and Curse, respectively, becoming additional wincons. Mega Scizor; forms a bulky setup core with Clefable it’s able to switch into Steel-types such as Metagross and Excadrill, and it appreciates Clefable being able to switch into Rotom-W. Scizor is also able to remove Heatran's Leftovers for Clefable or outright KO it with Superpower.</p> "

Moonblast can be used instead, but keep in mind that you can no longer punish Excadrill attempting to use Rapid Spin, so you will need to have teammates that can punish it. Thunder Wave spreads paralysis, and provides good support for Clefable’s teammates crippling Pokemon such as opposing Clefable and Tornadus-T. Knock Off is a great utility option used to remove Leftovers from common defensive Pokemon, making them easier to wear down.

Jellicent is a shakier check to the previous Pokemon, but it has the added niche of preventing Starmie from using Rapid Spin and reliably switching into Keldeo and Slowbro. Latios makes a good pairing with Clefable on more offensive teams and appreciates Clefable’s ability to check Dragon-, Dark-, and Ice-types along with slowing down Tornadus and wearing down Steel-types with Flamethrower. On bulkier teams, Mega Latias can provide support through Thunder Wave and Calm Mind.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Moonblast is Clefable’s strongest STAB move and is very difficult to switch into when boosted by a Life Orb. Ice Beam has useful coverage, being able to OHKO Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. Soft-Boiled allows Clefable to remain healthy to be able to continuously break through the opponent’s team. Calm Mind in combination with Life Orb makes Clefable an efficient stallbreaker and allows it to win Calm Mind wars. Flamethrower heavily damages Mega Metagross, Ferrothorn, Bisharp, and other Steel-types that would switch into Clefable.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>72 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature allow Clefable to OHKO specially defensive Gliscor. 12 Speed EVs allow Clefable to outspeed Tyranitar with no Speed investment, but more importantly to Speed creep other Clefable. Maximum HP investment alongside 172 Def EVs allows Clefable to better check Pokemon such as Garchomp and Gliscor.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The lack of Leftovers and Defense investment on this set means that you won’t get as much use out of using Clefable as a counter to many of the Pokemon it normally beats; Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Weavile are able to 2HKO Clefable with their STAB moves. Instead, this set should be used as a mid-game wallbreaker and late-game cleaner. Throwing out Moonblast once Stealth Rock has been set is your best option at breaking, as few Pokemon can continuously switch in. When facing a boosted Gliscor, use Ice Beam to OHKO it and fire off Flamethrower on predicted Steel-type switch-ins. Calm Mind can be used late-game or if your opponent has a Calm Mind Clefable. With Life Orb, Clefable will almost always beat opposing Clefable in a Calm Mind war.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pivots such as Tornadus-T and Rotom-W can bring Clefable in safely. Gastrodon, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn can all help check Mega Metagross with the added bonus of checking Weavile, which this set cannot do. Thunder Wave users such as Ferrothorn, Mega Latias, and Rotom-W aid Clefable in Calm Mind wars versus opposing Clefable. Psychic-types like Latios and Mega Alakazam appreciate Clefable weakening Steel-types with Flamethrower. Steel-types like Bisharp and Excadrill benefit from Gliscor being knocked out by Ice Beam.</p> "

  "Alakazam": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Alakazam possesses the highest Special Attack in the tier and incredible Speed, allowing it to function as a revenge killer and wallbreaker. Before Mega Evolving, Alakazam has the ability Magic Guard, allowing it to bypass entry hazards like Spikes and Stealth Rock while also avoiding damage from certain status moves like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp. After Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam gains the ability Trace, allowing it to copy abilities like Flash Fire from Heatran, Sand Rush from Excadrill, Regenerator from Tornadus-T, and Levitate from Latios. However, Mega Alakazam is very reliant on its Speed, making it scared of being hit by Thunder Wave from Pokemon like Rotom-W, Latias, Slowbro, and Clefable or Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T, which can outspeed and threaten it. Mega Alakazam's poor defensive stats also make it unable to reliably switch into attacks, and priority moves like Sucker Punch from Bisharp and Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor and Mega Metagross can also prove to be problematic, as they can OHKO it or do a significant amount of damage to it.</p> ",

        "name": "Mega Alakazam",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>STAB Psychic is used to hit physically defensive threats like Landorus-T and Fighting-types like Mega Lopunny. Shadow Ball targets other Psychic-types that would otherwise resist its attacks, such as Latios, Slowbro, and Mega Metagross. Focus Blast hits Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn while also hitting Dark-types like Weavile and Tyranitar. Hidden Power Ice can be used in the last slot to hit Ground-types like Gliscor for more damage. Alternatively, Calm Mind can be used to boost Mega Alakazam's Special Attack and Special Defense, allowing it to break through defensive cores and sweep through teams. If Calm Mind is paired with Recover instead of Shadow Ball, Mega Alakazam is able to stallbreak. Mega Alakazam can also stallbreak more easily if running Psyshock over Psychic, allowing you to beat other Calm Mind users and break through special walls like Chansey. Encore and Substitute are also options, with the former locking foes into moves and the latter helping Mega Alakazam avoid status while also circumventing priority moves like Bisharp's Sucker Punch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs allow Mega Alakazam to be as strong and fast as possible. A Timid nature is necessary to outspeed Pokemon like Mega Lopunny. Magic Guard is the chosen ability before Mega Evolution to help Alakazam avoid damage from entry hazards. After Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's ability turns into Trace, allowing it to copy abilities like Sand Rush from Excadrill, Regenerator from Tangrowth and Tornadus-T, and Flash Fire from Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Alakazam cannot consistently switch into attacks due to how frail it is. It likes coming in freely after a teammate has fainted, via a pivot move like Volt Switch or U-turn, or a double switch. Take advantage of Mega Alakazam's great Speed and use it as a revenge killer or late-game cleaner. Use Trace to copy abilities like Flash Fire to switch into Heatran's Magma Storm and Sand Rush from Excadrill to outspeed it even under sand. Use Mega Alakazam as a late-game sweeper by putting its checks and counters in range of its attacks or eliminating them. Make sure Pokemon that are faster than Mega Alakazam have been eliminated or have their Speed crippled by getting rid of their Choice Scarf or using Thunder Wave on them. Also, be aware of priority moves, like Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor and Mega Metagross, Ice Shard from Weavile, and Fake Out from Mega Medicham. Stay out of range of priority moves or eliminate the Pokemon that have them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Alakazam appreciates Spikes, as they can wear down its checks, making Pokemon like Skarmory and Ferrothorn good teammates. Ferrothorn is exceptionally good, as it can also offer Knock Off and Thunder Wave support. Heatran provides Stealth Rock while also checking things like Mega Scizor. Mega Scizor is one of the best answers to Mega Alakazam, making Magnezone a good partner to trap and eliminate it. Flying-types like Mega Pinsir and Talonflame have priority moves that can threaten Mega Alakazam, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T makes Mega Alakazam lose momentum. Pokemon like Rotom-W and Zapdos can soak up hits from the aforementioned Flying-types, while Serperior can lure them in and paralyze them with Glare. Gliscor and Clefable are also good partners, as they are good status absorbers. Clefable also has access to Knock Off, which can remove important items like Chansey's Eviolite. Serperior's access to Knock Off allows it to remove Tornadus-T's Assault Vest as well as Chansey's Eviolite. Choice Scarf Landorus-T not only is immune to Ground-type moves from faster Pokemon, like Sand Rush Excadrill and opposing Choice Scarf Landorus-T, but can also provide momentum through U-turn, giving Mega Alakazam a free switch-in. Garchomp can deal with physical attackers like Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Mega Scizor, which all threaten Mega Alakazam, while also providing Stealth Rock support.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Fire can be used to lure in and remove Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Taunt can also be used to stop status moves, entry hazards, and, most importantly, recovery. Recover is an option to give Mega Alakazam a form of recovery. Knock Off can be considered, as it helps with removing important items like Eviolite from Chansey and Assault Vest from Tornadus-T.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Priority: Because of Mega Alakazam's poor bulk, attacks like Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor and Mega Metagross, Fake Out from Mega Medicham, Aqua Jet from Crawdaunt, and Sucker Punch from Bisharp can do a lot of damage to or OHKO Mega Alakazam.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-types like Weavile, Bisharp, Crawdaunt, and Tyranitar can all threaten to OHKO Mega Alakazam. It does have Focus Blast to OHKO all these threats, but be wary of its accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Scizor is the best counter to Mega Alakazam, as it can always survive two hits from Mega Alakazam barring Hidden Power Fire. Mega Scizor is also hard to chip down thanks to Roost and can revenge kill Mega Alakazam with Bullet Punch or OHKO it with a Bug-type move like U-turn. Ferrothorn can take a Focus Blast and retaliate with Power Whip, but you can easily weaken it to where its in range of Focus Blast. Mega Metagross is able to take one Shadow Ball and revenge kill back, but it is easy to put in KO range.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey's special bulk makes it near impossible for Mega Alakazam to break through it. Chansey is also able to slowly wear down Mega Alakazam with Seismic Toss or cripple it with a status move like Thunder Wave or Toxic. However, Chansey can be defeated with the combination of Calm Mind and Recover to boost your Special Attack enough while also recovering off damage from Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Thunder Wave</strong>: Faster Pokemon, like Choice Scarf users and Sand Rush Excadrill can all outspeed and threaten Mega Alakazam due to how frail it is. There are ways to get around these fast threats, like removing their Choice Scarf with other teammates or copying Sand Rush from Excadrill. Thunder Wave cripples Mega Alakazam's Speed, making it less threatening and easy to KO.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Tentacruel's good defensive typing and stats allow it to check some of the largest threats in the OU metagame such as Azumarill, Keldeo, and Clefable. However, its main claim to fame is being a Rapid Spin user that can beat Mega Sableye. It also absorbs Toxic Spikes, which are very common in the current metagame. On the flip side, Tentacruel has some common weaknesses to Electric-, Psychic-, and Ground-type moves, which substantially hinder its defensive capabilities. Tentacruel also lacks any form of reliable recovery, making it easy to wear down. It also faces competition as a Water-type Rapid Spin user from Starmie, which has reliable recovery, a much better Speed tier, and more coverage options. However, Tentacruel differentiates itself with its better support options, lack of Pursuit weakness, and some unique resistances.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ice Beam hits Dragon-types, Gliscor, and Landorus-T for huge damage, but it is weak otherwise. Toxic cripples the bulky Water-types that tend to switch into Tentacruel. An offensive set with Hydro Pump, Hidden Power Fire, and Ice Beam or Sludge Bomb with Black Sludge can do significant amounts of damage on Tentacruel's usual counters and make good use of Tentacruel's Speed tier. A set consisting of Mirror Coat with Assault Vest can lure Pokemon such as Thundurus and Raikou. However, it is pretty bad otherwise. Haze allows Tentacruel punish Pokemon that try to set up. Substitute can be used to keep momentum and stall out Pokemon that have been already burned or poisoned.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Thundurus, Mega Manectric, and Raikou easily force Tentacruel out with their super effective STAB moves while gaining momentum with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types such as Latias, Latios, Slowbro, and Mega Slowbro can easily take out Tentacruel with their Psychic-type STAB moves. Slowbro and Mega Slowbro should be wary of Toxic, though.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Manaphy, Starmie, and Rotom-W fear nothing from Tentacruel aside from a Scald burn or the occasional Toxic and can either set up or threaten it with their secondary STAB attacks, respectively. And although Tentacruel takes little from Scald, it hates getting burned, as it has no reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Substitute Mega Gyarados, and SubCM Keldeo can easily set up on Tentacruel and potentially sweep its team.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Faster Pokemon with super effective attacks, such as Excadrill and Mamoswine, can easily force out Tentacruel.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald has a high chance to burn the target, which makes physical attackers reluctant to switch into Tentacruel. Rapid Spin is Tentacruel's main perk over other bulky Water-types and provides immense support to its team. Acid Spray lowers a target's Special Defense by two stages, allowing Tentacruel to beat Mega Sableye and use Rapid Spin, while also checking Calm Mind users. Toxic Spikes cripples opposing grounded Pokemon upon switching in, pressuring them with residual damage each turn. Knock Off provides huge utility and allows Tentacruel to beat Gengar faster. Haze is also an option as it allows Tentacruel to reliably check Belly Drum Azumarill by removing Azumarill's boosts. Protect can be used for scouting Choice-locked moves and gaining an extra turn of Black Sludge recovery, as well as getting an extra turn of Toxic damage on the opponent. Sludge Wave hits Fairy-types for super effective damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Both of Tentacruel's abilities are situational. Liquid Ooze is preferred, as it punishes the use of HP draining moves such as Leech Seed and Giga Drain. However, Rain Dish can be used on rain teams for semi-reliable recovery. Black Sludge provides passive recovery. The EV spread makes sure that Tentacruel avoids the 2HKO from Life Orb Gengar's Shadow Ball and Modest Mega Charizard Y's Fire Blast or Solar Beam after Stealth Rock 100% of the time, while still retaining a respectable physical bulk that allows it to check physical attackers such as Azumarill. 16 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Tentacruel to outspeed neutral-natured Mega Altaria and max Speed base 70s such as Breloom, Adamant Diggersby, and almost all versions of defensive Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tentacruel should be switched in on resisted attacks or on Pokemon that are checked by it such as Azumarill and Mega Altaria. Even though Tentacruel has respectable bulk, do not try to switch it into unresisted attacks, especially if you absolutely need entry hazards gone, as it is prone to getting worn down easily due to lack of recovery and constant switching into entry hazards. If an opponent has a Ghost-type, then it is preferable to not use Rapid Spin immediately. Before using Toxic Spikes, assess the opposing team. If it has too many Pokemon immune to them or a grounded Poison-type, it is preferable to not use Toxic Spikes at all. Also, use only one layer if your opponent is using an offensive team, as regular poison will result in more damage short-term.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tentacruel fits well on balance and stall teams. Mega Sableye has great synergy with Tentacruel, as it is immune to Psychic-type attacks and Tentacruel in return resists Fairy. Mega Sableye can also block Rapid Spin for Toxic Spikes set up by Tentacruel and also benefits from Toxic Spikes support when sweeping with its Calm Mind set. Grass-types such as Celebi and Ferrothorn have very good synergy with Tentacruel. Celebi also provides cleric support with Heal Bell. Wish users such as Chansey and Clefable are great teammates, as Tentacruel has no reliable recovery of its own. Gliscor has very good synergy with Tentacruel, as it can switch into Electric- and Ground-type attacks and Tentacruel can easily take Ice- and Water-type attacks aimed at Gliscor.</p> "

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>With excellent defensive stats alongside a solid Water / Psychic typing, Slowbro is an excellent choice for taking on threats such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Medicham. With recovery moves like Slack Off and Rest plus a fantastic ability in Regenerator, Slowbro is very easy to keep healthy and use as an all-around defensive pivot. Its very wide offensive and support movepool lets it take on various foes comfortably. When Mega Evolved, Slowbro gets a boost from base 110 Defense to base 180 Defense, which further increases its ability to take on physical attackers. Mega Slowbro also gets the ability Shell Armor, which makes it immune to critical hits; this pairs very well with its access to boosting moves like Calm Mind, which makes it a very viable bulky sweeper.</p> <p>Despite all this, Slowbro's typing renders it weak to common Knock Off and Pursuit users like Weavile, Bisharp, and Tyranitar. Its typing also makes it vulnerable to both U-turn and Volt Switch, making it very easy to gain momentum off of. Slowbro's mediocre Special Defense also makes it vulnerable to special attackers such as Mega Manectric, Serperior, and Gengar. Lastly, Slowbro fears status moves that can put it on a timer, like Toxic, and moves like Taunt that can stop it from recovering health or inflicting its own status.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>When not using the defensive set, Toxic is significantly less useful than Thunder Wave, as it cannot hit Mega Metagross, Ferrothorn, or Amoonguss and is less immediately crippling to offensive threats like Mega Pinsir. It is still viable, though, to wear down foes like Rotom-W, Zapdos, and other Slowbro or Mega Slowbro. Due to Slowbro's low Speed and fantastic defensive stats, it is a viable option as a Trick Room setter. Sleep Talk is viable on Rest Mega Slowbro so that it won't be idle for two turns and has a chance to use either Scald or Calm Mind.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types like Mega Venusaur, Tangrowth, and Serperior can soak up almost any of Slowbro's moves while dealing a lot of damage back. The majority of them, however, do not appreciate being hit by Ice Beam, burned by Scald, or paralyzed by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types, including Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Magnezone, can deal a large amount of damage to Slowbro. However, the majority of them do not appreciate switching into Scald too many times.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: If Slowbro lacks Ice Beam, Dragon-types like Latios and Mega Altaria can easily switch in and shrug off any damage, especially if they carry Roost. Latios can soak up almost any hit, recover the damage with Roost, and threaten Slowbro back with Draco Meteor. Mega Altaria full-on counters Slowbro, as it resists Scald and does not care about status if it carries Facade or Refresh. This lets Mega Altaria freely set up on Slowbro, needing only two Dragon Dances to outspeed it when paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Status: If Slowbro lacks Rest or a teammate that can clear status, Toxic poison and burn put it on a timer, forcing it to recover more often then it wants to as Toxic damage increases.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: When Mega Evolved, Slowbro relies on Slack Off and Rest to heal, meaning Taunt users like Gliscor and Heatran are able to stop Mega Slowbro from recovering or setting up Calm Mind. This makes it more vulnerable to Pokemon that it would normally switch into like Thunder Punch Mega Metagross and Mega Medicham. Taunt also prevents regular Slowbro from healing outside of Regenerator and spreading status through moves like Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks and Residual Damage: Dark-types like Tyranitar, Mega Tyranitar, Mega Gyarados, Hydreigon, Crawdaunt, and Weavile all threaten Slowbro. Ghost-types like Gengar and Jellicent can also prove to be problematic, as Shadow Ball from Gengar does a lot of damage, and Jellicent can absorb Scald and Taunt and potentially burn Slowbro with its own Scald. Bug-types, including Mega Heracross, Volcarona, and Mega Scizor, can deal a lot of damage to or outright KO Slowbro as well. A lot of Pokemon that Slowbro can typically check can also run a super effective coverage move to hit it, such as Thunder Punch from Mega Metagross, Hidden Power Bug or Grass from Choice Specs Keldeo, and Thunder Punch from Mega Medicham. A lot of moves mentioned here become less threatening when Slowbro is Mega Evolved, as Pokemon like Choice Band Weavile, Thunder Punch Mega Metagross, and Thunder Punch Mega Medicham cannot 2HKO it anymore. However, do keep in mind that Mega Slowbro loses Regenerator after Mega Evolving; this makes residual damage very troublesome, as it has to constantly stay at a high enough health percentage to avoid being 2HKOed as it switches into these Pokemon.</p> ",

Slack Off allows Slowbro to stay healthy and, when combined with Regenerator, makes it increasingly hard to wear down. Thunder Wave is a reliable method of stopping Speed-boosting Pokemon, such as Mega Charizard X, while also slowing foes down in general so that teammates can revenge kill them. Ice Beam reliably hits Ground-types like Garchomp and Gliscor while also hitting Dragon-types that resist Scald like Latios and Mega Altaria. Ice Beam also can hit Grass-types like Serperior, preventing it from using Substitute, and physically defensive Tangrowth, which otherwise could throw out moves like Sleep Powder, Knock Off, and Giga Drain. Fire Blast is also an option to immediately damage Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Magnezone, and Skarmory.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread allows Slowbro to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Keldeo's Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock while still maximizing its physical bulk to deal with Pokemon like Mega Medicham that lack Thunder Punch, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Metagross. Leftovers and Regenerator enhance Slowbro's ability to stay healthy. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet is also a solid item to chip down foes like Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Mega Metagross, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Medicham.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use this set as a defensive pivot. Slowbro can KO or cripple setup Pokemon like Swords Dance Gliscor and Swords Dance Mega Scizor with Ice Beam, Fire Blast, or Scald. Spam status-inflicting moves like Scald and Thunder Wave as the foe switches out to cripple its teammates. Rocky Helmet can be used to wear down physical attackers and put them in range of Slowbro's teammates. Make sure to scout for status moves from common status users like Clefable, Heatran, and Amoonguss to ensure Slowbro's survivability.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Slowbro fits well on bulkier playstyles like balance, bulky offense, and stall. It is able to act as the team's physical wall and its countermeasure to strong Fighting-types. Pokemon that can assist Slowbro with dealing with Electric-types like Rotom-W, Grass-types like Serperior, Ghost-types like Gengar, Dark-types like Tyranitar, and Dragon-types like Latios and Latias are mandatory. Magic Guard Clefable is a great partner because its mixed bulk and Fairy typing allow it to handle threats like Mega Gyarados, Latios, and Rotom-W. It also can absorb the status moves that Slowbro does not want to take. Tyranitar can eliminate Ghost-types, Latios, and Latias for Slowbro with Pursuit while also dealing with threats like Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Thundurus with Stone Edge. Choice Scarf Magnezone plays a similar role as Tyranitar in the sense that it can trap Pokemon that annoy Slowbro, such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, while also offensively checking Mega Medicham, Starmie, Thundurus, and Mega Charizard Y. It also provides momentum with Volt Switch. Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss can face off against the Grass- and Electric-types Slowbro struggles with, like Serperior and Rotom-W, while also appreciating Slowbro's ability to take on Fire-types. Other partners include special sponges like Tornadus-T and Gliscor; Tornadus-T forms a nice Regenerator core with Slowbro, while Gliscor is able to absorb and scout for status moves. Excadrill can check certain Electric-types as well as Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Altaria. It also can remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin, which Slowbro appreciates.</p> "

The rise in Special Attack goes well with Mega Slowbro's impressive base 130 Special Attack, giving it a solid offensive presence that complements its defenses. Scald is Mega Slowbro's best STAB move. Psyshock helps deal with other Calm Mind users like Clefable and Suicune while also hitting Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Keldeo. Rest is less reliable than Slack Off, but it removes status, most notably Toxic. Flamethrower is also an option, as it helps take out Mega Scizor and, more importantly, Ferrothorn, which otherwise hard walls Mega Slowbro.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With a 70 point boost in base Defense after Mega Evolving, Slowbro can throw more EVs into Special Defense while still acting as a reliable physical wall. When Mega-Evolved, Slowbro avoids the 2HKO from Knock Off from Dark-types like Bisharp and Weavile as well as Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Crunch. The Special Defense investment makes it easier to take on threats like Choice Specs Latios, and it lets Mega Slowbro use Slack Off on Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam to stall out its Drought turns.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>An important thing to keep in mind is how Slowbro loses Regenerator after Mega Evolving. Try to maximize the healing that Slowbro gets from it beforehand. You should not Mega Evolve Slowbro unless it needs the extra physical defense to check a specific threat or you plan to set up and win. Set up on Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Excadrill, Mega Metagross, and Keldeo that can't break Mega Slowbro. If you are not running Rest, make sure to scout for status moves like Toxic from Mega Lopunny and Excadrill while also being careful about potential coverage moves like Hidden Power Grass from Keldeo.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Slowbro belongs to bulky team archetypes like stall and balance, meaning Pokemon that naturally appear on these teams pair well with it. Gliscor can take on special hits for Mega Slowbro and is immune to Electric-type attacks that Mega Slowbro hates. Assault Vest Tornadus-T can also sponge special hits and forms a nice Regenerator core with Mega Slowbro. Clefable forms a fantastic Calm Mind core with Mega Slowbro, being able to absorb and scout out status moves like Will-O-Wisp and Toxic. Latios can fit on most teams, help Mega Slowbro deal with Electric-types, and remove entry hazards for it. Excadrill can also deal with Electric-types and remove entry hazards, but it also checks Fairy-types like Mega Altaria and Clefable that annoy Mega Slowbro.</p> "

This spread can also survive two hits of standard Rotom-W's Volt Switch.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Offensive tank Mega Slowbro usually wants to Mega Evolve right away to take advantage of the huge jump in Special Attack and, to a lesser extent, the jump in physical bulk. Mega Slowbro typically should be using Scald to land chip damage and potential burns on its foes, but it is also recommended to try to predict switch-ins and hit them with the appropriate coverage moves. For example, you would want to hit Latios on the switch with Ice Beam, Ferrothorn with Fire Blast, and Rotom-W with Psychic. This set is best used by tanking a lot of attacks while dishing out a lot of damage and healing when appropriate.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Offensive Tank Mega Slowbro fits best on balance and bulky offense builds. Pokemon that are able to deal with Electric- and Grass-types such as Mega Manectric, Thundurus, and Serperior are greatly appreciated. Teammates like specially defensive Heatran and Clefable work just fine. Good checks to Dark-types like Mega Gyarados and Tyranitar, such as Keldeo, are very helpful as well. Pokemon that can remove entry hazards like Latios and Excadrill help Mega Slowbro stay healthy and out of range of certain 2HKOs, like Choice Specs Keldeo's Hydro Pump. Additionally, both Latios and Excadrill help with the Electric-type issue, with Excadrill also being able to deal with Fairy-types like Mega Altaria and Clefable.</p> "

  "Magneton": {
    "overview": "<p>Magneton is mostly outclassed by its evolution, as Magnezone has superior offensive and defensive power, but Magneton's niche lies in its higher Speed, which allows it to outspeed Pokemon such as Weavile, Starmie, Tornadus-T, and Jolly Talonflame when equipped with a Choice Scarf. Magneton has a very good Special Attack stat that allows it to hit quite hard. It has a good ability in Magnet Pull, which allows Magneton to trap and beat Steel-types. It can use Volt Switch to help keep up momentum for teams. Magneton is immune to paralysis and poison, which allows it to absorb these sorts of status for teammates. It has a decent Electric / Steel typing, though it does have a 4x weakness to Ground-type attacks. Magneton has average defenses, but those are a bit let down by a mediocre HP stat. It has a small movepool with very limited options, which allows it to only fill out a single role effectively. Magneton is also easily beaten by specially defensive Pokemon, though it is capable of switching out against all Pokemon but Ground-types with Volt Switch. It is also rather item-reliant, as without its item, it will be too slow to outspeed several threats.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Analytic can be used for superior power, but that stops Magneton from being able to trap Steel-types, which means that it loses its niche. Sturdy is also a possibility to prevent Magneton from being OHKOed, but again, it cannot trap Steel-types. Eviolite is an option, but that'd waste Magneton's niche as a Choice Scarf trapper and its mediocre HP limits its effectiveness. Hidden Power Ice is another option that helps to hit Dragon-types better, but Hidden Power Fire is better in most situations because Magneton would struggle against Pokemon such as Scizor and Ferrothorn otherwise. Explosion is also an option that can bring in setup sweepers safely after use, though it lacks good power because of Magneton's poor base 60 Attack. Substitute can prevent Magneton from being revenge killed after it KOes a Steel-type, but it cannot really miss out on other attacks.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Swampert, are immune to Volt Switch and Thunderbolt and can OHKO Magneton with one of their STAB attacks, although the former two cannot reliably switch into Flash Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types such as Mega Manectric, Magnezone, and Thundurus-T are capable of tanking any hit, as they resist Magneton's Electric- and Steel-type STAB attacks, and can usually take a Hidden Power Fire and continue by beating Magneton or, in Thundurus-T's case, set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Specially defensive walls, such as Cresselia and Heatran, can take any of Magneton's attacks and set up on it. The latter is capable of straight KOing Magneton with a Fire-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Priority: As Magneton is a bit frail because of its low HP stat, super effective priority, such as Mach Punch from Conkeldurr and Breloom, can easily beat Magneton.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch allows Magneton to keep up momentum as well as switch out of Pokemon that threaten it, except against Ground-types. Thunderbolt has superior power to Volt Switch, which allows it to hit slightly harder. Flash Cannon is another good STAB attack that hits Ground-types which are immune to the former two attacks. Hidden Power Fire is really useful to hit Steel-types, most notably Ferrothorn and Scizor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf is the reason why to use Magneton over Magnezone, as it allows Magneton to outspeed Talonflame, Starmie, and Dragonite after a Dragon Dance as well as Speed tie Mega Gyarados after a Dragon Dance. Magnet Pull traps Steel-types, meaning Magneton can take care of them. Max Special Attack investment ensures that Magneton hits as hard as possible, and the max Speed investment along with a Timid nature help Magneton outspeed Pokemon with a base Speed of 115 or higher.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Volt Switch most of the time in order to gain momentum; however, you should play carefully with it; you cannot risk a Ground-type switching in and forcing you to switch in order to remain healthy. When a Steel-type is on the field, switch into Magneton in order to trap and eventually beat it. Don't switch in on an Excadrill or Heatran, because the former one can OHKO with Earthquake and the latter can take any hit and strike back with a Fire-type STAB attack. Magneton can also be used to clean up with Volt Switch once the foe has been brought down to low health.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Other U-turn users or Volt Switch users such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W make for good partners, as they'll be able to keep up the momentum for the team. Pokemon that beat up Ground-types, such as Azumarill and Venusaur, are really useful too, as Magneton has a hard time against Ground-types. Furthermore, Pokemon that take advantage of the fact that Magneton is capable of beating up Steel-types, such as Latios, Gyarados, Mega Altaria, and Mega Beedrill, and those that can clean up after are good partners too. And last, but not least, physical wallbreakers that get rid of special walls that hinder Magneton, such as Bisharp and Azumarill, also make for great partners.</p> "

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Astronomical HP and Special Defense, combined with the ability to use Eviolite, makes Chansey the ultimate wall in OU. Unlike that of its sister Blissey, Chansey's augmented physical bulk with Eviolite allows it to take powerful physical hits, making it a staple on defensively oriented teams. Wish and Natural Cure allow Chansey to heal its teammates and absorb status for them, while access to Seismic Toss and Toxic helps prevent it from being setup bait. Even with two ways of dealing damage, Chansey is still very passive, and because of this it is largely shut down by Taunt. Chansey's defensive typing is also rather poor for a wall, as Normal-types have no resistances and only an immunity to Ghost. Couple this with Eviolite Chansey's inability to hold Leftovers, and it is not all that difficult to wear it down. Chansey is also extremely reliant on Eviolite and loses much of its usefulness if hit by Knock Off or, less commonly, Trick. Nonetheless, Chansey is still one of the best walls in the OU metagame and is a must-use on any stall team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Counter can net a surprise KO against physical attackers, but Chansey doesn't typically have room for the move. It also requires great prediction to use properly. Healing Wish can be used to bring one of Chansey's teammates back to full health, but Chansey is already a good enough cleric with Wish or Heal Bell.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: There are plenty of them in the OU metagame. Keldeo, Terrakion, Mega Heracross, and Breloom are all Pokemon that hit Chansey for super effective damage on its weaker Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Due to Chansey's lack of Leftovers, wallbreakers wear her down easily. For example, Knock Off Landorus-T 2HKOes Chansey after Knocking Off its Eviolite, physically based Kyurem-B often 2HKOes Chansey with a Life Orb-boosted Dragon Claw, Mega Gardevoir can Taunt Chansey and 3HKO it with Psyshock, and Taunt Gengar walls Chansey completely.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Knock Off: As Chansey relies heavily on Eviolite to tank attacks, it loses much of its tanking ability if hit by a Knock Off from the likes of Weavile, Bisharp, and Tornadus-T.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Taunt: If Chansey is hit by Taunt from a Pokemon such as Gengar, Talonflame, or Gliscor, it will be unable to do much, and the opponent can subsequently use it as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Status Avoiding: Chansey cannot spread status to Pokemon behind a Substitute, so sweepers such as Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo can use the move to gain a free turn of setup. Furthermore, if the Pokemon has a maximum HP of 404 or higher, Seismic Toss will fail to break the Substitute in one hit. Similar to Substitute, Lum Berry provides Pokemon with protection from Chansey's attempts to status them. Dragonite, for example, enjoys Lum Berry to protect itself from a single Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Pokemon that do not mind Toxic or Thunder Wave, such as Swords Dance Gliscor, Calm Mind Clefable, Swords Dance Mega Scizor, and Swords Dance Bisharp, can all use Chansey as setup bait.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Toxic and Thunder Wave allow Chansey to cripple opposing offensive Pokemon with a status effect, thus cutting their sweeps short. Soft-Boiled gives Chansey easy recovery, prolonging its presence on the field. It is crucial to keep Chansey healthy with Soft-Boiled, because it lacks Leftovers. Seismic Toss gives Chansey some offensive presence and will break Substitutes if the foe has less than 404 HP. Heal Bell lets Chansey act as a cleric, while Stealth Rock can be used to punish opposing switch-ins, allowing Chansey's teammates to sweep more easily.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EVs maximize Chansey's physical and special bulk. Full investment in Special Defense maximizes Chansey's capabilities as a special wall, and a Bold nature is the best one to make Chansey as physically bulky as possible. Alternatively, you can use a spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD to truly maximize Chansey's physical bulk and to pass the largest Wishes possible to its teammates. Natural Cure grants Chansey an essential immunity to status problems, and Eviolite makes Chansey even bulkier, boosting its Defense and Special Defense by 1.5x.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Chansey's main jobs are tanking hits and spreading status. Lum Berry and Substitute are major problems for this set, as the foe can stop Chansey's attempt to give it a status ailment. Though Seismic Toss gives Chansey some offensive presence, it remains serious Taunt bait and will do little for the team if affected. Be cautious when trying to pass Wishes to teammates with low health, as the opponent can recognize this and send in a check or counter of their own. Moreover, because Roar and Whirlwind hit through Protect, Chansey can be phazed out when attempting to heal itself with Wish. If you are running Protect, use the move to scout users of Knock Off and Trick in order to preserve Chansey's Eviolite, as it is completely reliant on the item to tank hits well. Chansey is also very vulnerable to wallbreakers due to its lack of Leftovers. If you predict that a check or counter to Chansey is about to switch in, use Wish and go from there.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Chansey works very well on dedicated stall teams, so it should be paired with stall team staples such as Quagsire, Clefable, and, Skarmory. Entry hazard removal is necessary, as Taunt users will easily force Chansey out, and you will be switching Pokemon around a lot in order to keep passing Wishes, provided you are running Wish. Starmie, Skarmory, and Zapdos can remove entry hazards while providing defensive utility. As Chansey will force a lot of switches herself, an entry hazard setter makes for a good partner. Tentacruel can both set and remove entry hazards, making it a prime choice. A user of Taunt such as Gengar or Mega Gardevoir can help against Pokemon with Substitute and phazing moves. You also need teammates that Chansey can support; you can pair it with nearly any setup sweeper in order to keep said sweeper healthy. Setup Pokemon that it can support include Bisharp, Keldeo, and Mega Altaria. A Mega Evolution such as Mega Scizor or Mega Venusaur can take a Knock Off for Chansey in order to preserve its Eviolite.</p> "

  "Starmie": {
    "overview": "<p>Starmie has several valuable assets that allow it to function effectively in OU, whether it's playing an offensive or supportive role. Access to Rapid Spin, a great move with limited distribution, coupled with a solid defensive typing and reliable recovery allows Starmie to reliably remove entry hazards against many teams due to its ability to force many switches. Such a role is further cemented by its excellent Speed stat, which allows Starmie to outpace most of the unboosted metagame. Its wide offensive and defensive movepool means it can be catered to its team's needs easily while having a limited number of switch-ins due to its wide coverage options. Starmie also has two good abilities that it can put to use, with Natural Cure being a godsend on defensive sets, reducing Starmie's vulnerability to status ailments, and Analytic giving it the power to truly threaten some of its switch-ins.</p> <p>However, there are a few drawbacks to using Starmie, the chief of which is that while its typing is strong from a defensive standpoint, its actual bulk is little better than average, meaning it can struggle to take repeated punishment from common offensive Pokemon such as Keldeo, particularly if it is attempting to use Rapid Spin. A flaw to Starmie's otherwise strong typing is a Dark-type weakness, which means that Starmie is liable to being Pursuit trapped and removed from play. This can somewhat be remedied by Reflect Type, but this requires strong prediction and uses up a moveslot, thus reducing Starmie's available options.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>An offensive set consisting of Rapid Spin, Recover, and two coverage moves is a viable option, as it provides utility, longevity, and offensive presence, allowing Starmie to take on attackers more easily due to Recover and still dish out powerful attacks of its own. Signal Beam hits Psychic-types such as Celebi, Slowbro, and Latios and essentially compresses the roles of Ice Beam and Thunderbolt in the event that hitting Flying-types for super effective damage is unnecessary. Toxic could be considered for the defensive set, which allows Starmie to put its bulky switch-ins, such as Slowbro and Tangrowth, on a timer. Forgoing Reflect Type or Psyshock is usually not worth it, though. Gravity is an option for the Life Orb set; setting it up on a potential switch and then using much more accurate Hydro Pumps can be devastating for offensive teams. It is best used alongside threats with powerful Ground-type moves, such as Landorus-T, thanks to Gravity negating Ground immunities. Gravity also allows Starmie to potentially use more powerful but less accurate moves such as Blizzard and Thunder. Starmie can utilize Choice sets with Trick; with Choice Specs, it gains a great deal of power, while with Choice Scarf it becomes an extremely fast revenge killer, albeit very weak. Giving up utility moves in Rapid Spin and Recover can also be unappealing, however. Starmie can also utilize Trick alongside a status Orb, usually Flame Orb due to the reluctance of Fire-types to switch in on Starmie. This allows it to cripple an opposing threat by removing its item as well as inflicting a burn. As an added bonus, Natural Cure will remove the status condition should Starmie hold on to the Orb one turn too long.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey, Clefable, Jirachi, and Mew are capable of switching into Starmie due to their good Special Defense and access to reliable recovery moves, meaning they can outlast offensive Starmie if need be. Calm Mind Clefable is also notable in that it uses Starmie as setup bait, especially weaker defensive variants, and can cripple offensive variants with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Due to their resistance to Starmie's strongest STAB move, bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Manaphy, Slowking, Jellicent, and Mega Gyarados are good answers to it. In particular, Slowking and Mega Gyarados also resist or are immune to Psychic, meaning they can switch into Starmie even more easily and cripple it with Thunder Wave or OHKO it with Crunch, respectively. However, Thunderbolt does quite a bit of damage to them, and Gyarados is vulnerable to Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Bulky Grass-types such as Celebi, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth are good answers to Starmie due to their natural bulk and resistance to Hydro Pump. Both Celebi and Ferrothorn resist Psychic too and can KO Starmie back with their Grass-type STAB moves. Tangrowth, when equipped with an Assault Vest, is bulky enough to take repeated punishment from Psychic and Ice Beam and KO back with Leaf Storm or Knock Off. However, Ferrothorn fears a 2HKO from Hidden Power Fire, and an Analytic-boosted Ice Beam does quite a number against Tangrowth.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers: Pursuit trappers such as Scizor, Tyranitar, Weavile, and Bisharp can predict Starmie's switch and use Pursuit to trap and KO it. In particular, Bisharp can play mindgames with Starmie with Sucker Punch and Pursuit, and Weavile outspeeds Starmie entirely and can OHKO it with Knock Off. However, none of these Pokemon can switch in safely against Starmie for fear of getting OHKOed by Hydro Pump or crippled by Scald.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Even though they cannot switch directly into Starmie's Hydro Pump or Psychic, Electric-types such as Mega Manectric, Raikou, and Rotom-W are prime checks to Starmie. In particular, Mega Manectric outspeeds Starmie and OHKOes with Thunderbolt, while Raikou, if carrying an Assault Vest, can take any hit from Starmie and OHKO back with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon: Faster Pokemon such as Weavile, Mega Sceptile, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, Tornadus-T, Hawlucha, and Mega Lopunny can outspeed and KO Starmie due to its mediocre defenses.</p> ",

        "name": "Utility",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is an extremely spammable STAB move that threatens anything that wants to switch into Starmie with the chance of a burn, allowing it to wear down its bulkier switch-ins and cripple physical attackers entirely. Rapid Spin is what gives Starmie its niche as a support Pokemon, allowing it to remove entry hazards while preserving its own, which can be extremely useful for balanced teams that utilize multiple hazards in order to wear the foe down. Recover gives Starmie longevity, potentially allowing it to outlast the opponent's entry hazard setters and remove their entry hazards permanently. It also allows Starmie to take on threats such as Keldeo and Mega Metagross multiple times, fulfilling an important defensive role for its team. The last slot is fairly team dependent in that it is usually decided by what role Starmie needs to fulfill for its team. Psyshock allows Starmie to comfortably switch into and beat Calm Mind Keldeo, which it would lose to otherwise, meaning it can switch into any Keldeo lacking a super effective Hidden Power comfortably. It also has decent coverage alongside Scald, hitting Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur, Dragalge, and Gengar. Hitting Gengar is particularly important, as it prevents it from attempting to spinblock Starmie. Reflect Type makes Starmie more reliable as a spinner, allowing it to evade Pursuit attempts from the likes of Bisharp and Scizor and potentially burn them with Scald. It has excellent utility in allowing Starmie to take on other Pokemon it could not before such as Magnezone, Ferrothorn, and Mega Charizard Y by copying their typing and utilizing it defensively to beat them in a one-on-one situation, as it outspeeds all variants of Magnezone, can cripple Ferrothorn with Scald, and can stall out Charizard's sun. An assortment of alternative moves can be run in the final moveslot depending on the team's needs. Ice Beam destroys defensive Garchomp while also hitting Mega Altaria, Celebi, and Lum Berry Dragonite. Thunderbolt can be used for Water-types such as Slowbro, Suicune, and opposing Starmie. It also has the advantage of hitting Keldeo for decent damage. Thunder Wave is also viable, as it lets Starmie cripple its offensive checks such as Manaphy, Mega Charizard X, and Tornadus-T on the switch. Toxic is another option to fare better against Calm Mind users such as Slowbro and Keldeo and cripple bulkier Pokemon such as Quagsire.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EVs allow Starmie to outspeed everything up to base 115 Speed Pokemon, including fast threats such as Serperior and Thundurus, as well as beating out the crowded 108 and 110 Speed tiers and Speed tying with Raikou, Mega Houndoom, and opposing Starmie. It also crucially beats Choice Scarf Magnezone by one point, allowing it to use Reflect Type to gain a resistance to both of its STAB moves and prevent it from gaining any real momentum with Volt Switch or KOing Starmie. 252 HP EVs make Starmie as bulky as possible, and the final 4 EVs are invested into Special Attack so that Psyshock is guaranteed to OHKO Gengar. Leftovers grants passive recovery, which aids Starmie tremendously in keeping it healthy. A Timid nature is also necessary, as Starmie's high base Speed of 115 is one of its main selling points, being able to outspeed threats such as Gengar and Keldeo. Natural Cure helps to heal stray Toxic and paralysis upon switching out, which is is invaluable for making sure Starmie sticks around for as long as needed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Starmie's primary role is keeping your side of the field clear of entry hazards, so it should be switched in as often as possible on entry hazard setters it doesn't fear, such as defensive Heatran, to clear entry hazards as they switch out. It is crucial for this set to remain healthy, as Starmie's bulk is not spectacular, and switching in on too many entry hazards will quickly put it in range of being KOed before it has done its job. Staying healthy also allow Starmie to continuously switch into the threats it takes on, such as Mega Metagross, Keldeo, and Heatran. Use Recover against Pokemon that don't pose a threat to Starmie, such as Heatran and, if using Psyshock, Keldeo. If Reflect Type is chosen, Starmie can use the opportunity after neutralizing the foe with Reflect Type to heal off any damage via Recover. Against Pursuit trappers such as Bisharp and Tyranitar and against Pokemon that cannot hurt Starmie should it copy their typing, such as Ferrothorn and Magnezone, Starmie should use Reflect Type, if applicable, in order to use Rapid Spin or Recover safely. Against Starmie's checks, such as Serperior and Slowbro, using Scald to potentially cripple them on the switch is greatly encouraged. Any opportunity to wear down opposing entry hazard setters should be used to maximum effect, as the burden on Starmie and its team is greatly eased when entry hazards are removed and cannot be put back up again.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set is suited for balanced and defensive teams that utilize entry hazards to wear down the opposing team and, as such, would prefer a Rapid Spin user to a Defog user in order to maintain their own entry hazards. An excellent example of this would be a Spikes-stacking team, making Ferrothorn and Klefki strong partners. Fairy-types love Starmie's ability to switch into Mega Metagross and Heatran, so the likes of Mega Gardevoir, Togekiss, and Clefable fit well. In particular, Togekiss benefits from Starmie's Rapid Spin support and in turn deals with Grass-types, and Slowbro for Starmie. Mega Altaria lacking Earthquake also appreciates entry hazard removal and Starmie's ability to check Heatran. It goes without saying that Pokemon that appreciate entry hazards gone also benefit from Starmie's presence and can make for good teammates. Specially defensive Swords Dance Talonflame sets up on most Grass-types, and can wear down opposing teams with Will-O-Wisp, while Kyurem-B greatly appreciates entry hazards gone to increase its longevity and ability to wallbreak, especially with Life Orb recoil wearing it down as is. Defensive partners that can switch into the likes of Latios and Calm Mind Clefable, such as Ferrothorn and Heatran, are also strong partners to help Starmie out against its common switch-ins. Heatran is a great option in particular, as it can set up entry hazards of its own and Taunt these Pokemon to prevent them from using Defog. When running Psyshock over Reflect Type on Starmie, checks to potential Pursuit trappers, Knock Off users, and Dark-types in general are advised. Bulky Mega Scizor checks a great number of these while having decent synergy overall with Starmie, appreciating Starmie's ability to deal with Keldeo and Heatran.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rapid Spin removes the opponent's entry hazards while preserving your own and takes full advantage of the many switches that this set forces. While Rapid Spin is a great selling point for using Starmie, if you already have a means of removing entry hazards on your team, Recover is a great choice for increasing Starmie's longevity and mitigating Life Orb recoil. It is also a good choice on teams not so reliant on entry hazard control. Hydro Pump is a powerful STAB move that, when combined with a potential Analytic boost, hits many switch-ins such as Clefable for good damage. Psychic allows Starmie to defeat certain Pokemon that resist Hydro Pump, such as Rotom-W, Mega Venusaur, and Suicune. Thunderbolt is also an option in this slot to hit common bulky Water-types that like to switch into Starmie, such as Manaphy, Slowbro, and Empoleon. Ice Beam allows Starmie to hit Grass- and Dragon-types such as Celebi and Dragonite while giving great coverage alongside Hydro Pump. Hidden Power Fire hits Ferrothorn, a common Starmie switch-in, for super effective damage and prevents it from resetting entry hazards that Starmie has spun away. It also hits Scizor reliably if you don't want to risk Hydro Pump missing. Psyshock is a viable option over Psychic if hitting Chansey, Blissey, Calm Mind Keldeo, and Assault Vest users such as Conkeldurr, Tornadus-T, and Raikou is more beneficial. While the slashes above may seem to signal a three-attacks-and-utility-move moveset, all-out attacking Starmie is perfectly viable if the extra coverage is needed to hit as many Pokemon as possible. With such a set, Starmie becomes a very difficult Pokemon to switch into for most teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Starmie requires maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature to function effectively as an offensive Pokemon, as without it, Starmie loses out on outpacing many Pokemon such as Gengar, Thundurus, and Serperior, as well as Speed tying with Raikou, Mega Houndoom, and opposing Starmie. Maximum Special Attack investment in tandem with Life Orb gives Starmie a much-appreciated power boost, as its base 100 Special Attack can often be underwhelming. 29 HP IVs are used to minimize Life Orb recoil. Analytic may seem like a weird choice on a Pokemon as fast as Starmie, but Starmie really benefits from it due to the number of switches it forces, gaining KOs it wouldn't have achieved otherwise, such as with Hydro Pump on Clefable and with Psychic on Rotom-W. Natural Cure is another viable option, as the offensive teams Starmie fits on rely on Starmie to switch into the likes of Keldeo, Slowbro, and Heatran, and Natural Cure will let Starmie heal off potential burns received from switching into Scald and Lava Plume. Another perk is letting Starmie get rid of paralysis from Prankster Thunder Wave from Thundurus and Klefki.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Offensive Starmie is more suited to offensive teams that can provide it with safe switches via Volt Switch, U-turn, or double switches. If entry hazards are present, prioritize their removal, but if there are no entry hazards that need removing, using an attacking move is generally beneficial. This Starmie set is very hard to switch into for offensive teams in particular thanks to its Speed and coverage, so it should take every opportunity it gets to launch attacks against these teams, as it can quickly rack up a lot of damage. Against more balanced teams, aim to predict potential switch-ins and hit them hard with the appropriate coverage move, wearing them down throughout the course of the battle. If Recover is chosen, Starmie should use the move mostly on forced switches against the likes of Keldeo and Heatran due to its poor natural bulk and lack of investment.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to Rapid Spin, Starmie works best alongside Pokemon that appreciate Stealth Rock gone. The likes of Volcarona and Kyurem-B put huge offensive pressure on teams and massively appreciate not losing large amounts of health to entry hazards when they come in. Mega Charizard X not only appreciates Starmie's ability to keep entry hazards off the field, but also appreciates its ability to beat Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Landorus-T and potentially lure in Slowbro and KO it with Thunderbolt. In a similar vein, Mega Pinsir appreciates Starmie's ability to remove Stealth Rock, check the likes of Mega Diancie and Mega Metagross, and lure in Rotom-W and KO it with Psychic. With potentially no recovery and being susceptible to all entry hazards alongside Life Orb recoil, Starmie appreciates safe switches via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. Scizor in particular is a great partner for this, as it lures in a lot of Pokemon that Starmie can threaten such as Heatran. Another potential option is Mega Manectric, which can greatly threaten offensive teams thanks to its Speed and coverage, provide momentum with Volt Switch, and check threats such as Talonflame. Fighting-types such as Breloom, Conkeldurr, and Mega Lopunny are good partners, as they can deal with Dark-types such as Weavile, Tyranitar, and Bisharp, as well as Chansey and Blissey. In particular, Breloom can spread sleep via Spore and appreciates Starmie's ability to break past Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss.</p> "

  "Pinsir": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Pinsir is a powerful offensive threat with a high Attack stat that can be furthered by Swords Dance as well as Aerilate, which powers up its Normal-type moves and turns them into secondary STAB moves. Mega Pinsir's access to an Aerilate-boosted Quick Attack means that it is capable of outright OHKOing certain faster attackers, and with new additions to the metagame such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Sceptile, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Gallade, things have only gotten better for Mega Pinsir. Additionally, Mega Pinsir's decent bulk means that it doesn't find setting up too difficult. However, Pinsir is weak to Stealth Rock, especially after Mega Evolving, and it is shut down by burns and paralysis. Finally, a multitude of common threats, such as Talonflame, Rotom-W, Thundurus, Skarmory, Landorus-T, and Zapdos, are highly problematic for it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Double-Edge and Thrash can be chosen over Return by virtue of their higher Base Power, though their side effects (recoil damage and locking the user into the attack, respectively) are unappealing. Additionally, Double-Edge is illegal with both Quick Attack and Feint, and Mega Pinsir certainly does not wish to forgo priority. Stone Edge nails Zapdos, which can take any other moves from Pinsir and KO it with Thunderbolt. However, its coverage doesn't have any real uses outside of this. Substitute blocks status and protects Pinsir from being revenge killed, potentially stopping foes such as Rotom-W and Talonflame from halting a sweep. Earthquake can be used to OHKO Heatran and Mega Diancie without a boost as well as OHKO Mega Metagross at +2, but this is very situational, as Mega Diancie and Mega Metagross will rarely be hard switched into Mega Pinsir. Pinsir can attempt a Flail + Substitute strategy in a set, and should it reach 1 HP via use of Substitute, Mega Pinsir will have an impressive 200 Base Power Flying-type STAB move that is further boosted by Aerilate at its disposal. If Pinsir is partnered with Magnezone, Knock Off is an option, as it removes Shed Shells from Skarmory and Ferrothorn to allow Magnezone to trap them. Bulk Up is an alternative means of boosting, but Swords Dance is better, as Pinsir prefers the extra power to a Defense boost.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types resist Mega Pinsir's STAB moves, and faster ones, such as Thundurus, Mega Manectric, and Choice Scarf Magnezone, outspeed Mega Pinsir, can take a Quick Attack, and can OHKO it with a STAB attack. Thundurus resists Close Combat, is immune to Earthquake, and can directly KO Mega Pinsir with Thunderbolt or use Thunder Wave, which has priority thanks to Prankster, making it Pinsir vulnerable to being revenge killed. A boosted Close Combat only gets a 2HKO on Rotom-W, which can either burn Pinsir with Will-O-Wisp or hit it with Volt Switch in return, though Rotom-W should be cautious about switching in on Mold Breaker Pinsir. Finally, Zapdos's bulk and typing make it an excellent answer to Mega Pinsir; even after a Swords Dance, Return is only a 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers that are not KOed by Quick Attack: Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Terrakion, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar can safely survive a Quick Attack and proceed to OHKO Mega Pinsir with Stone Edge. Mega Metagross also fits this category; after taking a Quick Attack, it can OHKO Mega Pinsir with Meteor Mash or Ice Punch after Stealth Rock damage. Weather sweepers such as Excadrill and Kabutops deter Pinsir from setting up, as both outspeed Pinsir under the effects of sand and rain, respectively, and can potentially OHKO it. Finally, Mega Diancie fears nothing except Earthquake and can OHKO Mega Pinsir with Diamond Storm.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers: OU is chock-full of powerful priority attackers that can pick off Mega Pinsir. Talonflame's Brave Bird will always outprioritize Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack thanks to Gale Wings, and it OHKOes Mega Pinsir at full health. Other Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Azumarill, and Bisharp can survive a Quick Attack from Pinsir and KO it when it is weakened with their respective priority attacks. However, Bisharp must be wary of its Sucker Punch failing should Mega Pinsir use Swords Dance or Quick Attack.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Skarmory can phaze Mega Pinsir with Whirlwind after taking a boosted hit, making Mega Pinsir lose its boosts. Alternatively, if Mega Pinsir is sufficiently weakened, then Skarmory can KO it with Brave Bird. In a similar vein, Hippowdon can tank a hit and phaze Mega Pinsir with Whirlwind. Landorus-T has Intimidate to neuter Mega Pinsir and can OHKO it with Stone Edge after taking a hit, though Pinsir has Hyper Cutter on the turn it Mega Evolves, nullifying Intimidate and allowing it to boost to +2 Attack instead of +1, guaranteeing a clean OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Status: Pinsir despises being inflicted with a burn or paralysis from moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, respectively. When burned, Pinsir's damage output is cut, and when paralyzed, it is forced to rely on Quick Attack lest it be revenge killed. Thundurus and Sableye have +1 priority status-inducing moves at their disposal thanks to Prankster, making them threats to Mega Pinsir.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: The presence of Stealth Rock makes it difficult for Pinsir to set up and switch in and out of battle, especially after Mega Evolving.</p> ",

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance boosts Pinsir's Attack to frighteningly high levels, allowing it to tear through foes and do some late-game cleaning once its checks and counters are out of the way. Return becomes a mighty 199 Base Power Flying-type attack after Aerilate and STAB. Close Combat has great neutral coverage with Return, hitting Pokemon such as Heatran, Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Magnezone for super effective damage, and it inflicts neutral damage on targets such as Rotom-W. Quick Attack is an Aerilate-boosted priority attack that is surprisingly powerful; at +2, it OHKOes faster attackers such as Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Medicham. Feint can also be used in order to outprioritize Talonflame and OHKO it at +2 at the cost of being weaker overall; it also avoids contact damage, meaning that it can be useful for picking off very weakened Garchomp and Landorus-T, which commonly run Rocky Helmet.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Pinsirite enables Pinsir to Mega Evolve, allowing it to function as a fearsome late-game cleaner. Attack and Speed are maximized to give Pinsir the greatest possible chance of outspeeding and KOing its foes, and with a Jolly nature, Mega Pinsir outspeeds base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Charizard, Mega Gardevoir, and Mew. One can opt for an Adamant nature should they desire a greater damage output, though Pinsir is generally better off making the most of its Speed tier. Landorus-T, a common switch-in to Pinsir, has its Intimidate negated by Pinsir's Hyper Cutter. Pinsir also needs to keep its Attack from being lowered in order to OHKO defensive Landorus-T variants after a Swords Dance. Hyper Cutter in combination with Earthquake can also allow Pinsir to OHKO Mega Manectric if it tries to switch in the turn Pinsir Mega Evolves. Mold Breaker can be chosen as Pinsir's ability if you run Earthquake, as it allows Pinsir to strike Rotom-W for super effective damage on the switch in. Moxie is a possibility, as it enables Pinsir to nab an Attack boost should it pick off a weakened foe without Mega Evolving, though it isn't generally worth leaving Pinsir open to revenge killing with a middling base 85 Speed, and Pinsir should be doing its boosting via Swords Dance.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Pinsir should be sent out to clean up late-game once its teammates have sufficiently removed or weakened Pokemon that could prove to be threatening. Ideally, a teammate should have removed Stealth Rock from your side of the field before you bring Pinsir in. Mega Evolution can be delayed to take advantage of Pinsir's ability; for example, Hyper Cutter variants should delay Mega Evolving and use Swords Dance if you predict defensive Landorus-T to switch in, Mold Breaker variants should delay Mega Evolving and use Earthquake if you predict that Rotom-W will switch in, and Moxie variants should attempt to revenge kill a weakened foe to net an Attack boost in the process. Similarly, Pinsir's typing prior to Mega Evolution can come in handy. For example, Pinsir can survive a Stone Edge or Rock Slide from checks such as defensive Landorus-T and Choice Scarf Excadrill, respectively, which its Mega Evolution cannot do.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock eats a chunk out of Pinsir's HP when it switches in, and this amount of damage is even higher if switches in after having Mega Evolved. Therefore, Rapid Spin or Defog support is mandatory. Excadrill can spin away entry hazards and handle any Thundurus that is not running Focus Blast. Latias also makes for a good partner, as it can provide Defog support as well as give a weakened Mega Pinsir about to fall prey to Stealth Rock a second chance with Healing Wish. Other Flying-type attackers such as Staraptor and Talonflame can lure in Pinsir's checks and wear them down so that the latter can clean up and finish the job. Rotom-W and Landorus-T are good answers to the ubiquitous Talonflame, which would otherwise ruin Mega Pinsir's cleaning spree. As Skarmory is such a menace for Mega Pinsir, it is only natural that one should pair the latter with Magnezone in order to trap and eliminate it. Like any offensive Pokemon, Pinsir appreciates entry hazard support in order to net KOs with greater ease. For example, after Stealth Rock, Heatran is OHKOed by an unboosted Close Combat, and Slowbro is very likely to be OHKOed by a +2 Return. Landorus-T, Mamoswine, and Heatran are examples of Stealth Rock setters.</p> "

  "Gyarados": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Gyarados's access to Crunch in combination with its ferocious Attack stat and acceptable Speed stat makes it a considerably more threatening Dragon Dance sweeper that is capable of taking huge chunks out of opposing teams. Gyarados has phenomenal bulk for an offensive Pokemon and retains critical resistances and immunities in both its Mega and non-Mega formes. Its typing, combined with Intimidate, allows Gyarados to excel not only as an offensive sweeper but also as a supportive defensive wall, checking multiple threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. Gyarados also has decent coverage throughout its limited but helpful movepool, although it generally has a hard time fitting all it needs onto a single set. Furthermore, having Mold Breaker in its Mega forme allows Mega Gyarados to break through certain abilities, such as Unaware, Sturdy, Magic Bounce, and Water Absorb. However, both Gyarados's base forme and Mega forme are prone to residual damage, especially Stealth Rock, and its lack of reliable recovery means that this damage will be present throughout the battle. Gyarados's Speed, while not unsalvageable, is also quite mediocre in a metagame full of speedy offensive threats, meaning that even after a Dragon Dance, there will still be certain Pokemon that outspeed Gyarados.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A defensive set with support moves such as Roar and Thunder Wave can work, but this takes away from Gyarados's offensive potential. An offensive Dragon Dance set with three attacks and a Lum Berry is an option, trading bulk for stronger offensive presence. Natural Gift with a Liechi Berry provides a 100-Base Power Grass-type attack that deals massive damage to bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Azumarill, and Slowbro while also having the potential to raise Gyarados's Attack by one stage when Gyarados is at low health. Cheri Berry not only cures paralysis from Pokemon such as Thundurus and Klefki once but also gives Gyarados a powerful Fire-type attack for Steel-types such as Scizor and Ferrothorn. Stone Edge hits Kyurem-B and Zapdos considerably harder than any other move. Life Orb breaks down physical walls such as Skarmory much more effectively, although the lack of Lum Berry or Leftovers and the residual damage from Life Orb hurt Gyarados's longevity on the field.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-type Pokemon such as Breloom and Keldeo can revenge kill Gyarados, particularly when it has Mega Evolved, with their respective STAB attacks. Breloom can ignore potential Speed boosts and deal a hefty amount of damage with Mach Punch, while Gyarados needs prior damage to be able to KO them back.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types such as Mega Manectric, Raikou, and Thundurus can revenge kill an unboosted Gyarados, with the last being able to ignore any Speed boosts and potentially paralyze Gyarados with Prankster Thunder Wave, leaving Gyarados open to revenge killing.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Pokemon such as Skarmory, which has the potential to phaze Gyarados with Whirlwind or deal a massive amount of damage with Counter, Tangrowth, and bulky Garchomp all handle the majority of Gyarados's STAB attacks with relative ease.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Revenge killers such as Talonflame, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, Mega Alakazam, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mach Punch users all have the possibility to beat Gyarados even after a Dragon Dance boost.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions: Priority Thunder Wave from Klefki and Thundurus severely hinders Gyarados for the rest of the battle, while burn chips away at its health and halves its Attack.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to Gyarados's lack of recovery, forms of residual damage such as Stealth Rock, Spikes, Rocky Helmet, and Iron Barbs quickly wear it down. Ferrothorn in particular takes minimal damage from Gyarados's attacks and can wear it down very quickly with the combination of Leech Seed and Iron Barbs.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-type Pokemon, particularly Mega Altaria, which only fears Ice Fang, Unaware Clefable, and Azumarill, take both of Mega Gyarados's STAB attacks with relative ease, although they take a hefty chunk of damage from Bounce.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance boosts both Gyarados's Attack and Speed stats to formidable levels, allowing it to outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame bar Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Alakazam, even with a Jolly nature. Crunch is a powerful STAB move that deals immense damage after an Attack boost, as well as hitting bulky Psychic-type Pokemon such as Jirachi, Slowbro, and Latias. Waterfall is a strong secondary STAB attack that not only has a chance to make the foe flinch but also deals heavy damage to Fire-, Fairy-, and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Heatran, Clefable, and Mega Lopunny. Ice Fang is one of Gyarados's best coverage options, hitting bulky Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Breloom, Amoonguss, Mega Altaria, and Garchomp. Substitute sacrifices a slight amount of Gyarados's HP and not only allows it to avoid status ailments and Leech Seed from Pokemon such as Mew and Amoonguss but also makes it harder for foes to revenge kill it. Earthquake is an option over Waterfall or Substitute that targets Keldeo as well as Rotom-W thanks to Mold Breaker. Alternatively, Taunt is an option to prevent defensive Pokemon such as Mega Sableye, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn from using recovery, status-inducing moves, or Leech Seed. Keep in mind that these coverage moves are highly interchangeable and can be easily altered to benefit the team's specific needs.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment allows Mega Gyarados to hit astonishingly hard with its moves thanks to its massive Attack stat. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Mega Gyarados to outspeed Dragonite without a boost, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Manectric. Gyaradosite allows Gyarados to Mega Evolve, while Intimidate slightly softens up physical attacks before Gyarados Mega Evolves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Finding the appropriate time to Mega Evolve Gyarados is critical. Keeping Gyarados's Flying typing, as well as keeping Intimidate, allows it to check Pokemon such as Excadrill, Keldeo, and Breloom much more easily than Mega Gyarados can. The timing of setting up a Dragon Dance is relevant as well, as due to Gyarados's fantastic bulk, it easily sets up on a large amount of the metagame, including Hippowdon, Gliscor, Bisharp, Starmie lacking Thunderbolt, and Victini locked into V-create. However, Gyarados's checks and counters, such as Keldeo and Azumarill, first have to be substantially weakened or outright KOed, as Gyarados will fall victim to them if it attempts to set up at the incorrect time.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Healing Wish support from Pokemon such as Jirachi, Latias, and Celebi helps Gyarados due to how quickly it gets worn down from potential residual damage from Stealth Rock, Iron Barbs, and status conditions. Furthermore, entry hazard removal is also crucial, as taking 25% damage upon entry harshly cuts into Gyarados's longevity. Latias fulfills both roles, while Excadrill can pressure Klefki and Electric-type Pokemon. Dragalge can support Gyarados by setting up Toxic Spikes to quickly wear down Pokemon that Gyarados might have issues against, checking Chesnaught and Keldeo decently and severely damaging Ferrothorn with Hidden Power Fire. Azumarill checks Keldeo while also surprising Ferrothorn with Superpower, meaning Gyarados doesn't have to attack Ferrothorn as often and thus takes less residual damage from Iron Barbs. Kyurem-B pressures a considerable number of Gyarados's checks such as Skarmory, Rotom-W, and Tangrowth, safely lures in Ferrothorn and KOs it with Hidden Power Fire, and can cripple Clefable with Iron Head on the predicted switch.</p> "

        "name": "Bulky Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance raises Gyarados's already high Attack to immense levels while also increasing Gyarados's mediocre Speed stat. Bounce is a two-turn STAB attack that hits Fighting-, Bug-, and Grass-type Pokemon for super effective damage, gives Gyarados an extra turn of Leftovers recovery, and also has a chance to paralyze the opposing Pokemon. Waterfall is Gyarados's solid secondary STAB option, boasting decent power and hitting Rock-, Fire-, and Ground-type Pokemon while also forming a handy paraflinch combination with Bounce. Substitute sacrifices a slight amount of Gyarados's HP and allows it to bypass status conditions from the likes of Rotom-W, Mew, Gliscor, Heatran, and Amoonguss. In addition, Substitute allows Gyarados to avoid Leech Seed from Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur, preventing it from taking residual damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given HP and Defense EVs prevent Gyarados's Substitute from being broken by a burned Ferrothorn's Power Whip, allowing easier setup against it. The remaining EVs are implemented to maximize Gyarados's high Attack and Speed, allowing Gyarados to outspeed Mega Lopunny and Mega Manectric at +1 and KOing Choice Scarf Tyranitar at +1 Attack. Leftovers gives Gyarados important passive recovery each turn, slightly alleviating residual damage, especially from Stealth Rock, Rocky Helmet, and Iron Barbs. Intimidate allows Gyarados to lighten the damage taken from physical attacks, especially from Pokemon such as Excadrill, Talonflame, and Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The most appropriate time to set up Gyarados's Substitute is when anticipating an opposing Pokemon such as Mew, Clefable, or Mega Sableye to attempt to inflict status conditions onto Gyarados. Similarly, both Substitute and Dragon Dance are best used on Pokemon that Gyarados can comfortably force out with its dual STAB moves, including Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Jirachi, Excadrill, and Talonflame. Keep in mind that Bounce can give Gyarados an extra turn of Leftovers recovery if needed, potentially saving it from an attack that could KO it without the slight recovery.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard removal gives Gyarados much more accessible setup opportunities, as it will no longer lose a nasty 25% of its health upon switching into Stealth Rock. Thus, Gyarados appreciates Pokemon such as Excadrill, Latios, and Latias which can clear entry hazards using Rapid Spin or Defog. Starmie can not only use Rapid Spin but severely damages Rotom-W as well as lure in Ferrothorn and hits it with Hidden Power Fire so Gyarados will not be forced to take as much residual damage from Iron Barbs. Healing Wish support from Pokemon including Celebi, Latias, and Jirachi not only restores Gyarados's HP and cures its possible status conditions, but it also gives Gyarados a second chance to sweep teams thanks to full recovery. As a result of Gyarados's inability to break through specific defensive Pokemon, such as Unaware Clefable and, to a lesser extent, Quagsire, Pokemon that can pressure said Pokemon, such as Mega Venusaur and Power Herb + Solar Beam Heatran, are good teammates. Bulky Ground-types such as Excadrill, Hippowdon, and Garchomp share considerably strong type synergy, patching up Gyarados's weaknesses to Electric- and Rock-type attacks. Landorus-T also lures in bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Slowbro and cripples them with Explosion and the rare Toxic. Wallbreakers that can tear apart defensive cores that Gyarados might have issues with can support it before an attempted sweep; examples include Kyurem-B and Azumarill.</p> "

  "Ditto": {
    "overview": "<p>By virtue of its Hidden ability, Ditto makes for one of the greatest revenge killers in the game. This ability, Imposter, allows Ditto to instantly transform into the Pokemon it switches into, copying said Pokemon's moves, ability, and typing in addition to every stat except HP. This not only allows Ditto be an excellent revenge killer with a Choice Scarf, but also lets it scout movesets of unpredictable Pokemon. Ditto can also perform well on teams that have a weakness to setup sweepers because it naturally deters the opponent from setting up. Ditto also has the ability to copy an opponent's Mega Pokemon, potentially allowing the use of two Mega Pokemon on a team at once. Outside of these roles, Ditto can do very little, and as a result it is a very one-dimensional Pokemon. Additionally, Ditto's HP stat is pitifully low, something only made worse by its susceptibility to every damaging entry hazard. Ditto also struggles to perform effectively against more defensively inclined teams, making it hard to fit into a team slot.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ditto's other options are extremely limited because there are so few things that can be changed. However, one aspect of Ditto that one can alter is its Hidden Power type. Setting Ditto's IVs to 30 Atk / 30 SpA / 0 Spe achieves a Hidden Power type of Fire, and is an option that gives Ditto the ability to outspeed and finish off weakened Magnezone. While having a Choice Scarf is very important, one could potentially opt to use a Focus Sash Ditto instead. This would make Ditto be able to survive a hit from a Pokemon it copies, but faces the risk of being broken by entry hazards. In a similar vein, a Red Card could be used to switch into resisted hits of a sweeper and phaze it out. However, this, of course, is unreliable due to the possibility that Ditto will have to switch out and waste the boosts that it steals.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ditto has no real universal counters because what counters it will depend on what Pokemon it transforms into. However, Ditto does have some exploitable flaws:</p> <p><strong>Substitute: Due to Transform's mechanics, a Pokemon behind a Substitute or under the effect of the irrelevant Illusion will not be copyable with Imposter. This means any Pokemon equipped with a Substitute will be able to deny Ditto of the ability to transform.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind / Quiver Dance</strong>: Some Calm Mind and Quiver Dance sweepers are capable of beating Ditto in a one-on-one scenario, as they will be able to continue boosting or healing while Ditto will be locked into a move. For instance, a bulky Volcarona variant can continue boosting on Ditto, while Ditto will be locked into its Fire-type STAB.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: After Ditto has already transformed, many Pokemon are able to retaliate, but as already mentioned, which ones will almost always depend on what it has transformed into.</p> ",

        "name": "Imposter",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>There's little to address when talking about Ditto's moves; Transform is its only legal one. It is used on this set because it is impossible for a Pokemon to have no moves. Its only real use is preventing Ditto from using Struggle immediately if Imposter fails.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Choice Scarf is the only viable item on Ditto, as it ensures that Ditto can outspeed the setup sweepers that it transforms into. No other item can possibly replace the utility provided by a Choice Scarf. The HP stat should be invested into when using a Ditto as much as possible, as HP is the only stat that transfers over upon Imposter activation. Maximum investment in Defense decreases damage that Ditto takes from a Struggle war with another Ditto. A Relaxed nature is used to obtain the lowest Speed for the possible, albeit rare, Struggle war mentioned previously. Ditto also uses minimum Speed IVs for this reason and to give itself a Hidden Power type of Ice to revenge kill threats such as Thundurus.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As a revenge killer, Ditto is best brought out in response to a Pokemon fainting or from a teammate's successful U-turn or Volt Switch. It is best only to attempt to revenge kill with Ditto, because if it switches in as a Pokemon sets up, it won't get the stat boosts and is likely to lose the matchup. If one is using Ditto to revenge kill a Pokemon that has not revealed any status moves, it is worth considering if the opponent also has a Choice Scarf. If both Pokemon possess a Choice Scarf, the turn order is based on a coin flip and one might wind up losing their Ditto. Alternatively, you can also use Ditto to scout and check the movesets of opponents so that you know what to expect later in the game. This is particularly useful for Pokemon such as Jirachi, which can run a large variety of movesets. Ditto can also be used to copy an opposing Mega Pokemon that threatens itself and attempt to sweep the opponent, such as Mega Pinsir or Mega Lopunny. Good use of this ability can let you overwhelm your opponent with both a copied Mega Pokemon as well as your own. Ditto is a Pokemon that generally struggles against stall; in spite of this, if against a stall team, one can make use of Ditto to steal or eliminate the opponent's entry hazards.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Even though Ditto is generally a Pokemon that glues together a team rather than being built around, there are a few distinct Pokemon that it works well with. Primarily, due to Ditto's susceptibility to entry hazards, a Pokemon with Defog or Rapid Spin can be an excellent teammate. Starmie is a Pokemon that can spin away entry hazards, and in return, Ditto deters any Pokemon from using Starmie as setup fodder. Similarly, any grounded Poison-type is also useful for Toxic Spikes absorption. Examples of this include Tentacruel and Dragalge. For more offensive options, Scizor and Ditto can partner up to form a potent scouting and revenge killing core.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Omastar is one of the most solid Pokemon to use on rain teams because it can aid other sweepers, such as Kingdra and Kabutops. On top of that, its immediate power causes it to force the opposition either to sack a Pokemon or to have one of their walls take massive damage, and in most scenarios, Hydro Pump will easily 2HKO whatever Omastar is facing. Omastar also checks Talonflame and Mega Pinsir, giving it a niche unique to only itself and Kabutops. However, Omastar is outpaced by common Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Keldeo and is very reliant on rain to do its job. It also compounds rain teams' Thundurus weakness, meaning it has to be played carefully. Omastar also faces competition from Kabutops because of their similar typings, so having both on the same team is unfavorable in most scenarios.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Omastar does not have many other options. Hidden Power Grass can be used to beat Gastrodon, but losing Knock Off is huge. A Shell Smash set is possible, but priority users being able to pick it off and such a set's continued trouble with Ferrothorn and Thundurus makes it hard to consider. However, it completely destroys stall teams with some of its checks weakened. For instance, Chansey is 2HKOed after a boost while unable to do anything back except Toxic or Seismic Toss.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users: Omastar is quite slow, so faster Choice Scarf users, such as Garchomp, can outspeed it even under rain and KO it with a powerful attack.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls such as Chansey and Blissey, as well as tanks such as Assault Vest Goodra, can take Omastar's hits with relative ease and can either cripple or outright KO it, but they all must watch out for Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Omastar is weak to a few common priority attacks; Mach Punch from Conkeldurr or Technician Breloom will easily take it out.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Although Omastar has Ice Beam to handle most Grass-types, there are a few that it just can't deal with. Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn both take neutral damage from Ice-type attacks thanks to Thick Fat and its Steel typing, respectively. Both Pokemon also have 4x super effective STAB Grass-type moves to take Omastar down with ease; however, Ferrothorn can be worn down easily, and Mega Venusaur is 2HKOed by Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock, so be cautious. Though it is weak to Ice Beam, Amoonguss is also a good check to Omastar because of Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Omastar has a hard time dealing with opposing Water-types. Gyarados takes neutral damage from Ice Beam and Hidden Power Grass, and bulky variants of it essentially counter Omastar, especially those with Earthquake. Rotom-W is also a bulky Water-type that can take down Omastar with its STAB Electric-type moves. Empoleon and Assault Vest Azumarill are other good options, but all of these are soft counters because they can be worn down very easily and still take massive damage from Hydro Pump.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is Omastar's main STAB move when bulky walls such as Mega Venusaur are still in play, as it can 2HKO them after Stealth Rock damage. However, Scald remains Omastar's main choice against more offensive teams because it hits more than hard enough and can spread burns. Ice Beam is an obligatory coverage move, handy for hitting Grass-types. Knock Off hits the most common switch-in to Omastar, Chansey, for good damage and removes its Eviolite so that Omastar can 2HKO it later.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Modest nature, Choice Specs, and maximum Special Attack investment are required to let Omastar wallbreak and clean effectively. A Life Orb can be used to switch moves, but recoil damage makes Omastar lose a lot of power as well as its ability to check Talonflame well.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Omastar should be played recklessly by spamming Hydro Pump against stall teams and using Knock Off to remove Chansey's Eviolite and Azumarill's Assault Vest on the switch. Scald should be used to clean up weakened teams if Omastar is still alive late-game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Politoed is obviously a mandatory teammate to set up rain. Kingdra is an excellent partner for Omastar because they share checks and counters, most notably Ferrothorn, and can slowly break past them with their powerful Hydro Pumps, allowing one to sweep the remainder of the opposition. Defog Latios and Latias are great for removing entry hazards because Omastar will switch out a lot. Pokemon that can check Thundurus, such as Mega Manectric, Magnezone, and Raikou, are valuable teammates for Omastar. They can also safely use Thunder thanks to Politoed's rain. Mega Heracross can break past Omastar's soft counters, such as Mega Venusaur, Assault Vest Azumarill, Empoleon, and Amoonguss, making it a very good team option. Solid pivots such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W are also useful to allow Omastar to get onto the field safely. Healing Wish Jirachi and Latias are also excellent teammates because they allow Omastar a second chance to sweep.</p> "

  "Kabutops": {
    "overview": "<p>Kabutops is one of the best Pokemon on rain hyper offense, due to its ability, Swift Swim, and great Attack, which lets it 2HKO some of the best physical walls in the OU metagame after a Swords Dance. While Kabutops has a small movepool, it has everything it needs. The only Pokemon not covered by its STAB moves alone, Ferrothorn, loses to a Swords Dance-boosted Low Kick. Gastrodon and Chesnaught are 2HKOed by Low Kick on the switch as well. Another great trait about Kabutops is that it stops Talonflame on rain offense teams. However, despite all that Kabutops has going for it, it does have some flaws, including lackluster Special Defense and a mediocre defensive typing, meaning that its decent Defense stat rarely comes into play. Another glaring flaw is that outside of rain, Kabutops isn't an excellent Pokemon due to the huge drop in Speed. Nonetheless, Kabutops is an excellent sweeper to use on rain teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Kabutops can run a utility/support set consisting of Rapid Spin, Stealth Rock, Waterfall, and Stone Edge. However, Kabutops would rather use its offensive presence instead of being supportive to a team. Hone Claws could be used to boost its Attack by one stage rather than two, but boost the accuracy of Stone Edge as well. Knock Off is a nice utility move but it gains no additional coverage. Lastly, Kabutops can use a Lum Berry to escape the consequences of a burn or paralysis, which would halve its Attack or quarter its Speed, respectively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Weather Control</strong>: Any other weather, with the occasional exception of Sand due to the Special Defense boost, is bad for Kabutops. This removes the boost to Water-type moves and the Speed boost from Swift Swim.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur completely walls Kabutops as Kabutops can't OHKO it with a boosted Stone Edge and Mega Venusaur can OHKO with a STAB Grass-type attack. Chesnaught has high defenses, resists both of Kabutops's STAB types, and can OHKO it with Wood Hammer. Gourgeist has high enough Defense to take a Stone Edge and can burn Kabutops. Breloom also resists both of Kabutops's STAB types and can use Bullet Seed to OHKO. Ferrothorn can completely counter Kabutops if Kabutops does not have Low Kick.</p> <p><strong>Counter-types: Keldeo resists both of Kabutops's STAB types, isn't heavy enough to take considerable damage from Low Kick, and OHKOes with Secret Sword. Rotom-W can live an unboosted Stone Edge and can use Volt Switch or Will-O-Wisp to beat Kabutops. Thundurus can OHKO Kabutops and can live a single unboosted Aqua Jet. Lastly, Gastrodon resists both of Kabutops's STAB types and can 2HKO with Earth Power or burn Kabutops with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Prankster: Sableye can use Prankster Will-O-Wisp and then OHKO with Foul Play if Kabutops has used Swords Dance. Klefki can use Thunder Wave to take away the Speed boost from Rain.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gyarados: Gyarados can set up on an -1 Kabutops thanks to Intimidate and OHKO with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Terrakion: Terrakion can only check Kabutops if Kabutops does not have Aqua Jet or a Speed-boosting nature, but it can OHKO with Close Combat.</p> ",

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Waterfall is the primary STAB move, which is boosted under rain and is capable of OHKOing most offensive Pokemon. Stone Edge is the secondary STAB attack and has excellent coverage alongside Waterfall. Swords Dance allows Kabutops to boost its already good Attack, but Rapid Spin can also be used if necessary, providing utility at the cost of power. However, Swords Dance is preferred because a +2 Waterfall in the rain OHKOes Skarmory after Stealth Rock. Low Kick is an awesome move for dealing with Pokemon that resist Kabutops's STAB types, such as Ferrothorn, but Aqua Jet is good for revenge killing.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack and Speed EVs maximize Kabutops's offensive potential. Life Orb provides a significant power boost at the cost of some HP. An Adamant nature provides a power boost, as a Jolly nature only allows Kabutops to beat Choice Scarf Terrakion, which can be handled by Aqua Jet.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Kabutops is free to sweep when its counters or checks are taken out or weakened. If your Politoed must be sacrificed, be sure that you can bring Kabutops out straight after. Under normal circumstances, rain lasts just long enough for Kabutops to sweep, but only if brought out right after rain is set up. Kabutops functions even better as a sweeper after a boost from Swords Dance. The best times to use Swords Dance is when Kabutops can force out the opponent, such as when against Charizard Y, or when it can finish them off with an Aqua Jet, which is a situation where you can predict them to switch. If at any given time Kabutops needs to switch out to avoid being OHKOed, switch it out, even if it means losing the last turns of rain.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Politoed is one of the best Pokemon you could ever team Kabutops up with, and for one sole reason: Drizzle. Drizzle causes rain to start when Politoed switches in, and rain is necessary for Kabutops to function. Tornadus is also a great rain setter, as it has access to priority Rain Dance due to Prankster. Most Stealth Rock setters can work well with Kabutops, as it slowly weakens the opposing team and knocks certain Pokemon into KO range. Mega Scizor works well with Kabutops under rain due to the fact that Fire-type moves are weakened, and Mega Scizor has decent special bulk. Latios also works well with Kabutops, as it can beat many Pokemon that mess with its rain offense. Rotom-W is immune to Earthquake, which threatens Kabutops, and provides the utility of Volt Switch, as well as also getting a huge boost from the rain when using Hydro Pump. Lastly, Kingdra breaks many walls Kabutops has trouble with, and works well with Swift Swim as well, forming an offensive rain core.</p> "

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Aerodactyl has cemented itself as a terrifying offensive threat in the OU metagame for a variety of reasons. One of the most important aspects is its blistering Speed tier, outspeeding the majority of the metagame, including speedy threats such as Alakazam, Mega Manectric, Mega Lopunny, and Tornadus-T. Combine this with its decent Attack stat and its broad movepool, with the majority of its moves being further bolstered by Tough Claws, and Mega Aerodactyl is able to serve as an incredible revenge killer and late-game cleaner. Adding onto these positive traits, it is able to check a vast array of threats such as Tornadus-T, Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Mega Charizard X, and Volcarona as a result of its decent bulk and valuable defensive typing.</p> <p>Sadly, Mega Aerodactyl's weakness to the common Stealth Rock limits the number of times it is able to switch in if lacking Roost. Furthermore, even though its typing is decent, it has troublesome weaknesses to common priority moves in Aqua Jet, Ice Shard, and Bullet Punch. Mega Aerodactyl also has issues breaking through defensively-oriented teams, as the prevalence of bulky Garchomp, Slowbro, and Clefable can make its life miserable.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hone Claws gives Mega Aerodactyl the opportunity to boost its Attack and accuracy by one stage, mitigating Stone Edge's shaky accuracy. Tailwind raises Mega Aerodactyl's team's Speed for three turns, allowing slower teammates to outspeed threats they normally would not. Iron Head hits Fairy-type Pokemon such as Clefable, Sylveon, and Mega Altaria harder than Stone Edge thanks to the Tough Claws boost. A non-Mega set utilizing Focus Sash, Stealth Rock, and Double-Edge allows Aerodactyl to act as a fantastic suicide lead, as Double-Edge makes it KO itself after it is brought down to its Focus Sash, meaning that the foe cannot remove the hazards with Rapid Spin or Defog.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Rotom-W, Mega Swampert, Quagsire, Seismitoad, Alomomola, Suicune, and Azumarill take Aerial Ace and Stone Edge with ease and can retaliate with Scald or, in Azumarill's case, revenge kill with Aqua Jet. Slowbro is a particularly hard counter due to its immense physical bulk, reliable recovery in Slack Off, and ability to set up on Mega Aerodactyl with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types: Bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Garchomp, Gastrodon, and Landorus-T are good answers to Mega Aerodactyl, especially the latter two, with Garchomp being neutral to Aqua Tail and Landorus-T having Intimidate. Physically defensive variants of Hippowdon are capable of avoiding the 2HKO from Aqua Tail as well. Gastrodon avoids the 2HKO from Aerial Ace, has Storm Drain to prevent any damage from Aqua Tail, and can proceed to hit back hard with Scald. Defensive Garchomp is a good counter, too, as Rocky Helmet chips away at Mega Aerodactyl, meaning that even if it packs Ice Fang, Mega Aerodactyl's health will have been depleted somewhat anyway. In turn, these Ground-types can cripple Mega Aerodactyl with Toxic, phaze it with Dragon Tail in Garchomp's case, or KO it with Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Users of Bullet Punch, Aqua Jet, and Ice Shard such as Scizor, Azumarill, Weavile, Mega Medicham, and Mamoswine can easily pick off a weakened Mega Aerodactyl. Thundurus, Sableye, and Klefki can also cripple Mega Aerodactyl with Prankster Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp, respectively. However, none of these Pokemon can directly switch in for fear of Fire Fang, Stone Edge, and Aqua Tail.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Bulky Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Klefki, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Empoleon, and Skarmory can switch into Mega Aerodactyl and KO it back with their respective STAB moves or, in Klefki's and Empoleon's case, cripple it with Thunder Wave or Scald, respectively. Mega Aerodactyl's Fire Fang fails to 2HKO Empoleon, Mega Metagross, and physically defensive Skarmory, while Earthquake fails to 2HKO Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn and doesn't affect Skarmory; such variants also lose to Magnet Rise Klefki.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Mega Aerodactyl has difficulty breaking past certain Fairy-type Pokemon. Mega Altaria, particularly if it's a defensive variant, fears only the rare Ice Fang and can hit back hard with Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice or Return while healing off any damage it may have taken with Roost. Clefable can either set up Calm Mind on Mega Aerodactyl or cripple it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp, Keldeo, Landorus-T, and Latios can all outspeed Mega Aerodactyl and KO it with their respective coverage moves.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stone Edge is Mega Aerodactyl's hardest-hitting STAB attack, hitting most targets for phenomenal damage, even without the boost from Tough Claws. Aerial Ace targets Pokemon such as Keldeo, Tangrowth, Celebi, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Venusaur and, unlike Stone Edge, gets the power boost from Tough Claws. Aqua Tail provides solid coverage against bulky Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon, such as Gliscor, Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Excadrill, Mega Diancie, and Tyranitar, which might otherwise be able to tank Mega Aerodactyl's STAB attacks. Fire Fang roasts Steel-type Pokemon that resist Mega Aerodactyl's STAB types, such as Ferrothorn, Magnezone, Scizor, Jirachi, Skarmory, and Bisharp. Taunt is an alternative option that prevents defensively-oriented Pokemon such as Clefable, Heatran, Chansey, Mew, and Skarmory from setting up entry hazards, inflicting status conditions, and, most importantly, healing. Ice Fang demolishes Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, hitting them harder than Aqua Tail does. Earthquake hits Jirachi, Magnezone, Bisharp, and Mega Metagross harder than Fire Fang, while having the added benefit of 2HKOing Empoleon and Mega Manectric. It also targets Rock-types such as Mega Diancie, Terrakion, and Tyranitar. Roost can provide longevity against Talonflame, preventing Mega Aerodactyl from being worn down easily. Taunt can prevent common switch-ins such as Skarmory from setting up Stealth Rock and Spikes.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>By running a Jolly nature, Mega Aerodactyl is able to maintain its absurd Speed tier, allowing it to outpace the likes of Talonflame, Mega Lopunny, Mega Manectric, and Mega Beedrill. 252 Attack EVs allow Mega Aerodactyl to maximize its offensive potential, dealing heavy damage with its attacks. Unnerve is used before Mega Evolution, as it prevents the use of assorted Berries, such as Custap Berry on Skarmory and Sitrus Berry Hawlucha. However, Pressure can be useful for lead situations scouting for certain items. For example, against an opposing Landorus-T, you can find out whether it is equipped with Choice Scarf or Leftovers, as Pressure has identical priority with Intimidate.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Aerodactyl should primarily be used as a late-game sweeper or a revenge killer. It is able to revenge kill the likes of Mega Lopunny, Serperior, Talonflame, unboosted Mega Charizard X, and non-Choice Scarf Keldeo, provided that it can enter the battlefield via Volt Switch, U-turn, or a double switch. A sweep should only be attempted when all foes are in KO range of Mega Aerodactyl's attacks. Overestimating its power could be costly, though, as it isn't particularly powerful, especially considering that Stone Edge is not powered up by Tough Claws. Mega Aerodactyl can also be brought in early in the match to wear down its more passive checks, especially if it carries Taunt to prevent the likes of Clefable and Hippowdon from recovering health. Mega Aerodactyl can occasionally switch into certain Fire- and Flying-type attacks, such as Heatran's Fire Blast and Talonflame's Brave Bird. However, if lacking Roost, be wary of switching it into these attacks more than twice.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Magnezone is an ideal teammate, as it can trap and KO Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Jirachi and eliminate Water-types such as Rotom-W, Suicune, and Slowbro. This frees up Mega Aerodactyl's final moveslot, allowing it to run Taunt with less worry. Defog and Rapid Spin users such as Excadrill, Latias, Latios, and Starmie are able to remedy Mega Aerodactyl's Stealth Rock weakness, giving it more opportunities to switch in. Latias, Latios, and Starmie also wipe out Water- and Ground-types that give Mega Aerodactyl issues. Fighting-types such as Breloom, Terrakion, Toxicroak, and Conkeldurr appreciate Mega Aerodactyl's ability to remove Fire- and Flying-types. Grass-types can defeat bulky Water- and Ground-types that Mega Aerodactyl might struggle against. Serperior in particular annihilates bulkier teams that Mega Aerodactyl has issues breaking past, dealing with the likes of Rotom-W, Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Garchomp comfortably. In return, Mega Aerodactyl checks Pokemon like Talonflame, Volcarona, Tornadus-T, and Alakazam. Entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Dragalge, and Ferrothorn back up Mega Aerodactyl, by greatly wearing down its checks, giving it a better opportunity to sweep the opposing team. Dragalge can provide wallbreaking potential on top of Toxic Spikes, dealing with the likes of Slowbro, Rotom-W, Clefable, and Azumarill. Other wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B, Manaphy, Keldeo, and Azumarill are prime teammates, as they are able to break past bulky walls such as Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Clefable. Hidden Power Fire on Manaphy or Kyurem-B surprises Ferrothorn and Scizor, allowing Mega Aerodactyl to drop Fire Fang and run Taunt.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Pursuit Trapper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Pursuit gives Mega Aerodactyl the opportunity to trap a multitude of Pokemon that may attempt to switch out, such as Gengar, Latios, Latias, Starmie, Tornadus-T, Talonflame, and unboosted Mega Charizard X, allowing them to be revenge killed easier later in the match, hinder their sweeping capabilities, or outright KOing them. The combination of Aerial Ace and Aqua Tail have fantastic coverage together, threatening a large majority of the metagame. Stone Edge can be used if your team is particularly weak to Talonflame or Charizard, and lacking Stone Edge means that the likes of Tornadus-T and Thundurus do not fear staying in as much as they normally would. This results in Mega Aerodactyl not being able to properly Pursuit trap them, however. Fire Fang prevents Scizor and Ferrothorn from setting up Swords Dance or entry hazards on Mega Aerodactyl. However, the combination of Aerial Ace and Aqua Tail generally is more threatening towards offensive teams, making Aqua Tail the better option in most situations. Roost gives Mega Aerodactyl a reliable form of recovery, which is easy to take advantage of thanks to its typing and decent bulk.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>By using a Jolly nature and investing 216 EVs into Speed, Mega Aerodactyl is able to outpace everything up to Mega Beedrill and Mega Sceptile. 252 Speed EVs can be used to Speed tie with Mega Alakazam and opposing Mega Aerodactyl, although opposing Mega Alakazam will generally try to switch out, knowing that Psychic will not be able to OHKO, allowing Mega Aerodactyl to Pursuit trap it efficiently. 124 Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO on Serperior with Aerial Ace after Stealth Rock damage. The remaining EVs are placed into HP, giving Mega Aerodactyl extra bulk that works well in tandem with its good typing and reliable recovery. These EVs also guarantee that Mega Aerodactyl is able to survive a Life Orb Latios's Draco Meteor from full health, allowing it to 2HKO it with Pursuit 100% of the time after Life Orb recoil. A more EV offensive spread of 128 HP / 244 Atk / 136 Speed and a Jolly nature is viable as well; the 136 Speed EVs allow Mega Aerodactyl to outpace Mega Lopunny and Mega Manectric.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Aerodactyl is a phenomenal Pursuit trapper, with the added bonus of being a fantastic revenge killer, thanks to its great Speed and surprise factor. Many offensive Pokemon such as Gengar, Starmie, Latios, Latias, Celebi, and Alakazam will believe it is a safe option to switch out, thinking Mega Aerodactyl is being played as a revenge killer, only for them to take massive damage from an incoming Pursuit. Because of its good typing and decent bulk, Mega Aerodactyl has a massive advantage in being able to switch into and Pursuit trap a variety of Pokemon that would normally like to switch out, such as Tornadus-T, Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Thundurus lacking Thunder Wave. On top of Pursuit trapping, you can also use Mega Aerodactyl as a decently powerful revenge killer, being able to defeat Pokemon such as Keldeo, Serperior, and Mega Lopunny, and Mega Aerodactyl will still pose a threat to offensive teams thanks to its blistering Speed tier even with the loss of coverage moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can lure in and remove opposing Steel-types, such as Hidden Power Fire Manaphy and Watmel Berry Azumarill, can help break down Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Mega Scizor, allowing Mega Aerodactyl to switch in more easily. Magnezone can trap and defeat many of Mega Aerodactyl's checks, such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Together, the two form a dual trapping core. Entry hazard removal is a necessity, as losing 25% of its HP upon each switch into Stealth Rock greatly hampers Mega Aerodactyl's longevity. Latios and Latias are particularly exceptional entry hazard removers, as they are able to switch in and defeat most bulky Water-types. Starmie is a valuable Rapid Spin user, thanks to its ability to lure in the likes of Rotom-W, Suicune, and Slowbro and defeat them each with Psychic and Thunderbolt. It also beats Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp. Rotom-W can gain momentum via Volt Switch and switch into bulky Garchomp without many issues. Amoonguss shares fantastic type synergy with Mega Aerodactyl, being able to threaten Rock-, Water-, and Ground-types, and it can also put foes to sleep with Spore. Pokemon that appreciate Mega Aerodactyl's Pursuit support include Serperior, Keldeo, Kyurem-B, Manaphy, Volcarona, and Alakazam, as the move substantially weakens faster threats. These Pokemon also plow through certain bulkier Pokemon such as Slowbro, Garchomp, and Hippowdon that Mega Aerodactyl struggles against, and Keldeo in particular is able to defeat Weavile and Scizor without much worry. Heatran takes on Latios and Latias and can lure in bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Azumarill and proceed to KO them with Power Herb Solar Beam. Both Tyranitar and Hippowdon are able to provide sand for Mega Aerodactyl, boosting its Special Defense substantially, although you must be wary of the overlapping weaknesses. Only defensive Tyranitar should be used alongside it, as Choice Scarf or Choice Band sets overlap with Mega Aerodactyl's role of Pursuit trapping. Defensive variants are able to set up Stealth Rock and are able to lure in Garchomp and Landorus-T and hit them hard with Ice Beam.</p> "

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<p>Zapdos is a great defensive check to several threats thanks to a few traits. The first is reliable recovery in the form of Roost, allowing it to stay healthy throughout the match, unlike many other Electric-types. The second is its solid bulk, which, coupled with a good defensive typing, allows Zapdos to check some of the tier's most dangerous threats, such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Scizor, and Tornadus-T. The third is its ability to pressure offensive teams with the combination of its decent power, rather good coverage, and Roost stalling. Finally, Zapdos has access to Defog and the ability to beat Bisharp, something no other Defogger can do besides Mandibuzz. Unfortunately, Zapdos is held back by a Stealth Rock weakness, which is an especially large issue for a Defog user, and does not have the sheer bulk that some other defensive Pokemon possess. Furthermore, the Thundurus formes, both of which boast much more useful offensive abilities and Nasty Plot to help muscle through walls, outclass Zapdos offensively. When using Zapdos, be mindful of its limitations and play to its strengths, and it will be very effective.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Zapdos has several other options for sets. SubToxic can be pretty effective on Zapdos, but it has issues with common Steel-types and is difficult to fit with the number of options that Zapdos wants to fit in. Roar is a good move for racking up entry hazard damage and phazing out boosting sweepers. Discharge is another STAB option with a nice chance to paralyze, but it lacks the power of Thunderbolt; for example, it can't OHKO Mega Pinsir.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is Zapdos's best STAB option, packing respectable power thanks to its base 125 Special Attack. Roost helps keep Zapdos alive and mitigates its weakness to Stealth Rock. Defog gives Zapdos the excellent utility of keeping entry hazards off of the field. However, for teams already running a spinner, Hidden Power Ice can be run to hit Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, all of which are Pokemon that it wants to check. Heat Wave is the best option in the last slot to hit Steel-types like Scizor, Bisharp, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn very hard, although Toxic can also be effective as a method of wearing down common switch-ins like Mega Altaria, Landorus-T, and Tyranitar while allowing Zapdos to check Mega Slowbro.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EVs and Bold nature are designed to maximize Zapdos's physical bulk while outspeeding Adamant Bisharp. The 68 Special Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO on Mega Pinsir with Thunderbolt, a Pokemon that Zapdos is meant to counter. Leftovers is the best item by far to improve Zapdos's longevity.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try not to switch Zapdos into Stealth Rock too much without using Roost in between, as keeping it from being worn down by entry hazards is worth the loss of some momentum. When Stealth Rock is on the field, don't use Zapdos to handle things that will probably just U-turn out like Scizor; Zapdos will get worn down quickly if you do. Instead, save Zapdos for your opponent's sweepers that you can't handle otherwise, such as Azumarill and Mega Pinsir. Try to keep Zapdos away from status because it hurts its longevity, especially Toxic. In general, try to keep Stealth Rock off the field as much as possible.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Physical Fighting-types are good teammates for Zapdos, as they can scare away or set up on Tyranitar and Chansey, two Pokemon that like to switch in on Zapdos. Mega Gallade, Mega Lopunny, and Terrakion are particularly good choices. Cleric support from the likes of Clefable, Mega Altaria, and Chansey is also nice to alleviate Zapdos's status woes. Wish support from them can also help Zapdos switch into Stealth Rock and powerful attacks without being forced to Roost, and Zapdos can take Steel- and Fighting-type attacks for them. In turn, they can switch into Pokemon such as Latios that beat Zapdos. Many Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Mega Charizard X can set up on Zapdos, so having a physically defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon to handle them is very helpful. Latios is a major issue for Zapdos, especially Calm Mind variants, so Pokemon such as Clefable, Tyranitar, and Heatran make for solid teammates.</p> "

Volt Switch, while significantly weaker, is useful to gain switch initiative and momentum, although it isn't effective if Stealth Rock is on the field, as it forces Zapdos to incur damage from the hazard for a second time. Roost keeps Zapdos healthy to take on opposing threats repeatedly. Hidden Power Ice is for Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Defog is generally preferred in the last slot to remove Stealth Rock and other entry hazards, although if you already have a form of hazard removal, Heat Wave is a solid option to hit Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Scizor, Bisharp, and Excadrill.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EVs maximize Zapdos's special bulk, allowing it to check powerful special threats, such as Keldeo and Gengar, as well as survive a +2 Return from Mega Pinsir after Stealth Rock damage and one round of Leftovers recovery while outpacing Adamant Bisharp. Leftovers is crucial to survive +2 Return from Mega Pinsir after Stealth Rock damage and increases Zapdos's overall longevity.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is a huge issue for Zapdos, so make sure to use Defog before switching out. If Stealth Rock is up, don't use Zapdos to take on Pokemon such as Scizor that will most likely just U-turn out, because it just wears Zapdos down. In general, try to keep Zapdos at decent health so that it can take on the likes of Mega Pinsir.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Having a cleric Pokemon such as Clefable or Chansey is fantastic for removing crippling status from Zapdos. Good physical walls like Hippowdon and Gliscor that handle powerful physical setup sweepers, such as Swords Dance Excadrill and Mega Charizard X, support Zapdos, as Zapdos is setup fodder for them. Finally, a Pokemon to handle Mega Altaria, such as Clefable, bulky Talonflame, Mega Venusaur, or Jirachi, is crucial.</p> "

  "Dragonite": {
    "overview": "<p>Dragonite's stats, movepool, and ability make it a big threat in OU. Dragonite's great overall stats, most notably its high Attack stat, allow it to wallbreak and majorly dent teams. Dragonite also has access to Dragon Dance, and it is one of the best users of the move in the entire tier. Dragonite's wide movepool provides it with many coverage options, ranging from the elemental punches to Superpower, as well as Outrage for a powerful STAB move. A move that stands out, however, is Extreme Speed. Extreme Speed's +2 priority allows Dragonite to revenge kill prominent sweepers in the tier as well as outprioritize priority users such as Talonflame. Dragonite's ability, Multiscale, is also one of its selling points. Multiscale halves the damage Dragonite takes at full health, allowing it to safely set up Dragon Dance or revenge kill Pokemon that would otherwise OHKO it, such as Latios and Latias. It also helps it repeatedly set up on more passive teams when combined with Roost. However, Dragonite does have multiple flaws. Fairy-types such as Clefable and Azumarill make it harder to use Outrage throughout the match, as they can easily switch into and OHKO Dragonite with their STAB moves. Dragonite's over-reliance on Multiscale sometimes can make it difficult to set up or hit safely, as Multiscale can easily be broken through various methods such as weather damage and Rocky Helmet. Dragonite's weakness to Stealth Rock is also pretty major, as it breaks Multiscale and slices off a quarter of Dragonite's health. Dragonite's mediocre Speed also makes non-Dragon Dance sets harder to use, as an unboosted Dragonite will usually be outsped by threats such as Thundurus and Garchomp.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragonite has many options it can work with, given its good movepool. Iron Head and Iron Tail can both effectively beat Fairy-types such as Mega Altaria and Clefable. A bulky Substitute + Dragon Dance set with Roost and Dragon Claw does leave Dragonite walled by Fairy-types but it can demolish defensive cores that rely on status moves to beat Dragonite. A bulky Roost set can be used as a buffer towards a few attackers, while not being completely passive. Dragonite has a huge special movepool with moves such as Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, and Draco Meteor, but Dragonite's mediocre base 100 Special Attack stat limits its effectiveness, and a specially offensive set is outclassed by Latios, Latias, and even Goodra. A parashuffler set can paralyze multiple foes, but Electric-types are now immune to paralysis, limiting its effectiveness. A mixed Life Orb set has a good surprise factor, and it can break down defensive cores more easily.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Almost any Fairy-type can easily take care of Dragonite. Azumarill and physically defensive Sylveon aren't threatened much by Dragon Dance and bulky Dragonite, though the former should be wary of Thunder Punch from the Choice Band set. Physically defensive Clefable is a great answer to any variant of Dragonite, bar ones with a Steel-type coverage move. Unaware variants of Clefable can also stop a boosted Dragonite with ease.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Attacks: Despite Multiscale, Dragonite can not stand up to most Ice-type attacks. Kyurem-B and Mamoswine can easily OHKO Dragonite with their Ice-type STAB moves. Pokemon that carry Ice-type coverage, such as Manaphy, also pose a threat.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Physically defensive Pokemon with reliable recovery, such as Hippowdon, Skarmory, Gliscor, and Quagsire, can all tank hits from Dragonite and stall it out, though Dragonite can cover Skarmory with either Thunder Punch or Fire Punch. Choice Band variants of Dragonite, however, aren't as threatened by these Pokemon due to the fact that it can severely dent all of these.</p> <p><strong>Broken Multiscale: One of Dragonite's key points is Multiscale, and without it, Dragonite isn't as shielded from attacks. Stealth Rock poses the biggest threat to Dragonite, as not only does it break Multiscale, it also chips a full quarter of Dragonite's health off. Sandstorm damage from Tyranitar or Hippowdon can also easily break Multiscale. Pokemon that negate Multiscale, such as Mega Gyarados and Kyurem-B, can easily OHKO Dragonite with Ice Fang and Ice Beam, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killing: Priority and Choice Scarf users are both major problems for Dragonite. Ice Shard Mamoswine and Weavile, as well as Brave Bird Talonflame, can all pick off a weakened Dragonite. Revenge killers such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Terrakion can finish off Dragonite with their Rock-type coverage attacks. This forces Dragonite to use Extreme Speed, which will usually not OHKO them.</p> <p><strong>Status: Outside of sets that use Lum Berry, any form of status will easily cripple Dragonite. Burns from bulky walls such as Rotom-W can prevent Dragonite from doing major damage, while Thundurus can use Thunder Wave to cripple Dragonite from outspeeding common threats.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Fly Nite",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance allows Dragonite to boost its Attack and Speed, letting it sweep teams and outpace relevant threats. The Speed boost grants Dragonite the ability to stall out would-be threats such as Latios and Choice Scarf Landorus-T with the combination of Substitute, Roost, and Multiscale. Substitute allows Dragonite to avoid status conditions. Roost allows Dragonite to heal itself and regain Multiscale. Fly is picked over other attacks, such as Dragon Claw, mostly due to the fact that no Pokemon are immune to it. Fly is also beneficial since it allows Dragonite to gain more recovery from Leftovers and to preserve PP from Substitute and Roost.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers is selected for consistent passive recovery. Multiscale is vastly superior to Inner Focus because Dragonite will regain it multiple times throughout the battle thanks to Roost. The specified HP and Defense EVs allow Dragonite to survive the combination of a Fake Out and an Ice Punch from Mega Lopunny, which would otherwise outspeed and KO it after a Dragon Dance. The remaining EVs are placed into Speed, which allows Dragonite to outspeed Tornadus-T after a Dragon Dance when used in tandem with a Jolly nature.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Dragonite is almost entirely a late-game sweeper; it should be played cautiously. Although some matchups may seem very difficult for Dragonite, it has the potential to sweep almost any team, and in most games it should be treated as the primary wincon. Removing specific counters or weakening them is crucial for allowing Dragonite a chance to sweep. While Dragonite will primarily not be attacking until the time is right, you must be cautious of being lured into using Fly; the opponent can potentially switch to something that can KO or status Dragonite as it attempts to Fly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Magnezone is almost a necessity with this set. While most Steel-types will lose to this set in a one-on-one matchup, some, such as Skarmory and Mega Scizor, will always beat this Dragonite set and have to be completely removed to allow Dragonite a chance to sweep, which is where Magnezone comes in. Magneton is also acceptable, but generally inferior to Magnezone. Entry hazard removal is also a necessity with Dragonite, as not only does Stealth Rock break its Multiscale, but it also is weak to Stealth Rock and the damage taken from it could be detrimental towards a sweep. Starmie and Latios are optimal partners, as they provide your team with hazard removal and a primary Water-type switch-in, easing Dragonite's time. Zapdos is also a possible teammate, as it provides a team not only with Defog, but also with a reliable answer to Tornadus-T, which can potentially trouble Dragonite as Hurricane will hit mid-Fly. Dragonite will also greatly struggle with stall and defensively oriented teams; therefore, having good breakers will be very crucial towards teambuilding with Dragonite. Togekiss, Gengar, Stored Power Clefable, and maximum Attack Mega Diancie are all solid teammates that help with defensively oriented teams.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance is the main move on the set, boosting Dragonite's Attack and Speed and setting it up for a sweep. Outrage is a STAB attack that will usually OHKO most opposing Pokemon that don't resist it after a Dragon Dance. Extreme Speed is a +2 priority move that is used to outprioritize other priority users, most notably Talonflame. It also hits Choice Scarf users that would otherwise revenge kill Dragonite. Earthquake hits Heatran, Bisharp, Mega Metagross, Mega Diancie and Tyranitar, which tank Dragonite's other moves with ease. Fire Punch is also an option to hit Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Air Balloon Excadrill, but these Pokemon can all be trapped with Magnezone and are on the whole easier to deal with than the major threats that Earthquake hits, so it is generally inferior. Dragonite has quite a few other options that it can use on this set. Thunder Punch can be used to hit Azumarill and Togekiss harder than a neutral Fire Punch. Roost can be used to fix a broken Multiscale and heal off any damage taken, but Dragonite loses important coverage, which is usually more of a downside. Dragon Claw can be run over Outrage for more consistency and to avoid the risk of a Fairy-type switching in and walling Dragonite for a few turns, but the power drop is very noticeable.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature allows Dragonite to hit extremely hard. Maximum Speed investment is necessary to outspeed Pokemon such as Latias and Latios when Dragonite is at +1. Lum Berry is the best item for Dragonite, as it prevents Dragonite from being crippled from status users such as Thundurus and Mew as well as curing the confusion from Outrage. Lum Berry is used over a Life Orb because the recoil from Life Orb breaks Multiscale. Multiscale allows Dragonite to set up Dragon Dance more easily.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Dragonite should be used as a cleaner or as a mid- or late-game sweeper, when Dragonite's checks and counters are weakened or gone. Setting up early-game tends to be bad because priority can easily wear Dragonite down and bulkier Pokemon can easily Toxic stall Dragonite until it is susceptible enough to priority. Dragonite should never be sent in when Stealth Rock is up, as it breaks Multiscale and takes a decent portion of Dragonite's health away. Dragonite can easily set up on Pokemon that rely on status, such as Chansey, as Lum Berry will easily remedy any status. That being said, Dragonite should stay away from Knock Off users, as Lum Berry is very important to ensure that Dragonite can safely set up. Multiscale should not be relied on to tank Ice-type attacks, as almost any strong Ice-type attack will easily OHKO Dragonite, even with Multiscale.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard removal support is vital so that Dragonite performs effectively. Excadrill stands out for this role as it has amazing defensive synergy with Dragonite and can easily take care of Fairy-types as well as spin away hazards. Latias can use Defog to get rid of hazards and provides Healing Wish support as well. Magnezone forms the DragMag core and gets rid of opposing Fairy- and Ice-types. Magnezone can also lure in Ground-type moves that Dragonite is immune to, and Magnezone can keep up momentum by using Volt Switch. Wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B and Mega Charizard Y can weaken opponents so that Dragonite can clean more easily. As a bonus, Mega Charizard Y sets sun, negating Tyranitar's and Hippowdon's sand. Dual screens support makes setting up easier. Klefki in particular has dual screens as well as Spikes and Prankster. Clefable can negate Will-O-Wisp with Magic Guard and provide Wish support, as well as set up Stealth Rock.</p> "

Dragon Claw is an option over Outrage for more consistency and to stop the risk of opposing Fairy-types switching in. However, the power drop is very noticeable, as most OHKOs that Dragonite can achieve with Outrage will turn into 2HKOs. Extreme Speed is a +2 priority attack that provides the priceless utility of not only killing off weakened sweepers that have set up but also revenge killing priority users such as Talonflame. Fire Punch is used to hit Steel-types, such as Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Skarmory, Mega Metagross, Bisharp, and Mega Scizor. Earthquake rounds out the set, providing invaluable coverage on Heatran and Tyranitar while being Dragonite's best option against Azumarill and hitting Mega Metagross, Excadrill, and Bisharp even harder than Fire Punch. Thunder Punch + Superpower can be run over Fire Punch + Earthquake, providing pretty much the exact same coverage with the added bonus of a move to smack Azumarill with. However, this combination of moves misses out on Mega Scizor and Mega Metagross, making it an inferior option on the whole.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack EVs maximize Dragonite's offensive potential, allowing it to hit extremely hard. 252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature maximize Dragonite's Speed and allow it to outspeed neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon and Jolly Mega Heracross. An Adamant nature, however, is typically preferred to increase Dragonite's damage output, which is especially relevant when revenge killing foes with Extreme Speed. A Choice Band is the item of choice to considerably increase Dragonite's damage output. Multiscale is to ensure that Dragonite can safely get off a hit without risking being KOed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Dragonite should abuse its power to wallbreak early-game and weaken opposing Pokemon to the point where sweepers on your team can easily finish them off. However, mid- or late-game, Dragonite best uses this set to do damage and switch out as a hit-and-run attacker. Dragonite can also act as a revenge killer by using Extreme Speed to finish off weakened opponents. This variant of Dragonite should usually switch out when there is an opposing check sent in, as Dragonite will retain its power, unlike Dragon Dance Dragonite. Preserving Multiscale should still be kept in mind, but it does not tends to be as much of a priority as it is for other Dragonite sets. Due to the fact that Outrage locks Dragonite in for two to three turns, it should only be used late-game to clean up opponents, as using it early-game makes Dragonite a setup fodder.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Dragonite tends to switch out very often, and Stealth Rock breaks Multiscale as well as taking a quarter of Dragonite's health away, so Rapid Spin and Defog support is needed. Excadrill has great defensive synergy with Dragonite, making it a good choice for a Rapid Spinner. Latios and Latias provide great Defog support, as they are quick and can also weaken opposing threats. Latias not only provides Defog support but also can use Healing Wish to allow Dragonite to recover health. Magnezone is a great partner as it forms a DragMag core with Dragonite, punishes Fairy-types, and has amazing defensive synergy. Bisharp is also a good partner, as it can also punish Fairy-types with Iron Head and Pursuit trap Latios and Latias. Entry hazard support from Mamoswine or Tyranitar is also great, as it weakens the opponent and increases the chance of Dragonite scoring a KO. Sweepers that can make great use of Dragonite's wallbreaking skills are extremely great partners. Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Gyarados appreciate having bulkier Pokemon such as Azumarill and Landorus-T weakened. Clefable absorbs Will-O-Wisp and can provide Wish support as well as set up Stealth Rock.</p> "

  "Mew": {
    "overview": "<p>Mew is an extremely versatile Pokemon because it can learn every TM and HM in the game. Furthermore, Mew is the only Defogger in the metagame with access to Will-O-Wisp and no Stealth Rock weakness, which lets it cripple Defiant users such as Bisharp by halving their Attack. Overall, Mew has good offensive and defensive stats but is not really that outstanding when compared to bulkier Psychic-types such as Mega Slowbro, regular Slowbro, and Cresselia. Mew has a pretty good Speed stat as well, which lets it outspeed slower Pokemon and attack them. Mew also has access to a form of reliable recovery in Soft-Boiled, which contributes to Mew's longevity on the field. Synchronize is a useful ability for Mew, because it can punish status users if they inflict status on Mew. It can also provide utility against Scald burns. However, Mew's typing is subpar, which leaves it very vulnerable to common Bug-, Ghost-, and Dark-types, such as Scizor, Gengar, and Mega Gyarados. Mew also has four-moveslot syndrome because it cannot benefit from all move options it learns. Despite Mew's incredibly huge movepool, it only has a few viable sets that aren't outclassed by other Pokemon in the tier.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>An offensive set can be used to take advantage of Mew's huge coverage movepool, but Mew has low offensive stats compared to other Psychic-types such as Latios, which makes it unfit for this role. A lead set along the lines of Taunt, Stealth Rock, Tailwind, and Explosion is an option but is better done by Azelf because of its better Speed and offenses. A Choice set with Trick can be used to prevent setup while delivering some offensive presence, but most targets from Trick are crippled by Taunt and Mew's offensive presence is somewhat lacking compared to other Psychic-types such as Latios. Earth Power can KO Heatran, which Mew lures in, but has no other specific targets and thus isn't worth a main slash. Seismic Toss and Night Shade can be used, as they hit foes for consistent damage and hit Mega Pokemon harder, but Knock Off generally provides more utility. Thunder Wave is a utility move that cripples a lot of offensive Pokemon, as it lowers their Speed greatly, but Mew lacks the moveslot for it. Colbur Berry lets Mew take less damage from Knock Off and Pursuit, among other Dark-type moves, but the extra recovery of Leftovers is usually preferred. Transform is a final option that lets Mew transform into the opposing Pokemon and take an attack better by changing its typing, but this doesn't always work and takes up an important turn.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers: Pursuit trappers, such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Weavile, can trap Mew and OHKO it with Pursuit. The latter outspeeds it, but they all hate to get burned. Additionally, Bisharp can switch into a Defog to boost its Attack by two stages because of Defiant.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Heatran, Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Talonflame are immune to burns and can beat Mew with their STAB attacks. Heatran's Fire-type attacks get a boost if it switches into Will-O-Wisp thanks to Flash Fire.</p> <p><strong>Status: Toxic wears down Mew turn after turn and burn steadily takes off damage as well. However, the users must be wary of Synchronize because they may cripple themselves by inflicting the status.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Bug-types such as Mega Scizor and Mega Beedrill can OHKO Mew with one of their STAB attacks after Stealth Rock damage. Both are crippled by burns, however.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-types such as Bisharp, Weavile, and Tyranitar, can all take Mew's hits. All of them hate Will-O-Wisp, however.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers such as Keldeo, Serperior, Dragalge, and Mega Charizard Y don't really get hampered by burns and can easily KO Mew with their STAB attacks.

Soft-Boiled provides reliable recovery for Mew, healing 50% of its health. Will-O-Wisp is another utility move which burns physical attackers and cripples them by halving their Attack. Knock Off prevents Mew from Struggling if it has been Taunted and additionally removes the foe's item. Psychic can be used in the fourth slot for a more powerful attack than Knock Off, as it is boosted by STAB and hits Pokemon such as Keldeo and Mega Lopunny for super effective damage, as well as Pokemon such as Clefable and Mega Venusaur, which is important, as they're two Pokemon Mew is supposed to beat. But, Ice Beam can also be used in the fourth slot to beat specially defensive Gliscor along with Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Synchronize statuses the opposing Pokemon if it statuses Mew, except if the foe is immune to that status. Leftovers provides passive recovery for Mew, boosting its longevity. The Speed investment lets Mew outspeed Jolly Tyranitar and Adamant Bisharp and burn them before they can KO it. The HP EVs boost Mew's overall bulk while the Special Defense EVs raise Mew's Special Defense stat, which is boosted even further by a Careful or Calm nature. Use a Careful nature if running Knock Off, but use a Calm nature if running Psychic to reduce damage taken from Foul Play. A secondary spread of 252 HP / 224 Def / 32 Spe can be used, as it lets Mew take on physical attackers better and avoid the 2HKO from Mega Lopunny's Return after Stealth Rock damage. A third spread of 252 HP / 148 SpD / 108 Spe is another option to outspeed Jolly Bisharp and Adamant Dragonite, but, with this spread, Mew has far less bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mew is best used on teams that struggle against stall, as it can come in on defensive Pokemon and use Taunt. Mew can spread burns against offensive physically oriented teams early-game and provide setup opportunities for teammates. Mew can be used as a tank, as it has good overall bulk. Try to avoid letting Mew get statused, unless your team has cleric support. The activation of Synchronize isn't worth acquiring a status affliction. Make sure to keep Mew as healthy as possible, as a defensive Pokemon may hit it on the switch and knock Mew out if it is at low HP. If you're unsure what to do, go for Knock Off, as most Pokemon will not appreciate having their item removed. When facing a foe with Pursuit, the best thing to do is go for Will-O-Wisp, as all common Pursuit users are physical attackers.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Special attackers such as Mega Diancie and Mega Charizard Y appreciate Mew beating specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Ferrothorn one-on-one, and thus, they make for good partners. Setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Scizor, and Azumarill take advantage of Mew weakening physical attackers with burns, as they can use this to set up. Cleric support from Pokemon such as Chansey and Clefable is appreciated to cure Mew from status. However, the former should only be used on defensive teams. Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Mega Lopunny are great partners for their ability to beat all Pursuit users themselves, and they have good synergy with Mew, as they resist Bug and Dark while Mew can switch into Psychic-type attacks for them. Other status absorbers such as Conkeldurr and Heatran are also good choices. The former can also beat common Pursuit users for Mew and has relatively good synergy with it.</p> "

Soft-Boiled heals 50% of Mew's HP and helps Mew stay healthy. Will-O-Wisp hampers physical attackers by burning them and also wears them down slowly by inflicting some damage at the end of each turn. Taunt can be used in the third slot because it cripples defensive Pokemon by forcing them to attack, and it also prevents foes from setting up. Psychic prevents Mew from being Taunt bait and has good power with decent coverage against Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur. On this set, Psychic is a superior option to Knock Off, as this set does not include the combination of Taunt and Will-O-Wisp and therefore values the extra power more. Knock Off is another option in the fourth slot for its ability to remove items from foes. Landorus-T and specially defensive Gliscor are punished by Ice Beam, which has decent power and good coverage and thus is a usable option. Stealth Rock is another option to use in a slot, as it damages foes each time they switch in, but is somewhat counterproductive with Defog, which removes it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Synchronize spreads status to foes that inflict status on Mew, as long as they are not immune to that status. Leftovers provides some passive recovery for Mew. The HP and Special Defense investment gives a boost to Mew's bulk and lets it avoid the 2HKO from Latios's Draco Meteor, and a Careful nature gives another boost to Mew's Special Defense. The Speed EVs let Mew outspeed and burn Pokemon such as maximum Speed Tyranitar and Adamant Bisharp. A Calm nature should be used alongside Psychic, while a Careful nature should only be used if Mew is running Knock Off. A spread of 252 HP / 148 SpD / 108 Spe can be used to outspeed maximum Speed Jolly Bisharp as well as maximum Speed Jolly Breloom, but running it causes Mew to lose out on some bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set fits best on balanced or bulky offense teams but doesn't fit on teams using entry hazards at all, as it functions as an entry hazard remover. Mew can switch into defensive Pokemon that set up entry hazards, Taunt them, and continue with Defogging the entry hazards away. Will-O-Wisp is Mew's primary option against physical attackers unless one of its teammates desperately needs its Defog support. Be careful with Defog if there is a Bisharp with Defiant on the opposing team - it can easily come in, get an Attack boost, and Pursuit trap Mew after. Mew can be used to tank opposing attacks from foes, as it has good overall bulk and can recover back any damage taken.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock that appreciate Mew's Defog support, such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Pinsir, and Talonflame, make for good partners. Setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X, Scizor, and Dragonite can use burned foes as a setup opportunity for themselves. Pokemon such as Raikou that struggle against defensive Pokemon are good choices because Mew can stallbreak for them. Cleric support from Clefable or Celebi is very nice because status will eventually wear Mew down. Fighting-types, such as Keldeo, Infernape, and Conkeldurr, are excellent partners for their ability to beat common Pursuit users. This set struggles against Fire-types, so teammates that can beat them one-on-one, such as Tyranitar and Gyarados, are good partners. If running Stealth Rock, offensive Pokemon that take advantage of Stealth Rock to KO foes with more ease are good teammates.</p> "

  "Azumarill": {
    "overview": "<p>Azumarill is a potent threat in the OU metagame thanks to its fantastic traits such as typing, bulk, power, and movepool. Its Water / Fairy typing gives it key resistances and immunities to Fire-, Fighting-, Water-, Dark-, and Dragon-type moves, which, when combined with its solid bulk, allows it to sponge many hits and gain free turns. Additionally, its ability, Huge Power, turns its terrible Attack stat into the equivalent of a base 150 Attack stat, ensuring that it's no pushover offensively. It also has a great movepool to complement that. Access to priority in Aqua Jet, powerful STAB moves in Play Rough and Waterfall, and coverage in Knock Off and Superpower ensures that it will always have the right move for the job. These traits allow it to effectively run a Choice Band set, a Belly Drum Set, and an Assault Vest set, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. However, Azumarill has a very low Speed stat, which often forces it to take a hit before attacking, and it is walled by Steel-types unless it's running Superpower, which lowers its Attack and Defense after every use. Additionally, common Electric- and Grass-types, such as Raikou, Thundurus, and Mega Venusaur, are able to check Azumarill, meaning it struggles to do much before these Pokemon are sufficiently weakened.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Azumarill can fit on stall teams if it runs a defensive set with Sap Sipper. However, it lacks reliable recovery and has very little offensive presence without Huge Power, but can act as a solid answer to Serperior, Ferrothorn, and non-Rain Dance Manaphy. Additionally, Facade can be run on the Choice Band set so Azumarill can still function while burned. Natural Gift with a Watmel Berry gives a 100-Base Power Fire-type attack which targets the likes of Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. A Custap Berry can be used to let Azumarill move first when it is below 25% HP. This can be useful in situations versus offensive Pokemon if they are not in range of being KOed by Aqua Jet. Running Double-Edge alongside a Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment on the Belly Drum set allows Azumarill to outspeed and OHKO Mega Venusaur, a common stop to Belly Drum sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Poison-types: Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Tentacruel resist both of Azumarill's STAB moves and take very little from its coverage moves. Additionally, they are able to hit Azumarill super effectively with their STAB attacks. However, both Amoonguss and Tentacruel can potentially lose to the Belly Drum set if weakened enough, although Mega Venusaur doesn't have this problem, outside of rare Jolly variants with Double-Edge.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Ferrothorn, Magnezone, Skarmory, bulky Mega Scizor, and Mega Metagross are all able to check or counter Azumarill reliably, as they all resist Play Rough. Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor all take little from Waterfall and can use Azumarill as setup bait and set up Spikes, or Swords Dance in the latter's case. Mega Metagross and Magnezone threaten to OHKO with their STAB attacks after minimal prior damage, and they also have the bulk to take an Aqua Jet. Note that Magnezone and Ferrothorn must be wary of Superpower, with the latter only needing some prior damage to be OHKOed by Choice Band Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Volcanion: Volcanion is capable of switching into any Azumarill variant at least once, can easily revenge kill Belly Drum sets, and deters Azumarill from using Aqua Jet to clean late-game. It then proceeds to OHKO Azumarill with Sludge Wave or threatens to burn it with Steam Eruption, Scald, or Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Mega Scizor, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Quagsire, Slowbro, Mega Slowbro, Mega Venusaur, Mew, Clefable, and Rotom-W all check or counter Azumarill reliably thanks to their great physical bulk. Mega Scizor is able to set up Swords Dances on non-Choice Band variants and Roost off any damage it may take. Ferrothorn and Skarmory can set up entry hazards, and in the latter's case, Leech Seed. Slowbro, Mega Slowbro, and Quagsire can Recover stall non-Choice Band variants and burn them with Scald. Rotom-W can burn Azumarill with Will-O-Wisp, or Volt Switch out to maintain momentum. Mew and Cresselia are able to stomach a Knock Off and can cripple Azumarill with Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, respectively. Finally, physically defensive Clefable is able to counter Azumarill depending on its set. Unaware Clefable counters both the Assault Vest and Belly Drum sets, while Magic Guard Clefable can only take on the Assault Vest set.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Play Rough and Waterfall are Azumarill's main STAB moves, and hit incredibly hard thanks to Choice Band. Aqua Jet allows Azumarill to revenge kill weakened threats and sweep late-game should the opportunity arise. The final slot is dependent on what the team needs. Superpower is useful for luring in Ferrothorn for a 2HKO while also hitting other Steel-types such as Magnezone and Skarmory after it uses Roost. However, Knock Off can be used instead for coverage against bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro and Mew while also having utility in removing items.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread allows Azumarill to outpace uninvested base 60 Speed Pokemon, such as Clefable and Sylveon. If outspeeding support Tyranitar is appealing, then 92 Speed EVs should be used. 164 Speed EVs can be used to outpace uninvested base 70 Speed Pokemon, which includes bulky Bisharp and Skarmory. The Attack EVs should be maximized in every instance to ensure that Azumarill will hit as hard as possible. Choice Band is the item of choice to further boost its power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Band Azumarill is best used as a wallbreaker early- and mid-game. Because Choice Band is such a prediction reliant item, predict what the opponent will send out and use the appropriate coverage move. If the opponent has a bulky Grass-type such as Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur both of which are capable of beating Choice Band Azumarill, this opportunity can be used to double switch and gain momentum, while wearing down Mega Venusaur if entry hazards have been set up. Azumarill is best used as an offensive check to the likes of Latios, Keldeo, Ground-types such as Landorus-T, and Mega Diancie as it can switch into most of them easily, but can risk burns from Scald in the case of Keldeo or Psyshock from Latios, and Moonblast from Mega Diancie if Azumarill doesn't switch in on Hidden Power Fire or Protect. Azumarill can also clean late-game with its strong Aqua Jet, picking off many weakened threats such as Garchomp, Jirachi, Mega Charizard X, Mega Medicham, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Mega Diancie.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can take on Electric-types, such as Mega Latias, and Clefable can support Azumarill, Mega Latias and Clefable both commonly run Thunder Wave which can cripple their checks for each other.  Pokemon that can take on the bulky Grass-types that wall Azumarill, such as Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, and Mega Pinsir, also make Azumarill's job of nuking everything much easier. Lastly, Pokemon that capitalize on Azumarill's wallbreaking prowess make excellent teammates. Swords Dance Garchomp appreciates the removal of bulky Ground-types, and Swords Dance Talonflame appreciates the removal of Rock-types and Heatran. Additionally, Nasty Plot Thundurus appreciates the removal of bulky Ground-types and Latias, and it also helps Azumarill by taking on bulky Water-types and Skarmory. Mega Lopunny and Diggersby are also decent options as they can pressure and overload checks they have in common such as Grass-types, and the likes of Skarmory and Mega Scizor.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Belly Drum",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Belly Drum maximizes Azumarill's Attack at the cost of half its HP, which turns it into an immediate offensive threat. Aqua Jet is Azumarill's Water-type STAB move, as it hits insanely hard after a boost and has priority, which is often enough to sweep teams by itself. Should that not be sufficient, Play Rough is Azumarill's Fairy-type STAB move that hits slower Pokemon much harder, netting KOs Aqua Jet fails to achieve. The last slot is reserved for Knock Off, which hits everything that Play Rough and Aqua Jet can't. For example, Ferrothorn and Amoonguss, two otherwise solid Azumarill checks, are OHKOed after Stealth Rock by a +6 Knock Off.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread allows Azumarill to outspeed uninvested base 70 Speed Pokemon and below, which includes Skarmory, Tyranitar, and Clefable. Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature are used to give Azumarill as much power as possible. The remaining EVs go into HP to give Azumarill a little bulk, and the HP number is even to ensure that its Sitrus Berry is activated after the Belly Drum. Sitrus Berry is the item of choice to give Azumarill HP back after using Belly Drum, which allows it to survive longer.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is best used late-game after threats have been weakened, as otherwise setting up will be a lost cause. Getting Azumarill in safely is critical, so bringing it in after one of its teammates has been KOed is advisable. Targets to set up on include Fighting-types as well as defensive Pokemon such as Clefable, Hippowdon, and Gliscor, as they fail to deal significant damage to Azumarill. Alternatively, Azumarill does not need to set up every game. There are some situations where using Azumarill for its defensive capabilities is more beneficial, such as when the opponent has a threatening Dragon-, Fighting-, or Fairy-type. In this case, Azumarill makes for a good check because its Sitrus Berry gives it a slight form of recovery that better enables it to do its job.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Azumarill appreciates having its checks and counters removed so it can sweep. Strong Electric-types, such as Raikou, Mega Manectric, Magnezone, and Thundurus help by taking on Skarmory, Talonflame, and bulky Water-types. Additionally, Magnezone is able to trap and KO Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Skarmory. Azumarill appreciates entry hazard support, so Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Swords Dance Garchomp, Air Balloon Heatran, and Kyurem-B make for great partners, as they fit right in on the offensive teams Belly Drum Azumarill finds its home on. Additionally, Azumarill hates entry hazards on its side of the field, so Pokemon capable of removing them, such as Latios, Starmie, and Excadrill, make for good partners. Lastly, Mega Venusaur is a complete roadblock to Azumarill, so teammates that can KO it, such as Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Mega Metagross, and Mega Medicham, are needed.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Assault Vest",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Play Rough and Waterfall are Azumarill's main STAB moves, as they sport good power and coverage. Aqua Jet gives Azumarill a good priority move to work with to help mitigate its low Speed. The fourth slot is a choice between two coverage moves. Knock Off is the preferred move, as it deals good damage and has the added benefit of removing items. Alternatively, Superpower can be used to get a large hit on Ferrothorn, although depending on Ferrothorn's spread, it may only be a 3HKO after the Attack drops.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment allow Azumarill to hit as hard as possible. 240 HP EVs give Azumarill great bulk while also ensuring that Seismic Toss fails to 4HKO. 16 EVs in Special Defense allow Azumarill to reach a Special Defense stat of 300 after the Assault Vest boost, which bolsters its role as an offensive tank. An alternative EV spread of 16 HP / 252 Atk / 240 SpD with an Adamant nature can be used to give Azumarill a lot more Special Defense, but Azumarill then loses out on overall bulk and fails to take physical hits as well.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This variant of Azumarill is used as an offensive tank capable of pivoting into many special attacks while also taking on physical attackers relatively well. This role allows it to work best on bulky offense and balance teams, and it pairs well with Steel- and Dragon-types thanks to their great type synergy. It is also capable of beating most special attackers 1v1, including those that hit it super effectively, such as Thundurus and Gengar. Additionally, Azumarill is a great revenge killer with Aqua Jet and is capable of taking out many weakened Pokemon. Azumarill is also a great spammer of Knock Off, as many of its switch-ins do not appreciate losing their items.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Latios, and Latias take on the Electric- and Grass-types that threaten Azumarill. Ferrothorn and Heatran appreciate Azumarill's ability to take on Fighting- and Ground-types that threaten them, and in return they are able to take on Pokemon such as Thundurus, as well as set up entry hazards. Pokemon that threaten the bulky Steel-types that wall Azumarill make for great partners. Heatran, Talonflame, Magnezone, and Mega Charizard X fit this role well.</p> "

  "Politoed": {
    "overview": "<p>Politoed seems like a fairly unimpressive Pokemon at first glance, but it has access to a great ability in Drizzle that makes it a crucial Pokemon for OU rain teams. It's not that bad of a Pokemon either, as its defenses are high enough for it to tank some fairly strong hits and set up rain multiple times in a match. Furthermore, it has decent offensive stats, a Speed stat that places it just above Clefable and Azumarill with a little bit of investment, and an outstanding support movepool with several options it can profit from, such as Toxic, Encore, and Perish Song. With the weather nerf in XY, rain's popularity as a playstyle has decreased, but that doesn't mean it cannot still be effective. Politoed's major flaw is its lack of reliable recovery, which limits its supportive capabilities, but Rest is usually enough for this concern to be minor. It also has Grass and Electric weaknesses that are compounded by the Water-type Pokemon that enjoy the rain support it provides, forcing the rest of the team to compensate for this, and it is really only viable on rain teams, but these factors don't stop Politoed from being the single most effective form of support for rain teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>An offensive set along the lines of Hydro Pump / Ice Beam / Focus Blast / Psychic can be run with an EV spread of 56 HP / 252 SpA / 200 Spe and a Modest nature, but it is usually not worth it because it takes away from Politoed's longevity and thus its main role, which is functioning as a rain supporter. Perish Song + Whirlpool is an option to trap and remove certain Pokemon, but it only has situational benefits. Sleep Talk can be run so that Politoed has the ability to move while asleep, but Politoed has a lot of moves fighting for slots as it is, so it is usually forgone. Haze is another option that stop foes from setting up, but Encore generally stops them too and has more utility because it stops defensive Pokemon better. An offensive Choice Scarf set is an option which suits Politoed as a revenge killer but reduces the number of rain turns, which are really important for Politoed to do its job well.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Latios and Latias</strong>: Latios and Latias can take any hit Politoed throws at them and deal a lot of damage to it with Psyshock. However, they must be wary of Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey takes little damage from Scald and has both Heal Bell and Natural Cure to heal off status while being able to threaten Politoed in return with Seismic Toss, making it one of Politoed's most effective answers.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Celebi threaten Politoed with their STAB attacks and can beat it relatively easily. However, none of them besides Celebi appreciate a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Powerful Electric-types, such as Magnezone and Thundurus, can beat Politoed quite easily with one of their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Other Weather: Other weather setters such as Tyranitar and Mega Charizard Y can replace the rain with their abilities, preventing Politoed from supporting its teammates with rain.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types, especially SubCM Keldeo and Choice Band Azumarill, can be very threatening to Politoed because they resist Scald and can hit it hard.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is a solid STAB move that is boosted by the rain, which Politoed sets up, and has a useful chance to burn the foe, thus dissuading physical attackers. Toxic wears down bulkier Pokemon and cripples foes such as Latios and Latias that don't really mind a Scald even if it burns. Hypnosis can also be used to put opposing threats to sleep, but it isn't as consistent as Toxic due to its low accuracy and how luck-based the effectiveness of sleep can be in general. Encore prevents Politoed from being taken advantage of by setup sweepers, especially Dragon Dance users and Calm Mind Clefable, and allows it to take advantage of defensive Pokemon that have just used a support move by locking them into the move. The combination of Encore + Toxic is particularly potent against Mega Slowbro, making Politoed an effective check to Calm Mind variants. Rest fills the last moveslot as an important form of recovery for Politoed and allows it to switch in more often to get up rain. A moveslot can also be filled in with Ice Beam, which threatens the Dragon-type Pokemon that like to take advantage of Politoed.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>96 Speed EVs are enough for Politoed to outspeed max Speed Azumarill and lock it into Belly Drum with Encore if it has just used the move. The HP and Special Defense EVs in addition to a Calm nature are conducive to increasing Politoed's longevity and allow it to deal with threats such as Mega Charizard Y. Defense investment and a Bold nature can be run instead to better handle Pokemon such as Talonflame and Tyranitar, but these are fairly easy to cover with teammates and generally not much of a concern for rain teams.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If rain has stopped but is needed for a certain Pokemon to sweep or do its job better, switch Politoed in, as it will summon rain again for eight turns. Politoed is also a good switch-in to other weather setters, as their weather will be removed and replaced by rain; this is especially useful against Mega Charizard Y, which can't reliably use Solar Beam outside of the sun. Try to avoid letting Politoed take a Knock Off, as not having Damp Rock will shorten the length of Politoed's rain by three turns and thus hinder the rest of the rain team. Scald is typically the best option to spam, as it is relatively powerful and nothing really appreciates a burn. Toxic should generally be used to catch Latios, Latias, and certain defensive Pokemon on the switch. Encore foes on their use of a setup move; this will force them to switch. Afterwards, Politoed can decide to switch out if it can't handle the incoming Pokemon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Swift Swim users and other Pokemon that profit from rain, such as Mega Swampert, Kingdra, and Tornadus-T, make great partners, as they benefit from Politoed's rain. Ferrothorn is a solid check to Azumarill, which is a significant issue for rain teams, and benefits from the decreased power of Fire-type moves; other Pokemon weak to Fire-type attacks, such as Mega Scizor, Breloom, and Mega Metagross, appreciate Politoed's support for this reason. Other good partners include those that can beat Electric-types that trouble Politoed, such as Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Mega Swampert. Teammates such as Mega Pinsir and Tornadus-T can threaten Grass-types that trouble Politoed and rain teams in general, so they make great partners as well. Last but not least, other Pokemon that can set up rain, such as Thundurus and Zapdos, are good choices for rain teams, as they can serve as back-up rain setters if Politoed is pressured or has been taken out.</p> "

  "Quagsire": {
    "overview": "<p>With its great defensive typing and fantastic ability in Unaware combined with decent physical bulk and access to reliable recovery, Quagsire has fashioned itself a clear niche in OU as a physical wall capable of taking on fearsome setup sweepers such as Belly Drum Azumarill, Mega Scizor, Mega Altaria, and Mega Charizard X. With Scald and Recover, it can stall out a good number of physical attackers in the tier, and a range of other move options means that it has very good defensive utility. Its Water / Ground typing gives it four resistances and an immunity to Electric, which, combined with its neutrality to Ice, makes it an excellent stop to momentum-grabbing Electric-types such as Raikou and Mega Manectric. It has only one weakness, but it is a 4x weakness to Grass, which means that it can be caught out by coverage moves such as Mega Metagross's Grass Knot. Additionally, while Quagsire can be very effective in a physically defensive role, its special bulk is somewhat lacking, and it can be 2HKOed by even relatively weak special moves. It also has underwhelming stats all-around, which prevent it from walling some of the most powerful physical attackers in the tier, and it is severely hindered by status ailments, as the chip damage from burn and poison can cripple it as an effective wall. Lastly, it faces competition from the other main Unaware user in OU, Clefable, as, while Quagsire checks physical threats more effectively, Clefable has better special bulk and can bring far more general utility to a team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Both Haze and Yawn can be used to shut down Stored Power users, such as Clefable and Mega Latias, and Mold Breaker users, such as Mega Gyarados, which could otherwise boost up in the face of Quagsire's Unaware. Haze is the more reliable option, being able to function if the target is already inflicted with a status condition, another member of the opposing team is asleep, or the target is behind a Substitute; Yawn is less reliable for removing boosts, but it provides more general utility in putting foes to sleep, punishing switch-ins, and shuffling foes around to take entry hazard damage. Ice Beam can be used to hit switch-ins such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp super effectively. Curse gives Quagsire more offensive presence and can give stall teams a clear way of closing games out.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-type Attacks: With its 4x weakness to Grass, Quagsire falls to any moderately powerful Grass-type attack. Even when burnt, Breloom has a good chance to OHKO Quagsire with Bullet Seed, and almost every special Grass-type attack can easily OHKO it. Quagsire can also be OHKOed by Grass-type coverage moves such as Manaphy's Energy Ball and Mega Metagross's Grass Knot, even without STAB or full investment.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Several strong special attackers, such as Life Orb Latios and Choice Specs Keldeo, can OHKO Quagsire even with neutral hits, and very few of them fail to outspeed and 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: A select group of physical attackers can 2HKO Quagsire even without boosts, such as offensive Landorus-T, Life Orb Excadrill, and Choice Band Azumarill.</p> <p><strong>Status Ailments: Poison and burn prevent Quagsire from remaining at full health, limiting its effectiveness as a check and preventing it from stalling Pokemon out with Recover so effectively. Toxic in particular will eventually force Quagsire out, regardless of how little damage the foe can inflict.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt prevents Quagsire from recovering off chip damage before it is forced out, which can prevent it from switching in against threats that fail to 2HKO it from full health.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker</strong>: Pokemon with Mold Breaker such as Mega Gyarados can set up in the face of Quagsire and KO it with boosted stats, unhindered by Unaware's effect.</p> <p><strong>Stored Power</strong>: Stored Power users such as Mega Latias and Clefable can bypass Unaware by boosting the Base Power of the move itself, and after enough boosts they easily KO Quagsire.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald and Recover are essential moves for Quagsire to do its job, as they allow it to burn and then stall out physical attackers such as Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Scizor. Earthquake gives good neutral coverage in conjunction with Scald and allows Quagsire to beat Pokemon that are immune to burns such as Heatran and Mega Charizard X. Toxic is generally the best option for the fourth moveslot to punish switch-ins such as Manaphy and Latios before Quagsire is forced out, without having to rely on Scald's 30% chance to burn. Encore can also be used instead to stop Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados and Suicune from setting up on Quagsire, the former of which ignores Quagsire's Unaware, and the latter of which can stall Quagsire out.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Defense-boosting nature lets Quagsire best check the physical threats it is meant to. A Relaxed nature is used over Impish or Bold to maximize its damage output, which is far more useful to it than its paltry Speed. Leftovers gives Quagsire valuable passive recovery. Unaware allows Quagsire to check certain setup sweepers that would otherwise destroy defensive teams.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is important to keep Quagsire at close-to-full health as long as there is something on the opponent's team that it is needed to check. Do not let it take any unnecessary damage, as several of the threats it is often required to check only fail to 2HKO it by a matter of a few percent. Status conditions, especially burn and poison, can cripple Quagsire and remove it as a check to certain Pokemon, so be wary around foes that can inflict them, such as Talonflame and Mega Charizard X with Will-O-Wisp. Do not overestimate Quagsire's physical bulk, either: certain physical attackers, such as Life Orb Excadrill, Choice Band Azumarill, and Mega Pinsir, can 2HKO it even with no boosts, so do not assume that it is an automatic check to any physical attacker as long as it is healthy. Quagsire should very rarely come in on a special attack, as its special bulk is very poor, though its typing allows it to counter several Electric-types in the tier. Among those it can counter are Magnezone, Raikou, and Mega Manectric, all of which it threatens back with Earthquake.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can take on Grass-types pair well with Quagsire, as Grass-types easily force Quagsire out with their STAB moves regardless of boosts. They are especially threatening if they are not seriously hindered by a potential burn from Scald on the switch. Assault Vest Tornadus-T is one potential partner, being able to come in against the likes of Serperior, Mega Venusaur, and Celebi and generally force them out. Even outside of super effective hits, Quagsire cannot take any strong special attacks well, so bulky special walls make good partners for it. Ferrothorn is a decent option in this role, as not only does it resist Grass and take hits from strong special attackers such as Latios, but it also takes on Manaphy lacking Hidden Power Fire, which is a considerable threat to defensive teams, on which Quagsire is usually used. Quagsire is crippled by status ailments, so it greatly appreciates cleric support from Pokemon with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy such as Chansey, Clefable, and Sylveon. Quagsire is also very easily worn down by entry hazards, so ways to remove them and, preferably, keep them off the field in the first place are appreciated. Latias is a good Defogger to pair with Quagsire, as, in addition to removing entry hazards for it, it can take on several Pokemon that cause Quagsire problems, such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Venusaur, and Manaphy, and it appreciates Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Bisharp, and Weavile being reliably checked and worn down.</p> "

  "Slowking": {
    "overview": "<p>Slowking's higher Special Defense compared to Slowbro's allows it to much more safely check dangerous Pokemon such as Choice Specs Keldeo and Latios. A good defensive typing provides it with many useful resistances, and its ability Regenerator allows it to pivot consistently throughout a match. Slowking also has good coverage in Flamethrower and great utility options in Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Protect. However, Slowking's Defense stat is much lower than Slowbro's, forcing it to use Protect to have a chance in Pursuit mind games and making it a much more shaky check to physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Metagross, and Gliscor. Its Water / Psychic typing also leaves it weak to common utility and coverage moves attacks like U-turn, Volt Switch, Knock Off, Pursuit, and Thunder Punch.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Calm Mind and Nasty Plot are two options that allow Slowking to function as a standalone defensive sweeper, but Mega Slowbro is a better Calm Mind sweeper because it has better physical bulk and is less vulnerable to status. Fire Blast can be used over Flamethrower to deal more damage but suffers from inaccuracy and low PP. Colbur Berry can be used without Protect to help Slowking versus Pursuit and free up a coverage or status option. Dragon Tail is useful for phazing a boosted Suicune, Volcarona, Gliscor, or Reuniclus. Power Gem is a coverage option that does more damage to Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Talonflame, but it is generally an inferior option to the listed moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Status-immune Pokemon: Clefable and Reuniclus both have Magic Guard and are able to use Slowking as setup fodder, only fearing Thunder Wave. Mega Slowbro with Rest is also able to use Calm Mind in front of Slowking and heal off any damage and status conditions. Gliscor is able to comfortably use Slowking as setup fodder once its Toxic Orb has activated, and it avoids the 2HKO from Scald. Mega Altaria can use Refresh or Heal Bell to remove status conditions. Chansey and Starmie both have Natural Cure and can remove status simply by switching out.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers: Mega Metagross and Mega Medicham with Thunder Punch are able to easily break through Slowking. Mega Scizor fears Scald burns and the occasional Fire-type coverage but is able to cripple Slowking with a strong U-turn or Knock Off. Strong neutral physical attacks only need a small amount of prior chip to be able to 2HKO Slowking, such as Mega Diancie's Diamond Storm, Mega Lopunny's Return, and offensive Landorus-T’s and Excadrill's Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Weavile and Bisharp can OHKO Slowking with Knock Off, and Bisharp can even set up with Swords Dance. Tyranitar can easily 2HKO Slowking with Crunch and only fears a Scald burn or Thunder Wave. Hydreigon can use Dark Pulse to heavily damage Slowking but has to risk a Scald burn or Thunder Wave in retaliation.</p> <p><strong>Status Effects: Burn and Toxic poison severely limit Slowking's ability to switch into its usual checks and are dealt out by common Pokemon such as Heatran, Rotom-W, Slowbro, Garchomp, Excadrill, Keldeo, and more. Paralysis from Rotom-W, Clefable, and Ferrothorn will not wear Slowking down but can prevent it from safely scouting the foe's move or getting off an attack.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Amoonguss, Venusaur, and Tangrowth take little damage from any of Slowking's attacks and threaten it out with sleep in the case of Amoonguss, Knock Off in the case of Venusaur, or both in the case of Tangrowth. Serperior is a more offensive counter that does not switch in continually but can set up with Leaf Storm against Slowking. However, none of these Pokemon appreciate being burned or paralyzed, and switching into Flamethrower repeatedly can be troublesome for them.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is highly spammable and offers a 30% chance to burn, threatening potential switch-ins like Tornadus-T, Ferrothorn, and Amoonguss. Protect is used to gain an extra turn of Leftovers recovery and scout opposing Choice-locked Pokemon. Slack Off in tandem with Regenerator helps Slowking stay healthy throughout the match. The last moveslot can be occupied by a number of viable options. Thunder Wave prevents Slowking from being unable to threaten Clefable and other switch-ins. Toxic is an alternative status choice that can cripple Pokemon that don’t mind Thunder Wave, such as Mega Slowbro and Rotom-W. Flamethrower prevents common Steel-types from getting free turns versus Slowking, such as Mega Scizor and Bisharp trying to set up with Swords Dance, Ferrothorn trying to lay entry hazards, and Mega Metagross and Magnezone looking to threaten Slowking with their Electric-type moves.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given Special Defense investment along with a Calm nature lets Slowking hit a number of defensive benchmarks, such as avoiding the 2HKO from Choice Specs Keldeo's Hidden Power Grass after Stealth Rock damage, the KO from Mega Charizard Y’s Flamethrower into Solar Beam, and the OHKO from Modest Choice Specs Hydreigon's Dark Pulse. The Defense investment allows Slowking to avoid the 2HKO from Adamant Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick after using Protect. Other notable benchmarks include Mega Metagross's Meteor Mash into Thunder Punch, Mega Diancie's Diamond Storm after Stealth Rock damage, and Mega Lopunny's Return, all of which either do not 2HKO or have a very small chance to do so.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Slowking should be used as a defensive pivot into Pokemon that cannot KO it like Mega Metagross, Keldeo, and Tornadus-T. From there, feel free to apply pressure with the threat of a Scald burn or Thunder Wave. Pivoting to heal with Regenerator after using Slack Off is unnecessary, as it makes you lose momentum. Protect helps scout whether the opponent is going to attempt to Pursuit trap Slowking or not and is useful in general to restore more HP with Leftovers. Use Slack Off when necessary, as Slowking needs to stay healthy to be able to check the Pokemon it's supposed to.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Clefable is a great partner, serving as a late-game sweeper with Calm Mind; switch-in to Weavile, Latios, and Mega Altaria; and status absorber. Slowking can switch into Steel- and Fire-types like Mega Metagross, Excadrill, Heatran, and Mega Charizard Y in return. Tornadus-T forms a Regenerator core with Slowking, functions as a fast pivot with U-turn, and helps cover Slowking's Grass-type weakness. Dragon Dance Mega Altaria is a late-game sweeper and appreciates Slowking switching into Ice-types. It can also remove status from Slowking with Heal Bell and pivot into Electric-types that threaten Slowking, such as Magnezone and Rotom-W. Heatran and Excadrill make for great partners, as both are able to counter Clefable and set Stealth Rock. Excadrill can also remove hazards with Rapid Spin and switch into Electric-types. On the other hand, Heatran counters Grass-types like Serperior and Mega Venusaur. Slowking can cover Excadrill's weaknesses by switching into Water- and Fighting-types like Keldeo and Mega Lopunny. Tangrowth and Amoonguss are two defensive Grass-types that also form a Regenerator core with Slowking. Tangrowth checks physical attackers such as Mega Metagross and Gliscor, which Slowking may be unable to check alone. Amoonguss can act as a switch-in to Clefable and backup counter to Keldeo, while Slowking can switch into Heatran, Latios, and Tornadus-T.</p> "

The combination of its high Attack stat and Swords Dance allows it to break through many defensive cores, and STAB Technician-boosted Bullet Punch, lets it function as a revenge killer and good setup sweeper alongside Swords Dance. Mega Scizor can also provide momentum with U-turn, Pursuit trap Pokemon like Latios, and provide Defog support for its team, making it a great utility Pokemon as well. Although Mega Scizor's defensive typing allows it to check many threats, it is still vulnerable to dangerous Fire-types and Pokemon that carry Fire-type coverage such as Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, Hidden Power Fire Magnezone, Flamethrower Clefable, and Heat Wave Tornadus-T. Mega Scizor also does not have the best Speed stat, making it vulnerable to faster offensive threats like Keldeo and Thundurus.</p> ",

Roost is a reliable recovery move for Mega Scizor in order for it to stay healthy, which is important so it can check or take on hits from opposing Pokemon. Bullet Punch is a STAB priority move that is able to utilize Mega Scizor's ability in Technician. It also pairs well with Swords Dance, allowing Mega Scizor to break through teams while also threatening faster threats like Mega Diancie. Superpower is used as a way to hit Steel-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, Magnezone, and Excadrill that resist Bullet Punch. Knock Off is a great spammable move to remove items like Leftovers on Heatran and Choice Specs on Keldeo. Knock Off can also get rid of Choice Scarf from Magnezone, allowing Mega Scizor to outspeed it. It also gives coverage to hit the likes of Rotom-W and Slowbro.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>216 EVs in Speed allow Mega Scizor to outspeed Choice Scarf Hidden Power Fire Magnezone after a Knock Off. 248 HP EVs with 16 Special Defense EVs allow Mega Scizor to survive two Choice Specs-boosted Surfs from Latios without Stealth Rock. Light Metal is the chosen ability to take less damage from attacks like Low Kick from Weavile; Mega Scizor regains the ability Technician upon Mega Evolution.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Scizor acts as a switch-in to the likes of Clefable, Mega Metagross, Mega Diancie, and Weavile. Be aware of Fire-type coverage moves like Hidden Power Fire from Mega Diancie and Flamethrower from Clefable. When Mega Scizor's checks are low enough, use Swords Dance on Pokemon that can't threaten it like Ferrothorn and Fairy-types that lack Fire-type coverage. Use Bullet Punch on Pokemon that get hit super effectively or neutrally by it, such as Latios, Mega Lopunny, Clefable, Mega Altaria, Weavile, and Tyranitar to heavily damage them. Make sure Mega Scizor is healthy enough to reliably take on threats by using Roost. Superpower can be used against switch-ins like Keldeo and Heatran to do a significant amount of damage. Keep in mind that Superpower does lower Mega Scizor's Attack and Defense after each use. Knock Off can be used to remove items while also hitting Pokemon like Slowbro, Jellicent, and Mega Latias for super effective damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Scizor struggles to take on Fire-types. Water-types like Slowbro can help with these Fire-types while also checking Keldeo, another Pokemon that Mega Scizor struggles with. Gastrodon can also help with Fire-types like Heatran and absorb Water-type moves from Keldeo while also checking Electric-types like Zapdos and Thundurus. Heatran deals with Flying-types like Zapdos and Heat Wave Tornadus-T and absorbs Fire-type moves. Heatran can be used to scout out Fire-type moves from Fairy-types like Clefable as well. Gliscor can absorb status moves like Will-O-Wisp and deal with the likes of Heatran and Magnezone. Gliscor can also help dealing with Flamethrower variants of Clefable, while Mega Scizor can take on Ice Beam variants of Clefable. Partners that can remove entry hazards like Excadrill, Latios, and Starmie are appreciated by Mega Scizor, as entry hazards can easily wear it down and put it in range of opposing attacks. Pokemon that can spread paralysis like Clefable to cripple Pokemon such as Heatran that would usually outspeed Mega Scizor. Pokemon such as Latios and Starmie that can bait Dark-types like Choice Band Weavile and Choice Scarf Tyranitar into using Pursuit are good partners with Mega Scizor, as it is able to come in to set up against them. Magnezone enjoys switching into Mega Scizor and KOing it with a Hidden Power Fire, so Pokemon that can take advantage of Magnezone being Choice locked into Hidden Power Fire like Azumarill, Volcarona, and Manaphy are appreciated by Mega Scizor.</p> "

Bullet Punch gives Mega Scizor a form of priority, making it harder to be revenge killed while also allowing it to revenge kill or clean up teams. Bug Bite hits bulky Water- and Grass-types like Slowbro, Rotom-W, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss.

It's best used to sweep teams when its checks and counters are worn down or eliminated. Because of the lack of bulk and reliable recovery, it can't come into attacks too often. Doubling, sacking, and pivoting via U-turn and Volt Switch are the best ways to safely bring it in. Use Swords Dance on Pokemon that aren't able to threaten Mega Scizor like Choice-locked Latios, Ferrothorn, and Fairy-types that lack a Fire-type move. Bullet Punch should be used to revenge kill foes thanks to its priority. Use Superpower to hit Steel-types like Excadrill or on the switch against checks like Heatran or Keldeo.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This specific Mega Scizor set belongs on hyper offense teams. Entry hazards help Mega Scizor by putting Pokemon in range of its attacks. Shuckle is a good partner, as it can set both Sticky Web and Stealth Rock.

  "Shuckle": {
    "overview": "<p>Last generation, Shuckle was stuck in NU, incapable of doing much besides sitting around and Toxic stalling until it fainted. But when XY came around, Shuckle got access to a rare and unique move: Sticky Web. Being the most reliable user of Sticky Web is a small but valuable niche that no other Pokemon in the metagame can boast. This, along with its useful access to Stealth Rock, allows Shuckle to see the light of OU. Despite having no offensive presence, Shuckle cannot be set up on thanks to its access to Encore.</p> <p>However, don't be fooled into thinking Shuckle is a flawless Pokemon. Its base 230 defenses are offset by a terrible base 20 HP, meaning that Shuckle isn't as bulky as it seems. It is crippled by Taunt and Trick, though the former is somewhat remedied by Mental Herb. Weaknesses to common Water-, Rock-, and Steel-type moves, along with no reliable recovery, mean that Shuckle won't be staying for long. It will always be moving last because of its nonexistent base 5 Speed, which means that it will have to take a hit before doing anything. It is essentially a sitting duck on the battlefield, and it has to rely on Toxic or Infestation to do any damage. It also receives competition from Smeargle as a Sticky Web user, as it gets Magic Coat to ward off Taunt and Spore to provide opportunities to set up Sticky Web. However, Shuckle is much bulkier and much more reliable than Smeargle, and can't be set up on. Despite these shortcomings, Shuckle provides valuable support to Sticky Web teams, and in the right hands, can be a thorn in your opponent's side.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shuckle gets a decent offensive movepool, but putrid offensive stats prevent Shuckle from running any other attacking options. Acupressure can turn Shuckle into a monstrous tank, but it is ultimately a luck-based move, and Shuckle will often not have enough time to set it up properly. Rest is an option for full recovery, but the loss of momentum generated by using Rest is so great that it's hardly worth it, even when paired with a cleric. Besides, Shuckle doesn't need to last forever, it just needs to get down a couple of hazards for its team. Power Split averages the offensive stats of two Pokemon, and can be useful as it essentially halves the foe's offensive stats as Shuckle's are nonexistent. Shell Smash can be used with Contrary to act as a pseudo-Cosmic Power along with Toxic, Rest, and Power Split. However, this set is incredibly hard to pull off correctly in the fast-paced OU metagame, as it is countered by Taunt users, Poison-types, and Steel-types. As a result, it will often be a waste of a teamslot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Pokemon with Magic Bounce, such as Espeon and Mega Absol, reflect back any hazards that Shuckle tries to set up, preventing Shuckle from completing its job. However, Shuckle can deal with these Pokemon to some extent by trapping them with Infestation and switching to an appropriate counter.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks: Any Pokemon with a strong super effective STAB attack can deal with Shuckle decently, but will not prevent Shuckle from getting up Sticky Web. Examples include Keldeo, Scizor, and Terrakion.</p> <p><strong>Bisharp: Bisharp is one of the best counters to Shuckle, as the Speed drop from Sticky Web doubles its Attack via Defiant. It can then OHKO Shuckle with Iron Head and attempt a sweep.</p> <p><strong>Hazard Removal</strong>: Rapid Spin and Defog users such as Excadrill and Mandibuzz are useful for removing Sticky Web, but they must be wary of Encore and in the case of Defog a Bisharp paired with Shuckle.</p> ",

        "name": "Sticky Web",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sticky Web is Sticky Web, and Shuckle's number one mission is to set it up. Stealth Rock creates a nice entry hazard combination with Sticky Web, as it does a lot of damage to the Flying-types that are immune to Sticky Web. Encore is very important, as without it, Shuckle is huge setup bait. It also generates useful momentum for Shuckle's team. Infestation is useful for racking up damage and trapping opponents. It also has no immunities and isn't affected by Taunt, unlike Toxic. However, if your team deals with Steel- and Poison-types fairly well, Toxic can go in the last slot, as it does more damage over time and doesn't go away after a few turns like Infestation does. Knock Off is a great utility move for Shuckle to use, as it cripples Pokemon that rely heavily on their items, such as Heatran and Chansey, but it is quite weak coming from an uninvested Shuckle and can get in the way of other Knock Off users.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 EVs with a Bold nature give Shuckle maximum bulk on the physical side, while minimizing Foul Play and confusion damage. Mental Herb gives Shuckle a chance against users of Taunt, Trick, and status, allowing it to get up at least one of its hazards. Sturdy ensures that Shuckle will lay down either Sticky Web or Stealth Rock without getting OHKOed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As a general rule of thumb, use Stealth Rock before Sticky Web when the opponent has a Pokemon that is 4x weak to it, or when the opponent has two or more Pokemon immune to Sticky Web. Otherwise, use Sticky Web first. Once you have laid down hazards, use a combination of Infestation and Encore to trap the opponent, and switch to an appropriate counter. However, do not hesitate to use Encore if you predict a setup move. Also use Encore when you predict a Rapid Spin or Defog. One of two things will happen: they will switch out, and you get Sticky Web up on the switch, or they stay in, and you switch to a setup sweeper and attempt a sweep from there. Shuckle is best used as a lead, setting up hazards and using Infestation and Encore to mess with your opponent, switching out whenever necessary. If you need to, don't be afraid to fodder Shuckle, as its main job is to set up hazards. However, if you spot a potential Rapid Spin or Defog user on the opposing team, you should save Shuckle in order to set up hazards again.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Shuckle should only be used on teams that intend to abuse Sticky Web to its fullest. Therefore, Shuckle works well with any Pokemon that has high Attack or Special Attack and middling Speed; examples include, but are not limited to, Manaphy, Chandelure, Kyurem-B, Haxorus, Dragonite, Hydreigon, Landorus-T, Mamoswine, Exploud, Mega Heracross, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Medicham, and Mega Charizard Y. Bisharp is almost necessary for its ability to take advantage of Defog users; something that Shuckle absolutely hates. Mega Heracross, Keldeo, and Terrakion can take care of opposing Bisharp trying to take advantage of Sticky Web, and benefit from Sticky Web as well. Ghost-types, such as Gengar, are also useful for blocking Rapid Spin.</p> "

Likewise, Mega Heracross is rather easy to revenge kill, especially for more offensively oriented teams. Furthermore, checks such as Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, and Talonflame are as common as ever, meaning that Mega Heracross sometimes struggles in the current metagame. That being said, Mega Heracross is great at taking advantage of some prominent Pokemon such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Mega Lopunny, making it an excellent choice if one is looking for a bulky wallbreaker with insane power.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Scarf set with Moxie is a decent option that outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame while gaining more power with each KO. However, neither of Heracross's STAB moves are particularly spammable, and thus the set is normally outclassed by Choice Scarf Landorus-T or Choice Scarf Terrakion. Another option is a Guts set using Toxic Orb with Swords Dance for extreme wallbreaking power, but regular Heracross lacks the bulk of its Mega Evolution and is worn down rather easily.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon That Resist Mega Heracross's STAB Moves: Physically defensive variants of Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Clefable all avoid being 2HKOed by Mega Heracross. Landorus-T is primarily a check due to Intimidate and its ability to go one-for-one against Mega Heracross in many scenarios. It also threatens to badly poison Mega Heracross with Toxic or pivot with U-turn into something that can beat Mega Heracross. Gliscor can net a 2HKO on Mega Heracross with an unboosted Acrobatics or attempt to stall out Mega Heracross with a combination of Toxic and Roost. Physically defensive Clefable is perhaps the best check to Mega Heracross, as it avoids the 2HKO from Rock Blast and 2HKOes Mega Heracross with Moonblast in return.</p> <p><strong>Fast Revenge Killers: Numerous common revenge killers such as Mega Alakazam, Mega Manectric, and Life Orb Tornadus-T can come in after Mega Heracross has gotten a KO and retaliate with a super effective move.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Tornadus-T, Talonflame, and Mega Pinsir can switch into Mega Heracross's STAB moves and KO with their own Flying-type STAB attack. Skarmory can switch into any move that is not Close Combat, tank a Close Combat, and then KO with Brave Bird or Counter.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Charizard X are able to stomach one or both of Mega Heracross's STAB attacks and OHKO in return with Fire-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types are typically fast enough to outpace Mega Heracross and revenge kill it after it has taken out another Pokemon. However, most of them, such as Latios, Alakazam, and Starmie, have low physical bulk, so they must be wary of switching into Mega Heracross.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairies such as Azumarill and Mega Gardevoir resist one or both of Mega Heracross's STAB attacks and can either KO it or deal a huge amount of damage in return.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Close Combat is Mega Heracross's strongest Fighting-type STAB attack and severely dents anything that doesn't resist it. Pin Missile is Mega Heracross's secondary STAB move, which hits an impressive 125 Base Power thanks to Skill Link and nets at least neutral damage on Psychic-types that resist Close Combat. Rock Blast also benefits from Skill Link and achieves great coverage alongside Mega Heracross's STAB moves, hitting Flying-types like Talonflame and Tornadus-T super effectively and a few other targets for neutral damage. Substitute is preferred in the last slot to ease prediction and make use of the numerous switches Mega Heracross forces. A second possibility for the final slot is Swords Dance, as it boosts Mega Heracross's power to ridiculous levels while also mitigating the effects of Landorus-T's Intimidate. Bullet Seed is yet a third option whose primary use is to OHKO Azumarill and Quagsire; however, these are 2HKOed by Mega Heracross's Rock Blast and STAB attacks, respectively, making Bullet Seed a generally inferior option.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Heracronite is the item of choice for the substantial boost in power and bulk it provides. Moxie is the preferred ability before Mega Evolving to nab an Attack boost against a weakened foe or predicted sacrifice, though it can be somewhat unreliable, as Pin Missile, Rock Blast, and Bullet Seed are all rather weak without the guaranteed five hits from Skill Link. The given EV spread has enough Speed investment to outpace uninvested Landorus-T after Mega Evolving. The Attack EVs, paired with an Adamant nature, ensure a 2HKO on standard Magic Guard Clefable with Rock Blast most of the time. The remaining EVs are placed into HP to make use of Mega Heracross's great bulk, allowing it to takes hits from threats such as Bisharp, Mega Lopunny, and Weavile much better.</p> <p>If speed is not a concern, some EVs may be removed from Speed to reach a few other benchmarks. Specifically, 92 Speed EVs allows Mega Heracross to outpace uninvested Rotom-W, while 56 speed EVs helps it outpace Adamant Azumarill. Any EVs removed from Speed should be placed into Defense, as Mega Heracross's typing makes it more suited to tanking physical hits. A more offensive spread of 252 Atk / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature is an option as well, though it should be noted that Mega Heracross will still be outsped by most offensive threats.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Heracross is best utilized as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker thanks to its impressive power and substantial bulk. In general, you want to get Mega Heracross on the field as often as possible to give it the most wallbreaking opportunities for your late-game cleaner or sweeper. You should bring Mega Heracross in against foes such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar or Choice Specs Keldeo that are Choice locked into resisted attacks or defensive Pokemon that cannot do much to it once it is behind a Substitute, such as Amoonguss or Tangrowth. A slow Volt Switch or U-turn or a predicted double switch are also effective means of getting Mega Heracross onto the field.</p> <p>Once Mega Heracross is in battle, it is recommended to set up a Substitute only if you need to ease prediction against threats like Talonflame or Tornadus-T. If your opponent lacks threats such as these, firing off either of Mega Heracross's high-powered STAB attacks is generally the better strategy. More specifically, you should be wary of pointlessly wasting Mega Heracross's HP if your opponent lacks switch-ins to either of Mega Heracross's STAB attacks. Lastly, before Mega Evolving, it is possible to net an Attack boost with Moxie, though this strategy is not particularly reliable due the relatively low power of Heracross's moves if Skill Link is not active. On a similar note, forgoing Mega Evolution to keep a bit of extra Speed might prove useful in some scenarios, as Heracross is able to Speed tie threats such as Adamant Bisharp at worst before Mega Evolving.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Thundurus is an excellent partner for Mega Heracross, as it KOes Flying-types such as Talonflame, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T. Thundurus also provides speed control via Prankster Thunder Wave and can remove the items of defensive threats such as Clefable. Rotom-W and Raikou are likewise great partners for their ability to beat Flying-types with the added benefit of being able to bring Mega Heracross in safely with Volt Switch. Similarly, other pivots such as Landorus-T and Jirachi make solid partners as well. Mega Heracross also appreciates Pursuit support, with Assault Vest Metagross in particular being a good partner for its ability to beat and/or trap Latios, Latias, Clefable, and Mega Gardevoir. Tyranitar also deserves a mention for its reliability in trapping even bulky Psychic-types while also beating Talonflame. Glare Serperior is a fantastic offensive partner that can lure in and paralyze threats such as Heatran and Tornadus-T for Mega Heracross. Serperior also does well against certain checks such as Azumarill and Clefable. Finally, bulky Steel-type hazard setters and status users such as Heatran, Klefki, and Ferrothorn are excellent partners because of their defensive synergy with Mega Heracross and their ability to enhance Mega Heracross's wallbreaking abilities with entry hazards and/or status.</p> "

Skarmory also has access to many utility moves, like Spikes to wear down foes as they switch in, Roost to stay healthy, and Whirlwind to phase foes. Skarmory does, however, have very low HP and Special Defense stats, making it vulnerable to strong special attackers like Keldeo, Thundurus, and Mega Charizard Y, and its Flying / Steel typing leaves it vulnerable to common types in Fire and Electric.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shed Shell is a viable item to avoid being trapped by Magnezone. Iron Head hits Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Diancie. Toxic slowly wears down common switch-ins like Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Zapdos. Taunt can be used over Brave Bird or Counter to stop entry hazards like Sticky Webs, Stealth Rock, and opposing Spikes. Taunt also stops foes' healing moves like Soft-Boiled from Chansey and Clefable and setup moves like Calm Mind.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon and Moves: Thundurus is able to switch into Skarmory and threaten it with a Thunderbolt. Zapdos and Rotom-W can safely switch into Skarmory and threaten it with an Electric-type move like Discharge or Volt Switch, respectively; Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W is also problematic.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Spikes is useful for wearing down foes as they switch in, especially when used with Whirlwind. Roost is used to keep Skarmory healthy and out of range of its foes' attacks. Whirlwind allows Skarmory to phaze foes, which is useful against setup sweepers like Swords Dance Mega Pinsir and Excadrill, and prevent Substitute Serperior from using it as setup fodder. Alternatively, Defog removes entry hazards like Stealth Rock and opposing Spikes. Brave Bird does decent damage versus threats like Serperior and Tornadus-T, whereas Counter can be used to handle physical attackers that Skarmory likes to come in on like Swords Dance Excadrill, Mega Lopunny, and Weavile.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment helps Skarmory check a wide range of physical attackers like Weavile, Excadrill, Mega Pinsir, Mega Lopunny, Bisharp, Mega Scizor, and many more. Rocky Helmet is used to punish and chip Pokemon that use contact moves, such U-turn Landorus-T and Mega Scizor, Iron Head Excadrill, and Meteor Mash Mega Metagross. Sturdy is chosen to allow Skarmory to take any one hit from full HP and retaliate with a Whirlwind or Counter. If you use Counter over Brave Bird, a Bold nature can be used to lower damage taken from confusion and Foul Play. Skarmory also has the option to run a more specially defensive EV spread to better take attacks from Mega Diancie, Latios, Tornadus-T, and other special attackers.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Skarmory's two main roles are to lay Spikes and check physical attackers. Keep Skarmory healthy with Roost to reliably switch into attacks and use Whirlwind on threats that are trying to set up, such as Swords Dance Excadrill and Pinsir and Calm Mind Clefable without Thunderbolt or Flamethrower. Take advantage of Sturdy to eat any one hit and retaliate with a Counter or Whirlwind. Be wary of strong Fire- and Electric-type coverage moves such as Fire Blast from Garchomp, Flamethrower from Clefable, Heat Wave from Tornadus-T, and Thunder Punch from Mega Metagross. Try to scout for these moves by using Roost when expecting Skarmory to be hit by one or switching out. Also, be wary of Magnezone, which can come in and trap Skarmory with Magnet Pull. Skarmory can use Whirlwind as it comes in or simply double switch out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Skarmory is best used on bulkier team archetypes like stall and balance. Chansey can help Skarmory take on special attacks while appreciating Skarmory's ability to soak up physical attacks. Gastrodon deals with Electric-types like Magnezone and Fire-types like Heatran. Gliscor can help Skarmory deal with Fire-types like Heatran, acts as a status absorber, and appreciates Skarmory baiting Magnezone to lock itself into an Electric-type move so it can set up with Swords Dance. Clefable is also able to absorb status moves like Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W and can cripple threats like Heatran with a Thunder Wave or Knock Off. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can help eliminate hazard removers like Latios and Latias to keep Skarmory's Spikes up. Amoonguss resists Electric-type moves and deals with threatening Water-types like Keldeo. It also has access to Spore to put common shared switch-ins like Heatran to sleep. Offensive Pokemon like Alakazam, Serperior, and Bisharp appreciate Skarmory's Spikes, as they put foes in range of their attacks.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Though it is often forgotten, Mega Houndoom brings a huge amount of utility to the table, checking dangerous threats such as Bisharp and Latios. It also has favorable matchups against common Pokemon; against offensive teams, common switch-ins to it such as Tyranitar and Azumarill are crippled by Will-O-Wisp, while stall teams are troubled by Taunt. Mega Houndoom's access to Nasty Plot and its high Speed allows it to sweep teams with ease. However, its weakness to Stealth Rock can be troublesome: it also is forced out by threats such as Keldeo, Heatran, Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, Mega Lopunny and Mega Altaria. Nonetheless, Mega Houndoom's utility and ability to sweep balanced teams easily makes it a solid choice to build around.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sucker Punch is Mega Houndoom's only option for priority and can mitigate issues against opposing priority and Choice Scarf users. However, it is quite weak without Attack investment. Destiny Bond is a viable alternative in the last slot, but the utility provided by Taunt or Will-O-Wisp or the coverage given by Hidden Power Grass is usually superior. Finally, Sludge Bomb is an option used to hit Mega Altaria and Assault Vest Azumarill harder, but Mega Houndoom needs Taunt or Will-O-Wisp to be effective.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Garchomp, Choice Scarf Keldeo, Mega Aerodactyl, Excadrill, and Terrakion make for great offensive checks or counters to Mega Houndoom, depending on the field condition. Strong priority users such as Breloom, Talonflame, and Conkeldurr are also good checks or counters to Mega Houndoom. Thundurus can paralyze Houndoom, crippling it. Also, Pokemon that naturally outspeed Mega Houndoom and can hit it super effectively, such as Mega Lopunny and Tornadus-T, make for good checks to Mega Houndoom.</p> <p><strong>Mega Diancie: Mega Diancie can switch into Mega Houndoom with ease, as it walls Mega Houndoom's STAB moves and can bounce Will-O-Wisp back. It can then easily OHKO Mega Houndoom with Diamond Storm back.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar replaces sun with sand, resists Mega Houndoom's STAB moves, and has the bulk to take anything before retaliating with Stone Edge. Tyranitar is thus Mega Houndoom's best counter. Tyranitar can still be eliminated by a combination of Sunny Day and Solar Beam on the switch; Will-O-Wisp can also be problematic for it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey switches into Mega Houndoom if it's not using Taunt, but if it does, the opposing team can wear it down rather easily; however, Mega Houndoom with Taunt can prevent a weakened Chansey from healing. Also, be aware that Chansey is 2HKOed by Fire Blast in sun with prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Conkeldurr</strong>: Conkeldurr can take hits from Mega Houndoom easily while benefitting from Will-O-Wisp, thanks to Guts. It can easily OHKO Mega Houndoom back with Drain Punch and restore any lost HP.</p> <p><strong>Azumarill</strong>: Azumarill walls Mega Houndoom's STAB moves, and it can setup on Mega Houndoom with Belly Drum. Assault Vest Azumarill takes even less damage from Mega Houndoom's attacks; however, Azumarill still has to be wary of Will-O-Wisp, which will prevent it from doing its job.</p> ",

Fire Blast and Dark Pulse are great STAB moves that have good neutral coverage. Will-O-Wisp is useful against offensive teams and can cripple common switch-ins to Mega Houndoom such as Azumarill, Tyranitar, Terrakion, and Garchomp. It also allows Mega Houndoom to check Bisharp. Taunt can be used to stallbreak, but if it used, Mega Houndoom loses out on the utility of Will-O-Wisp. Hidden Power Grass and Sludge Bomb can be used in the last moveslot to hit Pokemon that otherwise wall Mega Houndoom, such as Azumarill, Keldeo, Terrakion, Tyranitar, Togekiss, and Mega Altaria, though Will-O-Wisp usually cripples most of these, and its utility will be missed. Sunny Day can be used to utilize Solar Power, heightening Mega Houndoom's damage output, but it can be worn down easily; Solar Beam is also easy for an opponent to take advantage of.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EVs allow Mega Houndoom to survive 3 Seismic Tosses from Chansey and Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird. Flash Fire allows Mega Houndoom to switch-into Fire-type moves such as Volcarona's Fire Blast and Mega Charizard Y's Fire Blast, as well as Heatran's Lava Plume. Against Mega Charizard Y's case, a boost can be very important because it gives Mega Houndoom a Solar Power boost meaning it can do a huge amount of damage, while Tyranitar, a common teammate of Mega Charizard Y, is neutered by Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Offensive teams have trouble dealing with Mega Houndoom, so using Will-O-Wisp to target predicted switch-ins is vital to its success. Mega Houndoom can take advantage of stall teams' weakness to Taunt by double switching many times to wear Chansey down with Stealth Rock and then, when Chansey is weakened, Taunting it so that it cannot heal and setting up on it with Nasty Plot.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gengar and Latios make for great teammates to pair with Mega Houndoom. They appreciate Tyranitar being burned so they cannot be reliably Pursuit trapped, allowing them to wreak havoc with Shadow Ball and Draco Meteor, respectively; Earthquake Latios gets a special mention for the ability to eliminate Heatran, a check to Mega Houndoom. Gyarados has excellent synergy with Mega Houndoom and is able to set up on a bunch of switch-ins to Mega Houndoom. Mega Houndoom is also able to deal with Ferrothorn, a Pokemon that walls Gyarados. Starmie, Excadrill, Latias, and Latios can remove hazards and share nice synergy with Mega Houndoom. Toxicroak is an underrated teammate that has plenty of opportunities to spam Gunk Shot against Mega Houndoom's checks and counters such as Tyranitar, Chansey, Keldeo, Unaware Clefable, Terrakion, and Mega Altaria, if expecting a double switch.</p> "

  "Kingdra": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to Swift Swim, Kingdra can outpace the whole unboosted metagame under the rain. Furthermore, Kingdra's decent offensive stats turn it into a great wallbreaker and sweeper, which is amplified by the fact that its Water-type STAB moves are bolstered even further by the rain, and it can also choose to run a mixed set effectively due to its decent Attack. Kingdra also does not stack weaknesses with the rest of its team because it is neutral to Grass- and Electric-type attacks, unlike other Swift Swim Pokemon such as Mega Swampert and Omastar. However, Kingdra has somewhat underwhelming bulk, rendering it susceptible to strong priority moves such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Bisharp's Sucker Punch when weakened. Moreover, rain only lasts for a maximum of eight turns, and Kingdra's reliance on rain for Speed and power makes it easily exploitable outside of it. Kingdra's Special Attack really isn't that great either, especially compared to other Draco Meteor users such as Latios.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Because Kingdra has quite a shallow movepool, it does not have many other options to utilize. Signal Beam has the utility of breaking past Slowbro, Starmie, and Celebi without facing the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor. A set utilizing Sniper, Focus Energy, and Scope Lens allows Kingdra to guarantee critical hits on every single hit, but Kingdra is too slow and easily revenge killed to be able to pull off such a set effectively. Dragon Pulse has more accuracy than Draco Meteor and does not come with the side effect of lowering Kingdra's Special Attack; however, the drop in power is quite noticeable. Hidden Power Fire allows Kingdra to lure in Ferrothorn and KO it; however, the Base Power is decreased in the rain and, aside from Ferrothorn, the move does not hit many relevant targets. Rain Dance allows Kingdra to replenish rain by itself so that it doesn't become overly reliant on Politoed. Substitute allows Kingdra to evade Sucker Punch from Bisharp and status from the likes of Rotom-W and Celebi, but, combined with repeated switch-ins with entry hazards and Life Orb recoil, Kingdra will be on a short fuse. Kingdra has access to Dragon Dance, so it can utilize various items such as Lum Berry and Life Orb in tandem with it to sweep, but it is outclassed as a Dragon Dance user by Mega Charizard X, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Altaria.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ferrothorn: Ferrothorn resists both of Kingdra's STAB moves, takes little damage from Ice Beam, can use Kingdra as setup fodder with Stealth Rock or Spikes, and can wear it down with Power Whip and Leech Seed. However, it needs to watch out for the rare Hidden Power Fire and is crippled by Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Mew, and Slowking can continuously recover off any damage taken from Kingdra and stall out its rain. Chansey is a particularly effective counter to most of Kingdra's sets bar the 64 Atk / 216 SpA / 228 Spe spread because it is not 2HKOed by any of Kingdra's moves and can replenish its health with Soft-Boiled and 3HKO Kingdra back with Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Mega Altaria: Unless Kingdra packs Ice Beam, Mega Altaria is an effective check to Kingdra. Mega Altaria resists Kingdra's Water-type STAB attacks and is immune to its Dragon-type ones. In return, it can heal itself with Roost, use Kingdra as setup fodder with Dragon Dance, or outright OHKO it with Hyper Voice. However, it dislikes Scald burns, especially if it's a Dragon Dance variant.</p> <p><strong>Azumarill</strong>: Azumarill resists Kingdra's Water-type STAB moves and is immune to its Dragon-type ones; Azumarill can then set up on Kingdra with Belly Drum or OHKO it with Play Rough. However, it loathes burns from Scald.</p> <p><strong>Other Weather Conditions</strong>: Because Kingdra is reliant on the rain for its Speed and power, other weather conditions such as sand and sun put Kingdra at a severe disadvantage. However, weather inducers such as Tyranitar and Mega Charizard Y cannot switch directly into Kingdra out of fear of getting 2HKOed by Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Revenge killers and priority users such as Bisharp, Talonflame, and Dragonite can KO Kingdra when it's weakened. Mega Alakazam also deserves a mention, as it can Trace Kingdra's Swift Swim, thus outspeeding it, and KO it with Psychic after some prior damage.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is Kingdra's strongest STAB move, is bolstered by the rain and Choice Specs, and severely dents non-resistant Pokemon. Draco Meteor is Kingdra's secondary STAB move, allowing it to get past Water-, Grass-, and Dragon-types such as Slowbro, Celebi, and Latios, which resist Hydro Pump. Scald can cripple many common Kingdra switch-ins such as Mega Altaria, Ferrothorn, and Azumarill via a burn; the move can also be used late-game to clean up due to its perfect accuracy. Ice Beam takes out bulky Grass-types such as Celebi, as well as Mega Altaria, but it is mostly a filler move, as most Grass-types are hit hard by Hydro Pump or Draco Meteor already. Dragon Pulse is an option to let Kingdra clean up more easily, especially in the face of Pokemon that resist Water, without facing the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given Speed EVs allow Kingdra to outpace Choice Scarf Latios and everything slower in the rain and Jolly base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Bisharp and Breloom outside of rain. Maximum investment into Special Attack ensures that Kingdra hits as hard as possible, and the remaining EVs are placed into HP for some additional bulk. Choice Specs further raises Kingdra's Special Attack and, in tandem with the rain, aids its wallbreaking and sweeping. Swift Swim takes advantage of the rain to double Kingdra's Speed and bolster its Water-type STAB attacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Kingdra should use Scald on switches into Azumarill, Mega Altaria, and Ferrothorn to potentially cripple the foe via a burn. Because of Kingdra's double resistance to Fire- and Water-type moves, it can easily pivot into Pokemon with said moves, such as Heatran and Alomomola. Kingdra greatly appreciates Volt Switch or U-turn support, and it is also best brought into play after a teammate has fainted or by a double switch, as Kingdra's bulk really isn't that great. Kingdra is best used as a wallbreaker, punching holes in the opponent's team early- and mid-game. Hydro Pump is easily the most spammable move because it is the most powerful one in Kingdra's arsenal, as even Pokemon that resist it, such as Mega Venusaur, are 2HKOed in the rain.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Politoed is a mandatory partner to Kingdra because it brings rain to boost Kingdra's Speed and the power of its Water-type STAB moves. Other rain sweepers, such as Tornadus-T, Kabutops, and Omastar, are good partners as well because they also take advantage of the rain; Tornadus-T wears down Ferrothorn and Celebi for Kingdra while providing crucial momentum with U-turn. Kabutops hits physically, allowing it to muscle past specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, which Kingdra struggles against, and 2HKOes Ferrothorn with Low Kick, while Omastar checks Talonflame and cripples Chansey with Knock Off. Setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor, Nasty Plot Thundurus, and Mega Pinsir love Kingdra's ability to weaken the opposing team for a potential sweep by them, and they can also deal with bulky Grass-types. Rotom-W checks Talonflame, Bisharp, Thundurus, and Azumarill, all of which Kingdra dislikes, as Talonflame's and Bisharp's priority attacks deal a hefty chunk of damage to Kingdra, Thundurus can use Prankster Thunder Wave to cripple it, and Azumarill can outright OHKO Kingdra with Play Rough.</p> "

Outrage is a great move to use after Draco Meteor and allows Kingdra to finish off weakened Rotom-W and Celebi after Draco Meteor; however, it comes with the nasty side effect of locking Kingdra into it. Waterfall is a handy option to get past specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and is also an excellent move to use after Draco Meteor because it ignores the Special Attack drops. Ice Beam 2HKOes Grass-types such as Celebi and Chesnaught, as well as Mega Altaria, but it is more of a filler move.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>228 EVs are invested into Speed to outspeed everything up to Choice Scarf Latios in the rain, as well as Jolly base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Breloom and Bisharp outside of it. Maximum investment in Special Attack ensures that Kingdra hits as hard as possible, and the remaining EVs are invested into Attack to power up its physical moves. Life Orb provides Kingdra with an invaluable boost to its offenses and aids its sweeping capabilities. A Rash nature maximizes Kingdra's Special Attack and is chosen over a Mild nature to take priority attacks better. Alternately, an EV spread of 64 Atk / 216 SpA / 228 Spe could be used, which has enough Attack investment to ensure that Kingdra 2HKOes Chansey after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes but comes at the cost of a significant Special Attack drop.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Kingdra is best used as a wallbreaker, working well early-game to punch holes in the opponent's team due to its decent power under rain and great Speed. Kingdra can also be used as a sweeper, but this is rather unnecessary, as it will often be paired up with other rain sweepers such as Omastar and Mega Swampert. Checks and counters such as Ferrothorn and Mega Altaria should be removed prior to Kingdra attempting to sweep. Use appropriate coverage moves to dent or cripple switch-ins, such as Draco Meteor on Mega Venusaur and Scald on Ferrothorn. Because of rain's limited length, one must take advantage of every turn and use it as efficiently as possible. Kingdra has double resistances to Fire- and Water-type moves, so it can easily pivot into Pokemon using said moves, such as Heatran and Rotom-W. However, don't overestimate its bulk, as it is susceptible to entry hazards and Life Orb recoil.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Politoed is a compulsory partner for Kingdra, providing crucial rain support for Kingdra to bolster its stats. Backup rain setters such as Klefki and Thundurus are greatly appreciated as well for their ability to replenish Kingdra's Swift Swim should Politoed faint. Kingdra should be paired up with other rain sweepers such as Mega Swampert, Kabutops, and Tornadus-T; they can weaken Kingdra's checks and counters and appreciate Kingdra's ability to put huge dents in the opposing team. In particular, Omastar forms a great wallbreaking core with Kingdra, as it checks Talonflame and cripples Chansey with Knock Off. Because Kingdra struggles to beat certain Water- and Grass-types, such as Slowking and Ferrothorn, Pokemon that can reliably take them on are good partners. Examples include Mega Heracross and Mega Pinsir, which can deal with them via their Bug-, Fighting-, and Flying-type moves. Mega Manectric and Raikou both fit amazingly into rain teams, boasting the ability to check Thundurus and Talonflame, function outside of rain, use a perfectly accurate Thunder, and provide useful momentum for Kingdra with Volt Switch. Magnezone can trap and KO Ferrothorn outside of rain and also has a perfectly accurate Thunder. Lures to various Kingdra checks are also appreciated, such as Focus Blast Politoed and mixed Thundurus. Rotom-W and Ferrothorn deal with Azumarill and Mega Altaria, respectively, which otherwise causes Kingdra a lot of trouble. Azelf is another great pick, providing Stealth Rock, Explosion to let Kingdra come in safely, and possibly Rain Dance support.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Porygon2 is one of the bulkiest walls in OU with a useful ability in Trace, but it faces tough competition from other walls such as Chansey and Clefable. While it can act as a sponge to absorb strong attacks for its team, its passivity makes it unappealing to some players. Porygon2 is also extremely vulnerable to Knock Off and Toxic, and it lacks Leftovers recovery, all of which make it unreliable. However, it still has some offensive presence and an impressive movepool, which includes Thunder Wave, to support its team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>STAB Tri Attack hits decently hard, but BoltBeam provides better coverage. Magic Coat is also viable, as it can surprise foes that try to Taunt or status Porygon2. Download is an option over Trace if you want Porygon2 to play a more offensive role. Porygon2 can also run a Trick Room set, as its bulk provides ample opportunities for it to set up. Charge Beam is another option, as it helps Porygon2 muscle through some bulky Pokemon, but it is not a very useful move otherwise. Hidden Power Fire can also be used, as it hits unsuspecting Scizor and Ferrothorn for 4x super effective damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Calm Mind Sweepers: Calm Mind sweepers such as Clefable stop Porygon2 cold with their bulk and abilities.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Knock Off users such as Bisharp and Mega Scizor can remove Porygon2's Eviolite, severely weakening its defenses.</p> <p><strong>Swords Dance Sweepers: Swords Dance sweepers such as Excadrill, Mega Scizor, and Bisharp also do not mind Porygon2's attacks and can set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Walls: Chansey and Ferrothorn do not mind Porygon2's attacks and status moves too much, and they can status it or set up entry hazards on it, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Keldeo, Conkeldurr, and Mega Lopunny can break through Porygon2 with their respective super effective STAB moves, but Keldeo and Mega Lopunny have to watch out for Thunder Wave and Toxic.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Beam deals heavy damage to Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Thundurus. Together with Thunderbolt, it forms the BoltBeam combo, which hits almost everything for neutral damage. Discharge is an option over Thunderbolt if the 30% chance to paralyze is desired. However, it can conflict with Toxic, which can be detrimental. Toxic ensures Porygon2 can beat defensive threats with recovery and deal passive damage to more offensive ones. Thunder Wave stops faster sweepers, but it makes Porygon2 helpless against bulky Pokemon such as Cresselia. It's worth noting that Foul Play is a useful move against physical powerhouses such as Mega Metagross and Mega Charizard X.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Trace is the preferred ability, allowing Porygon2 to copy many foes' useful abilities. It can copy Heatran's Flash Fire, Dragonite's Multiscale, Slowbro's Regenerator, and Landorus-T's Intimidate. Eviolite is a must, as it increases both Porygon2's Defense and Special Defense, greatly enhancing Porygon2's walling potential. With this EV spread, Porygon2 avoids the 2HKO from Life Orb Excadrill's Earthquake after sandstorm damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Porygon2 must be cautious of Pokemon with the move Knock Off because without Eviolite, it becomes a burden. Porygon2 has problems against certain Calm Mind sweepers, especially Clefable, so it is best to switch to a teammate against them to avoid being setup bait. When in doubt, use Recover, as Porygon2 must stay healthy to check the threats it needs to. Against offensive Pokemon without recovery, heal with Recover and wear them down slowly with either Ice Beam or Thunderbolt. Finally, switch out against Fighting-types, as their super effective STAB moves will break through Porygon2's Defense.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Clerics such as Clefable and Sylveon make for great teammates because of their ability to heal Porygon2 from statuses and also for their resistance to Fighting-type moves. Entry hazards wear Porygon2 down quickly, so Zapdos and Empoleon also make for good teammates because of their ability to use Defog. Porygon2 also has problems against defensive teams, so having a stallbreaker such as Talonflame or Manaphy on its team is helpful.</p> "

  "Blissey": {
    "overview": "<p>Blissey is mostly outclassed in OU by Chansey, which is bulkier because it can run Eviolite to boost its defenses further. However, Blissey still has a niche in OU even with Landorus and Mega Gengar being banned in that it can reliably counter Manaphy with a Calm Mind set, something that Chansey is incapable of doing. Calm Mind also gives Blissey a better matchup against Gengar, which shuts down Chansey very easily. On top of this, Blissey can also run Leftovers, which can help mitigate passive damage from sand, entry hazards, and status conditions.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Blissey cannot do anything else that Chansey can't in OU anymore. Previously OU Pokemon such as Mega Gengar, Gothitelle, and Landorus are banned, meaning that there is no need for running Shed Shell Blissey or, in the latter's case, Ice Beam Blissey anymore.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Wallbreakers such as Azumarill, Garchomp, Landorus-T, Excadrill, Tyranitar, Terrakion, Bisharp, Mega Pinsir, and Weavile can all put a huge dent into Blissey or remove it easily; however, they fear super effective coverage from Blissey that can usually deal a lot of damage to them. This isn't the case for Tyranitar and Terrakion, though.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types such as Terrakion, Keldeo, Breloom, Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Heracross can easily take on Blissey and remove it with their high-powered STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: If Blissey lacks Flamethrower, common Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Bisharp, Mega Metagross, and Ferrothorn are all capable of beating Blissey, since it cannot do anything back to them while they can set up on or pick off Blissey very easily. Heatran can also wear down Blissey with a combination of Taunt, Magma Storm, and Toxic, preventing Blissey from setting up with Calm Mind and dealing large amounts of chip damage each turn.</p> ",

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This set allows Blissey to counter the likes of Manaphy and Gengar because it can set up with Calm Mind to prevent Manaphy from being able to break Blissey and to gain decent damage output against Gengar. Soft-Boiled is needed for reliable recovery for Blissey to consistently switch into those threats as well as other special attackers such as Thundurus, Serperior, and Mega Alakazam. Thunderbolt hits Manaphy for super effective damage and allows Blissey to almost always beat it one-on-one. Ice Beam has great neutral coverage when paired with Thunderbolt and deals super effective damage to Thundurus and Serperior. Flamethrower can also be used for its ability to hit Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Defense and Special Defense investment makes Blissey as bulky as possible, allowing it to blanket check nearly every single special attacker in the tier. A Bold nature boosts Blissey's low Defense stat further, and a Calm nature is unnecessary because of Calm Mind boosting Blissey's Special Defense anyway. Natural Cure allows Blissey to cure itself of status, which can be very useful if Blissey is hit by Toxic or burned by Scald. Leftovers provides passive recovery and helps deal with passive damage from the likes of sand, entry hazards, and status conditions.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If the opponent has Manaphy on the field, send Blissey in immediately and set up against it with Calm Mind, because if Manaphy is at +3 before Blissey switches in, Blissey cannot beat it. Blissey also works similarly to Chansey in that it can switch into nearly every special attacker in the tier with ease. Calm Mind can even allow Blissey to function as a sweeper when opposing physical attackers have been weakened or KOed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Blissey fits best on stall teams that are very weak to the likes of Manaphy and Gengar, though it can still fit on balance teams reasonably well. Being weak to physical attacks, Blissey needs teammates to cover physically attacking threats, most often physical walls; this is especially relevant on stall teams, which need Pokemon that can deal with almost all offensive threats. Skarmory forms the well-known SkarmBliss core with Blissey, with Skarmory being the physical wall of the duo. While not as effective as it used to be due to a larger number of mixed attackers, it can still function very well with the right support. Hippowdon is a very solid physical wall too; it can take on many physical attackers, phaze foes with Whirlwind, and set up Stealth Rock to wear down the opposing team. Mega Sableye is also a great teammate for Blissey, as it takes on Fighting-types such as Mega Medicham and deters Terrakion and Keldeo from using Close Combat and Secret Sword, respectively.</p> "

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Tyranitar's combination of bulk, typing, and power allows it to check prominent threats such as Latios, Mega Charizard Y, Gengar, and Talonflame. In addition to this, its access to Sand Stream and Stealth Rock makes it a great support threat, as it assists Sand Rush Excadrill and Sand Force Mega Garchomp. Sand Stream itself boosts Tyranitar's Special Defense, meaning it can tank Latios's Draco Meteor with ease. Its great movepool allows it to lure in common switch-ins such as Mega Scizor and Landorus-T and KO them with a coverage move. Tyranitar can also take a role of a sweeper through its Mega Evolution, making it an unpredictable threat. However, while Tyranitar's typing allows it to check specific top-tier threats, Tyranitar is also easy to force out with the plethora of weaknesses it possesses. Even with a Choice Scarf, it is still slow, meaning Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny can easily force it out. Its lack of recovery also makes it easy to wear down.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar can run a physically defensive set, but it does not have a good typing to utilize it. Tyranitar can run a more offensive mixed set with Crunch, Ice Beam, Fire Blast, and Stealth Rock with a Smooth Rock to provide offensive presence while also supporting Excadrill, but there is a noticeable decrease in bulk. Tyranitar can run a Dragon Dance set without Tyranitarite, but it misses a crucial Speed tier and there is a noticeable drop in power. It can work on hyper offensive teams and behind dual screens support because it can get multiple boosts when holding a Lum Berry. The set is rather inferior, however, especially with a huge decrease in bulk. Finally, Earthquake is an option on Choice sets to OHKO Heatran, but it has rather redundant coverage compared to Superpower.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Azumarill, Clefable, and Mega Altaria can take anything from Tyranitar and retaliate hard.

Stone Edge is Tyranitar's main STAB move, doing decent damage to Pokemon that don't resist it. It also allows Tyranitar to force out Mega Charizard Y, which can be a nuisance otherwise, and Tyranitar makes a fine check as long as Tyranitar is wary of Focus Blast. Superpower is a great complementary coverage move, hitting opposing Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, Heatran and particularly Keldeo, which resists Tyranitar's STAB moves. Superpower also allows Tyranitar to revenge kill Bisharp because Tyranitar resists Sucker Punch. Earthquake is an alternative over Superpower to avoid Attack and Defense drops and for better neutral coverage, but it is inferior in almost every other way. Crunch is used in the last slot, as it is a reliable Dark-type STAB move that hits bulky Psychic-types such as Mew, Celebi, Slowking, Mega Latias, and Slowbro. It can also be used to clean teams late-game.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed with a Jolly nature is mandatory to allow Tyranitar to do its job and hit the necessary Speed tier to Pursuit trap effectively. Sand Stream is used for a Special Defense boost, allowing Tyranitar to switch into Latios's Draco Meteor, and it removes other weather conditions such as Mega Charizard Y's sun and Politoed's rain.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As previously mentioned, this set should be used to trap Gengar, Latios, Latias, Starmie, and other Psychic-types Tyranitar forces out. Tyranitar also makes for a great check to Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Thundurus, so use Tyranitar for these threats as well. Finally, Tyranitar can be used as a revenge killer as well because it outspeeds everything up to Starmie and can force out a lot of relevant threats with its STAB moves and coverage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y appreciate Tyranitar's ability to remove Latios and Latias. Teammates that can take on Tyranitar's weaknesses are also great partners, such as Clefable, Celebi, and Gliscor. Stealth Rock support is recommended because it allows Tyranitar to net crucial KOs such as against Latias and Mega Gardevoir and complements Tyranitar's ability to force switches. Ferrothorn and Garchomp are examples of Stealth Rock setters. Excadrill and Mega Garchomp are good teammates due to Tyranitar activating their abilities, but sand turns are limited without a Smooth Rock.

Crunch is the more accurate secondary STAB move and can break past bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro and Jirachi with ease. Superpower has great coverage alongside Stone Edge and Crunch, as it hits Ferrothorn, Heatran, and opposing Tyranitar. Fire Punch is an option to hit Mega Scizor, but it misses out on Heatran and Tyranitar. Pursuit rounds off the set by allowing Tyranitar to Pursuit trap Latios, Latias, and Talonflame. Unlike the Choice Scarf set, Choice Band Tyranitar can also trap bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro, Bronzong, and Cresselia due to the great increase in power. Ice Punch can also be used to hit Garchomp and Landorus-T. Finally, Aqua Tail is a decent option for dealing huge damage to Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Heatran with one moveslot.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment allow Tyranitar to hit as hard as possible. 156 Speed EVs are used to outspeed minimum Speed Mandibuzz, but 76 Speed EVs can be used if Tyranitar only needs to outpace Skarmory. The rest of the EVs are thrown into HP to make Tyranitar as bulky as possible. Sand Stream is crucial to Tyranitar's role as a bulky wallbreaker and Pursuit trapper because the ability gives Tyranitar the Special Defense boost it needs to switch into Latios's Draco Meteor and other neutral and resisted special attacks. 176 Speed EVs can also be run to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Azumarill; meanwhile, fully investing in Speed allows Tyranitar to outspeed Jolly Azumarill as well as most variants of Rotom-W, Mega Venusaur, and Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set should be used as a hit-and-run attacker and to weaken common switch-ins such as Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Due to the notable increase in power, Tyranitar can Pursuit trap bulkier Psychic-types such as Slowbro and Reuniclus. However, faster threats such as Gengar and Starmie can either inflict massive damage or KO Tyranitar. Choice Band Tyranitar's Pursuit also makes it a great trapping tool for Chansey, meaning Chansey can no longer switch into one of Choice Band Tyranitar's most common teammates, Mega Charizard Y. Otherwise, clicking Stone Edge to weaken threats is the preferable path to take early-game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y is an excellent teammate because Choice Band Tyranitar can do massive damage to specially defensive Talonflame and Chansey while eliminating Latios and Latias. Keldeo also fits this category because it can sweep much more easily with Latios and Latias removed. While sand turns are limited without Smooth Rock, Excadrill can be used to sweep after Tyranitar has weakened the opponent's team, especially the common switch-ins previously mentioned such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Rotom-W, all of which wall Sand Rush Excadrill. Other Pokemon that appreciate walls being broken make for great teammates, such as Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gallade. Mega Beedrill, Tornadus-T, and Mega Manectric get special mentions due to their ability to give Tyranitar free switches to wreck havoc with U-turn and Volt Switch. Volcanion appreciates support from Choice Band Tyranitar, as it is a more reliable answer to Mega Latias and still takes on non-Mega Latias and Latios reliably. In return, Volcanion can heavily pressure the Pokemon that can take on Choice Band Tyranitar such as Hippowdon and defensive Landorus-T.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This set focuses on supporting its team even further with the utility of Stealth Rock. Tyranitar makes for a great user of the move due to its ability to threaten Defog users. Pursuit traps Latios and Latias, which allows Stealth Rock to stay on their side of the field for the remainder of the match. Stone Edge is a secondary STAB move that lets Tyranitar KO Zapdos, Mandibuzz, Kyurem-B, and Talonflame. Ice Beam KOes Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. Fire Blast is an option to OHKO Ferrothorn and Scizor, and Crunch can be used for a stronger hit on Slowbro and Celebi. Thunder Wave can also be used to cripple an offensive threat such as Mega Gardevoir. Roar can be used to prevent Pokemon such as Azumarill and Keldeo from setting up on Tyranitar. Finally, Earthquake is an option to allow Tyranitar the ability to check Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given HP and Defense EVs allow Tyranitar to survive an Earthquake from +1 Dragonite and KO back with Ice Beam, assuming Multiscale is not intact. They also allow Tyranitar to take two Dragon Claws from Mega Charizard X after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs are tossed into Special Defense to help Tyranitar take special attacks better, such as Latios's Draco Meteor and Heatran's Fire Blast. Chople Berry allows Tyranitar to survive Alakazam's and Gengar's Focus Blasts and retaliate with Pursuit. This is especially useful considering Tyranitar cannot outpace the former and requires a Choice Scarf to outspeed the latter. Smooth Rock can also be used to maximize the duration of sand and allows Tyranitar to support Excadrill more effectively. Tyranitar can also opt to run Shuca Berry, which can allow it to bait in Earthquake from the likes of Landorus-T and Garchomp and retaliate with Ice Beam.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Using Tyranitar to set up Stealth Rock on Pokemon it forces out such as Talonflame and Heatran is advised. Tyranitar makes for a great user of the move because it beats all the common Defog users. This set can also check threats such as Mega Charizard X and Dragonite in a pinch, so it is recommended to keep Tyranitar healthy if the opposing team has any of these Pokemon. Support Tyranitar can also lure in Ferrothorn and Landorus-T and KO them with Fire Blast and Ice Beam, respectively, making it easier for Excadrill to sweep. Tyranitar also walls Latios, Latias, and Swords Dance Talonflame, and it Pursuit traps the former two.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Excadrill is Tyranitar's best teammate because Tyranitar brings eight turns of sand for it to capitalize on. Celebi is a great partner for sand teams because it takes on Breloom, Azumarill, and Keldeo, which are three Pokemon that trouble sand teams. Talonflame can take bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur, which can annoy Excadrill. Due to Tyranitar's ability to remove Latios and Latias from the game, Keldeo is an amazing teammate because it has a much easier time when they have been removed. Mega Charizard Y also appreciates this, as it can freely wallbreak after they have been eliminated. Latios also makes for a great partner because it checks Keldeo, which can switch in on and wall Tyranitar.</p> "

Stone Edge is the main STAB move for hitting bulky Fairy-types such as Clefable and Mega Altaria and can be used if the extra power it provides is needed. Ice Punch covers Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T, which will try to end Mega Tyranitar's sweep. Superpower hits Steel- and Rock-types such as Bisharp, Ferrothorn, opposing Tyranitar, and Terrakion for super effective damage. However, Crunch and Fire Punch are alternatives to Ice Punch and Superpower. Crunch can hit bulky Psychic-types such as Celebi and, most importantly, Slowbro, which walls the coverage moves. Crunch also does not suffer accuracy issues; for example, a Stone Edge miss can be the difference between winning or losing the game. Fire Punch OHKOes Ferrothorn and Scizor in addition to hitting Skarmory more reliably. Rock Polish can be used as an alternative to Dragon Dance to outpace Mega Lopunny, Weavile, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, but then Mega Tyranitar misses a lot of power even with an Adamant nature.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature are needed to outspeed Weavile, Tornadus-T, and Alakazam after one Dragon Dance. Maximum Attack investment makes Mega Tyranitar very hard to wall after a boost as well. Tyranitarite is mandatory because it gives it a crucial boost to Tyranitar's Speed and, more importantly, its bulk. This means it can set up much more easily and survive priority attacks from Azumarill and Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When grabbing a boost, make sure Mega Tyranitar takes little-to-no damage because it can survive priority moves such as Choice Band Azumarill's Aqua Jet and Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch if healthy. Removing faster attackers is a must before setting up. Excadrill, Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Mega Beedrill are examples of such threats because they can easily cut Mega Tyranitar's sweep short. Necessary walls, such as Rotom-W and Mega Slowbro, should also be weakened.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Tyranitar is walled by Pokemon based upon what coverage move it uses. If Superpower and Ice Punch are used, it is walled by Slowbro, so Celebi is a great teammate. Celebi also walls Breloom, which can OHKO Mega Tyranitar with Mach Punch. If Crunch and Fire Punch are chosen, Mega Tyranitar is walled by bulky Ground-types. Icy Wind Gengar is a great teammate for Mega Tyranitar because Mega Tyranitar can tank a Shadow Ball and lures in specially defensive Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T that think they can set up Stealth Rock. Pokemon that set up Stealth Rock are appreciated because they make it easier for Mega Tyranitar to sweep. Powerful wallbreakers are also welcome because they can defeat Pokemon that wall Mega Tyranitar. Swords Dance Talonflame makes for a good cleaner because it can sweep once Mega Tyranitar weakens its biggest counters: Landorus-T and Gliscor with Ice Punch and Rotom-W with Stone Edge. If running Crunch and Fire Punch, offensive or Choice Scarf Heatran makes for a great teammate because it can do massive damage to Keldeo on the switch and bring it to a point where it can no longer check Mega Tyranitar due to a +1 Stone Edge dealing 50%. Last but not least, Swords Dance Diggersby and Garchomp make for great teammates because they draw in and weaken or KO Mega Tyranitar's checks and counters such as Keldeo, Chesnaught, Slowbro, Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Hippowdon.</p> "

  "Celebi": {
    "overview": "<p>Well-rounded stats and rather unique typing allow Celebi to check prominent threats such as Keldeo, Azumarill, Mega Diancie, Mega Lopunny, Rotom-W, and Mega Slowbro. Celebi has a solid movepool with various means of team support, including moves such as Nasty Plot, Swords Dance, Stealth Rock, and Healing Wish. Celebi's ability, Natural Cure, is yet another means of team support, as it lets Celebi absorb status conditions for teammates. Unfortunately, Celebi is weak to common attacking types such as Bug, Fire, Flying, Ice, and Dark from Pokemon such as Scizor, Heatran, Tornadus-T, Kyurem-B, and Bisharp.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>An offensive set with moves such as Leaf Storm, Hidden Power Fire, Psychic, and Earth Power and either a Life Orb or Expert Belt can be used, but Celebi is much better suited to a defensive role. In a similar vein, a Choice Scarf set can be used to revenge kill boosted sweepers and fast offensive Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Lopunny and provides a fast Healing Wish as well as a bit of a surprise factor. Rest can be used to fully heal Celebi and works in tandem with Natural Cure, but this comes at the cost of vital momentum. Heal Bell can be helpful to remove status conditions from teammates, but Celebi already functions as a status absorber. Leech Seed can be used if you want more recovery than just Leftovers and can be great for whittling down offensive Pokemon that resist Celebi's STAB combination, such as Mega Metagross.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bug-types: If Celebi forgoes Hidden Power Fire or doesn't have multiple boosts up, it will have a tough time defeating Mega Scizor. It has high bulk, reliable recovery, and multiple moves that hit Celebi super effectively, including U-turn, which will always OHKO. Heracross and Mega Heracross resist Giga Drain and can easily OHKO Celebi but dislike being paralyzed by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Talonflame has priority on all of its Flying-type moves and usually carries three attacks that all hit Celebi for super effective damage. If you can predict a Roost and use Earth Power or predict it to switch in and hit it with Psychic, then you have a chance of beating it. Other than that, it's just a miserable matchup. Skarmory can set up entry hazards, phaze Celebi, Taunt it, or simply attack it if packing Brave Bird without the slightest concern if Celebi isn't carrying Hidden Power Fire. Skarmory takes next to no damage from any of its other moves and can simply Roost off any entry hazard or passive damage that it had racked up earlier on in the match. Tornadus-T can switch in freely on a Giga Drain and threatens Celebi with a powerful Hurricane, but it hates being hit with a Thunder Wave. Mega Pinsir 4x resists Giga Drain and deals massive damage with Aerilate-boosted Return. Hawlucha can use Celebi as setup fodder for Swords Dances, and it can avoid a potential Thunder Wave with Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt users such as Gengar, Thundurus, and Tornadus-T prevent Celebi from using its support moves. In addition, all three of these Pokemon resist Giga Drain, but Gengar must be wary of the occasional Psychic, and Tornadus-T is severely crippled by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: If Celebi doesn't run Earth Power, it is brutally beaten by Heatran, as Lava Plume hits Celebi hard. Heatran completely counters Celebi if it is running Air Balloon and can even Roar away any stat boosts. Victini, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y resist Giga Drain and can use Celebi as setup fodder if it is lacking Thunder Wave or Perish Song.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Weavile take minimal damage from Giga Drain and can either Pursuit trap a slower Celebi or deal heavy damage with Knock Off or Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Gengar, Mega Venusaur, and Dragalge resist Giga Drain and can severely dent Celebi with their STAB moves. Unlike the others, Tentacruel takes neutral damage from Giga Drain but damages Celebi on its use with Liquid Ooze.</p> ",

        "name": "Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Giga Drain is a mandatory STAB move to hit the Rock-, Ground-, and Water-types that Celebi checks such as Mega Diancie, Hippowdon, Rotom-W, and Keldeo. Recover replenishes Celebi's health and is essential for its survival throughout the battle when Giga Drain's recovery is not enough. Thunder Wave is a solid choice to cripple common switch-ins such as Mega Metagross, Tornadus-T, Mega Gardevoir, Latios, and both of Charizard's Mega Evolutions. In addition, Thunder Wave prevents Celebi from being setup fodder for some of the aforementioned Pokemon as well as offensive Dragon Dance Mega Altaria. Celebi is an excellent Stealth Rock setter due to its solid matchup versus many opposing Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin users, such as Hippowdon, Terrakion, Excadrill, and Starmie. Alternatively, Healing Wish can be used to revive weakened teammates, particularly setup sweepers. Lastly, Perish Song is an option to put a timer on bulky setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Clefable and Calm Mind Mega Slowbro. Note that Giga Drain and Recover are the only two mandatory moves on this set, and any combination of the other support moves in the last two slots can work perfectly fine depending on your team's needs.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread and a Bold nature maximize Celebi's overall bulk, notably avoiding the 2HKO from Adamant Mega Lopunny's Return after Stealth Rock damage while outspeeding Adamant Bisharp to cripple it with Thunder Wave. A faster EV spread of 252 HP / 148 Def / 108 Spe can be used if Jolly Bisharp is an issue for your team. Using an EV spread of 252 HP / 144 Def / 96 SpD / 16 Spe gives Thundurus a significantly smaller chance to 2HKO Celebi with Life Orb-boosted Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock. Lastly, Leftovers is necessary for passive recovery throughout the match.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set best functions as a glue and pivot for balanced and offensive teams. As such, Celebi should pivot into the Pokemon it checks, such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Diancie, Manaphy, Thundurus, and Keldeo. Use Recover to replenish Celebi's health when necessary and to stall out more Life Orb recoil on foes such as Thundurus. Use Thunder Wave to cripple Celebi's switch-ins for a teammate to finish them off later on. Thunder Wave can occasionally pack a bit of a surprise factor, so try not to reveal it too early on. Be sure to scout for coverage moves from Pokemon that Celebi can typically switch into, such as Hidden Power Bug or Icy Wind from Keldeo as well as Fire Blast from Slowbro.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fire-types such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Charizard partner well with Celebi, as they appreciate Celebi checking bulky Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types. Heatran sets itself apart from other Fire-types in that it also checks Flying-types such as Talonflame and Tornadus-T. Despite sharing a Flying weakness, Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Conkeldurr, and Mega Lopunny check Dark-types such as Bisharp, which are a major thorn in Celebi's side. Setup sweepers in general make for excellent teammates, as they greatly appreciate either Stealth Rock support to wear down their checks and counters or Healing Wish to give them another chance at sweeping. Good examples include Mega Houndoom, Volcarona, Azumarill, (Mega) Gyarados, and Dragonite.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Nasty Plot + 2 Attacks",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Nasty Plot transforms Celebi into a decent threat capable of hitting hard while staying resilient thanks to Giga Drain's STAB and side effect. Recover only adds to Celebi's self-sustainability, giving it a consistent chunk of recovery in situations where Giga Drain's HP drain recovery isn't enough or reliable. Earth Power is preferred in the last slot for better Base Power and neutral two-move coverage; it is extremely effective against Heatran in particular, as well as other Steel- and Fire-type checks such as Bisharp, Mega Metagross, and Mega Charizard X. Hidden Power Fire, while much weaker, allows Celebi to eliminate Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory more efficiently while still maintaining coverage on other Steel-types except Heatran. Alternatively, Psychic can be used as a secondary STAB move, allowing Celebi to hit neutral targets even harder while gaining coverage against Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Talonflame (on the switch). However, it leaves Celebi vulnerable to many Steel-types as well as Dark-types.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread, along with a Bold nature, allows Celebi to outrun Jolly base 70 Speed Pokemon, Bisharp in particular, while giving it as much physical bulk as is allowed. With 252 HP / 148 Def, Celebi can reliably switch into and avoid being felled by common attacks; for example, it avoids the 2HKO from Azumarill's Knock Off and Play Rough, Jolly Mega Lopunny's Return, and Life Orb Excadrill's Iron Head, and it avoids the OHKO from Life Orb Jolly Bisharp's Knock Off and Landorus-T's U-turn. If Celebi runs Hidden Power Fire, then an alternate spread of 252 HP / 144 Def / 112 Spe should be used. Given this set's pivotal nature, Leftovers is essential for passive recovery. Alternative EV spreads with a more offensive nature can be used for an offensive-focused playstyle rather than a defensive one. For instance, a spread of 84 HP / 252 SpA / 172 Spe with a Modest nature lets Celebi outspeed Timid Heatran and provides maximum damage output. More Speed investment with any nature is optional but lessens Celebi's bulk and consequently the number of Pokemon it can reliably check.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>While Nasty Plot may make this set seem fitted for sweeping, this set actually functions as a more aggressive and less passive method of utilizing Celebi's supportive traits. With two attacks in tow, Celebi gains better overall coverage, giving it leverage against its usual counters, such as Skarmory, Bisharp, Heatran, and (Mega) Scizor. Note that Celebi tends to lure these threats in, so with the appropriate coverage attack, it can easily eliminate or severely weaken them. Nasty Plot is used simply to augment Celebi's power, allowing it to be both a great defensive and offensive threat at once whenever required in the battle. As noted in the Set Details, Celebi is able to avoid KOs from a number of attacks, so it has plenty of opportunities to switch into such attacks, Recover the damage off, and set up. Keep in mind, however, that without investment, Celebi requires quite a few Nasty Plot boosts to be remotely threatening to several threats. For instance, Celebi can never OHKO bulkier variants of the aforementioned Steel-types without being at +2, while neutral targets such as Mega Gardevoir, Mega Gallade, Chansey, and Mew require a few more boosts for Celebi to safely 2HKO them or stall with Giga Drain. Additionally, if hard checks or counters such as Weavile, Charizard, or Talonflame are present, it is not recommended to set up Nasty Plot too early lest you instantly lose a good lure and pivot. It is also wise to scout for dangerous moves beforehand, including Hidden Power Bug from Keldeo, Life Orb-boosted Ice Beam from Starmie, and Encore from Mega Lopunny.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Generally speaking, this Celebi set is for teams that appreciate its supportive and pivoting capabilities with an offensive twist. This set tends to perform best on balanced teams; unlike more offensive teams, they tend to not mind Celebi's slower Speed and lack of good coverage, and they usually employ defensive Pokemon that synergize well with Celebi. Heatran is one such Pokemon that is capable of switching into common Bug-, Ice-, and Fire-type attacks while compensating for Celebi's coverage issues with Fire- and Ground-type attacks of its own. Water-types such as Politoed and Rotom-W handle Fire- and Ice-type attacks as well; the former is notable for removing Celebi's Fire-type weakness and supporting other Water-type sweepers (such as Kingdra and Keldeo) with Drizzle, while the latter can provide general utility with Will-O-Wisp and Volt Switch. Celebi's typing and offensive presence also allow it to function well on sandstorm teams, as it can easily switch into Fighting-, Water-, and Grass-type attacks typically aimed at typical sandstorm-based Pokemon and then retaliate with an attack or use Recover to restore health and pivot out. In turn, Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Hippowdon can cover Celebi's usual counters and weak points, especially its tendency to become dead weight or setup bait for the likes of Talonflame, Mega Charizard X and Y, Mega Altaria, and Latias. Moreover, if Celebi opts to run Hidden Power Fire, it can lure in and significantly weaken Skarmory and Ferrothorn, giving Excadrill much more breathing room to sweep without interruption. The luring aspect also benefits non-sandstorm-based attackers, such as Kingdra, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Altaria, Mega Gyarados, Clefable, and Mega Diancie, all of which require certain Steel-types to be weakened or eliminated before sweeping.</p> "

  "Sceptile": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Mega Sceptile may not seem very impressive. For starters, it has bad bulk and a typing that leaves it vulnerable to various priority users including Talonflame, Mamoswine, Weavile, Bisharp, and Mega Scizor. Furthermore, its base 145 Special Attack is relatively average considering Mega Sceptile has to go without a boosting item. Combine this with its lack of a powerful and reliable STAB move, and it's easy to see how most defensive teams don't struggle to handle it. However, Mega Sceptile's niche in OU comes from its ability to handle offensive teams. Its base 145 Speed makes it the fastest Dragon-type available, which is immensely useful in a tier with numerous threatening Dragon-types such as Latios, Latias, Garchomp, and Mega Charizard X, as Mega Sceptile is able to revenge kill all of them, barring Mega Altaria. Additionally, despite Mega Sceptile's relatively average Special Attack, it has access to Leaf Storm, which, thanks to its high Base Power, allows Mega Sceptile to revenge kill frailer threats such as Mega Lopunny. Its Grass STAB move of choice, along with its four times resistance to Water, allows Mega Sceptile to check all of the various bulky Water-type Pokemon in OU, including Slowbro, Manaphy, and Rotom-W. Finally, thanks to its access to Lightning Rod, Mega Sceptile is able to check most of the various Electric-types in OU, including Rotom-W, Mega Manectric, and Thundurus, the latter of which cannot even paralyze Mega Sceptile.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Sceptile boasts a Thunder Wave immunity, an impeccable base 145 Speed, a usable base 110 Attack, and a solid physical movepool. A Swords Dance set set with Leaf Blade, Low Kick / Earthquake, and Outrage / Dragon Claw is therefore plausible. However, it is much less effective than other Dragon-type sweepers, such as Mega Altaria, Mega Charizard X, and Haxorus, and should only be used for its surprise value. Any standard set Mega Sceptile can run leaves it walled by Fairies; Iron Tail can be a good solution. Likewise, almost all bulky Flying-types wall Mega Sceptile; Rock Slide can be used to remedy this problem. On the All-Out Attacker set, Mega Sceptile could use both Leaf Storm and Giga Drain. Leaf Storm is used in scenarios when the power is needed, and Giga Drain is used whenever a consistent STAB move is needed. Going this route forgoes having exceptional coverage against Steel-types and the utility provided by Protect, so it's only recommended if team support renders those unnecessary. If you desire a stronger Grass-type STAB move on the Substitute set, you can use Leaf Storm. It gains many OHKOs and 2HKOs that Giga Drain cannot achieve, such as on Landorus-T, Azumarill, and Mega Manectric. However, it is counterproductive alongside Substitute, as it can't recover HP and forces Mega Sceptile out after use.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Mega Altaria is one of the best counters to Mega Sceptile, as it resists its Grass STAB moves, Focus Blast, and Hidden Power Fire; is is also immune to Dragon Pulse and takes very little damage from Earthquake. It can use Mega Sceptile as setup bait or just go for the OHKO with Return or Hyper Voice. Sylveon can tank a hit and subsequently OHKO with Hyper Voice, potentially through Mega Sceptile's Substitute. Mega Gardevoir can switch into any move bar Leaf Storm and OHKO with Hyper Voice even through a Substitute. Clefable with mixed bulk and a Calm nature avoids the 2HKO from all moves, can use Mega Sceptile as Stealth Rock fodder, and can recover constantly with Wish.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Mandibuzz avoids the 2HKO from Dragon Pulse, can Roost off any damage taken, and can threaten Mega Sceptile with Foul Play and use it as Defog fodder. Specially defensive Talonflame avoids the 2HKO from Dragon Pulse and can OHKO with Brave Bird. Assault Vest Tornadus-T easily avoids the 2HKO from Dragon Pulse and can OHKO with Hurricane. All Togekiss sets counter Mega Sceptile, but offensive sets are especially good for being able to use Mega Sceptile as Nasty Plot setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Select Bulky Steel-types: Klefki can easily switch in on Grass- and Dragon-type moves, take a Hidden Power Fire well, use Mega Sceptile as Spikes fodder, and 2HKO Mega Sceptile with Play Rough. It must, however, be wary of Earthquake. Bronzong takes very little from all of Mega Sceptile's attacks and can do decent damage with Gyro Ball. Specially defensive Jirachi walls Mega Sceptile that lack Earthquake, and Mega Scizor beats all sets lacking Hidden Power Fire. Specially defensive Doublade avoids the 2HKO from all of Mega Sceptile's moves. Mega Metagross can switch in on either of Mega Sceptile's STAB moves and KO in return with Meteor Mash.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Celebi can all switch on any move Mega Sceptile has repeatedly throughout a match and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey: Chansey and Blissey easily switch in on any move Mega Sceptile may possess.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Mega Sceptile's typing and bad bulk leave it vulnerable to priority. Talonflame can revenge kill with Brave Bird while Mamoswine and Weavile can both revenge kill it with Ice Shard. Choice Band Scizor can revenge kill it with Bullet Punch easily, and it can even check Mega Sceptile that lack Hidden Power Fire, as it resists Dragon and Grass. Mega Aerodactyl doesn't have priority, but it outspeeds Mega Sceptile and can revenge kill it with Aerial Ace, Ice Fang, or Stone Edge.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leaf Storm is a very powerful STAB move that lets Mega Sceptile OHKO and 2HKO many Pokemon that its other Grass-type moves cannot. For example, Leaf Storm has a decent chance to 2HKO physically defensive Magic Guard Clefable and OHKO Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Mega Manectric, and Assault Vest Azumarill after Stealth Rock. However, because Leaf Storm tends to force out Mega Sceptile after use because of the Special Attack drop it induces, Energy Ball can be used instead if you want a more consistent STAB move. In addition, Energy Ball does not allow for Pokemon that would otherwise be OHKOed by Leaf Storm, such as Mega Slowbro, to switch in on a Mega Sceptile at -2 Special Attack and abuse the situation. Both moves allow Mega Sceptile to check the bulky Water-types that it's supposed to, such as Rotom-W and Keldeo. Dragon Pulse is a great secondary STAB move that only Fairies are immune to and only Steel-types resist. Additionally, it hits Dragon-type Pokemon super effectively, which allows Mega Sceptile to effectively revenge kill Dragon-types such as Latias and Garchomp. Earthquake can be used to effectively handle Heatran, Klefki, Jirachi, Magnezone, and Tentacruel, and Hidden Power Fire can be used to cover Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. One small problem with Hidden Power Fire is that it forces Mega Sceptile to use a Speed IV of 30, which prevents it from Speed tying with Mega Beedrill.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mega Sceptile's base 145 Speed, Lightning Rod ability, and Dragon typing are all integral to its success in OU, so Sceptile needs to be used with Sceptilite. Maximum Speed EVs with a Speed-boosting nature are used in order to get the most of Mega Sceptile's revenge killing ability; if Mega Sceptile is using a Special Attack-boosting nature it loses out on being able to revenge kill Mega Lopunny and Mega Manectric. Even though Hidden Power Fire drops Mega Sceptile's Speed IV to 30, maximum Speed investment should still be used so that you can at least Speed tie other Mega Sceptile with Hidden Power Fire. A Naive nature is chosen on sets with Earthquake so that you don't drop either of Mega Sceptile's offensive stats. If you're using only Focus Blast for coverage against Steel-types, a Timid nature should be used to prevent any unnecessary hindrance to Mega Sceptile's Special Defense. Maximum Special Attack investment is used to ensure it hits as hard as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Sceptile's base 120 Speed before Mega Evolving is great, but it is not always enough, as it doesn't allow Mega Sceptile to revenge kill Mega Lopunny or Mega Manectric. Thus, it's very important for Mega Sceptile to Mega Evolve early on when playing against offensive teams. One method by which you could bring in Mega Sceptile is with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn; this ensures Mega Sceptile gets in unscathed. After Sceptile Mega Evolves and acquires Lightning Rod, you can have it pivot in on Electric-type attacks from the likes of Thundurus, Mega Manectric, Raikou, and Rotom-W, receive a Special Attack boost, and subsequently begin to use extremely powerful attacks. Do beware that some of these Electric-types may carry Hidden Power Ice, or in Thundurus's case, Hidden Power Flying, which does severe damage to Mega Sceptile. Thanks to its 4x Water resistance, Mega Sceptile can also pivot in on various Water-types, such as Slowbro, Quagsire, Keldeo, and Alomomola, and annihilate them with a STAB Leaf Storm. Again, be aware that some of these Pokemon may carry Ice Beam or Icy Wind, both of which demolish Mega Sceptile. One perk of Mega Sceptile is that, unlike with other fast attackers, you don't have to be cautious when playing against a team with Thundurus, because Mega Sceptile cannot be stopped by Prankster Thunder Wave.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Defensively, Steel-types such as Klefki, Bronzong, and Jirachi as well as Poison-types such as Amoonguss, Dragalge, and Gengar can handle the Fairy-types that Mega Sceptile has trouble with, such as Clefable, Mega Altaria, Togekiss, and Sylveon. Togekiss especially gives Mega Sceptile a hard time, so checks to it, such as Rotom-W and Thundurus, make for good teammates. Mega Sceptile hates Talonflame's priority Brave Bird, so Talonflame switch-ins such as Heatran, Rhyperior, and Rotom-W are helpful. Heatran deserves a special mention for also being able to beat the bulky Grass-types, such as Amoonguss, that Mega Sceptile hates.</p> <p>Offensively, Mega Sceptile makes a good partner for Talonflame as well, as Mega Sceptile beats Rotom-W, Rhyperior, Tyranitar, and Heatran, all Pokemon that counter Talonflame. Gyarados hates Rotom-W for its ability to wall and OHKO it with Volt Switch. Mega Sceptile can OHKO Rotom-W for Gyarados, and if it switches in on a Volt Switch, it will get a Special Attack boost. In return, Gyarados with Bounce beats the bulky Grass-types that Mega Sceptile cannot, such as Amoonguss. As Mega Sceptile struggles greatly against stall, it appreciates powerful wallbreakers to break the walls that it cannot. Choice Specs Sylveon, Choice Specs Dragalge, Swords Dance Diggersby, and Swords Dance Crawdaunt can all help break defensive teams for Mega Sceptile.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute is a great move for using on a predicted switch to a potential check; it greatly eases prediction throughout the match. Substitute also allows Mega Sceptile to evade Bisharp and Mega Absol's Sucker Punch. Giga Drain works extremely well alongside Substitute, as it recovers Mega Sceptile's health and therefore allows it to make more Substitutes. It also hits Water-type Pokemon super effectively, which allows Mega Sceptile to check various Water-types such as Rotom-W. However, it is relatively weak against neutral targets. Dragon Pulse is a great secondary STAB move that hits most targets neutrally while also hitting Dragon-types super effectively, which allows Mega Sceptile to revenge all Dragon-types without a Speed boost bar Mega Altaria, such as Latios and Choice Band Dragonite. On the fourth and final slot you should use Focus Blast, as it hits all Steel-types at except for Doublade at least neutrally, unlike Earthquake, to which Skarmory is immune, and Hidden Power Fire, to which Heatran is immune. However, if you're willing to give up hitting Heatran and OHKOing Bisharp, Hidden Power Fire is viable because it is more accurate than Focus Blast and hits Scizor super effectively.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sceptile needs base 145 Speed, Lightning Rod, and its Dragon typing in order to be viable in OU, so it should be used with Sceptilite. Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment with a Timid nature should be used to hit as hard as possible without sacrificing any Speed. If Mega Sceptile were to use a Modest nature, for example, it wouldn't be able to revenge kill Mega Lopunny or Mega Manectric.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Sceptile is a fast Pokemon; even without having already gained the Speed boost that comes from Mega Evolving, it can revenge kill many Pokemon such as Keldeo, Terrakion, and Latios. However, this Speed is not always sufficient, as it doesn't allow Mega Sceptile to outspeed Mega Lopunny or Mega Manectric on the turn it Mega Evolves. Against teams with these Pokemon, or any Pokemon with a base Speed of 120 or higher, it is very important to Mega Evolve quickly, as not prioritizing Mega Evolving Sceptile could lead to, for example, Mega Lopunny demolishing your team. One method you can use to bring Sceptile in early and safely is a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. After Mega Evolving and acquiring Lightning Rod, Mega Sceptile can switch in on Electric-type attacks from the various Electric-type Pokemon in OU, including Thundurus, Mega Manectric, and Rotom-W, get a Special Attack boost, and subsequently either attack with a very powerful move or set up a Substitute. You should use Substitute whenever the situation calls for it; instead of having to predict whether or not the opponent will switch his or her Pokemon out, and thus possibly costing a game, just use Substitute. The worst that could happen is that Mega Sceptile wastes 25% of its HP; the potential benefit of being protected by a Substitute against a Pokemon that Mega Sceptile can 2HKO far outweighs this risk. When behind a Substitute, Mega Sceptile becomes very hard to deal with for offensive teams, as few Pokemon used on offensive teams can outspeed and/or avoid the 2HKO from Mega Sceptile. Emergency checks to Mega Sceptile, such as Weavile, do not work when Mega Sceptile is behind a Substitute, as Weavile's Ice Shard simply breaks the Substitute and Mega Sceptile can OHKO Weavile with Focus Blast.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fairies such as Clefable, Mega Altaria, Togekiss, and Sylveon all give Mega Sceptile trouble. As a result, it appreciates teammates that make quick work of Fairies, namely Steel-types such as Klefki, Bronzong, and Jirachi and Poison-types such as Amoonguss, Dragalge, and Gengar. Togekiss is especially notable as a nuisance for Sceptile, as it takes pitiful damage from all of Sceptile's moves. Rotom-W and Thundurus both check Togekiss, so they can make for good teammates for Mega Sceptile. Talonflame's priority Brave Bird can stop any Mega Sceptile not behind a Substitute, so Mega Sceptile appreciates the support of Talonflame switch-ins, such as Heatran, Rhyperior, and Rotom-W. Heatran is especially notable because it can beat the bulky Grass-types, such as Amoonguss, that give Mega Sceptile headaches.</p> <p>Talonflame is a great teammate for Mega Sceptile as well. It is stopped cold by various Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Rhyperior, Tyranitar, and Heatran, all four of which Mega Sceptile beats for Talonflame, while in return, Talonflame can break down the bulky Grass-types, such as Mega Venusaur, that Mega Sceptile hates dealing with. Gyarados also hates Rotom-W for its ability to wall and OHKO it with Volt Switch. Mega Sceptile OHKOes Rotom-W for Gyarados, and if Mega Sceptile switches in on a Volt Switch, it gets a Special Attack boost. In return, Gyarados beats the bulky Grass-types, such as Celebi, that Mega Sceptile cannot by using Bounce. As Mega Sceptile struggles greatly against stall, it enjoys having powerful wallbreakers as teammates to break the walls that it cannot. Choice Specs Sylveon, Choice Specs Dragalge, Swords Dance Diggersby, and Swords Dance Crawdaunt can all help break defensive teams for Mega Sceptile.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>By virtue of its good typing that offers a crucial Electric immunity, Mega Swampert is a good Pokemon on rain teams as a Swift Swim user with an immunity to Thunder Wave.

However, Mega Swampert does not get the Swift Swim boost the turn it Mega Evolves, which means it is still quite slow for a turn. It also fails to outspeed common Choice Scarf users such as Keldeo and Latios, even in the rain. Nevertheless, Mega Swampert is one of the most dangerous rain sweepers.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Low Kick can be used over Superpower for more consistent power or if stat drops are unappealing to you. When Mega Swampert is on the verge of fainting, Endeavor can bring down the health of a Pokemon it cannot break for an offensive partner. Substitute circumvents status, eases prediction, and makes Mega Swampert harder to play around. Yawn can shut down some of Mega Swampert's checks, which also aids other rain sweepers. However, it does waste turns of rain which you could also use to attack with Mega Swampert or to switch to another Pokemon. Protect gives Mega Swampert a free turn to Mega Evolve but unfortunately also uses up a turn of rain. Mega Swampert can use Rain Dance in the fourth moveslot if you want another rain setter, or as an independent sweeper outside of dedicated rain teams. A bulkier set with Waterfall, Earthquake, Rest, Sleep Talk and an EV spread of 208 HP / 252 Atk / 48 Spe makes better use of Mega Swampert's respectable bulk and typing while still outspeeding almost the whole unboosted metagame under rain.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Celebi, and Chesnaught have little trouble switching into even an Ice Punch and can threaten Mega Swampert out with their super effective STAB moves or set up Nasty Plot or Spikes. Ferrothorn can also switch in against anything but a Superpower or Low Kick. Frailer ones such as Serperior and Mega Sceptile cannot switch in safely and lose if rain is up, but they can still defeat Mega Swampert outside the rain.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Although not all of them can switch in safely, bulky Water-types such as (Mega) Slowbro, Suicune, Rotom-W, Gyarados, Alomomola, Manaphy, and Gastrodon can threaten Mega Swampert with rain-boosted STAB Water-type attacks. Slowbro and Suicune can also set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Dedicated Physical Walls: Dedicated physical walls such as Skarmory, Cresselia, and Porygon2 can wall Mega Swampert despite lacking a type advantage. Power-Up Punch Mega Swampert can, however, break through them if it has not taken a lot of prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Opposing rain sweepers with higher Speed, such as Kingdra and Kabutops, can revenge kill Mega Swampert with rain-boosted STAB attacks. Very fast Choice Scarf users such as Keldeo and Latios can also outspeed Mega Swampert even in the rain and can deal heavy damage with Hydro Pump and Draco Meteor, respectively. Additionally, Mega Alakazam can Trace Swift Swim and revenge kill Mega Swampert with Psychic or Psyshock if Mega Swampert has been worn down enough.</p> <p><strong>Status: Mega Swampert is immune to Thunder Wave but hates burn and poison because they make it easy to wall and easy to wear down, respectively. Other ways of paralyzing, such as Body Slam and Glare, also cripple Mega Swampert immensely.</p> <p><strong>Other Weather</strong>: Although no weather inducer can switch in safely against Mega Swampert, they can still remove the rain, taking Mega Swampert's Speed away.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Waterfall hits incredibly hard, boosted by the rain and coming from a base 150 Attack. Earthquake is a solid secondary STAB attack and is also Mega Swampert's hardest-hitting attack outside of the rain. Ice Punch hits the Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Mega Swampert's STAB combination, most notably Celebi, Latios, Latias, and Dragonite. In the last moveslot there are two options. Power-Up Punch is not very useful as a coverage move but gives Mega Swampert a way to boost its Attack stat, allowing it to wallbreak more easily. However, Superpower hits Ferrothorn, Mega Gyarados, and Kyurem-B for relevant super effective damage and hits Rotom-W harder than Waterfall does outside of rain. If you cannot fit it somewhere else in your team, Stealth Rock can fill this moveslot.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature makes Mega Swampert hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment allows Mega Swampert to outspeed the whole unboosted metagame, as well as some slower Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Kyurem-B, under the rain. If outspeeding those two Pokemon is less of a priority and you would rather have more bulk, an alternative EV spread of 104 HP / 252 Atk / 152 Spe, which still outspeeds Mega Sceptile and Mega Beedrill, can be used. Though Damp is rarely useful, it is preferred over Torrent as Swampert's ability before Mega Evolving; Torrent is completely useless because Swampert will always Mega Evolve before attacking, while Damp can at least stop an Explosion from the occasional Azelf or Mega Glalie.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Swampert can Mega Evolve for free against common Electric-types that cannot deal significant damage to Mega Swampert, such as Mega Manectric, Thundurus, and Raikou, or against Fire-types such as Victini and non-Solar Beam Heatran, as well as more passive Pokemon such as Klefki, Chansey, and non-Body Slam Jirachi. Try to avoid taking too much damage while Mega Evolving if you rely on Mega Swampert to take on a threat to your team. After the rain is up try to bring Mega Swampert in as soon as possible, as eight turns of rain is not a lot and you want to make the most of it. That does not mean that you should blindly switch it in, however, but instead use pivots or double switches. It can also be more helpful to get entry hazards up first or to send in another Swift Swim user at times. Burn and poison should always be avoided, because they make Mega Swampert easy to wall and easy to wear down, respectively. Late-game is when Mega Swampert works best, as it can clean up after its checks and counters are either gone or weakened. If rain is up, it is almost never a bad idea to click Waterfall, simply because of how strong it is.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Politoed is a mandatory teammate because it can provide rain for Mega Swampert without wasting a turn to do so. It can also create free turns for Mega Swampert with Encore or Perish Song, or by baiting in Electric-types that Mega Swampert can freely Mega Evolve against. Other rain setters such as Klefki, Tornadus-T, Thundurus, and Azelf are also good teammates despite needing a turn to set up rain. At least one other Swift Swim user such as Kabutops, Omastar, or Kingdra is necessary, because with only one Swift Swim user rain teams are not nearly as threatening. Kabutops and Omastar are the best choices, because they can take on Talonflame, which can set up against the obligatory Grass-type teammates rain teams carry. They also help with overwhelming Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Rotom-W, which are often relied on to take on rain offense, better than Kingdra does. Pokemon that can take on the Grass-types that check Mega Swampert, such as Tornadus-T, Talonflame, Thundurus, Latios, and Latias, are also good teammates. Like every Pokemon, Mega Swampert appreciates entry hazard support, because it helps to wear down Mega Swampert's checks and counters. It also helps Mega Swampert score some extra OHKOs and 2HKOs, such as the guaranteed 2HKO with Waterfall against standard Mandibuzz with Stealth Rock and rain up.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Breloom brings sleep and priority to the table, which is what sets it apart from other physical attackers. It possesses enormous utility in Spore, which is essentially a guaranteed cripple on any opponent that isn't Grass-type. Additionally, Technician, when coupled with an amazing Attack stat, lets Breloom utilize very strong Bullet Seeds and provides it with powerful priority in Mach Punch to deal with faster threats. Because of Mach Punch, Breloom stands out as one of the best offensive checks to Bisharp, Rotom-W, Excadrill, Mega Gyarados, and Tyranitar. However, a mediocre Speed stat leaves Breloom vulnerable most of the time against offensive teams, and as a result it is overreliant on Mach Punch on Technician sets. Furthermore, a mediocre STAB combination leaves it unable to threaten many Pokemon, such as Flying- and Poison-types. Its typing is not only average offensively, but it is also quite lacking defensively, as it also leaves Breloom weak to numerous offensive types such as Flying, Fire, and Ice. However, it does resist the EdgeQuake combination. Breloom is also relatively frail and can fall to even neutral hits.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Focus Sash allows Breloom to take a hit and retaliate, patching up its weakness to fast, offensive Pokemon while allowing it to lure in the likes of Talonflame and OHKO them with Rock Tomb. Substitute and Focus Punch allows Breloom to both avoid status and deal a large hit to a switch-in. Natural Gift plus Lansat Berry gives Breloom a one-time 100-Base Power Flying-type attack, allowing it to deal incredible damage to the likes of Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Celebi, which otherwise wall Breloom.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Celebi are immune to Breloom's Spore and resist Bullet Seed. Mega Venusaur is a particularly good counter, as it also resists Breloom's Fighting STAB move and can OHKO back with Sludge Bomb. Similarly, Celebi resists Breloom's Fighting STAB move and can use Breloom as setup fodder for Nasty Plot/Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Talonflame, Tornadus-T, and Togekiss are amongst the best checks to Breloom, as they resist both of its STAB types and can OHKO back due to Breloom's double weakness to Flying-type moves. However, they must watch out for Rock Tomb.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types such as Latios, Mega Metagross, and Mega Gardevoir resist Breloom's Fighting STAB move and, in Latios's and Mega Metagross's cases, its Grass one as well. In return, they can retaliate with a super effective Psychic-type STAB move, which OHKOes Breloom.</p> <p><strong>Gengar: Gengar is immune to Breloom's Fighting-type STAB moves and Facade. Gengar can OHKO back with Sludge Wave and is capable of crippling Breloom with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Certain Fire-types capable of shrugging off Mach Punch, such as Volcarona and Talonflame, are great checks to Breloom. In particular, Volcarona, especially if it carries a Lum Berry, is capable of either outright OHKOing Breloom with Fire Blast or using it as setup fodder with Quiver Dance. However, Rock Tomb OHKOes Volcarona on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Poison-types such as Gengar, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss resist both of Breloom's STAB moves and can KO back with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Because of Breloom's lackluster Speed and defensive stats, faster Pokemon, especially ones that can shrug off Mach Punch easily, such as Alakazam, Latios, and Thundurus, are capable of outpacing and OHKOing Breloom.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Spore provides excellent utility in putting foes to sleep and boasts perfect accuracy. Mach Punch is priority that is boosted by Technician, allowing Breloom to deal with faster threats. Bullet Seed is a secondary STAB move, also taking advantage of Technician, and can break Focus Sash or Substitute. Swords Dance allows Breloom to function as a wallbreaker, and it is especially good in tandem with Mach Punch, as it improves Breloom's overall matchup against offense and balance. Focus Punch is an option to heavily damage Pokemon that switch into Breloom, such as Skarmory and Scizor. Rock Tomb hits Flying-types such as Talonflame, Tornadus-T, and Thundurus on the switch. It also hits various Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, Victini, and Volcarona.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EVs increase Breloom's offensive potential. A Jolly nature allows Breloom to Speed tie with opposing Bisharp and Breloom and the likes of Custap Berry Skarmory as well as Metagross and Modest Gardevoir prior to Mega Evolving; if you run Rock Tomb, it has the added benefit of allowing Breloom to outspeed base 115s such as Starmie and Raikou after the Speed drop. Life Orb powers up Breloom's attacks and makes Mach Punch especially formidable, letting it OHKO the likes of Excadrill and Mega Lopunny. If running Focus Punch, one should opt for an Adamant nature to deal more damage to Pokemon switching in. The utility of Mach Punch is to enable Breloom to deal with faster threats such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Mega Lopunny, and Excadrill, which would otherwise outspeed and deal great damage to Breloom.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Spore is Breloom's best move to use early on, as it cripples anything without a Grass typing or Overcoat. After putting a foe to sleep, Breloom should either use Swords Dance, which allows it to wallbreak effectively, or whittle down the foe with its STAB moves. Swords Dance can also be used after Breloom forces a switch thanks to the threat of Spore. After a Swords Dance, Mach Punch becomes incredibly powerful, allowing Breloom to KO faster foes such as Raikou, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Aerodactyl. Use Focus Punch to damage the likes of Jirachi, Scizor, and Skarmory upon switching in. Bring Breloom in on a resisted hit, such as Tyranitar's Crunch, a double switch, a U-turn or Volt Switch, or after a teammate has fainted, as Breloom has subpar bulk. Against slower setup sweepers such as Slowbro, Reuniclus, and Clefable Breloom should cripple them with a Spore so that it can proceed to either whittle them down with its STAB moves or switch into a teammate that can deal with them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pivots are great partners to Breloom, as they give it free switches. Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, and Raikou procure momentum with Volt Switch and check dangerous Flying-types such as Talonflame, Tornadus-T, and Gyarados. Rotom-W in particular offers a check to numerous Fire-types such as Victini, Infernape, and Talonflame and appreciates Breloom's ability to deal with the likes of Ferrothorn and Quagsire. Tyranitar, Scizor, and Bisharp are good teammates, as they can Pursuit trap Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Latios and Gengar. In addition, checks to Fire-types such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard X, and Volcarona are good partners. Examples include Azumarill and Mega Altaria, which also appreciate Breloom's ability to cripple foes via Spore and beat bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W. Flying-types such as Talonflame and Tornadus-T offer a check to bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Celebi. Tornadus-T also procures momentum with U-turn and appreciates Breloom's ability to deal with Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Rotom-W. Mega Charizard X in particular deals with Steel-, Fire-, and Grass-types such as Scizor, Volcarona, and Celebi that trouble Breloom and appreciates Breloom's ability to break past the likes of Heatran and Rotom-W.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance improves Breloom's matchup against defensive teams, allowing it to break through its usual checks, such as Celebi and Jirachi. Superpower is Breloom's strongest STAB move, allowing Breloom to hit its usual checks such as Skarmory for great amounts of damage. Drain Punch is an option, offering offensive presence and longevity all in one package, but it is significantly weaker than Superpower. Seed Bomb is Breloom's secondary STAB move, hitting the likes of Mew and Landorus-T for neutral damage. Facade hits a sky-high 140 Base Power when poisoned, allowing Breloom to break past Flying- and Poison-types such as Talonflame and Mega Venusaur on the switch, as well as other bulky Pokemon that resist Fighting / Grass coverage such as Celebi and Mega Altaria. Mach Punch patches up Breloom's low Speed stat and allows Breloom to deal with faster threats such as Excadrill, but it is quite weak without a Technician boost.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>12 HP EVs maximize Poison Heal recovery. A Jolly nature in tandem with 252 Speed EVs allows Breloom to Speed tie with opposing Bisharp and Breloom and the likes of Custap Berry Skarmory as well as Metagross and Modest Gardevoir prior to Mega Evolving. The rest of the EVs are invested into Attack for more power. Toxic Orb activates Breloom's Poison Heal, giving it passive recovery and making it immune to other status. Specifically, the utility of having Poison Heal and Toxic Orb is to improve Breloom's matchup against defensive teams, making it capable of boosting in the face of status-reliant defensive Pokemon such as Mew.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Focus on activating Breloom's Toxic Orb as early as possible, as it makes Breloom effectively immune to status ailments. As this set excels against defensive teams, don't be afraid to bring Breloom in against passive, defensive, status-reliant Pokemon such as Alomomola, Suicune, and Mew. Use Swords Dance to boost Breloom's Attack against defensive Pokemon that cannot hurt it, and proceed to sweep. Predict Flying-type Pokemon switching in, such as Tornadus-T, and hit them with Facade, as Breloom cannot otherwise do anything to them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that fare well against offensive teams, such as Mega Manectric, Weavile, and Talonflame, are great partners for Breloom, as they patch up its weakness to faster threats such as Gengar and Tornadus-T. In particular, Mega Manectric offers crucial momentum with Volt Switch and checks powerful Flying-types such as Talonflame and Tornadus-T as well as Steel-types such as Skarmory and Scizor. Weavile checks Tornadus-T and various Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Latios and Gengar, and Talonflame deals with bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, while in turn Breloom deals with bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune, which trouble Talonflame. Checks to Flying-types, such as Tyranitar, are good candidates for teammates. Tyranitar also deals with Psychic-, Fire-, and Ghost-types such as Mega Metagross, Volcarona, and Gengar.</p> "

Aggron also has access to great support moves such as Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave. Unfortunately, Aggron lacks reliable recovery outside of Rest, has a poor defensive typing prior to Mega Evolving, and has a large opportunity cost — by using Mega Aggron, you cannot use other, arguably better, Mega Pokemon.</p> ",

A Rock Polish sweeping set is also an option, although Aggron lacks wallbreaking power, making it a subpar setup sweeper at best.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Defensive Pokemon that don't particularly care about Mega Aggron's attacks are good counters. Hippowdon can effortlessly switch into Mega Aggron, wall it, and beat it with repeated uses of Earthquake. Skarmory and Ferrothorn can shrug off all of Mega Aggron's moves and freely set up entry hazards on it; however, Ferrothorn must watch out for Fire Punch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Mega Slowbro, and Manaphy can sponge just about anything Aggron throws at them and fish for a Scald burn or just slowly wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Pokemon that carry super effective moves, such as Mega Charizard Y with Fire Blast and Thundurus with Focus Blast, can easily take out Mega Aggron.

Heavy Slam is Aggron's STAB move and packs quite a punch even without any Attack investment, thanks to how heavy Aggron is. Avalanche deals lots of damage to Pokemon that would otherwise wall this set, such as Landorus-T and Gliscor, and is used over Ice Punch because Aggron is slower than its targets anyways. Thunder Wave is one of Aggron's best support options; it slows down faster Pokemon, making them easier to check. Fire Punch allows Mega Aggron to counter Mega Scizor while also hitting Ferrothorn, but Earthquake can be used instead to hit Heatran and Excadrill. Rock Slide can be used to hit Flying-types such as Talonflame and Mega Pinsir. Dragon Tail is another option to phaze Pokemon that try to set up on Aggron, while also racking up residual damage if entry hazards are in play.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs and an Impish nature take advantage of Aggron's stellar Defense, while 240 Special Defense EVs are used to patch up its weaker Special Defense. The rest of the EVs are placed into Defense to reach a jump point. Investing more into Defense is also an option to better check physical attackers, but Aggron is already incredibly physically bulky. Investing some EVs into Attack can be done to hit harder, but Aggron's main purpose is to serve as a tank.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Evolving Aggron as soon as possible is crucial, as it is quite useless before that. This can be accomplished through a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, or by sending Aggron in after a teammate faints. Aggron is a great defensive tank, so use it to check dangerous physical attackers such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Metagross, and Mega Altaria. Aggron lacks reliable recovery, so try not to let it get worn down too much.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alomomola can pass massive Wishes to Mega Aggron which helps deal with its lack of recovery, while also being able to switch into Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X and threaten it with Toxic. Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Garchomp make for good partners, as they appreciate Mega Aggron's ability to handle most Fairy- and Dragon-types. Mega Aggron is effective at luring out and dealing with Gliscor and Landorus-T; Pokemon that appreciate these foes gone such as Terrakion are also good teammates. In general, Pokemon that can take on strong special attackers make for solid partners. Chansey is an excellent partner, being able to pass Wishes to keep Aggron healthy, ward off powerful special attackers, and cure status, which neuters Aggron.</p> "

Despite Medicham's immense power, it faces competition with other Fighting-type Mega Evolutions, particularly Mega Lopunny, which has better coverage, Speed, and bulk.

Fake Out grants Medicham a safe turn to Mega Evolve while also dealing chip damage and potentially picking off a weakened foe. Thunder Punch hits bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Mega Slowbro, and Gyarados super effectively. This is crucial given that Slowbro is one of the best Medicham switch-ins in OU. Zen Headbutt is also an option in the last slot as a secondary STAB attack that hits Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Clefable for big damage. Bullet Punch helps Medicham's matchup against more offensively oriented teams while having the added perk of being able to revenge kill Mega Diancie.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Pure Power is what makes Medicham unique, taking its Attack to unparalleled levels. An Adamant nature gives Medicham a chance to OHKO defensive Landorus-T after Stealth Rock damage with Ice Punch, as well as 2HKO Calm Clefable with High Jump Kick on the switch.

Alternatively, a Jolly nature lets Medicham Speed tie with opposing base positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon, such as Mega Gardevoir, Victini, and Mega Charizard Y. Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Medicham to be as fast and strong as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use High Jump Kick with caution, as if it fails to connect, Medicham will lose 50% of its HP; this means Medicham shouldn't use it when your opponent still has a Ghost-type on the field or if you're scouting for Protect on Pokemon such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. If Medicham is running Fake Out, it should typically use it on its first turn out to get off chip damage on the foe and Mega Evolve safely.

It's also walled by Ground-types such as Hippowdon, which also prevent it from using Volt Switch freely, and it only has one set, so it is rather predictable. While Mega Manectric has decent power, it relies on super effective hits to defeat most walls, meaning that it will often be forced to bail out of them with Volt Switch. Overall, Mega Manectric's niche in the OU tier is a solid one, primarily as a threat to offense with a worse matchup against bulkier playstyles.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit Water / Ground types such as Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Mega Swampert, but it provides generally inferior coverage to Hidden Power Ice. Toxic can be run to cripple bulky Ground-types, but Mega Manectric has to sacrifice Thunderbolt or Volt Switch to do this.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types are the most annoying Pokemon to Mega Manectric because they prevent it from spamming Volt Switch. Hippowdon is a notorious Mega Manectric counter that avoids the 2HKO from Hidden Power Ice with a mixed spread. Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Seismitoad all wall Mega Manectric thanks to their typing giving them a neutrality to Hidden Power Ice. Rhyperior is also a hard check, as it also avoids the 2HKO from Hidden Power Ice, but its lack of reliable recovery can let Mega Manectric break past it if it is worn down as the match goes on.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Some Grass-types such as Celebi and Tangrowth are bulky enough to wall Mega Manectric despite its super effective coverage against them. Amoonguss is a check but cannot switch in against Flamethrower very well and has to beware of Overheat. Mega Venusaur is the truest counter of all of these because of Thick Fat.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types resist Mega Manectric's STAB and Fire-type coverage moves, so they are only susceptible to the weak Hidden Power Ice. Latios and Latias are very common checks to Mega Manectric, and both avoid the 2HKO from Hidden Power Ice and can then retaliate or heal up. By virtue of their typing, Mega Charizard X and Kyurem-B are hit neutrally by Hidden Power Ice and can heal off any damage easily with Roost. Mega Altaria is capable of running enough bulk to tank Hidden Power Ice as well, and defensive Dragon Dance sets can use Manectric as setup fodder. Other bulky Dragons like Dragalge, Goodra, and Mega Ampharos can take Hidden Power Ice without much problem and retaliate with powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Raikou is a very prominent check to Mega Manectric, especially if it is holding an Assault Vest. It has a solid Special Defense stat and is hit neutrally at worst by any attack, while it can also use a slower Volt Switch to give the opponent a switch advantage. Rotom-H resists every move Manectric runs, but like Raikou, it is susceptible to being worn down by entry hazard damage throughout the match, making it only a check.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Mega Manectric is very fast, but there are several threats that can outspeed it. Weather sweepers like Excadrill, Mega Swampert, and Kingdra outspeed it under their respective weathers, while Mega Swampert also walls it completely. Mega Alakazam, Mega Sceptile, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Aerodactyl can hit Mega Manectric first with frighteningly strong STAB moves. Relevant Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Latios, Kyurem-B, and Keldeo can also outspeed Mega Manectric, and most can OHKO it, although Keldeo may need a bit of prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon: There are many bulky Pokemon capable of switching into Mega Manectric without taking too much damage. Chansey in particular takes basically no damage from Manectric, while Clefable, Mew, and Sylveon are also capable of switching in and healing up. Heatran and Tyranitar can tank any move from Manectric fairly easily and retaliate. Tyranitar in particular can be annoying for its ability to hit Manectric with Pursuit if it chooses to bail out with Volt Switch.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch allows Mega Manectric to pivot out of unfavorable matchups and ease prediction when the foe also switches out. Thunderbolt is the preferred STAB move when going for maximum power and KOs. A Fire-type coverage move is used to hit bulky Steel-types as well as hit Grass-types harder than Hidden Power Ice; Flamethrower is more consistent than Overheat because it does not miss and does not induce a Special Attack drop, but Overheat is more powerful, netting the OHKO on Mega Metagross and Excadrill, as well as guaranteeing the OHKO on Ferrothorn. Hidden Power Ice completes the BoltBeam coverage, providing a way to hit Ground- and Dragon-types.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature make Mega Manectric as fast as possible, outspeeding threats such as Tornadus-T and Weavile while Speed tying Jolly Mega Lopunny. Maximum Special Attack is used to hit as hard as possible. Lightning Rod allows Manectric to get a Special Attack boost in its pre-Mega forme if it is hit by an Electric-type move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is generally advisable to Mega Evolve Manectric early in the match so that it can utilize its excellent Speed and apply pressure from the get-go. Volt Switch is the move of choice early- and mid-game to soften up the opponent's team and provide yourself with the switch advantage. One should try to identify potential Choice Scarf users on the opposing team and consider hard switching Manectric if faced with one such as Landorus-T. If the opposing team is carrying a significant number of priority moves, limit the number of times Mega Manectric switches into entry hazards so that it can survive these moves late-game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Manectric really appreciates entry hazard support, so Pokemon like Garchomp, Heatran, and Landorus-T all make for fine partners to set up Stealth Rock and tank attacks directed towards it. In a similar vein, Klefki, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn can stack Spikes, which can be deadly in tandem with Volt Switch. Water-, Grass-, and Ice-types are very beneficial to Mega Manectric for their ability to defeat Ground-types that wall it. Keldeo in particular is also able to pressure blanket special walls such as Chansey thanks to Secret Sword, and it also checks Bisharp, which gets a Defiant boost from Mega Manectric's Intimidate. Azumarill is also a great partner because it checks Mega Charizard X, which takes very little damage from Mega Manectric's attacks, while also being an answer to weather-based offense, which Mega Manectric struggles against. Breloom also checks weather-based offense and can use Mach Punch to clean up teams that Mega Manectric has weakened. Many bulky Psychic-types such as Celebi, Latias, and Mew can wall Mega Manectric, so it really enjoys Pursuit support from the likes of Tyranitar, Weavile, Bisharp, and Assault Vest Metagross. Weavile especially synergizes well with Mega Manectric for also defeating Ground- and Grass-types that wall it, while Mega Manectric defeats some of Weavile's best checks in bulky Steel-types such as Mega Scizor. Gengar is also a nice partner for generally pressuring defensive Pokemon that can take hits from Mega Manectric, and Mega Manectric can check Tornadus-T, which is a major annoyance to Gengar. Crawdaunt is a solid partner for many of the same reasons as Azumarill and Weavile. Talonflame can work well with Mega Manectric by overloading similar checks such as Hippowdon and hard checking Clefable, and Mega Manectric can threaten bulky Water-types such as Slowbro in return. Mega Manectric can fit onto rain offense with a powerful Thunder and the ability to pivot to reset weather and threaten bulky Water-types, which are typically annoying for rain. Tornadus-T is also a solid partner, as it forms a VoltTurn core with Mega Manectric and threatens Grass-types, which check or wall Mega Manectric.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Mega Sharpedo is the epitome of a late-game cleaner thanks to a great pre-Mega ability in Speed Boost, access to a powerful STAB Crunch that is bolstered by Strong Jaw, and good coverage moves in Hydro Pump, Ice Fang, and Poison Jab. In addition, Mega Sharpedo has quite a favorable matchup against defensive and offensive archetypes alike.</p> <p>However, Mega Sharpedo is quite frail, and as a result it is susceptible to priority. Reliance on Protect for procuring Speed boosts makes Mega Sharpedo somewhat predictable. Lastly, Mega Sharpedo requires quite a bit of team support to remove certain Pokemon such as Keldeo and Chesnaught.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>All-out attacker Mega Sharpedo makes for a fantastic wallbreaker, owing to the fact that it can run alternate coverage options such as Hidden Power Fire. Zen Headbutt is an option to hit Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, and Breloom. Waterfall allows Mega Sharpedo to hit specially defensive Gliscor and has perfect accuracy unlike Hydro Pump. Scald is a decent option to have the chance to burn switch-ins such as Keldeo and Mega Altaria and cripple them. Aqua Jet can be used to hit weakened Talonflame and Thundurus and pick off Mega Lopunny. Poison Fang can be used instead of Poison Jab if the higher chance to inflict poison is more appealing, but it will consequently have a chance of missing out on 2HKOing Clefable and Mega Altaria. Taunt provides good all-around utility, preventing Pokemon such as Skarmory, Scizor, Mandibuzz from replenishing health, helping Sharpedo avoid being inflicted by status from the likes of Slowbro, and improving Mega Sharpedo's matchup against defensive teams. Destiny Bond is an option to bring down a foe before fainting. Double-Edge can be used to 2HKO Keldeo, but Mega Sharpedo will thus miss the ability to hit Fairy-types and Chesnaught. Substitute allows Mega Sharpedo to evade status and gain more Speed boosts. Hidden Power Fire lets Mega Sharpedo KO Steel-types such as Scizor and Ferrothorn, while Hidden Power Grass nets a super effective hit on Water-types such as Azumarill, Rotom-W, and Quagsire.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Priority Users: Priority users such as Breloom, Conkeldurr, Dragonite, and Talonflame can all deal massive damage to Mega Sharpedo with their respective priority moves. Thundurus and Klefki are also problematic, as they have access to a combination of Prankster and Thunder Wave to cripple Mega Sharpedo immensely.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Bulky Grass-types can usually come in safely against Mega Sharpedo's attacks: Mega Venusaur OHKOes Mega Sharpedo with Giga Drain and takes minimal damage from Crunch; Ferrothorn takes very little from Crunch, deals massive damage with Power Whip, and uses Mega Sharpedo as fodder for Spikes or Stealth Rock; and Chesnaught completely walls Mega Sharpedo, as Poison Jab fails to 2HKO, and in turn can deal heavy damage with Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Mega Gyarados, which resists both of Mega Sharpedo's STAB move and takes minimal damage from Poison Jab and can in turn use Mega Sharpedo as setup fodder for Dragon Dance; Alomomola, which can outstall Mega Sharpedo with a combination of Wish and Protect and cripple it with burns induced by Scald; and Keldeo, which also resists both of Mega Sharpedo's STAB moves and OHKOes back with Secret Sword, are great checks to Mega Sharpedo.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers: Because Mega Sharpedo relies on KOing everything late-game, healthy attackers that are not OHKOed by any of Mega Sharpedo's moves, such as Keldeo and Azumarill, will suffice for checking it.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Protect is necessary for Sharpedo, as it allows Sharpedo to get a guaranteed Speed boost prior to Mega Evolving and can be used to scout the moves of the foe. Crunch is bolstered by Strong Jaw and hits a variety of Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Latios and Gengar for super effective damage while retaining neutral coverage on the likes of Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Hydro Pump covers Ground- and Rock-types, such as Hippowdon, Gliscor, Excadrill, Landorus-T, Mamoswine, Tyranitar, Terrakion, and Mega Diancie, and 2HKOes physically defensive Skarmory. Hydro Pump also nets a neutral hit on other threats that resist Crunch, such as Mega Lopunny, Klefki, and Bisharp. Ice Fang covers a variety of Pokemon such as Mega Altaria, Chesnaught, Dragonite, Hydreigon, Whimsicott, Breloom, and Garchomp. Poison Jab is a great move to hit Fairy-types such as Azumarill, Mega Altaria, and Clefable, as well as Grass-types that resist Dark such as Chesnaught and Breloom. The 30% chance to poison is also nifty for racking up residual damage on Pokemon switching in, such as Keldeo.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Mega Sharpedo to Speed tie with Choice Scarf Landorus-T at +1 Speed. 32 Special Attack EVs let Mega Sharpedo net a 2HKO on physically defensive Skarmory after Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are invested into Attack to bolster Mega Sharpedo's Crunch and Ice Fang or Poison Jab. Speed Boost is the preferred ability before Mega Evolving to let Sharpedo procure Speed boosts, turning it into a terrifying cleaner. The Special Attack investment can be buffed up to 92 EVs to let Mega Sharpedo net a guaranteed OHKO on defensive Landorus-T after Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Sharpedo excels against weakened offensive and balanced teams. Against them, saving Mega Sharpedo as a late-game cleaner is vital. Put as many dents in the opposition's team with teammates, and clean up the remains with Mega Sharpedo once their team has been put in Crunch or any of its coverage move's KO range. This process should be done before Mega Evolving, using Protect to rack up Speed boosts, and then Mega Evolving when the opposition's team can all be outsped. Remove Thundurus and Klefki as soon as possible, as they can cripple Mega Sharpedo with priority Thunder Wave, stopping its sweep. Crunch is Mega Sharpedo's most-used move, as it boasts high power and perfect accuracy.</p> <p>Against defensive teams, Mega Evolving right away is essential to break huge holes in the opponent's defense, unless the Speed boosts from the non-Mega Sharpedo is necessary. Mega Sharpedo can also be used as a supportive wallbreaker for another teammate, for example using Crunch against a Rotom-W switching in, weakening it to the point where it cannot check one of Mega Sharpedo's teammates, such as Talonflame. Look carefully at the layout of the opponent's team, and decide whether Mega Sharpedo should be best played as a supportive wallbreaker or a cleaner. However, Mega Sharpedo has a few problems against these defensive archetypes, so you should pack a secondary win condition for these teams such as Alakazam. If a sweep is possible and multiple Speed boosts need to be procured, bring Sharpedo in on a Pokemon it forces out, such as Gliscor or Hippowdon. Don't Mega Evolve until Intimidate users such as Gyarados have been removed so that Mega Sharpedo can sweep without trouble.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Sharpedo prefers fast, destructive wallbreakers as partners because it fits on offensive teams and needs foes worn down prior to sweeping. Gengar, Talonflame, and Thundurus fit in this category; in particular, Thundurus offers paralysis support and a check to Talonflame and various Fighting-types such as Breloom and Keldeo. Magnezone is a good partner for trapping Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and gives Mega Sharpedo momentum and opportunities to switch in with Volt Switch. Talonflame is a great partner as well, as it can check problematic Fighting- and Steel-types, such as Keldeo and Conkeldurr and Scizor and Ferrothorn, respectively.</p> <p>Physically defensive Garchomp is a great partner for Mega Sharpedo, as the combination of Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin, the phazing with Dragon Tail, and the Stealth Rock it sets wear down attackers such as Mega Lopunny so that Mega Sharpedo has an easier time cleaning up. Similarly, Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes punish switches and wear down the opposition fast, making Mega Sharpedo's job all the more easy; Scolipede makes for an excellent lead, as it can utilize both Spikes and Toxic Spikes and has Endeavor to weaken the foe, especially priority users such as Talonflame. Similar to Scolipede, Skarmory and Klefki can both utilize Spikes to help punish switches, and Klefki has an added bonus of being able to set Reflect and Light Screen to somewhat patch up Mega Sharpedo's lack of bulk and use Thunder Wave to paralyze faster foes such as Mega Lopunny. Celebi checks Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Breloom. Fellow Water-types such as Gyarados, Feraligatr, and Azumarill are also good teammates, as they have good offensive synergy and can weaken Steel-types such as Scizor and Ferrothorn as well as Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Tangrowth for Mega Sharpedo.</p> "

  "Altaria": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Altaria is an impressive anti-metagame threat, boasting a gigantic number of resistances and defensive utility to go along with its already great bulk, thus allowing it to counter and force out a large number of Pokemon in OU. It is no slouch offensively either; in fact, with Pixilate and Fairy STAB, it is deceptively powerful, moreso than established powerhouses such as Azumarill, Mega Gyarados, Mega Gallade, and even Kyurem-B. This is further amplified by Altaria's access to Dragon Dance, as well as a wide physical, special, and supportive movepool, giving it a degree of flexibility and unpredictability.</p> <p>Mega Altaria's only real flaw is its base 80 Speed, which is quite below average by ORAS OU standards, making it somewhat easy to revenge kill even when boosted. It is also occasionally plagued by four-moveslot syndrome; if it lacks a certain move, it can easily be taken advantage of by common checks and counters. Finally, by virtue of being a Mega Evolution, it cannot hold useful items such as Lum Berry, Pixie Plate, Life Orb, and Leftovers, which downplays its overall offense and defense quite a bit. With all that said, don't be fooled into thinking that those cons hold Mega Altaria back in a significant way; it's a downright ruthless Pokemon to face off against.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Without the Altarianite, Altaria is simply not viable or threatening at all, as it misses out on multiple benefits. In other words, don't even think about using normal Altaria in OU. Mega Altaria can utilize a physically based mixed attacking set without Dragon Dance, similar to the special attacking set above. Like said set, it can potentially lure in checks and counters to other sets as well.</p> <p>Haze is a more immediate alternative to Roar and Perish Song, differentiating itself in the fact that it can counter stat-boosting Pokemon, such as Suicune and Mega Slowbro, without forcing Altaria to move last and take a boosted hit. However, its usability ends there because Roar and Perish Song have overall better properties. Likewise, Cotton Guard is undeniably a fun and somewhat useful move, allowing Altaria to win against its usual physical checks such as Scizor, Mega Metagross, Azumarill, Mega Lopunny, and Landorus-T. Unfortunately, it usually wastes a moveslot and doesn't solve Mega Altaria's vulnerability to status conditions and powerful special attacks.</p> <p>Body Slam is a good physical attack that has a high chance of paralyzing foes while having a decent Base Power that is boosted by Pixilate. While it's certainly not a bad move by itself on defensive sets, it has competition with the more powerful Return. Likewise, Facade benefits from any status conditions Altaria might have taken and is absolutely usable on any set that utilizes Return. However, it is overall very situational, not to mention weak and almost useless if the opponent doesn't happen to have a status user at all. Draco Meteor may sound appealing due to its whopping 130 Base Power and Dragon-type coverage (useful against Mega Charizard X and Talonflame in particular), but it is redundant coverage-wise and not much stronger than Hyper Voice, and its side effect makes it an overall unappealing and inconsistent option. Dragon Pulse is more consistent but likewise has redundancy issues. Ice Beam is decent on special attacking sets, as it can OHKO Landorus-T, and specially defensive Gliscor. This particular aspect is important, as KOing these threats immediately lessens the risk of taking heavy damage from Earthquake or, in the case of Gliscor, being stalled out by Toxic or Roost, which it can do if Altaria only has Hyper Voice.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Ferrothorn, Heatran, Scizor, and Skarmory can counter Altaria depending on its lack of Fire or Ground coverage. (Mega) Scizor, especially physically defensive versions, is an exceptional counter if Altaria is lacking Fire Blast. In addition to tanking Fairy-type attacks and Earthquake, it can deal heavy damage with Bullet Punch. Mega Metagross typically revenge kills every set with Meteor Mash or Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Poison-type Pokemon and Coverage Moves: Mega Venusaur is quite possibly the best Altaria counter to exist, as it is never 2HKOed by any of Mega Altaria's commonly used special or physical attacks (even at +2), and can put its efforts to mere waste by recovering with Synthesis or OHKOing it with Sludge Bomb. Amoonguss can perform such similar functions, but struggles against sets running invested Fire Blast or Substitute. Mega Beedrill and Gengar can check unboosted Altaria effectively with their blazing Speed and strong Poison-type attacks; both are especially noticeable for punishing switches with U-turn and Substitute, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types do well defensively against sets lacking Ground or Dragon coverage, but most can't do much in return, so only a select few are notable. Talonflame is resistant or immune to Altaria's most commonly used attacks and can do fatal damage with Brave Bird or cripple Altaria with Will-O-Wisp. Mega Charizard Y sports the same resistances and immunities as Talonflame and can do huge damage to non-defensive sets with its sun-boosted Fire Blast. Heatran sports a quadruple resistance to Fairy-type attacks as well as a slew of disruptive attacks, such as Toxic, Roar, Taunt, and burning attacks, giving Altaria nightmares for ages. Defensive variants, however, tend to struggle against Altaria sets with Substitute or Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fairy-types</strong>: Altaria typically can't do much damage to most bulky Fairy-type Pokemon without accumulating a Dragon Dance boost, and even then some can tank one hit and hit back super effectively with STAB attacks. A special mention goes to Unaware Clefable for ignoring Attack boosts, although it can be 2HKOed by a maxed-out Return or Hyper Voice. Mega Gardevoir is a good check as long as it avoids Dragon Dance-boosted Altaria—or pretty much any physical attack for that matter.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Though not many Choice Scarf users can cleanly OHKO Mega Altaria, common users such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, Icy Wind Keldeo, and Heatran can do enough damage to cripple or KO it after some prior damage. In sandstorm, Sand Rush Excadrill outruns neutral-natured Altaria even at +2 and OHKOes it with Iron Head. Priority users, especially those with Bullet Punch and Ice Shard, also threaten to cut Dragon Dance sweeps short, though most cannot OHKO Altaria due to its bulk. Altaria can also typically handle most priority users by itself. To this extent, Klefki and Thundurus pose threats with their priority Thunder Wave, though this strategy is mostly rendered ineffective by sets with Heal Bell.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance amplifies Mega Altaria's already high Attack and patches up its middling Speed. Return offers sheer power and consistency to go along with great coverage. Earthquake covers all of the Fairy-resistant types, making Steel-, Fire- and Poison-types significantly less problematic, with only a few exceptions. Roost provides reliable recovery, giving Altaria the ability to take damage constantly and check opposing threats more easily, as well as giving it better chances to set up. On the other hand, Fire Blast completes Altaria's coverage, allowing it to lure in Steel-types that wall Altaria otherwise, such as Skarmory, Scizor, and Ferrothorn.</p> <p>There are several alternative moves to consider. Dragon Claw, while redundant coverage-wise with Return, allows Altaria to hit the likes of Talonflame, Mega Venusaur, Mega Charizard X and Y, and Amoonguss harder. Outrage significantly increases the chances of KOing these threats, but it comes with nasty side-effects. Double-Edge is a monstrous alternative to Return, accomplishing KOes that Mega Altaria could not before, such as OHKOing Chansey, uninvested Landorus-T (with Intimidate factored in), and physically defensive Rotom-W after one Dragon Dance boost and Stealth Rock damage. However, the recoil tends to stack up badly, considering Altaria is likely to endure hazard damage and attacks while setting up. Substitute is a neat support move that protects Altaria from status as well as fatal attacks. Finally, Refresh and Heal Bell are alternatives to warding off status, with the former having more PP, allowing it to last longer against persistant status users, while the latter has much less PP in exchange for the ability to support its teammates. Keep in mind that running any other move over Roost makes this set easy to wear down.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An Adamant nature along with significant Attack investment makes the most out of Mega Altaria's physical offense. It is recommended to maximize Speed EVs in order to tie at best with neutral-natured maximum Speed Dragonite as well as opposing Altaria. If desired, the Speed investment can be dropped to 192 EVs, which is enough for Altaria to outrun Choice Scarf Tyranitar after a boost, and the rest of the EVs placed into HP to give Altaria a bit more bulk. A Jolly nature can be used to outrun even more threats before and after a Speed boost, including maximum Speed variations of Breloom, Heatran, Tyranitar, and Bisharp at +0, and Mega Lopunny, Mega Manectric, Mega Beedrill, and Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T at +1. This, of course, comes at the cost of power, which Mega Altaria misses dearly.</p> <p>To take better advantage of Mega Altaria's fantastic defensive typing, you are absolutely free, and even encouraged, to tweak the EVs. Assuming an Adamant nature, its Speed can be lowered to outrun important benchmarks at +1, including 220 Speed for Tornadus-T and Mega Pidgeot, 184 EVs for Raikou and Starmie, and 160 EVs for Thundurus. Transferring some EVs from Attack is also perfectly acceptable in moderation.</p> <p>As this set is crippled badly by burn and other status conditions, Natural Cure is used over Cloud Nine, although the latter still has its uses against weather-reliant Pokemon. For instance, Cloud Nine Altaria avoids the 2HKO from Modest Mega Charizard Y's Fire Blast, giving it a chance to set up and Roost off the damage afterwards.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set usually only requires a single Dragon Dance boost to get going, so setting up more is not recommended, or else Altaria will likely get worn down by more unnecessary damage. This is an acceptable case if Altaria needs to outrun revenge killers such as Mega Beedrill and Choice Scarf users, but be sure it has enough health and opportunities to do so. As this set's bulk isn't particularly outstanding without significant investment, it is best to switch in via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, or after a teammate has fainted. For the same reason, Roost's use should be kept to a minimum, preferably on weak foes or predicted switches.</p> <p>This set can be used at absolutely any time during the battle, whether early-game to punch holes in the opposing team, or mid- to late-game to sweep and clean up after its checks and counters are gone or weakened into KO range. Generally, Mega Altaria should not attempt to sweep if there are revenge killers present, as it can be outsped at +1 and be picked off by priority. If Altaria has Fire Blast, it makes for an effective lure to certain Steel-types early-game; the best way to encourage these foes to switch in is to purposely use the other moves beforehand.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Altaria generally works well on offensive and balanced teams due to its great power, coverage, and sweeping potential. If Altaria lacks Fire Blast, it is recommended to eliminate or weaken Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Scizor, and other similar Steel-types before attempting to sweep. Magnezone easily handles these threats thanks to Magnet Pull, while Keldeo and Heatran are more offensively flexible alternatives for this role that can handle other threats by themselves. Running lures such as Hidden Power Fire Serperior, Jirachi, Latios, Fire Punch Diggersby, Azumarill, Manaphy, and Clefable to weaken these threats is also feasible. Although Unaware Clefable has a decent chance of getting 2HKOed by an unboosted Return, it is problematic regardless. The aforementioned Heatran and Jirachi, as well as Gengar with Sludge Wave, are great checks to it.</p> <p>Keeping Stealth Rock and other entry hazards off the field helps Altaria set up more comfortably both before and after Mega Evolving. Excadrill is a notable Rapid Spinner that is able to maul Fairy- and Steel-types, as well as being a capable sweeper or revenge killer in sandstorm or with a Choice Scarf, respectively. Latias can provide Defog support while possessing good resistances, offense, and, more importantly, Healing Wish, which can be used to give Mega Altaria a second chance to sweep. Latios is similar, but it has Memento instead of Healing Wish to severely lower the foe's offenses for setup. Dual Screens can also be employed, although this strategy is typically used on hyper offense, an archetype that Mega Altaria doesn't exactly fit into.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Return boasts consistency, good single-move coverage, and power on its own even without investment or boosts. The combination of Dragon Dance and Roost allows Altaria to slowly, but safely, become faster and stronger while maintaining its health. This set's playstyle slightly depends on the move being used in the last slot. Heal Bell instantly cures status conditions that Mega Altaria and its team might have contracted while setting up or switching in, and it is especially crucial when considering this set's vulnerability to burn, paralysis, and poison. Substitute blocks status instead of curing it, in addition to scouting and protecting Altaria from dangerous attacks. Earthquake provides additional coverage against Heatran as well as other Fire- and Steel-types, but it leaves Altaria horribly vulnerable to status; it should also be noted that a 2x resisted Return is just as powerful as a neutral Earthquake.</p> <p>Another option to consider is Refresh, which has more PP than Heal Bell and prevents Altaria from losing against exceptionally persistent status users. However, it does not cure status for the entire team and loses out on great utility. Facade can replace Return to take advantage of any status conditions Altaria has taken. However, it is greatly reliant on the opponent having status users in the first place, making it situational and somewhat contradictory with Heal Bell or Substitute.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread along with an Impish nature optimizes Altaria's defenses and is ideal for setting up Dragon Dance. 28 Speed EVs are required to outrun Mega Lopunny and Manectric at +2, and to outrun maximum Speed Azumarill when unboosted. 252 HP / 136 Def / 92 SpD narrowly prevents KOs from some commonly feared, powerful attacks; for instance, Mega Altaria can't be 2HKOed by Choice Band Dragonite's Earthquake, Life Orb Thundurus's Hidden Power Ice, Mega Heracross's Rock Blast, and +1 Jolly Mega Charizard X's Flare Blitz, and it cannot be OHKOed by Jolly Mega Beedrill's Poison Jab and Azumarill's Play Rough. A spread of 252 HP / 180 Def / 76 Spe with a Jolly nature gives enough Speed to outrun maximum Speed Thundurus at +1, but it makes Mega Altaria significantly less bulky. A specially defensive spread is also worth consideration, although Mega Altaria is generally more suited for taking common physical attacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is a hybrid of the support and offensive Dragon Dance sets; it utilizes its bulk and typing to check opposing threats as well as set up multiple boosts safely. While this set is bulky enough to set up on many foes, it is easily checked and walled due to the lack of immediate power and coverage. Therefore, setting up Dragon Dance boosts early-game is not recommended. During this time, however, Mega Altaria can act as an excellent defensive Pokemon that can soak up hits, recover, and hit back hard. After its checks and counters have been either weakened or eliminated mid- to late-game, Mega Altaria can then use Dragon Dance as a win condition.</p> <p>In regards to Dragon Dance, this set requires more than a couple of boosts to really get going. However, with its good bulk and typing in addition to having several status prevention methods, it can set up on many threats with little problem. With Heal Bell specifically, it can confidently set up in the face of defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Thundurus, Chansey, Politoed, Alomomola, Ice Beam-less Slowbro, and both formes of Mega Charizard. Substitute requires more prediction, as Altaria then can't switch directly into status, but it yields great results when used on the opponent's predicted switches. In such a situation, Altaria can choose to either set up or hit the switch-in with Return while behind a Substitute.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Defensively speaking, this set is self-sufficient, only really needing Rapid Spin or Defog support to guarantee survival of the KOs listed in the Set Details. On the other hand, it requires a tremendous amount of offensive support, as it has very limited coverage and power. Assuming it runs mono-Fairy coverage, Altaria definitely needs partners to take care of Steel- and Poison-types, among other foes such as Unaware Clefable. Magnezone can be used to for trap Steel-types, although a backup plan must be made if defensive Steel-types such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn run Shed Shell. Heatran is an excellent partner due to its defensive and offensive synergy with Altaria, using its coverage to take care of all opposing Steel-, Poison-, and Fairy-types while wearing down switch-ins with Lava Plume or Toxic. Likewise, Pokemon such as Latios, Hidden Power Fire Serperior, Fire Punch Diggersby, Choice Specs Dragalge, Dragonite, Breloom, and Superpower Azumarill are great choices, as they can lure in and deal huge damage to the aforementioned threats.</p> <p>Because this set is defensive in nature, it fits better on balanced teams that benefit from its unique set of resistances and don't mind its slow setup. An emphasis on offense is recommended to cover this set's lack of offensive sufficiency and ensure the team isn't entirely reliant on Altaria. Running another sweeper such as Thundurus, Excadrill, Manaphy, Volcarona, or Gyarados ensures there are other options to turn to in case Mega Altaria is unable to sweep. Altaria, in turn, can help these threats out by switching into their counters and providing Heal Bell support.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Roost provides reliable healing, a necessity on a defensive Pokemon lacking Leftovers. The Normal-type move of choice is Mega Altaria's main attack; even without investment, both are consistent and deceptively powerful thanks to the Pixilate boost. Hyper Voice offers special offense, allowing Mega Altaria to check Substitute users and 2HKO physically defensive foes such as Landorus-T, Mega Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Gliscor. On the other hand, Return is generally stronger and can exploit the weaker physical defense of some important threats in the tier; to clarify, the likes of Assault Vest Conkeldurr, Mega Gallade, Mega Gyarados, and Thundurus are all OHKOed after Stealth Rock damage, while Assault Vest Azumarill, Mega Beedrill, Sylveon, and Eviolite-less Chansey are threatened by a clean 2HKO. Heal Bell is a quick fix to status conditions, giving Altaria additional utility and a cleric and status absorber.</p> <p>Flamethrower and Earthquake provide additional coverage, ensuring that Mega Altaria is significantly more self-sufficient and not a sitting duck against certain Steel-types. If the extra coverage is not needed, Roar and Perish Song are support moves that force unwanted switches and counter setup sweepers such as Mega Slowbro, Mega Latias, and Suicune. Toxic is certainly an option for wearing down defensive foes, but it is overall wasteful on a Pokemon that usually attracts Steel-types, Poison-types, and defensive clerics. Finally, Draco Meteor allows Mega Altaria to OHKO Mega Charizard X, turning it into one of the best counters to said threat. Aside from that, however, it wastes a moveslot due to a lack of significant added power and coverage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread, along with a Bold or Impish nature, allows Altaria to avoid being 2HKOed by Icy Wind from Keldeo, sun-boosted Fire Blast from Mega Charizard Y, Earthquake from maximum Attack Adamant Landorus-T, and Psyshock from Life Orb Latios. Alternatively, you can bump the Defense EVs to 132 to avoid being KOed by Azumarill's Play Rough followed by Aqua Jet. Use a Relaxed nature if you plan on using both a special and physical attack (i.e. Hyper Voice and Earthquake, or Return and Flamethrower). If you do, also invest a minimum of 4 Speed EVs to outrun uninvested base 70s such as Skarmory. Cloud Nine is the ability of choice, as it makes switching into Mega Charizard Y, Politoed, Omastar, and other weather-reliant Pokemon much easier prior to Mega Evolving. Heal Bell is a required move even though non-Mega Altaria has Natural Cure, because Altaria typically Mega Evolves immediately.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is a dedicated pivot, capable of switching into numerous attacks and status moves while being able to stand on its own with Roost. Additionally, with Fire Blast or Earthquake, it can avoid being too passive against Steel-types, with the added benefit of being able to lure them in sometimes as well. If Altaria uses Roar or Perish Song instead, however, it plays a little differently. With Roar, Altaria can force unwanted switches and stack up residual damage immediately multiple times. Perish Song is better used on more defensively-based teams, as it acts as a win condition in last-Pokemon scenarios and can afford to be more passive on such teams without encouraging the opponent to switch as frequently. Switch out to a more capable teammate if either move brings out a threatening check or counter.</p> <p>The most important factor is to never overestimate Mega Altaria's bulk and walling abilities, as it lacks Leftovers and can only take so many powerful attacks at a time. To avoid difficult offensive pressure, do not switch into entry hazards frequently, and recover back to full health with Roost whenever you can help it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This particular set is a good fit on balanced teams that require a cleric and a great number of resistances in one package. Mega Altaria can confidently switch into Fire Blast, Lava Plume, Scald, Waterfall, Secret Sword, Thunderbolt, Knock Off, Draco Meteor, and other moves, which makes it an ideal partner to other semi-defensive Pokemon that fear said attacks. Notably, Mega Altaria creates a good core with Heatran, which can handle opposing Fairy-, Poison-, and Steel-types very well. Heatran can also utilize status moves, such as Lava Plume, Toxic, Taunt, and Will-O-Wisp, an area where Altaria typically lacks. Ferrothorn also complements Altaria well defensively, with multiple helpful moves such as Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, and Knock Off at its disposal. Excadrill is a more offensive choice, capable of switching into Altaria's weaknesses with impunity while also offering Ground-type coverage, Stealth Rock, or Rapid Spin support. Choice Specs Magnezone also pairs well with Altaria defensively while providing stellar utility with Magnet Pull, allowing it to trap and eliminate slower Steel-types that are troublesome to Altaria and the rest of its team. Mega Altaria can also find a home on Sandstorm teams, providing resistances to Water-, Grass-, and Fighting-type attacks while being able to cure status ailments for the likes of Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Excadrill.</p> <p>Because this set can force many Pokemon to switch as well as switch out itself frequently, entry hazard control is extremely beneficial. Entry hazard setters such as Skarmory, Tyranitar, and Excadrill are good examples of teammates that can set up hazards quickly and force threats out themselves, depending on your team. As Defog is an issue for this strategy, using Bisharp can keep Defog users in check. As noted in the Set Details, Altaria can switch into and survive a number of 2HKOs, but only if entry hazards are off the field, making their removal necessary. Fortunately, the aforementioned Skarmory and Excadrill, amongst other good choices like Starmie, are able to provide this.</p> "

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Mega Altaria's Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice packs great power, consistency, and coverage, as well as the occasionally handy ability to pierce Substitutes. Fire Blast roasts the many Steel-types that come in to tank Hyper Voice; with the simple combination of these two attacks, Mega Altaria achieves good all-around coverage against nearly every type of foe except for Fire-types. Roost provides reliable recovery, granting Altaria the ability to switch in and check threats multiple times. The last slot comes down to personal preference. Earthquake, despite being uninvested, provides precious coverage against the common Heatran, as well as other Fire-types in general. Heal Bell is an effective supportive alternative; Altaria is notable for being one of the few Pokemon that can viably use it on an offensive set due to its ability to force switches and hit hard.</p> <p>In the realm of supportive moves, Agility and Tailwind can give Altaria a chance to clean up weakened teams (and support its own in regards to the latter); however, Mega Altaria usually doesn't have the sheer power to KO certain foes and pull off consistent sweeps, making it outclassed in such a role. Perish Song and Roar are also notable support moves that allow Altaria to counter certain setup sweepers or force unwanted switches, respectively.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread prioritizes bulk, which is crucial for Mega Altaria to handle threats such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Charizard X, and special attacking power. The Speed EVs allow Altaria to outrun Jolly Azumarill; it is generally advised to invest a bit more in order to outspeed defensive Rotom-W and Landorus-T, which commonly run enough Speed to hit this benchmark. Depending on the team, more Speed can be run; some benchmarks include 240 for Adamant Bisharp (176 EVs) and even max Speed if outrunning Adamant Diggersby and slower base 100s is desired. Another option is 252 SpA / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Timid nature, sacrificing bulk to outspeed certain key threats, including Jolly Mega Heracross, Jolly Bisharp, Adamant Excadrill, Adamant Lucario, and Timid Heatran, as well as tie with opposing base 80 Speed Pokemon such as opposing Altaria, Mamoswine, and non-Mega Gallade.</p> <p>Cloud Nine is the preferred ability, as it gives Altaria a chance to outrun and check Swift Swim Kingdra, Mega Swampert, Sand Rush Excadrill, and other weather sweepers before Mega Evolving. Additionally, this set isn't particularly bothered by status by virtue of being a hit-and-run attacker. If absorbing attacks such as Scald, Lava Plume, and Spore is significant for its team, feel free to use Natural Cure, though keep in mind that Altaria is usually Mega Evolved and can use Heal Bell to achieve such a purpose.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The most important aspect of this set is to focus on pivoting; avoid using it as a sweeper, as it lacks the sheer firepower or Speed to do so (as opposed to the frailer but more fast and powerful Mega Gardevoir and Mega Diancie). Specifically, take advantage of its combination of typing, bulk, coverage, and access to recovery in order to check, counter, or lure in an extensive number of threats in the tier, including but certainly not limited to Mega Lopunny, Mega Gyarados, Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Serperior, as well as Heatran (with Earthquake). If healthy enough, however, it makes a great cleaner after the opponent's special walls have been weakened or eliminated. When applicable, one way to lure in physical walls is to preemptively use Earthquake, which may cause the opponent to think that Altaria is physical and immediately switch in their physical Mega Altaria counter.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Altaria is mostly self-sufficient, focusing on supporting teammates defensively and offensively rather than sweeping itself. The only real offensive support it requires is against specially defensive Pokemon, which usually prevent Altaria from freely tossing out special attacks. As most specially defensive Pokemon besides Chansey and Celebi are usually Fairy-types such as Clefable, Sylveon, and Togekiss, using Steel-type teammates is a good answer. For example, stallbreaker Heatran can trap and weaken Chansey and other special walls with a combination of Magma Storm, Taunt, and Toxic. Ferrothorn can confidently switch into and threaten a number of Fairy-types while providing excellent support with Thunder Wave and entry hazards. Excadrill can flat-out KO these threats with Iron Head while providing either Stealth Rock or Rapid Spin support.</p> <p>Because of its coverage, Altaria is able to lure in and weaken a number of Steel-types such as Heatran with Earthquake while chipping away at other Pokemon with Hyper Voice. This makes Altaria an ideal partner for fast sweepers and cleaners that appreciate such Pokemon gone, such as Talonflame, Dragonite, Gyarados, Latios, Volcarona, and Serperior. Another notable teammate is Calm Mind Clefable; while it may seem odd and impractical to pair two similar Fairy-types together, Altaria is able to lure in and handle troublesome Steel-types, giving Clefable much more breathing room to do its work. Of course, this results in a double Steel- and Poison-type weakness, so additional insurance is required against these two types. Additionally, this Altaria can fit well on typical sandstorm team archetypes due to its resistances to Water-, Bug-, Dragon-, Fighting-, and Grass-type attacks. In this case, it can be partnered up with Hippowdon or Tyranitar, which provide a good defensive backbone as well as Stealth Rock support, and especially with Sand Rush Excadrill, a deadly force that synergizes extremely well with Altaria offensively and defensively.</p> "

  "Crawdaunt": {
    "overview": "<p>Crawdaunt is a true powerhouse and a terrifying wallbreaker thanks to Adaptability and its sky-high Attack stat. It has very powerful STAB moves in the form of Knock Off and Crabhammer, which are very hard to switch into. Additionally, Swords Dance and Aqua Jet give Crawdaunt a great cleaning tool and can somewhat fix up its poor Speed. Crawdaunt also has an excellent matchup against slower defensive teams, as they struggle to take boosted hits. However, Crawdaunt does have numerous flaws; it has low Speed, which is only slightly remedied by Aqua Jet, and is extremely frail, struggling to take even resisted hits, making it very hard to set up or switch in safely.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Waterfall can be used over Crabhammer for better accuracy, but the decrease in power is usually not preferred, as Crawdaunt is a wallbreaker. Running a Focus Sash makes Crawdaunt harder to revenge kill and makes setting up with Swords Dance easier. It also allows Crawdaunt to pretty much net a guaranteed KO against offensive teams, provided its Focus Sash is not broken.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth are all capable of taking on Crawdaunt. Mega Venusaur in particular is a very reliable answer as it easily survives a +2 Knock Off and OHKOs Crawdaunt in return, meanwhile physically defensive variants of Tangrowth can also survive a +2 Knock Off provided Stealth Rock is not on the field. However, Mega Venusaur does risk getting 2HKOed by Choice Band-boosted Crunch after Stealth Rock. Amoonguss struggles against boosted Crawdaunt but takes it on fairly easily if Crawdaunt hasn't boosted. Chesnaught can also take on Crawdaunt due to its very high physical defense and resistance to both of Crawdaunt's STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Mega Altaria: Mega Altaria resists both of Crawdaunt's STAB moves while being able to set up on Crawdaunt with Dragon Dance or just KO it with either Return or Hyper Voice.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulkier Water-types such as Rotom-W, Azumarill, and Keldeo can switch in on resisted STAB moves and either proceed to KO Crawdaunt with their respective STAB moves or, in Rotom-W's case, cripple it with a burn.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Faster Pokemon such as Latios, Keldeo, Breloom, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Manectric can come in after Crawdaunt KOes a Pokemon and proceed to force it out. Priority users such as Talonflame can also outprioritize Crawdaunt's Aqua Jet.</p> ",

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance can boost Crawdaunt's Attack to insane levels, allowing it to severely dent or KO even Pokemon that resist its attacks. Crabhammer is Crawdaunt's most powerful STAB move, being able to 2HKO maximum HP Azumarill, as well as easily KOing many neutrally hit Pokemon. Crawdaunt sets itself apart from other wallbreakers thanks to its immensely powerful STAB Knock Off. Not many Pokemon resist Dark-type attacks, and very few of them appreciate having their item knocked off. Aqua Jet is also a must on Crawdaunt, as it patches up Crawdaunt's low Speed and can often be used to sweep a weakened team. Crunch is another option to do more damage than Knock Off to Mega Venusaur, but the power and utility provided by Knock Off will definitely be missed.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Adaptability is the reason why Crawdaunt is such a powerful and efficient wallbreaker, and it's what gives Crawdaunt its niche. 252 Speed EVs combined with a Jolly nature allow Crawdaunt to outspeed many common defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, defensive variants of Heatran and Landorus-T, and Mega Venusaur. An Adamant nature can also be used to hit harder, but Jolly is definitely preferred. Maximum Attack EVs increase Crawdaunt's damage output, making it harder to wall. A Life Orb is the preferred item, as it increases Crawdaunt's Attack while also allowing it to change moves, making it much harder to wall.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Crawdaunt is extremely frail, so only bring it in on weak resisted moves, after a teammate faints, or with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. Using Crawdaunt is pretty straightforward; simply select the appropriate STAB move and watch the opposing Pokemon lose their item and take heavy damage in the process or simply get KOed. Crawdaunt is a wallbreaker, so use it to punch major holes in the opposing team so that a teammate has an opportunity to sweep. Crawdaunt excels against defensive teams but struggles against more offensively oriented teams; wait until the opposing team is weakened enough and Crawdaunt may be able to get an opportunity to sweep with Aqua Jet. Bring in Crawdaunt against a Pokemon that it forces out, such as Heatran, and either set up a Swords Dance or just directly nuke the Pokemon that switches in. Usually after Crawdaunt has taken out a Pokemon, it is best to let it get KOed, as switching it out loses momentum.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Talonflame is a great partner, being able to destroy Crawdaunt's main counters, such as Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur. Latios can also defeat Crawdaunt's counters, while also being able to remove entry hazards that may trouble Crawdaunt. Like most wallbreakers and setup sweepers, Crawdaunt appreciates entry hazard support. Klefki and Ferrothorn can both set up Spikes, with the latter also being able to set up Stealth Rock. Momentum grabbers such as Rotom-W, Celebi, and Landorus-T are appreciated to help Crawdaunt switch in. Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X appreciates the removal of Heatran and Slowbro, while Dragon Dance Mega Altaria appreciates Ferrothorn and Skarmory being weakened. Crawdaunt can also weaken Keldeo's main counters, namely Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Azumarill and the combination of the two can heavily pressure Mega Venusaur.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off is Crawdaunt's main STAB move, crippling whatever takes the hit by removing its item. Aqua Jet allows Crawdaunt to compensate for its low base Speed as well as revenge kill a few notable threats from full HP, namely Excadrill and Mega Diancie. In addition, Aqua Jet is capable of KOing the likes of Weavile, Tornadus-T, and more after a bit of prior damage due to Crawdaunt's raw strength. Crabhammer is Crawdaunt's most powerful STAB move and is easily capable of 2HKOing most Pokemon that resist it. Crunch is a secondary Dark-type STAB move that doesn't lose out on power when the target no longer has an item. Furthermore, Crunch also nails Mega Evolutions, which don't take increased damage from Knock Off. Mega Venusaur is a prime target of Crunch, and it's generally advised that one anticipate obvious switches to it and act accordingly. Finally, should Ferrothorn be a concern, Superpower may be worth running over Crunch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack investment maximizes Crawdaunt's damage output, allowing it to wallbreak to its highest potential. 252 Speed EVs in tandem with a Jolly nature put Crawdaunt at 229 Speed, which enables it to outspeed most Rotom-W and defensive Landorus-T. A Choice Band combined with Adaptability boosts Crawdaunt's wallbreaking power to insane levels; even Pokemon that resist its moves will commonly find themselves being 2HKOed. Should more breaking power be desirable, one can opt for an Adamant nature to improve Crawdaunt's matchup versus bulkier teams.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Given that Crawdaunt is a frail and slow wallbreaker, Volt Switch and U-turn support to bring it in safely is ideal. Double switches accomplish similar things but are generally more risky. Be sure to utilize Knock Off early-game to cripple whatever has the misfortune of switching into Crawdant, as it not only is extremely powerful but also has utility in removing the target's item. Since Crawdaunt excels versus defensive builds as opposed to offensive ones, playing a more prediction-heavy style may be needed to maximize Crawdaunt's effectiveness when facing more offensive builds. For example, Crawdaunt may be better off using Knock Off against an opposing Sand Rush Excadrill as opposed to Aqua Jet, as Aqua Jet is assumed to be the move of choice in that scenario and does little to any Pokemon that resist Water.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As previously mentioned, the key to maximizing Crawdaunt's effectiveness is through Volt Switch and U-turn support from bulky pivots. Examples of these teammates include defensive Mega Scizor, Jirachi, Landorus-T, Assault Vest Tornadus-T, and Rotom-W. In respect to partners that directly help cover weaknesses, one will need to consider teammates that can deal with the likes of Keldeo, Azumarill, bulky Grass-types, and Fairies. Amoonguss is capable of dealing with Keldeo and Azumarill, both of which resist Crawdaunt's STAB moves and threaten it greatly. Talonflame in particular works well alongside Crawdaunt offensively, as it can check Keldeo, Grass-types, and Fairies such as Mega Altaria (defensive variants virtually completely block Crawdaunt). Because it can greatly threaten most Grass-types and Keldeo, Latios or Latias makes for a solid addition to Crawdaunt teams and can possibly provide Defog support to builds running Talonflame alongside Crawdaunt. Heatran is capable of scaring out most threatening Grass-types, namely defensive Mega Venusaur and Serperior, while providing Stealth Rock support. Assault Vest or Life Orb Tornadus-T can also threaten Grass-types well with its Flying STAB moves and additionally can bring Crawdaunt in via U-turn. Any Pokemon that enjoys common Crawdaunt switch-ins being weakened works well, so anything that wants the likes of Keldeo, Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and physically defensive Tangrowth gone is an ideal partner that can form a potent offensive duo with Crawdaunt. Swords Mega Scizor and Mega Gyarados are good examples; Mega Scizor appreciates Keldeo being weakened, while Mega Gyarados loves having Keldeo, Ferrothorn, and other bulky Grass-types crippled for its sweeps. Mega Charizard X appreciates Crawdaunt's generally wallbreaking capabilities, namely versus Slowbro and the bulky Ground-types that stop its sweeps. Since Crawdaunt mainly threatens slower, bulkier builds, it naturally pairs well with teammates that are capable of threatening more offensive builds, such as Talonflame, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Manectric.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Metagross was blessed with a Mega Evolution that possesses many key traits that make it a prominent threat in the OU metagame. Its great ability, Tough Claws, boosts contact moves' power by 30%, which pairs very well with its great movepool. Furthermore, Mega Metagross has a great typing and stellar all-around bulk, which provides it with numerous opportunities to switch in. Finally, Mega Metagross's offenses are great; its high Attack stat coupled with its blazing Speed tier makes it a very fast, hard-hitting tank. However, Mega Metagross's base Speed before Mega Evolving is subpar at best, and despite its impressive typing, it's difficult to justify switching it into Pokemon it can counter such as Mega Gardevoir and Clefable since they often carry moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave that completely cripple it. Despite these flaws, Mega Metagross is able to capitalize on its strengths very well, which enables it to put pressure onto its foes when played correctly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The combination of Substitute and Power-Up Punch lets Mega Metagross use weaker defensive Pokemon as setup bait, as they are usually unable to break Mega Metagross's Substitute. Substitute on the All-out Attacker set gives Mega Metagross a buffer against status effects and makes it harder to revenge kill, but it must forgo a valuable coverage move to fit it onto its set. Hidden Power Fire enables Metagross to bypass an otherwise solid counter in Mega Scizor, but it has no use outside of that and is very weak. For example, it is unable to 2HKO standard Ferrothorn or specially defensive Skarmory.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Skarmory and Mega Scizor both are able to take on Mega Metagross quite easily, as they are able to take Hammer Arms and whittle Mega Metagross down with their moves. Bulky Mega Scizor is particularly dangerous because it can use Metagross to set up Swords Dance and is not 2HKOed by any of its moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Slowbro, Slowking, and Suicune are all fine checks to Mega Metagross. Slowbro and Slowking in particular can cripple Mega Metagross with a Scald burn or Thunder Wave, but both find themselves heavily pressured by Thunder Punch variants. Suicune is a similar case, only fearing Thunder Punch and otherwise uses Mega Metagross to set up Calm Mind. Rotom-W is also a decent answer, as it's only threatened by Zen Headbutt after prior damage and can cripple Mega Metagross with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types: Hippowdon, Garchomp, Quagsire, Landorus-T, and Gliscor are able to take Mega Metagross's STAB moves. However, Hippowdon and Quagsire lose to Grass Knot, while Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T lose to Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Choice Scarf Tyranitar is capable of outspeeding Mega Metagross and, with prior damage, is capable of knocking it out with a super effective attack. Life Orb Bisharp is capable of OHKOing Mega Metagross with Sucker Punch after minimal prior damage. Mandibuzz is able to take on any attacks that Mega Metagross throws at it and defeat it with Foul Play, but Stealth Rock cannot be on the field.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types: Physically defensive Mew and Cresselia are able to wall most variants of Mega Metagross that lack Substitute. Mew is able to cripple Mega Metagross with a Will-O-Wisp. Cresselia is also able to wall Mega Metagross, as despite it not having a way of doing any meaningful damage to it, Cresselia is capable of crippling it with a Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Tangrowth and physically defensive Celebi are able to take any hit Mega Metagross throws at them, including Ice Punch, and either cripple it with Sleep Powder or Thunder Wave or simply wear it down throughout the match. They must watch out for Attack boosts from Meteor Mash, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Life Orb Weavile, Overheat Mega Manectric, Sand Rush Excadrill, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Choice Specs Raikou, Life Orb Starmie, and Life Orb Tornadus-T carrying Heat Wave are able to outspeed and either knock out or severely cripple Mega Metagross with super effective or hard-hitting moves.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Meteor Mash is Mega Metagross's primary STAB attack and hits Pokemon that don't resist it exceptionally hard. Zen Headbutt is the preferred move in the second slot to hit targets such as Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Mega Venusaur for big damage. Thunder Punch is also a solid option in this slot to net super effective damage on Skarmory and bulky Water-types like Slowbro. Hammer Arm hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Heatran for super effective damage and receives a Tough Claws boost, but Earthquake can be used instead to hit Heatran harder and, notably, to hit Mega Charizard X, Victini, Jirachi, and opposing Mega Metagross super effectively. The last slot rounds off Mega Metagross's coverage. Ice Punch is the top choice as it is Metagross's only way to reliably KO defensive Garchomp, and it has the notable advantage of also hitting Landorus-T and Gliscor for major damage. It also has great neutral coverage alongside Thunder Punch. Bullet Punch is great for revenge killing faster Pokemon, but the loss of a coverage move is often not worth it. Pursuit is another great option for Mega Metagross to support its team. It enables Mega Metagross to remove problematic Pokemon for its common partners to facilitate a sweep later on in the game. For example, Mega Metagross is often paired with Keldeo, and it is able to Pursuit trap common answers to Keldeo such as Celebi, Latios, and Latias, as it naturally checks them. Furthermore, Pursuit is great for getting chip damage on forced switches, such as Mega Gardevoir and Choice Specs Raikou locked into Hidden Power Ice. Should Pursuit be run, however, be wary of the loss of coverage. Lastly, Grass Knot is a somewhat niche option for dealing a significant amount of damage to Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Quagsire, though hitting these specific threats is generally not worth the loss in coverage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment in tandem with a Jolly nature capitalizes on Metagross's offensive capabilities. Alternatively, an Adamant nature can be used for more power, but the inability to outspeed metagame staples such as Keldeo and positive-natured Mega Charizard Y makes it an inferior option most of the time. A Naive nature is also an option if Grass Knot is used, but the loss of special bulk can be troublesome during matches, and the power increase is isn't always necessary.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Metagross is a great check to many prominent Fairy-types in the tier such as Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Azumarill, although each one has a way of crippling Mega Metagross should it be played recklessly. Mega Metagross's primary role is to punch holes into opposing teams, so bringing it in against defensive Pokemon that are unable to touch it is advisable. Similarly, switching Mega Metagross into resisted hits is a great way to get it into play.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that are able to defeat Mega Metagross's most prominent checks, such as Skarmory, Jirachi, and Mega Scizor, are heavily appreciated. Talonflame, Keldeo, Choice Specs Magnezone, and Heatran are good options for this role. Manaphy and Choice Band Azumarill are great wallbreakers that are able to break through Mega Metagross's checks and thus make for good teammates. On sets lacking Grass Knot, good partners include Will-O-Wisp Talonflame, Swords Dance Landorus-T, and Swords Dance Terrakion because they wear down Hippowdon, Garchomp, and defensive Landorus-T. Mega Metagross appreciates entry hazards to ensure certain KOs that it would otherwise be unable to achieve, so Stealth Rock setters such as Garchomp and Heatran make for good partners. Latias is an excellent teammate for Mega Metagross because she can provide Mega Metagross with a second life with Healing Wish.</p> "

        "name": "Rock Polish",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rock Polish enables Mega Metagross to outspeed the entire metagame after a boost. Meteor Mash is Metagross's obligatory Steel-type STAB move and has a decent chance to raise its Attack by one stage. Should accuracy pose a concern, Iron Head is a viable alternative. Zen Headbutt is needed to power through Rotom-W and other Pokemon that resist Steel, and it sports a decent flinch chance that pairs well with Mega Metagross's high Speed. Ice Punch is needed to be able to break through defensive Garchomp, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Gliscor, while Hammer Arm is useful for breaking through Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Heatran. Alternatively, Earthquake nets super effective hits on Jirachi, Victini, and Mega Charizard X, but it is otherwise inferior to Hammer Arm, despite the latter move's Speed drop.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack investment enables Mega Metagross to hit as hard as possible while still hitting the very important base 110 Speed benchmark. Should speed not be as critical, an alternative EV spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe with an Adamant nature allows Mega Metagross to outspeed neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon before a Rock Polish boost and everything relevant in the metagame after a boost. Clear Body aids in the process of setting up against Intimidate users.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Early-game, use Mega Metagross to break down walls or revenge kill slower Pokemon. Then, when it is time to go for a sweep late-game and Mega Metagross's checks and counters have been sufficiently weakened, bring Mega Metagross in on Fairy-types that it forces out to gain a free turn to set up. However, be wary of Thunder Wave Clefable and Will-O-Wisp Gardevoir. Holding off on Mega Evolving allows Metagross to bypass Intimidate users that try to lower its Attack stat. Setting up before Mega Evolving isn't too difficult, as Metagross still possesses a decent Speed tier after a boost and is still quite bulky.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that are able to defeat Mega Metagross's most prominent checks, such as Skarmory, Jirachi, and Mega Scizor, are heavily appreciated. Talonflame, Keldeo, Choice Specs Magnezone, and Heatran are good options for this role.

Mega Metagross appreciates entry hazards to ensure certain KOs that it would otherwise be unable to achieve, so Stealth Rock setters such as Garchomp and Heatran make for good partners.

        "name": "Assault Vest",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Pursuit allows Metagross to trap Psychic-types such as Alakazam, Latios, Latias, and Celebi, and Meteor Mash is Metagross's most powerful STAB move and has decent neutral coverage. Bullet Punch is necessary to allow Metagross to pick off weakened Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Gengar, Latios, Latias, Mega Gardevoir, Terrakion, and Tornadus-T. Earthquake has good coverage alongside Meteor Mash, allowing Metagross to hit Pokemon such as Heatran, opposing Metagross, Magnezone, and Jirachi and preventing it from being setup bait for Mega Charizard X. Zen Headbutt can be used to allow Metagross to deal extra damage to Pokemon such as Keldeo, Talonflame, and Mega Venusaur. Hammer Arm is another option that still hits Heatran but also allows Metagross to threaten Spikers such as Ferrothorn and specially defensive Skarmory, which both use Metagross as setup bait. Ice Punch can be used to deal extra damage to Garchomp and Landorus-T, but it isn't usually worth the loss of Meteor Mash, Zen Headbutt, or Hammer Arm.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP and 96 Special Defense EVs prevent Mega Alakazam's Shadow Ball from 2HKOing Metagross even after Stealth Rock damage. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack to help Metagross hit as hard as possible. Assault Vest allows Metagross to easily switch into Fairy- and Psychic-types and threaten them with Meteor Mash or Pursuit. Clear Body lets Metagross avoid stat drops from the likes of Mega Manectric and Landorus-T. 8 Speed EVs can be run to outspeed standard Belly Drum Azumarill.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Metagross should be used as an offensive switch-in to the likes of Latios, which Metagross can Pursuit trap easily, as it avoids the 2HKO even from Hidden Power Fire variants. If you predict Latios to stay in, use Meteor Mash instead, which puts it in KO range for Bullet Punch. Metagross should also be used to offensively check Fairy-types such as Clefable and Mega Gardevoir, though this is riskier, as they can heavily cripple Metagross with Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp. Metagross is also a good offensive answer to the likes of Mega Alakazam, as it can switch into any of its moves, with Shadow Ball being unable to 2HKO Metagross, and trap it with Pursuit + Bullet Punch. However, Life Orb Alakazam is capable of 2HKOing Metagross.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Assault Vest Metagross performs best as a tank on offensive and balance teams, as it easily switches into the Pokemon that threaten these playstyles. Pokemon weak to Psychic-type moves such as Mega Venusaur and Keldeo appreciate Metagross's ability to trap Psychic-types for them, while Keldeo can check most Ground- and Fire-types that trouble Metagross. Landorus-T can handle the Pokemon that threaten Metagross such as Garchomp, opposing Landorus-T, and Excadrill. It can also run Hidden Power Ice, which makes handling Garchomp and opposing Landorus-T easier. Garchomp punishes physical attackers such as Bisharp and can run Fire Blast to scare off Skarmory and Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Common Pokemon on balance or offensive teams such as Hippowdon, Slowbro, Ferrothorn, Clefable, Azumarill, Landorus-T, and Latias can all find themselves heavily pressured by Mega Gardevoir, so they all appreciate Metagross being able to switch in and force it out or OHKO it. Metagross also appreciates Thunder Wave support from Clefable, as it slows down threats such as Kyurem-B, Mega Lopunny, and Heatran, which makes it easier for Metagross to pick them off, and it appreciates Hippowdon walling threats that can overwhelm it such as Bisharp, Mega Charizard X, and non-Swords Dance Excadrill. Metagross also functions as an alternate Pursuit trapper compared to Tyranitar or Bisharp, as it still supports Pokemon such as Thundurus, Keldeo, and Mega Charizard Y in addition to being able to switch into common Fairy-types, unlike the two Dark-types. Metagross also offers very solid role compression for offensive teams, as it beats Latios and also checks Mega Venusaur very well, so it works well with the likes of Keldeo, Thundurus lacking Psychic or Hidden Power Flying, and Breloom. It also works well alongside Ferrothorn, Dragalge, Skarmory, and Hippowdon, as it can help keep heavy entry hazard pressure on the opposing team by removing common Defog users such as Latios and Latias. Pairing Metagross with other Pokemon that can Mega Evolve such as Gyarados, Scizor, Alakazam, Latias, Tyranitar, and Slowbro provides a lot of surprise factor and can force your opponent to play guessing games, which can affect the outcome of the game if they expect Mega Metagross over any of the other Mega Evolutions.</p> "

  "Latias": {
    "overview": "<p>Latias's typing along with solid bulk makes it a great offensive check to a variety of OU threats, including Keldeo, Breloom, Manaphy, and Mega Manectric. This defensive utility, coupled with access to Defog, makes it an excellent choice for both offensive and balanced teams. On top of that, Latias's Mega Evolution is incredibly bulky, allowing it to serve as a reliable choice for support on defensive teams. Latias's main issue is that outside of its Mega Evolution and Healing Wish, it is almost entirely outclassed by Latios, which brings far more power to the table. It also finds itself walled by common Fairy-types, such as Azumarill, Mega Gardevoir, and Clefable, as well as Steel-types such as Klefki, Ferrothorn, and Scizor. Although Latias's Psychic typing brings a useful set of resistances, it also brings a weakness to Pursuit trappers, which access to Reflect Type can help nullify.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Latias's offensive movepool is fairly varied, carrying moves such as Surf, Earthquake, Grass Knot, and both Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Fighting. However, it faces heavy competition from Latios in an offensive role, as Latios's superior firepower makes it the favored choice. Because of this, however, Latias is able to lull typical switch-ins into a false sense of security and lure them more effectively. Colbur Berry is an option to halve the power of a Dark-type move, granting Latias a way of escaping Pursuit trappers once without taking too much damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Ferrothorn, Heatran, Excadrill, Mega Metagross, Klefki, and Scizor resist Latias's STAB moves and can easily set up against it. Mega Scizor is particularly threating because it can use Mega Latias to set up Swords Dance and uses Recover to restore any lost HP as it sets up. Excadrill is also notable due to the fact that it's immune to Thunder Wave. However, both Excadrill and Heatran must watch out for Surf, as it threatens to 2HKO or 3HKO depending on their EV spread. It's also worth noting that Ferrothorn loses to Mega Latias's Calm Mind set if it's running Reflect Type.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Weavile, are all immune to Latias's Psychic-type STAB moves and are able to deal heavy damage back to it, though Bisharp and Weavile must be wary of directly switching in due to the threat of Thunder Wave and Draco Meteor. All of them also have access to Pursuit, which can KO Latias even if it tries to switch out. However, Mega Latias can evade being Pursuit trapped if it carries Reflect Type.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Azumarill, Clefable, Mega Diancie, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Altaria, and Sylveon are immune to Latias's Dragon-type STAB moves and are able to threaten it back with super effective attacks. However, Mega Gardevoir doesn't appreciate being paralyzed by Thunder Wave on the switch and Azumarill fears Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Priority attackers, Choice Scarf users, and naturally faster Pokemon can be huge threats to Latias. Be on the lookout for Mamoswine, Toxicroak, Scizor, Talonflame, Kyurem-B, and Landorus-T, as these Pokemon commonly carry priority moves or Choice Scarf. Naturally faster threats include Scolipede, Mega Beedrill, Mega Lopunny, and Tornadus-T.</p> ",

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind gives Mega Latias a way to boost its already good Special Attack and Special Defense stats further and become a very threatening wincon. Recover is used in the next slot to keep Mega Latias alive as it boosts and consistently take hits from the likes of Keldeo and Thundurus. The rest of its moveset is very customizable based on what the team needs. Psyshock is a STAB move with decent immediate power that gives Mega Latias the ability to deal physical damage. It is Mega Latias's best option for taking on the likes of Keldeo before boosting, which is especially useful if Mega Latias is not using Thunderbolt, and helps it win Calm Mind wars against Pokemon such as Clefable because it does not take into account the target's Special Defense. Stored Power is an alternative that has very low initial power but hits incredibly hard after several boosts and turns Mega Latias into a massive threat. It has the added bonus of breaking through Unaware users like Quagsire and Clefable due to its increased Base Power after every boost, something Unaware can't negate. Surf provides great coverage alongside Latias's Psychic-type STAB move due to its ability to deal large sums of damage to several Pokemon that would otherwise wall Mega Latias like Tyranitar, Heatran, specially defensive Excadrill, and Bisharp. Thunderbolt is another option that helps Mega Latias revenge kill the likes of Manaphy, Azumarill, and Volcanion while providing neutral coverage on most of the same Pokemon as Surf, and it is especially useful for hitting Water-types like Keldeo hard right off the bat if Mega Latias opts for Stored Power over Psyshock. It also helps to break Calm Mind Slowbro and Slowking with more ease than any of Mega Latias's other options because it hits both of these super effectively, and to discourage Mega Gyarados from setting up.</p> <p>Dragon Pulse can be used over Surf or Thunderbolt and is a decently powerful move with good neutral coverage on most Psychic-types and Dark-types in the tier while also dealing good damage to opposing Dragon-types, but it leaves Mega Latias easily taken advantage of by the many prominent Steel-types in OU such as Heatran, Mega Scizor, and Skarmory. Substitute and Refresh are additional options to help Mega Latias manage status and, in the case of Substitute, Pursuit better, but they force Mega Latias to run a mono-attacking Psyshock or Stored Power set, which leaves it as bait for the tier's Dark-types. Additionally, Reflect Type is an option in the final moveslot to help against Pursuit trappers and to set up more easily on Pokemon like Heatran and Ferrothorn, but it struggles to be effective for the same reasons as Substitute and Refresh: being forced to run single-move coverage. Reflect Type sets are also unable to reliably shield themselves from status, as in order to be immune to Toxic Mega Latias must first use Reflect Type on a Steel- or Poison-type Pokemon, and in order to be immune to burns Mega Latias must first use Reflect Type on a Fire-type Pokemon, and so on.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Calm Mind Mega Latias is a defensive sweeper, so maximum HP investment is used to make it take hits as comfortably as possible while setting up. Mega Latias has a great Speed tier, so maximum investment with a Timid nature is vital to take full advantage of it. This lets it outspeed threats like Terrakion, Keldeo, Garchomp, and Mega Pinsir while tying with Gengar, opposing Latias, Latios, and Mega Diancie. Latiasite is the chosen item to let Latias Mega Evolve and get a gargantuan boost in both Defense and Special Defense, making it much more effective as a Calm Mind sweeper.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Latias does not need to boost every time it is sent out. Pivoting Mega Latias in and out on the attackers it checks like Volcanion, Keldeo, Thundurus, and Mega Charizard Y while dealing some damage to its checks and counters as they come in with its Psyshock, Surf, or Thunderbolt is generally best as long as the opponent is capable of stopping a Mega Latias sweep. Sometimes it is also best to just Recover off the damage from the attackers that Mega Latias walls as they switch out so that Mega Latias does not get too worn down and put in the KO range of hits like Keldeo's Icy Wind or Thundurus's Hidden Power Ice. Being badly poisoned or paralyzed is extremely crippling for Mega Latias, the former leaving it unable to sweep effectively and the latter leaving it easily revenge killed, so it is best to avoid these status conditions at all costs. Burns are also frustrating for Mega Latias, forcing it to use Recover much more often and thus reducing how effective it is at carrying out its job. When boosting with Calm Mind, make sure not to boost more than is necessary to win the game. The more Mega Latias boosts, the more likely it is to be struck by a critical hit, potentially ending a sweep before it begins. Without Reflect Type or Substitute, this set is very vulnerable to Pursuit trappers, so it is important to be wary of Pokemon that commonly run Pursuit like Weavile and Tyranitar. The latter becomes significantly more deadly if equipped with a Choice Band, always 2HKOing Mega Latias with Pursuit even if it does not attempt to switch and OHKOing if it does.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Mega Latias set is best as a wincon for balanced and bulky offensive teams that appreciate the defensive utility it brings to the table. Many of its partners appreciate its ability to check powerful attackers like Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, Volcanion, Thundurus, Tornadus-T, and Mega Manectric while checking some of the Pokemon capable of halting a Mega Latias sweep. Gliscor can be a good partner, as it poses a threat to Clefable, Bisharp, and Mega Diancie while absorbing status for Mega Latias thanks to Poison Heal. Fighting-types like Terrakion and Keldeo are good partners as well for their ability to check threatening Dark-types like Bisharp and Tyranitar. Terrakion has the bonus of taking advantage of Pursuit trappers with Justified, especially when holding a Choice Band, while Keldeo can reliably switch into Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Weavile and also checks Mega Scizor. Suicune threatens Pokemon like Weavile, Mega Scizor, and Bisharp while being able to phaze them with Roar if they attempt to set up and absorb status with Rest. Clefable can check Pokemon like Kyurem-B, Mega Diancie, Latios, and Weavile while spreading paralysis to many of their shared checks like Jirachi and Bisharp with Thunder Wave. Skarmory and Ferrothorn check threats like Mega Diancie, Mega Gardevoir, and Latios while setting up Spikes to wear down several Pokemon like Tyranitar and Bisharp that check Mega Latias. Skarmory has the advantage of handling Weavile, Bisharp, and Mega Scizor, while Ferrothorn can check Choice Band Azumarill.</p> <p>Heatran is a viable partner that can beat Ferrothorn, Clefable, and Mega Scizor while setting Stealth Rock and is able to take Will-O-Wisp and Toxic for Mega Latias. Zapdos checks Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Mega Pinsir, and Jirachi while more reliably checking Life Orb Tornadus-T and providing Defog support. Tyranitar is another Pokemon that partners well with Mega Latias due to it checking Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, and opposing Latios and Latias. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Tyranitar also becomes able to check Mega Gardevoir, revenge kill Bisharp with Superpower, and Pursuit trap Gengar. Sand Rush Excadrill with Sand Stream support brings offensive presence to the table in the form of a dangerous revenge killer capable of taking on threats like Mega Diancie, Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, Kyurem-B, and Weavile for Mega Latias and as such is a fantastic choice for a partner. Hippowdon can check Mega Charizard X, Bisharp, and Mega Lopunny while also setting Stealth Rock to wear down the opposing team. Amoonguss alleviates some pressure from Mega Latias to take on Keldeo + Pursuit cores and checks Choice Band Azumarill, Mega Altaria, Clefable, and maximum Special Attack variants of Mega Diancie, and it can help to halt a Mega Gyarados sweep with Spore. Finally, Choice Scarf Landorus-T is a partner with offensive presence that provides a way to revenge kill various physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Mega Metagross, and Jirachi for Mega Latias while grabbing momentum for the team with U-turn.</p> "

        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Beam and Thunderbolt complement each other's coverage excellently, allowing Mega Latias to hit almost everything in the tier for neutral damage. They also let it threaten common Pokemon on balance, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, Skarmory, and non-Calm Mind Slowbro. Recover allows Mega Latias to heal itself and reliably check opposing threats throughout the match. Reflect Type changes Mega Latias's typing to match its foe's, allowing it to fare better against Ferrothorn and Heatran while also allowing it to escape Pursuit from Bisharp and Tyranitar. Thunder Wave cripples most offensive Pokemon while annoying slower ones with the chance to skip their turn. Calm Mind turns Mega Latias from a support Pokemon into a bulky wincon that is able to wall most attackers after a couple boosts.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and a Timid nature allow Mega Latias to Speed tie with opposing Latias, Latios, Mega Metagross, and Gengar while outrunning Keldeo, Terrakion, and slower threats. Maximum HP investment allows Mega Latias to tank hits as well as possible. An alternative spread of 248 HP / 68 Def / 192 Spe lets Latias outspeed positive-natured base 100s, such as Mega Charizard Y and Manaphy, as well as outrun maximum Speed Jolly Garchomp. Latiasite drastically improves Latias's bulk, improving its longevity and allowing it to take hits it usually wouldn't be able to, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Pursuit.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Latias's typing and incredible bulk allow it to switch in on and check many offensive threats, including Keldeo, Breloom, Thundurus, Manaphy, Mega Manectric, Mega Charizard Y, and Rotom-W. When pivoting in and out, use Recover on predicted switches in order to keep Mega Latias healthy and to avoid having it be KOed by the Pokemon it's hoping to check. Sets running Reflect Type or Thunder Wave are typically used for their support abilities, being able to switch in on and check threats. Calm Mind sets, on the other hand, are wincons, so you'll want to play more carefully with Mega Latias. Try to remove or weaken problematic Pokemon, such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn, before you start setting up. When playing against Tyranitar, identifying which set it is running can be a huge deal, as certain sets are much more threatening to Mega Latias than others. Support Tyranitar, for example, is often unable to do much to Mega Latias, while Choice Scarf sets cannot beat Mega Latias if it stays on the field as Tyranitar uses Pursuit. Choice Band Tyranitar, however, is always a danger for Mega Latias, so identifying and removing it grants Mega Latias much more freedom.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Latias forces plenty of switches, so it appreciates entry hazard support to take full advantage of them. Teammates such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn are able to set Spikes and Stealth Rock and they have good synergy with Mega Latias as well. Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Conkeldurr, Cobalion, and Infernape are all able to beat Steel- and Dark-types for Mega Latias, while Mega Latias in turn can take on bulky Water-types that these Pokemon despise. Clefable and Mega Latias make for a potent duo, as they share counters that can be crippled by Thunder Wave, such as Jirachi and Mega Metagross. Having these Pokemon paralyzed by one teammate allows the other to boost with Calm Mind much more easily. Mega Latias is forced out by Fairy-types, so Pokemon that can beat them such as Jirachi, Heatran, Excadrill, and Amoonguss can make for excellent partners.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Defog",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Latias's most powerful attack, able to deal heavy damage to most Pokemon that don't resist it. Psyshock gives Latias a consistent form of damage output, allowing it to deal with Keldeo, Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Breloom while giving it a way to hit Fairy-types. Healing Wish allows Latias to remove all damage and status from one of its teammates, but it causes Latias to faint upon using it. Defog removes all entry hazards from the field, whereas Recover provides Latias a way of healing itself, granting it more staying power. Thunderbolt can be run over Psyshock, giving Latias a harder hit against Manaphy, Mega Charizard Y, and Azumarill while maintaining coverage on Keldeo. However, Latias will not be able to beat Mega Venusaur or Amoonguss.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The HP investment prevents Latias from being 2HKOed by Life Orb Thundurus's Hidden Power Ice, while 252 Speed and a Timid nature allow it to outrun Keldeo and Terrakion and Speed tie with Latios, Gengar, and other Latias. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack in order to give Latias more offensive power. Life Orb serves to improve Latias's damage output, with a slight cost to its health. If Thundurus isn't an issue, a spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe can be run to maximize Latias's offensive presence.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Latias is able to switch into Pokemon such as Keldeo, Manaphy, Thundurus, Mega Charizard Y, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss and check Breloom, Mega Manectric, and Rotom-W. Bear in mind that many of these Pokemon are commonly paired with Pursuit trappers, so be wary of a double switch or Volt Switch as Latias comes in. Defog should be used when you need to remove entry hazards from your own side of the field, but be aware if your opponent has a Bisharp or Thundurus because Defog triggers Defiant, which could prove dangerous. When running Recover, look for opportunities to use it against Pokemon that can't threaten Latias, as this will allow it to stay healthy throughout the match. When running Healing Wish, wait to use it until Latias is no longer needed or until a crippled teammate would be more useful to have healthy again. Using Healing Wish too early leaves the team without an answer to several potent attackers, so it's best to wait until they have been dealt with before getting rid of your answer to them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, Breloom, and Mega Heracross are able to beat Dark-types like Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Weavile for Latias. Fire- and Ground-types such as Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, Landorus-T, and Garchomp can help deal with Steel-types. Steel-types like Jirachi and Metagross are able to beat Fairy-types. In return, Latias provides a switch-in for bulky Water-types that these Pokemon typically dislike going up against. Fairy-types like Azumarill, Clefable, and Mega Gardevoir are able to beat opposing Dragon-types, which can heavily damage Latias. Setup sweepers appreciate Latias's ability to heal them up to full via Healing Wish, as this allows them to exert pressure early on without worrying about being crippled. Offensive powerhouses such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Swords Dance Mega Scizor, Tail Glow Manaphy, Swords Dance Talonflame, Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X, Swords Dance Bisharp, and Serperior can all take advantage of Latias's support.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Latios resides in a great Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed and check many threats such as Garchomp and Keldeo. In addition, it has a great Special Attack stat, coupled with an extremely strong move in Draco Meteor, making it a great sweeper. It is versatile in the roles it fulfills because it has tons of utility and support moves in its arsenal such as Memento, Tailwind, and Defog and doubles as one of the best offensive Defog users in OU. Furthermore, a decent defensive typing allows Latios to comfortably absorb hits from the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Keldeo and, as a result, gives it ample opportunities to switch in. However, Latios is weak to the ubiquitous Knock Off and Pursuit, which is amplified by the increase of Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Steel-types such as Mega Metagross. Latios also resides in a crowded Speed tier and thus has to rely on Speed ties with opposing base 110s such as Mega Diancie and Gengar. Finally, it has underwhelming bulk, rendering it open to revenge killers and faster Pokemon such as Talonflame and Tornadus-T.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A lead set with Light Screen and Reflect is decent for offensive-natured teams because Latios has high Speed and forces many switches. Memento is a good utility move, crippling Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Scizor, as well as physical attackers such as Mega Metagross, before Latios goes down. Dragon Pulse is an option over Draco Meteor if the latter's secondary effect is undesirable, but this comes at the cost of significant power. Thunder Wave paralyzes and cripples Pokemon attempting to set up on Latios after Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop, such as Bisharp and Mega Gallade. Grass Knot allows Latios to beat Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types such as Hippowdon, Tyranitar, and Mega Gyarados without needing to resort to Draco Meteor. Hidden Power Fighting hits Dark-types on the switch, scoring an OHKO on Bisharp and a 2HKO on Tyranitar; however, it deals laughable damage to Ferrothorn and Heatran, and, similarly to Hidden Power Fire, forces Latios to drop one Speed IV and thus leaves it outsped by base 110s such as Gengar, Latias, and Mega Diancie.</p> <p>Heal Block denies Latios's usual checks and counters such as Chansey and Clefable their recovery, effectively crippling them, allowing Latios to repeatedly hammer away at them with Psyshock. Tailwind doubles Latios's teammates' Speed for four turns and is extremely useful for slower Pokemon such as Scizor and Kyurem-B or against faster teams with the likes of Mega Lopunny and Mega Aerodactyl. Colbur Berry allows Latios to avoid being revenge killed by Dark-types such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Weavile by tanking the hit and retaliating with a move of its own, but running it means Latios loses power compared to when it uses other item options. Refresh prevents Latios from being worn down by status, particularly burns caused by Keldeo's Scald, and also lets Latios stallbreak much more effectively. Finally, Latiosite gives Latios a boost in its defenses, which allows it to check special and physical attackers alike more easily, but Mega Latios has less power than Life Orb Latios and prevents you from using other, potentially more useful, Mega Evolutions.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Tyranitar and Bisharp are great at taking on Latios, as the former has enough bulk to stomach even two consecutive Draco Meteors and OHKOes Latios with Crunch or traps it with Pursuit, while the latter can play mind games with Latios through Sucker Punch or Knock Off. Weavile also outspeeds Latios and can pick it off very easily if it runs Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Altaria all boast an immunity to Draco Meteor, have the bulk or typing to take a Psyshock, and can retaliate with a STAB Fairy-type move. Clefable and Mega Altaria can use Latios as setup fodder with Calm Mind and Dragon Dance, respectively, while Mega Gardevoir outright OHKOes with Hyper Voice.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types: Celebi, Jirachi, and Cresselia can avoid a 2HKO from any attack because of their good bulk and typing, even Calm Mind-boosted attacks in the case of Jirachi, and proceed to PP and Life Orb stall Latios with recovery or cripple it with paralysis. However, they must watch out for Shadow Ball, though the move is less common.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types: Ferrothorn, Klefki, and Mega Scizor can take any of Latios's attacks bar Hidden Power Fire; the former can stall it out with Leech Seed, the middle can use Latios as setup fodder for Light Screen, Reflect, and Spikes, and the latter can set up with Swords Dance or simply use Bullet Punch to quickly wear Latios down. Assault Vest Metagross is another very solid answer to Latios as it avoids the 2HKO even from Hidden Power Fire variants.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Due to Chansey's great bulk, it can take all of Latios's moves easily, even Psyshock when at high health, and wear Latios down with Seismic Toss and Toxic and recover any damage lost with Soft-Boiled. However, Chansey is worn down quite a bit by Calm Mind-boosted attacks.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Latios is prone to revenge killing because its bulk really isn't that great, and fast and powerful Pokemon such Choice Scarf Knock Off Landorus-T, Talonflame, Thundurus, Choice Scarf Garchomp, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar are prime examples. Latios is especially vulnerable to revenge killing after using Draco Meteor, as the Special Attack drop makes it much easier for bulky Pokemon such as Mega Altaria, Mew, and Mega Gyarados to set up on Latios, stall it out, or outright KO it.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Latios's strongest move, dealing great damage to Pokemon that don't resist it such as Thundurus and Slowbro. Psyshock allows Latios to threaten specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Clefable, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T by hitting their weaker Defense stat. However, Psyshock can be dropped for other coverage moves such as Surf and Hidden Power Fire if Psyshock is not necessary on the team if the likes of Clefable, Mega Venusaur, and Chansey are covered. Recover improves Latios's longevity and aids it in checking threats such as Keldeo and Mega Manectric. Defog provides invaluable support to teammates so that their health is not chipped away by entry hazards. Surf allows Latios to deal heavy damage to Heatran, Mega Diancie, and Tyranitar, while also being able to deal solid damage to the likes of Hippowdon and Gliscor without being forced to use Draco Meteor which eventually forces Latios to switch out. Hidden Power Fire deals with some Steel-types such as Scizor and Ferrothorn, but it comes at the cost of lowering Latios's Speed IV by one point, leaving it outsped by base 110s such as Gengar and Latias. Thunderbolt allows Latios to beat bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Manaphy, and Gyarados more easily without resorting to Draco Meteor and hits Skarmory super effectively. Earthquake is another option that can net the OHKO on Heatran, but Surf is generally better otherwise.</p> <p>Latios's choice of moves really boils down to necessity and practicality and depends on what the team requires.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature in tandem with maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs ensures that Latios Speed ties with opposing base 110s while hitting as hard as possible. Life Orb is the best item to use for this set, as it provides immediate power without locking Latios into a move. If running Earthquake, a Hasty nature should be used to guarantee the OHKO on Heatran after Stealth Rock; it should be chosen over Naive so that Latios can check special attackers such as Mega Manectric, Manaphy, and Keldeo better.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Latios's ample resistances, including ones to common Water-, Fire-, and Electric-type attacks, and nifty Ground-type immunity grant it a plethora of opportunities to switch in; it fits great on balanced builds due to its ability to check a lot of Pokemon threatening to the playstyle, such as Keldeo. This set should be used in a hit-and-run style, using its good Speed to quickly fire off powerful attacks, particularly Draco Meteor, and withdrawing afterwards due to the Special Attack drop. If a switch into a Latios check such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, or Ferrothorn is obvious, it is good to use the respective coverage moves to deal damage to them on the switch, such as using Earthquake on a switch to Bisharp. Play carefully if the opponent possesses Pursuit users such as Bisharp and Tyranitar, and scout for coverage moves on various Pokemon such as Icy Wind Keldeo before letting Latios check them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Mega Lopunny are great at removing Dark-types such as Tyranitar, Weavile, and Bisharp, which cause problems for Latios. Keldeo is an exceptional teammate, dealing with the aforementioned Dark-types and various other Latios checks such as Heatran, Chansey, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Pokemon that can take on Fairy-types such as Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Sylveon, such as Mega Metagross and Mega Scizor, are great teammates. In particular, Mega Scizor counters Mega Metagross, Ferrothorn, and Chansey and checks most Fairy-types.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Latios's strongest STAB move and deals incredible damage to even targets that resist it. Psychic is the preferred secondary STAB move, as it has good neutral coverage, notably 2HKOing Bold Clefable and having a favorable chance against Calm variants. It's also Latios's most reliable option, as it does not lower its Special Attack like Draco Meteor. Psyshock is an alternative to have a chance to 2HKO Chansey after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes while still being able to 2HKO Calm Clefable. Surf provides great coverage alongside Latios's STAB moves, hitting key targets such as Heatran and Tyranitar. Hidden Power Fire is an alternative to OHKO Scizor and Ferrothorn, as well as heavily chip away at Jirachi. Trick lets Latios cripple defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Chansey. If Trick isn't necessary, extra coverage can be used over it in order to give Latios a better matchup against more balance-inclined teams. Sleep Talk also gets a mention for enabling Latios to switch into Breloom's and Amoonguss's Spore while being able to maintain its offensive presence.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread plus a Timid nature maximizes Latios's offensive capabilities while taking advantage of its excellent Speed tier. Choice Specs turns Latios into a powerhouse that punches holes versus just about any team.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is best played as a hit-and-run wallbreaker, using its set of resistances to switch in and proceed to obliterate the opposition with either of its STAB attacks. If necessary, Latios can serve as a switch-in to Pokemon such as Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y by virtue of its typing. Due to a lack of recovery, however, Latios should be played more carefully with what it switches into, as it can find itself getting pressured by the aforementioned threats very easily. As such, Latios should generally be brought in either through pivot support or on aggressive double switches. Be wary of using Psychic if the opponent has a Dark-type, particularly Tyranitar, as it can come in and trap Latios, eliminating it as a threat. A similar scenario can happen with Draco Meteor if Fairy-types are present, as a wrong prediction results in a massive loss of momentum. Latios should use its coverage moves if the opponent's switch-in to a resisted hit is obvious. If running Trick, it's typically best to use it against stall teams to cripple the likes of Chansey, Jirachi, and Skarmory, making it much easier for teammates to break down the opposing team. Against more offensive teams, however, Latios should generally not use Trick, as losing the power boost from Choice Specs is fairly detrimental.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to the inherently offensive nature of Choice Specs and the absence of recovery, Latios tends to fit on very offensive teams that appreciate its wallbreaking capabilities and can regain tempo that may be lost by being locked into the wrong move. As a result of this, cleaners such as Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T benefit most from Choice Specs Latios's wallbreaking proficiency. Landorus-T and Tornadus-T also provide a way for Latios to potentially switch in unscathed with their access to U-turn, which is very useful for this set due to its lack of recovery. Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Mega Heracross beat Dark-types with ease and are able to overwhelm shared checks, specifically Clefable. Keldeo in particular appreciates Latios's ability to soft check Electric-types, while Keldeo is capable of threatening Heatran in addition to the aforementioned Dark-types. Heatran provides Stealth Rock support, sports great synergy alongside Latios, and is able to handle opposing Steel-types while putting pressure on Tyranitar and Clefable with Lava Plume burns and Taunt, respectively. Other special attackers like Alakazam, Hydreigon, and Manaphy are able to overwhelm defensive threats, capitalizing on Latios's wallbreaking capabilities. Belly Drum Azumarill gets a special mention for being able to take advantage of Pursuit trappers that plague Latios, netting a free opportunity to set up and possibly sweep.</p> "

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Latios's most powerful attack, and while it may seem counterproductive to gain Special Attack just to lose it, the raw power of the move is what makes this set so difficult to wall. Psyshock is there to win Calm Mind wars with opposing Pokemon such as Clefable and Suicune and hits specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey and Assault Vest Raikou harder than Psychic does. Calm Mind lets Latios both hit hard and take special attacks more easily, improving its matchup against stall and balance and helping it wear down its usual checks such as Clefable, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn more easily. Recover improves Latios's longevity and replenishes health lost from entry hazards, status, weather, or direct damage sustained to ease setting up. Surf allows Latios to deal with Steel-types such as Heatran and Skarmory, as well as Tyranitar, without resorting to Draco Meteor and immediately being forced to switch out. Hidden Power Fire could be an option to let Latios get past Steel-types such as Jirachi, Scizor, and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed maximizes Latios's sweeping potential. A Timid nature is used to Speed tie with opposing base 110s, such as Gengar, Mega Diancie, and Latias, as well as outpace slower Pokemon such as Garchomp, Manaphy, and Keldeo. Life Orb is used to augment the damage output of Latios's attacks significantly, and running 29 HP IVs and 4 Defense EVs minimizes Life Orb recoil. Latiosite could be used in place of Life Orb to increase Latios's bulk and prevent it from taking recoil, thus easing setting up, but at the expense of immediate power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because Latios naturally forces a lot of switches, it gets ample opportunities to set up with Calm Mind. Pokemon such as Keldeo and Slowbro are prime examples of Pokemon Latios easily forces out. With Calm Mind, Latios becomes increasingly hard to check with Pokemon such as Clefable and Heatran because they get worn down by repeated switches into Latios's boosted attacks, so don't be afraid to nuke Steel-type switch-ins that pose little-to-no threat to Latios, such as Heatran and Skarmory, with a boosted Draco Meteor. This set functions great as a wallbreaker, because after multiple boosts it is extremely difficult to switch into Latios. Keep Latios at decently high health with Recover to ease setting up, and prevent Latios from being worn down by status or damage sustained in the heat of battle.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As Latios despises Dark-, Fairy-, and Steel-types, Pokemon that can effectively check these are prime partners; Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion check Dark- and Steel-types such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Heatran, and Terrakion also has a STAB Stone Edge to hit Fairies with. Fairy-types such as Clefable, Azumarill, and Sylveon also deal with Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Weavile and can weaken Steel-types and opposing Fairy-types for Latios; in Sylveon's case, it can lure in Ferrothorn and Skarmory and KO them with Hidden Power Fire. Mega Scizor pairs great with Latios as well, boasting the ability to counter Mega Metagross and Ferrothorn and check most Fairies, while in return Latios checks Keldeo. Wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Gallade aid Latios in breaking down some of its common checks and counters; they both deal with Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Empoleon through their respective STAB moves, and the former checks Fairy-types such as Clefable while the latter deals with Dark-types such as Tyranitar. Pivots, both offensive and defensive alike, such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Rotom-W, provide free, safe switches for Latios so it can set up Calm Mind more easily, and the repeated pivoting can chip away at some Latios checks.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is incredibly strong even without a boost and thus is Latios's main move for revenge killing. Psyshock allows Latios to slip past specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Assault Vest users such as Raikou, which can stomach a Draco Meteor comfortably. The choice between Defog and Hidden Power Fire really boils down to necessity and practicality; Defog removes entry hazards from the field in a pinch and can be used more reliably after Tricking Latios's Choice Scarf to a foe, providing invaluable support to teammates that despise being worn down by entry hazards, while Hidden Power Fire deals with Ferrothorn and (Mega) Scizor, as well as bulky Grass-types such as Celebi, without resorting to Draco Meteor. Trick allows Latios to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Celebi, and Clefable by locking them into only one move. Recover is an alternate to Defog if Defog support is not needed; it also increases Latios's longevity, which this set lacks, and helps Latios check Pokemon such as Keldeo and Celebi more easily.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Because this set is focused on revenge killing, maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature is used to let Latios hit as hard and be as fast as possible. A Choice Scarf lets Latios outpace most of the metagame and function as a good revenge killer.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Play carefully, because this set is incredibly prone to being locked into an undesirable move such as Psyshock on Dark-types and then being Pursuit trapped. As this set lacks reliable recovery most of the time, it is easily worn down by repeatedly switching into Pokemon such as Keldeo, so Latios should be preserved as best as possible. This set is capable of crippling any wall that can avoid a 2HKO from Latios, so you should prioritize saving Trick for them, though you can also use this strategy on a setup sweeper such as Nasty Plot Thundurus. Choice Scarf Latios is best played as a revenge killer, outspeeding many fast threats such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Manectric, Mega Aerodactyl, and Tornadus-T.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard X, and Crawdaunt are great teammates for Choice Scarf Latios to wear down the opposing team so that Latios can pick them off late-game using its high Speed. Mega Scizor pairs great with Latios as well, boasting the ability to counter Mega Metagross and Ferrothorn, wear down the opposing team with a combination of Swords Dance and Bullet Punch, and check most Fairies, while in return Latios checks Keldeo. Keldeo is a great partner too, as it checks Dark- and Steel-types such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, Weavile, and Heatran for Latios and the burns it induces on the opposing team wear them down for Latios to pick them off late-game. Pivots, both defensive and offensive alike, such as Rotom-W and Tornadus-T, are great at giving Latios free opportunities to switch in.</p> "

  "Jirachi": {
    "overview": "<p>Jirachi's solid defenses and typing allow it to check Fairy-, Dragon-, and Psychic-types, such as Mega Diancie, Kyurem-B, Latias, Latios, Clefable, and Mega Alakazam, and it notably is one of the best switch-ins to Mega Gardevoir for bulky teams. Its movepool is huge, allowing it to take advantage of its balanced stats to perform a wide variety of roles. Defensive sets have plenty of support options to make use of, such as Wish and Body Slam, while offensive sets pack just enough power to make use of its wide coverage. On top of all this, Jirachi's incredible ability, Serene Grace, allows it to turn games around in conjunction with many of its attacks, including the notorious Iron Head. However, Jirachi's issues stem from its only average offenses, especially when uninvested, as its STAB attacks' mediocre power offer many opportunities for dangerous Pokemon to switch in such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Scizor, and Heatran. It also struggles to deal with common Pokemon like Rocky Helmet Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn if it isn't carrying the right coverage move.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder Wave can be used to reliably paralyze foes, but this leaves Jirachi unable to cripple Ground-types. Jirachi gets Calm Mind, which can allow it to break through slower teams through its coverage; however, in general it struggles to break through defensive cores due to a lack of power and the resulting lack of coverage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran is Jirachi's hardest counter, resisting its STAB attacks and most of its common coverage moves. Outside of the rare Hidden Power Ground, the only thing Jirachi can do to Heatran is paralyze it with Body Slam or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Talonflame, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y generally have nothing to fear from Jirachi thanks to their typing, although they don't like being paralyzed by Body Slam or being worn down by Toxic. Talonflame and Mega Charizard are especially frightening as both get free set up opportunities against Jirachi.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Gliscor can typically switch into Jirachi and threaten heavy damage with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Scizor, Bisharp, and Magnezone have no trouble switching into Jirachi, though they must watch out for Fire Punch. The former two can use Jirachi as set up bait, while the latter can trap Jirachi due to Magnet Pull. Just note Jirachi can easily evade being trapped by Magnezone with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Manaphy are generally safe switch-ins, as Jirachi typically does not carry coverage for them, though they all are heavily cripple by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Although most don't resist Jirachi's attacks, Dark-types can prove extremely threatening. Bisharp is able to pick off Jirachi with Knock Off and Sucker Punch while also being able to stop it from switching out with Pursuit. Mega Gyarados isn't afraid of anything but Body Slam and can set up with Dragon Dance or knock out Jirachi with Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, and Rough Skin: Jirachi's main methods of dealing damage are all contact based, so it takes heavy damage from users of Iron Barbs, Rough Skin, and Rocky Helmet, most notably Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Skarmory.</p> ",

        "name": "Stealth Rock",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Iron Head is Jirachi's main attacking move and is used to chip away at the Pokemon Jirachi walls. Additionally, thanks to Serene Grace, Iron Head has a 60% flinch chance, which is beneficial in Jirachi's matchup against slower Pokemon such as Clefable. Stealth Rock is a vital support move to have on every team, and Jirachi is an above-average setter of it thanks to its ability to take on the tier's most common Defogger, Latios. U-turn allows Jirachi to generate momentum for its team on predicted checks switching in while also dealing chip damage. Healing Wish is a fantastic support move that allows Jirachi to restore the HP of and cure any status condition on a teammate at the expense of Jirachi fainting. Toxic can be used over Healing Wish in order to cripple certain Pokemon that typically switch into Jirachi such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Slowbro. Body Slam is another alternative to Healing Wish and gives Jirachi a 60% chance to paralyze several other Pokemon that check it such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill. After its foes are paralyzed, Jirachi can attempt to paraflinch them to death with Iron Head. Body Slam is typically preferred over Thunder Wave for its ability to paralyze Ground-types and deal damage as well.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>32 Speed EVs are invested so that Jirachi can outpace Jolly Tyranitar. Various other more team-dependent Speed benchmarks may be used. For example, 80 Speed EVs are enough for Jirachi to outpace Adamant Diggersby, while 108 Speed EVs are enough for it to outspeed positive-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon like Volcanion and Breloom as well as neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Altaria. Maximum HP investment is used to increase Jirachi's overall bulk, and the remaining EVs are placed in Special Defense with a Careful nature to take on the likes of Mega Diancie, Latios, Clefable, and Mega Venusaur as effectively as possible. Leftovers is the item of choice, as Jirachi greatly appreciates the additional longevity it provides, especially considering that this set forgoes any means of reliable recovery.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Jirachi should be pivoted into Pokemon it checks such as Mega Diancie, Clefable, and Latios. At that point, it can proceed to attack with Iron Head, set up Stealth Rock, or use U-turn and pick up momentum. On predicted switches into a Jirachi check, typically it is best to set up Stealth Rock early-game in order to get chip damage on the opponent's Pokemon as they switch. If Stealth Rock is already set, using U-turn to pick up momentum is generally preferred. However, sometimes even without Stealth Rock up, the reward of using U-turn can be greater than that of setting up Stealth Rock, especially when Jirachi is paired with a powerful wallbreaker like Mega Medicham, which feasts on many of Jirachi's checks. Additionally, it is not recommended to use U-turn against opposing Pokemon that tend to carry Rocky Helmet such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, or Tangrowth when Jirachi is still needed to check threats like Clefable or Latios. Passive damage from Rocky Helmet combined with this set's lack of recovery wears Jirachi down quite fast, so hard switching is better in these situations. Healing Wish should be used when a teammate needs to be brought back to full HP or have a status condition cured in order to win the game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Jirachi set is best used as a support for offensive teams. It works best paired with powerful wallbreakers that appreciate a slow U-turn, as well as sweepers that appreciate Healing Wish support. Keldeo and Mega Medicham are stellar examples of powerful wallbreakers to pair well with Jirachi, as both take advantage of U-turn, being able to smash common Jirachi switch-ins like Heatran, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn while also benefiting from Jirachi being able to take on the likes of Mega Diancie and Latios. Manaphy, Tornadus-T, and Mega Lopunny are all examples of Pokemon that are great partners for Jirachi due to their ability to thrive with Healing Wish support to give them another opportunity to run through a weakened team. Dragon-types such as Kyurem-B and Latios also pair well with Jirachi, because Jirachi threatens common checks to both such as Clefable, opposing Latios, and Mega Diancie. Garchomp especially appreciates these Pokemon being taken care of, as it can potentially set up with Swords Dance and sweep after their removal. One of Weavile's most common answers in Clefable can be taken out by Jirachi, while Weavile can take advantage of one of the most common defensive responses to Jirachi in Landorus-T. Mega Manectric can form a VoltTurn core with Jirachi while appreciating Jirachi handling the likes of Latios, Latias, and Clefable. Rotom-W is another great partner that checks some problematic Fire-types like Talonflame and Heatran while also checking most Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Sand Rush Excadrill, and in return, it likes Clefable, Latios, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss being taken care of by Jirachi. Finally, Landorus-T can prove itself to be a very versatile partner, checking Excadrill, Talonflame, Mega Charizard X, and Garchomp while also being able to provide speed control with Choice Scarf or work as a sweeper with Rock Polish and Swords Dance.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Iron Head is the move Jirachi will be using most of the time, due to its power and flinch chance. U-turn gives Jirachi a way of retaining momentum on predicted switch-ins, allowing it to get off damage and switch into a counter. Fire Punch lets it break past Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn. Heart Stamp gives Jirachi a way of beating Keldeo, Mega Charizard Y, and Raikou and deals more damage to Mega Venusaur, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Manectric. Healing Wish lets Jirachi heal its teammates to full health at the cost of its own life, which gives Jirachi something to do when it otherwise wouldn't be helpful. Trick allows Jirachi to punish some of its defensive switch-ins, locking them into a single move with a Choice Scarf and stealing their item.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs, when paired with a Choice Scarf and a Jolly nature, allow Jirachi to outrun every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, Speed tie with other base 100s at +1, and outrun slower Choice Scarf users such as Kyurem-B and Landorus-T. The Attack investment maximizes Jirachi's offensive potential.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Jirachi is used as a revenge killer, being able to outrun and take out Pokemon weak to its STAB attacks. Thanks to its typing and natural bulk, it's able to switch into Latios, Latias, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Diancie and eliminate them with Iron Head. Jirachi can use U-turn effectively in order to bait out its counters and allow its teammates to deal with them. Use U-turn or a coverage move when you predict your opponent to switch out, hitting the target with a coverage move when appropriate and pivoting out when not. If your opponent is using Rocky Helmet Garchomp to check Jirachi, it would be best to switch out directly rather than U-turn out, as the residual damage from Garchomp's Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin will wear down Jirachi very quickly. Healing Wish is generally more useful in situations where Jirachi is not helpful or where recovering another teammate is more useful than keeping Jirachi around, such as a wallbreaker in a match against a stall team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Healing Wish is a huge boon for most sweepers and wallbreakers, allowing them the possibility of a second attempt at their job if they get statused or heavily damaged early in a match. As a result, Jirachi pairs up nicely with a ton of offensive Pokemon. Pokemon that can deal with foes that resist Steel are extremely helpful, as their removal means that Jirachi can be much more threatening. Steel-types can be dealt with by a Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, or Garchomp; Water-types are vulnerable to Pokemon such as Serperior and Thundurus; Fire types can be removed by Keldeo or Gyarados. Ground-types are also a major issue for Jirachi, so teammates that can deal with them are a must. Azumarill, Keldeo, and Manaphy are great partners, as they also appreciate Jirachi's ability to switch into Latios and Latias. Jirachi is unable to break through defensive cores on its own, so partners that can weaken those cores are a necessity. Mega Gardevoir can put huge holes into defensive teams while crippling both its and Jirachi's checks with Will-O-Wisp. Manaphy is another option, as it can easily break through defensive cores with Tail Glow-boosted attacks. Other wallbreakers like Kyurem-B and Mega Pinsir make for good teammates as well, as they are both able to heavily pressure Ground- and Electric-types that Jirachi struggles with. Dark-types, such as Bisharp and Mega Gyarados, can prove threatening if Jirachi is locked into the wrong move. Having a teammate that can take them out, such as Breloom, can be extremely helpful. Entry hazard support helps Jirachi out a lot, making up for its average attacking power. Landorus-T can set up Stealth Rock and forms a U-turn core with Jirachi in order to help it break down its counters. Klefki is another option, being able to set up Spikes and paralyze Pokemon to allow Jirachi to immobilize them more effectively.</p> "

        "name": "SubToxic",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Iron Head is Jirachi's method of stalling out its foes, relying on the 60% chance to flinch as a way of denying them the chance to threaten Jirachi or heal up. Toxic takes advantage of this by incrementally damaging its victim, allowing Jirachi to slowly wear down its targets and notably cripple Pokemon that would normally have little issue switching into Jirachi such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Garchomp. Substitute gives Jirachi a buffer against attacks and status and another way to stall out opposing Pokemon. Fire Punch provides coverage on Steel-types such as Scizor and Ferrothorn, which are immune to Toxic and resist Iron Head, preventing Jirachi from wearing them down over time.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The HP investment allows Jirachi to create 101 HP Substitutes, preventing them from being broken by Chansey's Seismic Toss. The Speed investment allows Jirachi to outrun positive-natured base 80s, such as Mamoswine and Mega Altaria. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack, allowing Jirachi to 2HKO defensive Mega Scizor and Excadrill with Fire Punch while also giving Iron Head a little bit more power behind it.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Using Toxic early on allows Jirachi to status its switch-ins as soon as possible and wear them out. After Jirachi has poisoned its switch-in, you can set up a Substitute on a predicted switch and begin making the switch-in flinch. The damage from Iron Head and Toxic poison will add up quickly and will allow Jirachi to break down its check while protecting itself from damage with flinches and the Substitute. Try to use Substitute sparingly when Jirachi is needed to check a specfic threat, as Jirachi will find itself quickly losing HP.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set functions as a Fairy check, and as a result the likes of Dragonite, Kyurem-B, Latios, and Mega Lopunny will appreciate Jirachi's help. Landorus-T and Gliscor are able to switch into Excadrill and opposing Landorus-T. Of special note is Rocky Helmet Garchomp, as it is able to heavily damage Jirachi through Rough Skin's and Rocky Helmet's residual damage, meaning that it can KO Jirachi through its own Iron Heads. Faster Water-types, such as Keldeo and Starmie, as well as Slowbro and Rotom-W if they are able to break through Iron Head's flinch chance, are able to force Jirachi out. Mega Venusaur, Latios, and Latias are able to deal with all of them. Hippowdon is a great stop to Bisharp and Mega Charizard X, which are huge threats to Jirachi. Status is a major issue for this set, as a burn prevents Jirachi from healing with Leftovers and paralysis prevents it from making its targets flinch, so cleric support from Clefable or Chansey is a huge help.</p> "

        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Iron Head is Jirachi's main STAB move, being able to deal ample damage to most targets. Icy Wind hits Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. Thunderbolt smashes Slowbro, Suicune, and Skarmory. Hidden Power Ground provides coverage on Bisharp, Heatran, and Magnezone. Hidden Power Fire can be run to surprise Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Bisharp. Alternatively, Healing Wish allows Jirachi to heal up a teammate to full once it has outlived its usefulness, and Energy Ball can be run over Thunderbolt, hitting Rotom-W, Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon harder than the rest of Jirachi's moves. Stealth Rock can be run in the last slot as well if the team is in need of a setter.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Attack investment ensures that Jirachi will be able to 2HKO Clefable with Iron Head while generally pumping up its offensive power. 216 Speed allows Jirachi to outrun neutral-natured Kyurem-B and everything slower. The remaining EVs and a Mild nature power up Jirachi's special moves, allowing it to hit its targets as hard as possible. Expert Belt helps boost the power of super effective hits without revealing Jirachi's item, allowing it to bluff another item, such as Choice Scarf. Alternatively, a Shuca Berry allows Jirachi to take Ground-type moves and land hits on faster Ground-types, such as offensive Garchomp and Choice Scarf Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set relies on Jirachi's coverage in order to tear apart defensive cores. Use the surprise factor in order to bait in typical switch-ins such as Garchomp and Ferrothorn. Pretending to be another set, such as the Choice Scarf set, can lead opponents into a false sense of security and open them up to a super effective hit.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Jirachi's coverage heavily depends on its teammates and what Jirachi can lure for them. Mega Lopunny loves having Garchomp and Landorus-T removed with Icy Wind. Gyarados appreciates Ferrothorn and Skarmory being removed through Hidden Power Fire. Mega Charizard X wants Quagsire, Landorus-T, and Slowbro out of the way, and the combination of Icy Wind and Energy Ball can allow Jirachi to remove all of them. Clefable and Scizor appreciate having Heatran removed, and running Hidden Power Ground can surprise and KO it. Jirachi is still able to switch in and deal with Dragon-, Fairy-, and Psychic-types as usual; however, this set runs less bulk than others and is thus much more prone to being worn down. As a result, pivots such as Rotom-W and Landorus-T that can bring Jirachi in safely are very helpful to prevent it from taking unnecessary damage.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Iron Head is Jirachi's primary form of damage output, taking advantage of the high Serene Grace-boosted flinch chance to stall out opposing Pokemon. Toxic gives Jirachi a way of damaging Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Rotom-W over the course of a match. Alternatively, Body Slam can be used to spread paralysis and prevent Jirachi from being setup fodder for Steel-resistant Pokemon and Taunt users. Wish allows Jirachi to heal its teammates and itself. Protect provides Jirachi with a way of guaranteeing that its Wish will land on itself, even in the face of offensively threatening Pokemon. Alternatively, U-turn allows Jirachi to maintain momentum on predicted switches, safely bring in Pokemon to receive a Wish, and escape from Magnezone.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>32 Speed EVs allow Jirachi to outrun Jolly Tyranitar and neutral-natured base 70s, such as Bisharp and Breloom. The remaining EVs and the Careful nature serve to improve Jirachi's special bulk, aiding it in taking on special attackers such as Latios and Mega Gardevoir. Leftovers serves as a form of passive recovery.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Jirachi's bulk and typing allow it to switch reliably into special attackers such as Mega Gardevoir, Latios, Mega Alakazam, and Clefable. From here, using a status move like Toxic or Body Slam allows Jirachi to wear down its switch-ins. Iron Head's flinch chance is very useful on a statused foe, either allowing Toxic damage to add up quickly or preventing the foe from attacking due to the combination of paralysis and flinches. Wish should generally be used on predicted switches and when Jirachi or a teammate is in need of healing. Use Protect in order to guarantee that Jirachi recieve its Wish without risk. Protect is also useful to stall out the foe with Toxic damage as well as scout for the foe's next move, which is especially useful for Pokemon that use Choice items.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Jirachi is best paired with Dragon- and Fighting-type Pokemon, which struggle to deal with Fairy-types on their own. Pokemon such as Dragonite, Kyurem-B, Latios, and Mega Lopunny all appreciate Jirachi's support. Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Gliscor are able to manage Jirachi's weakness to Excadrill, opposing Landorus-T, and Garchomp. Similarly, Mega Charizard X and Heatran can deal with Steel-types such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn, which wall Jirachi. Keldeo, Starmie, Slowbro, and other Water-types can prove to be an issue as well, and teammates such as Mega Venusaur, Latios, and Latias are able to deal with them. Hippowdon is a great stop to Bisharp and Mega Charizard X, which are huge threats to Jirachi. Lastly, Jirachi is easily worn down when statused, so a cleric, such as Clefable or Chansey, can be useful.</p> "

  "Infernape": {
    "overview": "<p>While it may not be a popular choice in OU due to how much competition it suffers from other Fighting-type wallbreakers such as Keldeo and Terrakion as well as Fire-types like mixed Victini and bulky Mega Charizard X, Infernape still has a few tools at its disposal that make it a decent choice on certain teams. It sports a unique typing that, despite not being particularly good, enables it to check powerful threats like Bisharp, Weavile, and Scizor. It also has an outstanding movepool, with not only multiple coverage moves that give it the ability to deal significant damage to the vast majority of the OU tier, especially given its mixed offensive capabilities enabling it to break past both physical and special walls, but also a great support movepool, with moves like Slack Off, Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Stealth Rock. Unfortunately, while Infernape's typing and movepool are impressive, its stats are not. Its defenses are lacking, and while 104 / 104 / 108 offenses aren't bad, by ORAS standards they aren't very impressive either. Furthermore, Infernape's weaknesses to Water, Ground, Psychic, and Flying are all very crippling, given how common all of these types are in OU.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Infernape is a very versatile Pokemon with many options at its disposal. It can be used as a Stealth Rock lead, with the distinction of being able to check Weavile, a Pokemon most suicide leads are very weak to. A Choice Scarf set allows Infernape to act as both as a fast revenge killer with the ability to keep up momentum and as a way to bait Psychic-types like Latios and Latias and hit them very hard with U-turn, gaining momentum in the process. It works very well with a Pursuit trapper, as Infernape can get it in safely against a Psychic- or Ghost-type, which its teammate can then Pursuit trap so that Infernape can much more easily clean with Close Combat later on in the battle. Infernape can also run a boosting set with either Swords Dance or Nasty Plot, both of which enable it to set up on Sableye as opposed to being walled by it. However, Infernape's poor bulk makes it very difficult for it to find opportunities to set up, and its lack of good priority options combined with its low Speed compared to that of most offensive threats makes it very easy to revenge kill. A Choice Band set can take advantage of a powerful U-turn, but its unremarkable Speed makes it hard for it to threaten offensive teams, and its inability to switch moves combined with its lack of raw power makes it difficult for it to pressure defensive teams, especially with its heavy reliance on Flare Blitz cutting its longevity. Encore can be used to provide setup opportunities for sweepers and lock defensive Pokemon like Slowbro and Hippowdon into their recovery move, while Fake Out can be used to break Focus Sashes and get chip damage on faster Pokemon; however, both are very hard to fit on Infernape's set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types that either resist Infernape's Fire-type STAB moves or have enough natural bulk to take it on act as good checks to it. Latios and Latias in particular easily outspeed and OHKO Infernape, only fearing U-turn on the switch. Starmie can also take Infernape on very well unless it switches into a super effective coverage move, Slowbro can counter any Infernape set that does not run Grass Knot, and Slowking can even take a Grass Knot well but fears Thunder Punch and U-turn. Mew can easily deal with any set provided it runs Psychic-type coverage, as it cannot beat faster variants that carry Taunt otherwise. Likewise, Reuniclus handles Infernape very well for the most part, even though it does take a large chunk of damage from Fire Blast. Victini is a decent check, though it does get outsped if it doesn't carry a Choice Scarf, takes a solid chunk of damage from Gunk Shot, and is 2HKOed by Stone Edge. Faster Psychic-types such as Alakazam and Mega Metagross can easily switch in on Infernape's Fighting-type STAB moves and OHKO back, even though all of these hate taking a Fire Blast or a Flare Blitz.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types can usually check Infernape decently, although most of them have a hard time switching in; Azumarill works particularly well thanks to its access to super effective priority, although it hates Gunk Shot and Will-O-Wisp. Suicune handles non-Grass Knot sets with ease thanks to its great bulk, as does Alomomola. Gyarados takes little damage from Infernape's most common moves thanks to Intimidate and its natural special bulk, but it dislikes Stone Edge and Thunder Punch. Tentacruel resists most of Infernape's coverage moves, but it lacks the physical bulk and recovery to take repeated Close Combats. Keldeo easily beats Infernape one-on-one and can even take a Close Combat relatively well thanks to its natural bulk, but it needs to win the Speed tie to actually switch into Infernape properly, unless it runs a Choice Scarf. Manaphy is bulky enough to switch into Infernape quite well and easily walls it with a Calm Mind set. Weather sweepers such as Kingdra and Kabutops make quick work of Infernape under rain, provided that they don't switch into a Close Combat. While uncommon, Jellicent acts as a decent answer to Infernape, although physically defensive variants fear Grass Knot and specially defensive variants take a lot of damage from Gunk Shot.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: While they do not necessarily resist either of Infernape's STAB types, Ground-types are generally very good checks to Infernape due to a combination of natural bulk and access to super effective STAB moves. Landorus-T and Gliscor can easily switch into a Close Combat and hit back with Earthquake, and Gliscor in particular is immune to burns and thus does not fear Will-O-Wisp. However, neither of these can handle a Life Orb-boosted Hidden Power Ice. Other Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Mega Swampert, Quagsire, and physically defensive Gastrodon can handle any set not running Grass Knot.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types are usually good answers to Infernape thanks to their resistance to Fire. Garchomp OHKOes Infernape with Earthquake and deals massive recoil damage back with Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet when hit by Close Combat; however, it dislikes Hidden Power Ice. Mega Altaria beats any set lacking Gunk Shot, while Dragalge resists almost all of Infernape's coverage moves bar the rare Earthquake but does not have the Defense or the recovery to take repeated hits. Dragonite takes Infernape on rather easily, only fearing the uncommon Hidden Power Ice, which is mitigated by Multiscale and can even be taken advantage of with a potential Weakness Policy, and it can even heal a burn if it runs a Lum Berry.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Flying-types serve as solid checks to Infernape as long as it is not running Stone Edge or Thunder Punch. Talonflame in particular can handle even Choice Scarf sets thanks to its priority Flying-type STAB moves. Tornadus-T can take both Close Combat and Fire Blast from Infernape and outspeed and OHKO back with Hurricane, while Mega Aerodactyl can take Infernape's Fire-type STAB moves and KO back with Aerial Ace provided it does not get burned.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: While they can rarely switch into its Fire-type STAB moves, Ghost-types serve as good checks to Infernape thanks to their Fighting immunity. Gengar completely shuts down defensive Infernape via Taunt, and it can outspeed and OHKO offensive sets with Sludge Wave. Hoopa can handle Infernape sets that do not carry Flare Blitz, although Fire Blast and Gunk Shot both deal a good chunk of damage to it.</p> ",

        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Close Combat is Infernape's primary STAB move, as it hits hard and has good neutral coverage. Fire Blast hits many Pokemon immune or resistant to Fighting, such as Sableye, Gengar, and Celebi. The fact that it inflicts special rather than physical damage also enables it to hit certain physically bulky Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Mega Manectric harder. Flare Blitz can also be used for its higher accuracy and its ability to hit Assault Vest Tornadus-T, Volcarona, and specially defensive Mew harder. However, the recoil damage it causes can be very problematic for Infernape when combined with Life Orb recoil, especially when going against the likes of Ferrothorn and weakened Garchomp. Gunk Shot is a must on this set, targeting Mega Altaria, Azumarill, Clefable, and Mega Gardevoir, the former two hard checking Infernape and the latter two beating it one-on-one otherwise. It also gives Infernape good neutral coverage on Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, Latios, Gyarados, Dragonite, and Starmie. Grass Knot enables Infernape to 2HKO Slowbro, a Pokemon that otherwise walls it, as well as hit specially defensive Hippowdon, Starmie, and Quagsire, all of which are very good checks and counters to Infernape otherwise. However, Hidden Power Ice can also be used in order to hit Garchomp, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Dragonite for a huge amount of damage. If Hidden Power Ice is run, Flare Blitz is preferred over Fire Blast because most Pokemon that are hit harder by Fire Blast than Flare Blitz are hit even harder by Hidden Power Ice. Mach Punch can be used as a way to revenge kill the likes of Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf Tyranitar as well as deal with Bisharp and Weavile more reliably, but Infernape generally prefers the coverage. Thunder Punch is a decent option for hitting Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y and also hits certain Water-types like Gyarados, Tentacruel, and Slowking harder than any other move, but Infernape has to sacrifice pretty important coverage for that. Finally, Stone Edge can be used for Flying-types in general, particularly Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Gyarados.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb gives extra firepower to both Infernape's physical and its special attacks. Blaze is the preferred ability on Infernape, as it gives its Fire-type STAB moves extra power when it's weakened. If Thunder Punch or Mach Punch is being used, Iron Fist is the better ability, as it powers up both those moves. A Naive nature enables Infernape to switch into the likes of Bisharp, Weavile, and Scizor while being as fast as possible and keeping both its offensive stats intact. The given spread enables Infernape to 2HKO standard Slowbro with Grass Knot while Speed tying with Keldeo and Terrakion. If 2HKOing Slowbro isn't too much of a concern and you want a more physically offensive spread, running 188 Atk / 68 SpA / 252 Spe enables Infernape to OHKO 0 HP / 4 Def Mega Altaria after Stealth Rock with Gunk Shot. If you run Hidden Power Ice, a spread of 124 Atk / 132 SpA / 252 Spe enables Infernape to OHKO Choice Scarf variants of Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set should be used to clean through weakened teams after Pokemon that can revenge kill or counter Infernape are gone. Hence, it should usually be kept for the late-game. However, Infernape can also be used early on in the battle to lure and KO certain threats to your team. For example, if you want Slowbro removed for your Keldeo to sweep, you can send Infernape in mid-game and proceed to hit Slowbro with Grass Knot as it switches in. Be careful, though, as once you reveal a certain move, you will not be able to catch your opponent off guard again. Try to predict around certain checks to Infernape in order to be able to KO them. For instance, if your opponent has a healthy Slowbro, you will need to hit it with Grass Knot in order to 2HKO it, and Azumarill needs to be hit with Gunk Shot as it switches in or it will be able to check Infernape through Aqua Jet. However, the opponent may well have multiple checks to Infernape, and is therefore not guaranteed to send in the one you expect. He also may not send in any Pokemon at all, instead opting to sacrifice the Pokemon currently in if he feels like it isn't needed anymore. Therefore, be sure to predict your opponent's reaction based on their team. Use Infernape as a check to certain threats to your team, like Bisharp, Weavile, and Scizor. However, avoid switching it directly on these Pokemon because all of these can severely weaken Infernape; Weavile and Bisharp in particular can easily compromise its offensive capabilities by removing its Life Orb via Knock Off. If you need Infernape to stay healthy to clean more easily in the late-game, it's usually better to handle these threats differently if you can.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>A good answer to Talonflame, Latios, and Latias, three of Infernape's best and most common checks, is a necessity. Pursuit Tyranitar is an excellent partner for these reasons, acting not only as a great Talonflame check but also as a reliable way to Pursuit trap Latios and Latias. Tyranitar can also Pursuit trap several bulky Psychic-types like Reuniclus, Cresselia, and Slowking, which can cause a lot of trouble for Infernape. Other Pursuit trappers like Bisharp and Weavile are also good partners for the same reasons, with Weavile's high Speed and access to priority helping a lot against the likes of Tornadus-T and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Depending on its moveset, Infernape will have a hard time breaking past certain Pokemon, so these Pokemon will need to be lured or weakened via entry hazards. For instance, Toxic Spikes support can severely weaken Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Slowbro, and Icy Wind Gengar can remove Gliscor, all of which can handle certain variants of this set. Certain Pokemon benefit from Infernape's ability to lure and KO certain threats and therefore make for good partners for it. For instance, Mega Charizard X appreciates Infernape's ability to eliminate Slowbro, Quagsire, Hippowdon, Azumarill, and Mega Altaria, all of which can check or counter Mega Charizard X. Infernape can have a hard time finding opportunities to switch in, so it pairs well with a slow Volt Switch user such as Rotom-W and U-turn users such as defensive Landorus-T. Celebi is a particularly good partner because it also easily takes care of the Ground- and Water-types that can check Infernape. Infernape can also very easily get worn down by Flare Blitz recoil, especially combined with Life Orb, and is vulnerable to paralysis and poison. Thus, a Healing Wish user can provide good support for it. Latias is a particularly good option, as it check certain Water-, Ground-, and Dragon-types that threaten Infernape, which, in return, takes care of Steel- and Dark-types, which pose a huge threat to Latias. Infernape should not be used as the team's sole check to Weavile or Bisharp, unless it runs Mach Punch, as it is 2HKOed by both of these Pokemon.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Will-O-Wisp disables physical attackers Infernape is supposed to check such as Scizor, cripples common switch-ins like Gyarados, Azumarill, Hippowdon, and Garchomp, and serves as a way of wearing down defensive Pokemon in general. Slack Off gives Infernape a good amount of longevity and enables it to consistently wall threats. Taunt disables defensive Pokemon like Clefable, Celebi, Mew, and Amoonguss by shutting down their recovery and utility moves and allows Infernape to stallbreak when combined with burn damage from Will-O-Wisp. Low Kick is the preferred offensive move on this set, as it hits Heatran, a very common Will-O-Wisp absorber, very hard. Close Combat can be used instead for more consistent power and much more damage against the likes of Rotom-W, Manaphy, and Diancie. However, the defense drops are detrimental to the defensive nature of this set. Flare Blitz can be used in order to OHKO Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Serperior, and Mega Scizor, 2HKO Skarmory, and deal far more damage to Clefable, Tornadus-T, and Mega Gardevoir as they switch in. However, this leaves Infernape completely helpless against Heatran, and the recoil damage it causes can be detrimental to a defensive set like this. Finally, Stealth Rock can be used over Taunt on this set if your team doesn't have another setter; however, this leaves Infernape very vulnerable to defensive Pokemon that it would much rather be able to handle, and it would enable Swords Dance Mega Scizor, a Pokemon Infernape is supposed to counter, to beat it instead.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Both of Infernape's abilities are worthless on the standard set. However, Blaze should be chosen if Flare Blitz is used, while Iron Fist should be used if Fire Punch is used. Leftovers gives Infernape passive recovery, increasing its defensive capabilities. The given spread enables Infernape to outspeed everything up to neutral-natured base 95 Speed Pokemon and positive-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon, all the while having enough physical bulk to avoid the OHKO from a burned Mega Gyarados's +1 Waterfall and the 2HKO from Hippowdon's Earthquake as well as enough special bulk to avoid the OHKO from Kyurem-B's Earth Power and Rotom-W's Hydro Pump. However, a faster spread of 252 HP / 48 Def / 208 Spe enables Infernape to outspeed and burn Garchomp and helps it check Mega Charizard Y by stalling out sun turns with a faster Slack Off.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Infernape should be sent in against the Steel-, Dark-, and Grass-types it counters, such as Bisharp, Scizor, and Weavile. It can also be sent in against defensive Pokemon in order to cripple them, but it must be wary of getting poisoned or paralyzed. Early on in the battle, Will-O-Wisp is a very safe move to use because it can easily cripple Pokemon that switch into it. If the opponent's answer to Infernape is already burned, using Will-O-Wisp can be a waste of time, so avoid doing it. Be sure to keep Infernape healthy by using Slack Off frequently, especially when it is weakened, so that it can consistently switch into threats to your team. Try to get Stealth Rock up before sending Infernape out, as its best checks are weak to it. This makes Will-O-Wisp even more of a risk-free move, as the main risk is that a Fire-type like Talonflame will absorb it, and in order to do so, it will have to take hefty damage from Stealth Rock. Taunt should be used against defensive Pokemon like Clefable and Celebi and entry hazard setters that can't threaten Infernape, such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and burned Garchomp or Hippowdon. It can also be used as a way to prevent slower setup sweepers from setting up, but Will-O-Wisp does this more safely and permanently, making it almost always a better move to use in that scenario.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Infernape set fits well on defensive teams that require a bulky Fire-type with stallbreaking capabilities that can also act as a check to certain Dark-types and Steel-types such as Bisharp, Weavile, Scizor, and Heatran, as well as a Knock Off and burn absorber. Mega Sableye completely shuts down this set, so Infernape needs support from a Mega Sableye counter. Clefable is particularly good, as it also handles Latios and Latias, two very good answers to Infernape. Jirachi's ability to handle the two as well as Gardevoir and Diancie, two big threats to Infernape, makes it another good partner. Most Fire-types easily switch in on Infernape because they can absorb Will-O-Wisp, so Infernape needs support from a good answer to Fire-types, be it a Water-type like Slowbro or Quagsire or a Dragon-type like Latias or Mega Altaria. Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Celebi, and Serperior can also make for good Infernape partners, as they check Water-types that pose a huge threat to Infernape.</p> "

  "Empoleon": {
    "overview": "<p>By virtue of its great typing, Empoleon is able to check popular Dragon-, Fairy-, and Water-types such as Latios, Mega Altaria, and Manaphy. Access to both Stealth Rock and Defog is also very useful as Empoleon provides great entry hazard control in one teamslot, and it is one of the few Defog users with a resistance to Stealth Rock. However, Empoleon is somewhat passive; it often just sits there hoping for a Scald burn and phazing the foe. It also loses to some of the Pokemon it is supposed to check, such as Clefable, in a last Pokemon situation. Weaknesses to common offensive types in Fighting, Ground, and Electric also hold Empoleon back a little because Pokemon often carry coverage that hit it super effectively. Finally, no reliable recovery and low Speed means Empoleon is worn down pretty easily and cannot keep checking threats the whole game without Wish support.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Specs set with the moves Hydro Pump, Flash Cannon, Grass Knot, and either Hidden Power Fire or Ice Beam hits very hard and can bluff the standard defensive set. Empoleon can be a suicide lead with Focus Sash to take advantage of Torrent to fire off powerful Hydro Pumps. It can also get surprise KOs against Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Excadrill, and act as an emergency check to Pokemon such as Mega Altaria with Flash Cannon. Agility and Substitute together with a Petaya Berry make Empoleon a decent sweeper, but one that is lacking in coverage. A physically offensive set with Defiant and Swords Dance can possibly sweep with boosted Aqua Jets, but is weak without a boost and just generally an inferior Defiant user. Flash Cannon hits Fairy-types such as Clefable and Sylveon that Empoleon walls decently hard, but most of the time Empoleon is better off just using Roar as Calm Mind Clefable sets up on it and Sylveon will often switch out of Empoleon anyway. Icy Wind can slow down the foe for another teammate to defeat it. Checks and Counters =================== <strong>Electric-types: Electric-types such as Raikou, Rotom-W, and Thundurus hit Empoleon for super effective damage with their STAB attacks. They do not like poison, however, as Electric-types are often relied upon to defeat Flying-types such as Talonflame and Mega Pinsir that often accompany Empoleon. <strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Mega Gallade can easily take care of Empoleon with their STAB moves, and set up a Swords Dance or Calm Mind as Empoleon switches out. Assault Vest Conkeldurr can also switch in on anything Empoleon can do and defeat it. <strong>Grass-types: Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Breloom wall Empoleon and can do whatever they want against it. <strong>Magnezone: Magnezone does a very good job at switching into, trapping, and defeating Empoleon with a STAB Thunderbolt. <strong>Chansey</strong>: Due to its massive HP and Special Defense, Chansey can switch in without fear against any Empoleon lacking Knock Off and defeat Empoleon with Seismic Toss.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald has a 30% chance to burn the foe, making physical attackers hesitant to switch in. Roar phazes out setup sweepers such as Manaphy and Clefable that would otherwise set up on Empoleon despite the type disadvantage. Toxic helps in actually defeating Pokemon such as Latios that Empoleon walls but cannot deal a lot of damage against with Scald. Defog removes all entry hazards from the field, which is useful for teammates such as Talonflame and Mega Pinsir that are weak to them. Stealth Rock can be used over either Toxic or Defog depending on what your team needs. Protect grants Empoleon additional Leftovers recovery, racks up poison and burn damage, and can scout moves from Choice-locked Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Keldeo. Knock Off cripples common switch-ins such as Chansey and Ferrothorn, and gives Empoleon a way to deal a lot of damage against some of the Pokemon it walls, such as Latios and Starmie. Yawn can force switches because the opponent does not want their Pokemon asleep, makes Empoleon not a sitting duck against Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and last-Pokemon Clefable's, and grants setup opportunities for teammates. Set Details ======== The given EV spread maximizes Empoleon's special bulk so it can effectively wall a lot of threatening Pokemon in OU, such as Latios, Latias, Sylveon, and Mega Altaria. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 200 Def / 60 SpD with a Bold nature can be used, as it enables Empoleon to live an Earthquake from Landorus-T and a Thunderbolt from Mega Manectric and hit them back with a Torrent-boosted Scald. Torrent is used as Defiant is completely useless, because Empoleon uses no physical attacks, and it can power up Empoleon's Scald in a pinch. Leftovers grants Empoleon passive recovery so it is harder to wear down. Chople Berry is an option as it helps Empoleon against Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir, Terrakion, Keldeo, and Gengar by reducing the amount of damage taken from a Fighting-type attack for a turn. Usage Tips ======== Switch Empoleon in against Dragon-, Fairy-, and Water-type Pokemon such as Latios, Sylveon, and Manaphy, and set up Stealth Rock or use Defog against them. Empoleon works best as a defensive pivot, switching into common Pokemon such as non-Superpower Azumarill, Heatran, and Clefable, and forcing them out. Empoleon also does great against rain teams as it can check non-Low Kick Kabutops, Omastar, and Kingdra. It is important to avoid Knock Off and burns, because Empoleon has no reliable recovery and is thus not very hard to wear down. It is also favorable to not let the opponent stack too much layers of Spikes, as Empoleon is already worn down easily. Just clicking Scald is almost never a bad idea, as the 30% chance to burn is very useful in wearing the opponent down and crippling physical attackers that might try to switch in. Team Options ======== Clerics, especially Clefable as it has the best type synergy with Empoleon, are great teammates because they can keep Empoleon healthy with Wish and Heal Bell. Pokemon such as Talonflame and Victini appreciate Empoleon's ability to remove Stealth Rock and other entry hazards. Fire- and Grass-types such as Talonflame and Amoonguss can form a Fire / Water / Grass core together with Empoleon that covers each other's weaknesses very well. Similarly, Dragon- and Fairy-types such as Garchomp and Clefable can form a Dragon / Fairy / Steel core together with Empoleon that also covers each other's weaknesses very well. Empoleon also forms a good core with with Tangrowth and Zapdos as they have great type synergy.</p> "

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon has a useful niche as a defensive Pokemon in the OU metagame, boasting an excellent defensive typing, decent bulk, a Water immunity due to Storm Drain, and reliable recovery. Due to these traits, it can handle a multitude of common OU threats, including Keldeo, Thundurus, non-Grass Knot Mega Metagross, Mega Manectric, and Rotom-W, and is quite possibly the best answer in existence to powerful Swift Swim users in the rain. Unfortunately, Gastrodon's raw bulk is not exactly outstanding, leaving it unable to tank hits from Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny with even full defensive investment. It also faces some competition with other bulky Ground- and Water-types for a teamslot; though Gastrodon has a unique niche, it can be difficult to justify using it in lieu of other options at times.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Clear Smog can remove stat boosts from sweepers, but it is rather weak and has no purpose other than this. Offensive Life Orb or Choice Specs sets are options as Gastrodon has a usable Special Attack stat, but they are mostly outclassed by wall Gastrodon. Yawn can force switches or induce sleep. Stockpile skyrockets Gastrodon's defenses, but it fails to find a space on Gastrodon's moveset.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn take very little damage from Gastrodon's attacks, OHKO with their respective STAB moves, and are immune to poison. More offensive Grass-types such as Breloom and Serperior can switch in on Gastrodon's STAB combination, but the former doesn't appreciate being burned by Scald. Celebi is the best answer thanks to Natural Cure ridding it of burns from Scald or poison.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls such as Chansey take pitiful amounts of damage from Gastrodon's attacks. Also, Toxic doesn't cripple Chansey due to Natural Cure.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Special attackers such as Latios can break through Gastrodon. Thundurus and Mega Charizard Y can hit Gastrodon hard with Grass Knot and Solar Beam, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Due to its low base Defense, Gastrodon tends to be overwhelmed by powerful physical attackers such as Choice Azumarill, Dragonite, and Mega Lopunny, all of which can 2HKO.</p> ",

        "name": "Curse",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Curse boosts Gastrodon's Attack and Defense, allowing it to become a threatening setup sweeper. Curse is used over Toxic to allow Gastrodon to act as a bulky wincon that is capable of handling threats such as Calm Mind Slowbro and Suicune, as well as preventing Clefable from coming in freely. Scald is used over Waterfall, as the ability to burn specific checks, such as Ferrothorn, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Scizor, further improves Gastrodon's chances of sweeping. Waterfall is a viable option should your team struggle with Gliscor or Nasty Plot Thundurus. Recover heals off damage that Gastrodon has taken throughout the battle.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread allows Gastrodon to switch into Life Orb Alakazam, Mega Diancie, and Life Orb Thundurus without Grass Knot or Nasty Plot, while the rest of the EVs are placed into Defense to help Gastrodon shrug off physical attacks more easily. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Relaxed nature is a viable option should your team struggle with Keldeo, as this spread has a good chance to avoid the 2HKO from a boosted Keldeo's Secret Sword after Stealth Rock. This EV spread, however, makes Gastrodon a poor switch-in to powerful special attackers such as Alakazam and Mega Diancie. Storm Drain gives Gastrodon an immunity to Water-type attacks, notably Scald. Leftovers is the item of choice, as this gives Gastrodon passive recovery.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Using Scald early and often is a good strategy should Gastrodon be at a good health. Burning potential threats and switch-ins not only eases Gastrodon's time sweeping later in the game but also helps it wear down the opposing team. If the opponent has a Grass-type with Natural Cure or Regenerator, Scald might not be your best bet, as the foe can shrug off a burn and force Gastrodon out. Keep Gastrodon at a high health whenever possible to allow it to continuously switch into opposing Pokemon. If the opponent doesn't have a Pokemon that requires Gastrodon to set upto beat, such as Clefable or Suicune, then it might be wise to wait and reveal Curse later in the game when the opponent might not expect it. Be careful not to let Gastrodon get statused, as this not only eliminates Gastrodon's chances of sweeping but also prevents it from checking a lot of Pokemon it could otherwise.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fire- and Flying-types, such as Heatran, Talonflame, Tornadus-T, Skarmory, and both Mega Charizard formes, are viable options alongside Gastrodon, as they are capable of reliably switching into Grass-types that can scare Gastrodon out. Latios can switch into some Grass-types, such as Mega Venusaur, and check Keldeo, which will allow Gastrodon to run its usual EV spread over one to check Keldeo. Fairy- and Steel-types such as Clefable, Mega Altaria, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor are good options, as Recover Latios is a problem no matter what Gastrodon's EV spread is. Clerics and status absorbers, such as Clefable and Mega Altaria, can absorb status ailments that would otherwise cripple Gastrodon. Mega Sableye is another good teammate, as it can neutralize Ferrothorn and reliably switch into it. Mega Sableye also struggles against Pokemon such as Keldeo and Mega Diancie, both of which Gastrodon can handle depending on its EV spread.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is a Water-type STAB move that has a high chance to burn, which is good for crippling physical threats. Earthquake is a Ground-type STAB move that hits Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Keldeo for good damage; it is preferred over Earth Power because it doesn't have to worry about being unable to break Keldeo's Calm Mind-enhanced Substitutes. Ice Beam is an alternative that hits Garchomp and Dragonite decently hard. Toxic is ideal for a wall such as Gastrodon, as it slowly wears at the opponent's Pokemon. Recover is reliable recovery, and it helps rack up Toxic damage. Counter is an option to prevent Gastrodon from being overwhelmed easily by physical attackers, as it can usually tank at least one hit and proceed to net a surprise KO with Counter.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs max out Gastrodon's HP, adding to its bulk, while 252 Defense EVs with a Relaxed nature max out its Defense to handle threats such as Keldeo. Storm Drain gives an immunity to Water-type attacks, with a situational boost to Special Attack. Leftovers provides passive recovery. A Relaxed nature should be run if Earthquake is used.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Gastrodon best functions as a physical wall that stays in to burn physical attackers or stall with Toxic to cripple foes. While Gastrodon is still healthy, use Scald early-game to possibly get a burn on its checks. Recover is best used to rack up Toxic damage on opposing Pokemon and should be used to ensure it stays healthy. Gastrodon can switch into a predicted Water-type attack and get a free Special Attack boost, which guarantees Ice Beam OHKOes Garchomp. Gastrodon can also take hits from most physical attackers, so stay in on a physical attack and either attempt to burn the physical attacker with Scald or cripple it with Toxic. However, be wary when facing hard hitting attackers such as Choice Band Azumarill, as Play Rough 2HKOes.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>With Sludge Bomb, Mega Venusaur can counter opposing Grass-types, such as Breloom and Serpeior, both of which threaten Gastrodon. Ferrothorn also performs well this role, and makes up for not being able to counter Breloom with being able to set up entry hazards. Heatran can take on most special attackers that can break through Gastrodon, while Gastrodon can switch in Water- and Ground-types such as Keldeo and Hippowdon. Talonflame appreciates Gastrodon's ability to switch in Electric- and Water-types, most notably Rotom-W, while Talonflame breaks past answers to Gastrodon such as Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Serperior. Chansey and Clefable work well with Gastrodon, as both take on special attackers such as Latios and Mega Diancie with ease and can absorb status effects thanks to Natural Cure and Magic Guard, respectively. Skarmory has good defensive synergy with Gastrodon, as Gastrodon takes both Electric- and Fire-type attacks for Skarmory, while Skarmory takes Grass-type attacks directed at Gastrodon, as well as being able to set up hazards.</p> "

  "Lopunny": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Lopunny has quickly cemented itself as one of the best new Mega Evolutions in OU. Its excellent Speed tier enables it to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame, and it has access to two powerful STAB moves backed up by a very respectable base 136 Attack. Furthermore, Scrappy gives it perfect coverage with its STAB types alone (bar against Shedinja, which is extremely uncommon in OU), giving it two completely free slots where it can fit the likes of Fake Out, Power-Up Punch, Substitute, Ice Punch, and Encore. Its combination of Speed and power makes it an excellent tool to use against offensive teams, and its access to Power-Up Punch and Encore make it of use against more defensive teams too, and an immunity to Ghost and a resistance to Dark give it opportunities to switch into the likes of Gengar and Bisharp. However, Mega Lopunny struggles to break past many physically defensive Pokemon due to its lack of raw power and the large number of Pokemon that resist Fighting, which are often found on these types of teams. It is also rather frail, holding little defensive prowess due to its lack of bulk and resistances, and is easily worn down by residual damage from sources such as entry hazards and High Jump Kick recoil.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Lopunny's wide movepool and free moveslots give it a plethora of viable moves to run. Substitute + Power-Up Punch and Heal Bell + Power-Up Punch both enable Lopunny to effortlessly set up on status users. Substitute is more useful against offensive teams due to its ability to scout for switches, while Heal Bell enables Lopunny to actually switch into status users and support its teammates. Encore + Power-Up Punch is also a good combination, enabling Lopunny to set up on Pokemon that are locked into their recovery move. Quick Attack can be a decent option to chip away at faster attackers and Choice Scarf users. Drain Punch can be used instead of High Jump Kick, and it can serve as an accurate Fighting-type STAB move that Lopunny can use without fear against Protect users; it also gives Lopunny more longevity. However, the power of High Jump Kick is sorely missed and forgoing it prevents Lopunny from breaking through a large number of Pokemon. Facade enables Lopunny to take advantage of status; however, it should not be used over Return because a powerful Normal-type STAB move is important to have. Low Kick can be used over High Jump Kick as an accurate STAB move that reliably hits Heatran and Ferrothorn and doesn't fear Protect. However, it is noticeably weaker than High Jump Kick against the likes of Jirachi and Rotom. Endure can bring Lopunny down to 1 HP and Flail gives Lopunny a lot of firepower at that point, but this combination is very unreliable and Lopunny will be KOed by any residual damage afterwards. A moveset consisting of Fake Out, High Jump Kick, and Last Resort can be used, but it loses out on a lot of potential utility, prevents Lopunny from using a Normal-type STAB move other than Fake Out before its other two moves have been used, and forces it to use Fake Out as soon as it is sent out, which makes it very exploitable. Thunder Wave is somewhat usable, but most of Lopunny's checks are bulky Ground-types, so this is generally a poor option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Hippowdon, Skarmory, Chesnaught, Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and other physically bulky Pokemon have little trouble taking Lopunny out in most cases. However, they can struggle against sets that carry Encore and can be overwhelmed by Power-Up Punch. Physically defensive Gliscor and Landorus-T can also deal with it, but both fear Ice Punch. Notably, Cofagrigus can easily take an initial hit, remove Lopunny's ability thanks to Mummy, and completely wall it thereafter.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Physically defensive Fairy-types, such as Clefable and Mega Altaria, have little to no trouble handling Lopunny, as they resist High Jump Kick and can take a Return quite well. Clefable in particular can run Unaware to ignore Power-Up Punch's Attack boosts or Magic Guard to ignore damage from entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types: Physically defensive Psychic-types can take any of Lopunny's STAB moves as long as they have a decent amount of Defense investment. Celebi is a very good answer to Lopunny, though it can be taken advantage of thanks to the combination of Encore and Pursuit Bisharp. Slowbro and Mega Slowbro take hits from Lopunny very easily and deal a lot of damage to it with Psyshock, and the former doesn't even fear Encore sets much because of Regenerator. Physically defensive Cresselia completely walls Lopunny and can hit back quite hard with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarfers and Faster Attackers: Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, Keldeo, Latios, and Garchomp as well as faster Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Sceptile can outspeed Lopunny and take it out without too much difficulty. However, all of these get worn down by Fake Out and cannot always reliably switch in.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Breloom, and other priority users can KO Lopunny before it gets to attack; however, much like faster Pokemon, they can't always switch in very well.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Lopunny can quite easily be forced to take residual damage to the point where it is taken out. Iron Barbs, Rough Skin, and Rocky Helmet users such as Ferrothorn and Garchomp can take advantage of Fake Out abuse, though the former must switch out immediately afterwards for fear of High Jump Kick. Pokemon that carry Protect can use it to force Lopunny to take recoil damage if it uses High Jump Kick, but this can backfire if Lopunny runs Substitute, so it should only be used as a last-ditch effort. Sandstorm damage and Spikes can also chip away at Lopunny's health to some extent.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>High Jump Kick is Lopunny's most powerful STAB move and Return is its most reliable STAB move; the two combined have perfect coverage together thanks to Scrappy. Fake Out is a great move on Lopunny, getting chip damage on faster attackers that can threaten Lopunny out as well as slower ones that are able to survive one hit from it otherwise. It also enables Lopunny to Mega Evolve against faster Pokemon such as Latios and Keldeo. Finally, it enables Lopunny to emergency check sweepers such as Rock Polish Mega Metagross and Mega Gyarados if the team has no other option for stopping them from sweeping than to continuously rack up Fake Out damage. Ice Punch OHKOes Choice Scarf Landorus-T and offensive Garchomp and 2HKOes the defensive variants of these Pokemon. Power-Up Punch is Lopunny's best Attack-boosting move. It enables Lopunny to break past physical walls that are too passive to stop it from setting up and puts a lot of pressure on defensive teams in general. Substitute can be used over Fake Out, as it enables Lopunny to take advantage of the switches it causes and makes it more useful against bulkier teams, specifically helping against Protect users such as Ferrothorn and Heatran. Substitute also pairs up very well with Power-Up Punch, giving Lopunny protection against status and the ability to scout for switches, and enables Lopunny to take advantage of Mandibuzz and Alomomola, which cannot break its Substitute in one move. Toxic is an alternative to Power-Up Punch that enables Lopunny to cripple physical walls such as Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Alomomola. Finally, Healing Wish can be used over Power-Up Punch because it provides fantastic utility by letting Lopunny heal a teammate for free.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Limber enables Lopunny to switch into Thunder Wave users such as Chansey and Ferrothorn. A Jolly nature is vital when using Lopunny; although Adamant provides a noticable buff in Attack, it will then get outsped by some very prominent Pokemon, specifically Alakazam, Tornadus-T, and Weavile.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Fake Out should be used very regularly against offensive teams to get as much chip damage as possible so that Lopunny is not immediately forced out by faster foes. However, you should be more conservative with Fake Out against bulkier teams because you might waste turns and let Lopunny take unnecessary damage from Iron Barbs, Rough Skin, and Rocky Helmet. Power-Up Punch is a very good move to use if Lopunny can sweep the rest of your opponent's team at +1. However, do not use it against foes that are able to deal a lot of damage to Lopunny, unless they are weakened to the point where Power-Up Punch can still take them out. Power-Up Punch can also be used if you need to weaken an opposing physical wall so that another Pokemon can sweep more easily, but doing so often comes at the cost of losing Lopunny. Against offensive teams, it is generally better not to use Power-Up Punch; focus instead on dealing as much immediate damage as possible and causing chip damage with Fake Out. Try to pivot into Lopunny if you can, as although its bulk isn't terrible, its lack of resistances severely limits the number of times it can switch in. Lopunny serves as a very good lead because Fake Out combined with its high Speed enables it to anti-lead Focus Sash leads. However, be wary of Breloom and Garchomp leads, as the former can deal massive damage to Lopunny with Mach Punch and the latter chips away at Lopunny's health with Rough Skin but cannot be KOed by the combination of Fake Out and High Jump Kick.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set functions well on both offensive and balanced teams as a tool to not only threaten offensive teams but also put pressure on bulkier teams. Lopunny needs to be paired with a Pokemon that can take on faster attackers and priority users (particularly Talonflame), such as Heatran. Lopunny appreciates support from a strong wallbreaker such as Manaphy or Gengar that can threaten defensive teams, which Lopunny struggles with, as well as wear down the likes of Gliscor and Ferrothorn. It also pairs up well with Pokemon that like certain physical walls weakened or can, conversely, weaken said physical walls for Lopunny, such as Azumarill, Excadrill, Tyranitar, Talonflame, and Diggersby. Physically defensive Garchomp is an excellent Lopunny partner, as it lures in bulky Water- and Ground-types and can surprise them with Toxic; it can also weaken Talonflame, Pinsir, and Azumarill via the combination of Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet. Lopunny enjoys Wish or Healing Wish support, as it can easily get worn down and be unable to break past bulkier teams. Jirachi in particular serves as a good Wish passer because it can counter Clefable and check Altaria. A teammate that can bait out and weaken physical walls, such as Talonflame, can pave the way for Lopunny to spam its powerful STAB moves. Support from a slow pivot is also very useful to have on a Lopunny team. Rotom-W is a particularly good partner because it checks Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Talonflame, both big threats to Lopunny. Lopunny also appreciates support from strong Pursuit trappers such as Bisharp and Weavile, as they can severely weaken bulky Psychic-types, which wall Lopunny. Stealth Rock and Spikes support from a teammate such as Landorus-T or Klefki enables Lopunny to weaken a lot of its checks, forcing them into a range where they are 2HKOed by Lopunny much more easily, and the support also wards off the likes of Talonflame and Pinsir.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>High Jump Kick and Return are very good STAB moves, the former being more powerful and the latter being more reliable. Substitute lets Lopunny play around Protect users, status users, and defensive Pokemon that enjoy switching into it in general. Encore lets Lopunny take advantage of defensive Pokemon, potentially locking them into a non-attacking move such as Recover, Defog, or Stealth Rock, which enables it to set up a Substitute for free. Ice Punch is Lopunny's best way of handling Landorus-T and Garchomp, which can find themselves switching in on a Substitute only to get hit by Ice Punch the following turn. Drain Punch is decent paired up with Substitute, as it gives Lopunny some longevity and stops it from getting worn down too much. It also removes the limit on the amount of Substitutes Lopunny can set up in one match. Toxic can be very useful for wearing down the likes of Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon, while Endeavor and Flail can seriously damage walls if Lopunny is able to Substitute down to very low health.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Limber is the most useful pre-Mega Evolution ability because it gives Lopunny temporary paralysis immunity. 4 Defense EVs are used instead of 4 HP so that Lopunny can potentially set up four Substitutes in one match. An Adamant nature can be used for more power and a much higher chance to OHKO Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO mixed defensive Clefable, but Jolly is usually preferred because it enables Lopunny to outspeed a few key threats and Mega Evolve more easily against offensive teams.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Return and High Jump Kick are Lopunny's most useful moves by far, with Return being its safest STAB move to use because it has perfect accuracy and most Pokemon that resist it are outsped and hit very hard by High Jump Kick and are therefore unlikely to switch in. High Jump Kick should be used if you need the extra power brought by it compared to Return. Substitute is meant to be used against defensive Pokemon such as Mew and Chansey, as they are more likely to try to status Lopunny rather than attack. It is a particularly good move for scouting Protect users that resist Lopunny's Normal-type STAB move, such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. It is also a good method of scouting for switches. If Lopunny locks a Pokemon into a recovery move with Encore, it should stay in and keep attacking, and when the Encore counter runs out, Lopunny should Encore again until the foe runs out of PP for its recovery move. Keep in mind that Encore will no longer work when the PP of the last move used does run out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set is mainly to be used on offensive teams that need a fast, anti-offense Pokemon that can also provide some degree of team support. It pairs up well with a strong wallbreaker such as Gengar or Crawdaunt, as Encore can enable said wallbreaker to take advantage of a defensive Pokemon locked into a certain move. Lopunny should also be paired with a Pokemon that can switch into common Choice Scarf users and Talonflame, such as Rotom-W or Hippowdon. Lopunny appreciates support from a Healing Wish user such as Latias and Jirachi because it can end up at very low health if it sets up too many Substitutes. Wish support is also acceptable, but Lopunny is too frail to reliably receive Wishes.</p> "

  "Garchomp": {
    "overview": "<p>Garchomp is a dominant force in the OU metagame thanks to its many positive traits including high base Attack, good bulk, an excellent Ground / Dragon typing, a great movepool, and an awesome Speed tier. Said STAB combination and high Attack in particular grants it the ability to punch holes in several balanced teams. Access to Stealth Rock and Swords Dance also allows Garchomp to act as a great suicide lead for hyper offensive teams. Additionally, it is able to take on a more defensive role in which it sets up Stealth Rock and phazes with Dragon Tail. This is bolstered by its Rough Skin ability, which, when combined with a Rocky Helmet, punishes physical attackers for 30% of their HP every time they use a contact move. This is especially useful against VoltTurn teams because Garchomp's Rough Skin ability punishes physical attackers while its Ground typing blocks Volt Switch. Despite all of its positive traits, Garchomp does have some flaws. It has a crippling 4x weakness to Ice-type attacks, which are often seen on faster Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Raikou. Both of its STAB moves can be easily taken advantage of due to the prevalence of Pokemon that resist them, and Garchomp's best coverage move, Fire Blast, comes off its much weaker base 80 Special Attack. Finally, Garchomp has a Mega Evolution that boosts its offensive and defensive stats, turning it into a devastating wallbreaker. However, this comes at the cost of its Speed, leaving it outsped by even more offensive Pokemon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aqua Tail on the lead or Swords Dance set deals a good chunk of damage to Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Gliscor, all of which Garchomp lures in. Using Endure on the Tank Chomp set gives Garchomp an extra turn to rack up chip damage against physical attackers before it goes down. A Yache Berry allows Garchomp to survive a Hidden Power Ice from an Electric-type such as Raikou and promptly KO back with Earthquake. Similarly, a Roseli Berry gives Garchomp an extra turn against Fairy-types, which it can use to set up Stealth Rock or retaliate with a boosted Earthquake.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Hippowdon, Skarmory, physically defensive Mega Scizor, Slowbro, Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, physically defensive Clefable, Mega Slowbro, defensive Landorus-T, Quagsire, Mandibuzz, Zapdos, and Mega Venusaur all have the physical bulk to tank any of Garchomp's hits and either cripple it with status (such as a burn) or outright beat it. However, Swords Dance variants of Garchomp are capable of breaking through many of these Pokemon if they are able to acquire a boost before one of these Pokemon comes in. Additionally, Fire Blast is capable of beating Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor, as it 2HKOes all of them.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Azumarill, Clefable, Sylveon, Mega Altaria, and Mega Diancie are capable of checking or countering Garchomp. However, only Unaware Clefable is capable of beating Swords Dance variants. Togekiss deserves a special mention because it completely walls any variant of Garchomp that lacks a Rock-type move. Azumarill is a decent check, as it is capable of surviving an Earthquake and KOing back with Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Pokemon that naturally outspeed Garchomp and can deal significant damage to it, such as Latios, Latias, Icy Wind Gengar, Ice Punch Mega Metagross, Keldeo, Mega Diancie, Thundurus, Raikou, Mega Manectric, and Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, make for good checks to Garchomp.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance boosts Garchomp's Attack greatly, which allows it to muscle through nearly every would-be defensive check barring a few Pokemon with the Unaware ability. Dragon Claw is Garchomp's go-to STAB move that hits everything for neutral damage save for Fairies and Steel-types. At the cost of locking Garchomp in for two to three turns, Outrage can be used over Dragon Claw for its significant extra power; for example, it typically 2HKOes defensive Unaware Quagsire—something Garchomp will otherwise struggle to break from full HP. Earthquake targets most grounded Pokemon, particularly Steel-types and Fairies, as well as anything hit for super effective damage. Fire Fang lets Garchomp easily break through Skarmory after a boost or two (depending on the Skarmory variant), as well as more efficiently deal with Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Should one want to opt for a means of targeting bulky Ground-types (defensive Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Gliscor, in this instance) over Fire Fang, Aqua Tail can be run in its place. It is worth noting that the combination of Aqua Tail and Outrage is largely redundant, as Outrage with Swords Dance boosts will typically allow Garchomp to beat the aforementioned bulky Ground-types.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment bolsters Garchomp's wallbreaking potential, meaning it can make more effective use of Swords Dance boosts. The remaining EVs are allocated in Speed, which enables it to outpace base 100 Speed Pokemon and tie with opposing fully invested Garchomp when using a Jolly nature. An Adamant nature is worth considering to further boost its power, but the luxury of outspeeding the aforementioned Pokemon is often too good to pass up. Since this Garchomp variant cannot afford the cost of move-locking due to a Choice item, Life Orb is used to further increase its breaking capabilities while still being able to set up using Swords Dance. While often inconsequential, running Rough Skin as Garchomp's ability means that any contact move used on it will be met with slight recoil.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This particular offensive Garchomp set is best used in certain fashions on a case-by-case basis; when Garchomp clearly faces too many offensive countermeasures, it is best used as an early- to mid-game wallbreaker, but it can also serve as a crucial wincon versus more defensive teams that lack clear-cut stops to +2 boosted attacks. Ideally, Garchomp should be supported by some sort of slow U-turn or Volt Switch pivot backbone that allows it to be brought in with minimal wear. This is especially significant given that Garchomp is susceptible to all forms of entry hazards and is constantly being worn down by Life Orb recoil. One should avoid switching Garchomp into moves such as Heatran's Lava Plume, as while probability gives it a seventy-percent chance to avoid the burn, burns mitigate its wallbreaking potential drastically. Finally, aim to use Swords Dance when Garchomp clearly threatens the foe in front of it—most often by potentially OHKOing it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>When teambuilding, one should prioritize pairing this Garchomp with Pokemon that appreciate certain key defensive threats being weakened for their sweeps; Talonflame, Mega Lopunny, Mega Scizor, offensive Landorus-T, and Mega Metagross greatly enjoy the dents this variant of Garchomp leaves in their defensive roadblocks. Key defensive answers that Garchomp attracts are Clefable, bulky Ground-types, and bulky Water-types, so virtually anything that dislikes the presence of those Pokemon will make for optimal partners. Entry hazard support is greatly preferred, as hazards provide a means of further weakening Garchomp's defensive checks. Stealth Rock Jirachi, Stealth Rock or Spikes Ferrothorn, and Stealth Rock Heatran all make for notable partners due to their ability to handle certain Fairies that pose a threat. Slow U-turn and Volt Switch support complements this set nicely; Rotom-W, specially defensive pivot Jirachi, and Landorus-T can all provide said support well. Due to the fact that this set has few commonly found defensive counters, it will commonly be dealt with offensively via revenge killing, so defensive coverage versus notable Garchomp revenge killers such as Weavile, Latios, Choice Specs Keldeo, Ice Punch Mega Lopunny, and Mega Diancie is ideal. Clefable is capable of handling Weavile (typically), Latios, and Mega Lopunny, while Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Assault Vest Tangrowth can switch in on Choice Specs Keldeo and Mega Diancie. Since this variant of Garchomp is primarily a balance breaker of sorts, it lacks the tools to adequately deal with more offensive teams due to its relatively mediocre speed. An offense breaker or revenge killer that synergizes well with Garchomp makes for a solid teammate. Some examples are Mega Lopunny, Weavile, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Stealth Rock",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is great for wearing down opposing teams by damaging foes every time they switch in. Earthquake is Garchomp's main STAB move that deals good damage to most targets, while Dragon Claw hits everything that resists Earthquake bar Skarmory and Togekiss for neutral damage. Outrage is a viable alternative because it has a significantly higher damage output. However, it has the drawback of locking Garchomp in, which can be easily taken advantage of by a smart opponent. Swords Dance turns Garchomp into a powerful early-game wallbreaker that can immediately pressure the opponent and weaken the opposing team, opening up holes for a teammate to sweep. However, Fire Blast is a viable alternative to roast the Steel-types that take little from Garchomp's Earthquake, such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Garchomp's Attack and Speed. A Jolly nature should be used in tandem with Swords Dance, while a Naive nature works best with Fire Blast. A Lum Berry enables Garchomp to set up on bulky Water-types without fearing a Scald burn. However, a Focus Sash can be used instead to guarantee that Stealth Rock is set up, and it is also the better option when using Fire Blast. Rough Skin is the ability of choice to punish physical attackers when they use a contact move. A Rocky Helmet can be used to further improve Garchomp's ability to rack up chip damage, but this is best left to the defensive set.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Using Stealth Rock turn one of the match is the optimal move in most cases, but there are instances where using a different move is better. For example, using Swords Dance turn one against popular leads such as Mew and Rotom-W as they attempt to burn Garchomp with Will-O-Wisp is a great way to severely damage them with a +2 STAB Earthquake or Dragon Claw the next turn. Setting up Stealth Rock as they switch out is also a good move to make if the switch out is obvious. After setting up Stealth Rock, Garchomp should be used to break down walls such as Ferrothorn and Hippowdon so that a teammate can have an easier time sweeping later on in the match.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Garchomp has great synergy with a multitude of offensive Pokemon. For example, Mega Gyarados, Talonflame, and Mega Gallade all appreciate Garchomp's ability to both set up Stealth Rock and weaken key defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Slowbro, and Celebi. Because Garchomp supports its team by setting up Stealth Rock, it is imperative that it stays up during the match. Gengar and Bisharp make for great partners because they are capable of blocking Rapid Spin and punishing the use of Defog, respectively. Furthermore, both of these Pokemon bring other things to the table such as wallbreaking in Gengar's case and sweeping in Bisharp's.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock damages foes every time they switch in. Earthquake is Garchomp's main STAB move because it gets good neutral coverage and hits decently hard. Dragon Tail phazes foes and racks up entry hazard damage. Fire Blast roasts the Steel-types that take little from Earthquake, such as Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Toxic is an alternative, which cripples the common bulky Water-, Grass-, and Ground-types that like to switch into Garchomp. Rest is also an option to increase Garchomp's longevity and make more use of its ability to rack up chip damage with Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rocky Helmet in tandem with Rough Skin punishes physical attackers for 30% of their HP every time they use a contact move. The given EV spread increases Garchomp's physical bulk and gives it enough Speed to outspeed Jolly Bisharp, which is critical against Swords Dance variants, as a +2 Sucker Punch will never OHKO Garchomp, which KOes it back with Earthquake. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 164 Def / 76 SpD / 16 Spe gives Garchomp the Special Defense needed to survive powerful hits from Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Gengar, Keldeo, and Mega Diancie, while still retaining the optimum amount of physical bulk. The Speed EVs enable Garchomp to outspeed neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Bisharp and Breloom, as well as Jolly Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Garchomp is an excellent Stealth Rock setter for bulky offensive teams because it has a great matchup against most leads. It also deters most Rapid Spinners and Defoggers from switching in by nature of its typing. Furthermore, Garchomp is a great check to threatening physical attackers such as Talonflame and Bisharp because it has the bulk to tank their hits while simultaneously racking up significant chip damage with the combination of Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin. Garchomp is also a good early-game phazer after it sets up Stealth Rock, so spamming Dragon Tail to rack up entry hazard damage is a good way to wear down the opponent's team, especially when the opponent lacks a Fairy-type. Finally, Garchomp is a great Pokemon to sacrifice late-game. Should it be weakened to the point where it can't do much, sacrificing it to a physical attacker is a great way to get crucial damage off, especially in the case of a Landorus-T using U-turn.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can take advantage of Garchomp setting up Stealth Rock, such as Swords Dance Talonflame, Mega Gallade, and Bisharp, make for great teammates. Garchomp is great at wearing down Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Mega Metagross, so teammates that can take advantage of this, such as Bisharp, Talonflame, Mega Lopunny, and Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X, pair well with it. Furthermore, Pokemon that appreciate Garchomp's ability to lure in bulky Water-, Grass-, and Ground-types and cripple them with Toxic, such as Mega Gallade, Bisharp, Talonflame, and Mega Lopunny, make for good partners. Fairy-types give Garchomp issues, so Pokemon such as Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, Mega Venusaur, and Bisharp make for good teammates.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance doubles Garchomp's Attack, significantly boosting its damage output. Earthquake is Garchomp's main STAB move that deals good damage to most targets, while Dragon Claw hits everything that resists it bar Skarmory and Togekiss for neutral damage. Substitute blocks attempts at inflicting Garchomp with a status move while also buffering against weaker attacks. It is also incredibly useful for blocking Intimidate, especially against Landorus-T, which is a main switch-in to Garchomp. Fire Blast or Fire Fang can be used in place of Substitute to score perfect neutral coverage, but the utility of having a Substitute is often superior to hitting Skarmory super effectively. Stone Edge is also a viable alternative to hit Mandibuzz and Zapdos, but it should only be used if these Pokemon prove to be problematic for your team. If Substitute isn't used, Outrage is a viable alternative over Dragon Claw for a significant increase in power.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment in tandem with a Jolly nature enables Garchomp to outpace the overcrowded base 100 Speed tier, while simultaneously maximizing its damage output. The best item for this set is a Salac Berry, which activates and raises Garchomp's Speed by one stage after three uses of Substitute. This enables Garchomp to perform admirably against offensive teams because normal revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, and Latios are now outsped and KOed by a +2 attack. 12 HP EVs are needed to ensure that the Salac Berry activates after the third Substitute. Alternatively, investing EVs into HP and holding Leftovers give Garchomp more staying power and is more beneficial against bulkier teams because they often lack ways of reliably breaking Garchomp's Substitute. Using Garchompite with Fire Blast over Substitute makes Garchomp a much better wallbreaker at the cost of losing effectiveness against offensive teams due to the Speed drop.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is best used mid- or late-game when Garchomp's checks and counters have been sufficiently weakened to maximize the potential for a sweep. Bring Garchomp in through aggressive double switches or against passive defensive Pokemon that cannot touch it, such as Heatran and Mew, and set up a Substitute as they switch out or attempt to burn it with a Will-O-Wisp. Slow users of Volt Switch and U-turn, such as Rotom-W, Scizor, and Celebi, are great teammates for Garchomp, as they allow it a safe switch in, especially against offensive Pokemon that Garchomp naturally beats such as Heatran, Excadrill outside of sand, Magnezone, and unboosted Mega Charizard X.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Magnezone is a great partner for Garchomp because it is able to trap and KO Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory, Pokemon that would otherwise give Garchomp trouble. Powerful wallbreakers, such as Swords Dance Talonflame, Mega Metagross, and Swords Dance Bisharp, also make for great teammates because they are able to defeat the defensive Fairy-types that Garchomp struggles against. Garchomp appreciates entry hazard support to ensure certain KOs, so users such as Ferrothorn, Klefki, Heatran, and Clefable are excellent partners. Finally, Garchomp appreciates the utility of slow users of Volt Switch and U-turn to get in safely, so Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Scizor, and Celebi make for great teammates.</p> "

        "name": "Mega Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance allows Mega Garchomp to boost its already stellar Attack to astronomical levels, enabling it to tear apart many defensive teams. Earthquake is Mega Garchomp's main STAB attack, being strong and reliable as well as receiving a boost in power when sand is active thanks to Sand Force. Dragon Claw is a decently powerful secondary STAB move, providing excellent neutral coverage alongside Earthquake, most importantly hitting Levitate users and Flying-types, bar Togekiss and Skarmory, for good damage. While it might seem like a strange choice for a physical attacker, Fire Blast is the preferred option for the last slot to 2HKO Skarmory, which otherwise walls this set. Fire Blast also has the added perk of hitting Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn super effectively. Stone Edge can be used over Dragon Claw or Fire Blast, as it allows Mega Garchomp to hit Togekiss super effectively and is more powerful than Dragon Claw when sand is up. However, Garchomp sorely misses the reliability of Dragon Claw, so Stone Edge isn't worth it most of the time.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack EVs alongside a Jolly nature are used to let Mega Garchomp hit as hard and as fast as possible. Rough Skin is the preferred ability for Garchomp before Mega Evolving, as it can land chip damage on physical attackers such as Talonflame or Bisharp. After Mega Evolving, Sand Force lets Mega Garchomp take advantage of the prevalence of the sand setters, Tyranitar and Hippowdon. An Adamant nature could be used, allowing Mega Garchomp to perform even better against defensive teams; however, this leaves Mega Garchomp outpaced by many common threats, most notably Jolly Excadrill and Mega Altaria.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is ideally used as a mid- or late- game cleaner against slower, more defensively inclined teams, often being able to plow through those teams once boosted. Keep in mind that Mega Garchomp can easily set up on a good portion of Pokemon on the defensive teams it already threatens such as Gliscor and Heatran. However, Mega Garchomp can also be used as an early-game wallbreaker, delivering powerful hits so that it or a teammate can take advantage of these walls being weakened later in the game. Sometimes, delaying Mega Evolution can be beneficial for Garchomp, as its base forme's higher Speed lets it exert more pressure against more offensive teams, outspeeding threats such as Mega Gardevoir, both Charizard formes, and Hydreigon. While Mega Garchomp boasts impressive physical bulk, letting it check attackers such as Bisharp and Talonflame, it should not be the team's primary check to these Pokemon, as it tends to be susceptible to passive damage from the likes of Spikes, burn, and poison. Be wary of lure moves from Pokemon that Mega Garchomp can typically handle such as Icy Wind from Gengar and Ice Beam from Tyranitar, as it has an easily exploitable weakness to Ice-type attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hippowdon and Tyranitar typically make for the best partners for this set, providing sand support to boost the power of Mega Garchomp's Earthquake and setting Stealth Rock to whittle down the foe upon switching and make it easier for Garchomp to wallbreak. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Tyranitar makes for a noteworthy partner, checking Latias, Latios, and both Mega Charizard formes, which can revenge kill Mega Garchomp, while excelling against the offensive teams Mega Garchomp tends to struggle with and appreciating Garchomp's ability to break walls. Pokemon that can set up entry hazards, such as Ferrothorn and Klefki punish foes that switch in, making it easier for Mega Garchomp to break defensive teams. Klefki makes for a notably exceptional partner, as it can lay Spikes, check the Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-types that trouble Mega Garchomp, and paralyze foes to somewhat alleviate the issue of Mega Garchomp's lackluster Speed. In general, Steel-types make for great partners, checking the Ice- and Fairy-types that scare Mega Garchomp. Due to its susceptibility to status ailments, particularly burns, status absorbers such as Clefable and Conkeldurr make for excellent partners. Clefable in particular can paralyze foes, set Stealth Rock, and check the Dragon- and Ice-types such as Latios and Kyurem-B that trouble Mega Garchomp. In return, Mega Garchomp uses the Steel-types that check Clefable, such as Jirachi, Heatran, and Scizor, as setup fodder. Fast Pokemon that can break offensive teams such as Talonflame and Tornadus-T make for excellent partners, as they take on the playstyle Mega Garchomp struggles most against. Excadrill can be used alongside Mega Garchomp, acting as a cleaner once Mega Garchomp has sufficiently broken down the opponent's team, as well as checking Fairy-types such as Togekiss and Mega Diancie that plague Mega Garchomp. However, using both Excadrill and Mega Garchomp means that the team will be incredibly reliant on sand being active, so the team should be built accordingly.</p> "

Earthquake is useful for hitting Steel-, Rock-, and Fire-types super effectively. Fire Blast roasts Steel-types that take little from Garchomp's Earthquake, which includes Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Stealth Rock is a good move for any team because the chip damage it provides enables Garchomp's teammates to break through certain foes much easier. If another Pokemon on the team is running Stealth Rock, Stone Edge is a viable alternative to hit Pokemon such as Togekiss, Mandibuzz, and Zapdos for super effective damage. If using Garchompite, Substitute in the last slot gives Garchomp breathing room against offense while also protecting it from weaker attacks from Pokemon found on bulkier teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Naive nature in tandem with maximum Special Attack and Speed investment gives Garchomp the power it needs to take advantage of Draco Meteor. This power is further enhanced when Garchomp is equipped with a Life Orb. However, should your Mega slot be open, you can run Garchompite to give Garchomp similar power to what a Life Orb would give it, with the added benefit of much higher bulk and no recoil damage; the only drawback is a drop in Speed. When using Garchompite, an EV spread of 16 Atk / 240 SpA / 252 Spe with a Naughty nature is recommended.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use this set to lure in and significantly damage Garchomp's normal checks and counters. For example, defensive Landorus-T, a usually safe switch-in to Garchomp, is easily 2HKOed by Draco Meteor, and Choice Scarf variants are simply destroyed.

It also has good support options in Stealth Rock and Whirlwind, and is useful on sand teams due to its ability, Sand Stream. Its attacks also pack quite a punch for a defensive Pokemon. However, Hippowdon is painfully slow and has weaknesses to common attacking types, such as Water and Ice. Hippowdon also has to rely on Whirlwind to stop setup sweepers, making it somewhat easy to wear down.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A spread with full investment in HP and Special Defense with a Careful nature can be used to handle threats such as Life Orb Gengar, Magnezone, and Mega Charizard Y more effectively, as this spread allows Hippowdon to take two Fire Blasts from full health in sand, or disrupt a predicted Solar Beam with Sand Stream, which is the only ability that should be used with this spread. It can also handle Latios, Latias, and Thundurus. Ice Fang can be used on either set to hit Garchomp and other Pokemon weak to Ice for heavy damage, but it is very weak otherwise, and it is generally better to use Toxic or Whirlwind. An offensive set can be used due to Hippowdon's good offensive movepool but compromising its bulk is not optimal.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Almost all common Water-types, such as Azumarill, Gyarados, Mega Gyarados, Keldeo, and Rotom-W, force Hippowdon out with their respective STAB moves, and Hippowdon can't do much to them in return.

Leftovers is used to provide passive recovery that could mean the difference between getting OHKOed and getting 2HKOed. Sand Stream is the preferred ability as it lets Hippowdon replace opposing weather and double Excadrill's Speed, although Sand Force can be used if Sand Stream is detrimental to the rest of your team. Smooth Rock can be used to extend the duration of Sand Stream, which can provide a sweeping opportunity for Sand Rush Excadrill, which absolutely loves the sand Hippowdon provides, or to give a boost to Mega Garchomp's Earthquake and Stone Edge.</p> <p>A spread of 252 HP / 252 Def gives Hippowdon the bulk to take on Mega Pinsir and Mega Charizard X, while also walling physical attackers such as Garchomp, Excadrill, and Terrakion. Such a set is better suited for stall teams that already have a check or counter to Thundurus and other Electric-types, while being a better answer to physical attackers, such as Garchomp and Excadrill.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hippowdon can function as a catch-all check for both physical and special attackers, such as Talonflame, Garchomp, non-Choice Band Dragonite, Bisharp, and Gengar. Hippowdon can switch into Mega Charizard Y to disrupt Solar Beam, but does not avoid the 2HKO from Fire Blast in or out of sun. Try to keep Hippowdon as healthy as possible if there is a Pokemon on the opposing team that Hippowdon can check, as its low Speed often forces it to take two hits before it can fire off an attack. Hippowdon can set up Stealth Rock several times throughout the match, so you don't have to worry too much about Defog or Rapid Spin. Thanks to its naturally high Defense stat, it can take weaker physical attacks easily. If you see a Pokemon that is badly affected by sandstorm on the opposing team, such as Chansey or Mega Venusaur, always try to take advantage of it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hippowdon appreciates teammates that can take on special attackers easily, such as Chansey and Latias, as Hippowdon primarily checks physical attackers. The former can also rid Hippowdon of any status effect that it might have been inflicted with, while the latter can use Defog to support the team. A form of entry hazard removal, such as Defog and Rapid Spin, is appreciated, as Hippowdon can potentially be 2HKOed after taking entry hazard damage where it would otherwise be OHKOed. Latias and Starmie are good candidates, having solid synergy with Hippowdon. Hippowdon also appreciates teammates that can switch into Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks, such as Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur. In return, Hippowdon can check Talonflame and Mega Pinsir, which threaten Mega Venusaur. If you are using Mega Venusaur, be sure to use Sand Force as Hippowdon's ability because Sand Stream reduces Synthesis's recovery. Ferrothorn can also lay Spikes, which can quickly wear down the opponent in conjunction with Stealth Rock, sand, and Whirlwind. Rotom-W also makes for a great defensive teammate, as it can take Water- and Ice-type attacks for Hippowdon. Mega Aerodactyl is a good partner as sand bolsters its Special Defense, allowing it to either sweep more effectively or become bulky both physically and specially with its bulky build. Mega Garchomp also appreciates sand as its Earthquakes and Stone Edges become even stronger.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Weavile's excellent Dark / Ice typing, high Attack stat, and great Speed tier let it outspeed and threaten common threats in ORAS OU such as Tornadus-T, Gliscor, Serperior, and Garchomp. Additionally, Weavile's STAB moves are able to hit almost every Pokemon in the tier for neutral damage. This, coupled with two powerful moves in Knock Off and Icicle Crash and a high Attack stat, makes it quite difficult to switch into. Weavile is also the fastest Pokemon in the tier aside from Mega Lopunny, Mega Alakazam, Mega Manectric, and the odd maximum Speed invested Talonflame and is able to naturally outpace two of the tiers most common Choice Scarf users in Tyranitar and Magnezone. STAB Knock Off is capable of removing items such as Clefable's and Ferrothorn's Leftovers, helping its teammates break through bulky threats. Weavile is also adept at Pursuit trapping Pokemon such Latios, Tornadus-T, and Starmie. Weavile, however, possesses a very poor defensive typing that is weak to Stealth Rock, and it is incapable of switching into attacks because of its lackluster defenses; thus, it is susceptible to getting worn down throughout the match.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Life Orb gives Weavile the freedom to switch moves, but this results in it getting worn down more easily throughout the match and not maximizing its damage output. Low Kick is able to OHKO threats such as Tyranitar and Bisharp.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mega Scizor: Mega Scizor is able to switch into any of Weavile's moves comfortably and threaten it out with Bullet Punch or U-turn or use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Faster threats such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Alakazam are able to outspeed and OHKO Weavile. Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Latias can also threaten Weavile.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves: Priority moves such as Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, and Mega Medicham are all able to threaten Weavile. Mega Lopunny is also able to threaten Weavile with Fake Out + Quick Attack.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards: Being a grounded Ice-type, Weavile gets worn down easily by Stealth Rock and Spikes and is affected by Sticky Web, which prevents it from performing its role.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Mega Metagross and Mega Scizor are able to OHKO Weavile with their STAB moves. Skarmory and Ferrothorn are able to switch in and threaten Weavile out.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off is Weavile's strongest and most useful STAB move, allowing it to remove items from Pokemon such as Leftovers from Rotom-W, Clefable, and Ferrothorn. Icicle Crash allows Weavile to threaten Pokemon such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T in addition to potentially flinching through threats such as physically defensive Clefable, which would normally stomach two hits upon switching in. Pursuit lets Weavile trap threats such as Latios, Latias, Gengar, and Starmie in addition to other various weakened Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Slowbro. Ice Shard is able to pick off threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and boosted threats such as Mega Pinsir and Mega Altaria.</p> <h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment alongside a Jolly nature and Choice Band allows Weavile to hit as hard and be as fast as possible, outspeeding Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Latios, and Starmie.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Weavile should be used early- to mid-game, utilizing Knock Off to get rid of opposing Pokemon's items such as Rotom-W's and Ferrothorn's Leftovers. Weavile should also only be brought in via pivoting or double switches and should not be brought in on any attacks, as it lacks reliable bulk to do so. Weavile should function as a revenge killer, as it is able to Pursuit trap Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Latias and threaten them with Knock Off. Avoid having Stealth Rock up on its side of the field, as this limits Weavile's capabilities. Weavile is also able to revenge kill setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Mega Pinsir and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria in addition to faster weakened foes such as Sand Rush Excadrill, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Lopunny.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Teammates such as Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, and Serperior appreciate Weavile trapping and eliminating threats such as Latios, Latias, Starmie, and Tornadus-T. Entry hazard removal in Rapid Spin and Defog from Pokemon such as Excadrill, Starmie, Latios, and Latias allows Weavile to remain as healthy as possible throughout the match. In return, Starmie and Latias can switch into Keldeo, which otherwise threatens Weavile. Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Victini are able to threaten Mega Scizor, which counters Weavile. Clefable appreciates Weavile as a partner, as it is able to threaten Steel-types such as Excadrill and non-Bullet Punch Mega Metagross with Knock Off and potentially Pursuit trap them as well, and Clefable is able to switch into Fighting-types such as Mega Lopunny in return. Tornadus-T is a fine partner, as it is able to U-turn out on a predicted switch, allowing Weavile to get in safely, and counter Keldeo, which otherwise threatens Weavile.</p> "

  "Tangrowth": {
    "overview": "<p>Tangrowth proves to be a stellar, albeit uncommon, pivot in OU, thanks to an amazing ability in Regenerator that gives it passive recovery upon switching out, admirable mixed bulk when equipped with an Assault Vest, and solid resistances to common attacking types, most notably Water, Ground, and Grass, that let Tangrowth check many common threats, like Azumarill and Landorus-T. Tangrowth further separates itself from other defensive Grass-types, specifically Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur, thanks to its resistance to Ground, which makes it a far more effective check to common Ground-type attackers like Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Garchomp. Furthermore, Tangrowth makes up for its lack of offensive presence with its immense longevity and ability to whittle the foe down with moves such as Knock Off and Giga Drain, meaning that it will often outlast the foe if used effectively. However, Tangrowth is ultimately held back by its weakness to common attacking types such as Fire, Flying, and Ice, making it vulnerable to common attackers such as Talonflame, Tornadus-T, and Kyurem-B. Tangrowth also faces immense competition from its fellow bulky Grass-types, Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur, which boast useful resistances to Fighting and Fairy, alongside Spore and Thick Fat, respectively. On top of all this, Tangrowth is a relatively passive Pokemon, as its moves either have low Base Power, in the case of Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Fire, or come with unwanted side effects, in the case of Leaf Storm.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sludge Bomb is a viable alternative on the Assault Vest set, acting as Tangrowth's best way to hit Fairy- and Grass-types, most notably Clefable, Mega Altaria, and Serperior. Rock Slide can be used to hit Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Tornadus-T on the switch, but the moveslot can usually be put to better use.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types: Flying-types, most notably Talonflame, Tornadus-T and Mega Pinsir, take little damage from Tangrowth's attacks, barring the uncommon Rock Slide, and can OHKO it with a powerful STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Due to Tangrowth's lackluster Special Defense and vulnerability to Fire-type attacks, Fire-types such as Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran make for fine answers to it. However, Heatran can be heavily damaged by Earthquake, while Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona must watch out for the uncommon Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types, particularly Mega Altaria and Clefable, act as prime answers to Tangrowth, taking little damage from its attacks and using it as setup fodder. They must, however, be wary of the uncommon Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn all wall Tangrowth and can use it as complete fodder to either set up a layer of Spikes or use Swords Dance in Mega Scizor's case, only fearing the rare Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types: Ice-types such as Mamoswine, Weavile, and Kyurem-B can pick off a weakened Tangrowth with a STAB-boosted Icicle Crash or Ice Beam.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sleep Powder puts opposing Pokemon to sleep and cripples potential switch-ins that don't care about Tangrowth's other attacks. Giga Drain is Tangrowth's main STAB move and helps it stay healthy. Knock Off weakens opposing Pokemon by removing their item, which is useful in hindering them from doing their jobs. Hidden Power Fire helps Tangrowth reliably beat Ferrothorn and check Mega Scizor, while Leech Seed can be used to annoy switch-ins and gradually recover more HP, which is especially helpful if you're running Rocky Helmet. Hidden Power Ice helps beat Garchomp and Landorus-T but is best used if your team is weak to Gliscor. Earthquake hits Heatran on the switch, whittles down Mega Metagross, and hits Excadrill harder than Giga Drain. Stun Spore can be used as a secondary status option to cripple Pokemon that think they are safe after Sleep Powder has been used. Toxic is also an option if your team is weak to Calm Mind Slowbro or Fire-types like Talonflame.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The HP EVs increase Tangrowth's overall bulk and maximize Regenerator recovery, while the Special Defense EVs allow Tangrowth to survive Life Orb Starmie's Ice Beam. The rest of the EVs are poured into Defense to maximize physical bulk so that Tangrowth can better check Excadrill, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gyarados, among other Pokemon. A Relaxed nature boosts Defense and allows Tangrowth to use both physical and special moves without either being weakened, and Tangrowth doesn't need its subpar Speed for much anyway. Rocky Helmet allows Tangrowth to wear down physical attackers it pivots into such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, and Excadrill. Leftovers is an alternative for additional passive recovery.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switch Tangrowth into Pokemon like Excadrill, Mega Metagross, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gyarados, since it is a great check to them. Early-game, Knock Off is one of the better moves to use, as very few Pokemon appreciate switching into it. It is particularly helpful for wearing down Heatran and forcing Clefable to use Soft-Boiled more often. After items have been removed early-game with Knock Off, utilize Tangrowth as a pivot by switching into threats it walls and subsequently double out on a predicted switch to maximize the use of Regenerator and keep up momentum. Sleep Powder should be utilized to cripple threats that could potentially get out of hand and catch switch-ins like Talonflame and Tornadus-T off guard. Leech Seed should be used when you predict a switch to Pokemon like Heatran, which has no reliable recovery. It's also helpful for staying healthier against really strong attackers like Mega Metagross. Coverage moves should be used sparingly, since they are not particularly powerful. In a pinch, Tangrowth can be used to stomach almost any physical attack and retaliate with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore. As an example, Tangrowth can actually tank Jolly Mega Charizard X's Flare Blitz from full HP, although this is not generally advised.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Other pivots like Rotom-W, Slowbro, Slowking, and Tornadus-T work great with Tangrowth by covering each other's type weaknesses and providing momentum, as well as being difficult to wear down thanks to the latter three's access to Regenerator. Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Mega Diancie make for excellent partners, since they check Flying- and Fire-types for Tangrowth, which in turn checks Ground- and Water-types for them very well. Latios removes entry hazards, which inhibit Tangrowth's Regenerator recovery, and it checks Mega Charizard Y and Keldeo. Heatran checks Fire- and Flying-types while Tangrowth can check Ground- and Water-types. Tangrowth is a nice switch-in to physical priority users that might threaten Mega Alakazam, which handily defeats Mega Venusaur for Tangrowth. Mega Charizard X can check opposing Grass- and Steel-types for Tangrowth, as well as absorb Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W, while Tangrowth can switch into the majority of Mega Charizard X's checks.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leaf Storm provides Tangrowth with a powerful STAB attack, hitting most foes that do not resist it for respectable amounts of damage; however, it comes at the cost of lowering Tangrowth's Special Attack upon use. If consistency is valued over power, Giga Drain can be used in its place, but Giga Drain cannot OHKO either Mega Gyarados or Manaphy after Stealth Rock damage, making Tangrowth a weaker check to them. Knock Off is used to take advantage of the fact that many of Tangrowth's checks, particularly Tornadus-T and Chansey, are reliant on their item to perform optimally, crippling them for the rest of the game. Earthquake is Tangrowth's best option to hit Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X and Heatran, as well as Electric-types such as Magnezone and Raikou. Hidden Power Ice is the preferred option for the last slot, as it allows Tangrowth to better check Landorus-T and Garchomp; however, Hidden Power Fire can be used in its place to hit Ferrothorn and Scizor, which otherwise wall Tangrowth entirely.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum EV investment in HP alongside 4 Defense EVs allows Tangrowth to always avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Keldeo's Secret Sword, while the remaining EVs are put into Special Defense to better take special attacks. Assault Vest is used to boost Tangrowth's meager Special Defense to solid levels, allowing it to take powerful special attacks, most notably Manaphy's Ice Beam after a Tail Glow boost and Latios's Draco Meteor, in a pinch. Regenerator restores Tangrowth's health as it switches out, furthering its abilities as a pivot.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Be aware that while Tangrowth's bulk is impressive, it cannot repeatedly switch into many powerful attacks, such as Mega Gyarados's Crunch and Garchomp's Dragon Claw. When using Leaf Storm, you should keep the Special Attack drop in mind, as it makes Tangrowth complete fodder for setup sweepers such as Togekiss and Clefable. Knock Off should be used early-game to cripple foes by removing their items as soon as possible. If the need arises, Tangrowth can take powerful special attacks thanks to its invested Special Defense and the Assault Vest boost, such as Manaphy's Ice Beam after a Tail Glow and Latios's Draco Meteor; however, Tangrowth should not directly switch into them under normal circumstances. While it's not necessary, Tangrowth appreciates entry hazards removed from its side of the field, as they neuter the effectiveness of Regenerator.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tangrowth fits best on bulky offense or balance teams that appreciate both a bulky Grass-type and a check to Ground-types, a role that Tangrowth's main competitors, Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur, cannot fill. Heatran is amongst the best teammates to Tangrowth, as it handles the Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-type attacks that stop Tangrowth, while Tangrowth takes on Water- and Ground-types such as Manaphy and Landorus-T in return. Rock-types such as Mega Diancie and Tyranitar make for excellent partners, checking Fire- and Flying-types that Tangrowth struggles with while Tangrowth resists the Water-, Ground-, and Grass-type attacks that they're vulnerable to. Tangrowth appreciates Rapid Spin or Defog support from the likes of Starmie and Latios because entry hazards, particularly Spikes and Stealth Rock, can easily pressure and potentially overwhelm it. Water-types such as Slowbro and Azumarill complement Tangrowth well, checking the Fire- and Ice-types that burden it.</p> "

Thanks to its impressive bulk and typing, it can take on prominent threats in this metagame such as Mega Lopunny, Keldeo, Garchomp, and Mega Sableye, and with its offensive movepool, which includes Nasty Plot, and good power it can capitalize on its defensive capabilities quite effectively. Its Serene Grace Air Slash, which has a 60% chance to flinch the target, helps Togekiss easily wear down slower Pokemon and function as an effective stallbreaker. However, Togekiss also has several common weaknesses, including one to Stealth Rock, which limit its defensive capabilities—this is further compounded by its Speed, which leaves it outsped by several Pokemon in the tier such as Thundurus and Mega Metagross. Furthermore, Togekiss also has to rely on using weaker STAB moves compared to other Pokemon. It also faces competition from Pokemon such as Clefable and Mega Gardevoir as a Fairy-type.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Wish can be used to allow Togekiss to pass HP to a teammate, but Togekiss's lower HP and Stealth Rock weakness make it hard to use such a move well. Stored Power can be used with significant amounts of boosts, but in general it isn't very useful. Togekiss also has access to Defog to remove entry hazards, but it is not a good user of the move, being outclassed by Skarmory and Latias at such a role. A defensive set with Thunder Wave and Air Slash is usable, but relies a lot on luck, and this kind of set is extremely passive. Togekiss can also run a Choice Scarf set, using Serene Grace Air Slash to serve as a revenge killer, but this set lacks good power. Togekiss has a variety of other options, but few are actually worth using, as Togekiss has several non-negotiable moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types pose a large threat to Togekiss, being able to take repeated Air Slashes and, in most cases, outspeed it due to their immunity to Thunder Wave.

However, all of these Pokemon must be wary of getting hit by a potential Aura Sphere.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Stealth Rock severely inhibits Togekiss's defensive capabilities, making it much easier to 2HKO and limiting its ability to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Poison- and Steel-types</strong>: Scizor in particular can revenge kill Togekiss with its STAB Bullet Punch. Life Orb Gengar can put a heavy dent in Togekiss with Sludge Bomb, and Mega Metagross can revenge kill Togekiss with Meteor Mash. Excadrill and Jirachi can also take on Togekiss with Iron Head, and the latter also takes little damage from Togekiss overall bar the odd Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Terrakion and Mega Diancie can easily revenge kill Togekiss with Stone Edge or Diamond Storm, respectively.

Air Slash is a reliable STAB move that possesses a high flinch chance and is relatively powerful after a boost. Heal Bell allows Togekiss to remove status from itself, which is helpful in handling defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro, and Chansey, as well as supporting its teammates. Thunder Wave is an option in the third slot to paralyze Pokemon such as Keldeo and Mega Lopunny, thereby allowing Togekiss to perform better against faster teams. This also works excellently in tandem with Serene Grace Air Slash. Fire Blast, meanwhile, hits incoming Mega Metagross and Jirachi hard, in addition to OHKOing Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Roost keeps Togekiss consistently healthy throughout the match. Alternatively, Aura Sphere allows Togekiss to revenge kill Bisharp and Tyranitar with relative ease and hit Heatran, all of which would try to switch into Togekiss. However, Togekiss is much better off paralyzing such Pokemon. Dazzling Gleam, on the other hand, is Togekiss's most powerful option against Rotom-W, but is relatively useless otherwise.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With 176 Speed EVs and a Timid Nature, Togekiss can outspeed and revenge kill Jolly Bisharp. 80 Defense EVs and Leftovers allow Togekiss to survive two Psyshocks from Latios as well as two Returns from Lopunny.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With this set, Togekiss should use its good bulk and typing to set up and sweep effectively with Serene Grace Air Slash against slower teams. Togekiss possesses middling Speed, so unless you are running Thunder Wave, it would be best not to pit Togekiss up too frequently against offensive teams, as it is rather easy to revenge kill. Do not attempt to sweep with Togekiss until its counters have been removed, as this is when Togekiss performs best.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Landorus-T is an excellent teammate, as it is able to revenge kill Raikou and Mega Manectric with ease. With Intimidate and U-turn, it can also get Togekiss in safely. Thunder Wave support from Thundurus or Klefki is also very useful to help patch up Togekiss's poor Speed tier and allow it to perform more effectively against offense. Entry hazard removal in the form of Defog or Rapid Spin is advised, as Togekiss's bulk and typing are undermined by a Stealth Rock weakness. Latias and Latios both do this quite well and are also take on Raikou, Mega Manectric, and Thundurus relatively well.

  "Gliscor": {
    "overview": "<p>Gliscor is one of the best Pokemon to break bulkier team archetypes like stall and balance. Gliscor's ability Poison Heal allows it to be immune to status effects when poisoned while also providing it with passive recovery, which is useful alongside reliable recovery in Roost. Since Gliscor's low Attack makes it unable to threaten many Pokemon, it needs to run Swords Dance in order to break through bulkier threats. Gliscor acts as a solid switch-in to common foes like Excadrill, Assault Vest Tornadus-T, Heatran, Magnezone, and Clefable that lack Ice coverage. Gliscor does, however, struggle to deal with faster Pokemon that can threaten to KO it, which includes Keldeo, Mega Metagross, and Weavile.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Taunt is a viable option to prevent setup, recovery, phazing moves like Whirlwind, and entry hazards from going up. This is extremely useful against bulkier foes like Chansey and Skarmory that rely on recovery to not faint. Knock Off is also worth mentioning, as it's able to remove your foe's items while also hitting Pokemon like Gengar and Skarmory for more damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types and Ice-type Moves: Strong Water-types like Crawdaunt, Keldeo, and Modest Mega Slowbro are able to OHKO or 2HKO Gliscor. Pokemon with Ice-type moves like Ice Punch Mega Metagross, Ice Beam Mega Latias and Life Orb Clefable, and Icicle Crash Weavile, and Hidden Power Ice Mega Alakazam can all OHKO Gliscor. Zapdos and Tornadus-T that carry Hidden Power Ice can threaten and beat Gliscor as well.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Defensive Tangrowth with Worry Seed, Leech Seed, and Hidden Power Ice can wall and beat Gliscor. Slowbro can take on anything Gliscor does while also threatening it back with Ice Beam or Scald. Rotom-W is immune to Earthquake and can force Gliscor to use Roost with Hydro Pump. Mega Scizor is able to survive two boosted Earthquakes or beat Gliscor in a Swords Dance battle if both don't have a boost yet. Skarmory is immune to Earthquake, can set Spikes while Gliscor is out, and can use either Counter or Whirlwind on it. Physically defensive Clefable can take any hit from Gliscor and threaten it back with Ice Beam. Gastrodon can use Clear Smog to remove any Swords Dance boosts from Gliscor while also threatening it with Counter. Quagsire is able to ignore Gliscor's Swords Dance thanks to Unaware and remove its Attack boosts with Haze.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Strong attackers like Mega Charizard Y, Ice Punch Mega Lopunny, Serperior, and Choice Specs Latios are able to outspeed and threaten to 2HKO or OHKO Gliscor. However, Gliscor is usually able to take at least one hit from these heavy hitters and attack back if necessary but struggles to beat them one-on-one if they are near or at full health.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance allows Gliscor to easily break through defensive cores while also becoming an immediate threat. Roost gives Gliscor a reliable method of healing, making it extremely hard to wear down, especially when paired with Poison Heal. Earthquake is Gliscor's strongest STAB move, hitting Pokemon like Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor for neutral damage and Heatran, Excadrill, and Bisharp for super effective damage. Facade is extremely strong when Gliscor is poisoned and is used to hit Pokemon that Earthquake cannot, which includes Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Zapdos and Pokemon with Levitate like Rotom-W and Latios. Ice Fang should be used if you feel like your team is weak to opposing Gliscor. Ice Fang is also able to hit Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T and Dragon-types like Mega Altaria and Latios for super effective damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>56 Speed EVs allow Gliscor to outspeed Adamant Bisharp. This is important, as 248 HP EVs allow Gliscor to always avoid an OHKO from +2 Life Orb-boosted Sucker Punch from it. More Speed Investment could be run to outpace other Gliscor. The rest of the EVs are thrown into Special Defense to make Gliscor harder to revenge kill while also making moves like Scald from bulky Water-types and Draco Meteor from Latios do little damage. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 156 Atk / 48 SpD / 56 Spe with a Jolly nature allows Gliscor to outspeed Jolly Bisharp and Metagross before Mega Evolving. 156 Attack EVs ensure the 2HKO on physically defensive Clefable after a Swords Dance while also giving Gliscor a chance to OHKO Bisharp without a Swords Dance boost. 156 Attack EVs also give it an 87.5% chance to OHKO other Gliscor with Ice Fang. The rest of the EVs are thrown into Special Defense, which ensures that Gliscor is able to tank an Ice Beam from Leftovers Clefable.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Without being poisoned, Gliscor will be unable to utilize Poison Heal and be susceptible to other status ailments, making activating Toxic Orb very important. This means you should avoid switching Gliscor in on Will-O-Wisp or Knock Off before its Toxic Orb is activated. Use Swords Dance on foes that pose no immediate threat to Gliscor, which includes Ferrothorn, Heatran, Assault Vest Tornadus-T, and Clefable lacking Ice Beam. Use Roost as a way to keep Gliscor healthy and out of range from the foe's attacks. Scout for Ice-type coverage moves like Hidden Power Ice from Tornadus-T, Ice Beam from Clefable, and Ice Fang from opposing Gliscor before sending in Gliscor to check them. Do factor in that Gliscor is able to take an Ice-type move from full if necessary.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gliscor can fit on any team archetype barring hyper offense. Gliscor is weak to Ice- and Water-types, so teammates such as Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Gastrodon pair well with it. Ferrothorn can also help Gliscor deal with Water- and Ice-types and provide Spikes, allowing Gliscor to take advantage of the switches it forces. Mega Latias is a great partner, as it's able to take on the likes of Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y, which both threaten Gliscor, while also appreciating Gliscor's ability to handle threats like Bisharp, Heatran, Clefable, and Mega Diancie and absorb status effects. Pokemon like Mega Metagross, Excadrill, Heatran, and Mega Scizor can help take on Ice Beam variants of Clefable and appreciate Gliscor's ability to take on non-Ice Beam variants of Clefable like Flamethrower sets.</p> "

  "Mamoswine": {
    "overview": "<p>Mamoswine is a solid wallbreaker in OU thanks to its great Attack combined with an excellent offensive typing, that makes it difficult for many teams to switch into. Its typing coupled with decent overall bulk allows it to work as a great check to common Electric-types in the tier. A decent ability in Thick Fat also gives it valuable resistances to Ice- and Fire-type moves and grants it more opportunities to switch in. However, Mamoswine sits at a low Speed tier that, in tandem with relatively low bulk, leaves it a glass cannon that can't outpace premier OU threats. It also faces competition from Weavile, which boasts a better Speed tier as well as STAB Knock Off, though Mamoswine has a more useful Ice / Ground typing as well as more power and bulk. Mamoswine faces further competition from Kyurem-B, which has much more bulk and versatility in addition to much wider movepool and a solid niche as the only specially based Ice-type in OU. Lastly, Mamoswine struggles to break past certain Steel-types, such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Icicle Spear can be run to bypass Focus Sash and Substitute users as well as Multiscale Dragonite and Yache Berry users. Choice Scarf gives Mamoswine better revenge killing capabilities and a surprise factor at the expense of power and the ability to change its moves. A dedicated Stealth Rock lead set utilizing Focus Sash and Endeavor can be used with Oblivious as its ability.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Priority Move Users: Azumarill, Scizor, and Breloom can all threaten Mamoswine with their super effective priority moves, though Breloom is a more situational threat because it needs to run Focus Sash and Mamoswine must be an Adamant variant. Mamoswine also takes a large chunk of damage from Bisharp's Sucker Punch and Talonflame's Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Due to its low Speed tier, Mamoswine is easily outsped Pokemon on more offensively oriented teams and fast, hard-hitting Pokemon that can tank an Ice Shard, such as Mega Lopunny, Starmie, Keldeo, and Mega Diancie.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Slowbro, Rotom-W, Manaphy, and Quagsire can easily tank either of Mamoswine's typical STAB attacks and wear it down with their own STAB attacks or status effects. However, they can be eliminated through the use of Freeze-Dry.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Mega Scizor is particularly threatening, as bulky variants can use Mamoswine as setup bait and KO it with Bullet Punch. Skarmory and Ferrothorn are nuisances for Mamoswine. Skarmory is immune to Earthquake and can tank an Icicle Crash and retaliate with Iron Head or Counter, and while Ferrothorn is hit neutrally by Mamoswine's STAB attacks, it can wear it down with Leech Seed or KO it with Gyro Ball. Mega Metagross can outrun Mamoswine and KO it with Meteor Mash, and Klefki can use Magnet Rise to avoid Earthquake and chip away at Mamoswine. Excadrill and Jirachi can outspeed it and KO it with Iron Head, though both cannot switch in safely due to the threat of Earthquake.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Shard is mandatory, as it allows Mamoswine to revenge kill Flying-, Dragon-, and Grass-types such as Tornadus-T, Mega Altaria, and Serperior and pick off weakened threats. Earthquake is Mamoswine's most powerful STAB move and offers nice coverage in tandem with its Ice-type attacks. Icicle Crash is its preferred Ice-type option, coming with a decent flinch chance with imperfect accuracy. Superpower allows Mamoswine to eliminate more physically defensive Ferrothorn variants which otherwise wall Mamoswine. Freeze-Dry gives Mamoswine the ability to lure in and KO bulky Water-types that it otherwise struggles with. Knock Off is a decent option, as it allows Mamoswine to remove items from its few switch-ins to aid in wallbreaking and cripple said switch-ins for the rest of the match. Stealth Rock can be used for Mamoswine to act as an offensive entry hazard setter, due to its ability to threaten common setters such as Garchomp, Heatran, and Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Mamoswine to hit as hard and fast as possible. An Adamant nature gives Mamoswine a considerable increase in power, exemplified by a high chance to 2HKO specially defensive Skarmory with Icicle Crash, Mega Scizor with Earthquake, and OHKO Tornadus-T with Ice Shard after Stealth Rock. A Jolly nature can be used instead to allow Mamoswine to outspeed Bisharp, Breloom, and Timid Heatran. Thick Fat is the ability of choice, as it gives Mamoswine the ability to work as a check to certain Electric-types and switch into some Ice- and Fire-type moves. Life Orb bolsters Mamoswine's overall power. If running Freeze-Dry, a spread of 240 Atk / 16 SpA / 252 Spe along with a Naughty or Naive nature gives Mamoswine the ability to 2HKO Rotom-W and Slowbro after Stealth Rock, which it otherwise struggles with.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It's best to utilize Mamoswine as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker. Mamoswine can be used to pressure common entry hazard setters, such as Landorus-T and Heatran, as well as hazard removers, through its STAB combination and power. Bring Mamoswine in through use of Volt Switch and U-turn or double switching, as its bulk is decent at best. Good prediction is necessary to maximize Mamoswine's potential due to its below average Speed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mamoswine is often found on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to threaten bulky Ground- and Water-types and pressure Heatran. Magnezone can trap and eliminate Skarmory, Scizor, and Ferrothorn while also offering Volt Switch support. Flying-types such as Mega Pinsir and Talonflame appreciate Mamoswine's ability to lure in and KO Rotom-W and Quagsire and eliminate checks such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Heatran. Mega Charizard X appreciates Mamoswine's ability to pressure bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Landorus-T and its ability to eliminate Slowbro and Quagsire with Freeze-Dry. In return, Mega Charizard X can beat the Steel-types Mamoswine struggles with. Serperior benefits from Mamoswine's ability to threaten Tornadus-T, Mega Altaria, Heatran, and Amoonguss and can break down bulky Water-types in return. Heatran can pressure the Steel-types that wall Mamoswine while taking advantage of its ability to lure in and KO threats such as Rotom-W and Slowbro. Klefki provides Thunder Wave support to alleviate Mamoswine's Speed issues and forms an entry hazard-stacking core with it if you run Stealth Rock. Ferrothorn provides a switch-in for foes such as Mega Gyarados and Azumarill while providing Stealth Rock or Spikes support to aid Mamoswine in its wallbreaking.</p> "

  "Rotom-Heat": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-H is a decent pivot in OU, capable of checking many threats that Rotom-W cannot beat, such as Grass-, Steel-, and Electric-types; more specifically, Serperior, Breloom, Ferrothorn, Scizor, Mega Manectric, and Thundurus. It also checks Fire-types that commonly run Grass-type coverage such as Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona better than Rotom-W. Rotom-H also has access to STAB Overheat, which allows it to OHKO Bisharp and Breloom, two threats that Rotom-W is incapable of OHKOing. However, this means that Rotom-H is completely walled by specially defensive Talonflame, as it no longer has access to STAB Hydro Pump. Rotom-H's Fire typing means that it is also immune to burns, which can make it much harder to wear down in comparison to Rotom-W. However, Rotom-H can be worn down very quickly due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, which shaves off a quarter of its HP with each switch in. Additionally, it struggles to take on common Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Hippowdon, as they can bypass Levitate by hitting Rotom-H with a Rock-type coverage move. Other than facing competition from its other forme as a bulky pivot, Rotom-H must also contend with Heatran as a defensive Fire-type due to the latter's better typing, which grants it a neutrality to Stealth Rock as well as immunity to nearly all forms of passive damage. Additionally, Heatran is able to set up Stealth Rock itself to support its team. However, Rotom-H is able to separate itself from Heatran with Levitate, its access to a recovery move in Pain Split, an additional status option in Thunder Wave, and a momentum-gaining STAB move in Volt Switch.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic is another viable status move Rotom-H can run over Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp in order to cripple bulky Ground-types that can switch into it easily such as Garchomp and Hippowdon. Toxic also cripples other common switch-ins such as Latios, Mega Latias, and Gastrodon and also effectively shuts down the likes of Mega Charizard X and Y, Talonflame, Volcarona, and Mega Altaria. Rotom-H can utilize a Choice Scarf to act as a revenge killer and can cripple the likes of Chansey and Clefable with Trick. Snatch is an option that allows Rotom-H to stop the likes of Clefable and Mega Altaria, as it can steal their boosting and recovery moves and slowly chip away at them. Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit opposing Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, but it forces Rotom-H to drop a move, which it cannot really afford to do. Rotom-H can also run a specially defensive set in order to handle the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Serperior even better. ChestoResto can also be run for more reliable recovery and the ability to cure status, but this means Rotom-H loses out on passive recovery from Leftovers, and it can lose its one-time instant recovery from switching into an untimely Knock Off or Bug Bite.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types: The likes of Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, and Terrakion can quickly shut down Rotom-H with their high-powered Rock-type STAB moves, while Rotom-H struggles to do anything back to them. Mega Diancie in particular has Magic Bounce, which completely stops Rotom-H from using status moves. Tyranitar and Terrakion must be wary of switching in due to the risk of taking a Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types are also annoying for Rotom-H, as they resist both of its STAB moves. The most Rotom-H can do to the likes of Latios and Latias is cripple them with Thunder Wave; meanwhile, Garchomp easily sets up on Rotom-H if it lacks Will-O-Wisp. Dragonite also sets up easily on Rotom-H because it commonly runs Lum Berry. Kyurem-B is also another pain because of Teravolt, which allows Earth Power to bypass Levitate, dealing 4x super effective damage.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Landorus-T can take on Rotom-H fairly well, as it commonly runs Rock-type coverage that can pick off Rotom-H easily. Excadrill can bypass Levitate with Mold Breaker and easily OHKO Rotom-H with Earthquake, while Sand Rush variants can heavily dent Rotom-H with Rock Slide, although Rotom-H OHKOes them with Overheat. Gliscor is capable of setting up on Rotom-H, as it takes little damage from Overheat and is immune to Thunder Wave, Volt Switch, and Will-O-Wisp. Hippowdon, Quagsire, and Gastrodon can also switch in freely as long as Rotom-H lacks Will-O-Wisp, as they can shrug off Overheat easily.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types such as Keldeo, Starmie, Manaphy, and Azumarill all deal heavy damage to Rotom-H. However, Rotom-H can effectively deter them from switching in with the threat of Volt Switch and Thunder Wave, limiting their sweeping potential. Gastrodon and Quagsire deserves mentions as they are immune to Electric-type moves and completely wall Rotom-H.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Mega Latias, and Clefable are completely capable of walling Rotom-H as it cannot do anything to any of them apart from stealing their support moves with Snatch. However, Chansey lacking Toxic cannot touch Rotom-H and Clefable cannot touch Rotom-H without Calm Mind or Toxic, making Unaware and Life Orb variants ineffective answers to it.</p> ",

Volt Switch allows Rotom-H to gain momentum off the likes of Heatran as well as pressure Water-types that attempt to switch in. It can also avoid Tyranitar when it switches in, avoiding being trapped by Pursuit. Pain Split is necessary for recovery and allows Rotom-H to stay healthy for long periods of time; it's also easy to take advantage of, since Rotom-H will lose HP quickly because of its Stealth Rock weakness. Thunder Wave can cripple the likes of Latios, Tyranitar, Water-types, Volcarona, Talonflame, and Mega Charizard X and Y. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple Ground-types, but Rotom-H doesn't need Will-O-Wisp because it doesn't need to cripple Steel-types when it can just OHKO them, unlike Rotom-W.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP EVs reduce damage taken from Stealth Rock and allows it to switch in four times when Stealth Rock is on the field. 220 Speed EVs allow Rotom-H to outrun Metagross prior to Mega Evolution, Bisharp, and Breloom and OHKO them with Overheat. The remaining EVs are placed in Defense with a Bold nature to increase Rotom-H's physical bulk slightly, which also hits a jump point, allowing Rotom-H to take hits from the likes of Talonflame better. Leftovers provides passive recovery which can slightly alleviate Rotom-H's weakness to Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-H should be switched into Steel-, Grass-, and Flying-types to threaten them out with Overheat and Volt Switch in order to cripple them or to gain momentum. If a switch is predicted, use Volt Switch in order to gain momentum, but be wary of Ground-type switch-ins. Rotom-H should also be switched into dangerous threats such as Mega Charizard X and Volcarona so that it can attempt to cripple them with Thunder Wave as soon as possible. Pain Split should be used to stay healthy when Rotom-H is weakened and can also be used to weaken Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Garchomp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard removal is necessary when using Rotom-H, so Starmie, Latios, and Latias are viable team options. All of them appreciate Rotom-H covering Steel-types for them, while they can wear down Heatran in conjunction with Rotom-H or, in Latios's case, KO it right away with Surf or Earthquake. Starmie, Latios, and Latias are also capable of checking Keldeo, which is a big threat to Rotom-H. Pokemon capable of checking Excadrill such as Azumarill, Breloom, Tangrowth, Landorus-T, and even Mega Alakazam all help deal with Rotom-H's weakness to sand teams. Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion can pressure Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Mega Diancie, while Rotom-H takes on Flying-types and bulky Grass-types. Grass-types such as Serperior, Breloom, and Mega Venusaur can handle Water-types, while Rotom-H weakens or cripples opposing Fire-types such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard X, and Volcarona. Fairy-types like Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Diancie appreciate Rotom-H taking on Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn for them, while they handle Dragon-types that can be annoying for Rotom-H such as Kyurem-B, Latios, and Garchomp. Gengar in particular is a good teammate, as it appreciates Rotom-H taking on Tornadus-T for it and can spread status if Gengar is using Hex.</p> "

Its access to utility moves like Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave allows it to cripple physical attackers like Mega Metagross, Excadrill, and Tyranitar or cripple faster threats like Latios and Tornadus-T. However, Rotom-W's low HP stat combined with its lack of reliable recovery makes it easy to wear down and also leaves it weak to status effects such as poison and burn.</p> ",

Volt Switch acts as Rotom-W's main Electric-type STAB move, and it can also be used to gain momentum after pivoting into a threat. Pain Split acts as a form of recovery, but it is unreliable. Will-O-Wisp allows Rotom-W to cripple Tyranitar, Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, Landorus-T, and many other physical attackers. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can be used to cripple fast foes like Tornadus-T and Latios, making them easier to revenge kill, as well as common switch-ins like Clefable.

Alternatively, EVs can be taken out of Defense and put into Speed to allow Rotom-W to outspeed threats like Adamant Mega Scizor and Jolly Bisharp.

Do keep in mind that Rotom-W cannot consistently switch into threats because its lack of recovery outside of Leftovers and Pain Split makes it very easy to wear down. Volt Switch should be used to gain momentum or as a way of getting a teammate in safely. Pain Split can be used when Rotom-W is low on HP and the opponent has a Pokemon with a high amount of HP out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tornadus-T is a great partner, as it can form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W while also checking Grass-types like Serperior that can threaten Rotom-W and providing Knock Off support. Heatran can help Rotom-W deal with Grass-types like Serperior as well as Fairy-types like Clefable that can threaten it as well as absorb Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, which put Rotom-W on a timer. It also appreciates Rotom-W's ability to take on Water-types like Slowbro as well as Ground-types like Gliscor and Sand Rush Excadrill. Mega Charizard Y can help Rotom-W take on Grass-types like Tangrowth and Serperior while also appreciating Rotom-W using Volt Switch to bring it in safely as well as paralyzing fast threats like Tornadus-T and Latios, making it harder for Mega Charizard Y to be revenge killed. Tyranitar can eliminate threats like Latios and Latias, which can both check Rotom-W, and also appreciates Rotom-W's ability to take on Ground-types like Excadrill and Gliscor. Excadrill can help Rotom-W check Fairy-types that can annoy it like Mega Altaria and Clefable while also providing Rapid Spin support, while Rotom-W can switch into Ground-type moves that threaten Excadrill like Earthquakes from Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Sand Rush Excadrill. Ferrothorn can provide entry hazards in Stealth Rock and Spikes and resist Fairy-type attacks from the likes of Mega Altaria and Clefable. Ferrothorn also appreciates Rotom-W's ability to take on Fire-types that can threaten it like Heatran as well as physical attackers that can set up on it like Swords Dance Mega Scizor and Gliscor. Strong attackers like Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny appreciate Rotom-W's Volt Switch allowing them to switch into the field safely.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch acts as Rotom-W's main Electric-type STAB move and can be used to gain momentum or bring in teammates safely. Trick is used as a way to cripple foes, making them very predictable. Hydro Pump is used to hit Ground- and Fire-types like Excadrill, Landorus-T, Gliscor, Heatran, and others. Thunder Wave is used as a way to cripple the Speed of fast threats like Latios, Tornadus-T, and Serperior, making them easier to revenge kill. Additionally, Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple physical attackers or put foes on a timer. Pain Split is also an option as a way to stay healthy, but it is unreliable.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf makes Rotom-W a fast and reliable revenge killer. 236 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Rotom-W to outspeed foes up to Mega Alakazam before using Trick. The remaining EVs go into HP and Defense to allow Rotom-W to take on attacks better from foes like Excadrill, Heatran, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T. Levitate is Rotom-W's only ability, allowing it to avoid Spikes and Ground-type attacks. Additionally, a spread of 240 HP / 16 SpA / 252 Spe with a Modest nature can be run to boost Rotom-W's damage output, but this spread does make it slower than Mega Alakazam.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set can be used to grab momentum via Volt Switch, revenge kill foes thanks to its Choice Scarf, or cripple defensive foes like Clefable and Chansey with Trick, making them very predictable. Because this set is more offensive, it is not a reliable answer to threats like Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, and Mega Pinsir. Pivot Rotom-W into moves that cannot harm it, such as a Choice-locked attack like Pursuit from Tyranitar or Flash Cannon from Magnezone or a Ground-type attack like Earthquake from Gliscor, Sand Rush Excadrill, or Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran can provide Stealth Rock support and help Rotom-W deal with Grass-types like Serperior and Tangrowth as well as Dragon-type attacks like Draco Meteor from Latios, while Rotom-W can take on Ground-types like Gliscor and Sand Rush Excadrill for it. Excadrill can help Rotom-W deal with Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Altaria while also providing Rapid Spin support, making Rotom-W's Volt Switch more effective. Tornadus-T can form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W and can also check Grass-types like Serperior and Tangrowth that threaten it. Mega Scizor can also form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W, checks Fairy- and Grass-types, and appreciates Rotom-W's ability to check Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Mega Pinsir as well as Fire-types like Heatran and Talonflame. Mega Metagross can also deal with Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Altaria while also appreciating Rotom-W dealing with bulky Water-types like Slowbro and using Volt Switch to give it a free switch-in. Clefable can help Rotom-W absorb status moves like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, which otherwise put Rotom-W on a timer, while also appreciating its ability to deal with Clefable checks like Sand Rush Excadrill, Heatran, and Gliscor. Setup Pokemon like Swords Dance Bisharp and Mega Pinsir as well as Belly Drum Azumarill appreciate Rotom-W's ability to chip at fast foes like Latios, Keldeo, and Mega Lopunny while also providing them with Volt Switch support to come in. Pokemon like Rocky Helmet Garchomp and Ferrothorn are appreciated because they can punish foes that can gain momentum with slower U-turns than Rotom-W's Volt Switch, like Tornadus-T, adding contact damage onto damage from Rotom-W's Volt Switch. Both Pokemon are also able to provide entry hazards like Stealth Rock or Spikes.</p> "

However, problems Azelf face are faster Taunt users such as Tornadus-T and Alakazam, as well as being forced to run a Steel-type move or Skill Swap to deal with Mega Diancie.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Azelf's high Speed makes it a good user of Trick in order to lock a foe into a single move, but it has better things to do and already stallbreaks well enough with Taunt. Thunder Wave can be used to shut down opposing sweepers, but Azelf lacks room for the move. Rain Dance and Damp Rock can be used to set up rain for offensive rain teams that want to wait on bringing Politoed in. A special attacking lead set can be used due to Azelf's colorful offensive movepool, but it is almost completely outclassed by Alakazam and its Mega Evolution; nevertheless, Azelf has access to Fire Blast, Nasty Plot, and Explosion to set it apart.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Tyranitar will OHKO Azelf with Crunch, while Azelf cannot do anything back. Weavile and Bisharp will bring Azelf down to its Focus Sash, and both will move first due to the former's higher Speed and the latter's access to Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Once Azelf’s Focus Sash has been broken, it can be easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Weavile and Tornadus-T, Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion and Keldeo, and priority moves from the likes of Mega Scizor, Azumarill, and Talonflame.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal: Though Defoggers and Rapid Spin users such as Latios and Starmie cannot threaten Azelf directly due to the threat of Taunt and Explosion, they can easily wipe out your team's entry hazards once Azelf faints.</p> <p><strong>Fast Taunt Users: Tornadus-T and Alakazam can both Taunt Azelf and prevent it from setting up entry hazards. Fortunately, faster Taunt users are rare.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Sandstorm damage, poison, and burn are all ways to break Azelf's Focus Sash, allowing it to be OHKOed.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit Moves</strong>: Mega Heracross's Pin Missile and Breloom's Bullet Seed are two ways to break Azelf's Focus Sash. However, Azelf outspeeds both these Pokemon, so it will always be able to at least set up Stealth Rock before fainting.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Azelf's objective is to set up Stealth Rock quickly, which it can do easily because of its high Speed. Explosion deals an insane amount of damage even on a resisted hit and prevents foes from removing entry hazards on the turn it is used. Skill Swap can be used instead to steal Magic Bounce from Mega Diancie, allowing Azelf to not have to worry about its Stealth Rock being bounced back, while Hidden Power Steel is an option to hit Mega Diancie for super effective damage and potentially OHKO it, preventing Skill Swap mind games. Iron Tail can be used if netting the OHKO on Mega Diancie is crucial but has a nasty miss rate in return. Taunt allows Azelf to shut down slower entry hazard leads and users of status moves in general.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>228 Defense EVs are used to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Lopunny's Fake Out followed by Return, preventing it from anti-leading Azelf and turning it into dead weight. 28 Special Attack EVs give Azelf a 50% chance to OHKO Naive Mega Diancie. The remaining EVs go into Speed to allow Azelf to outspeed everything up to base 115 Speed, meaning that it can usually set up Stealth Rock very easily. A Naive nature is necessary to maximize Azelf's Speed without cutting into either of its offensive stats. Focus Sash is critical due to the suicide nature of the set, as it guarantees that Azelf will survive a single powerful attack.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Keep in mind that Azelf will almost always be using Stealth Rock and then Explosion directly after. However, if the foe does not threaten Azelf offensively, feel free to use Taunt should Azelf be running the move. Because Azelf is a very obvious choice as a lead, don't lead with it if the opponent has a reliable answer to it, such as Bisharp for non-Fire Blast variants. If facing a Pokemon that can use Azelf as setup bait, Taunt it. However, not many Pokemon can reliably set up on Azelf due to the threat of Explosion. Prediction is key if you are running Skill Swap, as the opponent can decide whether or not to Mega Evolve their Diancie right away.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Azelf finds a home on many hyper offense teams that appreciate its Stealth Rock support. Sweepers such as Keldeo enjoy having their foes softened a bit, thus allowing them to land crucial KOs that they would not achieve without the chip damage. Bisharp can help keep Stealth Rock on the opponent's side of the field because it threatens users of Defog as well as Starmie. Gengar can attempt to spinblock in order to gain momentum against the likes of Starmie, but it can find itself OHKOed by Psyshock.</p> "

Its typing and ability provide a very useful resistance to Fighting-type moves and an immunity to Ground-type moves. Cresselia also has access to Moonlight, which is fairly reliable but is held back by its low PP and the current prevalence of sand in OU. Despite having titanic defenses, Cresselia is very weak offensively, which leaves it relying on Toxic to deal any real damage, and its Psychic typing leaves it weak to Dark-, Ghost-, and Bug-type moves.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Fire can be used to deal damage to Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Scizor, which can set up on Cresselia. Cresselia can set up dual screens, which provides its teammates with easier setup opportunities. Rocky Helmet can be used to punish physical attackers such as Tyranitar, Scizor, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Metagross. Cresselia can use Rest + Sleep Talk as an alternate form of recovery, but it uses up two moveslots instead of one. Cresselia can run Calm Mind sets, but such a set is generally outclassed by other Calm Mind users such as Reuniclus and Clefable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Magic Guard and Magic Bounce: Pokemon with Magic Bounce and Magic Guard can easily set up on Cresselia if it lacks Skill Swap.</p> <p><strong>Weather</strong>: Rain and sand reduce Moonlight's recovery from 50% down to 33%, which makes Cresselia much easier to wear down.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Bisharp, Weavile, and Choice Band Tyranitar do massive amounts of damage to Cresselia and can usually OHKO after two rounds of Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types: Bug-types like Scizor, Mega Beedrill, Scolipede, and Mega Heracross can deal massive damage to Cresselia.</p> <p><strong>Status: Cresselia cannot recover from status without team support and thus is severely crippled by being poisoned or burned.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Cresselia has low offensive stats, so it can be taken advantage of by common Taunt users such as Mew and Heatran.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Moonlight is absolutely necessary on Cresselia, as it needs the recovery to consistently handle threats such as Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Keldeo. However, Moonlight's recovery is cut from 50% to 33% in rain or sand. Psychic deals more damage to more physically defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Mega Lopunny, while Psyshock allows Cresselia to do more damage to Calm Mind users such as Clefable or Pokemon that have more Special Defense, such as Assault Vest Conkeldurr and Assault Vest Azumarill. Ice Beam allows Cresselia to 2HKO Pokemon such as Thundurus while also doing large amount of damage to Gliscor, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Thunder Wave is used to cripple Pokemon that commonly switch into Cresselia, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Bisharp, and fast Bug-types such as Scolipede and Mega Beedrill, while Toxic can be used to wear down more defensive pokemon such as Hippowdon, Rotom-W, Raikou, and Unaware Clefable. Skill Swap is a very solid move on Cresselia, as it allows Cresselia to beat Pokemon that are reliant on their abilities, such as Mega Diancie, which loses Magic Bounce, allowing Cresselia to wear it down with Toxic. Clefable and Gliscor also don't appreciate losing their abilities, as Calm Mind Clefable cannot take on Cresselia due to Toxic damage and Gliscor loses Poison Heal, which removes its useful passive recovery.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Calm nature allows Cresselia to take on the most powerful special attackers in the tier; outside of Mega Charizard Y, Life Orb Gengar, and Tail Glow Manaphy, Cresselia avoids the 2HKO from every special attacker. Despite the low Defense investment, Cresselia can still handle the more powerful physical attackers in the tier, being able to avoid the 2HKO from Adamant Mega Lopunny and Jolly Mega Metagross. Leftovers provide passive recovery for Cresselia, which lets it avoid being 2HKOed by certain Pokemon, such as Nasty Plot Thundurus and Mega Metagross.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Cresselia should be used to check and cripple powerful attackers in OU, such as Landorus-T, Mega Metagross, Mega Lopunny, Keldeo, Thundurus, and Tornadus-T. Cresselia should also be used to spread status and cripple foes, such as using Toxic on Pokemon that are prone to being worn down, such as Hippowdon, Rotom-W, Raikou, and Zapdos.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cresselia only fits on stall or semi-stall teams, as it is too passive to be used on an offensive team. Cresselia likes having teammates that can absorb status or Heal Bell / Aromatherapy users, such as Magic Guard Clefable and Chansey, because Cresselia has no way to remove status without team support and due to this is very weak to status. Other teammates include Quagsire and Unaware Clefable, as Cresselia is very easy to take advantage of and set up on, more specifically by Pokemon such as Bisharp and Mega Scizor. Unaware allows Quagsire and Clefable to ignore stat changes, which means Bisharp and Mega Scizor are completely countered by Quagsire. Quagsire is more preferable, as Bisharp and Mega Scizor have very powerful Steel-type STAB moves that can ruin Clefable, even if it has Unaware. Chesnaught is another option for a teammate, because it is a solid counter to Bisharp and Tyranitar, it can get chip damage on Pokemon with Leech Seed, and it has access to Roar and Spikes which allow Chesnaught to deter setting up and switching. Mega Sableye threatens Pokemon that can try to set up entry hazards or status Cresselia, such as Ferrothorn. Defensive Mega Altaria is also a good teammate for Cresselia, as it can handle both Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y, which can break past Cresselia fairly easily, while also beating opposing Mega Sableye if Cresselia isn't running Skill Swap.</p> "

Ice Beam is for Pokemon such as Thundurus, Garchomp, and Dragonite, as Cresselia can handle all of these Pokemon easily. Lunar Dance allows Cresselia to completely heal a teammate, including their PP, though it makes Cresselia faint.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Sassy nature with 0 Speed IVs makes Cresselia as slow as possible so it can move quickly under Trick Room. Mental Herb is run to guarantee that Cresselia can set up Trick Room at least once a game, while Leftovers can be run for additional recovery. Colbur Berry can be run to weaken damage from Dark-type moves, as Trick Room teams can stack a Dark-type weakness very easily. The EV spread allows Cresselia to avoid being 2HKOed by the most powerful special attacks in the tier, apart from Mega Charizard Y's Fire Blast, boosted attacks from Tail Glow Manaphy, and Life Orb Gengar's Shadow Ball, while also being able to handle powerful physical attackers such as Mega Metagross, Mega Lopunny, and Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Lead with Cresselia to set up Trick Room as soon as possible, as this allows your team to grab momentum, especially against fast offensive teams.

Porygon2 is a very bulky setter, but is passive like Cresselia and is very weak to Knock Off due to its reliance on Eviolite. Slowbro has access to Regenerator and Oblivious, with Regenerator allowing it to constantly pivot in and out of moves to stay healthy, while Oblivious can be used to give it an immunity to Taunt so it can set up Trick Room very easily. Diancie is an effective Trick Room setter as well, thanks to it being one of the few viable Trick Room setters that can set up Stealth Rock. It can also beat Talonflame, which is a very big issue for Trick Room teams because of it practically ignoring Trick Room due to its powerful priority courtesy of its ability. Bisharp and Talonflame are other Pokemon that can work in and outside of Trick Room, which is very useful because Trick Room won't be up the entire game. They are usable in Trick Room because they have access to powerful priority moves.</p> "

Manaphy does, however, have an average Speed stat, making fast offensive threats like Serperior, Mega Lopunny, Latios, and Thundurus threats.

Sitrus Berry is a viable option for an item, as it allows Manaphy to tank more hits from foes. Salac Berry can also be used, boosting Manaphy's Speed and making it harder for foes to revenge kill.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Thundurus is able to threaten Manaphy with a Thunderbolt and take one hit from it.

Mega Venusaur is able to beat Manaphy one-on-one unless Manaphy is running Psychic by tanking hits and retaliating with Giga Drain. Serperior is able to threaten Manaphy with Leaf Storm and can also take a single Ice Beam. Manaphy can, however, tank one unboosted Leaf Storm. Assault Vest Tangrowth can survive a Tail Glow-boosted Ice Beam and return damage with Giga Drain.

Weavile can Pursuit trap Latios and Latias, weaken Tornadus-T, and offensively check Mega Metagross that lack Bullet Punch. Weavile can also remove items like Leftovers from Ferrothorn and Eviolite from Chansey, making it easier for Manaphy to break through them.</p> "

  "Victini": {
    "overview": "<p>Victini's main claim to fame is its access to V-create, one of the most powerful moves in Pokemon. Thanks to this, alongside its wide movepool, it can act as a solid wallbreaker, with barely any truly reliable counters to its name. Moreover, it has a decent typing with good resistances to common types such as Fairy, Fire, Steel, Psychic, and Fighting alongside good natural bulk, which enables it to check big threats such as Scizor, Mega Metagross, Mega Gardevoir, Breloom, and Clefable lacking Thunder Wave. Unfortunately, it suffers from a large number of flaws, such as V-create's Speed drop, which makes Victini very exploitable after using it. And while its Speed is good, it doesn't match up to many OU threats such as Latios, Keldeo, and Starmie, which can revenge kill it easily. Its typing also leaves it weak to common offensive types like Water, Ground, and Dark, which in turn makes it vulnerable to many common Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Azumarill, and Garchomp. Furthermore, its role as a wallbreaker is severely hindered by its weakness to Stealth Rock, as well as the popularity of Choice Scarf Tyranitar, which can Pursuit trap it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Victini can use a Choice Scarf set; however, it's severely lacking in power when compared to other sets, it lacks the typing to revenge kill a lot of sweepers, and its Stealth Rock weakness makes it a poor offensive pivot. Trick Room is an option to take advantage of V-create's Speed drops, but Victini is a bit fast for that.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Pursuit trappers can permanently remove Victini from play, making them big threats to it. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can switch in on any move bar Focus Blast, can OHKO Victini with a boosted Pursuit if it has previously used V-create, and is guaranteed to OHKO Victini with Stone Edge after Sandstorm damage. While Bisharp cannot switch in on Victini, if Victini has KOed something with V-create, Bisharp can outspeed it and OHKO it with a boosted Pursuit. Weavile, on the other hand, just needs a free switch in on Victini to be guaranteed to outspeed it and OHKO it with Pursuit if it tries to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types resist both V-create and Bolt Strike, Victini's two primary moves, making them good answers to it. Mega Charizard X is one of the safest answers to Victini, since it resists V-create and takes, at worst, neutral damage from all of its coverage moves, meaning it only fears an uncommon Psychic-type STAB move. Mega Latias is a surefire answer to the Life Orb set, taking little damage from Glaciate and resisting all its other moves; however, it struggles to switch into U-turn from the Choice Band set. Conversely, Garchomp is a full stop to the Choice Band set thanks to Rough Skin giving Victini a huge amount of recoil; however, it cannot switch into Glaciate. Still, it survives one from full health and can OHKO back with Earthquake, and offensive sets will always beat Victini by outspeeding and OHKOing it. Latios and Latias act as good checks to Victini and deal massive damage to it with Draco Meteor; however, they fear both Glaciate and U-turn. Mega Altaria does a good job of switching into almost all of Victini's moves and doesn't even fear Glaciate much so long as it runs enough bulk investment. Dragonite can take V-create relatively well, but it fears Choice Band-boosted Bolt Strike and Glaciate, especially if its Multiscale is broken.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types can easily take V-create from the Choice Band set; however, they are not good checks to the Life Orb set, since they fear either Bolt Strike or Energy Ball. Mega Slowbro has just enough bulk to take a Choice Band-boosted Bolt Strike, but it goes down to Grass Knot or Energy Ball from the Life Orb set. Regular Slowbro, Alomomola, and Suicune can take V-create and U-turn decently, but are all 2HKOed by Choice Band-boosted Bolt Strike and Life Orb Energy Ball. Quagsire and Gastrodon only fear Trick from the Choice Band set, but they too fear Grass-type coverage from the mixed set. Keldeo can take neither Bolt Strike nor Energy Ball, but it can switch into V-create and OHKO back with Hydro Pump. Furthermore, Choice Scarf Keldeo does not fear Icy Wind, since it outspeeds Victini even after the Speed drop. In the same vein, Starmie can switch into V-create and OHKO Victini back; however, Choice Band-boosted V-create can OHKO the offensive set after Stealth Rock damage, and Starmie can't take U-turn from it at all. Rotom-W acts as a decent check to the Choice Band set, but it can get worn down by repeated U-turns and takes a huge amount of damage from Bolt Strike. Azumarill and Crawdaunt can take V-create from Victini, and, after the Defense drop, OHKO back with Choice Band-boosted Aqua Jet. Manaphy can switch into V-create, outspeed Victini, and OHKO it back with Scald, while Mega Gyarados has the bulk to take any move from Victini and OHKO back with Crunch or Waterfall. Rain sweepers like Kingdra, Kabutops, and Mega Swampert can easily check Victini, especially Kingdra, which takes neutral damage from both Bolt Strike and Energy Ball.</p> <p><strong>Heatran: Heatran's Fire immunity and neutrality to Victini's other common moves make it a good check; however, it does take a huge amount of damage from Choice Band-boosted Bolt Strike.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types naturally act as good checks to Victini thanks to their natural bulk, Electric immunity, and access to super effective STAB moves. Defensive Landorus-T can take one V-create from the Choice Band set and OHKO back, and while it can't take Glaciate from the Life Orb set, if it's running Choice Scarf, it can switch in on any other move from that set, outspeed it, and OHKO it. Gliscor, much like Landorus-T, can't take two V-creates from Choice Band Victini, but it can take one if it's physically defensive and is almost guaranteed to OHKO back with Earthquake. Hippowdon can't take two V-creates from the Choice Band set or two Grass moves from the Life Orb set, however; it can take one and deal massive damage back with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: While they are uncommon, Rock-types usually serve as good checks to Victini. Mega Diancie can take any move from Victini, including Energy Ball, and OHKO back with Diamond Storm. Mega Aerodactyl and Terrakion both fear Bolt Strike and Icy Wind, but they can take any other move and OHKO with Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers and Choice Scarf users: While they cannot necessarily switch into it, many faster attackers can revenge kill Victini, such as Excadrill under sand, Talonflame, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon.</p> ",

        "name": "MixTini",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>V-create is Victini's main STAB move, bringing extremely high Base Power and having perfect accuracy with Victory Star. Bolt Strike is a powerful coverage move that hits Water-types such as Manaphy, Azumarill, Keldeo, and Starmie as well as Talonflame super effectively. Glaciate enables Victini to hit Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Latios, and Latias, as well as certain Ground-types that are physically bulky enough to comfortably switch into V-create like Landorus-T and Gliscor. It can also slow down faster foes such as Keldeo and Starmie, enabling Victini to outspeed them on the next turn. Energy Ball allows Victini to 2HKO standard Hippowdon, Rotom-W, and Slowbro, which otherwise wall it, as well as hit other physically bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Quagsire, and Gastrodon. Grass Knot can be use over Energy Ball in order to hit Hippowdon, Tyranitar, Mega Slowbro, and Suicune harder; however, it deals less damage to Slowbro and little-to-no damage to Rotom-W. Focus Blast can also be used to 2HKO Heatran and Tyranitar; however, both still take a lot of damage from Life Orb-boosted Bolt Strike and Energy Ball, respectively.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb increases Victini's damage output without locking it into a move, making it much easier for it to wallbreak. An Expert Belt can be chosen in order to bluff a Choiced set more easily, as well as prevent Victini from being worn down via recoil, while still dealing a solid amount of damage to Glaciate and Grass Knot targets, but this makes a neutral V-create significantly weaker and requires more Special Attack investment to 2HKO or OHKO the likes of Latios and Landorus-T. Victory Star makes it so that V-create and Glaciate can never miss and increases the accuracy of Bolt Strike to 92%. This EV spread enables Victini to 2HKO Slowbro and Hippowdon with Energy Ball, OHKO defensive Landorus-T after Stealth Rock, 2HKO Latios after Stealth Rock, and OHKO Naive Garchomp with Glaciate, all the while hitting as hard as possible with physical moves. A Naive nature guarantees that Victini will survive Hippowdon's Earthquake from full health after Life Orb and sand damage, enabling it to beat it one-on-one. It also helps against other physical attackers like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Talonflame. However, a Hasty nature is preferred if Victini serves as the team's main check to special attackers such as Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>V-create is a relatively difficult move to switch into, since most Pokemon that resist it either lack recovery and bulk, meaning they can take it only a couple of times, or are slower than Victini even after the Speed drop and can be hit by the appropriate coverage move next turn. This makes it a worthwhile move to use most of the time. If faster Fire-resistant foes such as Latios, Keldeo, and Talonflame or bulkier Pokemon that can easily take V-create such as Heatran, Tyranitar, and Garchomp are still active, try to predict around them. Otherwise, you should only attempt to hit what Victini is facing with the appropriate coverage move. Glaciate is a good move to use on forced switches, since not only does it 2HKO a handful of Victini's switchins, but it also slows down checks like Keldeo, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Choice Scarf Heatran, which eases prediction against them, as they can be hit by the appropriate coverage move the following turn. However, if the opponent is using a Glaciate target, you may want to scout their reaction to Victini before revealing it. This works better on bulky teams, which can give Victini multiple opportunities to come in, especially if VoltTurn support is employed. Grass coverage and Bolt Strike should rarely be used on switches, since most of their targets already take massive damage from these moves and can just be hit with them next turn. The only notable exceptions are Slowbro and, if Victini is weakened to the point where Brave Bird KOes it, Talonflame. Mixed Victini is at its most effective against defensive teams, so when facing those, try keeping it healthy until its checks have been weakened. Against offensive teams, Victini should take advantage of Glaciate in order to help teammates that would want certain offensive Pokemon to be slowed down. Try not to send out Victini when Pursuit trappers are still active, since they can remove it from play, especially Choice Scarf Tyranitar, which switches into it quite easily.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Victini fits well on more offensive teams that require a wallbreaker with the usual defensive qualities associated with a Fire- or Psychic- type, such as the ability to check certain Fairy-, Steel-, Fighting-, and Fire-types. Victini's weakness to Pursuit users and Dark-types in general requires it to be paired with a Dark-type check that can take advantage of these such as Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, or Azumarill. Victini hugely benefits from VoltTurn support, since it has trouble finding opportunities to switch in due to its typing, Stealth Rock weakness, and relatively low Speed. Teammates that benefit from bulky Ground- and Water-types being eliminated, such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Charizard X, Excadrill, and Mega Metagross, appreciate Victini's support. Due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, Victini requires support from an entry hazard remover such as Excadrill, Latios, or Starmie; however, the latter two stack a crippling Dark weakness with Victini. Electric-types like Raikou, Mega Manectric, and Thundurus are also great partners, since Victini can lure the Ground- and Dragon-types that check them, all the while enjoying Volt Switch support. Landorus-T is a good teammate for Victini, since it provides U-turn support to enable Victini to get on the field safely, checks Excadrill and Tyranitar, and benefits from Garchomp, opposing Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and bulky Water-types being eliminated by Victini. Victini enjoys Spikes support, since it can quickly wear down checks to it such as Heatran, Tyranitar, Keldeo, Azumarill, and Suicune, as well as lure Latios, Latias, and Starmie, all three of which are common hazard removers.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>V-create is Victini's most powerful STAB move by far; it is incredibly strong and 2HKOes almost all Pokemon that do not resist it. Bolt Strike is a very strong coverage move that hits Water-types such as Manaphy, Keldeo, Azumarill, and Slowbro super effectively. It also gets good neutral coverage on other Pokemon that resist Fire such as Heatran and Rotom-W. U-turn enables Victini to hit Latios, Latias, and Tyranitar very hard, wear down checks like Rotom-W, and take advantage of forced switches by getting a teammate in for free, thus generating momentum for the team. Trick can disable defensive Pokemon like Quagsire and Heatran. It also lets Victini get rid of its Choice lock, which may be beneficial against slower teams that can easily play around it. Zen Headbutt can be used in order to 2HKO Mega Charizard X, which otherwise walls Victini. Brick Break hits Heatran and Tyranitar super effectively; however, both of these are already hit very hard by Bolt Strike.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Band enables Victini to hit incredibly hard, especially with V-create. It is preferred over a Life Orb because the lack of recoil gives Victini more longevity and makes it harder to wear down, which in turn makes it a more consistent check to the likes of Clefable and Ferrothorn. Victory Star increases the accuracy of V-create and Bolt Strike. Maximum Attack and Speed investment lets Victini hit as hard as possible. A Jolly nature enables Victini to Speed tie with opposing positive-natured base 100 Pokemon, particularly Manaphy. However, an Adamant nature can also be chosen in order to give Victini even more firepower; for instance, it can 2HKO Rotom-W after Stealth Rock damage much more easily.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>You should always remove entry hazards before sending Victini in, since the residual damage will severely compromise its role as a wallbreaker and U-turn user by preventing it from outlasting its checks. V-create should be used when Pokemon that resist Fire are gone or weakened to the point where V-create will KO them. Use U-turn early on in the battle in order to weaken Victini's checks, ease prediction, and let a teammate come in for free. U-turn is especially good against Pokemon that cannot deal much damage to Victini and must therefore switch out. Don't rely on U-turn too much, though, since the opponent may predict it and stay in, preventing you from reliably gaining momentum. Trick is a good move to use if Victini would benefit more from the ability to switch moves than the raw power brought by the Choice Band. It is particularly useful against stall teams, whose answers to Victini are usually severely crippled by Trick. Against more offensive teams whose Fire-type checks lack reliable recovery, V-create is a very safe move to use, unless the opposing team has Heatran or Garchomp. In the latter case, Victini should not be sent out at all, unless your team would benefit from Garchomp being weakened at the cost of losing Victini. Use Bolt Strike when you predict Talonflame, Heatran, or bulky Water-types that are not part Ground-types to switch in. However, it is usually better to use U-turn early on in the battle, in order to gauge the opponent's reaction to Victini, and use Bolt Strike later on.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Victini fits well on offensive teams that require a physical wallbreaker that can weaken Pokemon like Landorus-T and Hippowdon so that other Pokemon can sweep, all the while serving as a decent check to certain Fairy-, Fire-, Fighting-, and Steel- types. Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, and Terrakion can take advantage of Pursuit trappers, which can easily remove Victini after it KOes a Pokemon. Victini is severely hampered by Garchomp's presence on the opposing team in general, so something that can weaken Garchomp, such as Ice Punch Lopunny, Ice Punch Metagross, or Swords Dance Landorus-T, can also help it considerably by quickly and painlessly removing it. Entry hazards are extremely crippling for Victini, since it has a Stealth Rock weakness and must switch out often due to its Choice lock. Hence, Victini should be paired up with a hazard remover, such as Skarmory. Spikes and Toxic Spikes really help Victini by wearing down or disabling checks to it such as Garchomp and Quagsire. However, if they are used, a spinner such as Excadrill is preferred over a Defogger. Bisharp is a particularly good partner for Victini because it not only deters hazard removal with Defiant but also helps wear down other checks such as Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Keldeo. Victini is very weak to sand teams and requires a check to Sand Rush Excadrill, such as Azumarill, Breloom, Rotom-W, or Mega Alakazam. Victini works very well in VoltTurn cores due to its access to U-turn as well as its low Speed making it difficult for it to come in without support from a slow pivot. As a result, U-turn or Volt Switch users such as Landorus-T, Scizor, Tornadus-T, and Mega Manectric are all good partners. Grass-types like Mega Venusaur help Victini handle the Water- and Ground-types it tends to struggle with.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Serperior acts as a powerful sweeper thanks to its great Special Attack and Speed as well as its access to Contrary, which allows Serperior to boost its Special Attack by two stages every time it uses its strongest STAB move in Leaf Storm. Serperior's decent Speed tier also allows it to outspeed Pokemon like Thundurus, Latios, Mega Diancie, and Mega Metagross. Serperior also has access to a decent number of utility moves; Glare allows it to cripple fast offensive threats such as Tornadus-T, Mega Latias, and Talonflame, and Leech Seed can help stall out and cripple Pokemon like Heatran if run alongside Substitute. However, due to a lack of special coverage moves, Serperior is forced to use Hidden Power Fire to hit Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor or Hidden Power Ground to hit Heatran. Although Serperior has decent typing, its resistances are undermined by common secondary STAB moves from Water-types like Keldeo's Secret Sword and Azumarill's Play Rough. Serperior is definitely a big threat in ORAS OU, but it still has a few hard counters that it cannot deal with.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Ice can be used to catch Pokemon that are 4x weak to Ice such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp. Taunt is also an option over Glare or another utility move to prevent entry hazards, setup, recovery, and status moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types: Talonflame can consistently take attacks from Serperior thanks to Roost and threaten it back with Brave Bird. Tornadus-T can take any hit from Serperior and retaliate back with either Hurricane or Heat Wave or gain momentum on it with U-turn. Serperior can, however, cripple Tornadus-T with Glare on the switch. Mega Pinsir can easily pivot into Serperior and threaten it back with Return or Quick Attack.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: If Serperior lacks Hidden Power Ground, Heatran is able to hard wall it. Mega Charizard Y can take any hit from Serperior as well and threaten it back with a Fire-type move. Serperior can, however, use Glare or Leech Seed on the switch and spam Substitute, which can cripple these checks. Like Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona is able to take any hit from Serperior and retaliate back with a super effective STAB move. However, Serperior is unable to utilize Substitute against Volcarona, as Bug Buzz goes through it, although it can still cripple Volcarona with Glare.</p> <p><strong>Amoonguss: Amoonguss resists Leaf Storm and can take a +2 Hidden Power Fire. It is also able to hit Serperior with either a strong Sludge Bomb or Clear Smog, which is super effective and removes the boosts from Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey is able to hard wall Serperior while stalling out Leaf Storm's 8 PP. Variants of Serperior carrying either Taunt or Substitute + Leech Seed are able to beat Chansey, however.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Latios, Latias, and Mega Altaria resist Serperior's Leaf Storm. Latios and Latias are able to threaten Serperior back with a Psychic- or Dragon-type attack, while Mega Altaria is able to beat Serperior one-on-one with the combination of Dragon Dance and Roost. Do keep in mind that Serperior outspeeds most Dragon-types outside of rare Choice Scarf variants, and that it can also cripple them on the switch with Glare.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Fast threats like Mega Lopunny, Weavile, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T are able to outspeed and finish off Serperior. Serperior is, however, able to cripple them with Glare or do a lot of damage on the switch if they do decide to hard switch in.</p> <p><strong>Status: If Serperior gets burned or badly poisoned, it gets put on a timer and into range of enemy attacks.

Glare can be used to paralyze switch-ins to Serperior such as Tornadus-T and Talonflame. Alternatively, Leech Seed allows Serperior to whittle down common checks like Heatran while also restoring its HP. Substitute lets Serperior avoid status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave and eases prediction against switches.

A common strategy with Serperior is setting up Substitute on the switch, using Leech Seed the next turn, and spamming Substitute to slowly wear down the foe's health.

Rock Slide has excellent coverage for Flying-types immune to Earthquake like Mega Charizard Y, Tornadus-T, and Zapdos, and it hits Rotom-W neutrally.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sand Rush, maximum Speed investment, and a Jolly nature allow Excadrill to be as fast as possible, letting it outspeed foes like Timid Heatran and Adamant Mega Medicham while Speed tying other Excadrill outside of sand. Life Orb and an Adamant nature are also options; using both together gives Excadrill a 25% chance to 2HKO Slowbro from full if Stealth Rock is up, makes Iron Head a guaranteed 2HKO on Choice Scarf Landorus-T and a OHKO at +2, and lets +2 Iron Head 2HKO physically defensive Tangrowth.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Activate Sand Rush whenever possible to take advantage of the Speed boost it provides. Use Excadrill to pressure common Fairy-, Psychic-, and Electric-types. Use Swords Dance to sweep late-game or as typical checks switch in at low enough health, like Gliscor and Slowbro, so Excadrill can break through them. Excadrill's Rapid Spin will be the team's primary way to remove entry hazards, but be wary of contact damage like Rough Skin from Garchomp, Rocky Helmet on Pokemon like Tangrowth, and Iron Barbs from Ferrothorn chipping you down.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Sand Rush Excadrill is very reliant on a Sand Stream user, so either Hippowdon or Tyranitar should be used alongside it. Excadrill struggles with common Ground-types like Landorus-T, Water-types like Slowbro, Grass-types like Tangrowth, and Flying-types like Gliscor. Mega Charizard Y can help Excadrill deal with Grass- and Water-types while appreciating Excadrill's ability to spin away Stealth Rock. Weavile is able to pressure Pokemon that Excadrill would normally struggle with, like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Slowbro, and appreciates Excadrill's role as a spinner and check to Fairy-types like Clefable. Serperior can deal with Water-types like Slowbro and Keldeo and cripple threats like Tornadus-T with Glare to allow Excadrill to outspeed them outside of sand. Rotom-W forms an extremely good core with Excadrill, as these two have excellent typing synergy. Rotom-W can burn and chip at Pokemon like Ferrothorn and other Rotom-W and deal with Flying-types immune to Earthquake like Tornadus-T and Gliscor. Tornadus-T is also a great partner for Excadrill, as it helps deal with Grass-types like Tangrowth and Serperior and can remove items from and chips at Pokemon like Rotom-W. It also appreciates Excadrill's ability to absorb Thunder Wave and spin away Stealth Rock, which would otherwise nullify Tornadus-T's Regenerator.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake and Iron Head provide decent coverage to hit Electric-types like Rotom-W, Steel-types like Heatran, and Fairy-types like Clefable. Toxic lets Excadrill put common switch-ins on a timer; these include Electric-types like Rotom-W and Zapdos, Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp, Water-types like Slowbro and Suicune, and Flying-types like Tornadus-T, Mega Charizard Y, and Talonflame.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This EV spread allows Excadrill to outspeed foes like Choice Band Tyranitar, defensive Landorus-T, and defensive Rotom-W and be as bulky as possible to take special attacks; these include moves from Psychic-types like Mega Alakazam, Mega Gardevoir, and Latios, coverage from Electric-types the likes of Thundurus, Rotom-W and Zapdos, and Fire-type coverage that includes Clefable's Flamethrower, Tornadus-T's Heat Wave, and Choice Scarf Magnezone's Hidden Power Fire. You can put 32 Special Defense EVs into Speed to outspeed Jolly Crawdaunt. An EV spread of 252 HP / 212 SpD / 44 Spe with a Jolly nature allows Excadrill to outspeed the likes of Adamant Bisharp, Zapdos, specially defensive Jirachi, Adamant Mega Heracross, and Choice Scarf users like Magnezone and Tyranitar after Knock Off. Do keep in mind that investing more EVs into Speed gives Excadrill less Special Defense, making special moves like Magnezone's Hidden Power Fire, Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor, and Thundurus-T's Focus Blast do noticeably more damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set should be used as a defensive pivot into special attackers such as Clefable, Magnezone, and Latios. Excadrill can proceed to use Rapid Spin against these targets, as they lack a method of significantly damaging it. Use this set to lure in typical Excadrill switch-ins like bulky Grass-, Ground-, and Water-types to use Toxic on them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rotom-W and defensive Excadrill make an excellent defensive core and have excellent typing synergy, as Rotom-W can help Excadrill deal with Water-types and chip away at checks like Ferrothorn and other Rotom-W with Will-O-Wisp. Tornadus-T and Excadrill also have good typing synergy; Tornadus-T can help Excadrill take Grass-type moves from Pokemon like Serperior, while Excadrill can take on Electric-type moves from Pokemon like Zapdos in return. Excadrill invites in heavy hitters including Mega Medicham, Keldeo, and Mega Charizard Y. Latios can offensively pressure out these Pokemon and appreciates Excadrill's ability to take on Fairy-types like Clefable. Mega Pinsir appreciates Excadrill removing Stealth Rock and taking on Rock-types like Mega Diancie and Electric-types like Zapdos. Excadrill's Toxic can be used chip down bulky Water-types like Rotom-W and Slowbro to put them in range for Mega Pinsir to KO them.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Excadrill's main STAB move, being amazing coverage thanks to Mold Breaker allowing it to hit Pokemon like Rotom-W, Latios, and Gengar. Iron Head hits Fairy-types like Clefable and has a useful chance to flinch foes. Rock Slide is used to hit Flying-types, which are still immune to Earthquake despite Mold Breaker, like Mega Pinsir, Thundurus-T, Mega Charizard Y, and Tornadus-T.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed with a Jolly nature allows Choice Scarf Excadrill to outspeed threats like Mega Alakazam, Mega Lopunny, Mega Manectric, Mega Altaria, and Mega Metagross. Mold Breaker allows Earthquake to hit Levitate users like Rotom-W, Latios, and Gengar.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Excadrill is used as a late-game sweeper and revenge killer. Excadrill appreciates when Flying-types like Landorus-T and Skarmory are KOed so it can spam Earthquake. It also appreciates when bulky threats like Mega Scizor, Slowbro, and Ferrothorn are put into range of its attacks so they can't switch in reliably. Being locked into Rapid Spin is a huge momentum killer, and the move should only be used versus foes that cannot significantly damage Excadrill, like Clefable.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Excadrill struggles to break through foes like Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Pokemon that pack Fire-type coverage like Flamethrower Clefable, Fire Blast Slowbro, Heat Wave Tornadus-T, and Hidden Power Fire Mega Diancie and Tangrowth can all lure in these Steel-types to OHKO or chip at them. Water-types like Rotom-W and Keldeo can help Excadrill deal with Ground-types that it struggles with like Landorus-T and Gliscor and appreciate Excadrill helping deal with Electric-types. Electric-types like Magnezone and Thundurus-T can help Excadrill deal with bulky Water-types like Alomomola and Slowbro as well as Skarmory. Other strong offensive threats like Manaphy, Weavile, and Life Orb Tornadus-T can help break through or weaken these bulkier checks that Excadrill cannot break itself.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>An offensive Focus Sash set could be used as a lead to set Stealth Rock and get rid of opposing entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Substitute can also be used to help Excadrill avoid status moves as well as Bisharp's Sucker Punch giving it a free turn.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Pokemon like Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Alomomola can sponge any damage Excadrill dishes out and threaten it back with super effective STAB moves, usually Scald, which has a chance to cripple Excadrill with a burn. Excadrill can deal with these specific Water-types, though, by using Swords Dance to power through with Earthquake or Rock Slide. However, Quagsire can ignore these Swords Dance boosts and threaten Excadrill with Scalds and Earthquakes of its own. Mega Slowbro is able to take any hit from Excadrill and OHKO back with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Flying-types: Skarmory walls every variant of Excadrill. However, if Skarmory lacks Counter, Excadrill can theoretically use Swords Dance to beat Skarmory one-on-one. Skarmory commonly runs Whirlwind, though, which prevents Excadrill from setting up. Landorus-T is able to tank Iron Head from Excadrill and OHKO it with Earthquake. Do keep in mind that Landorus-T usually doesn't have a reliable way of healing back up, meaning it is easy to wear down. Gliscor can also avoid Earthquake, sponge an Iron Head, and threaten to OHKO back with Earthquake. Most Gliscor are specially defensive and not physically defensive, meaning you can break through them with Swords Dance if they are chipped enough. If Excadrill lacks Rock Slide, Zapdos can switch into it and threaten it with Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Threats: Without Sand Rush or Choice Scarf, Excadrill's Speed is mediocre, letting foes like Mega Lopunny, Keldeo, Mega Metagross, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona outspeed and OHKO it. Some of these Pokemon, like Keldeo, are able to take at least one hit from Excadrill as well. However, all of these threats find it challenging to switch in, especially if Sand Rush is active.</p> <p><strong>Contact Damage: Excadrill frequently uses Iron Head and Rapid Spin, which means Iron Barbs, Rough Skin, and Rocky Helmet from the likes of Ferrothorn, Garchomp, Tangrowth, Skarmory, and Slowbro can slowly chip down Excadrill and put it in range for an attack from an opposing threat.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Removing Excadrill's Leftovers means it cannot act as a reliable spinner forever. Removing Excadrill's Choice Scarf makes it unable to outspeed the likes of Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, Mega Metagross, Latios, and more. If its Life Orb is gone, Excadrill's damage is severely lowered.</p> "

  "Seismitoad": {
    "overview": "<p>Seismitoad's solid typing and ability allow it to check and counter many threats in OU, including Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, and Mega Metagross lacking Grass Knot, or to function as a powerful sweeper under rain. Seismitoad has a niche in rain, only shared with Mega Swampert, as a sweeper that cannot be crippled by Thunder Wave. However, Seismitoad has a 4x weakness to Grass-type moves which can easily be exploited by Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn, and very little with which to fight back. It also has a lack of reliable recovery, which means it has limited longevity and an over-reliance on Leftovers or switching into Water-type moves. Seismitoad also faces very strong competition from Gastrodon as a bulky Water-type, but Seismitoad has access to Knock Off and Stealth Rock, in addition to higher Speed and better physical bulk.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rain Dance lets Seismitoad set up rain for itself and sweep, but lasts only 5 turns because Seismitoad needs Life Orb, and also means that Seismitoad loses out on coverage. A specially defensive spread can be run to check special attackers such as Gengar and Alakazam, but the physically defensive set takes on many more Pokemon. Running 56 Attack EVs and a Relaxed nature on the defensive set allows Seismitoad to OHKO Mega Diancie 75% of the time with Earthquake and 2HKO Mega Metagross. However, the loss of bulk is quite noticeable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types resist Seismitoad's STAB moves and can threaten it with 4x effective STAB moves. Mega Venusaur, Serperior, Celebi, and Amoonguss can all easily switch into defensive Seismitoad and force it out, although Celebi and Serperior cannot safely switch into offensive Seismitoad as they risk taking a Sludge Wave.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types can also take Seismitoad's attacks quite easily and stall it out with poison or set up on it. Examples include Slowbro, Keldeo, and Starmie.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Dragon-types: Bulky Dragon-types, such as Latias, Latios, and Goodra, have no trouble taking Seismitoad's attacks. However, Latias and Latios should be wary of Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure: Due to Seismitoad's lack of recovery, offensive Pokemon such as Azumarill, Mega Gallade, and Gengar can take Seismitoad out by consistently putting offensive pressure on it. However, Azumarill and Mega Gallade are crippled by the burns Scald can inflict.</p> <p><strong>Status: While an immunity to paralysis is very handy for Seismitoad, it is very susceptible to poison and burn because they will easily wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Chansey can take any hit from the offensive set and stall Seismitoad out. However, it is 2HKOed if its Eviolite has been removed. Mega Venusaur also can take Seismitoad's attacks, then KO it with Giga Drain. Latias can easily take Seismitoad's attacks, but must be wary of Knock Off.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Seismitoad can find plenty of opportunities to set Stealth Rock up, as it can easily come in on Pokemon such as Electric-types that lack Grass coverage or Pokemon locked into weak or Water-type moves. Scald's chance to burn allows Seismitoad to cripple a lot of Pokemon that try to switch in, such as Breloom. Despite having a Bold nature, Earthquake is the preferred Ground-type STAB move on Seismitoad, as it prevents Seismitoad becoming setup bait for specially defensive Pokemon such as Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo. Earthquake also does solid damage to Fire- and Steel-types such as Mega Charizard X, Heatran, and Mega Metagross. Knock Off can cripple Pokemon such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, and Rotom-W by removing their items. Toxic can severely shorten the longevity of setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Altaria lacking Heal Bell or Refresh, and Mega Gyarados, while also wearing down Grass-type switch-ins outside of Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximizing Seismitoad's HP and Defense allows it to handle many threats in OU such as Victini, Mega Metagross lacking Grass Knot, and Tyranitar. 12 Speed EVs are used to ensure Seismitoad outspeeds Mega Scizor lacking Speed investment. Water Absorb is the best ability to use on Seismitoad, as it completely deters Pokemon such as Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Slowbro from spamming Water-type moves. Leftovers provides valuable recovery for Seismitoad, as it lacks any outside of Leftovers and Water Absorb.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Stealth Rock should be used as soon as possible to punish switches, but only when Seismitoad is in a safe position. Seismitoad shouldn't be switched in repeatedly, as it has a lack of recovery and is easily worn down by entry hazards and powerful attacks. Scald is Seismitoad's most spammable move and should be used to weaken or cripple Pokemon with burn while Knock Off should be used against Pokemon that are item reliant, such as Chansey and Gliscor. Seismitoad can be used to pivot and gain momentum against threats such as Victini locked into Bolt Strike or Landorus-T locked into Stone Edge.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, Scizor, and Mega Venusaur make for good partners, as they can handle the Grass-types that force Seismitoad out, while Seismitoad handles Rotom-W for Talonflame and Scizor. Fairy-types appreciate support from Seismitoad, as it can handle Steel-types such as Jirachi and Heatran. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Rotom-W, Scizor, and Landorus-T can gain momentum for Seismitoad, allowing it to come in more easily and set up Stealth Rock. Scizor handles the Fairy-types that can give Seismitoad trouble such as Clefable and Mega Altaria, while Seismitoad takes on Heatran for Scizor. Steel-types such as Bisharp, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory are good partners because they have decent defensive synergy with Seismitoad. Bisharp punishes the use of Defog with Defiant, while Skarmory and Ferrothorn can set up Spikes. Jirachi can heal Seismitoad with Wish and deal with the Grass-types that beat Seismitoad, such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. Seismitoad is a very useful Pokemon on sand teams as it can provide Stealth Rock and handle Rotom-W, which is a big problem for Sand Rush Excadrill.</p> "

        "name": "Rain Sweeper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is Seismitoad's main attacking move and is boosted even further when rain is up. Earth Power is weaker but more reliable. Sludge Wave allows Seismitoad to deal damage to Grass-types that resist its STAB combination. Focus Blast allows Seismitoad to break past Ferrothorn, which resists its Water, Ground, and Poison coverage, though it has unreliable accuracy. Knock Off can be used over Focus Blast to deal a lot of damage to Latios and Latias, as they can handle Hydro Pump and Sludge Wave and have an immunity to Earth Power. Knock Off also cripples Chansey by removing its Eviolite and gives Seismitoad a good chance to 2HKO it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Seismitoad's offensive capabilities while the Speed investment allows it to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T and the remaining EVs are dumped into HP. Swift Swim is the only reason to use offensive Seismitoad, as it allows Seismitoad to become a very threatening sweeper in rain. Life Orb should be run to maximize damage output, as Seismitoad has a fairly low Special Attack stat. A Modest nature maximizes Seismitoad's Special Attack, but, a Rash nature should be run with Knock Off to allow Seismitoad to 2HKO Latios and Latias.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Offensive Seismitoad should only be used on rain teams, as rain support makes Hydro Pump very powerful while allowing Seismitoad to outspeed the entire unboosted tier. Seismitoad acts as a late-game cleaner rather than a wallbreaker, and so should be used once specially defensive Pokemon have been weakened. Try to only use Seismitoad once rain is set up as it is very slow without the Swift Swim boost and can be easily beaten by faster threats. To get Seismitoad in safely, send it in on Fire- and Electric-type Pokemon that are Choice-locked or do not have any Grass-type coverage as it can take their moves easily and OHKO or force them out next turn. Aim to have entry hazards set before attempting to sweep with Seismitoad to break Focus Sashes and Sturdy and make it easier to net OHKOs. Seismitoad also appreciates VoltTurn support as it minimizes the damage it takes from coming in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Politoed is the best teammate for Seismitoad, as it can set up rain with Drizzle, which is absolutely necessary for Seismitoad to sweep. Manual rain setters such as Thundurus and Klefki are also great partners, while Klefki can put pressure on teams with Spikes. Entry Hazard support from Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Celebi are very useful for Seismitoad, as it helps it net OHKOs and 2HKOs more easily. All three work well in rain, as rain halves the damage they take from Fire-type moves. Seismitoad works well with other rain sweepers such as Kabutops and Mega Swampert as they can handle specially defensive Pokemon that trouble Seismitoad, while Seismitoad can break physically defensive Pokemon that trouble Mega Swampert and Kabutops. Pokemon that can switch into Grass-type moves, such as Tornadus-T and Thundurus, are very useful, as bulky Grass-types can beat Seismitoad under rain. Bulky Water-types can halt Seismitoad's sweep, so Electric-types such as Thundurus and Magnezone are also good teammates. Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr and Keldeo can threaten Chansey and Blissey, both of which are problems for Seismitoad. Conkeldurr can restore HP against them with Drain Punch, while Keldeo can take advantage of the rain.</p> "

  "Cofagrigus": {
    "overview": "<p>Cofagrigus has great natural bulk, which gives it numerous opportunities to set up either Trick Room or Nasty Plot, the former of which complements it due to its low Speed. In addition, it sports a unique ability in Mummy, which allows it to defeat Pokemon that rely on their abilities, such as Azumarill, Mega Medicham, and Mega Heracross. It's got a decent base 95 Special Attack stat, which allows it to deal crippling damage after it attains a Nasty Plot boost, making it a solid option for Trick Room teams. Outside of Trick Room, Cofagrigus's diverse movepool that includes Haze, Will-O-Wisp, and Toxic Spikes allows it to differentiate itself from other walls and gives it a decent defensive set to work with, as it is extremely hard to turn Cofagrigus into setup bait.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Cofagrigus has a couple of other options to play with, such as Memento, which allows it to sacrifice itself but leave the foe's offenses severely crippled, allowing a teammate to set up and take advantage of the situation. Knock Off is a hindrance that can cripple certain walls to Cofagrigus such as Chansey and Unaware Clefable. Magic Coat is an option that reflects status moves and can reflect entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and crippling status such as Toxic back to the opponent's side. Haze can be used to prevent opposing Pokemon from setting up on Cofagrigus, though one must note Cofagrigus is often too slow to take advantage of it properly.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Special Walls: Specially defensive walls such as Chansey, Gliscor, and Clefable can quickly shut down the offensive Trick Room Cofagrigus set due to their ability to tank and cripple Cofagrigus through status while its Shadow Ball returns pittance. Pokemon such as Alomomola easily deal with the defensive set, as it can't do anything back barring an unexpected Knock Off which could cripple them with the item loss.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off Users: Bisharp, Weavile, Mega Gallade, and Conkeldurr can easily do serious damage with Knock Off after Stealth Rock damage, but all Knock Off users fear a burn barring Conkeldurr, which can benefit from it the first turn and severely damage Cofagrigus with a Guts-boosted attack.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fire-types: Fire-types such as Heatran can absorb Will-O-Wisp and normally put a large dent in Cofagrigus. Most also have access to some form of recovery, so Pain Split won't trouble them as much, and Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X can freely switch in and set up a Dragon Dance or Swords Dance to put extreme dents in Cofagrigus.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Almost all Taunt users, especially Taunt Dragon Dance Gyarados and Mandibuzz, can completely shut Cofagrigus down and use it can on as it can only fire back weak and unboosted Shadow Balls most of the time.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Because Cofagrigus's Special Defense isn't too impressive, strong special attackers such as Keldeo and Choice Specs Sylveon can abuse high Base Power attacks to bash through Cofagrigus, all while not fearing a burn.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Mega Medicham and Mega Heracross, making them almost useless and greatly lowering their ability to threaten Cofagrigus's team. Pain Split is Cofagrigus's only source of recovery outside of Leftovers, and while it is a bit unreliable, it can keep Cofagrigus healthy throughout the match. Another solid option is Snatch, which allows Cofagrigus to potentially stallbreak and steal moves such as Recover or Roost for itself if done in the right situation, which, in tandem with status, can greatly hinder the foe. Toxic Spikes is a move that few Pokemon in OU get access to, and Cofagrigus can put this to move to work due to the switches it forces; Toxic Spikes support also has the added bonus of powering up Hex. Hex starts off as a slightly weaker Shadow Ball, but it doubles in power if the foe is afflicted by some type of status, and this is often the case due to Cofagrigus's access to both Will-O-Wisp and Toxic Spikes. However, Shadow Ball is an option if consistency is required, although you will often hit significantly less hard. Rest is also an option that allows Cofagrigus to fully recover its HP, though clerical support is then required for this to be effective.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs and 252 Defense EVs keep Cofagrigus as physically bulky as possible, while the remaining 4 EVs are added to Special Defense for a slight boost. A Bold nature is used to maximize the Defense stat, while Leftovers serves as Cofagrigus's most reliable form of recovery. Mummy is used for its useful purposes in crippling Pokemon that rely on their abilities, such as Mega Lopunny.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Cofagrigus should mainly be used as a switch-in to many physical attackers in the tier such as Terrakion, Hawlucha, Azumarill, Mega Heracross, and Mega Lopunny, as Mummy and the threat of being crippled by a burn almost always forces them out. Using Pain Split smartly on predicted switches prevents Cofagrigus from being worn down quickly. Snatch can prevent setup sweepers from attaining boosts and can steal useful things such Substitutes, so use it whenever Cofagrigus is facing a foe that will probably use a status move instead of an attack. Cofagrigus also functions as a spinblocker if needed, being able to beat some Excadrill and most defensive Starmie 1v1. Mummy also takes Scrappy away on contact immediately, meaning Cofagrigus can often simply switch in on predicted Fake Outs from Mega Lopunny and avoid the brunt of the damage from a devastating High Jump Kick.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Strong special attackers such as Thundurus, Latios, and Keldeo will often capitalize on Cofagrigus's weaker Special Defense stat, meaning that dedicated special walls such as Chansey or Sylveon are good partners that can take the heat off Cofagrigus. These Pokemon also provide clerical support for Cofagrigus by curing it of status or giving it the opportunity to use Rest, which is helpful because Cofagrigus hates being afflicted by status ailments such as poison or burn. Bulky Mega Evolutions such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Venusaur pair well with it, as they can switch in and take Knock Offs from Bisharp, while Cofagrigus works well with any existing Fire / Water / Grass cores. Gliscor is a good choice to take Knock Offs from Bisharp and can deal with stallbreaker Mew, as both foes can't do anything to it once Poison Heal has been activated. Specially defensive Gliscor also counters both Heatran and Clefable, which can trouble Cofagrigus greatly.</p> "

Cofagrigus is an excellent Trick Room setter as well due to its bulk, making it one of its best options to use on a Trick Room team. Shadow Ball is a reliable STAB move to work with, doing severe damage after a Nasty Plot, as Ghost has amazing coverage. Will-O-Wisp lets Cofagrigus cripple physical attackers that it can't KO with Shadow Ball, such as Mega Heracross, Mega Gyarados that lack Substitute, and Garchomp. Hidden Power Fighting is another option that allows Cofagrigus to hit Tyranitar and Bisharp and has perfect neutral coverage alongside Shadow Ball.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs give Cofagrigus quite a bit of bulk, while another 4 EVs are invested in Defense to give it a small boost. 252 Special Attack EVs are used to maximize Cofagrigus's damage output, while a Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs make it as slow as possible, which is ideal under Trick Room.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Offensive Trick Room Cofagrigus should be used on dedicated Trick Room teams, as its bulk allows it to come in on several threats and easily set up a Trick Room or Nasty Plot. Nasty Plot allows Cofagrigus to function as a dangerous offensive threat mid-game, and it is especially augmented by Trick Room. Using Cofagrigus as a switch-in to Pokemon such as Mega Medicham, Azumarill on a Waterfall or Play Rough, and Mega Heracross is recommended, as it can regain your team momentum and threaten them with a burn.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Standard partners that can set up Trick Room such as Cresselia and Porygon2 are needed, though they all share a common Knock Off weakness. Conkeldurr patches this weakness up, as it resists Dark and uses its low Speed in Trick Room to its advantage; it can also act as a status absorber with Guts. Crawdaunt works in a similar vein as Conkeldurr but resists both Knock Off and Ghost-type moves and breaks down walls with its massive power courtesy of Adaptability-boosted strikes. Mega Heracross is a solid Bisharp check and also benefits from Trick Room due to its lower Speed. Unaware Clefable can nullify any Nasty Plot boosts Cofagrigus might gain, so Steel-types such as Magnezone and (Mega) Scizor are good partners, as they can rid the team of it and also benefit from Trick Room, as they are on the slower side. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune also pair well with Cofagrigus, as they can deal with Heatran and cripple the opposing team with status.</p> "

  "Reuniclus": {
    "overview": "<p>On paper, Reuniclus might seem somewhat mediocre, as it has a relatively poor defensive typing and is easily taken advantage of by some of the most threatening Pokemon in OU, including Bisharp, Weavile, Mega Gyarados, Mega Scizor, Mega Heracross, and Heracross. It also faces enormous competition as a Calm Mind sweeper with Clefable, which boasts a superior defensive typing. Thankfully, Reuniclus possesses a couple of traits that give it a niche, the first of which is STAB Psyshock. Psyshock allows Reuniclus to do physical damage to targets and thus win Calm Mind wars and easily damage Chansey. Furthermore, Reuniclus's Psychic typing and bulk, while not spectacular, are respectable and allow it to safely check or counter and set up on many offensive Pokemon, including Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, Mega Medicham, Mega Venusaur, Choice Scarf Heatran, Mega Diancie, and Mega Manectric. Additionally, its Magic Guard ability helps it check offensive teams and defensive teams alike. It renders Reuniclus immune to Stealth Rock as well as Toxic and Leech Seed, which are commonly used as defensive teams' answers to setup sweepers. Reuniclus takes advantage of many defensive Pokemon in OU, such as defensive Mega Altaria, Mega Venusaur, Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Hippowdon, and thus helps out stall teams tremendously when playing against other stall teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Reuniclus could use a Life Orb, as with Magic Guard Reuniclus is immune to its recoil damage. This would boost the power of its moves substantially, but it typically isn't worth giving up the recovery it gains from Leftovers. Colbur Berry counteracts Reuniclus's proneness to Dark-types such as Tyranitar, Weavile, and Bisharp. An offensive Trick Room set could be used with Life Orb and three attacks, as Reuniclus is extremely powerful and fares well against offensive teams. However, offense has multiple means of stalling Trick Room turns and checking Reuniclus, and this set is practically useless against any team that is not offensive, so it is generally an inferior option. Heal Block prevents opposing Pokemon from healing. In particular, it prevents Slowbro from using Slack Off. Grass Knot is another option Reuniclus can utilise as it deals heavy damage to bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, while being a strong option against Mega Sableye because of its high base power. On top of this, it allows Reuniclus to break Quagsire, which walls it easily because of Unaware.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Strong Dark-types such as Bisharp, Tyranitar and Weavile all pressure Reuniclus heavily due to their strong Dark-type STAB moves. They can find switchin opportunities easily, especially if Reuniclus is in a situation where it needs to use Recover. Tyranitar and Weavile both often run Pursuit, which makes it difficult to preserve Reuniclus.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Bug-types such as Mega Scizor, Mega Heracross, and Mega Pinsir are capable of breaking through Reuniclus easily. Bulky Mega Scizor in particular can set up on Reuniclus freely as it takes little damage from Focus Blast and can pick off Reuniclus easily. Mega Heracross struggles to switch in, but it can OHKO Reuniclus with Pin Missile, while Mega Pinsir can net an opportunity to set up with Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Pokemon: Reuniclus is reliant on Calm Mind to do impressive damage. Unaware Pokemon, namely Quagsire and Clefable, ignore Calm Mind boosts and thus make great switch-ins to Reuniclus. However, neither can 2HKO Reuniclus without a boosting move of its own, so the battle tends to turn into a PP war.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Although Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn can't take on Reuniclus well, the aforementioned Mega Scizor and Jirachi can take it on very well, with Mega Scizor being able to set up on Reuniclus very easily, while Jirachi can paralyze Reuniclus with Body Slam and paraflinch it. Skarmory isn't a solid stop, especially if it comes down to a 1v1 situation, but it can phaze Reuniclus to prevent it from setting up early on in the game. Mega Metagross isn't the most reliable option but it can deal heavy damage to Reuniclus and force it to switch out to preserve Recover PP.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind allows Reuniclus to boost its Special Attack so that it can start doing insane damage and Special Defense so that it becomes impenetrable specially. Psyshock is a fairly powerful Psychic-type STAB move that lets Reuniclus counter Poison-types, such as Mega Venusaur. Psyshock also lets Reuniclus win Calm Mind wars and hit Chansey hard at +6, unlike Psychic. Focus Blast covers the Steel-types, such as Ferrothorn and Heatran, that Reuniclus easily sets up on. It also lets Reuniclus OHKO Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Weavile, while dealing heavy damage to Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Recover is necessary for continually recovering Reuniclus's HP while it is setting up and after it switches in on Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny. Signal Beam is another option over Focus Blast but lacks the power to OHKO the aforementioned Dark-types, but gives Reuniclus an option against opposing Psychic-types.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP EVs and 56 Special Defense EVs let Reuniclus almost always be able to switch into Naive Mega Diancie's Moonblast, take the next one, and then beat it. 68 Special Defense EVs could be used instead to guarantee avoiding the 2HKO, but Reuniclus would lose out on the ability to counter some physical threats, such as Life Orb Terrakion. The remaining EVs are put in Defense, and a Bold nature is used so that Reuniclus is as physically bulky as possible with the Special Defense investment. Leftovers is used for passive recovery, and Magic Guard is the ability of choice, as it makes Reuniclus immune to status damage and entry hazard damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Do not try to sweep with Reuniclus unless all of its checks and counters have been removed or you have a plan for luring them in and defeating them, such as using Focus Blast instead of Calm Mind or Psyshock to hit Bisharp on the switch. Once all of Reuniclus's checks and counters are gone, switch Reuniclus in, and alternate between Calm Mind and Recover until Reuniclus is powerful enough to win in the least amount of turns. Try to make sure you don't have to rely on Focus Blast to 2HKO a lot of Pokemon, as it misses frequently and has low PP. Reuniclus takes zero damage from Toxic, Stealth Rock, and Spikes, so don't be afraid to constantly switch it in and out. It laughs at many common defensive Pokemon, such as Ferrothorn and Heatran; Reuniclus should switch into them and start using Calm Mind. Reuniclus, thanks to its good bulk and fair typing, can also switch into common offensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Mega Manectric, Mega Diancie, and Mega Lopunny and proceed to use Calm Mind.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Reuniclus, despite having access to Focus Blast, can find itself being pressured very easily by Dark-types such as Bisharp, Weavile, and Tyranitar, so Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion make for good options as they can check the aforementioned Dark-types effectively. Keldeo in particular is a good teammate as it can switch into Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Jirachi that annoy Reuniclus. Magnezone is another good teammate for Reuniclus as it can trap Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Jirachi, making it easier for Reuniclus to find setup opportunities. Fire-types such as Heatran and Talonflame can also take on Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Jirachi while Reuniclus can set up on bulky Water- and Ground-types such as utility Starmie, Rotom-W, Hippowdon, and Landorus-T lacking Swords Dance.</p> "

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<p>Amoonguss is a solid pivot in the OU metagame with a defensive typing that allows it to check threats such as Keldeo, Azumarill, Mega Diancie, and Breloom. It possesses an excellent ability in Regenerator, which allows it to heal by switching out rather than using a turn for Synthesis. One of Amoonguss's best traits is that it learns Spore, which is an excellent move to cripple a member of the opposing team with. While Amoonguss is very solid, it has competition as a bulky Grass-type from Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth, which all have more offensive presence. Amoonguss is also extremely slow, and after Spore has been used it can be rather passive and easy to switch into.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Synthesis is an option for recovery, but generally Regenerator is the only healing necessary and Synthesis makes Amoonguss more passive. Toxic can be used to better wear down some switch-ins, but many of them are better targeted by other moves than Toxic. Hidden Power Ice can be used to better wear down some Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Latios, Mega Alakazam, Mega Metagross, and Mega Medicham are all capable of OHKOing Amoonguss after Stealth Rock damage and don't particularly mind anything in return except Spore. Mega Gardevoir can tank a Sludge Bomb and 2HKO Amoonguss with Psyshock. Reuniclus can lose its boosts to Clear Smog but still threatens Amoonguss with its super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Tornadus-T, Talonflame, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Pinsir are all very threatening to Amoonguss. Togekiss can also threaten Amoonguss but has to rely on making it flinch. Most of these Pokemon are vulnerable to switching into Stun Spore bar Togekiss, and poison from Sludge Bomb can limit their effectiveness as well, so they should be switched in with caution.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Heatran can't really be touched by Amoonguss outside of status moves. Both Mega Charizard formes, Volcarona, and Victini are also capable of OHKOing Amoonguss pretty easily and can take its attacking moves comfortably.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur: Mega Venusaur is bulkier and stronger than Amoonguss, while also being immune to Spore. It can spam Hidden Power Fire or Sludge Bomb to force Amoonguss out.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Gliscor isn't susceptible to status moves and takes very little damage from Amoonguss's attacks, while Mew can simply use Taunt to annoy Amoonguss to no end.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types: Kyurem-B cleanly OHKOes Amoonguss with Ice Beam and cares very little about its attacking moves. Weavile and Mamoswine can also do a ton of damage but are frailer and can't always take out Amoonguss in one hit.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Spore is a must-have on Amoonguss to cripple one Pokemon on the opposing team, and Giga Drain allows Amoonguss to stay somewhat healthy, while threatening Water-types it naturally checks. Clear Smog removes stat boosts from Pokemon such as Clefable and Serperior, while Stun Spore can be used as a secondary status moves to catch opponents off guard when they think they're safe after Spore has been used. Hidden Power Fire is an option to hit Ferrothorn and Scizor, both of which can otherwise wall Amoonguss. Sludge Bomb can be used for a stronger STAB move than Clear Smog with a 30% chance to poison the foe. Foul Play can also be used to punish setup sweepers such as Landorus-T and Mega Scizor if something on the opposing team is already sleeping while also being able to deal heavy damage to the likes of Mega Metagross.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP EVs reduce damage from entry hazards and maximize Amoonguss's overall bulk. 92 Special Defense EVs allow Amoonguss to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Keldeo's Icy Wind, while the other EVs are poured into Defense with a Bold nature to better take on Pokemon such as Azumarill, Breloom, and Mega Lopunny. Regenerator allows Amoonguss to heal up upon switching out. Black Sludge is chosen to restore HP and is superior to Leftovers to punish Pokemon that wish to switch items with Trick. An alternate spread of 248 HP / 200 Def / 60 SpD with a Calm Nature can be used to avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Thundurus's Hidden Power Ice with Stealth Rock up.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switch Amoonguss in on Pokemon such as Keldeo, Serperior, Breloom, and Azumarill early game to force them out. It can also switch into Rotom-W, but Rotom-W can easily bail out with Volt Switch. If Amoonguss switches in on a Volt Switch from Rotom-W, a counter to Amoonguss is likely going to come out, so be careful of this. Utilize Amoonguss as a pivot, double switching out of the things it checks to keep up momentum. Analyze what Pokemon your opponent is most likely to let Amoonguss cripple with Spore, and try to use Spore on something else if possible. Stun Spore should be used as a follow-up after something has been put to sleep with Spore. Double switching with Amoonguss can be important because it can allow certain Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur to come in without any repercussion. Amoonguss can also be used as an answer to certain setup sweepers such as Clefable and Mega Altaria thanks to Clear Smog, so be sure to keep it healthy to prevent these Pokemon from sweeping.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Amoonguss works well on teams with Tyranitar, which resists Psychic-, Flying-, and Fire-type attacks, while Amoonguss can take on Water-, Fairy-, and Fighting-type attacks in return. Amoonguss also checks key threats to sand teams such as Azumarill, Breloom, Celebi, and Keldeo, and Regenerator healing synergizes with this playstyle better than Mega Venusaur's Synthesis does. Water-types such as Slowbro and Rotom-W can check Fire-types such as Talonflame and Heatran, while Slowbro checks Mega Charizard X and Rotom-W checks Tornadus-T. Specially defensive Gastrodon is also a strong check to Fire-types and Tornadus-T, and it checks Mega Alakazam as well. Other Regenerator pivots such as Tornadus-T function well with Amoonguss for momentum purposes. Clefable can take on Latios, many variants of Tornadus-T, and Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Weavile. Mega Scizor checks Psychic- and Ice-types and can pick off fast threats with its priority Bullet Punch. Heatran can check Psychic- and Flying-types while setting up Stealth Rock and pressuring opposing Grass- and Steel-types. Skarmory can take on powerful Ground-types and many Psychic-types for Amoonguss while being able to remove hazards or set them up. Hippowdon sets up Stealth Rock and checks many Fire-types for Amoonguss such as Talonflame and Mega Charizard X.</p> "

  "Jellicent": {
    "overview": "<p>Jellicent has an excellent Ghost / Water defensive typing alongside a fantastic Special Defense stat, allowing it to act as a solid wall and the best spinblocker in the tier. It also has access to good utility moves such as Recover to keep itself healthy, Will-O-Wisp to cripple foes, and Taunt to prevent foes from healing, setting entry hazards, or throwing out a status move. Its ability Water Absorb also allows it to take Water-type attacks from the likes of Slowbro, Keldeo, and Starmie. Jellicent's Ghost typing makes it an excellent choice to have on hazard stacking teams, as it can block Rapid Spin from the likes of Excadrill and Starmie. Jellicent does, however, have very poor Speed, making it difficult to utilize Taunt against many fast Pokemon effectively. Jellicent's low Defense also holds it back, as it struggles to reliably check physical attackers suck as Excadrill, Mega Metagross, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Medicham. Jellicent's typing also leaves it weak to common types like Dark and Electric.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Protect is a viable option to scout out moves, which is especially useful against Choice-locked Pokemon like Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Magnezone as well as Choice Band Weavile. An example of this is scouting whether Choice Scarf Tyranitar will use Pursuit or Crunch so you know whether or not you should switch out. Hex is also a viable option, as it can do a lot of damage in combination with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Status Absorbers: Clefable does not mind being burnt by Scald or Will-O-Wisp from Jellicent and can recover off any damage thanks to Leftovers and Soft-Boiled. Gliscor can avoid being burnt thanks to its Toxic Orb and Poison Heal; it takes very little damage from Scald and can set up on Jellicent with Swords Dance. Mega Altaria does not mind being burnt, as it has access to Heal Bell, can set up on Jellicent with Dragon Dance, and can recover off any damage thanks to Roost.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Thundurus is able to soak up any hit from Jellicent and threaten it back with Thunderbolt. Magnezone can also take any hit from Jellicent and retaliate with Thunderbolt or Volt Switch to gain momentum. Rotom-W can cripple Jellicent with Will-O-Wisp and threaten it with a Volt Switch. Zapdos can threaten Jellicent with a STAB Electric-type move and recover off any damage Jellicent dishes out with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Serperior can threaten Jellicent with Leaf Storm or set up Substitute safely on it. Amoonguss can soak up anything Jellicent throws out and threaten it back with Spore or Giga Drain while being able to recover off any damage with Regenerator. Tangrowth shares a similar role, as it also has Regenerator and can threaten Jellicent with Giga Drain or Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Strong Dark-types like Tyranitar, Weavile, Crawdaunt, Bisharp, and Hydreigon can threaten Jellicent with a Dark-type move like Knock Off, Pursuit, Crunch, or Dark Pulse. However, a majority of them are physical attackers that do not appreciate taking Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Status: Status moves like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp chip down Jellicent, forcing it to use Recover or switch out. Jellicent also does not appreciate Thunder Wave, as it becomes slower than defensive Pokemon, allowing them to use a move before it can use Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Attacks that can do a lot of damage and force Jellicent to use Recover are threatening towards it. These attacks include Thunder Punch from Mega Metagross and Mega Medicham, Hidden Power Grass from Keldeo, Tail Glow-boosted attacks from Manaphy, Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor from Latios, Moonblast from Mega Diancie, Return from Mega Lopunny, and Thunderbolt from Mega Latias.</p> ",

Recover is used to help Jellicent stay healthy throughout the game. Taunt can be used to stop foes from recovering, using status moves, setting up, or setting entry hazards. Scald is Jellicent's main STAB move and has a useful chance to burn foes. Night Shade offers consistent damage and enables Jellicent to chip down foes regardless of its lack of offensive EVs.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>44 Speed EVs allow Jellicent to outspeed Clefable so it can get off Taunt before Clefable can use Thunder Wave, Calm Mind, or Soft-Boiled. 44 Speed EVs also allow Jellicent to outspeed Pokemon with base 65 Speed, which includes Alomomola and Scizor before it Mega Evolves. 248 HP EVs allow Jellicent to take less damage from Spikes. 216 Defense EVs slightly optimize Jellicent's physical bulk, given its Bold nature. Leftovers provides Jellicent with passive recovery, though Colbur Berry can be used instead to help it absorb Dark-type moves like Knock Off, Crunch, and Pursuit.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Jellicent should be used as a defensive pivot, so utilize Water Absorb to take Water-type attacks like Hydro Pump from Keldeo, Surf from Choice Specs Latios, and Scald from Starmie and Slowbro. Take advantage of Jellicent's Ghost typing to stop Rapid Spin from Excadrill and Starmie as well as Fighting-type moves like High Jump Kick from Mega Medicham and Hammer Arm from Mega Metagross. Use Will-O-Wisp to cripple threats like Ferrothorn, Excadrill Mega Scizor, and other physical attackers, and Taunt to stop setup and shut down slower defensive Pokemon like Chansey and Clefable. Recover should be used to keep Jellicent healthy and out of range of foe attacks. If running Colbur Berry, use it to absorb a Dark-type move like Crunch or Knock Off from a physical attacker like Bisharp, Weavile, or Tyranitar and retaliate with Will-O-Wisp, making it easier for Jellicent to handle them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Jellicent is the best spinblocker in the tier, making Spikes setters like Ferrothorn and Skarmory good partners. Ferrothorn is especially good, as it can also provide support through Thunder Wave and Knock Off.

Jellicent does not appreciate taking status moves like Toxic, making status absorbers like Magic Guard Clefable and Gliscor great partners. Clefable and Gliscor also appreciate Jellicent's ability to bait Choice Band and Choice Scarf users like Tyranitar and Weavile to lock themselves into Pursuit so they can set up. The same applies to other setup Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Bisharp. Speaking of Pursuit, Pokemon like Weavile and Tyranitar can help Jellicent remove threats like Latios and Latias that resist Jellicent's Scald. Mega Metagross can also provide Pursuit support and checks the status absorbers that like switching into Jellicent's Will-O-Wisp, like Clefable and Gliscor, with Meteor Mash and Ice Punch, respectively. Assault Vest Tornadus-T can help deal with Grass-types like Serperior, switch into Dragon-types that resist Water like Latios, and provide Knock Off support. Mega Latias appreciates Jellicent's ability to burn Dark-types and can act as a wincon thanks to this. Heatran forms a nice defensive core with Jellicent, as it can take on Grass-types like Serperior as well as other threats like Choice Specs Latios and Volcarona.

  "Alomomola": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting a massive HP stat, Alomomola perfectly epitomizes the concept of a bulky Water-type. With its good Defense stat to complement its HP, Alomomola is a great wall to many common OU Pokemon, including Talonflame, Garchomp, and Azumarill. It can heal itself and its teammates with gigantic Wishes, and it is the only usable Pokemon in OU with the combination of Wish and Regenerator, allowing it to heal itself as it passes Wishes to other Pokemon. Regenerator makes Alomomola difficult to wear down and mitigates potential entry hazard damage. As a defensive Pokemon, it has a good Water typing, as well as access to Scald to burn physical attackers that could try to set up on it. Scald also allows Alomomola to cripple defensive threats such as Ferrothorn and Mega Sableye. Unfortunately, Alomomola's Scald is very weak, often not even doing much to Pokemon it is super effective against, which means that Alomomola is vulnerable to setup sweepers with Substitute or those that aren't affected by burns such as Gyarados and Poison Heal Gliscor, respectively. However, Alomomola can still wall a huge amount of dangerous threats and is a fine choice on balanced and stall teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Some of Alomomola's other options include Refresh to alleviate Toxic poison, Healing Wish to restore a teammate back to full health, Light Screen to reduce the damage of special attacks, and possibly Soak in order to use Toxic on Pokemon immune to it, such as Mega Scizor and Amoonguss.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Strong Electric-types such as Thundurus, Mega Manectric, and Raikou can easily KO Alomomola on its weaker Special Defense stat with powerful, super effective STAB moves, and they can also threaten to set up as it switches out. Magnezone is also notable, as it is immune to Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Defensive Grass-types such as Venusaur, Celebi, and Amoonguss take almost no damage from Scald, are immune to Toxic (Natural Cure aids in Celebi's case), threaten Alomomola with Giga Drain and sleep-inducing moves, and are able to completely stall it out. Mega Venusaur is definitely better than the others, as it uses Synthesis more often, has a stronger Giga Drain, and can freely switch into Knock Off. It does lack Black Sludge or Leftovers recovery, though. Serperior can switch in and force Alomomola out with Leaf Storm as well.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Strong special attackers with the appropriate coverage moves, such as Mega Charizard Y and Hidden Power Electric Keldeo, can muscle through Alomomola lacking Mirror Coat.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Gliscor: Gliscor takes little damage from Scald, can't get burned, and can cripple Alomomola with Toxic while recovering with Poison Heal, Protect, and possibly Roost. It can even set up Swords Dance multiple times. Other Pokemon with Toxic such as Chansey and Mega Sableye can also be bothersome, as the move limits Alomomola's opportunities to switch in, especially with entry hazards up.</p> <p><strong>Substitute: Alomomola's only attacking move is a weak Scald used for its burn chance, so Substitute sweepers are a real pain for it. Substitute + Dragon Dance Gyarados resists Scald, so it can set up Dragon Dance on Alomomola, potentially troubling the rest of the team too. Substitute Kyurem-B and Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo also pose rather large problems to Alomomola.</p> ",

        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This set walls a lot of common and powerful Pokemon and passes very large Wishes to Alomomola's teammates. Protect prevents Alomomola from taking damage as it receives its own Wish while also aiding it in Toxic stalling and occasionally scouting moves such as Hidden Power Electric on Keldeo. Toxic cripples the offensive Pokemon Alomomola walls by putting them on a timer and gives it a means of damaging defensive Pokemon with reliable recovery, but if you feel that Scald is enough for this, Knock Off can be used instead to hinder switch-ins such as Chansey and Keldeo. Scald is used against physical attackers that can potentially set up and muscle their way through Alomomola, and it is also necessary for Steel-types such as Mega Scizor. Mirror Coat is quite niche, but it is useful for surprising special attackers such as Latios. However, the teams Alomomola is on should have the necessary means for dealing with stronger special attackers. It is, however, very useful against RestTalk Suicune.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers provides Alomomola with passive recovery, but Rocky Helmet is viable too, as Alomomola already has two means of recovery, one of which happens without the use of a move. Because of Alomomola's incredible HP stat, it is more beneficial to invest heavily in Defense and Special Defense. 36 HP EVs are enough to reach a Leftovers number. Special Defense is maximized because Alomomola needs investment there to perform as a mixed wall, and the rest of the EVs are put into Defense. Fully invested Special Defense with 36 HP EVs is much better than 252 HP / 252 Def because the overall physical bulk is around the same but Alomomola's special bulk gets much better. If you choose not to use Scald, a Careful nature should be used over a Calm nature.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Alomomola should switch into many attackers, such as Talonflame, Mega Metagross, Mega Charizard X, Keldeo, Garchomp, Mamoswine, Mega Diancie, Mega Lopunny, Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Terrakion, and from there it almost always should use Wish, as the opponent will often switch out to a Pokemon that can beat Alomomola. Alomomola can use this opportunity to heal a teammate or itself. Protect can also be used to scout for Choice-locked moves, but it can get predictable very easily, especially when using it with Wish.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alomomola fits the best on balanced and stall teams. It works very well with potent defensive Pokemon that lack reliable recovery, such as Ferrothorn and Heatran. Amoonguss has great defensive synergy with Alomomola; it can take on Mega Manectric, Celebi, and Serperior, for example, and Alomomola can take on some Pokemon that trouble Amoonguss, such as Talonflame. Amoonguss is also capable of absorbing Toxic Spikes which can wear down Alomomola very quickly. They also both have Regenerator, making them almost impossible to wear down, with few Pokemon able to deal with both outside of Nasty Plot Hidden Power Flying or Psychic Thundurus. Specially defensive Hippowdon completes a brilliant core here, taking on this Thundurus variant, Raikou, and Mega Manectric. Clefable also makes for a great teammate, as it can absorb status. Mega Charizard X and Ferrothorn also create an excellent balanced core with Alomomola, as they all cover each other's weaknesses.</p> "

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn has a lot to love as a defensive Pokemon. First and foremost, it has a great Grass / Steel typing and solid mixed bulk. Together, its unique set of resistances and bulk allow Ferrothorn to check a plethora of threats. In addition to this, Ferrothorn has access to a wide array of support moves, such as Stealth Rock, Spikes, Leech Seed, and Thunder Wave. Because it has decent offensive presence, Ferrothorn can be hard to switch into for many offensively-oriented teams. However, while Ferrothorn's typing gives it a great set of resistances, it also gives it a glaring 4x weakness to Fire-type attacks, which means that Ferrothorn is easily forced out by Fire-type opponents. In addition to this, some special attackers, such as Latios, can get past Ferrothorn if they are carrying Hidden Power Fire. Ferrothorn's typing also leaves it vulnerable to being trapped by the increasingly common Magnezone. Lastly, Ferrothorn's Speed is terrible, which means it has to rely on surviving an attack before using a move itself.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Ferrothorn has access to quite a few support moves, it doesn't really have many other options than the ones mentioned in the main set. Bulldoze hits Heatran and Magnezone hard, but it will not OHKO either of them. Toxic can be used to punish bulky switch-ins, such as Zapdos, Mew, and Mandibuzz, while Curse is a decent boosting option, as Ferrothorn has high Special Defense and is immune to Toxic. Rest is an option alongside Leech Seed for semi-reliable recovery. It should be noted that Ferrothorn has to drop a utility move if running Rest, however. If Ferrothorn is run on Trick Room teams, Explosion is an option, as it does a lot of damage to most opponents and gains momentum for the team. With its decent offensive stats, it also has the option to run a Choice Band set, but such a set is gimmicky and wastes Ferrothorn's potential as a support Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Heatran resist Ferrothorn's STAB attacks and can OHKO Ferrothorn with their respective Fire-type STAB attacks. However, Mega Charizard X and Talonflame must be wary of the recoil damage from Flare Blitz and Iron Barbs. Volcanion can also threaten Ferrothorn with its high-powered Fire-type moves but can take hefty damage from Power Whip.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Mega Venusaur takes little-to-no damage from Power Whip, can tank Ferrothorn's Gyro Balls, and can do significant damage in return with Hidden Power Fire. Mega Venusaur is also immune to Leech Seed, so it only has to be wary of the uncommon Thunder Wave. Amoonguss can also switch into Ferrothorn freely and wear it down with Hidden Power Fire, while the likes of Hidden Power Fire Celebi can also do the same and not fear being crippled by Thunder Wave thanks to Natural Cure.</p> <p><strong>Magnezone: If Ferrothorn is not running Shed Shell, Magnezone can trap Ferrothorn with Magnet Pull and proceed to do a lot of damage with Hidden Power Fire. Magnezone also fears very little from Ferrothorn, as it resists its STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Mega Scizor</strong>: With the combination of Roost and Swords Dance, Mega Scizor uses Ferrothorn as setup fodder, as it fears nothing that Ferrothorn can throw at it.</p> <p><strong>Magic Guard users</strong>: With maximum investment in Defense or a Speed-reducing nature, Clefable can outstall Ferrothorn's Gyro Balls and proceed to set up with Calm Mind. It can also 2HKO Ferrothorn with unboosted Flamethrowers. Reuniclus also doesn't care about what Ferrothorn does and proceeds to set up with Calm Mind and then pick it off with Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Strong Fighting-types, such as Terrakion, Keldeo, Mega Heracross, Mega Lopunny, Mega Gallade and Mega Medicham, can do hefty amounts of damage to Ferrothorn with their STAB moves, if not OHKO it. They all have to be wary of switching into Gyro Ball or Power Whip, however. Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham both need to be wary of Protect since their main way of damaging Ferrothorn is High Jump Kick.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt users that fear little from Ferrothorn's attacks, such as Mew and Mandibuzz, completely shut it down, as Ferrothorn can't use Leech Seed when Taunted.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos resists both Ferrothorn's STAB moves and can threaten Ferrothorn out with Heat Wave or Defog its entry hazards away.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ferrothorn is a consistent setter of Spikes because of its great bulk and ability to beat common entry hazard removers, such as Latios, Latias, and Excadrill. Stealth Rock is an alternative if your team lacks a user of the move. Because of its ability to take on common hazard removers, Ferrothorn is also one of the best defensive Spikes setters. Leech Seed gives Ferrothorn a way of recovering health and is a must on every Ferrothorn set, as it lacks reliable recovery. The damage Leech Seed does is also useful for chipping away at the opponent's health. Gyro Ball is Ferrothorn's primary choice for an attacking move, as it OHKOes Mega Gardevoir, and does significant damage to many fast Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, Gengar, and Fairy-types such as Clefable and Sylveon. Power Whip is generally preferred in the last slot so that Ferrothorn can deal with Substitute Mega Gyarados and hit Azumarill, Keldeo, Excadrill, and Hippowdon hard; it can even be run over Gyro Ball if Protect or Thunder Wave is desirable. Protect in tandem with Leech Seed grants Ferrothorn even more recovery and can scout the opponent's next move. Ferrothorn appreciates all the recovery it can get as it has no form of instant, significant recovery. If the ability to cripple common switch-ins such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran is important, Thunder Wave is an option for the last moveslot. Knock Off is yet another option to annoy common switch-ins by removing their item, such as Heatran's, Zapdos's and Mew's Leftovers, and can be run in the last moveslot. Finally, Ferrothorn can opt to run both Stealth Rock and Spikes on the same set, which is effective as Ferrothorn gets opportunities to set up hazards on many common Pokemon and doesn't really need any of the moves in the last slot, though this does put a lot of pressure on Ferrothorn. It's generally only used on more offensively inclined teams that can't fit Stealth Rock elsewhere and are using Ferrothorn for its defensive and supportive traits.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread with a Relaxed nature lets Ferrothorn fare well against both physically and specially oriented opponents. 168 Special Defense EVs give Ferrothorn enough special bulk to survive two Ice Beams from +3 Manaphy. A Sassy nature with the given EV spread allows Ferrothorn to survive the combination of Hyper Voice + Focus Blast from Modest Mega Gardevoir most of the time, while still avoiding the 2HKO from +1 Mega Gyarados's Earthquake most of the time; the downside is that this leaves Ferrothorn much more susceptible to Crunch from Mega Gyarados and physical attackers in general, so it isn't typically recommended. If there's a lot of stress on Ferrothorn to handle physical attackers such as Azumarill, Life Orb Excadrill, Mega Gyarados, and Diggersby, more Defense investment can be run to tank hit from these Pokemon more easily. An example of a more physically defensive spread is 252 HP / 168 Def / 88 SpD avoids the 2HKO from Adamant Life Orb Excadrill after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Leftovers is the preferred item, as Ferrothorn heavily appreciates the added recovery. Chople Berry is another useful item that allows Ferrothorn to take less damage from Fighting-types or the likes of Mega Gardevoir and Mega Alakazam and proceed to cripple them with Thunder Wave or OHKO the latter two with Gyro Ball. However, Shed Shell is a decent alternative over Leftovers if the ability to escape from Magnezone is more valuable to your team than the extra recovery Leftovers provides. Rocky Helmet is an alternate option over Leftovers or Shed Shell in order to weaken physical attackers that try to hit Ferrothorn with weaker attacks, such as U-turn, Knock Off, and not very effective moves that make contact.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It's advised to send in Ferrothorn on a Pokemon that does not really threaten it, such as Azumarill, Chansey, opposing Ferrothorn, Slowbro, or Suicune, and proceed to set up Stealth Rock or Spikes. Leech Seed is the most spammable move in the moveset, and if the opposing team lacks a Pokemon that is immune to it, it's more than likely favorable to use it. Playing carefully with Protect is advised, as it can be easy to take advantage of. Its main uses are letting Ferrothorn gain extra recovery in a pinch and scouting for lures such as Hidden Power Fire Latios. You should always scout for this type of moves by using Protect or switching out, especially if Ferrothorn is important to beat the opposing team. If the opposing team has a Defogger capable of switching safely into Ferrothorn, such as Skarmory or Zapdos, pulling double switches to stop them from Defogging is smart. Lastly, if not running Shed Shell, it's advised to play carefully around Magnezone, especially if Ferrothorn is important to take on a member of the opposing team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that are capable of dealing with Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Heatran make good teammates. Heatran excels at this role, especially if holding an Air Balloon. It can also set Stealth Rock, which allows Ferrothorn to run Spikes. Defiant users that can take advantage of the opponent trying to remove Ferrothorn's entry hazards with Defog, such as Bisharp and Thundurus, also make good teammates. If running a Sassy nature, Ferrothorn's physical walling capabilities are reduced, so Pokemon that can deal with strong physical attackers such as Life Orb Excadrill and Diggersby make great teammates. Defensive Landorus-T is one of the best options, as it is also capable of running Stealth Rock. Fairy-types such as Clefable and Azumarill also make good partners because they can take on Fighting-types. Lastly, Keldeo and Infernape make good teammates, as they are capable of beating Mega Scizor and Bisharp, both of which can use Ferrothorn as setup fodder.</p> "

  "Haxorus": {
    "overview": "<p>In a tier rife with Dragons of all shapes and sizes, Haxorus maintains several noteworthy traits over its dragon brethren. It retains the highest Attack stat of all non-legendary Dragon-types, surpassed only by Kyurem-B and Mega Garchomp, neither of which have access to Dragon Dance. Haxorus's pure Dragon typing, being oddly uncommon, makes it far less susceptible to non-STAB Ice attacks that are often carried for the likes of Dragonite and Garchomp. Furthermore, Haxorus's relatively rare ability, Mold Breaker, allows it to disregard Pokemon with otherwise problematic abilities like Levitate Rotom-W, Filter Mega Aggron, Unaware Clefable, numerous Sturdy users, and Multiscale Dragonite. However, Haxorus is not without its faults. Haxorus's overall lack of bulk means that it is easily 2HKOed by strong neutral hits and is potentially vulnerable while setting up. Fairy-types will also make you hesitate to use Outrage, meaning that it isn't just the ubiquitous Steel-types it needs to worry about anymore. While Haxorus has enough coverage options to handle most Steel- and Fairy-types, it can't cover everything and can find itself hard-walled without the right team support. Base 97 Speed is acceptable for wallbreaking and sufficient with enough boosts to clean up late-game with an unresisted Outrage. Haxorus has the right stats, ability, moves, and typing to perform its role very well.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Low Kick is Haxorus's best attack against Ferrothorn and can OHKO Mamoswine and Mega Gyarados at +1, as well as hitting Heatran that carry Air Balloon. Rock Slide is a fair choice on Choice Scarf sets, being able to hit many of the faster 4x weak Pokemon like Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Volcarona with the potential to flinch. Superpower with Swords Dance is the most efficient way to consistently deal with Skarmory, but offers little else. Dragon Claw is Haxorus's most conservative and reliable STAB move if you hate Outrage's lock-in and Dual Chop's accuracy, but it comes with a severe reduction in power. Aqua Tail provides good neutral coverage with Dragon-type attacks and can be particularly useful against Air Balloon Heatran and Excadrill, but leaves Haxorus walled by Azumarill and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Airborne Steel-types: Haxorus's most common sets are not tailored to handling airborne Steel-types. Without Taunt for Skarmory or Aqua Tail for Air Balloon Heatran and Excadrill, Haxorus will be hard-pressed to come out on top.</p> <p><strong>Speedy Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon with immediate access to Speed and power like Keldeo demolish stallbreaker sets, and even then certain Choice Scarf users like Garchomp and priority users can take advantage of Dragon Dance Haxorus, even after a boost. Requiring setup time to be effective puts Haxorus at an immediate disadvantage against most Pokemon that outspeed it.</p> ",

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance is Haxorus's boosting move of choice, giving it the power and Speed he needs to rip through weakened walls and slower sweepers. Earthquake is great for handling Steel-types like Heatran and Klefki, and is also great for hitting Rotom-W. Taunt completely shuts down would-be walls like Skarmory that don't carry Brave Bird, helping Haxorus nab additional boosts. For wallbreaking or sweeping, Outrage will benefit Haxorus the most with its insane power, as Dragon Claw and Dual Chop severely lack power in general and prevent Haxorus from fulfilling its role.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Dragon Dance is the better boosting move to let Haxorus compete with hyper-offensive teams, as the Speed boosts are crucial. Once Haxorus ideally gets to +2, simply use Outrage, assuming no Fairy-types remain, and never look back. 240 Speed EVs maintains an advantage over Jolly Dragonite and other max Speed base 80s as well as Jolly Gyarados, and max Speed Kyurem-B if you choose a Jolly nature. Life Orb gives Haxorus some extra oomph and compensates in situations where it can't get as many desired Dragon Dances in, helping it continue its rampage. Haxorus is still threatening without boosts against slow or weakened Pokemon like Heatran and Tyranitar with Earthquake, or Breloom with Poison Jab. Taunt often makes slow walls like Chansey and Skarmory switch out, giving Haxorus breathing room to boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Haxorus requires safe opportunities to boost to overpower sturdy walls and bypass faster and frailer threats. Getting two Dragon Dances is your goal and is often enough to shift the odds in your favor against many would-be checks and counters. A weakened team with Steel- and Fairy-types eradicated simply cannot stand up to its mighty Outrage. Don't try to switch Haxorus into anything, and ideally remove priority users beforehand. A slow Volt Switch or U-turn is a reliable method of getting Haxorus in unscathed against favorable matchups. Rotom-W can be Taunted and often has to Volt Switch out as a result, which Haxorus fortunately resists. Heatran fears Earthquake, and Air Balloon versions can safely be Taunted and thus are unable to use Substitute, Will-O-Wisp, or Roar. Having Stealth Rock is generally helpful against priority users such as Talonflame and Dragonite. Zapdos carries no threatening moves and is easy to set up against, with Taunt as insurance. Ferrothorn that lack Gyro Ball are also pure setup and Taunt bait, and Earthquake doesn't activate Iron Barbs or incur Rocky Helmet damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Most Steel-types protect Haxorus from all three of its weaknesses. Heatran's plethora of resistances and great bulk make it a reliable team player with Fire STAB for other Steel-types and the ability to lay Stealth Rock. Any U-turn or Volt Switch user can help get Haxorus in for free against an unwilling opponent, allowing for more boosting opportunities. Rotom-W is a popular choice that is easy to fit onto most teams and is a good answer for Talonflame, Scizor, Air Balloon Heatran, and Landorus-T, slows down faster enemies with Thunder Wave, and can scout with Volt Switch. Rotom-H similarly handles Talonflame but is also great against many Steel-types such as Scizor, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn, handily resisting their common moves and threatening to OHKO with Overheat. Being immune to burn as well as paralysis like Rotom-W is also beneficial. Landorus-T can prompt switches with Intimidate and can U-turn Haxorus in safely on top of setting up Stealth Rock. Klefki protects you from opposing Dragon-, Fairy-, and Ice-type attacks, has access to Prankster Thunder Wave, can set up dual screens for Haxorus to boost behind more safely.</p> "

        "name": "Stallbreaker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance with Mold Breaker makes Haxorus an insane wallbreaker and the most potent Dragon-type capable of defeating Fairy-types. Outrage is for maddening power, but Dual Chop is better for handling Substitute and Focus Sash users, especially Substitute Kyurem-B. Earthquake hits the majority of Steel-types and +2 Poison Jab makes short work of even Unaware Clefable, Azumarill, Togekiss, and Sylveon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>For pure wallbreaking purposes, Swords Dance gives Haxorus the power it needs to be one hell of an anti-stall Pokemon. Lum Berry is a great item to let Haxorus boost in the face of slower walls that would depend on a burn or Toxic to cripple it, and is recommended if Haxorus forgoes Taunt. Otherwise, use Life Orb to wallbreak better. However, Lum Berry does cure confusion caused by Outrage, so keep that in mind. 240 Speed EVs keeps Haxorus faster than max Speed neutral-natured Kyurem-B, which can be crucial without Dragon Dance to boost its Speed, and a Jolly nature guarantees it. Mold Breaker is by far Haxorus's best and most consistent ability, ignoring Sturdy, Multiscale, Magic Bounce, Unaware, and Levitate.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As a pure stallbreaker set, Haxorus is forgoing Speed for power. Use a Lum Berry to setup in the face of would-be threats, and after it has taken out Steel- and Fairy-types with Earthquake and Poison Jab you are free to demolish with Outrage. Chansey can waste a turn trying to use Toxic if Haxorus has a Lum Berry, and a +2 Outrage is a guaranteed OHKO after Stealth Rock or with Life Orb and no Stealth Rock. Thundurus is OHKOed by Outrage no matter what, so don't attempt to use Swords Dance when it has priority Taunt and instead hope it wastes a turn using Thunder Wave or Nasty Plot.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Stallbreaker Haxorus struggles against hyper-offensive teams, and as such wants naturally fast partners and priority users. Assault Vest Conkeldurr is great for sponging some special hits as well as status effects and has Mach Punch. Mega Aggron is also very bulky and has Thunder Wave and Dragon Tail to slow down or phaze the opponent. Bisharp threatens Fairy-types and Defog users with Defiant and has Sucker Punch. Azelf is a great dual screens user and can lay some entry hazards for easier KOes, as well as threaten fast and frail threats like Keldeo, Thundurus, and Terrakion. Talonflame is one of the best priority users around, and Tailwind makes Haxorus immediately more threatening and better suited for fighting balance and heavy offense. Klefki has access to priority Thunder Wave and dual screens while resisting all of Haxorus's weaknesses. If you opt to have a Chansey for Wish, Aromatherapy, and Natural Cure support, you can rationalize forgoing Lum Berry for Life Orb. Choice Scarf Excadrill is a natural at handling fast threats and can spin the opponent's entry hazards away while preserving your own. Focus Sash Alakazam is also insanely fast and is able to revenge kill or eliminate fast sweepers with strong special attacks. Terrakion is also a fast teammate that doesn't particularly mind Talonflame's priority and even benefits from Sucker Punch, courtesy of Justified.</p> "

  "Bisharp": {
    "overview": "<p>Bisharp is a top-tier threat in ORAS OU, as it sports numerous positive traits that allow it to take on many different team archetypes. Defiant, STAB Knock Off and Sucker Punch, and the ability to check many top-tier threats, such as Latios, Latias, and Clefable, make Bisharp a good choice for many offensive teams. Additionally, it can act as a great setup sweeper with Swords Dance or support the team by using Pursuit to trap Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Latios and Gengar. However, it still has a few drawbacks, such as a nasty 4x weakness to Fighting-type attacks, average-at best-Speed, and the tendency to be setup bait for many Mega Evolutions. Additionally, Bisharp is often reliant on Sucker Punch to deal with faster Pokemon, which leads to mind games that can sway the game in either side's favor depending on the outcome.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Taunt can be used to punish defensive Pokemon like Skarmory and Quagsire that want to heal up against Bisharp or, in the case of Skarmory, go for a Defog or layer of Spikes. This makes Bisharp a more effective stallbreaker, but Swords Dance and Pursuit are typically superior options because they are better in matchups outside of stall. A Stealth Rock set with a Focus Sash can be used as a good hazard setter that beats most Defoggers and Rapid Spinners one-on-one, although there are usually better options out there for laying down entry hazards. Finally, Low Kick allows Bisharp to take on opposing Ferrothorn and opposing Bisharp more reliably, while also 2HKOing Heatran. Bisharp can run Pursuit in order to trap threats such as Latios and Latias, but other Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Weavile usually pull it off better.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Many Fighting-types, such as Mega Lopunny, Terrakion, Breloom, and Conkeldurr, are able to check Bisharp, as they resist Knock Off and can score an easy OHKO with one of their STAB moves. Keldeo, Cobalion, Lucario, and Infernape also resist Iron Head, which makes them reliable checks that are able to switch into Bisharp repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Dark-types: Many opposing Dark-types take little damage from Iron Head and resist Knock Off, which allows them to switch into Bisharp quite reliably. Mandibuzz and Mega Gyarados can switch into Bisharp without fearing any of its attacks. Mandibuzz can Roost stall and wear Bisharp down with Foul Play and Mega Gyarados can set up a Dragon Dance on it. Additionally, opposing Bisharp carrying Low Kick can check Bisharp well. Choice Scarf Tyranitar also deserves a mention, as it resists Sucker Punch and can OHKO Bisharp with Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp and Substitute: Rotom-W, Heatran, defensive Mega Charizard X, Bulky Talonflame, and fast variants of Mew, can all burn Bisharp with Will-O-Wisp, which effectively renders Bisharp useless if it is not carrying a Lum Berry. Additionally, Substitute blocks Sucker Punch, giving the user a free turn against Bisharp. Users of Substitute such as Gyarados, Excadrill, and Mega Gardevoir are able to defeat or cause significant damage to Bisharp with a free turn.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon: Bulky Ground-types such as Gliscor, bulky Garchomp, Quagsire, and physically defensive Hippowdon fear little from Bisharp's attacks and can KO it back with STAB Earthquakes, while the latter two also have reliable recovery. Additionally, Pokemon such as Chesnaught, Mega Slowbro, Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Counter Skarmory can defeat Bisharp if it lacks Swords Dance.</p> ",
    "sets": [

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off is Bisharp's main STAB move, as it hits incredibly hard and has utility in removing items. Swords Dance boosts Bisharp's attack to insane levels and puts immediate pressure on a lot of offensive teams. Iron Head hits Fairy-types super effectively and is Bisharp's best bet against many Mega Evolutions, such as Mega Venusaur. Sucker Punch hits faster Pokemon that Bisharp would otherwise be unable to touch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment is used to hit as hard and fast as possible. An Adamant nature bolsters Bisharp's high attack stat further, allowing it to OHKO Choice Scarf Landorus-T after Stealth Rock damage. A Jolly nature ensures Bisharp can outrun threats such as Adamant Mega Altaria and Diggersby, but Adamant variants are uncommon now. It also ensures Bisharp will Speed tie at worst against opposing Bisharp. Life Orb is the preferred item, as it boosts the power of all of Bisharp's attacks, although Black Glasses can be used if the recoil from Life Orb is unappealing, which is the case when using the aforementioned EV spread. Additionally, a Lum Berry is an option to aid in setting up on bulky Water-types, as Bisharp will no longer have to worry about random Scald burns. It also helps with Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Rotom-W, Mew, and Mega Gardevoir.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This variant of Bisharp is best used as a late-game sweeper against offensive teams, so consider saving it for after its checks and counters have been sufficiently weakened. However, Bisharp can act as a powerful wallbreaker early- or mid-game against more defensively oriented teams, so bringing it in early versus a Pokemon it can set up on, such as Stealth Rock Clefable, is advisable. Additionally, Bisharp makes for a good revenge killer thanks to its powerful Sucker Punch, which can be used to revenge kill certain sweepers such as Gengar, Mega Metagross, and Sand Rush Excadrill after prior damage. Note that Sucker Punch, as it requires the foe to use an attack in order to work, can be taken advantage of in certain situations by providing the foe with free switches or a Substitute. When using Bisharp, it is important to recognize the following situation: the foe has a non-attacking move and attempts to stall out Sucker Punches. Bisharp can stop using Sucker Punch at any point and go for an attack, which the foe can punish with well-timed attack of their own. There isn't any specific strategy related to getting out of these scenarios, so try to avoid them as much as possible.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bisharp struggles immensely with Fighting-types, so teammates that can handle Pokemon such as Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gallade are appreciated. Such Pokemon include Clefable, Celebi, and Mega Metagross. Choice Band Azumarill also makes for a good teammate, as it can take on Pokemon that are able to stomach an unboosted Sucker Punch from Bisharp, such as Garchomp and Mega Charizard X. Pokemon that can capitalize on Bisharp's ability to remove Fairy-types also synergize well with it, such as Latios, Latias, Mega Gallade, and Keldeo. Lastly, Bisharp is able to deter the removal of entry hazards via Defog thanks to Defiant, so heavy offense suicide leads such as Garchomp, Azelf, Mamoswine, and Custap Berry Skarmory pair well with Bisharp.</p> "

Assault Vest Tornadus-T can soak up hits from Hydreigon, remove its item with Knock Off, or use Hurricane and U-turn to chip away at it. Specially defensive Heatran can take hits from Hydreigon while retaliating back with Toxic but does not appreciate taking Surf or Choice Specs-boosted Dark Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Fast Offensive Foes: With Hydreigon's mediocre Speed stat, strong threats that are faster than it like Mega Lopunny, Choice Specs Latios, Mega Metagross, Keldeo, Weavile, Mega Diancie, Choice Scarf Excadrill, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar can all deal a great amount of damage to Hydreigon and revenge kill it. Most of these threats, however, do not appreciate switching into Hydreigon.</p> <p><strong>Status: If Hydreigon gets paralyzed, its Speed will become crippled, making it easier to revenge kill.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dark Pulse is Hydreigon's primary STAB move with very few drawbacks, making it a very spammable move. Draco Meteor hits harder compared to Dark Pulse but is less reliable, lowering Hydreigon's Special Attack as well as having low PP and a chance to miss. Flash Cannon acts as a coverage move to primarily hit Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Altaria, which resist both of Hydreigon's STAB moves. Fire Blast is primarily used to hit Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and bulky Excadrill. Alternatively, Surf can be used to hit Fire-types like Heatran as well as Ground-types like Gliscor for more damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature let Hydreigon outspeed neutral-natured base 100s like Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard Y, and Manaphy. A Modest nature can also be run, which makes Hydreigon more powerful and harder to switch into but leaves it more vulnerable to revenge killers, as foes like Thundurus-T, Excadrill, and Modest Manaphy can now outspeed it. Levitate gives Hydreigon a useful immunity to Spikes and Ground-type attacks. Choice Specs makes Hydreigon a stronger breaker.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hydreigon should be used early-game to pressure and weaken opposing teams with its strong attacks. Dark Pulse should be spammed, as very few Pokemon can consistently take it. Draco Meteor is Hydreigon's most powerful move and should be used to net OHKOs. Do keep in mind that being locked into Draco Meteor drops Hydreigon's Special Attack, making it very passive and easily taken advantage of the following turns. Flash Cannon should be used on Fairy-types like Mega Altaria and Clefable as they switch in, leaving them at very low health. Hydreigon should not switch into many offensive foes' attacks, so VoltTurn support is recommended to provide it with a way to switch in safely. It can come in on more passive Pokemon or those using attacks it resists, though; for example, Slowbro and Rotom-W are passive and use resisted Water-type attacks, and Weavile and Tyranitar locked into a Dark-type move do not threaten it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Metagross is a great partner, as it can deal with Fairy-types that Hydreigon struggles with and also Pursuit trap the likes of Latios, which could otherwise offensively check Hydreigon. Volt Switch and U-turn users like Rotom-W and Tornadus-T are also good partners, as they can provide Hydreigon with a way to switch in safely. Tornadus-T can also provide Knock Off support, removing items like Chansey's Eviolite and Clefable's Leftovers to make it easier for Hydreigon to wear them down. Rotom-W can provide Thunder Wave support to cripple foes like Tornadus-T and Latios, which makes Hydreigon harder to revenge kill. Excadrill help deal with Fairy-types and absorbs Thunder Wave from the likes of Clefable while also appreciating Hydreigon's ability to handle bulky Water-types like Slowbro and Rotom-W. Ferrothorn is able to switch into Fairy-type attacks and can provide entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes, which help wear down Hydreigon's switch-ins. Clefable can act as a status absorber, spread paralysis via Thunder Wave, or provide Knock Off support to remove items like Tornadus-T's Assault Vest, Heatran's and other Clefable's Leftovers, and Chansey's Eviolite, making it easier for Hydreigon to break through them.</p> "

Flamethrower is used to hit Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Excadrill, Bisharp, and Skarmory and Grass-types like Serperior, Ferrothorn, and Amoonguss for super effective damage. Surf can be used to hit Fire-types like Heatran and Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T for super effective damage as well.

Expert Belt is the chosen item to boost Hydreigon's damage output and take advantage of its large movepool. Levitate is Hydreigon's only ability, and it allows it to avoid Ground-type moves and all entry hazards besides Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hydreigon should look to come in on weak or resisted hits like Scald from Slowbro and Starmie or Hydro Pump from Rotom-W. It can also pivot into Ground-type attacks like Earthquake from Gliscor or Landorus-T thanks to Levitate or come in on double switches giving it a favorable matchup. Predictions are necessary with Hydreigon in order to 2HKO foes like Clefable on the switch with super effective damage. With a lack of recovery, status aliments like Toxic and burn cripple Hydreigon, as it is put on a timer. Avoid letting Hydreigon get paralyzed, or else it will become easier for foes to revenge kill it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran can deal with Fairy-types that annoy Hydreigon like Clefable while also providing Stealth Rock support and crippling Keldeo with Toxic. Amoonguss can resist Fairy-type attacks while also checking Keldeo, which resists all of Hydreigon's attacks. It also can provide Spore support, making it easier for Hydreigon to come in, or use Stun Spore on the likes of Tornadus-T and Latios, making Hydreigon harder to revenge kill.

Excadrill can help Hydreigon check Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Altaria and provide entry hazard removal while also appreciating Hydreigon's ability to take on defensive Water-types like Slowbro and Rotom-W. Mega Metagross can also take on Fairy-types and Pursuit trap the likes of Latios and Latias, which can offensively check Hydreigon. Rotom-W can provide Thunder Wave support, crippling the likes of Clefable, Latios, and Tornadus-T, and has Volt Switch to allow Hydreigon to come in more easily. Ferrothorn can resist Fairy-types' attacks and provide Spikes support, making Hydreigon harder to switch into. It can also provide Thunder Wave support to make Hydreigon harder to revenge kill.</p> "

  "Volcarona": {
    "overview": "<p>Quiver Dance Volcarona is one of the most dangerous sweepers in ORAS OU. Its STAB moves, Giga Drain, and Hidden Power make it very difficult to switch into, its boosted attacks OHKO most Pokemon, and it outspeeds everything but a few Choice Scarf users after boosting, meaning it is more often checked than countered. Although it seems that Volcarona can sweep through a majority of teams on paper, in reality, its Stealth Rock weakness mandates entry hazard removal and limits setup opportunities. Its low bulk makes it susceptible to priority moves from Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Crawdaunt, Dragonite, and Bisharp. Volcarona's sweeps are shut down by Chansey, and without the proper coverage, it is also be walled by bulky Fire- and Dragon-types like Heatran, Volcanion, Mega Charizard X, and Dragonite.</p> ",
    "comments": "<p>=========</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Ice can be used as a safer means of OHKOing bulky Ground-types like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. It also hits bulky Dragon-types like Mega Altaria and Dragonite harder. Fiery Dance can be used as a means of boosting while attacking; this is beneficial when faced with a Calm Mind sweeper like Clefable or Mega Latias. However, it is much less powerful than Fire Blast and is not as consistent as just using Quiver Dance. Life Orb Volcarona is an option that can be used to hit harder and sweep easier; however, its longevity is particularly bad given Volcarona's weakness to Stealth Rock. Unlike Timid Volcarona, +1 Modest Life Orb is able to surely OHKO Pokemon like Keldeo, Tyranitar, Rotom-W, Manaphy, Hippowdon, Gliscor, Gastrodon, and defensive Landorus-T. On hyper offense teams, Sitrus Berry can be a viable option if Stealth Rock is unable to be removed, giving Volcarona a slight boost in health to help it set up easier. Similarly, Passho Berry may allow Volcarona to set up more easily versus weak Water-types and reduce the likelihood of being revenge killed by Aqua Jet from Crawdaunt and Azumarill. Bulkier spreads with less Speed and Leftovers may also be used to increase Volcarona's longevity during a sweep. However, this increases Volcarona's chances of being outsped and severely damaged by Pokemon like Hydreigon and Excadrill while unboosted.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey's astronomical special bulk allows it to counter any variant of Volcarona and slowly KO it with Seismic Toss and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Due to Volcarona's low physical bulk, it needs to be at full health to take a hit while boosting. With Stealth Rock or Spikes up, Volcarona risks getting KOed while boosting and is more easily revenge killed by priority users.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, Dragonite, Crawdaunt, Azumarill, and Bisharp can all heavily chip or KO a boosted Volcarona. Talonflame is Volcarona's best check because it is immune to burn and can use Volcarona as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Coverage: Bulky Pokemon like Hippowdon, Garchomp, and Tornadus can take a hit from most +1 Volcarona and dent or KO them back with Rock Slide, Rock Tomb, or Smack Down.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fire-types: Volcarona is usually walled by the likes of Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran if not running the appropriate coverage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Pokemon like Volcanion and Suicune can take hits from Volcarona at +1 and remove its boosts with Haze or Roar.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Dragon-types: Without the appropriate coverage, Volcarona is unable to touch Mega Altaria, Mega Charizard X, and Dragonite. These Pokemon freely set up on Volcarona with Dragon Dance or simply KO it.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>+1 Volcarona is faster than all relevant Pokemon bar Sand Rush Excadrill and rare Choice Scarf users like Garchomp, Terrakion, and Keldeo. Bug Buzz allows Volcarona to hit Psychic-types like Latios, Latias, Mew, and Reuniclus as well as Dark-types that resist Fire like Hydreigon and Tyranitar. Giga Drain provides some recovery and KOes Water-types like Keldeo, Gastrodon, Manaphy, Slowbro, Starmie, and Rotom-W after one or two boosts. Hidden Power Ground allows Volcarona to severely damage or KO a few Pokemon that would normally switch into it such as Heatran and Volcanion.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Flame Body can punish priority users that may try to whittle Volcarona down such as Fake Out Medicham and Lopunny, which become setup fodder if burnt. Even if Volcarona is KOed, a Flame Body burn can allow other team members to set up. Lum Berry enables setup on Pokemon that can inflict status like Serperior, Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Slowbro. It also can save Volcarona from foes that run Prankster + Thunder Wave such as Thundurus and Klefki.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When using Volcarona, always look for ways to chip its checks and counters. Volcarona enjoys Stealth Rock for wearing down checks like Talonflame and Volcanion over time and needs Stealth Rock removed from its own side before setting up. Common Pokemon that Volcarona can set up on are Ferrothorn, Serperior, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss; Volcarona can set up on Pokemon Choice locked into the wrong move such as -2 Latios and Latias locked into Draco Meteor, Magnezone locked into Hidden Power Fire, and even Keldeo locked into Secret Sword if Stealth Rock is not up. Do not underestimate Volcarona's special bulk while it is boosting. If the opponent switches to a Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Manaphy, Rotom-W, or Slowbro, Volcarona can easily use Quiver Dance again, avoiding a 2HKO while threatening to OHKO back. While Volcarona is mostly used as a mid- or late-game sweeper, it can also be used early-game to wallbreak and lure its checks into getting chipped or trapped.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Volcarona appreciates entry hazard removal from spinners like Excadrill and Starmie and Defoggers like Latios and Latias. Excadrill can also set Stealth Rock and appreciates Volcarona's ability to deal with Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Slowbro, Tangrowth, and Skarmory. Latias is also an excellent partner outside of Defog, as it provides dual screens, Safeguard, and Healing Wish support. On more offensive teams, Volcarona appreciates partners that can switch into and overwhelm its checks and counters. Pokemon like Manaphy can switch into Aqua Jet from Azumarill and Crawdaunt, while Thundurus can switch into Talonflame and use it to set up. Manaphy can overwhelm special walls like Chansey and help eliminate Fire-types like Heatran and Talonflame as well as Dragon- and Ground-types like Mega Altaria, Dragonite, Garchomp, and Hippowdon. Thundurus can help eliminate bulky Water-types like Suicune and checks to Volcarona such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Dragonite. Serperior is a unique utility option because it can set up dual screens for Volcarona or bait in checks like Heatran and KO them with Hidden Power. Pokemon that appreciate other Steel-types being removed such as Mega Metagross, Mega Altaria, Mega Diancie, and Dragonite also pair well with Volcarona; they support Volcarona by removing Heatran with Earthquake or Earth Power. Pokemon that appreciate bulky Psychic-types being removed such as Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny pair well with Bug Buzz Volcarona. In return, they remove Chansey with High Jump Kick and bulky-Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp with Ice Punch. On bulkier teams, Volcarona appreciates partners that can chip or trap its checks and counters. Knock Off users such as Bisharp, Weavile, Tornadus-T, and Clefable can help Volcarona sweep by removing items like Assault Vest from Tornadus-T, Eviolite from Chansey, and Leftovers from Heatran, specially defensive Garchomp, and Clefable. Pursuit users like Tyranitar can help Volcarona by trapping and chipping Pokemon like Heatran and Talonflame. Glare Serperior, Thunder Wave Clefable, and Starmie are great partners that can cripple bulky Water-types, Charizard, Heatran, Tornadus-T, Keldeo, Manaphy, and Clefable with status. If Volcarona's checks get paralyzed, it gets chances at free setup turns and has less to fear from opposing setup sweepers like Manaphy. Toxic from Pokemon like Gastrodon and Slowbro can be very important to wear down Talonflame, bulky Dragon-types like Garchomp, Dragonite, and Mega Altaria, and Fire-types like Volcarona and Charizard.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute beats some of Volcarona's common countermeasures such as status and priority users like Crawdaunt, Bisharp, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny. With Quiver Dance, Volcarona gets the special bulk to become very hard to KO. Flamethrower is run over Fire Blast because it is easier to spam and fish for a burn, which makes Volcarona's Substitute harder to break. Bug Buzz is run along with Swarm to maximize damage output versus bulky Water- and Ground-types like Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Garchomp, which can break Volcarona's Substitute repeatedly.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>88 HP EVs prevent +1 Volcarona's Substitute from being broken by Heatran's Lava Plume, allowing it to use Heatran as setup fodder. 184 Speed EVs with a Timid nature make Volcarona faster than Adamant Mega Medicham, Modest Manaphy, and Jolly Excadrill unboosted and faster than Choice Scarf Landorus-T after boosting. 236 Special Attack EVs give Volcarona a good chance to OHKO Hippowdon and Garchomp at +1 and Gastrodon at +2 with Swarm and some prior damage. Leftovers recovers HP against weak, passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Amoonguss while setting up.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Entry hazard removal is even more important because this set relies on Leftovers recovery and multiple Quiver Dance boosts to tank hits. Since Volcarona is mostly used as a mid- or late-game sweeper, it is also important to weaken checks beforehand. This can be done with entry hazards, which weaken Heatran, Volcanion, and Talonflame, or status, which cripples foes like Garchomp and Gastrodon. Volcarona sets up Substitute on Pokemon like Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, Magnezone locked into Hidden Power Fire, and -2 Latios and Latias. At +1, it can continue setting up versus Lava Plume Heatran, Scald Alomomola, defensive Zapdos, and Clefable.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard setters like Excadrill are good teammates for wearing down Volcarona answers like Heatran, Volcanion, and Talonflame with Stealth Rock. Knock Off users such as Clefable, Serperior, and Mega Scizor can lure in these Fire-types, Assault Vest Tornadus-T, and Eviolite Chansey. Serperior can deal with Water-types and bait in Fire-types to cripple them with Glare, chip them with Leech Seed, or outright KO them with boosted Hidden Power. Gastrodon can importantly switch into Keldeo and chip foes with Scald and Toxic. It also can combat the Fire-type setup sweepers that threaten Volcarona like Mega Charizard X and Talonflame with Toxic and Clear Smog. Partners that can help break through Chansey include Tail Glow Manaphy, Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, Keldeo, and Breloom.</p> "

Cobalion has a high Defense stat and access to attacks such as Stealth Rock and Volt Switch, allowing it to support its team and gain momentum. It's able to take hits due to its Steel / Fighting typing, which gives it eight resistances as well as an immunity to Poison-type attacks. However, Cobalion has mediocre offensive stats that make it difficult for it to dish out heavy amounts of damage and achieve KOs, so it rather easily handled by common Pokemon. Although Cobalion is only weak to Fighting-, Fire-, and Ground-type attacks, offensive moves of these types are common and thus still manage to cause massive problems for it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance with three attacks is a possibility, as Cobalion's Defense, Speed, and multiple resistances give it opportunities to set up and proceed to sweep. However, Cobalion still suffers from a lack of power and finds difficulty in setting up the multiple boosts that would be required for it to sweep. Stone Edge can be used to hit Pokemon such as Charizard and Talonflame super effectively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types: Bulky Ground-type Pokemon such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon don't mind switching in against Cobalion and can threaten it out with a STAB Earthquake. If they're predicting the switch, they can also use the chance to set up Stealth Rock; Hippowdon and Gliscor can also use Slack Off and Roost to heal themselves.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-type Pokemon such as Slowbro, Starmie, and Gastrodon can take Iron Head and Close Combat with ease, not to mention they all have access to recovery. Cobalion only has 72 Special Defense, so it doesn't appreciate being hit or crippled by a burn with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-type Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, and Chandelure can take Iron Head and Close Combat and retaliate with their STAB Fire-type attacks; however, they have to be wary if they don't know Cobalion's full set, as they do not like being hit by Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Fast Revenge Killers: Fast revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Heatran, Choice Scarf Keldeo, and Manectric can come in after a teammate has fainted and threaten Cobalion out with their hard-hitting attacks due to Cobalion's mediocre Special Defense.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Close Combat is Cobalion's most powerful STAB attack and hits Pokemon such as Bisharp, Kyurem-B, and Tyranitar for super effective damage. Iron Head is a Steel-type STAB move that hits Fairy-types such as Clefable and Mega Gardevoir for super effective damage. Volt Switch allows Cobalion to gain momentum against several of its checks and counters by using it on the turn that they switch in. Taunt is great for crippling common switch-ins such as Mew and Skarmory and preventing Pokemon such as Landorus-T from setting up Stealth Rock. Stealth Rock is useful for damaging Pokemon as they switch in and can be used in the last slot if no other Pokemon on Cobalion's team has room to run it. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple Pokemon that don't mind switching in, such as Mega Charizard X. Hidden Power Ice is another option in the last slot to catch Gliscor and Landorus-T off-guard, as they don't mind taking an Iron Head or Close Combat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The 144 HP EVs allow Cobalion to survive an Earthquake from Excadrill and take it out with Close Combat while the Attack EVs ensure an OHKO on Mega Gardevoir with Iron Head and 2HKOs on Ferrothorn and specially defensive Heatran with Close Combat after Stealth Rock damage. Leftovers is chosen to keep Cobalion healthy as it switches into foes throughout the match. An alternate EV spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD and a Jolly nature can be run, letting Cobalion tank a Focus Blast from Timid Mega Gardevoir while avoiding the 2HKO from Life Orb Latios's Hidden Power Fire most of the time.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Volt Switch should be used constantly to gain momentum, but be cautious of common Ground-type switch-ins such as Gliscor and Landorus-T, which don't fear Cobalion's attacks if it isn't running Hidden Power Ice; double switches expecting these Pokemon can prove effective. Use Stealth Rock when Pokemon such as Bisharp and Tyranitar are on the field, as they will likely switch out, not wanting to get OHKOed. Bringing in Cobalion on a predicted Dark-type attack can be useful to gain it an Attack boost via Justified and dish out more significant damage, but this can prove risky if the Dark-type attack user is not Bisharp. Cobalion can be unpredictable with Hidden Power Ice and Thunder Wave if you choose to run one of those options, so revealing them too early can throw away the element of surprise against opponents with Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Mega Charizard X.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Landorus-T is an excellent partner, as it's able to check Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Excadrill, and Garchomp, which don't mind switching in on Cobalion. In return, Cobalion is able to remove Bisharp, which Landorus-T doesn't like switching in on due to Defiant; together, these Pokemon form a solid VoltTurn core. Mega Manectric is a great partner as well, being able to check Water-type Pokemon and forming a VoltTurn core with Landorus-T and Cobalion; however, keep in mind that you're stacking two not-so-strong VoltTurn Pokemon together, so Spikes to take advantage of the switches forced by using Volt Switch or other methods of stallbreaking are necessary. Latios keeps Water- and Fire-types in check, particularly Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y, and appreciates Cobalion's ability to check Pokemon such as Bisharp, Mega Gardevoir, and Tyranitar. Psychic-type Pokemon such as Mew and Slowbro also appreciate Cobalion for its ability to deal with Bisharp; Slowbro is also able to cover all of Cobalion's weaknesses by checking Fire- and Ground-type Pokemon and resisting Fighting-type attacks. Mega Latias is a good partner as Cobalion can check the Dark-types that get in its way.</p> "

  "Terrakion": {
    "overview": "<p>Terrakion is one of OU's most fearsome and underrated wallbreakers, and at a quick glance, it isn't difficult to see why. With a respectable Attack stat and extremely high-powered STAB attacks that have phenomenal coverage, Terrakion is an absolute nightmare to switch into. Furthermore, its ability, Justified, makes opponents fear using Dark-type moves multiple times, as Terrakion is able to get a free Attack boost off of these resisted attacks. As a result, Terrakion is a decent check to Weavile, Tyranitar, and Bisharp for offensive teams. Its Speed tier is just enough to revenge kill base 100s, especially the likes of Manaphy, Charizard, Jirachi, and Mega Gardevoir. However, while Terrakion is a menace offensively, its typing and mediocre bulk leave it wanting more in terms of defensive prowess. Being weak to common offensive attacking types, such as Ground, Fairy, Fighting, Water, and Steel, means switching Terrakion in is difficult, even on certain Knock Off users. On top of this, Close Combat's defense drops make it even easier to revenge kill with priority from the likes of Azumarill, Scizor, and Talonflame. Choice Scarf Terrakion lacks the raw firepower to break past the likes of Clefable, Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Landorus-T, while other more powerful sets are easily revenge killed due to their Speed. Nevertheless, even with its downsides, Terrakion proves itself as one of the most devastating wallbreakers in the tier and is a strong choice for most offensive teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Terrakion's movepool is quite shallow, so it struggles to find moves to use outside of its standard sets. Hidden Power Ice targets defensive Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, also preventing Terrakion from taking recoil damage from the former; however, it has very limited uses outside of hitting these targets and, for the most part, you're better off using one of Terrakion's STAB attacks to handle them. A set with a Focus Sash and Stealth Rock can be used to make Terrakion a decent suicide lead.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Priority: Priority from the likes of Azumarill, Breloom, Scizor, and Talonflame can cut Terrakion's sweep short, as Terrakion lacks the bulk to take these hits efficiently and has no priority of its own outside of the weak Quick Attack.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Since Terrakion is in a middling Speed tier, teams with hard-hitting Pokemon such as Alakazam, Latios, Mega Lopunny, Mega Metagross, Mega Diancie, and Serperior can all defeat a weakened Terrakion without a Rock Polish boost. Most Choice Scarf Pokemon have no issue defeating a weakened Terrakion either.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Although shakier checks against a Terrakion with a Swords Dance boost, most physically defensive Pokemon, such as Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and bulky Garchomp, are able to defeat Terrakion in a one-on-one situation; however, both Landorus-T and Garchomp are heavily pressured by the rare Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Mega Medicham: Mega Medicham is one of the best offensive checks to Terrakion, as it is not 2HKOed by any of Terrakion's moves and can OHKO back with its STAB attacks or pick it off with Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro and Mega Slowbro</strong>: Mega Slowbro fears nothing from Terrakion and can easily OHKO with Scald or Psyshock after any prior damage. Slowbro takes on any Terrakion set, with the exception of Adamant Swords Dance, and can recover any damage by switching out thanks to Regenerator. However, both must be wary of Toxic, which heavily cripples them.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Close Combat is Terrakion's most powerful STAB attack, and it heavily damages even Pokemon that resist it and plows through offensive checks. Stone Edge targets the likes of Azumarill, Tornadus-T, Talonflame, and Landorus-T if they attempt to switch in. Rock Slide provides Terrakion with a more accurate Rock-type STAB attack that is better when you're finishing off a weakened target; however, the power difference compared to Stone Edge is extremely noticeable, and it fails to KO certain targets that Stone Edge would. Iron Head lets Terrakion heavily pressure the likes of Clefable without having to rely on the shaky accuracy of Stone Edge. Quick Attack gives Terrakion some form of priority, allowing it to revenge kill a heavily weakened Charizard X or Mega Lopunny. However, even with a Choice Band, the move is extremely weak, and it should only be used when the target is guaranteed to be KOed by it. Earthquake is another option, targeting the likes of Jirachi, Metagross, and Klefki, damaging them a bit more than Close Combat and also not lowering Terrakion's defenses. Unfortunately, Earthquake is a terrible move to be Choice-locked into, as Flying-types and Pokemon with the ability Levitate are immune to it, and it is fairly weak against bulkier walls.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in its Attack stat provides Terrakion with as much physical prowess as possible, and maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows it to outpace base 100 Speed Pokemon and Speed tie with Keldeo. When it has a Choice Band equipped, Terrakion's Attack stat soars to sky-high levels, and it is able to blow past a large portion of the metagame. Justified is Terrakion's only ability and is sometimes situational, but it allows Terrakion to get an Attack boost off a Dark-type move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bring Terrakion in during the early game, if possible. Thanks to its insane power with a Choice Band, Terrakion is able to heavily weaken most foes, giving teammates an easier time to sweep later on. Unless Terrakion has a guaranteed KO on the opposing Pokemon, try not to leave it on the field after a use of Close Combat, as its defenses become pathetic afterwards. Terrakion is best switched in after a teammate's slow U-turn or Volt Switch, as its mediocre typing prevents it from switching directly into hard-hitting attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Choice Band Terrakion's natural wallbreaking potential, such as Swords Dance Talonflame, Weavile, Mega Scizor, and Mega Lopunny, make good teammates. The last forms a fantastic Fighting-spam core and together they break down each other's checks and counters. Latias and Latios are able to safely switch into Fighting-, Water-, and Ground-type attacks targeted at Terrakion, and Terrakion is able to get a Justified Attack boost from Dark-type attacks aimed at the duo. Grass-types, such as Serperior, Mega Venusaur, and Celebi, are able to defeat the likes of Azumarill, Hippowdon, Slowbro, Suicune, and Landorus-T. Electric-types such as Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Raikou handle Water-types that are able to stomach Terrakion's attacks. Dark-types, such as Bisharp and Weavile, defeat Slowbro and Celebi and pressure Hippowdon and Gliscor. Fairy-types, such as Mega Altaria, Clefable, and Mega Gardevoir, maul physical walls, allowing Terrakion to go wild late game with Close Combat. Magnezone traps and KOes Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn, which can all handle a Terrakion locked into the wrong move. Hazard setters such as Klefki, which can provide speed control with Thunder Wave, Tyranitar, which gives Terrakion a Special Defense boost but shares awful typing synergy with it; and Landorus-T, which help Terrakion achieve OHKOs or 2HKOs it could not normally get.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance is Terrakion's main setup move, boosting its Attack to sky-high levels. This allows Terrakion to blow through general checks, especially the likes of Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Garchomp. Close Combat is an extremely high-powered STAB move that tears apart Pokemon that do not resist it. Stone Edge provides fantastic neutral coverage with Close Combat, nailing Flying-types, such as Tornadus-T and Talonflame, if they attempt to switch in. Substitute prevents status from the likes of Thundurus, and Klefki, which can give Terrakion an opportunity to sweep. On the other hand, Rock Polish boosts Terrakion's Speed to astronomical levels, allowing it to easily outpace the entire unboosted metagame. Stealth Rock is another possibility, used to wear down Pokemon as they switch in, and Terrakion can set it up on a predicted switch. Quick Attack is a final option that gives Terrakion some form of priority and picks off faster, weakened targets. However, it is extremely weak, even at +2.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Terrakion's Attack and Speed stats with a Jolly nature lets it hit as hard as possible and outpace base 100 Speed Pokemon, such as Charizard, Manaphy, and Gardevoir, while Speed tying with Keldeo and other Terrakion. An Adamant nature can be used over Jolly, allowing Terrakion at +2 to OHKO Hippowdon, Calm Mind Manaphy, defensive Garchomp, Slowbro, and Gliscor. Sadly, missing out on outspeeding opposing base 100 Speed Pokemon, which often run maximum Speed and a positive nature, is a huge thorn in Terrakion's side, leaving Jolly as the preferred nature for the majority of the time. Life Orb is the best item for Terrakion, sacrificing a small amount of HP each turn while providing a significant increase to attacking prowess. Justified is Terrakion's only ability, and it is useful when Terrakion is hit by a Dark-type move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Instead of setting up with Swords Dance turn one, Terrakion's best play early-game is to use Close Combat or Stone Edge. This whittles down defensive walls very quickly, allowing Terrakion to muscle through them with Swords Dance-boosted attacks later. Against offensive teams, boosting Attack isn't as important as blowing through frailer Pokemon with its dual STAB combination, as most of such teams will have a solid way to defeat Terrakion due to its questionable Speed. When using Close Combat, be wary of the defense drops that come along with it. Lowering Terrakion's mediocre defenses even further makes it extremely vulnerable to priority from the likes of Azumarill, Scizor, and Talonflame and to revenge killers, such as Latios, Mega Manectric, Mega Metagross, and most Choice Scarf users. Terrakion is best switched in through a slow U-turn or Volt Switch from a teammate, as predicting wrong is very costly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Terrakion has very limited switch-ins, and the majority of them, particularly the likes of Celebi and Slowbro, are heavily pressured by various Dark-type Pokemon, such as Weavile and Bisharp. Latios and Latias appreciate Terrakion's ability to check Tyranitar and Bisharp, and, in return, the duo is able to defeat most bulky Ground- and Water-types that threaten Terrakion. Grass-types, such as Serperior, Mega Venusaur, and Celebi, pressure Ground- and Water-types with their respective STAB attacks. Fairy-types, such as Mega Altaria, Clefable, and Mega Gardevoir, can also break down physical walls such as Garchomp and Hippowdon. Magnezone traps Mega Scizor and Skarmory, the former being difficult for certain offensive teams to properly handle, allowing Terrakion to bust through the opposing team once they are eliminated.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Close Combat is Terrakion's most devastating move and, even without a boosting item, tears through weakened Pokemon that don't resist it. However, it comes with the cost of lowering Terrakion's defenses after its use. Stone Edge provides phenomenal coverage with Close Combat, targeting Flying-, Ghost-, and Psychic types, especially the likes of Talonflame, Latios, Mega Charizard Y, and Tornadus-T. Rock Slide provides Terrakion with a more accurate way of finishing off weakened targets and does not have the nasty side effect of lowering its defenses. However, the power drop between this and Terrakion's other options is quite noticeable. On the other hand, Toxic cripples bulky walls, such as Hippowdon, Slowbro, Garchomp, and Landorus-T, as they switch in to handle an attack. Iron Head gives Terrakion a way to deal heavy damage to Fairy-types, doing decent damage to Clefable, OHKOing Mega Diancie, and OHKOing Mega Gardevoir after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment allows Terrakion to deal as much damage as possible. A Choice Scarf lets Terrakion outspeed the unboosted metagame and revenge kill Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Mega Lopunny, and +1 Mega Charizard X, and maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows it to stay in its crucial Speed tier if it happens to lose its Choice Scarf to Knock Off. Justified is Terrakion's only ability and gives Terrakion an attack boost if it is hit by a Dark-type move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When using Terrakion late-game to clean up, make sure you don't overestimate its firepower. While its moves have high Base Power, sometimes even such power isn't enough to KO a target. Make sure everything is weakened to a degree that Terrakion can break past it. Terrakion serves as a fantastic revenge killer to certain Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Tyranitar and Jirachi, as well as most Dragon Dance users. This includes Dragonite, a weakened Mega Altaria, and Mega Charizard X. Terrakion's already mediocre defenses are lowered even further by Close Combat's drops, so if the opponent has a powerful priority user such as Scizor or Azumarill, be wary of mindlessly clicking it. Although Terrakion has access to Justified, switching directly in to Knock Off is generally an unfavorable play; due to the nature of offensive teams, Terrakion desperately wants to keep its Choice Scarf to be able to outspeed otherwise faster Pokemon. When pinned up against the likes of Landorus-T and Slowbro, catch them on the switch with Toxic to cripple them. Just beware that locking Terrakion into Toxic means it can be taken advantage of.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Grass-types, such as Serperior, Mega Venusaur, and Celebi, break down the likes of Hippowdon, Azumarill, Quagsire, and Suicune, which are all decent checks to Terrakion. Latios and Latias provide Defog support, and Healing Wish support in the latter's case, and check Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-types for Terrakion. In return, Terrakion handily defeats Bisharp and Tyranitar. Water-types, such as Manaphy, Azumarill, and Starmie, handle Ground-types that Choice Scarf Terrakion might not have the power to break through before they are weakened. Fairy-types, such as Clefable, and Mega Gardevoir, hit physical walls hard with their respective STAB attacks and break down Terrakion's answers such as Slowbro. Dark-types such as Bisharp and Weavile pressure defensive walls, such as Garchomp and Hippowdon, early on, so that Terrakion has an easier time defeating them. Magnezone traps Mega Scizor and Skarmory, as Terrakion lacks the power to defeat them if they are near full health.</p> "

  "Tornadus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>With a great Speed tier, powerful Flying-type STAB move in Hurricane, and abundance of coverage and utility moves to choose from, Tornadus-T has all of the tools necessary to be a top-tier Pokemon in ORAS OU. Tornadus-T’s upsides don’t end there, however. It was also gifted one of the best abilities in the game in Regenerator, making it one of the few Pokemon that can effectively utilize Assault Vest. The combination of Regenerator and Assault Vest, plus its access to U-turn, makes Tornadus-T one of the best pivots in the metagame. However, although Tornadus-T’s mono-Flying typing gives it a few crucial immunities and resistances, it is also one of Tornadus-T’s greatest impediments. With Stealth Rock taking away 25% of its HP every time it switches in, Tornadus-T can quickly get overwhelmed by the Pokemon it is supposed to check.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Air Slash is an option on the Assault Vest set if you want a more accurate Flying-type STAB move; the huge drop in power is usually not worth it, however. Icy Wind has some merit, since it drops the foe's Speed. The only reason to run Ice-type coverage on Tornadus-T is to check Gliscor, though, and Icy Wind is not a guaranteed 2HKO. Focus Blast can be used over Superpower, but it is much less consistent due to its lower accuracy. On top of that, the Pokemon that you want to hit with your Fighting-type coverage are generally bulkier on the special side, such as Chansey, Heatran, and Tyranitar, so Superpower does more to them.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Zapdos is probably the best counter to Tornadus-T, as it resists the majority of Tornadus-T's attacks and can recover any damage taken with Roost. Rotom-W can switch into Tornadus-T and can get a slow Volt Switch off against it or threaten it with a Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave. Rotom-W does not appreciate its item being removed by Knock Off, however, as Leftovers is its only form of recovery outside of Pain Split. Thundurus is a Pokemon that can offensively check Tornadus-T, as it naturally resists Tornadus-T's STAB move and U-turn. It must be wary of Hidden Power Ice and Knock Off, though.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Many Steel-types can check Tornadus-T if it lacks the proper coverage move to hit them. Heatran can check all non-Superpower variants of Tornadus-T, as it resists both Hurricane and U-turn. Heatran's only form of recovery is Leftovers, however, so once it gets hit by Knock Off, it is very easy to wear down. Specially defensive Skarmory is able to switch into Assault Vest Tornadus-T if it lacks Heat Wave. Specially defensive Jirachi is one of the best answers to Tornadus-T, as it is naturally bulky and has access to Wish, which allows it to stay healthy. Choice Scarf Jirachi can also revenge kill Tornadus-T fairly reliably. Lastly, Mega Metagross can check all Tornadus-T variants, as Heat Wave only has a small chance to 2HKO it, and its Ice Punch and Thunder Punch both have an almost certain chance to OHKO Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Tyranitar is able to switch into non-Superpower Tornadus-T and threaten it out with its Rock-type STAB moves, although U-turn will quickly wear it down. Tyranitar also has the option to Pursuit trap Tornadus-T. Mega Diancie can switch into Tornadus-T a couple of times and threaten it out with Diamond Storm. Mega Aerodactyl is a Pokemon that can switch into all of Tornadus-T's attacks and recover off the damage with or threaten it with a powerful Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Specially defensive Pokemon that are not weak to Tornadus-T's coverage such as Clefable, Gliscor, Slowking, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon can all switch into non-offensive Tornadus-T and heal off the damage with their recovery moves. These Pokemon will get shut down by the rare Taunt Tornadus-T, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Faster Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Weavile, Mega Manectric, Sand Rush Excadrill, and some Choice Scarf Pokemon can outspeed and revenge kill Tornadus-T. Most of these Pokemon can not switch into Tornadus-T's attacks, however. Weavile is a Pokemon worth highlighting for its ability to Pursuit trap Tornadus-T.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hurricane provides Tornadus-T with a strong Flying-type STAB move, allowing it to hit Pokemon such as Serperior and Keldeo hard. The second moveslot is very team dependent. Heat Wave allows Tornadus-T to hit Pokemon such as Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, and other Steel-types hard and is generally the best option. Superpower allows Tornadus-T to threaten Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Heatran. Hidden Power Ice can be used if your team needs a back-up check to Gliscor and hits Garchomp and Landorus-T harder than Hurricane would, but it is usually the least useful of the three options. If your team is weak to Mega Charizard Y or Volcarona, Smack Down is an option that allows Tornadus-T to hit them for super effective damage. This is usually not recommended, though, as Smack Down is very weak and Tornadus-T’s ability to check Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona with it is shaky at best. For its final two moveslots, Knock Off and U-turn are both mandatory for Tornadus-T. Knock Off allows Tornadus-T to cripple its switch-ins by removing their item, while U-turn lets Tornadus-T gain momentum and make use of its wonderful ability in Regenerator.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Assault Vest allows Tornadus-T to check common special attackers such as Keldeo, Serperior, and Latios. 252 Speed EVs with a Speed-boosting nature allows Tornadus-T to outspeed Pokemon such as Starmie, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Serperior, and the rare Alakazam. When running Superpower, a Jolly nature can be used to guarantee that Tornadus-T can get the OHKO against no bulk Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and deal more damage to Pokemon such as Heatran and Excadrill. When running Hidden Power Ice, a spread of 144 HP / 148 SpA / 216 Spe is recommended with a Timid nature, allowing Tornadus-T to 2HKO Gliscor with Hidden Power Ice while still outspeeding Choice Scarf Tyranitar and keeping as much bulk as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tornadus-T should be used as a pivot against common special attackers such as Keldeo and Latios. When Stealth Rock is not on the field, Tornadus-T can switch into these Pokemon pretty freely thanks to its incredible special bulk with an Assault Vest and its ability Regenerator. When Stealth Rock is set, however, Tornadus-T must be much more careful. For example, after Stealth Rock damage, Mega Alakazam is able to 2HKO Tornadus-T with Psychic, and Choice Specs Latios has a slight chance to OHKO Tornadus-T with Draco Meteor. Choice Specs Keldeo is also able to muscle through Tornadus-T with either Hydro Pump or Scald after a couple of switch ins.</p> <p>If Tornadus-T does not have any significant defensive value versus your opponent's team, you can make use of its access to Knock Off to remove items from Pokemon such as Heatran, Clefable, and Rotom-W, crippling them for the rest of the game and opening up doors for Tornadus-T's teammates. All three of the aforementioned Pokemon can carry status moves, though, so you must carefully weigh the risk of getting inflicted by status in return for removing an item.</p> <p>During battle, it is often best to switch Tornadus-T into a Pokemon that it checks and then use U-turn to gain momentum and gauge your opponent's reaction to Tornadus-T or Knock Off to punish your opponent's switch-in. Hurricane, since it can be a big momentum killer early- to mid-game, should usually only be used late-game when your opponent's team is weakened or in a scenario where it is too risky to use U-turn or Knock Off.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Assault Vest Tornadus-T fits well on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its ability to sponge special attacks and maintain offensive momentum. Bulky Ground-types such as TankChomp, Gliscor, and Hippowdon pair well with Tornadus-T, as all three are able to switch into Tyranitar and are immune to Electric-type attacks, and the former two are also able to switch into Heatran, while Tornadus-T is able to tank hits from strong Water- and Grass-types such as Keldeo and Serperior. Gastrodon is also worth mentioning for its ability to wall all of the relevant Electric-types in the tier. Excadrill is also a good partner, as it is able to remove Stealth Rock and switch into Pokemon such as Clefable. Strong Water- and Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Azumarill, and Mega Medicham can take advantage of some of Tornadus-T's common checks and appreciate the safe switches that it gives them. Clefable is a solid partner, as it is able to switch into Pokemon that force Tornadus-T out such as Weavile and Choice Scarf Tyranitar, as well as Rotom-W and Zapdos. Clefable also appreciates Tornadus-T removing the items from Pokemon such as Heatran and Excadrill. Similarly, Serperior appreciates Tornadus-T's ability to remove Heatran's item, and it is also able to switch into and threaten Pokemon such as Rotom-W. Lastly, strong Steel-types such as Mega Metagross and Mega Scizor are able to take advantage of Tornadus-T pivoting out versus Clefable, and the latter also appreciates Tornadus-T's ability to remove the items from Pokemon such as Heatran and Rotom-W.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Wallbreaker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>One of the things that makes offensive Tornadus-T so dangerous is its access to STAB Hurricane, a move that compensates for its 70% accuracy with raw power. Superpower is the coverage option of choice, as it enables Tornadus-T to hit Tyranitar, Heatran, Chansey, and Excadrill for super effective damage and hits all of them harder than Focus Blast would. Taunt is used to stop Pokemon such as Gliscor, Clefable, Chansey, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon from using their recovery moves, which helps Tornadus-T break through bulkier teams. It can also be used to deny entry hazards from various Pokemon, such as Garchomp and Ferrothorn. In the last slot, you can use either Knock Off or U-turn. Knock Off is useful when going against Chansey or Rotom-W, since removing their item will severely cripple them. It is also useful against Zapdos and opposing Assault Vest Tornadus-T. If you would prefer gaining momentum over removing items, you can use U-turn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>76 Attack EVs alongside a Life Orb allows Tornadus-T to OHKO offensive Excadrill and most non-Chople Berry Tyranitar with Superpower. It also allows Tornadus-T to 2HKO maximum HP investment Heatran after Stealth Rock and maximum HP investment Bold Chansey after removing its Eviolite. 252 Speed EVs with a positive nature should be used to take advantage of Tornadus-T's incredible Speed tier, outspeeding Pokemon such as Thundurus, Serperior, and Starmie and Speed tying with opposing Tornadus-T. A Naive nature is usually preferred to take hits from priority users such as Mega Scizor, Azumarill, and Bisharp better; however, a Hasty nature can be used if you need Tornadus-T to switch into special attackers like Serperior. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Attack to maximize the power of Tornadus-T's Hurricane, allowing it to 2HKO Gliscor and Bold Clefable. Regenerator gives Tornadus-T the longevity it needs to properly break bulkier teams.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When playing against bulkier teams, Tornadus-T should be used as a wallbreaker. This means bringing it in safely on Pokemon that it threatens out and then punching holes into the opponent's team with Hurricane or using Knock Off to remove an item or U-turn to gain momentum. When playing against more offensive teams, you should take advantage of Tornadus-T's excellent Speed tier and use it as a revenge killer. You can also make use of Tornadus-T's natural bulk and switch it into Pokemon such as Serperior, although you should be wary of a potential Glare. Even with Regenerator recovery, Tornadus-T can quickly be worn down from Stealth Rock damage, Life Orb recoil, and attack damage. This means that you should always be aware of the importance of Tornadus-T's HP and shouldn't throw it into attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Some of the biggest thorns in Tornadus-T's side are Electric-types, primarily Rotom-W and Zapdos, so teammates that can wear down or lure in those two Pokemon are appreciated. Slowbro is a notable mention, especially if running Toxic. Even without Toxic, Slowbro can still fish for Scald burns against these Pokemon, and Tornadus-T is able to check Grass-types that threaten Slowbro. Heatran is another Pokemon that can lure in and potentially poison or burn Rotom-W. Speaking of Rotom-W, it actually functions well alongside Tornadus-T, as it is able to use Volt Switch against Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Tangrowth, giving Tornadus-T a free switch in. Starmie is a Pokemon that functions in a similar way to Slowbro, luring in Rotom-W and other Electric-types and either burning or poisoning them. Starmie is also able to remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Tornadus-T is able to help Starmie by luring in Tyranitar and KOing it with Superpower. Excadrill can also remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin for Tornadus-T, and Sand Rush variants can run Toxic to lure in and cripple Rotom-W. Hippowdon is another notable teammate, as it can check the majority of Tornadus-T's offensive answers such as Mega Metagross, Mega Diancie, and Sand Rush Excadrill. Hippowdon can also lure in Rotom-W and inflict it with Toxic poison. Lastly, Serperior can check Rotom-W and appreciates Tornadus-T's ability to lure in Heatran and damage it with Superpower. Serperior is also able to catch opposing Assault Vest Tornadus-T with Glare, making your own Tornadus-T's job much easier.</p> "

  "Thundurus": {
    "overview": "<p>Thundurus has many qualities that make it a huge offensive threat in the OU metagame. It outspeeds a majority of the OU tier given that it lies just above the crucial base 110 Speed tier. It has good mixed offensive stats, which makes it hard to fully counter, especially given its fantastic offensive movepool. It also has access to a great boosting move in Nasty Plot, giving it the ability to considerably threaten defensive teams. Prankster gives it priority on Thunder Wave; this lets it act as an emergency check to sweepers and faster threats, giving it valuable utility for a lot of teams. It also has another good ability in Defiant, which enhances the effectiveness of mixed sets by its ability to negate Intimidate's effect and gives it a place on entry hazard-reliant teams as a Defog deterrent. Thundurus's good typing enables it to check huge threats such as Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, and Tornadus-T, and its Ground immunity enables it to switch in on the likes of Gliscor and Choice Scarf Landorus-T locked into Earthquake, which sets it apart from other offensive Electric-types. Unfortunately, Thundurus is frail, and it is also very prone to being worn down because of its Stealth Rock weakness. It only has access to good Electric-type STAB moves with its most powerful reliable Flying-type move being Hidden Power Flying. This makes it very reliant on coverage moves to break past Pokemon that resist Electric. Despite its many coverage options, Thundurus also has a hard time fitting all that it needs to in one moveset, and while Thundurus's Speed tier is very good, it still leaves it outsped by a good number of threats such as Mega Lopunny, Talonflame, Weavile, and Mega Manectric.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute lets Thundurus scout for switches and dodge Sucker Punch, and it gets priority thanks to Prankster; however, it is rarely worth the loss of coverage. Bulk Up is Thundurus's only option for a physical boosting move and can be used on purely physical sets as a way to overwhelm certain defensive Pokemon such as Celebi. Thunder should be used on rain teams because it cannot miss in rain and has more Base Power and a higher paralysis chance than Thunderbolt. U-turn can act as a pivoting move that isn't blocked by Ground-types, but it is rarely worth the moveslot. Instead of Life Orb or Leftovers, damage-reducing Berries can be used: Charti Berry reduces damage from Tyranitar and Landorus-T's Stone Edge, while Yache Berry lets Thundurus survive Ice Shard from Mamoswine and Weavile more easily. Incinerate is Thundurus's best option against Ferrothorn and Scizor, but it is very weak and vastly inferior to Focus Blast otherwise, despite the much higher accuracy. Flash Cannon hits Fairy-types super effectively and, unlike Sludge Wave, OHKOes Mega Diancie, but it is weaker than Sludge Wave against other targets. Similarly, Iron Tail acts as a way for physical Thundurus to bypass Fairies.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types are immune to Thundurus's STAB moves, making them good natural checks to Thundurus. Mixed defensive Hippowdon with Stone Edge is one of the best answers to Thundurus as long as it does not carry Grass Knot. Water / Ground types such as Mega Swampert, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad are immune to Thunderbolt and take very little damage from Hidden Power Ice; however, they cannot handle Grass Knot variants either. Mamoswine can switch into both Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice and check Thundurus with Ice Shard, but it fears Focus Blast and Grass Knot.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types can serve as good checks to Thundurus due to their Electric resistance as long as they do not take too much damage from Hidden Power Ice. Latios and Latias can both take Thunderbolt followed by Hidden Power Ice (particularly Latias due to its added bulk) and OHKO back with Draco Meteor; however, neither can switch into Hidden Power Ice, and both fear Knock Off. Mega Latias is a much better Thundurus counter; its additional bulk and the fact that it carries a Mega Stone prevent Hidden Power Ice and Knock Off from 2HKOing it. Bulky Mega Altaria can handle most Thundurus sets quite well and can even remove paralysis via Heal Bell, but it can be overpowered by a Nasty Plot set. Mega Charizard X can switch into Thundurus rather well, especially with a specially defensive set; however, it fears Focus Blast. Kyurem-B can easily handle any set without Fighting-type coverage, but it loses to those that do carry it. Dragalge has enough special bulk to survive Thundurus's attacks and enough power to OHKO Thundurus with Draco Meteor. Goodra is quite a good check to special Thundurus, but it struggles against physical sets due to its lackluster physical bulk.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types, much like Dragon-types, resist Thundurus's Electric-type STAB moves and often have enough bulk to take Hidden Power Ice quite well. Mega Venusaur is one of the best Thundurus counters, only fearing Hidden Power Ice before it Mega Evolves, as well as the rare Psychic and Hidden Power Flying. Celebi deals with most of Thundurus's sets quite well, having enough mixed bulk to avoid the 2HKO from both Hidden Power Ice and Knock Off, but it can be overwhelmed by Nasty Plot or Taunt sets due to its lack of offensive presence. Amoonguss is bulky enough not to be 2HKOed by Hidden Power Ice and can put Thundurus to sleep, but, much like Venusaur, it struggles against Psychic and Hidden Power Flying. It also falls prey to Taunt sets and cannot reliably beat Thundurus if Sleep Clause is broken unless it runs Synthesis. Assault Vest Tangrowth can take Hidden Power Ice quite well and Knock Off Thundurus's item, but it dislikes Knock Off itself.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Most special walls can handle Thundurus very well as long as it runs a special set and does not carry Taunt. Specifically, specially bulky Fairy-types resist both of mixed Thundurus's physical moves and can therefore take it on quite well. Clefable is a very reliable Thundurus counter; it can even counter Nasty Plot sets due to Unaware. The same applies to Sylveon, whose additional power enables it to 2HKO Thundurus, which Clefable cannot do without a boost. Chansey is a surefire counter to any special Thundurus set, even being able to shrug off two +2 Life Orb-boosted Focus Blasts. Mew and Jirachi are both solid special walls that can handle Thundurus quite well; however, both can be overpowered by Nasty Plot sets or crippled by Knock Off. Cresselia has a massive amount of mixed bulk as well as Ice Beam, giving it the ability to take on any Thundurus set very well. Heatran can handle any Thundurus set that does not carry Focus Blast or Superpower, but it's prone to being worn down. Despite being an offensive Pokemon, Mega Gardevoir has enough special bulk to act as a solid Thundurus check, avoiding the 2HKO from any move other than Life Orb Thunderbolt and easily OHKOing back.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Fast Electric-types serve as very good checks to Thundurus, not only resisting its main STAB moves and taking neutral damage from all of its coverage moves but also being immune to Thunder Wave. Raikou is a solid Thundurus check, only fearing Knock Off and Superpower from the mixed set. Mega Manectric is also a good check, though it struggles to switch into Focus Blast and cannot take Superpower from the mixed set either because Intimidate triggers Defiant. Thundurus-T is immune to Thundurus's Electric-type STAB moves, but it takes solid damage from Hidden Power Ice. Mega Ampharos is a good Thundurus check, taking almost no damage from Thunderbolt and having enough special bulk to take Hidden Power Ice quite well; however, its lack of reliable recovery prevents it from checking it consistently, unless it runs a specially defensive RestTalk set, which can be overwhelmed by Nasty Plot.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users and Faster Attackers: Pokemon that outspeed Thundurus can usually revenge kill it, especially if they are immune to Thunder Wave. Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Choice Scarf Garchomp, and Sand Rush Excadrill in sand can all freely switch into Thundurus's STAB moves and can OHKO it with Rock-type coverage; however, they are all KOed by one of Thundurus's common coverage moves. Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Choice Scarf Tyrantrum can both switch into Thunderbolt and OHKO back with their Rock-type STAB moves, but both are crippled by Thunder Wave and neither can take a Focus Blast. Mega Sceptile serves as quite a good Thundurus check because Lightning Rod gives it an immunity to and a power boost from switching into Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave, but it cannot take Hidden Power Ice. Weavile cannot switch into any of Thundurus's moves bar Hidden Power Ice, but it can bypass Thunder Wave with Ice Shard. Starmie can switch into Hidden Power Ice or a Fighting-type move and can hit Thundurus with Ice Beam without fearing paralysis too much due to Natural Cure, but it isn't guaranteed to OHKO from full health, and Thundurus OHKOes back with Thunderbolt. Mega Lopunny can revenge kill a slightly weakened Thundurus, but it fears both Thunder Wave and the Electric- and Fighting-type moves Thundurus usually carries. Mega Aerodactyl beats Thundurus one-on-one with Stone Edge, while Mega Alakazam can deal massive damage to Thundurus with Psychic and, if it runs Taunt and Traces Prankster, can prevent Thundurus from paralyzing it if it predicts correctly; however, this is very risky.</p> ",

        "name": "Thunder Wave + 3 Attacks",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunder Wave enables Thundurus to paralyze faster attackers and sweepers, preventing them from sweeping and enabling Thundurus to act as a one-time emergency check. Thunderbolt is Thundurus's main offensive move; it acts as a powerful, reliable, and accurate STAB move. Hidden Power Ice gets perfect coverage alongside Thunderbolt; specifically, it hits Ground-types such as Gliscor and Landorus-T, Dragon-types such as Latios and Garchomp, and certain Grass-types such as Serperior and Chesnaught. Focus Blast provides powerful coverage on Pokemon that resist Electric such as Ferrothorn, Mega Charizard X, Raikou, Mega Manectric, Kyurem-B, Magnezone, and Quagsire, as well as certain specially bulky Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Heatran. Grass Knot is also a good option on Thundurus because it 2HKOes Hippowdon, a very common Thundurus check, 2HKOes Mega Swampert, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad, and OHKOes Quagsire. Psychic and Hidden Power Flying are both options that enable Thundurus to lure Mega Venusaur and KO it. Hidden Power Flying should be used if Hidden Power Ice is not used, as it also targets Celebi and Serperior; otherwise, Psychic should be used. Taunt can be used to shut down defensive Pokemon such as Celebi, but it comes at the cost of important coverage. Knock Off enables Thundurus to hit Latios and Latias very hard while serving as a useful utility move. Sludge Wave 2HKOes Clefable, Celebi, and Mega Altaria, all of which wall this set otherwise.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Prankster gives Thundurus priority on Thunder Wave, allowing it to cripple sweepers and faster attackers. Life Orb increases Thundurus's power while still giving it the freedom to switch moves, enabling it to use Thunder Wave without being locked into it. Leftovers can be used for more longevity, but Thundurus loses out on a lot of power. A spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe gives Thundurus as much speed and power as possible while giving it an odd HP number, reducing the damage it takes from Stealth Rock. A Timid nature increases Thundurus's Speed, enabling it to outspeed base 110 Speed Pokemon. However, a Naive nature should be used if Knock Off is chosen as a coverage move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Thundurus should be used just as with any other attacker, using Thunderbolt most of the time and switching out of its checks and counters. When using Thundurus, try to predict around certain Pokemon that resist Electric, especially if it's carrying a lure move such as Grass Knot or Psychic. Thunder Wave should be used against sweepers that can otherwise sweep your team, such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Altaria, and Mega Lopunny. However, you should avoid directly sending Thundurus into these sweepers because they might KO it; instead, use VoltTurn support or sacrifice something else to get a free switch into them. There are a few situations where paralyzing a slower Pokemon can be beneficial. For example, if Thundurus is facing a Pokemon that it cannot OHKO and outspeeds and beats everything else on your team, paralyzing it is the best course of action.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Thundurus fits well on offensive teams in need of an emergency check to multiple sweepers that also has offensive presence. It also fits on teams that need an offensive check to Steel-types such as Scizor and Mega Metagross. If Thundurus is used as the team's primary stop to sweepers, make sure your team also has checks to sweepers that are not crippled by paralysis, such as Azumarill to cover Sand Rush Excadrill and Lum Berry Dragonite. Thundurus is checked by Psychic-types such as Latios, Mew, Jirachi, and Reuniclus; therefore, it appreciates Pursuit support from the likes of Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Weavile. Thundurus benefits from being paired up with Pokemon that can beat or weaken its checks. For example, Swords Dance Bisharp serves as a good partner for its ability to check Clefable, Latios, and Latias and severely weaken Hippowdon. Clefable deals with most Dragon-, Electric-, and Ground-types and really enjoys Thundurus's ability to check Steel-types and paralyze Pokemon such as Venusaur and Mega Charizard X. If Thundurus is running Grass Knot or Psychic, it can support certain teammates by eliminating their checks. For instance, it can get rid of Hippowdon and Quagsire for Mega Charizard X and Talonflame via Grass Knot or remove Mega Venusaur for Azumarill thanks to Psychic. Thundurus appreciates support from an entry hazard remover, but one isn't required if you're using a very offensive team, which doesn't require Thundurus to switch in often and can keep Stealth Rock off by pressuring the opponent's setter. Wallbreakers benefit from Thundurus's ability to paralyze Pokemon and in return pose a big threat to balanced and stall teams, which Thundurus struggles against.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Nasty Plot serves as a powerful boosting move that helps Thundurus break past defensive Pokemon such as Celebi and Jirachi. Thunderbolt is Thundurus's best STAB move, hitting anything that doesn't resist it for good damage. Hidden Power Ice gives Thundurus excellent coverage alongside Thunderbolt, hitting Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Garchomp for 4x super effective damage. Focus Blast gets very good neutral coverage and hits Ferrothorn and Chansey super effectively. Grass Knot is Thundurus's best option against Hippowdon and Water / Ground types. Thunder Wave can be used if you need Thundurus to act as an emergency check to certain sweepers; however, it compromises Thundurus's coverage. Hidden Power Flying and Psychic are both good options for KOing Mega Venusaur, while Sludge Wave enables Thundurus to hit Unaware Clefable, which otherwise completely walls this set.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Prankster is the preferred ability on this set even if Thundurus does not carry Thunder Wave since, if it is revealed to the opponent though Trace or Skill Swap, they will refrain from setting up due to the risk of priority Thunder Wave. Leftovers enables Thundurus to set up Nasty Plots more easily and gives it more longevity; however, Life Orb can also be used for much higher initial power. A fully offensive spread is chosen in order to maximize Thundurus's offensive prowess, while a Timid nature lets it outspeed base 110 Speed Pokemon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against offensive teams, Thundurus should not attempt to set up; instead, it should focus on attacking. However, against more defensive teams, which rely on Pokemon such as Magic Guard Clefable, Celebi, and Jirachi to check Thundurus, try to set up Nasty Plot against Pokemon that cannot threaten Thundurus, such as Skarmory, Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Nasty Plot should not be used when the opponent has a Pokemon that forces Thundurus out even after a boost, such as Unaware Clefable or Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Instead, it should just attack and attempt to get chip damage on the counter as it switches in. Don't be afraid to sacrifice Thundurus if it means dealing a large amount of damage to something that checks another one of your Pokemon. For instance, if the opponent's only check to Mega Charizard X is Hippowdon, you can afford to hit it with a +2 Hidden Power Ice and have Thundurus be KOed by Stone Edge, thus putting Hippowdon at a range where Mega Charizard X can KO it after a boost.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Thundurus fits mainly on offense teams, which appreciate both Thundurus's ability to check Steel- and Flying-types and its ability to act as a late-game cleaner and weaken defensive Pokemon. A lot of Pokemon that rely on recovery as opposed to damage to deal with Thundurus, such as Magic Guard Clefable, Celebi, and Jirachi, can be disposed of with this set. Thus, Pokemon that are stopped by them can benefit from Thundurus's support. For example, Mega Gardevoir is a great partner for Thundurus because it baits out Jirachi, Gardevoir's best counter. Nasty Plot Thundurus is prone to being revenge killed, so a Pokemon that can handle offensive checks to Thundurus serves as a good partner to it. For example, Hippowdon can handle most Choice Scarf users as well as Mega Lopunny and Mega Manectric. Keldeo can check Weavile and Choice Scarf Tyranitar. It also benefits from Thundurus's ability to lure and KO Magic Guard Clefable and Celebi, as well as weaken Latios and Latias, making it a particularly good partner. Thundurus enjoys support from an entry hazard remover, as Stealth Rock can severely limit its ability to set up Nasty Plot. It can also benefit from dual screens or Memento support, as both enable it to set up much more easily. Given that Thundurus beats most Steel-types anyway and most of its checks are grounded, it enjoys support from Toxic Spikes, especially if running Psychic or Hidden Power Flying to lure and KO Mega Venusaur, the most common grounded Poison-type.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is a powerful, accurate STAB move with no drawbacks and serves as the main offensive move Thundurus will be using. However, Wild Charge can be used over Thunderbolt if Thundurus wants to truly take advantage of Defiant and OHKO Mega Gardevoir. However, the recoil damage combined with Life Orb recoil is detrimental. Knock Off enables Thundurus to hit Psychic-types such as Latios, Latias, Jirachi, and Celebi and remove Chansey's and Porygon2's Eviolite. It also heavily cripples Assault Vest users such as Raikou, Conkeldurr, and Goodra, as well as Pokemon that commonly carry Leftovers such as Clefable and Hippowdon. Superpower gives Thundurus super effective coverage against Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, Excadrill, Chansey, Heatran, and Kyurem-B and targets specially bulky Pokemon such as Raikou and Goodra. Hidden Power Ice enables Thundurus to hit Ground-types such as Gliscor, Garchomp and Landorus-T, while Grass Knot targets Hippowdon, Mega Swampert, Quagsire, and Gastrodon. Sludge Wave can be used to hit Fairy-types such as Clefable and Mega Altaria, which can easily handle this set, and Hidden Power Flying can be used to 2HKO Mega Venusaur, which walls Thundurus otherwise.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Defiant enables Thundurus to get an Attack boost from switching into Defog and having an Intimidate Pokemon such as Landorus-T or Mega Manectric switch into it. Life Orb gives Thundurus a much-needed power boost on both its physical and its special attacks. The given spread gives Thundurus enough Attack to OHKO Latios with Knock Off after Stealth Rock damage, with the rest placed in Special Attack. If Psychic is run, using 196 Special Attack EVs enables Thundurus to 2HKO defensive Mega Venusaur. If Wild Charge is used, a more physically offensive spread is appropriate: using 84 Special Attack EVs is enough to OHKO offensive Garchomp with Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock, while 36 are enough to OHKO physically defensive Landorus-T and physically defensive Gliscor with the move after Stealth Rock. Finally, if both Wild Charge and Grass Knot are used, no Special Attack investment is necessary because Thundurus already 2HKOes Hippowdon and Gastrodon and OHKOes Quagsire without any investment. Maximum Speed with a Speed-increasing nature enables Thundurus to outspeed Latios and Latias and Speed tie with opposing Thundurus, and a Naive nature is chosen over a Hasty nature to take priority moves such as Azumarill's Aqua Jet and Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack better, as well as switch into Knock Off from Tornadus-T and Scizor more easily. However, a Hasty nature enables Thundurus to switch into Keldeo's Scald more comfortably.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Thundurus should use Thunderbolt most of the time and use the appropriate coverage moves against Pokemon that resist Electric and special walls. Thundurus should mainly be used early-game, where it can punch holes in the opposing team by baiting out Pokemon such as Latios and Chansey and remove the items from certain Pokemon to compromise their offensive or defensive capabilities throughout the battle. This set thrives on the element of surprise, so try not to reveal the fact that it's a mixed set too early on. Don't predict too much with this set: a lot of Pokemon that are sent in on Thundurus can't beat this set, and you don't want to mispredict and reveal the fact that it's mixed too early. However, if the opponent's answer to Thundurus is something it cannot beat, such as Clefable or Hippowdon if Thundurus is not running Grass Knot, hitting it with Knock Off as it switches in is the best course of action, unless said Pokemon is a Mega Evolution. If you think the opposing Pokemon will use Defog, you should switch Thundurus into it. Be wary, though, as the most common Defoggers, Latios and Latias, can both OHKO Thundurus with Draco Meteor.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set fits well on offensive teams that benefit from Thundurus's ability to lure certain Pokemon as well as break balance and stall cores without needing to set up, which still leaves it effective against offensive teams. Thundurus should be paired up with Pokemon that can switch into and beat its counters, particularly bulky Fairy-types. Examples include Jirachi, which handles Mega Venusaur and Clefable and counters Mega Gardevoir, and Talonflame, which deals with Mega Altaria in addition to checking the other Pokemon mentioned. Pokemon that benefit from Latios, Latias, and Chansey being removed, such as Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y, also pair well with Thundurus. Keldeo can also effortlessly set up on Tyranitar and Weavile, both of which can easily Pursuit trap Thundurus. Mega Charizard Y, on the other hand, deals with Clefable and Venusaur, two big threats to Thundurus. This set works very well on entry hazard-reliant teams, not only for its ability to take advantage of opposing Defogs but also because most of Thundurus's checks are heavily worn down by Spikes. Conversely, Thundurus is easily worn down by Stealth Rock and therefore benefits from an entry hazard remover. Latios and Latias can Defog while checking Mega Venusaur and also benefit from the removal of Chansey, Excadrill can provide Rapid Spin support while checking Fairies, and Starmie acts as a reliable spinner and really appreciates special walls being crippled by Knock Off.</p> "

  "Thundurus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Thundurus-T is a unique Pokemon in the OU metagame, blessed with access to two exceptional boosting moves in Nasty Plot and Agility. These moves, complemented by Thundurus-T's massive Special Attack stat, allow it to blow through a variety of teams with little effort. Thundurus-T also has decent typing for an offensive sweeper, resisting two forms of priority in Brave Bird and Bullet Punch, as well as having an immunity to Ground-type attacks. Volt Absorb allows it to switch into Electric-type attacks from Pokemon such as Magnezone, Rotom-W, and opposing Thundurus and regain some of its health in the process. Residing in a decent Speed tier, Thundurus-T outspeeds opposing base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Charizard, Manaphy, Mega Gardevoir, and Jirachi without having to resort to using Agility beforehand.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Thundurus-T is highly vulnerable to residual damage, especially Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock, with no reliable recovery outside of Volt Absorb and possibly Leftovers. Thundurus-T also has subpar bulk, struggling to take even powerful resisted hits, such as Choice Specs Keldeo's Secret Sword, meaning every attempt to switch it in is a gamble.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thundurus-T has the option to run a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs set with Volt Switch, although it's generally inferior to both the Agility and Double Dance sets, as Pokemon such as Raikou can arguably do the job better. Expert Belt is an option to hit harder with super effective attacks without having to take Life Orb recoil; however, Thundurus-T loses power on non-super effective attacks. Thundurus-T can effectively use Knock Off to cripple Latias, Latios, and Chansey, as usually, only Thundurus carries this. A Yache Berry can be used for a one-time neutrality to Ice-type attacks, helping it survive a possible Ice Shard or Hidden Power Ice.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, Quagsire, Seismitoad, and Garchomp give Thundurus-T a hard time, especially if it's not carrying Hidden Power Ice or Grass Knot, thanks to their immunity to its main STAB move. They can also wear down Thundurus-T using Toxic or Sandstorm.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey is a hard stop to sets that don't use both Nasty Plot and Focus Blast. It is able to wear Thundurus-T down with Toxic and Seismic Toss while being able to recover any lost health with Soft-Boiled.</p> <p><strong>Latios and Latias</strong>: Latios and Latias can take Thundurus-T's STAB moves and most coverage moves well thanks to their decent natural bulk, outspeed it before an Agility, and OHKO it in return with Draco Meteor. They must remain wary of the rare Knock Off, however.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers such as Mamoswine, Mega Manectric, and Sucker Punch abusers such as Bisharp can come in after a teammate has been sacrificed and force Thundurus-T out.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Residual damage from things such as burn, Toxic, Stealth Rock, Sandstorm, and Life Orb leaves Thundurus-T vulnerable to priority moves or revenge killing and can drastically reduce its time on the field, thanks to its lack of reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Bulky attackers such as Assault Vest Conkeldurr, Assault Vest Goodra, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Mega Venusaur can beat Thundurus-T one-on-one. They can easily stomach any attack it can throw at them and respond by wearing it down or, in some cases, outright KOing it.</p> ",

        "name": "Agility",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Agility boosts Thundurus-T's Speed stat by two stages, allowing it to outspeed the entire metagame, including common Choice Scarf users. Thunderbolt is Thundurus-T's most reliable STAB move, dealing heavy damage to most Pokemon that don't resist it, thanks to its high Special Attack. Focus Blast is used for super effective coverage against bulky Steel-type Pokemon that take little damage from Thunderbolt, such as Ferrothorn and Heatran, as well as Tyranitar. Hidden Power Ice hits bulky Ground-type Pokemon that are immune to Thundurus-T's main STAB move, such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon. Hidden Power Flying is another option that not only is a reliable secondary STAB move but also can also hit bulky Grass-type Pokemon such as Celebi, Mega Venusaur, and Chesnaught harder than Hidden Power Ice. Grass Knot can be used to hit Seismitoad, Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Hippowdon harder than Hidden Power Ice, but it misses out on hitting Garchomp and Gliscor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment into Special Attack allows Thundurus-T to hit as hard as possible, and complemented by a Modest nature, this gives Thundurus-T the ability to break down even the sturdiest of walls. However, a Timid nature with maximum Speed investment allows Thundurus-T to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Charizard, Manaphy, and Jirachi before an Agility boost, although this option is generally inferior to a Modest nature because, thanks to Agility's Speed boost, these situations will rarely come into play in the first place and a Modest nature allows Thundurus-T to wallbreak more easily. Leftovers gives Thundurus-T passive recovery and can mitigate residual damage to a certain degree. Conversely, while Life Orb gives Thundurus-T slight recoil for each damaging attack, the extra power allows it to KO Kyurem-B with Focus Blast and specially defensive Gliscor with Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Thundurus-T works as an excellent late-game cleaner thanks to its good coverage and power, being able to easily get to +2 on Pokemon such as Magnezone, specially defensive Talonflame, and Skarmory. This being stated, Thundurus-T appreciates its checks and counters, such as Seismitoad, Gastrodon, and Mega Venusaur, weakened before attempting to sweep, as Thundurus-T will rarely get a second opportunity to sweep due to its frailty. Use Volt Absorb to its advantage, allowing Thundurus-T to switch into attacks such as Choice Specs Raikou's Thunderbolt and regain a small amount of health. If the opponent has a Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon or Garchomp, be aware that they can freely switch into Thundurus-T's main STAB move.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>A Defogger or a spinner is a necessity to keep Thundurus-T healthy, as Stealth Rock deals a nasty 25% each time Thundurus-T switches in, drastically cutting its longevity. Excadrill not only clears Stealth Rock but also can pressure Assault Vest Raikou and loves having Thundurus-T's coverage to beat bulky Water-types, as well as Landorus-T and Garchomp if running Hidden Power Ice. Latios and Latias can clear away entry hazards, while Latias offers Thundurus-T a second chance at sweeping with Healing Wish. Powerful Fighting-type Pokemon such as Keldeo and Conkeldurr can handle Chansey, which threatens Thundurus-T without Focus Blast, easily forcing it out. Partners that can pressure bulky Ground-type Pokemon, such as Serperior and Keldeo, can help Thundurus-T break through the opponent's team. To take advantage of opposing Latios and Latias, Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Bisharp can Pursuit trap them, severely damaging them or outright KOing them. Talonflame is able to handle Mega Venusaur thanks to its high-powered Flying-type STAB moves, while Thundurus-T can absorb Electric-type attacks aimed at Talonflame. Klefki can easily switch into Weavile while also providing Spikes support, giving Thundurus-T an easier time when attempting to sweep.</p> "

        "name": "Double Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Agility gives Thundurus-T the ability to outspeed entire offensive teams, dealing fair damage without needing the +2 Special Attack. Conversely, Nasty Plot allows it to easily plow through the majority of defensive teams, because it has the Speed stat to outspeed most defensive Pokemon. Thunderbolt is Thundurus-T's most reliable STAB move, dealing heavy damage to targets that don't resist it. Hidden Power Ice allows Thundurus-T to hit bulky Ground- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. Focus Blast is an option over Hidden Power Ice, but it is generally an inferior choice due to its lower accuracy, fewer PP, and worse coverage, because Thundurus-T can no longer hit Pokemon such as Gliscor for respectable damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment gives Thundurus-T as much power as possible behind its special attacks, and with a Modest nature, Thundurus-T gains even more wallbreaking power, even 2HKOing Chansey at +2 with Focus Blast after Stealth Rock damage. However, running a Timid nature allows Thundurus-T to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon before using Agility; nevertheless, Modest is generally the preferred nature, due to Agility raising Thundurus-T's Speed anyway. Leftovers is used for passive recovery, as well as slightly mitigating Stealth Rock damage, but a Lum Berry can be used to cure Toxic and burn, helping cure residual damage from status.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Keep in mind that Thundurus-T generally will not need both a Special Attack and Speed boost to be efficient. Nasty Plot is the more useful boost against bulkier teams, while, thanks to Thundurus-T's fantastic Special Attack stat, Agility is more useful for breaking apart weakened offensive teams. Thundurus-T can use its ability to switch in to Pokemon Choice-locked into an Electric-type move, such as Magnezone and Raikou, giving it more opportunities to set up freely while also having the chance to recover a small amount of HP, slightly negating residual damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Thundurus-T needs entry hazard removal to keep it healthy, as Stealth Rock deals 25% damage upon each switch in, cutting its health quickly. Excadrill can clear Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin, as well as pressuring Raikou, while Starmie can also clear Stealth Rock and beats Heatran. Fighting-type Pokemon such as Gallade, Keldeo, and Terrakion can deal with Chansey, Ferrothorn, and Heatran if Thundurus-T is not running Focus Blast. Mega Sceptile, Serperior, and Gyarados can help deal with bulky Ground-type Pokemon that would otherwise give this set trouble without Hidden Power Ice. Pursuit trappers such as Bisharp and Tyranitar can easily remove Latias and Latios, making it easier for Thundurus-T to sweep. Klefki offers Spikes support, damaging Thundurus-T's checks when they switch in, giving it an easier time when attempting a sweep.</p> "

  "Landorus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Landorus-T proves itself to be one of the OU metagame's premier bulky Ground-types due to its great typing, access to U-turn, and Intimidate support. It functions as a pivot, thus providing momentum and controlling the tempo of the match, while also functioning as an all-around blanket check to many physical threats in the tier such as Mega Lopunny, Excadrill, Mega Charizard X, and Tyranitar. It can set up Stealth Rock pretty comfortably, as its high Attack stat prevents many threats from coming in freely regardless of how defensive the set you run may be. Its wide movepool consisting of great options such as Swords Dance, Explosion, Knock Off, and Rock Polish also makes it a threat in many different ways; for example, it's a great Choice Scarf user filling the role of revenge killer and can also work as setup sweeper. However, Landorus-T faces competition from Hippowdon and Garchomp as a Ground-type, with the former being able to utilize Sand Stream along with its superior bulk and defensive typing and the latter being able to spread passive chip damage through Rough Skin + Rocky Helmet. Its lack of reliable recovery outside of Leftovers also leaves it relatively low on HP to manage various threats on the opponent's team, especially if you don't play cautiously. Lastly, Landorus-T packs weaknesses to Ice- and Water-type moves, meaning it cannot set up Stealth Rock without inviting the likes of Kyurem-B, Manaphy, and Keldeo in.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A lead Focus Sash set can be considered for surprising Ice-types and other annoying leads that want to prevent Landorus-T from getting up Stealth Rock; normally when this item is used Landorus-T carries Explosion to prevent Defog after getting up Stealth Rock. Normal Gem + Explosion has a niche on teams with offensive Flying-type cores, as it can weaken Rotom-W and bulky Ground-types. Gravity is a nice equivalent to Smack Down because they basically do the same thing, limiting Skarmory and Rotom-W switch-ins. Gravity can be chosen over Smack Down because it is active, for five turns which another teammate can also advantage of; however, it also could benefit your opponent, as it makes every move 100% accurate. Substitute paired with Bulk Up or Swords Dance could make Landorus-T a good setup sweeper that can avoid status while breaking teams; such a set could also carry Salac Berry to clean late-game.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Landorus-T cannot threaten most Water-types, while they can force it out with their STAB moves. Some examples include Keldeo, Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Manaphy.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types: Weavile, Mamoswine, and Kyurem-B can eliminate Landorus-T with their powerful Ice-type STAB move of choice, and the former two can pick off faster sets with their priority Ice Shard. It is important to note many cannot switch in without being eliminated by U-turn or taking 25% from Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types: Opposing Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Gliscor can come in on Landorus-T and set up Stealth Rock freely. However, they can easily be taken care of with Swords Dance-boosted attacks or crippled by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Most Grass-types such as Tangrowth, Chesnaught, and Mega Venusaur can force out non-Swords Dance Landorus-T due to their typing and strong Grass-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types: Skarmory can remove Landorus-T's entry hazards, wall it, and even beat Swords Dance sets by phazing them with Whirlwind or KOing them with Counter. Ferrothorn can wear Landorus-T down faster than it can do the same to Ferrothorn. Bulky Mega Scizor can also set up on Landorus-T without Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers: Pokemon with Ice-type coverage in general can be a pain for non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Raikou, Gengar, Tornadus-T, and Mega Manectric are great examples, but they will have to be wary of the uncommon Yache Berry. Mega Latias not only can outpace Landorus-T and KO it with Ice Beam but also has the necessary bulk to tank Knock Off from Choice Scarf Landorus-T.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Wallbreakers: While Landorus-T has great physical bulk, its middling Special Defense makes it vulnerable against Mega Charizard Y, Latios, Serperior, and Hydreigon despite it having a neutrality to their STAB moves.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Landorus-T's main way to deal with Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Excadrill. Stealth Rock is used for gradually wearing down your opponent's Pokemon and punishing switch-ins, with Landorus-T being an excellent user due to its good typing and ability to switch into many physical attackers to sponge hits. U-turn makes Landorus-T a great pivot to gain offensive momentum and scout the foe's moves as well as baiting in some defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory that strong wallbreakers on your team can take advantage of without taking the risk of getting damaged beforehand. Stone Edge is the best possible coverage move for Landorus-T, allowing it to hit Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate while being able to OHKO some threats such as Mega Pinsir, which is one of the reasons why Stone Edge is a superior move to Rock Slide despite the lower accuracy. Swords Dance can be run over U-turn because it can help Landorus-T pressure bulkier Pokemon such as Clefable, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and opposing Landorus-T rather than having to U-turn into a better matchup. Toxic can be used to cripple setup sweepers and bulkier Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Hippowdon, Garchomp, and Talonflame. Knock Off is also a good option for the last slot, as it provides a nice utility for teammates or for Landorus-T itself by helping them wear down bulky Pokemon more easily. For example, you can remove Skarmory's or Ferrothorn's Shed Shell and trap them with Magnezone later, and you can remove Leftovers, Eviolite, and Smooth Rock. It also hits Psychic-types for super effective damage. However, this leaves Landorus-T vulnerable to Mega Pinsir and Talonflame. Hidden Power Ice is a completely viable option to nail opposing Landorus-T and Garchomp, but if you opt for this it's preferable to run a Lax nature for higher rolls on the aforementioned foes, especially considering the Special Defense investment isn't that useful in most situations.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment and near-maximum Defense investment with a Impish nature is used to buff Landorus-T's defensive potential as much as possible to take on physical threats optimally. The 8 EVs in Special Defense allow Landorus-T to always survive Mega Manectric's Hidden Power Ice at full HP. The rest is dumped into Speed to outpace base 50 Speed Pokemon with a positive nature such as Azumarill. Intimidate strengthens Landorus-T's ability to come into threatening physical attackers. As for items, Rocky Helmet works well due to its ability to spread chip damage on threats such as Mega Lopunny and opposing Landorus-T, making it easier for its teammates or itself to pick them off later. Leftovers is the superior option on more defensive teams due to the great longevity it provides.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>One of the main reasons to use this set is setting up Stealth Rock, so try to set it up on Pokemon that are threatened by Earthquake or fear Rocky Helmet damage such as Excadrill, Mega Charizard X, Mega Lopunny, and Klefki, or just get it up as soon as possible in the match to instantly apply pressure on your opponent, potentially forcing a spin or Defog that you can take advantage of. Another reason why Landorus-T is slapped onto so many teams is its ability to come into many threatening attackers and force them out, allowing you to gain momentum, get up Stealth Rock, or get off a hefty chunk of damage on something to put you in a favorable situation. Try to KO Pokemon that threaten your team or at least will rack up damage, such as +1 Excadrill under sand, Swords Dance Talonflame, and Dragon Dance-boosted Mega Charizard X. U-turn is a great way to grab offensive momentum or scout the foe's moves, as Landorus-T can pivot into Pokemon that it would force out such as Jirachi and Excadrill and proceed to U-turn out on the opponent's expected switch out to rack up damage alongside Stealth Rock to keep the tempo of the match in your favor. Another way to use it is getting a slow U-turn after taking a hit and bringing in a teammate that matches up favorably. If you pack Swords Dance, use it early-game to break bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon and defensive Garchomp. Knock Off should be used to remove annoying items such as Leftovers, Eviolite, Shed Shell, Rocky Helmet, and Life Orb to make it easier to deal with those Pokemon later.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Latios and Starmie both can switch into Water-type attacks and check Keldeo perfectly; Starmie can also switch into Ice-type attacks. Ferrothorn is a great partner to complete the entry hazard-stacking core and resists Water-type attacks as well; it also switches into some special wallbreakers that Landorus-T can't manage, such as non-Hidden Power Fire Latios, Mega Diancie, and Kyurem-B, somewhat comfortably. Another great hazard core partner is Klefki for the more offensive approach, as between the two, they possess great defensive synergy and are capable of checking a large portion of the metagame, with Klefki also providing a ton of utility with moves like Spikes, Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Thunder Wave. Wallbreakers or hard-hitting Pokemon enjoy the slow U-turn Landorus-T can provide, such as Volcanion, Kyurem-B, Mega Medicham, and Thundurus, because they don't enjoy taking hits and all take advantage of what foes Landorus-T baits in, such as bulky Ground- and Water-types. Tyranitar is also good when paired with Landorus-T because Landorus-T tends to lure in Starmie, Latios, and Latias, which Tyranitar can trap, guaranteeing hazards on the other side of the field stay. Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Rotom-W can complete a VoltTurn core and keep momentum throughout the match; Mega Manectric also enjoys that Landorus-T can Toxic bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon or weaken them with Swords Dance-boosted attacks, while Rotom-W helps on a more defensive front, spreading status and alleviating pressure from Landorus-T in checking many threats. Landorus-T also makes a great core in terms of synergy and hazards with Dragalge, as it can take Water-type attacks while Landorus-T is immune to Ground-type attacks that hurt Dragalge. Clefable is a solid option too, as it can take unboosted Water- and Ice-type attacks from Pokemon such as Mega Manectric, Weavile, defensive Starmie, and Lopunny, while Landorus-T can deal with Pokemon that threaten Clefable such as Excadrill, Talonflame, and Mega Charizard X and also resists Poison-type attacks. Keldeo is also a nice alternative to pair with Landorus-T because Bisharp can get out of hand due to a +1 boost from Intimidate and it enjoys the slow U-turn to wallbreak safely. Bulky Water-types like Slowbro and Slowking take Water- and Ice-type attacks directed at Landorus-T reliably, with the latter taking on special wallbreakers slightly better and the former taking pressure off Landorus-T in beating the majority of the physical metagame.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>STAB Earthquake is easy to spam mid- and late-game without having anything immune to it; it also is able to revenge kill threats such as Choice Scarf Excadrill and Mega Alakazam. On a Choice Scarf set, U-turn is one of the best moves to have, functioning to gain offensive momentum and revenge kill weakened Pokemon to have switch initiative. Stone Edge is the perfect coverage move to go with Earthquake, hitting Flying-types, and it's a superior option over Rock Slide because this set needs the power to KO the likes of Dragonite, whose Outrage + Extreme Speed it cannot tank, and gain a high chance of OHKOing Tornadus-T. Knock Off cripples defensive Pokemon like Skarmory and Ferrothorn to wear them down more easily while also OHKOing Latias and Latios, which U-turn can't do; it also hits Gengar in a more reliable way and super effectively. Explosion should be considered as a last-ditch effort if you can't KO a foe with Earthquake and it is dangerous enough to sweep your team, as well dealing massive damage to bulkier Pokemon and even OHKOing them after a prior damage in the case of Clefable; it also works to gain momentum by providing switch initiative if the situation allows you to do so. Superpower nails Air Balloon Excadrill, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gyarados. Hidden Power Ice is a viable option as well to lure and eliminate opposing Landorus-T or other Pokemon 4x weak to it such as Garchomp.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Full investment into Attack provides enough power to revenge kill threats such as Excadrill, Mega Charizard X, and Keldeo, the latter with a bit of prior damage. A Jolly nature with maximum investment into Speed is needed in order to grab momentum and revenge kill every single Mega Evolution such as Mega Lopunny or Mega Alakazam or Pokemon with a +1 Speed boost such as Mega Gyarados and Dragonite. Choice Scarf is the reason why this set is a great momentum grabber and revenge killer.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The main use of this set is to revenge kill threats after one of your Pokemon has been sacrificed. Try to maintain momentum as much as you can, for example by using U-turn on weakened Pokemon; you can bring in Landorus-T to force a Pokemon out, not only granting you offensive momentum or switch initiative but also racking up damage on the opponent's team and getting a fast U-turn off. Use it to check Mega Charizard X, Excadrill, and Mega Lopunny, but be wary of switching it directly in because its bulk is still average even with Intimidate; you can also use it to clean up late-game once Pokemon that resist or are immune to Ground have been removed or are weakened enough. It's also a good lead to scout your opponent's intentions as well as match up perfectly the majority of the time, and for poor matchups Landorus-T can just U-turn out. Be careful of locking Landorus-T into a move that leaves it vulnerable to a setup sweeper.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Wallbreakers fit perfectly as teammates, as they can beat what Choice Scarf Landorus-T baits in, granting you the upper hand in a match. The momentum grabbed by Landorus-T gives free switches in to Pokemon like Kyurem-B, Thundurus, Volcanion, Mega Heracross, Mega Gardevoir, Latios, and Magnezone that can trap Skarmory or Ferrothorn trying to switch into Landorus-T. An entry hazard setter is needed to inflict chip damage combined with U-turn; a good option is Ferrothorn, as it has nice synergy with Landorus-T defensively. Ferrothorn is able to take Water- and Ice-type attacks that threaten Landorus-T, which can take Fighting-type attacks in return. Pokemon that can weaken checks for Landorus-T are well received, such as Heatran, which can beat bulkier Pokemon such as Clefable and Skarmory and has access to Stealth Rock. Mega Manectric and Rotom-W complete a VoltTurn core to pressure bulkier builds and keep up offensive momentum. Spikes are really good with Landorus-T because many of its checks are grounded; Klefki in particular works great because it has use on offensive teams, and lead Skarmory is an option if you're taking the hyper offense path. Despite being an offensive set, this still can check some threats such as Excadrill and switch into Poison-type attacks, which Clefable appreciates; in return, Clefable can switch into multiple attacks that threaten Landorus-T, such as Kyurem-B's Ice Beam and Keldeo's Scald. Magnezone is really good to complete a VoltTurn core as well while also trapping pesky Steel-types such as Skarmory that completely counter Landorus-T, and Landorus-T in return is immune to Ground-type attacks that destroy Magnezone.</p> "

        "name": "Double Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake should be spammed most of the time after setting up, or even before. Stone Edge hits targets that Earthquake cannot such as opposing Landorus-T, Talonflame, Rotom-W, and Skarmory, making it the best coverage move for Landorus-T. Swords Dance is capable of boosting Landorus-T's Attack in order to sweep teams under the right circumstances. Rock Polish works best against a more offensive team, where Speed is more needed than power.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack with an Adamant nature is used to hit as hard as possible both with and without a Swords Dance boost, dismantling defensive builds. Full investment into Speed is used in order to outpace key threats like Adamant Excadrill and fast Taunt users such as Heatran and Gliscor. Earth Plate lets Landorus-T net certain OHKOs, most notably on defensive Garchomp and Slowbro after Stealth Rock and a Swords Dance boost more than 50% of the time. An alternative EV spread of 8 HP / 176 Atk / 92 Def / 232 Spe allows Landorus-T to comfortably set up on Life Orb Excadrill and other physical attackers, which are what Landorus-T will most likely try to find a setup opportunity on, while still maintaining a Speed benchmark for Excadrill in sand after a Rock Polish; however, you can still go with maximum Speed to outpace Heatran before setting up. 176 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature alongside Earth Plate are more than enough to devastate bulkier teams. Lum Berry lets Landorus-T avoid Toxic and burn that can stop its sweep, which is useful against status-reliant stall teams, for example. Yache Berry is an option to check Electric-types and avoid the OHKO from Weavile's Ice-type attacks. Leftovers with a bulkier spread can be used to fit into bulky offense builds, but the lack of immediate power is significant.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use this set to break bulkier Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Clefable, and Slowbro for a teammate like Mega Lopunny to take advantage of mid- or late-game. You can also use this set to clean late-game, setting up a Swords Dance against slower builds, which tend to be bulkier, or a Rock Polish against offensive or fast builds, which, conversely, require Speed over power because they typically are more frail. Try to set up in front of physical attackers or Pokemon that can't do much back such as Hippowdon and Choice Scarf Keldeo locked into Secret Sword, and aim to eliminate all users of priority before attempting to sweep, such as Weavile, Scizor, Azumarill, and Talonflame. You should use wallbreakers early- or mid-game to weaken Landorus-T's checks or find an opportunity to eliminate threats like Rotom-W before attempting a sweep. Don't play your Landorus-T like a physical wall early-game, as its HP should be preserved as much as possible if you are using it as your main wincon or sweeper. If you choose Lum Berry, you can play more recklessly in term of setup, but without the Earth Plate boost Landorus-T won't 2HKO Quagsire on the switch even with Stealth Rock. Earth Plate can give Landorus-T a better matchup against stall, but it is recommended you set up on non-status move users or try to bluff another set, such as bluffing Knock Off on Chansey or bluffing Stealth Rock to bait Skarmory in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Other strong attackers appreciate Landorus-T's ability to weaken the opponent's team, such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Scizor, Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, Alakazam, and Keldeo. On the other hand, Landorus-T appreciates teammates that can break its checks for a mid- or late-game sweep such as Mega Heracross, Mega Medicham, Volcanion, Magma Storm + Power Herb + Solar Beam Heatran, and Mega Charizard X. Clefable is great teammate, as it can absorb status in case you're not packing Lum Berry and appreciates that Landorus-T can break Steel-types and special walls so it can freely set up some Calm Minds to clean up. Magnezone traps Skarmory, which can phaze Landorus-T with Whirlwind or stall it out of Stone Edge PP. A defensive Pokemon like Slowbro that is capable of checking what a more offensive variant of Landorus-T cannot break through throughout the course of a match such as Excadrill is appreciated.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With an Adamant nature and Earth Plate boost, Earthquake hits like a truck and can be spammed in any stage of the match. Stone Edge provides the best coverage with Earthquake by hitting Rotom-W, Skarmory, and Talonflame. Swords Dance boosts Landorus-T's Attack and enables it to hit ridiculously hard, granting it even greater wallbreaking potential to hurt bulkier teams. Also, with a Swords Dance boost Landorus-T can force switches to get up Stealth Rock, which is the main point of this set. Smack Down is an option to lure and eliminate some common switch-ins in Skarmory and Rotom-W, allowing you to freely click Earthquake the turn after or, if they have another Flying-type or Levitate user, get up Stealth Rock. U-turn is an option over Swords Dance if you prefer an offensive pivot; if you choose this move, Earth Plate is pretty much necessary to make up for the loss of power. Smack Down is also a much more valid option on U-turn sets to grab offensive momentum. Knock Off can remove items such as Eviolites and Leftovers, to cripple and wear down opposing builds quickly, and Shed Shell, in case you have Magnezone in the back. Explosion is an option to weaken some bulky Pokemon and pick them off with another teammate or to block Defog.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Earth Plate provides much more damage output in general, allowing you to crush Quagsire on the switch, for example, if an Adamant nature is chosen. Yache Berry is a nice option to lure and eliminate Electric-types, most of which pack Hidden Power Ice, and Ice-types. Leftovers lets Landorus-T check Excadrill and Mega Charizard X more than once. Passho Berry allows Landorus-T to set up on Water-types that don't have an Ice-type attack and beat Starmie one-on-one. A Jolly nature is an option to outpace Pokemon like Jolly Excadrill or neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon. Maximum Attack is mandatory to break bulkier teams, as is maximum Speed so Landorus-T isn't dead weight against faster teams packing Hidden Power Ice Heatran, for example. An alternative spread of 192 HP / 136 Atk / 180 Spe with an Adamant nature aims to switch into Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Excadrill, and Talonflame, hits an extra point in Attack and still hits hard, and allows Landorus-T to outspeed Jolly Breloom and Bisharp as well as Timid Volcanion.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The point of this set is to become more threatening offensively by hitting much harder with a lot of Attack investment, essentially providing Landorus-T with wallbreaking potential to pressure bulkier teams and thereby open a window to set up Stealth Rock. Set up Swords Dance on Pokemon that cannot OHKO Landorus-T, on foes that can't touch it such as non-Roar Hippowdon. If you force them out, go for Stealth Rock. The whole idea of multiple items like Lum Berry, Yache Berry, Earth Plate, or Passho Berry is to lure some threats so your teammates have an easier time late-game. This set struggles to consistently check strong physical attackers such as Excadrill, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Charizard X, so use it conservatively. Whether you need Stealth Rock up or to break a team with a Swords Dance boost is your choice; aim for whichever benefits your game plan in the long term.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Lopunny, Mega Charizard X, or any strong physical attacker likes Landorus-T wearing down bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon, opposing Landorus-T, and defensive Garchomp. A offensive Grass-type such as Breloom can beat bulky Water-types that Landorus-T struggles with, but this leaves your team vulnerable to Ice-type attacks. Klefki is a great offensive partner that perfectly pairs with Landorus-T in an offensive entry hazard-setting core, as the two possess great defensive synergy and are capable of checking a large portion of the metagame, with Klefki also providing a ton of utility with moves like Spikes, Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Thunder Wave. Landorus-T can lure some Pokemon depending on the type of Berry you choose or if you pack Smack Down; for example, Swords Dance Mega Scizor has an easier time once Electric-types have been removed with the help of Yache Berry. Smack Down is also good to remove Skarmory and Rotom-W for Mega Scizor. Latios takes on Keldeo, reliably switches into Water-types, and can hit them harder with Draco Meteor; once again, watch out for Ice-type attacks. Keldeo is a good teammate, as it takes on common threats to Landorus-T such as Bisharp and Weavile. Tyranitar can Pursuit trap Latios, Latias, and Starmie to ensure Stealth Rock stays on the field, as well having great synergy with Landorus-T. Mega Manectric and Raikou like Ground-types being weakened.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Kyurem, while uncommon in the OU tier, is a strong special wallbreaker able to threaten a number of Pokemon with its great STAB moves that are difficult to switch into, such as Clefable, which gets 2HKOed by Ice Beam. Despite facing competition from Kyurem-B as a wallbreaker, as its ability is not as useful as Kyurem-B's Teravolt as well as being unable to run Roost due to needing Choice Specs, it has a higher Special Attack stat than its counterpart, allowing it to run a Choice Specs set more viably. Good bulk along with valuable resistances to Water, Electric, and Grass moves allows it to check threats such as Rotom-W, Manaphy, Serperior, and Mega Manectric. However, weaknesses to common types such as Fighting and Rock with a vulnerability to all types of entry hazard, mainly Stealth Rock, can limit its ability to switch in, and its Speed, although not bad, leaves Kyurem outsped by a number of threats sitting at the base 100 Speed benchmark.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute + Roost can be a neat set on slower builds to utilize Pressure, Kyurem's good bulk, and its ability to create 101 HP Substitutes in order to PP stall foes, although Kyurem is better suited for being a special wallbreaker due to its hard-hitting STAB moves. Other offensive sets are done better by Kyurem-B due to Fusion Bolt and its ability to go mixed along with having Teravolt, which means it doesn't have to rely as much on prediction as Kyurem does.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Although they cannot directly switch into its coverage options, Steel-types, mainly Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, and Jirachi can easily threaten Kyurem due to their strong STAB moves while also resisting its STAB combination. Excadrill is also an honorable mention; while it can't switch into Kyurem, threatens it with its strong Iron Heads.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Threats such as Chansey can come in on Kyurem repeatedly due to taking little from its moves, being able to heal off any damage with Soft-Boiled, and being able to threaten Kyurem with a Toxic, which limits its time on the field, or a Thunder Wave, which can cripple it by making it slower than all of the threats that it is supposed to handle.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Slowking deserves a mention due to being able to take Kyurem's attacks and recover off the damage while also being able to set up with Calm Minds; while it cannot switch directly into two Draco Meteors, it can safely switch into all of Kyurem's other moves and set up on it with ease. Suicune is able to handle Kyurem if running Rest in a one-on-one situation as well.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Despite not being able to switch in easily, faster attackers like Terrakion, Keldeo, and Mega Lopunny are all able to take out Kyurem with their strong Fighting-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Threats such as Azumarill, Mega Diancie, and Clefable can all take advantage of a Kyurem locked into Draco Meteor and use their super effective STAB moves to take out Kyurem. Azumarill specifically can switch into all of Kyurem's moves except for Earth Power, although being locked into Earth Power can be easily taken advantage in other ways. However, Clefable cannot switch in directly into a Choice Specs-boosted Ice Beam and must take great care when playing around Kyurem.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Choice Scarf Tyranitar can switch into Kyurem's attacks barring Focus Blast and threaten it with Stone Edge. Faster Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Latios, and Mega Charizard X, in particular, threaten Kyurem with super effective STAB moves as well.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Beam is a strong STAB move that doesn't come with any drawbacks, making it a safe option in general and allowing Kyurem to 2HKO relevant targets such as Clefable. Draco Meteor is Kyurem's hardest hitting STAB move, dealing great damage to Pokemon that resist Ice, mainly Water-types such as Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Keldeo. Earth Power provides great coverage in smacking Steel-types that resist Kyurem's STAB combination, such as Heatran, Jirachi, and Mega Metagross; it is also Kyurem's best move to hit Azumarill with. Hidden Power Fire completes its coverage by being able to hit Mega Scizor, which can generally take the rest of Kyurem's moves and threaten it with a strong STAB Bullet Punch. Focus Blast is another good coverage move, being able to OHKO Tyranitar while still netting good coverage against Ferrothorn and having a good chance to 2HKO standard Mega Scizor if running a Timid nature.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs bolster the power of Kyurem's special moves. Choice Specs lets Kyurem act as a strong special wallbreaker with the drawback of locking it into one move. Maximum Speed with a Timid nature allows Kyurem to outspeed threats such as Jolly Excadrill out of sand and Adamant Mega Medicham. A Modest nature is usually not necessary, as maximum Special Attack investment with a Timid nature is enough to 2HKO both standard Calm Clefable and have a strong chance to 2HKO Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock with Ice Beam. Being able to outspeed Excadrill and Mega Medicham while still achieving a 2HKO on both Clefable and Ferrothorn is what gives Kyurem an edge over Choice Specs Kyurem-B, which fails to achieve the 2HKO most of the time with Timid itself.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Removing entry hazards is helpful so that Kyurem can utilize its bulk to switch in more often without having to worry about residual damage. Pairing Kyurem with partners that can bring it in through the use of Volt Switch or U-turn helps it come in safely without having to fear strong attacks it might not be able to switch into directly. Generally, Kyurem should be used as an early-game wallbreaker to punch holes into opposing teams. It can switch into weak Water, Grass, and Electric attacks thanks to its good bulk and retaliate, and it can also be brought in on double switches as well as passive Pokemon such as Skarmory. Ice Beam is the most spammable move to use, dealing a large chunk to a wide variety of threats, and it can help your team handle threats such as Clefable, as it will not be as willing to switch into Kyurem predicting Draco Meteor due to the fear of being 2HKOed by Ice Beam. Draco Meteor is also very useful to take out threats that can take more than one Ice Beam, such as Slowbro and Rotom-W, and can even deal heavy damage to Pokemon that resist it, mainly Steel-types such as Jirachi, thus limiting their ability to switch into Kyurem again, as Draco Meteor is mainly meant to be used as a hit-and-run move; however, be wary of using it with a Fairy-type on the opposing team, as it can gain momentum if Kyurem locks itself into it. If a Steel-type is on the opposing team, you can either stick to using Kyurem's STAB moves to wear it down, or predict the switch in with its coverage moves, although getting locked into the wrong coverage move can give the opponent free momentum, so be careful.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Band Tyranitar pairs well with Kyurem, as it helps deal heavy damage to Chansey while being able to trap faster threats such as Latios for Kyurem. Starmie is a great option that can handle threats such as Mega Diancie for Kyurem while also dealing with Keldeo, as well as providing Rapid Spin support. Latios appreciates Kyurem's ability to take out Clefable and provides Kyurem with entry hazard removal and the ability to handle problematic threats such as Keldeo; however, given that Kyurem prefers having entry hazard support, particularly Spikes, Rapid Spin is usually a better hazard control option. Heatran is able to pressure Steel-types, set up Stealth Rock, and provide Toxic support against the likes of Slowking. Landorus-T provides Stealth Rock support and a slow U-turn while being able to handle Excadrill, which can prove to be a major threat to Kyurem under sand, and Landorus-T in return appreciates Kyurem's ability to handle Electric-, Water-, and Grass-types for it. Garchomp fulfills a similar role minus the U-turn support while being able to take on many problematic threats to Kyurem that sit at the base 100 Speed tier such as Mega Gardevoir and Charizard. Rotom-W also checks Excadrill, Mega Scizor, and other threats such as Jirachi thanks to Will-O-Wisp and provides slow pivoting support for Kyurem, while in return it appreciates having Grass-types taken out.</p> <p>Steel-type partners such as Jirachi, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, as well as Mega Metagross and Mega Scizor serve as great partners due to their ability to handle Fairies for Kyurem. Jirachi can provide Stealth Rock support, pivot with U-turn, and pass Wishes or Healing Wishes in case Kyurem gets worn down too much, with Healing Wish, in particular, being very helpful for Kyurem. Ferrothorn and Skarmory are able to set up Spikes, allowing it to more easily wallbreak against worn down foes, and Skarmory can also take on Excadrill under sand. Mega Scizor helps take out Mega Diancie and can also provide a slow U-turn, as well as being able to switch into Latios and Latias while also being able to provide Pursuit support. Metagross also provides Pursuit support with either a Mega or an Assault Vest set. Excadrill greatly appreciates Kyurem being able to threaten strong checks to it such as Landorus-T and Tangrowth, and Kyurem benefits from potential Rapid Spin support that Excadrill may provide. Stealth Rock Clefable is a notable partner, since it can get the hazard up against stall teams for Kyurem and can also provide Thunder Wave support for it.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Upon looking at Kyurem-B's monstrous Attack stat and its solid stats overall, you can tell right away that it's an offensive powerhouse in the OU tier. Boasting the game's most powerful Outrage, a solid Special Attack stat, and a great STAB type in Ice, it has almost no switch-ins and can break down even the bulkiest of walls. Despite being Ice-type, Kyurem-B is no slouch defensively; well-rounded bulk and resistances to the common Electric- and Water-type attacks give it plenty of opportunities to enter the battlefield. Whether Kyurem-B is breaking down walls, revenge killing, or even stallbreaking with Substitute, its versatility means that can fit onto nearly any offensive team and perform well. On the downside, Kyurem-B most of the time is forced to run a mixed set due to its lack of any usable physical Ice-type STAB moves. While Kyurem-B's defensive typing grants it some decent resistances, it also gives Kyurem-B nasty weaknesses to Fighting-, Fairy-, and Rock-type attacks, all of which are highly prevalent in OU. Lastly, base 95 Speed is not very good, as it leaves Kyurem-B outsped by a wide variety of threats, such as Mega Gardevoir, Hydreigon, and Keldeo.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Freeze Shock alongside Power Herb is a very powerful Ice-type STAB move that takes advantage of Kyurem-B's monstrous Attack stat, but the move can only be used once. Assault Vest can be used to turn Kyurem-B into a strong special tank, but Kyurem-B will miss the ability to use Roost and Substitute.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Scizor can tank all of Kyurem-B's attacks and retaliate hard with Bullet Punch, while Ferrothorn can directly threaten Kyurem-B with Gyro Ball, cut its Speed with Thunder Wave, or stall it out with Leech Seed. However, neither Scizor nor Ferrothorn enjoys being hit with the occasional Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Talonflame can revenge kill a weakened Kyurem-B with Brave Bird, Landorus-T destroys non-Choice Scarf variants with Stone Edge, and Choice Scarf Keldeo often OHKOes Kyurem-B with Secret Sword after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Clefable: Standard Magic Guard Clefable can switch in on all of Kyurem-B's attacks bar Iron Head and Choice Specs-boosted Ice Beam. Clefable can then proceed to set up with Calm Mind, cripple it with Thunder Wave, or hit Kyurem-B hard with Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Should Kyurem-B lack Roost, it becomes very vulnerable to the passive damage brought on by entry hazards. It is also weak to Stealth Rock, so entry hazard removal is almost required to keep it alive.</p> <p><strong>Conkeldurr</strong>: Conkeldurr can take any of Kyurem-B's attacks bar Outrage and then 2HKO Kyurem-B with the combination of STAB Drain Punch and Mach Punch.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Beam is a strong, reliable STAB attack that hits the Dragon-, Ground-, and Flying-types of OU hard. Earth Power provides coverage against the Steel- and Fire-types that resist Ice Beam, such as Heatran, Bisharp, Jirachi, and Victini. Fusion Bolt puts a dent in Water-types such as Azumarill, Mega Slowbro, and Manaphy and deals heavy damage to Flying-types that are not weak to Ice, such as Talonflame and Skarmory. Roost heals off Life Orb recoil; Kyurem-B is bulky enough to get several chances to use Roost in most games. Alternatively, Outrage is Kyurem-B's most powerful STAB attack and puts a dent in even the bulkiest of physical walls.</p> <p>Dragon Claw can also be used in the fourth slot as a STAB attack that does not lock Kyurem-B into a move, though Dragon Claw is noticeably less powerful than Outrage. Hidden Power Fire helps this set act as a lure to Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, though it has limited use outside of that. Iron Head is another viable option to hit Fairy-types hard, such as Clefable and Gardevoir before it Mega Evolves.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs and a Mild nature allow Kyurem-B to outspeed fully invested, positive-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon, Speed tie with other neutral-nature Kyurem-B, and Adamant Mega Garchomp, while a Naive nature can be used to outspeed Pokemon such as Jolly Landorus-T and Heracross prior to Mega Evolution. Full investment in Special Attack raises the power of Ice Beam and Earth Power to maximum levels. Life Orb is the preferred item to make Kyurem-B's attacks hit as hard as possible. Teravolt is useful for breaking through several defensive abilities, such as Dragonite's Multiscale and Rotom-W's Levitate.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Kyurem-B should be used in the early- and mid-game as a dedicated wallbreaker. As this Kyurem-B will be worn down by Life Orb recoil, it should enter the battlefield on free switches whenever possible. Also be sure to keep entry hazards off the field, as Kyurem-B is weak to Stealth Rock and passive damage of any kind will wear it down even faster. Due to Kyurem-B's unpredictability, most opponents will switch their Pokemon around to try to scout Kyurem-B's moveset; take advantage of this by hitting the predicted switch-in with the appropriate attack. If running Outrage, do not use the move until the opponent's Fairy-types have been eliminated and their Steel-types weakened. If running Roost, use the move when Kyurem-B gets low on health; that way it can leave the battlefield and come in later if it needs to.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T and Azelf can wear down walls for Kyurem-B, giving it an easier time breaking down the opposing team. Entry hazard removers such as Excadrill are required because of Kyurem-B's Stealth Rock weakness. Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y can force out Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, both of which wall Kyurem-B should it lack Hidden Power Fire. Dedicated late-game sweepers, such as Serperior and Talonflame, enjoy Kyurem-B's wallbreaking because it allows them to clean up the opposing team more easily. Steel-types such as Bisharp appreciate Kyurem-B's ability to scare Ground-types, particularly Garchomp, Landorus-T, Diggersby, and Hippowdon.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Outrage is Kyurem-B's main STAB move. It hits extremely hard thanks to Kyurem-B's amazing Attack stat and Choice Band, and it can even 2HKO Steel-types like Heatran and Excadrill and OHKO a large portion of the offensive metagame. Fusion Bolt is Kyurem-B's best option for hitting Steel-types and Fairy-types, gaining at least neutral coverage on all of them bar Ferrothorn and Excadrill. It also deals massive damage to Water-types like Azumarill and Slowbro without requiring it to lock itself into Outrage. Iron Head is used in order to OHKO standard Clefable. Finally, Dragon Claw serves as a powerful STAB move that does not lock Kyurem-B in, enabling it to weaken Steel-types without having to predict. Ice Beam can also be used to OHKO Landorus-T, deal decent damage to Ferrothorn, and bypass Garchomp's Rough Skin; however, it is rather weak.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment makes Kyurem-B as powerful as possible, while its Speed is also maxed out to at least tie with other neutral-natured Kyurem-B. A Choice Band enables Kyurem-B to hit incredibly hard, making it difficult to wall without also making it suffer Life Orb recoil. An Adamant nature gives Kyurem-B a chance to OHKO standard Clefable with Iron Head from full health. However, a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed neutral-natured base 100s as well as at least Speed tie with other Kyurem-B.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Kyurem-B acts as a very straightforward wallbreaker. Try to get it in through U-turn and Volt Switch in order to limit the damage it takes throughout the battle. It can also be sent in on Water-types like Slowbro and Rotom-W; however, be careful, because a burn from Scald or Will-O-Wisp will leave it almost useless for the rest of the battle. Kyurem-B should be kept relatively healthy throughout the battle in order to clean the opposing team later in the match. Therefore, it will usually need entry hazards to be removed before being sent out on the field due to its Stealth Rock weakness. It can also be worn down by repeated Volt Switches from Pokemon it is supposed to counter. Early on in the battle, try to wear down Steel- and Fairy-types with Fusion Bolt, and avoid using Outrage. Once all Fairy-types have been removed and all Steel-types have been weakened, exclusively use Dragon Claw if Pokemon that can revenge kill Kyurem-B, like Keldeo and Mega Lopunny, are still active, and use Outrage otherwise. You also may want to use Outrage to severely weaken a Steel-type that threatens your team, such as Ferrothorn, or Chansey, which usually counters Kyurem-B but loses almost all of its health to a single Choice Band-boosted Outrage. While this set isn't as threatening to physical walls like Landorus-T and Hippowdon as its other sets, bluffing a mixed set can cause your opponent to switch these Pokemon out when facing Kyurem-B.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set works well on teams that require a bulky holepuncher with useful resistances to Water, Electric, and Grass. Magnezone is a great partner for Kyurem-B, since it can trap Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Skarmory, enabling it to more freely use Outrage, and check Fairies. Kyurem-B also requires support from an entry hazard remover. Latios is particularly good, since it can lure and eliminate Steel-types, particularly Ferrothorn with Hidden Power Fire, and appreciates Chansey being removed. Kyurem-B appreciates VoltTurn support from the likes of Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T, as they can get it in for free against a wall. Fairies are annoying for Kyurem-B to handle, since they prevent it from safely using Outrage. Thus, it requires support from a check to Fairies, like Jirachi, which can heal Kyurem-B up via Healing Wish; Scizor, which can set up on checks like Diancie and Ferrothorn; or Klefki, which provides Thunder Wave and Spikes support. Excadrill is particularly good, since it can remove hazards and, with sand support, clean faster teams, which Kyurem-B struggles against. Kyurem-B hates dealing with Ferrothorn, so a Pokemon that can lure it in and deal with it, like Swords Dance Landorus-T or Hidden Power Fire Starmie, makes for a good partner. A general check to Steel-types, like Heatran or Keldeo, is also required in order to help Kyurem-B outlast them. Garchomp supports Kyurem-B well, since it can also eliminate Steel-types via Fire Blast or even Swords Dance, set up Stealth Rock, and weaken faster attackers and priority users like Bisharp and Mega Lopunny. Choice Band Kyurem-B's ability to KO Chansey makes it a good partner for special attackers that want it removed, such as Starmie, Manaphy, Raikou and Mega Manectric.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute gives Kyurem-B a shield against weaker, resisted attacks as well as status moves. Ice Beam is Kyurem-B's best STAB attack due to its vast coverage, hitting Dragon-, Ground-, and Flying-types for massive damage. Fusion Bolt handles the Water-types that can switch into Ice Beam, such as Keldeo, Azumarill, and Mega Gyarados; the move also helps Kyurem-B against dedicated special walls, such as Chansey. Earth Power rounds out this set's coverage, taking down the Fire- and Steel-types that resist Ice Beam. However, Roost can also be used to make Kyurem-B last longer on the battlefield.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>56 HP EVs give Kyurem-B 404 HP, ensuring that Chansey's Seismic Toss will not break Kyurem-B's Substitute in a single hit. 252 EVs in Speed allow Kyurem-B to outspeed fully invested base 80 Speed Pokemon as well as Speed tie with other neutral-nature Kyurem-B, while the remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack alongside a Mild nature to make Kyurem-B hit as hard as possible. Leftovers is the preferred item to increased Kyurem-B's longevity, though Life Orb is an alternative to bluff a mixed wallbreaking set. The recoil from Life Orb can be healed off with Roost as well. Teravolt is useful for breaking through several defensive abilities, such as Dragonite's Multiscale and Rotom-W's Levitate.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is best used as a dedicated tank against offensive teams. Bring Kyurem-B into the battlefield against a Pokemon that it forces out, such as Suicune or Celebi, and then use Substitute on the predicted switch. After getting behind a Substitute, Kyurem-B can freely attack with the corresponding coverage move as the foe tries to break the Substitute. Keep in mind that this Kyurem set is not a wallbreaker, so it struggles against stall staples such as Chansey and Clefable.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard removal from the likes of Starmie, Zapdos, and Latias is crucial because Kyurem-B is vulnerable to all entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock. Steel-types such as Excadrill can deal with the Fairy-types that give Kyurem-B trouble. In particular, Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon must be eliminated because their Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice bypasses Kyurem-B's Substitute. Poison-types can also wear down Fairy-types and have great defensive synergy with Kyurem-B, tanking the Fighting-type moves that hit Kyurem-B super effectively. A strong physical attacker such as Mega Metagross can break down the special walls that can easily switch into Kyurem-B.</p> "

Kyurem-B possesses the most powerful Outrage in the game; the move annihilates anything that is not a Fairy- or Steel-type. Fusion Bolt gives Kyurem-B perfect neutral coverage alongside Ice Beam and hits Water-types and Flying-types that are neutral to Ice for massive damage. Dragon Claw is an alternative physical STAB attack that does not confuse Kyurem-B and prevent it from switching like Outrage does. Alternatively, Iron Head can be used to surprise Fairy-types such as Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Sylveon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Naive nature allow Kyurem-B to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T and OHKO it with Ice Beam. Full Attack investment maximizes the power of Kyurem-B's physical attacks. Choice Scarf makes Kyurem-B outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, allowing Kyurem-B to function as a terrifying cleaner and revenge killer.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set should be used as both a revenge killer after a teammate faints and a cleaner in the late-game. Kyurem-B will be spamming Outrage the majority of the time, but it must not use the move if opposing Fairy-types are still alive. If Kyurem-B is low on health, be careful around opposing Choice Scarf users and priority attackers, as they will both revenge kill Kyurem-B rather easily.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard removal is required for Kyurem-B to switch into the battlefield safely; Starmie, Excadrill, Zapdos, Latios, and Latias can all provide this. Steel- and Poison-types such as Mega Metagross and Gengar, respectively, can deal with the Fairy-types that prevent Kyurem-B from spamming Outrage. Dedicated special wallbreakers such as Manaphy and Mega Gardevoir can break down bulky Pokemon, allowing Kyurem-B to finish off the opposing team more easily. Entry hazard support from the likes of Klefki and Landorus-T can also wear down bulky foes. Magnezone can trap and KO the Steel-types that resist Outrage, particularly Ferrothorn. Pokemon weak to Ground, such as Heatran, Bisharp, Raikou, and Mega Diancie, appreciate Kyurem-B's ability to outspeed and KO Landorus-T, and non-Choice Scarf Garchomp.</p> "

  "Keldeo": {
    "overview": "<p>Keldeo is one of the most influential Pokemon in the ORAS metagame, being not only a complete powerhouse on its own, but also notorious for its ability to wear down a good majority of its checks through Scald burns, exerting an incredible amount of pressure in most games. Unlike most special attackers, Keldeo isn't walled by Chansey thanks to its signature STAB move in Secret Sword, which allows Keldeo to prey on its low Defense stat, giving it an inherent advantage versus stall. Additionally, good Speed and fantastic Special Attack, coupled with a fearsome STAB combination, ensure that it pulls its weight in just about every matchup. Keldeo also sports solid all-around bulk for an offensive Pokemon and great typing defensively, which allow it to check several threatening Pokemon such as Bisharp, Weavile, Tyranitar, Mega Scizor, and Heatran. All of these traits combined make Keldeo a very low-risk, high-reward Pokemon, capable of fulfilling a variety roles effectively on several types of teams. Due to a limited movepool, though, Keldeo will always be walled by something depending on what coverage it chooses. Some notable examples include Latios, Starmie, Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Latias, and for the latter two in particular, it doesn't matter what coverage Keldeo may have regardless. Furthermore, while Keldeo's Speed tier is good, it still leaves it outpaced by quite a few common Pokemon such as Latios, Starmie, Serperior, Tornadus-T, and Mega Lopunny.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Offensive Calm Mind is an option that can work, given that Keldeo benefits from an extra coverage move, but generally Choice Specs is better due to the immediate boost it gives, and the standard Calm Mind set really appreciates the extra longevity that Leftovers provides, in addition to the shield against status with Substitute. Expert Belt can be used to bluff Choice sets and catch certain counters off guard that think Keldeo is locked into a move. A RestTalk set using either Life Orb or Rocky Helmet lets Keldeo act as more reliable check to Mega Scizor, Bisharp, and Weavile due to being much harder to wear down. Taunt has use in shutting down passive Pokemon such as Alomomola, Suicune, and Gastrodon while also preventing Stealth Rock being set up by certain Pokemon. Endeavor can be a nice last-resort option on Keldeo's Choice Scarf set to break down an unsuspecting counter when low on HP. Endeavor can also be used in tandem with Substitute or a Focus Sash to force Keldeo down to low HP more reliably, thus taking the most advantage of it. Hidden Power Flying hits primarily Mega Venusaur and still maintains coverage on Amoonguss, but otherwise there are better coverage options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types, in particular those that resist Water as well, are some of the consistent Keldeo checks. Latios and Mega Latias in particular both are not 2HKOed by Keldeo's STAB combination, naturally outspeed Keldeo, and OHKO it with Psyshock. Both are also capable of restoring lost HP with Recover but can find themselves pressured to do so more when burned by Scald. Latios also has to watch out for Choice Specs-boosted Icy Wind, which will not only 2HKO it on the switch but also make Latios slower on the following turn. Other Pokemon such as Slowking and Slowbro are very troublesome, as they also resist Keldeo's STAB combination and can either cripple Keldeo with Thunder Wave, deal heavy damage with Psyshock, or set up Calm Mind against it. Keldeo also has harder time wearing them down with burns as well due to Regenerator, though it's worth noting that Slowbro is 2HKOed by Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock plus a burn. Starmie also outspeeds and promptly OHKOes or 2HKOes Keldeo depending on whether it's offensive or defensive, but offensive variants do have a much harder time switching in. It's worth noting that Starmie also doesn't mind Scald burns due to Natural Cure. Offensive variants also risk being 2HKOed by Hidden Power Electric from Keldeo's Choice Scarf set. Defensive Starmie can also fail to check Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo if it's already behind a Substitute and Starmie has opted for Thunder Wave or Toxic over Psyshock. (Mega) Alakazam is able to revenge kill Keldeo with Psychic, but it by no means can directly switch in and must be wary of Choice Scarf Keldeo.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Amoonguss is a thorn in Keldeo's side, taking little from even Choice Specs-boosted attacks and having Regenerator to alleviate the residual damage from Scald burns. To retaliate, Amoonguss can use Keldeo as a free opportunity to put something to sleep with Spore or just attack with Giga Drain. Mega Venusaur also hard walls Keldeo, not caring about any coverage move Keldeo carries, and being bulky enough that it can switch in to two Hydro Pumps, even when burned. Serperior, while by no means able to directly switch in, naturally outspeeds Keldeo and threatens to OHKO it with Leaf Storm. Serperior does have to watch out for its Choice Scarf set, though, as Secret Sword will 2HKO after Stealth Rock. Celebi, while certainly less common, is an incredibly consistent switch in to Keldeo thanks to its typing, bulk, access to Recover, and Natural Cure. Assault Vest Tangrowth is also a decent answer, but it does risk being 2HKOed by Choice Specs-boosted Focus Blast and in general hates being worn down by Scald burns due to a lack of recovery outside of Regenerator. Physically defensive Tangrowth is still capable of checking Keldeo, but only Choice Scarf or Substitute + Calm Mind variants.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Suicune, Gastrodon, Alomomola, and Rotom-W can also give Keldeo a hard time, as Keldeo cannot do much back to them except catch them on the switch with Focus Blast. It's worth noting that Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo can take advantage of the passive nature of most of these Pokemon by setting up freely, as Toxic or Scald burns is usually their most meaningful way of dealing with Keldeo. Suicune can be very difficult for Keldeo to face if Secret Sword is the best it can do back to it, as it has a small chance to 3HKO, meaning Suicune can, for the most part, continually use Rest and become even harder to break through as it sets up Calm Mind. Gastrodon also can break Keldeo's Substitutes with Earthquake and ensure it cannot be 2HKOed by setting up Curse alongside it. It's worth noting that Curse Gastrodon without any stat boosts risks getting 2HKOed by both Choice Specs-boosted Secret Sword and Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Tornadus-T naturally outspeeds Keldeo and OHKOes it with Hurricane; the Assault Vest set in particular is generally more consistent, as it finds more opportunities to switch in, but regardless hates being burned by Scald. Tornadus-T also can come in a few times thanks to Regenerator. While Talonflame and Mega Pinsir cannot switch in by any means, both are able revenge kill Keldeo, regardless of whether its Choice Scarf or not with Gale Wings Brave Bird and Aerilate Quick Attack, respectively, though Mega Pinsir needs quite a bit more prior damage to do so. They also cannot revenge kill Keldeo if it is behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Mega Altaria is a really solid check to Keldeo thanks to its typing in combination with Heal Bell and Roost, ensuring that it will outlast Keldeo, regardless of burns. Offensive variants of Mega Altaria, particularly Dragon Dance, are crippled by burns, while special Mega Altaria is able to bypass Keldeo's Substitute with Pixilate Hyper Voice. Clefable can also serve as a decent check, but it is extremely shaky versus its Choice Specs set, as Hydro Pump easily 2HKOes, and Scald forces Clefable to use Soft-Boiled as it switches in. After enough Calm Mind boosts, though, Keldeo fails to break past it barring critical hits and is OHKOed by a +1 Moonblast or neutered with Thunder Wave. Choice Scarf and Substitute + Calm Mind have a much harder time dealing with Clefable. Mega Gardevoir is by no means a good check to Choice Specs Keldeo, but it handles the other sets decently, especially Substitute + Calm Mind thanks to Pixilate Hyper Voice bypassing Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Thundurus, Raikou, and Mega Manectric outspeed Keldeo and OHKO it with Thunderbolt, but none of them are capable of switching in, and Mega Manectric has to be Mega Evolved prior to outspeed Keldeo; otherwise, Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump will OHKO it. All of them also fall flat to Keldeo's Choice Scarf set, as they're easily 2HKOed by the appropriate move.</p> <p><strong>Shedinja: While Shedinja isn't common by any means, it's noteworthy in that it's immune to all of the attacks on Keldeo's main movesets. To retaliate, Shedinja wears down Keldeo with Will-O-Wisp. The only way Keldeo can damage it is by using the rare Toxic or Hidden Power Flying, and even then, Shedinja is still able to scout for either of those moves by using Protect.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is Keldeo's most consistent and safest move to lock into, thanks to its decent Base Power, perfect accuracy, and, more importantly, ability to potentially burn its checks, making them much easier to handle in the long term. Secret Sword has decent neutral coverage with Keldeo's Water-type STAB moves, 2HKOing Pokemon such as Serperior, Ferrothorn, and Volcanion, and is important to have to ensure Keldeo is not stopped by Chansey. Hydro Pump is used for the extra firepower on bulkier targets such as Clefable, Mew, Mega Scizor, and Jirachi. Icy Wind is used in the last slot to 2HKO Latios and Latias on the switch and subsequently knock either out the following turn due to the Speed drop. It also has important coverage on other checks such as Amoonguss, Dragonite, and Mega Altaria. Alternatively, Focus Blast, while less consistent of a STAB attack than Secret Sword, is capable of OHKOing Rotom-W after Stealth Rock, as well as 2HKOing Suicune, Gastrodon, Alomomola, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Hidden Power Electric is an option to deal heavy damage to the likes of Gyarados, Starmie, and Azumarill, as well as maintaining coverage on other Water-types, though it's quite a bit weaker than Focus Blast for several of them.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Keldeo's offensive potential, ensuring it hits as hard as possible while taking advantage of its good Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed key threats such as Mega Medicham, Mega Gardevoir, and offensive Garchomp. Choice Specs is used to turn Keldeo into a fearsome wallbreaker, at the expense of being able to switch between its moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Generally, Scald is the safest move to use early-game to fish for burns on whatever checks the opponent may have. Don't hesitate to be aggressive, though, and predict incoming switch-ins with the appropriate STAB or coverage move; otherwise, Keldeo will get forced out more often. This is something that comes into play while Spikes are on Keldeo's side of the field, as repeated switches in will quickly put it in range to being knocked out by the likes of Weavile, Bisharp, and Mega Scizor. Likewise, try to avoid status as well because this causes a similar scenario. Toxic in particular means Keldeo will be likely stalled out or pivoted around until it's knocked out. Keldeo can also be brought in via double switches or VoltTurn support to keep up offensive momentum and give more chances to weaken the opposition. Once the enemy team is weakened enough, use Scald or Secret Sword to power through anything remaining. One particularly important thing to make note of is that while Keldeo is a solid check to Dark-types, you should try to avoid directly switching into them unless absolutely necessary, as Keldeo's wallbreaking prowess is cut into significantly if its Choice Specs gets Knocked Off. This is generally something to keep in mind more versus more balanced-inclined teams, where Keldeo will need the power.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dark-types, particularly those with Pursuit, pair incredibly with Keldeo. Choice Scarf Tyranitar is the most notable, because it outspeeds Latios and Starmie and traps both fairly easily. Support variants of Tyranitar also work, as they provide Stealth Rock support as well and, with a Chople Berry, can check Mega Alakazam. Weavile is a fantastic teammate as well because it handles not only Psychic-types but also common checks to Keldeo such as Serperior, Amoonguss, and Tornadus-T. Bisharp is also a fine option, though it tends to struggle a bit more versus faster threats due to its reliance on Sucker Punch. Keldeo complements them nicely by being able to check Mega Scizor, which can prove to very troublesome for all them. The latter two also appreciate teams being weakened to the point where they can clean with their high speed and powerful priority, respectively. Heatran is a valuable teammate for its ability to handle Serperior, Amoonguss, Tangrowth, Mega Venusaur, and non-Surf Latios in one slot. Additionally, it helps wear down bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Alomomola with Toxic, making it easier for Keldeo to muscle through them, as well as provide Stealth Rock support, enabling Keldeo to achieve certain OHKOs or 2HKOs. It also gives Keldeo some extra leeway when facing Mega Scizor. In return, Keldeo helps deal with Ground-types for Heatran. Rotom-W acts as pivot towards a few of Keldeo's checks such as Tornadus, Azumarill, and Slowbro, gaining momentum off all of them with Volt Switch, thus letting Keldeo enter the field safely to get off an attack. Rotom-W also alleviates some pressure from the likes of Heatran, Bisharp, and Weavile.</p> <p>Latios complements Keldeo nicely, being able to handle Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and various passive bulky Water-types while Keldeo deals with problematic Dark-types like Tyranitar and Weavile as well as Heatran. Stored Power Mega Latias also pairs well for similar reasons, but it particularly appreciates the removal of Dark-types and the offensive pressure Keldeo applies to Clefable. Calm Mind Clefable is also a nice sweeper to pair alongside Keldeo, as it handles Latios, Electric-types, and Mega Alakazam, using all of them as setup fodder and paralyzing any potential threats while Keldeo facilitates Clefable's sweep team by eliminating key threats such as Heatran and Mega Scizor. Mega Gardevoir and Keldeo form a fearsome wallbreaking duo that dismantles many balanced teams, being able to break past the likes of Amoonguss, Slowbro, and Clefable. Electric-types such as Thundurus, Zapdos, and Mega Manectric help Keldeo better deal with bulky Water-types, barring Gastrodon, and additionally help check the likes of Talonflame and Tornadus-T, both of which outspeed and OHKO Keldeo. Tornadus-T checks many problematic Pokemon for Keldeo such as Amoonguss, Serperior, Latios, and Alakazam while being able to gain momentum versus potential Heatran, Skarmory, and Jirachi with U-turn, which Keldeo can capitalize on.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is a decent move to lock into thanks to its consistent power and ability to burn potential checks, which is a bit more important on this set due to Keldeo struggling to deal meaningful damage to most of its checks otherwise. Hydro Pump provides sheer power over Scald, letting Keldeo revenge kill certain targets from full, such as Mega Manectric after two switches into Stealth Rock or one switch into Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes, as well as Life Orb Tornadus, Thundurus, and Gengar after Stealth Rock. It's also capable of 2HKOing Assault Vest Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock. Secret Sword is mainly to 2HKO Chansey, which otherwise walls Keldeo. Additionally, it provides as a nice tool to revenge kill the likes of Mega Lopunny. Icy Wind ensures Keldeo isn't a free switch for Latios, Dragonite, and Mega Altaria, notably preventing the latter two from gaining any Speed boosts from Dragon Dance. It also has the ability to OHKO offensive Garchomp after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. Hidden Power Electric is mainly used to revenge kill a +1 Gyarados, but it also has use in hitting Starmie and Azumarill. Toxic can be used to cripple bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Gastrodon in the long term, but it doesn't do much else.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs plus a Timid nature are crucial for letting Keldeo outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T, +1 Mega Charizard X, and Volcarona. Special Attack EVs are maximized to ensure it still hits hard, even without a boosting item. Choice Scarf is chosen to be able to revenge kill normally faster threats such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Manectric, and Mega Diancie.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is best played as a revenge killer: after a teammate has fainted, bring Keldeo in on the next turn to revenge kill a fast threat the opponent has on the field such as Diancie or +1 Mega Charizard X. Against bulkier teams, the best thing Keldeo can do is try to weaken its checks through Scald burns; otherwise, it cannot do as much in these matchups. An important thing to note is that Keldeo should avoid switching into Knock Off if it's needed to revenge kill certain faster threats such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Diancie, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Once the enemy team is weakened enough, Keldeo should be used to clean up late-game with whatever move is most appropriate. Just be aware that Hydro Pump should only be used if the extra power is necessary to take down a specific threat; otherwise, Scald is the better move to use due to its perfect accuracy.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to this set's lacking matchup versus balance and stall, Pokemon such as Choice Band Tyranitar, Taunt Tornadus-T, and Mega Metagross all pair well with it. Choice Band Tyranitar and Mega Metagross in particular are good at beating down Latios and Mega Latias, with both of them also capable of Pursuit trapping them. Mega Metagross also helps with Fairy-types such as Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Altaria. Other Dark-types such as Weavile and Bisharp also work, as both appreciate Keldeo's ability to revenge kill Mega Lopunny and Mega Diancie, while both are powerful enough to deal heavy damage to most of Keldeo's checks such as Amoonguss, Clefable, and Latios. Mega Medicham breaks down the likes of Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Calm Clefable, and if running Thunder Punch, it helps with Slowking and Slowbro in particular. Offensive Swords Dance Mega Scizor is a decent partner, as it appreciates Keldeo’s ability to handle Heatran, as well as a +1 Volcarona if it used Scizor to get a free Quiver Dance. Mega Scizor in return handles the likes of Amoonguss, Tangrowth, Clefable, Latios, and Mega Altaria. Ferrothorn is notable for its ability to check Gyarados, Azumarill, Starmie, and non-Hidden Power Fire Latios as well as provide Spikes support, making it easier for the opponent's Pokemon to be put into range of Keldeo's attacks. Nasty Plot Thundurus breaks down Amoonguss, Latios, and various bulky Water-types that stop Keldeo from having much of an impact.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Substitute + Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute shields Keldeo from status, letting it prey on passive Pokemon that cannot break it such as Suicune, Alomomola, and standard Heatran, as well as keeping it from being revenge killed by faster Pokemon. It also scouts what the opponent's initial switch-in may be. Calm Mind lets Keldeo become increasingly threatening, giving its attacks more firepower and making its Substitutes harder to break with special attacks. Scald is used over any other Water-type STAB due to its consistent power, ability to potentially burn checks, perfect accuracy, and high PP. Secret Sword complements Scald nicely through its coverage and ensures this set isn't walled by Chansey in particular.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Keldeo's offensive potential, ensuring that it still hits for a decent amount without any Calm Mind boosts. Maximum HP EVs over Special Attack are also an option to allow Keldeo's Substitute to not be broken by Amoonguss's Giga Drain while at +2. Just note that doing so means Keldeo will miss out on a significant amount of power, notably against the likes of Garchomp, Ferrothorn, and Clefable. A Timid nature is very important, letting Keldeo outspeed key threats such as offensive Garchomp, Mega Medicham, and Mega Charizard X. Leftovers is crucial for this set to work, helping Keldeo set up more Substitutes and alleviating chip damage like Stealth Rock or sandstorm damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set has a better matchup versus more balanced-inclined teams, so as such it should be played a bit more conservatively in order to ensure Keldeo can outlast the opposition and sweep. Keldeo should not be brought directly into Pokemon such as Heatran, Suicune, or Alomomola, as it risks getting crippled by burn, poison, or Knock Off in the case of the last, which ruins its chances of repeatedly setting up Substitute and Calm Mind. Use Substitute sparingly, as doing so too often weakens Keldeo to the point where it no longer is able to sweep and is easily picked off. Don't attempt to set up with Calm Mind while Keldeo's checks are still healthy; instead try to burn them as they switch in with Scald, increasing Keldeo's chances of breaking past them in the later stages of the match. Another thing to note is that you can use Keldeo behind a Substitute to bait a Pokemon such as Latios or Starmie to use Psyshock and subsequently bring in a Pursuit user in to trap them. Just keep in mind that the opponent can double switch into a Pokemon that can handle the Pursuit trapper, causing a loss in momentum.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pursuit support is a must, as without it, Keldeo has a very difficult time dealing with Latios, Latias, Starmie, and Slowking. Choice Band Tyranitar is a decent option, as it has the raw power to break through Mega Latias and Slowking. Choice Scarf also works to more reliably trap Starmie, but having Tyranitar simultaneously act as a breaker benefits Keldeo more, as this set is quite passive until it gets a couple Calm Mind boost under its belt. Mega Metagross also works well, as with the right coverage, it can weaken a good majority of Keldeo's checks and, if needed, can provide Pursuit support as well. It also helps deal with Clefable, Mega Diancie, and Mega Altaria. Lures to Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur are also very important, as Keldeo has a much easier time sweeping through the team once they're heavily weakened or eliminated. Such examples include Lansat Berry Natural Gift Breloom, Stored Power Clefable, and maximum Attack Mega Diancie. Tornadus-T is also a fine option as a more direct means of threatening Keldeo's checks. Tornadus-T can also gain switch initiative with U-turn off Heatran, giving Keldeo a free opportunity to set up a Substitute depending on the variant.</p> <p>Heatran deals with Amoonguss, Tangrowth, Mega Venusaur, and non-Surf Latios, as well as cripple bulky Water-types that tend to switch into it such as Rotom-W, Alomomola, and Gastrodon, making it easier for Keldeo to break through the opposition. Talonflame is notable for its ability to break past Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Clefable. It also wears down Water-type switch-ins with Will-O-Wisp. In return, Keldeo threatens various Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon. Keldeo also preys on bulky Water-types that don't mind status from Talonflame as much, most notably Suicune, which Keldeo can boost on and eventually break past with Secret Sword. Maximum Attack Mega Diancie applies pressure to Clefable and aids Keldeo in dealing with Flying-types such as Tornadus and Talonflame. Spikes help this Keldeo set a lot in the long term; Ferrothorn is the best option for this, as it deals with some problematic foes such as Azumarill, Latios, and Starmie, being able to set up Spikes easily on all of them. Keldeo in return threatens Heatran and sets up on non-Psychic Mew. Other breakers, such as Gengar, Excadrill, and Garchomp also aid Keldeo in dealing with some of its checks.</p> "

  "Chesnaught": {
    "overview": "<p>Chesnaught's great physical bulk allows it to shut down unprepared physical attackers such as Excadrill, Mega Lopunny, Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Terrakion. Its amazing ability Bulletproof grants it immunities to common attacks such as Shadow Ball, Gyro Ball, Focus Blast, and Sludge Bomb. Its good support movepool with Leech Seed and Spikes gives it means of supporting the team, but the biggest change to Chesnaught in ORAS has been the addition of Drain Punch. With it, Chesnaught is no longer reliant on Hammer Arm, which drops Chesnaught's Speed, and can sustain itself while also hitting the enemy for decent damage. However, it has a huge number of weaknesses that hinder its defensive prowess, especially to Flying, which is made more problematic with the prevalence of Talonflame and Mega Pinsir in the current metagame. Its poor Special Defense inhibits it even further, meaning it is weak to many common special attackers. It's also very slow, meaning it can't naturally outspeed opposing walls. It also suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, as it is limited by its move choices. Additionally, Chesnaught faces competition from Ferrothorn as a defensive Spiker, which boasts a better typing and defenses. Despite these drawbacks, Chesnaught still can be quite a threat under the correct circumstances.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Chesnaught certainly doesn't lack in other options, but several of these are niches. Stone Edge can surprise Flying-types on the switch. Substitute on the defensive set can be used to give Chesnaught a way to handle status, and it can be used in combination with Spiky Shield and Leech Seed. Roar can be used for shuffling foes and racking up entry hazard damage. Super Fang can whittle down Pokemon that Chesnaught can't damage with its usual STAB moves. Toxic is useful on more stall-based teams, and Taunt is fantastic for phazing and stopping setup sweepers. Chesnaught can use a combination of Substitute, Salac Berry, and Belly Drum to function as a sweeper, capable of setting up on common Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, and defensive Landorus-T, however, it is easily revenge killed by common Flying-types in Talonflame and Tornadus-T.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types: Flying-types such as Talonflame, Staraptor, and Mega Pinsir all threaten Chesnaught with their 4x super effective STAB moves. They do not appreciate switching into Leech Seed, however.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Chesnaught still hits reasonably hard with Drain Punch; however, it can easily be shut down by faster Taunt users such as Thundurus, Mandibuzz, and Mew.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur: Mega Venusaur isn't affected by Leech Seed, can shrug off Drain Punch if carrying Synthesis, and deal heavy damage to Chesnaught with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-Types such as Charizard, Heatran, Volcarona, and Mega Camerupt all threaten Chesnaught with their respective STAB moves, though they don't appreciate Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Gardevoir, Sylveon, Mega Altaria, and Clefable all can take care of Chesnaught. Clefable is a good answer to Chesnaught as its Magic Guard ability negates Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Users: Magic Bounce users can deflect Spikes and Leech Seed. Mega Diancie in particular can KO Chesnaught with Moonblast. However, it fears switching into a Grass-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types such as Mega Metagross, Mega Gallade, Latios, Latias, Slowbro, and Medicham all threaten Chesnaught with their super effective moves. Even physical attackers such as Gallade and Medicham can eliminate Chesnaught with enough damage. However, most of these Pokemon don't appreciate taking Leech Seed and Spiky Shield damage.</p> <p><strong>Gengar: Gengar can set up a Substitute, threaten to burn with Will-O-Wisp, or OHKO Chesnaught with STAB Sludge Wave.</p> ",

        "name": "Physical Tank",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leech Seed is Chesnaught's main form of recovery and allows it to recover a lot of HP when used in combination with Spiky Shield. Drain Punch is Chesnaught's other form of recovery. Backed by STAB and solid Attack, Drain Punch allows Chesnaught to heal itself while still dishing out damage. Spikes gives Chesnaught utility by punishing opposing Pokemon as they switch in. Chesnaught can set up multiple layers of spikes due to its high physical bulk. Wood Hammer has an impressive Base Power of 120 and is a STAB move and can be used to handle common bulky Water-types and Ground-types such as Azumarill, Hippowdon, Swampert, Quagsire, and Gastrodon. Seed Bomb can be used for its lack of recoil damage, but it has less power. Spiky Shield could also allow Chesnaught to recover more HP in conjunction with Leech Seed while also enabling it to deal chip damage, lock Choiced Pokemon into their respective moves, and enable Chesnaught to better handle Gyarados, a huge boon for a defensive wall.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EVs are standard for a physical tank such as Chesnaught: max Defense and HP to make it as physically bulky as possible. More Attack and Speed can be used for more offensive prowess, at the cost of some bulk. Bulletproof is far superior to Overgrow, as it gives Chesnaught some helpful immunities to common attacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Leech Seed with its passive damage and health restoration makes Chesnaught a great tank. Set up Leech Seed as soon as possible. Using Leech Seed on a Pokemon that cannot hurt Chesnaught very much will probably force a switch, and said switch should be capitalized on by setting up Leech Seed or Spikes. That said, Spiky Shield is still a great move that is ideal to use against Choiced foes, such as Keldeo, to scout moves and appropriately respond. If Spiky Shield is not being run, instead use Wood Hammer to force out Pokemon such as Azumarill and Gyarados. Spikes should be used on switches that Chesnaught forces with its sheer bulk, but be wary of Defog and Rapid Spin. Instead, take advantage of these switches by using Leech Seed once more. Drain Punch should be used whenever Chesnaught can get a chance to attack, as it deals damage and gives Chesnaught some health back. When facing a boosted enemy that Chesnaught can significantly damage, such as Bisharp, don't waste your time with Leech Seed or Spikes, as using them causes Chesnaught to take unnecessary damage; go for the KO with Drain Punch. Chesnaught hates status, so try to keep it free of these afflictions. Be wary of special attackers and don't let Chesnaught stay in for long in unfavorable situations.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Chansey can heal status, provide good defensive synergy, and contribute Wish support. Heatran covers all of Chesnaught's defensive weaknesses, while Chesnaught covers Heatran's weaknesses to Ground and Water. In addition, Heatran's special bulk and Chesnaught's physical bulk complement each other. Heatran can also set up Stealth Rock to weaken Flying-types and continually shuffle foes with Roar. Slowbro and Slowking work well with Chesnaught as well, although Slowking has special bulk to complement Chesnaught's physical bulk and has access to Dragon Tail for synergy with entry hazards. Rotom-W provides Chesnaught with some switch-in opportunities while covering its weaknesses as well; Rotom-W's weakness to Grass is covered by Chesnaught. Rotom-H can also fit this role. Spinblockers can be valuable to Chesnaught because having its Spikes removed by Rapid Spin would reduce its effectiveness.</p> "

  "Diggersby": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Diggersby might not look impressive with its generally low stats, its great ability Huge Power doubles its Attack stat, making it an excellent wallbreaker. Immunities to Ghost- and Electric-type attacks give it opportunities to set up and an immunity to Thunder Wave. Access to great boosting moves in Swords Dance and Agility and surprisingly great STAB coverage backed up by the elemental punches and Knock Off make Diggersby a fearsome Pokemon that all teams should prepare for. However, Diggersby is not without flaws; weaknesses to common Grass-, Ice-, and Fighting-type moves make it somewhat hard for Diggersby to effectively sweep. Lackluster Speed and bad bulk also hold Diggersby back, as it is easily revenge killed by anything that can survive a Quick Attack. Fast Pokemon such as Mega Metagross make this flaw noticeable. Diggersby's weaknesses to common priority moves such as Aqua Jet, Mach Punch, and Ice Shard are also annoying for it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A double dance set with Agility, Swords Dance, Earthquake, and Return could be used, but although Diggersby has good STAB coverage to make it work, it lacks the bulk to effectively pull it off without dual screens support. A Choice Band set could be used with the same moves as the Choice Scarf set, but it's mostly outclassed as a wallbreaker by the Swords Dance set. Diggersby can use an offensive Spikes set that takes advantage of the switches it forces to lay down Spikes and wear the opponent down. Ice Punch can be used to lure in and OHKO offensive variants of Landorus-T, while defensive variants come very close to getting OHKOed. However, variants with no HP or Defense investment already get 2HKOed by Return anyway, which is why Ice Punch is not a preferred option. Substitute is a useful move to protect Diggersby from status and could be used over Swords Dance, Fire Punch, or Knock Off. Jolly Diggersby can easily set up a Substitute on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Mew, but the move requires it to hold Leftovers for longevity, limiting Diggersby's offensive capabilities.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ghost-types: As it is immune to Diggersby's STAB moves, Gengar can freely switch in against the Swords Dance set and do whatever it wants. It also puts a lot of pressure on the Choice Scarf set because Gengar gets free switches against Diggersby's STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority Attacks: Because of Diggersby's lackluster bulk, it struggles to survive strong priority attacks such as Crawdaunt and Azumarill's Aqua Jet, Mamoswine and Weavile's Ice Shard, Breloom and Conkeldurr's Mach Punch, and Talonflame's Gale Wings Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Fast Pokemon that resist Quick Attack, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Heatran, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar, can take a +2 Quick Attack pretty well and KO Diggersby rather easily in return. It should be noted that Diggersby's Choice Scarf set actually outspeeds the latter two and takes care of them very easily with a STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon: Although Diggersby breaks through a lot of walls, there are some defensive Pokemon Diggersby struggles with. Base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mew and Celebi can outspeed Diggersby and burn it or use Giga Drain, respectively. Landorus-T can switch into the all-out attacker and Choice Scarf sets and do huge damage back. Landorus-T is, however, not hard to wear down due to its lack of reliable recovery. Skarmory resists both of Diggersby's STAB moves, but it needs Counter to actually defeat it. Skarmory also fails to wall Fire Punch variants and can be trapped by Magnezone if its Shed Shell has been taken away. Physically defensive Mega Slowbro and Alomomola can also come in for free and can threaten Diggersby with Scald, though Alomomola cannot come in safely against Swords Dance Diggersby.</p> ",

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Return is Diggersby's primary STAB move, boasting incredible breaking power and excellent neutral coverage. Earthquake is Diggersby's other STAB move, hitting most Pokemon that resist Return hard, particularly grounded Steel-types. Quick Attack is a rather strong priority attack that makes Diggersby a legitimate threat against offensive teams. Swords Dance boosts Diggersby's Attack stat to insane levels, allowing it to 2HKO Skarmory with Life Orb-boosted Return and making Quick Attack a potent cleaning tool. However, Skarmory often carries Counter, so Fire Punch is a useful option to 2HKO it on the switch; it also OHKOes Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, which otherwise beat Diggersby 1v1.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Full Attack and Speed investment maximize Diggersby's offensive capabilities. Life Orb is the preferred item to hit even harder while still being able to switch moves, but a Focus Sash can prevent Diggersby from being revenge killed or help it set up against offensive teams. It also makes Diggersby a pretty effective lead that can do a lot of damage right off the bat and potentially get some surprise KOs. An Adamant nature is preferred to do as much damage as possible and thus maximize Diggersby's wallbreaking potential. A Jolly nature can, however, be used to improve Diggersby's matchup against offensive teams by making it capable of outspeeding Breloom, Jolly Bisharp, Adamant Excadrill, most Mew variants, Timid Heatran, Adamant Dragonite, Adamant Gyarados, and Jolly Mega Tyranitar, among others. Note that both Jolly and Focus Sash are generally poor options if not running Swords Dance, as Diggersby needs all the raw power it can get without the potential to boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set works best early- or mid-game to weaken or just defeat walls for teammates to sweep later. Do not set up on anything offensive except for Choice-locked Electric- or Ghost-types, because with Diggersby's bulk it simply won't work, unless it has a Focus Sash. It is, however, easy to set up on passive Pokemon such as Chansey. A +2 Return 2HKOes Skarmory after Stealth Rock damage, and a +2 Quick Attack can OHKO or come close to OHKOing a lot of offensive Pokemon, including Mega Sceptile, Mega Gallade, Thundurus, and Tornadus-T. Even without a Swords Dance boost, a Life Orb-boosted Quick Attack can revenge kill less bulky Pokemon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Skarmory is Swords Dance Diggersby's best check on defensive teams, so Magnezone is a great teammate to remove it. Mega Pinsir and Diggersby weaken each other's counters and checks, and together with Magnezone they form a great core. If using this core, teammates with Knock Off are necessary because Skarmory always has a Shed Shell to escape from Magnezone. Examples of these would be Azumarill, Bisharp, Mamoswine, and Scizor. Pokemon that can switch into Mach Punch, Aqua Jet, and Ice Shard users such as Breloom, Crawdaunt, and Mamoswine are good teammates. Examples of these are Azumarill, Mega Venusaur, and Keldeo. While not necessary, Pursuit support from Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Weavile is useful to remove Gengar, which hard counters this set. Healing Wish support is amazing, as it lets Diggersby get a second attempt at sweeping. With it, Diggersby can wallbreak for itself early-game, and then clean up late-game. Latias is easily the best user of Healing Wish.</p> "

Return is a secondary STAB move that hits a lot of Pokemon that are immune or resistant to Earthquake, and it is one of the reasons to use Choice Scarf Diggersby over Choice Scarf Landorus-T, the other reason being access to Wild Charge to hit Skarmory with. Knock Off hits Gengar, which is immune to both of Diggersby's STAB moves, as well as the occasional Bronzong, and is a generally good utility move with which to remove items, most notably Shed Shell from Skarmory. Wild Charge removes the need to Knock Off Skarmory's Shed Shell, as Diggersby has a good chance of 2HKOing Skarmory on the switch with Stealth Rock up. U-turn is mandatory to take advantage of any switches Diggersby causes to gain momentum. It also OHKOes Celebi, which can survive a Return.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack EVs maximize Diggersby's damage output. 252 Speed EVs let Diggersby outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame with a Choice Scarf, with the few relevant exceptions being Mega Alakazam, Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Sceptile. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Mega Lopunny, Mega Manectric, and some slower Choice Scarf users such as Magnezone and Tyranitar; due to the high viability of Mega Lopunny in this metagame, Adamant isn't really an option. A Choice Scarf is the chosen item for this set, as it makes Diggersby capable of outspeeding and surprising many common offensive threats.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Diggersby does not like being locked into either one of its STAB moves, so predict well and use U-turn a lot to prevent it from becoming setup fodder for a foe such as Mega Sableye or Landorus and to wear down Diggersby's checks and counters so it can clean up late-game with its powerful moves. With a Choice Scarf, Diggersby can be a decent revenge killer, but it is not exactly the best choice for this role, because its Speed is still not high enough to revenge kill Speed-boosting sweepers such as Gyarados and Mega Altaria, and it is defeated by strong priority attacks from Pokemon such as Azumarill and Dragonite.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>If using Wild Charge, this set baits Skarmory pretty well, so Pokemon that appreciate it being weakened or removed, such as Excadrill, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Metagross, are good teammates. Other Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Raikou and Talonflame can form a VoltTurn core with Diggersby and keep the momentum on your side. Entry hazard setters such as Heatran, Mamoswine, and Ferrothorn force foes to take hazard damage every time they switch in, making them easier to wear down for Diggersby to clean up late-game. As Choice Scarf Diggersby fails to revenge kill Speed-boosting sweepers, Pokemon such as Thundurus and Talonflame are good partners to revenge kill them instead. Powerful wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B, Mega Heracross, and Mega Pinsir can help soften up the opposing team for Diggersby to clean up. Magnezone is an obvious teammate that can remove Skarmory, one of Diggersby's best checks, once Skarmory's Shed Shell has been Knocked Off.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Despite having largely mediocre stats and a vulnerable typing, Talonflame remains a viable option thanks to its ability Gale Wings, which gives its Flying-type moves, such as Brave Bird, Roost and Acrobatics, priority. Talonflame also has an above-average Speed stat to use its other moves quickly, which include Swords Dance, Will-O-Wisp, and Taunt to stop entry hazards as well as status moves and setup. It does, however, struggle with Stealth Rock, which takes away 50% of its health every time it comes in. With a lack of offensive coverage and a subpar Attack stat, Talonflame can easily be dealt with by common Pokemon like Heatran, Zapdos, Rotom-W, Tyranitar, and Thundurus.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Offensive sets like Choice Band and three attacks with Sharp Beak can be run but are subpar at best. Bulk Up can also be run over Swords Dance to increase Talonflame's defensive presence.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Mega Diancie resists Talonflame's attacks and is immune to Will-O-Wisp thanks to Magic Bounce. It can also OHKO Talonflame with Diamond Storm. Tyranitar resists Talonflame's STAB moves and can threaten it back with Stone Edge, but Will-O-Wisp on the switch severely cripples it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Thundurus, Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Magnezone can all threaten Talonflame with Volt Switch or Thunderbolt. If Talonflame is not at full HP, though, it can use Roost to make these moves not super effective.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Physically defensive Water-types like Slowbro, Mega Slowbro, Alomomola, and Quagsire can take Talonflame's attacks easily while threatening it back with a super effective STAB Scald. Bulky Water-types are also likely to have Toxic, which puts Talonflame on a timer.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Garchomp can tank attacks from Talonflame and punish it with Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet or use Toxic against it. Hippowdon can take hits from Talonflame and threaten it back with a Rock Slide. Both of these Ground-types, however, do not appreciate Taunt or Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Heatran: Heatran resists Talonflame's STAB moves while also being immune to Will-O-Wisp.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Acrobatics is strong and does not wear Talonflame down with recoil like Brave Bird does. This lack of recoil, Roost, and Will-O-Wisp let Talonflame use Swords Dance to both sweep teams and break through defensive cores. Will-O-Wisp plus extra bulk makes it easier for Talonflame to set up Swords Dance compared to the offensive Swords Dance set. Roost and Will-O-Wisp also provide defensive utility.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP EVs minimize the damage Talonflame takes from Stealth Rock. 8 Defense EVs allow Talonflame to always live a Thunder Punch from Mega Metagross at full HP. Alternatively, you can invest 60 Attack EVs into Speed, allowing Talonflame to outspeed Pokemon up to Jolly Excadrill. Gale Wings gives Acrobatics and Roost priority. Talonflame runs no item to double the damage from Acrobatics, and this also reduces damage from Knock Off from the likes of Bisharp and Weavile.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Talonflame's typing leaves it vulnerable to Stealth Rock, so don't send it into Stealth Rock if possible. If you must switch it in anyway, send it in on foes that can't threaten it like Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn and immediately use Roost. Use Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers like Tyranitar, Weavile, Mega Metagross, and Landorus-T, wear down checks and counters like Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Mega Tyranitar, and wear down more defensive threats like Skarmory and Ferrothorn so that they're forced to recover up more often. Once checks and counters are weakened or eliminated, use Swords Dance and priority Acrobatics to sweep or clean up teams.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Talonflame must have a teammate that can remove Stealth Rock for it. Starmie can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards, switch into foes like Heatran, and spread Toxic to Water-types that can threaten Talonflame like Rotom-W and Slowbro. Starmie appreciates Talonflame's ability to spread Will-O-Wisp on Pursuit users like Tyranitar and handle Grass-types like Serperior and Amoonguss. Excadrill also has access to Rapid Spin, is able to take Electric-type attacks for Talonflame, and appreciates Talonflame resisting attacks from Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona as well as Grass-types like Tangrowth and Serperior. Latios and Latias can both provide Defog support while also taking on Water- and Electric-types like Rotom-W, Slowbro, Thundurus, and Zapdos. Latios and Latias also appreciate Talonflame burning common Dark-types like Bisharp and Tyranitar. Grass-types like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Serperior are all good partners, as they can deal with Water-types that threaten Talonflame. Mega Diancie is able to offensively check Electric-types like Zapdos and Thundurus and prevent entry hazards thanks to Magic Bounce. It also appreciates Talonflame's ability to take on Grass-types like Serperior and Amoonguss as well as Steel-types like Skarmory and Ferrothorn.

Its residual damage is also useful against foes like Thundurus, Rotom-W, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn. Roost is used to keep Talonflame healthy so it can consistently come onto the field. Swords Dance helps it break through defensive teams as well as sweep. Taunt is a viable option over Swords Dance, as it can stop recovery from the likes of Chansey, entry hazards from Pokemon like Skarmory and Ferrothorn, and setup from foes like Clefable.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Gale Wings gives Talonflame priority on Brave Bird, which allows it to revenge kill and sweep teams late-game, as well as on Roost, allowing it to stall out faster foes or avoid super effective damage from Electric-type moves like Volt Switch. 248 HP EVs allow Talonflame to take the least amount of damage from Stealth Rock, 8 Defense EVs allow it to always survive a Thunder Punch from Mega Metagross, and 252 Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature allow it to take on special hits from the likes of Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, Serperior, and Clefable a lot more easily. Talonflame can also invest 60 Special Defense EVs into Speed, allowing it to outspeed Jolly Excadrill. Additionally, a more physically bulky spread can be run to better take on physical attackers such as Mega Scizor and Excadrill that lack Rock Slide.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Talonflame should avoid coming onto the battlefield if Stealth Rock is up. If it must switch into Stealth Rock, make sure it comes in on Pokemon that cannot deal too much damage to it like Leftovers Clefable, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard Y, which all can't KO Talonflame from half HP. Make sure to use Roost right after. Use Will-O-Wisp as Pokemon that check Talonflame like Thundurus, Tyranitar, Rotom-W, and Zapdos switch in to slowly whittle them down. Take advantage of this set's bulkier spread and use Swords Dance on Pokemon that cannot outdamage Roost and Leftovers, like Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, Clefable, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn. Make sure Talonflame's checks are eliminated or in range of Brave Bird before you use Swords Dance.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon with Rapid Spin or Defog are good partners for Talonflame given its weakness to Stealth Rock. Excadrill can use Rapid Spin and soak up Electric-type moves that threaten Talonflame. Latios and Latias can help Talonflame with its common weaknesses in Electric and Water while also removing Stealth Rock with Defog. Latios and Latias also appreciate Talonflame's ability to burn problematic Dark-types like Tyranitar and Bisharp. Starmie can help deal with the likes of Heatran, spread Toxic on Water-types like Slowbro and Rotom-W, and remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Starmie also appreciates Talonflame burning common Dark-types. Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Serperior can help deal with Water-types like Slowbro and Quagsire, and Rock-types like Mega Diancie and Choice Scarf Tyranitar resist Electric-type hits from the likes of Magnezone and Rotom-W that threaten Talonflame. Clefable can act as a status absorber, take on Electric-types like Rotom-W, and provide Knock Off and Thunder Wave support to cripple the likes of Heatran.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>After the Aegislash ban, many powerful wallbreakers that Aegislash stopped now roam free without having to run additional coverage to get past it. By virtue of its typing and natural bulk, Doublade fills the void left by Aegislash's departure. Its ability to beat the likes of Mega Heracross, Mega Medicham, and Mega Gardevoir makes it a popular choice on stall teams. The fact that the metagame stopped preparing for its defensive typing after the Aegislash ban, such as Mega Medicham forfeiting Fire Punch and Mega Pinsir, Mega Heracross, and Terrakion forfeiting Earthquake, gives Doublade the ability to completely stop a few important threats. Its immunity to trapping is a huge advantage over the likes of Ferrothorn and Skarmory, which need to run Shed Shell to avoid Magnet Pull from breaking them down. Unfortunately, Doublade's ability No Guard makes all moves used against it, notably Hydro Pump, Fire Blast, and Will-O-Wisp, always hit. Doublade's Special Defense stat is also very mediocre, meaning it gets worn down by a few things it is supposed to counter, namely Mega Gardevoir, Latias, and Latios. Doublade also suffers from a lack of recovery apart from Rest, making it require Heal Bell support to function efficiently and wall threats consistently.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Doublade doesn't have many options in its arsenal, but Shadow Sneak is usable for finishing off weakened opponents such as Mega Medicham and Mega Gardevoir and dealing chip damage before Doublade gets OHKOed. A Swords Dance set with Shadow Sneak, Sacred Sword, and a coverage move with an EV spread of 128 HP / 116 Atk / 48 Def / 216 SpD and a Sassy nature could work, as Doublade forces many switches; however, it's easily revenge killed by Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Talonflame, and it's easily walled by common Ground-types and physical walls.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bisharp: Bisharp threatens Doublade with Pursuit and Knock Off and doesn't mind Gyro Ball or Toxic, but it must be careful not to switch into Sacred Sword.</p> <p><strong>Mandibuzz</strong>: Mandibuzz dislikes Toxic, but it walls Doublade and can wear it down with Foul Play, remove its Eviolite with Knock Off, or even Taunt it so it can't use Rest.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, Thundurus, and Manectric are some special attackers that force Doublade out, however, they must be wary of switching into Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types: Gliscor walls Doublade completely and while Landorus-T and Hippowdon don't like to switch into Toxic, they can tank any of Doublade's hits and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur don't care about Doublade at all, and they can threaten it with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Heatran is immune to Toxic and takes negligible damage from Gyro Ball, while Sacred Sword can't even 2HKO it.

Toxic cripples common switch-ins such as Mega Charizard X and Y, Talonflame, Mega Manectric, and bulky Ground- and Water-types. Sleep Talk is useful so Doublade will not be complete setup bait after using Rest, while Sacred Sword is mainly for Bisharp, which would otherwise threaten Doublade, and to hit Heatran and Magnezone on the switch. Pursuit traps the likes of Celebi, Latias, and Latios. Rest is the only recovery Doublade gets and should only be used when Doublade gets weakened; it also cures its status.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread and an Eviolite allow Doublade to take on Mega Gardevoir reliably, as Doublade is already physically bulky enough to take on Mega Pinsir, Mega Medicham, Mega Heracross, Terrakion, Hawlucha, Lucario, and Breloom. A Sassy nature and a 0 Speed IVs maximizes Gyro Ball's power, allowing Doublade to score crucial OHKOs and 2HKOs on the threats it checks or counters.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Doublade has an average Special Defense stat, so only switch in on resisted special attacks. Use Toxic early in the game, as Doublade forces many switches, and be careful around Pursuit trappers. Try to avoid getting worn down by certain threats if you also need Doublade to take on other ones. For example, don't switch it in on Latios if there is also a Mega Gardevoir on the opposing team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Doublade appreciates cleric support, so pairing it up with Chansey, Sylveon, or Clefable is a good idea. Doublade needs to be paired with a counter to wallbreakers that beat it, such as Mega Charizard Y and Crawdaunt, because they can take advantage of it very easily and threaten the rest of your team. Chansey and Chesnaught, respectively, are options that cover them. Doublade should also be paired up with an additional check to Mega Gardevoir, as it cannot always take it on on its own, so Jirachi makes for a good partner. Bisharp is a big threat to Doublade, so checks such as Chesnaught and Mega Charizard X are amazing partners. Mega Charizard X also enjoys Slowbro and Landorus-T getting hit by Toxic and takes on stallbreakers such as Mew and Gengar. Heatran also pairs up well with Doublade because it is able to switch into Mega Gardevoir's Hyper Voice, motivating it to use Focus Blast, which gives Doublade an easier time switching into it the next turn. It also takes on Hidden Power Fire Latios and Mega Charizard X without Earthquake. Checks to Keldeo and Mega Charizard X such as Mega Venusaur and Slowbro, respectively, are recommended, as they can come in easily on Doublade.</p> "

  "Dragalge": {
    "overview": "<p>Based on stats alone, there are much more powerful specially based available Dragon-types such as Latios and Latias; why would you use a Pokemon with a mere base 97 Special Attack? Furthermore, Dragalge is the slowest fully evolved Dragon-type in the game. Alongside its defensive typing, and in the context of the OU metagame, this means it has to worry about being revenge killed by many top-tier threats, including Mega Charizard X, Excadrill, Landorus-T, Mega Alakazam, Mega Medicham, and Latios.</p> <p>However, by virtue of that same defensive typing, Dragalge is able to find a place on many teams as a tank, capable of handling many common threats, including Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, Gengar, Clefable, Manaphy, Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Mega Venusaur. Regardless of the set, Dragalge's ability Adaptability (which bolsters the power of its STAB moves by a total factor of 2), is a great boon. Dragalge is also able to differentiate itself from other Dragon-types thanks to its access to STAB Sludge Wave, which powers through many common Fairy-types, including Clefable, as well as its secondary Poison typing, which renders it neutral to Fairy-type moves to which Latios or Latias would fall. Dragalge also provides additional utility with Toxic Spikes, which allows it to cut into the longevity of foes such as Substitute Calm Mind Keldeo. However, do not assume Dragalge needs Toxic Spikes to function; it can also use a devastating Choice Specs set capable of achieving feats such as OHKOing Mew, Keldeo, and Zapdos.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Haze is a really great move for any set lacking Choice Specs, as it eases the checking or countering of many setup sweepers, including Clefable, Mega Sableye, Volcarona, and Keldeo, by reducing their stat gains as well as bringing Dragalge's Special Attack back to normal after using Draco Meteor. RestTalk can be useful on defensive sets whose teams don't desire Toxic Spikes. The RestTalk combination allows Dragalge to constantly heal off status as well as damage taken, and therefore lets Dragalge be a much more reliable counter to Mega Charizard Y, Rotom-W, and Gengar. Toxic poisons potential switch-ins to defensive sets, such as Talonflame, that are immune to Toxic Spikes. Dragon Tail hits nowhere near as hard as Dragalge's other Dragon-type STAB moves, but it can be useful for its ability to phaze foes. It can work well in tandem with Toxic Spikes, spreading the poisoned or badly poisoned statuses to grounded foes. Hydro Pump is an alternative for the fourth slot on the Choice Specs set. Basically, it does more damage to specially defensive Heatran than Scald does while having better accuracy than Focus Blast. Sludge Bomb is a possibility over Sludge Wave; it trades 5 Base Power and the ability to hit Chesnaught for a 20% increase in the chance to poison. Venoshock hits very hard against poisoned foes, which makes it pair well with sets involving Toxic Spikes, but against targets that aren't poisoned it's very weak. Substitute can be useful, as if used on the switch it allows Dragalge to do massive damage to the foe that is forced to break the Substitute. It, however, must be used in lieu of Scald, a STAB move, or Toxic Spikes, which are all extremely important to any set's success.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types: Steel-types resist Dragon-type moves and are immune to Poison-type moves, so naturally they make for the best checks and counters to Dragalge. Klefki is immune to both of Dragalge's STAB types, loses half of its health at most from a Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power Fire, and can use Dragalge for Spikes setup. Jirachi takes little from any of Dragalge's attacks, can use Wish to heal off any damage taken and can threaten with its STAB super effective Zen Headbutt. Mega Metagross and Assault Vest Metagross can tank any hit and threaten Dragalge with a STAB Zen Headbutt. Mega Metagross and Metagross must, however, be wary of Scald burns. Specially defensive Heatran can easily switch into Dragalge's STAB moves. Mega Scizor can switch into any move except for Hidden Power Fire and Roost off the damage. It must, however, be wary of Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey: Blissey and Chansey avoid the 2HKO from a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor, so both can switch in and subsequently force Dragalge out.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is an obscenely powerful STAB move that hits everything except Fairy- and Steel-types neutrally. If setting Toxic Spikes isn't ideal at the time, you should generally use this move, because it'll hit almost all switch-ins very hard. Sludge Wave complements Draco Meteor, as it hits Fairy-types super effectively. Additionally, Dragalge is neutral to Fairy-type moves, and thus can switch in on many Fairy-types and destroy them with Sludge Wave. Focus Blast covers the Steel-types that Dragalge's STAB moves cannot, such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp. However, Hidden Power Fire can be used if you'd prefer having better accuracy and the ability to hit Mega Scizor and don't mind not being able to handle Heatran. Toxic Spikes spreads the poisoned or badly poisoned status to all grounded foes, which greatly benefits your team by inhibiting opposing setup Pokemon, including Unaware Clefable and Substitute Keldeo.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>28 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Hippowdon, which would otherwise 2HKO with Earthquake. Maximum Special Attack EVs are used so that Dragalge can hit as hard as possible, and the rest of the EVs are put in HP so that Dragalge has good mixed bulk. 140 Speed EVs, at the expense of HP, can be used if you need Dragalge to outspeed Clefable, hitting it with a powerful Sludge Wave before it can use Calm Mind, or Tyranitar, so that Dragalge can hit it with Focus Blast. If Dragalge is using Hidden Power Fire, Tyranitar isn't necessary to outspeed, so only 136 Speed EVs would be needed. Draco Plate is typically the item of choice, as it boosts the power of Dragalge's most-used move, Draco Meteor, by 1.2 without causing recoil. However, if this extra damage is not needed, Black Sludge also is a great choice, as it gives Dragalge the passive recovery needed to switch into Pokemon less riskily.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Dragalge's amazing defensive typing to switch into numerous Pokemon, including Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, Clefable, Manaphy, Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, Magnezone, Thundurus, and Mega Venusaur. Once in, Dragalge can either use its offensive or defensive advantage to set up Toxic Spikes, which greatly hurts your opponent's grounded setup sweepers' chances of setting up, or fire off powerful moves. Draco Meteor, especially when boosted by Draco Plate, is immensely powerful, and it lets Dragalge do as much damage as possible to threats such as Raikou, Keldeo, Mew, and Rotom-W. However, Sludge Wave is more consistent and should be used both when the Draco Meteor's Special Attack cut is unappealing and in order to stop a Clefable sweep. Basically, your mentality when using Dragalge should be to decide when it's right to attack and when it's right to set up Toxic Spikes. Be wary of using Toxic Spikes when you know Dragalge won't be able to get up a second layer, as that could result in having many foes being poisoned instead of badly poisoned, which isn't ideal because the goal is to wear them down rather than apply more short-term chip damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Magnezone can trap Steel-types such as Jirachi, which are very troublesome for Dragalge to face, even considering its access to Focus Blast. Grounded Poison-types, such as Amoonguss and Tentacruel, remove Dragalge's Toxic Spikes, so Reuniclus, which can set up on them, and Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Mega Alakazam, which can revenge kill them, make for good teammates. Physical wallbreakers such as Victini and Heracross can also prove to be spectacular teammates for their ability to demolish Chansey. Because Psychic-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Latios can easily revenge kill Dragalge, a Pursuit trapper such as Tyranitar can make for a great teammate. Mega Metagross can also be a great teammate because it can check many of these bulky Psychic-types, including Gardevoir and Latios.</p> <p>Ferrothorn can prove to be a spectacular teammate, as it resists or can usually switch in on the Dragon-, Ice-, and Ground-types moves Dragalge is weak to, while Dragalge can switch into the Fire- and Fighting- type moves Ferrothorn is weak to. Add this to Ferrothorn's access to Spikes and Stealth Rock, and the two can make a great entry hazard-setting defensive pair for balanced and bulky offensive teams. Dragalge is prone to being revenge killed by Ground-types, such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Landorus, so to remedy this weakness, Rotom-W, Mandibuzz, and Manaphy can serve as great teammates. Teams that this Dragalge variant is a part of often rely, to a varying degree, on Toxic Spikes to function. If these entry hazards get Defogged or spun away, the team loses a substantial part of its wincon. Bisharp can add offensive pressure in an effort to prevent Defog, and it also boasts a fair matchup against two premier Defoggers, Latios and Latias, while Ghost-types such as Mega Sableye can act as Rapid Spin blockers.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Despite not running Special Attack EVs, Dragalge still can hit very hard with Draco Meteor, which has great neutral coverage and OHKOes Gengar after considering Stealth Rock or Life Orb damage. Dragon Pulse is another viable option, which is substantially weaker but doesn't force Dragalge out after its use. It relegates Sludge Wave as Dragalge's most powerful move, if chosen over Draco Meteor, and therefore Dragon Pulse should only be used against Dragon- and Ground-types on the switch, as well as on Gengar. Be wary that unlike Draco Meteor, Dragon Pulse can never OHKO Gengar. However, Dragon Pulse performs better against Substitute variants of Gengar and is overall more consistent than Draco Meteor. Sludge Wave is a complementary STAB move to Dragalge's Dragon-type STAB move of choice, as it hits Fairy-types such as Clefable. The move is also useful for stinging Grass-types such as Celebi and Serperior much more than Draco Meteor. Scald hits Steel-types, which resist or are immune to Dragalge's STAB moves, neutrally and has a very useful burn chance, which can allow Dragalge to stay in relatively comfortably on physical attackers that would otherwise force it out. It's also a good move to use on a predicted switch, as almost nothing can switch into Scald without risking a burn. Toxic Spikes spreads the poisoned or badly poisoned status to all grounded foes and is especially useful for stopping setup sweepers such as Quiver Dance Volcarona, Calm Mind Keldeo, and Calm Mind Unaware Clefable.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>28 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Hippowdon, which would otherwise outspeed and 2HKO with Earthquake. 248 EVs are put in HP for maximum mixed walling potential, and the rest are put in Special Defense, as Dragalge should opt to specialize in walling specially based Pokemon. Black Sludge is used for constant recovery, which ameliorates Dragalge's chances of countering Pokemon such as Gengar when factoring in Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Despite its low HP, Dragalge is remarkably specially bulky, and you should exploit this by switching into Pokemon Dragalge's typing can handle. Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, Clefable, Manaphy, Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, Magnezone, Thundurus, and Mega Venusaur are all examples of Pokemon that Dragalge easily can switch into. Additionally, with the added bulk, Dragalge becomes a safe (but not foolproof) counter to Life Orb Gengar, which is remarkably hard to check. The name of the game with defensive Dragalge is getting into something that it can handle. If it hard walls the foe (in the case of Mega Venusaur, for example), Dragalge should set up Toxic Spikes in order to cripple the opponent's team, and if it can't completely counter the foe but can do immense damage (such as with Gengar and Draco Meteor), Dragalge should go for the KO. However, in most scenarios, your primary goal with Dragalge shouldn't be to attack, as Toxic Spikes will often prove to be more essential as your team's win condition.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Opposing Poison-types remove Toxic Spikes, so useful teammates include Reuniclus to set up on them and Landorus-T as well as Life Orb Alakazam to revenge kill them. Strong physical wallbreakers such as Mega Heracross and Victini as well as utility Mega Sableye with Taunt and Knock Off can also deal with Chansey. Mega Sableye doubles as a way to protect Dragalge's Toxic Spikes from being spun away, and the same can be said for Bisharp and the entry hazards being Defogged away. Because of their defensive synergy and entry hazard coverage, Dragalge and Ferrothorn make for great teammates on defensive teams. Dragalge is prone to being revenge killed by Ground-types such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Landorus, so to aid this problem, Rotom-W, Mandibuzz, and Manaphy can serve as great teammates. Psychic-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Latios can easily revenge kill Dragalge. A Pursuit trapper such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar can thus make for a great teammate. Mega Metagross can also check many bulky Psychic-types, including Gardevoir and Latios.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is the move Dragalge will be using the vast majority of the time. Thanks to the move's massive 130 Base Power, Adaptability boost, and Choice Specs boost, it is able to do a massive amount of damage to anything but Fairy-types, Chansey, and Blissey. It's able to OHKO frailer Steel-types such as Bisharp as well as 252 / 0 Mew after Stealth Rock damage. Fairy-types, the absolute best switch-ins to Draco Meteor, are, barring Klefki, annihilated by Dragalge's secondary STAB move, Sludge Wave. Sludge Wave also gives Dragalge a much more reliable STAB move with which it can hit both Grass-types and neutral targets hard without having to suffer from Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop. Focus Blast allows Dragalge to hit common Steel-type switch-ins, such as Ferrothorn, Bisharp, and Heatran as well as Tyranitar. However, if you don't mind being worse off against Heatran, and would much rather have better accuracy and the ability to demolish Mega Scizor, Hidden Power Fire can be used in lieu of Focus Blast. Scald lets Dragalge check Heatran, mostly if Dragalge isn't running Focus Blast. Scald doubles as a move with almost no drawbacks, and it can be used early-game to fish for a burn on some of Dragalge's most common switch-ins, such as Klefki, Jirachi, and Mega Metagross.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>In order to outspeed Hippowdon, which would otherwise cripple Dragalge with Earthquake, it's recommended for Dragalge to run 28 Speed EVs. Because Dragalge is a specially based wallbreaker, maximum Special Attack EVs are used. Likewise, Choice Specs is the recommended item for the set, as it is capable of boosting all of Dragalge's moves to their highest possible power. The remaining EVs are thrown into HP because Dragalge enjoys having mixed bulk. 140 Speed EVs, at expense of HP, can be used if you desire Dragalge to outspeed Calm Mind Clefable and Tyranitar so that Dragalge can hit them with Sludge Wave or Focus Blast, respectively. If Dragalge is using Hidden Power Fire, only 136 Speed EVs would be needed, as outspeeding Tyranitar wouldn't be a priority.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Dragalge has excellent special bulk, respectable physical bulk, and a unique defensive typing; exploit all of these characteristics! Dragalge can easily pivot into many threatening Pokemon in OU, including Keldeo, Mega Charizard Y, Rotom-W, Mega Manectric, Raikou, Clefable, and Thundurus; tank a hit; and proceed to fire off a ridiculously powerful move on whatever decides to switch in. The majority of the time, the only button you'll be clicking is Draco Meteor, but if the opponent has bulky Steel- or Fairy-types, more prediction will be necessary. Don't be too shy about using Sludge Wave; despite its lower power compared to Draco Meteor, it still can accomplish absurd feats such as OHKOing Keldeo after factoring in Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Despite Dragalge's access to Focus Blast, Hidden Power Fire, and Scald, it is still going to have immense troubles with Steel-types. Magnezone is an excellent partner for its trapping ability. Dragalge's low Speed and four common weaknesses also leave it prone to being revenge killed. For instance, Psychic-types, such as Mega Gardevoir and Latios, can easily KO Dragalge after Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop. A Pursuit trapper, such as Tyranitar, is thus a useful teammate. Mega Metagross also makes for a great teammate because of its ability to check both Mega Gardevoir and Latios. Finally, Dragalge is prone to being revenge killed by Excadrill; to remedy this weakness, Rotom-W and Celebi can serve as great teammates.</p> <p>Trick Room staples such as Bronzong, Cresselia, Porygon2, and Crawdaunt can make for good teammates as well, as Dragalge's terrible Speed stat, while normally a huge flaw, can allow it to sweep under Trick Room. Defensive cores are also plausible, as Dragalge, even without any Special Defense investment, has solid bulk and a great typing. Skarmory resists all of Dragalge's weaknesses except Ice, while Dragalge resists both of Skarmory's weaknesses. Needless to say, these two work really well together, with Dragalge able to deal out serious damage and act as a generic check to special attackers and Skarmory acting as a mixed wall capable of setting and removing entry hazards. Unaware Clefable also can make for a good teammate, as it can heal off any damage Dragalge might take with Wish. It also can serve as a lure for Poison-type moves, which gives Dragalge opportunities to switch in, and heal off any burns Dragalge might have taken with Heal Bell. Other Fairy-types, including Azumarill, Gardevoir, and Sylveon, can similarly lure in Poison-types for Dragalge to switch into. Mega Gyarados also can make for a good teammate; Dragalge can KO Keldeo, Dragon-types, Azumarill, Chesnaught, and Ferrothorn for Mega Gyarados, while Mega Gyarados can set up on Ground-types and Heatran, both of which give Dragalge trouble. Mega Diancie also makes for a good teammate, as it and Dragalge have a lot of checks in common and therefore can break down the other Pokemon's answers. Dragalge baits in and wears down Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, which opens up the opportunity to sweep for Diancie. In turn, Diancie can take on Jirachi and Heatran better than Dragalge can thanks to its access to Earth Power.</p> "

Notably, Prankster Thunder Wave allows Klefki to act as a catch-all stop to most setup sweepers. Klefki has access to Magnet Rise, which gives it the ability to avoid Ground-type attacks for five turns, which alleviates one of its only two weaknesses.

Thunder Wave cripples offensive Pokemon and halts setup sweepers such as Mega Pinsir and Mega Gyarados. Magnet Rise allows Klefki to avoid Ground-type attacks from Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Excadrill, and Landorus-T. Toxic is an alternate choice to hit Ground- and Electric-types, which are immune to Thunder Wave, such as Hippowdon, Thundurus, and Raikou. Play Rough ensures that Klefki is not completely shut down by Taunt, and it has good neutral coverage overall. Foul Play hits Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Jirachi, Excadrill, and non-Mega Gyarados.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Full HP investment is used to maximize Klefki's solid bulk, and a Careful nature and the Special Defense investment allows it to better take hits from the likes of Starmie, Keldeo, Thundurus, Gengar, and Mega Gardevoir. A Calm nature should be used with Foul Play, as preserving Klefki's Attack stat is not needed with Foul Play. Alternatively, a physically defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD and a Bold nature can be used to handle threats such as Weavile, Dragon Dance Mega Altaria, Mega Lopunny, and Azumarill. Leftovers provide passive recovery, while a Sitrus Berry gives Klefki immediate recovery when it reaches low HP, giving it more opportunities to set up layers of Spikes. Prankster gives priority to all of Klefki's status moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Klefki should pivot into resisted or immune attacks from Pokemon such as Latios, Weavile, Mega Altaria, and Gengar.

Magnet Rise should be used versus Ground-types such as Mamoswine and Landorus-T to avoid their attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Klefki is a great team supporter and fairly self-sufficient Pokemon, although there are many offensive Pokemon that appreciate its support. Pokemon whose checks and counters are grounded Pokemon, and are thus worn down by Klefki's Spikes, such as Mega Sharpedo, Mega Gyarados, and Scizor make for good teammates. Pokemon with Defiant such as Thundurus or Bisharp deter the use of Defog to clear Klefki's Spikes, but are not always necessary due to how Klefki puts immense pressure on the two most common Defog users, Latios and Latias.

  "Diancie": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Diancie is one of OverUsed's most dangerous Mega Evolutions courtesy of its unique typing, efficient coverage, and critical Speed tier. With its high offensive stats and powerful STAB moves, Mega Diancie can threaten both physical and special walls effectively. Additional coverage in the form of Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire lets it handle many of the common Pokemon that can stomach its STAB attacks. Defensively, Diancie's typing grants it resistances to Fire, Flying, and Dark as well as an immunity to Dragon, letting it check non-Earthquake Mega Charizard X and Dragonite and take crucial attacks such as Talonflame and Volcarona's boosted STAB moves, Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack, and Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Mega Diancie's Speed is one of its most important traits, letting it get the jump on threatening Pokemon that hover on and around the crowded base 100 Speed tier, such as Garchomp, Manaphy, Keldeo, and unboosted Volcarona, as well as Speed tie with Latios and Latias. Magic Bounce allows Mega Diancie to deny entry hazards with proper prediction and shield itself from status moves such as Heatran's Toxic and Taunt, Clefable's Thunder Wave, and Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp. However, Mega Diancie is burdened with mediocre bulk, and its typing gives it weaknesses to common Water-, Steel-, Grass-, and Ground-type moves, making revenge killers such as Serperior, Weavile, Mega Lopunny, Mega Scizor, and Mega Metagross adept at picking it off. Additionally, Mega Diancie's lack of reliable recovery means it struggles to take strong repeated hits from Pokemon it wants to check, particularly Tornadus-T. Diancie's low Speed before Mega Evolving is also a concern, forcing it to run Protect and forfeit valuable coverage or utility options in order to render its Speed usable the next turn.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Ice lets Mega Diancie blitz through Landorus-T after Stealth Rock and deal huge damage to Gliscor, which otherwise is able to stall out Moonblasts with Roost. However, Hidden Power Ice is best used alongside Protect due to increased emphasis on scouting Landorus-T's set and greatly increases Diancie's reliance on teammates like Volcarona and Magnezone to handle Steel-types. Calm Mind can let Mega Diancie overwhelm checks such as Clefable and Alomomola and soak up hits from faster Pokemon such as Latios and Thundurus. Unfortunately, this is an extremely niche option because it comes at the cost of Protect, making Diancie painfully easy to revenge kill, and the loss of Diamond Storm makes it far more difficult to break special walls and check key Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y. In addition, Calm Mind Mega Diancie can still struggle in one-on-one situations with checks that can offensively pressure it such as Gliscor, Chansey, Jirachi, and Amoonguss. Rock Polish gives Mega Diancie the potential to sweep weakened offensive teams on paper, but this is also a subpar option, as it fails to help it against defensive checks and still leaves Diancie completely vulnerable to Bullet Punch and Aqua Jet users. In addition, like Calm Mind, it occupies a valuable moveslot in which Diancie would prefer to carry an important coverage or utility option. Though it can be similarly difficult to fit, Heal Bell lets Diancie offer more team support by acting as a cleric, ridding its teammates of burns from the Scalds that they may have switched into for Diancie.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon and Coverage: Mega Metagross outspeeds Hidden Power Fire Mega Diancie, can take an Earth Power, and OHKOes Diancie with a Steel-type STAB move. Jirachi can also take a hit and strike back with Iron Head. Skarmory and Mega Scizor switch into Mega Diancie lacking Hidden Power Fire, and the latter OHKOes it with Bullet Punch. Ferrothorn can take a STAB move followed by Hidden Power Fire from full health and OHKO Diancie back with Gyro Ball. Magnezone survives any one hit from Diancie barring Earth Power and dispatches it with Flash Cannon. While it is OHKOed by Moonblast, Mega Medicham is known to run Bullet Punch to OHKO Mega Diancie before it can strike back, so tread carefully when facing it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Gastrodon and Jellicent check Mega Diancie decently well if they are healthy, recovering off Moonblasts and dealing huge damage back with Earthquake and Scald. Suicune survives any two hits after Stealth Rock and as such makes for a decent check, but its lack of reliable recovery is a concern. Though they also crumble to repeated blows, Rotom-W and Manaphy each can take a hit and KO Mega Diancie in return. Azumarill and Crawdaunt can revenge kill Mega Diancie with Choice Band-boosted Aqua Jet after some prior damage, but only the former is able to endure a Moonblast. Slowbro can force damage on Mega Diancie in a pinch, but it struggles greatly to take Moonblast. Slowking does not have this problem due to its higher special bulk, making it an excellent check.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth switch into Mega Diancie reliably and threaten it with their Grass-type STAB moves, and they can do so multiple times over the course of the game thanks to Regenerator. Mega Venusaur is an even stronger counter, taking all of Mega Diancie's common moves with ease and healing any damage taken with Synthesis.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Chansey is extremely difficult for Mega Diancie to overcome, as it can take Mega Diancie's hits quite easily with Eviolite intact and 3HKO in return with Seismic Toss. Specially defensive Gliscor can stall out Moonblast with Roost and threaten major damage with Earthquake, but Moonblast can 2HKO it with Stealth Rock up and Hidden Power Ice will nearly OHKO it. Specially defensive Hippowdon and Alomomola can take two hits unless Spikes are up, but Hippowdon must be cautious of Magic Bounce returning its Toxic or Whirlwind, and Alomomola does little damage back with its weak Scald. Specially defensive Excadrill is an especially notable check, surviving a Moonblast followed by an Earth Power and OHKOing Diancie back or setting up Stealth Rock thanks to Mold Breaker.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Serperior and Starmie are excellent offensive checks that force Mega Diancie out. The former can then take the opportunity to set up with Substitute or Leaf Storm, while the latter can heal or fire off a Scald. Weavile, Life Orb Thundurus, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Alakazam also outspeed and deal huge damage to Mega Diancie, but none of them can OHKO Mega Diancie without prior damage, and it can OHKO all of them in return. Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T are able to revenge kill Mega Diancie, but Mega Diancie can scout their chosen move with Protect and act accordingly.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Protect lets Diancie Mega Evolve safely and circumvent its low Speed before Mega Evolution. Protect also serves a number of other purposes, helping Diancie effectively scout Choice item users such as Azumarill, Landorus-T, and Weavile, discerning whether Mega Medicham carries Bullet Punch, and forcing mind games with Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick. Moonblast is Mega Diancie's strongest and most reliable STAB move, hitting most neutral targets very hard. Diamond Storm helps Mega Diancie act as a mixed attacker, dishing out respectable damage to specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey and Slowking while destroying key Fire- and Flying-types such as Tornadus-T, Volcarona, and Charizard. The Defense boost it often provides is also notable, potentially coming into play against revenge killers such as Crawdaunt and Weavile. Earth Power is Mega Diancie's best coverage option to threaten important Steel-types, most importantly securing the 2HKO on any variant of Excadrill and Mega Metagross while obliterating Heatran, Magnezone, and Bisharp. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire can 2HKO Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. However, using the latter lowers Mega Diancie's Speed IV, forfeiting the Speed tie against threats such as Latios, Mega Metagross, and the odd Gengar. Stealth Rock can be used in place of Diamond Storm or a coverage option if the team lacks another setter, as Mega Diancie is an effective user of the move due to the number of switches it forces. It is especially noteworthy for being able to keep Stealth Rock up versus stall thanks to its strong matchup against Zapdos, the most common form of entry hazard control on the archetype.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Naive nature is preferred over Hasty, letting Mega Diancie better check Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Charizard X while always surviving Gliscor's unboosted Earthquake at full HP and Bisharp's +2 Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock. It is also worth noting that even with a Naive nature, Mega Diancie can survive two uninvested Moonblasts from Clefable as well as take a +1 Giga Drain from Volcarona before Mega Evolving. However, if Stealth Rock is chosen over Diamond Storm, Diancie should instead run a Timid nature to preserve its bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In many matchups, players should lead off with Diancie and Mega Evolve safely with Protect to reap the benefits of Mega Diancie's Speed and Magic Bounce. However, choosing to abstain from leading with and immediately Mega Evolving Diancie can be beneficial depending on the circumstance. For example, it may be wise not to lead with Diancie if your team dislikes switching into Scald and the opponent can anti-lead it with a bulky Water-type or if the opponent has a Mold Breaker Excadrill, which can set Stealth Rock freely on Mega Diancie in spite of Magic Bounce. Also, if Diancie is not immediately Mega Evolved, it can act as a better initial pivot into certain Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Hydreigon due to its regular forme's higher bulk. At later stages in the game, Mega Diancie should be used to soften up defensive cores by firing off powerful attacks. Diancie is best brought in with partners that can pivot into it with U-turn or Volt Switch due to its mediocre bulk, and its health should be preserved if it is needed as a revenge killer or emergency check to a threat such as Bisharp or Dragonite. If this is not the case, Mega Diancie can find additional wallbreaking opportunities by switching directly into Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Talonflame that can do little to threaten it. Do not shy away from utilizing Protect often; aside from scouting the moves of Choice item users, it can be used to learn valuable information about the opponent's moveset. For example, Mega Diancie should use Protect against Mega Medicham to see if it carries Bullet Punch and against Latios to check for Surf.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Diancie finds itself at home on bulky offensive builds that can effectively make use of its Speed, defensive utility, Magic Bounce, and most importantly, its incredible firepower. Fire-types such as Volcarona, Talonflame, and Volcanion can deal with its Steel-type checks and enjoy Mega Diancie warding off Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce. The former two especially appreciate its ability to keep Tyranitar at bay, weaken bulky Water-types, and threaten Heatran with Earth Power. Other Pokemon that are hindered by Stealth Rock and can clean up after Mega Diancie softens up teams, such as Dragonite and Weavile, also appreciate said traits. Magnezone is an excellent teammate if Diancie opts not to use Hidden Power Fire, as it frees up Mega Diancie offensively by trapping and eliminating Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor for it and pivots it in with Volt Switch. It should be noted that Mega Diancie loses to common Stealth Rock setters such as Excadrill, Chansey, and Ferrothorn, making it an unreliable means of entry hazard control. As such, bulky Excadrill is one of Mega Diancie's most common and effective partners, providing vital Rapid Spin support to take the pressure off of Mega Diancie to keep hazards away while preserving the hazards the latter sends back with Magic Bounce. Excadrill also takes care of Magnezone, Clefable, and Jirachi and can cripple bulky Water-types with Toxic while appreciating Mega Diancie's ability to pressure Skarmory and Tornadus-T. Starmie is another good spinner to pair with Diancie, as it can pivot into Scald from bulky Water-types, provide Thunder Wave support, and check Steel- and Ground-types such as Mega Metagross and bulky Excadrill for it. In return, Mega Diancie offensively checks Dark-types such as Bisharp and Tyranitar that give Starmie grief. Both of these spinners are highly fond of Mega Diancie's unparalleled ability to force opponents to switch and pivot around it, giving them more opportunities to come in safely and click Rapid Spin.</p> <p>If Mega Diancie forgoes Stealth Rock, entry hazard setters are important teammates for it to help chip Mega Diancie's answers into range of its powerful attacks and make it near impossible to pivot around. Clefable can use Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave to support Mega Diancie or carry Ice Beam or Flamethrower to deal with Gliscor and Ferrothorn for it. Ferrothorn checks Chansey and bulky Water-types and can set up Spikes as well as Stealth Rock. Lastly, pivots that bring Mega Diancie in and soak up the hits aimed at it are great partners. Tangrowth and Alomomola handle threats such as Mega Metagross and Mega Lopunny for Mega Diancie and give it opportunities to come in safely with Sleep Powder and Wish, respectively. Rotom-W and Tornadus-T can directly pivot Mega Diancie in with Volt Switch and U-turn; the former takes on Mega Scizor and Mega Metagross for Mega Diancie, while the latter checks Serperior and other Grass-types for it.</p> "

  "Volcanion": {
    "overview": "<p>Volcanion is a strong Pokemon in OU because it has a fantastic offensive typing that cements its status as a powerhouse and notably allows it to check Pokemon like Azumarill, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Volcanion synergizes fantastically with a lot of Pokemon like Fairy-, Grass-, and Dragon-types, as well as offensive Steel-types, due to its ability to threaten most opposing Steel-types. Its signature STAB attack, Steam Eruption, is one of its main selling points, having the same power as Hydro Pump but also the burn chance of Scald to pressure switch-ins. Its good movepool allows it to hit most of the metagame for at least neutral damage, and its STAB combination is already naturally difficult to deal with because Grass-type answers to its Water STAB cannot deal with its Fire attacks. Its ability, Water Absorb, is another reason it is so good, since it discourages opponents from spamming Scald. Notably, Volcanion is also a very good switch-in to Azumarill, which is a difficult Pokemon to switch into. Unfortunately, Volcanion is a bit on the slower side, and this coupled with a weakness to Stealth Rock means that its longevity is not the greatest despite a good Defense stat. It is also weak to common Ground-, Electric-, and Rock-type moves.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Type resistance Berries like Shuca Berry and Charti Berry can be used on offensive Volcanion to let it function as a lure, but ultimately this is very team dependent. Volcanion can utilize a defensive set with a spread of 232 HP / 176 Def / 4 SpD / 96 Spe with a Bold nature. This outspeeds all Adamant Azumarill while netting an extra point in Defense and avoiding a 4HKO from Stealth Rock. Such a set can run Haze to beat setup sweepers such as the aforementioned Azumarill. Unfortunately, a Stealth Rock weakness and lack of reliable recovery mean it is hard to utilize its defensive utility properly. RestTalk sets are also an option, as they alleviate the lack of recovery, but ultimately they are unreliable. Expert Belt can be used to bluff a Choice set but retain the ability to switch moves. Power Herb + Solar Beam is a niche set but can be a nice lure for bulky Water-types, which are common switch-ins to Volcanion.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Gastrodon and Seismitoad are both immune to Steam Eruption and can comfortably take on any of Volcanion's other attacks except for Hidden Power Grass or Toxic. Volcanion can also check itself due to its immunity to its own Water attacks and a 4x resistance to Fire-type moves, but it does not take Earth Power or Sludge Bomb very well. Slowking, Alomomola, and Suicune have the bulk to take Choice Specs Steam Eruption and can PP stall it as well. Slowbro can take on Volcanion to some extent as well, but because it does not have as much Special Defense as Slowking, it is a much shakier check. Rotom-W is not a great check to Volcanion because Choice Specs-boosted Steam Eruption often 2HKOes, but at full HP Rotom-W does threaten Volcanion with a super effective Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Walls: Chansey is one of the best Volcanion switch-ins since it can take any Choice Specs-boosted attacks and doesn't care much about the rare Toxic. Blissey is in the same boat. Mega Latias is a good switch-in to Volcanion, since it can take most of its attacks comfortably, heal up, and then threaten it with STAB or coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragons like Latias and Latios are some of the most popular switch-ins to Volcanion because they resist its STAB combination and aren't hit super effectively by its coverage moves. They also outspeed Volcanion and can threaten it with their STAB moves, but they are susceptible to Pursuit trapping, which is often found with Volcanion. Dragonite is a decent check to Volcanion especially with Multiscale intact, and it often carries a Lum Berry to guard it against burns. Kyurem-B is an offensive check to Volcanion, as it does not appreciate switching into Choice Specs-boosted Fire-type moves or taking burns from Steam Eruption, but in a one-on-one scenario it can outspeed Volcanion and hit it super effectively with Fusion Bolt.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Offensive Rock-types such as Mega Diancie, Terrakion, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Mega Aerodactyl can all outspeed and check Volcanion.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Offensive Electric-types such as Thundurus, Mega Manectric, and Raikou all outspeed Volcanion and threaten it with STAB Thunderbolt or Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Offensive Ground-types such as Garchomp, Excadrill, fast Landorus-T, and Diggersby can all OHKO Volcanion with Earthquake but won't dare switch into it.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Steam Eruption is Volcanion's primary STAB move due to its high Base Power, ability to burn, and general lack of drawbacks with its high accuracy. Flamethrower is the secondary STAB option and nukes anything weak to it. Fire Blast is an option for additional power, but it can miss and most of its targets don't appreciate Flamethrower anyway. If you're running a non-Choice Specs set, Fire Blast is preferable for power. Sludge Bomb is coverage for Fairy-types like Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Altaria. It is used over Sludge Wave for its higher chance to inflict poison and still guarantees the OHKO on Azumarill. Hidden Power Grass allows Volcanion to hit other Water-types super effectively, especially Water Absorb Pokemon like Gastrodon. Earth Power is an alternative that can hit opposing Volcanion and eases prediction against cores like Volcanion + Tyranitar. Overheat is an option on Choice Specs sets to provide more destructive power, and you will often switch Volcanion out after firing off one or two attacks regardless of a Special Attack drop. Toxic can be used on Leftovers or Mystic Water variants to lure bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Gastrodon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Modest nature with maximum Special Attack maximizes Volcanion's wallbreaking prowess. Maximum Speed allows Volcanion to Speed tie Breloom so that it isn't as susceptible to Spore. It's also useful for outspeeding most defensive Landorus-T. A Timid nature is an option to get the jump on Adamant offensive Mega Scizor, Adamant Breloom, and Gliscor. Choice Specs is the best item for this set, since it turns Volcanion into a ridiculous wallbreaker capable of 2HKOing Pokemon that resist its attacks such as Latios and 2HKOing Rotom-W after Stealth Rock. Leftovers is also a nice option on this set to maintain longevity, and Volcanion's nice typing lets it heal against Steel-types pretty well. While Volcanion still retains power with Leftovers, you do lose the ability to bluff Choice Specs. Mystic Water is another option which can be used to bluff a Choice Specs set and take advantage of people trying to play around Volcanion with cores like Heatran + Latias, for example. Volcanion can run bulkier spreads as well because of its good Defense stat, although generally having the extra Speed is more worthwhile.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Steam Eruption is the main move to use if the opponent isn't packing a Water-immune Pokemon like an opposing Volcanion. Its high Base Power and chance to burn put a lot of pressure on the opposing team even if they have a bulky switch-in like Latias. It is notable, though, that Steam Eruption has low PP, so spamming it too much early-game can have an adverse effect on late-game plans. Flamethrower should be used when up against Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Metagross, as well as against Grass-types like Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur. Sludge Bomb can be used for Fairy-types primarily, although it also hits Water- and Dragon-types a little harder than the resisted Steam Eruption. Hidden Power Grass should be used on predicted switches to break Water / Ground types, and Earth Power should be used similarly for opposing Volcanion switch-ins. These moves are primarily for when the opponent has a Water-immune Pokemon. Volcanion can switch into predicted Water-type moves like Scald as well as Fire- and Steel-type moves, which it 4x resists. It is a good idea to figure out how fast opposing Ground- and Rock-types are before staying in with Volcanion against them, since being outsped can result in it being KOed. Double switches and VoltTurn are great ways to bring Volcanion into play, since it is rather slow and does not like switching into repeated hits. If you're using Choice Specs over Leftovers, there's a heavy emphasis on prediction if the opponent has Water Absorb users. Be careful about switching into Pokemon like Scizor and Jirachi if Stealth Rock is up—they may U-turn out, and the entry hazard damage will rack up quickly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar is an excellent partner because it Pursuit traps many of Volcanion's best checks such as Latias, Mega Latias, and Slowbro. In return, Volcanion threatens Steel-types and some bulky Ground-types for Tyranitar. Latios and Latias are good partners because they provide entry hazard removal for Volcanion, as well as soft checking Electric-types. They also appreciate that Volcanion takes advantage of Steel-types and of Tyranitar locked into Pursuit. Landorus-T is a good partner because it provides Stealth Rock and U-turn support and checks many of the quicker Ground-types that can threaten Volcanion with STAB Earthquake. Garchomp is another nice hazard setter to pair with Volcanion, but it is better as a speedy wallbreaker with the ability to bust past bulky Water-types by utilizing a Swords Dance set. Grass-types like Breloom, Serperior, and Tangrowth are excellent with Volcanion because they can break past or check bulky Water-types, which wall it. They also threaten faster Ground-types; Breloom and Tangrowth in particular are good at this. Mega Sceptile can act as a check to Electric-types as well. Mega Diancie sports strong offensive synergy with Volcanion, which appreciates Magic Bounce to fend off Stealth Rock and Diancie's ability to check Latios, Terrakion, and Tyranitar. Volcanion destroys Steel-types that check Mega Diancie and deters the likes of Choice Scarf Keldeo, Azumarill, and Crawdaunt from trying to revenge kill Diancie with Water-type moves. Mega Scizor is a good partner to Volcanion, since it soft checks many Ground-types and hard checks Rock-types. Volcanion greatly appreciates VoltTurn support to get free switches in, so partners like Tornadus-T and Rotom-W can prove very useful. Jirachi is another good pivot to pair with Volcanion, since it lures in Heatran and Ferrothorn and can use Healing Wish to bring Volcanion back to full HP later. Keldeo can be paired with Volcanion to help wear down Water-resistant Pokemon on the opposing team.</p> "
