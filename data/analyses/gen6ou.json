    "overview": "<p>Being able to trap and secure KOes against various threats to stall such as Heatran and Choice Band Tyranitar were the main reasons Dugtrio was originally OU. With the banning of Arena Trap, Dugtrio is left in a rather unfortunate situation where it was OU by usage but is by no means a viable OU Pokemon. It is outclassed by other Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Excadrill that have options to boost their Attack or Speed with greater efficiency than Dugtrio. While Dugtrio also sports utility moves such as Memento and Stealth Rock, it is severely outdone by Landorus-T as a suicide lead most of the time. Under no circumstances should you use Dugtrio over any other Pokemon in a serious team.</p>",
    "sets": {"Mole Man": {"description": "<p>Putting it bluntly, this set is really bad and there aren't many better options for Dugtrio. Stealth Rock, Memento, and Dugtrio's higher Speed give it a smaller niche over a suicide lead such as Uxie to lay Stealth Rock and prevent Defog with Memento. Earthquake is mainly there because it's a STAB option for Dugtrio. Toxic can be an option to cripple Hippowdon and Landorus-T, while Stone Edge catches Flying-type Pokemon such as Zapdos and Mega Charizard Y.</p>"}},

  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gengar returns for another bout in OU, still undisputed as one of the only Pokemon to consistently remain in the tier across all generations. It resists Fairy and can hit Fairy-types hard with its super effective Poison STAB moves, which makes it a very effective offensive answer to the likes of Mega Altaria, Mega Gardevoir, and Clefable, and the Steel-type losing its Ghost-type resistance makes it easier for Gengar to fit moves onto a set and harder to switch into it. Sadly, the presence of priority users, Assault Vest users, and powerful Mega Evolutions leaves Gengar struggling to keep up. However, Gengar's typing, ability, and support movepool let it act as a powerful stallbreaker, and its offensive stats and very good Speed tier don't let it down against offensive teams. A number of other traits, such as acting as a spinblocker and an effective Destiny Bond user, makes Gengar a rather consistent, yet still unpredictable choice for many teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gengar has a couple of other coverage options that can beat some specific Pokemon, such as Energy Ball and Psychic, but these moves have limited application compared to the versatility and strength of Gengar's normal options. Destiny Bond can be used in order to better deal with offensive threats. A Choice Specs set using Gengar's coverage and the lack of resistances to Ghost-type moves may seem appealing, but it requires a lot of support to function. Gengar can also beat pretty much every counter with coverage or Trick, and the power granted by Choice Specs makes it very hard to switch into, but overall, it is inefficient compared to the other sets. A Choice Scarf set can be used to capitalize on Gengar's immunity to Normal-type moves to reliably revenge kill Extreme Speed users, but these are not the biggest threats in the metagame, and it is pretty weak overall. Pain Split is an option for Substitute Gengar to recover health, affording the use of Life Orb in most situations too. It can also hassle some defensive Pokemon like Chansey or Clefable pretty well by discouraging healing, but utility Life Orb Gengar fails to be as effective against stall as Black Sludge, nor as effective as all-out Destiny Bond attacker against offense, so it's a situational middle ground. The combination of Substitute and Disable allows Gengar to cripple Pokemon with Choice items or Pokemon that rely on Sucker Punch or priority moves to handle Gengar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Utility Mega Sableye can switch into any move (barring the rare Dazzling Gleam) and OHKO with Knock Off. Specially defensive Heatran is immune to burns, takes Shadow Ball quite well, and does enough with Lava Plume to force Gengar out. However, it is narrowly 2HKOed by a Life Orb-boosted Focus Blast. Specially defensive Gliscor can switch into Gengar's STAB moves and OHKO Gengar with Knock Off, assuming previous damage. It must be wary of Icy Wind, however. Mandibuzz resists Shadow Ball, avoids the 2HKO from Sludge Wave, and can OHKO with Foul Play or Knock Off assuming prior damage. Dragalge avoids the 2HKO from Shadow Ball and can OHKO Gengar with Draco Meteor. Blissey can switch into Gengar, and unlike Chansey, threaten it by either attacking it with Thunderbolt or Ice Beam or boosting its Special Attack and Special Defense with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Users</strong>: Bisharp, Weavile, and Tyranitar are all capable of trapping Gengar with Pursuit, though Focus Blast on Gengar as well as the threat of Will-O-Wisp can be troublesome.</p> <p><strong>Assault Vest Users</strong>: Tornadus-T, Raikou, Conkeldurr, Goodra, and other Assault Vest users really ruin Gengar's day, and unless they can be neutered with Substitute + Disable, Gengar is fighting a losing battle. However, all typical Assault Vest users are crippled by a burn.</p> <p><strong>Strong Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf Garchomp, Tyranitar, Terrakion, Excadrill, and Landorus-T are all checks to a Gengar that is not behind a Substitute, as they cleanly outspeed and KO it. Tyranitar is especially troubling, as it effortlessly traps and KOes Gengar if it can get in for free.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority Moves</strong>: Scizor, Talonflame, Azumarill, and other powerful priority users have no trouble checking Gengar due to its frailty. Sucker Punch users may seem like a good check, but no Gengar set eschews a countermeasure to this move, whether it be Substitute, Destiny Bond, or Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Fast Offensive Checks</strong>: Thundurus, Starmie, Alakazam, and other Pokemon faster than Gengar can easily check it due to its poor defenses.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball is Gengar's most reliable STAB move, boasting great neutral coverage. Sludge Bomb hits Normal- and Dark-type Pokemon that are immune to or resist Shadow Ball and threatens Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Diancie. The 30% poison chance is also a helpful bonus, allowing Gengar to chip away at bulkier switch-ins such as Tornadus-T. Focus Blast provides crucial coverage against Dark- and Steel-types like Tyranitar, Heatran, and Bisharp, all of which can comfortably switch into Gengar's STAB moves. Trick lets Gengar cripple special walls like Chansey that otherwise sponge its moves with ease. By forcing them into a single move, Gengar opens up opportunities for itself or its teammates to gain momentum or set up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature and maximum Speed investment are key to outspeeding important threats like Garchomp, Keldeo, and Manaphy, and this allows Gengar to Speed tie with crucial Pokemon like Mega Metagross, Mega Diancie, and Latios. 252 Special Attack EVs maximize the power of Gengar's Choice Specs-boosted hits. The remaining 4 EVs are placed in Defense to slightly reduce damage from physical priority moves like Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Specs Gengar thrives on prediction and momentum, so it's best used as a hit-and-run wallbreaker that pressures opposing teams early- or mid-game. Shadow Ball is a safe middle ground option if you're unsure of the switch, but proper reads can allow Gengar to land a devastating Focus Blast on potential checks like Bisharp and Tyranitar. Use Trick opportunistically to cripple walls like Chansey that can otherwise sit on Gengar. Because Gengar is very frail and vulnerable to being Pursuit trapped, avoid locking it into resisted or ineffective moves if Tyranitar, Weavile, or Assault Vest Bisharp are still in play. Position Gengar with the help of VoltTurn support or double switches to bring it in safely, as it rarely survives strong neutral hits. Its offensive presence can often force switches, making it an excellent way to punish predictable patterns and wear down the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Specs Gengar pairs well with entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Garchomp, all of which can chip Gengar's usual checks and help secure KOs with repeated pressure. VoltTurn users such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T provide the momentum Gengar needs to come in safely and start breaking defensive cores. Fighting-types like Keldeo and Mega Lopunny synergize well with it too by pressuring Pursuit users and benefiting from Gengar's ability to remove or cripple Fairy- and bulky Psychic-types. Finally, teammates like Dragon Dance Mega Gyarados and Mega Tyranitar are great, as they can take advantage of Choice-locked Pursuit Weavile and Tyranitar and deter them from using the move.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball is Gengar's main STAB attack, as its neutral coverage is fantastic and it deals solid damage to most Pokemon. Sludge Wave is Gengar's secondary STAB attack, giving Gengar the ability to hit Fairy-types and Grass-types for super effective damage. Sludge Wave also hits some additional threats neutrally, such as Mandibuzz, Rotom-W, and Keldeo, and does more damage than Shadow Ball due to its higher Base Power. Focus Blast gives Gengar the ability to hit most Dark-types for super effective damage, dealing a lot of damage to or even OHKOing them. Alongside Shadow Ball it has perfect neutral coverage, and it gives Gengar a way of severely hurting more defensively-oriented Pokemon, such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Taunt is the primary choice for Gengar's last moveslot, as it stops defensively-oriented Pokemon such as Chansey and Amoonguss from healing and using status moves. It also prevents setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Gyarados from setting up. Substitute is an option over Taunt, as it allows Gengar to play around and take advantage of Sucker Punch. It also eases prediction against offensively oriented teams, which often carry Pokemon capable of switching into one or two of Gengar's attacks, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Like Taunt, it blocks status afflictions, but coupled with recoil from Life Orb, it will cause Gengar's health to go down fast. Finally, Icy Wind hits specially defensive Gliscor, a Pokemon commonly used to handle Gengar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb maximizes Gengar's damage output while maintaining the ability to switch moves. The given EV spread with a Timid nature makes Gengar's attacks deal as much damage as possible, while using its great Speed stat to its full extent. To take minimal recoil from Life Orb, running 29 HP IVs is required.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gengar can be very hard to deal with, especially for balanced and stall teams, as it often comes in for free on many staple Pokemon on stall teams. Therefore, bringing Gengar in on Clefable, Quagsire, and Gliscor and Mega Venusaur without Knock Off is advised. Against more offensive teams, Life Orb Gengar can prove to be a problem, as its unpredictability makes it hard to prepare for. Utilizing Gengar's great defensive typing and bringing it in on predicted Fighting-, Ground-, or Normal-type moves is the best way to use it against offensive teams. Many offensive threats, such as Keldeo, Terrakion, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, are often Choice-locked, meaning Gengar can fire off an attack without the fear of getting attacked in return. If running Substitute, it's advised to use it carefully, as Gengar's health goes down very quickly with the recoil from both Substitute and Life Orb.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards support is strongly advised for Gengar to have an easier time breaking down bulkier cores. Therefore, Spikes users such as Ferrothorn make good teammates. Wallbreakers that can take advantage of the switches Gengar forces against stall teams, such as Keldeo, Crawdaunt, Mega Gardevoir, and Kyurem-B, make good teammates as well, as the opponent's switch patterns often become predictable. U-turn or Volt Switch users such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Mega Manectric make good partners, as they can give Gengar a free switch into their counters, such as Gliscor and Clefable, both of which are beaten by Gengar. Pokemon that appreciate having the likes of Mega Venusaur, Clefable, and Gliscor taken out, such as Azumarill, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Mega Heracross, make great teammates, as breaking down the opposing team becomes much easier when Gengar has broken down their counters. Defensive, bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Scizor make good teammates due to their typing, as they can come in on priority attacks that threaten Gengar.</p>"
      },
      "Hex": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hex allows Gengar to deal a good amount of damage to specially defensive Gliscor without having to take Life Orb recoil. Its 130 Base Power against Pokemon with status makes up for the poor power on Pokemon without status; this can turn Gengar into an unstoppable sweeper against stall teams as well as a decent late-game cleaner if the enemy's team has been weakened by status. Will-O-Wisp is Gengar's own method of spreading status, and is good to spam early- to mid-game in order to weaken the enemy's team if Gengar can't sweep yet. It's also Gengar's best way to wear down Chansey with residual damage, as Chansey is immune to Hex. Taunt prevents walls from recovering from the residual damage Gengar spreads. Sludge Wave is a more flexible option if you prefer a coverage move over Substitute; it is especially useful against Calm Mind Clefable, as it can eat a Hex and boost to avoid the 2HKO even if it has been statused. Substitute enables Gengar to set up on switches or on Pokemon that can't touch it, such as Chansey and Diggersby. It eases prediction a lot, but it is more suited to very defensive teams that apply low amounts of pressure. The choice between Substitute and Sludge Wave depends on your team. Sludge Wave is more suited to teams leaning toward a balanced style, whereas Substitute usually works best on stall.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Gengar needs to use a Timid nature with maximum investment in Speed to Speed tie with Latios and Latias and outspeed the likes of Keldeo, Terrakion, and Mega Pinsir. Maximum investment in Special Attack provides Gengar with the highest chance to 2HKO specially defensive Gliscor, even after the Poison Heal recovery. If you decide to go with Substitute over Sludge Wave, you might want to try a bulkier spread such as 144 HP / 108 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe. The defensive investment increases Gengar's longevity significantly, which can be crucial for this set to perform well. The EVs make sure Clefable's Moonblast does not break Gengar's Substitute and allow Gengar to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Gardevoir's Hyper Voice after Black Sludge recovery. The Special Attack investment ensures that Gengar will always 2HKO Gliscor after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be careful, as Gengar is probably your main win condition against stall teams, so you have to be patient. It can be better to let a teammate faint to let Gengar set up safely instead of switching it in recklessly, given the way it threatens this team archetype. On the other hand, you will probably not have a lot of chances to bring in Gengar, so your planning must be on point to never miss an opportunity and at the same time, never overcommit with Gengar. As this set's utility is greatly reduced against more offensive teams, it is important to make good use of Gengar against these teams as well. Burning a threat at the risk of Gengar's health is usually better than saving it for an unlikely late-game sweep. Inflicting status on annoying special sponges such as Heatran and setting up entry hazards are usually the only requirements securing a good Hex sweep. Hiding the set is really important, because this set carries a surprise factor. If your opponent knows that your sweep relies on Hex, they'll try to make spreading status harder, and will be possibly less afraid of your Gengar early- to mid-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since spreading status is key, Pokemon that are able to paralyze, burn, or poison enemies are needed. In addition, teammates that can take care of Pokemon that are immune to status such as Heatran, which has great special bulk and can't be burned nor poisoned, deserve a special mention. Ferrothorn or Clefable with Thunder Wave can effectively lure Heatran and even possibly Knock Off its Leftovers. In addition, Pokemon that can use Knock Off are appreciated, given how important residual damage is for Gengar. Mew can spread status, Knock Off items, and handle faster special threats such as Latios and Latias. Gliscor makes for another great teammate because it can spread status, use Knock Off, and stall burned or poisoned Pokemon. VoltTurn partners are important in order to unlock Gengar's potential by providing it possible free switch-ins. Rotom-W and Mega Manectric are good at baiting Chansey in order to create a safe setup opportunity and gear your team toward a faster pace. Electric-types are great teammates in general because they can attract Ground-types; Gengar can take advantage of such Ground-types, especially Choice-locked Landorus-T. Knowing this, your opponent will probably not opt for that move, which gives Electric-types a clear edge during mindgames. When teambuilding with this set, you need to cover the other matchups because Gengar's usefulness will be reduced greatly if it's not maneuvering around defensive cores, especially when it has to face fast Pokemon that don't need to set up such as Talonflame and Thundurus. This set is usually present in defensive teams because they provide Gengar with teammates that are able to handle these sweepers.</p>"

      "SubSplit": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gengar has a wide support movepool and a good set of attacking moves, making it the perfect user of Substitute and Pain Split. While it has poor bulk, Gengar still manages to get a free Substitute on many occasions thanks to its good defensive typing and ability to force switches. Pain Split increases Gengar's longevity drastically, as Gengar's low base HP means it will recover lots of HP by using Pain Split on bulkier Pokemon. This makes Gengar a nuisance for stall teams, as it has an immunity to status conditions thanks to Substitute, and its typing gives it the ability to come in on commonly seen Pokemon in stall teams, such as Chansey, Mega Venusaur, Gliscor without Knock Off, and Clefable. Shadow Ball is Gengar's main STAB attack, as its neutral coverage is fantastic and deals solid damage to most Pokemon. Focus Blast rounds the set off nicely as it has perfect neutral coverage along with Shadow Ball. It also gives Gengar a way of severely hurting common switch-ins, including Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Bisharp and more defensively oriented Pokemon such as Heatran.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>When running Pain Split, Gengar can afford to have a Life Orb equipped. To take minimal recoil from Life Orb, 29 HP IVs are required. Life Orb increases Gengar's damage output a lot, making it very hard to switch into. A simple EV spread of maximum Speed and Special Attack with a Timid nature is run to make Gengar's attacks deal as much damage as possible, while using its great Speed stat to its full extent. Running an alternate EV spread of 28 HP / 148 SpA / 80 SpD / 252 Spe is also an option to prevent defensive Mega Venusaur and Clefable from breaking Gengar's Substitutes with their Giga Drains and Moonblasts, respectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gengar is a force to be reckoned with, and can be very hard to deal with, especially for balance and stall teams. It often comes in on and gets free Substitutes against many staple Pokemon on stall teams. Entry hazards support is strongly advised for Gengar to have an easier time shuffling and slowly breaking down cores. Against Pokemon that Gengar cannot really touch or that are weakened more effectively by the use of Pain Split, using Substitute until Gengar's HP is low so Pain Split drains more HP is a viable strategy which can be used for great results against bulkier teams.</p> <p>Against more offensive teams, Life Orb Gengar can prove to be a problem, as Gengar's unpredictability makes it hard to prepare for. While the utility set isn't much of a threat to offense, this set surely is, as it scores many unexpected 2HKOs with its increased damage output. Utilizing Gengar's great defensive typing and bringing it in on predicted Fighting-, Ground-, or Normal-type moves is the best way to use it against offensive teams. Many offensive threats, such as Keldeo, Terrakion, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, are often Choice-locked, meaning Gengar can set up a free Substitute and proceed to do damage to the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gengar is an amazing pick for offensive teams, as it works wonders against more defensively oriented teams. Wallbreakers such as Keldeo, Landorus, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Medicham that can take advantage of the switches Gengar forces against stall make good teammates, as the opponent's switch patterns often become predictable. Water- and Fighting-types such as Azumarill and Mega Heracross that appreciate having the likes of Mega Venusaur, Clefable, and Gliscor taken out make great teammates, as their jobs at breaking down the opposing team becomes much easier with Gengar breaking down their counters. Defensive, bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Scizor make good teammates due to their typing, as they both can come in on strong priority attacks that threaten Gengar.</p>"

  "Raikou": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting high Speed, good Special Attack, and a key Electric typing, Raikou finds a niche in the metagame as a check to top-tier threats such as Thundurus, Talonflame, and Mega Pinsir. Choice Specs Raikou can fire off very powerful attacks that are difficult to switch into. With the aid of an Assault Vest, it can check even the likes of Gengar and pivot with Volt Switch, functioning as a nice glue Pokemon for offensive teams weak to these specific threats. Raikou can also function as a devastating Calm Mind sweeper against unprepared teams and has decent coverage that makes it far from one-dimensional. Poor physical bulk, generally unimpressive power without a boost, and being easily handled by special walls hold it back significantly, but Raikou still manages to shine in a tier dominated by powerful Flying- and Electric-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zap Plate allows Raikou to bluff Choice Specs sets while giving its Electric-type moves a solid boost. Hidden Power Fire can be used to allow Raikou to 2HKO Ferrothorn, one of its most common switch-ins. Aura Sphere should not be used on Raikou, as it forces Raikou to run a Rash nature, which means it misses out on outspeeding threats such as Serperior, Thundurus, and Gengar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mamoswine, Excadrill, Hippowdon, and Quagsire are all stellar answers to Raikou, as they take a pittance from its attacks and threaten it with their STAB Ground-type attacks. Choice Scarf Garchomp and Landorus-T are 4x weak to Ice, but can outspeed and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers Neutral to Thunderbolt</strong>: Raikou's disappointing physical bulk means hard-hitting physical attackers, such as Tyranitar and Bisharp, can handle it easily.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Unaware Clefable stops Calm Mind Raikou dead in its tracks. Additionally, Sylveon, Chansey, and Mega Venusaur (if Raikou lacks Extrasensory) can handle it adequately.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards and Status</strong>: Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic, and burns severely limit Raikou's longevity and general ability to last throughout the battle.</p> <p><strong>Latios and Latias</strong>: Both aren't really threatened too much by Raikou in general besides Shadow Ball, and they're able to switch in on most of its attacks and eliminate it with a Life Orb-boosted Psyshock no matter the set.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind not only increases Raikou's firepower, enabling it to break through Pokemon that would otherwise check it such as Heatran, Mew, Jirachi, and Hippowdon, as well as clean weakened teams, but also its special bulk, preventing Pokemon like Thundurus, Clefable, and Mega Alakazam from dealing much damage to it. Thunderbolt is a powerful, reliable Electric STAB move with no drawbacks. Hidden Power Ice gives Raikou almost perfect coverage alongside Thunderbolt; specifically, it deals a huge amount of damage to Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, as well as Dragon-types such as Latios and Altaria and certain Grass-types such as Serperior. Volt Switch enables Raikou to keep offensive momentum going, which makes it far more useful early on in the battle and enables its teammates to come in for free. Volt Switch also helps Raikou wear down its checks so that it can more easily sweep late-game, as well as bluff an Assault Vest set more convincingly, especially when carrying a Zap Plate. Substitute has multiple uses, such as enabling Raikou to evade status moves from Pokemon such as Heatran, Slowbro, Ferrothorn, Rotom , and Jirachi and safely set up Calm Mind on them, helping it scout for switches (particularly from opposing Volt Switch users), and letting it evade Bisharp's Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Running maximum Speed with a Timid nature enables Raikou to fully take advantage of its great Speed tier, letting it outspeed Serperior and Speed tie with Starmie and opposing Raikou. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack for as much firepower as possible. A bulkier EV spread can be used on the Substitute set in order for Raikou to set up more easily on certain Pokemon at the expense of power; for instance, a spread of 112 HP / 144 SpA / 252 Spe guarantees that uninvested Heatran's Lava Plume will never break Raikou's Substitute after one Calm Mind boost. Leftovers gives Raikou more longevity, helps it set up Calm Mind more reliably, and enables it to set up Substitute more often (particularly against low-accuracy moves such as Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and Thundurus's Focus Blast) provided that it's running the move. However, a Zap Plate can be used when running Volt Switch in order to bluff a Choice Specs or Assault Vest set. It also gives Raikou the ability to 2HKO standard Clefable after a Calm Mind boost. Pressure is Raikou's only ability, helping it against Pokemon that rely on attacking moves with low PP such as Serperior and Overheat Mega Manectric.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Raikou should be sent in against Pokemon it can easily set up on, such as Thundurus, Rotom-W, Mega Manectric, Jirachi, and opposing Raikou. However, don't let Raikou take too much damage for it to properly set up later on. Volt Switch should be used frequently in the early- and mid- game in order to maintain offensive momentum and wear down Raikou's checks, both of which are invaluable during these stages of the battle. However, if your opponent has Hippowdon, avoid using Volt Switch because that will give it a free turn to enter the battlefield, and double switch if you feel the need to. Substitute should be used against predicted uses of Volt Switch, Sucker Punch, and status moves. After one or two Calm Mind boosts, Raikou can also use it on predicted uses of Scald and Lava Plume in order to avoid a potential burn. Against offensive teams, do not attempt to set up Calm Mind; instead, rely on either Volt Switch for generating momentum or Substitute for scouting, depending on which one Raikou carries. However, when facing more defensive teams, don't reveal Calm Mind or Substitute too early, and only use them when you are ready to sweep with Raikou and have determined your opponent's response to it. That way, you can take advantage of the opponent sending in a Pokemon like Heatran, Venusaur, Jirachi, or his own Raikou to switch into yours. In the specific cases of Heatran and Venusaur, Raikou should try to set up Calm Mind immediately as they switch in; otherwise, it may not be able to beat them. If Raikou carries Substitute, your opponent will rely less on status moves and more on offensive moves to pressure Raikou once they know it does, so you can play around that by setting up Calm Mind instead. Before setting up, make sure that slower checks such as Hippowdon and Latias have been weakened to a range where they can be KOed by +1 Hidden Power Ice. Don't set up unless faster, physically offensive revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Sand Rush Excadrill, and Mega Lopunny have been removed, as they can easily prevent a sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Calm Mind Raikou fits very well on teams that want a boosting wincon as well as an answer to Electric-types such as Thundurus, Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, and opposing Raikou. Make sure that Raikou is paired up with answers to fast, powerful physical attackers that can easily dispose of it, particularly Mega Charizard X, which easily sets up on it. This can be a bulky Ground-type such as Landorus-T or Hippowdon, as well as a Water-type such as Manaphy or Slowbro. Garchomp is particularly good in this role because it can easily wear them down; however, it does not beat Mega Charizard X and therefore needs to be paired up with a check to it. Raikou also needs to be paired up with an answer to Ground-types such as Excadrill and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Skarmory is particularly good because it can switch into Dragon- and Fairy-types, both of which can be difficult for Raikou to handle, and provide Spikes support to help Raikou break past its checks. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Grass-types such as Serperior can also handle Ground-types and benefit from Raikou's ability to break past Venusaur. Raikou appreciates support from Pokemon that can either weaken or surprise Ground-types. For instance, Jolly Mega Charizard X can weaken Hippowdon and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and in return, Raikou handles Water-types and can bait in Heatran. Mega Metagross is also a solid partner for its ability to wear down Ground-types and check Dragon- and Grass-types, while Raikou handles Steel- and Water-types in return. Because most Pokemon that can check or counter Calm Mind Raikou, such as Chansey, Clefable and Choice Scarf Ground-types, rely on their items to do so, a Knock Off user that some of these Pokemon tend to switch into, such as Alakazam, Mega Gallade, or mixed Thundurus, can serve as a good teammate to Raikou. Talonflame is an excellent partner as well because it is immune to Ground, checks Fairies, can revenge kill physical attackers, and can also weaken bulky Water-types. In return, Raikou handles Electric- and Water-types, which are very threatening for Talonflame. Both Raikou and its usual partners are vulnerable to Weavile, so make sure your team is adequately prepared to face it by carrying a check to it such as Keldeo, Mega Scizor, Azumarill, which also checks other huge threats to Raikou such as Mega Charizard X and Sand Rush Excadrill, or Klefki, which can help Raikou wear down its checks with Spikes support. If running Volt Switch, U-turn users such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Scizor also act as good partners.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt provides a strong, reliable STAB option. Volt Switch is decently powerful with a Choice Specs boost and moreover provides Raikou with a cost-free move that lets it pivot out of unfavorable matchups. Hidden Power Ice hits crucial Ground- and Dragon-types for super effective damage, especially Landorus-T, Garchomp, Gliscor, and any Hippowdon without more than the standard 140 Special Defense EVs. Shadow Ball is good for a heavier hit on Latios, taking off upwards of three-quarters of its HP, and it also takes away almost half of Excadrill's health, changing it from a safe switch-in into something that can only switch in once. Extrasensory covers Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss, which can otherwise handle this set well.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full Speed EVs with a Timid nature enable Raikou to speed tie with Starmie and other Raikou while outspeeding threats such as Serperior and Thundurus, while full SpA lets it hit as hard as possible. Thanks to Choice Specs, Raikou can hit very hard without suffering from recoil damage, which could otherwise cut away it its longevity and prevent it from outlasting its checks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Volt Switch is generally the spam move of choice, dealing moderate damage and providing a safeguard against poor matchups. Against Ground-type foes, it's typically best to hard switch into a better matchup on the predicted switch so that you don't lose momentum. Thunderbolt should be used to clean and for extra power if it is needed to obtain a KO. Like all Raikou variants, you'll want to be careful switching it in, as Raikou is prone to being worn down by entry hazards and even resisted attacks. If the foe has a Pokemon such as Thundurus, Mega Pinsir, or Talonflame, you'll want to make sure Raikou isn't brought down to such a range where they can break through it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Raikou finds itself at home on offensive teams with VoltTurn cores. Pokemon such as Mega Scizor can form such cores; Mega Scizor specifically can pressure Chansey with Knock Off and generally threaten it, which is necessary for Raikou to break through defensive teams. Defog or spin support is essential to keep it in tip-top shape to handle threats; Skarmory and Mandibuzz can handle threatening Ground-types well and fill this role. Kyurem-B, Keldeo, and Manaphy are options to take care of Ground-types, too.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is Raikou's reliable STAB; it has the highest damage output and poses a great threat to Water-types and Mega Charizard Y, which Raikou is generally supposed to check. Volt Switch gives it a safe move to pivot and wear down defensive threats with, which works especially well in conjunction with entry hazards. Hidden Power Ice is compulsory coverage to hit Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp, which otherwise completely wall Raikou. The last slot boils down to whether 2HKOing Latios (Shadow Ball) or actually threatening Mega Venusaur (Extrasensory) is preferred.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Speed with a Timid nature allow Raikou to speed tie with Starmie and other Raikou while being able to outrun threats such as Serperior and Thundurus. 252 EVs in Special Attack maximizes Raikou's damage output. An Assault Vest enables Raikou to more comfortably switch into special attackers such as Thundurus, Mega Manectric, Manaphy, Keldeo, and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be wary of switching in and out a lot with this Raikou, as it will be worn down quickly. When in doubt, unless the opponent has a bulky Ground-type to switch in, Volt Switching out is the best option unless you absolutely have to stay in and attack. This keeps the momentum of the battle in your favor. If the opponent has a bulky Ground-type to switch in, just hard switch out anticipating the play.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Skarmory and Mandibuzz that can handle Ground-types and physical attackers in general are useful teammates. Entry hazards limit this Raikou's longevity immensely due to its lack of Leftovers, so Defog or Rapid Spin support is heavily appreciated. It fits well into VoltTurn cores with Pokemon such as Scizor and Landorus-T.</p>"

  "Suicune": {
    "overview": "<p>With a great defensive typing and amazing natural bulk, Suicune acts as a solid bulky Calm Mind sweeper as well as a check to common foes like Gliscor and Heatran. Suicune's ability Pressure allows it to outlast a large range of Pokemon that could otherwise wall it, which includes Chansey, Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Clefable, as well as stall out moves with low PP like Leaf Storm from Serperior. Suicune is also able to beat other bulky Calm Mind users thanks to Pressure as well as its access to Roar. Suicune does, however, struggle to consistently take on attacks due to its lack of recovery outside of Leftovers and Rest, which leaves leaving it passive for two turns if it is lacking Sleep Talk. Suicune also lacks a large movepool, making it very predictable.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There are not many other options for Suicune to run, as they are all subpar at best. Toxic can be used to wear down bulky Water-types like Gastrodon and Rotom-W. Rest can be used with Substitute, but this doesn't leave space for moves like Sleep Talk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Thundurus can take a few Scalds from Suicune and threaten it back with Thunderbolt. Magnezone can also take Scald from Suicune and hit it back with Thunderbolt or use Volt Switch to gain momentum. However, neither can consistently switch into Scald, especially if it lands a burn. Zapdos and Rotom-W do not mind switching into Suicune and hit it super effectively, but they cannot beat it one-on-one as it sets up with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Ferrothorn resists Scald and threatens Suicune with Power Whip or Leech Seed if it lacks Substitute. Serperior can threaten Suicune with Leaf Storm and boost past its Calm Mind boosts thanks to its ability Contrary. Serperior can, however, be PP stalled out of Leaf Storm thanks to Pressure, especially if Suicune has Protect and Substitute. Amoonguss can take Scald easily and remove Suicune's Calm Mind boosts with Clear Smog if it does not run Substitute. Mega Venusaur can threaten Suicune with Giga Drain while also resisting its Scald, but it does lose to Suicune if it gets enough boosts with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Strong Offensive Foes</strong>: Strong offensive Pokemon like Mega Medicham, Thunder Punch Mega Metagross, and Choice Specs Latios, and Choice Specs Keldeo can all overload Suicune, making it tough for it to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off users like Bisharp, Weavile, and Clefable can all make Suicune easier to wear down by removing its Leftovers, especially if it lacks Rest.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Manaphy can set up on Suicune with Tail Glow and threaten it with Energy Ball. Mega Altaria can set up with Dragon Dance on Suicune, resists its Scald, and can remove any burns that Scald may inflict with Heal Bell. Calm Mind Mega Slowbro can set up Calm Mind with Suicune and threaten it with Psyshock. Mega Latias can also set up Calm Mind with Suicune and use Thunderbolt or Psyshock to beat it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Protect": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind allows Suicune to break through defensive cores while also getting bulkier. Substitute allows it to avoid status moves like Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Leech Seed. Substitute also helps Suicune against critical hits, which is useful against strong attacks and other Calm Mind users like Clefable. Substitute pairs very well with Protect to PP stall foes' moves like Leaf Storm from Serperior and Power Whip from Ferrothorn. Protect allows Suicune to scout moves from foes and get additional turns of recovery from Leftovers, which is important considering that Leftovers acts as Suicune's only form of recovery. Scald deals damage and has a nice benefit of a chance to burn foes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs give Suicune exactly 404 HP, which means Seismic Toss from foes like Chansey cannot break its Substitute. 216 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Suicune to outspeed Heatran, defensive Excadrill, defensive Garchomp, Zapdos, Bisharp, and Metagross before it Mega Evolves. 40 SpD EVs allow Suicune to better take on special attacks, notably preventing Amoonguss from breaking its Substitute and also giving its Substitute a chance to withstand a Volt Switch from Rotom-W after one Calm Mind boost. Leftovers is mandatory, as it acts as Suicune's only way of recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Suicune must avoid being statused, especially by burn or Toxic, as this set does not have reliable recovery or a way to remove status effects. Since Leftovers is its only form of recovery, it does not want it to be removed by Knock Off or other moves like Trick. Suicune finds setup opportunities on defensive foes that cannot threaten it, like Heatran and non-Thunderbolt Clefable, as well as foes Choice-locked into moves that cannot threaten it, which include Choice Specs Keldeo locked into Scald and Choice Scarf Magnezone locked into Hidden Power Fire or Flash Cannon. Utilize Pressure to stall out low PP moves with Substitute and Protect like Leaf Storm from Serperior and Power Whip from Ferrothorn. Protect can also be useful against Choice item users like Choice Scarf Magnezone, Tyranitar, and Excadrill.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit users like Mega Metagross, Tyranitar, and Weavile are able to remove Latios and Mega Latias, both of which resist Suicune's Scald. Tyranitar and Weavile can also check Electric-types like Thundurus and Zapdos with Stone Edge and Icicle Crash. Do be aware of Tyranitar's summoned sand hindering Suicune's recovery. Status absorbers like Gliscor and Clefable are good partners to take on the likes of Will-O-Wisp and Toxic. Heatran can help Suicune deal with Grass-types like Serperior and Ferrothorn while also having access to utility moves like Stealth Rock. Latios can remove entry hazards, which chip away at Suicune, and also deal with Electric-types like Rotom-W and Thundurus. Latias does the same but also provides Healing Wish support to remove status and heal Suicune to full health. Clefable is another helpful Healing Wish user. Tornadus-T can help Suicune deal with Grass-types like Serperior as well as provide Knock Off and U-turn support. Magnezone is a good partner, as it has the ability to remove Ferrothorn, which could otherwise absorb Suicune's Scald and threaten it with Power Whip.</p>"

      "Defensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald dishes out damage while also having a nice chance to cripple foes with a burn. Rest provides Suicune recovery but has the downside of putting it to sleep for two turns. Calm Mind makes Suicune bulkier and makes it easier to break through defensive cores and sweep. Roar is useful to phaze setup users like Calm Mind Mega Slowbro and Clefable. Alternatively, Sleep Talk gives Suicune a chance to use Scald to burn foes or set up another Calm Mind while it sleeps due to Rest.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment allows Suicune to be as bulky as possible and better at taking on physical attackers like Mega Metagross, Excadrill, Gliscor, Mega Scizor, Weavile, and Landorus-T. Leftovers allows Suicune to stay healthy and reduces the need to use Rest. Pressure is Suicune's only legal ability and helps it win setup wars with other Calm Mind users like Clefable as well as stall out defensive Pokemon like Quagsire and Gastrodon. 20 EVs can be taken from Defense and put into Speed to allow Suicune to outspeed Rotom-W so it can use Calm Mind before Rotom-W uses Volt Switch. 20 Speed EVs also allow Suicune to outspeed Adamant Crawdaunt and some variants of specially defensive Heatran.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Roar should be used to phaze out foes that want to set up like Calm Mind Clefable, force switch-ins to take entry hazard damage, and scout out movesets early-game. Suicune should spam Scald early-game to spread burns on common switch-ins like Ferrothorn and Latios to cripple them. Rest should be used to help Suicune remove a status aliment like burn, Toxic poison, or paralysis and to help it stay healthy. Calm Mind should be used late-game to allow Suicune break through and sweep teams when all its checks are eliminated or weakened.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Skarmory can provide Spikes for Suicune, which is a good combination with Roar to force chip damage. Ferrothorn also has access to Spikes and can take strong attacks that Skarmory cannot, like Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Latios and Thunder Punch from Mega Metagross. It also appreciates Suicune's ability to resist Fire-type moves. Heatran can provide Stealth Rock support and take on Grass-types like Serperior and Ferrothorn that can check Suicune. Mega Latias can deal with Electric-types that threaten Suicune like Thundurus and Zapdos. Tornadus-T helps Suicune deal with Grass-types like Serperior while also providing utility via Knock Off and U-turn. Tyranitar can remove Latios and Latias, which resist Suicune's Scald, while also removing entry hazard removers to make Roar more effective. Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Heatran can take on Grass-types and cripple opposing Water-types like Gastrodon via Solar Beam or Toxic, respectively. Excadrill is able to spin away entry hazards that could wear down Suicune, resist Fairy-type attacks from the likes of Clefable, deal with Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Zapdos via Toxic or Rock Slide, and take on Electric-type attacks from the likes of Magnezone. Clefable can form a Calm Mind core with Suicune while also checking certain Electric-types like Thundurus.</p>"

  "Zygarde": {
    "overview": "<p>Zygarde is often ridiculed due to its low stats for a supposed titular legendary and is subsequently dismissed as an \"inferior Garchomp\". However, its very well-placed stats grant it great bulk, decent power, and usable Speed. Dragon- and Ground-type STAB is a powerful combination, able to hit nearly the entire tier for at least neutral damage. Zygarde has great boosting options as well, namely Dragon Dance and Coil, the latter of which is unique to Zygarde in the OU environment. While its offensive movepool is shallow, it is solid enough to threaten a majority of opposing Pokemon and also includes Extreme Speed. That said, Zygarde lacks immediate power compared to its fellow Dragon-type Pokemon and has an unfortunately useless ability. It also does not have a reliable Dragon-type attack, which can limit its sweeping ability. It takes a tad longer for Zygarde to become a threat compared to other Dragons, but that does not make it any less of one.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Camouflage may be used to remove most of Zygarde's weaknesses and give it STAB Extreme Speed, but Dragon Dance and Coil gives Extreme Speed the same boost and powers up Zygarde's other moves instead of weakening them like Camouflage does by removing their STAB. Land's Wrath is completely inferior to Earthquake, so don't let its title of \"signature move\" tempt you. Haze lets Zygarde stop setup sweepers, but Zygarde lacks the tools or offensive presence to deter most foes from setting up again, plus it has Dragon Tail anyway. Toxic can cripple some of Zygarde's bulkier checks, but none of its sets really have the moveslot for it. RestTalk + Dragon Tail can improve Zygarde's longevity, but Hippowdon makes a better bulky phazer due to its better recovery and spare moveslots.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Anti-Setup</strong>: Zygarde thrives on setting up, so disrupting it from doing so is a good way to keep it under control. Unaware Clefable and Quagsire stop Zygarde cold, the former of which threatens with STAB Moonblast. A quick Taunt can prevent Zygarde from doing much more, limiting its offensive presence. Tricking a Choice item onto Zygarde can utterly ruin it for the most part. Phazing can be an option, though most users are outsped by Zygarde's Dragon Tail, making it less effective.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types are immune to Dragon Tail and Outrage, and can hit Zygarde back with their super effective STAB attacks. Mega Gardevoir, Unaware Clefable, Azumarill, and Sylveon are good answers to most sets.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Zygarde really doesn't like being hit by status at all. Even the Rest sets could do without being pressured to sleep early. Burns heavily cripple Zygarde, though Substitute coupled with Zygarde's Speed can make it difficult to cause a status affliction; Talonflame and fast Rotom-W are among the few status users that can outpace Zygarde. Gliscor can also Toxic Zygarde before the latter sets up a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Flying-types and Levitate users such as Landorus-T, Mandibuzz, Togekiss, Skarmory, and Rotom-W are immune to Zygarde's most reliable attack, forcing it to use less desirable attacks such as Outrage, Dragon Tail, and Stone Edge. That said, forcing Zygarde to use those attacks might not actually stop it on the spot, but it can potentially interrupt its sweep. This is especially problematic for Dragon Tail variants, as bulky Flying-types with recovery can typically outlast Zygarde's Dragon Tail PP while deterring it from using Earthquake to give them free switches. Zapdos might be at risk when Roosting due to it being potentially faster than Zygarde, but Pressure can punish mispredictions on Zygarde's part, and Skarmory and Mandibuzz do not mind repeatedly switching in and being phazed by Dragon Tails due to their high Defense, Roost, and in Skarmory's case, resistance.</p> <p><strong>Bypassing Substitute</strong>: Sylveon's and Mega Gardevoir's Hyper Voice, as well as Mamoswine's Icicle Spear, are all capable of busting through Zygarde's Substitute, rendering the SubCoil set's attempts to set up and sweep completely futile.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: In a similar vein, Pokemon that can still act before Dragon Dance Zygarde can potentially make it useless. Choice Scarf Garchomp and Ice Shard Mamoswine are such examples, as they can outspeed +1 Zygarde and KO it with super effective attacks, though Extreme Speed Zygarde will land a hit on them first, and the former two cannot stop a Zygarde that has attained more than one boost.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SubCoil": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute blocks status and various weaker attacks and also guards Zygarde against faster Pokemon. Coil is an enhanced Bulk Up, boosting Zygarde's Attack, Defense, and accuracy, which ensures a perfectly accurate Dragon Tail. This allows Zygarde to become exceptionally tanky. Earthquake is Zygarde's most reliable attack and offers good power. Dragon Tail prevents slower phazers from forcing out Zygarde's Substitute, while also hitting airborne Pokemon and forcing out unfavorable matchups or opposing stat boosters.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>56 Speed EVs allow Zygarde to outspeed Bisharp and hit it with Earthquake before Zygarde can be hit with Knock Off. The rest of the EVs are used to maximize Zygarde's special bulk. It has enough HP investment to create 101 HP Substitutes, which allows Zygarde's Substitute to tank two Seismic Tosses before breaking. Maximum Special Defense prevents weaker special attacks such as Mega Venusaur's Giga Drain from breaking Zygarde's Substitute, while Coil makes up for its Defense. Zero Attack EVs ensure STAB Foul Play will not break the Substitute, so it would be unwise to invest in Attack. Leftovers is the essential item, allowing Zygarde to recover health lost from Substitute.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>SubCoil Zygarde has a great advantage against defensive teams, setting up easily on Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Mandibuzz, Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, bulky Mega Scizor, and Heatran. Zygarde can set up a Substitute against the many foes unable to break it, then boost away. Should any problematic Pokemon trouble Zygarde, it can Dragon Tail them away behind the safety of the Substitute, and might even drag out the opponent's setup fodder again; continually repeating this will easily wear down Zygarde's checks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially based Fairy-types, especially Unaware Clefable and Togekiss, can pose a problem due to their immunity to Dragon Tail, so Pokemon that can threaten them make good partners; Scizor, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Venusaur are good options. Draco Meteor and Ice Beam are two special attacks Zygarde fears greatly, so Pokemon that resist one or preferably both of these moves make great partners; Azumarill, Sylveon, and Scizor come to mind. Entry hazard users make helpful teammates, as they can maximize the effectiveness of Zygarde's Dragon Tail, and Pokemon such as Heatran and Skarmory can even cover Zygarde's weaknesses; however, it is worth mentioning that the hazards do not stay long, as Zygarde does not do a good job of preventing Rapid Spin or Defog, so they are not essential. If you do choose a hazard user, make sure to have a response against anti-hazards on your team, such as spinblockers or Defiant Pokemon; Bisharp makes a great teammate as it can deal with Fairy-types as well.</p> <p>Pokemon immune to Ground-type moves such as bulky Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate can pose some issues for Zygarde, as they can force Zygarde to use its negative priority Dragon Tail, allowing them to respond accordingly by either healing or breaking Zygarde's Substitute. Thundurus can threaten a good majority of available Flying-types as well as Levitate users. Teammates should pick up the slack against offensive teams that do not provide Zygarde an opportunity to set up. VoltTurn users such as Talonflame and Thundurus can easily harass offensive teams, but slower users such as Scizor and Rotom-W can instead try to bring Zygarde in safely. Pokemon that can spread paralysis can slow down offensive Pokemon so they too fall victim to Zygarde, thus making Klefki and Thundurus good partners—Klefki even provides Spikes for Zygarde's Dragon Tail.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Zygarde's Attack and Speed, readying Zygarde to sweep its opponent. Earthquake provides solid damage with no drawbacks, making it Zygarde's most reliable attack and premier sweeping move. Outrage hits hard after a single boost, but locks Zygarde in and confuses it afterward; however, it is effective at cleaning up opponents late-game. Stone Edge hits Togekiss and picks off Flying-types such as Thundurus and Tornadus-T without resorting to Outrage. Extreme Speed can be used to outpace opposing priority users, most notably Talonflame and Mamoswine, though their inability to OHKO Zygarde anyway means Extreme Speed isn't too necessary.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature provides Zygarde with greater sweeping potential after a single Dragon Dance, and maximum Speed investment ensures Zygarde Speed ties with neutral Kyurem-B, and also outspeeds neutral Mega Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Jolly Gyarados. Alternatively, Jolly with 164 Speed EVs outruns Mega Alakazam and Mega Aerodactyl at +1, though the lack of an Attack-boosting nature substantially drops Zygarde's power, not to mention the relative rarity of these threats. The remaining EVs can be placed in any other stat. Life Orb can be used to give Zygarde a significant power boost, considering its base Attack is not as good as other Dragons, but it cuts into Zygarde's bulk, an advantage it does have over other Dragon-types. Lum Berry allows Zygarde to set up on status users, such as Rotom-W, Chansey, and Gliscor, or snap Zygarde out of Outrage confusion. Yache Berry allows Zygarde to survive non-STAB Ice-type moves, allowing Zygarde to either set up on them or prevent itself from being revenge killed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dragon Dance Zygarde's greatest advantage over Dragonite is its resistance to Stealth Rock, lessening the need for entry hazard removal from teammates. This set is very straightforward: boost once (twice if possible) and start attacking. Between the boosted Speed, high bulk, and a powerful STAB combination, Dragon Dance Zygarde can pose a serious threat to offensive teams. Zygarde should optimally be set to sweep after one Dragon Dance, cleaning up with a speedy and powerful Earthquake or Outrage. Ground resistant or immune Pokemon, or physically bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon, should be removed before going for the sweep, so as to avoid being forced into using Outrage early. Hard-hitting offensive Pokemon such as Thundurus and Azumarill do a great job at wreaking havoc and softening up opposing teams, which can pave the way for Zygarde to clean things up. When running Extreme Speed, it allows Zygarde to perform the occasional revenge kill on weakened Pokemon such as Talonflame. Zygarde uses its good bulk and resistances to tank a hit and set up, or threatens foes with STAB Earthquake to gain free turns. If Life Orb is used, take care not to let Zygarde's health drop too low before setting up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-W is a great partner regardless of the coverage option; it takes on Togekiss for Zygarde that lack Stone Edge and can handle Talonflame and Mamoswine for Zygarde without Extreme Speed. While Stealth Rock benefits any offensive Pokemon, it is especially helpful for Zygarde, as it weakens a good majority of Ground-resistant Pokemon, which allows Zygarde to pick them off with its weaker move as opposed to using Outrage to KO them. Because Flying-type Pokemon and Levitate users can get in the way of a clean sweep, teammates that can handle these Pokemon are recommended. Kyurem-B, Thundurus, and Raikou are great anti-Flying-type measures, while luring and hurting a good majority of Levitate users as well. Zygarde finds it easier to set up on opponents weak to Ground-type moves; Talonflame lures in Rock-types or Steel-types such as Heatran and Tyranitar and U-turns away from them. Dual screens aren't necessary, but they ease Zygarde's job of setting up, while its natural bulk makes it even more challenging to take down behind them; Klefki, Azelf, or Latios can provide this support.</p>"
      },
      "DDRest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Zygarde's Attack and Speed, which allows Zygarde to sweep its foe when set up. Rest completely heals Zygarde of any damage and status and is best used when Zygarde has taken a beating from attacks and status moves while boosting with Dragon Dance, undoing your opponent's efforts and threatening them with a fresh, boosted Zygarde. Earthquake is Zygarde's most reliable attack and main sweeping move. The last move of choice complements Earthquake well. Outrage hits very hard after a boost or two, but locks Zygarde into the move and confuses it afterward. Stone Edge hits Togekiss and picks off other Flying-types such as Thundurus and Mega Pinsir without needing to confuse Zygarde, but it lacks STAB and can fall short on KOing most other Pokemon that resist Ground.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature maximizes Zygarde's sweeping potential. 136 Speed EVs allow Zygarde to outspeed Choice Scarf Terrakion at +2 Speed, likely the fastest Choice Scarf Pokemon one will see. This also allows Zygarde to outspeed Noivern at +1 Speed and conveniently outspeeds unboosted Adamant Dragonite. The remaining EVs go into HP, which gives Zygarde enough bulk to survive 2 Fire Blasts from Mega Charizard Y. The combination of Chesto Berry and Rest acts as a Full Restore, allowing Zygarde to set up freely on status users such as Rotom-W, Chansey, and Gliscor, then heal itself completely when the time is right so that Zygarde can sweep its foes unhindered by health or status concerns.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Zygarde set aims to use Dragon Dance a couple of times while taking damage and/or status, then use Rest to refresh itself and sweep with a good amount of health and boosts. With its great bulk, it can set up on numerous Pokemon that have trouble 2HKOing it, so long as they do not have Ice-type moves; this includes such Pokemon as Excadrill, Mega Scizor, Rotom-W, Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, Gengar, Mega Charizard Y, Chansey, Gliscor, and Terrakion. Alternatively, Zygarde can start getting boosts against Pokemon it can force out, such as Excadrill, Heatran, and Tyranitar, though the risk of Ice Punch makes the last option risky. Zygarde can also take advantage of weaker Choice-locked attacks, such as Terrakion's Stone Edge, Keldeo's Secret Sword, and Garchomp's Earthquake. Dragon Dance Rest Zygarde works best against balanced teams, where it exploits their weak links to set up and uses its combination of bulk, Speed, and strong dual STAB moves to overwhelm its foes, which are often unprepared to deal with the threat. Zygarde should only face an opponent that it can handle for certain, as Resting too early without getting enough boosts may cut its sweep short, and Zygarde likely won't get a chance to do it again.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Zygarde's main spamming move is Earthquake, making Flying-types and Levitate users notable annoyances. Stealth Rock can clip the wings of the former, with Clefable, Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, and Heatran being good users of the move. These Pokemon do not clash weaknesses with Zygarde, unlike most Ground-type Stealth Rock users such as Landorus-T and Hippowdon. Tyranitar can take on most Flying-types, while Ferrothorn and Heatran offer decent defensive synergy alongside Leech Seed and burn support, respectively. Kyurem-B, Thundurus, and Raikou are great anti-Flying-type measures, luring and hurting a good majority of Levitate users as well. Fairy-types can be a huge obstacle in Zygarde's path, most notably physically defensive variants of Clefable and Togekiss; Steel-types such as Scizor, Excadrill, Magnezone, and Heatran can take out these Pokemon. Additionally, Scizor can use U-turn to bring Zygarde in safely or Pursuit trap Latios and Latias, Excadrill can weaken or take out the opponent's Ground-type checks, Magnezone can trap Skarmory and has a slow Volt Switch which also takes care of Flying-types, and Heatran can spread burns to ease Zygarde's setup.</p> <p>Because this Zygarde aims to rack up multiple boosts and has the means to heal off any damage and status incurred, dual screens would heavily boost this set's effectiveness, with Klefki, Azelf, and Latios making great users. Klefki has Prankster Thunder Wave to slow down threats and has decent defensive synergy with Zygarde, Azelf can set up Stealth Rock or Taunt Defoggers, and Latios can use Memento to bring Zygarde in safely.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Glare is essentially a superior Thunder Wave, as it is just as accurate and can also paralyze Ground-types. Earthquake is Zygarde's most reliable STAB move and targets grounded Electric-types such as Raikou and Mega Manectric, which cannot be paralyzed. Dragon Tail phazes foes, bringing out new opponents for Zygarde to paralyze. Substitute is used to take advantage of the free turns its paralyzed foes give, especially those that repeatedly switch in with the intent of shielding their teammates from the same fate, and it also guards against status such as burn and poison.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Because Zygarde cannot boost its Defense with Coil anymore, Defense is maxed out to tank physical attacks. Zygarde's impressive physical bulk lets it serve as an emergency check to a huge variety of physical attackers, such as Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, Mega Tyranitar, Landorus-T, and Terrakion, as well as unboosted foes such as Garchomp, Gyarados, and even Mega Charizard X, which Zygarde can paralyze or phaze. 56 Speed EVs are run to hit Bisharp with Earthquake before it can hit Zygarde with Knock Off.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Zygarde set aims to spread paralysis on everything. From there, it can Earthquake grounded Electric-types, use Substitute against status users so they do not impede Zygarde's job and shorten its staying power, and use Dragon Tail to phaze out paralyzed opponents so Zygarde has new foes to Glare. If the opponent persists in repeatedly sending out their already paralyzed Pokemon, Zygarde may take advantage by using Dragon Tail or Substitute on the switch, or make use of their paralysis by setting up a free Substitute.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Attackers that have trouble outspeeding opponents, such as Mega Heracross and Bisharp, greatly appreciate Zygarde's paralysis support, especially because paralysis affects Flying-types and cannot be Defogged away, unlike Sticky Web. This set's performance is greatly enhanced by entry hazards, as it forces a lot of switches; Klefki, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory can lay down Spikes while covering Zygarde's weaknesses, while Heatran and Tyranitar can provide Stealth Rock support, with more offensive variants even taking advantage of paralyzed foes. Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Gliscor are immune to both paralysis and Earthquake, making them big obstacles; Mega Venusaur, Sylveon, Clefable, and Kyurem-B can take on all three for the most part, although Kyurem-B does stack weaknesses, which is more prominent, as this Zygarde is a defensive variant.</p>"

  "Gardevoir": {
    "overview": "<p>By virtue of its incredible Special Attack stat and its ability, Pixilate, Mega Gardevoir is a very strong wallbreaker. Unlike most wallbreakers, Gardevoir also has a decent Speed stat, which doesn't make it dead weight against offensive teams. Gardevoir also has a solid typing with an immunity to Dragon, which all teams enjoy, and a great movepool which lets it potentially hit anything neutrally or super effectively. However, Steel-types are very common in OU, and they can switch in quite easily on any of Gardevoir's moves except Focus Blast. An only decent base 100 Speed coupled with terrible Defense also makes Gardevoir very easy to revenge kill with physical attackers and common strong priority moves, especially Bullet Punch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Ball hits Jirachi, Victini, and Mega Metagross, which would otherwise counter or check Gardevoir, super effectively. Future Sight works very well with a strong physical attacker as your opponent may have nothing to take a strong physical attack and a strong Future Sight simultaneously, usually leading to a Pokemon getting sacked if you play correctly. Destiny Bond can get rid of threats such as Mega Metagross, Ferrothorn, Bisharp, Manaphy, and a boosted Clefable in a pinch. Memento is an interesting move that creates setup opportunities for teammates, and Healing Wish can give a teammate a second chance to sweep. Hidden Power Fire lures in Mega Scizor and almost OHKOes it on the switch, but leaves Gardevoir walled by Heatran. Choice Scarf Gardevoir is an interesting set that can revenge kill weather sweepers with Trace, as well as Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Altaria. Additionally, Life Orb is an option over Gardevoirite if you already have a Mega Evolution on your team but still need an offensive Fairy-type. Encore can be used as an alternate method of breaking through defensive Pokemon by locking them into an unfavorable move, giving Gardevoir more opportunities to set up or launch off an attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Although some of them fear Focus Blast or Will-O-Wisp and thus can't switch in safely, if they get a free switch in, Steel-types such as Scizor, Mega Metagross, Jolly Excadrill, Jirachi, and Choice Scarf Magnezone can easily force Gardevoir out with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Gardevoir's Psyshock hits Poison-types for a huge amount of damage, but faster Poison-types, specifically Gengar and Mega Beedrill, can both easily KO it, provided they get a free switch in.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types resist Gardevoir's Fairy-type STAB, and most Fire-types can hit back very hard. The most notable ones are Victini, which is a good answer to non-Shadow Ball sets, and Heatran, which can take one Focus Blast and hit back with its Fire-type STAB moves, Flash Cannon, or use Toxic, depending on the set it uses. Both resist Psyshock as well, which is what makes them especially good checks.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Gardevoir's Defense stat is very low, so physical attackers that can survive a hit from it or simply outspeed it, such as Mega Metagross, Terrakion, Victini, Weavile, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, can easily KO it with just a little prior damage as long as they are not burned.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Although Gardevoir's Speed is far from horrible, it still leaves it vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Weavile, and Mega Lopunny. Strong priority moves such as Bisharp's Sucker Punch, Talonflame's Brave Bird, and Azumarill's Aqua Jet also do a ton of damage to Gardevoir because of its horrible Defense stat. However, the support set has a better matchup against them as it can usually survive a hit and use Will-O-Wisp to defeat them, granted Gardevoir is at good health.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hyper Voice hits incredibly hard and does a huge chunk of damage against any Pokemon that does not resist it. Psyshock hits special walls, most notably Chansey, on their Defense, allowing Gardevoir to break through them. Focus Blast hits the Steel-types that resist Gardevoir's STAB moves, such as Ferrothorn. Will-O-Wisp is great for burning Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, and Jirachi on the switch. Taunt allows Gardevoir to break through defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Clefable, and it stops Pokemon such as Bisharp from setting up on Gardevoir. Calm Mind makes Gardevoir a powerful setup sweeper that can threaten bulky and fast teams alike. Substitute can also be used, as Gardevoir forces a ton of switches, and it makes Gardevoir harder to revenge kill, eases prediction, and protects it from status moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Trace is the preferred ability before Mega Evolution, as it makes Gardevoir capable of turning a foe's ability against them. Some example of this include countering specially defensive Heatran with Taunt, stealing Regenerator from Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Slowbro, taking advantage of Manectric's Lightning Rod, Intimidating Landorus-T and Gyarados, and trapping Magnezone locked into a Hidden Power. Additionally, Trace lets Gardevoir revenge kill weakened Dragonite with the aid of Multiscale, revenge kill weather sweepers such as Modest Kingdra and Adamant Excadrill if it is using a Timid nature, and Synchronize burn Mew as well in case you lack another Pokemon to absorb a burn from it. The defensive investment allows Gardevoir to avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Latios's Psyshock. The rest of the EVs are put into Speed, to make Gardevoir capable of outspeeding all defensive Pokemon and some slower offensive ones, such as Breloom and Tyranitar, and into Special Attack, to make Gardevoir hit very hard. A Timid nature improves Gardevoir's matchup against offensive teams by allowing it to outspeed Pokemon such as Jolly Excadrill, Pinsir on the turn it Mega Evolves, Jolly Landorus-T, and Timid Heatran. It also makes Gardevoir faster than Jolly Breloom and Jolly Bisharp on the turn it Mega Evolves, meaning Gardevoir can burn them with Will-O-Wisp before they can attack it, and makes Gardevoir capable of revenge killing most weather sweepers, as they usually do not run Speed-boosting natures. A Modest nature is, however, definitely viable if you would prefer the extra power instead.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set works best against stall and balance, destroying a lot of teams by just clicking Hyper Voice, using Focus Blast against Steel-types, and using Psyshock together with Taunt to get past dedicated special walls such as Chansey and Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. Gardevoir is not deadweight against offensive teams, however, because they usually have little to no switch-ins for it. Avoid physical attackers such as Azumarill, Talonflame, and Landorus-T, as Gardevoir has very poor physical bulk. Gardevoir actually has very good Special Defense, though, and it can use that to check Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Raikou, and Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo. Gardevoir can also use its typing to switch into Dragon-types and threaten them out with Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice, although it has to watch out for coverage moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit support from Pokemon such as Bisharp, Weavile, and Tyranitar is very helpful to remove Jirachi, Victini, and Mega Metagross, which are common answers to Gardevoir. Pokemon that help Mega Gardevoir outspeed the foe are also great teammates, as its Speed is only decent. Tailwind support from Pokemon such as Talonflame, Latios, Mew, and Zapdos or Sticky Web support from Shuckle is also appreciated, as is Prankster Thunder Wave, which Thundurus and Klefki can dish out. Magnezone is a good teammate to remove bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn so Gardevoir does not have to rely on Focus Blast's low accuracy to defeat them. Partners to check Flying-types such as Raikou, Zapdos, and Tyranitar are mandatory because Gardevoir's Defense stat is horrible, and it is thus easily KOed by Talonflame's Brave Bird, as well as Mega Pinsir's Aerilate Quick Attack if weakened. Steel- and Dragon-types such as Heatran, Bisharp, Garchomp, Latios, and Latias are good teammates as well, because together with Gardevoir they can form a Dragon-Steel-Fairy core, which has great type synergy. Pokemon that can take advantage of Gardevoir's wallbreaking prowess are also good teammates. Talonflame pressures many of Gardevoir's checks, while Gardevoir pressures Talonflame's checks back in return. Sand Rush Excadrill handles all of Gardevoir's checks except for Bronzong, which is easy to take advantage of and not that difficult to accommodate for. In return, Gardevoir handles Chesnaught, Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Rotom-W.</p>"

  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, there seems to be little reason to use Magnezone in OU. It's slow, has crippling weaknesses to common attacking types, and faces stiff competition from other, better Electric-type options available, such as Thundurus. However, its signature ability, Magnet Pull, gives it the excellent niche of being able to trap and remove many common Steel-types, making it a good partner for certain sweepers, such as Mega Pinsir and Dragonite. It also has a whopping 11 resistances and one immunity, the most of any Pokemon in the game. However, at the end of the day, Magnezone is still a rather niche option, and it can struggle to be very effective outside of its niche, which is shrinking more and more by the generation.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Analytic instead of Magnet Pull is usable, as it lets Magnezone hit insanely hard with Choice Specs, but Magnezone is rather outclassed outside of trapping Steel-types, so it isn't all that great. Magnezone can run a Substitute set with Leftovers, as Substitute protects it from being revenge killed after trapping a Steel-type and can allow it to get an extra KO before needing to switch out. Assault Vest is a decent item on Magnezone, as it has good bulk and a ton of resistances. However, its common weaknesses and lackluster power without a boosting item prevent such a set from being too effective. Hidden Power Ice is an option that hits Pokemon such as Garchomp and Dragonite, but Magnezone has no business staying in on these Pokemon a majority of the time and the loss of Hidden Power Fire can severely hinder its ability to do its job against other Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types, such as Garchomp, Excadrill, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Mamoswine, are a major thorn in Magnezone's side because they are immune to Volt Switch and Thunderbolt. In addition, they greatly threaten Magnezone with a STAB 4x super effective Earthquake or Earth Power. However, many of these Pokemon take massive damage from one of Magnezone's other moves, so they can't always freely switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types, particularly Terrakion, Conkeldurr, and Keldeo, can hit Magnezone hard with their super effective STAB moves. Despite this, they often take quite a bit of damage from Magnezone's moves and can easily lose momentum if they switch into a Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types, such as Talonflame, Heatran, Volcarona, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y, are very similar to Fighting-types in that they can easily check Magnezone but don't take its moves particularly well.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Other common Earthquake users, such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Venusaur, or Dragonite, can easily deal with Magnezone, as Magnezone cannot take even non-STAB Ground-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Chansey do not mind Magnezone's moves in most cases and many of them can simply heal off its futile attempts to damage them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is a useful source of momentum for Magnezone, especially with a Choice Scarf. Hidden Power Fire is used in the second slot to 2HKO both Ferrothorn and Scizor, which Magnezone can trap with Magnet Pull and eliminate for its teammates. Flash Cannon serves as a consistent secondary STAB move that is useful for hitting Fairy-types super effectively and providing neutral coverage on Ground- and Dragon- types, which otherwise give Magnezone a hard time. Toxic is also a viable option over Flash Cannon allowing Magnezone to poison bulkier Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Garchomp, putting them on a timer. Thunderbolt is used in the last slot for stronger Electric-type STAB move. However Thunder Wave can also be run to allow Magnezone to paralyse troublesome fast Pokemon such as Serperior.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf allows Magnezone to surprise the opponent potentially, as it's otherwise quite slow, and be a great cleaner late-game with STAB moves off its enormous base 130 Special Attack. It can also serve as a decent revenge killer to some Pokemon such as Mega Pinsir, Thundurus, and Talonflame. Maximum Special Attack investment is used to make the most of Magnezone's great base 130 Special Attack. Maximum Speed EVs with a boosting nature and a Choice Scarf allow Magnezone to outspeed everything slower than Thundurus, which is the majority of the unboosted tier. It also outspeeds non-Jolly Talonflame, which makes Magnezone a good check to teams that are centered around Flying-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Magnezone is a great late-game cleaner, 2HKOing a good portion of the metagame, and can revenge kill various threats throughout the game. It can also trap opposing Steel-types to help certain sweepers, such as Dragonite, Clefable, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Gyarados, sweep with more ease, though it only actually 2HKOes bulky Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Furthermore, Choice Scarf Magnezone can pick off weakened Excadrill after sand has ended. Thunderbolt should not be used very often, as Magnezone will be very easily exploited by common Ground-types, such as Excadrill and Landorus-T, if locked into Thunderbolt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that struggle against bulky Steel-types, such as Dragonite, Mega Pinsir, Staraptor, Excadrill, Mega Tyranitar, Mamoswine, Latias, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Gyarados, really appreciate Magnezone's support to help them sweep. Magnezone is naturally fit for teams that have issues with said bulky Steel-types. Pokemon that resist moves that Magnezone is weak to, such as Azumarill, Latias, Landorus-T, and Latios, make good partners. Additionally, Stealth Rock users are really helpful, as Stealth Rock can help Magnezone get some important KOs. Finally, Landorus-T is one of the best teammates to Magnezone because it can form a VoltTurn core with it, having an immunity to Ground-type attacks, resisting Fighting-type attacks, and being able to set up Stealth Rock.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch gains tons of momentum, especially against opposing Steel-types, and can help it escape from revenge killers. Hidden Power Fire is used in the second slot as it OHKOes Scizor and Ferrothorn, both of which are very important for Magnezone to trap. Thunderbolt is used in the last slot for consistent secondary STAB that does not force Magnezone out, but it should not be used very often, as Pokemon locked into an Electric-type move are very easily exploited by common Ground-types, such as Excadrill.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment is used to make the most of Magnezone's great base 130 Special Attack. The listed Speed EVs let it outspeed minimum Speed Skarmory. The rest of EVs go into HP for more longevity. 144 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed minimum Speed Heatran, but beware that Heatran commonly runs Speed investment and can hit Magnezone much harder than it can hit back. Because of this, it is generally a better idea to use the given spread rather than to try and trap Heatran, which is risky. Choice Specs is the main item, as without it, Magnezone lacks the power to deal with many key threats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The main goal of this set is to trap and eliminate opposing Steel-types that are causing trouble by walling its teammates. Magnezone is most effective at trapping Skarmory, Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Klefki, but it can occasionally trap Jirachi and Heatran as well. Because Ground-types love to switch into Magnezone, locking yourself into Volt Switch or Thunderbolt isn't often a good idea if the opponent has a Ground-type. However, this problem can be somewhat dealt with by good prediction, as most Ground-types hate switching into Magnezone's other moves. For example, Excadrill has a small chance of being OHKOed by Hidden Power Fire on the switch. Similarly, Flash Cannon has a chance of OHKOing Landorus-T and Gliscor on the switch after Stealth Rock. As this set's main targets are Steel-types, they are the Pokemon Magnezone should be switching in on most often. Ferrothorn and Skarmory in particular cannot touch Magnezone and are swiftly eliminated by it. Magnezone also outspeeds and OHKOes Scizor, but it must be wary of switching into Superpower.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any Pokemon that needs certain Steel-types to be removed in order to sweep, such as Dragon Dance Dragonite, Swords Dance Mega Pinsir, or Calm Mind Clefable, makes a good partner for Magnezone. Teams that have trouble breaking through bulky Steel-types such as Skarmory or Ferrothorn as a whole also benefit from Magnezone as a teammate. Pokemon that can beat the bulky Ground-types that love to switch in on Magnezone, such as Rotom-W, Azumarill, or Manaphy, make good partners for it.</p>"

  "Gallade": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Gallade functions as a wallbreaker as well as a setup sweeper thanks to its powerful Attack and good Speed stats. Gallade has access to a diverse movepool with powerful or practical STAB moves. Utilizing Swords Dance allows Mega Gallade to boost its Attack even higher, which can make it difficult for defensive teams to take it on. With the choice between Knock Off for Psychic-types, Ice Punch for Dragon- and Ground-types, and Poison Jab for Fairy-types, Mega Gallade's coverage is never perfect but adjustable to team needs and not easy to predict. Its decent bulk, notably in Special Defense, gives it setup opportunities against a majority of defensive Pokemon; it also allows Mega Gallade to take a hit from certain offensive threats in a pinch, like Mega Lopunny and Mega Alakazam. Due to its versatile movepool and naturally high Speed, Attack, and Special Defense stats, Mega Gallade can be played both as a bulky sweeper or as a fully offensive glass cannon. Despite having a lot of different move options, Mega Gallade can never cover all its threats and defensive checks with one set, making it dependent on its teammates to help out. Besides the Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Altaria, Mega Gallade struggles with fast Flying-types such as Tornadus-T and Talonflame as well as bulky Psychic-types like Cresselia, Slowbro, and Reuniclus.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zen Headbutt can be used over Psycho Cut; it is slightly stronger and has a flinch chance, but it will make Mega Gallade vulnerable to contact effects. Bulk Up replacing Swords Dance, especially behind dual screens and combined with Drain Punch, is a possible alternative. It allows Mega Gallade to sustain its HP against strong physical attackers like Mega Scizor, Mega Lopunny, Tyranitar, and Mega Metagross, ultimately overcoming them and being able to sweep after. Leaf Blade is another option for the last moveslot, allowing Mega Gallade to hit Quagsire, Hippowdon, and Slowbro super effectively. Taunt is a niche option, stopping foes from using status moves or preventing them from using Slack Off or Roost, giving Mega Gallade additional setup opportunities against Pokemon like Rotom-W, Skarmory, and Hippowdon. Ice Punch can be chosen as well to hit Dragon-, Flying-, and Ground-types hard, such as Latios, Gliscor, and Landorus-T.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fast Flying-types</strong>: Tornadus-T and Talonflame are big threats, outspeeding and being able to revenge kill Mega Gallade.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Slowbro, Cresselia, and Mega Latias are some of the best counters to Mega Gallade, surviving most of its moves at +2 and crippling it back with status.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Skarmory, Landorus-T, and Clefable all stomach hits from Mega Gallade at +2 and can damage it back significantly. Quagsire's ability Unaware makes it ignore Mega Gallade's Attack boosts. Hippowdon can phaze Mega Gallade with Whirlwind or cripple it with Toxic while sustaining itself with Slack Off.</p> <p><strong>Status Users</strong>: Pokemon that are able to status Mega Gallade like Rotom-W with Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave and Thundurus with Thunder Wave are good options to trade for weakening Mega Gallade.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: If Mega Gallade is not running Poison Jab, Fairy-types like Mega Altaria, Mega Gardevoir, and Azumarill can survive even a Swords Dance-boosted attack and revenge kill it with their Fairy-type STAB moves.</p>",

      "Bulky Drain Punch Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Due to Mega Gallade's high base Speed and ability in Inner Focus, it becomes quite hard to revenge kill. When combined with Drain Punch, Mega Gallade becomes a powerful offensive threat that is difficult to get rid of. Psycho Cut is chosen over Zen Headbutt for its ability to bypass harmful contact effects, which allows Mega Gallade to avoid getting paralyzed by Static Zapdos, being burned by Flame Body Volcarona, and taking damage from Rocky Helmet. Thanks to Psycho Cut, Mega Gallade is able to beat some of the traditional physically defensive pivots such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Zapdos. Shadow Sneak's priority allows Mega Gallade to hit faster targets and avoid risky Speed ties against threats such as Mega Alakazam, Latios, and weakened Mega Metagross. Knock Off, on the other hand, allows Mega Gallade to hit bulky Psychic-types that resist both of its STAB moves, such as Slowbro, Cresselia, and Mega Latias. It also comes with the benefit of removing items such as Rocky Helmet and Leftovers and hitting Cofagrigus harder.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Mega Gallade to be as fast as possible. 100 Attack EVs allow Mega Gallade to be able to 2HKO physically defensive Zapdos, and the bulk investment lets Mega Gallade survive Crunch from Mega Tyranitar and Earthquake from Life Orb Excadrill; this also makes it harder to revenge kill, letting it set up on various different options, such as Zapdos, Excadrill, and Mega Venusaur. Alternatively, a spread of 224 HP / 28 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe further commits to making Mega Gallade even harder to revenge kill at the cost of immediate firepower. 28 Attack EVs is the minimum investment needed for it to 2HKO Clefable with a Swords Dance-boosted Psycho Cut.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>For Mega Gallade to shine, it needs its teammates to pave the way. Defensive checks like Landorus-T, Clefable, and Skarmory and bulky Fighting- and Steel-types like Mega Metagross and Mega Scizor should already be chipped or crippled. To sweep successfully, Mega Gallade usually needs to use Swords Dance in order to deal enough damage, so it is important to pick a good spot to set up where it can neither be afflicted by a status move nor be damaged enough to not be able to recover enough with Drain Punch, if it is at risk to be revenge killed. It is crucial that an opposing Pokemon doesn't cripple it with status conditions. Despite performing best as a late-game sweeper, Mega Gallade can also be used to break down defensive cores early-game, especially if it can set up with Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Gallade does well on balanced, bulky offense, and hyper offense teams. On hyper offense, it can utilize Light Screen and Reflect to set up Swords Dance more safely; therefore, dual screens Serperior is a good teammate, as it additionally helps against Rotom-W, which threatens to burn Gallade with Will-O-Wisp. Assault Vest Bisharp can pivot into Fairy-types and threaten Psychic-types with Pursuit. Excadrill also switches into Fairy-types well, and it threatens Rotom-W with Mold Breaker Earthquake. Additionally, it can remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Teammates like Zapdos and Thundurus that can cover Mega Gallade's weakness to Flying-type attacks while also spreading paralysis are also greatly appreciated. Magnezone can trap bulky Steel-types that Mega Gallade struggles with, such as Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and Mega Metagross, while also providing valuable Flying and Fairy resistances. Clefable can help out Mega Gallade by absorbing status moves while supporting with Knock Off and Thunder Wave itself, providing better opportunities for Mega Gallade to break opposing teams.</p>"
      },
      "Glass Cannon": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mega Gallade's high Speed and Attack, combined with the powerful STAB move Close Combat and accompanied by Psycho Cut, make it a strong physical wallbreaker, which gets even stronger by using Swords Dance. Mega Gallade's rather fragile Defense being lowered is a notable risk of Close Combat. Using Psycho Cut over Zen Headbutt allows Mega Gallade to avoid getting crippled by contact-based abilities and items such as Rocky Helmet, Garchomp's Rough Skin, and Zapdos's Static. Knock Off provides coverage against bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro, Cresselia, and Mega Latias that resist both of Mega Gallade's STAB moves, while Poison Jab enables Mega Gallade to OHKO Fairy-types like Clefable after a Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread allows Mega Gallade to deal as much damage as possible while utilizing the base 110 Speed tier to outspeed threats like Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, and Mega Medicham and Speed tie with threats like Latios, Latias, and Mega Metagross. Justified is used as Gallade's preferred pre-Mega ability, as it can punish Knock Off from weaker foes like Ferrothorn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Gallade can be used as a wallbreaker against defensive cores or as a sweeper after weakening its checks. Ideally, Mega Gallade comes in on foes that allow it to use Swords Dance. It is important to choose setup opportunities carefully to avoid Mega Gallade getting crippled by Scald or Will-O-Wisp burns or paralyzed by Thunder Wave.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Gallade can be a strong sweeper on bulky offense or hyper offense teams. With the support of dual screens, which are often used on hyper offense teams, it can set up Swords Dance more safely. Therefore, classic dual screen setters like Serperior and Latias make good teammates. Because it struggles with Psychic-types like Latios, Cresselia, and Slowbro, Pursuit trappers like Assault Vest Bisharp and Tyranitar synergyze well with Mega Gallade, especially since both are able to pressure Clefable as well. To cover its weakness to Flying-types, teammates like Zapdos and Thundurus are helpful. Both possess the ability to spread paralysis, making it easier for Mega Gallade to sweep late-game. Magnezone can trap bulky Steel-types that Mega Gallade struggles with, such as Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and Mega Metagross; it also provides valuable Flying and Fairy resistances. Pokemon like Clefable and Slowbro that help against Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Iron Barbs users such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn make good teammates for Mega Gallade as well.</p>"

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatran is an extraordinarily versatile and effective Pokemon in the OU tier. With excellent bulk and a nice defensive typing, it can serve as a check to an enormous amount of top-tier threats, such as Latias, Latios, Clefable, Mega Scizor, Talonflame, and Mega Charizard X. Due to these traits, it can serve as an effective bulky support Pokemon, boasting the ability to take advantage of many bulkier foes with the Taunt + Toxic combination. However, a defensive set is not all that Heatran can pull off in OU; it can also serve as an offensive Stealth Rock setter, stallbreaker, trapper, check to various Ground-type move users with Air Balloon, Choice Scarf user, and so much more. Having all these options means that Heatran can be molded to fit whatever purposes its team requires and is a true team player. Unfortunately for Heatran, it has weaknesses to Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks, which are extremely common in OU and threatening for it. Additionally, some of the Pokemon that Heatran is meant to handle can lure it in and then KO it, such as Superpower Mega Scizor, Knock Off Mega Venusaur, Earthquake Latios, and Focus Blast Clefable.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>SubToxic is a decent set for Heatran that allows it to put enormous pressure on opposing Pokemon by getting behind a Substitute and serving as a general nuisance to the opposing team by wearing down the foe with status and damage from Heatran's Fire-type STAB move. The primary issue is that it's walled by specially defensive Gliscor, a common threat, and is pretty much forced to run Taunt unless it wants to lose to Clefable. This forces it to forgo Protect, which makes Heatran play in a rather clunky manner by limiting its recovery and preventing it from getting useful extra turns of Toxic damage. Will-O-Wisp is a decent move choice for fast variants of Heatran, enabling it to check Bisharp effectively while also crippling Azumarill and Tyranitar. The issue with it as an option is that it gives Heatran no way of damaging Mega Charizard X or Talonflame and is less crippling to bulky Pokemon that don't mind the loss of Attack. A physically defensive EV spread is an option for the bulky set if the extra reliability against Talonflame and Mega Charizard X is appreciated. It also does some neat things such as allowing Heatran to survive a Close Combat from Mega Pinsir and an Earthquake from Latios with relative ease. However, this comes at the cost of either Speed or Special Defense, both of which are overall more useful for Heatran. Flame Charge provides somewhat of a surprise factor and lets Heatran clean up late-game. Rest fully heals up Heatran, but leaves it helpless as setup fodder for various sweepers. Heatran can also run Choice Specs in order to overwhelm Water-types that switch in such as Keldeo and Starmie and has effective wallbreaking capabilities, being able to 2HKO nearly everything in the tier that isn't Chansey.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types are the absolute best way of stopping Heatran, resisting its STAB moves and hitting it super effectively with their powerful attacks. Keldeo, Azumarill, Rotom-W, Manaphy, Gyarados, Starmie, and Suicune are just some examples taken from the myriad of Water-types in the OU tier that can switch into and pressure Heatran. However, most of these Pokemon are crippled by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Specially defensive Gliscor and Lum Berry Garchomp, outside of Hidden Power Ice, are flawless answers to Heatran, not caring about status and boasting a 4x super effective STAB move. Other versions of Garchomp and Gliscor in addition to Landorus-T, Diggersby, Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Excadrill (shaky due to its Fire weakness) are some examples of other Ground-types that, while they may not enjoy switching into Heatran due to a potential Lava Plume burn, they can put tons of pressure on it by virtue of their Ground-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Mega Lopunny, Terrakion, Keldeo, Gallade, and Hawlucha are some examples of powerful Fighting-type attackers that put immense amounts of pressure on Heatran. However, outside of Keldeo, they're not great switch-ins, as they fear a Lava Plume burn and are forced out by Choice Scarf variants.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Defensive Heatran absolutely despises Knock Off because Leftovers is its only form of recovery and is crucial to its survival. Mew, Mega Venusaur, and Ferrothorn are particularly effective users of the move because Heatran normally can switch into them for free and do as it pleases.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: As Heatran lacks recovery outside of Leftovers, smart play can allow it to be worn down via residual damage. Entry hazards and Leech Seed can potentially even limit Heatran's opportunities to switch in, as damage from them will rack up quickly so long as Heatran doesn't get too many Leftovers recovery turns.</p> <p><strong>Special Sponges and Pokemon that Resist Fire</strong>: Chansey, Blissey, Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Goodra can all tank Heatran's attacks easily by virtue of their bulk or resistances while being able to pressure it effectively. Chansey does not fare well against sets with Taunt, though, as it will be worn down quickly between Stealth Rock and potential Toxic damage without the ability to recover its health, so it has to be mindful of how frequently it switches in and how much health it is losing.</p> <p><strong>Lures</strong>: Due to Heatran's exploitable Water, Fighting, and Ground weaknesses, some Pokemon that lure in Heatran can opt to run moves in order to potentially KO or weaken it. Earthquake Latios, Surf Latias, fast Superpower Mega Scizor (only a threat to slower Heatran variants), Earthquake Mega Charizard X, Focus Blast Clefable, opposing Heatran with Earth Power, Hidden Power Ground Volcarona, Taunt Talonflame, and Knock Off Mega Venusaur are some examples of options that can be employed to prevent Heatran from handling these Pokemon effectively and even get it out of the way for a partner that struggles with it.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Lava Plume is Heatran's best reliable STAB move, threatening Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Serperior as well as Steel-types like Scizor, Skarmory, and Mega Metagross. It can also punish \"safe\" switch-ins like Rotom-W, Gliscor, and Slowbro by burning them. Specially defensive Heatran is a good Stealth Rock setter due to its bulk and typing allowing it to set said entry hazard safely against Pokemon like Zapdos, Serperior, and Clefable. Roar prevents setup sweepers like Volcarona, Mega Gyarados, Mega Gallade, and Clefable from setting up freely. Toxic can be used instead of Roar to help against Water- or Ground-types such as Rotom-W, Slowbro, Keldeo, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon. Taunt helps Heatran with bulky Pokemon such as Chansey, Clefable, and Zapdos by preventing them from using recovery and other status moves. Protect allows Heatran to get extra Leftovers recovery turns and possibly extra turns of chip damage on burned or poisoned foes. Further, it allows Heatran to scout Choice-locked threats such as Weavile, Tyranitar, Keldeo, and Latios. Lastly, Earth Power can be used to deal with opposing Heatran.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment allows Heatran to deal with Pokemon like Serperior, Clefable, and Zapdos with ease and also allows it to survive Focus Blast from Mega Charizard Y, Mega Alakazam, and Thundurus, giving Heatran the opportunity to poison them with Toxic, set Stealth Rock, or hit them with Lava Plume. The bulk also allows Heatran to stay in against Rotom-W and Slowbro to poison them, use Taunt on them, or set up Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Specially defensive Heatran can easily set up Stealth Rock against a wide variety of foes. Pokemon like Zapdos, Clefable, and Serperior are threatened by Heatran while not being able to deal substantial damage back to it. Steel-types such as Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn also allow Heatran an easy switch in. Once it enters the field, it can use Toxic or attempt to burn Ground- or Water-types like Gastrodon, Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Rotom-W to help break down defensive cores. Heatran should always be looking to come in on Fire-type moves like a Zapdos or Tornadus-T Heat Wave to threaten foes with a Flash Fire-boosted Lava Plume. Heatran can also use its Steel typing to switch into Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Altaria, as well as switch into Poison-type moves, especially Toxic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Heatran set works best on balanced or bulky teams. Used correctly, it comes in on resisted moves from which it takes little damage. This, combined with its bulk and ability to sustain itself on Leftovers recovery, allows it to play longer games where Stealth Rock and possible inflicted statuses such as burn and poison can help its team break down defensive cores. Heatran resists Flying-, Fairy-, and Psychic-type moves and therefore synergizes well with strong Fighting-types like Mega Medicham, Mega Gallade, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Heracross. Heatran teams up well with strong or bulky Water-types like Keldeo, Slowbro, and Rotom-W, as it can take care of Grass-types like Serperior, Ferrothorn, and Amoonguss as well as most common Electric-types like Zapdos and Thundurus. Heatran benefits from having teammates that can deal with Ground- and Fighting-types. Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, and Zapdos resist both types and gain momentum with Volt Switch or U-turn. Clefable makes for a good partner too, since it resists Fighting-type moves and is also able to ease matchups against common Ground-type threats like Garchomp and Landorus-T.</p>"
      },
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Lava Plume is a basic STAB option with a useful burn chance to punish common switch-ins, especially physical attackers such as Azumarill and Landorus-T. Toxic is critical for Heatran to cripple bulky Water-types, wear down Keldeo, and actually handle Roost Latios, Mega Charizard X, and Talonflame; it also prevents Pokemon from setting up for free. Taunt is is crucial for Heatran to deal with Calm Mind Clefable and is incredibly useful against balanced and stall teams, allowing Heatran to wear down defensive Pokemon, such as Chansey, Mandibuzz, and Mega Venusaur, when combined with Toxic and defeat slower Heatran that lack Earth Power. Protect is an excellent option to scout opposing Pokemon, prevent Choice Scarf Landorus-T from keeping momentum with U-turn, punish a potential double switch when it is first used, rack up Toxic damage, and increase Heatran's longevity by giving it extra turns of Leftovers recovery. Roar is another solid option to phaze setup sweepers, ensuring Heatran can deal with the likes of Mega Charizard X and Talonflame when Toxic damage won't be enough. The last slot is typically occupied by Stealth Rock because Heatran is perhaps the single most consistent Stealth Rock user in the OU tier, boasting a good matchup against every common Defog user, including Latios, Latias, Skarmory, Mandibuzz, and Zapdos, and threatening Adamant Excadrill while being able to set up the entry hazard on a high number of popular Pokemon. Earth Power prevents opposing Heatran from stalling this Heatran out with Taunt, hits Mega Diancie, and Mega Charizard X easier. Another option is Stone Edge if Heatran's team doesn't really have other ways of checking notable threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Talonflame, particularly Taunt variants. Ancient Power boasts perfect accuracy, but it doesn't do enough to specially defensive Talonflame variants to be worth it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs allow Heatran to outrun everything up to Jolly Mega Scizor and Jolly Mega Heracross, allowing Heatran to pick them off with Lava Plume. The HP EVs make Heatran as bulky as possible, in order to consistently take hits from the likes of Latios, while still being able to take on Fairy-types such as Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Diancie. Leftovers provides passive recovery which allows Heatran to deal with entry hazards more easily while being able to heal against forced switches against Grass- and Bug-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Heatran should be pivoted into Pokemon it beats, such as Latios, Clefable, Mega Venusaur, and Ferrothorn, in order to get Stealth Rock up as soon as possible; it can be pivoted in more recklessly than fast Heatran variants because it has more bulk to sponge hits. In some scenarios, it may be best to fire off a Toxic immediately in order to wear down a threatening Keldeo or Azumarill that will be more inclined to switch in directly when they anticipate Stealth Rock as opposed to Toxic. Scouting for lures such as Earthquake Latios and fast Superpower Mega Scizor is imperative with this set because you don't want to lose Heatran just because you were careless. If the opponent has a Pokemon that Heatran is necessary to deal with, such as Talonflame or Mega Charizard X, exercise extra caution. Due to its excellent special bulk, Heatran actually has the capacity to tank Scalds from bulky Water-types and even a Hydro Pump from Rotom-W and cripple them with a Toxic; unless keeping Heatran healthy is absolutely necessary, keep in mind the advantages of crippling these Pokemon with a Toxic, especially if wearing them down is compulsory for a teammate to sweep. Finally, if using Protect, keep in mind that it should only be used in scenarios in which it can't be punished; Protect can actually give certain foes of a free turn of setup if misused.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, Slowbro, Celebi, Ferrothorn, Latios, and Latias make for great teammates to deal with offensive Water-types, particularly Azumarill and Keldeo. A solid teammate that resists Fighting to switch into Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham is crucial; Clefable, Landorus-T, defensive Mega Altaria, and, Mega Slowbro, are some examples of Pokemon that can fulfill this role. A pivot for Landorus-T and physical Ground-types in general is pretty important; some choices are Rotom-W, Slowbro, your own Landorus-T, and Gliscor. A Pokemon that deals with Mega Diancie, as it shuts down Heatran completely outside of Lava Plume burns and OHKOes with Earth Power, is also recommended; Ferrothorn, Celebi, Chansey, Mega Scizor, and Mega Venusaur make for excellent partners due to this. Finally, Heatran should not be used as a sole answer for Latios or Scizor, as both have options to bypass it. Ferrothorn, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Clefable are great partners to deal with Earthquake Latios; Clefable is particularly effective, as it deals with many of the other threats mentioned. Mega Manectric, Keldeo, and Choice Scarf Magnezone are a few examples of teammates that can deal with Superpower Mega Scizor.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Heatran often lures in specially defensive walls and bulky stallbreakers, such as Chansey and Mew, and can trap them with Magma Storm; after doing so, Heatran can beat the foe with the combination of Taunt and Toxic. When playing against offensive teams, Magma Storm also deals nice chip damage to common threats to Heatran such as Keldeo and Azumarill, especially when your team has entry hazard users. Trapped foes cannot switch out, helping Heatran gain switch initiative, which really helps against offensive teams. Earth Power nails opposing non-Earth Power variants of Heatran, Tentacruel, and Mega Diancie; it is especially effective because opponents often assume that Leftovers Heatran are not running Earth Power. The move is also a solid option to hit Adamant Excadrill outside of sand without the risk of missing. Taunt is needed to stop Pokemon Heatran has trapped from recovering. It is also great against Calm Mind Clefable specifically, and while Magma Storm may not gain passive damage on this Pokemon, it does still trap it and, paired with Taunt, ensures that Heatran has a good chance beating it providing you do not allow it to get many boosts. Taunt also has the utility of preventing slower Stealth Rock setters from setting up the entry hazard and incoming Defog users from clearing the field of entry hazards. Toxic helps Heatran quickly whittle down threats such as Mew and Chansey, especially after they have been trapped by Magma Storm, as the passive damage racks up and these threats are dispatched of quickly. It also helps wear down common switch-ins such as Azumarill and Keldeo, making this annoying set even more difficult to switch into as well as being necessary to break stall, as it cripples bulky Water-types such as Slowbro. An interesting alternative is Solar Beam, which, combined with Power Herb, provides Heatran with a solid option to deal with Keldeo and Azumarill, which Heatran lures in. Moreover, it pairs well with Magma Storm's trapping capability to eliminate bulky Water-types such as Slowbro from the match. Lastly, Protect is another option that gives Heatran another turn of Leftovers recovery while also stalling out potential poison and Magma Storm damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread lets Heatran outspeed a plethora of threats such as Adamant Excadrill and Jolly Mega Heracross, both of which are decimated by Magma Storm; it also lets Heatran outrun and 2HKO standard bulky Will-O-Wisp Mega Charizard X with Earth Power. Other uses of the spread include outrunning Mega Tyranitar, standard stallbreaker Mew, Adamant Gyarados, Dragonite, Breloom, and Bisharp, giving Heatran the ability to cripple them with a Toxic, prevent setup with Taunt, or fire off a powerful Magma Storm. Maximum Special Attack investment is given to hit as hard as possible, wearing down stall quicker and making Heatran more difficult to switch into when facing against offensive teams. Leftovers is the preferred item due to the usefulness of passive recovery and ability to bluff standard defensive Heatran variants. Air Balloon is also an option if Ground-types, particularly Sand Rush Excadrill, pose a major threat to your team. Power Herb is slashed because it is required if using Solar Beam, eliminating the charge turn of the move and thus actually allowing Heatran to be used as an effective lure.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Playing with this set requires caution and prediction. When facing stall teams, it's usually a good idea to lead with Heatran and try to bait Pokemon such as opposing Heatran or Chansey , which can both usually be beaten, and pave the way for strong special attackers that are walled by Heatran or Chansey, such as Mega Charizard Y, Thundurus, and Volcarona, to break through the opposing team. When playing against more offensively oriented teams, Heatran needs to be played more carefully. Try to get it in on an opposing Scizor, Latios, or Latias and start to spam Magma Storm to wear down switch-ins and get some damage on the opposing team. This is particularly potent when combined with entry hazards to rack up even more residual damage. The choice between Leftovers and Air Balloon has a significant impact on how you use Heatran. With Leftovers, Heatran can be used to bluff a defensive set and claim victims such as Chansey and Heatran. Leftovers also gives Heatran more longevity, something that it loves to have against stall teams. With Air Balloon, Heatran can force a lot of switches against offensive teams against Pokemon such as Choice-locked Landorus-T, becoming a greater issue to deal with due to its temporary Ground immunity. As Air Balloon is a common item on offensive Heatran, keep in mind that the opponent will be more likely to scout for Earth Power. If using Solar Beam, exercise care in not using it unless you are sure it will connect with its intended target, as it is practically useless without the charge turn being eliminated by Power Herb.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set has quite a lot of utility. Heatran packs great resistances and immunities and can be used on just about any team. Steel typing with a Fire immunity lets Heatran check nearly every Grass-type in the game, and it is immune to Toxic and burns, making it a great asset. This set does appreciate entry hazard support in the form of both Spikes and Stealth Rock to help wear down switch-ins which are hit by Magma Storm. Ferrothorn is a great partner, as it can set up both entry hazards and has great synergy with Heatran, dealing with threats such as Kyurem-B, Azumarill, and Mega Gyarados. In general, Heatran is susceptible to strong STAB Fighting-, Water-, and Ground-type attacks. You need to make sure you have an answer for these. Latios and Latias are both great partners for Heatran, as they handle Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y pretty well. It's also worth adding that, against stall, Heatran often loves Healing Wish support from Latias, as it is easily worn down, increasing Latias's utility as a teammate. Landorus-T is also a great partner for Heatran, providing an answer to Earthquake Mega Charizard X, opposing Landorus-T, and Terrakion in addition to Stealth Rock support. Clefable is also worth a mention, as it's a great switch-in to Rotom-W, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gallade, all of which cause major issues for Heatran. Finally, Mega Venusaur partners well with Heatran, as it takes care of Keldeo, Azumarill, Thundurus, and Mega Lopunny.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The main factor that distinguishes this set from more defensive Heatran variants is a powerful Fire Blast, which makes Heatran quite difficult to switch into. Alternatively, Magma Storm can be used to trap and whittle down slower defensive Pokemon such as Clefable, Hippowdon, and Gliscor. Earth Power provides important coverage on the likes of Mega Charizard X, Tentacruel, Mega Diancie, Tyranitar, and opposing Heatran. Flash Cannon targets Fairy-types which Heatran is used to check, such as Mega Altaria, Sylveon, Togekiss, and most notable, Clefable. Hidden Power Ice is another attacking option to hit Gliscor, Garchomp, Dragonite, as well as defensive Landorus-T. Finally, Stealth Rock is a fantastic move on Heatran and one of Heatran's main uses as an offensive Pokemon because Heatran pressures common forms of entry hazard removal. Stone Edge is an option in the third slot to hit the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. If one of the coverage moves in the second or third slots is not necessary due to team support, Taunt or Toxic can be used to cripple the likes of Chansey, Mew, and Water-types in general. Note that these moves work extremely well in tandem with Magma Storm to defeat said Pokemon one-on-one after trapping them.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs are simple yet effective, ensuring that Heatran outspeeds Mew, defensive Landorus-T, Breloom, Bisharp, Adamant Excadrill, and Mega Scizor while giving Fire Blast as much power as possible. Air Balloon is a useful item to cover Heatran's Ground weakness and is particularly useful for teams weak to Sand Rush Excadrill. On the other hand, Leftovers grants Heatran a rather significant amount of added longevity, which can definitely prove helpful in the long-term by making Heatran more difficult to wear down with repeated attacks; however, as this Heatran is generally run on more offensive teams, the utility of Air Balloon outweighs longevity in most cases.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Heatran should be played aggressively, punishing switches with status and breaking down defensive cores with the combination of Fire Blast and Taunt + Toxic. Taunt is also a solid choice to prevent an opposing Pokemon from setting up if required, and Toxic should typically be used on the switch, as Heatran does not want to stay in on the Water-types it wants to target with the move. Heatran should not be pivoted recklessly into attacks, however, as it lacks the longevity required to do so. If the opponent has a Pokemon that Heatran is required to deal with, such as Talonflame or Mega Charizard X, be sure to conserve its HP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is primarily useful on offensively minded teams that appreciate power as opposed to defensive consistency in Heatran. As it is rather easy to wear down due to its lessened bulk and lack of Leftovers if running Air Balloon, don't use it as the team's sole check to Pokemon such as Talonflame and Latios. Its offensive and defensive synergy is one of the primary reasons to put in on a team; its resistances and ability to take advantage of threats such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Clefable can make it a valuable contributor. Air Balloon should generally be used on teams that struggle with offensive Ground-types, particularly Sand Rush Excadrill. Partners to take on Fighting-types and Water-types that can take advantage of Heatran to some extent are crucial; some specific Pokemon that need to be covered are Mega Lopunny, Azumarill, and Keldeo. Mega Venusaur is a perfect partner for this role, handling all three effectively and synergizing well with Heatran overall as Heatran deals with Talonflame and Latios, which threaten Mega Venusaur greatly. Latios and Latias make for solid choices to check Keldeo, and Latias even provides Healing Wish support to increase Heatran's longevity if required. Both can also revenge kill Belly Drum Azumarill, which often uses Heatran as setup fodder. Mega Altaria checks both Mega Lopunny and Keldeo while having a favorable matchup against Azumarill if the Azumarill is a bit weakened and possessing the potential to set up for a sweep on these Pokemon. Mega Manectric, Thundurus, and Mega Sceptile are some other partners that can help pressure Water-types.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Overheat is the preferred STAB option for its sheer nuking power; for instance, Keldeo is only able to switch in once before being 2HKOed the next time it switches in. Its overall damage output, especially against Landorus-T and Mega Lopunny, is rather significantly greater than any of Heatran's other STAB options. That said, Fire Blast is a decent option if the lack of Special Attack drops is valued over a bit more power and accuracy. Flash Cannon is Heatran's secondary STAB attack and is very spammable; it also provides crucial coverage on Mega Diancie, Latios, Mega Altaria, Mega Gardevoir, Clefable, Kyurem-B, Azumarill, Tyranitar, and Terrakion. Earth Power hits Mega Charizard X and opposing Heatran, which are important enough targets to make it a solid move option. Hidden Power Ice is another solid choice for the third moveslot, allowing Heatran to revenge kill +1 Adamant Dragonite if its Multiscale is broken in addition to hitting Garchomp and providing crucial OHKOs on Landorus-T, and non-specially defensive Gliscor (it still 2HKOes specially defensive variants, which is useful). The last slot is filled with either Stone Edge or Ancient Power, which are both Rock-type attacks that are used to hit Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame. Stone Edge is typically the superior choice because it OHKOes Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, even with an Attack-reducing nature, something that Ancient Power does not do. However, Ancient Power is much more forgiving if the opponent chooses to switch out, as it hits off of Heatran's significantly higher Special Attack stat and boasts perfect accuracy as well as the necessary damage output on Mega Charizard X if Hidden Power is chosen over Earth Power. Moves such as Hidden Power Electric to prevent Gyarados from using Heatran as setup fodder and Toxic to cripple bulky Water-types can be substituted in depending on team-specific needs. Flamethrower and even Lava Plume are also options if a reliable STAB attack is desired; Lava Plume is meant to function like Keldeo's Scald, possessing the potential to cripple the likes of Azumarill and Gyarados if they switch into Heatran.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread provides Heatran with enough Speed to outrun Mega Lopunny and maximizes its power so as to increase its revenge killing capabilities. The remaining EVs are placed into HP for a bit of extra bulk. Timid is pretty much the only nature option, as outspeeding Mega Lopunny is crucial; Modest shouldn't be considered for the most part.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is generally meant to be played in a hit-and-run style, firing off an attack and then switching out. That doesn't necessarily mean that Heatran should always be switched out directly after attacking, as it should stay in if it has a favorable matchup, but the opponent's response to Heatran is usually something that forces it out, such as Keldeo or Azumarill. It can sometimes clean late-game with Flash Cannon, but situations that allow for this aren't that common. Although it does have some revenge killing utility, particularly for Dragon Dance Mega Altaria and—if it has Hidden Power Ice—Dragonite, the Choice Scarf is mainly used as a means to hit faster foes with Heatran's powerful attacks. In some scenarios, Heatran can be pivoted into Mega Charizard Y and Mega Gardevoir, though be wary of making this obvious, as they can predict the switch with Focus Blast; it's a decent mix-up if you've been playing around these Pokemon in different ways over the course of the match, however. This Heatran is a pretty poor direct switch-in for attackers such as Talonflame and Latios due to its low defensive investment and lack of Leftovers, so switch it into those Pokemon sparingly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Heatran should be used on offensive and balanced teams that appreciate Heatran's defensive contributions but already have a Stealth Rock user, need a leg up on faster Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, or require Heatran to check Mega Gardevoir and Mega Charizard Y. Azumarill and Keldeo are massive pains for Heatran, being able to switch in at least once depending on the set, making partners such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, Latios, Mega Altaria, Clefable, and Amoonguss effective teammates. Other Talonflame, Latios, and Latias checks are preferable, as this Heatran is not well-equipped to serve as a check to them due to its neutered defensive capabilities; the aforementioned Clefable and Ferrothorn can handle Latios and Latias effectively, while Rotom-W, defensive Landorus-T, Slowbro, and Hippowdon are good answers to Talonflame. In general, the defensive pivots mentioned are crucial so that your team has a safety net when Heatran is inevitably forced out by any of the ubiquitous Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attackers in the tier. Mega Charizard Y is a notable teammate that provides sun support for Heatran, increasing the damage output of Heatran's Overheat or Fire Blast to incredible levels.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Hawlucha has a high base Speed and an excellent ability, Unburden. Thanks to Unburden, Hawlucha's Speed is doubled after its item is removed or consumed, giving it the ability to outpace every unboosted Pokemon in OU. Hawlucha has a great Fighting / Flying typing that grants it excellent coverage as well as a neutrality to Stealth Rock. Hawlucha has a subpar base Attack stat compared to other Pokemon used in OU, which hinders its ability to break through common defensive Pokemon without boosting its Attack. It doesn't take hits very well because of its poor defenses. This limits its role to that of a late-game cleaner that relies heavily on Unburden.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stone Edge can be used to surprise a few Flying-type Pokemon that hope to switch in on High Jump Kick, such as Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, and Zapdos. Keep in mind that it won't have much use against Ground / Flying types such as Landorus-T and Gliscor, however. It's also not worth giving up Substitute's protection from attacks and pseudo-immunity to status. Taunt could also work over Substitute but, unlike Substitute, it fails to protect Hawlucha from attacks. Bulk Up is an alternative method of setting up, but lacks the instant power Swords Dance can provide and Hawlucha is very frail regardless so Defense boosts will not benefit it that well.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Zapdos is Hawlucha's biggest counter because it resists every attack on Hawlucha's moveset. Even at +2 Attack Hawlucha cannot OHKO Skarmory. Hawlucha has to rely on its teammates to weaken the aforementioned Pokemon. Talonflame and Pinsir are huge threats to Hawlucha, as they both can easily KO Hawlucha with their priority Flying-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raikou, Rotom-W, Mega Manectric, Magnezone, and Thundurus can threaten Hawlucha before it activates Unburden. Raikou and Mega Manectric can outspeed and KO Hawlucha with their Electric-type STAB moves. Defensive Rotom-W can take two hits from High Jump Kick and KO or severely weaken Hawlucha. Choice Scarf Magnezone outspeeds and KOes Hawlucha with its Electric-type STAB moves. Thundurus can slow Hawlucha down with Thunder Wave so another teammate can revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Hawlucha fails to OHKO Slowbro after one Swords Dance boost and so has to rely on its teammates to weaken Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Clefable</strong>: Hawlucha's mediocre Attack makes it incapable of KOing Clefable before it's 2HKOed by Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Although non-super effective priority moves will not be able to OHKO Hawlucha, moves such as Azumarill's Aqua Jet, Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, Weavile and Mamoswine's Ice Shard can all be a huge thorn in Hawlucha's side as it cannot effectively set up and attempt to sweep with priority users still around. Talonflame deserves a mention in particular because of Gale Wings which makes revenge killing Hawlucha extremely easy, provided it doesn't have a Substitute.</p>",

      "Substitute + Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute protects Hawlucha from status moves, such as Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Will-O-Wisp and provides it with a way of safely lowering its HP to consume Sitrus Berry and activate Unburden. Because Hawlucha's Attack stat is mediocre compared to other Pokemon in OU, Swords Dance is used to boost its Attack, supplying Hawlucha with the power it needs to pick apart weakened teams late-game. High Jump Kick is the most powerful Fighting-type move that Hawlucha has access to; it is also easily spammable and gives Hawlucha a tool to decimate opposing teams. Acrobatics is another strong and easily spammable attack; after Hawlucha has lost or used its Sitrus Berry, Acrobatics's Base Power is boosted to 110. Flying-type attacks are resisted by very few Pokemon, so Acrobatics should be Hawlucha's most-used move unless the foe is a Rock-, Steel-, or Electric-type.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The 12 HP EVs give Hawlucha an HP value that's divisible by 4, which allows its Sitrus Berry to be consumed after Hawlucha uses Substitute twice, thus activating its ability, Unburden. The remaining EVs are invested in Attack and Speed to maximize Hawlucha's offensive capability. A Jolly nature allows Hawlucha to outspeed a few threats, such as Latios, Latias, Raikou, Terrakion, Keldeo, and Speed tie with opposing Hawlucha before it receives a Speed boost from Unburden.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hawlucha should be used as a mid- or late-game cleaner, as it is most useful after its checks have been eliminated. Because of their Flying-type priority moves, Talonflame and Pinsir are two of its biggest checks and must be KOed before Hawlucha begins to setup. A few defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro, Garchomp, Zapdos, Clefable, and Mew should be weakened or KOed before setting up Swords Dance because Hawlucha has trouble breaking through them. Always switch Hawlucha in on a Pokemon it can force out, such as Chansey; use the free turn to set a Substitute up. After that, use Swords Dance as the switch-in breaks Hawlucha's Substitute. At this point, nothing should be able to outspeed Hawlucha so it should be able to set up another Substitute. Because its HP will drop below 50%, Hawlucha will consume its Sitrus Berry and activate Unburden. With +2 Attack and +2 Speed, Hawlucha is free to pick off the remaining Pokemon. Hawlucha can also be used at certain points mid- and early-game thanks to its high Speed letting it outrun Pokemon like Keldeo and Raikou, allowing it to revenge kill them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A teammate that can check Talonflame and Pinsir is a necessity, as they both can easily KO Hawlucha with their priority Flying-type moves. Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Landorus-T are a few examples of Pokemon that excel at checking Talonflame and Pinsir. A teammate that can easily pressure offensive and defensive teams complements Hawlucha well. Gengar is a great example this because of its versatility and power. Gengar can effortlessly eliminate defensive threats, such as Clefable, Doublade, and Slowbro. Gengar can also get rid of offensive threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, making it significantly easier on Hawlucha to sweep late-game. A teammate that can provide entry hazard support is also vital because entry hazards can wear down the opposing team, making it easier for Hawlucha to perform a late-game sweep. Stealth Rock is the most important entry hazard because it does a great job of limiting the amount of times Flying-type Pokemon can switch in. This is great to deal with Talonflame and Pinsir, as well as defensive checks such as Zapdos.</p> <p>A teammate that does a great job of breaking down defensive Pokemon is extremely useful, as Hawlucha doesn't have the raw power to break through some defensive Pokemon. Mega Gardevoir fits this role perfectly, as it lures Pokemon such as Heatran and Chansey, two walls that Hawlucha has no problem setting up on or KOing. Mega Gardevoir can also KO Pokemon that Hawlucha has trouble dealing with, such as Zapdos, Mew, Clefable, and Slowbro. Adding a teammate that can check Electric-types such as Thundurus, Mega Manectric, and Raikou, would make it easier for Hawlucha to perform late-game sweeps; examples include Mega Latias, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Tyranitar, and Excadrill.</p>"

  "Empoleon": {
    "overview": "<p>By virtue of its great typing, Empoleon is able to check popular Dragon-, Fairy-, and Water-types such as Latios, Mega Altaria, and Manaphy. Access to both Stealth Rock and Defog is also very useful as Empoleon provides great entry hazard control in one teamslot, and it is one of the few Defog users with a resistance to Stealth Rock. However, Empoleon is somewhat passive; it often just sits there hoping for a Scald burn and phazing the foe. It also loses to some of the Pokemon it is supposed to check, such as Clefable, in a last Pokemon situation. Weaknesses to common offensive types in Fighting, Ground, and Electric also hold Empoleon back a little because Pokemon often carry coverage that hit it super effectively. Finally, no reliable recovery and low Speed means Empoleon is worn down pretty easily and cannot keep checking threats the whole game without Wish support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set with the moves Hydro Pump, Flash Cannon, Grass Knot, and either Hidden Power Fire or Ice Beam hits very hard and can bluff the standard defensive set. Empoleon can be a suicide lead with Focus Sash to take advantage of Torrent to fire off powerful Hydro Pumps. It can also get surprise KOs against Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Excadrill, and act as an emergency check to Pokemon such as Mega Altaria with Flash Cannon. Agility and Substitute together with a Petaya Berry make Empoleon a decent sweeper, but one that is lacking in coverage. A physically offensive set with Defiant and Swords Dance can possibly sweep with boosted Aqua Jets, but is weak without a boost and just generally an inferior Defiant user. Flash Cannon hits Fairy-types such as Clefable and Sylveon that Empoleon walls decently hard, but most of the time Empoleon is better off just using Roar as Calm Mind Clefable sets up on it and Sylveon will often switch out of Empoleon anyway. Icy Wind can slow down the foe for another teammate to defeat it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Raikou, Rotom-W, and Thundurus hit Empoleon for super effective damage with their STAB attacks. They do not like poison, however, as Electric-types are often relied upon to defeat Flying-types such as Talonflame and Mega Pinsir that often accompany Empoleon.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Mega Gallade can easily take care of Empoleon with their STAB moves, and set up a Swords Dance or Calm Mind as Empoleon switches out. Assault Vest Conkeldurr can also switch in on anything Empoleon can do and defeat it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Breloom wall Empoleon and can do whatever they want against it.</p> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: Magnezone does a very good job at switching into, trapping, and defeating Empoleon with a STAB Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Due to its massive HP and Special Defense, Chansey can switch in without fear against any Empoleon lacking Knock Off and defeat Empoleon with Seismic Toss.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald has a 30% chance to burn the foe, making physical attackers hesitant to switch in. Roar phazes out setup sweepers such as Manaphy and Clefable that would otherwise set up on Empoleon despite the type disadvantage. Toxic helps in actually defeating Pokemon such as Latios that Empoleon walls but cannot deal a lot of damage against with Scald. Defog removes all entry hazards from the field, which is useful for teammates such as Talonflame and Mega Pinsir that are weak to them. Stealth Rock can be used over either Toxic or Defog depending on what your team needs. Protect grants Empoleon additional Leftovers recovery, racks up poison and burn damage, and can scout moves from Choice-locked Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Keldeo. Knock Off cripples common switch-ins such as Chansey and Ferrothorn, and gives Empoleon a way to deal a lot of damage against some of the Pokemon it walls, such as Latios and Starmie. Yawn can force switches because the opponent does not want their Pokemon asleep, makes Empoleon not a sitting duck against Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and last-Pokemon Clefable's, and grants setup opportunities for teammates.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Empoleon's special bulk so it can effectively wall a lot of threatening Pokemon in OU, such as Latios, Latias, Sylveon, and Mega Altaria. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 200 Def / 60 SpD with a Bold nature can be used, as it enables Empoleon to live an Earthquake from Landorus-T and a Thunderbolt from Mega Manectric and hit them back with a Torrent-boosted Scald. Torrent is used as Defiant is completely useless, because Empoleon uses no physical attacks, and it can power up Empoleon's Scald in a pinch. Leftovers grants Empoleon passive recovery so it is harder to wear down. Chople Berry is an option as it helps Empoleon against Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir, Terrakion, Keldeo, and Gengar by reducing the amount of damage taken from a Fighting-type attack for a turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Empoleon in against Dragon-, Fairy-, and Water-type Pokemon such as Latios, Sylveon, and Manaphy, and set up Stealth Rock or use Defog against them. Empoleon works best as a defensive pivot, switching into common Pokemon such as non-Superpower Azumarill, Heatran, and Clefable, and forcing them out. Empoleon also does great against rain teams as it can check non-Low Kick Kabutops, Omastar, and Kingdra. It is important to avoid Knock Off and burns, because Empoleon has no reliable recovery and is thus not very hard to wear down. It is also favorable to not let the opponent stack too much layers of Spikes, as Empoleon is already worn down easily. Just clicking Scald is almost never a bad idea, as the 30% chance to burn is very useful in wearing the opponent down and crippling physical attackers that might try to switch in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clerics, especially Clefable as it has the best type synergy with Empoleon, are great teammates because they can keep Empoleon healthy with Wish and Heal Bell. Pokemon such as Talonflame and Victini appreciate Empoleon's ability to remove Stealth Rock and other entry hazards. Fire- and Grass-types such as Talonflame and Amoonguss can form a Fire / Water / Grass core together with Empoleon that covers each other's weaknesses very well. Similarly, Dragon- and Fairy-types such as Garchomp and Clefable can form a Dragon / Fairy / Steel core together with Empoleon that also covers each other's weaknesses very well. Empoleon also forms a good core with with Tangrowth and Zapdos as they have great type synergy.</p>"

  "Cresselia": {
    "overview": "<p>Cresselia is a fantastic support Pokemon due to its access to a great signature move in Lunar Dance, which allows it to enable powerful offensive Pokemon that are otherwise dealt with by constant chip damage and status. Meanwhile, its enormous bulk allows it to check a multitude of threats such as Mega Medicham, Mega Diancie, and Mega Metagross. Despite these positive traits, Cresselia is held back by its Psychic typing, which leaves it vulnerable to commonly present Dark-types, such as Weavile, Bisharp, and Tyranitar, as well as Bug-types like Mega Scizor, Mega Heracross, and Volcarona. In addition to this, Cresselia's recovery is often hampered by the presence of sand from Tyranitar. Despite this, Cresselia still manages to play a key role in the tier due to its ability to tank a variety of hits as well as wall key threats such as the aforementioned Mega Medicham.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cresselia's attacking move can be tweaked depending on the team and what Cresselia needs to check. For example, Psyshock lets Cresselia do more damage to Calm Mind Pokemon that have boosted their Special Defense such as Clefable and Keldeo. Moonblast lets Cresselia hit both Fighting- and Dragon-types in the same slot, while Icy Wind can be used to lower a foe's Speed, which can be exploited by a teammate. Trick Room is another option Cresselia can use, but it's not reliable and only lasts five turns. Cresselia can make use of a Colbur Berry or Leftovers; however, both make it much more passive without Rocky Helmet's chip damage. Cresselia can wield a Calm Mind set to attempt to steamroll bulky teams with its huge bulk and stat boosts. However, this set is rather inconsistent due to the commonly used Dark- and Bug-types as well as the presence of status moves such as Toxic, which put Cresselia on a timer.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Weavile and Bisharp are able to deal heavy damage to Cresselia and prevent it from fulfilling its role as a tank. They also remove its crucial item with Knock Off and can also potentially Pursuit trap it.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Volcarona, Mega Scizor, and Mega Heracross are able to threaten heavy damage on Cresselia with their Bug-type moves, giving it little leeway in fulfilling its role as a tank.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-type Pokemon such as Cofagrigus and Gengar are able to take advantage of Cresselia by either crippling it with status in the form of Will-O-Wisp as well as big damage from super effective Ghost-type STAB moves in the form of Hex and Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Item removal from Knock Off greatly hampers Cresselia's ability to check physical attackers, since it relies on damage from Rocky Helmet to force progress against them.</p> <p><strong>Sand</strong>: During sand, Cresselia's healing from Moonlight is halved, which hampers its longevity significantly.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt from Pokemon such as Tornadus-T prevents Cresselia from reviving its teammates with Lunar Dance or spreading paralysis via Thunder Wave, which significantly reduces Cresselia's utility.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Lunar Dance is a must-have, as it allows Cresselia to restore a teammate, giving it a second chance to wreak more havoc. Thunder Wave allows Cresselia to apply pressure despite its passive nature by crippling Pokemon with paralysis. Toxic is a strong alternative that can hit Electric-types and shut down defensive Pokemon. Ice Beam is Cresselia's main attack, since it lets it hit Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Garchomp, which would otherwise wall its Thunder Wave. It also applies pressure to Pokemon such as Serperior, Thundurus, and Dragonite. Psychic can be run instead, allowing Cresselia to hit Pokemon such as Keldeo and Volcanion which otherwise wall Ice Beam variants. Moonlight enables Cresselia to heal itself throughout the course of a game to repeatedly wall offensive threats such as Mega Medicham, Mega Metagross, and Mega Lopunny.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs maximize Cresselia's bulk, allowing it to eat both physical and special hits. 88 EVs are allocated to Special Defense to allow Cresselia to survive two of Mega Alakazam's Shadow Balls after Stealth Rock. 152 Speed EVs allow Cresselia to outspeed Gliscor and Jolly Tyranitar, while the remaining 16 EVs are placed into Defense with a Bold nature to take on physical attackers such as Mega Metagross, Dragonite, and Mega Gallade. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 76 Def / 164 SpD / 16 Spe with a Calm nature can be used to let Cresselia take special hits much better. This particular spread allows Cresselia to survive two sun-boosted Flamethrowers from Mega Charizard Y, with enough Speed EVs to outspeed Crawdaunt, and the rest of the EVs are thrown into Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Generally, Cresselia's main role is to come in on physical attackers to spread Rocky Helmet chip damage, which makes it easier for its teammates to come in and clean up later in the game. Cresselia fits best on more offensive teams, since it acts as a one-size-fits-all defensive plug especially on more offensive structures. Cresselia's ability to take on a variety of attackers while providing Thunder Wave and Lunar Dance support makes it a much-valued member of these offense structures. When using Cresselia, you should avoid letting it get hit by Knock Off, since that removes Cresselia's Rocky Helmet, especially from strong Dark-types such as Weavile and Bisharp who can OHKO it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Mega Lopunny make exceptional partners for Cresselia, since they are natural checks to Dark-types such as Weavile and Bisharp. Mega Lopunny especially makes for a great teammate, since it is both prone to chip damage from opposing Rocky Helmet users as well as status from contact abilities such as Static from Zapdos and Flame Body from Volcarona which Cresselia can cure with Lunar Dance. Pokemon like Zapdos and Thundurus that can cover Cresselia's passivity, especially to Pokemon such as Excadrill, are also greatly appreciated.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick allows Cresselia to cripple Pokemon by giving them a Choice Scarf. Lunar Dance is a staple move that lets Cresselia fulfill its role in fully restoring a near-fainted teammate. Thunder Wave allows Cresselia to cripple key threats such as Mega Alakazam, Mega Gyarados, and Dragonite, which are outsped with Choice Scarf. Ice Beam allows Cresselia to deal heavy damage to Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp while also potentially revenge killing sweepers such as Dragonite and Serperior. However, Psychic can also be run to give Cresselia a STAB move while also allowing it to pressure Fighting-types like Keldeo and Mega Lopunny.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Cresselia to take advantage of Choice Scarf to outspeed key threats such as Mega Alakazam, +1 Mega Tyranitar, Mega Gyarados, and Dragonite. The Speed investment allows Cresselia to outspeed key targets after losing its Choice Scarf, such as Gliscor and defensive variants of Garchomp and Landorus-T. 248 HP EVs maximize Cresselia's bulk, while the remaining EVs are thrown into Special Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cresselia's main goal is to use an emergency Thunder Wave against fast offensive threats. With Trick, it can also provide utility against slower teams by disrupting enemy Pokemon through locking them into one move with Choice Scarf. With maximum Speed, Cresselia is much more likely to get off Lunar Dance than bulky variants, as it can outspeed many of its checks that would otherwise KO it from a weakened position or use Taunt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Partners that can set up such as Calm Mind Keldeo, Quiver Dance Volcarona, and Power-Up Punch Mega Metagross greatly appreciate Cresselia's ability to lock a foe into one move, which can be used as a free setup opportunity. These Pokemon appreciate Cresselia's ability to spread paralysis to cripple checks such as Serperior that might otherwise paralyze them back with Glare. They also appreciate its ability to give them a second chance at boosting through Lunar Dance.</p>"

  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>With a seemingly average defensive and offensive typing, Mega Venusaur may not seem like much, and, to be fair, this instantaneous critique isn't completely unjust. Mega Venusaur's defensive typing leaves it weak to the relatively common Flying- and Psychic-type moves in the OU metagame, which makes Mega Venusaur a liability when facing many common OU threats, including Latios, Mega Metagross, Mega Alakazam, Talonflame, and Tornadus-T, while its offensive typing makes it easily switched into by prevalent bulky Steel-types such as Jirachi, Mega Metagross, and Heatran. Furthermore, as a Mega Evolution, Mega Venusaur lacks Leftovers recovery, and, as a Pokemon with only Synthesis for reliable recovery, it is heavily hurt by sand and rain as well as entry hazards, thus making up a Pokemon very easily worn down.</p> <p>Nevertheless, because of Mega Venusaur's defensive and offensive capabilities, it is a standard Pokemon on stall, balanced, and bulky offensive teams. Its defensive typing is perhaps its biggest asset, giving it resistances to Fighting-, Grass-, Water-, Electric-, and Fairy-type moves, and in tandem with its ability Thick Fat and impeccable bulk, it allows Mega Venusaur to check many common threats in OU, including Keldeo, Mega Altaria, Azumarill, Pursuit Bisharp, Clefable, Mega Diancie, Mega Gyarados, Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, Ferrothorn, and Mega Manectric. Mega Venusaur is also relatively versatile, capable of running an offensive set, more suited to switching into and checking foes with offensive force, or a defensive set that is used more for hard walling threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earthquake can be used on either of the standard sets to cripple Heatran, a very common switch-in. A Life Orb sun sweeper set with Growth can be effective when paired with Mega Charizard Y. Sleep Powder is an option for the defensive set to use on a predicted switch, incapacitating the switch-in and therefore allowing momentum to switch to the side of Mega Venusaur and its team. A Swords Dance set with Power Whip and one of Knock Off or Earthquake can turn Mega Venusaur into a devastating lure and a bulky setup sweeper.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: As long as Mega Venusaur isn't running Earthquake, Heatran will always be able to wall it. However, Leech Seed and Sleep Powder annoy Heatran, and, if it's merely a specially defensive variant, Heatran won't even be able to 3HKO Mega Venusaur. However, Mega Venusaur is unable to do over 10% to it with Giga Drain and is likely to get burned, so Heatran is nevertheless a very good switch-in. Other Fire-types, in spite of Mega Venusaur having Thick Fat as its ability, also deal with it pretty well, with Victini, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Charizard X all acting as solid checks to it.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types are capable of demolishing Mega Venusaur with their STAB moves. Tornadus-T, Togekiss, Talonflame, and Mega Pinsir are all capable of crippling Mega Venusaur with their STAB moves. However, it should be noted that a well-timed Sludge Bomb or Sleep Powder from Mega Venusaur annoys all of them.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Mega Alakazam, Alakazam, Mega Medicham, Mega Gallade, Latios, Latias, Mega Latias, Reuniclus, and Mega Gardevoir all demolish Mega Venusaur with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Provided that Mega Venusaur isn't running Knock Off, Chansey risks nothing by switching into it.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-B</strong>: Kyurem-B's Teravolt allows it to hit Mega Venusaur super effectively with Ice Beam, and therefore it easily 2HKOes defensive variants of Mega Venusaur and OHKOes offensive variants after Stealth Rock damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain allows Mega Venusaur to check Pokemon such as Keldeo, Azumarill, Mega Diancie, and Landorus-T while simultaneously recovering lost HP. Sludge Bomb is a more powerful STAB move that lets Venusaur check Grass- and Fairy-type Pokemon, including Celebi, Breloom, Azumarill, Mega Altaria, and Clefable. It's also a great move to use on a predicted switch, as many Pokemon capable of switching into a Giga Drain and forcing Mega Venusaur out, such as Life Orb Tornadus-T, Latios, Thundurus, Mega Pinsir, and Talonflame, are crippled by Sludge Bomb. Hidden Power Fire lets Venusaur handle the Pokemon that don't mind Giga Drain or Sludge Bomb, including Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Synthesis gives Mega Venusaur semi-reliable recovery, which lets it continually tank hits.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>20 Speed EVs are used to outpace Adamant maximum Speed Azumarill accounting for Hidden Power Fire's IV drop. Maximum EVs are used in Special Attack to allow Mega Venusaur to hit as hard as possible. The rest of the EVs are put in HP so that Mega Venusaur can take hits as well as possible. 100 Speed EVs can be used to outpace Jolly Azumarill, but be aware that this cuts harshly into Mega Venusaur's bulk and that Jolly Azumarill is very rare. Chlorophyll allows Mega Venusaur to revenge kill Pokemon on the turn in Mega Evolves if it is in the sun.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Your first goal when playing Venusaur should be to Mega Evolve as soon as possible, as without being Mega Evolved, Venusaur is hit super effectively by Fire- and Ice-type moves and also has far less bulk. Mega Venusaur does have good bulk, but it's imperative not to switch Mega Venusaur into Pokemon, even those handled by its typing, unless there wouldn't be any negative consequences or the situation is dire. Mega Venusaur has the freedom to switch into Clefable, Rotom-W, Keldeo, Alomomola, Landorus-T, Mega Manectric, and Azumarill, but it needs to be extremely wary of getting worn down, largely from the foe using U-turn or Volt Switch on it, burns, and switching Mega Venusaur into Stealth Rock. Because Mega Venusaur lacks Leftovers recovery, it gets worn down quickly from all of these elements, which severely cuts into its longevity. If you can, avoid switching Mega Venusaur directly into anything, and instead check threats when given a free switch. When selecting a move to use, Giga Drain is your best friend; Mega Venusaur is worn down quickly and really appreciates the recovery Giga Drain gives it. If you get Mega Venusaur in safely and see a Flying- or Dragon-type capable of switching into a Giga Drain and checking Mega Venusaur, use Sludge Bomb, as it does a surprising amount of damage to these potential checks. Additionally, while you can always switch Mega Venusaur safely into Ferrothorn, remember that Mega Venusaur cannot OHKO it with Hidden Power Fire. Overall, your goal with Mega Venusaur should be to switch into Pokemon it beats, deal massive damage, heal, and then switch out before it takes excessive damage. You have to be really careful with Mega Venusaur, because if you play recklessly, Pokemon that Mega Venusaur should be able to beat, such as Mega Diancie, can beat Mega Venusaur instead.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Venusaur absolutely despises being burned by Rotom-W and Keldeo, so Heal Bell or Aromatherapy users and burn absorbers such as Celebi, Clefable, Reuniclus, and Starmie are practically mandatory teammates. Celebi doubles as a counter to both Rotom-W and Keldeo, so it also can take the strain off of Mega Venusaur to deal with these Pokemon. Healing Wish Latias can also prove to be a great teammate, potentially healing Mega Venusaur of any unwanted burns while recovering Mega Venusaur's HP. Mega Venusaur also despises having to take entry hazard damage because entry hazards cut into Mega Venusaur's longevity, which helps Landorus-T and Mega Diancie's beat it. Entry hazard removers such as Latias, Latios, Starmie, Zapdos, Mandibuzz, and Excadrill can therefore make for good teammates. Psychic-types such as Reuniclus, Latios, Latias, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Alakazam also threaten Mega Venusaur. Bronzong can wall Latios, Latias, and Gardevoir, while Bisharp can deal with all of them with either Sucker Punch or Pursuit. Flying-types such as Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, and Tornadus-T are also a problem for Mega Venusaur. Rhyperior can deal with the former two as well as Superpower Tornadus-T, while Zapdos can check the latter two. Tyranitar may seem like a poor teammate, due to its sand nerfing Mega Venusaur's recovery, but Choice Scarf Tyranitar is actually a great one, eliminating Latios, Latias, and Starmie with Pursuit. Similarly to Tyranitar, Hippowdon may seem like a poor teammate because of Sand Stream, but, in reality, it's a great one, checking Flying-types and VoltTurn teams while appreciating Mega Venusaur's role as a Manaphy check. Additionally, to bypass the conflict between Sand Stream and Synthesis, try to use Sand Force Hippowdon when you're using it and Mega Venusaur on the same team.</p> <p>Additionally, Scizor and Conkeldurr can deal with Kyurem-B for Mega Venusaur, while Manaphy, Slowbro, and Landorus-T can deal with Heatran. Chansey is exceptionally annoying for Mega Venusaur to deal with, and as such Victini, Heracross, and Terrakion can make for great teammates. Both offensive and defensive pivots are immensely useful, as they make it easier for Mega Venusaur to switch into moves and give it more time to use Synthesis, therefore bolstering its longevity. Slowbro and Slowking are useful as more defensive pivots with Regenerator, Assault Vest Tornadus-T acts as a defensive Regenerator pivot with U-turn, and Raikou, Scizor, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T can all act as offensive pivots. Essentially, any teammate capable of dealing with a Pokemon that Mega Venusaur cannot makes for a great teammate, as Mega Venusaur's defensive abilities can prove to be a wincon in some games.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain lets Mega Venusaur check Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types such as Keldeo, Azumarill, Landorus-T, and Mega Diancie while recovering some of Mega Venusaur's health. Sludge Bomb acts as a much more powerful STAB move that in spite of the lack of Special Attack investment, can hit neutrally-damaged targets such as Mega Pinsir pretty hard. However, its main purpose is to allow Mega Venusaur to check Fairy- and Grass-types such as Clefable, Sylveon, Breloom, and Serperior. Synthesis provides semi-reliable recovery, which lets Mega Venusaur easily stall out many more Pokemon. Hidden Power Fire lets Mega Venusaur deal with Scizor and Ferrothorn, although Knock Off can be used instead to hurt Latios on the switch and to allow Mega Venusaur to check Gengar while removing its Life Orb. Leech Seed is another option, whittling away at a foe's HP while simultaneously recovering Venusaur's HP.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>20 Speed EVs are used outpace Adamant maximum Speed Azumarill accounting for Hidden Power Fire's IV drop. However, only 16 Speed EVs are needed if you choose to run Knock Off or Leech Seed. Maximum HP investment is used for better neutral bulk, and 144 Special Defense EVs are used to cushion powerful special attackers such as Keldeo, specifically allowing it to take one Life Orb-boosted Psychic from Alakazam. The rest of the EVs are put in Defense to allow maximum physical walling potential, while Chlorophyll allows Mega Venusaur to revenge kill Pokemon in the sun.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Defensive Mega Venusaur is a lot bulkier than offensive Mega Venusaur, so it struggles less with taking passive damage. However, Stealth Rock damage and burns still bother it immensely and should be avoided at all costs. Regardless, countering Pokemon such as Attack-invested Mega Diancie, Earth Plate Landorus-T, and Life Orb Mamoswine is a lot easier now because of the added bulk, which gives Mega Venusaur more wiggle room in taking entry hazard damage. Still, you should try to Mega Evolve as soon as possible, because not having Thick Fat while having lower defenses is not ideal for a wall. Once in, you should use the move that'll help the most in the given scenario. It'll usually be Giga Drain, because the name of the game when playing Mega Venusaur, especially defensive Mega Venusaur, is recovering health. However, don't be afraid to use one of your other moves, namely Sludge Bomb if you're expecting a Flying-, Grass-, Fairy-, or Dragon-type switch-in, Knock Off if you're expecting Latios, Latias, or Gengar, or Leech Seed if you're expecting anything other than a Grass-type. Also, remember that when defensive, Mega Venusaur loses a lot of its offensive prowess and thus cannot OHKO or 2HKO some Pokemon that it used to be able to, such as Mega Diancie, Landorus-T, and Mega Altaria.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Heal Bell, Aromatherapy, Healing Wish, and burn absorption support is crucial for Mega Venusaur's success in OU, as it'll often find itself switching into Scald and possibly Will-O-Wisp, so Celebi, Starmie, Reuniclus, Clefable, and Latias can make for good teammates. Excadrill, Starmie, Latios, Latias, Zapdos, and Mandibuzz can all remove entry hazards, and therefore can act as useful teammates for Mega Venusaur, reducing the amount of passive damage it's forced to endure. Psychic-types such as Reuniclus, Latios, Latias, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Alakazam all threaten Mega Venusaur immensely. Bronzong can wall Latios, Latias, and Gardevoir while Bisharp can deal with them all with Pursuit and Sucker Punch. Flying-types such as Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, and Tornadus-T are also a problem; to remedy this problem, Rhyperior can be used as a teammate to deal with the former two as well as Superpower Tornadus-T, while Zapdos can be used to check the latter two. Pokemon capable of dealing with Heatran, such as Manaphy, Slowbro, and Landorus-T, can also prove to be great teammates, as can Pokemon that are able to deal with Chansey, such as Heracross, Victini, and Reuniclus.</p> <p>Hippowdon can also act as a great teammate, checking Flying-types as well as VoltTurn teams, which are known for being able to wear Mega Venusaur down, while appreciating Mega Venusaur's ability to act as a Manaphy check. In spite of this, be aware that Sand Stream inhibits Mega Venusaur's recovery, so Sand Force is likely the best ability choice. Slowking, Slowbro, Assault Vest Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Raikou can all act as pivots that augment Mega Venusaur's recovering capacity. The first three are able pivots thanks to Regenerator, while the latter four are great because they have access to either U-turn or Volt Switch. Basically, any teammate capable of dealing with a Pokemon that Mega Venusaur cannot makes for a great teammate.</p>"

  "Charizard": {
    "overview": "<p>Blessed with being the only Pokemon in OU with two Mega Evolutions, Charizard has found both of them to be top-tier threats. The first forme, Mega Charizard X, is known to be one of the best Dragon Dancers in the entire tier; the combination of a base 130 Attack and essentially a 1.33x boost on both of its main STAB moves thanks to Tough Claws allows it to OHKO most foes at +1 with STAB Flare Blitz, meaning it can sweep almost effortlessly through teams, especially given how easy it is to set up with such a great defensive typing. Furthermore, Mega Charizard X can utilize its amazing typing, bulk, and movepool to be very unpredictable; it can run a variety of sets, including a defensive set that utilizes Will-O-Wisp and even a Double Dance set that contains both Swords Dance and Tailwind to bring the pain on both defensive and offensive teams, respectively. Given all these traits, Mega Charizard X is simply one of the best Pokemon in OU and offers a lot as a Mega Evolution.</p> <p>The second forme, Mega Charizard Y, is the most powerful wallbreaker in OU. At first glance, Mega Charizard Y's amazing Fire STAB type and base 159 Special Attack make it appear to be a powerful wallbreaker in and of themselves. However, Mega Charizard Y's claim to fame is its ability, Drought, which boosts its STAB Fire Blast's power even further, allowing it to OHKO or severely dent a significant portion of the tier, and makes Solar Beam a 120-Base Power Grass attack that takes only one turn to use, nullifying Water-types as possible checks. With Focus Blast rounding out the coverage, most of the metagame is in huge danger to Mega Charizard Y bar a select few—these are mostly limited to opposing Dragon-types such as Latios, Latias, Dragonite, Mega Altaria, and bulky Mega Charizard X and dedicated special walls such as Chansey and Cresselia. All of the aforementioned Pokemon are very easy to take advantage of, however; with the use of stallbreakers and Pursuit trappers, it is easy enough to clear a path for Mega Charizard Y. Outside of these Pokemon, Mega Charizard Y simply will dent the opponent's team every time it comes in, provided it can hit.</p> <p>However, Charizard's base 100 Speed for both formes is no more than good and leaves it outpaced in such a quick metagame, which is compounded by a quadruple Stealth Rock weakness that severely hinders it from executing its job effectively—it is very easy to take advantage of this with the use of priority moves or faster attackers that can finish it off at such low health. Mega Charizard Y is an extremely easy Pokemon to pressure; while it OHKOes an absurd number of Pokemon, it often can be outsped and KOed by faster Pokemon unless it switches out, which can ruin the momentum at times. Mega Charizard X, on the other hand, is worn down very quickly between Stealth Rock damage, Flare Blitz recoil, and general miscellaneous damage. This makes it harder to sweep and wallbreak to an extent. However, despite these flaws, Charizard is no less than a metagame-defining Pokemon and should be looked at as such.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iron Tail is an alternate coverage move for Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X to hit Mega Altaria, which otherwise gives the set trouble because it resists both of Mega Charizard X's STAB moves and takes only neutral damage from Earthquake. Mega Charizard X can use a set of Roost and three attacks in order to combine its excellent dual STAB types, coverage, and longevity, but it faces stiff competition from other wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B and Latios.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>There are no Pokemon that hard counter Charizard, as it has such impressive stats and diversity in its sets. It does have a variety of checks depending on the set, though, which must be scouted first.</p> <p><strong>Respective Defensive Pokemon</strong>: While Charizard's Mega Evolutions require different responses, they do in fact have defensive answers, albeit rather few. Mega Altaria is a solid check to both Mega Charizard formes, as it resists Mega Charizard X's STAB combination and can threaten to set up a Dragon Dance, while Mega Charizard Y's coverage of Fire / Grass / Fighting is ineffective against Mega Altaria. Mega Charizard X is very difficult to switch into, especially because it can boost its Attack. Assuming the standard offensive sets (as Will-O-Wisp from the defensive one greatly cripples many potential answers), Quagsire, Landorus-T, Rhyperior, and Hippowdon are its most reliable counters, all of which threaten it with STAB Earthquake. However, Quagsire can be 2HKOed by Outrage, Landorus-T and Rhyperior lack reliable recovery, and Hippowdon, even with full Defense investment, can be worn down with entry hazards until Mega Charizard X can force its way past it. Slowbro can recover off damage and doesn't care too much about Will-O-Wisp, though it is actually OHKOed by +1 Outrage from a Dragon Dance set after some prior damage; however, this is not the case with Mega Slowbro, which can tank an attack and proceed to use Thunder Wave or Scald. Although typically not physically defensive, Heatran can stomach many hits and stall with Toxic if Mega Charizard X lacks Earthquake. Azumarill gets a special mention for resisting every common attack Mega Charizard X has while not being weak to Earthquake; however, like most of the aforementioned Pokemon, it is severely crippled by Will-O-Wisp. Additionally, Assault Vest Azumarill can beat Mega Charizard Y one-on-one, making it a solid check to that. Mega Charizard Y's reliable switch-ins are also limited to specialized specially defensive Pokemon. Blissey and Chansey wall Mega Charizard Y hard and can heal back the damage while stalling it out with Seismic Toss or Toxic. Assault Vest Goodra is also notable for taking a pittance from its attacks and can attack back with hard-hitting moves, though it can be a poor choice against other Pokemon in the metagame, as it lacks reliable recovery, meaning that it can be worn down over a game's span. Hippowdon's sand limits Solar Beam to being a two-turn move and halves its power, and Hippowdon can use this opportunity to OHKO Mega Charizard Y with Rock Slide or Stone Edge. Politoed can also do this, except it summons rain instead of sand, which decreases the power of Fire Blast. Physically defensive Gliscor can beat Mega Charizard X due to its access to STAB Earthquake and high defenses, given that it has not taken any prior damage. Bulky Tyranitar can beat Mega Charizard X too, as it can take an Earthquake and retaliate with Stone Edge. Specially defensive Gyarados can check Mega Charizard X with Intimidate and can even counter Mega Charizard Y by being able to hit it hard with Waterfall even in sun and by resisting its main STAB move and not taking much from Solar Beam or Focus Blast. Cresselia can check both Mega Charizard formes with its enormous bulk and can threaten with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Offensively Inclined Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Mega Charizard X has very few answers outside of revenge killing it or using a dedicated defensive Pokemon on a stall or balanced team. However, Mega Charizard Y has a few common offensive responses that can actually switch into it. Without the rare Earthquake, Mega Charizard Y lacks good coverage against Fire-type Pokemon, though Drought's power boost allows it to often 2HKO frailer ones. Opponents can rely on bulkier Fire-types as good offensive responses. Specially defensive Talonflame can take Mega Charizard Y's typical attacks very easily and wear it down with Brave Bird. Mega Charizard X itself also hard walls any set without the rare and suboptimal Dragon Pulse and can proceed to set up on it or hit Mega Charizard Y hard with its powerful Dragon-type attacks. Entei risks being 2HKOed by Fire Blast or Focus Blast, but it can tank one of these attacks in a pinch and respond with Stone Edge or Extreme Speed. Fire-types aren't the only offensive answers, though; many Dragon-types can function similarly as checks, sometimes even if it is carrying Dragon Pulse. Latios, Latias, and Garchomp are all faster than Mega Charizard Y and can tank at least one attack before hitting back with a powerful attack of their own. Specially defensive Dragonite can also tank Mega Charizard Y's attacks with the aid of Multiscale and set up or attack it. RestTalk Mega Ampharos is a powerful Pokemon that can switch into Mega Charizard Y and use a powerful Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Mega Charizard Y's Speed is rather average and isn't boosted by any move on its common sets. This makes it very vulnerable to revenge killing from powerful Pokemon with super effective STAB moves. Thundurus, Terrakion, Keldeo, Mega Diancie, and many other common threats all possess super effective or very strong neutral moves while outspeeding it naturally. When using a Choice Scarf, some other common Pokemon such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, Diggersby, and Tyranitar can also surprise and revenge kill it. Revenge killing Mega Charizard X is a bit more complex, though it is almost always the most practical solution for defeating it when using an offensive team. Not all Choice Scarf users can outspeed it after a boost, however. At +1 Speed, Adamant Mega Charizard X can be revenge killed by a few Choice Scarf users, including Garchomp, Terrakion, Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Kyurem-B, all of which can OHKO it with their STAB moves. With a Jolly nature, however, only the first two listed Pokemon can outpace it. While priority would normally be an answer, Mega Charizard X is physically bulky enough to withstand a couple of Ice Shards, Mach Punches, Aqua Jets, and Bullet Punches, with Roost to heal any damage that is racked up through a combination of priority moves. Talonflame's Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird gets a special mention, though, as it can deal up to 86% damage instantly to offensive variants. To an extent, Thunder Wave from Prankster Thundurus is also problematic because it completely nullifies Mega Charizard X's Speed boosts, making it susceptible to a wider range of revenge killers. Sand is a very effective way to beat both Mega Charizard formes, as Mega Charizard X and Y aren't able to break through Hippowdon and the former isn't able to beat bulky Tyranitar, while Excadrill in the sand outspeeds and OHKOes both. Mega Aerodactyl can outspeed both sets if they're not boosted and can OHKO them with Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Both of Charizard's Mega Evolutions are susceptible to an overload of passive damage. Mega Charizard X is more affected by this, as it takes recoil damage from Flare Blitz. However, some bulky Ground-types can use Toxic on either Mega Evolution before being 2HKOed, which allows them to wear Charizard down slowly. Perhaps the most significant form of passive damage that can be inflicted on either Charizard is Stealth Rock, which strips non-Mega-Evolved Charizard and Mega Charizard Y of half their health; Mega Charizard X still takes a heavy 25% damage from the entry hazard. Another issue is Ferrothorn, which, while OHKOed by Mega Charizard X's Flare Blitz, inflicts Iron Barbs recoil in addition to the regular Flare Blitz recoil.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance simultaneously boosts Mega Charizard X's Attack and Speed, allowing it to sweep weakened teams. Flare Blitz in tandem with Tough Claws provides ridiculous damage output, capable of OHKOing many foes unboosted and severely denting almost everything in the metagame at +1. To give a measure of its power, Mega Charizard X's unboosted Flare Blitz matches the power of +2 Adamant Garchomp's Dragon Claw. Dragon Claw completes the feared Dragon / Fire coverage and is a safe option to use against Water-types as well as when the player wishes to avoid recoil. Roost keeps Mega Charizard X healthy and helps mitigate Flare Blitz recoil as well as avoid Sucker Punch mind games. Earthquake is an option that allows Mega Charizard X to beat Heatran and bulky variants of Tyranitar, but the extra longevity provided by Roost is generally more useful. Fire Punch is an option over Flare Blitz if recoil tends to be a problem, but it is seriously discouraged due to its significantly lower damage output.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment is used to hit as hard as possible, and a Jolly nature is used to outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Jolly Choice Scarf Excadrill, Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, and Modest Choice Scarf Keldeo. This spread also allows Mega Charizard X to outspeed neutral-natured base 100 Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir and Mega Medicham as well as most Kyurem-B before a Dragon Dance. Alternatively, a slightly bulkier spread of 104 HP / 220 Atk / 184 Spe can be used to have a good chance to survive two Hydro Pumps from Rotom-W while still outspeeding Choice Scarf Landorus-T after a boost and OHKOing uninvested Landorus-T after Stealth Rock damage. If outspeeding the previously mentioned Choice Scarf users after a boost is not a concern, a spread of 96 HP / 252 Atk / 160 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Excadrill, Jolly Mega Scizor, and Mega Heracross while providing a noticeable boost in power. Running an Adamant nature specifically allows Mega Charizard X to 2HKO Azumarill after Stealth Rock damage and grants a high chance at 2HKOing mixed defensive Hippowdon after Stealth Rock damage. Blaze is the chosen ability before Mega Evolving despite being very situational, as Solar Power would accomplish nothing other than reducing HP at times.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It's best to set up Dragon Dance towards the end of the game, when Mega Charizard X's checks and counters are out of play or have been weakened enough to be picked off after a boost. Mega Charizard X should set up on Pokemon that it forces out, such as Mega Scizor and Celebi, or against Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Raikou. If running HP investment, Rotom-W is an easy target to set up on, as it can't 2HKO Mega Charizard X with Hydro Pump and is stalled out with Roost. Take note of Charizard's typing change upon Mega Evolving; for example, not Mega Evolving against Latios after it uses Draco Meteor allows Mega Charizard X to safely set up Dragon Dance on it, whereas Mega Charizard X sets up on non-Thunder Wave Thundurus with ease thanks to its neutrality to Hidden Power Ice and resistance to Thunderbolt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal is an absolute must, as having Charizard lose half its health makes a huge difference in the game. Excadrill is the best option for this, as it can remove hazards with Rapid Spin while preserving your own and has good synergy in general with Mega Charizard X. In addition, Swords Dance Excadrill can severely weaken physically bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Slowbro to assist Mega Charizard X's sweep. The two of them also pair very well on sand teams, as Mega Charizard X can set up on or deal immense amounts of damage to the likes of Rotom-W, Celebi, and Mega Venusaur, which are bothersome to common Pokemon on these archetypes. Latios can nuke the opposition while using support options such as Tailwind and Memento to prepare for a sweep, in addition to clearing entry hazards for Mega Charizard X with Defog. Mew can support Mega Charizard X with Defog, while Mega Charizard X can absorb Knock Off for it. Powerful physical attackers such as Garchomp, Talonflame, and Terrakion can weaken or overwhelm Mega Charizard X's checks and counters. Grass-types such as Celebi and Serperior put immense amounts of pressure on the bulky Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types that are used to check Mega Charizard X. In addition, Celebi can take further advantage of these Pokemon by setting up a Substitute and passing it to Mega Charizard X for safety during setup. Chesnaught and Tangrowth work as well to combat sand teams, which are problematic for Mega Charizard X. Jirachi is a very notable teammate, as it can provide Healing Wish support, check Mega Altaria and Mega Diancie, and lure in bulky Water- and Ground-types and KO them with Grass Knot. Water-types such as Manaphy and Azumarill also pressure Rock- and Ground-types that bother Mega Charizard X, and the former can break down defensive cores for Charizard to clean up late-game.</p>"
      },
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>In the sun provided by Mega Charizard Y's Drought, Fire Blast OHKOes or 2HKOes nearly all Pokemon that don't resist it as well heavily denting those that do. Flamethrower is a slightly less powerful alternative that is more reliable due to its perfect accuracy. Solar Beam doesn't require an extra turn to charge thanks to the sun, and it hits Water-types such as Azumarill, Suicune, Slowking, Slowbro, and Manaphy for great damage. Focus Blast rounds off Mega Charizard's coverage, targeting Tyranitar and Heatran. Roost keeps Mega Charizard Y healthy and somewhat mitigates Stealth Rock damage. Alternatively, Earthquake deals significantly more damage to Heatran than Focus Blast, but it does pitiful damage to Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment is used to hit as hard as possible. A Timid nature allows Mega Charizard Y to Speed tie with other positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon, namely Manaphy, as well as Jolly Excadrill outside of sand and maximum Speed Kyurem-B. If outspeeding these Pokemon is not required, a Modest nature can be used for a significant increase in Mega Charizard Y's wallbreaking potential. If using a Modest nature, a spread of 40 HP / 252 SpA / 216 Spe provides some bulk while still outspeeding neutral-natured maximum Speed Kyurem-B. Note that Fire Blast is best used with a Timid nature and Flamethrower is best used with a Modest nature, as the high power of Fire Blast makes up for the decrease in power by not using a Special Attack-boosting nature; conversely, when using a Modest nature, Mega Charizard Y can afford to use a slightly weaker move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Charizard Y is best played as an early- and mid-game wallbreaker, utilizing its high-powered STAB moves along with its near-perfect complementary coverage movepool. The best way for Charizard to get in safely is through a double switch, a Volt Switch, or U-turn user. However, more aggressive plays such as switching into Ferrothorn's Stealth Rock or Clefable's Moonblast can be useful depending on the given situation. Note that the risk of such plays can result in Mega Charizard Y being crippled by a potential Leech Seed or Thunder Wave. Keeping Stealth Rock off the field is important to maximize Mega Charizard Y's wallbreaking, as if Mega Charizard Y takes Stealth Rock damage, it is forced to use Roost more often and thus waste turns that could have been used to attack. Take advantage of the switches Mega Charizard Y tends to force into the likes of Latias, Latios, and Chansey in order to pressure them with a double switch into the appropriate teammate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal is one of the most important aspects to cover with Mega Charizard Y's teammates, so the likes of Excadrill, Latios, and Latias make for good partners. In addition to providing Rapid Spin support, Excadrill has good offensive synergy with Mega Charizard Y, as it can break past some of the specially bulky Pokemon that Mega Charizard struggles with while in return Mega Charizard Y can plow through physically bulky Pokemon such as Rotom-W and defensive Landorus-T. Latios and Latias provide useful resistances to Water- and Electric-type attacks, and the latter provides Healing Wish support so that Mega Charizard Y can be played more recklessly at times. Mew is another option for Defog support, as it can reliably beat Chansey one-on-one with the use of Taunt and Knock Off. Pursuit support from the likes of Tyranitar, Weavile, and Assault Vest Metagross is essential to remove Latios and Latias, both of which are some of Mega Charizard Y's most common offensive checks. In addition, these Pokemon can either cripple Chansey, in the case of Weavile and Bisharp, or heavily dent it with their STAB moves. Other Pokemon to deal with Chansey, including Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Keldeo, make for good teammates too.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Will-O-Wisp": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers and spreads residual damage, deterring the likes of Landorus-T, Azumarill, and Tyranitar from switching in. Even with minimal Attack investment, Flare Blitz hits very hard against neutral targets. Flare Blitz is also important to deal substantial damage to Clefable. Roost heals half of Mega Charizard's HP, extending its longevity. Earthquake targets Heatran, which gives Mega Charizard X problems, as it can absorb Will-O-Wisps and Flare Blitzes due to Flash Fire. Dragon Claw is an alternative option that doubles as a reliable STAB move; it is especially useful to hit opposing Dragon-types that don't mind being burned by Will-O-Wisp such as Latios, Latias, and Hydreigon, which otherwise could gain offensive momentum by pivoting into an Earthquake or a Flare Blitz given they are healthy. Dragon Claw also hits Mega Charizard Y, which this set can check in a pinch. Dragon Tail can be used to phaze setup sweepers such as Manaphy and Reuniclus and is useful to rack up entry hazard damage. However, it is not fully accurate and is significantly weaker than Dragon Claw.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs are used to minimize the damage taken from Stealth Rock. 160 Speed EVs allow Mega Charizard X to outspeed Adamant Excadrill, Jolly Mega Scizor, and Jolly Bisharp. The rest of the EVs are placed into Defense alongside an Impish nature, which subsequently allows Mega Charizard X to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Metagross's Zen Headbutt and Life Orb Weavile's Icicle Crash from full HP. A specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 200 SpD / 60 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used to better handle the likes of Nasty Plot Thundurus and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pivot into Pokemon that Mega Charizard X checks, such as Mega Scizor, Weavile, and Volcarona. Early-game, throw out Will-O-Wisps in order to cripple Mega Charizard X's typical switch-ins and spread residual damage on the opposing team. Choosing the time to Mega Evolve can be very important at times when one set of resistances is more important than the other, such as when spamming Roost on Latios's Draco Meteor before Mega Evolving. Be sure to keep entry hazards off the field and preserve Charizard throughout the match if your opponent has a threat that Mega Charizard X checks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal is very important for Mega Charizard X due to its crippling weakness to Stealth Rock. Due to how this set fits best on more balanced or defensive teams, the likes of Skarmory and Mew make for very good teammates to fulfill the role of entry hazard remover. Skarmory has excellent type synergy with Mega Charizard X, as it covers Ground- and Dragon-types to some degree while Mega Charizard X checks Fire- and Electric-types, which bother Skarmory. Mew appreciates having a bulky Mega Evolution to fall back on to absorb Knock Offs, as without Leftovers, it is pressured to use a recovery move more frequently. Regenerator Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Slowbro, Slowking, and Amoonguss pair well with Mega Charizard X, as they fit on the balanced builds that this set is typically used on and appreciate Mega Charizard X's pivot support. Physical sweepers such as Swords Dance Garchomp appreciate the likes of Landorus-T and Slowbro being whittled down by Will-O-Wisp.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance doubles Mega Charizard X's Attack, allowing it to plow through defensive cores. Roost is an alternative to provide Mega Charizard X with recovery, allowing it to heal off recoil and entry hazard damage. Flare Blitz is boosted by Tough Claws and deals massive damage to anything that does not resist it, even heavily denting some less bulky Pokemon that do resist it. Dragon Claw is a reliable secondary STAB move that hits most Pokemon that resist Fire for solid damage and has the benefit of not making Mega Charizard X suffer recoil damage, unlike Flare Blitz. Outrage is significantly more powerful than Dragon Claw, most notably 2HKOing Quagsire and having a high chance to OHKO Slowbro at +2, but it has the cost of locking Mega Charizard X into the move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature is used to hit as hard as possible, and 216 Speed EVs allow Mega Charizard X to outspeed maximum Speed neutral-natured Kyurem-B and below. A Jolly nature can be used to Speed tie with opposing positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon and outspeed neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon as well as Jolly Excadrill outside of sand, but without an Adamant nature, Mega Charizard X loses out on quite a bit of wallbreaking power, most notably losing the ability to OHKO Azumarill after Stealth Rock with a +2 Flare Blitz.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With this set, it is important to assess the given matchup to determine how Mega Charizard X should be played throughout the game. Versus more offensive teams, it is generally best to just outright attack when Mega Charizard X forces a switch early- or mid-game and, if possible. Against balanced and defensive builds, set up a Swords Dance when Mega Charizard X forces a switch on the likes of Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and defensive Starmie. Don't set up if your opponent has a Quagsire; using Outrage on a forced switch is more beneficial. If possible, eliminate Unaware and Prankster Pokemon before attempting to set up in order to give Mega Charizard X much more breathing room. While Mega Charizard X can break through Quagsire with two Outrages and Clefable is cleanly 2HKOed by Flare Blitz, eliminating Quagsire means that Charizard doesn't have to lock itself into Outrage (or can forgo it for Dragon Claw), and eliminating Clefable is helpful because it can stall Mega Charizard X out between Wish and Protect. In most other scenarios, using Outrage generally has more risk than reward, so be wary of locking Mega Charizard X into the move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal is very important, so teammates such as Excadrill, Latios, and Starmie fit well. Sand Rush Excadrill greatly appreciates Mega Charizard X's wallbreaking ability so it can clean up late-game versus offensive teams. Excadrill also appreciates Mega Charizard X's ability to set up on and eliminate Rotom-W and remove Slowbro if it is running Outrage. Azelf and Klefki can provide dual screens support, and the former provides Stealth Rock to wear down Mega Charizard X's checks and Explosion to get it in safely. Grass-types such as Celebi and Serperior have good offensive synergy with Mega Charizard X, most notably being able to pressure or eliminate Quagsire, which is a major nuisance to Mega Charizard X because it ignores its boosts with Unaware. Swords Dance Mega Charizard X struggles versus offensive teams, so fast Pokemon that perform well against those such as Weavile and Choice Scarf Jirachi pair well with it; the latter also provides Healing Wish support to give Mega Charizard X another chance at sweeping.</p>"

  "Beedrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Beedrill's Attack and Speed increase drastically upon Mega Evolving, turning what is arguably one of the worst Pokemon in the game into a terrifying glass cannon with the stats and ability to make its attacks really sting. Despite its newfound stat increases and ability making its STAB attacks incredibly powerful, it has poor coverage and still remains incredibly frail. On top of its frailty, it has a weakness to Stealth Rock that limits the number of times it can come in.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Beedrill doesn't really have any other effective options. Toxic Spikes, Swords Dance, and Defog might have merit in theory, but the only place they could fit is on Beedrill's coverage moveslot, as Protect is mandatory to Mega Evolve safely, and it does not have any bulk to utilize these moves effectively. Pursuit is another option to trap Pokemon such as Latias, Latios, and Starmie.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Beedrill is difficult to check with defensive Pokemon or Pokemon that resist its moves because of its ability to U-turn out without taking any damage. However, it still has switch-ins and methods of being checked effectively; defensive ones just aren't always perfect at the job because they don't punish Beedrill for getting momentum with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Beedrill likes to use U-turn frequently in order to keep up momentum. It is pretty difficult to land a hit on it directly due to its great Speed, so keeping up Stealth Rock is helpful as it will limit Beedrill to four switch-ins.</p> <p><strong>Priority and Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Beedrill may be fast, but it will not be able to outspeed Choice Scarf users with over base 80 Speed, such as Landorus-T, Keldeo, and Latios. It also has pitiful defenses, so priority attacks will deal significant damage to it if it has taken Stealth Rock damage or been weakened a bit in some other manner.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Landorus-T, Hippowdon, Gliscor, Alomomola, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor can all take a hit from Beedrill, and some are immune to poison. Be wary of the combination of Knock Off and a trapper if using Skarmory, however.</p> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Iron Barbs</strong>: Rocky Helmet on Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Skarmory, Alomomola, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn can punish Beedrill for using U-turn, causing it to lose almost 17% of its health in the process. Garchomp and Ferrothorn are particularly effective because of their abilities Rough Skin and Iron Barbs, respectively; when these abilities are combined with Rocky Helmet, Beedrill loses a total of 29.2% of its health by going for U-turn. Even without Rocky Helmet, these Pokemon are capable of punishing Beedrill's U-turn effectively by virtue of their abilities alone.</p>",

      "U-turn": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Protect is a necessity seeing as Beedrill does not get the Speed boost on the turn it Mega Evolves. Protect also enables it to scout movesets, Choice items, and potential priority attacks. U-turn is Beedrill's go-to move to gain momentum and just a very powerful move in general to get chip damage. Poison Jab is Beedrill's strongest attack and has a great secondary chance of poisoning the opponent. Poison along with Protect helps Beedrill wear down opposing Pokemon. Knock Off is one of the most versatile moves in the game and does exceptionally well against stall. Using Knock Off on Steel-types with Shed Shell can allow a Magnet Pull user to trap them later on in the game. Knock Off really excels at dealing with a lot of Beedrill's checks; Landorus-T, Heatran, and Magnezone do not appreciate their items being removed, and Gengar gets OHKOed by it. Meanwhile, Drill Run is primarily for Steel-types without Levitate, such as Heatran, Excadrill, and Magnezone, that resist both Beedrill's STAB attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread makes Mega Beedrill as powerful as possible and lets it outspeed threats such as +1 Mega Altaria, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Manectric while Speed tying with opposing Mega Beedrill and Mega Sceptile.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is incredible at maintaining momentum, so keeping up pressure with entry hazards is a great way to weaken the opposing team little by little. Try to keep entry hazards off your side of the field, as Mega Beedrill is quite frail and has a chance to get OHKOed by priority users such as Mamoswine and Dragonite after just one switch into Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Landorus-T and Rotom-W work pretty effectively as a core with Beedrill. They're both great pivots and have access to U-turn and Volt Switch respectively. Magnezone pairs up very nicely if Beedrill is utilizing Knock Off for Shed Shell Steel-types and also has the ability to form a VoltTurn core with Beedrill. Choice Scarf Magneton may not be as powerful or bulky as Magnezone, but it is capable of outspeeding base 115 to 130 Speed Pokemon that Magnezone cannot outspeed. Latias, Latios, and Excadrill are great partners for keeping Stealth Rock off the field, which ultimately gives Beedrill more opportunities to stay in the game.</p>"

  "Nidoking": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoking is a very scary wallbreaker in the OU metagame thanks to its huge offensive movepool, as well as Sheer Force bolstering its power even further. Its Poison / Ground typing allows it to function as a very solid Clefable switch-in, and thus it has a great matchup against balanced teams that use Clefable. However, despite being able to easily beat one of the biggest threats in the metagame, Nidoking has its fair share of flaws that prevent it from being a top-tier threat. Nidoking's Speed leaves it outpaced by the majority of offensive threats, though it outspeeds Pokemon like Mega Altaria, Gardevoir prior to Mega Evolution, and Heatran. Nidoking also lacks bulk, leaving it vulnerable to faster attackers and priority users. Furthermore, it faces strong competition from other wallbreakers such as Manaphy, Gengar, Alakazam, and Kyurem-B because they are either faster, stronger, or bulkier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nidoking has access to Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, but it would rather run an extra coverage move. It also faces strong competition as a Toxic Spiker from Dragalge and Scolipede. Nidoking can run Choice Scarf in order to improve its matchup against offensive teams, but it loses out on too much power and thus can't wallbreak effectively. Nidoking can run Superpower to deal extra damage to Chansey and Air Balloon Heatran, but this usually requires a lot more Attack investment.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Weavile, Tornadus-T, Mega Lopunny, Mega Manectric, Raikou, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Diancie, Excadrill, Keldeo, Manaphy, and Mega Metagross are all capable of outspeeding Nidoking and dealing massive damage to it, if not outright OHKOing it.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers</strong>: Priority moves from the likes of Azumarill, Scizor, Weavile, Bisharp, and Talonflame are all capable of dealing massive to Nidoking, which can make it even easier to revenge kill.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Mega Latias are capable of easily walling Nidoking because of their high Special Defense and access to recovery.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Alakazam, Mega Metagross, Mega Medicham, Latios, Latias, and Mega Gallade are all capable of outspeeding and OHKOing Nidoking, but Alakazam is OHKOed by Sucker Punch. Even though the aforementioned Pokemon are all capable of OHKOing Nidoking, they all have difficulty switching in outside of Latias.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Keldeo, Manaphy, and Starmie are all capable of outspeeding and OHKOing Nidoking, while Choice Band Azumarill can OHKO it with Aqua Jet. Politoed and Slowking can also take a few hits from Nidoking and proceed to OHKO it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earth Power is Nidoking's most spammable STAB move and hits Pokemon like Heatran, Magnezone, Bisharp, and Metagross before it Mega Evolves. Sludge Wave is slightly more powerful and hits Fairy-types such as Clefable, Mega Altaria, Gardevoir before it Mega Evolves, and Sylveon. It also hits Grass-types such as Breloom and has great coverage alongside Earth Power. Ice Beam allows Nidoking to OHKO Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus-T and 2HKO Hippowdon. Flamethrower hits Steel-types such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. Flamethrower is powerful enough that Fire Blast isn't recommended. Sucker Punch can be used to OHKO Mega Alakazam after prior damage and Gengar with no prior damage and helps pick off weakened Pokemon like Latios and Latias. Sucker Punch should be run over Flamethrower, as Earth Power already deals huge damage to Flamethrower's targets outside of Skarmory.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment maximizes Nidoking's damage output, while maximum Speed investment allows Nidoking to Speed tie with Heracross and outspeed the likes of bulky Garchomp, Heatran, Mega Altaria, Gardevoir before it Mega Evolves, and Adamant Excadrill. Life Orb along with Sheer Force boosts Nidoking's power to incredible levels. Sheer Force also negates Life Orb recoil on attacks with secondary effects, giving Nidoking more longevity than other wallbreakers. If running Sucker Punch, a Naive nature with 16 Attack EVs should be run to guarantee the OHKO on Mega Alakazam with Stealth Rock on the field.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because Nidoking lacks bulk, it struggles to switch into a lot of Pokemon easily and appreciates free switches provided by Volt Switch or U-turn support and double switches. However, Nidoking can easily switch into Clefable and pressure its team immensely, which is Nidoking's main advantage over other wallbreakers. When Nidoking is on the field against slower teams, just use the appropriate coverage move, and against faster teams, use the appropriate coverage move to hit faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Mega Metagross, Latios, and Gengar that can switch into at least one of Nidoking's STAB moves when they switch in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Nidoking struggles to switch into a lot of threats, it appreciates having Volt Switch or U-turn support. Defensive Landorus-T is immune to the Ground-type moves that threaten Nidoking and helps with Nidoking's bad matchup against sand teams, while Nidoking is capable of breaking a lot of Pokemon that check it such as Ferrothorn, Garchomp, and bulky Water-types in general. Tornadus-T is capable of checking fast Water- and Grass-types such as Keldeo and Serperior. Raikou can help check faster Electric-types such as Mega Manectric, Thundurus, and opposing Raikou, as they all deal heavy damage to Nidoking with Hidden Power Ice. Raikou also helps check the likes of Gengar if Nidoking lacks Sucker Punch, as well as checking Keldeo and Talonflame. Klefki and Ferrothorn are capable of using Spikes to capitalize on Nidoking's wallbreaking ability and Thunder Wave to provide speed control and slow down faster Pokemon, allowing Nidoking to pick them off more easily. Klefki is notable for its ability to switch into Weavile and force it out. Though it lacks Spikes, Clefable can spread paralysis too, and it can pressure teams with the threat of a Calm Mind sweep thanks to Nidoking's ability to remove Steel-types for it. Tank Garchomp punishes powerful priority moves and helps weaken Pokemon by phazing them with Dragon Tail. Latias can switch into Electric-types and Keldeo and can provide Healing Wish support, which helps Nidoking if it gets worn down too quickly.</p> <p>Mega Lopunny, Mega Alakazam, Mega Manectric, Bisharp, and Weavile are all capable of pressuring offensive teams, which Nidoking doesn't have a decent matchup against, while Nidoking helps break bulkier Pokemon for said sweepers. Mega Manectric forces a lot of switches and provides Volt Switch support for Nidoking, while Nidoking can weaken Hippowdon, a notable counter to Mega Manectric. Mega Alakazam is also notable for its ability to handle weather teams with Trace. Pokemon weak to Clefable such as Latios appreciate having Clefable weakened so that it can be picked off easily. Substitute + Swords Dance Garchomp appreciates having Unaware Clefable weakened and Togekiss removed because they are both capable of walling it. Mega Scizor and Talonflame appreciate bulky Ground-types being weakened, while Nidoking appreciates their good matchups against offensive teams. Pokemon like Azumarill and Breloom are also good teammates for their ability to OHKO Excadrill and beat Hippowdon. Pokemon like Talonflame, Azumarill, Klefki, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp have great matchups against rain teams, which trouble Nidoking heavily. Fighting-types such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and Breloom are all capable of breaking Chansey, which walls Nidoking completely. Fairy- and Dark-types such as Mega Gardevoir, Mega Altaria, Clefable, Bisharp, and Weavile are capable of handling bulky Dragon-types that can wall Nidoking such as Mega Latias.</p>"

  "Clefable": {
    "overview": "<p>Clefable was a top-tier Pokemon when Generation 6 was coming to a close, and it seems hard to believe that it has only gotten better since then. With a Fairy typing leaving it weak to only Steel- and Poison-types, a wide movepool, good defenses, and Magic Guard, Clefable became a staple on almost every ORAS OU team. By virtue of its bulk, Clefable can take on many threats to the metagame such as Weavile, Gliscor, Slowbro, Mega Lopunny, and more. When using Calm Mind, Clefable becomes the most threatening Pokemon in this tier, able to sweep any team late-game with minimal support. However, Clefable does not just function as a standalone late-game cleaner; it is also a top-tier support Pokemon, being able to spread status with Thunder Wave, set Stealth Rock, and even remove items with Knock Off. However, due to Clefable’s top usage, there has been a surge in Mega Metagross, Leftovers Excadrill, specially defensive Gliscor, and more Pokemon to check it. Clefable is also rather susceptible to Thunder Wave and Knock Off from Pokemon it usually checks such as Rotom-W, Slowbro, Ferrothorn, and Tornadus-T. Despite teams always running countermeasures for Clefable, it continues to adapt and remain at the very top of the ORAS OU metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Healing Wish can be used with Calm Mind or Stealth Rock, bringing back a teammate at low health after Clefable has done its job. Trick with a Choice Scarf can be used to cripple opposing setup sweepers such as Gliscor, Suicune, and Clefable, but bear in mind that Clefable fails to outspeed many Pokemon without heavy investment in Speed. Toxic can cripple Slowbro but is generally less useful than Thunder Wave. Stored Power alongside Calm Mind can be used to blow through Pokemon such as Quagsire and Chansey.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Metagross is the best offensive counter to Clefable, being able to OHKO it with Meteor Mash while not minding any of its moves barring a Life Orb-boosted Flamethrower or Thunder Wave. Excadrill with Leftovers walls most Clefable sets and can continuously switch in and force it out. Magnezone is able to check Clefable with Flash Cannon and fish for critical hits or Special Defense drops. Heatran can shut down Clefable with Taunt, preventing it from using Soft-Boiled, Thunder Wave, and Calm Mind. Mega Scizor comes in on any set that lacks Flamethrower and uses Clefable as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Mega Charizard Y can force Clefable out with Flamethrower and isn’t threatened by anything barring Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave. Choice Specs Keldeo heavily damages Clefable and even 2HKOes non-specially defensive Clefable after a Calm Mind with Hydro Pump. Choice Specs Latios’s Psychic can 2HKO Clefable and cripple it with Trick.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Pokemon</strong>: Calm Mind Mega Slowbro can set up alongside Clefable and OHKO it with a boosted Psyshock. Swords Dance Gliscor beats any Clefable set without Ice Beam. Suicune with Substitute can PP stall Clefable or phaze it with Roar.</p> <p><strong>Fire- and Poison-types</strong>: Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y can switch into Clefable with relative ease, only being threatened by Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt. Amoonguss can put Clefable to sleep and remove its boosts with Clear Smog. Venusaur can use Knock Off to remove Clefable’s Leftovers or Life Orb and proceed to heavily damage it with Sludge Bomb. Heatran takes little from Clefable’s attacks and can cripple it with Taunt to force it to attack and waste its PP. Volcarona can set up alongside Clefable lacking Thunder Wave and out damage it with Fire Blast.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Clefable’s Special Attack and Special Defense, making it both immensely threatening to bulkier teams and incredibly hard to revenge kill. Moonblast is Clefable’s strongest STAB move and boasts a 30% chance to drop the opponent’s Special Attack, aiding in Calm Mind wars against opposing Clefable. Flamethrower is typically chosen as the coverage move of choice, preventing Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Excadrill, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Bisharp from switching in freely or setting up. Ice Beam is your next best alternative coverage option so Clefable is not walled by specially defensive Gliscor, and it provides additional support when facing off against opposing Clefable thanks to its 10% chance to freeze. Thunder Wave is useful for crippling opposing Clefable, Mega Metagross, and Tornadus-T, to name a few; however, it is very undesirable to be hard walled by Gliscor and Excadrill. Soft-Boiled is used to keep Clefable healthy throughout the match and allow it to continuously check opposing Pokemon.</p> <p>There are a great number of acceptable options for Clefable’s last move. Bear in mind that if you are using a mono-attacking set, Moonblast is the most ideal attack of choice. Stealth Rock can be used with Calm Mind for role compression. Encore is an option to lock opposing Clefable, Gliscor, and Mega Slowbro into a boosting move. Knock Off removes Leftovers from Excadrill, Heatran, and other Clefable, aiding its late-game sweep. Thunderbolt in combination with Ice Beam allows Clefable to break through traditional counters such as specially defensive Talonflame, Heatran, and Gliscor. Psyshock is a niche option that allows you to beat other Clefable much more easily and helps with Pokemon such as Suicune and Roost Volcarona.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Defense in tandem with Leftovers allows Clefable to survive a myriad of threats to common OU teams. Attacks such as Choice Band Weavile’s Icicle Crash, boosted Gliscor’s Earthquake, Mega Lopunny’s Return, Choice Scarf Tyranitar’s Stone Edge, and Jolly Mega Medicham’s High Jump Kick into Zen Headbutt are not able to 2HKO Clefable. Magic Guard gives Clefable an immunity to status and entry hazards damage, making it incredibly hard to wear down. A more mixed defensive spread with a Calm nature is perfectly viable, providing a more reliable check to Tornadus-T, Choice Specs Keldeo, and Mega Alakazam. Keep in mind that Ice Beam should only be used on physically defensive EV spreads, as Gliscor’s boosted Earthquakes will 2HKO Clefable otherwise.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Clefable is an amazing early-game pivot, able to switch into relatively weak Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Tornadus-T with ease. By virtue of its Fairy typing, Clefable is able to stomach many strong attacks from common Pokémon such as Latios, Weavile, Medicham, and Lopunny. Clefable can even serve as a scout to Pokemon such as Crawdaunt and Keldeo; however, keep in mind that their attacks will deal a large chunk of damage; meaning that Clefable can only switch in once before having to use Soft-Boiled. Magic Guard also allows Clefable to function as a status absorber, taking Scald burns and Toxic that may annoy the team. Flamethrower should be used early-game to chip down the Steel-type that your opponent chooses to send out, while Thunder Wave should be used to inflict status on would-be checks such as Metagross and Heatran. When Clefable’s checks are either significantly weakened or removed, Calm Mind may be used to clean up the remainder of the opponent’s team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone, particularly with a Choice Scarf, is a great partner, as Magnet Pull allows it to trap Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, and Excadrill, the latter two only if weakened. Gliscor is also a fantastic partner, able to beat almost all of Clefable’s checks and appreciates Clefable being able to switch into Water- and Ice-type attacks. Fire types such as Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, Talonflame, and Volcarona are among the best switch-ins to Clefable. Pokemon such as Garchomp, Tyranitar, and Heatran can check these Pokemon thanks to their resistances and bulk while supporting Clefable by setting Stealth Rock. Latios can function as a temporary check to the threatening Fire-types, but without recovery it will be able to switch in a limited number of times, and it will need a Choice Scarf to outspeed a boosted Volcarona. Rotom-W acts as a pivot on more offensive teams, as it is able to spread status and can safely get Clefable onto the field. Spikes support from Ferrothorn and Skarmory helps wear down the opposing team. Bulky Water-types such as Mega Slowbro and Gastrodon can pivot into Steel- and Fire-types that threaten Clefable and can set up with Calm Mind and Curse, respectively, becoming additional wincons. Mega Scizor; forms a bulky setup core with Clefable it’s able to switch into Steel-types such as Metagross and Excadrill, and it appreciates Clefable being able to switch into Rotom-W. Scizor is also able to remove Heatran's Leftovers for Clefable or outright KO it with Superpower.</p>"
      },
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is mandatory on every team, and Clefable is an excellent user, being able to set them up with ease. Flamethrower is typically used as the attacking move of choice to punish Steel- types like Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Bisharp, Magnezone, and Mega Metagross. Moonblast can be used instead, but keep in mind that you can no longer punish Excadrill attempting to use Rapid Spin, so you will need to have teammates that can punish it. Thunder Wave spreads paralysis, and provides good support for Clefable’s teammates crippling Pokemon such as opposing Clefable and Tornadus-T. Knock Off is a great utility option used to remove Leftovers from common defensive Pokemon, making them easier to wear down. Soft-Boiled allows Clefable to switch into Pokemon it checks and continuously set Stealth Rock. Toxic is an alternative status option that can be used to wear down Pokémon that Stealth Rock Clefable doesn't threaten, such as Mega Slowbro and Zapdos.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>24 Special Defense EVs allow Clefable to always live Mega Charizard Y’s Fire Blast, letting Clefable potentially cripple it with paralysis. The remaining EVs let Clefable check opposing physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny and Choice Band Weavile along with avoiding the 2HKO from Ferrothorn’s Gyro Ball.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Stealth Rock should be used early-game, as Clefable has relative ease in setting them up versus many teams. As the game progresses, Clefable should be used to switch into Pokemon such as Weavile, Rotom-W, and Tornadus-T. Spreading paralysis and wearing down Steel-types with Flamethrower is how Clefable earns you progress once Stealth Rock has been set.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rocky Helmet users such as Tangrowth, Skarmory, and Garchomp are great partners to punish Excadrill and Mega Metagross. Jellicent is a shakier check to the previous Pokemon, but it has the added niche of preventing Starmie from using Rapid Spin and reliably switching into Keldeo and Slowbro. Latios makes a good pairing with Clefable on more offensive teams and appreciates Clefable’s ability to check Dragon-, Dark-, and Ice-types along with slowing down Tornadus and wearing down Steel-types with Flamethrower. On bulkier teams, Mega Latias can provide support through Thunder Wave and Calm Mind.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast is Clefable’s strongest STAB move and is very difficult to switch into when boosted by a Life Orb. Ice Beam has useful coverage, being able to OHKO Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. Soft-Boiled allows Clefable to remain healthy to be able to continuously break through the opponent’s team. Calm Mind in combination with Life Orb makes Clefable an efficient stallbreaker and allows it to win Calm Mind wars. Flamethrower heavily damages Mega Metagross, Ferrothorn, Bisharp, and other Steel-types that would switch into Clefable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>72 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature allow Clefable to OHKO specially defensive Gliscor. 12 Speed EVs allow Clefable to outspeed Tyranitar with no Speed investment, but more importantly to Speed creep other Clefable. Maximum HP investment alongside 172 Def EVs allows Clefable to better check Pokemon such as Garchomp and Gliscor.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The lack of Leftovers and Defense investment on this set means that you won’t get as much use out of using Clefable as a counter to many of the Pokemon it normally beats; Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Weavile are able to 2HKO Clefable with their STAB moves. Instead, this set should be used as a mid-game wallbreaker and late-game cleaner. Throwing out Moonblast once Stealth Rock has been set is your best option at breaking, as few Pokemon can continuously switch in. When facing a boosted Gliscor, use Ice Beam to OHKO it and fire off Flamethrower on predicted Steel-type switch-ins. Calm Mind can be used late-game or if your opponent has a Calm Mind Clefable. With Life Orb, Clefable will almost always beat opposing Clefable in a Calm Mind war.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pivots such as Tornadus-T and Rotom-W can bring Clefable in safely. Gastrodon, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn can all help check Mega Metagross with the added bonus of checking Weavile, which this set cannot do. Thunder Wave users such as Ferrothorn, Mega Latias, and Rotom-W aid Clefable in Calm Mind wars versus opposing Clefable. Psychic-types like Latios and Mega Alakazam appreciate Clefable weakening Steel-types with Flamethrower. Steel-types like Bisharp and Excadrill benefit from Gliscor being knocked out by Ice Beam.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast threatens Fighting-types like Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, and Keldeo, Soft-Boiled is important to keep Clefable healthy and let it be a reliable switch-in against special attackers like Mega Diancie, Thundurus, and Mega Alakazam. Thunder Wave cripples faster targets and helps to defeat opposing Clefable. However, Flamethrower is useful against Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Skarmory, and it can catch Excadrill and Scizor on the switch in. Knock Off allows Clefable to support its team by removing items such as Leftovers, Assault Vest, and Rocky Helmet from foes. Calm Mind lets Clefable set up to become a late-game sweeper itself and handle strong special attackers like Mega Diancie, Mega Alakazam, and Keldeo. Lastly, if the team is in need of a Stealth Rock setter, Clefable is able to fit that role as well.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment with 96 Special Defense EVs allows Clefable to tank special attacks from Mega Alakazam and Mega Diancie, while the Defense EVs help against Diamond Storm and physical attackers like Weavile and Mega Lopunny. Furthermore, after a Calm Mind, Clefable is able to sustain itself against Choice Specs Keldeo, Calm Mind Mega Alakazam, and Choice Scarf Magnezone. With the remaining Defense investment, Clefable is still able to deal with some physical attackers like Dragonite and Mega Lopunny as long as it is kept at full health. Magic Guard lets Clefable absorb status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, as well as protecting it from entry hazards and weather damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Clefable has good bulk, an ability that protects it from entry hazards and weather damage, and healing from Soft-Boiled; thanks to this, Clefable is a suitable switch-in against many special attackers like Mega Diancie and Mega Alakazam as well as pivots like Tornadus-T and Rotom-W and Dragon-types like Garchomp and Latios. Clefable can be a good lead thanks to having a variety of utility moves, setting up Stealth Rock, using Knock Off to remove items, and forcing out Weavile, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Charizard-Y with Thunder Wave. If Clefable runs Flamethrower, it should aim to catch strong Steel-types Scizor, Bisharp, and Excadrill on the switch. When running Calm Mind, Clefable can function as a setup sweeper as soon as its checks, like Excadrill, Mega Scizor, and Serperior, are weakened or defeated. When facing Mega Alakazam or Mega Diancie, Clefable should stay healthy and avoid Knock Off to keep its Leftovers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clefable does best on balance and bulky teams, since it can function as a specially defensive check, provide utility such as Stealth Rock and Knock Off, and wall many special attackers. Good teammates for Clefable are Pokemon that handle strong physical attackers, like Slowbro and Cresselia, which aid in checking Meta Metagross, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Medicham. Zapdos has the ability to deal with Steel-types like Excadrill and Bisharp. Especially when using Calm Mind, Clefable appreciates teammates that can support its team against an overload of physical attackers like Weavile, Dragonite, and Mega Gallade. Therefore, Mega Scizor, a sand core of Tyranitar and Excadrill, and Rotom-W synergize well with specially defensive Clefable. Lastly, on more offensive teams that struggle with Mega Diancie, specially defensive Clefable can be a good choice because it does not restrict momentum to the same extent that other options would.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish provides Clefable with reliable recovery and the ability to heal teammates, making it an essential component of many balance and stall builds. Protect pairs with Wish to guarantee Clefable's healing, provides it with extra Leftovers recovery, and lets it scout for Choice-locked moves or status attempts. Calm Mind makes it increasingly difficult for special attackers to break past Clefable. Moonblast offers a reliable Fairy-type STAB move with good neutral coverage to hit important targets such as Manaphy, Serperior, and Thundurus. Heal Bell can also be used over Calm Mind to provide cleric support for Clefable's teammates. Finally, Moonlight can be used over Protect, but it is much less reliable due to low PP and being affected by weather.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP maximizes Clefable's Wish for its teammates. A Bold nature is ideal with Calm Mind, as it allows Clefable to deal with physically offensive threats such as Garchomp, Dragonite, and Mega Heracross. 200 Defense EVs minimize the chances of Clefable getting 2HKOed by Mega Heracross and Mega Medicham. 56 Special Defense EVs allow it to survive two rain-boosted Scalds from Modest Manaphy after burn and Stealth Rock damage; this investment also gives Clefable a better time versus other specially offensive threats such as Serperior and Volcarona. Alternatively, a Calm nature can be used over Bold to better handle Rain Dance Manaphy and Serperior immediately and without the use of Calm Mind; this is especially important if Heal Bell is used instead. 56 EVs in Special Defense with a Calm nature minimize the chances of Manaphy's rain-boosted Surf 2HKOing Clefable. Leftovers allows Clefable to stay healthy throughout the match, especially when Wish isn’t enough between turns.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Clefable should be played patiently, capitalizing on its ability to shut down setup sweepers and wear down passive teams. Use Wish + Protect to keep Clefable healthy and sustain teammates over long games. Do not attempt to use this set to force holes in the enemy team, as Clefable is often crucial in not letting setup sweepers take over the game. Avoid Toxic and status moves early unless Clefable has cleric support, as poison and burn drastically reduce its longevity. Try to avoid Knock Off users like Bisharp and Weavile, as losing Leftovers greatly hinders Clefable’s ability to outlast threats in the long term. Be aware of Mold Breaker Pokemon that can bypass Clefable's Unaware ability such as Swords Dance Excadrill and Dragon Dance Mega Gyarados.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clefable fits well on balance and stall teams that can support its defensive role. Physical walls like Skarmory, Slowbro, and Zapdos are excellent partners, handling powerful physical attackers that threaten Clefable such as Mega Metagross, Excadrill, and Mega Scizor. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey complement Clefable well by taking on special threats such as Mega Alakazam and Mega Charizard Y while also offering cleric or entry hazard support. Hazard control is critical to prevent Clefable from being worn down, making Defog or Rapid Spin users like Zapdos, Skarmory, or Excadrill highly valuable. Lastly, slow paced teammates such as Slowbro and Skarmory that struggle against special setup sweepers benefit greatly from Unaware Clefable.</p>"

  "Alakazam": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Alakazam possesses the highest Special Attack in the tier and incredible Speed, allowing it to function as a revenge killer and wallbreaker. Before Mega Evolving, Alakazam has the ability Magic Guard, allowing it to bypass entry hazards like Spikes and Stealth Rock while also avoiding damage from certain status moves like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp. After Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam gains the ability Trace, allowing it to copy abilities like Flash Fire from Heatran, Sand Rush from Excadrill, Regenerator from Tornadus-T, and Levitate from Latios. However, Mega Alakazam is very reliant on its Speed, making it scared of being hit by Thunder Wave from Pokemon like Rotom-W, Latias, Slowbro, and Clefable or Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T, which can outspeed and threaten it. Mega Alakazam's poor defensive stats also make it unable to reliably switch into attacks, and priority moves like Sucker Punch from Bisharp and Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor and Mega Metagross can also prove to be problematic, as they can OHKO it or do a significant amount of damage to it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire can be used to lure in and remove Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Taunt can also be used to stop status moves, entry hazards, and, most importantly, recovery. Recover is an option to give Mega Alakazam a form of recovery. Knock Off can be considered, as it helps with removing important items like Eviolite from Chansey and Assault Vest from Tornadus-T.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Because of Mega Alakazam's poor bulk, attacks like Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor and Mega Metagross, Fake Out from Mega Medicham, Aqua Jet from Crawdaunt, and Sucker Punch from Bisharp can do a lot of damage to or OHKO Mega Alakazam.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types like Weavile, Bisharp, Crawdaunt, and Tyranitar can all threaten to OHKO Mega Alakazam. It does have Focus Blast to OHKO all these threats, but be wary of its accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Scizor is the best counter to Mega Alakazam, as it can always survive two hits from Mega Alakazam barring Hidden Power Fire. Mega Scizor is also hard to chip down thanks to Roost and can revenge kill Mega Alakazam with Bullet Punch or OHKO it with a Bug-type move like U-turn. Ferrothorn can take a Focus Blast and retaliate with Power Whip, but you can easily weaken it to where its in range of Focus Blast. Mega Metagross is able to take one Shadow Ball and revenge kill back, but it is easy to put in KO range.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey's special bulk makes it near impossible for Mega Alakazam to break through it. Chansey is also able to slowly wear down Mega Alakazam with Seismic Toss or cripple it with a status move like Thunder Wave or Toxic. However, Chansey can be defeated with the combination of Calm Mind and Recover to boost your Special Attack enough while also recovering off damage from Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Thunder Wave</strong>: Faster Pokemon, like Choice Scarf users and Sand Rush Excadrill can all outspeed and threaten Mega Alakazam due to how frail it is. There are ways to get around these fast threats, like removing their Choice Scarf with other teammates or copying Sand Rush from Excadrill. Thunder Wave cripples Mega Alakazam's Speed, making it less threatening and easy to KO.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>STAB Psychic is used to hit physically defensive threats like Landorus-T and Fighting-types like Mega Lopunny. Shadow Ball targets other Psychic-types that would otherwise resist its attacks, such as Latios, Slowbro, and Mega Metagross. Focus Blast hits Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn while also hitting Dark-types like Weavile and Tyranitar. Hidden Power Ice can be used in the last slot to hit Ground-types like Gliscor for more damage. Alternatively, Calm Mind can be used to boost Mega Alakazam's Special Attack and Special Defense, allowing it to break through defensive cores and sweep through teams. If Calm Mind is paired with Recover instead of Shadow Ball, Mega Alakazam is able to stallbreak. Mega Alakazam can also stallbreak more easily if running Psyshock over Psychic, allowing you to beat other Calm Mind users and break through special walls like Chansey. Encore and Substitute are also options, with the former locking foes into moves and the latter helping Mega Alakazam avoid status while also circumventing priority moves like Bisharp's Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs allow Mega Alakazam to be as strong and fast as possible. A Timid nature is necessary to outspeed Pokemon like Mega Lopunny. Magic Guard is the chosen ability before Mega Evolution to help Alakazam avoid damage from entry hazards. After Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's ability turns into Trace, allowing it to copy abilities like Sand Rush from Excadrill, Regenerator from Tangrowth and Tornadus-T, and Flash Fire from Heatran.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Alakazam cannot consistently switch into attacks due to how frail it is. It likes coming in freely after a teammate has fainted, via a pivot move like Volt Switch or U-turn, or a double switch. Take advantage of Mega Alakazam's great Speed and use it as a revenge killer or late-game cleaner. Use Trace to copy abilities like Flash Fire to switch into Heatran's Magma Storm and Sand Rush from Excadrill to outspeed it even under sand. Use Mega Alakazam as a late-game sweeper by putting its checks and counters in range of its attacks or eliminating them. Make sure Pokemon that are faster than Mega Alakazam have been eliminated or have their Speed crippled by getting rid of their Choice Scarf or using Thunder Wave on them. Also, be aware of priority moves, like Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor and Mega Metagross, Ice Shard from Weavile, and Fake Out from Mega Medicham. Stay out of range of priority moves or eliminate the Pokemon that have them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Alakazam appreciates Spikes, as they can wear down its checks, making Pokemon like Skarmory and Ferrothorn good teammates. Ferrothorn is exceptionally good, as it can also offer Knock Off and Thunder Wave support. Heatran provides Stealth Rock while also checking things like Mega Scizor. Mega Scizor is one of the best answers to Mega Alakazam, making Magnezone a good partner to trap and eliminate it. Flying-types like Mega Pinsir and Talonflame have priority moves that can threaten Mega Alakazam, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T makes Mega Alakazam lose momentum. Pokemon like Rotom-W and Zapdos can soak up hits from the aforementioned Flying-types, while Serperior can lure them in and paralyze them with Glare. Gliscor and Clefable are also good partners, as they are good status absorbers. Clefable also has access to Knock Off, which can remove important items like Chansey's Eviolite. Serperior's access to Knock Off allows it to remove Tornadus-T's Assault Vest as well as Chansey's Eviolite. Choice Scarf Landorus-T not only is immune to Ground-type moves from faster Pokemon, like Sand Rush Excadrill and opposing Choice Scarf Landorus-T, but can also provide momentum through U-turn, giving Mega Alakazam a free switch-in. Garchomp can deal with physical attackers like Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Mega Scizor, which all threaten Mega Alakazam, while also providing Stealth Rock support.</p>"

  "Tentacruel": {
    "overview": "<p>Tentacruel's good defensive typing and stats allow it to check some of the largest threats in the OU metagame such as Azumarill, Keldeo, and Clefable. However, its main claim to fame is being a Rapid Spin user that can beat Mega Sableye. It also absorbs Toxic Spikes, which are very common in the current metagame. On the flip side, Tentacruel has some common weaknesses to Electric-, Psychic-, and Ground-type moves, which substantially hinder its defensive capabilities. Tentacruel also lacks any form of reliable recovery, making it easy to wear down. It also faces competition as a Water-type Rapid Spin user from Starmie, which has reliable recovery, a much better Speed tier, and more coverage options. However, Tentacruel differentiates itself with its better support options, lack of Pursuit weakness, and some unique resistances.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam hits Dragon-types, Gliscor, and Landorus-T for huge damage, but it is weak otherwise. Toxic cripples the bulky Water-types that tend to switch into Tentacruel. An offensive set with Hydro Pump, Hidden Power Fire, and Ice Beam or Sludge Bomb with Black Sludge can do significant amounts of damage on Tentacruel's usual counters and make good use of Tentacruel's Speed tier. A set consisting of Mirror Coat with Assault Vest can lure Pokemon such as Thundurus and Raikou. However, it is pretty bad otherwise. Haze allows Tentacruel punish Pokemon that try to set up. Substitute can be used to keep momentum and stall out Pokemon that have been already burned or poisoned.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Thundurus, Mega Manectric, and Raikou easily force Tentacruel out with their super effective STAB moves while gaining momentum with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Latias, Latios, Slowbro, and Mega Slowbro can easily take out Tentacruel with their Psychic-type STAB moves. Slowbro and Mega Slowbro should be wary of Toxic, though.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Manaphy, Starmie, and Rotom-W fear nothing from Tentacruel aside from a Scald burn or the occasional Toxic and can either set up or threaten it with their secondary STAB attacks, respectively. And although Tentacruel takes little from Scald, it hates getting burned, as it has no reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Substitute Mega Gyarados, and SubCM Keldeo can easily set up on Tentacruel and potentially sweep its team.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon with super effective attacks, such as Excadrill and Mamoswine, can easily force out Tentacruel.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald has a high chance to burn the target, which makes physical attackers reluctant to switch into Tentacruel. Rapid Spin is Tentacruel's main perk over other bulky Water-types and provides immense support to its team. Acid Spray lowers a target's Special Defense by two stages, allowing Tentacruel to beat Mega Sableye and use Rapid Spin, while also checking Calm Mind users. Toxic Spikes cripples opposing grounded Pokemon upon switching in, pressuring them with residual damage each turn. Knock Off provides huge utility and allows Tentacruel to beat Gengar faster. Haze is also an option as it allows Tentacruel to reliably check Belly Drum Azumarill by removing Azumarill's boosts. Protect can be used for scouting Choice-locked moves and gaining an extra turn of Black Sludge recovery, as well as getting an extra turn of Toxic damage on the opponent. Sludge Wave hits Fairy-types for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Both of Tentacruel's abilities are situational. Liquid Ooze is preferred, as it punishes the use of HP draining moves such as Leech Seed and Giga Drain. However, Rain Dish can be used on rain teams for semi-reliable recovery. Black Sludge provides passive recovery. The EV spread makes sure that Tentacruel avoids the 2HKO from Life Orb Gengar's Shadow Ball and Modest Mega Charizard Y's Fire Blast or Solar Beam after Stealth Rock 100% of the time, while still retaining a respectable physical bulk that allows it to check physical attackers such as Azumarill. 16 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Tentacruel to outspeed neutral-natured Mega Altaria and max Speed base 70s such as Breloom, Adamant Diggersby, and almost all versions of defensive Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tentacruel should be switched in on resisted attacks or on Pokemon that are checked by it such as Azumarill and Mega Altaria. Even though Tentacruel has respectable bulk, do not try to switch it into unresisted attacks, especially if you absolutely need entry hazards gone, as it is prone to getting worn down easily due to lack of recovery and constant switching into entry hazards. If an opponent has a Ghost-type, then it is preferable to not use Rapid Spin immediately. Before using Toxic Spikes, assess the opposing team. If it has too many Pokemon immune to them or a grounded Poison-type, it is preferable to not use Toxic Spikes at all. Also, use only one layer if your opponent is using an offensive team, as regular poison will result in more damage short-term.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tentacruel fits well on balance and stall teams. Mega Sableye has great synergy with Tentacruel, as it is immune to Psychic-type attacks and Tentacruel in return resists Fairy. Mega Sableye can also block Rapid Spin for Toxic Spikes set up by Tentacruel and also benefits from Toxic Spikes support when sweeping with its Calm Mind set. Grass-types such as Celebi and Ferrothorn have very good synergy with Tentacruel. Celebi also provides cleric support with Heal Bell. Wish users such as Chansey and Clefable are great teammates, as Tentacruel has no reliable recovery of its own. Gliscor has very good synergy with Tentacruel, as it can switch into Electric- and Ground-type attacks and Tentacruel can easily take Ice- and Water-type attacks aimed at Gliscor.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With excellent defensive stats alongside a solid Water and Psychic typing, Slowbro is a great choice for taking on threats such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Metagross, and Mega Medicham. With recovery from Slack Off and Regenerator, Slowbro can absorb a lot of damage and still sustain itself for a long time, allowing it to function as an all-around defensive pivot. Its very wide supportive movepool lets it take on various foes comfortably. The defensive boost Slowbro gets after Mega Evolving, combined with the ability Shell Armor and its access to boosting moves like Calm Mind, makes it a very viable bulky sweeper. Despite all this, Slowbro's typing renders it weak to common Knock Off and Pursuit users like Weavile, Bisharp, and Tyranitar. Slowbro's typing also makes it vulnerable to both U-turn and Volt Switch, making it very easy to gain momentum on. Its mediocre Special Defense also makes it vulnerable to special attackers such as Mega Manectric, Serperior, and Thundurus. Lastly, Slowbro fears status such as poison and burn, moves that can put it on a timer, like Toxic, and moves like Taunt that can stop it from recovering health or inflicting its own status.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Eject Button can be used on Slowbro for a one-use momentum grabbing tool. Protect can be used on sets with Toxic and Leftovers, helping Slowbro scout for Pursuit, stall a turn of Toxic, and get an extra turn of recovery. A Double Dance set on Mega Slowbro with Iron Defense and Calm Mind is viable, especially with a cleric teammate or Rest instead of Slack Off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Thundurus, Rotom-W, and Zapdos can deal a large amount of damage to Slowbro and, when using Volt Switch, can pivot into other threats. However, in the right situation, Calm Mind Slowbro variants can increase their Special Defense to a point where they are not threatened anymore.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Tyranitar, Weavile, Bisharp, Crawdaunt, Mega Gyarados, and Hydreigon pose a threat to Slowbro due to their Dark-type STAB moves OHKOing it. The ones running Pursuit can also Pursuit trap it, potentially removing it from the game or dealing a huge amount of damage.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Pokemon like Serperior, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss are able to switch into most of Slowbro's moves while dealing a lot of damage back. The majority of them, however, do not appreciate being hit by Ice Beam or Flamethrower, burned by Scald, or paralyzed by Thunder Wave. Poison-types like Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss are also threatened by Psychic and Future Sight.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: If Slowbro lacks Ice Beam, Dragon-types like Latios, Latias, and Hydreigon can easily switch in and shrug off any damage, especially if they carry Roost. They can also proceed to threaten Slowbro with an OHKO or 2HKO. Kyurem and Kyurem-B deserve a special mention, since they take neutral from Ice Beam and can be unbothered by burn with special sets.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Bug-types such as Mega Heracross, Volcarona, and Mega Scizor can deal a lot of damage to or outright OHKO Slowbro. Mega Scizor in particular can deal great damage with U-turn while providing momentum and avoiding status from Scald or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Poison or burns can limit Slowbro's potential to recover significantly and therefore put it on a timer.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald has a chance to cripple a large range of Pokemon such as Mega Metagross, Excadrill, Bisharp, and Tyranitar. Slack Off allows Slowbro to stay healthy and, when combined with Regenerator, makes it increasingly hard to wear down. Ice Beam reliably hits Gliscor as well as Dragon- and Grass-types such as Dragonite, Garchomp, and Serperior. On the other hand, Psychic enables Slowbro to deal with Volcanion and Keldeo better, especially the Substitute variants. Thunder Wave allows Slowbro to cripple Pokemon that can otherwise switch comfortably in on it such as Mega Charizard Y, Clefable, and Serperior. Toxic instead of Thunder Wave helps with Thunder Wave-immune foes that switch into Slowbro, such as Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Zapdos, while also inflicting status on Ground-types like Gastrodon and Seismitoad. Finally, Future Sight and Flamethrower give Slowbro more versatility, such as providing wallbreaking support and hitting Ferrothorn, respectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread allows Slowbro to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Keldeo's Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock and Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam from full health. The rest of the EVs are thrown into physical bulk to deal with Pokemon like Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Metagross. Leftovers and Regenerator enhance Slowbro's longevity. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet is a solid option to chip down foes like Excadrill, Mega Metagross, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Medicham.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use this set as a defensive pivot. Slowbro checks setup Pokemon like Dragonite, Mega Charizard X, and Gliscor. It supports its teammates with status moves such as Scald, Toxic, and Thunder Wave. Rocky Helmet can be used to wear down physical attackers and put them in the range of Slowbro's teammates. Make sure to scout for status moves from common status users like Clefable, Heatran, and Amoonguss to ensure Slowbro's survivability. Be mindful of Pursuit trappers, especially Choice Band Tyranitar and Weavile, as they threaten to beat Slowbro quickly and leave your team vulnerable to physical attackers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slowbro fits well on bulkier teams like balance, bulky offense, and stall. It is able to act as the team's physical wall and is a countermeasure to strong Fighting-types, such as Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Keldeo. Pokemon that can assist Slowbro in dealing with Electric-types like Rotom-W, Grass-types like Serperior, and Dark-types like Tyranitar are appreciated. Magic Guard Clefable is a great partner because its mixed bulk and Fairy typing allow it to handle threats like Mega Gyarados, Latios, and Rotom-W. It also can absorb the status moves that Slowbro does not want to take. Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss can face off against Grass- and Electric-types Slowbro tends to struggle with, like Serperior and Rotom-W. Other partners include special sponges like Tornadus-T and Gliscor. Tornadus-T forms a nice Regenerator core with Slowbro, while Gliscor is able to absorb Electric-type and status moves once Toxic Orb is activated. Excadrill can check certain Electric-types like Rotom-W as well as Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Altaria. It also can remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin, which Slowbro appreciates.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald can spread burns, crippling physical attackers like Garchomp, Kyurem-B, and Bisharp. Psyshock hits Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Volcanion. It is especially useful when facing other Calm Mind users such as Clefable, as it allows Slowbro to win Calm Mind wars. Calm Mind helps further to let Slowbro set up and deal with special attackers like Mega Diancie, Zapdos, and Keldeo. Slack Off allows Slowbro to sustain itself, allowing it to absorb attacks and wall a variety of Pokemon including Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set allows Slowbro to be as bulky as possible. 44 Special Defense EVs allow Slowbro to avoid a 2HKO from Thundurus's Thunderbolt after two Calm Minds and without Leftovers. It also avoids a 2HKO from Mega Alakazam's Shadow Ball after one Calm Mind and minimizes Volt Switch damage from Thundurus, Zapdos, and Rotom-W. The remaining physical bulk is enough to deal with Pokemon like Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Metagross. Leftovers allows Slowbro to set up more comfortably. However, Slowbronite can be used instead to overpower Dark-type Pokemon that rely on Knock Off for damage, such as Weavile, Crawdaunt, and Bisharp, especially after Mega Evolving. Regenerator helps to increase the longevity even further.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While still being able to function as a pivot and a wall, this Slowbro set can check Clefable as well through utilizing the combination of Calm Mind and Psyshock. Given the opportunity, Slowbro can set up with Calm Mind and become a sweeper. Calm Mind can also be used to better match up versus Pokemon like Volcanion and Tornadus-T better while allowing Slowbro to deliver stronger hits on possible switch-ins like Zapdos and Rotom-W. When used as Mega Slowbro, make sure to remove Toxic users or Pokemon whose STAB moves threaten it in a meaningful way, and it can become a defensive behemoth with the increased Defense from the Mega Evolution and the Special Defense raise from Calm Mind.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slowbro fits on every team but hyper offense. Especially when used as Mega, it can function as both a late-game sweeper and a physical wall. As a support Pokemon, it appreciates teammates that switch into Dark-types like Tyranitar, Weavile, and Bisharp. Therefore, Keldeo, Mega Scizor, and Clefable are good partners. Magic Guard Clefable is a good partner too because it can absorb status moves, threaten Mega Gyarados, and switch in against Zapdos and Rotom-W. Excadrill can remove entry hazards, which would limit Slowbro's option to pivot and heal with Regenerator, and can set up Stealth Rock itself, which chips down Pokemon like Landorus-T, Weavile, and Zapdos. Heal Bell users like Chansey and Clefable can help to get rid of unwanted status conditions and therefore are good partners for Slowbro.</p>"

      "Offensive Tank Slowbro": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is a spammable STAB move because of its chance to burn foes, whittling down and crippling switch-ins. Slack Off keeps Mega Slowbro healthy. Flamethrower hits Grass-types, such as Ferrothorn, Serperior, and Amoonguss. Future Sight allows Mega Slowbro to overload damage on a later turn and be a threatening pivot too. Psychic is the more consistent move and gives Slowbro a better matchup against Pokemon such as Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Volcanion. Ice Beam and Grass Knot are alternative options that can provide more coverage over a secondary STAB move. Ice Beam provides more immediate damage against Dragonite, while Grass Knot provides more immediate damage against Mega Gyarados, Gastrodon, and opposing Slowbro.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>136 Defense EVs with a Bold nature give Slowbro enough bulk to tank attacks from Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Bisharp, as well as Weavile after Mega Evolving. The Special Attack investment allows Slowbro to 2HKO Serperior and Assault Vest Bisharp with Flamethrower, though it needs to Mega Evolve to 2HKO the latter. It can also 2HKO Gliscor with Scald after Poison Heal recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Offensive tank Mega Slowbro can consider Mega Evolving right away to take advantage of the jump in Special Attack and, to a lesser extent, the jump in physical bulk. This depends on whether it is more advantageous to keep Regenerator and have Slowbro be able to pivot. Mega Slowbro typically should be using Scald to land chip damage and potential burns on its foes, but it is also recommended to try to predict switch-ins and hit them with the appropriate coverage moves. For example, it might be better to hit Serperior and Ferrothorn with Flamethrower or use Future Sight for a delayed impact, instead of fishing for a burn on the switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Tank Mega Slowbro fits best on balance and bulky offense builds. Pokemon that are able to deal with Electric- and Grass-types such as Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Serperior are greatly appreciated. Teammates like specially defensive Heatran and Clefable work just fine. Good checks to Dark-types like Mega Gyarados, Weavile, and Tyranitar, such as Keldeo, are very helpful as well. Pokemon that can remove entry hazards like Excadrill and Zapdos help Mega Slowbro to stay healthy. Additionally, both Zapdos and Excadrill help with the Electric-type issue, with Excadrill also being able to deal with Fairy-types like Mega Altaria and Clefable.</p>"

  "Magneton": {
    "overview": "<p>Magneton is mostly outclassed by its evolution, as Magnezone has superior offensive and defensive power, but Magneton's niche lies in its higher Speed, which allows it to outspeed Pokemon such as Weavile, Starmie, Tornadus-T, and Jolly Talonflame when equipped with a Choice Scarf. Magneton has a very good Special Attack stat that allows it to hit quite hard. It has a good ability in Magnet Pull, which allows Magneton to trap and beat Steel-types. It can use Volt Switch to help keep up momentum for teams. Magneton is immune to paralysis and poison, which allows it to absorb these sorts of status for teammates. It has a decent Electric / Steel typing, though it does have a 4x weakness to Ground-type attacks. Magneton has average defenses, but those are a bit let down by a mediocre HP stat. It has a small movepool with very limited options, which allows it to only fill out a single role effectively. Magneton is also easily beaten by specially defensive Pokemon, though it is capable of switching out against all Pokemon but Ground-types with Volt Switch. It is also rather item-reliant, as without its item, it will be too slow to outspeed several threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Analytic can be used for superior power, but that stops Magneton from being able to trap Steel-types, which means that it loses its niche. Sturdy is also a possibility to prevent Magneton from being OHKOed, but again, it cannot trap Steel-types. Eviolite is an option, but that'd waste Magneton's niche as a Choice Scarf trapper and its mediocre HP limits its effectiveness. Hidden Power Ice is another option that helps to hit Dragon-types better, but Hidden Power Fire is better in most situations because Magneton would struggle against Pokemon such as Scizor and Ferrothorn otherwise. Explosion is also an option that can bring in setup sweepers safely after use, though it lacks good power because of Magneton's poor base 60 Attack. Substitute can prevent Magneton from being revenge killed after it KOes a Steel-type, but it cannot really miss out on other attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Swampert, are immune to Volt Switch and Thunderbolt and can OHKO Magneton with one of their STAB attacks, although the former two cannot reliably switch into Flash Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Mega Manectric, Magnezone, and Thundurus-T are capable of tanking any hit, as they resist Magneton's Electric- and Steel-type STAB attacks, and can usually take a Hidden Power Fire and continue by beating Magneton or, in Thundurus-T's case, set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Specially defensive walls, such as Cresselia and Heatran, can take any of Magneton's attacks and set up on it. The latter is capable of straight KOing Magneton with a Fire-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Priority</strong>: As Magneton is a bit frail because of its low HP stat, super effective priority, such as Mach Punch from Conkeldurr and Breloom, can easily beat Magneton.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch allows Magneton to keep up momentum as well as switch out of Pokemon that threaten it, except against Ground-types. Thunderbolt has superior power to Volt Switch, which allows it to hit slightly harder. Flash Cannon is another good STAB attack that hits Ground-types which are immune to the former two attacks. Hidden Power Fire is really useful to hit Steel-types, most notably Ferrothorn and Scizor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf is the reason why to use Magneton over Magnezone, as it allows Magneton to outspeed Talonflame, Starmie, and Dragonite after a Dragon Dance as well as Speed tie Mega Gyarados after a Dragon Dance. Magnet Pull traps Steel-types, meaning Magneton can take care of them. Max Special Attack investment ensures that Magneton hits as hard as possible, and the max Speed investment along with a Timid nature help Magneton outspeed Pokemon with a base Speed of 115 or higher.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Volt Switch most of the time in order to gain momentum; however, you should play carefully with it; you cannot risk a Ground-type switching in and forcing you to switch in order to remain healthy. When a Steel-type is on the field, switch into Magneton in order to trap and eventually beat it. Don't switch in on an Excadrill or Heatran, because the former one can OHKO with Earthquake and the latter can take any hit and strike back with a Fire-type STAB attack. Magneton can also be used to clean up with Volt Switch once the foe has been brought down to low health.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Other U-turn users or Volt Switch users such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W make for good partners, as they'll be able to keep up the momentum for the team. Pokemon that beat up Ground-types, such as Azumarill and Venusaur, are really useful too, as Magneton has a hard time against Ground-types. Furthermore, Pokemon that take advantage of the fact that Magneton is capable of beating up Steel-types, such as Latios, Gyarados, Mega Altaria, and Mega Beedrill, and those that can clean up after are good partners too. And last, but not least, physical wallbreakers that get rid of special walls that hinder Magneton, such as Bisharp and Azumarill, also make for great partners.</p>"

  "Cloyster": {
    "overview": "<p>Cloyster finds itself a nice role on hyper offense teams through its ability to compress both the ability to sweep and utility in the form of entry hazard removal provided by Rapid Spin. Shell Smash boosts allow Cloyster to threaten frailer offense teams as well as balance teams without sturdy Ice-resistant Pokemon with the coverage of Icicle Spear and Rock Blast. However, Cloyster's stats aside from its whopping Defense are rather mediocre when unboosted, leaving much to be desired. Cloyster finds itself in the very populated Speed tier of base 70 with other Pokemon such as Bisharp, Volcanion, and Metagross before it Mega Evolves. These three all resist Cloyster's Icicle Spear and serve as great checks to it. Cloyster also faces tough competition from Weavile as a physical Ice-type attacker, which serves a similar role in breaking opposing teams but has both a higher Speed and Attack stat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Water-type STAB moves such as Razor Shell, Surf, and Hydro Pump can be run over Rapid Spin as a secondary STAB option that hits targets like Heatran and Mega Scizor harder than Rock Blast. However, this requires dropping Rapid Spin, which isn't worth it on most teams. Explosion is also a viable option to allow Cloyster to get off a massive neutral hit on Water-type checks such as Keldeo and Volcanion. Similarly, Hidden Power Grass can be run to hit the afformentioned Water-types super effectively. Lastly, Spikes can also be run similarly to Toxic Spikes to force chip damage onto opposing Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, which would otherwise avoid the poison from Toxic Spikes. It should be noted that when running special moves such as Hydro Pump and Hidden Power Grass, Cloyster should have a Naive or Rash nature so as to avoid the Special Attack reduction from Jolly or Adamant.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status moves that hit Cloyster on the turn it sets up, such as Thunder Wave and Glare from Clefable and Serperior, greatly hamper its sweeping potential. The same can be said for burn from the likes of Will-O-Wisp Rotom-W and Cofagrigus, which shuts down Cloyster's attempts at a sweep due to the Attack drop.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon Not Weak to Ice</strong>: Pokemon such as Clefable, Slowbro, and Rotom-W have good matchups against Cloyster by nature of not being weak to its boosted Icicle Spear. They can all paralyse it with Thunder Wave or, in the case of Slowbro and Rotom-W, threaten to burn it with Scald or Will-O-Wisp. Rotom-W and Clefable also threaten to do massive damage to Cloyster, even picking up an OHKO Volt Switch and Moonblast after the Special Defense drop from Shell Smash.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash is a non-negotiable move on Cloyster, allowing it to sweep teams late-game or break holes for its teammates early-game. Icicle Spear is another non-negotiable move, as it is far and away Cloyster's best STAB move with Skill Link, and it allows Cloyster to break through physically defensive Pokemon that are weak to Ice like Garchomp. Rock Blast prevents Cloyster from getting walled by common Water-type Pokemon like Volcanion due to the super effective hit and Rotom-W, which is 2HKOed after one round of Stealth Rock damage. Toxic Spikes is also a viable option, since it allows Cloyster to function as a suicide lead and support option, poisoning defensive Pokemon that match up well against hyper offense teams such as Hippowdon and Slowbro. Rapid Spin lets Cloyster function as an entry hazard remover for hyper offense teams, since it can freely use Rapid Spin on the Ground-types that are commonly used to set Stealth Rock due to its massive Defense stat, its Ice-type STAB move, and the threat of Shell Smash.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack and Speed EVs guarantee that Cloyster makes the most out of Shell Smash. An Adamant nature is run to maximise Cloyster's damage, since it's faster than the entire metagame after a boost from Shell Smash. However, Jolly should be run when using it on teams that need the extra Speed before Shell Smash, outspeeding and KOing defensive Zapdos and Garchomp, or when running Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spin to make Cloyster a better support Pokemon. Running Focus Sash allows Cloyster to survive powerful special attacks from full HP such as Leaf Storm from Serperior and Flamethrower from Volcanion to guarantee at least one turn to set up with Shell Smash, which is invaluable in offense versus offense matchups. Mental Herb is also a viable option, since it allows Cloyster to be a good anti-hyper offense tool when leading against common leads such as Aerodactyl, Shuckle, and Mew. Cloyster can also run King's Rock to take advantage of potential flinches from its multi-hit attacks in Icicle Spear and Rock Blast; however, this is inconsistent.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cloyster functions best as either a lead that can immediately threaten to start punching holes into the opponent's team or as a late-game cleaner. When using Cloyster, avoid switching it in often because of its low HP and Special Defense as well as its weakness to Stealth Rock. Do note, however, that Cloyster has a good matchup against the common Ground-type Stealth Rock users, so it can afford to come in on them to use Rapid Spin to support its hyper offense team partners such as Volcarona.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cloyster fits best on hyper offense teams due to the utility it brings as both a setup sweeper and entry hazard remover. Teammates such as Landorus-T and Volcarona excel as partners, since they have good synergy with each other; Landorus-T sets up the Stealth Rock that Cloyster needs to break past checks like Rotom-W, while Volcarona appreciates both Stealth Rock being cleared from the field as well as Cloyster's ability to wear down Water-types like Keldeo and Volcanion, which both check it. Other good partners include Swords Dance Bisharp and Mega Alakazam, which appreciate Cloyster's ability to break down opposing teams to put them in range of Sucker Punch and Psychic. Both of these Pokemon also appreciate Cloyster's ability to OHKO their checks like Garchomp and Hippowdon or wear them down with poison from Toxic Spikes.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Astronomical HP and Special Defense, combined with the ability to use Eviolite, makes Chansey the ultimate wall in OU. Unlike that of its sister Blissey, Chansey's augmented physical bulk with Eviolite allows it to take powerful physical hits, making it a staple on defensively oriented teams. Wish and Natural Cure allow Chansey to heal its teammates and absorb status for them, while access to Seismic Toss and Toxic helps prevent it from being setup bait. Even with two ways of dealing damage, Chansey is still very passive, and because of this it is largely shut down by Taunt. Chansey's defensive typing is also rather poor for a wall, as Normal-types have no resistances and only an immunity to Ghost. Couple this with Eviolite Chansey's inability to hold Leftovers, and it is not all that difficult to wear it down. Chansey is also extremely reliant on Eviolite and loses much of its usefulness if hit by Knock Off or, less commonly, Trick. Nonetheless, Chansey is still one of the best walls in the OU metagame and is a must-use on any stall team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter can net a surprise KO against physical attackers, but Chansey doesn't typically have room for the move. It also requires great prediction to use properly. Healing Wish can be used to bring one of Chansey's teammates back to full health, but Chansey is already a good enough cleric with Wish or Heal Bell.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: There are plenty of them in the OU metagame. Keldeo, Terrakion, Mega Heracross, and Breloom are all Pokemon that hit Chansey for super effective damage on its weaker Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Due to Chansey's lack of Leftovers, wallbreakers wear her down easily. For example, Knock Off Landorus-T 2HKOes Chansey after Knocking Off its Eviolite, physically based Kyurem-B often 2HKOes Chansey with a Life Orb-boosted Dragon Claw, Mega Gardevoir can Taunt Chansey and 3HKO it with Psyshock, and Taunt Gengar walls Chansey completely.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Knock Off</strong>: As Chansey relies heavily on Eviolite to tank attacks, it loses much of its tanking ability if hit by a Knock Off from the likes of Weavile, Bisharp, and Tornadus-T.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Taunt</strong>: If Chansey is hit by Taunt from a Pokemon such as Gengar, Talonflame, or Gliscor, it will be unable to do much, and the opponent can subsequently use it as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Status Avoiding</strong>: Chansey cannot spread status to Pokemon behind a Substitute, so sweepers such as Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo can use the move to gain a free turn of setup. Furthermore, if the Pokemon has a maximum HP of 404 or higher, Seismic Toss will fail to break the Substitute in one hit. Similar to Substitute, Lum Berry provides Pokemon with protection from Chansey's attempts to status them. Dragonite, for example, enjoys Lum Berry to protect itself from a single Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon that do not mind Toxic or Thunder Wave, such as Swords Dance Gliscor, Calm Mind Clefable, Swords Dance Mega Scizor, and Swords Dance Bisharp, can all use Chansey as setup bait.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "De Blob": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic and Thunder Wave allow Chansey to cripple opposing offensive Pokemon with a status effect, thus cutting their sweeps short. Soft-Boiled gives Chansey easy recovery, prolonging its presence on the field. It is crucial to keep Chansey healthy with Soft-Boiled, because it lacks Leftovers. Seismic Toss gives Chansey some offensive presence and will break Substitutes if the foe has less than 404 HP. Heal Bell lets Chansey act as a cleric, while Stealth Rock can be used to punish opposing switch-ins, allowing Chansey's teammates to sweep more easily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs maximize Chansey's physical and special bulk. Full investment in Special Defense maximizes Chansey's capabilities as a special wall, and a Bold nature is the best one to make Chansey as physically bulky as possible. Alternatively, you can use a spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD to truly maximize Chansey's physical bulk and to pass the largest Wishes possible to its teammates. Natural Cure grants Chansey an essential immunity to status problems, and Eviolite makes Chansey even bulkier, boosting its Defense and Special Defense by 1.5x.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Chansey's main jobs are tanking hits and spreading status. Lum Berry and Substitute are major problems for this set, as the foe can stop Chansey's attempt to give it a status ailment. Though Seismic Toss gives Chansey some offensive presence, it remains serious Taunt bait and will do little for the team if affected. Be cautious when trying to pass Wishes to teammates with low health, as the opponent can recognize this and send in a check or counter of their own. Moreover, because Roar and Whirlwind hit through Protect, Chansey can be phazed out when attempting to heal itself with Wish. If you are running Protect, use the move to scout users of Knock Off and Trick in order to preserve Chansey's Eviolite, as it is completely reliant on the item to tank hits well. Chansey is also very vulnerable to wallbreakers due to its lack of Leftovers. If you predict that a check or counter to Chansey is about to switch in, use Wish and go from there.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chansey works very well on dedicated stall teams, so it should be paired with stall team staples such as Quagsire, Clefable, and, Skarmory. Entry hazard removal is necessary, as Taunt users will easily force Chansey out, and you will be switching Pokemon around a lot in order to keep passing Wishes, provided you are running Wish. Starmie, Skarmory, and Zapdos can remove entry hazards while providing defensive utility. As Chansey will force a lot of switches herself, an entry hazard setter makes for a good partner. Tentacruel can both set and remove entry hazards, making it a prime choice. A user of Taunt such as Gengar or Mega Gardevoir can help against Pokemon with Substitute and phazing moves. You also need teammates that Chansey can support; you can pair it with nearly any setup sweeper in order to keep said sweeper healthy. Setup Pokemon that it can support include Bisharp, Keldeo, and Mega Altaria. A Mega Evolution such as Mega Scizor or Mega Venusaur can take a Knock Off for Chansey in order to preserve its Eviolite.</p>"

  "Starmie": {
    "overview": "<p>Starmie has several valuable assets that allow it to function effectively in OU, whether it's playing an offensive or supportive role. Access to Rapid Spin, a great move with limited distribution, coupled with a solid defensive typing and reliable recovery allows Starmie to reliably remove entry hazards against many teams due to its ability to force many switches. Such a role is further cemented by its excellent Speed stat, which allows Starmie to outpace most of the unboosted metagame. Its wide offensive and defensive movepool means it can be catered to its team's needs easily while having a limited number of switch-ins due to its wide coverage options. Starmie also has two good abilities that it can put to use, with Natural Cure being a godsend on defensive sets, reducing Starmie's vulnerability to status ailments, and Analytic giving it the power to truly threaten some of its switch-ins.</p> <p>However, there are a few drawbacks to using Starmie, the chief of which is that while its typing is strong from a defensive standpoint, its actual bulk is little better than average, meaning it can struggle to take repeated punishment from common offensive Pokemon such as Keldeo, particularly if it is attempting to use Rapid Spin. A flaw to Starmie's otherwise strong typing is a Dark-type weakness, which means that Starmie is liable to being Pursuit trapped and removed from play. This can somewhat be remedied by Reflect Type, but this requires strong prediction and uses up a moveslot, thus reducing Starmie's available options.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive set consisting of Rapid Spin, Recover, and two coverage moves is a viable option, as it provides utility, longevity, and offensive presence, allowing Starmie to take on attackers more easily due to Recover and still dish out powerful attacks of its own. Signal Beam hits Psychic-types such as Celebi, Slowbro, and Latios and essentially compresses the roles of Ice Beam and Thunderbolt in the event that hitting Flying-types for super effective damage is unnecessary. Toxic could be considered for the defensive set, which allows Starmie to put its bulky switch-ins, such as Slowbro and Tangrowth, on a timer. Forgoing Reflect Type or Psyshock is usually not worth it, though. Gravity is an option for the Life Orb set; setting it up on a potential switch and then using much more accurate Hydro Pumps can be devastating for offensive teams. It is best used alongside threats with powerful Ground-type moves, such as Landorus-T, thanks to Gravity negating Ground immunities. Gravity also allows Starmie to potentially use more powerful but less accurate moves such as Blizzard and Thunder. Starmie can utilize Choice sets with Trick; with Choice Specs, it gains a great deal of power, while with Choice Scarf it becomes an extremely fast revenge killer, albeit very weak. Giving up utility moves in Rapid Spin and Recover can also be unappealing, however. Starmie can also utilize Trick alongside a status Orb, usually Flame Orb due to the reluctance of Fire-types to switch in on Starmie. This allows it to cripple an opposing threat by removing its item as well as inflicting a burn. As an added bonus, Natural Cure will remove the status condition should Starmie hold on to the Orb one turn too long.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey, Clefable, Jirachi, and Mew are capable of switching into Starmie due to their good Special Defense and access to reliable recovery moves, meaning they can outlast offensive Starmie if need be. Calm Mind Clefable is also notable in that it uses Starmie as setup bait, especially weaker defensive variants, and can cripple offensive variants with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Due to their resistance to Starmie's strongest STAB move, bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Manaphy, Slowking, Jellicent, and Mega Gyarados are good answers to it. In particular, Slowking and Mega Gyarados also resist or are immune to Psychic, meaning they can switch into Starmie even more easily and cripple it with Thunder Wave or OHKO it with Crunch, respectively. However, Thunderbolt does quite a bit of damage to them, and Gyarados is vulnerable to Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Celebi, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth are good answers to Starmie due to their natural bulk and resistance to Hydro Pump. Both Celebi and Ferrothorn resist Psychic too and can KO Starmie back with their Grass-type STAB moves. Tangrowth, when equipped with an Assault Vest, is bulky enough to take repeated punishment from Psychic and Ice Beam and KO back with Leaf Storm or Knock Off. However, Ferrothorn fears a 2HKO from Hidden Power Fire, and an Analytic-boosted Ice Beam does quite a number against Tangrowth.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Pursuit trappers such as Scizor, Tyranitar, Weavile, and Bisharp can predict Starmie's switch and use Pursuit to trap and KO it. In particular, Bisharp can play mindgames with Starmie with Sucker Punch and Pursuit, and Weavile outspeeds Starmie entirely and can OHKO it with Knock Off. However, none of these Pokemon can switch in safely against Starmie for fear of getting OHKOed by Hydro Pump or crippled by Scald.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Even though they cannot switch directly into Starmie's Hydro Pump or Psychic, Electric-types such as Mega Manectric, Raikou, and Rotom-W are prime checks to Starmie. In particular, Mega Manectric outspeeds Starmie and OHKOes with Thunderbolt, while Raikou, if carrying an Assault Vest, can take any hit from Starmie and OHKO back with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Weavile, Mega Sceptile, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, Tornadus-T, Hawlucha, and Mega Lopunny can outspeed and KO Starmie due to its mediocre defenses.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is an extremely spammable STAB move that threatens anything that wants to switch into Starmie with the chance of a burn, allowing it to wear down its bulkier switch-ins and cripple physical attackers entirely. Rapid Spin is what gives Starmie its niche as a support Pokemon, allowing it to remove entry hazards while preserving its own, which can be extremely useful for balanced teams that utilize multiple hazards in order to wear the foe down. Recover gives Starmie longevity, potentially allowing it to outlast the opponent's entry hazard setters and remove their entry hazards permanently. It also allows Starmie to take on threats such as Keldeo and Mega Metagross multiple times, fulfilling an important defensive role for its team. The last slot is fairly team dependent in that it is usually decided by what role Starmie needs to fulfill for its team. Psyshock allows Starmie to comfortably switch into and beat Calm Mind Keldeo, which it would lose to otherwise, meaning it can switch into any Keldeo lacking a super effective Hidden Power comfortably. It also has decent coverage alongside Scald, hitting Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur, Dragalge, and Gengar. Hitting Gengar is particularly important, as it prevents it from attempting to spinblock Starmie. Reflect Type makes Starmie more reliable as a spinner, allowing it to evade Pursuit attempts from the likes of Bisharp and Scizor and potentially burn them with Scald. It has excellent utility in allowing Starmie to take on other Pokemon it could not before such as Magnezone, Ferrothorn, and Mega Charizard Y by copying their typing and utilizing it defensively to beat them in a one-on-one situation, as it outspeeds all variants of Magnezone, can cripple Ferrothorn with Scald, and can stall out Charizard's sun. An assortment of alternative moves can be run in the final moveslot depending on the team's needs. Ice Beam destroys defensive Garchomp while also hitting Mega Altaria, Celebi, and Lum Berry Dragonite. Thunderbolt can be used for Water-types such as Slowbro, Suicune, and opposing Starmie. It also has the advantage of hitting Keldeo for decent damage. Thunder Wave is also viable, as it lets Starmie cripple its offensive checks such as Manaphy, Mega Charizard X, and Tornadus-T on the switch. Toxic is another option to fare better against Calm Mind users such as Slowbro and Keldeo and cripple bulkier Pokemon such as Quagsire.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs allow Starmie to outspeed everything up to base 115 Speed Pokemon, including fast threats such as Serperior and Thundurus, as well as beating out the crowded 108 and 110 Speed tiers and Speed tying with Raikou, Mega Houndoom, and opposing Starmie. It also crucially beats Choice Scarf Magnezone by one point, allowing it to use Reflect Type to gain a resistance to both of its STAB moves and prevent it from gaining any real momentum with Volt Switch or KOing Starmie. 252 HP EVs make Starmie as bulky as possible, and the final 4 EVs are invested into Special Attack so that Psyshock is guaranteed to OHKO Gengar. Leftovers grants passive recovery, which aids Starmie tremendously in keeping it healthy. A Timid nature is also necessary, as Starmie's high base Speed of 115 is one of its main selling points, being able to outspeed threats such as Gengar and Keldeo. Natural Cure helps to heal stray Toxic and paralysis upon switching out, which is is invaluable for making sure Starmie sticks around for as long as needed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Starmie's primary role is keeping your side of the field clear of entry hazards, so it should be switched in as often as possible on entry hazard setters it doesn't fear, such as defensive Heatran, to clear entry hazards as they switch out. It is crucial for this set to remain healthy, as Starmie's bulk is not spectacular, and switching in on too many entry hazards will quickly put it in range of being KOed before it has done its job. Staying healthy also allow Starmie to continuously switch into the threats it takes on, such as Mega Metagross, Keldeo, and Heatran. Use Recover against Pokemon that don't pose a threat to Starmie, such as Heatran and, if using Psyshock, Keldeo. If Reflect Type is chosen, Starmie can use the opportunity after neutralizing the foe with Reflect Type to heal off any damage via Recover. Against Pursuit trappers such as Bisharp and Tyranitar and against Pokemon that cannot hurt Starmie should it copy their typing, such as Ferrothorn and Magnezone, Starmie should use Reflect Type, if applicable, in order to use Rapid Spin or Recover safely. Against Starmie's checks, such as Serperior and Slowbro, using Scald to potentially cripple them on the switch is greatly encouraged. Any opportunity to wear down opposing entry hazard setters should be used to maximum effect, as the burden on Starmie and its team is greatly eased when entry hazards are removed and cannot be put back up again.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is suited for balanced and defensive teams that utilize entry hazards to wear down the opposing team and, as such, would prefer a Rapid Spin user to a Defog user in order to maintain their own entry hazards. An excellent example of this would be a Spikes-stacking team, making Ferrothorn and Klefki strong partners. Fairy-types love Starmie's ability to switch into Mega Metagross and Heatran, so the likes of Mega Gardevoir, Togekiss, and Clefable fit well. In particular, Togekiss benefits from Starmie's Rapid Spin support and in turn deals with Grass-types, and Slowbro for Starmie. Mega Altaria lacking Earthquake also appreciates entry hazard removal and Starmie's ability to check Heatran. It goes without saying that Pokemon that appreciate entry hazards gone also benefit from Starmie's presence and can make for good teammates. Specially defensive Swords Dance Talonflame sets up on most Grass-types, and can wear down opposing teams with Will-O-Wisp, while Kyurem-B greatly appreciates entry hazards gone to increase its longevity and ability to wallbreak, especially with Life Orb recoil wearing it down as is. Defensive partners that can switch into the likes of Latios and Calm Mind Clefable, such as Ferrothorn and Heatran, are also strong partners to help Starmie out against its common switch-ins. Heatran is a great option in particular, as it can set up entry hazards of its own and Taunt these Pokemon to prevent them from using Defog. When running Psyshock over Reflect Type on Starmie, checks to potential Pursuit trappers, Knock Off users, and Dark-types in general are advised. Bulky Mega Scizor checks a great number of these while having decent synergy overall with Starmie, appreciating Starmie's ability to deal with Keldeo and Heatran.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin removes the opponent's entry hazards while preserving your own and takes full advantage of the many switches that this set forces. While Rapid Spin is a great selling point for using Starmie, if you already have a means of removing entry hazards on your team, Recover is a great choice for increasing Starmie's longevity and mitigating Life Orb recoil. It is also a good choice on teams not so reliant on entry hazard control. Hydro Pump is a powerful STAB move that, when combined with a potential Analytic boost, hits many switch-ins such as Clefable for good damage. Psychic allows Starmie to defeat certain Pokemon that resist Hydro Pump, such as Rotom-W, Mega Venusaur, and Suicune. Thunderbolt is also an option in this slot to hit common bulky Water-types that like to switch into Starmie, such as Manaphy, Slowbro, and Empoleon. Ice Beam allows Starmie to hit Grass- and Dragon-types such as Celebi and Dragonite while giving great coverage alongside Hydro Pump. Hidden Power Fire hits Ferrothorn, a common Starmie switch-in, for super effective damage and prevents it from resetting entry hazards that Starmie has spun away. It also hits Scizor reliably if you don't want to risk Hydro Pump missing. Psyshock is a viable option over Psychic if hitting Chansey, Blissey, Calm Mind Keldeo, and Assault Vest users such as Conkeldurr, Tornadus-T, and Raikou is more beneficial. While the slashes above may seem to signal a three-attacks-and-utility-move moveset, all-out attacking Starmie is perfectly viable if the extra coverage is needed to hit as many Pokemon as possible. With such a set, Starmie becomes a very difficult Pokemon to switch into for most teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Starmie requires maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature to function effectively as an offensive Pokemon, as without it, Starmie loses out on outpacing many Pokemon such as Gengar, Thundurus, and Serperior, as well as Speed tying with Raikou, Mega Houndoom, and opposing Starmie. Maximum Special Attack investment in tandem with Life Orb gives Starmie a much-appreciated power boost, as its base 100 Special Attack can often be underwhelming. 29 HP IVs are used to minimize Life Orb recoil. Analytic may seem like a weird choice on a Pokemon as fast as Starmie, but Starmie really benefits from it due to the number of switches it forces, gaining KOs it wouldn't have achieved otherwise, such as with Hydro Pump on Clefable and with Psychic on Rotom-W. Natural Cure is another viable option, as the offensive teams Starmie fits on rely on Starmie to switch into the likes of Keldeo, Slowbro, and Heatran, and Natural Cure will let Starmie heal off potential burns received from switching into Scald and Lava Plume. Another perk is letting Starmie get rid of paralysis from Prankster Thunder Wave from Thundurus and Klefki.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Offensive Starmie is more suited to offensive teams that can provide it with safe switches via Volt Switch, U-turn, or double switches. If entry hazards are present, prioritize their removal, but if there are no entry hazards that need removing, using an attacking move is generally beneficial. This Starmie set is very hard to switch into for offensive teams in particular thanks to its Speed and coverage, so it should take every opportunity it gets to launch attacks against these teams, as it can quickly rack up a lot of damage. Against more balanced teams, aim to predict potential switch-ins and hit them hard with the appropriate coverage move, wearing them down throughout the course of the battle. If Recover is chosen, Starmie should use the move mostly on forced switches against the likes of Keldeo and Heatran due to its poor natural bulk and lack of investment.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Rapid Spin, Starmie works best alongside Pokemon that appreciate Stealth Rock gone. The likes of Volcarona and Kyurem-B put huge offensive pressure on teams and massively appreciate not losing large amounts of health to entry hazards when they come in. Mega Charizard X not only appreciates Starmie's ability to keep entry hazards off the field, but also appreciates its ability to beat Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Landorus-T and potentially lure in Slowbro and KO it with Thunderbolt. In a similar vein, Mega Pinsir appreciates Starmie's ability to remove Stealth Rock, check the likes of Mega Diancie and Mega Metagross, and lure in Rotom-W and KO it with Psychic. With potentially no recovery and being susceptible to all entry hazards alongside Life Orb recoil, Starmie appreciates safe switches via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. Scizor in particular is a great partner for this, as it lures in a lot of Pokemon that Starmie can threaten such as Heatran. Another potential option is Mega Manectric, which can greatly threaten offensive teams thanks to its Speed and coverage, provide momentum with Volt Switch, and check threats such as Talonflame. Fighting-types such as Breloom, Conkeldurr, and Mega Lopunny are good partners, as they can deal with Dark-types such as Weavile, Tyranitar, and Bisharp, as well as Chansey and Blissey. In particular, Breloom can spread sleep via Spore and appreciates Starmie's ability to break past Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss.</p>"

  "Pinsir": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Pinsir is a powerful offensive threat with a high Attack stat that can be furthered by Swords Dance as well as Aerilate, which powers up its Normal-type moves and turns them into secondary STAB moves. Mega Pinsir's access to an Aerilate-boosted Quick Attack means that it is capable of outright OHKOing certain faster attackers, and with new additions to the metagame such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Sceptile, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Gallade, things have only gotten better for Mega Pinsir. Additionally, Mega Pinsir's decent bulk means that it doesn't find setting up too difficult. However, Pinsir is weak to Stealth Rock, especially after Mega Evolving, and it is shut down by burns and paralysis. Finally, a multitude of common threats, such as Talonflame, Rotom-W, Thundurus, Skarmory, Landorus-T, and Zapdos, are highly problematic for it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Double-Edge and Thrash can be chosen over Return by virtue of their higher Base Power, though their side effects (recoil damage and locking the user into the attack, respectively) are unappealing. Additionally, Double-Edge is illegal with both Quick Attack and Feint, and Mega Pinsir certainly does not wish to forgo priority. Stone Edge nails Zapdos, which can take any other moves from Pinsir and KO it with Thunderbolt. However, its coverage doesn't have any real uses outside of this. Substitute blocks status and protects Pinsir from being revenge killed, potentially stopping foes such as Rotom-W and Talonflame from halting a sweep. Earthquake can be used to OHKO Heatran and Mega Diancie without a boost as well as OHKO Mega Metagross at +2, but this is very situational, as Mega Diancie and Mega Metagross will rarely be hard switched into Mega Pinsir. Pinsir can attempt a Flail + Substitute strategy in a set, and should it reach 1 HP via use of Substitute, Mega Pinsir will have an impressive 200 Base Power Flying-type STAB move that is further boosted by Aerilate at its disposal. If Pinsir is partnered with Magnezone, Knock Off is an option, as it removes Shed Shells from Skarmory and Ferrothorn to allow Magnezone to trap them. Bulk Up is an alternative means of boosting, but Swords Dance is better, as Pinsir prefers the extra power to a Defense boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types resist Mega Pinsir's STAB moves, and faster ones, such as Thundurus, Mega Manectric, and Choice Scarf Magnezone, outspeed Mega Pinsir, can take a Quick Attack, and can OHKO it with a STAB attack. Thundurus resists Close Combat, is immune to Earthquake, and can directly KO Mega Pinsir with Thunderbolt or use Thunder Wave, which has priority thanks to Prankster, making it Pinsir vulnerable to being revenge killed. A boosted Close Combat only gets a 2HKO on Rotom-W, which can either burn Pinsir with Will-O-Wisp or hit it with Volt Switch in return, though Rotom-W should be cautious about switching in on Mold Breaker Pinsir. Finally, Zapdos's bulk and typing make it an excellent answer to Mega Pinsir; even after a Swords Dance, Return is only a 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers that are not KOed by Quick Attack</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Terrakion, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar can safely survive a Quick Attack and proceed to OHKO Mega Pinsir with Stone Edge. Mega Metagross also fits this category; after taking a Quick Attack, it can OHKO Mega Pinsir with Meteor Mash or Ice Punch after Stealth Rock damage. Weather sweepers such as Excadrill and Kabutops deter Pinsir from setting up, as both outspeed Pinsir under the effects of sand and rain, respectively, and can potentially OHKO it. Finally, Mega Diancie fears nothing except Earthquake and can OHKO Mega Pinsir with Diamond Storm.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers</strong>: OU is chock-full of powerful priority attackers that can pick off Mega Pinsir. Talonflame's Brave Bird will always outprioritize Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack thanks to Gale Wings, and it OHKOes Mega Pinsir at full health. Other Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Azumarill, and Bisharp can survive a Quick Attack from Pinsir and KO it when it is weakened with their respective priority attacks. However, Bisharp must be wary of its Sucker Punch failing should Mega Pinsir use Swords Dance or Quick Attack.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Skarmory can phaze Mega Pinsir with Whirlwind after taking a boosted hit, making Mega Pinsir lose its boosts. Alternatively, if Mega Pinsir is sufficiently weakened, then Skarmory can KO it with Brave Bird. In a similar vein, Hippowdon can tank a hit and phaze Mega Pinsir with Whirlwind. Landorus-T has Intimidate to neuter Mega Pinsir and can OHKO it with Stone Edge after taking a hit, though Pinsir has Hyper Cutter on the turn it Mega Evolves, nullifying Intimidate and allowing it to boost to +2 Attack instead of +1, guaranteeing a clean OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Pinsir despises being inflicted with a burn or paralysis from moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, respectively. When burned, Pinsir's damage output is cut, and when paralyzed, it is forced to rely on Quick Attack lest it be revenge killed. Thundurus and Sableye have +1 priority status-inducing moves at their disposal thanks to Prankster, making them threats to Mega Pinsir.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: The presence of Stealth Rock makes it difficult for Pinsir to set up and switch in and out of battle, especially after Mega Evolving.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Pinsir's Attack to frighteningly high levels, allowing it to tear through foes and do some late-game cleaning once its checks and counters are out of the way. Return becomes a mighty 199 Base Power Flying-type attack after Aerilate and STAB. Close Combat has great neutral coverage with Return, hitting Pokemon such as Heatran, Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Magnezone for super effective damage, and it inflicts neutral damage on targets such as Rotom-W. Quick Attack is an Aerilate-boosted priority attack that is surprisingly powerful; at +2, it OHKOes faster attackers such as Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Medicham. Feint can also be used in order to outprioritize Talonflame and OHKO it at +2 at the cost of being weaker overall; it also avoids contact damage, meaning that it can be useful for picking off very weakened Garchomp and Landorus-T, which commonly run Rocky Helmet.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Pinsirite enables Pinsir to Mega Evolve, allowing it to function as a fearsome late-game cleaner. Attack and Speed are maximized to give Pinsir the greatest possible chance of outspeeding and KOing its foes, and with a Jolly nature, Mega Pinsir outspeeds base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Charizard, Mega Gardevoir, and Mew. One can opt for an Adamant nature should they desire a greater damage output, though Pinsir is generally better off making the most of its Speed tier. Landorus-T, a common switch-in to Pinsir, has its Intimidate negated by Pinsir's Hyper Cutter. Pinsir also needs to keep its Attack from being lowered in order to OHKO defensive Landorus-T variants after a Swords Dance. Hyper Cutter in combination with Earthquake can also allow Pinsir to OHKO Mega Manectric if it tries to switch in the turn Pinsir Mega Evolves. Mold Breaker can be chosen as Pinsir's ability if you run Earthquake, as it allows Pinsir to strike Rotom-W for super effective damage on the switch in. Moxie is a possibility, as it enables Pinsir to nab an Attack boost should it pick off a weakened foe without Mega Evolving, though it isn't generally worth leaving Pinsir open to revenge killing with a middling base 85 Speed, and Pinsir should be doing its boosting via Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pinsir should be sent out to clean up late-game once its teammates have sufficiently removed or weakened Pokemon that could prove to be threatening. Ideally, a teammate should have removed Stealth Rock from your side of the field before you bring Pinsir in. Mega Evolution can be delayed to take advantage of Pinsir's ability; for example, Hyper Cutter variants should delay Mega Evolving and use Swords Dance if you predict defensive Landorus-T to switch in, Mold Breaker variants should delay Mega Evolving and use Earthquake if you predict that Rotom-W will switch in, and Moxie variants should attempt to revenge kill a weakened foe to net an Attack boost in the process. Similarly, Pinsir's typing prior to Mega Evolution can come in handy. For example, Pinsir can survive a Stone Edge or Rock Slide from checks such as defensive Landorus-T and Choice Scarf Excadrill, respectively, which its Mega Evolution cannot do.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock eats a chunk out of Pinsir's HP when it switches in, and this amount of damage is even higher if switches in after having Mega Evolved. Therefore, Rapid Spin or Defog support is mandatory. Excadrill can spin away entry hazards and handle any Thundurus that is not running Focus Blast. Latias also makes for a good partner, as it can provide Defog support as well as give a weakened Mega Pinsir about to fall prey to Stealth Rock a second chance with Healing Wish. Other Flying-type attackers such as Staraptor and Talonflame can lure in Pinsir's checks and wear them down so that the latter can clean up and finish the job. Rotom-W and Landorus-T are good answers to the ubiquitous Talonflame, which would otherwise ruin Mega Pinsir's cleaning spree. As Skarmory is such a menace for Mega Pinsir, it is only natural that one should pair the latter with Magnezone in order to trap and eliminate it. Like any offensive Pokemon, Pinsir appreciates entry hazard support in order to net KOs with greater ease. For example, after Stealth Rock, Heatran is OHKOed by an unboosted Close Combat, and Slowbro is very likely to be OHKOed by a +2 Return. Landorus-T, Mamoswine, and Heatran are examples of Stealth Rock setters.</p>"

  "Gyarados": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Gyarados's access to Crunch in combination with its ferocious Attack stat and acceptable Speed stat makes it a considerably more threatening Dragon Dance sweeper that is capable of taking huge chunks out of opposing teams. Gyarados has phenomenal bulk for an offensive Pokemon and retains critical resistances and immunities in both its Mega and non-Mega formes. Its typing, combined with Intimidate, allows Gyarados to excel not only as an offensive sweeper but also as a supportive defensive wall, checking multiple threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. Gyarados also has decent coverage throughout its limited but helpful movepool, although it generally has a hard time fitting all it needs onto a single set. Furthermore, having Mold Breaker in its Mega forme allows Mega Gyarados to break through certain abilities, such as Unaware, Sturdy, Magic Bounce, and Water Absorb. However, both Gyarados's base forme and Mega forme are prone to residual damage, especially Stealth Rock, and its lack of reliable recovery means that this damage will be present throughout the battle. Gyarados's Speed, while not unsalvageable, is also quite mediocre in a metagame full of speedy offensive threats, meaning that even after a Dragon Dance, there will still be certain Pokemon that outspeed Gyarados.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A defensive set with support moves such as Roar and Thunder Wave can work, but this takes away from Gyarados's offensive potential. An offensive Dragon Dance set with three attacks and a Lum Berry is an option, trading bulk for stronger offensive presence. Natural Gift with a Liechi Berry provides a 100-Base Power Grass-type attack that deals massive damage to bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Azumarill, and Slowbro while also having the potential to raise Gyarados's Attack by one stage when Gyarados is at low health. Cheri Berry not only cures paralysis from Pokemon such as Thundurus and Klefki once but also gives Gyarados a powerful Fire-type attack for Steel-types such as Scizor and Ferrothorn. Stone Edge hits Kyurem-B and Zapdos considerably harder than any other move. Life Orb breaks down physical walls such as Skarmory much more effectively, although the lack of Lum Berry or Leftovers and the residual damage from Life Orb hurt Gyarados's longevity on the field.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type Pokemon such as Breloom and Keldeo can revenge kill Gyarados, particularly when it has Mega Evolved, with their respective STAB attacks. Breloom can ignore potential Speed boosts and deal a hefty amount of damage with Mach Punch, while Gyarados needs prior damage to be able to KO them back.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Mega Manectric, Raikou, and Thundurus can revenge kill an unboosted Gyarados, with the last being able to ignore any Speed boosts and potentially paralyze Gyarados with Prankster Thunder Wave, leaving Gyarados open to revenge killing.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Skarmory, which has the potential to phaze Gyarados with Whirlwind or deal a massive amount of damage with Counter, Tangrowth, and bulky Garchomp all handle the majority of Gyarados's STAB attacks with relative ease.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers such as Talonflame, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, Mega Alakazam, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mach Punch users all have the possibility to beat Gyarados even after a Dragon Dance boost.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Priority Thunder Wave from Klefki and Thundurus severely hinders Gyarados for the rest of the battle, while burn chips away at its health and halves its Attack.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to Gyarados's lack of recovery, forms of residual damage such as Stealth Rock, Spikes, Rocky Helmet, and Iron Barbs quickly wear it down. Ferrothorn in particular takes minimal damage from Gyarados's attacks and can wear it down very quickly with the combination of Leech Seed and Iron Barbs.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-type Pokemon, particularly Mega Altaria, which only fears Ice Fang, Unaware Clefable, and Azumarill, take both of Mega Gyarados's STAB attacks with relative ease, although they take a hefty chunk of damage from Bounce.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance boosts both Gyarados's Attack and Speed stats to formidable levels, allowing it to outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame bar Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Alakazam, even with a Jolly nature. Crunch is a powerful STAB move that deals immense damage after an Attack boost, as well as hitting bulky Psychic-type Pokemon such as Jirachi, Slowbro, and Latias. Waterfall is a strong secondary STAB attack that not only has a chance to make the foe flinch but also deals heavy damage to Fire-, Fairy-, and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Heatran, Clefable, and Mega Lopunny. Ice Fang is one of Gyarados's best coverage options, hitting bulky Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Breloom, Amoonguss, Mega Altaria, and Garchomp. Substitute sacrifices a slight amount of Gyarados's HP and not only allows it to avoid status ailments and Leech Seed from Pokemon such as Mew and Amoonguss but also makes it harder for foes to revenge kill it. Earthquake is an option over Waterfall or Substitute that targets Keldeo as well as Rotom-W thanks to Mold Breaker. Alternatively, Taunt is an option to prevent defensive Pokemon such as Mega Sableye, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn from using recovery, status-inducing moves, or Leech Seed. Keep in mind that these coverage moves are highly interchangeable and can be easily altered to benefit the team's specific needs.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment allows Mega Gyarados to hit astonishingly hard with its moves thanks to its massive Attack stat. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Mega Gyarados to outspeed Dragonite without a boost, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Manectric. Gyaradosite allows Gyarados to Mega Evolve, while Intimidate slightly softens up physical attacks before Gyarados Mega Evolves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Finding the appropriate time to Mega Evolve Gyarados is critical. Keeping Gyarados's Flying typing, as well as keeping Intimidate, allows it to check Pokemon such as Excadrill, Keldeo, and Breloom much more easily than Mega Gyarados can. The timing of setting up a Dragon Dance is relevant as well, as due to Gyarados's fantastic bulk, it easily sets up on a large amount of the metagame, including Hippowdon, Gliscor, Bisharp, Starmie lacking Thunderbolt, and Victini locked into V-create. However, Gyarados's checks and counters, such as Keldeo and Azumarill, first have to be substantially weakened or outright KOed, as Gyarados will fall victim to them if it attempts to set up at the incorrect time.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Healing Wish support from Pokemon such as Jirachi, Latias, and Celebi helps Gyarados due to how quickly it gets worn down from potential residual damage from Stealth Rock, Iron Barbs, and status conditions. Furthermore, entry hazard removal is also crucial, as taking 25% damage upon entry harshly cuts into Gyarados's longevity. Latias fulfills both roles, while Excadrill can pressure Klefki and Electric-type Pokemon. Dragalge can support Gyarados by setting up Toxic Spikes to quickly wear down Pokemon that Gyarados might have issues against, checking Chesnaught and Keldeo decently and severely damaging Ferrothorn with Hidden Power Fire. Azumarill checks Keldeo while also surprising Ferrothorn with Superpower, meaning Gyarados doesn't have to attack Ferrothorn as often and thus takes less residual damage from Iron Barbs. Kyurem-B pressures a considerable number of Gyarados's checks such as Skarmory, Rotom-W, and Tangrowth, safely lures in Ferrothorn and KOs it with Hidden Power Fire, and can cripple Clefable with Iron Head on the predicted switch.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance raises Gyarados's already high Attack to immense levels while also increasing Gyarados's mediocre Speed stat. Bounce is a two-turn STAB attack that hits Fighting-, Bug-, and Grass-type Pokemon for super effective damage, gives Gyarados an extra turn of Leftovers recovery, and also has a chance to paralyze the opposing Pokemon. Waterfall is Gyarados's solid secondary STAB option, boasting decent power and hitting Rock-, Fire-, and Ground-type Pokemon while also forming a handy paraflinch combination with Bounce. Substitute sacrifices a slight amount of Gyarados's HP and allows it to bypass status conditions from the likes of Rotom-W, Mew, Gliscor, Heatran, and Amoonguss. In addition, Substitute allows Gyarados to avoid Leech Seed from Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur, preventing it from taking residual damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given HP and Defense EVs prevent Gyarados's Substitute from being broken by a burned Ferrothorn's Power Whip, allowing easier setup against it. The remaining EVs are implemented to maximize Gyarados's high Attack and Speed, allowing Gyarados to outspeed Mega Lopunny and Mega Manectric at +1 and KOing Choice Scarf Tyranitar at +1 Attack. Leftovers gives Gyarados important passive recovery each turn, slightly alleviating residual damage, especially from Stealth Rock, Rocky Helmet, and Iron Barbs. Intimidate allows Gyarados to lighten the damage taken from physical attacks, especially from Pokemon such as Excadrill, Talonflame, and Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The most appropriate time to set up Gyarados's Substitute is when anticipating an opposing Pokemon such as Mew, Clefable, or Mega Sableye to attempt to inflict status conditions onto Gyarados. Similarly, both Substitute and Dragon Dance are best used on Pokemon that Gyarados can comfortably force out with its dual STAB moves, including Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Jirachi, Excadrill, and Talonflame. Keep in mind that Bounce can give Gyarados an extra turn of Leftovers recovery if needed, potentially saving it from an attack that could KO it without the slight recovery.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal gives Gyarados much more accessible setup opportunities, as it will no longer lose a nasty 25% of its health upon switching into Stealth Rock. Thus, Gyarados appreciates Pokemon such as Excadrill, Latios, and Latias which can clear entry hazards using Rapid Spin or Defog. Starmie can not only use Rapid Spin but severely damages Rotom-W as well as lure in Ferrothorn and hits it with Hidden Power Fire so Gyarados will not be forced to take as much residual damage from Iron Barbs. Healing Wish support from Pokemon including Celebi, Latias, and Jirachi not only restores Gyarados's HP and cures its possible status conditions, but it also gives Gyarados a second chance to sweep teams thanks to full recovery. As a result of Gyarados's inability to break through specific defensive Pokemon, such as Unaware Clefable and, to a lesser extent, Quagsire, Pokemon that can pressure said Pokemon, such as Mega Venusaur and Power Herb + Solar Beam Heatran, are good teammates. Bulky Ground-types such as Excadrill, Hippowdon, and Garchomp share considerably strong type synergy, patching up Gyarados's weaknesses to Electric- and Rock-type attacks. Landorus-T also lures in bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Slowbro and cripples them with Explosion and the rare Toxic. Wallbreakers that can tear apart defensive cores that Gyarados might have issues with can support it before an attempted sweep; examples include Kyurem-B and Azumarill.</p>"

  "Ditto": {
    "overview": "<p>By virtue of its Hidden ability, Ditto makes for one of the greatest revenge killers in the game. This ability, Imposter, allows Ditto to instantly transform into the Pokemon it switches into, copying said Pokemon's moves, ability, and typing in addition to every stat except HP. This not only allows Ditto be an excellent revenge killer with a Choice Scarf, but also lets it scout movesets of unpredictable Pokemon. Ditto can also perform well on teams that have a weakness to setup sweepers because it naturally deters the opponent from setting up. Ditto also has the ability to copy an opponent's Mega Pokemon, potentially allowing the use of two Mega Pokemon on a team at once. Outside of these roles, Ditto can do very little, and as a result it is a very one-dimensional Pokemon. Additionally, Ditto's HP stat is pitifully low, something only made worse by its susceptibility to every damaging entry hazard. Ditto also struggles to perform effectively against more defensively inclined teams, making it hard to fit into a team slot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ditto's other options are extremely limited because there are so few things that can be changed. However, one aspect of Ditto that one can alter is its Hidden Power type. Setting Ditto's IVs to 30 Atk / 30 SpA / 0 Spe achieves a Hidden Power type of Fire, and is an option that gives Ditto the ability to outspeed and finish off weakened Magnezone. While having a Choice Scarf is very important, one could potentially opt to use a Focus Sash Ditto instead. This would make Ditto be able to survive a hit from a Pokemon it copies, but faces the risk of being broken by entry hazards. In a similar vein, a Red Card could be used to switch into resisted hits of a sweeper and phaze it out. However, this, of course, is unreliable due to the possibility that Ditto will have to switch out and waste the boosts that it steals.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ditto has no real universal counters because what counters it will depend on what Pokemon it transforms into. However, Ditto does have some exploitable flaws:</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Due to Transform's mechanics, a Pokemon behind a Substitute or under the effect of the irrelevant Illusion will not be copyable with Imposter. This means any Pokemon equipped with a Substitute will be able to deny Ditto of the ability to transform.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind / Quiver Dance</strong>: Some Calm Mind and Quiver Dance sweepers are capable of beating Ditto in a one-on-one scenario, as they will be able to continue boosting or healing while Ditto will be locked into a move. For instance, a bulky Volcarona variant can continue boosting on Ditto, while Ditto will be locked into its Fire-type STAB.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: After Ditto has already transformed, many Pokemon are able to retaliate, but as already mentioned, which ones will almost always depend on what it has transformed into.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>There's little to address when talking about Ditto's moves; Transform is its only legal one. It is used on this set because it is impossible for a Pokemon to have no moves. Its only real use is preventing Ditto from using Struggle immediately if Imposter fails.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Scarf is the only viable item on Ditto, as it ensures that Ditto can outspeed the setup sweepers that it transforms into. No other item can possibly replace the utility provided by a Choice Scarf. The HP stat should be invested into when using a Ditto as much as possible, as HP is the only stat that transfers over upon Imposter activation. Maximum investment in Defense decreases damage that Ditto takes from a Struggle war with another Ditto. A Relaxed nature is used to obtain the lowest Speed for the possible, albeit rare, Struggle war mentioned previously. Ditto also uses minimum Speed IVs for this reason and to give itself a Hidden Power type of Ice to revenge kill threats such as Thundurus.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As a revenge killer, Ditto is best brought out in response to a Pokemon fainting or from a teammate's successful U-turn or Volt Switch. It is best only to attempt to revenge kill with Ditto, because if it switches in as a Pokemon sets up, it won't get the stat boosts and is likely to lose the matchup. If one is using Ditto to revenge kill a Pokemon that has not revealed any status moves, it is worth considering if the opponent also has a Choice Scarf. If both Pokemon possess a Choice Scarf, the turn order is based on a coin flip and one might wind up losing their Ditto. Alternatively, you can also use Ditto to scout and check the movesets of opponents so that you know what to expect later in the game. This is particularly useful for Pokemon such as Jirachi, which can run a large variety of movesets. Ditto can also be used to copy an opposing Mega Pokemon that threatens itself and attempt to sweep the opponent, such as Mega Pinsir or Mega Lopunny. Good use of this ability can let you overwhelm your opponent with both a copied Mega Pokemon as well as your own. Ditto is a Pokemon that generally struggles against stall; in spite of this, if against a stall team, one can make use of Ditto to steal or eliminate the opponent's entry hazards.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Even though Ditto is generally a Pokemon that glues together a team rather than being built around, there are a few distinct Pokemon that it works well with. Primarily, due to Ditto's susceptibility to entry hazards, a Pokemon with Defog or Rapid Spin can be an excellent teammate. Starmie is a Pokemon that can spin away entry hazards, and in return, Ditto deters any Pokemon from using Starmie as setup fodder. Similarly, any grounded Poison-type is also useful for Toxic Spikes absorption. Examples of this include Tentacruel and Dragalge. For more offensive options, Scizor and Ditto can partner up to form a potent scouting and revenge killing core.</p>"

  "Omastar": {
    "overview": "<p>Omastar is one of the most solid Pokemon to use on rain teams because it can aid other sweepers, such as Kingdra and Kabutops. On top of that, its immediate power causes it to force the opposition either to sack a Pokemon or to have one of their walls take massive damage, and in most scenarios, Hydro Pump will easily 2HKO whatever Omastar is facing. Omastar also checks Talonflame and Mega Pinsir, giving it a niche unique to only itself and Kabutops. However, Omastar is outpaced by common Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Keldeo and is very reliant on rain to do its job. It also compounds rain teams' Thundurus weakness, meaning it has to be played carefully. Omastar also faces competition from Kabutops because of their similar typings, so having both on the same team is unfavorable in most scenarios.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Omastar does not have many other options. Hidden Power Grass can be used to beat Gastrodon, but losing Knock Off is huge. A Shell Smash set is possible, but priority users being able to pick it off and such a set's continued trouble with Ferrothorn and Thundurus makes it hard to consider. However, it completely destroys stall teams with some of its checks weakened. For instance, Chansey is 2HKOed after a boost while unable to do anything back except Toxic or Seismic Toss.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Omastar is quite slow, so faster Choice Scarf users, such as Garchomp, can outspeed it even under rain and KO it with a powerful attack.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Chansey and Blissey, as well as tanks such as Assault Vest Goodra, can take Omastar's hits with relative ease and can either cripple or outright KO it, but they all must watch out for Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Omastar is weak to a few common priority attacks; Mach Punch from Conkeldurr or Technician Breloom will easily take it out.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Although Omastar has Ice Beam to handle most Grass-types, there are a few that it just can't deal with. Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn both take neutral damage from Ice-type attacks thanks to Thick Fat and its Steel typing, respectively. Both Pokemon also have 4x super effective STAB Grass-type moves to take Omastar down with ease; however, Ferrothorn can be worn down easily, and Mega Venusaur is 2HKOed by Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock, so be cautious. Though it is weak to Ice Beam, Amoonguss is also a good check to Omastar because of Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Omastar has a hard time dealing with opposing Water-types. Gyarados takes neutral damage from Ice Beam and Hidden Power Grass, and bulky variants of it essentially counter Omastar, especially those with Earthquake. Rotom-W is also a bulky Water-type that can take down Omastar with its STAB Electric-type moves. Empoleon and Assault Vest Azumarill are other good options, but all of these are soft counters because they can be worn down very easily and still take massive damage from Hydro Pump.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Omastar's main STAB move when bulky walls such as Mega Venusaur are still in play, as it can 2HKO them after Stealth Rock damage. However, Scald remains Omastar's main choice against more offensive teams because it hits more than hard enough and can spread burns. Ice Beam is an obligatory coverage move, handy for hitting Grass-types. Knock Off hits the most common switch-in to Omastar, Chansey, for good damage and removes its Eviolite so that Omastar can 2HKO it later.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature, Choice Specs, and maximum Special Attack investment are required to let Omastar wallbreak and clean effectively. A Life Orb can be used to switch moves, but recoil damage makes Omastar lose a lot of power as well as its ability to check Talonflame well.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Omastar should be played recklessly by spamming Hydro Pump against stall teams and using Knock Off to remove Chansey's Eviolite and Azumarill's Assault Vest on the switch. Scald should be used to clean up weakened teams if Omastar is still alive late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Politoed is obviously a mandatory teammate to set up rain. Kingdra is an excellent partner for Omastar because they share checks and counters, most notably Ferrothorn, and can slowly break past them with their powerful Hydro Pumps, allowing one to sweep the remainder of the opposition. Defog Latios and Latias are great for removing entry hazards because Omastar will switch out a lot. Pokemon that can check Thundurus, such as Mega Manectric, Magnezone, and Raikou, are valuable teammates for Omastar. They can also safely use Thunder thanks to Politoed's rain. Mega Heracross can break past Omastar's soft counters, such as Mega Venusaur, Assault Vest Azumarill, Empoleon, and Amoonguss, making it a very good team option. Solid pivots such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W are also useful to allow Omastar to get onto the field safely. Healing Wish Jirachi and Latias are also excellent teammates because they allow Omastar a second chance to sweep.</p>"

  "Kabutops": {
    "overview": "<p>Kabutops is one of the best Pokemon on rain hyper offense, due to its ability, Swift Swim, and great Attack, which lets it 2HKO some of the best physical walls in the OU metagame after a Swords Dance. While Kabutops has a small movepool, it has everything it needs. The only Pokemon not covered by its STAB moves alone, Ferrothorn, loses to a Swords Dance-boosted Low Kick. Gastrodon and Chesnaught are 2HKOed by Low Kick on the switch as well. Another great trait about Kabutops is that it stops Talonflame on rain offense teams. However, despite all that Kabutops has going for it, it does have some flaws, including lackluster Special Defense and a mediocre defensive typing, meaning that its decent Defense stat rarely comes into play. Another glaring flaw is that outside of rain, Kabutops isn't an excellent Pokemon due to the huge drop in Speed. Nonetheless, Kabutops is an excellent sweeper to use on rain teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kabutops can run a utility/support set consisting of Rapid Spin, Stealth Rock, Waterfall, and Stone Edge. However, Kabutops would rather use its offensive presence instead of being supportive to a team. Hone Claws could be used to boost its Attack by one stage rather than two, but boost the accuracy of Stone Edge as well. Knock Off is a nice utility move but it gains no additional coverage. Lastly, Kabutops can use a Lum Berry to escape the consequences of a burn or paralysis, which would halve its Attack or quarter its Speed, respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Weather Control</strong>: Any other weather, with the occasional exception of Sand due to the Special Defense boost, is bad for Kabutops. This removes the boost to Water-type moves and the Speed boost from Swift Swim.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur completely walls Kabutops as Kabutops can't OHKO it with a boosted Stone Edge and Mega Venusaur can OHKO with a STAB Grass-type attack. Chesnaught has high defenses, resists both of Kabutops's STAB types, and can OHKO it with Wood Hammer. Gourgeist has high enough Defense to take a Stone Edge and can burn Kabutops. Breloom also resists both of Kabutops's STAB types and can use Bullet Seed to OHKO. Ferrothorn can completely counter Kabutops if Kabutops does not have Low Kick.</p> <p><strong>Counter-types</strong>: Keldeo resists both of Kabutops's STAB types, isn't heavy enough to take considerable damage from Low Kick, and OHKOes with Secret Sword. Rotom-W can live an unboosted Stone Edge and can use Volt Switch or Will-O-Wisp to beat Kabutops. Thundurus can OHKO Kabutops and can live a single unboosted Aqua Jet. Lastly, Gastrodon resists both of Kabutops's STAB types and can 2HKO with Earth Power or burn Kabutops with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Prankster</strong>: Sableye can use Prankster Will-O-Wisp and then OHKO with Foul Play if Kabutops has used Swords Dance. Klefki can use Thunder Wave to take away the Speed boost from Rain.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gyarados</strong>: Gyarados can set up on an -1 Kabutops thanks to Intimidate and OHKO with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Terrakion</strong>: Terrakion can only check Kabutops if Kabutops does not have Aqua Jet or a Speed-boosting nature, but it can OHKO with Close Combat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Waterfall is the primary STAB move, which is boosted under rain and is capable of OHKOing most offensive Pokemon. Stone Edge is the secondary STAB attack and has excellent coverage alongside Waterfall. Swords Dance allows Kabutops to boost its already good Attack, but Rapid Spin can also be used if necessary, providing utility at the cost of power. However, Swords Dance is preferred because a +2 Waterfall in the rain OHKOes Skarmory after Stealth Rock. Low Kick is an awesome move for dealing with Pokemon that resist Kabutops's STAB types, such as Ferrothorn, but Aqua Jet is good for revenge killing.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack and Speed EVs maximize Kabutops's offensive potential. Life Orb provides a significant power boost at the cost of some HP. An Adamant nature provides a power boost, as a Jolly nature only allows Kabutops to beat Choice Scarf Terrakion, which can be handled by Aqua Jet.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kabutops is free to sweep when its counters or checks are taken out or weakened. If your Politoed must be sacrificed, be sure that you can bring Kabutops out straight after. Under normal circumstances, rain lasts just long enough for Kabutops to sweep, but only if brought out right after rain is set up. Kabutops functions even better as a sweeper after a boost from Swords Dance. The best times to use Swords Dance is when Kabutops can force out the opponent, such as when against Charizard Y, or when it can finish them off with an Aqua Jet, which is a situation where you can predict them to switch. If at any given time Kabutops needs to switch out to avoid being OHKOed, switch it out, even if it means losing the last turns of rain.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Politoed is one of the best Pokemon you could ever team Kabutops up with, and for one sole reason: Drizzle. Drizzle causes rain to start when Politoed switches in, and rain is necessary for Kabutops to function. Tornadus is also a great rain setter, as it has access to priority Rain Dance due to Prankster. Most Stealth Rock setters can work well with Kabutops, as it slowly weakens the opposing team and knocks certain Pokemon into KO range. Mega Scizor works well with Kabutops under rain due to the fact that Fire-type moves are weakened, and Mega Scizor has decent special bulk. Latios also works well with Kabutops, as it can beat many Pokemon that mess with its rain offense. Rotom-W is immune to Earthquake, which threatens Kabutops, and provides the utility of Volt Switch, as well as also getting a huge boost from the rain when using Hydro Pump. Lastly, Kingdra breaks many walls Kabutops has trouble with, and works well with Swift Swim as well, forming an offensive rain core.</p>"

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Aerodactyl has cemented itself as a terrifying offensive threat in the OU metagame for a variety of reasons. One of the most important aspects is its blistering Speed tier, outspeeding the majority of the metagame, including speedy threats such as Alakazam, Mega Manectric, Mega Lopunny, and Tornadus-T. Combine this with its decent Attack stat and its broad movepool, with the majority of its moves being further bolstered by Tough Claws, and Mega Aerodactyl is able to serve as an incredible revenge killer and late-game cleaner. Adding onto these positive traits, it is able to check a vast array of threats such as Tornadus-T, Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Mega Charizard X, and Volcarona as a result of its decent bulk and valuable defensive typing.</p> <p>Sadly, Mega Aerodactyl's weakness to the common Stealth Rock limits the number of times it is able to switch in if lacking Roost. Furthermore, even though its typing is decent, it has troublesome weaknesses to common priority moves in Aqua Jet, Ice Shard, and Bullet Punch. Mega Aerodactyl also has issues breaking through defensively-oriented teams, as the prevalence of bulky Garchomp, Slowbro, and Clefable can make its life miserable.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hone Claws gives Mega Aerodactyl the opportunity to boost its Attack and accuracy by one stage, mitigating Stone Edge's shaky accuracy. Tailwind raises Mega Aerodactyl's team's Speed for three turns, allowing slower teammates to outspeed threats they normally would not. Iron Head hits Fairy-type Pokemon such as Clefable, Sylveon, and Mega Altaria harder than Stone Edge thanks to the Tough Claws boost. A non-Mega set utilizing Focus Sash, Stealth Rock, and Double-Edge allows Aerodactyl to act as a fantastic suicide lead, as Double-Edge makes it KO itself after it is brought down to its Focus Sash, meaning that the foe cannot remove the hazards with Rapid Spin or Defog.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Rotom-W, Mega Swampert, Quagsire, Seismitoad, Alomomola, Suicune, and Azumarill take Aerial Ace and Stone Edge with ease and can retaliate with Scald or, in Azumarill's case, revenge kill with Aqua Jet. Slowbro is a particularly hard counter due to its immense physical bulk, reliable recovery in Slack Off, and ability to set up on Mega Aerodactyl with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Garchomp, Gastrodon, and Landorus-T are good answers to Mega Aerodactyl, especially the latter two, with Garchomp being neutral to Aqua Tail and Landorus-T having Intimidate. Physically defensive variants of Hippowdon are capable of avoiding the 2HKO from Aqua Tail as well. Gastrodon avoids the 2HKO from Aerial Ace, has Storm Drain to prevent any damage from Aqua Tail, and can proceed to hit back hard with Scald. Defensive Garchomp is a good counter, too, as Rocky Helmet chips away at Mega Aerodactyl, meaning that even if it packs Ice Fang, Mega Aerodactyl's health will have been depleted somewhat anyway. In turn, these Ground-types can cripple Mega Aerodactyl with Toxic, phaze it with Dragon Tail in Garchomp's case, or KO it with Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Users of Bullet Punch, Aqua Jet, and Ice Shard such as Scizor, Azumarill, Weavile, Mega Medicham, and Mamoswine can easily pick off a weakened Mega Aerodactyl. Thundurus, Sableye, and Klefki can also cripple Mega Aerodactyl with Prankster Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp, respectively. However, none of these Pokemon can directly switch in for fear of Fire Fang, Stone Edge, and Aqua Tail.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Klefki, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Empoleon, and Skarmory can switch into Mega Aerodactyl and KO it back with their respective STAB moves or, in Klefki's and Empoleon's case, cripple it with Thunder Wave or Scald, respectively. Mega Aerodactyl's Fire Fang fails to 2HKO Empoleon, Mega Metagross, and physically defensive Skarmory, while Earthquake fails to 2HKO Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn and doesn't affect Skarmory; such variants also lose to Magnet Rise Klefki.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Mega Aerodactyl has difficulty breaking past certain Fairy-type Pokemon. Mega Altaria, particularly if it's a defensive variant, fears only the rare Ice Fang and can hit back hard with Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice or Return while healing off any damage it may have taken with Roost. Clefable can either set up Calm Mind on Mega Aerodactyl or cripple it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp, Keldeo, Landorus-T, and Latios can all outspeed Mega Aerodactyl and KO it with their respective coverage moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stone Edge is Mega Aerodactyl's hardest-hitting STAB attack, hitting most targets for phenomenal damage, even without the boost from Tough Claws. Aerial Ace targets Pokemon such as Keldeo, Tangrowth, Celebi, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Venusaur and, unlike Stone Edge, gets the power boost from Tough Claws. Aqua Tail provides solid coverage against bulky Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon, such as Gliscor, Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Excadrill, Mega Diancie, and Tyranitar, which might otherwise be able to tank Mega Aerodactyl's STAB attacks. Fire Fang roasts Steel-type Pokemon that resist Mega Aerodactyl's STAB types, such as Ferrothorn, Magnezone, Scizor, Jirachi, Skarmory, and Bisharp. Taunt is an alternative option that prevents defensively-oriented Pokemon such as Clefable, Heatran, Chansey, Mew, and Skarmory from setting up entry hazards, inflicting status conditions, and, most importantly, healing. Ice Fang demolishes Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, hitting them harder than Aqua Tail does. Earthquake hits Jirachi, Magnezone, Bisharp, and Mega Metagross harder than Fire Fang, while having the added benefit of 2HKOing Empoleon and Mega Manectric. It also targets Rock-types such as Mega Diancie, Terrakion, and Tyranitar. Roost can provide longevity against Talonflame, preventing Mega Aerodactyl from being worn down easily. Taunt can prevent common switch-ins such as Skarmory from setting up Stealth Rock and Spikes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>By running a Jolly nature, Mega Aerodactyl is able to maintain its absurd Speed tier, allowing it to outpace the likes of Talonflame, Mega Lopunny, Mega Manectric, and Mega Beedrill. 252 Attack EVs allow Mega Aerodactyl to maximize its offensive potential, dealing heavy damage with its attacks. Unnerve is used before Mega Evolution, as it prevents the use of assorted Berries, such as Custap Berry on Skarmory and Sitrus Berry Hawlucha. However, Pressure can be useful for lead situations scouting for certain items. For example, against an opposing Landorus-T, you can find out whether it is equipped with Choice Scarf or Leftovers, as Pressure has identical priority with Intimidate.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Aerodactyl should primarily be used as a late-game sweeper or a revenge killer. It is able to revenge kill the likes of Mega Lopunny, Serperior, Talonflame, unboosted Mega Charizard X, and non-Choice Scarf Keldeo, provided that it can enter the battlefield via Volt Switch, U-turn, or a double switch. A sweep should only be attempted when all foes are in KO range of Mega Aerodactyl's attacks. Overestimating its power could be costly, though, as it isn't particularly powerful, especially considering that Stone Edge is not powered up by Tough Claws. Mega Aerodactyl can also be brought in early in the match to wear down its more passive checks, especially if it carries Taunt to prevent the likes of Clefable and Hippowdon from recovering health. Mega Aerodactyl can occasionally switch into certain Fire- and Flying-type attacks, such as Heatran's Fire Blast and Talonflame's Brave Bird. However, if lacking Roost, be wary of switching it into these attacks more than twice.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone is an ideal teammate, as it can trap and KO Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Jirachi and eliminate Water-types such as Rotom-W, Suicune, and Slowbro. This frees up Mega Aerodactyl's final moveslot, allowing it to run Taunt with less worry. Defog and Rapid Spin users such as Excadrill, Latias, Latios, and Starmie are able to remedy Mega Aerodactyl's Stealth Rock weakness, giving it more opportunities to switch in. Latias, Latios, and Starmie also wipe out Water- and Ground-types that give Mega Aerodactyl issues. Fighting-types such as Breloom, Terrakion, Toxicroak, and Conkeldurr appreciate Mega Aerodactyl's ability to remove Fire- and Flying-types. Grass-types can defeat bulky Water- and Ground-types that Mega Aerodactyl might struggle against. Serperior in particular annihilates bulkier teams that Mega Aerodactyl has issues breaking past, dealing with the likes of Rotom-W, Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Garchomp comfortably. In return, Mega Aerodactyl checks Pokemon like Talonflame, Volcarona, Tornadus-T, and Alakazam. Entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Dragalge, and Ferrothorn back up Mega Aerodactyl, by greatly wearing down its checks, giving it a better opportunity to sweep the opposing team. Dragalge can provide wallbreaking potential on top of Toxic Spikes, dealing with the likes of Slowbro, Rotom-W, Clefable, and Azumarill. Other wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B, Manaphy, Keldeo, and Azumarill are prime teammates, as they are able to break past bulky walls such as Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Clefable. Hidden Power Fire on Manaphy or Kyurem-B surprises Ferrothorn and Scizor, allowing Mega Aerodactyl to drop Fire Fang and run Taunt.</p>"
      },
      "Pursuit Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Pursuit gives Mega Aerodactyl the opportunity to trap a multitude of Pokemon that may attempt to switch out, such as Gengar, Latios, Latias, Starmie, Tornadus-T, Talonflame, and unboosted Mega Charizard X, allowing them to be revenge killed easier later in the match, hinder their sweeping capabilities, or outright KOing them. The combination of Aerial Ace and Aqua Tail have fantastic coverage together, threatening a large majority of the metagame. Stone Edge can be used if your team is particularly weak to Talonflame or Charizard, and lacking Stone Edge means that the likes of Tornadus-T and Thundurus do not fear staying in as much as they normally would. This results in Mega Aerodactyl not being able to properly Pursuit trap them, however. Fire Fang prevents Scizor and Ferrothorn from setting up Swords Dance or entry hazards on Mega Aerodactyl. However, the combination of Aerial Ace and Aqua Tail generally is more threatening towards offensive teams, making Aqua Tail the better option in most situations. Roost gives Mega Aerodactyl a reliable form of recovery, which is easy to take advantage of thanks to its typing and decent bulk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>By using a Jolly nature and investing 216 EVs into Speed, Mega Aerodactyl is able to outpace everything up to Mega Beedrill and Mega Sceptile. 252 Speed EVs can be used to Speed tie with Mega Alakazam and opposing Mega Aerodactyl, although opposing Mega Alakazam will generally try to switch out, knowing that Psychic will not be able to OHKO, allowing Mega Aerodactyl to Pursuit trap it efficiently. 124 Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO on Serperior with Aerial Ace after Stealth Rock damage. The remaining EVs are placed into HP, giving Mega Aerodactyl extra bulk that works well in tandem with its good typing and reliable recovery. These EVs also guarantee that Mega Aerodactyl is able to survive a Life Orb Latios's Draco Meteor from full health, allowing it to 2HKO it with Pursuit 100% of the time after Life Orb recoil. A more EV offensive spread of 128 HP / 244 Atk / 136 Speed and a Jolly nature is viable as well; the 136 Speed EVs allow Mega Aerodactyl to outpace Mega Lopunny and Mega Manectric.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Aerodactyl is a phenomenal Pursuit trapper, with the added bonus of being a fantastic revenge killer, thanks to its great Speed and surprise factor. Many offensive Pokemon such as Gengar, Starmie, Latios, Latias, Celebi, and Alakazam will believe it is a safe option to switch out, thinking Mega Aerodactyl is being played as a revenge killer, only for them to take massive damage from an incoming Pursuit. Because of its good typing and decent bulk, Mega Aerodactyl has a massive advantage in being able to switch into and Pursuit trap a variety of Pokemon that would normally like to switch out, such as Tornadus-T, Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Thundurus lacking Thunder Wave. On top of Pursuit trapping, you can also use Mega Aerodactyl as a decently powerful revenge killer, being able to defeat Pokemon such as Keldeo, Serperior, and Mega Lopunny, and Mega Aerodactyl will still pose a threat to offensive teams thanks to its blistering Speed tier even with the loss of coverage moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can lure in and remove opposing Steel-types, such as Hidden Power Fire Manaphy and Watmel Berry Azumarill, can help break down Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Mega Scizor, allowing Mega Aerodactyl to switch in more easily. Magnezone can trap and defeat many of Mega Aerodactyl's checks, such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Together, the two form a dual trapping core. Entry hazard removal is a necessity, as losing 25% of its HP upon each switch into Stealth Rock greatly hampers Mega Aerodactyl's longevity. Latios and Latias are particularly exceptional entry hazard removers, as they are able to switch in and defeat most bulky Water-types. Starmie is a valuable Rapid Spin user, thanks to its ability to lure in the likes of Rotom-W, Suicune, and Slowbro and defeat them each with Psychic and Thunderbolt. It also beats Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp. Rotom-W can gain momentum via Volt Switch and switch into bulky Garchomp without many issues. Amoonguss shares fantastic type synergy with Mega Aerodactyl, being able to threaten Rock-, Water-, and Ground-types, and it can also put foes to sleep with Spore. Pokemon that appreciate Mega Aerodactyl's Pursuit support include Serperior, Keldeo, Kyurem-B, Manaphy, Volcarona, and Alakazam, as the move substantially weakens faster threats. These Pokemon also plow through certain bulkier Pokemon such as Slowbro, Garchomp, and Hippowdon that Mega Aerodactyl struggles against, and Keldeo in particular is able to defeat Weavile and Scizor without much worry. Heatran takes on Latios and Latias and can lure in bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Azumarill and proceed to KO them with Power Herb Solar Beam. Both Tyranitar and Hippowdon are able to provide sand for Mega Aerodactyl, boosting its Special Defense substantially, although you must be wary of the overlapping weaknesses. Only defensive Tyranitar should be used alongside it, as Choice Scarf or Choice Band sets overlap with Mega Aerodactyl's role of Pursuit trapping. Defensive variants are able to set up Stealth Rock and are able to lure in Garchomp and Landorus-T and hit them hard with Ice Beam.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Taunt denies any hazard setup attempts from Pokemon like Garchomp, Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, Clefable, and Excadrill while also denying Taunt from opposing leads like Azelf, or non-Mental Herb Shuckle and Mew, letting Aerodactyl safely set up Stealth Rock before going down. Earthquake threatens Heatran with an OHKO while also threatening to 2HKO Excadrill. Defog is useful later in the game, allowing Aerodactyl to remove entry hazards and dual screens. Finally, Double-Edge allows Aerodactyl to sacrifice itself if it is brought down to low HP, preventing the opponent from using Rapid Spin to get rid of Stealth Rock while also allowing a teammate a free entry. Iron Head can also be used to allow Aerodactyl to set up Stealth Rock on Mega Diancie.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment is required to outspeed Choice Scarf Volcanion. The given HP and Defense EVs allow a favorable roll to survive the combination of Fake Out and High Jump Kick from Mega Lopunny. Rocky Helmet punishes Pokemon that use contact moves such as Rapid Spin from Excadrill and the combination of Fake Out and High Jump Kick from Mega Lopunny. A Focus Sash is a solid alternative to survive a super effective attack from full HP to guarantee setting up Stealth Rock, but this does make Aerodactyl weaker against Mega Lopunny and Excadrill. Pressure is Aerodactyl's preferred ability to reduce the PP of moves such as Hydro Pump and Steam Eruption, which can be crucial later in the game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aerodactyl should be used in the lead position to get up Stealth Rock as fast as possible, deny opposing entry hazard setters with a fast Taunt, punish Rapid Spin if it has a Rocky Helmet, and then either faint as soon as possible or switch out to be sacrificed later in the game. It should watch out for Ground-immune Electric-type Pokemon like Thundurus, Zapdos, and Rotom-W, as they are hostile lead matchups for Aerodactyl and can threaten to KO it with their STAB moves. Aerodactyl should also be wary of Mega Diancie since its Magic Bounce can reflect Stealth Rock back. Aerodactyl must also be wary of Mental Herb from the likes of lead Mew, Shuckle, and Landorus-T, as they can bypass Taunt and set up their own Stealth Rock. Mew can also use its own Taunt against Aerodactyl or cripple it with Thunder Wave, while Landorus-T can lower its Speed with Rock Tomb.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set thrives on hyper offense teams, which appreciate having a fast lead that can get up Stealth Rock quickly. Pokemon with one-turn setup or immediate high damage output, such as Tail Glow Manaphy, Nasty Plot Thundurus, or Choice Band Weavile, are great on hyper offense teams with suicide lead Aerodactyl. Teammates such as Volcarona, Dragonite, and Mega Charizard X greatly appreciate the hazard prevention support that Aerodactyl provides. Cloyster is appreciated as a backup hazard removal option, as it can use Rapid Spin to keep hazards off the field and threaten Ground-type Stealth Rock setters such as Excadrill, Garchomp, and Landorus-T with Icicle Spear.</p>"

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<p>Zapdos is a great defensive check to several threats thanks to a few traits. The first is reliable recovery in the form of Roost, allowing it to stay healthy throughout the match, unlike many other Electric-types. The second is its solid bulk, which, coupled with a good defensive typing, allows Zapdos to check some of the tier's most dangerous threats, such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Scizor, and Tornadus-T. The third is its ability to pressure offensive teams with the combination of its decent power, rather good coverage, and Roost stalling. Finally, Zapdos has access to Defog and the ability to beat Bisharp, something no other Defogger can do besides Mandibuzz. Unfortunately, Zapdos is held back by a Stealth Rock weakness, which is an especially large issue for a Defog user, and does not have the sheer bulk that some other defensive Pokemon possess. Furthermore, the Thundurus formes, both of which boast much more useful offensive abilities and Nasty Plot to help muscle through walls, outclass Zapdos offensively. When using Zapdos, be mindful of its limitations and play to its strengths, and it will be very effective.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zapdos has several other options for sets. SubToxic can be pretty effective on Zapdos, but it has issues with common Steel-types and is difficult to fit with the number of options that Zapdos wants to fit in. Roar is a good move for racking up entry hazard damage and phazing out boosting sweepers. Discharge is another STAB option with a nice chance to paralyze, but it lacks the power of Thunderbolt; for example, it can't OHKO Mega Pinsir. U-turn is an option over Volt Switch if you don't want to be stopped by Ground-type Pokemon before switching out.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Making sure Stealth Rock stays on the field is the easiest way to deal with Zapdos. Good Stealth Rock users include Terrakion, Tyranitar, and Landorus-T, since all of them can force Zapdos out.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Zapdos doesn't have the firepower to get past dedicated special walls such as Chansey and Mega Venusaur. Tyranitar and Hippowdon can handle Zapdos if it lacks Toxic, and the former even threatens it with a Rock-type STAB.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Many Dragon-types, such as Dragonite, Kyurem-B, Mega Charizard X, and Latios can set up on or do major damage to Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: If Zapdos doesn't have Toxic, it becomes setup bait for Mega Charizard X, Mega Altaria, Clefable, and other common setup sweepers.</p> <p><strong>Neutral STAB Attacks</strong>: Even fully invested, Zapdos doesn't have the raw bulk to take strong, neutral STAB attacks from the likes of Latios, Talonflame, and Mega Lopunny.</p> <p><strong>Rock- and Ice-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Kyurem-B, Mamoswine, Terrakion, and Tyranitar can all take Zapdos out with relative ease.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is the primary STAB option for Zapdos, hitting Water- and Flying-types like Keldeo, Slowbro, and Tornadus-T hard and creating momentum. Volt Switch is especially valuable if Zapdos is on a more offensive or balanced team, as it allows Zapdos to pivot into offensive threats while damaging the foe. Discharge can be useful for slowing down faster threats, reducing the effectiveness of dangerous sweepers, and crippling opposing Zapdos checks like Clefable. Additionally, Discharge can guarantee a knockout on Mega Pinsir, especially when combined with Rocky Helmet. Since Mega Pinsir is a major threat to many teams, having a reliable way to remove it is a huge benefit. Heat Wave hits Steel- and Grass-types like Excadrill, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Serperior, which take on Volt Switch rather comfortably. Hidden Power Ice allows Zapdos to check Dragon-types while also allowing Zapdos to hit Ground-types like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor hard. Roost is mandatory to increase longevity. Lastly, Defog provides Zapdos utility by keeping entry hazards off of the field.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP EVs with 228 Defense EVs and a Bold nature allow Zapdos to survive Diamond Storm from Mega Diancie and Icicle Crash from Choice Band Weavile from full HP. 32 Speed EVs ensure that Zapdos always outpaces Adamant Bisharp and Jolly Tyranitar. Alternatively, 108 Speed EVs can be used to ensure Zapdos outspeeds Jolly Bisharp and Adamant Gyarados. Leftovers is the preferred to provide Zapdos longevity especially as a Defogger. It also allows Zapdos to be a better check to Serperior. On the other hand, Rocky Helmet offers immediate utility on more aggressive or faster-paced teams. It is important to note that Static and Defog are not compatible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Zapdos's main tasks are to revenge kill the likes of Bisharp, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Scizor; remove entry hazards with Defog; and generate momentum with Volt Switch. Keeping Zapdos healthy throughout the game by using Roost allows it to consistently check Pokemon that it is supposed to such as Serperior, Ferrothorn, and Talonflame. Zapdos's plays slightly differently depending on its ability of choice. Static allows Zapdos to cripple contact attackers such as Mega Metagross and Mega Lopunny with potential paralysis while Pressure can help PP stall low PP moves such as Leaf Storm from Serperior. Additionally, Pressure allows Zapdos to PP stall Stealth Rock. While other Defog users struggle with PP management against other Stealth Rock setters, Zapdos can continuously clear hazards since with Pressure, Defog has more PP than Stealth Rock, thus making Zapdos a valuable entry hazard remover.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Zapdos fits on a lot of archetypes ranging from bulky offense to stall thanks to its ability to check many notable threats like Serperior, Mega Scizor, and Mega Pinsir coupled with its general lack of passivity. Water-, Fighting-, and Steel-types are good teammates for Zapdos, as they can scare away Weavile and Kyurem, both of which threaten Zapdos with super effective Ice-type STAB. Keldeo, Bisharp, and Mega Scizor are particularly partners since they resist the Ice-type attacks that Zapdos is weak to. Strong wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham, Weavile, Crawdaunt, and Azumarill are great teammates for Zapdos, as they can remove its checks such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Chansey. Furthermore, Volcarona checks, like Garchomp, Chansey, and Mega Lopunny make great partners since Zapdos affords it a free turn to Quiver Dance. Quagsire is another great choice because it can check setup sweepers like Mega Charizard X, Mega Altaria, and Dragonite who otherwise can freely set-up on Zapdos.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is Zapdos's best STAB option, hitting decently hard. Volt Switch, while significantly weaker, is useful to gain switch initiative and momentum, although it isn't effective if Stealth Rock is on the field, as it forces Zapdos to incur damage from the hazard for a second time. Roost keeps Zapdos healthy to take on opposing threats repeatedly. Hidden Power Ice is for Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Defog is generally preferred in the last slot to remove Stealth Rock and other entry hazards, although if you already have a form of hazard removal, Heat Wave is a solid option to hit Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Scizor, Bisharp, and Excadrill.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs maximize Zapdos's special bulk, allowing it to check powerful special threats, such as Keldeo and Gengar, as well as survive a +2 Return from Mega Pinsir after Stealth Rock damage and one round of Leftovers recovery while outpacing Adamant Bisharp. Leftovers is crucial to survive +2 Return from Mega Pinsir after Stealth Rock damage and increases Zapdos's overall longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is a huge issue for Zapdos, so make sure to use Defog before switching out. If Stealth Rock is up, don't use Zapdos to take on Pokemon such as Scizor that will most likely just U-turn out, because it just wears Zapdos down. In general, try to keep Zapdos at decent health so that it can take on the likes of Mega Pinsir.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Having a cleric Pokemon such as Clefable or Chansey is fantastic for removing crippling status from Zapdos. Good physical walls like Hippowdon and Gliscor that handle powerful physical setup sweepers, such as Swords Dance Excadrill and Mega Charizard X, support Zapdos, as Zapdos is setup fodder for them. Finally, a Pokemon to handle Mega Altaria, such as Clefable, bulky Talonflame, Mega Venusaur, or Jirachi, is crucial.</p>"

  "Dragonite": {
    "overview": "<p>Dragonite's great offensive stats, unique ability, and access to Extreme Speed make it one of the most formidable Dragon Dance sweepers in ORAS OU. Dragonite's typing gives it useful resistances, often allowing it to switch into common sweepers such as Serperior and Volcarona, unlike other Dragon Dance users such as Mega Tyranitar and Mega Gyarados. Multiscale works well with Dragonite's bulk, since it prevents it being OHKOed by most Pokemon in the tier, allowing Dragonite an almost guaranteed Dragon Dance. Roost gives Dragonite longevity and allows it to better check Serperior and Volcarona. Dragon Dance allows Dragonite to not only break through bulkier teams but also OHKO Pokemon that would normally outspeed it such as Tornadus-T, Thundurus, Serperior, Latios, and Latias. Extreme Speed in conjunction with Multiscale makes Dragonite hard to revenge kill, since it can be used to KO Pokemon faster than it and can outprioritize Weavile's Ice Shard and Talonflame's Brave Bird. Although Dragonite's STAB moves are largely unresisted, Fairy-types such as Clefable and Mega Altaria prevent Outrage spam and can easily break Dragonite's Multiscale. Phazers such as Skarmory and Hippowdon are also troublesome, as they can force Dragonite out with Whirlwind and heal off any previous damage. Residual damage, in the form of contact chip damage, status, or entry hazards, is also problematic since the lack of Multiscale severely inhibits Dragonite's setup capabilities and allows it to readily be punished when using Dragon Dance. As a Dragon Dance sweeper, Dragonite faces competition from Mega Charizard X and Mega Altaria, which boast better offensive typings, abilities, and coverage options at the cost of expending a Mega slot.</p>",
    "comments": "<p>=========</p> <h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb is also another option that Dragonite can run on the three-attack Dragon Dance set, as it allows Dragonite to do more damage after a Dragon Dance compared to the Lum Berry variant. Life Orb increases Dragonite's wallbreaking capabilities, making it OHKO a larger portion of the metagame with +1 Outrage. This variant is able to net otherwise unattainable KOs at +1, with Iron Head OHKOing offensive Mega Altaria and some variants of Clefable, while Earthquake OHKOing the likes of Mega Metagross and Jirachi. While Life Orb offers Dragonite more offensive power, it makes Dragonite prone to getting worn down quickly and susceptible to status. As a result, this variant may be less consistent compared to the offensive sets. Inner Focus Dragonite can also be used to catch Pokemon like Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny when they use Fake Out.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Fairy-types</strong>: Bulky Fairy- type Pokemon like Clefable and Mega Altaria can easily take a hit from Dragonite even at +1 and can threaten it out with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Slowbro and Quagsire also are able to take a hit from Dragonite at +1, heal off the damage, and threaten with a Scald burn or a KO with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective coverage</strong>: Ice-type coverage on Weavile, Mega Metagross, and Manaphy can do severe damage to Dragonite, even with Multiscale intact.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Whirlwind users such as Skarmory and Hippowdon are able to take any attack from Dragonite at +1 and heal off the damage after phazing it. Furthermore, they limit Dragonite's future setup ability by breaking Multiscale via residual damage from Rocky Helmet, Stealth Rock, or sand.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Fast Mega Evolutions such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Manectric are able to outspeed Dragonite even at +1. Mega Lopunny can threaten a KO with Fake Out + Ice Punch, while Mega Manectric can spam Intimidate and threaten Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice. Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Bisharp resist Extreme Speed and can severely chip Dragonite down with strong priority like Bullet Punch and Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage and Status</strong>: Due to Dragonite's heavy reliance on Multiscale to sweep, contact damage, entry hazards, weather, and status all pose a problem to it. Although Dragonite may still be able to sweep with hazard damage, if it's burned or paralyzed, this feat becomes impossible. Therefore, it is vital to bring Dragonite into battle safely in order for it to sweep.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance + Three Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance allows Dragonite to boost its already high Attack and covers its middling Speed, allowing it to sweep. With one Dragon Dance boost, Dragonite can outspeed the likes of Tornadus-T, Serperior, and Keldeo. Outrage is a very spammable STAB move that can be used to break teams once the opposing team's Dragon resistant pokemon are weakened. At +1 Attack, Outrage is able to OHKO many of the Pokemon mentioned previously and can be used to punch holes through defensive walls that don't resist it. Extreme Speed is used to deal with revenge killers like Weavile and Talonflame, which may try to KO Dragonite with their priority moves. However, at +1, Dragonite has a good chance to OHKO both after a round of Stealth Rock damage. It can also be used to severely chip Pokemon that are faster than it at +1, such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Alakazam. Earthquake is used to deal with Steel-types that resist Outrage and Extreme Speed such as Mega Metagross, Heatran, Excadrill, and Magnezone. It also prevents Dragonite from being walled by Fairy-types and is able to OHKO Mega Diancie at +1. Fire Punch may also be used to hit Pokemon such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor harder. Iron Head is another option that can be run over Extreme Speed, and allows Dragonite to hit bulky Fairy-types such as Clefable and Mega Altaria harder, easily 2HKOing them at +1.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A spread with maximum Attack and Speed investment coupled with an Adamant nature allows Dragonite to hit as hard as possible without being outsped by many Pokemon after a Dragon Dance. Multiscale in conjunction with Lum Berry allows Dragonite to set up Dragon Dance easily without fear of being OHKOed or statused. Lum Berry also heals off Outrage's confusion, which can elongate Dragonite's sweep. Weakness Policy may also be used with Multiscale to drastically boost Dragonite's attack after being hit by a weak super effective move. However, this item makes Dragonite susceptible to being punished by status during a Dragon Dance. A Jolly nature can be used which allows Dragonite to outspeed Mega Lopunny.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is best to preserve Dragonite as a late-game wincon, since its progress may be impeded by bulky Fairy- and Steel-type Pokemon early-game. In order for Dragonite to sweep it needs to use Dragon Dance, and since an intact Multiscale is integral to get a Dragon Dance off safely, entry hazard removal should be greatly prioritized before setting up. After Dragonite's checks and counters have been weakened, it can set up versus bulky passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Glare Serperior, Chansey, Rotom-W, and Heatran. Due to these Pokemon being unable to KO or cripple Lum Berry Dragonite, the use of Dragon Dance versus them goes mostly unpunished, allowing it to sweep afterwards.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can deal with bulky Fairy-types such as Excadrill, Jirachi, and Talonflame pair well with Dragonite, with Excadrill providing vital hazard removal and Jirachi providing Healing Wish support. Talonflame in particular has good synergy with Dragonite, being able to weaken Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Quagsire, and Slowbro with Will-O-Wisp, while Dragonite can weaken Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Heatran for Talonflame. Dragonite benefits from partners like Magnezone that can eliminate bulky Steel-types such as Mega Metagross and Skarmory. Magnezone appreciates Dragonite's ability to switch into Ground-, Fighting-, and Fire-type moves. Screens users such as Serperior and Klefki also pair well with Dragonite, making it extremely easy to spam Dragon Dance with both screens and Multiscale up. These dual screen setters also appreciate Dragonite switching into common Fire-types such as Heatran and Volcarona, threatening them with Earthquake, and consequently allowing Dragonite ample setup opportunity. On dual screen teams, Latias also makes for a good partner, since it can use Healing Wish to provide Dragonite another opportunity to sweep. Powerful wallbreakers such as Manaphy, Volcarona, and Thundurus also pair well with Dragonite, since they can overwhelm most teams by breaking through or weakening defensive walls, easing Dragonite's ability to sweep late-game.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Roost + Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Roost, Dragonite is able to heal off any chip damage it receives while using Dragon Dance or sustain against special attackers that are resisted due to the Dragon typing like Serperior and Volcarona. Versus weak attackers, if Roost is able to heal Dragonite to full health, Multiscale will become active, allowing Dragonite more opportunities to set up Dragon Dance. Dragon Claw is run as a reliable STAB option without risk of confusion unlike Outrage, but it loses out on Base Power. Earthquake allows Dragonite to hit Steel-types such as Heatran, Mega Metagross, Jirachi, and Magnezone. Leftovers along with Roost allows Dragonite to keep Multiscale intact after U-turn and sand chip. damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>240 Speed EVs allow Dragonite to outspeed Weavile at +1. 64 Attack EVs allow +1 Dragon Claw a good chance to OHKO it Weavile and give +1 Earthquake a chance to 2HKO offensive Mega Altaria as well as a roll to 2HKO defensive Mega Altaria after Stealth Rock damage. The listed bulk investment allows Dragonite to survive a Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor from full health as well as Choice Band Weavile's Knock Off after Stealth Rock damage. Lum Berry is preferred over an item such as Leftovers to better threaten the likes of Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Keldeo without the fear of being statused and allow Dragonite ample opportunities to set up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dragonite should be used to sweep once the opposing team's Steel- and Fairy-types have been weakened or removed. Due to its reliance on Multiscale and Lum Berry to sweep, entry hazard removal should be prioritized to bring Dragonite into battle safely. Similarly, it is vital that Dragonite's Lum Berry does not get removed by Knock Off to prevent it from being statused during a Dragon Dance. Dragonite is able to set up versus weak passive Pokemon that are unable to touch it such as Glare Serperior, Ferrothorn, and Chansey. With hazards up, Dragonite also has defensive utility by being able to switch into powerful special wallbreakers such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y, consequently setting up versus them as well.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone is an excellent partner for this set since it is able to trap Steel-types such as Skarmory and handle Fairy-types such as Clefable which may otherwise wall Dragonite. Similarly, Volcarona is able to threaten Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Mega Metagross while also dealing with Ice-types such as Weavile that may be troublesome to Dragonite. In return, Volcarona greatly appreciates Dragonite's ability to switch into Heatran and threaten an OHKO on it with Earthquake. Entry hazard setters that are able to wear down opposing teams also pair well with Dragonite. Excadrill in particular has good synergy since it can lay Stealth Rock, spin away opposing hazards, and deal with Steel- and Fairy-types that may annoy Dragonite. Cofagrigus is also a unique partner that can aid Dragonite by setting up Toxic Spikes and using Hex to chip down opposing teams and allow Dragonite to sweep. In addition, the use of Will-O-Wisp works well with Dragonite, considering it can use burnt Pokemon as setup fodder. Status-absorbing Pokemon such as Clefable also pair well with Dragonite, and Clefable and may be useful to cripple opposing teams with Thunder Wave or severely chip them down with Calm Mind sets.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Choice Band-boosted STAB Outrage is a very strong move that threatens at least a 2HKO against anything that doesn't resist it. Extreme Speed, a +2 priority attack, allows Dragonite to revenge kill weakened sweepers or be a late-game cleaner. It is also useful against other priority users such as Talonflame and Mega Medicham. Fire Punch is used to hit Steel-types, such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor. Earthquake rounds out the set, providing strong neutral coverage that hits Fairy-types such as Clefable and Mega Diancie while also hitting Steel-types harder, especially Heatran. Other options include Ice Punch, which hits Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T. Iron Head is a possible alternative for Fairy-types such as Clefable and Mega Altaria.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature maximize Dragonite's offensive potential. The Choice Band further increases Dragonite's damage output while not relying on Dragon Dance and therefore allowing Dragonite to immediately deliver hard blows. Multiscale is to ensure that Dragonite can safely get off a hit without risking being KOed. Inner Focus can also be used to bypass Fake Out from users like Mega Lopunny or Mega Medicham.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band Dragonite mainly takes three functions in a team. With immediate impact thanks to its powerful attacks, it can wallbreak early-game and weaken Pokemon to the point where sweepers on your team can finish them off. However, mid- or late-game, Dragonite best uses this set to do damage and switch out as a hit-and-run attacker. Lastly, it can act as a revenge killer by using Extreme Speed to finish off weakened foes. This is especially true versus sweepers that cannot break Dragonite easily, such as Serperior and Volcarona. This variant of Dragonite should usually switch out when there is a check sent in, as it will retain its power, unlike Dragon Dance sets. Preserving Multiscale should still be kept in mind, but it does not tend to be as much of a priority as it is for other Dragonite sets.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Dragonite tends to switch out often, and because Stealth Rock breaks Multiscale and takes a quarter of its health away, Rapid Spin or Defog support is needed. Excadrill has great defensive synergy with Dragonite, making it a good choice for a spinner. Latias not only provides Defog support but also can use Healing Wish, which can allow Dragonite to recover health. Mega Diancie can keep entry hazards off the field while benefiting from the holes Dragonite tears into enemy teams, like beating Steel-type Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor, which are in highly threatened by Fire Punch. Magnezone is a great partner as well, as it forms a potent core with Dragonite, punishes Fairy-types, and has great defensive synergy. Bisharp is also a good partner, as it can punish Fairy-types with Iron Head as well and Pursuit trap Latios and Latias. Sweepers like Mega Gyarados and Mega Alakazam can make great use of Dragonite's wallbreaking skills.</p>"

  "Mew": {
    "overview": "<p>Mew is an extremely versatile Pokemon because it can learn every TM and HM in the game. Furthermore, Mew is the only Defogger in the metagame with access to Will-O-Wisp and no Stealth Rock weakness, which lets it cripple Defiant users such as Bisharp by halving their Attack. Overall, Mew has good offensive and defensive stats but is not really that outstanding when compared to bulkier Psychic-types such as Mega Slowbro, regular Slowbro, and Cresselia. Mew has a pretty good Speed stat as well, which lets it outspeed slower Pokemon and attack them. Mew also has access to a form of reliable recovery in Soft-Boiled, which contributes to Mew's longevity on the field. Synchronize is a useful ability for Mew, because it can punish status users if they inflict status on Mew. It can also provide utility against Scald burns. However, Mew's typing is subpar, which leaves it very vulnerable to common Bug-, Ghost-, and Dark-types, such as Scizor, Gengar, and Mega Gyarados. Mew also has four-moveslot syndrome because it cannot benefit from all move options it learns. Despite Mew's incredibly huge movepool, it only has a few viable sets that aren't outclassed by other Pokemon in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive set can be used to take advantage of Mew's huge coverage movepool, but Mew has low offensive stats compared to other Psychic-types such as Latios, which makes it unfit for this role. A lead set along the lines of Taunt, Stealth Rock, Tailwind, and Explosion is an option but is better done by Azelf because of its better Speed and offenses. A Choice set with Trick can be used to prevent setup while delivering some offensive presence, but most targets from Trick are crippled by Taunt and Mew's offensive presence is somewhat lacking compared to other Psychic-types such as Latios. Earth Power can KO Heatran, which Mew lures in, but has no other specific targets and thus isn't worth a main slash. Seismic Toss and Night Shade can be used, as they hit foes for consistent damage and hit Mega Pokemon harder, but Knock Off generally provides more utility. Thunder Wave is a utility move that cripples a lot of offensive Pokemon, as it lowers their Speed greatly, but Mew lacks the moveslot for it. Colbur Berry lets Mew take less damage from Knock Off and Pursuit, among other Dark-type moves, but the extra recovery of Leftovers is usually preferred. Transform is a final option that lets Mew transform into the opposing Pokemon and take an attack better by changing its typing, but this doesn't always work and takes up an important turn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Pursuit trappers, such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Weavile, can trap Mew and OHKO it with Pursuit. The latter outspeeds it, but they all hate to get burned. Additionally, Bisharp can switch into a Defog to boost its Attack by two stages because of Defiant.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Heatran, Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Talonflame are immune to burns and can beat Mew with their STAB attacks. Heatran's Fire-type attacks get a boost if it switches into Will-O-Wisp thanks to Flash Fire.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic wears down Mew turn after turn and burn steadily takes off damage as well. However, the users must be wary of Synchronize because they may cripple themselves by inflicting the status.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Bug-types such as Mega Scizor and Mega Beedrill can OHKO Mew with one of their STAB attacks after Stealth Rock damage. Both are crippled by burns, however.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Bisharp, Weavile, and Tyranitar, can all take Mew's hits. All of them hate Will-O-Wisp, however.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers such as Keldeo, Serperior, Dragalge, and Mega Charizard Y don't really get hampered by burns and can easily KO Mew with their STAB attacks. Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo can set up as long as Mew does not run Psychic while Charizard is immune to burns.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mew's role is to get up Stealth Rock as quickly as possible. Taunt prevents Stealth Rock from being set up by opposing entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill, as well as stopping free setup from Pokemon such as dual screens Serperior and Cloyster. Thunder Wave allows Mew to cripple threats to hyper offense such as Mega Diancie, since it gets paralyzed through the interaction between Magic Bounce and Synchronize, as well as other threats like Serperior, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Metagross. Will-O-Wisp is another option, allowing Mew to weaken physical offensive counter leads, such as Weavile, Landorus-T, and Excadrill. Lastly, Explosion allows Mew to generate momentum by doing massive damage as well as denying Rapid Spin and Defog from slower Pokemon such as Excadrill and Zapdos.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allows Mew to outspeed and prevent most entry hazard setters such as Excadrill and Garchomp from setting them up with Taunt. It also lets Mew Speed tie with opposing base 100s, like Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona, preventing them from setting up with Taunt or crippling them with Thunder Wave. 252 HP EVs maximize Mew's bulk, allowing it to use as many moves as possible to disrupt foes. Mental Herb prevents opposing Taunt from faster Pokemon such as Thundurus and Serperior so they can't stop Mew's Stealth Rock. Colbur Berry can be used to protect Mew from being OHKOed by Weavile, allowing Mew to paralyze or burn it and set up Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mew should used as the lead Pokemon on hyper offense teams, since its role is to set up Stealth Rock, as well as preventing opposing Stealth Rock from slower setters such as tank Garchomp and Landorus-T. Thunder Wave should be used first when facing Mega Diancie, Serperior, and Weavile, since it prevents them from threatening the rest of Mew's teammates with their high Speed. Explosion should only be used once either Stealth Rock is set up or when facing Mega Diancie, which bounces back Stealth Rock. It can also be used to prevent potential entry hazard removers like Defog Zapdos and Rapid Spin Excadrill from clearing Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates like Volcarona, Dragonite, and Mega Gyarados appreciate Mew's ability to prevent opposing Stealth Rock from being set up, meaning they can come in at full health. These Pokemon also appreciate Mew's ability to paralyze faster threats like Mega Diancie and Serperior, which can prevent them from setting up and sweeping either through OHKOs from Moonblast and Diamond Storm or paralysis from Glare. Slower attackers such as Bisharp also appreciate Mew's ability to paralyze Mega Diancie, since this flips what would otherwise be a positive matchup for it. Teammates like Mega Pinsir can benefit from Will-O-Wisp Mew, since it can catch strong threatening physical attackers like Weavile off guard and allow an easier setup opportunity later.</p>"

      "Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Taunt forces the foe to use damaging attacks and prevents them from boosting, setting up entry hazards, and recovering. Soft-Boiled provides reliable recovery for Mew, healing 50% of its health. Will-O-Wisp is another utility move which burns physical attackers and cripples them by halving their Attack. Knock Off prevents Mew from Struggling if it has been Taunted and additionally removes the foe's item. Psychic can be used in the fourth slot for a more powerful attack than Knock Off, as it is boosted by STAB and hits Pokemon such as Keldeo and Mega Lopunny for super effective damage, as well as Pokemon such as Clefable and Mega Venusaur, which is important, as they're two Pokemon Mew is supposed to beat. But, Ice Beam can also be used in the fourth slot to beat specially defensive Gliscor along with Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Synchronize statuses the opposing Pokemon if it statuses Mew, except if the foe is immune to that status. Leftovers provides passive recovery for Mew, boosting its longevity. The Speed investment lets Mew outspeed Jolly Tyranitar and Adamant Bisharp and burn them before they can KO it. The HP EVs boost Mew's overall bulk while the Special Defense EVs raise Mew's Special Defense stat, which is boosted even further by a Careful or Calm nature. Use a Careful nature if running Knock Off, but use a Calm nature if running Psychic to reduce damage taken from Foul Play. A secondary spread of 252 HP / 224 Def / 32 Spe can be used, as it lets Mew take on physical attackers better and avoid the 2HKO from Mega Lopunny's Return after Stealth Rock damage. A third spread of 252 HP / 148 SpD / 108 Spe is another option to outspeed Jolly Bisharp and Adamant Dragonite, but, with this spread, Mew has far less bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mew is best used on teams that struggle against stall, as it can come in on defensive Pokemon and use Taunt. Mew can spread burns against offensive physically oriented teams early-game and provide setup opportunities for teammates. Mew can be used as a tank, as it has good overall bulk. Try to avoid letting Mew get statused, unless your team has cleric support. The activation of Synchronize isn't worth acquiring a status affliction. Make sure to keep Mew as healthy as possible, as a defensive Pokemon may hit it on the switch and knock Mew out if it is at low HP. If you're unsure what to do, go for Knock Off, as most Pokemon will not appreciate having their item removed. When facing a foe with Pursuit, the best thing to do is go for Will-O-Wisp, as all common Pursuit users are physical attackers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Special attackers such as Mega Diancie and Mega Charizard Y appreciate Mew beating specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Ferrothorn one-on-one, and thus, they make for good partners. Setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Scizor, and Azumarill take advantage of Mew weakening physical attackers with burns, as they can use this to set up. Cleric support from Pokemon such as Chansey and Clefable is appreciated to cure Mew from status. However, the former should only be used on defensive teams. Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Mega Lopunny are great partners for their ability to beat all Pursuit users themselves, and they have good synergy with Mew, as they resist Bug and Dark while Mew can switch into Psychic-type attacks for them. Other status absorbers such as Conkeldurr and Heatran are also good choices. The former can also beat common Pursuit users for Mew and has relatively good synergy with it.</p>"

  "Azumarill": {
    "overview": "<p>Azumarill is a potent threat in the OU metagame thanks to its fantastic traits such as typing, bulk, power, and movepool. Its Water / Fairy typing gives it key resistances and immunities to Fire-, Fighting-, Water-, Dark-, and Dragon-type moves, which, when combined with its solid bulk, allows it to sponge many hits and gain free turns. Additionally, its ability, Huge Power, turns its terrible Attack stat into the equivalent of a base 150 Attack stat, ensuring that it's no pushover offensively. It also has a great movepool to complement that. Access to priority in Aqua Jet, powerful STAB moves in Play Rough and Waterfall, and coverage in Knock Off and Superpower ensures that it will always have the right move for the job. These traits allow it to effectively run a Choice Band set, a Belly Drum Set, and an Assault Vest set, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. However, Azumarill has a very low Speed stat, which often forces it to take a hit before attacking, and it is walled by Steel-types unless it's running Superpower, which lowers its Attack and Defense after every use. Additionally, common Electric- and Grass-types, such as Raikou, Thundurus, and Mega Venusaur, are able to check Azumarill, meaning it struggles to do much before these Pokemon are sufficiently weakened.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Azumarill can fit on stall teams if it runs a defensive set with Sap Sipper. However, it lacks reliable recovery and has very little offensive presence without Huge Power, but can act as a solid answer to Serperior, Ferrothorn, and non-Rain Dance Manaphy. Additionally, Facade can be run on the Choice Band set so Azumarill can still function while burned. Natural Gift with a Watmel Berry gives a 100-Base Power Fire-type attack which targets the likes of Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. A Custap Berry can be used to let Azumarill move first when it is below 25% HP. This can be useful in situations versus offensive Pokemon if they are not in range of being KOed by Aqua Jet. Running Double-Edge alongside a Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment on the Belly Drum set allows Azumarill to outspeed and OHKO Mega Venusaur, a common stop to Belly Drum sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Tentacruel resist both of Azumarill's STAB moves and take very little from its coverage moves. Additionally, they are able to hit Azumarill super effectively with their STAB attacks. However, both Amoonguss and Tentacruel can potentially lose to the Belly Drum set if weakened enough, although Mega Venusaur doesn't have this problem, outside of rare Jolly variants with Double-Edge.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn, Magnezone, Skarmory, bulky Mega Scizor, and Mega Metagross are all able to check or counter Azumarill reliably, as they all resist Play Rough. Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor all take little from Waterfall and can use Azumarill as setup bait and set up Spikes, or Swords Dance in the latter's case. Mega Metagross and Magnezone threaten to OHKO with their STAB attacks after minimal prior damage, and they also have the bulk to take an Aqua Jet. Note that Magnezone and Ferrothorn must be wary of Superpower, with the latter only needing some prior damage to be OHKOed by Choice Band Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Volcanion</strong>: Volcanion is capable of switching into any Azumarill variant at least once, can easily revenge kill Belly Drum sets, and deters Azumarill from using Aqua Jet to clean late-game. It then proceeds to OHKO Azumarill with Sludge Wave or threatens to burn it with Steam Eruption, Scald, or Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Mega Scizor, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Quagsire, Slowbro, Mega Slowbro, Mega Venusaur, Mew, Clefable, and Rotom-W all check or counter Azumarill reliably thanks to their great physical bulk. Mega Scizor is able to set up Swords Dances on non-Choice Band variants and Roost off any damage it may take. Ferrothorn and Skarmory can set up entry hazards, and in the latter's case, Leech Seed. Slowbro, Mega Slowbro, and Quagsire can Recover stall non-Choice Band variants and burn them with Scald. Rotom-W can burn Azumarill with Will-O-Wisp, or Volt Switch out to maintain momentum. Mew and Cresselia are able to stomach a Knock Off and can cripple Azumarill with Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, respectively. Finally, physically defensive Clefable is able to counter Azumarill depending on its set. Unaware Clefable counters both the Assault Vest and Belly Drum sets, while Magic Guard Clefable can only take on the Assault Vest set.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Play Rough and Waterfall are Azumarill's main STAB moves, and hit incredibly hard thanks to Choice Band. Aqua Jet allows Azumarill to revenge kill weakened threats and sweep late-game should the opportunity arise. The final slot is dependent on what the team needs. Superpower is useful for luring in Ferrothorn for a 2HKO while also hitting other Steel-types such as Magnezone and Skarmory after it uses Roost. However, Knock Off can be used instead for coverage against bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro and Mew while also having utility in removing items.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread allows Azumarill to outpace uninvested base 60 Speed Pokemon, such as Clefable and Sylveon. If outspeeding support Tyranitar is appealing, then 92 Speed EVs should be used. 164 Speed EVs can be used to outpace uninvested base 70 Speed Pokemon, which includes bulky Bisharp and Skarmory. The Attack EVs should be maximized in every instance to ensure that Azumarill will hit as hard as possible. Choice Band is the item of choice to further boost its power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band Azumarill is best used as a wallbreaker early- and mid-game. Because Choice Band is such a prediction reliant item, predict what the opponent will send out and use the appropriate coverage move. If the opponent has a bulky Grass-type such as Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur both of which are capable of beating Choice Band Azumarill, this opportunity can be used to double switch and gain momentum, while wearing down Mega Venusaur if entry hazards have been set up. Azumarill is best used as an offensive check to the likes of Latios, Keldeo, Ground-types such as Landorus-T, and Mega Diancie as it can switch into most of them easily, but can risk burns from Scald in the case of Keldeo or Psyshock from Latios, and Moonblast from Mega Diancie if Azumarill doesn't switch in on Hidden Power Fire or Protect. Azumarill can also clean late-game with its strong Aqua Jet, picking off many weakened threats such as Garchomp, Jirachi, Mega Charizard X, Mega Medicham, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Mega Diancie.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can take on Electric-types, such as Mega Latias, and Clefable can support Azumarill, Mega Latias and Clefable both commonly run Thunder Wave which can cripple their checks for each other.  Pokemon that can take on the bulky Grass-types that wall Azumarill, such as Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, and Mega Pinsir, also make Azumarill's job of nuking everything much easier. Lastly, Pokemon that capitalize on Azumarill's wallbreaking prowess make excellent teammates. Swords Dance Garchomp appreciates the removal of bulky Ground-types, and Swords Dance Talonflame appreciates the removal of Rock-types and Heatran. Additionally, Nasty Plot Thundurus appreciates the removal of bulky Ground-types and Latias, and it also helps Azumarill by taking on bulky Water-types and Skarmory. Mega Lopunny and Diggersby are also decent options as they can pressure and overload checks they have in common such as Grass-types, and the likes of Skarmory and Mega Scizor.</p>"
      },
      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Belly Drum maximizes Azumarill's Attack at the cost of half its HP, which turns it into an immediate offensive threat. Aqua Jet is Azumarill's Water-type STAB move, as it hits insanely hard after a boost and has priority, which is often enough to sweep teams by itself. Should that not be sufficient, Play Rough is Azumarill's Fairy-type STAB move that hits slower Pokemon much harder, netting KOs Aqua Jet fails to achieve. The last slot is reserved for Knock Off, which hits everything that Play Rough and Aqua Jet can't. For example, Ferrothorn and Amoonguss, two otherwise solid Azumarill checks, are OHKOed after Stealth Rock by a +6 Knock Off.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread allows Azumarill to outspeed uninvested base 70 Speed Pokemon and below, which includes Skarmory, Tyranitar, and Clefable. Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature are used to give Azumarill as much power as possible. The remaining EVs go into HP to give Azumarill a little bulk, and the HP number is even to ensure that its Sitrus Berry is activated after the Belly Drum. Sitrus Berry is the item of choice to give Azumarill HP back after using Belly Drum, which allows it to survive longer.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used late-game after threats have been weakened, as otherwise setting up will be a lost cause. Getting Azumarill in safely is critical, so bringing it in after one of its teammates has been KOed is advisable. Targets to set up on include Fighting-types as well as defensive Pokemon such as Clefable, Hippowdon, and Gliscor, as they fail to deal significant damage to Azumarill. Alternatively, Azumarill does not need to set up every game. There are some situations where using Azumarill for its defensive capabilities is more beneficial, such as when the opponent has a threatening Dragon-, Fighting-, or Fairy-type. In this case, Azumarill makes for a good check because its Sitrus Berry gives it a slight form of recovery that better enables it to do its job.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Azumarill appreciates having its checks and counters removed so it can sweep. Strong Electric-types, such as Raikou, Mega Manectric, Magnezone, and Thundurus help by taking on Skarmory, Talonflame, and bulky Water-types. Additionally, Magnezone is able to trap and KO Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Skarmory. Azumarill appreciates entry hazard support, so Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Swords Dance Garchomp, Air Balloon Heatran, and Kyurem-B make for great partners, as they fit right in on the offensive teams Belly Drum Azumarill finds its home on. Additionally, Azumarill hates entry hazards on its side of the field, so Pokemon capable of removing them, such as Latios, Starmie, and Excadrill, make for good partners. Lastly, Mega Venusaur is a complete roadblock to Azumarill, so teammates that can KO it, such as Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Mega Metagross, and Mega Medicham, are needed.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Play Rough and Waterfall are Azumarill's main STAB moves, as they sport good power and coverage. Aqua Jet gives Azumarill a good priority move to work with to help mitigate its low Speed. The fourth slot is a choice between two coverage moves. Knock Off is the preferred move, as it deals good damage and has the added benefit of removing items. Alternatively, Superpower can be used to get a large hit on Ferrothorn, although depending on Ferrothorn's spread, it may only be a 3HKO after the Attack drops.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment allow Azumarill to hit as hard as possible. 240 HP EVs give Azumarill great bulk while also ensuring that Seismic Toss fails to 4HKO. 16 EVs in Special Defense allow Azumarill to reach a Special Defense stat of 300 after the Assault Vest boost, which bolsters its role as an offensive tank. An alternative EV spread of 16 HP / 252 Atk / 240 SpD with an Adamant nature can be used to give Azumarill a lot more Special Defense, but Azumarill then loses out on overall bulk and fails to take physical hits as well.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This variant of Azumarill is used as an offensive tank capable of pivoting into many special attacks while also taking on physical attackers relatively well. This role allows it to work best on bulky offense and balance teams, and it pairs well with Steel- and Dragon-types thanks to their great type synergy. It is also capable of beating most special attackers 1v1, including those that hit it super effectively, such as Thundurus and Gengar. Additionally, Azumarill is a great revenge killer with Aqua Jet and is capable of taking out many weakened Pokemon. Azumarill is also a great spammer of Knock Off, as many of its switch-ins do not appreciate losing their items.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Latios, and Latias take on the Electric- and Grass-types that threaten Azumarill. Ferrothorn and Heatran appreciate Azumarill's ability to take on Fighting- and Ground-types that threaten them, and in return they are able to take on Pokemon such as Thundurus, as well as set up entry hazards. Pokemon that threaten the bulky Steel-types that wall Azumarill make for great partners. Heatran, Talonflame, Magnezone, and Mega Charizard X fit this role well.</p>"

  "Politoed": {
    "overview": "<p>Politoed seems like a fairly unimpressive Pokemon at first glance, but it has access to a great ability in Drizzle that makes it a crucial Pokemon for OU rain teams. It's not that bad of a Pokemon either, as its defenses are high enough for it to tank some fairly strong hits and set up rain multiple times in a match. Furthermore, it has decent offensive stats, a Speed stat that places it just above Clefable and Azumarill with a little bit of investment, and an outstanding support movepool with several options it can profit from, such as Toxic, Encore, and Perish Song. With the weather nerf in XY, rain's popularity as a playstyle has decreased, but that doesn't mean it cannot still be effective. Politoed's major flaw is its lack of reliable recovery, which limits its supportive capabilities, but Rest is usually enough for this concern to be minor. It also has Grass and Electric weaknesses that are compounded by the Water-type Pokemon that enjoy the rain support it provides, forcing the rest of the team to compensate for this, and it is really only viable on rain teams, but these factors don't stop Politoed from being the single most effective form of support for rain teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive set along the lines of Hydro Pump / Ice Beam / Focus Blast / Psychic can be run with an EV spread of 56 HP / 252 SpA / 200 Spe and a Modest nature, but it is usually not worth it because it takes away from Politoed's longevity and thus its main role, which is functioning as a rain supporter. Perish Song + Whirlpool is an option to trap and remove certain Pokemon, but it only has situational benefits. Sleep Talk can be run so that Politoed has the ability to move while asleep, but Politoed has a lot of moves fighting for slots as it is, so it is usually forgone. Haze is another option that stop foes from setting up, but Encore generally stops them too and has more utility because it stops defensive Pokemon better. An offensive Choice Scarf set is an option which suits Politoed as a revenge killer but reduces the number of rain turns, which are really important for Politoed to do its job well.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Latios and Latias</strong>: Latios and Latias can take any hit Politoed throws at them and deal a lot of damage to it with Psyshock. However, they must be wary of Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey takes little damage from Scald and has both Heal Bell and Natural Cure to heal off status while being able to threaten Politoed in return with Seismic Toss, making it one of Politoed's most effective answers.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Celebi threaten Politoed with their STAB attacks and can beat it relatively easily. However, none of them besides Celebi appreciate a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Powerful Electric-types, such as Magnezone and Thundurus, can beat Politoed quite easily with one of their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Other Weather</strong>: Other weather setters such as Tyranitar and Mega Charizard Y can replace the rain with their abilities, preventing Politoed from supporting its teammates with rain.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types, especially SubCM Keldeo and Choice Band Azumarill, can be very threatening to Politoed because they resist Scald and can hit it hard.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is a solid STAB move that is boosted by the rain, which Politoed sets up, and has a useful chance to burn the foe, thus dissuading physical attackers. Toxic wears down bulkier Pokemon and cripples foes such as Latios and Latias that don't really mind a Scald even if it burns. Hypnosis can also be used to put opposing threats to sleep, but it isn't as consistent as Toxic due to its low accuracy and how luck-based the effectiveness of sleep can be in general. Encore prevents Politoed from being taken advantage of by setup sweepers, especially Dragon Dance users and Calm Mind Clefable, and allows it to take advantage of defensive Pokemon that have just used a support move by locking them into the move. The combination of Encore + Toxic is particularly potent against Mega Slowbro, making Politoed an effective check to Calm Mind variants. Rest fills the last moveslot as an important form of recovery for Politoed and allows it to switch in more often to get up rain. A moveslot can also be filled in with Ice Beam, which threatens the Dragon-type Pokemon that like to take advantage of Politoed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>96 Speed EVs are enough for Politoed to outspeed max Speed Azumarill and lock it into Belly Drum with Encore if it has just used the move. The HP and Special Defense EVs in addition to a Calm nature are conducive to increasing Politoed's longevity and allow it to deal with threats such as Mega Charizard Y. Defense investment and a Bold nature can be run instead to better handle Pokemon such as Talonflame and Tyranitar, but these are fairly easy to cover with teammates and generally not much of a concern for rain teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If rain has stopped but is needed for a certain Pokemon to sweep or do its job better, switch Politoed in, as it will summon rain again for eight turns. Politoed is also a good switch-in to other weather setters, as their weather will be removed and replaced by rain; this is especially useful against Mega Charizard Y, which can't reliably use Solar Beam outside of the sun. Try to avoid letting Politoed take a Knock Off, as not having Damp Rock will shorten the length of Politoed's rain by three turns and thus hinder the rest of the rain team. Scald is typically the best option to spam, as it is relatively powerful and nothing really appreciates a burn. Toxic should generally be used to catch Latios, Latias, and certain defensive Pokemon on the switch. Encore foes on their use of a setup move; this will force them to switch. Afterwards, Politoed can decide to switch out if it can't handle the incoming Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swift Swim users and other Pokemon that profit from rain, such as Mega Swampert, Kingdra, and Tornadus-T, make great partners, as they benefit from Politoed's rain. Ferrothorn is a solid check to Azumarill, which is a significant issue for rain teams, and benefits from the decreased power of Fire-type moves; other Pokemon weak to Fire-type attacks, such as Mega Scizor, Breloom, and Mega Metagross, appreciate Politoed's support for this reason. Other good partners include those that can beat Electric-types that trouble Politoed, such as Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Mega Swampert. Teammates such as Mega Pinsir and Tornadus-T can threaten Grass-types that trouble Politoed and rain teams in general, so they make great partners as well. Last but not least, other Pokemon that can set up rain, such as Thundurus and Zapdos, are good choices for rain teams, as they can serve as back-up rain setters if Politoed is pressured or has been taken out.</p>"

  "Quagsire": {
    "overview": "<p>With its great defensive typing and fantastic ability in Unaware combined with decent physical bulk and access to reliable recovery, Quagsire has fashioned itself a clear niche in OU as a physical wall capable of taking on fearsome setup sweepers such as Belly Drum Azumarill, Mega Scizor, Mega Altaria, and Mega Charizard X. With Scald and Recover, it can stall out a good number of physical attackers in the tier, and a range of other move options means that it has very good defensive utility. Its Water / Ground typing gives it four resistances and an immunity to Electric, which, combined with its neutrality to Ice, makes it an excellent stop to momentum-grabbing Electric-types such as Raikou and Mega Manectric. It has only one weakness, but it is a 4x weakness to Grass, which means that it can be caught out by coverage moves such as Mega Metagross's Grass Knot. Additionally, while Quagsire can be very effective in a physically defensive role, its special bulk is somewhat lacking, and it can be 2HKOed by even relatively weak special moves. It also has underwhelming stats all-around, which prevent it from walling some of the most powerful physical attackers in the tier, and it is severely hindered by status ailments, as the chip damage from burn and poison can cripple it as an effective wall. Lastly, it faces competition from the other main Unaware user in OU, Clefable, as, while Quagsire checks physical threats more effectively, Clefable has better special bulk and can bring far more general utility to a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Both Haze and Yawn can be used to shut down Stored Power users, such as Clefable and Mega Latias, and Mold Breaker users, such as Mega Gyarados, which could otherwise boost up in the face of Quagsire's Unaware. Haze is the more reliable option, being able to function if the target is already inflicted with a status condition, another member of the opposing team is asleep, or the target is behind a Substitute; Yawn is less reliable for removing boosts, but it provides more general utility in putting foes to sleep, punishing switch-ins, and shuffling foes around to take entry hazard damage. Ice Beam can be used to hit switch-ins such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp super effectively. Curse gives Quagsire more offensive presence and can give stall teams a clear way of closing games out.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-type Attacks</strong>: With its 4x weakness to Grass, Quagsire falls to any moderately powerful Grass-type attack. Even when burnt, Breloom has a good chance to OHKO Quagsire with Bullet Seed, and almost every special Grass-type attack can easily OHKO it. Quagsire can also be OHKOed by Grass-type coverage moves such as Manaphy's Energy Ball and Mega Metagross's Grass Knot, even without STAB or full investment.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Several strong special attackers, such as Life Orb Latios and Choice Specs Keldeo, can OHKO Quagsire even with neutral hits, and very few of them fail to outspeed and 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: A select group of physical attackers can 2HKO Quagsire even without boosts, such as offensive Landorus-T, Life Orb Excadrill, and Choice Band Azumarill.</p> <p><strong>Status Ailments</strong>: Poison and burn prevent Quagsire from remaining at full health, limiting its effectiveness as a check and preventing it from stalling Pokemon out with Recover so effectively. Toxic in particular will eventually force Quagsire out, regardless of how little damage the foe can inflict.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt prevents Quagsire from recovering off chip damage before it is forced out, which can prevent it from switching in against threats that fail to 2HKO it from full health.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker</strong>: Pokemon with Mold Breaker such as Mega Gyarados can set up in the face of Quagsire and KO it with boosted stats, unhindered by Unaware's effect.</p> <p><strong>Stored Power</strong>: Stored Power users such as Mega Latias and Clefable can bypass Unaware by boosting the Base Power of the move itself, and after enough boosts they easily KO Quagsire.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald and Recover are essential moves for Quagsire to do its job, as they allow it to burn and then stall out physical attackers such as Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Scizor. Earthquake gives good neutral coverage in conjunction with Scald and allows Quagsire to beat Pokemon that are immune to burns such as Heatran and Mega Charizard X. Toxic is generally the best option for the fourth moveslot to punish switch-ins such as Manaphy and Latios before Quagsire is forced out, without having to rely on Scald's 30% chance to burn. Encore can also be used instead to stop Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados and Suicune from setting up on Quagsire, the former of which ignores Quagsire's Unaware, and the latter of which can stall Quagsire out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Defense-boosting nature lets Quagsire best check the physical threats it is meant to. A Relaxed nature is used over Impish or Bold to maximize its damage output, which is far more useful to it than its paltry Speed. Leftovers gives Quagsire valuable passive recovery. Unaware allows Quagsire to check certain setup sweepers that would otherwise destroy defensive teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is important to keep Quagsire at close-to-full health as long as there is something on the opponent's team that it is needed to check. Do not let it take any unnecessary damage, as several of the threats it is often required to check only fail to 2HKO it by a matter of a few percent. Status conditions, especially burn and poison, can cripple Quagsire and remove it as a check to certain Pokemon, so be wary around foes that can inflict them, such as Talonflame and Mega Charizard X with Will-O-Wisp. Do not overestimate Quagsire's physical bulk, either: certain physical attackers, such as Life Orb Excadrill, Choice Band Azumarill, and Mega Pinsir, can 2HKO it even with no boosts, so do not assume that it is an automatic check to any physical attacker as long as it is healthy. Quagsire should very rarely come in on a special attack, as its special bulk is very poor, though its typing allows it to counter several Electric-types in the tier. Among those it can counter are Magnezone, Raikou, and Mega Manectric, all of which it threatens back with Earthquake.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can take on Grass-types pair well with Quagsire, as Grass-types easily force Quagsire out with their STAB moves regardless of boosts. They are especially threatening if they are not seriously hindered by a potential burn from Scald on the switch. Assault Vest Tornadus-T is one potential partner, being able to come in against the likes of Serperior, Mega Venusaur, and Celebi and generally force them out. Even outside of super effective hits, Quagsire cannot take any strong special attacks well, so bulky special walls make good partners for it. Ferrothorn is a decent option in this role, as not only does it resist Grass and take hits from strong special attackers such as Latios, but it also takes on Manaphy lacking Hidden Power Fire, which is a considerable threat to defensive teams, on which Quagsire is usually used. Quagsire is crippled by status ailments, so it greatly appreciates cleric support from Pokemon with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy such as Chansey, Clefable, and Sylveon. Quagsire is also very easily worn down by entry hazards, so ways to remove them and, preferably, keep them off the field in the first place are appreciated. Latias is a good Defogger to pair with Quagsire, as, in addition to removing entry hazards for it, it can take on several Pokemon that cause Quagsire problems, such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Venusaur, and Manaphy, and it appreciates Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Bisharp, and Weavile being reliably checked and worn down.</p>"

  "Slowking": {
    "overview": "<p>Slowking's higher Special Defense compared to Slowbro's allows it to much more safely check dangerous Pokemon such as Choice Specs Keldeo and Latios. A good defensive typing provides it with many useful resistances, and its ability Regenerator allows it to pivot consistently throughout a match. Slowking also has good coverage in Flamethrower and great utility options in Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Protect. However, Slowking's Defense stat is much lower than Slowbro's, forcing it to use Protect to have a chance in Pursuit mind games and making it a much more shaky check to physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Metagross, and Gliscor. Its Water / Psychic typing also leaves it weak to common utility and coverage moves attacks like U-turn, Volt Switch, Knock Off, Pursuit, and Thunder Punch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Calm Mind and Nasty Plot are two options that allow Slowking to function as a standalone defensive sweeper, but Mega Slowbro is a better Calm Mind sweeper because it has better physical bulk and is less vulnerable to status. Fire Blast can be used over Flamethrower to deal more damage but suffers from inaccuracy and low PP. Colbur Berry can be used without Protect to help Slowking versus Pursuit and free up a coverage or status option. Dragon Tail is useful for phazing a boosted Suicune, Volcarona, Gliscor, or Reuniclus. Power Gem is a coverage option that does more damage to Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Talonflame, but it is generally an inferior option to the listed moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status-immune Pokemon</strong>: Clefable and Reuniclus both have Magic Guard and are able to use Slowking as setup fodder, only fearing Thunder Wave. Mega Slowbro with Rest is also able to use Calm Mind in front of Slowking and heal off any damage and status conditions. Gliscor is able to comfortably use Slowking as setup fodder once its Toxic Orb has activated, and it avoids the 2HKO from Scald. Mega Altaria can use Refresh or Heal Bell to remove status conditions. Chansey and Starmie both have Natural Cure and can remove status simply by switching out.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Mega Metagross and Mega Medicham with Thunder Punch are able to easily break through Slowking. Mega Scizor fears Scald burns and the occasional Fire-type coverage but is able to cripple Slowking with a strong U-turn or Knock Off. Strong neutral physical attacks only need a small amount of prior chip to be able to 2HKO Slowking, such as Mega Diancie's Diamond Storm, Mega Lopunny's Return, and offensive Landorus-T’s and Excadrill's Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Weavile and Bisharp can OHKO Slowking with Knock Off, and Bisharp can even set up with Swords Dance. Tyranitar can easily 2HKO Slowking with Crunch and only fears a Scald burn or Thunder Wave. Hydreigon can use Dark Pulse to heavily damage Slowking but has to risk a Scald burn or Thunder Wave in retaliation.</p> <p><strong>Status Effects</strong>: Burn and Toxic poison severely limit Slowking's ability to switch into its usual checks and are dealt out by common Pokemon such as Heatran, Rotom-W, Slowbro, Garchomp, Excadrill, Keldeo, and more. Paralysis from Rotom-W, Clefable, and Ferrothorn will not wear Slowking down but can prevent it from safely scouting the foe's move or getting off an attack.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Amoonguss, Venusaur, and Tangrowth take little damage from any of Slowking's attacks and threaten it out with sleep in the case of Amoonguss, Knock Off in the case of Venusaur, or both in the case of Tangrowth. Serperior is a more offensive counter that does not switch in continually but can set up with Leaf Storm against Slowking. However, none of these Pokemon appreciate being burned or paralyzed, and switching into Flamethrower repeatedly can be troublesome for them.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is highly spammable and offers a 30% chance to burn, threatening potential switch-ins like Tornadus-T, Ferrothorn, and Amoonguss. Protect is used to gain an extra turn of Leftovers recovery and scout opposing Choice-locked Pokemon. Slack Off in tandem with Regenerator helps Slowking stay healthy throughout the match. The last moveslot can be occupied by a number of viable options. Thunder Wave prevents Slowking from being unable to threaten Clefable and other switch-ins. Toxic is an alternative status choice that can cripple Pokemon that don’t mind Thunder Wave, such as Mega Slowbro and Rotom-W. Flamethrower prevents common Steel-types from getting free turns versus Slowking, such as Mega Scizor and Bisharp trying to set up with Swords Dance, Ferrothorn trying to lay entry hazards, and Mega Metagross and Magnezone looking to threaten Slowking with their Electric-type moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Special Defense investment along with a Calm nature lets Slowking hit a number of defensive benchmarks, such as avoiding the 2HKO from Choice Specs Keldeo's Hidden Power Grass after Stealth Rock damage, the KO from Mega Charizard Y’s Flamethrower into Solar Beam, and the OHKO from Modest Choice Specs Hydreigon's Dark Pulse. The Defense investment allows Slowking to avoid the 2HKO from Adamant Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick after using Protect. Other notable benchmarks include Mega Metagross's Meteor Mash into Thunder Punch, Mega Diancie's Diamond Storm after Stealth Rock damage, and Mega Lopunny's Return, all of which either do not 2HKO or have a very small chance to do so.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Slowking should be used as a defensive pivot into Pokemon that cannot KO it like Mega Metagross, Keldeo, and Tornadus-T. From there, feel free to apply pressure with the threat of a Scald burn or Thunder Wave. Pivoting to heal with Regenerator after using Slack Off is unnecessary, as it makes you lose momentum. Protect helps scout whether the opponent is going to attempt to Pursuit trap Slowking or not and is useful in general to restore more HP with Leftovers. Use Slack Off when necessary, as Slowking needs to stay healthy to be able to check the Pokemon it's supposed to.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clefable is a great partner, serving as a late-game sweeper with Calm Mind; switch-in to Weavile, Latios, and Mega Altaria; and status absorber. Slowking can switch into Steel- and Fire-types like Mega Metagross, Excadrill, Heatran, and Mega Charizard Y in return. Tornadus-T forms a Regenerator core with Slowking, functions as a fast pivot with U-turn, and helps cover Slowking's Grass-type weakness. Dragon Dance Mega Altaria is a late-game sweeper and appreciates Slowking switching into Ice-types. It can also remove status from Slowking with Heal Bell and pivot into Electric-types that threaten Slowking, such as Magnezone and Rotom-W. Heatran and Excadrill make for great partners, as both are able to counter Clefable and set Stealth Rock. Excadrill can also remove hazards with Rapid Spin and switch into Electric-types. On the other hand, Heatran counters Grass-types like Serperior and Mega Venusaur. Slowking can cover Excadrill's weaknesses by switching into Water- and Fighting-types like Keldeo and Mega Lopunny. Tangrowth and Amoonguss are two defensive Grass-types that also form a Regenerator core with Slowking. Tangrowth checks physical attackers such as Mega Metagross and Gliscor, which Slowking may be unable to check alone. Amoonguss can act as a switch-in to Clefable and backup counter to Keldeo, while Slowking can switch into Heatran, Latios, and Tornadus-T.</p>"

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Scizor's typing, great defensive stats, and access to Roost allow it to fit on any type of team and reliably check many threats in the metagame such as Mega Metagross, Choice Specs Latios, Clefable, Mega Diancie, and Weavile. The combination of its high Attack stat and Swords Dance allows it to break through many defensive cores, and STAB Technician-boosted Bullet Punch, lets it function as a revenge killer and good setup sweeper alongside Swords Dance. Mega Scizor can also provide momentum with U-turn, Pursuit trap Pokemon like Latios, and provide Defog support for its team, making it a great utility Pokemon as well. Although Mega Scizor's defensive typing allows it to check many threats, it is still vulnerable to dangerous Fire-types and Pokemon that carry Fire-type coverage such as Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, Hidden Power Fire Magnezone, Flamethrower Clefable, and Heat Wave Tornadus-T. Mega Scizor also does not have the best Speed stat, making it vulnerable to faster offensive threats like Keldeo and Thundurus.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Jolly nature could be run on the offensive Swords Dance set, allowing Mega Scizor to outspeed the likes of Jolly Bisharp, defensive Garchomp, and some fast variants of Rotom-W. However, the loss of power is usually not worth it, and Mega Scizor would still get outsped by fast Heatran.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Moves</strong>: Fire-types like Volcarona, Heatran, and Mega Charizard Y can all easily take Mega Scizor's STAB moves and threaten the OHKO on it with their own STAB moves. Fire-type coverage like Fire Blast from Garchomp, Flamethrower from Clefable, Fire Blast from Slowbro, and Heat Wave from Tornadus-T can also threaten Mega Scizor.</p> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: Magnezone is able to trap and eliminate Mega Scizor with Hidden Power Fire. Try to catch Magnezone on the switch with a Superpower or U-turn to prevent this. Additionally, removing its Choice Scarf with Knock Off can allow specific variants of Mega Scizor to outspeed it like the bulky Swords Dance set.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Quagsire is able to ignore all of Mega Scizor's boosts, recover off any damage that Mega Scizor dishes out on it, and threaten it with a burn from Scald. Jellicent resists Mega Scizor's STAB moves while threatening it back with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos can take any hit from Mega Scizor and threaten it back with Heat Wave. Thundurus resists Bullet Punch and can outspeed and retaliate against Mega Scizor with a powerful Electric-type STAB move. Rotom-W can take any attack from Mega Scizor and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Choice Band U-turn allows Scizor to utilize its potential as a pivot while dealing heavy damage. Bullet Punch, threatens faster targets such as Mega Diancie, Tyranitar and Serperior while giving Scizor the ability to function as a late-game sweeper. Pursuit takes advantage of the switches Scizor forces to potentially trap or severely weaken Pokemon like Latias, Slowbro, and Mega Alakazam. Choice Band Scizor's last move is quite flexible. Knock Off allows Scizor to hit both Zapdos and Cofagrigus, as well as help out its partners by removing Rocky Helmet from targets like Skarmory and Landorus-T. Superpower hits Steel-types such as Magnezone and Heatran both of which are major threats to Scizor and are OHKOed by it. Lastly, Quick Attack is an alternative priority move that hits Steel-resistant targets like Volcarona and Manaphy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs maximize Scizor's damage output, making it as much of threat as possible. 136 Speed is a notable benchmark, as this outspeeds maximum Speed Adamant Azumarill as well as Alomomola, Skarmory, defensive Volcanion, specially defensive Heatran, and Mega Venusaur. The HP investment gives Scizor bulk, allowing it to switch into Psychic-types like Mega Alakazam and Latios and Pursuit trap them. Technician is the ability of choice, optimizing Scizor’s damage output. An alternative spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe allows Scizor to outspeed Adamant Tyranitar, defensive Landorus-T, Cresselia, and Rotom-W. Choice Band provides it with the necessary power to break through targets.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>During the early- and mid-game, Scizor can use U-turn to weaken its checks like Magnezone, Heatran, and Rotom-W and create momentum. Since it lacks the option to heal itself, Rocky Helmet users like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Zapdos should be avoided. In some cases, it is advantageous to preserve Scizor’s HP to be able to effectively Pursuit trap targets like Mega Alakazam or Latios. Scizor can also attempt to sweep with Bullet Punch late-game. Knock Off is helpful to remove items like Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from foes such as Landorus-T, Slowbro, and Skarmory. Additionally, Scizor can take advantage of predicting a switch to checks like Magnezone or Heatran and hit them with Superpower.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Scizor fits best on bulky offense teams. It's a strong pivot that allows a team to keep up the pressure but lacks recovery, so it is not good for teams that prefer long fights. Since Scizor can Pursuit trap Psychic-types, it synergizes with Fighting-types like Mega Medicham, Mega Gallade, and Keldeo. Keldeo especially benefits from Scizor being able to threaten or chip down Grass-types such as non-Hidden Power Fire Serperior, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn. Weavile threatens Zapdos, Garchomp, and Landorus-T, all of which threaten Scizor with their attacks, as well as status and damage from their abilities and Rocky Helmet. Tyranitar works in a similar way; additionally, it takes Fire-type moves well and threatens Zapdos, Garchomp, and Landorus-T; the latter two only when running Ice Punch, however. Volcanion is another option that resists Fire-type moves and fits well in offensive teams.</p>"

      "Bulky Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance enables Mega Scizor to break through defensive cores and act as a setup sweeper. Roost is a reliable recovery move for Mega Scizor in order for it to stay healthy, which is important so it can check or take on hits from opposing Pokemon. Bullet Punch is a STAB priority move that is able to utilize Mega Scizor's ability in Technician. It also pairs well with Swords Dance, allowing Mega Scizor to break through teams while also threatening faster threats like Mega Diancie. Superpower is used as a way to hit Steel-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, Magnezone, and Excadrill that resist Bullet Punch. Knock Off is a great spammable move to remove items like Leftovers on Heatran and Choice Specs on Keldeo. Knock Off can also get rid of Choice Scarf from Magnezone, allowing Mega Scizor to outspeed it. It also gives coverage to hit the likes of Rotom-W and Slowbro.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>216 EVs in Speed allow Mega Scizor to outspeed Choice Scarf Hidden Power Fire Magnezone after a Knock Off. 248 HP EVs with 16 Special Defense EVs allow Mega Scizor to survive two Choice Specs-boosted Surfs from Latios without Stealth Rock. Light Metal is the chosen ability to take less damage from attacks like Low Kick from Weavile; Mega Scizor regains the ability Technician upon Mega Evolution.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Scizor acts as a switch-in to the likes of Clefable, Mega Metagross, Mega Diancie, and Weavile. Be aware of Fire-type coverage moves like Hidden Power Fire from Mega Diancie and Flamethrower from Clefable. When Mega Scizor's checks are low enough, use Swords Dance on Pokemon that can't threaten it like Ferrothorn and Fairy-types that lack Fire-type coverage. Use Bullet Punch on Pokemon that get hit super effectively or neutrally by it, such as Latios, Mega Lopunny, Clefable, Mega Altaria, Weavile, and Tyranitar to heavily damage them. Make sure Mega Scizor is healthy enough to reliably take on threats by using Roost. Superpower can be used against switch-ins like Keldeo and Heatran to do a significant amount of damage. Keep in mind that Superpower does lower Mega Scizor's Attack and Defense after each use. Knock Off can be used to remove items while also hitting Pokemon like Slowbro, Jellicent, and Mega Latias for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Scizor struggles to take on Fire-types. Water-types like Slowbro can help with these Fire-types while also checking Keldeo, another Pokemon that Mega Scizor struggles with. Gastrodon can also help with Fire-types like Heatran and absorb Water-type moves from Keldeo while also checking Electric-types like Zapdos and Thundurus. Heatran deals with Flying-types like Zapdos and Heat Wave Tornadus-T and absorbs Fire-type moves. Heatran can be used to scout out Fire-type moves from Fairy-types like Clefable as well. Gliscor can absorb status moves like Will-O-Wisp and deal with the likes of Heatran and Magnezone. Gliscor can also help dealing with Flamethrower variants of Clefable, while Mega Scizor can take on Ice Beam variants of Clefable. Partners that can remove entry hazards like Excadrill, Latios, and Starmie are appreciated by Mega Scizor, as entry hazards can easily wear it down and put it in range of opposing attacks. Pokemon that can spread paralysis like Clefable to cripple Pokemon such as Heatran that would usually outspeed Mega Scizor. Pokemon such as Latios and Starmie that can bait Dark-types like Choice Band Weavile and Choice Scarf Tyranitar into using Pursuit are good partners with Mega Scizor, as it is able to come in to set up against them. Magnezone enjoys switching into Mega Scizor and KOing it with a Hidden Power Fire, so Pokemon that can take advantage of Magnezone being Choice locked into Hidden Power Fire like Azumarill, Volcarona, and Manaphy are appreciated by Mega Scizor.</p>"

      "Offensive Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance is necessary to turn Mega Scizor into a deadly sweeper. Bullet Punch acts as Mega Scizor's main Steel-type STAB move, taking advantage of Technician while also giving it a form of priority. Bullet Punch gives Mega Scizor a form of priority, making it harder to be revenge killed while also allowing it to revenge kill or clean up teams. Bug Bite hits bulky Water- and Grass-types like Slowbro, Rotom-W, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Superpower is used to hit Steel-types like Heatran, Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp super effectively and Pokemon that resist Mega Scizor's STAB moves like Skarmory and Keldeo neutrally.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs along with an Adamant nature allow Mega Scizor to be as strong as possible. 252 Speed EVs allow Mega Scizor to outspeed threats like defensive Rotom-W and Adamant Bisharp. Offensive Mega Scizor is very common on Sticky Web teams, so this investment allows it to take advantage of Sticky Web to outspeed Pokemon like Heatran and Choice Scarf Magnezone. Light Metal is the chosen ability to help Scizor against attacks like Low Kick prior to Mega Evolving.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This specific Mega Scizor set lacks the bulk and recovery to reliably come into attacks or set up early- and mid-game. It's best used to sweep teams when its checks and counters are worn down or eliminated. Because of the lack of bulk and reliable recovery, it can't come into attacks too often. Doubling, sacking, and pivoting via U-turn and Volt Switch are the best ways to safely bring it in. Use Swords Dance on Pokemon that aren't able to threaten Mega Scizor like Choice-locked Latios, Ferrothorn, and Fairy-types that lack a Fire-type move. Bullet Punch should be used to revenge kill foes thanks to its priority. Use Superpower to hit Steel-types like Excadrill or on the switch against checks like Heatran or Keldeo.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This specific Mega Scizor set belongs on hyper offense teams. Entry hazards help Mega Scizor by putting Pokemon in range of its attacks. Shuckle is a good partner, as it can set both Sticky Web and Stealth Rock. Sticky Web also makes up for Mega Scizor's low Speed, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon that could normally outspeed and threaten it like Choice Scarf Magnezone, Heatran, Keldeo, and Mega Medicham. Thundurus is a good partner as well, as it can wear down Pokemon that can trouble Mega Scizor like Keldeo, Zapdos, and Rotom-W. Bisharp shares a lot of common switch-ins with Mega Scizor, making it the perfect partner to wear down mutual checks like Heatran, Keldeo, and Zapdos. Offensive Water-types like Tail Glow Manaphy and Belly Drum Azumarill can help to deal with Fire-types that threaten Mega Scizor like Heatran and appreciate Mega Scizor's ability to take on Grass-types like Tangrowth.</p>"

Swords Dance is an option to boost the damage of Bullet Punch and U-turn. Defog is also a worthy option as a means to remove entry hazards.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs with 48 Defense EVs and an Impish nature allow Mega Scizor to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick. 160 EVs in Special Defense allow Mega Scizor to tank two Choice Specs-boosted Surfs from Latios after Stealth Rock damage, as well as making +1 Leftovers Clefable's Flamethrower a roll to OHKO it. It also gives Mega Scizor a high chance to survive uninvested Tornadus-T's Heat Wave after Stealth Rock. 56 EVs in Speed allow Mega Scizor to outspeed Adamant Azumarill, making your priority move faster.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Mega Scizor set can be used to reliably check threats like Mega Metagross, Weavile, Choice Specs Latios, and Fairy-types that lack a Fire-type move. U-turn can be used to gain momentum and get other teammates into the battlefield safely. Use Roost to keep Mega Scizor healthy to allow it to consistently switch into things it checks. Bullet Punch is used as a way to revenge kill Pokemon and hit Fairy-types like Mega Diancie and Clefable for super effective damage. Use Pursuit on Psychic-types like Mega Metagross, Latios, and Mega Alakazam to wear them down. Swords Dance can be used as a way to boost the damage of U-turn and Bullet Punch but should only be used against foes that cannot threaten Mega Scizor. Defog is used to remove entry hazards like Stealth Rocks and Spikes and should only be used when the foe cannot threaten Mega Scizor.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Keldeo is a good partner, as it can help Mega Scizor by checking Fire-types like Heatran while also appreciating Mega Scizor's ability to Pursuit trap Psychic-types like Latios and its resistance to Fairy-type moves. Rotom-W can also help Mega Scizor by dealing with Fire-types like Heatran and Talonflame, and, in return, Rotom-W appreciates Mega Scizor's ability to take on Grass-types like Tangrowth and Fairy-types like Clefable while also forming a VoltTurn core with it. Pokemon that appreciate a free switch in via Mega Scizor's U-turn like Crawdaunt are great partners as well.

  "Shuckle": {
    "overview": "<p>Last generation, Shuckle was stuck in NU, incapable of doing much besides sitting around and Toxic stalling until it fainted. But when XY came around, Shuckle got access to a rare and unique move: Sticky Web. Being the most reliable user of Sticky Web is a small but valuable niche that no other Pokemon in the metagame can boast. This, along with its useful access to Stealth Rock, allows Shuckle to see the light of OU. Despite having no offensive presence, Shuckle cannot be set up on thanks to its access to Encore.</p> <p>However, don't be fooled into thinking Shuckle is a flawless Pokemon. Its base 230 defenses are offset by a terrible base 20 HP, meaning that Shuckle isn't as bulky as it seems. It is crippled by Taunt and Trick, though the former is somewhat remedied by Mental Herb. Weaknesses to common Water-, Rock-, and Steel-type moves, along with no reliable recovery, mean that Shuckle won't be staying for long. It will always be moving last because of its nonexistent base 5 Speed, which means that it will have to take a hit before doing anything. It is essentially a sitting duck on the battlefield, and it has to rely on Toxic or Infestation to do any damage. It also receives competition from Smeargle as a Sticky Web user, as it gets Magic Coat to ward off Taunt and Spore to provide opportunities to set up Sticky Web. However, Shuckle is much bulkier and much more reliable than Smeargle, and can't be set up on. Despite these shortcomings, Shuckle provides valuable support to Sticky Web teams, and in the right hands, can be a thorn in your opponent's side.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shuckle gets a decent offensive movepool, but putrid offensive stats prevent Shuckle from running any other attacking options. Acupressure can turn Shuckle into a monstrous tank, but it is ultimately a luck-based move, and Shuckle will often not have enough time to set it up properly. Rest is an option for full recovery, but the loss of momentum generated by using Rest is so great that it's hardly worth it, even when paired with a cleric. Besides, Shuckle doesn't need to last forever, it just needs to get down a couple of hazards for its team. Power Split averages the offensive stats of two Pokemon, and can be useful as it essentially halves the foe's offensive stats as Shuckle's are nonexistent. Shell Smash can be used with Contrary to act as a pseudo-Cosmic Power along with Toxic, Rest, and Power Split. However, this set is incredibly hard to pull off correctly in the fast-paced OU metagame, as it is countered by Taunt users, Poison-types, and Steel-types. As a result, it will often be a waste of a teamslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Pokemon with Magic Bounce, such as Espeon and Mega Absol, reflect back any hazards that Shuckle tries to set up, preventing Shuckle from completing its job. However, Shuckle can deal with these Pokemon to some extent by trapping them with Infestation and switching to an appropriate counter.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Any Pokemon with a strong super effective STAB attack can deal with Shuckle decently, but will not prevent Shuckle from getting up Sticky Web. Examples include Keldeo, Scizor, and Terrakion.</p> <p><strong>Bisharp</strong>: Bisharp is one of the best counters to Shuckle, as the Speed drop from Sticky Web doubles its Attack via Defiant. It can then OHKO Shuckle with Iron Head and attempt a sweep.</p> <p><strong>Hazard Removal</strong>: Rapid Spin and Defog users such as Excadrill and Mandibuzz are useful for removing Sticky Web, but they must be wary of Encore and in the case of Defog a Bisharp paired with Shuckle.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sticky Web": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sticky Web is Sticky Web, and Shuckle's number one mission is to set it up. Stealth Rock creates a nice entry hazard combination with Sticky Web, as it does a lot of damage to the Flying-types that are immune to Sticky Web. Encore is very important, as without it, Shuckle is huge setup bait. It also generates useful momentum for Shuckle's team. Infestation is useful for racking up damage and trapping opponents. It also has no immunities and isn't affected by Taunt, unlike Toxic. However, if your team deals with Steel- and Poison-types fairly well, Toxic can go in the last slot, as it does more damage over time and doesn't go away after a few turns like Infestation does. Knock Off is a great utility move for Shuckle to use, as it cripples Pokemon that rely heavily on their items, such as Heatran and Chansey, but it is quite weak coming from an uninvested Shuckle and can get in the way of other Knock Off users.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs with a Bold nature give Shuckle maximum bulk on the physical side, while minimizing Foul Play and confusion damage. Mental Herb gives Shuckle a chance against users of Taunt, Trick, and status, allowing it to get up at least one of its hazards. Sturdy ensures that Shuckle will lay down either Sticky Web or Stealth Rock without getting OHKOed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As a general rule of thumb, use Stealth Rock before Sticky Web when the opponent has a Pokemon that is 4x weak to it, or when the opponent has two or more Pokemon immune to Sticky Web. Otherwise, use Sticky Web first. Once you have laid down hazards, use a combination of Infestation and Encore to trap the opponent, and switch to an appropriate counter. However, do not hesitate to use Encore if you predict a setup move. Also use Encore when you predict a Rapid Spin or Defog. One of two things will happen: they will switch out, and you get Sticky Web up on the switch, or they stay in, and you switch to a setup sweeper and attempt a sweep from there. Shuckle is best used as a lead, setting up hazards and using Infestation and Encore to mess with your opponent, switching out whenever necessary. If you need to, don't be afraid to fodder Shuckle, as its main job is to set up hazards. However, if you spot a potential Rapid Spin or Defog user on the opposing team, you should save Shuckle in order to set up hazards again.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Shuckle should only be used on teams that intend to abuse Sticky Web to its fullest. Therefore, Shuckle works well with any Pokemon that has high Attack or Special Attack and middling Speed; examples include, but are not limited to, Manaphy, Chandelure, Kyurem-B, Haxorus, Dragonite, Hydreigon, Landorus-T, Mamoswine, Exploud, Mega Heracross, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Medicham, and Mega Charizard Y. Bisharp is almost necessary for its ability to take advantage of Defog users; something that Shuckle absolutely hates. Mega Heracross, Keldeo, and Terrakion can take care of opposing Bisharp trying to take advantage of Sticky Web, and benefit from Sticky Web as well. Ghost-types, such as Gengar, are also useful for blocking Rapid Spin.</p>"

  "Heracross": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its monstrous Attack stat backed by two high Base Power STAB attacks, Mega Heracross is one of the most threatening wallbreakers in the tier. Its wallbreaking power is further enhanced by excellent and powerful coverage options in Rock Blast and Bullet Seed. Though Mega Heracross should primarily be used for its immense power and coverage, it also possesses great bulk and a few useful resistances. These traits give Mega Heracross a decent amount of staying power against slower builds in particular. However, Mega Heracross's bulk only goes so far, especially when one considers its mediocre Speed and four common weaknesses. Likewise, Mega Heracross is rather easy to revenge kill, especially for more offensively oriented teams. Furthermore, checks such as Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, and Talonflame are as common as ever, meaning that Mega Heracross sometimes struggles in the current metagame. That being said, Mega Heracross is great at taking advantage of some prominent Pokemon such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Mega Lopunny, making it an excellent choice if one is looking for a bulky wallbreaker with insane power.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf set with Moxie is a decent option that outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame while gaining more power with each KO. However, neither of Heracross's STAB moves are particularly spammable, and thus the set is normally outclassed by Choice Scarf Landorus-T or Choice Scarf Terrakion. Another option is a Guts set using Toxic Orb with Swords Dance for extreme wallbreaking power, but regular Heracross lacks the bulk of its Mega Evolution and is worn down rather easily.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon That Resist Mega Heracross's STAB Moves</strong>: Physically defensive variants of Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Clefable all avoid being 2HKOed by Mega Heracross. Landorus-T is primarily a check due to Intimidate and its ability to go one-for-one against Mega Heracross in many scenarios. It also threatens to badly poison Mega Heracross with Toxic or pivot with U-turn into something that can beat Mega Heracross. Gliscor can net a 2HKO on Mega Heracross with an unboosted Acrobatics or attempt to stall out Mega Heracross with a combination of Toxic and Roost. Physically defensive Clefable is perhaps the best check to Mega Heracross, as it avoids the 2HKO from Rock Blast and 2HKOes Mega Heracross with Moonblast in return.</p> <p><strong>Fast Revenge Killers</strong>: Numerous common revenge killers such as Mega Alakazam, Mega Manectric, and Life Orb Tornadus-T can come in after Mega Heracross has gotten a KO and retaliate with a super effective move.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Tornadus-T, Talonflame, and Mega Pinsir can switch into Mega Heracross's STAB moves and KO with their own Flying-type STAB attack. Skarmory can switch into any move that is not Close Combat, tank a Close Combat, and then KO with Brave Bird or Counter.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Charizard X are able to stomach one or both of Mega Heracross's STAB attacks and OHKO in return with Fire-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types are typically fast enough to outpace Mega Heracross and revenge kill it after it has taken out another Pokemon. However, most of them, such as Latios, Alakazam, and Starmie, have low physical bulk, so they must be wary of switching into Mega Heracross.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairies such as Azumarill and Mega Gardevoir resist one or both of Mega Heracross's STAB attacks and can either KO it or deal a huge amount of damage in return.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Mega Heracross's strongest Fighting-type STAB attack and severely dents anything that doesn't resist it. Pin Missile is Mega Heracross's secondary STAB move, which hits an impressive 125 Base Power thanks to Skill Link and nets at least neutral damage on Psychic-types that resist Close Combat. Rock Blast also benefits from Skill Link and achieves great coverage alongside Mega Heracross's STAB moves, hitting Flying-types like Talonflame and Tornadus-T super effectively and a few other targets for neutral damage. Substitute is preferred in the last slot to ease prediction and make use of the numerous switches Mega Heracross forces. A second possibility for the final slot is Swords Dance, as it boosts Mega Heracross's power to ridiculous levels while also mitigating the effects of Landorus-T's Intimidate. Bullet Seed is yet a third option whose primary use is to OHKO Azumarill and Quagsire; however, these are 2HKOed by Mega Heracross's Rock Blast and STAB attacks, respectively, making Bullet Seed a generally inferior option.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Heracronite is the item of choice for the substantial boost in power and bulk it provides. Moxie is the preferred ability before Mega Evolving to nab an Attack boost against a weakened foe or predicted sacrifice, though it can be somewhat unreliable, as Pin Missile, Rock Blast, and Bullet Seed are all rather weak without the guaranteed five hits from Skill Link. The given EV spread has enough Speed investment to outpace uninvested Landorus-T after Mega Evolving. The Attack EVs, paired with an Adamant nature, ensure a 2HKO on standard Magic Guard Clefable with Rock Blast most of the time. The remaining EVs are placed into HP to make use of Mega Heracross's great bulk, allowing it to takes hits from threats such as Bisharp, Mega Lopunny, and Weavile much better.</p> <p>If speed is not a concern, some EVs may be removed from Speed to reach a few other benchmarks. Specifically, 92 Speed EVs allows Mega Heracross to outpace uninvested Rotom-W, while 56 speed EVs helps it outpace Adamant Azumarill. Any EVs removed from Speed should be placed into Defense, as Mega Heracross's typing makes it more suited to tanking physical hits. A more offensive spread of 252 Atk / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature is an option as well, though it should be noted that Mega Heracross will still be outsped by most offensive threats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Heracross is best utilized as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker thanks to its impressive power and substantial bulk. In general, you want to get Mega Heracross on the field as often as possible to give it the most wallbreaking opportunities for your late-game cleaner or sweeper. You should bring Mega Heracross in against foes such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar or Choice Specs Keldeo that are Choice locked into resisted attacks or defensive Pokemon that cannot do much to it once it is behind a Substitute, such as Amoonguss or Tangrowth. A slow Volt Switch or U-turn or a predicted double switch are also effective means of getting Mega Heracross onto the field.</p> <p>Once Mega Heracross is in battle, it is recommended to set up a Substitute only if you need to ease prediction against threats like Talonflame or Tornadus-T. If your opponent lacks threats such as these, firing off either of Mega Heracross's high-powered STAB attacks is generally the better strategy. More specifically, you should be wary of pointlessly wasting Mega Heracross's HP if your opponent lacks switch-ins to either of Mega Heracross's STAB attacks. Lastly, before Mega Evolving, it is possible to net an Attack boost with Moxie, though this strategy is not particularly reliable due the relatively low power of Heracross's moves if Skill Link is not active. On a similar note, forgoing Mega Evolution to keep a bit of extra Speed might prove useful in some scenarios, as Heracross is able to Speed tie threats such as Adamant Bisharp at worst before Mega Evolving.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Thundurus is an excellent partner for Mega Heracross, as it KOes Flying-types such as Talonflame, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T. Thundurus also provides speed control via Prankster Thunder Wave and can remove the items of defensive threats such as Clefable. Rotom-W and Raikou are likewise great partners for their ability to beat Flying-types with the added benefit of being able to bring Mega Heracross in safely with Volt Switch. Similarly, other pivots such as Landorus-T and Jirachi make solid partners as well. Mega Heracross also appreciates Pursuit support, with Assault Vest Metagross in particular being a good partner for its ability to beat and/or trap Latios, Latias, Clefable, and Mega Gardevoir. Tyranitar also deserves a mention for its reliability in trapping even bulky Psychic-types while also beating Talonflame. Glare Serperior is a fantastic offensive partner that can lure in and paralyze threats such as Heatran and Tornadus-T for Mega Heracross. Serperior also does well against certain checks such as Azumarill and Clefable. Finally, bulky Steel-type hazard setters and status users such as Heatran, Klefki, and Ferrothorn are excellent partners because of their defensive synergy with Mega Heracross and their ability to enhance Mega Heracross's wallbreaking abilities with entry hazards and/or status.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its great defensive typing and excellent Defense stat, Skarmory is one of the best physical walls in the tier, able to check many physical attackers like Excadrill, Weavile, Mega Lopunny, Mega Scizor, and Landorus-T. Skarmory also has access to many utility moves, like Spikes to wear down foes as they switch in, Roost to stay healthy, and Whirlwind to phase foes. Skarmory does, however, have very low HP and Special Defense stats, making it vulnerable to strong special attackers like Keldeo, Thundurus, and Mega Charizard Y, and its Flying / Steel typing leaves it vulnerable to common types in Fire and Electric.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shed Shell is a viable item to avoid being trapped by Magnezone. Iron Head hits Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Diancie. Toxic slowly wears down common switch-ins like Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Zapdos. Taunt can be used over Brave Bird or Counter to stop entry hazards like Sticky Webs, Stealth Rock, and opposing Spikes. Taunt also stops foes' healing moves like Soft-Boiled from Chansey and Clefable and setup moves like Calm Mind.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon and Moves</strong>: Thundurus is able to switch into Skarmory and threaten it with a Thunderbolt. Zapdos and Rotom-W can safely switch into Skarmory and threaten it with an Electric-type move like Discharge or Volt Switch, respectively; Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W is also problematic. Electric-type coverage moves, such as Thunder Punch from Mega Metagross and Thunderbolt from Mega Latias and Clefable, can all threaten Skarmory as well.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types Pokemon and Moves</strong>: Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Volcarona are able to switch into Skarmory and OHKO it with their STAB moves. Fire-type coverage moves like Fire Blast from Garchomp and Slowbro, Hidden Power Fire from Serperior and Mega Diancie, Heat Wave from Tornadus-T, and Flamethrower from Clefable can all threaten Skarmory as well.</p> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: Magnezone is one of the biggest threats to Skarmory, as it is able to trap Skarmory thanks to Magnet Pull and eliminate it with an Electric-type move like Thunderbolt or Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers like Keldeo, Choice Specs Latios, and Serperior can all threaten and break through Skarmory due to its low Special Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Quagsire, Jellicent, Slowbro, and Suicune can all switch into Skarmory and threaten it with a burn from Scald.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes is useful for wearing down foes as they switch in, especially when used with Whirlwind. Roost is used to keep Skarmory healthy and out of range of its foes' attacks. Whirlwind allows Skarmory to phaze foes, which is useful against setup sweepers like Swords Dance Mega Pinsir and Excadrill, and prevent Substitute Serperior from using it as setup fodder. Alternatively, Defog removes entry hazards like Stealth Rock and opposing Spikes. Brave Bird does decent damage versus threats like Serperior and Tornadus-T, whereas Counter can be used to handle physical attackers that Skarmory likes to come in on like Swords Dance Excadrill, Mega Lopunny, and Weavile.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment helps Skarmory check a wide range of physical attackers like Weavile, Excadrill, Mega Pinsir, Mega Lopunny, Bisharp, Mega Scizor, and many more. Rocky Helmet is used to punish and chip Pokemon that use contact moves, such U-turn Landorus-T and Mega Scizor, Iron Head Excadrill, and Meteor Mash Mega Metagross. Sturdy is chosen to allow Skarmory to take any one hit from full HP and retaliate with a Whirlwind or Counter. If you use Counter over Brave Bird, a Bold nature can be used to lower damage taken from confusion and Foul Play. Skarmory also has the option to run a more specially defensive EV spread to better take attacks from Mega Diancie, Latios, Tornadus-T, and other special attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Skarmory's two main roles are to lay Spikes and check physical attackers. Keep Skarmory healthy with Roost to reliably switch into attacks and use Whirlwind on threats that are trying to set up, such as Swords Dance Excadrill and Pinsir and Calm Mind Clefable without Thunderbolt or Flamethrower. Take advantage of Sturdy to eat any one hit and retaliate with a Counter or Whirlwind. Be wary of strong Fire- and Electric-type coverage moves such as Fire Blast from Garchomp, Flamethrower from Clefable, Heat Wave from Tornadus-T, and Thunder Punch from Mega Metagross. Try to scout for these moves by using Roost when expecting Skarmory to be hit by one or switching out. Also, be wary of Magnezone, which can come in and trap Skarmory with Magnet Pull. Skarmory can use Whirlwind as it comes in or simply double switch out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Skarmory is best used on bulkier team archetypes like stall and balance. Chansey can help Skarmory take on special attacks while appreciating Skarmory's ability to soak up physical attacks. Gastrodon deals with Electric-types like Magnezone and Fire-types like Heatran. Gliscor can help Skarmory deal with Fire-types like Heatran, acts as a status absorber, and appreciates Skarmory baiting Magnezone to lock itself into an Electric-type move so it can set up with Swords Dance. Clefable is also able to absorb status moves like Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W and can cripple threats like Heatran with a Thunder Wave or Knock Off. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can help eliminate hazard removers like Latios and Latias to keep Skarmory's Spikes up. Amoonguss resists Electric-type moves and deals with threatening Water-types like Keldeo. It also has access to Spore to put common shared switch-ins like Heatran to sleep. Offensive Pokemon like Alakazam, Serperior, and Bisharp appreciate Skarmory's Spikes, as they put foes in range of their attacks.</p>"

  "Houndoom": {
    "overview": "<p>Though it is often forgotten, Mega Houndoom brings a huge amount of utility to the table, checking dangerous threats such as Bisharp and Latios. It also has favorable matchups against common Pokemon; against offensive teams, common switch-ins to it such as Tyranitar and Azumarill are crippled by Will-O-Wisp, while stall teams are troubled by Taunt. Mega Houndoom's access to Nasty Plot and its high Speed allows it to sweep teams with ease. However, its weakness to Stealth Rock can be troublesome: it also is forced out by threats such as Keldeo, Heatran, Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, Mega Lopunny and Mega Altaria. Nonetheless, Mega Houndoom's utility and ability to sweep balanced teams easily makes it a solid choice to build around.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sucker Punch is Mega Houndoom's only option for priority and can mitigate issues against opposing priority and Choice Scarf users. However, it is quite weak without Attack investment. Destiny Bond is a viable alternative in the last slot, but the utility provided by Taunt or Will-O-Wisp or the coverage given by Hidden Power Grass is usually superior. Finally, Sludge Bomb is an option used to hit Mega Altaria and Assault Vest Azumarill harder, but Mega Houndoom needs Taunt or Will-O-Wisp to be effective.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Garchomp, Choice Scarf Keldeo, Mega Aerodactyl, Excadrill, and Terrakion make for great offensive checks or counters to Mega Houndoom, depending on the field condition. Strong priority users such as Breloom, Talonflame, and Conkeldurr are also good checks or counters to Mega Houndoom. Thundurus can paralyze Houndoom, crippling it. Also, Pokemon that naturally outspeed Mega Houndoom and can hit it super effectively, such as Mega Lopunny and Tornadus-T, make for good checks to Mega Houndoom.</p> <p><strong>Mega Diancie</strong>: Mega Diancie can switch into Mega Houndoom with ease, as it walls Mega Houndoom's STAB moves and can bounce Will-O-Wisp back. It can then easily OHKO Mega Houndoom with Diamond Storm back.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar replaces sun with sand, resists Mega Houndoom's STAB moves, and has the bulk to take anything before retaliating with Stone Edge. Tyranitar is thus Mega Houndoom's best counter. Tyranitar can still be eliminated by a combination of Sunny Day and Solar Beam on the switch; Will-O-Wisp can also be problematic for it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey switches into Mega Houndoom if it's not using Taunt, but if it does, the opposing team can wear it down rather easily; however, Mega Houndoom with Taunt can prevent a weakened Chansey from healing. Also, be aware that Chansey is 2HKOed by Fire Blast in sun with prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Conkeldurr</strong>: Conkeldurr can take hits from Mega Houndoom easily while benefitting from Will-O-Wisp, thanks to Guts. It can easily OHKO Mega Houndoom back with Drain Punch and restore any lost HP.</p> <p><strong>Azumarill</strong>: Azumarill walls Mega Houndoom's STAB moves, and it can setup on Mega Houndoom with Belly Drum. Assault Vest Azumarill takes even less damage from Mega Houndoom's attacks; however, Azumarill still has to be wary of Will-O-Wisp, which will prevent it from doing its job.</p>",

Fire Blast and Dark Pulse are great STAB moves that have good neutral coverage. Will-O-Wisp is useful against offensive teams and can cripple common switch-ins to Mega Houndoom such as Azumarill, Tyranitar, Terrakion, and Garchomp. It also allows Mega Houndoom to check Bisharp. Taunt can be used to stallbreak, but if it used, Mega Houndoom loses out on the utility of Will-O-Wisp. Hidden Power Grass and Sludge Bomb can be used in the last moveslot to hit Pokemon that otherwise wall Mega Houndoom, such as Azumarill, Keldeo, Terrakion, Tyranitar, Togekiss, and Mega Altaria, though Will-O-Wisp usually cripples most of these, and its utility will be missed. Sunny Day can be used to utilize Solar Power, heightening Mega Houndoom's damage output, but it can be worn down easily; Solar Beam is also easy for an opponent to take advantage of.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs allow Mega Houndoom to survive 3 Seismic Tosses from Chansey and Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird. Flash Fire allows Mega Houndoom to switch-into Fire-type moves such as Volcarona's Fire Blast and Mega Charizard Y's Fire Blast, as well as Heatran's Lava Plume. Against Mega Charizard Y's case, a boost can be very important because it gives Mega Houndoom a Solar Power boost meaning it can do a huge amount of damage, while Tyranitar, a common teammate of Mega Charizard Y, is neutered by Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Offensive teams have trouble dealing with Mega Houndoom, so using Will-O-Wisp to target predicted switch-ins is vital to its success. Mega Houndoom can take advantage of stall teams' weakness to Taunt by double switching many times to wear Chansey down with Stealth Rock and then, when Chansey is weakened, Taunting it so that it cannot heal and setting up on it with Nasty Plot.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gengar and Latios make for great teammates to pair with Mega Houndoom. They appreciate Tyranitar being burned so they cannot be reliably Pursuit trapped, allowing them to wreak havoc with Shadow Ball and Draco Meteor, respectively; Earthquake Latios gets a special mention for the ability to eliminate Heatran, a check to Mega Houndoom. Gyarados has excellent synergy with Mega Houndoom and is able to set up on a bunch of switch-ins to Mega Houndoom. Mega Houndoom is also able to deal with Ferrothorn, a Pokemon that walls Gyarados. Starmie, Excadrill, Latias, and Latios can remove hazards and share nice synergy with Mega Houndoom. Toxicroak is an underrated teammate that has plenty of opportunities to spam Gunk Shot against Mega Houndoom's checks and counters such as Tyranitar, Chansey, Keldeo, Unaware Clefable, Terrakion, and Mega Altaria, if expecting a double switch.</p>"

Kingdra also does not stack weaknesses with the rest of its team because it is neutral to Grass- and Electric-type attacks, unlike other Swift Swim Pokemon such as Mega Swampert and Omastar. However, Kingdra has somewhat underwhelming bulk, rendering it susceptible to strong priority moves such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Bisharp's Sucker Punch when weakened. Moreover, rain only lasts for a maximum of eight turns, and Kingdra's reliance on rain for Speed and power makes it easily exploitable outside of it. Kingdra's Special Attack really isn't that great either, especially compared to other Draco Meteor users such as Latios.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Because Kingdra has quite a shallow movepool, it does not have many other options to utilize. Signal Beam has the utility of breaking past Slowbro, Starmie, and Celebi without facing the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor. A set utilizing Sniper, Focus Energy, and Scope Lens allows Kingdra to guarantee critical hits on every single hit, but Kingdra is too slow and easily revenge killed to be able to pull off such a set effectively. Dragon Pulse has more accuracy than Draco Meteor and does not come with the side effect of lowering Kingdra's Special Attack; however, the drop in power is quite noticeable. Hidden Power Fire allows Kingdra to lure in Ferrothorn and KO it; however, the Base Power is decreased in the rain and, aside from Ferrothorn, the move does not hit many relevant targets. Rain Dance allows Kingdra to replenish rain by itself so that it doesn't become overly reliant on Politoed. Substitute allows Kingdra to evade Sucker Punch from Bisharp and status from the likes of Rotom-W and Celebi, but, combined with repeated switch-ins with entry hazards and Life Orb recoil, Kingdra will be on a short fuse. Kingdra has access to Dragon Dance, so it can utilize various items such as Lum Berry and Life Orb in tandem with it to sweep, but it is outclassed as a Dragon Dance user by Mega Charizard X, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Altaria.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn resists both of Kingdra's STAB moves, takes little damage from Ice Beam, can use Kingdra as setup fodder with Stealth Rock or Spikes, and can wear it down with Power Whip and Leech Seed. However, it needs to watch out for the rare Hidden Power Fire and is crippled by Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Mew, and Slowking can continuously recover off any damage taken from Kingdra and stall out its rain. Chansey is a particularly effective counter to most of Kingdra's sets bar the 64 Atk / 216 SpA / 228 Spe spread because it is not 2HKOed by any of Kingdra's moves and can replenish its health with Soft-Boiled and 3HKO Kingdra back with Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Mega Altaria</strong>: Unless Kingdra packs Ice Beam, Mega Altaria is an effective check to Kingdra. Mega Altaria resists Kingdra's Water-type STAB attacks and is immune to its Dragon-type ones. In return, it can heal itself with Roost, use Kingdra as setup fodder with Dragon Dance, or outright OHKO it with Hyper Voice. However, it dislikes Scald burns, especially if it's a Dragon Dance variant.</p> <p><strong>Azumarill</strong>: Azumarill resists Kingdra's Water-type STAB moves and is immune to its Dragon-type ones; Azumarill can then set up on Kingdra with Belly Drum or OHKO it with Play Rough. However, it loathes burns from Scald.</p> <p><strong>Other Weather Conditions</strong>: Because Kingdra is reliant on the rain for its Speed and power, other weather conditions such as sand and sun put Kingdra at a severe disadvantage. However, weather inducers such as Tyranitar and Mega Charizard Y cannot switch directly into Kingdra out of fear of getting 2HKOed by Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers and priority users such as Bisharp, Talonflame, and Dragonite can KO Kingdra when it's weakened. Mega Alakazam also deserves a mention, as it can Trace Kingdra's Swift Swim, thus outspeeding it, and KO it with Psychic after some prior damage.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Kingdra's strongest STAB move, is bolstered by the rain and Choice Specs, and severely dents non-resistant Pokemon. Draco Meteor is Kingdra's secondary STAB move, allowing it to get past Water-, Grass-, and Dragon-types such as Slowbro, Celebi, and Latios, which resist Hydro Pump. Scald can cripple many common Kingdra switch-ins such as Mega Altaria, Ferrothorn, and Azumarill via a burn; the move can also be used late-game to clean up due to its perfect accuracy. Ice Beam takes out bulky Grass-types such as Celebi, as well as Mega Altaria, but it is mostly a filler move, as most Grass-types are hit hard by Hydro Pump or Draco Meteor already. Dragon Pulse is an option to let Kingdra clean up more easily, especially in the face of Pokemon that resist Water, without facing the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Speed EVs allow Kingdra to outpace Choice Scarf Latios and everything slower in the rain and Jolly base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Bisharp and Breloom outside of rain. Maximum investment into Special Attack ensures that Kingdra hits as hard as possible, and the remaining EVs are placed into HP for some additional bulk. Choice Specs further raises Kingdra's Special Attack and, in tandem with the rain, aids its wallbreaking and sweeping. Swift Swim takes advantage of the rain to double Kingdra's Speed and bolster its Water-type STAB attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kingdra should use Scald on switches into Azumarill, Mega Altaria, and Ferrothorn to potentially cripple the foe via a burn. Because of Kingdra's double resistance to Fire- and Water-type moves, it can easily pivot into Pokemon with said moves, such as Heatran and Alomomola. Kingdra greatly appreciates Volt Switch or U-turn support, and it is also best brought into play after a teammate has fainted or by a double switch, as Kingdra's bulk really isn't that great. Kingdra is best used as a wallbreaker, punching holes in the opponent's team early- and mid-game. Hydro Pump is easily the most spammable move because it is the most powerful one in Kingdra's arsenal, as even Pokemon that resist it, such as Mega Venusaur, are 2HKOed in the rain.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Politoed is a mandatory partner to Kingdra because it brings rain to boost Kingdra's Speed and the power of its Water-type STAB moves. Other rain sweepers, such as Tornadus-T, Kabutops, and Omastar, are good partners as well because they also take advantage of the rain; Tornadus-T wears down Ferrothorn and Celebi for Kingdra while providing crucial momentum with U-turn. Kabutops hits physically, allowing it to muscle past specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, which Kingdra struggles against, and 2HKOes Ferrothorn with Low Kick, while Omastar checks Talonflame and cripples Chansey with Knock Off. Setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor, Nasty Plot Thundurus, and Mega Pinsir love Kingdra's ability to weaken the opposing team for a potential sweep by them, and they can also deal with bulky Grass-types. Rotom-W checks Talonflame, Bisharp, Thundurus, and Azumarill, all of which Kingdra dislikes, as Talonflame's and Bisharp's priority attacks deal a hefty chunk of damage to Kingdra, Thundurus can use Prankster Thunder Wave to cripple it, and Azumarill can outright OHKO Kingdra with Play Rough.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Kingdra's strongest Water-type STAB move, dealing hefty damage to everything that does not resist it. Draco Meteor provides good coverage alongside Hydro Pump, allowing Kingdra to muscle past Grass-, Dragon-, and Water-types such as Celebi, Garchomp, and Rotom-W. Scald has a solid chance to cripple switch-ins such as Azumarill, Ferrothorn, and Mega Altaria with a burn and is also more accurate than Hydro Pump. Outrage is a great move to use after Draco Meteor and allows Kingdra to finish off weakened Rotom-W and Celebi after Draco Meteor; however, it comes with the nasty side effect of locking Kingdra into it. Waterfall is a handy option to get past specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and is also an excellent move to use after Draco Meteor because it ignores the Special Attack drops. Ice Beam 2HKOes Grass-types such as Celebi and Chesnaught, as well as Mega Altaria, but it is more of a filler move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>228 EVs are invested into Speed to outspeed everything up to Choice Scarf Latios in the rain, as well as Jolly base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Breloom and Bisharp outside of it. Maximum investment in Special Attack ensures that Kingdra hits as hard as possible, and the remaining EVs are invested into Attack to power up its physical moves. Life Orb provides Kingdra with an invaluable boost to its offenses and aids its sweeping capabilities. A Rash nature maximizes Kingdra's Special Attack and is chosen over a Mild nature to take priority attacks better. Alternately, an EV spread of 64 Atk / 216 SpA / 228 Spe could be used, which has enough Attack investment to ensure that Kingdra 2HKOes Chansey after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes but comes at the cost of a significant Special Attack drop.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kingdra is best used as a wallbreaker, working well early-game to punch holes in the opponent's team due to its decent power under rain and great Speed. Kingdra can also be used as a sweeper, but this is rather unnecessary, as it will often be paired up with other rain sweepers such as Omastar and Mega Swampert. Checks and counters such as Ferrothorn and Mega Altaria should be removed prior to Kingdra attempting to sweep. Use appropriate coverage moves to dent or cripple switch-ins, such as Draco Meteor on Mega Venusaur and Scald on Ferrothorn. Because of rain's limited length, one must take advantage of every turn and use it as efficiently as possible. Kingdra has double resistances to Fire- and Water-type moves, so it can easily pivot into Pokemon using said moves, such as Heatran and Rotom-W. However, don't overestimate its bulk, as it is susceptible to entry hazards and Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Politoed is a compulsory partner for Kingdra, providing crucial rain support for Kingdra to bolster its stats. Backup rain setters such as Klefki and Thundurus are greatly appreciated as well for their ability to replenish Kingdra's Swift Swim should Politoed faint. Kingdra should be paired up with other rain sweepers such as Mega Swampert, Kabutops, and Tornadus-T; they can weaken Kingdra's checks and counters and appreciate Kingdra's ability to put huge dents in the opposing team. In particular, Omastar forms a great wallbreaking core with Kingdra, as it checks Talonflame and cripples Chansey with Knock Off. Because Kingdra struggles to beat certain Water- and Grass-types, such as Slowking and Ferrothorn, Pokemon that can reliably take them on are good partners. Examples include Mega Heracross and Mega Pinsir, which can deal with them via their Bug-, Fighting-, and Flying-type moves. Mega Manectric and Raikou both fit amazingly into rain teams, boasting the ability to check Thundurus and Talonflame, function outside of rain, use a perfectly accurate Thunder, and provide useful momentum for Kingdra with Volt Switch. Magnezone can trap and KO Ferrothorn outside of rain and also has a perfectly accurate Thunder. Lures to various Kingdra checks are also appreciated, such as Focus Blast Politoed and mixed Thundurus. Rotom-W and Ferrothorn deal with Azumarill and Mega Altaria, respectively, which otherwise causes Kingdra a lot of trouble. Azelf is another great pick, providing Stealth Rock, Explosion to let Kingdra come in safely, and possibly Rain Dance support.</p>"

  "Porygon2": {
    "overview": "<p>Porygon2 is one of the bulkiest walls in OU with a useful ability in Trace, but it faces tough competition from other walls such as Chansey and Clefable. While it can act as a sponge to absorb strong attacks for its team, its passivity makes it unappealing to some players. Porygon2 is also extremely vulnerable to Knock Off and Toxic, and it lacks Leftovers recovery, all of which make it unreliable. However, it still has some offensive presence and an impressive movepool, which includes Thunder Wave, to support its team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>STAB Tri Attack hits decently hard, but BoltBeam provides better coverage. Magic Coat is also viable, as it can surprise foes that try to Taunt or status Porygon2. Download is an option over Trace if you want Porygon2 to play a more offensive role. Porygon2 can also run a Trick Room set, as its bulk provides ample opportunities for it to set up. Charge Beam is another option, as it helps Porygon2 muscle through some bulky Pokemon, but it is not a very useful move otherwise. Hidden Power Fire can also be used, as it hits unsuspecting Scizor and Ferrothorn for 4x super effective damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Calm Mind Sweepers</strong>: Calm Mind sweepers such as Clefable stop Porygon2 cold with their bulk and abilities.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off users such as Bisharp and Mega Scizor can remove Porygon2's Eviolite, severely weakening its defenses.</p> <p><strong>Swords Dance Sweepers</strong>: Swords Dance sweepers such as Excadrill, Mega Scizor, and Bisharp also do not mind Porygon2's attacks and can set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Walls</strong>: Chansey and Ferrothorn do not mind Porygon2's attacks and status moves too much, and they can status it or set up entry hazards on it, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Keldeo, Conkeldurr, and Mega Lopunny can break through Porygon2 with their respective super effective STAB moves, but Keldeo and Mega Lopunny have to watch out for Thunder Wave and Toxic.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam deals heavy damage to Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Thundurus. Together with Thunderbolt, it forms the BoltBeam combo, which hits almost everything for neutral damage. Discharge is an option over Thunderbolt if the 30% chance to paralyze is desired. However, it can conflict with Toxic, which can be detrimental. Toxic ensures Porygon2 can beat defensive threats with recovery and deal passive damage to more offensive ones. Thunder Wave stops faster sweepers, but it makes Porygon2 helpless against bulky Pokemon such as Cresselia. It's worth noting that Foul Play is a useful move against physical powerhouses such as Mega Metagross and Mega Charizard X.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Trace is the preferred ability, allowing Porygon2 to copy many foes' useful abilities. It can copy Heatran's Flash Fire, Dragonite's Multiscale, Slowbro's Regenerator, and Landorus-T's Intimidate. Eviolite is a must, as it increases both Porygon2's Defense and Special Defense, greatly enhancing Porygon2's walling potential. With this EV spread, Porygon2 avoids the 2HKO from Life Orb Excadrill's Earthquake after sandstorm damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Porygon2 must be cautious of Pokemon with the move Knock Off because without Eviolite, it becomes a burden. Porygon2 has problems against certain Calm Mind sweepers, especially Clefable, so it is best to switch to a teammate against them to avoid being setup bait. When in doubt, use Recover, as Porygon2 must stay healthy to check the threats it needs to. Against offensive Pokemon without recovery, heal with Recover and wear them down slowly with either Ice Beam or Thunderbolt. Finally, switch out against Fighting-types, as their super effective STAB moves will break through Porygon2's Defense.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clerics such as Clefable and Sylveon make for great teammates because of their ability to heal Porygon2 from statuses and also for their resistance to Fighting-type moves. Entry hazards wear Porygon2 down quickly, so Zapdos and Empoleon also make for good teammates because of their ability to use Defog. Porygon2 also has problems against defensive teams, so having a stallbreaker such as Talonflame or Manaphy on its team is helpful.</p>"

  "Blissey": {
    "overview": "<p>Blissey is mostly outclassed in OU by Chansey, which is bulkier because it can run Eviolite to boost its defenses further. However, Blissey still has a niche in OU even with Landorus and Mega Gengar being banned in that it can reliably counter Manaphy with a Calm Mind set, something that Chansey is incapable of doing. Calm Mind also gives Blissey a better matchup against Gengar, which shuts down Chansey very easily. On top of this, Blissey can also run Leftovers, which can help mitigate passive damage from sand, entry hazards, and status conditions.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Blissey cannot do anything else that Chansey can't in OU anymore. Previously OU Pokemon such as Mega Gengar, Gothitelle, and Landorus are banned, meaning that there is no need for running Shed Shell Blissey or, in the latter's case, Ice Beam Blissey anymore.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Wallbreakers such as Azumarill, Garchomp, Landorus-T, Excadrill, Tyranitar, Terrakion, Bisharp, Mega Pinsir, and Weavile can all put a huge dent into Blissey or remove it easily; however, they fear super effective coverage from Blissey that can usually deal a lot of damage to them. This isn't the case for Tyranitar and Terrakion, though.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Terrakion, Keldeo, Breloom, Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Heracross can easily take on Blissey and remove it with their high-powered STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: If Blissey lacks Flamethrower, common Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Bisharp, Mega Metagross, and Ferrothorn are all capable of beating Blissey, since it cannot do anything back to them while they can set up on or pick off Blissey very easily. Heatran can also wear down Blissey with a combination of Taunt, Magma Storm, and Toxic, preventing Blissey from setting up with Calm Mind and dealing large amounts of chip damage each turn.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set allows Blissey to counter the likes of Manaphy and Gengar because it can set up with Calm Mind to prevent Manaphy from being able to break Blissey and to gain decent damage output against Gengar. Soft-Boiled is needed for reliable recovery for Blissey to consistently switch into those threats as well as other special attackers such as Thundurus, Serperior, and Mega Alakazam. Thunderbolt hits Manaphy for super effective damage and allows Blissey to almost always beat it one-on-one. Ice Beam has great neutral coverage when paired with Thunderbolt and deals super effective damage to Thundurus and Serperior. Flamethrower can also be used for its ability to hit Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Defense and Special Defense investment makes Blissey as bulky as possible, allowing it to blanket check nearly every single special attacker in the tier. A Bold nature boosts Blissey's low Defense stat further, and a Calm nature is unnecessary because of Calm Mind boosting Blissey's Special Defense anyway. Natural Cure allows Blissey to cure itself of status, which can be very useful if Blissey is hit by Toxic or burned by Scald. Leftovers provides passive recovery and helps deal with passive damage from the likes of sand, entry hazards, and status conditions.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If the opponent has Manaphy on the field, send Blissey in immediately and set up against it with Calm Mind, because if Manaphy is at +3 before Blissey switches in, Blissey cannot beat it. Blissey also works similarly to Chansey in that it can switch into nearly every special attacker in the tier with ease. Calm Mind can even allow Blissey to function as a sweeper when opposing physical attackers have been weakened or KOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Blissey fits best on stall teams that are very weak to the likes of Manaphy and Gengar, though it can still fit on balance teams reasonably well. Being weak to physical attacks, Blissey needs teammates to cover physically attacking threats, most often physical walls; this is especially relevant on stall teams, which need Pokemon that can deal with almost all offensive threats. Skarmory forms the well-known SkarmBliss core with Blissey, with Skarmory being the physical wall of the duo. While not as effective as it used to be due to a larger number of mixed attackers, it can still function very well with the right support. Hippowdon is a very solid physical wall too; it can take on many physical attackers, phaze foes with Whirlwind, and set up Stealth Rock to wear down the opposing team. Mega Sableye is also a great teammate for Blissey, as it takes on Fighting-types such as Mega Medicham and deters Terrakion and Keldeo from using Close Combat and Secret Sword, respectively.</p>"

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Tyranitar's combination of bulk, typing, and power allows it to check prominent threats such as Latios, Mega Charizard Y, Gengar, and Talonflame. In addition to this, its access to Sand Stream and Stealth Rock makes it a great support threat, as it assists Sand Rush Excadrill and Sand Force Mega Garchomp. Sand Stream itself boosts Tyranitar's Special Defense, meaning it can tank Latios's Draco Meteor with ease. Its great movepool allows it to lure in common switch-ins such as Mega Scizor and Landorus-T and KO them with a coverage move. Tyranitar can also take a role of a sweeper through its Mega Evolution, making it an unpredictable threat. However, while Tyranitar's typing allows it to check specific top-tier threats, Tyranitar is also easy to force out with the plethora of weaknesses it possesses. Even with a Choice Scarf, it is still slow, meaning Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny can easily force it out. Its lack of recovery also makes it easy to wear down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tyranitar can run a physically defensive set, but it does not have a good typing to utilize it. Tyranitar can run a more offensive mixed set with Crunch, Ice Beam, Fire Blast, and Stealth Rock with a Smooth Rock to provide offensive presence while also supporting Excadrill, but there is a noticeable decrease in bulk. Tyranitar can run a Dragon Dance set without Tyranitarite, but it misses a crucial Speed tier and there is a noticeable drop in power. It can work on hyper offensive teams and behind dual screens support because it can get multiple boosts when holding a Lum Berry. The set is rather inferior, however, especially with a huge decrease in bulk. Finally, Earthquake is an option on Choice sets to OHKO Heatran, but it has rather redundant coverage compared to Superpower.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Azumarill, Clefable, and Mega Altaria can take anything from Tyranitar and retaliate hard. The Choice Band set, however, can do massive damage to these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Skarmory can wall Tyranitar and can set up entry hazards or Swords Dance in Mega Scizor's case. Ferrothorn and Scizor cannot come in on Fire Punch, however.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Keldeo, Breloom, Terrakion, Mega Lopunny, Conkeldurr, and Mega Gallade can easily take a hit and OHKO back with their Fighting-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Skarmory, Garchomp, Chesnaught, Hippowdon, Gliscor, Landorus-T, Clefable, and Rotom-W can easily come in, set up entry hazards, and threaten Tyranitar back with status or their STAB moves. They must be careful of Choice Band and Dragon Dance sets, however, as these can KO or inflict a large amount of damage.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With a Choice Scarf, Tyranitar reaches a great 365 Speed, allowing it to Pursuit trap common threats such as Latios, Starmie, and Gengar. Stone Edge is Tyranitar's main STAB move, doing decent damage to Pokemon that don't resist it. It also allows Tyranitar to force out Mega Charizard Y, which can be a nuisance otherwise, and Tyranitar makes a fine check as long as Tyranitar is wary of Focus Blast. Superpower is a great complementary coverage move, hitting opposing Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, Heatran and particularly Keldeo, which resists Tyranitar's STAB moves. Superpower also allows Tyranitar to revenge kill Bisharp because Tyranitar resists Sucker Punch. Earthquake is an alternative over Superpower to avoid Attack and Defense drops and for better neutral coverage, but it is inferior in almost every other way. Crunch is used in the last slot, as it is a reliable Dark-type STAB move that hits bulky Psychic-types such as Mew, Celebi, Slowking, Mega Latias, and Slowbro. It can also be used to clean teams late-game.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed with a Jolly nature is mandatory to allow Tyranitar to do its job and hit the necessary Speed tier to Pursuit trap effectively. Sand Stream is used for a Special Defense boost, allowing Tyranitar to switch into Latios's Draco Meteor, and it removes other weather conditions such as Mega Charizard Y's sun and Politoed's rain.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As previously mentioned, this set should be used to trap Gengar, Latios, Latias, Starmie, and other Psychic-types Tyranitar forces out. Tyranitar also makes for a great check to Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Thundurus, so use Tyranitar for these threats as well. Finally, Tyranitar can be used as a revenge killer as well because it outspeeds everything up to Starmie and can force out a lot of relevant threats with its STAB moves and coverage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y appreciate Tyranitar's ability to remove Latios and Latias. Teammates that can take on Tyranitar's weaknesses are also great partners, such as Clefable, Celebi, and Gliscor. Stealth Rock support is recommended because it allows Tyranitar to net crucial KOs such as against Latias and Mega Gardevoir and complements Tyranitar's ability to force switches. Ferrothorn and Garchomp are examples of Stealth Rock setters. Excadrill and Mega Garchomp are good teammates due to Tyranitar activating their abilities, but sand turns are limited without a Smooth Rock. Volcanion can take on Water- and Grass-types that threaten Tyranitar such as Azumarill and Ferrothorn, while it appreciates Tyranitar removing Latios and Latias for it.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Choice Band turns Tyranitar into a lethal and very powerful wallbreaker. Stone Edge is the main STAB move and does massive damage to even Pokemon that resist it such as Keldeo. Crunch is the more accurate secondary STAB move and can break past bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro and Jirachi with ease. Superpower has great coverage alongside Stone Edge and Crunch, as it hits Ferrothorn, Heatran, and opposing Tyranitar. Fire Punch is an option to hit Mega Scizor, but it misses out on Heatran and Tyranitar. Pursuit rounds off the set by allowing Tyranitar to Pursuit trap Latios, Latias, and Talonflame. Unlike the Choice Scarf set, Choice Band Tyranitar can also trap bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro, Bronzong, and Cresselia due to the great increase in power. Ice Punch can also be used to hit Garchomp and Landorus-T. Finally, Aqua Tail is a decent option for dealing huge damage to Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Heatran with one moveslot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment allow Tyranitar to hit as hard as possible. 156 Speed EVs are used to outspeed minimum Speed Mandibuzz, but 76 Speed EVs can be used if Tyranitar only needs to outpace Skarmory. The rest of the EVs are thrown into HP to make Tyranitar as bulky as possible. Sand Stream is crucial to Tyranitar's role as a bulky wallbreaker and Pursuit trapper because the ability gives Tyranitar the Special Defense boost it needs to switch into Latios's Draco Meteor and other neutral and resisted special attacks. 176 Speed EVs can also be run to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Azumarill; meanwhile, fully investing in Speed allows Tyranitar to outspeed Jolly Azumarill as well as most variants of Rotom-W, Mega Venusaur, and Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used as a hit-and-run attacker and to weaken common switch-ins such as Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Due to the notable increase in power, Tyranitar can Pursuit trap bulkier Psychic-types such as Slowbro and Reuniclus. However, faster threats such as Gengar and Starmie can either inflict massive damage or KO Tyranitar. Choice Band Tyranitar's Pursuit also makes it a great trapping tool for Chansey, meaning Chansey can no longer switch into one of Choice Band Tyranitar's most common teammates, Mega Charizard Y. Otherwise, clicking Stone Edge to weaken threats is the preferable path to take early-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Charizard Y is an excellent teammate because Choice Band Tyranitar can do massive damage to specially defensive Talonflame and Chansey while eliminating Latios and Latias. Keldeo also fits this category because it can sweep much more easily with Latios and Latias removed. While sand turns are limited without Smooth Rock, Excadrill can be used to sweep after Tyranitar has weakened the opponent's team, especially the common switch-ins previously mentioned such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Rotom-W, all of which wall Sand Rush Excadrill. Other Pokemon that appreciate walls being broken make for great teammates, such as Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gallade. Mega Beedrill, Tornadus-T, and Mega Manectric get special mentions due to their ability to give Tyranitar free switches to wreck havoc with U-turn and Volt Switch. Volcanion appreciates support from Choice Band Tyranitar, as it is a more reliable answer to Mega Latias and still takes on non-Mega Latias and Latios reliably. In return, Volcanion can heavily pressure the Pokemon that can take on Choice Band Tyranitar such as Hippowdon and defensive Landorus-T.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set focuses on supporting its team even further with the utility of Stealth Rock. Tyranitar makes for a great user of the move due to its ability to threaten Defog users. Pursuit traps Latios and Latias, which allows Stealth Rock to stay on their side of the field for the remainder of the match. Stone Edge is a secondary STAB move that lets Tyranitar KO Zapdos, Mandibuzz, Kyurem-B, and Talonflame. Ice Beam KOes Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. Fire Blast is an option to OHKO Ferrothorn and Scizor, and Crunch can be used for a stronger hit on Slowbro and Celebi. Thunder Wave can also be used to cripple an offensive threat such as Mega Gardevoir. Roar can be used to prevent Pokemon such as Azumarill and Keldeo from setting up on Tyranitar. Finally, Earthquake is an option to allow Tyranitar the ability to check Heatran.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given HP and Defense EVs allow Tyranitar to survive an Earthquake from +1 Dragonite and KO back with Ice Beam, assuming Multiscale is not intact. They also allow Tyranitar to take two Dragon Claws from Mega Charizard X after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs are tossed into Special Defense to help Tyranitar take special attacks better, such as Latios's Draco Meteor and Heatran's Fire Blast. Chople Berry allows Tyranitar to survive Alakazam's and Gengar's Focus Blasts and retaliate with Pursuit. This is especially useful considering Tyranitar cannot outpace the former and requires a Choice Scarf to outspeed the latter. Smooth Rock can also be used to maximize the duration of sand and allows Tyranitar to support Excadrill more effectively. Tyranitar can also opt to run Shuca Berry, which can allow it to bait in Earthquake from the likes of Landorus-T and Garchomp and retaliate with Ice Beam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using Tyranitar to set up Stealth Rock on Pokemon it forces out such as Talonflame and Heatran is advised. Tyranitar makes for a great user of the move because it beats all the common Defog users. This set can also check threats such as Mega Charizard X and Dragonite in a pinch, so it is recommended to keep Tyranitar healthy if the opposing team has any of these Pokemon. Support Tyranitar can also lure in Ferrothorn and Landorus-T and KO them with Fire Blast and Ice Beam, respectively, making it easier for Excadrill to sweep. Tyranitar also walls Latios, Latias, and Swords Dance Talonflame, and it Pursuit traps the former two.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Excadrill is Tyranitar's best teammate because Tyranitar brings eight turns of sand for it to capitalize on. Celebi is a great partner for sand teams because it takes on Breloom, Azumarill, and Keldeo, which are three Pokemon that trouble sand teams. Talonflame can take bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur, which can annoy Excadrill. Due to Tyranitar's ability to remove Latios and Latias from the game, Keldeo is an amazing teammate because it has a much easier time when they have been removed. Mega Charizard Y also appreciates this, as it can freely wallbreak after they have been eliminated. Latios also makes for a great partner because it checks Keldeo, which can switch in on and wall Tyranitar.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>After one Dragon Dance, Mega Tyranitar turns into a deadly sweeping machine that can outspeed noticeable threats such as Weavile and Tornadus-T. Stone Edge is the main STAB move for hitting bulky Fairy-types such as Clefable and Mega Altaria and can be used if the extra power it provides is needed. Ice Punch covers Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T, which will try to end Mega Tyranitar's sweep. Superpower hits Steel- and Rock-types such as Bisharp, Ferrothorn, opposing Tyranitar, and Terrakion for super effective damage. However, Crunch and Fire Punch are alternatives to Ice Punch and Superpower. Crunch can hit bulky Psychic-types such as Celebi and, most importantly, Slowbro, which walls the coverage moves. Crunch also does not suffer accuracy issues; for example, a Stone Edge miss can be the difference between winning or losing the game. Fire Punch OHKOes Ferrothorn and Scizor in addition to hitting Skarmory more reliably. Rock Polish can be used as an alternative to Dragon Dance to outpace Mega Lopunny, Weavile, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, but then Mega Tyranitar misses a lot of power even with an Adamant nature.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature are needed to outspeed Weavile, Tornadus-T, and Alakazam after one Dragon Dance. Maximum Attack investment makes Mega Tyranitar very hard to wall after a boost as well. Tyranitarite is mandatory because it gives it a crucial boost to Tyranitar's Speed and, more importantly, its bulk. This means it can set up much more easily and survive priority attacks from Azumarill and Mega Scizor.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When grabbing a boost, make sure Mega Tyranitar takes little-to-no damage because it can survive priority moves such as Choice Band Azumarill's Aqua Jet and Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch if healthy. Removing faster attackers is a must before setting up. Excadrill, Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Mega Beedrill are examples of such threats because they can easily cut Mega Tyranitar's sweep short. Necessary walls, such as Rotom-W and Mega Slowbro, should also be weakened.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Tyranitar is walled by Pokemon based upon what coverage move it uses. If Superpower and Ice Punch are used, it is walled by Slowbro, so Celebi is a great teammate. Celebi also walls Breloom, which can OHKO Mega Tyranitar with Mach Punch. If Crunch and Fire Punch are chosen, Mega Tyranitar is walled by bulky Ground-types. Icy Wind Gengar is a great teammate for Mega Tyranitar because Mega Tyranitar can tank a Shadow Ball and lures in specially defensive Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T that think they can set up Stealth Rock. Pokemon that set up Stealth Rock are appreciated because they make it easier for Mega Tyranitar to sweep. Powerful wallbreakers are also welcome because they can defeat Pokemon that wall Mega Tyranitar. Swords Dance Talonflame makes for a good cleaner because it can sweep once Mega Tyranitar weakens its biggest counters: Landorus-T and Gliscor with Ice Punch and Rotom-W with Stone Edge. If running Crunch and Fire Punch, offensive or Choice Scarf Heatran makes for a great teammate because it can do massive damage to Keldeo on the switch and bring it to a point where it can no longer check Mega Tyranitar due to a +1 Stone Edge dealing 50%. Last but not least, Swords Dance Diggersby and Garchomp make for great teammates because they draw in and weaken or KO Mega Tyranitar's checks and counters such as Keldeo, Chesnaught, Slowbro, Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Hippowdon.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mega Tyranitar can leverage its great bulk to provide the team with entry hazard support. Crunch is the main STAB move, dealing reliable neutral damage to most targets such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Serperior. Superpower threatens Steel- and Fighting-types that come in expecting Stone Edge such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, Excadrill, and Keldeo. Stone Edge can be used instead for better neutral coverage against Fairy-types such as Clefable and to hit common metagame threats like Volcarona and Thundurus. Pursuit allows Mega Tyranitar to trap bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Cofagrigus, Cresselia, and Mega Latias. Alternatively, Taunt can be used to ensure Stealth Rock is not removed by Skarmory's Defog and to provide the team with stallbreaking ability.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>36 Speed EVs allow Mega Tyranitar to outspeed non-invested Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Seismitoad. 104 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature provide enough power to guarantee 2HKOs on Slowbro with Crunch and Ferrothorn with Superpower, as well as enough all-around power to make Mega Tyranitar a threat to many metagame threats like Thundurus, Rotom-W, and Zapdos. The investment in HP and Special Defense allows it to survive Focus Blast from Mega Alakazam, Thundurus, and Mega Charizard Y from full HP and in sand. It also gives Mega Tyranitar useful all-round bulk, allowing it to absorb special attacks from Pokemon like Zapdos, Heatran, and Volcarona.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With its comfortable bulk, Mega Tyranitar can use Stealth Rock against a variety of different targets. It also takes on opposing Excadrill, threatening and OHKOing it with Superpower. It is best used early- and mid-game, where it can set up Stealth Rock and open up defensive cores. As Mega Tyranitar provides sand for its usual partner, Excadrill, it can be important to time those sand turns correctly and keep Mega Tyranitar around as long as possible or needed. Thanks to its bulk, Mega Tyranitar can be used as a check to Mega Alakazam, Thundurus, and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The best partner for bulky support Mega Tyranitar is Sand Rush Excadrill, which benefits from the sand it provides and makes up for Mega Tyranitar's lack of Speed. In addition, Mega Tyranitar can check threats to Excadrill such as Mega Alakazam, Thundurus, and Mega Charizard Y, while Excadrill can deal with Clefable, which can be annoying to Mega Tyranitar. As it is very weak against Fighting-types like Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Medicham, good Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Clefable, Slowbro, and Reuniclus are good partners. Mega Tyranitar appreciates strong Ground-immune allies like Zapdos, Skarmory, and Tornadus-T, all of which can switch into Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill — key threats to Mega Tyranitar.</p>"

  "Celebi": {
    "overview": "<p>Well-rounded stats and rather unique typing allow Celebi to check prominent threats such as Keldeo, Azumarill, Mega Diancie, Mega Lopunny, Rotom-W, and Mega Slowbro. Celebi has a solid movepool with various means of team support, including moves such as Nasty Plot, Swords Dance, Stealth Rock, and Healing Wish. Celebi's ability, Natural Cure, is yet another means of team support, as it lets Celebi absorb status conditions for teammates. Unfortunately, Celebi is weak to common attacking types such as Bug, Fire, Flying, Ice, and Dark from Pokemon such as Scizor, Heatran, Tornadus-T, Kyurem-B, and Bisharp.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive set with moves such as Leaf Storm, Hidden Power Fire, Psychic, and Earth Power and either a Life Orb or Expert Belt can be used, but Celebi is much better suited to a defensive role. In a similar vein, a Choice Scarf set can be used to revenge kill boosted sweepers and fast offensive Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Lopunny and provides a fast Healing Wish as well as a bit of a surprise factor. Rest can be used to fully heal Celebi and works in tandem with Natural Cure, but this comes at the cost of vital momentum. Heal Bell can be helpful to remove status conditions from teammates, but Celebi already functions as a status absorber. Leech Seed can be used if you want more recovery than just Leftovers and can be great for whittling down offensive Pokemon that resist Celebi's STAB combination, such as Mega Metagross.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: If Celebi forgoes Hidden Power Fire or doesn't have multiple boosts up, it will have a tough time defeating Mega Scizor. It has high bulk, reliable recovery, and multiple moves that hit Celebi super effectively, including U-turn, which will always OHKO. Heracross and Mega Heracross resist Giga Drain and can easily OHKO Celebi but dislike being paralyzed by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Talonflame has priority on all of its Flying-type moves and usually carries three attacks that all hit Celebi for super effective damage. If you can predict a Roost and use Earth Power or predict it to switch in and hit it with Psychic, then you have a chance of beating it. Other than that, it's just a miserable matchup. Skarmory can set up entry hazards, phaze Celebi, Taunt it, or simply attack it if packing Brave Bird without the slightest concern if Celebi isn't carrying Hidden Power Fire. Skarmory takes next to no damage from any of its other moves and can simply Roost off any entry hazard or passive damage that it had racked up earlier on in the match. Tornadus-T can switch in freely on a Giga Drain and threatens Celebi with a powerful Hurricane, but it hates being hit with a Thunder Wave. Mega Pinsir 4x resists Giga Drain and deals massive damage with Aerilate-boosted Return. Hawlucha can use Celebi as setup fodder for Swords Dances, and it can avoid a potential Thunder Wave with Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as Gengar, Thundurus, and Tornadus-T prevent Celebi from using its support moves. In addition, all three of these Pokemon resist Giga Drain, but Gengar must be wary of the occasional Psychic, and Tornadus-T is severely crippled by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: If Celebi doesn't run Earth Power, it is brutally beaten by Heatran, as Lava Plume hits Celebi hard. Heatran completely counters Celebi if it is running Air Balloon and can even Roar away any stat boosts. Victini, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y resist Giga Drain and can use Celebi as setup fodder if it is lacking Thunder Wave or Perish Song.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Weavile take minimal damage from Giga Drain and can either Pursuit trap a slower Celebi or deal heavy damage with Knock Off or Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Gengar, Mega Venusaur, and Dragalge resist Giga Drain and can severely dent Celebi with their STAB moves. Unlike the others, Tentacruel takes neutral damage from Giga Drain but damages Celebi on its use with Liquid Ooze.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain is a mandatory STAB move to hit the Rock-, Ground-, and Water-types that Celebi checks such as Mega Diancie, Hippowdon, Rotom-W, and Keldeo. Recover replenishes Celebi's health and is essential for its survival throughout the battle when Giga Drain's recovery is not enough. Thunder Wave is a solid choice to cripple common switch-ins such as Mega Metagross, Tornadus-T, Mega Gardevoir, Latios, and both of Charizard's Mega Evolutions. In addition, Thunder Wave prevents Celebi from being setup fodder for some of the aforementioned Pokemon as well as offensive Dragon Dance Mega Altaria. Celebi is an excellent Stealth Rock setter due to its solid matchup versus many opposing Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin users, such as Hippowdon, Terrakion, Excadrill, and Starmie. Alternatively, Healing Wish can be used to revive weakened teammates, particularly setup sweepers. Lastly, Perish Song is an option to put a timer on bulky setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Clefable and Calm Mind Mega Slowbro. Note that Giga Drain and Recover are the only two mandatory moves on this set, and any combination of the other support moves in the last two slots can work perfectly fine depending on your team's needs.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and a Bold nature maximize Celebi's overall bulk, notably avoiding the 2HKO from Adamant Mega Lopunny's Return after Stealth Rock damage while outspeeding Adamant Bisharp to cripple it with Thunder Wave. A faster EV spread of 252 HP / 148 Def / 108 Spe can be used if Jolly Bisharp is an issue for your team. Using an EV spread of 252 HP / 144 Def / 96 SpD / 16 Spe gives Thundurus a significantly smaller chance to 2HKO Celebi with Life Orb-boosted Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock. Lastly, Leftovers is necessary for passive recovery throughout the match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set best functions as a glue and pivot for balanced and offensive teams. As such, Celebi should pivot into the Pokemon it checks, such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Diancie, Manaphy, Thundurus, and Keldeo. Use Recover to replenish Celebi's health when necessary and to stall out more Life Orb recoil on foes such as Thundurus. Use Thunder Wave to cripple Celebi's switch-ins for a teammate to finish them off later on. Thunder Wave can occasionally pack a bit of a surprise factor, so try not to reveal it too early on. Be sure to scout for coverage moves from Pokemon that Celebi can typically switch into, such as Hidden Power Bug or Icy Wind from Keldeo as well as Fire Blast from Slowbro.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-types such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Charizard partner well with Celebi, as they appreciate Celebi checking bulky Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types. Heatran sets itself apart from other Fire-types in that it also checks Flying-types such as Talonflame and Tornadus-T. Despite sharing a Flying weakness, Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Conkeldurr, and Mega Lopunny check Dark-types such as Bisharp, which are a major thorn in Celebi's side. Setup sweepers in general make for excellent teammates, as they greatly appreciate either Stealth Rock support to wear down their checks and counters or Healing Wish to give them another chance at sweeping. Good examples include Mega Houndoom, Volcarona, Azumarill, (Mega) Gyarados, and Dragonite.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot + 2 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot transforms Celebi into a decent threat capable of hitting hard while staying resilient thanks to Giga Drain's STAB and side effect. Recover only adds to Celebi's self-sustainability, giving it a consistent chunk of recovery in situations where Giga Drain's HP drain recovery isn't enough or reliable. Earth Power is preferred in the last slot for better Base Power and neutral two-move coverage; it is extremely effective against Heatran in particular, as well as other Steel- and Fire-type checks such as Bisharp, Mega Metagross, and Mega Charizard X. Hidden Power Fire, while much weaker, allows Celebi to eliminate Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory more efficiently while still maintaining coverage on other Steel-types except Heatran. Alternatively, Psychic can be used as a secondary STAB move, allowing Celebi to hit neutral targets even harder while gaining coverage against Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Talonflame (on the switch). However, it leaves Celebi vulnerable to many Steel-types as well as Dark-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread, along with a Bold nature, allows Celebi to outrun Jolly base 70 Speed Pokemon, Bisharp in particular, while giving it as much physical bulk as is allowed. With 252 HP / 148 Def, Celebi can reliably switch into and avoid being felled by common attacks; for example, it avoids the 2HKO from Azumarill's Knock Off and Play Rough, Jolly Mega Lopunny's Return, and Life Orb Excadrill's Iron Head, and it avoids the OHKO from Life Orb Jolly Bisharp's Knock Off and Landorus-T's U-turn. If Celebi runs Hidden Power Fire, then an alternate spread of 252 HP / 144 Def / 112 Spe should be used. Given this set's pivotal nature, Leftovers is essential for passive recovery. Alternative EV spreads with a more offensive nature can be used for an offensive-focused playstyle rather than a defensive one. For instance, a spread of 84 HP / 252 SpA / 172 Spe with a Modest nature lets Celebi outspeed Timid Heatran and provides maximum damage output. More Speed investment with any nature is optional but lessens Celebi's bulk and consequently the number of Pokemon it can reliably check.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While Nasty Plot may make this set seem fitted for sweeping, this set actually functions as a more aggressive and less passive method of utilizing Celebi's supportive traits. With two attacks in tow, Celebi gains better overall coverage, giving it leverage against its usual counters, such as Skarmory, Bisharp, Heatran, and (Mega) Scizor. Note that Celebi tends to lure these threats in, so with the appropriate coverage attack, it can easily eliminate or severely weaken them. Nasty Plot is used simply to augment Celebi's power, allowing it to be both a great defensive and offensive threat at once whenever required in the battle. As noted in the Set Details, Celebi is able to avoid KOs from a number of attacks, so it has plenty of opportunities to switch into such attacks, Recover the damage off, and set up. Keep in mind, however, that without investment, Celebi requires quite a few Nasty Plot boosts to be remotely threatening to several threats. For instance, Celebi can never OHKO bulkier variants of the aforementioned Steel-types without being at +2, while neutral targets such as Mega Gardevoir, Mega Gallade, Chansey, and Mew require a few more boosts for Celebi to safely 2HKO them or stall with Giga Drain. Additionally, if hard checks or counters such as Weavile, Charizard, or Talonflame are present, it is not recommended to set up Nasty Plot too early lest you instantly lose a good lure and pivot. It is also wise to scout for dangerous moves beforehand, including Hidden Power Bug from Keldeo, Life Orb-boosted Ice Beam from Starmie, and Encore from Mega Lopunny.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Generally speaking, this Celebi set is for teams that appreciate its supportive and pivoting capabilities with an offensive twist. This set tends to perform best on balanced teams; unlike more offensive teams, they tend to not mind Celebi's slower Speed and lack of good coverage, and they usually employ defensive Pokemon that synergize well with Celebi. Heatran is one such Pokemon that is capable of switching into common Bug-, Ice-, and Fire-type attacks while compensating for Celebi's coverage issues with Fire- and Ground-type attacks of its own. Water-types such as Politoed and Rotom-W handle Fire- and Ice-type attacks as well; the former is notable for removing Celebi's Fire-type weakness and supporting other Water-type sweepers (such as Kingdra and Keldeo) with Drizzle, while the latter can provide general utility with Will-O-Wisp and Volt Switch. Celebi's typing and offensive presence also allow it to function well on sandstorm teams, as it can easily switch into Fighting-, Water-, and Grass-type attacks typically aimed at typical sandstorm-based Pokemon and then retaliate with an attack or use Recover to restore health and pivot out. In turn, Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Hippowdon can cover Celebi's usual counters and weak points, especially its tendency to become dead weight or setup bait for the likes of Talonflame, Mega Charizard X and Y, Mega Altaria, and Latias. Moreover, if Celebi opts to run Hidden Power Fire, it can lure in and significantly weaken Skarmory and Ferrothorn, giving Excadrill much more breathing room to sweep without interruption. The luring aspect also benefits non-sandstorm-based attackers, such as Kingdra, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Altaria, Mega Gyarados, Clefable, and Mega Diancie, all of which require certain Steel-types to be weakened or eliminated before sweeping.</p>"

  "Sceptile": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Mega Sceptile may not seem very impressive. For starters, it has bad bulk and a typing that leaves it vulnerable to various priority users including Talonflame, Mamoswine, Weavile, Bisharp, and Mega Scizor. Furthermore, its base 145 Special Attack is relatively average considering Mega Sceptile has to go without a boosting item. Combine this with its lack of a powerful and reliable STAB move, and it's easy to see how most defensive teams don't struggle to handle it. However, Mega Sceptile's niche in OU comes from its ability to handle offensive teams. Its base 145 Speed makes it the fastest Dragon-type available, which is immensely useful in a tier with numerous threatening Dragon-types such as Latios, Latias, Garchomp, and Mega Charizard X, as Mega Sceptile is able to revenge kill all of them, barring Mega Altaria. Additionally, despite Mega Sceptile's relatively average Special Attack, it has access to Leaf Storm, which, thanks to its high Base Power, allows Mega Sceptile to revenge kill frailer threats such as Mega Lopunny. Its Grass STAB move of choice, along with its four times resistance to Water, allows Mega Sceptile to check all of the various bulky Water-type Pokemon in OU, including Slowbro, Manaphy, and Rotom-W. Finally, thanks to its access to Lightning Rod, Mega Sceptile is able to check most of the various Electric-types in OU, including Rotom-W, Mega Manectric, and Thundurus, the latter of which cannot even paralyze Mega Sceptile.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Sceptile boasts a Thunder Wave immunity, an impeccable base 145 Speed, a usable base 110 Attack, and a solid physical movepool. A Swords Dance set set with Leaf Blade, Low Kick / Earthquake, and Outrage / Dragon Claw is therefore plausible. However, it is much less effective than other Dragon-type sweepers, such as Mega Altaria, Mega Charizard X, and Haxorus, and should only be used for its surprise value. Any standard set Mega Sceptile can run leaves it walled by Fairies; Iron Tail can be a good solution. Likewise, almost all bulky Flying-types wall Mega Sceptile; Rock Slide can be used to remedy this problem. On the All-Out Attacker set, Mega Sceptile could use both Leaf Storm and Giga Drain. Leaf Storm is used in scenarios when the power is needed, and Giga Drain is used whenever a consistent STAB move is needed. Going this route forgoes having exceptional coverage against Steel-types and the utility provided by Protect, so it's only recommended if team support renders those unnecessary. If you desire a stronger Grass-type STAB move on the Substitute set, you can use Leaf Storm. It gains many OHKOs and 2HKOs that Giga Drain cannot achieve, such as on Landorus-T, Azumarill, and Mega Manectric. However, it is counterproductive alongside Substitute, as it can't recover HP and forces Mega Sceptile out after use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Mega Altaria is one of the best counters to Mega Sceptile, as it resists its Grass STAB moves, Focus Blast, and Hidden Power Fire; is is also immune to Dragon Pulse and takes very little damage from Earthquake. It can use Mega Sceptile as setup bait or just go for the OHKO with Return or Hyper Voice. Sylveon can tank a hit and subsequently OHKO with Hyper Voice, potentially through Mega Sceptile's Substitute. Mega Gardevoir can switch into any move bar Leaf Storm and OHKO with Hyper Voice even through a Substitute. Clefable with mixed bulk and a Calm nature avoids the 2HKO from all moves, can use Mega Sceptile as Stealth Rock fodder, and can recover constantly with Wish.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Mandibuzz avoids the 2HKO from Dragon Pulse, can Roost off any damage taken, and can threaten Mega Sceptile with Foul Play and use it as Defog fodder. Specially defensive Talonflame avoids the 2HKO from Dragon Pulse and can OHKO with Brave Bird. Assault Vest Tornadus-T easily avoids the 2HKO from Dragon Pulse and can OHKO with Hurricane. All Togekiss sets counter Mega Sceptile, but offensive sets are especially good for being able to use Mega Sceptile as Nasty Plot setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Select Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Klefki can easily switch in on Grass- and Dragon-type moves, take a Hidden Power Fire well, use Mega Sceptile as Spikes fodder, and 2HKO Mega Sceptile with Play Rough. It must, however, be wary of Earthquake. Bronzong takes very little from all of Mega Sceptile's attacks and can do decent damage with Gyro Ball. Specially defensive Jirachi walls Mega Sceptile that lack Earthquake, and Mega Scizor beats all sets lacking Hidden Power Fire. Specially defensive Doublade avoids the 2HKO from all of Mega Sceptile's moves. Mega Metagross can switch in on either of Mega Sceptile's STAB moves and KO in return with Meteor Mash.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Celebi can all switch on any move Mega Sceptile has repeatedly throughout a match and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey</strong>: Chansey and Blissey easily switch in on any move Mega Sceptile may possess.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Mega Sceptile's typing and bad bulk leave it vulnerable to priority. Talonflame can revenge kill with Brave Bird while Mamoswine and Weavile can both revenge kill it with Ice Shard. Choice Band Scizor can revenge kill it with Bullet Punch easily, and it can even check Mega Sceptile that lack Hidden Power Fire, as it resists Dragon and Grass. Mega Aerodactyl doesn't have priority, but it outspeeds Mega Sceptile and can revenge kill it with Aerial Ace, Ice Fang, or Stone Edge.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is a very powerful STAB move that lets Mega Sceptile OHKO and 2HKO many Pokemon that its other Grass-type moves cannot. For example, Leaf Storm has a decent chance to 2HKO physically defensive Magic Guard Clefable and OHKO Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Mega Manectric, and Assault Vest Azumarill after Stealth Rock. However, because Leaf Storm tends to force out Mega Sceptile after use because of the Special Attack drop it induces, Energy Ball can be used instead if you want a more consistent STAB move. In addition, Energy Ball does not allow for Pokemon that would otherwise be OHKOed by Leaf Storm, such as Mega Slowbro, to switch in on a Mega Sceptile at -2 Special Attack and abuse the situation. Both moves allow Mega Sceptile to check the bulky Water-types that it's supposed to, such as Rotom-W and Keldeo. Dragon Pulse is a great secondary STAB move that only Fairies are immune to and only Steel-types resist. Additionally, it hits Dragon-type Pokemon super effectively, which allows Mega Sceptile to effectively revenge kill Dragon-types such as Latias and Garchomp. Earthquake can be used to effectively handle Heatran, Klefki, Jirachi, Magnezone, and Tentacruel, and Hidden Power Fire can be used to cover Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. One small problem with Hidden Power Fire is that it forces Mega Sceptile to use a Speed IV of 30, which prevents it from Speed tying with Mega Beedrill.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Mega Sceptile's base 145 Speed, Lightning Rod ability, and Dragon typing are all integral to its success in OU, so Sceptile needs to be used with Sceptilite. Maximum Speed EVs with a Speed-boosting nature are used in order to get the most of Mega Sceptile's revenge killing ability; if Mega Sceptile is using a Special Attack-boosting nature it loses out on being able to revenge kill Mega Lopunny and Mega Manectric. Even though Hidden Power Fire drops Mega Sceptile's Speed IV to 30, maximum Speed investment should still be used so that you can at least Speed tie other Mega Sceptile with Hidden Power Fire. A Naive nature is chosen on sets with Earthquake so that you don't drop either of Mega Sceptile's offensive stats. If you're using only Focus Blast for coverage against Steel-types, a Timid nature should be used to prevent any unnecessary hindrance to Mega Sceptile's Special Defense. Maximum Special Attack investment is used to ensure it hits as hard as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Sceptile's base 120 Speed before Mega Evolving is great, but it is not always enough, as it doesn't allow Mega Sceptile to revenge kill Mega Lopunny or Mega Manectric. Thus, it's very important for Mega Sceptile to Mega Evolve early on when playing against offensive teams. One method by which you could bring in Mega Sceptile is with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn; this ensures Mega Sceptile gets in unscathed. After Sceptile Mega Evolves and acquires Lightning Rod, you can have it pivot in on Electric-type attacks from the likes of Thundurus, Mega Manectric, Raikou, and Rotom-W, receive a Special Attack boost, and subsequently begin to use extremely powerful attacks. Do beware that some of these Electric-types may carry Hidden Power Ice, or in Thundurus's case, Hidden Power Flying, which does severe damage to Mega Sceptile. Thanks to its 4x Water resistance, Mega Sceptile can also pivot in on various Water-types, such as Slowbro, Quagsire, Keldeo, and Alomomola, and annihilate them with a STAB Leaf Storm. Again, be aware that some of these Pokemon may carry Ice Beam or Icy Wind, both of which demolish Mega Sceptile. One perk of Mega Sceptile is that, unlike with other fast attackers, you don't have to be cautious when playing against a team with Thundurus, because Mega Sceptile cannot be stopped by Prankster Thunder Wave.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensively, Steel-types such as Klefki, Bronzong, and Jirachi as well as Poison-types such as Amoonguss, Dragalge, and Gengar can handle the Fairy-types that Mega Sceptile has trouble with, such as Clefable, Mega Altaria, Togekiss, and Sylveon. Togekiss especially gives Mega Sceptile a hard time, so checks to it, such as Rotom-W and Thundurus, make for good teammates. Mega Sceptile hates Talonflame's priority Brave Bird, so Talonflame switch-ins such as Heatran, Rhyperior, and Rotom-W are helpful. Heatran deserves a special mention for also being able to beat the bulky Grass-types, such as Amoonguss, that Mega Sceptile hates.</p> <p>Offensively, Mega Sceptile makes a good partner for Talonflame as well, as Mega Sceptile beats Rotom-W, Rhyperior, Tyranitar, and Heatran, all Pokemon that counter Talonflame. Gyarados hates Rotom-W for its ability to wall and OHKO it with Volt Switch. Mega Sceptile can OHKO Rotom-W for Gyarados, and if it switches in on a Volt Switch, it will get a Special Attack boost. In return, Gyarados with Bounce beats the bulky Grass-types that Mega Sceptile cannot, such as Amoonguss. As Mega Sceptile struggles greatly against stall, it appreciates powerful wallbreakers to break the walls that it cannot. Choice Specs Sylveon, Choice Specs Dragalge, Swords Dance Diggersby, and Swords Dance Crawdaunt can all help break defensive teams for Mega Sceptile.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute is a great move for using on a predicted switch to a potential check; it greatly eases prediction throughout the match. Substitute also allows Mega Sceptile to evade Bisharp and Mega Absol's Sucker Punch. Giga Drain works extremely well alongside Substitute, as it recovers Mega Sceptile's health and therefore allows it to make more Substitutes. It also hits Water-type Pokemon super effectively, which allows Mega Sceptile to check various Water-types such as Rotom-W. However, it is relatively weak against neutral targets. Dragon Pulse is a great secondary STAB move that hits most targets neutrally while also hitting Dragon-types super effectively, which allows Mega Sceptile to revenge all Dragon-types without a Speed boost bar Mega Altaria, such as Latios and Choice Band Dragonite. On the fourth and final slot you should use Focus Blast, as it hits all Steel-types at except for Doublade at least neutrally, unlike Earthquake, to which Skarmory is immune, and Hidden Power Fire, to which Heatran is immune. However, if you're willing to give up hitting Heatran and OHKOing Bisharp, Hidden Power Fire is viable because it is more accurate than Focus Blast and hits Scizor super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sceptile needs base 145 Speed, Lightning Rod, and its Dragon typing in order to be viable in OU, so it should be used with Sceptilite. Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment with a Timid nature should be used to hit as hard as possible without sacrificing any Speed. If Mega Sceptile were to use a Modest nature, for example, it wouldn't be able to revenge kill Mega Lopunny or Mega Manectric.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Sceptile is a fast Pokemon; even without having already gained the Speed boost that comes from Mega Evolving, it can revenge kill many Pokemon such as Keldeo, Terrakion, and Latios. However, this Speed is not always sufficient, as it doesn't allow Mega Sceptile to outspeed Mega Lopunny or Mega Manectric on the turn it Mega Evolves. Against teams with these Pokemon, or any Pokemon with a base Speed of 120 or higher, it is very important to Mega Evolve quickly, as not prioritizing Mega Evolving Sceptile could lead to, for example, Mega Lopunny demolishing your team. One method you can use to bring Sceptile in early and safely is a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. After Mega Evolving and acquiring Lightning Rod, Mega Sceptile can switch in on Electric-type attacks from the various Electric-type Pokemon in OU, including Thundurus, Mega Manectric, and Rotom-W, get a Special Attack boost, and subsequently either attack with a very powerful move or set up a Substitute. You should use Substitute whenever the situation calls for it; instead of having to predict whether or not the opponent will switch his or her Pokemon out, and thus possibly costing a game, just use Substitute. The worst that could happen is that Mega Sceptile wastes 25% of its HP; the potential benefit of being protected by a Substitute against a Pokemon that Mega Sceptile can 2HKO far outweighs this risk. When behind a Substitute, Mega Sceptile becomes very hard to deal with for offensive teams, as few Pokemon used on offensive teams can outspeed and/or avoid the 2HKO from Mega Sceptile. Emergency checks to Mega Sceptile, such as Weavile, do not work when Mega Sceptile is behind a Substitute, as Weavile's Ice Shard simply breaks the Substitute and Mega Sceptile can OHKO Weavile with Focus Blast.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fairies such as Clefable, Mega Altaria, Togekiss, and Sylveon all give Mega Sceptile trouble. As a result, it appreciates teammates that make quick work of Fairies, namely Steel-types such as Klefki, Bronzong, and Jirachi and Poison-types such as Amoonguss, Dragalge, and Gengar. Togekiss is especially notable as a nuisance for Sceptile, as it takes pitiful damage from all of Sceptile's moves. Rotom-W and Thundurus both check Togekiss, so they can make for good teammates for Mega Sceptile. Talonflame's priority Brave Bird can stop any Mega Sceptile not behind a Substitute, so Mega Sceptile appreciates the support of Talonflame switch-ins, such as Heatran, Rhyperior, and Rotom-W. Heatran is especially notable because it can beat the bulky Grass-types, such as Amoonguss, that give Mega Sceptile headaches.</p> <p>Talonflame is a great teammate for Mega Sceptile as well. It is stopped cold by various Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Rhyperior, Tyranitar, and Heatran, all four of which Mega Sceptile beats for Talonflame, while in return, Talonflame can break down the bulky Grass-types, such as Mega Venusaur, that Mega Sceptile hates dealing with. Gyarados also hates Rotom-W for its ability to wall and OHKO it with Volt Switch. Mega Sceptile OHKOes Rotom-W for Gyarados, and if Mega Sceptile switches in on a Volt Switch, it gets a Special Attack boost. In return, Gyarados beats the bulky Grass-types, such as Celebi, that Mega Sceptile cannot by using Bounce. As Mega Sceptile struggles greatly against stall, it enjoys having powerful wallbreakers as teammates to break the walls that it cannot. Choice Specs Sylveon, Choice Specs Dragalge, Swords Dance Diggersby, and Swords Dance Crawdaunt can all help break defensive teams for Mega Sceptile.</p>"

  "Swampert": {
    "overview": "<p>By virtue of its good typing that offers a crucial Electric immunity, Mega Swampert is a good Pokemon on rain teams as a Swift Swim user with an immunity to Thunder Wave. Provided that rain is up, Mega Swampert is a very strong and fast Pokemon, and it has a wide movepool with all the coverage options it needs. However, Mega Swampert does not get the Swift Swim boost the turn it Mega Evolves, which means it is still quite slow for a turn. It also fails to outspeed common Choice Scarf users such as Keldeo and Latios, even in the rain. Nevertheless, Mega Swampert is one of the most dangerous rain sweepers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Low Kick can be used over Superpower for more consistent power or if stat drops are unappealing to you. When Mega Swampert is on the verge of fainting, Endeavor can bring down the health of a Pokemon it cannot break for an offensive partner. Substitute circumvents status, eases prediction, and makes Mega Swampert harder to play around. Yawn can shut down some of Mega Swampert's checks, which also aids other rain sweepers. However, it does waste turns of rain which you could also use to attack with Mega Swampert or to switch to another Pokemon. Protect gives Mega Swampert a free turn to Mega Evolve but unfortunately also uses up a turn of rain. Mega Swampert can use Rain Dance in the fourth moveslot if you want another rain setter, or as an independent sweeper outside of dedicated rain teams. A bulkier set with Waterfall, Earthquake, Rest, Sleep Talk and an EV spread of 208 HP / 252 Atk / 48 Spe makes better use of Mega Swampert's respectable bulk and typing while still outspeeding almost the whole unboosted metagame under rain.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Celebi, and Chesnaught have little trouble switching into even an Ice Punch and can threaten Mega Swampert out with their super effective STAB moves or set up Nasty Plot or Spikes. Ferrothorn can also switch in against anything but a Superpower or Low Kick. Frailer ones such as Serperior and Mega Sceptile cannot switch in safely and lose if rain is up, but they can still defeat Mega Swampert outside the rain.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Although not all of them can switch in safely, bulky Water-types such as (Mega) Slowbro, Suicune, Rotom-W, Gyarados, Alomomola, Manaphy, and Gastrodon can threaten Mega Swampert with rain-boosted STAB Water-type attacks. Slowbro and Suicune can also set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Dedicated Physical Walls</strong>: Dedicated physical walls such as Skarmory, Cresselia, and Porygon2 can wall Mega Swampert despite lacking a type advantage. Power-Up Punch Mega Swampert can, however, break through them if it has not taken a lot of prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Opposing rain sweepers with higher Speed, such as Kingdra and Kabutops, can revenge kill Mega Swampert with rain-boosted STAB attacks. Very fast Choice Scarf users such as Keldeo and Latios can also outspeed Mega Swampert even in the rain and can deal heavy damage with Hydro Pump and Draco Meteor, respectively. Additionally, Mega Alakazam can Trace Swift Swim and revenge kill Mega Swampert with Psychic or Psyshock if Mega Swampert has been worn down enough.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Mega Swampert is immune to Thunder Wave but hates burn and poison because they make it easy to wall and easy to wear down, respectively. Other ways of paralyzing, such as Body Slam and Glare, also cripple Mega Swampert immensely.</p> <p><strong>Other Weather</strong>: Although no weather inducer can switch in safely against Mega Swampert, they can still remove the rain, taking Mega Swampert's Speed away.</p>",

      "Rain Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Waterfall hits incredibly hard, boosted by the rain and coming from a base 150 Attack. Earthquake is a solid secondary STAB attack and is also Mega Swampert's hardest-hitting attack outside of the rain. Ice Punch hits the Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Mega Swampert's STAB combination, most notably Celebi, Latios, Latias, and Dragonite. In the last moveslot there are two options. Power-Up Punch is not very useful as a coverage move but gives Mega Swampert a way to boost its Attack stat, allowing it to wallbreak more easily. However, Superpower hits Ferrothorn, Mega Gyarados, and Kyurem-B for relevant super effective damage and hits Rotom-W harder than Waterfall does outside of rain. If you cannot fit it somewhere else in your team, Stealth Rock can fill this moveslot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature makes Mega Swampert hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment allows Mega Swampert to outspeed the whole unboosted metagame, as well as some slower Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Kyurem-B, under the rain. If outspeeding those two Pokemon is less of a priority and you would rather have more bulk, an alternative EV spread of 104 HP / 252 Atk / 152 Spe, which still outspeeds Mega Sceptile and Mega Beedrill, can be used. Though Damp is rarely useful, it is preferred over Torrent as Swampert's ability before Mega Evolving; Torrent is completely useless because Swampert will always Mega Evolve before attacking, while Damp can at least stop an Explosion from the occasional Azelf or Mega Glalie.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Swampert can Mega Evolve for free against common Electric-types that cannot deal significant damage to Mega Swampert, such as Mega Manectric, Thundurus, and Raikou, or against Fire-types such as Victini and non-Solar Beam Heatran, as well as more passive Pokemon such as Klefki, Chansey, and non-Body Slam Jirachi. Try to avoid taking too much damage while Mega Evolving if you rely on Mega Swampert to take on a threat to your team. After the rain is up try to bring Mega Swampert in as soon as possible, as eight turns of rain is not a lot and you want to make the most of it. That does not mean that you should blindly switch it in, however, but instead use pivots or double switches. It can also be more helpful to get entry hazards up first or to send in another Swift Swim user at times. Burn and poison should always be avoided, because they make Mega Swampert easy to wall and easy to wear down, respectively. Late-game is when Mega Swampert works best, as it can clean up after its checks and counters are either gone or weakened. If rain is up, it is almost never a bad idea to click Waterfall, simply because of how strong it is.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Politoed is a mandatory teammate because it can provide rain for Mega Swampert without wasting a turn to do so. It can also create free turns for Mega Swampert with Encore or Perish Song, or by baiting in Electric-types that Mega Swampert can freely Mega Evolve against. Other rain setters such as Klefki, Tornadus-T, Thundurus, and Azelf are also good teammates despite needing a turn to set up rain. At least one other Swift Swim user such as Kabutops, Omastar, or Kingdra is necessary, because with only one Swift Swim user rain teams are not nearly as threatening. Kabutops and Omastar are the best choices, because they can take on Talonflame, which can set up against the obligatory Grass-type teammates rain teams carry. They also help with overwhelming Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Rotom-W, which are often relied on to take on rain offense, better than Kingdra does. Pokemon that can take on the Grass-types that check Mega Swampert, such as Tornadus-T, Talonflame, Thundurus, Latios, and Latias, are also good teammates. Like every Pokemon, Mega Swampert appreciates entry hazard support, because it helps to wear down Mega Swampert's checks and counters. It also helps Mega Swampert score some extra OHKOs and 2HKOs, such as the guaranteed 2HKO with Waterfall against standard Mandibuzz with Stealth Rock and rain up.</p>"

  "Breloom": {
    "overview": "<p>Breloom brings sleep and priority to the table, which is what sets it apart from other physical attackers. It possesses enormous utility in Spore, which is essentially a guaranteed cripple on any opponent that isn't Grass-type. Additionally, Technician, when coupled with an amazing Attack stat, lets Breloom utilize very strong Bullet Seeds and provides it with powerful priority in Mach Punch to deal with faster threats. Because of Mach Punch, Breloom stands out as one of the best offensive checks to Bisharp, Rotom-W, Excadrill, Mega Gyarados, and Tyranitar. However, a mediocre Speed stat leaves Breloom vulnerable most of the time against offensive teams, and as a result it is overreliant on Mach Punch on Technician sets. Furthermore, a mediocre STAB combination leaves it unable to threaten many Pokemon, such as Flying- and Poison-types. Its typing is not only average offensively, but it is also quite lacking defensively, as it also leaves Breloom weak to numerous offensive types such as Flying, Fire, and Ice. However, it does resist the EdgeQuake combination. Breloom is also relatively frail and can fall to even neutral hits.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Focus Sash allows Breloom to take a hit and retaliate, patching up its weakness to fast, offensive Pokemon while allowing it to lure in the likes of Talonflame and OHKO them with Rock Tomb. Substitute and Focus Punch allows Breloom to both avoid status and deal a large hit to a switch-in. Natural Gift plus Lansat Berry gives Breloom a one-time 100-Base Power Flying-type attack, allowing it to deal incredible damage to the likes of Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Celebi, which otherwise wall Breloom.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Celebi are immune to Breloom's Spore and resist Bullet Seed. Mega Venusaur is a particularly good counter, as it also resists Breloom's Fighting STAB move and can OHKO back with Sludge Bomb. Similarly, Celebi resists Breloom's Fighting STAB move and can use Breloom as setup fodder for Nasty Plot/Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Talonflame, Tornadus-T, and Togekiss are amongst the best checks to Breloom, as they resist both of its STAB types and can OHKO back due to Breloom's double weakness to Flying-type moves. However, they must watch out for Rock Tomb.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Latios, Mega Metagross, and Mega Gardevoir resist Breloom's Fighting STAB move and, in Latios's and Mega Metagross's cases, its Grass one as well. In return, they can retaliate with a super effective Psychic-type STAB move, which OHKOes Breloom.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is immune to Breloom's Fighting-type STAB moves and Facade. Gengar can OHKO back with Sludge Wave and is capable of crippling Breloom with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Certain Fire-types capable of shrugging off Mach Punch, such as Volcarona and Talonflame, are great checks to Breloom. In particular, Volcarona, especially if it carries a Lum Berry, is capable of either outright OHKOing Breloom with Fire Blast or using it as setup fodder with Quiver Dance. However, Rock Tomb OHKOes Volcarona on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Gengar, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss resist both of Breloom's STAB moves and can KO back with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Because of Breloom's lackluster Speed and defensive stats, faster Pokemon, especially ones that can shrug off Mach Punch easily, such as Alakazam, Latios, and Thundurus, are capable of outpacing and OHKOing Breloom.</p>",

      "Technician Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spore provides excellent utility in putting foes to sleep and boasts perfect accuracy. Mach Punch is priority that is boosted by Technician, allowing Breloom to deal with faster threats. Bullet Seed is a secondary STAB move, also taking advantage of Technician, and can break Focus Sash or Substitute. Swords Dance allows Breloom to function as a wallbreaker, and it is especially good in tandem with Mach Punch, as it improves Breloom's overall matchup against offense and balance. Focus Punch is an option to heavily damage Pokemon that switch into Breloom, such as Skarmory and Scizor. Rock Tomb hits Flying-types such as Talonflame, Tornadus-T, and Thundurus on the switch. It also hits various Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, Victini, and Volcarona.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs increase Breloom's offensive potential. A Jolly nature allows Breloom to Speed tie with opposing Bisharp and Breloom and the likes of Custap Berry Skarmory as well as Metagross and Modest Gardevoir prior to Mega Evolving; if you run Rock Tomb, it has the added benefit of allowing Breloom to outspeed base 115s such as Starmie and Raikou after the Speed drop. Life Orb powers up Breloom's attacks and makes Mach Punch especially formidable, letting it OHKO the likes of Excadrill and Mega Lopunny. If running Focus Punch, one should opt for an Adamant nature to deal more damage to Pokemon switching in. The utility of Mach Punch is to enable Breloom to deal with faster threats such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Mega Lopunny, and Excadrill, which would otherwise outspeed and deal great damage to Breloom.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Spore is Breloom's best move to use early on, as it cripples anything without a Grass typing or Overcoat. After putting a foe to sleep, Breloom should either use Swords Dance, which allows it to wallbreak effectively, or whittle down the foe with its STAB moves. Swords Dance can also be used after Breloom forces a switch thanks to the threat of Spore. After a Swords Dance, Mach Punch becomes incredibly powerful, allowing Breloom to KO faster foes such as Raikou, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Aerodactyl. Use Focus Punch to damage the likes of Jirachi, Scizor, and Skarmory upon switching in. Bring Breloom in on a resisted hit, such as Tyranitar's Crunch, a double switch, a U-turn or Volt Switch, or after a teammate has fainted, as Breloom has subpar bulk. Against slower setup sweepers such as Slowbro, Reuniclus, and Clefable Breloom should cripple them with a Spore so that it can proceed to either whittle them down with its STAB moves or switch into a teammate that can deal with them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pivots are great partners to Breloom, as they give it free switches. Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, and Raikou procure momentum with Volt Switch and check dangerous Flying-types such as Talonflame, Tornadus-T, and Gyarados. Rotom-W in particular offers a check to numerous Fire-types such as Victini, Infernape, and Talonflame and appreciates Breloom's ability to deal with the likes of Ferrothorn and Quagsire. Tyranitar, Scizor, and Bisharp are good teammates, as they can Pursuit trap Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Latios and Gengar. In addition, checks to Fire-types such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard X, and Volcarona are good partners. Examples include Azumarill and Mega Altaria, which also appreciate Breloom's ability to cripple foes via Spore and beat bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W. Flying-types such as Talonflame and Tornadus-T offer a check to bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Celebi. Tornadus-T also procures momentum with U-turn and appreciates Breloom's ability to deal with Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Rotom-W. Mega Charizard X in particular deals with Steel-, Fire-, and Grass-types such as Scizor, Volcarona, and Celebi that trouble Breloom and appreciates Breloom's ability to break past the likes of Heatran and Rotom-W.</p>"

      "Poison Heal Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance improves Breloom's matchup against defensive teams, allowing it to break through its usual checks, such as Celebi and Jirachi. Superpower is Breloom's strongest STAB move, allowing Breloom to hit its usual checks such as Skarmory for great amounts of damage. Drain Punch is an option, offering offensive presence and longevity all in one package, but it is significantly weaker than Superpower. Seed Bomb is Breloom's secondary STAB move, hitting the likes of Mew and Landorus-T for neutral damage. Facade hits a sky-high 140 Base Power when poisoned, allowing Breloom to break past Flying- and Poison-types such as Talonflame and Mega Venusaur on the switch, as well as other bulky Pokemon that resist Fighting / Grass coverage such as Celebi and Mega Altaria. Mach Punch patches up Breloom's low Speed stat and allows Breloom to deal with faster threats such as Excadrill, but it is quite weak without a Technician boost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>12 HP EVs maximize Poison Heal recovery. A Jolly nature in tandem with 252 Speed EVs allows Breloom to Speed tie with opposing Bisharp and Breloom and the likes of Custap Berry Skarmory as well as Metagross and Modest Gardevoir prior to Mega Evolving. The rest of the EVs are invested into Attack for more power. Toxic Orb activates Breloom's Poison Heal, giving it passive recovery and making it immune to other status. Specifically, the utility of having Poison Heal and Toxic Orb is to improve Breloom's matchup against defensive teams, making it capable of boosting in the face of status-reliant defensive Pokemon such as Mew.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Focus on activating Breloom's Toxic Orb as early as possible, as it makes Breloom effectively immune to status ailments. As this set excels against defensive teams, don't be afraid to bring Breloom in against passive, defensive, status-reliant Pokemon such as Alomomola, Suicune, and Mew. Use Swords Dance to boost Breloom's Attack against defensive Pokemon that cannot hurt it, and proceed to sweep. Predict Flying-type Pokemon switching in, such as Tornadus-T, and hit them with Facade, as Breloom cannot otherwise do anything to them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that fare well against offensive teams, such as Mega Manectric, Weavile, and Talonflame, are great partners for Breloom, as they patch up its weakness to faster threats such as Gengar and Tornadus-T. In particular, Mega Manectric offers crucial momentum with Volt Switch and checks powerful Flying-types such as Talonflame and Tornadus-T as well as Steel-types such as Skarmory and Scizor. Weavile checks Tornadus-T and various Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Latios and Gengar, and Talonflame deals with bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, while in turn Breloom deals with bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune, which trouble Talonflame. Checks to Flying-types, such as Tyranitar, are good candidates for teammates. Tyranitar also deals with Psychic-, Fire-, and Ghost-types such as Mega Metagross, Volcarona, and Gengar.</p>"

A Rock Polish sweeping set is also an option, although Aggron lacks wallbreaking power, making it a subpar setup sweeper at best.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Defensive Pokemon that don't particularly care about Mega Aggron's attacks are good counters. Hippowdon can effortlessly switch into Mega Aggron, wall it, and beat it with repeated uses of Earthquake. Skarmory and Ferrothorn can shrug off all of Mega Aggron's moves and freely set up entry hazards on it; however, Ferrothorn must watch out for Fire Punch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Mega Slowbro, and Manaphy can sponge just about anything Aggron throws at them and fish for a Scald burn or just slowly wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon that carry super effective moves, such as Mega Charizard Y with Fire Blast and Thundurus with Focus Blast, can easily take out Mega Aggron. Keldeo can boost with Calm Mind, and eventually break through it.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mega Aggron's bulk makes it a great user of Stealth Rock. Heavy Slam is Aggron's STAB move and packs quite a punch even without any Attack investment, thanks to how heavy Aggron is. Avalanche deals lots of damage to Pokemon that would otherwise wall this set, such as Landorus-T and Gliscor, and is used over Ice Punch because Aggron is slower than its targets anyways. Thunder Wave is one of Aggron's best support options; it slows down faster Pokemon, making them easier to check. Fire Punch allows Mega Aggron to counter Mega Scizor while also hitting Ferrothorn, but Earthquake can be used instead to hit Heatran and Excadrill. Rock Slide can be used to hit Flying-types such as Talonflame and Mega Pinsir. Dragon Tail is another option to phaze Pokemon that try to set up on Aggron, while also racking up residual damage if entry hazards are in play.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs and an Impish nature take advantage of Aggron's stellar Defense, while 240 Special Defense EVs are used to patch up its weaker Special Defense. The rest of the EVs are placed into Defense to reach a jump point. Investing more into Defense is also an option to better check physical attackers, but Aggron is already incredibly physically bulky. Investing some EVs into Attack can be done to hit harder, but Aggron's main purpose is to serve as a tank.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Evolving Aggron as soon as possible is crucial, as it is quite useless before that. This can be accomplished through a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, or by sending Aggron in after a teammate faints. Aggron is a great defensive tank, so use it to check dangerous physical attackers such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Metagross, and Mega Altaria. Aggron lacks reliable recovery, so try not to let it get worn down too much.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alomomola can pass massive Wishes to Mega Aggron which helps deal with its lack of recovery, while also being able to switch into Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X and threaten it with Toxic. Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Garchomp make for good partners, as they appreciate Mega Aggron's ability to handle most Fairy- and Dragon-types. Mega Aggron is effective at luring out and dealing with Gliscor and Landorus-T; Pokemon that appreciate these foes gone such as Terrakion are also good teammates. In general, Pokemon that can take on strong special attackers make for solid partners. Chansey is an excellent partner, being able to pass Wishes to keep Aggron healthy, ward off powerful special attackers, and cure status, which neuters Aggron.</p>"

  "Medicham": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to Pure Power, Medicham possesses the highest Attack stat in OU, alongside a wide movepool and powerful STAB attacks, which together allow it to deal serious damage to defensive teams. Although Medicham's frailty and subpar Speed hurt its effectiveness against offensive teams, it can still utilize powerful priority attacks in the form of Fake Out and Bullet Punch to wear down or knock out faster Pokemon. Despite Medicham's immense power, it faces competition with other Fighting-type Mega Evolutions, particularly Mega Lopunny, which has better coverage, Speed, and bulk. The high usage of Medicham's checks and counters, such as Mew, Slowbro, and Reuniclus, is not doing it any favors either. Despite all this, Medicham finds its place in the OU metagame as an immensely strong physical wallbreaker.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Medicham can run a set with Bulk Up to boost its already stellar Attack while also boosting its Defense, but Medicham's lack of bulk makes it hard to find setup opportunities, and typically it can make better use of the moveslot. If Medicham is running Bulk Up, Drain Punch is a viable option, increasing Medicham's overall longevity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Bulky Psychic-types, such as Slowbro, Mega Slowbro, and Mew, resist Medicham's STAB attacks and beat Medicham one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Although they cannot safely switch in, Flying-types, such as Tornadus-T, Mega Pinsir, and Talonflame, can revenge kill Medicham with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types, such as Cofagrigus, Gourgeist-XL, and Gengar, can stop Medicham from using High Jump Kick out of fear of losing 50% of its health.</p>",

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>High Jump Kick is Medicham's strongest attack, hitting most Pokemon that aren't immune to it for a sizable amount of damage. Ice Punch provides good neutral coverage alongside High Jump Kick, hitting Pokemon that resist Fighting like Tornadus-T, Latios, Latias, and Landorus-T for super effective damage. Fake Out grants Medicham a safe turn to Mega Evolve while also dealing chip damage and potentially picking off a weakened foe. Thunder Punch hits bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Mega Slowbro, and Gyarados super effectively. This is crucial given that Slowbro is one of the best Medicham switch-ins in OU. Zen Headbutt is also an option in the last slot as a secondary STAB attack that hits Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Clefable for big damage. Bullet Punch helps Medicham's matchup against more offensively oriented teams while having the added perk of being able to revenge kill Mega Diancie.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Pure Power is what makes Medicham unique, taking its Attack to unparalleled levels. An Adamant nature gives Medicham a chance to OHKO defensive Landorus-T after Stealth Rock damage with Ice Punch, as well as 2HKO Calm Clefable with High Jump Kick on the switch. The extra power is also nice to help clean up teams when using Fake Out late game. Alternatively, a Jolly nature lets Medicham Speed tie with opposing base positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon, such as Mega Gardevoir, Victini, and Mega Charizard Y. Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Medicham to be as fast and strong as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use High Jump Kick with caution, as if it fails to connect, Medicham will lose 50% of its HP; this means Medicham shouldn't use it when your opponent still has a Ghost-type on the field or if you're scouting for Protect on Pokemon such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. If Medicham is running Fake Out, it should typically use it on its first turn out to get off chip damage on the foe and Mega Evolve safely. Due to Medicham's poor bulk, getting it in on a free switch, such as after a slow Volt Switch or U-turn from a teammate, is crucial for its longevity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pivots, particularly Landorus-T and Rotom-W, make for good partners, as they provide an answer to Talonflame and give a slow U-turn and Volt Switch, respectively, to get Medicham in safely. Strong special wallbreakers, such as Hydreigon and Thundurus, can take advantage of Medicham's ability to defeat special walls, such as Chansey. Late-game cleaners, such as Weavile and Dragonite, appreciate Medicham's ability to break down walls. Pursuit trappers, such as Bisharp, Weavile, and Tyranitar, can trap Ghost-types that prevent Medicham from using High Jump Kick safely.</p>"

  "Manectric": {
    "overview": "<p>Manectric possesses a fantastic Speed tier after Mega Evolution, which makes it very threatening to offensive playstyles. Because of the offensive pressure it applies thanks to its great Electric / Ice / Fire coverage, it is an excellent momentum grabber with Volt Switch. It also has a decent defensive typing in mono-Electric, which, in tandem with Intimidate, allows it to tank priority moves such as Bullet Punch and Brave Bird. Unfortunately, its Speed tier isn't the best prior to Mega Evolution, preventing it from safely Mega Evolving against Keldeo, which it would normally check. It's also walled by Ground-types such as Hippowdon, which also prevent it from using Volt Switch freely, and it only has one set, so it is rather predictable. While Mega Manectric has decent power, it relies on super effective hits to defeat most walls, meaning that it will often be forced to bail out of them with Volt Switch. Overall, Mega Manectric's niche in the OU tier is a solid one, primarily as a threat to offense with a worse matchup against bulkier playstyles.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit Water / Ground types such as Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Mega Swampert, but it provides generally inferior coverage to Hidden Power Ice. Toxic can be run to cripple bulky Ground-types, but Mega Manectric has to sacrifice Thunderbolt or Volt Switch to do this.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types are the most annoying Pokemon to Mega Manectric because they prevent it from spamming Volt Switch. Hippowdon is a notorious Mega Manectric counter that avoids the 2HKO from Hidden Power Ice with a mixed spread. Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Seismitoad all wall Mega Manectric thanks to their typing giving them a neutrality to Hidden Power Ice. Rhyperior is also a hard check, as it also avoids the 2HKO from Hidden Power Ice, but its lack of reliable recovery can let Mega Manectric break past it if it is worn down as the match goes on.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Some Grass-types such as Celebi and Tangrowth are bulky enough to wall Mega Manectric despite its super effective coverage against them. Amoonguss is a check but cannot switch in against Flamethrower very well and has to beware of Overheat. Mega Venusaur is the truest counter of all of these because of Thick Fat.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types resist Mega Manectric's STAB and Fire-type coverage moves, so they are only susceptible to the weak Hidden Power Ice. Latios and Latias are very common checks to Mega Manectric, and both avoid the 2HKO from Hidden Power Ice and can then retaliate or heal up. By virtue of their typing, Mega Charizard X and Kyurem-B are hit neutrally by Hidden Power Ice and can heal off any damage easily with Roost. Mega Altaria is capable of running enough bulk to tank Hidden Power Ice as well, and defensive Dragon Dance sets can use Manectric as setup fodder. Other bulky Dragons like Dragalge, Goodra, and Mega Ampharos can take Hidden Power Ice without much problem and retaliate with powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raikou is a very prominent check to Mega Manectric, especially if it is holding an Assault Vest. It has a solid Special Defense stat and is hit neutrally at worst by any attack, while it can also use a slower Volt Switch to give the opponent a switch advantage. Rotom-H resists every move Manectric runs, but like Raikou, it is susceptible to being worn down by entry hazard damage throughout the match, making it only a check.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Mega Manectric is very fast, but there are several threats that can outspeed it. Weather sweepers like Excadrill, Mega Swampert, and Kingdra outspeed it under their respective weathers, while Mega Swampert also walls it completely. Mega Alakazam, Mega Sceptile, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Aerodactyl can hit Mega Manectric first with frighteningly strong STAB moves. Relevant Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Latios, Kyurem-B, and Keldeo can also outspeed Mega Manectric, and most can OHKO it, although Keldeo may need a bit of prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: There are many bulky Pokemon capable of switching into Mega Manectric without taking too much damage. Chansey in particular takes basically no damage from Manectric, while Clefable, Mew, and Sylveon are also capable of switching in and healing up. Heatran and Tyranitar can tank any move from Manectric fairly easily and retaliate. Tyranitar in particular can be annoying for its ability to hit Manectric with Pursuit if it chooses to bail out with Volt Switch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch allows Mega Manectric to pivot out of unfavorable matchups and ease prediction when the foe also switches out. Thunderbolt is the preferred STAB move when going for maximum power and KOs. A Fire-type coverage move is used to hit bulky Steel-types as well as hit Grass-types harder than Hidden Power Ice; Flamethrower is more consistent than Overheat because it does not miss and does not induce a Special Attack drop, but Overheat is more powerful, netting the OHKO on Mega Metagross and Excadrill, as well as guaranteeing the OHKO on Ferrothorn. Hidden Power Ice completes the BoltBeam coverage, providing a way to hit Ground- and Dragon-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature make Mega Manectric as fast as possible, outspeeding threats such as Tornadus-T and Weavile while Speed tying Jolly Mega Lopunny. Maximum Special Attack is used to hit as hard as possible. Lightning Rod allows Manectric to get a Special Attack boost in its pre-Mega forme if it is hit by an Electric-type move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is generally advisable to Mega Evolve Manectric early in the match so that it can utilize its excellent Speed and apply pressure from the get-go. Volt Switch is the move of choice early- and mid-game to soften up the opponent's team and provide yourself with the switch advantage. One should try to identify potential Choice Scarf users on the opposing team and consider hard switching Manectric if faced with one such as Landorus-T. If the opposing team is carrying a significant number of priority moves, limit the number of times Mega Manectric switches into entry hazards so that it can survive these moves late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Manectric really appreciates entry hazard support, so Pokemon like Garchomp, Heatran, and Landorus-T all make for fine partners to set up Stealth Rock and tank attacks directed towards it. In a similar vein, Klefki, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn can stack Spikes, which can be deadly in tandem with Volt Switch. Water-, Grass-, and Ice-types are very beneficial to Mega Manectric for their ability to defeat Ground-types that wall it. Keldeo in particular is also able to pressure blanket special walls such as Chansey thanks to Secret Sword, and it also checks Bisharp, which gets a Defiant boost from Mega Manectric's Intimidate. Azumarill is also a great partner because it checks Mega Charizard X, which takes very little damage from Mega Manectric's attacks, while also being an answer to weather-based offense, which Mega Manectric struggles against. Breloom also checks weather-based offense and can use Mach Punch to clean up teams that Mega Manectric has weakened. Many bulky Psychic-types such as Celebi, Latias, and Mew can wall Mega Manectric, so it really enjoys Pursuit support from the likes of Tyranitar, Weavile, Bisharp, and Assault Vest Metagross. Weavile especially synergizes well with Mega Manectric for also defeating Ground- and Grass-types that wall it, while Mega Manectric defeats some of Weavile's best checks in bulky Steel-types such as Mega Scizor. Gengar is also a nice partner for generally pressuring defensive Pokemon that can take hits from Mega Manectric, and Mega Manectric can check Tornadus-T, which is a major annoyance to Gengar. Crawdaunt is a solid partner for many of the same reasons as Azumarill and Weavile. Talonflame can work well with Mega Manectric by overloading similar checks such as Hippowdon and hard checking Clefable, and Mega Manectric can threaten bulky Water-types such as Slowbro in return. Mega Manectric can fit onto rain offense with a powerful Thunder and the ability to pivot to reset weather and threaten bulky Water-types, which are typically annoying for rain. Tornadus-T is also a solid partner, as it forms a VoltTurn core with Mega Manectric and threatens Grass-types, which check or wall Mega Manectric.</p>"

  "Sharpedo": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Sharpedo is the epitome of a late-game cleaner thanks to a great pre-Mega ability in Speed Boost, access to a powerful STAB Crunch that is bolstered by Strong Jaw, and good coverage moves in Hydro Pump, Ice Fang, and Poison Jab. In addition, Mega Sharpedo has quite a favorable matchup against defensive and offensive archetypes alike.</p> <p>However, Mega Sharpedo is quite frail, and as a result it is susceptible to priority. Reliance on Protect for procuring Speed boosts makes Mega Sharpedo somewhat predictable. Lastly, Mega Sharpedo requires quite a bit of team support to remove certain Pokemon such as Keldeo and Chesnaught.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>All-out attacker Mega Sharpedo makes for a fantastic wallbreaker, owing to the fact that it can run alternate coverage options such as Hidden Power Fire. Zen Headbutt is an option to hit Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, and Breloom. Waterfall allows Mega Sharpedo to hit specially defensive Gliscor and has perfect accuracy unlike Hydro Pump. Scald is a decent option to have the chance to burn switch-ins such as Keldeo and Mega Altaria and cripple them. Aqua Jet can be used to hit weakened Talonflame and Thundurus and pick off Mega Lopunny. Poison Fang can be used instead of Poison Jab if the higher chance to inflict poison is more appealing, but it will consequently have a chance of missing out on 2HKOing Clefable and Mega Altaria. Taunt provides good all-around utility, preventing Pokemon such as Skarmory, Scizor, Mandibuzz from replenishing health, helping Sharpedo avoid being inflicted by status from the likes of Slowbro, and improving Mega Sharpedo's matchup against defensive teams. Destiny Bond is an option to bring down a foe before fainting. Double-Edge can be used to 2HKO Keldeo, but Mega Sharpedo will thus miss the ability to hit Fairy-types and Chesnaught. Substitute allows Mega Sharpedo to evade status and gain more Speed boosts. Hidden Power Fire lets Mega Sharpedo KO Steel-types such as Scizor and Ferrothorn, while Hidden Power Grass nets a super effective hit on Water-types such as Azumarill, Rotom-W, and Quagsire.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Priority users such as Breloom, Conkeldurr, Dragonite, and Talonflame can all deal massive damage to Mega Sharpedo with their respective priority moves. Thundurus and Klefki are also problematic, as they have access to a combination of Prankster and Thunder Wave to cripple Mega Sharpedo immensely.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types can usually come in safely against Mega Sharpedo's attacks: Mega Venusaur OHKOes Mega Sharpedo with Giga Drain and takes minimal damage from Crunch; Ferrothorn takes very little from Crunch, deals massive damage with Power Whip, and uses Mega Sharpedo as fodder for Spikes or Stealth Rock; and Chesnaught completely walls Mega Sharpedo, as Poison Jab fails to 2HKO, and in turn can deal heavy damage with Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Mega Gyarados, which resists both of Mega Sharpedo's STAB move and takes minimal damage from Poison Jab and can in turn use Mega Sharpedo as setup fodder for Dragon Dance; Alomomola, which can outstall Mega Sharpedo with a combination of Wish and Protect and cripple it with burns induced by Scald; and Keldeo, which also resists both of Mega Sharpedo's STAB moves and OHKOes back with Secret Sword, are great checks to Mega Sharpedo.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Because Mega Sharpedo relies on KOing everything late-game, healthy attackers that are not OHKOed by any of Mega Sharpedo's moves, such as Keldeo and Azumarill, will suffice for checking it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Cleaner": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Protect is necessary for Sharpedo, as it allows Sharpedo to get a guaranteed Speed boost prior to Mega Evolving and can be used to scout the moves of the foe. Crunch is bolstered by Strong Jaw and hits a variety of Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Latios and Gengar for super effective damage while retaining neutral coverage on the likes of Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Hydro Pump covers Ground- and Rock-types, such as Hippowdon, Gliscor, Excadrill, Landorus-T, Mamoswine, Tyranitar, Terrakion, and Mega Diancie, and 2HKOes physically defensive Skarmory. Hydro Pump also nets a neutral hit on other threats that resist Crunch, such as Mega Lopunny, Klefki, and Bisharp. Ice Fang covers a variety of Pokemon such as Mega Altaria, Chesnaught, Dragonite, Hydreigon, Whimsicott, Breloom, and Garchomp. Poison Jab is a great move to hit Fairy-types such as Azumarill, Mega Altaria, and Clefable, as well as Grass-types that resist Dark such as Chesnaught and Breloom. The 30% chance to poison is also nifty for racking up residual damage on Pokemon switching in, such as Keldeo.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Mega Sharpedo to Speed tie with Choice Scarf Landorus-T at +1 Speed. 32 Special Attack EVs let Mega Sharpedo net a 2HKO on physically defensive Skarmory after Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are invested into Attack to bolster Mega Sharpedo's Crunch and Ice Fang or Poison Jab. Speed Boost is the preferred ability before Mega Evolving to let Sharpedo procure Speed boosts, turning it into a terrifying cleaner. The Special Attack investment can be buffed up to 92 EVs to let Mega Sharpedo net a guaranteed OHKO on defensive Landorus-T after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Sharpedo excels against weakened offensive and balanced teams. Against them, saving Mega Sharpedo as a late-game cleaner is vital. Put as many dents in the opposition's team with teammates, and clean up the remains with Mega Sharpedo once their team has been put in Crunch or any of its coverage move's KO range. This process should be done before Mega Evolving, using Protect to rack up Speed boosts, and then Mega Evolving when the opposition's team can all be outsped. Remove Thundurus and Klefki as soon as possible, as they can cripple Mega Sharpedo with priority Thunder Wave, stopping its sweep. Crunch is Mega Sharpedo's most-used move, as it boasts high power and perfect accuracy.</p> <p>Against defensive teams, Mega Evolving right away is essential to break huge holes in the opponent's defense, unless the Speed boosts from the non-Mega Sharpedo is necessary. Mega Sharpedo can also be used as a supportive wallbreaker for another teammate, for example using Crunch against a Rotom-W switching in, weakening it to the point where it cannot check one of Mega Sharpedo's teammates, such as Talonflame. Look carefully at the layout of the opponent's team, and decide whether Mega Sharpedo should be best played as a supportive wallbreaker or a cleaner. However, Mega Sharpedo has a few problems against these defensive archetypes, so you should pack a secondary win condition for these teams such as Alakazam. If a sweep is possible and multiple Speed boosts need to be procured, bring Sharpedo in on a Pokemon it forces out, such as Gliscor or Hippowdon. Don't Mega Evolve until Intimidate users such as Gyarados have been removed so that Mega Sharpedo can sweep without trouble.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Sharpedo prefers fast, destructive wallbreakers as partners because it fits on offensive teams and needs foes worn down prior to sweeping. Gengar, Talonflame, and Thundurus fit in this category; in particular, Thundurus offers paralysis support and a check to Talonflame and various Fighting-types such as Breloom and Keldeo. Magnezone is a good partner for trapping Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and gives Mega Sharpedo momentum and opportunities to switch in with Volt Switch. Talonflame is a great partner as well, as it can check problematic Fighting- and Steel-types, such as Keldeo and Conkeldurr and Scizor and Ferrothorn, respectively.</p> <p>Physically defensive Garchomp is a great partner for Mega Sharpedo, as the combination of Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin, the phazing with Dragon Tail, and the Stealth Rock it sets wear down attackers such as Mega Lopunny so that Mega Sharpedo has an easier time cleaning up. Similarly, Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes punish switches and wear down the opposition fast, making Mega Sharpedo's job all the more easy; Scolipede makes for an excellent lead, as it can utilize both Spikes and Toxic Spikes and has Endeavor to weaken the foe, especially priority users such as Talonflame. Similar to Scolipede, Skarmory and Klefki can both utilize Spikes to help punish switches, and Klefki has an added bonus of being able to set Reflect and Light Screen to somewhat patch up Mega Sharpedo's lack of bulk and use Thunder Wave to paralyze faster foes such as Mega Lopunny. Celebi checks Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Breloom. Fellow Water-types such as Gyarados, Feraligatr, and Azumarill are also good teammates, as they have good offensive synergy and can weaken Steel-types such as Scizor and Ferrothorn as well as Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Tangrowth for Mega Sharpedo.</p>"

  "Altaria": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Altaria is an impressive anti-metagame threat, boasting a gigantic number of resistances and defensive utility to go along with its already great bulk, thus allowing it to counter and force out a large number of Pokemon in OU. It is no slouch offensively either; in fact, with Pixilate and Fairy STAB, it is deceptively powerful, moreso than established powerhouses such as Azumarill, Mega Gyarados, Mega Gallade, and even Kyurem-B. This is further amplified by Altaria's access to Dragon Dance, as well as a wide physical, special, and supportive movepool, giving it a degree of flexibility and unpredictability.</p> <p>Mega Altaria's only real flaw is its base 80 Speed, which is quite below average by ORAS OU standards, making it somewhat easy to revenge kill even when boosted. It is also occasionally plagued by four-moveslot syndrome; if it lacks a certain move, it can easily be taken advantage of by common checks and counters. Finally, by virtue of being a Mega Evolution, it cannot hold useful items such as Lum Berry, Pixie Plate, Life Orb, and Leftovers, which downplays its overall offense and defense quite a bit. With all that said, don't be fooled into thinking that those cons hold Mega Altaria back in a significant way; it's a downright ruthless Pokemon to face off against.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Without the Altarianite, Altaria is simply not viable or threatening at all, as it misses out on multiple benefits. In other words, don't even think about using normal Altaria in OU. Mega Altaria can utilize a physically based mixed attacking set without Dragon Dance, similar to the special attacking set above. Like said set, it can potentially lure in checks and counters to other sets as well.</p> <p>Haze is a more immediate alternative to Roar and Perish Song, differentiating itself in the fact that it can counter stat-boosting Pokemon, such as Suicune and Mega Slowbro, without forcing Altaria to move last and take a boosted hit. However, its usability ends there because Roar and Perish Song have overall better properties. Likewise, Cotton Guard is undeniably a fun and somewhat useful move, allowing Altaria to win against its usual physical checks such as Scizor, Mega Metagross, Azumarill, Mega Lopunny, and Landorus-T. Unfortunately, it usually wastes a moveslot and doesn't solve Mega Altaria's vulnerability to status conditions and powerful special attacks.</p> <p>Body Slam is a good physical attack that has a high chance of paralyzing foes while having a decent Base Power that is boosted by Pixilate. While it's certainly not a bad move by itself on defensive sets, it has competition with the more powerful Return. Likewise, Facade benefits from any status conditions Altaria might have taken and is absolutely usable on any set that utilizes Return. However, it is overall very situational, not to mention weak and almost useless if the opponent doesn't happen to have a status user at all. Draco Meteor may sound appealing due to its whopping 130 Base Power and Dragon-type coverage (useful against Mega Charizard X and Talonflame in particular), but it is redundant coverage-wise and not much stronger than Hyper Voice, and its side effect makes it an overall unappealing and inconsistent option. Dragon Pulse is more consistent but likewise has redundancy issues. Ice Beam is decent on special attacking sets, as it can OHKO Landorus-T, and specially defensive Gliscor. This particular aspect is important, as KOing these threats immediately lessens the risk of taking heavy damage from Earthquake or, in the case of Gliscor, being stalled out by Toxic or Roost, which it can do if Altaria only has Hyper Voice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Ferrothorn, Heatran, Scizor, and Skarmory can counter Altaria depending on its lack of Fire or Ground coverage. (Mega) Scizor, especially physically defensive versions, is an exceptional counter if Altaria is lacking Fire Blast. In addition to tanking Fairy-type attacks and Earthquake, it can deal heavy damage with Bullet Punch. Mega Metagross typically revenge kills every set with Meteor Mash or Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Poison-type Pokemon and Coverage Moves</strong>: Mega Venusaur is quite possibly the best Altaria counter to exist, as it is never 2HKOed by any of Mega Altaria's commonly used special or physical attacks (even at +2), and can put its efforts to mere waste by recovering with Synthesis or OHKOing it with Sludge Bomb. Amoonguss can perform such similar functions, but struggles against sets running invested Fire Blast or Substitute. Mega Beedrill and Gengar can check unboosted Altaria effectively with their blazing Speed and strong Poison-type attacks; both are especially noticeable for punishing switches with U-turn and Substitute, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types do well defensively against sets lacking Ground or Dragon coverage, but most can't do much in return, so only a select few are notable. Talonflame is resistant or immune to Altaria's most commonly used attacks and can do fatal damage with Brave Bird or cripple Altaria with Will-O-Wisp. Mega Charizard Y sports the same resistances and immunities as Talonflame and can do huge damage to non-defensive sets with its sun-boosted Fire Blast. Heatran sports a quadruple resistance to Fairy-type attacks as well as a slew of disruptive attacks, such as Toxic, Roar, Taunt, and burning attacks, giving Altaria nightmares for ages. Defensive variants, however, tend to struggle against Altaria sets with Substitute or Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fairy-types</strong>: Altaria typically can't do much damage to most bulky Fairy-type Pokemon without accumulating a Dragon Dance boost, and even then some can tank one hit and hit back super effectively with STAB attacks. A special mention goes to Unaware Clefable for ignoring Attack boosts, although it can be 2HKOed by a maxed-out Return or Hyper Voice. Mega Gardevoir is a good check as long as it avoids Dragon Dance-boosted Altaria—or pretty much any physical attack for that matter.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Though not many Choice Scarf users can cleanly OHKO Mega Altaria, common users such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, Icy Wind Keldeo, and Heatran can do enough damage to cripple or KO it after some prior damage. In sandstorm, Sand Rush Excadrill outruns neutral-natured Altaria even at +2 and OHKOes it with Iron Head. Priority users, especially those with Bullet Punch and Ice Shard, also threaten to cut Dragon Dance sweeps short, though most cannot OHKO Altaria due to its bulk. Altaria can also typically handle most priority users by itself. To this extent, Klefki and Thundurus pose threats with their priority Thunder Wave, though this strategy is mostly rendered ineffective by sets with Heal Bell.</p>",

      "Offensive Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance turns Mega Altaria into a deadly sweeper. Substitute allows it to turn its checks into setup fodder by ignoring burn or Toxic attempts from the likes of Cofagrigus, Rotom-W, and Slowbro. Frustration allows Mega Altaria to threaten Pokemon like Keldeo, Latios, Latias, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny super effectively. Finally, Earthquake busts through Fire- and Steel-types like Volcanion, Heatran, and Excadrill.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread ensures that Cofagrigus's Hex does not break Mega Altaria's Substitute in one hit while also letting it outspeed Weavile at +1. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Attack alongside an Adamant nature so that it can still hit as hard as possible. Natural Cure is Altaria's preferred pre-Mega ability, allowing it to act as a status sponge before Mega Evolving and preventing it from being crippled by status before setting up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Altaria fills the role of a primary late-game cleaner while also additionally being able to function as an early-game wallbreaker. Mega Altaria should conserve as much HP as possible so that its chance at sweeping isn't ruined. Therefore, the best scenarios to bring it in are aggressive switches and after a teammate has fainted. It should not attempt a sweep if checks and counters such as Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur are still active; therefore, it is best to ensure they are removed or weakened before Mega Altaria can attempt to sweep late-game. If it is used early-game, it should be used to wallbreak for its teammates, as not many Pokemon aside from Mega Lopunny, Mega Alakazam, and Choice Scarf users such as Excadrill and Volcanion can outrun Mega Altaria at +1. However, Mega Altaria should be mindful of the presence of certain checks such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Talonflame, as they can take Frustration and Earthquake very easily and threaten it out with their STAB moves. The best setup opportunities for Mega Altaria are safe switch-ins and against defensive Pokemon that cannot break its Substitute easily such as Cofagrigus and Rotom-W. When Altaria should Mega Evolve depends on the current situation; delaying Mega Evolution has benefits such as keeping Natural Cure to switch into status from the likes of Rotom-W, Lava Plume Heatran, and Glare Serperior and setting up against Ground-types such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T locked into Earthquake. Unless Altaria needs to make use of Nature Cure and its Ground immunity, it should Mega Evolve immediately. Keep in mind that regular Altaria is vulnerable to Stealth Rock and is weak to Dragon-type moves before Mega Evolving. Once Altaria Mega Evolves, it removes the Stealth Rock weakness and greatly augments its typing, letting it set up against the likes of Latios and Dragonite.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set shines best on hyper offense teams. As a result, a dedicated lead such as Excadrill, Taunt Mew, Imprison Landorus-T, or Rocky Helmet Aerodactyl is helpful, as it can prevent entry hazards from being set up on the opening turn while setting up crucial hazards of their own. Serperior is a fantastic partner for Mega Altaria, providing great utility through dual screens, while preventing any setup attempts or hazards with Taunt or providing Glare support to cripple faster threats such as Mega Alakazam. Additionally, it can run Hidden Power Fire or Rock to lure one of Mega Altaria's checks such as Ferrothorn or Talonflame. Mega Altaria appreciates partners such as Volcarona, Manaphy, and Bisharp, as they can overwhelm each other's checks to sweep later in the game. Volcarona is a fearsome sweeper with great coverage, getting relatively free entries against Pokemon like Mega Scizor, which allows easy setup opportunities while threatening Flame Body burns. Manaphy can set up with Tail Glow, letting it break past bulkier Pokemon that Mega Altaria struggles to deal with such as Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur with Psychic and Quagsire with Energy Ball, while Mega Altaria handles the likes of Serperior, which threatens Manaphy. Bisharp acts as a potent setup sweeper, dissuading hazard removal and Intimidate while threatening checks such as Clefable and Slowbro. It also chips Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Rocky Helmet Landorus-T and threatens revenge killers like Excadrill with Sucker Punch, allowing Mega Altaria to wallbreak more easily. Magnezone can trap and remove Steel-types like Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor, relieving a lot of pressure for Mega Altaria. Hazard removal is also mandatory, so partners like Defog Latias are highly recommended. Notably, Latias can provide Healing Wish support so that Mega Altaria has another chance at sweeping, as well as potentially acting as a backup dual screens setter.</p>"

      "King DDD (Defensive Dragon Dance)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return boasts consistency, good single-move coverage, and power on its own even without investment or boosts. The combination of Dragon Dance and Roost allows Altaria to slowly, but safely, become faster and stronger while maintaining its health. This set's playstyle slightly depends on the move being used in the last slot. Heal Bell instantly cures status conditions that Mega Altaria and its team might have contracted while setting up or switching in, and it is especially crucial when considering this set's vulnerability to burn, paralysis, and poison. Substitute blocks status instead of curing it, in addition to scouting and protecting Altaria from dangerous attacks. Earthquake provides additional coverage against Heatran as well as other Fire- and Steel-types, but it leaves Altaria horribly vulnerable to status; it should also be noted that a 2x resisted Return is just as powerful as a neutral Earthquake.</p> <p>Another option to consider is Refresh, which has more PP than Heal Bell and prevents Altaria from losing against exceptionally persistent status users. However, it does not cure status for the entire team and loses out on great utility. Facade can replace Return to take advantage of any status conditions Altaria has taken. However, it is greatly reliant on the opponent having status users in the first place, making it situational and somewhat contradictory with Heal Bell or Substitute.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread along with an Impish nature optimizes Altaria's defenses and is ideal for setting up Dragon Dance. 28 Speed EVs are required to outrun Mega Lopunny and Manectric at +2, and to outrun maximum Speed Azumarill when unboosted. 252 HP / 136 Def / 92 SpD narrowly prevents KOs from some commonly feared, powerful attacks; for instance, Mega Altaria can't be 2HKOed by Choice Band Dragonite's Earthquake, Life Orb Thundurus's Hidden Power Ice, Mega Heracross's Rock Blast, and +1 Jolly Mega Charizard X's Flare Blitz, and it cannot be OHKOed by Jolly Mega Beedrill's Poison Jab and Azumarill's Play Rough. A spread of 252 HP / 180 Def / 76 Spe with a Jolly nature gives enough Speed to outrun maximum Speed Thundurus at +1, but it makes Mega Altaria significantly less bulky. A specially defensive spread is also worth consideration, although Mega Altaria is generally more suited for taking common physical attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is a hybrid of the support and offensive Dragon Dance sets; it utilizes its bulk and typing to check opposing threats as well as set up multiple boosts safely. While this set is bulky enough to set up on many foes, it is easily checked and walled due to the lack of immediate power and coverage. Therefore, setting up Dragon Dance boosts early-game is not recommended. During this time, however, Mega Altaria can act as an excellent defensive Pokemon that can soak up hits, recover, and hit back hard. After its checks and counters have been either weakened or eliminated mid- to late-game, Mega Altaria can then use Dragon Dance as a win condition.</p> <p>In regards to Dragon Dance, this set requires more than a couple of boosts to really get going. However, with its good bulk and typing in addition to having several status prevention methods, it can set up on many threats with little problem. With Heal Bell specifically, it can confidently set up in the face of defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Thundurus, Chansey, Politoed, Alomomola, Ice Beam-less Slowbro, and both formes of Mega Charizard. Substitute requires more prediction, as Altaria then can't switch directly into status, but it yields great results when used on the opponent's predicted switches. In such a situation, Altaria can choose to either set up or hit the switch-in with Return while behind a Substitute.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensively speaking, this set is self-sufficient, only really needing Rapid Spin or Defog support to guarantee survival of the KOs listed in the Set Details. On the other hand, it requires a tremendous amount of offensive support, as it has very limited coverage and power. Assuming it runs mono-Fairy coverage, Altaria definitely needs partners to take care of Steel- and Poison-types, among other foes such as Unaware Clefable. Magnezone can be used to for trap Steel-types, although a backup plan must be made if defensive Steel-types such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn run Shed Shell. Heatran is an excellent partner due to its defensive and offensive synergy with Altaria, using its coverage to take care of all opposing Steel-, Poison-, and Fairy-types while wearing down switch-ins with Lava Plume or Toxic. Likewise, Pokemon such as Latios, Hidden Power Fire Serperior, Fire Punch Diggersby, Choice Specs Dragalge, Dragonite, Breloom, and Superpower Azumarill are great choices, as they can lure in and deal huge damage to the aforementioned threats.</p> <p>Because this set is defensive in nature, it fits better on balanced teams that benefit from its unique set of resistances and don't mind its slow setup. An emphasis on offense is recommended to cover this set's lack of offensive sufficiency and ensure the team isn't entirely reliant on Altaria. Running another sweeper such as Thundurus, Excadrill, Manaphy, Volcarona, or Gyarados ensures there are other options to turn to in case Mega Altaria is unable to sweep. Altaria, in turn, can help these threats out by switching into their counters and providing Heal Bell support.</p>"
      },
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roost provides reliable healing, a necessity on a defensive Pokemon lacking Leftovers. The Normal-type move of choice is Mega Altaria's main attack; even without investment, both are consistent and deceptively powerful thanks to the Pixilate boost. Hyper Voice offers special offense, allowing Mega Altaria to check Substitute users and 2HKO physically defensive foes such as Landorus-T, Mega Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Gliscor. On the other hand, Return is generally stronger and can exploit the weaker physical defense of some important threats in the tier; to clarify, the likes of Assault Vest Conkeldurr, Mega Gallade, Mega Gyarados, and Thundurus are all OHKOed after Stealth Rock damage, while Assault Vest Azumarill, Mega Beedrill, Sylveon, and Eviolite-less Chansey are threatened by a clean 2HKO. Heal Bell is a quick fix to status conditions, giving Altaria additional utility and a cleric and status absorber.</p> <p>Flamethrower and Earthquake provide additional coverage, ensuring that Mega Altaria is significantly more self-sufficient and not a sitting duck against certain Steel-types. If the extra coverage is not needed, Roar and Perish Song are support moves that force unwanted switches and counter setup sweepers such as Mega Slowbro, Mega Latias, and Suicune. Toxic is certainly an option for wearing down defensive foes, but it is overall wasteful on a Pokemon that usually attracts Steel-types, Poison-types, and defensive clerics. Finally, Draco Meteor allows Mega Altaria to OHKO Mega Charizard X, turning it into one of the best counters to said threat. Aside from that, however, it wastes a moveslot due to a lack of significant added power and coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread, along with a Bold or Impish nature, allows Altaria to avoid being 2HKOed by Icy Wind from Keldeo, sun-boosted Fire Blast from Mega Charizard Y, Earthquake from maximum Attack Adamant Landorus-T, and Psyshock from Life Orb Latios. Alternatively, you can bump the Defense EVs to 132 to avoid being KOed by Azumarill's Play Rough followed by Aqua Jet. Use a Relaxed nature if you plan on using both a special and physical attack (i.e. Hyper Voice and Earthquake, or Return and Flamethrower). If you do, also invest a minimum of 4 Speed EVs to outrun uninvested base 70s such as Skarmory. Cloud Nine is the ability of choice, as it makes switching into Mega Charizard Y, Politoed, Omastar, and other weather-reliant Pokemon much easier prior to Mega Evolving. Heal Bell is a required move even though non-Mega Altaria has Natural Cure, because Altaria typically Mega Evolves immediately.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is a dedicated pivot, capable of switching into numerous attacks and status moves while being able to stand on its own with Roost. Additionally, with Fire Blast or Earthquake, it can avoid being too passive against Steel-types, with the added benefit of being able to lure them in sometimes as well. If Altaria uses Roar or Perish Song instead, however, it plays a little differently. With Roar, Altaria can force unwanted switches and stack up residual damage immediately multiple times. Perish Song is better used on more defensively-based teams, as it acts as a win condition in last-Pokemon scenarios and can afford to be more passive on such teams without encouraging the opponent to switch as frequently. Switch out to a more capable teammate if either move brings out a threatening check or counter.</p> <p>The most important factor is to never overestimate Mega Altaria's bulk and walling abilities, as it lacks Leftovers and can only take so many powerful attacks at a time. To avoid difficult offensive pressure, do not switch into entry hazards frequently, and recover back to full health with Roost whenever you can help it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This particular set is a good fit on balanced teams that require a cleric and a great number of resistances in one package. Mega Altaria can confidently switch into Fire Blast, Lava Plume, Scald, Waterfall, Secret Sword, Thunderbolt, Knock Off, Draco Meteor, and other moves, which makes it an ideal partner to other semi-defensive Pokemon that fear said attacks. Notably, Mega Altaria creates a good core with Heatran, which can handle opposing Fairy-, Poison-, and Steel-types very well. Heatran can also utilize status moves, such as Lava Plume, Toxic, Taunt, and Will-O-Wisp, an area where Altaria typically lacks. Ferrothorn also complements Altaria well defensively, with multiple helpful moves such as Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, and Knock Off at its disposal. Excadrill is a more offensive choice, capable of switching into Altaria's weaknesses with impunity while also offering Ground-type coverage, Stealth Rock, or Rapid Spin support. Choice Specs Magnezone also pairs well with Altaria defensively while providing stellar utility with Magnet Pull, allowing it to trap and eliminate slower Steel-types that are troublesome to Altaria and the rest of its team. Mega Altaria can also find a home on Sandstorm teams, providing resistances to Water-, Grass-, and Fighting-type attacks while being able to cure status ailments for the likes of Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Excadrill.</p> <p>Because this set can force many Pokemon to switch as well as switch out itself frequently, entry hazard control is extremely beneficial. Entry hazard setters such as Skarmory, Tyranitar, and Excadrill are good examples of teammates that can set up hazards quickly and force threats out themselves, depending on your team. As Defog is an issue for this strategy, using Bisharp can keep Defog users in check. As noted in the Set Details, Altaria can switch into and survive a number of 2HKOs, but only if entry hazards are off the field, making their removal necessary. Fortunately, the aforementioned Skarmory and Excadrill, amongst other good choices like Starmie, are able to provide this.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mega Altaria's Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice packs great power, consistency, and coverage, as well as the occasionally handy ability to pierce Substitutes. Fire Blast roasts the many Steel-types that come in to tank Hyper Voice; with the simple combination of these two attacks, Mega Altaria achieves good all-around coverage against nearly every type of foe except for Fire-types. Roost provides reliable recovery, granting Altaria the ability to switch in and check threats multiple times. The last slot comes down to personal preference. Earthquake, despite being uninvested, provides precious coverage against the common Heatran, as well as other Fire-types in general. Heal Bell is an effective supportive alternative; Altaria is notable for being one of the few Pokemon that can viably use it on an offensive set due to its ability to force switches and hit hard.</p> <p>In the realm of supportive moves, Agility and Tailwind can give Altaria a chance to clean up weakened teams (and support its own in regards to the latter); however, Mega Altaria usually doesn't have the sheer power to KO certain foes and pull off consistent sweeps, making it outclassed in such a role. Perish Song and Roar are also notable support moves that allow Altaria to counter certain setup sweepers or force unwanted switches, respectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread prioritizes bulk, which is crucial for Mega Altaria to handle threats such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Charizard X, and special attacking power. The Speed EVs allow Altaria to outrun Jolly Azumarill; it is generally advised to invest a bit more in order to outspeed defensive Rotom-W and Landorus-T, which commonly run enough Speed to hit this benchmark. Depending on the team, more Speed can be run; some benchmarks include 240 for Adamant Bisharp (176 EVs) and even max Speed if outrunning Adamant Diggersby and slower base 100s is desired. Another option is 252 SpA / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Timid nature, sacrificing bulk to outspeed certain key threats, including Jolly Mega Heracross, Jolly Bisharp, Adamant Excadrill, Adamant Lucario, and Timid Heatran, as well as tie with opposing base 80 Speed Pokemon such as opposing Altaria, Mamoswine, and non-Mega Gallade.</p> <p>Cloud Nine is the preferred ability, as it gives Altaria a chance to outrun and check Swift Swim Kingdra, Mega Swampert, Sand Rush Excadrill, and other weather sweepers before Mega Evolving. Additionally, this set isn't particularly bothered by status by virtue of being a hit-and-run attacker. If absorbing attacks such as Scald, Lava Plume, and Spore is significant for its team, feel free to use Natural Cure, though keep in mind that Altaria is usually Mega Evolved and can use Heal Bell to achieve such a purpose.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The most important aspect of this set is to focus on pivoting; avoid using it as a sweeper, as it lacks the sheer firepower or Speed to do so (as opposed to the frailer but more fast and powerful Mega Gardevoir and Mega Diancie). Specifically, take advantage of its combination of typing, bulk, coverage, and access to recovery in order to check, counter, or lure in an extensive number of threats in the tier, including but certainly not limited to Mega Lopunny, Mega Gyarados, Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Serperior, as well as Heatran (with Earthquake). If healthy enough, however, it makes a great cleaner after the opponent's special walls have been weakened or eliminated. When applicable, one way to lure in physical walls is to preemptively use Earthquake, which may cause the opponent to think that Altaria is physical and immediately switch in their physical Mega Altaria counter.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Altaria is mostly self-sufficient, focusing on supporting teammates defensively and offensively rather than sweeping itself. The only real offensive support it requires is against specially defensive Pokemon, which usually prevent Altaria from freely tossing out special attacks. As most specially defensive Pokemon besides Chansey and Celebi are usually Fairy-types such as Clefable, Sylveon, and Togekiss, using Steel-type teammates is a good answer. For example, stallbreaker Heatran can trap and weaken Chansey and other special walls with a combination of Magma Storm, Taunt, and Toxic. Ferrothorn can confidently switch into and threaten a number of Fairy-types while providing excellent support with Thunder Wave and entry hazards. Excadrill can flat-out KO these threats with Iron Head while providing either Stealth Rock or Rapid Spin support.</p> <p>Because of its coverage, Altaria is able to lure in and weaken a number of Steel-types such as Heatran with Earthquake while chipping away at other Pokemon with Hyper Voice. This makes Altaria an ideal partner for fast sweepers and cleaners that appreciate such Pokemon gone, such as Talonflame, Dragonite, Gyarados, Latios, Volcarona, and Serperior. Another notable teammate is Calm Mind Clefable; while it may seem odd and impractical to pair two similar Fairy-types together, Altaria is able to lure in and handle troublesome Steel-types, giving Clefable much more breathing room to do its work. Of course, this results in a double Steel- and Poison-type weakness, so additional insurance is required against these two types. Additionally, this Altaria can fit well on typical sandstorm team archetypes due to its resistances to Water-, Bug-, Dragon-, Fighting-, and Grass-type attacks. In this case, it can be partnered up with Hippowdon or Tyranitar, which provide a good defensive backbone as well as Stealth Rock support, and especially with Sand Rush Excadrill, a deadly force that synergizes extremely well with Altaria offensively and defensively.</p>"

  "Crawdaunt": {
    "overview": "<p>Crawdaunt is a true powerhouse and a terrifying wallbreaker thanks to Adaptability and its sky-high Attack stat. It has very powerful STAB moves in the form of Knock Off and Crabhammer, which are very hard to switch into. Additionally, Swords Dance and Aqua Jet give Crawdaunt a great cleaning tool and can somewhat fix up its poor Speed. Crawdaunt also has an excellent matchup against slower defensive teams, as they struggle to take boosted hits. However, Crawdaunt does have numerous flaws; it has low Speed, which is only slightly remedied by Aqua Jet, and is extremely frail, struggling to take even resisted hits, making it very hard to set up or switch in safely.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Waterfall can be used over Crabhammer for better accuracy, but the decrease in power is usually not preferred, as Crawdaunt is a wallbreaker. Running a Focus Sash makes Crawdaunt harder to revenge kill and makes setting up with Swords Dance easier. It also allows Crawdaunt to pretty much net a guaranteed KO against offensive teams, provided its Focus Sash is not broken.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth are all capable of taking on Crawdaunt. Mega Venusaur in particular is a very reliable answer as it easily survives a +2 Knock Off and OHKOs Crawdaunt in return, meanwhile physically defensive variants of Tangrowth can also survive a +2 Knock Off provided Stealth Rock is not on the field. However, Mega Venusaur does risk getting 2HKOed by Choice Band-boosted Crunch after Stealth Rock. Amoonguss struggles against boosted Crawdaunt but takes it on fairly easily if Crawdaunt hasn't boosted. Chesnaught can also take on Crawdaunt due to its very high physical defense and resistance to both of Crawdaunt's STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Mega Altaria</strong>: Mega Altaria resists both of Crawdaunt's STAB moves while being able to set up on Crawdaunt with Dragon Dance or just KO it with either Return or Hyper Voice.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulkier Water-types such as Rotom-W, Azumarill, and Keldeo can switch in on resisted STAB moves and either proceed to KO Crawdaunt with their respective STAB moves or, in Rotom-W's case, cripple it with a burn.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Latios, Keldeo, Breloom, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Manectric can come in after Crawdaunt KOes a Pokemon and proceed to force it out. Priority users such as Talonflame can also outprioritize Crawdaunt's Aqua Jet.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance can boost Crawdaunt's Attack to insane levels, allowing it to severely dent or KO even Pokemon that resist its attacks. Crabhammer is Crawdaunt's most powerful STAB move, being able to 2HKO maximum HP Azumarill, as well as easily KOing many neutrally hit Pokemon. Crawdaunt sets itself apart from other wallbreakers thanks to its immensely powerful STAB Knock Off. Not many Pokemon resist Dark-type attacks, and very few of them appreciate having their item knocked off. Aqua Jet is also a must on Crawdaunt, as it patches up Crawdaunt's low Speed and can often be used to sweep a weakened team. Crunch is another option to do more damage than Knock Off to Mega Venusaur, but the power and utility provided by Knock Off will definitely be missed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Adaptability is the reason why Crawdaunt is such a powerful and efficient wallbreaker, and it's what gives Crawdaunt its niche. 252 Speed EVs combined with a Jolly nature allow Crawdaunt to outspeed many common defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, defensive variants of Heatran and Landorus-T, and Mega Venusaur. An Adamant nature can also be used to hit harder, but Jolly is definitely preferred. Maximum Attack EVs increase Crawdaunt's damage output, making it harder to wall. A Life Orb is the preferred item, as it increases Crawdaunt's Attack while also allowing it to change moves, making it much harder to wall.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Crawdaunt is extremely frail, so only bring it in on weak resisted moves, after a teammate faints, or with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. Using Crawdaunt is pretty straightforward; simply select the appropriate STAB move and watch the opposing Pokemon lose their item and take heavy damage in the process or simply get KOed. Crawdaunt is a wallbreaker, so use it to punch major holes in the opposing team so that a teammate has an opportunity to sweep. Crawdaunt excels against defensive teams but struggles against more offensively oriented teams; wait until the opposing team is weakened enough and Crawdaunt may be able to get an opportunity to sweep with Aqua Jet. Bring in Crawdaunt against a Pokemon that it forces out, such as Heatran, and either set up a Swords Dance or just directly nuke the Pokemon that switches in. Usually after Crawdaunt has taken out a Pokemon, it is best to let it get KOed, as switching it out loses momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Talonflame is a great partner, being able to destroy Crawdaunt's main counters, such as Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur. Latios can also defeat Crawdaunt's counters, while also being able to remove entry hazards that may trouble Crawdaunt. Like most wallbreakers and setup sweepers, Crawdaunt appreciates entry hazard support. Klefki and Ferrothorn can both set up Spikes, with the latter also being able to set up Stealth Rock. Momentum grabbers such as Rotom-W, Celebi, and Landorus-T are appreciated to help Crawdaunt switch in. Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X appreciates the removal of Heatran and Slowbro, while Dragon Dance Mega Altaria appreciates Ferrothorn and Skarmory being weakened. Crawdaunt can also weaken Keldeo's main counters, namely Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Azumarill and the combination of the two can heavily pressure Mega Venusaur.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Crawdaunt's main STAB move, crippling whatever takes the hit by removing its item. Aqua Jet allows Crawdaunt to compensate for its low base Speed as well as revenge kill a few notable threats from full HP, namely Excadrill and Mega Diancie. In addition, Aqua Jet is capable of KOing the likes of Weavile, Tornadus-T, and more after a bit of prior damage due to Crawdaunt's raw strength. Crabhammer is Crawdaunt's most powerful STAB move and is easily capable of 2HKOing most Pokemon that resist it. Crunch is a secondary Dark-type STAB move that doesn't lose out on power when the target no longer has an item. Furthermore, Crunch also nails Mega Evolutions, which don't take increased damage from Knock Off. Mega Venusaur is a prime target of Crunch, and it's generally advised that one anticipate obvious switches to it and act accordingly. Finally, should Ferrothorn be a concern, Superpower may be worth running over Crunch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack investment maximizes Crawdaunt's damage output, allowing it to wallbreak to its highest potential. 252 Speed EVs in tandem with a Jolly nature put Crawdaunt at 229 Speed, which enables it to outspeed most Rotom-W and defensive Landorus-T. A Choice Band combined with Adaptability boosts Crawdaunt's wallbreaking power to insane levels; even Pokemon that resist its moves will commonly find themselves being 2HKOed. Should more breaking power be desirable, one can opt for an Adamant nature to improve Crawdaunt's matchup versus bulkier teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Given that Crawdaunt is a frail and slow wallbreaker, Volt Switch and U-turn support to bring it in safely is ideal. Double switches accomplish similar things but are generally more risky. Be sure to utilize Knock Off early-game to cripple whatever has the misfortune of switching into Crawdant, as it not only is extremely powerful but also has utility in removing the target's item. Since Crawdaunt excels versus defensive builds as opposed to offensive ones, playing a more prediction-heavy style may be needed to maximize Crawdaunt's effectiveness when facing more offensive builds. For example, Crawdaunt may be better off using Knock Off against an opposing Sand Rush Excadrill as opposed to Aqua Jet, as Aqua Jet is assumed to be the move of choice in that scenario and does little to any Pokemon that resist Water.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As previously mentioned, the key to maximizing Crawdaunt's effectiveness is through Volt Switch and U-turn support from bulky pivots. Examples of these teammates include defensive Mega Scizor, Jirachi, Landorus-T, Assault Vest Tornadus-T, and Rotom-W. In respect to partners that directly help cover weaknesses, one will need to consider teammates that can deal with the likes of Keldeo, Azumarill, bulky Grass-types, and Fairies. Amoonguss is capable of dealing with Keldeo and Azumarill, both of which resist Crawdaunt's STAB moves and threaten it greatly. Talonflame in particular works well alongside Crawdaunt offensively, as it can check Keldeo, Grass-types, and Fairies such as Mega Altaria (defensive variants virtually completely block Crawdaunt). Because it can greatly threaten most Grass-types and Keldeo, Latios or Latias makes for a solid addition to Crawdaunt teams and can possibly provide Defog support to builds running Talonflame alongside Crawdaunt. Heatran is capable of scaring out most threatening Grass-types, namely defensive Mega Venusaur and Serperior, while providing Stealth Rock support. Assault Vest or Life Orb Tornadus-T can also threaten Grass-types well with its Flying STAB moves and additionally can bring Crawdaunt in via U-turn. Any Pokemon that enjoys common Crawdaunt switch-ins being weakened works well, so anything that wants the likes of Keldeo, Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and physically defensive Tangrowth gone is an ideal partner that can form a potent offensive duo with Crawdaunt. Swords Mega Scizor and Mega Gyarados are good examples; Mega Scizor appreciates Keldeo being weakened, while Mega Gyarados loves having Keldeo, Ferrothorn, and other bulky Grass-types crippled for its sweeps. Mega Charizard X appreciates Crawdaunt's generally wallbreaking capabilities, namely versus Slowbro and the bulky Ground-types that stop its sweeps. Since Crawdaunt mainly threatens slower, bulkier builds, it naturally pairs well with teammates that are capable of threatening more offensive builds, such as Talonflame, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Manectric.</p>"

  "Absol": {
    "overview": "<p>Upon Mega Evolving, Absol gets a great base 115 Speed, an excellent base 150 Attack, and Magic Bounce, one of the most useful abilities in the game, as it prevents entry hazards and bounces back status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave. Its Dark-type STAB moves hit many prominent Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, Slowbro, Cresselia, Gengar, Starmie, and Metagross super effectively. Besides common Dark-type STAB moves like Sucker Punch, Knock Off, and Pursuit it gets Play Rough and Iron Tail as coverage to hit Dark- and Fairy-types respectively.</p> <p>Despite Mega Absol's offensive power, its lack of bulk makes it a true glass cannon. This makes it very hard for Mega Absol to come in safely or set up with Swords Dance. As a pure Dark-type, Mega Absol needs to be especially aware of Fairy-type moves like Clefable's Moonblast, Fighting-type moves such as Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick and Mega Alakazam's Focus Blast, and U-turn. While its Speed tier is great, it’s still outsped by some important Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Mega Manectric, Jolly Talonflame, Mega Alakazam, Weavile, and Tornadus-T. Sucker Punch helps against those Pokemon but isn't strong enough to OHKO them besides Mega Alakazam. Being slow prior to Mega Evolution makes its first turn very risky. As a Dark-type, Mega Absol is often outclassed by Weavile, which is faster and has a great secondary STAB typing. Mega Absol's strength lies in its offensive pressure, ability, and variable moveset.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The most notable set outside of Swords Dance would be Protect, Will-O-Wisp, Knock Off, and Iron Tail. This set punishes common switch-ins to Mega Absol like defensive Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon. Iron Tail offsets Mega Diancie and Clefable switching in, which otherwise counter the Will-O-Wisp set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Clefable</strong>: Without Iron Tail, Absol is mostly walled by Clefable. Clefable can take Absol’s Dark-type STAB moves, even after a Swords Dance. Additionally, Clefable can OHKO Absol with Moonblast, and Swords Dance-boosted Play Rough from Absol isn’t even a guaranteed 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Mega Lopunny</strong>: Mega Lopunny outspeeds Absol, does a good chunk of damage with Fake Out, and can OHKO it with High Jump Kick. Also, Mega Lopunny doesn't take much from unboosted Sucker Punch, and Play Rough has a very low chance of OHKOing it at full health.</p> <p><strong>Surprise Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Absol relies on accurate Sucker Punch predictions to get past Pokemon holding Choice Scarf, so Pokemon with multiple item choices, like Heatran, Excadrill, Keldeo, and Terrakion, can get the jump on Absol if they're running Choice Scarf.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: If Absol doesn't run Play Rough or Superpower, Dark-types like Bisharp, Mega Gyarados, and Mandibuzz can be major problems.</p> <p><strong>Bulky or Dark-resistant Priority Users</strong>: Mega Absol is vulnerable to common priority moves like Technician Breloom’s and Conkeldurr's Mach Punches, Dragonite’s Extreme Speed, Choice Band Azumarill’s Aqua Jet, and Scizor's Bullet Punch. Sucker Punch helps against these Pokemon, but most of them easily live one hit due to either their natural bulk or a Dark resistance.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thanks to Magic Bounce, Mega Absol doesn’t have to worry about status moves like Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, and Roar limiting its ability to obtain and utilize its Swords Dance boosts. Knock Off is not only Mega Absol's strongest STAB move but also useful for removing important items from foes. Sucker Punch is used for priority when Mega Absol is outpaced, and it also lets Mega Absol efficiently revenge kill. Iron Tail lets Mega Absol deal with the Fairy-types that resist its Dark-type STAB moves. However, it leaves Mega Absol walled by Bisharp and Keldeo, and its low accuracy is unreliable. Superpower lets Mega Absol nail Ferrothorn, Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Excadrill, but it lets Fairy-types wall Mega Absol. In addition, the stat drops make it problematic by decreasing both its power and bulk, hurting Mega Absol's sweep. Play Rough has near perfect coverage with Mega Absol's Dark-type moves, hitting the entire metagame for neutral damage. It also hits lots of specific threats like Weavile, Dragonite, and Garchomp super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature are necessary to let it naturally outspeed base 110 Speed Pokemon, Thundurus, Serperior, Choice Scarf Magnezone, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Maximum Speed also allows its Sucker Punch to go before opposing priority moves like Mega Metagross's Bullet Punch and Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack. Justified can grant Absol a free single stage-boost to Attack by switching into lower-power Knock Offs like Clefable's, Serperior's, and Ferrothorn's before Mega Evolving.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Absol sets up best on status-reliant walls it can threaten and is not threatened by, like Chansey, Amoonguss, and Cofagrigus. Mega Absol preforms well as a late-game sweeper, picking off weakened foes. Alternatively, it can set up mid-game to poke holes in the opponent's team and make openings for teammates later on. Absol can also try to deny hazards after Mega Evolving, but its frailty limits its ability to do this. Mega Absol is able to revenge kill thanks to its high Speed and the massive damage from even an unboosted Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because of Mega Absol’s horrible matchup against Mega Lopunny, Clefable is a reliable switch-in. Excadrill helps Mega Absol with its positive matchup against Clefable if Mega Absol forgoes Iron Tail, and it can also switch into most other Fairy-types and U-turn. Additionally, Excadrill’s Rapid Spin support is vital, since you can't be dependent on Mega Absol to prevent hazards for your team; furthermore, Excadrill can set Stealth Rock, which wears down Mega Absol's checks. Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon such as Volcarona, Talonflame, and Dragonite like the hazard control that Mega Absol and Excadrill create. A U-turn punisher like Static Zapdos or Rocky Helmet Landorus-T is great due to Absol’s weakness to the move. A pivot like Rotom-W or Tornadus-T is helpful for getting Absol in safely. Electric-types, like Thundurus and Rotom-W hit most of Absol's checks neutrally and can pivot with Volt Switch.</p>"

  "Metagross": {
    "overview": "<p>Metagross was blessed with a Mega Evolution that possesses many key traits that make it a prominent threat in the OU metagame. Its great ability, Tough Claws, pairs very well with its great movepool. Furthermore, Mega Metagross has a great typing and stellar all-around bulk, which provides it with numerous opportunities to switch in. Finally, Mega Metagross's offenses are great; its high Attack stat coupled with its blazing Speed tier makes it a very fast, hard-hitting tank. However, Mega Metagross's base Speed before Mega Evolving is subpar at best, and despite its impressive typing, it's difficult to justify switching it into Pokemon it can counter such as Mega Gardevoir and Clefable, since they often carry moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave that completely cripple it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The combination of Substitute and Power-Up Punch lets Mega Metagross use weaker defensive Pokemon as setup bait, as they are usually unable to break Mega Metagross's Substitute. Substitute on the All-out Attacker set gives Mega Metagross a buffer against status effects and makes it harder to revenge kill, but it must forgo a valuable coverage move to fit it onto its set. Hidden Power Fire enables Metagross to bypass an otherwise solid counter in Mega Scizor, but it has no use outside of that and is very weak. For example, it is unable to 2HKO standard Ferrothorn or specially defensive Skarmory.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Skarmory and Mega Scizor both are able to take on Mega Metagross quite easily, as they are able to take Hammer Arms and whittle Mega Metagross down with their moves. Bulky Mega Scizor is particularly dangerous because it can use Metagross to set up Swords Dance and is not 2HKOed by any of its moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Slowbro, Slowking, and Suicune are all fine checks to Mega Metagross. Slowbro and Slowking in particular can cripple Mega Metagross with a Scald burn or Thunder Wave, but both find themselves heavily pressured by Thunder Punch variants. Suicune is a similar case, only fearing Thunder Punch and otherwise uses Mega Metagross to set up Calm Mind. Rotom-W is also a decent answer, as it's only threatened by Zen Headbutt after prior damage and can cripple Mega Metagross with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Hippowdon, Garchomp, Quagsire, Landorus-T, and Gliscor are able to take Mega Metagross's STAB moves. However, Hippowdon and Quagsire lose to Grass Knot, while Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T lose to Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Choice Scarf Tyranitar is capable of outspeeding Mega Metagross and, with prior damage, is capable of knocking it out with a super effective attack. Life Orb Bisharp is capable of OHKOing Mega Metagross with Sucker Punch after minimal prior damage. Mandibuzz is able to take on any attacks that Mega Metagross throws at it and defeat it with Foul Play, but Stealth Rock cannot be on the field.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Physically defensive Mew and Cresselia are able to wall most variants of Mega Metagross that lack Substitute. Mew is able to cripple Mega Metagross with a Will-O-Wisp. Cresselia is also able to wall Mega Metagross, as despite not having a way of doing any meaningful damage to it, Cresselia is capable of crippling it with a Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Tangrowth and physically defensive Celebi are able to take any hit Mega Metagross throws at them, including Ice Punch, and either cripple it with Sleep Powder or Thunder Wave or simply wear it down throughout the match. They must watch out for Attack boosts from Meteor Mash, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Life Orb Weavile, Overheat Mega Manectric, Sand Rush Excadrill, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Choice Specs Raikou, Life Orb Starmie, and Life Orb Tornadus-T carrying Heat Wave are able to outspeed and either knock out or severely cripple Mega Metagross with super effective or hard-hitting moves. It's worth noting that Tyranitar and Weavile are vulnerable to Bullet Punch and thus may not be able to revenge kill Mega Metagross.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Meteor Mash is Mega Metagross's primary STAB attack and hits Pokemon that don't resist it exceptionally hard. Zen Headbutt is the preferred move in the second moveslot to hit targets such as Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Mega Venusaur for big damage. Thunder Punch is also a solid option in this slot to net super effective damage on Skarmory and bulky Water-types like Slowbro. Hammer Arm hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Heatran for super effective damage and receives a Tough Claws boost, but Earthquake can be used instead to hit Heatran harder and, notably, to hit Mega Charizard X, Victini, Jirachi, and opposing Mega Metagross super effectively. The last slot rounds off Mega Metagross's coverage. Ice Punch is the top choice, as it is Metagross's only way to reliably KO defensive Garchomp, and it has the notable advantage of also hitting Landorus-T and Gliscor for major damage. It also has great neutral coverage alongside Thunder Punch. Bullet Punch is great for revenge killing faster Pokemon, but the loss of a coverage move is often not worth it. Pursuit is another great option for Mega Metagross to support its team. It enables Mega Metagross to remove problematic Pokemon for its common partners to facilitate a sweep later on in the game. For example, Mega Metagross is often paired with Keldeo, and it is able to Pursuit trap common answers to Keldeo such as Celebi, Latios, and Latias, as it naturally checks them. Furthermore, Pursuit is great for getting chip damage on forced switches, such as Mega Gardevoir and Choice Specs Raikou locked into Hidden Power Ice. Should Pursuit be run, however, be wary of the loss of coverage. Lastly, Grass Knot is a somewhat niche option for dealing a significant amount of damage to Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Quagsire, though hitting these specific threats is generally not worth the loss in coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment in tandem with a Jolly nature capitalizes on Metagross's offensive capabilities. Alternatively, an Adamant nature can be used for more power, but the inability to outspeed metagame staples such as Keldeo and positive-natured Mega Charizard Y makes it an inferior option most of the time. A Naive nature is also an option if Grass Knot is used, but the loss of special bulk can be troublesome during matches, and the power increase isn't always necessary.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Metagross is a great check to many prominent Fairy-types in the tier such as Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Azumarill, although each one has a way of crippling Mega Metagross should it be played recklessly. Mega Metagross's primary role is to punch holes into opposing teams, so bringing it in against defensive Pokemon that are unable to touch it is advisable. Similarly, switching Mega Metagross into resisted hits is a great way to get it into play.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that are able to defeat Mega Metagross's most prominent checks, such as Skarmory, Jirachi, and Mega Scizor, are heavily appreciated. Talonflame, Keldeo, Choice Specs Magnezone, and Heatran are good options for this role. Manaphy and Choice Band Azumarill are great wallbreakers that are able to break through Mega Metagross's checks and thus make for good teammates. On sets lacking Grass Knot, good partners include Will-O-Wisp Talonflame, Swords Dance Landorus-T, and Swords Dance Terrakion because they wear down Hippowdon, Garchomp, and defensive Landorus-T. Mega Metagross appreciates entry hazards to ensure certain KOs that it would otherwise be unable to achieve, so Stealth Rock setters such as Garchomp and Heatran make for good partners. Latias is an excellent teammate for Mega Metagross because it can provide Mega Metagross a second life with Healing Wish.</p>"

      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Polish enables Mega Metagross to outspeed the entire metagame after a boost. Meteor Mash is Metagross's obligatory Steel-type STAB move and has a decent chance to raise its Attack by one stage. Should accuracy pose a concern, Iron Head is a viable alternative. Zen Headbutt is needed to power through Rotom-W and other Pokemon that resist Steel, and it sports a decent flinch chance that pairs well with Mega Metagross's high Speed. Ice Punch is needed to be able to break through defensive Garchomp, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Gliscor, while Hammer Arm is useful for breaking through Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Heatran. Alternatively, Earthquake nets super effective hits on Jirachi, Victini, and Mega Charizard X, but it is otherwise inferior to Hammer Arm, despite the latter move's Speed drop.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack investment enables Mega Metagross to hit as hard as possible while still hitting the very important base 110 Speed benchmark. Should Speed not be as critical, an alternative EV spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe with an Adamant nature allows Mega Metagross to outspeed neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon before a Rock Polish boost and everything relevant in the metagame after a boost. Clear Body aids in the process of setting up against Intimidate users.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early-game, use Mega Metagross to break down walls or revenge kill slower Pokemon. Then, when it is time to go for a sweep late-game and Mega Metagross's checks and counters have been sufficiently weakened, bring Mega Metagross in on Fairy-types that it forces out to gain a free turn to set up. However, be wary of Thunder Wave Clefable and Will-O-Wisp Gardevoir. Holding off on Mega Evolving allows Metagross to bypass Intimidate users that try to lower its Attack stat. Setting up before Mega Evolving isn't too difficult, as Metagross still possesses a decent Speed tier after a boost and is still quite bulky.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that are able to defeat Mega Metagross's most prominent checks, such as Skarmory, Jirachi, and Mega Scizor, are heavily appreciated. Talonflame, Keldeo, Choice Specs Magnezone, and Heatran are good options for this role. Wallbreakers like Manaphy and Choice Band Azumarill pair well with Mega Metagross by breaking through its checks. Pokemon like Garchomp and Heatran can set up Stealth Rock to help Mega Metagross hit KO benchmarks that it can't achieve otherwise. Latias's access to Healing Wish makes it a fantastic ally, as it can give Mega Metagross a second chance at sweeping.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Pursuit allows Metagross to trap Psychic-types such as Alakazam, Latios, Latias, and Celebi, and Meteor Mash is Metagross's most powerful STAB move and has decent neutral coverage. Bullet Punch is necessary to allow Metagross to pick off weakened Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Gengar, Latios, Latias, Mega Gardevoir, Terrakion, and Tornadus-T. Earthquake has good coverage alongside Meteor Mash, allowing Metagross to hit Pokemon such as Heatran, opposing Metagross, Magnezone, and Jirachi while preventing it from being setup bait for Mega Charizard X. Zen Headbutt can be used to allow Metagross to deal extra damage to Pokemon such as Keldeo, Talonflame, and Mega Venusaur. Hammer Arm is another option that still hits Heatran but also allows Metagross to threaten Spikers such as Ferrothorn and specially defensive Skarmory, which both use Metagross as setup bait. Ice Punch can be used to deal extra damage to Garchomp and Landorus-T, but it isn't usually worth the loss of Meteor Mash, Zen Headbutt, or Hammer Arm.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP and 96 Special Defense EVs prevent Mega Alakazam's Shadow Ball from 2HKOing Metagross even after Stealth Rock damage. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack to help Metagross hit as hard as possible. Assault Vest allows Metagross to easily switch into Fairy- and Psychic-types and threaten them with Meteor Mash or Pursuit. Clear Body lets Metagross avoid stat drops from the likes of Mega Manectric and Landorus-T. 8 Speed EVs can be run to outspeed standard Belly Drum Azumarill.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Metagross should be used as an offensive switch-in to the likes of Latios, which Metagross can Pursuit trap easily, as it avoids the 2HKO even from Hidden Power Fire variants. If you predict Latios to stay in, use Meteor Mash instead, which puts it in KO range for Bullet Punch. Metagross should also be used to offensively check Fairy-types such as Clefable and Mega Gardevoir, though this is riskier, as they can heavily cripple Metagross with Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp. Metagross is also a good offensive answer to the likes of Mega Alakazam, as it can switch into any of its moves, with Shadow Ball being unable to 2HKO Metagross, and trap it with Pursuit + Bullet Punch. However, Life Orb Alakazam is capable of 2HKOing Metagross.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Assault Vest Metagross performs best as a tank on offensive and balance teams, as it easily switches into the Pokemon that threaten these playstyles. Pokemon weak to Psychic-type moves such as Mega Venusaur and Keldeo appreciate Metagross's ability to trap Psychic-types for them, while Keldeo can check most Ground- and Fire-types that trouble Metagross. Landorus-T can handle the Pokemon that threaten Metagross such as Garchomp, opposing Landorus-T, and Excadrill. It can also run Hidden Power Ice, which makes handling Garchomp and opposing Landorus-T easier. Garchomp punishes physical attackers such as Bisharp and can run Fire Blast to scare off Skarmory and Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Common Pokemon on balance and offensive teams such as Hippowdon, Slowbro, Ferrothorn, Clefable, Azumarill, Landorus-T, and Latias can all find themselves heavily pressured by Mega Gardevoir, so they all appreciate Metagross being able to switch in and force it out or OHKO it. Metagross also appreciates Thunder Wave support from Clefable, as it slows down threats such as Kyurem-B, Mega Lopunny, and Heatran, which makes it easier for Metagross to pick them off, and it appreciates Hippowdon walling threats that can overwhelm it such as Bisharp, Mega Charizard X, and non-Swords Dance Excadrill. Metagross also functions as an alternate Pursuit trapper compared to Tyranitar or Bisharp, as it still supports Pokemon such as Thundurus, Keldeo, and Mega Charizard Y in addition to being able to switch into common Fairy-types, unlike the two Dark-types. Metagross also offers very solid role compression for offensive teams, as it beats Latios and also checks Mega Venusaur very well, so it works well with the likes of Keldeo, Thundurus lacking Psychic or Hidden Power Flying, and Breloom. It also works well alongside Ferrothorn, Dragalge, Skarmory, and Hippowdon, as it can help keep heavy entry hazard pressure on the opposing team by removing common Defog users such as Latios and Latias. Pairing Metagross with other Pokemon that can Mega Evolve such as Gyarados, Scizor, Alakazam, Latias, Tyranitar, and Slowbro provides a lot of surprise factor and can force your opponent to play guessing games, which can affect the outcome of the game if they expect Mega Metagross over any of the other Mega Evolutions.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Latias's typing along with solid bulk makes it a great offensive check to a variety of OU threats, including Keldeo, Breloom, Manaphy, and Mega Manectric. This defensive utility, coupled with access to Defog, makes it an excellent choice for both offensive and balanced teams. On top of that, Latias's Mega Evolution is incredibly bulky, allowing it to serve as a reliable choice for support on defensive teams. Latias's main issue is that outside of its Mega Evolution and Healing Wish, it is almost entirely outclassed by Latios, which brings far more power to the table. It also finds itself walled by common Fairy-types, such as Azumarill, Mega Gardevoir, and Clefable, as well as Steel-types such as Klefki, Ferrothorn, and Scizor. Although Latias's Psychic typing brings a useful set of resistances, it also brings a weakness to Pursuit trappers, which access to Reflect Type can help nullify.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Latias's offensive movepool is fairly varied, carrying moves such as Surf, Earthquake, Grass Knot, and both Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Fighting. However, it faces heavy competition from Latios in an offensive role, as Latios's superior firepower makes it the favored choice. Because of this, however, Latias is able to lull typical switch-ins into a false sense of security and lure them more effectively. Colbur Berry is an option to halve the power of a Dark-type move, granting Latias a way of escaping Pursuit trappers once without taking too much damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn, Heatran, Excadrill, Mega Metagross, Klefki, and Scizor resist Latias's STAB moves and can easily set up against it. Mega Scizor is particularly threating because it can use Mega Latias to set up Swords Dance and uses Recover to restore any lost HP as it sets up. Excadrill is also notable due to the fact that it's immune to Thunder Wave. However, both Excadrill and Heatran must watch out for Surf, as it threatens to 2HKO or 3HKO depending on their EV spread. It's also worth noting that Ferrothorn loses to Mega Latias's Calm Mind set if it's running Reflect Type.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Weavile, are all immune to Latias's Psychic-type STAB moves and are able to deal heavy damage back to it, though Bisharp and Weavile must be wary of directly switching in due to the threat of Thunder Wave and Draco Meteor. All of them also have access to Pursuit, which can KO Latias even if it tries to switch out. However, Mega Latias can evade being Pursuit trapped if it carries Reflect Type.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Azumarill, Clefable, Mega Diancie, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Altaria, and Sylveon are immune to Latias's Dragon-type STAB moves and are able to threaten it back with super effective attacks. However, Mega Gardevoir doesn't appreciate being paralyzed by Thunder Wave on the switch and Azumarill fears Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Priority attackers, Choice Scarf users, and naturally faster Pokemon can be huge threats to Latias. Be on the lookout for Mamoswine, Toxicroak, Scizor, Talonflame, Kyurem-B, and Landorus-T, as these Pokemon commonly carry priority moves or Choice Scarf. Naturally faster threats include Scolipede, Mega Beedrill, Mega Lopunny, and Tornadus-T.</p>",

Defog lets Latias remove entry hazards for its teammates such as Volcarona, which greatly appreciate Stealth Rock being cleared from the field. Psychic allows Latias to do consistent damage to Pokemon it is tasked with checking such as Volcanion and Serperior. Ice Beam should be used if the team is weak to Gliscor and the aforementioned Serperior, while Draco Meteor lets Latias get off a big hit. Surf allows Latias to hit Pokemon that otherwise wall it such as Excadrill and Heatran. Thunder Wave exacerbates Latias's support by letting it spread status.

Choice Scarf is also useful against defensive teams, since Latias can remove crucial items such as Eviolite on Chansey and Leftovers on Clefable. Lastly, Rocky Helmet lets Latias be a little less passive when checking physical threats, chipping them every time they use contact moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Latias set fits best on offensive teams that need entry hazard removal to clear Stealth Rock for partners like Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. Latias is primarily a switch-in for its teammates against resisted hits such as Serperior's Leaf Storm and Volcanion's Steam Eruption. When Stealth Rock is on the field, prioritize clearing it with Defog for teammates like Volcarona. Healing Wish should be used when one of your crucial Pokemon falls to low health during the course of the game but is pivotal for winning the game. Non-Colbur Berry Latias should avoid being in on Dark-types such as Weavile, which is especially threatening to Latias due to its STAB combination.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Latias fits best on offense teams that need to clear Stealth Rock. A partner like Volcarona has good synergy with Latias, since it appreciates entry hazards cleared from the field as well as Latias's Water resistance. Volcarona also appreciates Latias's ability to paralyze its checks such as Tornadus, which can otherwise beat it with Hurricane or Taunt to prevent Quiver Dance. Manaphy greatly appreciates checks like Serperior being shut down by Latias's Thunder Wave as well as the potential to be brought back from low health with Healing Wish. Healing Wish support also works with physical wallbreakers like Mega Metagross, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Medicham that take damage or status conditions while working their way through the defensive core of the opponent.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam and Thunderbolt complement each other's coverage excellently, allowing Mega Latias to hit almost everything in the tier for neutral damage. They also let it threaten common Pokemon on balance, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, Skarmory, and non-Calm Mind Slowbro. Recover allows Mega Latias to heal itself and reliably check opposing threats throughout the match. Reflect Type changes Mega Latias's typing to match its foe's, allowing it to fare better against Ferrothorn and Heatran while also allowing it to escape Pursuit from Bisharp and Tyranitar. Thunder Wave cripples most offensive Pokemon while annoying slower ones with the chance to skip their turn. Calm Mind turns Mega Latias from a support Pokemon into a bulky wincon that is able to wall most attackers after a couple boosts. Reflect Type can also be used in one of the slots.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and a Timid nature allow Mega Latias to Speed tie with opposing Latias, Latios, Mega Metagross, and Gengar while outrunning Keldeo, Terrakion, and slower threats. Maximum HP investment allows Mega Latias to tank hits as well as possible. An alternative spread of 248 HP / 68 Def / 192 Spe lets Latias outspeed positive-natured base 100s, such as Mega Charizard Y and Manaphy, as well as outrun maximum Speed Jolly Garchomp. Latiasite drastically improves Latias's bulk, improving its longevity and allowing it to take hits it usually wouldn't be able to, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Pursuit.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Latias's typing and incredible bulk allow it to switch in on and check many offensive threats, including Keldeo, Breloom, Thundurus, Manaphy, Mega Manectric, Mega Charizard Y, and Rotom-W. When pivoting in and out, use Recover on predicted switches in order to keep Mega Latias healthy and to avoid having it be KOed by the Pokemon it's hoping to check. Sets running Reflect Type or Thunder Wave are typically used for their support abilities, being able to switch in on and check threats. Calm Mind sets, on the other hand, are wincons, so you'll want to play more carefully with Mega Latias. Try to remove or weaken problematic Pokemon, such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn, before you start setting up. When playing against Tyranitar, identifying which set it is running can be a huge deal, as certain sets are much more threatening to Mega Latias than others. Support Tyranitar, for example, is often unable to do much to Mega Latias, while Choice Scarf sets cannot beat Mega Latias if it stays on the field as Tyranitar uses Pursuit. Choice Band Tyranitar, however, is always a danger for Mega Latias, so identifying and removing it grants Mega Latias much more freedom.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Latias forces plenty of switches, so it appreciates entry hazard support to take full advantage of them. Teammates such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn are able to set Spikes and Stealth Rock and they have good synergy with Mega Latias as well. Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Conkeldurr, Cobalion, and Infernape are all able to beat Steel- and Dark-types for Mega Latias, while Mega Latias in turn can take on bulky Water-types that these Pokemon despise. Clefable and Mega Latias make for a potent duo, as they share counters that can be crippled by Thunder Wave, such as Jirachi and Mega Metagross. Having these Pokemon paralyzed by one teammate allows the other to boost with Calm Mind much more easily. Mega Latias is forced out by Fairy-types, so Pokemon that can beat them such as Jirachi, Heatran, Excadrill, and Amoonguss can make for excellent partners.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind gives Mega Latias a way to boost its already good Special Attack and Special Defense stats further and become a very threatening wincon. Recover is used in the next slot to keep Mega Latias alive as it boosts and consistently take hits from the likes of Keldeo and Thundurus. The rest of its moveset is very customizable based on what the team needs. Psyshock is a STAB move with decent immediate power that gives Mega Latias the ability to deal physical damage. It is Mega Latias's best option for taking on the likes of Keldeo before boosting, which is especially useful if Mega Latias is not using Thunderbolt, and helps it win Calm Mind wars against Pokemon such as Clefable because it does not take into account the target's Special Defense. Stored Power is an alternative that has very low initial power but hits incredibly hard after several boosts and turns Mega Latias into a massive threat. It has the added bonus of breaking through Unaware users like Quagsire and Clefable due to its increased Base Power after every boost, something Unaware can't negate. Surf provides great coverage alongside Latias's Psychic-type STAB move due to its ability to deal large sums of damage to several Pokemon that would otherwise wall Mega Latias like Tyranitar, Heatran, specially defensive Excadrill, and Bisharp. Thunderbolt is another option that helps Mega Latias revenge kill the likes of Manaphy, Azumarill, and Volcanion while providing neutral coverage on most of the same Pokemon as Surf, and it is especially useful for hitting Water-types like Keldeo hard right off the bat if Mega Latias opts for Stored Power over Psyshock. It also helps to break Calm Mind Slowbro and Slowking with more ease than any of Mega Latias's other options because it hits both of these super effectively, and to discourage Mega Gyarados from setting up.</p> <p>Dragon Pulse can be used over Surf or Thunderbolt and is a decently powerful move with good neutral coverage on most Psychic-types and Dark-types in the tier while also dealing good damage to opposing Dragon-types, but it leaves Mega Latias easily taken advantage of by the many prominent Steel-types in OU such as Heatran, Mega Scizor, and Skarmory. Substitute and Refresh are additional options to help Mega Latias manage status and, in the case of Substitute, Pursuit better, but they force Mega Latias to run a mono-attacking Psyshock or Stored Power set, which leaves it as bait for the tier's Dark-types. Additionally, Reflect Type is an option in the final moveslot to help against Pursuit trappers and to set up more easily on Pokemon like Heatran and Ferrothorn, but it struggles to be effective for the same reasons as Substitute and Refresh: being forced to run single-move coverage. Reflect Type sets are also unable to reliably shield themselves from status, as in order to be immune to Toxic Mega Latias must first use Reflect Type on a Steel- or Poison-type Pokemon, and in order to be immune to burns Mega Latias must first use Reflect Type on a Fire-type Pokemon, and so on.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Calm Mind Mega Latias is a defensive sweeper, so maximum HP investment is used to make it take hits as comfortably as possible while setting up. Mega Latias has a great Speed tier, so maximum investment with a Timid nature is vital to take full advantage of it. This lets it outspeed threats like Terrakion, Keldeo, Garchomp, and Mega Pinsir while tying with Gengar, opposing Latias, Latios, and Mega Diancie. Latiasite is the chosen item to let Latias Mega Evolve and get a gargantuan boost in both Defense and Special Defense, making it much more effective as a Calm Mind sweeper.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Latias does not need to boost every time it is sent out. Pivoting Mega Latias in and out on the attackers it checks like Volcanion, Keldeo, Thundurus, and Mega Charizard Y while dealing some damage to its checks and counters as they come in with its Psyshock, Surf, or Thunderbolt is generally best as long as the opponent is capable of stopping a Mega Latias sweep. Sometimes it is also best to just Recover off the damage from the attackers that Mega Latias walls as they switch out so that Mega Latias does not get too worn down and put in the KO range of hits like Keldeo's Icy Wind or Thundurus's Hidden Power Ice. Being badly poisoned or paralyzed is extremely crippling for Mega Latias, the former leaving it unable to sweep effectively and the latter leaving it easily revenge killed, so it is best to avoid these status conditions at all costs. Burns are also frustrating for Mega Latias, forcing it to use Recover much more often and thus reducing how effective it is at carrying out its job. When boosting with Calm Mind, make sure not to boost more than is necessary to win the game. The more Mega Latias boosts, the more likely it is to be struck by a critical hit, potentially ending a sweep before it begins. Without Reflect Type or Substitute, this set is very vulnerable to Pursuit trappers, so it is important to be wary of Pokemon that commonly run Pursuit like Weavile and Tyranitar. The latter becomes significantly more deadly if equipped with a Choice Band, always 2HKOing Mega Latias with Pursuit even if it does not attempt to switch and OHKOing if it does.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Mega Latias set is best as a wincon for balanced and bulky offensive teams that appreciate the defensive utility it brings to the table. Many of its partners appreciate its ability to check powerful attackers like Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, Volcanion, Thundurus, Tornadus-T, and Mega Manectric while checking some of the Pokemon capable of halting a Mega Latias sweep. Gliscor can be a good partner, as it poses a threat to Clefable, Bisharp, and Mega Diancie while absorbing status for Mega Latias thanks to Poison Heal. Fighting-types like Terrakion and Keldeo are good partners as well for their ability to check threatening Dark-types like Bisharp and Tyranitar. Terrakion has the bonus of taking advantage of Pursuit trappers with Justified, especially when holding a Choice Band, while Keldeo can reliably switch into Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Weavile and also checks Mega Scizor. Suicune threatens Pokemon like Weavile, Mega Scizor, and Bisharp while being able to phaze them with Roar if they attempt to set up and absorb status with Rest. Clefable can check Pokemon like Kyurem-B, Mega Diancie, Latios, and Weavile while spreading paralysis to many of their shared checks like Jirachi and Bisharp with Thunder Wave. Skarmory and Ferrothorn check threats like Mega Diancie, Mega Gardevoir, and Latios while setting up Spikes to wear down several Pokemon like Tyranitar and Bisharp that check Mega Latias. Skarmory has the advantage of handling Weavile, Bisharp, and Mega Scizor, while Ferrothorn can check Choice Band Azumarill.</p> <p>Heatran is a viable partner that can beat Ferrothorn, Clefable, and Mega Scizor while setting Stealth Rock and is able to take Will-O-Wisp and Toxic for Mega Latias. Zapdos checks Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Mega Pinsir, and Jirachi while more reliably checking Life Orb Tornadus-T and providing Defog support. Tyranitar is another Pokemon that partners well with Mega Latias due to it checking Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, and opposing Latios and Latias. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Tyranitar also becomes able to check Mega Gardevoir, revenge kill Bisharp with Superpower, and Pursuit trap Gengar. Sand Rush Excadrill with Sand Stream support brings offensive presence to the table in the form of a dangerous revenge killer capable of taking on threats like Mega Diancie, Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, Kyurem-B, and Weavile for Mega Latias and as such is a fantastic choice for a partner. Hippowdon can check Mega Charizard X, Bisharp, and Mega Lopunny while also setting Stealth Rock to wear down the opposing team. Amoonguss alleviates some pressure from Mega Latias to take on Keldeo + Pursuit cores and checks Choice Band Azumarill, Mega Altaria, Clefable, and maximum Special Attack variants of Mega Diancie, and it can help to halt a Mega Gyarados sweep with Spore. Finally, Choice Scarf Landorus-T is a partner with offensive presence that provides a way to revenge kill various physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Mega Metagross, and Jirachi for Mega Latias while grabbing momentum for the team with U-turn.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Latias's solid Speed stat, good bulk, and amazing utility options make it a solid user of dual screens, providing a safer environment for its offensive teammates to set up. Reflect lowers the damage taken from physical attacks from Pokemon like Mega Metagross and Mega Lopunny, while Light Screen lowers the damage taken from special attacks from Pokemon like Keldeo and Mega Alakazam. Healing Wish allows Latias to sacrifice itself to give a teammate a second chance to sweep. Defog is useful for removing entry hazards and opposing dual screens. Finally, Safeguard allows Latias's teammates to set up without fearing being afflicted by status conditions.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread allows Latias to be as fast and as bulky as possible, letting it outspeed Keldeo, as well as Speed tying Mega Metagross, Mega Diancie, and opposing Latias, and survive as many hits as possible, granting it an extra opportunity to set up dual screens, use Defog, or use Healing Wish. Light Clay is necessary to increase the duration of dual screens.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Latias's goal is to set up dual screens to provide easier setup opportunities for its offensive teammates, making them tougher to take down. If only one of Reflect and Light Screen needs to be used, determine if the opposing team has more physical attackers or special attackers and set up accordingly. Latias can be preserved later to come back in and reset dual screens if they wear out, remove entry hazards with Defog, or use Healing Wish to heal a weakened teammate. Since this Latias set has no attacking moves, it must watch out for Taunt from faster Pokemon like Serperior, as they can force it to switch out, preventing it from fulfilling its roles. Latias should also be careful versus opposing setup sweepers, as they can find easy opportunities to set up and threaten its team, especially since this set lacks Thunder Wave. Latias must also be careful around Pursuit users such as Tyranitar, Weavile, and Bisharp; even with Reflect support, they can still punish Latias if it tries to switch out, making it more difficult to come back in and support its teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Latias set shines best on hyper offense teams, which appreciate the setup opportunities provided by dual screens and other utility options. A multitude of teammates such as Manaphy, Mega Altaria, Mega Gyarados, and Bisharp enjoy the support that dual screens provide, letting them set up more easily. Bisharp also has the benefit of beating Clefable and Slowbro one-on-one, acting as a dangerous revenge killer with Sucker Punch, chipping Pokemon like Ferrothorn with Knock Off, and deterring any attempts at removing dual screens with Defog thanks to Defiant. Teammates that are weak to hazards, such as Mega Charizard X and Volcarona, greatly appreciate the extra support that Latias's Defog provides. If Latias uses Safeguard instead of Defog, Taunt support from Pokemon like Serperior is very beneficial, as it can prevent hazards from being set up and prevent Pokemon like Mega Charizard X and Volcarona from setting up, and Serperior can provide additional dual screens support if Latias cannot find an opportunity to set them up and therefore finds better use in fulfilling its other utility roles instead.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Latias's most powerful attack, able to deal heavy damage to most Pokemon that don't resist it. Psyshock gives Latias a consistent form of damage output, allowing it to deal with Keldeo, Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Breloom while giving it a way to hit Fairy-types. Healing Wish allows Latias to remove all damage and status from one of its teammates, but it causes Latias to faint upon using it. Defog removes all entry hazards from the field, whereas Recover provides Latias a way of healing itself, granting it more staying power. Thunderbolt can be run over Psyshock, giving Latias a harder hit against Manaphy, Mega Charizard Y, and Azumarill while maintaining coverage on Keldeo. However, Latias will not be able to beat Mega Venusaur or Amoonguss.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The HP investment prevents Latias from being 2HKOed by Life Orb Thundurus's Hidden Power Ice, while 252 Speed and a Timid nature allow it to outrun Keldeo and Terrakion and Speed tie with Latios, Gengar, and other Latias. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack in order to give Latias more offensive power. Life Orb serves to improve Latias's damage output, with a slight cost to its health. If Thundurus isn't an issue, a spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe can be run to maximize Latias's offensive presence.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Latias is able to switch into Pokemon such as Keldeo, Manaphy, Thundurus, Mega Charizard Y, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss and check Breloom, Mega Manectric, and Rotom-W. Bear in mind that many of these Pokemon are commonly paired with Pursuit trappers, so be wary of a double switch or Volt Switch as Latias comes in. Defog should be used when you need to remove entry hazards from your own side of the field, but be aware if your opponent has a Bisharp or Thundurus because Defog triggers Defiant, which could prove dangerous. When running Recover, look for opportunities to use it against Pokemon that can't threaten Latias, as this will allow it to stay healthy throughout the match. When running Healing Wish, wait to use it until Latias is no longer needed or until a crippled teammate would be more useful to have healthy again. Using Healing Wish too early leaves the team without an answer to several potent attackers, so it's best to wait until they have been dealt with before getting rid of your answer to them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, Breloom, and Mega Heracross are able to beat Dark-types like Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Weavile for Latias. Fire- and Ground-types such as Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, Landorus-T, and Garchomp can help deal with Steel-types. Steel-types like Jirachi and Metagross are able to beat Fairy-types. In return, Latias provides a switch-in for bulky Water-types that these Pokemon typically dislike going up against. Fairy-types like Azumarill, Clefable, and Mega Gardevoir are able to beat opposing Dragon-types, which can heavily damage Latias. Setup sweepers appreciate Latias's ability to heal them up to full via Healing Wish, as this allows them to exert pressure early on without worrying about being crippled. Offensive powerhouses such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Swords Dance Mega Scizor, Tail Glow Manaphy, Swords Dance Talonflame, Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X, Swords Dance Bisharp, and Serperior can all take advantage of Latias's support.</p>"

  "Latios": {
    "overview": "<p>Latios resides in a great Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed and check many threats such as Garchomp and Keldeo. In addition, it has a great Special Attack stat, coupled with an extremely strong move in Draco Meteor, making it a great sweeper. It is versatile in the roles it fulfills because it has tons of utility and support moves in its arsenal such as Memento, Tailwind, and Defog and doubles as one of the best offensive Defog users in OU. Furthermore, a decent defensive typing allows Latios to comfortably absorb hits from the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Keldeo and, as a result, gives it ample opportunities to switch in. However, Latios is weak to the ubiquitous Knock Off and Pursuit, which is amplified by the increase of Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Steel-types such as Mega Metagross. Latios also resides in a crowded Speed tier and thus has to rely on Speed ties with opposing base 110s such as Mega Diancie and Gengar. Finally, it has underwhelming bulk, rendering it open to revenge killers and faster Pokemon such as Talonflame and Tornadus-T.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A lead set with Light Screen and Reflect is decent for offensive-natured teams because Latios has high Speed and forces many switches. Memento is a good utility move, crippling Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Scizor, as well as physical attackers such as Mega Metagross, before Latios goes down. Dragon Pulse is an option over Draco Meteor if the latter's secondary effect is undesirable, but this comes at the cost of significant power. Grass Knot allows Latios to beat Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types such as Hippowdon, Tyranitar, and Mega Gyarados without needing to resort to Draco Meteor. Hidden Power Fighting hits Dark-types on the switch, scoring an OHKO on Bisharp and a 2HKO on Tyranitar; however, it deals laughable damage to Ferrothorn and Heatran, and, similarly to Hidden Power Fire, forces Latios to drop one Speed IV and thus leaves it outsped by base 110s such as Gengar, Latias, and Mega Diancie. Recover can be used on Life Orb sets to improve Latios's longevity and aid it in checking threats such as Keldeo and Mega Manectric.</p> <p>Heal Block denies Latios's usual checks and counters such as Chansey and Clefable their recovery, effectively crippling them, allowing Latios to repeatedly hammer away at them with Psyshock. Tailwind doubles Latios's teammates' Speed for four turns and is extremely useful for slower Pokemon such as Scizor and Kyurem-B or against faster teams with the likes of Mega Lopunny and Mega Aerodactyl. Colbur Berry allows Latios to avoid being revenge killed by Dark-types such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Weavile by tanking the hit and retaliating with a move of its own, but running it means Latios loses power compared to when it uses other item options. Refresh prevents Latios from being worn down by status, particularly burns caused by Keldeo's Scald, and also lets Latios stallbreak much more effectively. Finally, Latiosite gives Latios a boost in its defenses, which allows it to check special and physical attackers alike more easily, but Mega Latios has less power than Life Orb Latios and prevents you from using other, potentially more useful, Mega Evolutions.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Tyranitar and Bisharp are great at taking on Latios, as the former has enough bulk to stomach even two consecutive Draco Meteors and OHKOes Latios with Crunch or traps it with Pursuit, while the latter can play mind games with Latios through Sucker Punch or Knock Off. Weavile also outspeeds Latios and can pick it off very easily if it runs Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Altaria all boast an immunity to Draco Meteor, have the bulk or typing to take a Psyshock, and can retaliate with a STAB Fairy-type move. Clefable and Mega Altaria can use Latios as setup fodder with Calm Mind and Dragon Dance, respectively, while Mega Gardevoir outright OHKOes with Hyper Voice.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Celebi, Jirachi, and Cresselia can avoid a 2HKO from any attack because of their good bulk and typing, even Calm Mind-boosted attacks in the case of Jirachi, and proceed to PP and Life Orb stall Latios with recovery or cripple it with paralysis. However, they must watch out for Shadow Ball, though the move is less common.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn, Klefki, and Mega Scizor can take any of Latios's attacks bar Hidden Power Fire; the former can stall it out with Leech Seed, the middle can use Latios as setup fodder for Light Screen, Reflect, and Spikes, and the latter can set up with Swords Dance or simply use Bullet Punch to quickly wear Latios down. Assault Vest Metagross is another very solid answer to Latios as it avoids the 2HKO even from Hidden Power Fire variants.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Due to Chansey's great bulk, it can take all of Latios's moves easily, even Psyshock when at high health, and wear Latios down with Seismic Toss and Toxic and recover any damage lost with Soft-Boiled. However, Chansey is worn down quite a bit by Calm Mind-boosted attacks.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Latios is prone to revenge killing because its bulk really isn't that great, and fast and powerful Pokemon such Choice Scarf Knock Off Landorus-T, Talonflame, Thundurus, Choice Scarf Garchomp, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar are prime examples. Latios is especially vulnerable to revenge killing after using Draco Meteor, as the Special Attack drop makes it much easier for bulky Pokemon such as Mega Altaria, Mew, and Mega Gyarados to set up on Latios, stall it out, or outright KO it.</p>",

      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Latios's strongest move, dealing great damage to Pokemon that don't resist it such as Thundurus and Slowbro. Psyshock allows Latios to threaten specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Clefable, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T by hitting their weaker Defense stat. However, Psyshock can be dropped for other coverage moves such as Hidden Power Fire if Psyshock is not necessary on the team if the likes of Clefable, Mega Venusaur, and Chansey are covered. Defog provides invaluable support to teammates so that their health is not chipped away by entry hazards. Surf allows Latios to deal heavy damage to Heatran, Mega Diancie, and Tyranitar, while also being able to deal solid damage to the likes of Hippowdon and Gliscor without being forced to use Draco Meteor which eventually forces Latios to switch out. Hidden Power Fire deals with some Steel-types such as Scizor and Ferrothorn, but it comes at the cost of lowering Latios's Speed IV by one point, leaving it outsped by base 110s such as Gengar and Latias. Thunderbolt allows Latios to beat bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Manaphy, and Gyarados more easily without resorting to Draco Meteor and hits Skarmory super effectively. Earthquake is another option that can net the OHKO on Heatran, but Surf is generally better otherwise. Thunder Wave paralyzes and cripples faster Pokemon like Tornadus-T as well as others that attempt to set up on Latios after Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop, such as Bisharp and Mega Gallade.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature in tandem with maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs ensures that Latios Speed ties with opposing base 110s while hitting as hard as possible. Life Orb is the best item to use for this set, as it provides immediate power without locking Latios into a move. If running Earthquake, a Hasty nature should be used to guarantee the OHKO on Heatran after Stealth Rock; it should be chosen over Naive so that Latios can check special attackers such as Mega Manectric, Manaphy, and Keldeo better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Latios's ample resistances, including ones to common Water-, Fire-, and Electric-type attacks, and nifty Ground-type immunity grant it a plethora of opportunities to switch in; it fits great on balanced builds due to its ability to check a lot of Pokemon threatening to the playstyle, such as Keldeo. This set should be used in a hit-and-run style, using its good Speed to quickly fire off powerful attacks, particularly Draco Meteor, and withdrawing afterwards due to the Special Attack drop. If a switch into a Latios check such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, or Ferrothorn is obvious, it is good to use the respective coverage moves to deal damage to them on the switch, such as using Earthquake on a switch to Bisharp. Play carefully if the opponent possesses Pursuit users such as Bisharp and Tyranitar, and scout for coverage moves on various Pokemon such as Icy Wind Keldeo before letting Latios check them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Mega Lopunny are great at removing Dark-types such as Tyranitar, Weavile, and Bisharp, which cause problems for Latios. Keldeo is an exceptional teammate, dealing with the aforementioned Dark-types and various other Latios checks such as Heatran, Chansey, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Pokemon that can take on Fairy-types such as Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Sylveon, such as Mega Metagross and Mega Scizor, are great teammates. In particular, Mega Scizor counters Mega Metagross, Ferrothorn, and Chansey and checks most Fairy-types.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Latios's strongest STAB move and deals incredible damage to even targets that resist it. Psychic is the preferred secondary STAB move, as it has good neutral coverage, notably 2HKOing Bold Clefable and having a favorable chance against Calm variants. It's also Latios's most reliable option, as it does not lower its Special Attack like Draco Meteor. Psyshock is an alternative to have a chance to 2HKO Chansey after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes while still being able to 2HKO Calm Clefable. Surf provides great coverage alongside Latios's STAB moves, hitting key targets such as Heatran and Tyranitar. Hidden Power Fire is an alternative to OHKO Scizor and Ferrothorn, as well as heavily chip away at Jirachi. Trick lets Latios cripple defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Chansey. If Trick isn't necessary, extra coverage can be used over it in order to give Latios a better matchup against more balance-inclined teams. Sleep Talk also gets a mention for enabling Latios to switch into Breloom's and Amoonguss's Spore while being able to maintain its offensive presence.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread plus a Timid nature maximizes Latios's offensive capabilities while taking advantage of its excellent Speed tier. Choice Specs turns Latios into a powerhouse that punches holes versus just about any team.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best played as a hit-and-run wallbreaker, using its set of resistances to switch in and proceed to obliterate the opposition with either of its STAB attacks. If necessary, Latios can serve as a switch-in to Pokemon such as Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y by virtue of its typing. Due to a lack of recovery, however, Latios should be played more carefully with what it switches into, as it can find itself getting pressured by the aforementioned threats very easily. As such, Latios should generally be brought in either through pivot support or on aggressive double switches. Be wary of using Psychic if the opponent has a Dark-type, particularly Tyranitar, as it can come in and trap Latios, eliminating it as a threat. A similar scenario can happen with Draco Meteor if Fairy-types are present, as a wrong prediction results in a massive loss of momentum. Latios should use its coverage moves if the opponent's switch-in to a resisted hit is obvious. If running Trick, it's typically best to use it against stall teams to cripple the likes of Chansey, Jirachi, and Skarmory, making it much easier for teammates to break down the opposing team. Against more offensive teams, however, Latios should generally not use Trick, as losing the power boost from Choice Specs is fairly detrimental.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to the inherently offensive nature of Choice Specs and the absence of recovery, Latios tends to fit on very offensive teams that appreciate its wallbreaking capabilities and can regain tempo that may be lost by being locked into the wrong move. As a result of this, cleaners such as Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T benefit most from Choice Specs Latios's wallbreaking proficiency. Landorus-T and Tornadus-T also provide a way for Latios to potentially switch in unscathed with their access to U-turn, which is very useful for this set due to its lack of recovery. Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Mega Heracross beat Dark-types with ease and are able to overwhelm shared checks, specifically Clefable. Keldeo in particular appreciates Latios's ability to soft check Electric-types, while Keldeo is capable of threatening Heatran in addition to the aforementioned Dark-types. Heatran provides Stealth Rock support, sports great synergy alongside Latios, and is able to handle opposing Steel-types while putting pressure on Tyranitar and Clefable with Lava Plume burns and Taunt, respectively. Other special attackers like Alakazam, Hydreigon, and Manaphy are able to overwhelm defensive threats, capitalizing on Latios's wallbreaking capabilities. Belly Drum Azumarill gets a special mention for being able to take advantage of Pursuit trappers that plague Latios, netting a free opportunity to set up and possibly sweep.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is incredibly strong even without a boost and thus is Latios's main move for revenge killing. Psyshock allows Latios to slip past specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Assault Vest users such as Raikou, which can stomach a Draco Meteor comfortably. The choice between Defog and Hidden Power Fire really boils down to necessity and practicality; Defog removes entry hazards from the field in a pinch and can be used more reliably after Tricking Latios's Choice Scarf to a foe, providing invaluable support to teammates that despise being worn down by entry hazards, while Hidden Power Fire deals with Ferrothorn and (Mega) Scizor, as well as bulky Grass-types such as Celebi, without resorting to Draco Meteor. Trick allows Latios to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Celebi, and Clefable by locking them into only one move. Recover is an alternate to Defog if Defog support is not needed; it also increases Latios's longevity, which this set lacks, and helps Latios check Pokemon such as Keldeo and Celebi more easily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Because this set is focused on revenge killing, maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature is used to let Latios hit as hard and be as fast as possible. A Choice Scarf lets Latios outpace most of the metagame and function as a good revenge killer.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Play carefully, because this set is incredibly prone to being locked into an undesirable move such as Psyshock on Dark-types and then being Pursuit trapped. As this set lacks reliable recovery most of the time, it is easily worn down by repeatedly switching into Pokemon such as Keldeo, so Latios should be preserved as best as possible. This set is capable of crippling any wall that can avoid a 2HKO from Latios, so you should prioritize saving Trick for them, though you can also use this strategy on a setup sweeper such as Nasty Plot Thundurus. Choice Scarf Latios is best played as a revenge killer, outspeeding many fast threats such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Manectric, Mega Aerodactyl, and Tornadus-T.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard X, and Crawdaunt are great teammates for Choice Scarf Latios to wear down the opposing team so that Latios can pick them off late-game using its high Speed. Mega Scizor pairs great with Latios as well, boasting the ability to counter Mega Metagross and Ferrothorn, wear down the opposing team with a combination of Swords Dance and Bullet Punch, and check most Fairies, while in return Latios checks Keldeo. Keldeo is a great partner too, as it checks Dark- and Steel-types such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, Weavile, and Heatran for Latios and the burns it induces on the opposing team wear them down for Latios to pick them off late-game. Pivots, both defensive and offensive alike, such as Rotom-W and Tornadus-T, are great at giving Latios free opportunities to switch in.</p>"

      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic lets Mega Latios hit Fairy-types such as Clefable and Mega Diancie and hits Fighting-types like Mega Lopunny, Keldeo, and Terrakion for super effective damage. Earthquake deals with Pokemon that normally switch into Mega Latios's STAB combination, OHKOing Heatran and 2HKOing Tyranitar after Stealth Rock damage. Draco Meteor is Mega Latios's strongest STAB move and deals significant damage to neutral targets, even OHKOing offensive Pokemon such as Mega Medicham and Landorus-T. Roost increases Mega Latios's longevity, allowing it to switch into offensive threats such as Keldeo, Volcanion, and Heatran more reliably.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Naive nature with 252 Speed EVs allows Mega Latios to fully utilize its Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed many threats like Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard Y, Mega Charizard X, and offensive Garchomp without compromising Earthquake's power. A Naive nature is chosen over Hasty to make Mega Latios less vulnerable to priority users and gives it better odds against Pursuit trappers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thanks to its good coverage, Mega Latios can hit a lot of different targets. Earthquake can be a surprise factor to catch Heatran off guard or hit Dark-types like Tyranitar and Bisharp on the switch. After the Special Attack loss from Draco Meteor, Earthquake can be particularly useful. Mega Latios's good bulk and typing allow it to absorb Water-, Fire-, and Fighting-type moves and sustain itself with Roost. When faced with Pursuit trappers, Mega Latios should be used with caution. With the Naive nature, it has to be a bit more cautious against special attackers, despite not having to fear anything specific.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone is a good partner for Mega Latios, removing bulky Steel-types that are not threatened by Earthquake, such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Due to Mega Latios's potency as a wallbreaker, sweepers such as Volcarona, Hidden Power Fire Serperior, and Talonflame benefit from its ability to punch holes through teams. Pokemon that can set up entry hazards such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn make great teammates, helping weaken Pursuit trappers like Weavile and Tyranitar. Because Mega Latios can surprise Excadrill with Earthquake and therefore remove it from the game, hazard stacking is a potent strategy for Mega Latios teams.</p>"

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic hits Fighting-types like Keldeo, Terrakion, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny, as well as Poison-types like Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. It also lets Mega Latios hit Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Diancie. Draco Meteor is Mega Latios's most powerful move, dealing a lot of damage to neutral targets. Roost provides Mega Latios with the necessary longevity. The last move is flexible, since Mega Latios can run a variety of options. Defog allows it to provide entry hazard removal for its team, while Calm Mind lets it take the role of a special attacking setup sweeper. Hidden Power Fire allows Mega Latios to deal with Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Magnezone, and Ferrothorn and provides valuable chip damage on Bisharp. Lastly, Surf allows Mega Latios to deal with Heatran and Gliscor while also providing chip damage to Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Mega Diancie.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Mega Latios to utilize its 110 Speed tier to the fullest. 252 Special Attack EVs guarantee the best possible damage output, giving Mega Latios enough power to threaten a 2HKO on Clefable with Psychic with Leftovers removed or minimal prior damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Latios has good bulk that allows it to come in on several foes, especially on Fighting- and Water-types like Mega Medicham, Keldeo, and Volcanion. Once Mega Latios is in, it can fire off its powerful STAB moves. Another option is to use Mega Latios as a defensive option, utilizing Roost to stay healthy and Defog to keep entry hazards off the field. Using this strategy can allow Mega Latios to clean up later in the game, especially when Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar and Weavile are beaten and bulky Steel-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and specially defensive Excadrill are weakened.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone synergizes well with Mega Latios, since it removes bulky Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor from the game. Other helpful teammates include options that can pressure Pursuit trappers. This includes Pokemon like Thundurus, Will-O-Wisp Rotom-W, and Rocky Helmet Landorus-T, which can pivot with Volt Switch or U-turn, deal chip damage, or inflict the foes with a status. Keldeo resists Ice- and Dark-type moves, both of which are super effective against Mega Latios and therefore helps cover its weaknesses. Excadrill resists Fairy-type moves, is immune to Toxic and Thunder Wave, and switches in safely against Chansey, which completely walls Mega Latios.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Latios's most powerful attack, and while it may seem counterproductive to gain Special Attack just to lose it, the raw power of the move is what makes this set so difficult to wall. Psyshock is there to win Calm Mind wars with opposing Pokemon such as Clefable and Suicune and hits specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey and Assault Vest Raikou harder than Psychic does. Calm Mind lets Latios both hit hard and take special attacks more easily, improving its matchup against stall and balance and helping it wear down its usual checks such as Clefable, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn more easily. Recover improves Latios's longevity and replenishes health lost from entry hazards, status, weather, or direct damage sustained to ease setting up. Surf allows Latios to deal with Steel-types such as Heatran and Skarmory, as well as Tyranitar, without resorting to Draco Meteor and immediately being forced to switch out. Hidden Power Fire could be an option to let Latios get past Steel-types such as Jirachi, Scizor, and Ferrothorn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed maximizes Latios's sweeping potential. A Timid nature is used to Speed tie with opposing base 110s, such as Gengar, Mega Diancie, and Latias, as well as outpace slower Pokemon such as Garchomp, Manaphy, and Keldeo. Life Orb is used to augment the damage output of Latios's attacks significantly, and running 29 HP IVs and 4 Defense EVs minimizes Life Orb recoil. Latiosite could be used in place of Life Orb to increase Latios's bulk and prevent it from taking recoil, thus easing setting up, but at the expense of immediate power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because Latios naturally forces a lot of switches, it gets ample opportunities to set up with Calm Mind. Pokemon such as Keldeo and Slowbro are prime examples of Pokemon Latios easily forces out. With Calm Mind, Latios becomes increasingly hard to check with Pokemon such as Clefable and Heatran because they get worn down by repeated switches into Latios's boosted attacks, so don't be afraid to nuke Steel-type switch-ins that pose little-to-no threat to Latios, such as Heatran and Skarmory, with a boosted Draco Meteor. This set functions great as a wallbreaker, because after multiple boosts it is extremely difficult to switch into Latios. Keep Latios at decently high health with Recover to ease setting up, and prevent Latios from being worn down by status or damage sustained in the heat of battle.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Latios despises Dark-, Fairy-, and Steel-types, Pokemon that can effectively check these are prime partners; Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion check Dark- and Steel-types such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Heatran, and Terrakion also has a STAB Stone Edge to hit Fairies with. Fairy-types such as Clefable, Azumarill, and Sylveon also deal with Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Weavile and can weaken Steel-types and opposing Fairy-types for Latios; in Sylveon's case, it can lure in Ferrothorn and Skarmory and KO them with Hidden Power Fire. Mega Scizor pairs great with Latios as well, boasting the ability to counter Mega Metagross and Ferrothorn and check most Fairies, while in return Latios checks Keldeo. Wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Gallade aid Latios in breaking down some of its common checks and counters; they both deal with Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Empoleon through their respective STAB moves, and the former checks Fairy-types such as Clefable while the latter deals with Dark-types such as Tyranitar. Pivots, both offensive and defensive alike, such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Rotom-W, provide free, safe switches for Latios so it can set up Calm Mind more easily, and the repeated pivoting can chip away at some Latios checks.</p>"

  "Jirachi": {
    "overview": "<p>Jirachi's solid defenses and typing allow it to check Fairy-, Dragon-, and Psychic-types, such as Mega Diancie, Kyurem-B, Latias, Latios, Clefable, and Mega Alakazam, and it notably is one of the best switch-ins to Mega Gardevoir for bulky teams. Its movepool is huge, allowing it to take advantage of its balanced stats to perform a wide variety of roles. Defensive sets have plenty of support options to make use of, such as Wish and Body Slam, while offensive sets pack just enough power to make use of its wide coverage. On top of all this, Jirachi's incredible ability, Serene Grace, allows it to turn games around in conjunction with many of its attacks, including the notorious Iron Head. However, Jirachi's issues stem from its only average offenses, especially when uninvested, as its STAB attacks' mediocre power offer many opportunities for dangerous Pokemon to switch in such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Scizor, and Heatran. It also struggles to deal with common Pokemon like Rocky Helmet Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn if it isn't carrying the right coverage move.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave can be used to reliably paralyze foes, but this leaves Jirachi unable to cripple Ground-types. Jirachi gets Calm Mind, which can allow it to break through slower teams through its coverage; however, in general it struggles to break through defensive cores due to a lack of power and the resulting lack of coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran is Jirachi's hardest counter, resisting its STAB attacks and most of its common coverage moves. Outside of the rare Hidden Power Ground, the only thing Jirachi can do to Heatran is paralyze it with Body Slam or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Talonflame, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y generally have nothing to fear from Jirachi thanks to their typing, although they don't like being paralyzed by Body Slam or being worn down by Toxic. Talonflame and Mega Charizard are especially frightening as both get free set up opportunities against Jirachi.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Gliscor can typically switch into Jirachi and threaten heavy damage with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Scizor, Bisharp, and Magnezone have no trouble switching into Jirachi, though they must watch out for Fire Punch. The former two can use Jirachi as set up bait, while the latter can trap Jirachi due to Magnet Pull. Just note Jirachi can easily evade being trapped by Magnezone with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Manaphy are generally safe switch-ins, as Jirachi typically does not carry coverage for them, though they all are heavily cripple by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Although most don't resist Jirachi's attacks, Dark-types can prove extremely threatening. Bisharp is able to pick off Jirachi with Knock Off and Sucker Punch while also being able to stop it from switching out with Pursuit. Mega Gyarados isn't afraid of anything but Body Slam and can set up with Dragon Dance or knock out Jirachi with Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, and Rough Skin</strong>: Jirachi's main methods of dealing damage are all contact based, so it takes heavy damage from users of Iron Barbs, Rough Skin, and Rocky Helmet, most notably Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Skarmory.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Iron Head is Jirachi's main attacking move and is used to chip away at the Pokemon Jirachi walls. Additionally, thanks to Serene Grace, Iron Head has a 60% flinch chance, which is beneficial in Jirachi's matchup against slower Pokemon such as Clefable. Stealth Rock is a vital support move to have on every team, and Jirachi is an above-average setter of it thanks to its ability to take on the tier's most common Defogger, Latios. U-turn allows Jirachi to generate momentum for its team on predicted checks switching in while also dealing chip damage. Healing Wish is a fantastic support move that allows Jirachi to restore the HP of and cure any status condition on a teammate at the expense of Jirachi fainting. Toxic can be used over Healing Wish in order to cripple certain Pokemon that typically switch into Jirachi such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Slowbro. Body Slam is another alternative to Healing Wish and gives Jirachi a 60% chance to paralyze several other Pokemon that check it such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill. After its foes are paralyzed, Jirachi can attempt to paraflinch them to death with Iron Head. Body Slam is typically preferred over Thunder Wave for its ability to paralyze Ground-types and deal damage as well.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>32 Speed EVs are invested so that Jirachi can outpace Jolly Tyranitar. Various other more team-dependent Speed benchmarks may be used. For example, 80 Speed EVs are enough for Jirachi to outpace Adamant Diggersby, while 108 Speed EVs are enough for it to outspeed positive-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon like Volcanion and Breloom as well as neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Altaria. Maximum HP investment is used to increase Jirachi's overall bulk, and the remaining EVs are placed in Special Defense with a Careful nature to take on the likes of Mega Diancie, Latios, Clefable, and Mega Venusaur as effectively as possible. Leftovers is the item of choice, as Jirachi greatly appreciates the additional longevity it provides, especially considering that this set forgoes any means of reliable recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jirachi should be pivoted into Pokemon it checks such as Mega Diancie, Clefable, and Latios. At that point, it can proceed to attack with Iron Head, set up Stealth Rock, or use U-turn and pick up momentum. On predicted switches into a Jirachi check, typically it is best to set up Stealth Rock early-game in order to get chip damage on the opponent's Pokemon as they switch. If Stealth Rock is already set, using U-turn to pick up momentum is generally preferred. However, sometimes even without Stealth Rock up, the reward of using U-turn can be greater than that of setting up Stealth Rock, especially when Jirachi is paired with a powerful wallbreaker like Mega Medicham, which feasts on many of Jirachi's checks. Additionally, it is not recommended to use U-turn against opposing Pokemon that tend to carry Rocky Helmet such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, or Tangrowth when Jirachi is still needed to check threats like Clefable or Latios. Passive damage from Rocky Helmet combined with this set's lack of recovery wears Jirachi down quite fast, so hard switching is better in these situations. Healing Wish should be used when a teammate needs to be brought back to full HP or have a status condition cured in order to win the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Jirachi set is best used as a support for offensive teams. It works best paired with powerful wallbreakers that appreciate a slow U-turn, as well as sweepers that appreciate Healing Wish support. Keldeo and Mega Medicham are stellar examples of powerful wallbreakers to pair well with Jirachi, as both take advantage of U-turn, being able to smash common Jirachi switch-ins like Heatran, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn while also benefiting from Jirachi being able to take on the likes of Mega Diancie and Latios. Manaphy, Tornadus-T, and Mega Lopunny are all examples of Pokemon that are great partners for Jirachi due to their ability to thrive with Healing Wish support to give them another opportunity to run through a weakened team. Dragon-types such as Kyurem-B and Latios also pair well with Jirachi, because Jirachi threatens common checks to both such as Clefable, opposing Latios, and Mega Diancie. Garchomp especially appreciates these Pokemon being taken care of, as it can potentially set up with Swords Dance and sweep after their removal. One of Weavile's most common answers in Clefable can be taken out by Jirachi, while Weavile can take advantage of one of the most common defensive responses to Jirachi in Landorus-T. Mega Manectric can form a VoltTurn core with Jirachi while appreciating Jirachi handling the likes of Latios, Latias, and Clefable. Rotom-W is another great partner that checks some problematic Fire-types like Talonflame and Heatran while also checking most Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Sand Rush Excadrill, and in return, it likes Clefable, Latios, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss being taken care of by Jirachi. Finally, Landorus-T can prove itself to be a very versatile partner, checking Excadrill, Talonflame, Mega Charizard X, and Garchomp while also being able to provide speed control with Choice Scarf or work as a sweeper with Rock Polish and Swords Dance.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Iron Head is the move Jirachi will be using most of the time, due to its power and flinch chance. U-turn gives Jirachi a way of retaining momentum on predicted switch-ins, allowing it to get off damage and switch into a counter. Fire Punch lets it break past Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn. Heart Stamp gives Jirachi a way of beating Keldeo, Mega Charizard Y, and Raikou and deals more damage to Mega Venusaur, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Manectric. Healing Wish lets Jirachi heal its teammates to full health at the cost of its own life, which gives Jirachi something to do when it otherwise wouldn't be helpful. Trick allows Jirachi to punish some of its defensive switch-ins, locking them into a single move with a Choice Scarf and stealing their item.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs, when paired with a Choice Scarf and a Jolly nature, allow Jirachi to outrun every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, Speed tie with other base 100s at +1, and outrun slower Choice Scarf users such as Kyurem-B and Landorus-T. The Attack investment maximizes Jirachi's offensive potential.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Jirachi is used as a revenge killer, being able to outrun and take out Pokemon weak to its STAB attacks. Thanks to its typing and natural bulk, it's able to switch into Latios, Latias, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Diancie and eliminate them with Iron Head. Jirachi can use U-turn effectively in order to bait out its counters and allow its teammates to deal with them. Use U-turn or a coverage move when you predict your opponent to switch out, hitting the target with a coverage move when appropriate and pivoting out when not. If your opponent is using Rocky Helmet Garchomp to check Jirachi, it would be best to switch out directly rather than U-turn out, as the residual damage from Garchomp's Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin will wear down Jirachi very quickly. Healing Wish is generally more useful in situations where Jirachi is not helpful or where recovering another teammate is more useful than keeping Jirachi around, such as a wallbreaker in a match against a stall team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Healing Wish is a huge boon for most sweepers and wallbreakers, allowing them the possibility of a second attempt at their job if they get statused or heavily damaged early in a match. As a result, Jirachi pairs up nicely with a ton of offensive Pokemon. Pokemon that can deal with foes that resist Steel are extremely helpful, as their removal means that Jirachi can be much more threatening. Steel-types can be dealt with by a Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, or Garchomp; Water-types are vulnerable to Pokemon such as Serperior and Thundurus; Fire types can be removed by Keldeo or Gyarados. Ground-types are also a major issue for Jirachi, so teammates that can deal with them are a must. Azumarill, Keldeo, and Manaphy are great partners, as they also appreciate Jirachi's ability to switch into Latios and Latias. Jirachi is unable to break through defensive cores on its own, so partners that can weaken those cores are a necessity. Mega Gardevoir can put huge holes into defensive teams while crippling both its and Jirachi's checks with Will-O-Wisp. Manaphy is another option, as it can easily break through defensive cores with Tail Glow-boosted attacks. Other wallbreakers like Kyurem-B and Mega Pinsir make for good teammates as well, as they are both able to heavily pressure Ground- and Electric-types that Jirachi struggles with. Dark-types, such as Bisharp and Mega Gyarados, can prove threatening if Jirachi is locked into the wrong move. Having a teammate that can take them out, such as Breloom, can be extremely helpful. Entry hazard support helps Jirachi out a lot, making up for its average attacking power. Landorus-T can set up Stealth Rock and forms a U-turn core with Jirachi in order to help it break down its counters. Klefki is another option, being able to set up Spikes and paralyze Pokemon to allow Jirachi to immobilize them more effectively.</p>"

      "SubToxic": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Iron Head is Jirachi's method of stalling out its foes, relying on the 60% chance to flinch as a way of denying them the chance to threaten Jirachi or heal up. Toxic takes advantage of this by incrementally damaging its victim, allowing Jirachi to slowly wear down its targets and notably cripple Pokemon that would normally have little issue switching into Jirachi such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Garchomp. Substitute gives Jirachi a buffer against attacks and status and another way to stall out opposing Pokemon. Fire Punch provides coverage on Steel-types such as Scizor and Ferrothorn, which are immune to Toxic and resist Iron Head, preventing Jirachi from wearing them down over time.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The HP investment allows Jirachi to create 101 HP Substitutes, preventing them from being broken by Chansey's Seismic Toss. The Speed investment allows Jirachi to outrun positive-natured base 80s, such as Mamoswine and Mega Altaria. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack, allowing Jirachi to 2HKO defensive Mega Scizor and Excadrill with Fire Punch while also giving Iron Head a little bit more power behind it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using Toxic early on allows Jirachi to status its switch-ins as soon as possible and wear them out. After Jirachi has poisoned its switch-in, you can set up a Substitute on a predicted switch and begin making the switch-in flinch. The damage from Iron Head and Toxic poison will add up quickly and will allow Jirachi to break down its check while protecting itself from damage with flinches and the Substitute. Try to use Substitute sparingly when Jirachi is needed to check a specfic threat, as Jirachi will find itself quickly losing HP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set functions as a Fairy check, and as a result the likes of Dragonite, Kyurem-B, Latios, and Mega Lopunny will appreciate Jirachi's help. Landorus-T and Gliscor are able to switch into Excadrill and opposing Landorus-T. Of special note is Rocky Helmet Garchomp, as it is able to heavily damage Jirachi through Rough Skin's and Rocky Helmet's residual damage, meaning that it can KO Jirachi through its own Iron Heads. Faster Water-types, such as Keldeo and Starmie, as well as Slowbro and Rotom-W if they are able to break through Iron Head's flinch chance, are able to force Jirachi out. Mega Venusaur, Latios, and Latias are able to deal with all of them. Hippowdon is a great stop to Bisharp and Mega Charizard X, which are huge threats to Jirachi. Status is a major issue for this set, as a burn prevents Jirachi from healing with Leftovers and paralysis prevents it from making its targets flinch, so cleric support from Clefable or Chansey is a huge help.</p>"

Stealth Rock can be run in the last slot as well if the team is in need of a setter.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Attack investment ensures that Jirachi will be able to 2HKO Clefable with Iron Head while generally pumping up its offensive power. 216 Speed allows Jirachi to outrun neutral-natured Kyurem-B and everything slower. The remaining EVs and a Mild nature power up Jirachi's special moves, allowing it to hit its targets as hard as possible. Expert Belt helps boost the power of super effective hits without revealing Jirachi's item, allowing it to bluff another item, such as Choice Scarf. Alternatively, a Shuca Berry allows Jirachi to take Ground-type moves and land hits on faster Ground-types, such as offensive Garchomp and Choice Scarf Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set relies on Jirachi's coverage in order to tear apart defensive cores. Use the surprise factor in order to bait in typical switch-ins such as Garchomp and Ferrothorn. Pretending to be another set, such as the Choice Scarf set, can lead opponents into a false sense of security and open them up to a super effective hit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jirachi's coverage heavily depends on its teammates and what Jirachi can lure for them. Mega Lopunny loves having Garchomp and Landorus-T removed with Icy Wind. Gyarados appreciates Ferrothorn and Skarmory being removed through Hidden Power Fire. Mega Charizard X wants Quagsire, Landorus-T, and Slowbro out of the way, and the combination of Icy Wind and Energy Ball can allow Jirachi to remove all of them. Clefable and Scizor appreciate having Heatran removed, and running Hidden Power Ground can surprise and KO it. Jirachi is still able to switch in and deal with Dragon-, Fairy-, and Psychic-types as usual; however, this set runs less bulk than others and is thus much more prone to being worn down. As a result, pivots such as Rotom-W and Landorus-T that can bring Jirachi in safely are very helpful to prevent it from taking unnecessary damage.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Iron Head is Jirachi's primary form of damage output, taking advantage of the high Serene Grace-boosted flinch chance to stall out opposing Pokemon. Toxic gives Jirachi a way of damaging Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Rotom-W over the course of a match. Alternatively, Body Slam can be used to spread paralysis and prevent Jirachi from being setup fodder for Steel-resistant Pokemon and Taunt users. Wish allows Jirachi to heal its teammates and itself. Protect provides Jirachi with a way of guaranteeing that its Wish will land on itself, even in the face of offensively threatening Pokemon. Alternatively, U-turn allows Jirachi to maintain momentum on predicted switches, safely bring in Pokemon to receive a Wish, and escape from Magnezone.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>32 Speed EVs allow Jirachi to outrun Jolly Tyranitar and neutral-natured base 70s, such as Bisharp and Breloom. The remaining EVs and the Careful nature serve to improve Jirachi's special bulk, aiding it in taking on special attackers such as Latios and Mega Gardevoir. Leftovers serves as a form of passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jirachi's bulk and typing allow it to switch reliably into special attackers such as Mega Gardevoir, Latios, Mega Alakazam, and Clefable. From here, using a status move like Toxic or Body Slam allows Jirachi to wear down its switch-ins. Iron Head's flinch chance is very useful on a statused foe, either allowing Toxic damage to add up quickly or preventing the foe from attacking due to the combination of paralysis and flinches. Wish should generally be used on predicted switches and when Jirachi or a teammate is in need of healing. Use Protect in order to guarantee that Jirachi recieve its Wish without risk. Protect is also useful to stall out the foe with Toxic damage as well as scout for the foe's next move, which is especially useful for Pokemon that use Choice items.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jirachi is best paired with Dragon- and Fighting-type Pokemon, which struggle to deal with Fairy-types on their own. Pokemon such as Dragonite, Kyurem-B, Latios, and Mega Lopunny all appreciate Jirachi's support. Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Gliscor are able to manage Jirachi's weakness to Excadrill, opposing Landorus-T, and Garchomp. Similarly, Mega Charizard X and Heatran can deal with Steel-types such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn, which wall Jirachi. Keldeo, Starmie, Slowbro, and other Water-types can prove to be an issue as well, and teammates such as Mega Venusaur, Latios, and Latias are able to deal with them. Hippowdon is a great stop to Bisharp and Mega Charizard X, which are huge threats to Jirachi. Lastly, Jirachi is easily worn down when statused, so a cleric, such as Clefable or Chansey, can be useful.</p>"

  "Infernape": {
    "overview": "<p>While it may not be a popular choice in OU due to how much competition it suffers from other Fighting-type wallbreakers such as Keldeo and Terrakion as well as Fire-types like mixed Victini and bulky Mega Charizard X, Infernape still has a few tools at its disposal that make it a decent choice on certain teams. It sports a unique typing that, despite not being particularly good, enables it to check powerful threats like Bisharp, Weavile, and Scizor. It also has an outstanding movepool, with not only multiple coverage moves that give it the ability to deal significant damage to the vast majority of the OU tier, especially given its mixed offensive capabilities enabling it to break past both physical and special walls, but also a great support movepool, with moves like Slack Off, Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Stealth Rock. Unfortunately, while Infernape's typing and movepool are impressive, its stats are not. Its defenses are lacking, and while 104 / 104 / 108 offenses aren't bad, by ORAS standards they aren't very impressive either. Furthermore, Infernape's weaknesses to Water, Ground, Psychic, and Flying are all very crippling, given how common all of these types are in OU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Infernape is a very versatile Pokemon with many options at its disposal. It can be used as a Stealth Rock lead, with the distinction of being able to check Weavile, a Pokemon most suicide leads are very weak to. A Choice Scarf set allows Infernape to act as both as a fast revenge killer with the ability to keep up momentum and as a way to bait Psychic-types like Latios and Latias and hit them very hard with U-turn, gaining momentum in the process. It works very well with a Pursuit trapper, as Infernape can get it in safely against a Psychic- or Ghost-type, which its teammate can then Pursuit trap so that Infernape can much more easily clean with Close Combat later on in the battle. Infernape can also run a boosting set with either Swords Dance or Nasty Plot, both of which enable it to set up on Sableye as opposed to being walled by it. However, Infernape's poor bulk makes it very difficult for it to find opportunities to set up, and its lack of good priority options combined with its low Speed compared to that of most offensive threats makes it very easy to revenge kill. A Choice Band set can take advantage of a powerful U-turn, but its unremarkable Speed makes it hard for it to threaten offensive teams, and its inability to switch moves combined with its lack of raw power makes it difficult for it to pressure defensive teams, especially with its heavy reliance on Flare Blitz cutting its longevity. Encore can be used to provide setup opportunities for sweepers and lock defensive Pokemon like Slowbro and Hippowdon into their recovery move, while Fake Out can be used to break Focus Sashes and get chip damage on faster Pokemon; however, both are very hard to fit on Infernape's set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types that either resist Infernape's Fire-type STAB moves or have enough natural bulk to take it on act as good checks to it. Latios and Latias in particular easily outspeed and OHKO Infernape, only fearing U-turn on the switch. Starmie can also take Infernape on very well unless it switches into a super effective coverage move, Slowbro can counter any Infernape set that does not run Grass Knot, and Slowking can even take a Grass Knot well but fears Thunder Punch and U-turn. Mew can easily deal with any set provided it runs Psychic-type coverage, as it cannot beat faster variants that carry Taunt otherwise. Likewise, Reuniclus handles Infernape very well for the most part, even though it does take a large chunk of damage from Fire Blast. Victini is a decent check, though it does get outsped if it doesn't carry a Choice Scarf, takes a solid chunk of damage from Gunk Shot, and is 2HKOed by Stone Edge. Faster Psychic-types such as Alakazam and Mega Metagross can easily switch in on Infernape's Fighting-type STAB moves and OHKO back, even though all of these hate taking a Fire Blast or a Flare Blitz.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types can usually check Infernape decently, although most of them have a hard time switching in; Azumarill works particularly well thanks to its access to super effective priority, although it hates Gunk Shot and Will-O-Wisp. Suicune handles non-Grass Knot sets with ease thanks to its great bulk, as does Alomomola. Gyarados takes little damage from Infernape's most common moves thanks to Intimidate and its natural special bulk, but it dislikes Stone Edge and Thunder Punch. Tentacruel resists most of Infernape's coverage moves, but it lacks the physical bulk and recovery to take repeated Close Combats. Keldeo easily beats Infernape one-on-one and can even take a Close Combat relatively well thanks to its natural bulk, but it needs to win the Speed tie to actually switch into Infernape properly, unless it runs a Choice Scarf. Manaphy is bulky enough to switch into Infernape quite well and easily walls it with a Calm Mind set. Weather sweepers such as Kingdra and Kabutops make quick work of Infernape under rain, provided that they don't switch into a Close Combat. While uncommon, Jellicent acts as a decent answer to Infernape, although physically defensive variants fear Grass Knot and specially defensive variants take a lot of damage from Gunk Shot.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: While they do not necessarily resist either of Infernape's STAB types, Ground-types are generally very good checks to Infernape due to a combination of natural bulk and access to super effective STAB moves. Landorus-T and Gliscor can easily switch into a Close Combat and hit back with Earthquake, and Gliscor in particular is immune to burns and thus does not fear Will-O-Wisp. However, neither of these can handle a Life Orb-boosted Hidden Power Ice. Other Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Mega Swampert, Quagsire, and physically defensive Gastrodon can handle any set not running Grass Knot.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types are usually good answers to Infernape thanks to their resistance to Fire. Garchomp OHKOes Infernape with Earthquake and deals massive recoil damage back with Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet when hit by Close Combat; however, it dislikes Hidden Power Ice. Mega Altaria beats any set lacking Gunk Shot, while Dragalge resists almost all of Infernape's coverage moves bar the rare Earthquake but does not have the Defense or the recovery to take repeated hits. Dragonite takes Infernape on rather easily, only fearing the uncommon Hidden Power Ice, which is mitigated by Multiscale and can even be taken advantage of with a potential Weakness Policy, and it can even heal a burn if it runs a Lum Berry.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types serve as solid checks to Infernape as long as it is not running Stone Edge or Thunder Punch. Talonflame in particular can handle even Choice Scarf sets thanks to its priority Flying-type STAB moves. Tornadus-T can take both Close Combat and Fire Blast from Infernape and outspeed and OHKO back with Hurricane, while Mega Aerodactyl can take Infernape's Fire-type STAB moves and KO back with Aerial Ace provided it does not get burned.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: While they can rarely switch into its Fire-type STAB moves, Ghost-types serve as good checks to Infernape thanks to their Fighting immunity. Gengar completely shuts down defensive Infernape via Taunt, and it can outspeed and OHKO offensive sets with Sludge Wave. Hoopa can handle Infernape sets that do not carry Flare Blitz, although Fire Blast and Gunk Shot both deal a good chunk of damage to it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Infernape's primary STAB move, as it hits hard and has good neutral coverage. Fire Blast hits many Pokemon immune or resistant to Fighting, such as Sableye, Gengar, and Celebi. The fact that it inflicts special rather than physical damage also enables it to hit certain physically bulky Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Mega Manectric harder. Flare Blitz can also be used for its higher accuracy and its ability to hit Assault Vest Tornadus-T, Volcarona, and specially defensive Mew harder. However, the recoil damage it causes can be very problematic for Infernape when combined with Life Orb recoil, especially when going against the likes of Ferrothorn and weakened Garchomp. Gunk Shot is a must on this set, targeting Mega Altaria, Azumarill, Clefable, and Mega Gardevoir, the former two hard checking Infernape and the latter two beating it one-on-one otherwise. It also gives Infernape good neutral coverage on Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, Latios, Gyarados, Dragonite, and Starmie. Grass Knot enables Infernape to 2HKO Slowbro, a Pokemon that otherwise walls it, as well as hit specially defensive Hippowdon, Starmie, and Quagsire, all of which are very good checks and counters to Infernape otherwise. However, Hidden Power Ice can also be used in order to hit Garchomp, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Dragonite for a huge amount of damage. If Hidden Power Ice is run, Flare Blitz is preferred over Fire Blast because most Pokemon that are hit harder by Fire Blast than Flare Blitz are hit even harder by Hidden Power Ice. Mach Punch can be used as a way to revenge kill the likes of Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf Tyranitar as well as deal with Bisharp and Weavile more reliably, but Infernape generally prefers the coverage. Thunder Punch is a decent option for hitting Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y and also hits certain Water-types like Gyarados, Tentacruel, and Slowking harder than any other move, but Infernape has to sacrifice pretty important coverage for that. Finally, Stone Edge can be used for Flying-types in general, particularly Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Gyarados.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb gives extra firepower to both Infernape's physical and its special attacks. Blaze is the preferred ability on Infernape, as it gives its Fire-type STAB moves extra power when it's weakened. If Thunder Punch or Mach Punch is being used, Iron Fist is the better ability, as it powers up both those moves. A Naive nature enables Infernape to switch into the likes of Bisharp, Weavile, and Scizor while being as fast as possible and keeping both its offensive stats intact. The given spread enables Infernape to 2HKO standard Slowbro with Grass Knot while Speed tying with Keldeo and Terrakion. If 2HKOing Slowbro isn't too much of a concern and you want a more physically offensive spread, running 188 Atk / 68 SpA / 252 Spe enables Infernape to OHKO 0 HP / 4 Def Mega Altaria after Stealth Rock with Gunk Shot. If you run Hidden Power Ice, a spread of 124 Atk / 132 SpA / 252 Spe enables Infernape to OHKO Choice Scarf variants of Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used to clean through weakened teams after Pokemon that can revenge kill or counter Infernape are gone. Hence, it should usually be kept for the late-game. However, Infernape can also be used early on in the battle to lure and KO certain threats to your team. For example, if you want Slowbro removed for your Keldeo to sweep, you can send Infernape in mid-game and proceed to hit Slowbro with Grass Knot as it switches in. Be careful, though, as once you reveal a certain move, you will not be able to catch your opponent off guard again. Try to predict around certain checks to Infernape in order to be able to KO them. For instance, if your opponent has a healthy Slowbro, you will need to hit it with Grass Knot in order to 2HKO it, and Azumarill needs to be hit with Gunk Shot as it switches in or it will be able to check Infernape through Aqua Jet. However, the opponent may well have multiple checks to Infernape, and is therefore not guaranteed to send in the one you expect. He also may not send in any Pokemon at all, instead opting to sacrifice the Pokemon currently in if he feels like it isn't needed anymore. Therefore, be sure to predict your opponent's reaction based on their team. Use Infernape as a check to certain threats to your team, like Bisharp, Weavile, and Scizor. However, avoid switching it directly on these Pokemon because all of these can severely weaken Infernape; Weavile and Bisharp in particular can easily compromise its offensive capabilities by removing its Life Orb via Knock Off. If you need Infernape to stay healthy to clean more easily in the late-game, it's usually better to handle these threats differently if you can.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A good answer to Talonflame, Latios, and Latias, three of Infernape's best and most common checks, is a necessity. Pursuit Tyranitar is an excellent partner for these reasons, acting not only as a great Talonflame check but also as a reliable way to Pursuit trap Latios and Latias. Tyranitar can also Pursuit trap several bulky Psychic-types like Reuniclus, Cresselia, and Slowking, which can cause a lot of trouble for Infernape. Other Pursuit trappers like Bisharp and Weavile are also good partners for the same reasons, with Weavile's high Speed and access to priority helping a lot against the likes of Tornadus-T and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Depending on its moveset, Infernape will have a hard time breaking past certain Pokemon, so these Pokemon will need to be lured or weakened via entry hazards. For instance, Toxic Spikes support can severely weaken Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Slowbro, and Icy Wind Gengar can remove Gliscor, all of which can handle certain variants of this set. Certain Pokemon benefit from Infernape's ability to lure and KO certain threats and therefore make for good partners for it. For instance, Mega Charizard X appreciates Infernape's ability to eliminate Slowbro, Quagsire, Hippowdon, Azumarill, and Mega Altaria, all of which can check or counter Mega Charizard X. Infernape can have a hard time finding opportunities to switch in, so it pairs well with a slow Volt Switch user such as Rotom-W and U-turn users such as defensive Landorus-T. Celebi is a particularly good partner because it also easily takes care of the Ground- and Water-types that can check Infernape. Infernape can also very easily get worn down by Flare Blitz recoil, especially combined with Life Orb, and is vulnerable to paralysis and poison. Thus, a Healing Wish user can provide good support for it. Latias is a particularly good option, as it check certain Water-, Ground-, and Dragon-types that threaten Infernape, which, in return, takes care of Steel- and Dark-types, which pose a huge threat to Latias. Infernape should not be used as the team's sole check to Weavile or Bisharp, unless it runs Mach Punch, as it is 2HKOed by both of these Pokemon.</p>"
      },
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp disables physical attackers Infernape is supposed to check such as Scizor, cripples common switch-ins like Gyarados, Azumarill, Hippowdon, and Garchomp, and serves as a way of wearing down defensive Pokemon in general. Slack Off gives Infernape a good amount of longevity and enables it to consistently wall threats. Taunt disables defensive Pokemon like Clefable, Celebi, Mew, and Amoonguss by shutting down their recovery and utility moves and allows Infernape to stallbreak when combined with burn damage from Will-O-Wisp. Low Kick is the preferred offensive move on this set, as it hits Heatran, a very common Will-O-Wisp absorber, very hard. Close Combat can be used instead for more consistent power and much more damage against the likes of Rotom-W, Manaphy, and Diancie. However, the defense drops are detrimental to the defensive nature of this set. Flare Blitz can be used in order to OHKO Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Serperior, and Mega Scizor, 2HKO Skarmory, and deal far more damage to Clefable, Tornadus-T, and Mega Gardevoir as they switch in. However, this leaves Infernape completely helpless against Heatran, and the recoil damage it causes can be detrimental to a defensive set like this. Finally, Stealth Rock can be used over Taunt on this set if your team doesn't have another setter; however, this leaves Infernape very vulnerable to defensive Pokemon that it would much rather be able to handle, and it would enable Swords Dance Mega Scizor, a Pokemon Infernape is supposed to counter, to beat it instead.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Both of Infernape's abilities are worthless on the standard set. However, Blaze should be chosen if Flare Blitz is used, while Iron Fist should be used if Fire Punch is used. Leftovers gives Infernape passive recovery, increasing its defensive capabilities. The given spread enables Infernape to outspeed everything up to neutral-natured base 95 Speed Pokemon and positive-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon, all the while having enough physical bulk to avoid the OHKO from a burned Mega Gyarados's +1 Waterfall and the 2HKO from Hippowdon's Earthquake as well as enough special bulk to avoid the OHKO from Kyurem-B's Earth Power and Rotom-W's Hydro Pump. However, a faster spread of 252 HP / 48 Def / 208 Spe enables Infernape to outspeed and burn Garchomp and helps it check Mega Charizard Y by stalling out sun turns with a faster Slack Off.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Infernape should be sent in against the Steel-, Dark-, and Grass-types it counters, such as Bisharp, Scizor, and Weavile. It can also be sent in against defensive Pokemon in order to cripple them, but it must be wary of getting poisoned or paralyzed. Early on in the battle, Will-O-Wisp is a very safe move to use because it can easily cripple Pokemon that switch into it. If the opponent's answer to Infernape is already burned, using Will-O-Wisp can be a waste of time, so avoid doing it. Be sure to keep Infernape healthy by using Slack Off frequently, especially when it is weakened, so that it can consistently switch into threats to your team. Try to get Stealth Rock up before sending Infernape out, as its best checks are weak to it. This makes Will-O-Wisp even more of a risk-free move, as the main risk is that a Fire-type like Talonflame will absorb it, and in order to do so, it will have to take hefty damage from Stealth Rock. Taunt should be used against defensive Pokemon like Clefable and Celebi and entry hazard setters that can't threaten Infernape, such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and burned Garchomp or Hippowdon. It can also be used as a way to prevent slower setup sweepers from setting up, but Will-O-Wisp does this more safely and permanently, making it almost always a better move to use in that scenario.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Infernape set fits well on defensive teams that require a bulky Fire-type with stallbreaking capabilities that can also act as a check to certain Dark-types and Steel-types such as Bisharp, Weavile, Scizor, and Heatran, as well as a Knock Off and burn absorber. Mega Sableye completely shuts down this set, so Infernape needs support from a Mega Sableye counter. Clefable is particularly good, as it also handles Latios and Latias, two very good answers to Infernape. Jirachi's ability to handle the two as well as Gardevoir and Diancie, two big threats to Infernape, makes it another good partner. Most Fire-types easily switch in on Infernape because they can absorb Will-O-Wisp, so Infernape needs support from a good answer to Fire-types, be it a Water-type like Slowbro or Quagsire or a Dragon-type like Latias or Mega Altaria. Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Celebi, and Serperior can also make for good Infernape partners, as they check Water-types that pose a huge threat to Infernape.</p>"

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon has a useful niche as a defensive Pokemon in the OU metagame, boasting an excellent defensive typing, decent bulk, a Water immunity due to Storm Drain, and reliable recovery. Due to these traits, it can handle a multitude of common OU threats, including Keldeo, Thundurus, non-Grass Knot Mega Metagross, Mega Manectric, and Rotom-W, and is quite possibly the best answer in existence to powerful Swift Swim users in the rain. Unfortunately, Gastrodon's raw bulk is not exactly outstanding, leaving it unable to tank hits from Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny with even full defensive investment. It also faces some competition with other bulky Ground- and Water-types for a teamslot; though Gastrodon has a unique niche, it can be difficult to justify using it in lieu of other options at times.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Clear Smog can remove stat boosts from sweepers, but it is rather weak and has no purpose other than this. Offensive Life Orb or Choice Specs sets are options as Gastrodon has a usable Special Attack stat, but they are mostly outclassed by wall Gastrodon. Yawn can force switches or induce sleep. Stockpile skyrockets Gastrodon's defenses, but it fails to find a space on Gastrodon's moveset.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn take very little damage from Gastrodon's attacks, OHKO with their respective STAB moves, and are immune to poison. More offensive Grass-types such as Breloom and Serperior can switch in on Gastrodon's STAB combination, but the former doesn't appreciate being burned by Scald. Celebi is the best answer thanks to Natural Cure ridding it of burns from Scald or poison.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Chansey take pitiful amounts of damage from Gastrodon's attacks. Also, Toxic doesn't cripple Chansey due to Natural Cure.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Latios can break through Gastrodon. Thundurus and Mega Charizard Y can hit Gastrodon hard with Grass Knot and Solar Beam, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Due to its low base Defense, Gastrodon tends to be overwhelmed by powerful physical attackers such as Choice Azumarill, Dragonite, and Mega Lopunny, all of which can 2HKO.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald can cripple potential switch-ins and limits physical attackers with burns. Earthquake is preferred over Earth Power because it deals more damage to Calm Mind Keldeo, Mega Alakazam, and Heatran, but Earth Power can also be nice, as Gastrodon tends to take burns from Rotom-W. Recover is necessary, as it allows Gastrodon to keep itself healthy throughout the match. Clear Smog prevents setup from Pokemon like Calm Mind Clefable, Calm Mind Slowbro, and Nasty Plot Thundurus. Toxic can be used over Clear Smog to help reduce Gastrodon's passivity, punishing switch-ins like Serperior and Manaphy more consistently.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Defense investment allows Gastrodon to take on special threats like Heatran, Thundurus, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Diancie, and a Sassy nature is used in order to not weaken Earthquake. Storm Drain grants it a useful immunity to Scald as well as other Water-type moves. Alternatively, an EV spread of 248 HP / 48 Def / 212 SpD allows Gastrodon to always survive +1 Dragon Claw from Adamant Mega Charizard X and two Secret Swords from non-Choice Specs Keldeo after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>By virtue of its great typing and solid bulk, Gastrodon acts as a great check to special attackers like Heatran, Mega Diancie, and Volcanion. Gastrodon is best used making use of its immunity to Volt Switch, switching into Pokemon like Zapdos and Magnezone with little risk and being able to completely shut down Rotom-W with Storm Drain. Gastrodon relies on its immunities and pivoting in order to use to its full potential due to its good but not amazing bulk. Gastrodon does struggle with a few things, namely Toxic, Grass-types like Serperior and Amoonguss, special moves that hit defense—namely Secret Sword and Psyshock—and physical threats. Make sure to scout Toxic and Grass-type moves from the likes of Heatran, Volcarona, Zapdos, and Volcanion. Another flaw Gastrodon has is its passivity issue, which creates openings for the likes of Gliscor and Clefable to take advantage of it and potentially overwhelm it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Good teammates for Gastrodon include Pokemon that can switch into Grass-type attacks comfortably, like Heatran, Tornadus-T, and Talonflame. Pokemon immune to Toxic, like Gliscor, Clefable, Chansey, and Steel-types, are also helpful. Skarmory is a great example of a synergistic teammate to Gastrodon, as it is immune to poison and can take on Grass-type attacks. Its high Defense is also complementary to Gastrodon's specially defensive set.</p>"
      },
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Curse boosts Gastrodon's Attack and Defense, allowing it to become a threatening setup sweeper. Curse is used over Toxic to allow Gastrodon to act as a bulky wincon that is capable of handling threats such as Calm Mind Slowbro and Suicune, as well as preventing Clefable from coming in freely. Scald is used over Waterfall, as the ability to burn specific checks, such as Ferrothorn, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Scizor, further improves Gastrodon's chances of sweeping. Waterfall is a viable option should your team struggle with Gliscor or Nasty Plot Thundurus. Recover heals off damage that Gastrodon has taken throughout the battle.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread allows Gastrodon to switch into Life Orb Alakazam, Mega Diancie, and Life Orb Thundurus without Grass Knot or Nasty Plot, while the rest of the EVs are placed into Defense to help Gastrodon shrug off physical attacks more easily. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Relaxed nature is a viable option should your team struggle with Keldeo, as this spread has a good chance to avoid the 2HKO from a boosted Keldeo's Secret Sword after Stealth Rock. This EV spread, however, makes Gastrodon a poor switch-in to powerful special attackers such as Alakazam and Mega Diancie. Storm Drain gives Gastrodon an immunity to Water-type attacks, notably Scald. Leftovers is the item of choice, as this gives Gastrodon passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using Scald early and often is a good strategy should Gastrodon be at a good health. Burning potential threats and switch-ins not only eases Gastrodon's time sweeping later in the game but also helps it wear down the opposing team. If the opponent has a Grass-type with Natural Cure or Regenerator, Scald might not be your best bet, as the foe can shrug off a burn and force Gastrodon out. Keep Gastrodon at a high health whenever possible to allow it to continuously switch into opposing Pokemon. If the opponent doesn't have a Pokemon that requires Gastrodon to set upto beat, such as Clefable or Suicune, then it might be wise to wait and reveal Curse later in the game when the opponent might not expect it. Be careful not to let Gastrodon get statused, as this not only eliminates Gastrodon's chances of sweeping but also prevents it from checking a lot of Pokemon it could otherwise.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire- and Flying-types, such as Heatran, Talonflame, Tornadus-T, Skarmory, and both Mega Charizard formes, are viable options alongside Gastrodon, as they are capable of reliably switching into Grass-types that can scare Gastrodon out. Latios can switch into some Grass-types, such as Mega Venusaur, and check Keldeo, which will allow Gastrodon to run its usual EV spread over one to check Keldeo. Fairy- and Steel-types such as Clefable, Mega Altaria, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor are good options, as Recover Latios is a problem no matter what Gastrodon's EV spread is. Clerics and status absorbers, such as Clefable and Mega Altaria, can absorb status ailments that would otherwise cripple Gastrodon. Mega Sableye is another good teammate, as it can neutralize Ferrothorn and reliably switch into it. Mega Sableye also struggles against Pokemon such as Keldeo and Mega Diancie, both of which Gastrodon can handle depending on its EV spread.</p>"

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is a Water-type STAB move that has a high chance to burn, which is good for crippling physical threats. Earthquake is a Ground-type STAB move that hits Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Keldeo for good damage; it is preferred over Earth Power because it doesn't have to worry about being unable to break Keldeo's Calm Mind-enhanced Substitutes. Ice Beam is an alternative that hits Garchomp and Dragonite decently hard. Toxic is ideal for a wall such as Gastrodon, as it slowly wears at the opponent's Pokemon. Recover is reliable recovery, and it helps rack up Toxic damage. Counter is an option to prevent Gastrodon from being overwhelmed easily by physical attackers, as it can usually tank at least one hit and proceed to net a surprise KO with Counter.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs max out Gastrodon's HP, adding to its bulk, while 252 Defense EVs with a Relaxed nature max out its Defense to handle threats such as Keldeo. Storm Drain gives an immunity to Water-type attacks, with a situational boost to Special Attack. Leftovers provides passive recovery. A Relaxed nature should be run if Earthquake is used.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gastrodon best functions as a physical wall that stays in to burn physical attackers or stall with Toxic to cripple foes. While Gastrodon is still healthy, use Scald early-game to possibly get a burn on its checks. Recover is best used to rack up Toxic damage on opposing Pokemon and should be used to ensure it stays healthy. Gastrodon can switch into a predicted Water-type attack and get a free Special Attack boost, which guarantees Ice Beam OHKOes Garchomp. Gastrodon can also take hits from most physical attackers, so stay in on a physical attack and either attempt to burn the physical attacker with Scald or cripple it with Toxic. However, be wary when facing hard hitting attackers such as Choice Band Azumarill, as Play Rough 2HKOes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>With Sludge Bomb, Mega Venusaur can counter opposing Grass-types, such as Breloom and Serpeior, both of which threaten Gastrodon. Ferrothorn also performs well this role, and makes up for not being able to counter Breloom with being able to set up entry hazards. Heatran can take on most special attackers that can break through Gastrodon, while Gastrodon can switch in Water- and Ground-types such as Keldeo and Hippowdon. Talonflame appreciates Gastrodon's ability to switch in Electric- and Water-types, most notably Rotom-W, while Talonflame breaks past answers to Gastrodon such as Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Serperior. Chansey and Clefable work well with Gastrodon, as both take on special attackers such as Latios and Mega Diancie with ease and can absorb status effects thanks to Natural Cure and Magic Guard, respectively. Skarmory has good defensive synergy with Gastrodon, as Gastrodon takes both Electric- and Fire-type attacks for Skarmory, while Skarmory takes Grass-type attacks directed at Gastrodon, as well as being able to set up hazards.</p>"

  "Lopunny": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Lopunny has quickly cemented itself as one of the best new Mega Evolutions in OU. Its excellent Speed tier enables it to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame, and it has access to two powerful STAB moves backed up by a very respectable base 136 Attack. Furthermore, Scrappy gives it perfect coverage with its STAB types alone (bar against Shedinja, which is extremely uncommon in OU), giving it two completely free slots where it can fit the likes of Fake Out, Power-Up Punch, Substitute, Ice Punch, and Encore. Its combination of Speed and power makes it an excellent tool to use against offensive teams, and its access to Power-Up Punch and Encore make it of use against more defensive teams too, and an immunity to Ghost and a resistance to Dark give it opportunities to switch into the likes of Gengar and Bisharp. However, Mega Lopunny struggles to break past many physically defensive Pokemon due to its lack of raw power and the large number of Pokemon that resist Fighting, which are often found on these types of teams. It is also rather frail, holding little defensive prowess due to its lack of bulk and resistances, and is easily worn down by residual damage from sources such as entry hazards and High Jump Kick recoil.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lopunny's wide movepool and free moveslots give it a plethora of viable moves to run. Substitute + Power-Up Punch and Heal Bell + Power-Up Punch both enable Lopunny to effortlessly set up on status users. Substitute is more useful against offensive teams due to its ability to scout for switches, while Heal Bell enables Lopunny to actually switch into status users and support its teammates. Encore + Power-Up Punch is also a good combination, enabling Lopunny to set up on Pokemon that are locked into their recovery move. Quick Attack can be a decent option to chip away at faster attackers and Choice Scarf users. Drain Punch can be used instead of High Jump Kick, and it can serve as an accurate Fighting-type STAB move that Lopunny can use without fear against Protect users; it also gives Lopunny more longevity. However, the power of High Jump Kick is sorely missed and forgoing it prevents Lopunny from breaking through a large number of Pokemon. Facade enables Lopunny to take advantage of status; however, it should not be used over Return because a powerful Normal-type STAB move is important to have. Low Kick can be used over High Jump Kick as an accurate STAB move that reliably hits Heatran and Ferrothorn and doesn't fear Protect. However, it is noticeably weaker than High Jump Kick against the likes of Jirachi and Rotom. Endure can bring Lopunny down to 1 HP and Flail gives Lopunny a lot of firepower at that point, but this combination is very unreliable and Lopunny will be KOed by any residual damage afterwards. A moveset consisting of Fake Out, High Jump Kick, and Last Resort can be used, but it loses out on a lot of potential utility, prevents Lopunny from using a Normal-type STAB move other than Fake Out before its other two moves have been used, and forces it to use Fake Out as soon as it is sent out, which makes it very exploitable. Thunder Wave is somewhat usable, but most of Lopunny's checks are bulky Ground-types, so this is generally a poor option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Hippowdon, Skarmory, Chesnaught, Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and other physically bulky Pokemon have little trouble taking Lopunny out in most cases. However, they can struggle against sets that carry Encore and can be overwhelmed by Power-Up Punch. Physically defensive Gliscor and Landorus-T can also deal with it, but both fear Ice Punch. Notably, Cofagrigus can easily take an initial hit, remove Lopunny's ability thanks to Mummy, and completely wall it thereafter.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Physically defensive Fairy-types, such as Clefable and Mega Altaria, have little to no trouble handling Lopunny, as they resist High Jump Kick and can take a Return quite well. Clefable in particular can run Unaware to ignore Power-Up Punch's Attack boosts or Magic Guard to ignore damage from entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Physically defensive Psychic-types can take any of Lopunny's STAB moves as long as they have a decent amount of Defense investment. Celebi is a very good answer to Lopunny, though it can be taken advantage of thanks to the combination of Encore and Pursuit Bisharp. Slowbro and Mega Slowbro take hits from Lopunny very easily and deal a lot of damage to it with Psyshock, and the former doesn't even fear Encore sets much because of Regenerator. Physically defensive Cresselia completely walls Lopunny and can hit back quite hard with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarfers and Faster Attackers</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, Keldeo, Latios, and Garchomp as well as faster Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Sceptile can outspeed Lopunny and take it out without too much difficulty. However, all of these get worn down by Fake Out and cannot always reliably switch in.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Breloom, and other priority users can KO Lopunny before it gets to attack; however, much like faster Pokemon, they can't always switch in very well.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Lopunny can quite easily be forced to take residual damage to the point where it is taken out. Iron Barbs, Rough Skin, and Rocky Helmet users such as Ferrothorn and Garchomp can take advantage of Fake Out abuse, though the former must switch out immediately afterwards for fear of High Jump Kick. Pokemon that carry Protect can use it to force Lopunny to take recoil damage if it uses High Jump Kick, but this can backfire if Lopunny runs Substitute, so it should only be used as a last-ditch effort. Sandstorm damage and Spikes can also chip away at Lopunny's health to some extent.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>High Jump Kick is Lopunny's most powerful STAB move and Return is its most reliable STAB move; the two combined have perfect coverage together thanks to Scrappy. Fake Out is a great move on Lopunny, getting chip damage on faster attackers that can threaten Lopunny out as well as slower ones that are able to survive one hit from it otherwise. It also enables Lopunny to Mega Evolve against faster Pokemon such as Latios and Keldeo. Finally, it enables Lopunny to emergency check sweepers such as Rock Polish Mega Metagross and Mega Gyarados if the team has no other option for stopping them from sweeping than to continuously rack up Fake Out damage. Ice Punch OHKOes Choice Scarf Landorus-T and offensive Garchomp and 2HKOes the defensive variants of these Pokemon. Power-Up Punch is Lopunny's best Attack-boosting move. It enables Lopunny to break past physical walls that are too passive to stop it from setting up and puts a lot of pressure on defensive teams in general. Substitute can be used over Fake Out, as it enables Lopunny to take advantage of the switches it causes and makes it more useful against bulkier teams, specifically helping against Protect users such as Ferrothorn and Heatran. Substitute also pairs up very well with Power-Up Punch, giving Lopunny protection against status and the ability to scout for switches, and enables Lopunny to take advantage of Mandibuzz and Alomomola, which cannot break its Substitute in one move. Toxic is an alternative to Power-Up Punch that enables Lopunny to cripple physical walls such as Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Alomomola. Finally, Healing Wish can be used over Power-Up Punch because it provides fantastic utility by letting Lopunny heal a teammate for free. Encore allows Lopunny to switch in on Pokémon like Clefable and Mew when they're healing, letting it effectively shut them down and regain momentum.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Limber enables Lopunny to switch into Thunder Wave users such as Chansey and Ferrothorn. A Jolly nature is vital when using Lopunny; although Adamant provides a noticable buff in Attack, it will then get outsped by some very prominent Pokemon, specifically Alakazam, Tornadus-T, and Weavile.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Fake Out should be used very regularly against offensive teams to get as much chip damage as possible so that Lopunny is not immediately forced out by faster foes. However, you should be more conservative with Fake Out against bulkier teams because you might waste turns and let Lopunny take unnecessary damage from Iron Barbs, Rough Skin, and Rocky Helmet. Power-Up Punch is a very good move to use if Lopunny can sweep the rest of your opponent's team at +1. However, do not use it against foes that are able to deal a lot of damage to Lopunny, unless they are weakened to the point where Power-Up Punch can still take them out. Power-Up Punch can also be used if you need to weaken an opposing physical wall so that another Pokemon can sweep more easily, but doing so often comes at the cost of losing Lopunny. Against offensive teams, it is generally better not to use Power-Up Punch; focus instead on dealing as much immediate damage as possible and causing chip damage with Fake Out. Try to pivot into Lopunny if you can, as although its bulk isn't terrible, its lack of resistances severely limits the number of times it can switch in. Lopunny serves as a very good lead because Fake Out combined with its high Speed enables it to anti-lead Focus Sash leads. However, be wary of Breloom and Garchomp leads, as the former can deal massive damage to Lopunny with Mach Punch and the latter chips away at Lopunny's health with Rough Skin but cannot be KOed by the combination of Fake Out and High Jump Kick.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set functions well on both offensive and balanced teams as a tool to not only threaten offensive teams but also put pressure on bulkier teams. Lopunny needs to be paired with a Pokemon that can take on faster attackers and priority users (particularly Talonflame), such as Heatran. Lopunny appreciates support from a strong wallbreaker such as Manaphy or Gengar that can threaten defensive teams, which Lopunny struggles with, as well as wear down the likes of Gliscor and Ferrothorn. It also pairs up well with Pokemon that like certain physical walls weakened or can, conversely, weaken said physical walls for Lopunny, such as Azumarill, Excadrill, Tyranitar, Talonflame, and Diggersby. Physically defensive Garchomp is an excellent Lopunny partner, as it lures in bulky Water- and Ground-types and can surprise them with Toxic; it can also weaken Talonflame, Pinsir, and Azumarill via the combination of Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet. Lopunny enjoys Wish or Healing Wish support, as it can easily get worn down and be unable to break past bulkier teams. Jirachi in particular serves as a good Wish passer because it can counter Clefable and check Altaria. A teammate that can bait out and weaken physical walls, such as Talonflame, can pave the way for Lopunny to spam its powerful STAB moves. Support from a slow pivot is also very useful to have on a Lopunny team. Rotom-W is a particularly good partner because it checks Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Talonflame, both big threats to Lopunny. Lopunny also appreciates support from strong Pursuit trappers such as Bisharp and Weavile, as they can severely weaken bulky Psychic-types, which wall Lopunny. Stealth Rock and Spikes support from a teammate such as Landorus-T or Klefki enables Lopunny to weaken a lot of its checks, forcing them into a range where they are 2HKOed by Lopunny much more easily, and the support also wards off the likes of Talonflame and Pinsir.</p>"

  "Garchomp": {
    "overview": "<p>Garchomp is a dominant force in the OU metagame thanks to its many positive traits including high base Attack, good bulk, an excellent Ground / Dragon typing, a great movepool, and an awesome Speed tier. Said STAB combination and high Attack in particular grants it the ability to punch holes in several balanced teams. Access to Stealth Rock and Swords Dance also allows Garchomp to act as a great suicide lead for hyper offensive teams. Additionally, it is able to take on a more defensive role in which it sets up Stealth Rock and phazes with Dragon Tail. This is bolstered by its Rough Skin ability, which, when combined with a Rocky Helmet, punishes physical attackers for 30% of their HP every time they use a contact move. This is especially useful against VoltTurn teams because Garchomp's Rough Skin ability punishes physical attackers while its Ground typing blocks Volt Switch. Despite all of its positive traits, Garchomp does have some flaws. It has a crippling 4x weakness to Ice-type attacks, which are often seen on faster Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Raikou. Both of its STAB moves can be easily taken advantage of due to the prevalence of Pokemon that resist them, and Garchomp's best coverage move, Fire Blast, comes off its much weaker base 80 Special Attack. Finally, Garchomp has a Mega Evolution that boosts its offensive and defensive stats, turning it into a devastating wallbreaker. However, this comes at the cost of its Speed, leaving it outsped by even more offensive Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aqua Tail on the lead or Swords Dance set deals a good chunk of damage to Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Gliscor, all of which Garchomp lures in. Using Endure on the Tank Chomp set gives Garchomp an extra turn to rack up chip damage against physical attackers before it goes down. A Yache Berry allows Garchomp to survive a Hidden Power Ice from an Electric-type such as Raikou and promptly KO back with Earthquake. Similarly, a Roseli Berry gives Garchomp an extra turn against Fairy-types, which it can use to set up Stealth Rock or retaliate with a boosted Earthquake.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Hippowdon, Skarmory, physically defensive Mega Scizor, Slowbro, Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, physically defensive Clefable, Mega Slowbro, defensive Landorus-T, Quagsire, Mandibuzz, Zapdos, and Mega Venusaur all have the physical bulk to tank any of Garchomp's hits and either cripple it with status (such as a burn) or outright beat it. However, Swords Dance variants of Garchomp are capable of breaking through many of these Pokemon if they are able to acquire a boost before one of these Pokemon comes in. Additionally, Fire Blast is capable of beating Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor, as it 2HKOes all of them.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Azumarill, Clefable, Sylveon, Mega Altaria, and Mega Diancie are capable of checking or countering Garchomp. However, only Unaware Clefable is capable of beating Swords Dance variants. Togekiss deserves a special mention because it completely walls any variant of Garchomp that lacks a Rock-type move. Azumarill is a decent check, as it is capable of surviving an Earthquake and KOing back with Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that naturally outspeed Garchomp and can deal significant damage to it, such as Latios, Latias, Icy Wind Gengar, Ice Punch Mega Metagross, Keldeo, Mega Diancie, Thundurus, Raikou, Mega Manectric, and Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, make for good checks to Garchomp.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank Chomp": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock damages foes every time they switch in. Earthquake is Garchomp's main STAB move because it gets good neutral coverage and hits decently hard. Dragon Tail phazes foes and racks up entry hazard damage. Fire Blast roasts the Steel-types that take little from Earthquake, such as Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Toxic is an alternative, which cripples the common bulky Water-, Grass-, and Ground-types that like to switch into Garchomp. Rest is also an option to increase Garchomp's longevity and make more use of its ability to rack up chip damage with Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rocky Helmet in tandem with Rough Skin punishes physical attackers for 30% of their HP every time they use a contact move. The given EV spread increases Garchomp's physical bulk and gives it enough Speed to outspeed Jolly Bisharp, which is critical against Swords Dance variants, as a +2 Sucker Punch will never OHKO Garchomp, which KOes it back with Earthquake. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 164 Def / 76 SpD / 16 Spe gives Garchomp the Special Defense needed to survive powerful hits from Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Gengar, Keldeo, and Mega Diancie, while still retaining the optimum amount of physical bulk. The Speed EVs enable Garchomp to outspeed neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Bisharp and Breloom, as well as Jolly Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Garchomp is an excellent Stealth Rock setter for bulky offensive teams because it has a great matchup against most leads. It also deters most Rapid Spinners and Defoggers from switching in by nature of its typing. Furthermore, Garchomp is a great check to threatening physical attackers such as Talonflame and Bisharp because it has the bulk to tank their hits while simultaneously racking up significant chip damage with the combination of Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin. Garchomp is also a good early-game phazer after it sets up Stealth Rock, so spamming Dragon Tail to rack up entry hazard damage is a good way to wear down the opponent's team, especially when the opponent lacks a Fairy-type. Finally, Garchomp is a great Pokemon to sacrifice late-game. Should it be weakened to the point where it can't do much, sacrificing it to a physical attacker is a great way to get crucial damage off, especially in the case of a Landorus-T using U-turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can take advantage of Garchomp setting up Stealth Rock, such as Swords Dance Talonflame, Mega Gallade, and Bisharp, make for great teammates. Garchomp is great at wearing down Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Mega Metagross, so teammates that can take advantage of this, such as Bisharp, Talonflame, Mega Lopunny, and Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X, pair well with it. Furthermore, Pokemon that appreciate Garchomp's ability to lure in bulky Water-, Grass-, and Ground-types and cripple them with Toxic, such as Mega Gallade, Bisharp, Talonflame, and Mega Lopunny, make for good partners. Fairy-types give Garchomp issues, so Pokemon such as Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, Mega Venusaur, and Bisharp make for good teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is great for wearing down opposing teams by damaging foes every time they switch in. Earthquake is Garchomp's main STAB move that deals good damage to most targets, while Dragon Claw hits everything that resists Earthquake bar Skarmory and Togekiss for neutral damage. Outrage is a viable alternative because it has a significantly higher damage output. However, it has the drawback of locking Garchomp in, which can be easily taken advantage of by a smart opponent. Swords Dance turns Garchomp into a powerful early-game wallbreaker that can immediately pressure the opponent and weaken the opposing team, opening up holes for a teammate to sweep. However, Fire Blast is a viable alternative to roast the Steel-types that take little from Garchomp's Earthquake, such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Garchomp's Attack and Speed. A Jolly nature should be used in tandem with Swords Dance, while a Naive nature works best with Fire Blast. A Lum Berry enables Garchomp to set up on bulky Water-types without fearing a Scald burn. However, a Focus Sash can be used instead to guarantee that Stealth Rock is set up, and it is also the better option when using Fire Blast. Rough Skin is the ability of choice to punish physical attackers when they use a contact move. A Rocky Helmet can be used to further improve Garchomp's ability to rack up chip damage, but this is best left to the defensive set.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using Stealth Rock turn one of the match is the optimal move in most cases, but there are instances where using a different move is better. For example, using Swords Dance turn one against popular leads such as Mew and Rotom-W as they attempt to burn Garchomp with Will-O-Wisp is a great way to severely damage them with a +2 STAB Earthquake or Dragon Claw the next turn. Setting up Stealth Rock as they switch out is also a good move to make if the switch out is obvious. After setting up Stealth Rock, Garchomp should be used to break down walls such as Ferrothorn and Hippowdon so that a teammate can have an easier time sweeping later on in the match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Garchomp has great synergy with a multitude of offensive Pokemon. For example, Mega Gyarados, Talonflame, and Mega Gallade all appreciate Garchomp's ability to both set up Stealth Rock and weaken key defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Slowbro, and Celebi. Because Garchomp supports its team by setting up Stealth Rock, it is imperative that it stays up during the match. Gengar and Bisharp make for great partners because they are capable of blocking Rapid Spin and punishing the use of Defog, respectively. Furthermore, both of these Pokemon bring other things to the table such as wallbreaking in Gengar's case and sweeping in Bisharp's.</p>"
      },
      "Mega Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Mega Garchomp to boost its already stellar Attack to astronomical levels, enabling it to tear apart many defensive teams. Earthquake is Mega Garchomp's main STAB attack, being strong and reliable as well as receiving a boost in power when sand is active thanks to Sand Force. Dragon Claw is a decently powerful secondary STAB move, providing excellent neutral coverage alongside Earthquake, most importantly hitting Levitate users and Flying-types, bar Togekiss and Skarmory, for good damage. While it might seem like a strange choice for a physical attacker, Fire Blast is the preferred option for the last slot to 2HKO Skarmory, which otherwise walls this set. Fire Blast also has the added perk of hitting Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn super effectively. Stone Edge can be used over Dragon Claw or Fire Blast, as it allows Mega Garchomp to hit Togekiss super effectively and is more powerful than Dragon Claw when sand is up. However, Garchomp sorely misses the reliability of Dragon Claw, so Stone Edge isn't worth it most of the time.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack EVs alongside a Jolly nature are used to let Mega Garchomp hit as hard and as fast as possible. Rough Skin is the preferred ability for Garchomp before Mega Evolving, as it can land chip damage on physical attackers such as Talonflame or Bisharp. After Mega Evolving, Sand Force lets Mega Garchomp take advantage of the prevalence of the sand setters, Tyranitar and Hippowdon. An Adamant nature could be used, allowing Mega Garchomp to perform even better against defensive teams; however, this leaves Mega Garchomp outpaced by many common threats, most notably Jolly Excadrill and Mega Altaria.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is ideally used as a mid- or late- game cleaner against slower, more defensively inclined teams, often being able to plow through those teams once boosted. Keep in mind that Mega Garchomp can easily set up on a good portion of Pokemon on the defensive teams it already threatens such as Gliscor and Heatran. However, Mega Garchomp can also be used as an early-game wallbreaker, delivering powerful hits so that it or a teammate can take advantage of these walls being weakened later in the game. Sometimes, delaying Mega Evolution can be beneficial for Garchomp, as its base forme's higher Speed lets it exert more pressure against more offensive teams, outspeeding threats such as Mega Gardevoir, both Charizard formes, and Hydreigon. While Mega Garchomp boasts impressive physical bulk, letting it check attackers such as Bisharp and Talonflame, it should not be the team's primary check to these Pokemon, as it tends to be susceptible to passive damage from the likes of Spikes, burn, and poison. Be wary of lure moves from Pokemon that Mega Garchomp can typically handle such as Icy Wind from Gengar and Ice Beam from Tyranitar, as it has an easily exploitable weakness to Ice-type attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hippowdon and Tyranitar typically make for the best partners for this set, providing sand support to boost the power of Mega Garchomp's Earthquake and setting Stealth Rock to whittle down the foe upon switching and make it easier for Garchomp to wallbreak. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Tyranitar makes for a noteworthy partner, checking Latias, Latios, and both Mega Charizard formes, which can revenge kill Mega Garchomp, while excelling against the offensive teams Mega Garchomp tends to struggle with and appreciating Garchomp's ability to break walls. Pokemon that can set up entry hazards, such as Ferrothorn and Klefki punish foes that switch in, making it easier for Mega Garchomp to break defensive teams. Klefki makes for a notably exceptional partner, as it can lay Spikes, check the Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-types that trouble Mega Garchomp, and paralyze foes to somewhat alleviate the issue of Mega Garchomp's lackluster Speed. In general, Steel-types make for great partners, checking the Ice- and Fairy-types that scare Mega Garchomp. Due to its susceptibility to status ailments, particularly burns, status absorbers such as Clefable and Conkeldurr make for excellent partners. Clefable in particular can paralyze foes, set Stealth Rock, and check the Dragon- and Ice-types such as Latios and Kyurem-B that trouble Mega Garchomp. In return, Mega Garchomp uses the Steel-types that check Clefable, such as Jirachi, Heatran, and Scizor, as setup fodder. Fast Pokemon that can break offensive teams such as Talonflame and Tornadus-T make for excellent partners, as they take on the playstyle Mega Garchomp struggles most against. Excadrill can be used alongside Mega Garchomp, acting as a cleaner once Mega Garchomp has sufficiently broken down the opponent's team, as well as checking Fairy-types such as Togekiss and Mega Diancie that plague Mega Garchomp. However, using both Excadrill and Mega Garchomp means that the team will be incredibly reliant on sand being active, so the team should be built accordingly.</p>"

      "Substitute + Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance doubles Garchomp's Attack, significantly boosting its damage output. Earthquake is Garchomp's main STAB move that deals good damage to most targets, while Dragon Claw hits everything that resists it bar Skarmory and Togekiss for neutral damage. Substitute blocks attempts at inflicting Garchomp with a status move while also buffering against weaker attacks. It is also incredibly useful for blocking Intimidate, especially against Landorus-T, which is a main switch-in to Garchomp. Fire Blast or Fire Fang can be used in place of Substitute to score perfect neutral coverage, but the utility of having a Substitute is often superior to hitting Skarmory super effectively. Stone Edge is also a viable alternative to hit Mandibuzz and Zapdos, but it should only be used if these Pokemon prove to be problematic for your team. If Substitute isn't used, Outrage is a viable alternative over Dragon Claw for a significant increase in power.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment in tandem with a Jolly nature enables Garchomp to outpace the overcrowded base 100 Speed tier, while simultaneously maximizing its damage output. The best item for this set is a Salac Berry, which activates and raises Garchomp's Speed by one stage after three uses of Substitute. This enables Garchomp to perform admirably against offensive teams because normal revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, and Latios are now outsped and KOed by a +2 attack. 12 HP EVs are needed to ensure that the Salac Berry activates after the third Substitute. Alternatively, investing EVs into HP and holding Leftovers give Garchomp more staying power and is more beneficial against bulkier teams because they often lack ways of reliably breaking Garchomp's Substitute. Using Garchompite with Fire Blast over Substitute makes Garchomp a much better wallbreaker at the cost of losing effectiveness against offensive teams due to the Speed drop.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used mid- or late-game when Garchomp's checks and counters have been sufficiently weakened to maximize the potential for a sweep. Bring Garchomp in through aggressive double switches or against passive defensive Pokemon that cannot touch it, such as Heatran and Mew, and set up a Substitute as they switch out or attempt to burn it with a Will-O-Wisp. Slow users of Volt Switch and U-turn, such as Rotom-W, Scizor, and Celebi, are great teammates for Garchomp, as they allow it a safe switch in, especially against offensive Pokemon that Garchomp naturally beats such as Heatran, Excadrill outside of sand, Magnezone, and unboosted Mega Charizard X.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone is a great partner for Garchomp because it is able to trap and KO Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory, Pokemon that would otherwise give Garchomp trouble. Powerful wallbreakers, such as Swords Dance Talonflame, Mega Metagross, and Swords Dance Bisharp, also make for great teammates because they are able to defeat the defensive Fairy-types that Garchomp struggles against. Garchomp appreciates entry hazard support to ensure certain KOs, so users such as Ferrothorn, Klefki, Heatran, and Clefable are excellent partners. Finally, Garchomp appreciates the utility of slow users of Volt Switch and U-turn to get in safely, so Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Scizor, and Celebi make for great teammates.</p>"

      "Swords Dance + Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Garchomp's Attack greatly, which allows it to muscle through nearly every would-be defensive check barring a few Pokemon with the Unaware ability. Dragon Claw is Garchomp's go-to STAB move that hits everything for neutral damage save for Fairies and Steel-types. At the cost of locking Garchomp in for two to three turns, Outrage can be used over Dragon Claw for its significant extra power; for example, it typically 2HKOes defensive Unaware Quagsire—something Garchomp will otherwise struggle to break from full HP. Earthquake targets most grounded Pokemon, particularly Steel-types and Fairies, as well as anything hit for super effective damage. Fire Fang lets Garchomp easily break through Skarmory after a boost or two (depending on the Skarmory variant), as well as more efficiently deal with Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Should one want to opt for a means of targeting bulky Ground-types (defensive Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Gliscor, in this instance) over Fire Fang, Aqua Tail can be run in its place. It is worth noting that the combination of Aqua Tail and Outrage is largely redundant, as Outrage with Swords Dance boosts will typically allow Garchomp to beat the aforementioned bulky Ground-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment bolsters Garchomp's wallbreaking potential, meaning it can make more effective use of Swords Dance boosts. The remaining EVs are allocated in Speed, which enables it to outpace base 100 Speed Pokemon and tie with opposing fully invested Garchomp when using a Jolly nature. An Adamant nature is worth considering to further boost its power, but the luxury of outspeeding the aforementioned Pokemon is often too good to pass up. Since this Garchomp variant cannot afford the cost of move-locking due to a Choice item, Life Orb is used to further increase its breaking capabilities while still being able to set up using Swords Dance. While often inconsequential, running Rough Skin as Garchomp's ability means that any contact move used on it will be met with slight recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This particular offensive Garchomp set is best used in certain fashions on a case-by-case basis; when Garchomp clearly faces too many offensive countermeasures, it is best used as an early- to mid-game wallbreaker, but it can also serve as a crucial wincon versus more defensive teams that lack clear-cut stops to +2 boosted attacks. Ideally, Garchomp should be supported by some sort of slow U-turn or Volt Switch pivot backbone that allows it to be brought in with minimal wear. This is especially significant given that Garchomp is susceptible to all forms of entry hazards and is constantly being worn down by Life Orb recoil. One should avoid switching Garchomp into moves such as Heatran's Lava Plume, as while probability gives it a seventy-percent chance to avoid the burn, burns mitigate its wallbreaking potential drastically. Finally, aim to use Swords Dance when Garchomp clearly threatens the foe in front of it—most often by potentially OHKOing it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>When teambuilding, one should prioritize pairing this Garchomp with Pokemon that appreciate certain key defensive threats being weakened for their sweeps; Talonflame, Mega Lopunny, Mega Scizor, offensive Landorus-T, and Mega Metagross greatly enjoy the dents this variant of Garchomp leaves in their defensive roadblocks. Key defensive answers that Garchomp attracts are Clefable, bulky Ground-types, and bulky Water-types, so virtually anything that dislikes the presence of those Pokemon will make for optimal partners. Entry hazard support is greatly preferred, as hazards provide a means of further weakening Garchomp's defensive checks. Stealth Rock Jirachi, Stealth Rock or Spikes Ferrothorn, and Stealth Rock Heatran all make for notable partners due to their ability to handle certain Fairies that pose a threat. Slow U-turn and Volt Switch support complements this set nicely; Rotom-W, specially defensive pivot Jirachi, and Landorus-T can all provide said support well. Due to the fact that this set has few commonly found defensive counters, it will commonly be dealt with offensively via revenge killing, so defensive coverage versus notable Garchomp revenge killers such as Weavile, Latios, Choice Specs Keldeo, Ice Punch Mega Lopunny, and Mega Diancie is ideal. Clefable is capable of handling Weavile (typically), Latios, and Mega Lopunny, while Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Assault Vest Tangrowth can switch in on Choice Specs Keldeo and Mega Diancie. Since this variant of Garchomp is primarily a balance breaker of sorts, it lacks the tools to adequately deal with more offensive teams due to its relatively mediocre speed. An offense breaker or revenge killer that synergizes well with Garchomp makes for a solid teammate. Some examples are Mega Lopunny, Weavile, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Garchomp's most powerful STAB move and hits its usual switch-ins on their much weaker Special Defense. Earthquake is useful for hitting Steel-, Rock-, and Fire-types super effectively. Fire Blast roasts Steel-types that take little from Garchomp's Earthquake, which includes Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Stealth Rock is a good move for any team because the chip damage it provides enables Garchomp's teammates to break through certain foes much easier. If another Pokemon on the team is running Stealth Rock, Stone Edge is a viable alternative to hit Pokemon such as Togekiss, Mandibuzz, and Zapdos for super effective damage. If using Garchompite, Substitute in the last slot gives Garchomp breathing room against offense while also protecting it from weaker attacks from Pokemon found on bulkier teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Naive nature in tandem with maximum Special Attack and Speed investment gives Garchomp the power it needs to take advantage of Draco Meteor. This power is further enhanced when Garchomp is equipped with a Life Orb. However, should your Mega slot be open, you can run Garchompite to give Garchomp similar power to what a Life Orb would give it, with the added benefit of much higher bulk and no recoil damage; the only drawback is a drop in Speed. When using Garchompite, an EV spread of 16 Atk / 240 SpA / 252 Spe with a Naughty nature is recommended.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use this set to lure in and significantly damage Garchomp's normal checks and counters. For example, defensive Landorus-T, a usually safe switch-in to Garchomp, is easily 2HKOed by Draco Meteor, and Choice Scarf variants are simply destroyed. Other defensive answers such as Ferrothorn, defensive Mega Scizor, Skarmory, Slowbro, and Mandibuzz are either significantly damaged or outright beaten by the mixed set.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Mega Metagross, Mega Gallade, Swords Dance Talonflame, Bisharp, and Mega Lopunny appreciate Garchomp's ability to lure in and cripple defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Ferrothorn. Additionally, Stealth Rock guarantees certain KOs, so Pokemon such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, and Terrakion pair well with Garchomp.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Garchomp's main STAB move that deals good damage to most targets. Outrage hits everything that resists Earthquake bar Skarmory for neutral damage. However, it has the drawback of locking Garchomp in, so it should not be spammed recklessly. Stone Edge is Garchomp's best coverage move because it forms the EdgeQuake combo with Earthquake, and it hits Flying-types such as Thundurus, Talonflame, and Mandibuzz for super effective damage. Dragon Claw is Garchomp's secondary Dragon-type STAB move for dealing decent damage against most targets without locking Garchomp in like Outrage does. Fire Blast is a viable alternative to roast Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Scizor on the switch, but it is very weak outside of this and easily taken advantage of.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature in tandem with maximum Attack and Speed investment enables Garchomp to hit 333 Speed, which, when equipped with a Choice Scarf, is enough to outspeed certain Pokemon such as +1 Volcarona, Dragonite, Mega Charizard X, Mega Tyranitar, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. If you opt for Fire Blast, a Naive nature is recommended to maximize its damage output. An Adamant nature is a viable alternative over Jolly for more power, but Garchomp then risks being outsped by +1 base 90 Speed Pokemon with a speed-boosting nature.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Garchomp is often unexpected, so it is able to score surprise KOs against normally faster threats such as Thundurus, Raikou, Mega Metagross, and Latios. Furthermore, this set is great at revenge killing Dragon Dance sweepers that have gotten a boost. This set also acts as a good check to Flying-types when running Stone Edge, as Garchomp is able to outspeed and KO them with a super effective hit. Late-game, Garchomp is an excellent cleaner with Outrage due to the move's exceptional damage output.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Garchomp struggles against bulkier teams, so it is imperative to pair it up with Pokemon that excel against them. Pokemon such as Life Orb Kyurem-B, Mega Gardevoir, stallbreaker Mew, Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo, and Magma Storm Heatran take on balanced teams well and therefore are great partners for Garchomp. Garchomp also fits well on teams that require an emergency stop to Dragon Dance users.</p>"

  "Hippowdon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hippowdon is one of the best mixed walls in the game, checking some of the metagame's most prominent threats, such as Terrakion, Talonflame, and Garchomp. It has everything a wall could want: a good typing, great bulk, and reliable recovery. It also has good support options in Stealth Rock and Whirlwind, and is useful on sand teams due to its ability, Sand Stream. Its attacks also pack quite a punch for a defensive Pokemon. However, Hippowdon is painfully slow and has weaknesses to common attacking types, such as Water and Ice. Hippowdon also has to rely on Whirlwind to stop setup sweepers, making it somewhat easy to wear down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A spread with full investment in HP and Special Defense with a Careful nature can be used to handle threats such as Life Orb Gengar, Magnezone, and Mega Charizard Y more effectively, as this spread allows Hippowdon to take two Fire Blasts from full health in sand, or disrupt a predicted Solar Beam with Sand Stream, which is the only ability that should be used with this spread. It can also handle Latios, Latias, and Thundurus. Ice Fang can be used on either set to hit Garchomp and other Pokemon weak to Ice for heavy damage, but it is very weak otherwise, and it is generally better to use Toxic or Whirlwind. An offensive set can be used due to Hippowdon's good offensive movepool but compromising its bulk is not optimal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Almost all common Water-types, such as Azumarill, Gyarados, Mega Gyarados, Keldeo, and Rotom-W, force Hippowdon out with their respective STAB moves, and Hippowdon can't do much to them in return. However, all of these must be wary of Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Breloom, Mega Venusaur, and Ferrothorn can easily switch into Hippowdon and hit back hard with their respective STAB moves. Breloom can use Spore and proceed to set up with Swords Dance, Mega Venusaur can use Leech Seed or deal heavy damage with Giga Drain, and Ferrothorn can set up entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y can break through Hippowdon with strong special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Common Ice-types, such as Kyurem-B, can easily KO Hippowdon with their STAB moves, although most of them have to be wary of switching into Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Entry Hazard Setters</strong> Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Clefable can set up entry hazards, while Hippowdon can't do much to them in return besides phazing them out.</p> <p><strong>Status and Taunt</strong>: Toxic and Will-O-Wisp are very detrimental to Hippowdon, slowly wearing it down so that a strong attacker can overwhelm it. Because most Taunt users, such as Prankster Thundurus and Mandibuzz, are faster than Hippowdon, they can stop it from setting up Stealth Rock, healing, or spreading status.</p> <p><strong>Trick and Switcheroo</strong>: Trick and Switcheroo users can cripple Hippowdon for the rest of the match by giving it a Choice item as it can't wall opposing threats if it is locked into one move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is a strong STAB attack that deters frail sweepers from setting up on Hippowdon. Stealth Rock is a great support move, and Hippowdon is very good at setting it up due to its great bulk. Slack Off provides reliable recovery, making it more difficult to wear Hippowdon down. The last moveslot depends on what your team needs, as all of the options can benefit you depending on your build. Rock Slide is preferred in the last moveslot to heavily damage Thundurus, Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Mega Charizard Y, and other Flying-types. Toxic is a great move on Hippowdon that cripples opposing walls and Defog users that want to switch in, such as Mandibuzz, Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Latios, while also making it easier for teammates to sweep. Whirlwind is a phazing move, removing your opponent's stat boosts while racking up entry hazard damage, and it is Hippowdon's best chance against bulkier setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor. Stone Edge can be used to OHKO Mega Pinsir, though its worse accuracy and lower PP make it less consistent.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread avoids the 2HKO from Life Orb Thundurus's and Mega Manectric's Hidden Power Ice, as well as the OHKO from +2 Life Orb Terrakion's Close Combat. Leftovers is used to provide passive recovery that could mean the difference between getting OHKOed and getting 2HKOed. Sand Stream is the preferred ability as it lets Hippowdon replace opposing weather and double Excadrill's Speed, although Sand Force can be used if Sand Stream is detrimental to the rest of your team. Smooth Rock can be used to extend the duration of Sand Stream, which can provide a sweeping opportunity for Sand Rush Excadrill, which absolutely loves the sand Hippowdon provides, or to give a boost to Mega Garchomp's Earthquake and Stone Edge.</p> <p>A spread of 252 HP / 252 Def gives Hippowdon the bulk to take on Mega Pinsir and Mega Charizard X, while also walling physical attackers such as Garchomp, Excadrill, and Terrakion. Such a set is better suited for stall teams that already have a check or counter to Thundurus and other Electric-types, while being a better answer to physical attackers, such as Garchomp and Excadrill.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hippowdon can function as a catch-all check for both physical and special attackers, such as Talonflame, Garchomp, non-Choice Band Dragonite, Bisharp, and Gengar. Hippowdon can switch into Mega Charizard Y to disrupt Solar Beam, but does not avoid the 2HKO from Fire Blast in or out of sun. Try to keep Hippowdon as healthy as possible if there is a Pokemon on the opposing team that Hippowdon can check, as its low Speed often forces it to take two hits before it can fire off an attack. Hippowdon can set up Stealth Rock several times throughout the match, so you don't have to worry too much about Defog or Rapid Spin. Thanks to its naturally high Defense stat, it can take weaker physical attacks easily. If you see a Pokemon that is badly affected by sandstorm on the opposing team, such as Chansey or Mega Venusaur, always try to take advantage of it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hippowdon appreciates teammates that can take on special attackers easily, such as Chansey and Latias, as Hippowdon primarily checks physical attackers. The former can also rid Hippowdon of any status effect that it might have been inflicted with, while the latter can use Defog to support the team. A form of entry hazard removal, such as Defog and Rapid Spin, is appreciated, as Hippowdon can potentially be 2HKOed after taking entry hazard damage where it would otherwise be OHKOed. Latias and Starmie are good candidates, having solid synergy with Hippowdon. Hippowdon also appreciates teammates that can switch into Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks, such as Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur. In return, Hippowdon can check Talonflame and Mega Pinsir, which threaten Mega Venusaur. If you are using Mega Venusaur, be sure to use Sand Force as Hippowdon's ability because Sand Stream reduces Synthesis's recovery. Ferrothorn can also lay Spikes, which can quickly wear down the opponent in conjunction with Stealth Rock, sand, and Whirlwind. Rotom-W also makes for a great defensive teammate, as it can take Water- and Ice-type attacks for Hippowdon. Mega Aerodactyl is a good partner as sand bolsters its Special Defense, allowing it to either sweep more effectively or become bulky both physically and specially with its bulky build. Mega Garchomp also appreciates sand as its Earthquakes and Stone Edges become even stronger.</p>"

      "Special Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is important for threatening Heatran, Excadrill, Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, and Mega Metagross. Stealth Rock provides chip damage on the enemy team throughout the game to enable Hippowdon's teammates. Slack Off provides necessary sustainability for Hippowdon to consistantly check it's foes. Rock Slide or Toxic can be used in the last slot; Rock Slide is preferred, as the main objective of this set is to check Volcarona, Thundurus, and Mega Charizard Y, as well as OHKOing Talonflame. On the other hand, Toxic is a consistent way to chip down many of Hippowdon's switch-ins, like Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Serperior.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Special Defense enables Hippowdon to avoid being 2HKOed by powerful special attackers such as Mega Diancie, Thundurus, and Mega Charizard Y. It also lets Hippowdon survive any hit a boosted Volcarona might use and revenge kill it with Rock Slide. Sand Stream removes the sun set by Mega Charizard Y’s ability Drought, allowing Hippowdon to beat it. Despite Hippowdon's lack of investment in Defense, its base Defense is still high enough to not lose against common physical attackers such as Mega Metagross, Mega Lopunny, and non-Life Orb Bisharp.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As a special wall, Hippowdon can switch in against many special attackers, wall them, and set Stealth Rock. Thanks to Leftovers recovery in combination with Slack Off, Hippowdon can counter some strong physical attackers like Mega Lopunny. Against Mega Charizard Y, be sure to not switch Hippowdon in on the turn that Charizard Mega Evolves, as Drought will replace Sand Stream on that turn. However, after Mega Evolving, Mega Charizard Y is walled by Hippowdon thanks to Sand Stream eliminating the sun, weakening both Flamethrower and Solar Beam. To protect Hippowdon's longevity, avoiding status is important.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>To compensate for Hippowdon's Water- and Grass-type weaknesses, Grass-types like Serperior, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn fit well alongside it, and they can partially act as status absorbers. Pokemon that are immune to sand, such as Magic Guard Clefable, Overcoat Mandibuzz, and Steel-types like Skarmory, have great synergy with Hippowdon. Pokemon that have access to abilities like Sand Rush and Sand Force, such as Excadrill and Mega Garchomp, appreciate Hippowdon setting sand. Finally, Rock-type Pokemon, such as Mega Diancie and Terrakion, appreciate sand giving them a Special Defense boost and therefore more longevity throughout the match.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Weavile's excellent Dark / Ice typing, high Attack stat, and great Speed tier let it outspeed and threaten common threats in ORAS OU such as Tornadus-T, Gliscor, Serperior, and Garchomp. Additionally, Weavile's STAB moves are able to hit almost every Pokemon in the tier for neutral damage. This, coupled with two powerful moves in Knock Off and Icicle Crash and a high Attack stat, makes it quite difficult to switch into. Weavile is also the fastest Pokemon in the tier aside from Mega Lopunny, Mega Alakazam, Mega Manectric, and the odd maximum Speed invested Talonflame and is able to naturally outpace two of the tiers most common Choice Scarf users in Tyranitar and Magnezone. STAB Knock Off is capable of removing items such as Clefable's and Ferrothorn's Leftovers, helping its teammates break through bulky threats. Weavile is also adept at Pursuit trapping Pokemon such Latios, Tornadus-T, and Starmie. Weavile, however, possesses a very poor defensive typing that is weak to Stealth Rock, and it is incapable of switching into attacks because of its lackluster defenses; thus, it is susceptible to getting worn down throughout the match.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb gives Weavile the freedom to switch moves, but this results in it getting worn down more easily throughout the match and not maximizing its damage output. Low Kick is able to OHKO threats such as Tyranitar and Bisharp.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Scizor</strong>: Mega Scizor is able to switch into any of Weavile's moves comfortably and threaten it out with Bullet Punch or U-turn or use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Faster threats such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Alakazam are able to outspeed and OHKO Weavile. Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Latias can also threaten Weavile.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Priority moves such as Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, and Mega Medicham are all able to threaten Weavile. Mega Lopunny is also able to threaten Weavile with Fake Out + Quick Attack.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Being a grounded Ice-type, Weavile gets worn down easily by Stealth Rock and Spikes and is affected by Sticky Web, which prevents it from performing its role.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Mega Metagross and Mega Scizor are able to OHKO Weavile with their STAB moves.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Weavile's strongest and most useful STAB move, allowing it to remove items from Pokemon such as Leftovers from Rotom-W, Clefable, and Ferrothorn. Icicle Crash allows Weavile to threaten Pokemon such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T in addition to potentially flinching through threats such as physically defensive Clefable, which would normally stomach two hits upon switching in. Pursuit lets Weavile trap threats such as Latios, Latias, Gengar, and Starmie in addition to other various weakened Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Slowbro. Ice Shard is able to pick off threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and boosted threats such as Mega Pinsir and Mega Altaria.</p> <h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment alongside a Jolly nature and Choice Band allows Weavile to hit as hard and be as fast as possible, outspeeding Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Latios, and Starmie.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Weavile should be used early- to mid-game, utilizing Knock Off to get rid of opposing Pokemon's items such as Rotom-W's and Ferrothorn's Leftovers. Weavile should also only be brought in via pivoting or double switches and should not be brought in on any attacks, as it lacks reliable bulk to do so. Weavile should function as a revenge killer, as it is able to Pursuit trap Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Latias and threaten them with Knock Off. Avoid having Stealth Rock up on its side of the field, as this limits Weavile's capabilities. Weavile is also able to revenge kill setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Mega Pinsir and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria in addition to faster weakened foes such as Sand Rush Excadrill, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Lopunny.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates such as Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, and Serperior appreciate Weavile trapping and eliminating threats such as Latios, Latias, Starmie, and Tornadus-T. Entry hazard removal in Rapid Spin and Defog from Pokemon such as Excadrill, Starmie, Latios, and Latias allows Weavile to remain as healthy as possible throughout the match. In return, Starmie and Latias can switch into Keldeo, which otherwise threatens Weavile. Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Victini are able to threaten Mega Scizor, which counters Weavile. Clefable appreciates Weavile as a partner, as it is able to threaten Steel-types such as Excadrill and non-Bullet Punch Mega Metagross with Knock Off and potentially Pursuit trap them as well, and Clefable is able to switch into Fighting-types such as Mega Lopunny in return. Tornadus-T is a fine partner, as it is able to U-turn out on a predicted switch, allowing Weavile to get in safely, and counter Keldeo, which otherwise threatens Weavile.</p>"

  "Tangrowth": {
    "overview": "<p>Tangrowth proves to be a stellar, albeit uncommon, pivot in OU, thanks to an amazing ability in Regenerator that gives it passive recovery upon switching out, admirable mixed bulk when equipped with an Assault Vest, and solid resistances to common attacking types, most notably Water, Ground, and Grass, that let Tangrowth check many common threats, like Azumarill and Landorus-T. Tangrowth further separates itself from other defensive Grass-types, specifically Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur, thanks to its resistance to Ground, which makes it a far more effective check to common Ground-type attackers like Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Garchomp. Furthermore, Tangrowth makes up for its lack of offensive presence with its immense longevity and ability to whittle the foe down with moves such as Knock Off and Giga Drain, meaning that it will often outlast the foe if used effectively. However, Tangrowth is ultimately held back by its weakness to common attacking types such as Fire, Flying, and Ice, making it vulnerable to common attackers such as Talonflame, Tornadus-T, and Kyurem-B. Tangrowth also faces immense competition from its fellow bulky Grass-types, Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur, which boast useful resistances to Fighting and Fairy, alongside Spore and Thick Fat, respectively. On top of all this, Tangrowth is a relatively passive Pokemon, as its moves either have low Base Power, in the case of Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Fire, or come with unwanted side effects, in the case of Leaf Storm.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sludge Bomb is a viable alternative on the Assault Vest set, acting as Tangrowth's best way to hit Fairy- and Grass-types, most notably Clefable, Mega Altaria, and Serperior. Rock Slide can be used to hit Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Tornadus-T on the switch, but the moveslot can usually be put to better use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types, most notably Talonflame, Tornadus-T and Mega Pinsir, take little damage from Tangrowth's attacks, barring the uncommon Rock Slide, and can OHKO it with a powerful STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Due to Tangrowth's lackluster Special Defense and vulnerability to Fire-type attacks, Fire-types such as Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran make for fine answers to it. However, Heatran can be heavily damaged by Earthquake, while Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona must watch out for the uncommon Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types, particularly Mega Altaria and Clefable, act as prime answers to Tangrowth, taking little damage from its attacks and using it as setup fodder. They must, however, be wary of the uncommon Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn all wall Tangrowth and can use it as complete fodder to either set up a layer of Spikes or use Swords Dance in Mega Scizor's case, only fearing the rare Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types such as Mamoswine, Weavile, and Kyurem-B can pick off a weakened Tangrowth with a STAB-boosted Icicle Crash or Ice Beam.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sleep Powder puts opposing Pokemon to sleep and cripples potential switch-ins that don't care about Tangrowth's other attacks. Giga Drain is Tangrowth's main STAB move and helps it stay healthy. Knock Off weakens opposing Pokemon by removing their item, which is useful in hindering them from doing their jobs. Hidden Power Fire helps Tangrowth reliably beat Ferrothorn and check Mega Scizor, while Leech Seed can be used to annoy switch-ins and gradually recover more HP, which is especially helpful if you're running Rocky Helmet. Hidden Power Ice helps beat Garchomp and Landorus-T but is best used if your team is weak to Gliscor. Earthquake hits Heatran on the switch, whittles down Mega Metagross, and hits Excadrill harder than Giga Drain. Stun Spore can be used as a secondary status option to cripple Pokemon that think they are safe after Sleep Powder has been used. Toxic is also an option if your team is weak to Calm Mind Slowbro or Fire-types like Talonflame.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The HP EVs increase Tangrowth's overall bulk and maximize Regenerator recovery, while the Special Defense EVs allow Tangrowth to survive Life Orb Starmie's Ice Beam. The rest of the EVs are poured into Defense to maximize physical bulk so that Tangrowth can better check Excadrill, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gyarados, among other Pokemon. A Relaxed nature boosts Defense and allows Tangrowth to use both physical and special moves without either being weakened, and Tangrowth doesn't need its subpar Speed for much anyway. Rocky Helmet allows Tangrowth to wear down physical attackers it pivots into such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, and Excadrill. Leftovers is an alternative for additional passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Tangrowth into Pokemon like Excadrill, Mega Metagross, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gyarados, since it is a great check to them. Early-game, Knock Off is one of the better moves to use, as very few Pokemon appreciate switching into it. It is particularly helpful for wearing down Heatran and forcing Clefable to use Soft-Boiled more often. After items have been removed early-game with Knock Off, utilize Tangrowth as a pivot by switching into threats it walls and subsequently double out on a predicted switch to maximize the use of Regenerator and keep up momentum. Sleep Powder should be utilized to cripple threats that could potentially get out of hand and catch switch-ins like Talonflame and Tornadus-T off guard. Leech Seed should be used when you predict a switch to Pokemon like Heatran, which has no reliable recovery. It's also helpful for staying healthier against really strong attackers like Mega Metagross. Coverage moves should be used sparingly, since they are not particularly powerful. In a pinch, Tangrowth can be used to stomach almost any physical attack and retaliate with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore. As an example, Tangrowth can actually tank Jolly Mega Charizard X's Flare Blitz from full HP, although this is not generally advised.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Other pivots like Rotom-W, Slowbro, Slowking, and Tornadus-T work great with Tangrowth by covering each other's type weaknesses and providing momentum, as well as being difficult to wear down thanks to the latter three's access to Regenerator. Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Mega Diancie make for excellent partners, since they check Flying- and Fire-types for Tangrowth, which in turn checks Ground- and Water-types for them very well. Latios removes entry hazards, which inhibit Tangrowth's Regenerator recovery, and it checks Mega Charizard Y and Keldeo. Heatran checks Fire- and Flying-types while Tangrowth can check Ground- and Water-types. Tangrowth is a nice switch-in to physical priority users that might threaten Mega Alakazam, which handily defeats Mega Venusaur for Tangrowth. Mega Charizard X can check opposing Grass- and Steel-types for Tangrowth, as well as absorb Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W, while Tangrowth can switch into the majority of Mega Charizard X's checks.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm provides Tangrowth with a powerful STAB attack, hitting most foes that do not resist it for respectable amounts of damage; however, it comes at the cost of lowering Tangrowth's Special Attack upon use. If consistency is valued over power, Giga Drain can be used in its place, but Giga Drain cannot OHKO either Mega Gyarados or Manaphy after Stealth Rock damage, making Tangrowth a weaker check to them. Knock Off is used to take advantage of the fact that many of Tangrowth's checks, particularly Tornadus-T and Chansey, are reliant on their item to perform optimally, crippling them for the rest of the game. Earthquake is Tangrowth's best option to hit Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X and Heatran, as well as Electric-types such as Magnezone and Raikou. Hidden Power Ice is the preferred option for the last slot, as it allows Tangrowth to better check Landorus-T and Garchomp; however, Hidden Power Fire can be used in its place to hit Ferrothorn and Scizor, which otherwise wall Tangrowth entirely.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum EV investment in HP alongside 4 Defense EVs allows Tangrowth to always avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Keldeo's Secret Sword, while the remaining EVs are put into Special Defense to better take special attacks. Assault Vest is used to boost Tangrowth's meager Special Defense to solid levels, allowing it to take powerful special attacks, most notably Manaphy's Ice Beam after a Tail Glow boost and Latios's Draco Meteor, in a pinch. Regenerator restores Tangrowth's health as it switches out, furthering its abilities as a pivot.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be aware that while Tangrowth's bulk is impressive, it cannot repeatedly switch into many powerful attacks, such as Mega Gyarados's Crunch and Garchomp's Dragon Claw. When using Leaf Storm, you should keep the Special Attack drop in mind, as it makes Tangrowth complete fodder for setup sweepers such as Togekiss and Clefable. Knock Off should be used early-game to cripple foes by removing their items as soon as possible. If the need arises, Tangrowth can take powerful special attacks thanks to its invested Special Defense and the Assault Vest boost, such as Manaphy's Ice Beam after a Tail Glow and Latios's Draco Meteor; however, Tangrowth should not directly switch into them under normal circumstances. While it's not necessary, Tangrowth appreciates entry hazards removed from its side of the field, as they neuter the effectiveness of Regenerator.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tangrowth fits best on bulky offense or balance teams that appreciate both a bulky Grass-type and a check to Ground-types, a role that Tangrowth's main competitors, Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur, cannot fill. Heatran is amongst the best teammates to Tangrowth, as it handles the Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-type attacks that stop Tangrowth, while Tangrowth takes on Water- and Ground-types such as Manaphy and Landorus-T in return. Rock-types such as Mega Diancie and Tyranitar make for excellent partners, checking Fire- and Flying-types that Tangrowth struggles with while Tangrowth resists the Water-, Ground-, and Grass-type attacks that they're vulnerable to. Tangrowth appreciates Rapid Spin or Defog support from the likes of Starmie and Latios because entry hazards, particularly Spikes and Stealth Rock, can easily pressure and potentially overwhelm it. Water-types such as Slowbro and Azumarill complement Tangrowth well, checking the Fire- and Ice-types that burden it.</p>"

  "Togekiss": {
    "overview": "<p>Togekiss is a very well-rounded Fairy-type that possesses impressive bulk, solid typing, and a good offensive movepool. Thanks to its impressive bulk and typing, it can take on prominent threats in this metagame such as Mega Lopunny, Keldeo, Garchomp, and Mega Sableye, and with its offensive movepool, which includes Nasty Plot, and good power it can capitalize on its defensive capabilities quite effectively. Its Serene Grace Air Slash, which has a 60% chance to flinch the target, helps Togekiss easily wear down slower Pokemon and function as an effective stallbreaker. However, Togekiss also has several common weaknesses, including one to Stealth Rock, which limit its defensive capabilities—this is further compounded by its Speed, which leaves it outsped by several Pokemon in the tier such as Thundurus and Mega Metagross. Furthermore, Togekiss also has to rely on using weaker STAB moves compared to other Pokemon. It also faces competition from Pokemon such as Clefable and Mega Gardevoir as a Fairy-type.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wish can be used to allow Togekiss to pass HP to a teammate, but Togekiss's lower HP and Stealth Rock weakness make it hard to use such a move well. Stored Power can be used with significant amounts of boosts, but in general it isn't very useful. Togekiss also has access to Defog to remove entry hazards, but it is not a good user of the move, being outclassed by Skarmory and Latias at such a role. A defensive set with Thunder Wave and Air Slash is usable, but relies a lot on luck, and this kind of set is extremely passive. Togekiss can also run a Choice Scarf set, using Serene Grace Air Slash to serve as a revenge killer, but this set lacks good power. Togekiss has a variety of other options, but few are actually worth using, as Togekiss has several non-negotiable moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types pose a large threat to Togekiss, being able to take repeated Air Slashes and, in most cases, outspeed it due to their immunity to Thunder Wave. Examples include Thundurus, Raikou, and Mega Manectric, all of which can hit Togekiss very hard, and the latter two can also use Volt Switch to obtain momentum.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Weavile and Kyurem-B are all relevant Ice-types that can take on Togekiss with their Ice STAB moves, namely Icicle Crash and Ice Beam. However, all of these Pokemon must be wary of getting hit by a potential Aura Sphere.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock severely inhibits Togekiss's defensive capabilities, making it much easier to 2HKO and limiting its ability to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Poison- and Steel-types</strong>: Scizor in particular can revenge kill Togekiss with its STAB Bullet Punch. Life Orb Gengar can put a heavy dent in Togekiss with Sludge Bomb, and Mega Metagross can revenge kill Togekiss with Meteor Mash. Excadrill and Jirachi can also take on Togekiss with Iron Head, and the latter also takes little damage from Togekiss overall bar the odd Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Terrakion and Mega Diancie can easily revenge kill Togekiss with Stone Edge or Diamond Storm, respectively. Tyranitar can also take on most of Togekiss's moves due to its good special bulk, but it must be wary of Aura Sphere.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot allows Togekiss to greatly boost its offensive power to deadly levels, which is especially threatening with its bulk and typing. Air Slash is a reliable STAB move that possesses a high flinch chance and is relatively powerful after a boost. Heal Bell allows Togekiss to remove status from itself, which is helpful in handling defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro, and Chansey, as well as supporting its teammates. Thunder Wave is an option in the third slot to paralyze Pokemon such as Keldeo and Mega Lopunny, thereby allowing Togekiss to perform better against faster teams. This also works excellently in tandem with Serene Grace Air Slash. Fire Blast, meanwhile, hits incoming Mega Metagross and Jirachi hard, in addition to OHKOing Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Roost keeps Togekiss consistently healthy throughout the match. Alternatively, Aura Sphere allows Togekiss to revenge kill Bisharp and Tyranitar with relative ease and hit Heatran, all of which would try to switch into Togekiss. However, Togekiss is much better off paralyzing such Pokemon. Dazzling Gleam, on the other hand, is Togekiss's most powerful option against Rotom-W, but is relatively useless otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With 176 Speed EVs and a Timid Nature, Togekiss can outspeed and revenge kill Jolly Bisharp. 80 Defense EVs and Leftovers allow Togekiss to survive two Psyshocks from Latios as well as two Returns from Lopunny.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With this set, Togekiss should use its good bulk and typing to set up and sweep effectively with Serene Grace Air Slash against slower teams. Togekiss possesses middling Speed, so unless you are running Thunder Wave, it would be best not to pit Togekiss up too frequently against offensive teams, as it is rather easy to revenge kill. Do not attempt to sweep with Togekiss until its counters have been removed, as this is when Togekiss performs best.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Landorus-T is an excellent teammate, as it is able to revenge kill Raikou and Mega Manectric with ease. With Intimidate and U-turn, it can also get Togekiss in safely. Thunder Wave support from Thundurus or Klefki is also very useful to help patch up Togekiss's poor Speed tier and allow it to perform more effectively against offense. Entry hazard removal in the form of Defog or Rapid Spin is advised, as Togekiss's bulk and typing are undermined by a Stealth Rock weakness. Latias and Latios both do this quite well and are also take on Raikou, Mega Manectric, and Thundurus relatively well. Excadrill is also a decent teammate and can use Mold Breaker Earthquake to eliminate Rotom-W.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot is useful to allow Togekiss to capitalize on its defensive capabilities by quickly boosting its power. Air Slash is a reliable STAB move that hits decently hard after a boost, has good coverage, and has a high flinch chance. Heal Bell allows Togekiss to support its team by removing status from its teammates and itself, allowing Togekiss to perform better against defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro. Thunder Wave is an acceptable alternative over Heal Bell in this slot, however, allowing Togekiss to cripple faster Pokemon with paralysis. Roost serves as Togekiss's main form of recovery.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread invests into HP and Defense to maximize physical bulk, making the most use of Togekiss's typing and resistances to take on important threats in this metagame such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Mega Altaria. Serene Grace is the ideal ability so that Air Slash's flinch chance is increased, and Leftovers serves as passive recovery for Togekiss.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Togekiss set takes a defensive approach; it aims to be able to effectively check important threats in OU such as Breloom, Mega Lopunny, and Landorus-T while simultaneously having an offensive presence and performing well against defensive teams. However, this set's capabilities are hindered greatly by Togekiss's Stealth Rock weakness, so one must be sure to keep Stealth Rock off the field for Togekiss to perform at its best. With Nasty Plot and Heal Bell, Togekiss also functions as an excellent win condition for stall teams, being able to perform well defensively while setting up to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal support is heavily advised for Togekiss to function at its best. Latias and Latios can remove entry hazards for Togekiss while simultaneously checking Electric-types such as Thundurus. Starmie can also provide Rapid Spin support and take on Mega Metagross. Hippowdon can take on Electric-types and Tyranitar well and provide Stealth Rock support for Togekiss. Heatran is also a viable teammate, as it takes on most variants of Scizor effectively.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Gliscor is one of the best Pokemon to break bulkier team archetypes like stall and balance. Gliscor's ability Poison Heal allows it to be immune to status effects when poisoned while also providing it with passive recovery, which is useful alongside reliable recovery in Roost. Since Gliscor's low Attack makes it unable to threaten many Pokemon, it needs to run Swords Dance in order to break through bulkier threats. Gliscor acts as a solid switch-in to common foes like Excadrill, Assault Vest Tornadus-T, Heatran, Magnezone, and Clefable that lack Ice coverage. Gliscor does, however, struggle to deal with faster Pokemon that can threaten to KO it, which includes Keldeo, Mega Metagross, and Weavile.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt is a viable option to prevent setup, recovery, phazing moves like Whirlwind, and entry hazards from going up. This is extremely useful against bulkier foes like Chansey and Skarmory that rely on recovery to not faint. Knock Off is also worth mentioning, as it's able to remove your foe's items while also hitting Pokemon like Gengar and Skarmory for more damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types and Ice-type Moves</strong>: Strong Water-types like Crawdaunt, Keldeo, and Modest Mega Slowbro are able to OHKO or 2HKO Gliscor. Pokemon with Ice-type moves like Ice Punch Mega Metagross, Ice Beam Mega Latias and Life Orb Clefable, and Icicle Crash Weavile, and Hidden Power Ice Mega Alakazam can all OHKO Gliscor. Zapdos and Tornadus-T that carry Hidden Power Ice can threaten and beat Gliscor as well.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Defensive Tangrowth with Worry Seed, Leech Seed, and Hidden Power Ice can wall and beat Gliscor. Slowbro can take on anything Gliscor does while also threatening it back with Ice Beam or Scald. Rotom-W is immune to Earthquake and can force Gliscor to use Roost with Hydro Pump. Mega Scizor is able to survive two boosted Earthquakes or beat Gliscor in a Swords Dance battle if both don't have a boost yet. Skarmory is immune to Earthquake, can set Spikes while Gliscor is out, and can use either Counter or Whirlwind on it. Physically defensive Clefable can take any hit from Gliscor and threaten it back with Ice Beam. Gastrodon can use Clear Smog to remove any Swords Dance boosts from Gliscor while also threatening it with Counter. Quagsire is able to ignore Gliscor's Swords Dance thanks to Unaware and remove its Attack boosts with Haze.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Strong attackers like Mega Charizard Y, Ice Punch Mega Lopunny, Serperior, and Choice Specs Latios are able to outspeed and threaten to 2HKO or OHKO Gliscor. However, Gliscor is usually able to take at least one hit from these heavy hitters and attack back if necessary but struggles to beat them one-on-one if they are near or at full health.</p>",

      "Swords Dance Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Gliscor to easily break through defensive cores while also becoming an immediate threat. Roost gives Gliscor a reliable method of healing, making it extremely hard to wear down, especially when paired with Poison Heal. Earthquake is Gliscor's strongest STAB move, hitting Pokemon like Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor for neutral damage and Heatran, Excadrill, and Bisharp for super effective damage. Facade is extremely strong when Gliscor is poisoned and is used to hit Pokemon that Earthquake cannot, which includes Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Zapdos and Pokemon with Levitate like Rotom-W and Latios. Ice Fang should be used if you feel like your team is weak to opposing Gliscor. Ice Fang is also able to hit Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T and Dragon-types like Mega Altaria and Latios for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>56 Speed EVs allow Gliscor to outspeed Adamant Bisharp. This is important, as 248 HP EVs allow Gliscor to always avoid an OHKO from +2 Life Orb-boosted Sucker Punch from it. More Speed Investment could be run to outpace other Gliscor. The rest of the EVs are thrown into Special Defense to make Gliscor harder to revenge kill while also making moves like Scald from bulky Water-types and Draco Meteor from Latios do little damage. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 156 Atk / 48 SpD / 56 Spe with a Jolly nature allows Gliscor to outspeed Jolly Bisharp and Metagross before Mega Evolving. 156 Attack EVs ensure the 2HKO on physically defensive Clefable after a Swords Dance while also giving Gliscor a chance to OHKO Bisharp without a Swords Dance boost. 156 Attack EVs also give it an 87.5% chance to OHKO other Gliscor with Ice Fang. The rest of the EVs are thrown into Special Defense, which ensures that Gliscor is able to tank an Ice Beam from Leftovers Clefable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Without being poisoned, Gliscor will be unable to utilize Poison Heal and be susceptible to other status ailments, making activating Toxic Orb very important. This means you should avoid switching Gliscor in on Will-O-Wisp or Knock Off before its Toxic Orb is activated. Use Swords Dance on foes that pose no immediate threat to Gliscor, which includes Ferrothorn, Heatran, Assault Vest Tornadus-T, and Clefable lacking Ice Beam. Use Roost as a way to keep Gliscor healthy and out of range from the foe's attacks. Scout for Ice-type coverage moves like Hidden Power Ice from Tornadus-T, Ice Beam from Clefable, and Ice Fang from opposing Gliscor before sending in Gliscor to check them. Do factor in that Gliscor is able to take an Ice-type move from full if necessary.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gliscor can fit on any team archetype barring hyper offense. Gliscor is weak to Ice- and Water-types, so teammates such as Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Gastrodon pair well with it. Ferrothorn can also help Gliscor deal with Water- and Ice-types and provide Spikes, allowing Gliscor to take advantage of the switches it forces. Mega Latias is a great partner, as it's able to take on the likes of Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y, which both threaten Gliscor, while also appreciating Gliscor's ability to handle threats like Bisharp, Heatran, Clefable, and Mega Diancie and absorb status effects. Pokemon like Mega Metagross, Excadrill, Heatran, and Mega Scizor can help take on Ice Beam variants of Clefable and appreciate Gliscor's ability to take on non-Ice Beam variants of Clefable like Flamethrower sets.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake pressures all grounded foes and especially threatens Ground-weak Pokemon such as Excadrill, Heatran, and Tyranitar. Taunt allows Gliscor to prevent hazard removal from slower Defog users such as Zapdos or healing moves from bulky Pokemon such as Clefable. Knock Off removes items such as Leftovers or Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Clefable, cutting into their longevity, and also lets Gliscor hit Ground-immune Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Landorus-T. Roost provides Gliscor with longevity and the ability to pressure foes in combination with Taunt.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>112 Speed EVs allow Gliscor to out speed and more easily wall Timid Heatran with faster Roosts. It also makes Gliscor faster than setup sweepers like Dragonite, Adamant Gyarados, and Careful or Impish defensive Gliscor, preventing them from setting up with Taunt. Maximum HP investment allows Gliscor to be as bulky as possible, while the rest of the EVs are invested in Special Defense to improve the matchup against special attackers like Mega Alakazam and Mega Diancie. Toxic Orb and Poison Heal provide Gliscor with extra healing and prevent other status conditions from being inflicted.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bringing in Gliscor safely is important to activate the Toxic Orb. Once its ability is activated, Gliscor becomes a good target to take Knock Offs and status moves for the team. Using Knock Off early can be beneficial, since removing the foes' items can weaken their damage output or hinder their healing; by removing Leftovers from defensive Pokemon like Clefable, Alomomola, and Skarmory Gliscor can more easily pressure them with Taunt. Due to being a Flying-type and not being afraid of Toxic, Gliscor counters common physically defensive checks like Landorus-T and Garchomp well while also removing their Rocky Helmet or Leftovers with Knock Off and preventing Stealth Rock with Taunt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Gliscor set does well on slower paced teams that aim to chip down opposing teams gradually. Playstyles such as stall, hazard stack, and balance all suit Taunt Gliscor. A good teammate is Ferrothorn, since it can set up Spikes and switches well into Rotom-W. Another good option is Clefable, as it checks Weavile, Hidden Power Ice Zapdos, and Ice Punch Mega Lopunny. Pokemon that resist either Water- or Ice-type moves like Slowbro, Keldeo, and Amoonguss also pair up well with Gliscor by covering its weaknesses.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Mamoswine is a solid wallbreaker in OU thanks to its great Attack combined with an excellent offensive typing, that makes it difficult for many teams to switch into. Its typing coupled with decent overall bulk allows it to work as a great check to common Electric-types in the tier. A decent ability in Thick Fat also gives it valuable resistances to Ice- and Fire-type moves and grants it more opportunities to switch in. However, Mamoswine sits at a low Speed tier that, in tandem with relatively low bulk, leaves it a glass cannon that can't outpace premier OU threats. It also faces competition from Weavile, which boasts a better Speed tier as well as STAB Knock Off, though Mamoswine has a more useful Ice / Ground typing as well as more power and bulk. Mamoswine faces further competition from Kyurem-B, which has much more bulk and versatility in addition to much wider movepool and a solid niche as the only specially based Ice-type in OU. Lastly, Mamoswine struggles to break past certain Steel-types, such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Icicle Spear can be run to bypass Focus Sash and Substitute users as well as Multiscale Dragonite and Yache Berry users. Choice Scarf gives Mamoswine better revenge killing capabilities and a surprise factor at the expense of power and the ability to change its moves.

Mamoswine also takes a large chunk of damage from Bisharp's Sucker Punch and Talonflame's Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to its low Speed tier, Mamoswine is easily outsped Pokemon on more offensively oriented teams and fast, hard-hitting Pokemon that can tank an Ice Shard, such as Mega Lopunny, Starmie, Keldeo, and Mega Diancie.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Slowbro, Rotom-W, Manaphy, and Quagsire can easily tank either of Mamoswine's typical STAB attacks and wear it down with their own STAB attacks or status effects. However, they can be eliminated through the use of Freeze-Dry.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Scizor is particularly threatening, as bulky variants can use Mamoswine as setup bait and KO it with Bullet Punch. Skarmory and Ferrothorn are nuisances for Mamoswine. Skarmory is immune to Earthquake and can tank an Icicle Crash and retaliate with Iron Head or Counter, and while Ferrothorn is hit neutrally by Mamoswine's STAB attacks, it can wear it down with Leech Seed or KO it with Gyro Ball. Mega Metagross can outrun Mamoswine and KO it with Meteor Mash, and Klefki can use Magnet Rise to avoid Earthquake and chip away at Mamoswine. Excadrill and Jirachi can outspeed it and KO it with Iron Head, though both cannot switch in safely due to the threat of Earthquake.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Shard is mandatory, as it allows Mamoswine to revenge kill Flying-, Dragon-, and Grass-types such as Tornadus-T, Mega Altaria, and Serperior and pick off weakened threats. Earthquake is Mamoswine's most powerful STAB move and offers nice coverage in tandem with its Ice-type attacks. Icicle Crash is its preferred Ice-type option, coming with a decent flinch chance with imperfect accuracy. Superpower allows Mamoswine to eliminate more physically defensive Ferrothorn variants which otherwise wall Mamoswine. Freeze-Dry gives Mamoswine the ability to lure in and KO bulky Water-types that it otherwise struggles with. Knock Off is a decent option, as it allows Mamoswine to remove items from its few switch-ins to aid in wallbreaking and cripple said switch-ins for the rest of the match. Stealth Rock can be used for Mamoswine to act as an offensive entry hazard setter, due to its ability to threaten common setters such as Garchomp, Heatran, and Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Mamoswine to hit as hard and fast as possible. An Adamant nature gives Mamoswine a considerable increase in power, exemplified by a high chance to 2HKO specially defensive Skarmory with Icicle Crash, Mega Scizor with Earthquake, and OHKO Tornadus-T with Ice Shard after Stealth Rock. A Jolly nature can be used instead to allow Mamoswine to outspeed Bisharp, Breloom, and Timid Heatran. Thick Fat is the ability of choice, as it gives Mamoswine the ability to work as a check to certain Electric-types and switch into some Ice- and Fire-type moves. Life Orb bolsters Mamoswine's overall power. If running Freeze-Dry, a spread of 240 Atk / 16 SpA / 252 Spe along with a Naughty or Naive nature gives Mamoswine the ability to 2HKO Rotom-W and Slowbro after Stealth Rock, which it otherwise struggles with.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It's best to utilize Mamoswine as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker. Mamoswine can be used to pressure common entry hazard setters, such as Landorus-T and Heatran, as well as hazard removers, through its STAB combination and power. Bring Mamoswine in through use of Volt Switch and U-turn or double switching, as its bulk is decent at best. Good prediction is necessary to maximize Mamoswine's potential due to its below average Speed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mamoswine is often found on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to threaten bulky Ground- and Water-types and pressure Heatran. Magnezone can trap and eliminate Skarmory, Scizor, and Ferrothorn while also offering Volt Switch support. Flying-types such as Mega Pinsir and Talonflame appreciate Mamoswine's ability to lure in and KO Rotom-W and Quagsire and eliminate checks such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Heatran. Mega Charizard X appreciates Mamoswine's ability to pressure bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Landorus-T and its ability to eliminate Slowbro and Quagsire with Freeze-Dry. In return, Mega Charizard X can beat the Steel-types Mamoswine struggles with. Serperior benefits from Mamoswine's ability to threaten Tornadus-T, Mega Altaria, Heatran, and Amoonguss and can break down bulky Water-types in return. Heatran can pressure the Steel-types that wall Mamoswine while taking advantage of its ability to lure in and KO threats such as Rotom-W and Slowbro. Klefki provides Thunder Wave support to alleviate Mamoswine's Speed issues and forms an entry hazard-stacking core with it if you run Stealth Rock. Ferrothorn provides a switch-in for foes such as Mega Gyarados and Azumarill while providing Stealth Rock or Spikes support to aid Mamoswine in its wallbreaking.</p>"

  "Rotom-Heat": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-H is a decent pivot in OU, capable of checking many threats that Rotom-W cannot beat, such as Grass-, Steel-, and Electric-types; more specifically, Serperior, Breloom, Ferrothorn, Scizor, Mega Manectric, and Thundurus. It also checks Fire-types that commonly run Grass-type coverage such as Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona better than Rotom-W. Rotom-H also has access to STAB Overheat, which allows it to OHKO Bisharp and Breloom, two threats that Rotom-W is incapable of OHKOing. However, this means that Rotom-H is completely walled by specially defensive Talonflame, as it no longer has access to STAB Hydro Pump. Rotom-H's Fire typing means that it is also immune to burns, which can make it much harder to wear down in comparison to Rotom-W. However, Rotom-H can be worn down very quickly due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, which shaves off a quarter of its HP with each switch in. Additionally, it struggles to take on common Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Hippowdon, as they can bypass Levitate by hitting Rotom-H with a Rock-type coverage move. Other than facing competition from its other forme as a bulky pivot, Rotom-H must also contend with Heatran as a defensive Fire-type due to the latter's better typing, which grants it a neutrality to Stealth Rock as well as immunity to nearly all forms of passive damage. Additionally, Heatran is able to set up Stealth Rock itself to support its team. However, Rotom-H is able to separate itself from Heatran with Levitate, its access to a recovery move in Pain Split, an additional status option in Thunder Wave, and a momentum-gaining STAB move in Volt Switch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is another viable status move Rotom-H can run over Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp in order to cripple bulky Ground-types that can switch into it easily such as Garchomp and Hippowdon. Toxic also cripples other common switch-ins such as Latios, Mega Latias, and Gastrodon and also effectively shuts down the likes of Mega Charizard X and Y, Talonflame, Volcarona, and Mega Altaria. Rotom-H can utilize a Choice Scarf to act as a revenge killer and can cripple the likes of Chansey and Clefable with Trick. Snatch is an option that allows Rotom-H to stop the likes of Clefable and Mega Altaria, as it can steal their boosting and recovery moves and slowly chip away at them. Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit opposing Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, but it forces Rotom-H to drop a move, which it cannot really afford to do. Rotom-H can also run a specially defensive set in order to handle the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Serperior even better. ChestoResto can also be run for more reliable recovery and the ability to cure status, but this means Rotom-H loses out on passive recovery from Leftovers, and it can lose its one-time instant recovery from switching into an untimely Knock Off or Bug Bite.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: The likes of Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, and Terrakion can quickly shut down Rotom-H with their high-powered Rock-type STAB moves, while Rotom-H struggles to do anything back to them. Mega Diancie in particular has Magic Bounce, which completely stops Rotom-H from using status moves. Tyranitar and Terrakion must be wary of switching in due to the risk of taking a Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types are also annoying for Rotom-H, as they resist both of its STAB moves. The most Rotom-H can do to the likes of Latios and Latias is cripple them with Thunder Wave; meanwhile, Garchomp easily sets up on Rotom-H if it lacks Will-O-Wisp. Dragonite also sets up easily on Rotom-H because it commonly runs Lum Berry. Kyurem-B is also another pain because of Teravolt, which allows Earth Power to bypass Levitate, dealing 4x super effective damage.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T can take on Rotom-H fairly well, as it commonly runs Rock-type coverage that can pick off Rotom-H easily. Excadrill can bypass Levitate with Mold Breaker and easily OHKO Rotom-H with Earthquake, while Sand Rush variants can heavily dent Rotom-H with Rock Slide, although Rotom-H OHKOes them with Overheat. Gliscor is capable of setting up on Rotom-H, as it takes little damage from Overheat and is immune to Thunder Wave, Volt Switch, and Will-O-Wisp. Hippowdon, Quagsire, and Gastrodon can also switch in freely as long as Rotom-H lacks Will-O-Wisp, as they can shrug off Overheat easily.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Keldeo, Starmie, Manaphy, and Azumarill all deal heavy damage to Rotom-H. However, Rotom-H can effectively deter them from switching in with the threat of Volt Switch and Thunder Wave, limiting their sweeping potential. Gastrodon and Quagsire deserves mentions as they are immune to Electric-type moves and completely wall Rotom-H.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Mega Latias, and Clefable are completely capable of walling Rotom-H as it cannot do anything to any of them apart from stealing their support moves with Snatch. However, Chansey lacking Toxic cannot touch Rotom-H and Clefable cannot touch Rotom-H without Calm Mind or Toxic, making Unaware and Life Orb variants ineffective answers to it.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Overheat hits Steel- and Grass-types that Rotom-W cannot hit for super effective damage such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Serperior, and Breloom. Volt Switch allows Rotom-H to gain momentum off the likes of Heatran as well as pressure Water-types that attempt to switch in. It can also avoid Tyranitar when it switches in, avoiding being trapped by Pursuit. Pain Split is necessary for recovery and allows Rotom-H to stay healthy for long periods of time; it's also easy to take advantage of, since Rotom-H will lose HP quickly because of its Stealth Rock weakness. Thunder Wave can cripple the likes of Latios, Tyranitar, Water-types, Volcarona, Talonflame, and Mega Charizard X and Y. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple Ground-types, but Rotom-H doesn't need Will-O-Wisp because it doesn't need to cripple Steel-types when it can just OHKO them, unlike Rotom-W.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs reduce damage taken from Stealth Rock and allows it to switch in four times when Stealth Rock is on the field. 220 Speed EVs allow Rotom-H to outrun Metagross prior to Mega Evolution, Bisharp, and Breloom and OHKO them with Overheat. The remaining EVs are placed in Defense with a Bold nature to increase Rotom-H's physical bulk slightly, which also hits a jump point, allowing Rotom-H to take hits from the likes of Talonflame better. Leftovers provides passive recovery which can slightly alleviate Rotom-H's weakness to Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-H should be switched into Steel-, Grass-, and Flying-types to threaten them out with Overheat and Volt Switch in order to cripple them or to gain momentum. If a switch is predicted, use Volt Switch in order to gain momentum, but be wary of Ground-type switch-ins. Rotom-H should also be switched into dangerous threats such as Mega Charizard X and Volcarona so that it can attempt to cripple them with Thunder Wave as soon as possible. Pain Split should be used to stay healthy when Rotom-H is weakened and can also be used to weaken Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Garchomp.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal is necessary when using Rotom-H, so Starmie, Latios, and Latias are viable team options. All of them appreciate Rotom-H covering Steel-types for them, while they can wear down Heatran in conjunction with Rotom-H or, in Latios's case, KO it right away with Surf or Earthquake. Starmie, Latios, and Latias are also capable of checking Keldeo, which is a big threat to Rotom-H. Pokemon capable of checking Excadrill such as Azumarill, Breloom, Tangrowth, Landorus-T, and even Mega Alakazam all help deal with Rotom-H's weakness to sand teams. Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion can pressure Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Mega Diancie, while Rotom-H takes on Flying-types and bulky Grass-types. Grass-types such as Serperior, Breloom, and Mega Venusaur can handle Water-types, while Rotom-H weakens or cripples opposing Fire-types such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard X, and Volcarona. Fairy-types like Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Diancie appreciate Rotom-H taking on Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn for them, while they handle Dragon-types that can be annoying for Rotom-H such as Kyurem-B, Latios, and Garchomp. Gengar in particular is a good teammate, as it appreciates Rotom-H taking on Tornadus-T for it and can spread status if Gengar is using Hex.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-W acts as one of the best pivots in the tier. Its defensive typing of Water / Electric allows it to check Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Mega Pinsir as well as Fire-types like Heatran and Talonflame. Rotom-W's defensive capabilities are further enhanced thanks to its ability Levitate, which allows it to dodge Ground-type moves from the likes of Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Sand Rush Excadrill, making its Electric typing less exploitable. Its access to utility moves like Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave allows it to cripple physical attackers like Mega Metagross, Excadrill, and Tyranitar or cripple faster threats like Latios and Tornadus-T. However, Rotom-W's low HP stat combined with its lack of reliable recovery makes it easy to wear down and also leaves it weak to status effects such as poison and burn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ice can also be used as a more reliable way to hit Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor, as Hydro Pump has low PP and a chance to miss.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Serperior can threaten Rotom-W with a Leaf Storm and set up a Substitute freely on it. Ferrothorn can absorb attacks from Rotom-W and can beat it one-on-one with Power Whip or Leech Seed. Mega Venusaur, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss can all take hits from Rotom-W and threaten it with a Giga Drain. Rotom-W can, however, gain momentum on these Grass-types as they switch in via Volt Switch or cripple them with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Clefable can absorb Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp, recover off any damage thanks to Leftovers and Soft-Boiled, and slowly wear it down with Moonblast. Mega Altaria does not mind being burned, as it has access to Heal Bell, can set up on Rotom-W with Dragon Dance, and can recover off any damage thanks to Roost.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Latios can easily switch into Rotom-W and threaten it with a STAB Psychic or Draco Meteor. Mega Latias can set up Calm Mind on Rotom-W but can be annoyed by Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can wall Rotom-W and cripple it with Toxic. Chansey does, however, have a lot of HP, making it a perfect target for Rotom-W to use Pain Split on. Choice Scarf Rotom-W can also cripple Chansey with Trick, making it essentially useless.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: With its lack of reliable recovery and low HP stat, Rotom-W can easily be worn down or powered through. Some punishing attacks include Zen Headbutt from Mega Metagross, High Jump Kick from Mega Medicham, Hidden Power Grass and Secret Sword from Keldeo, Energy Ball from Manaphy, Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor and Psychic from Latios, Moonblast from Mega Diancie, Return from Mega Lopunny, and Thunderbolt from Mega Latias and Thundurus.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: With its lack of reliable recovery, status moves like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp put Rotom-W on a timer, forcing it to switch out.</p>",

Volt Switch acts as Rotom-W's main Electric-type STAB move, and it can also be used to gain momentum after pivoting into a threat. Pain Split acts as a form of recovery, but it is unreliable. Will-O-Wisp allows Rotom-W to cripple Tyranitar, Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, Landorus-T, and many other physical attackers. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can be used to cripple fast foes like Tornadus-T and Latios, making them easier to revenge kill, as well as common switch-ins like Clefable. Levitate gives Rotom-W useful immunities to Ground-type attacks and Spikes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP EVs with near-maximum Defense EVs and a Bold nature allow Rotom-W to better take on physical attackers like Sand Rush Excadrill, Mega Metagross, Gliscor, and Mega Pinsir. The remaining 8 EVs are thrown into Speed, which allows Rotom-W to outspeed Pokemon up to Adamant Crawdaunt. Alternatively, EVs can be taken out of Defense and put into Speed to allow Rotom-W to outspeed threats like Adamant Mega Scizor and Jolly Bisharp. Leftovers is especially useful given how Rotom-W does not have a form of reliable recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-W should be used as a pivot into Sand Rush Excadrill, Landorus-T, Mega Pinsir, Heatran, and other common threats. Do keep in mind that Rotom-W cannot consistently switch into threats because its lack of recovery outside of Leftovers and Pain Split makes it very easy to wear down. Volt Switch should be used to gain momentum or as a way of getting a teammate in safely. Pain Split can be used when Rotom-W is low on HP and the opponent has a Pokemon with a high amount of HP out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tornadus-T is a great partner, as it can form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W while also checking Grass-types like Serperior that can threaten Rotom-W and providing Knock Off support. Heatran can help Rotom-W deal with Grass-types like Serperior as well as Fairy-types like Clefable that can threaten it as well as absorb Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, which put Rotom-W on a timer. It also appreciates Rotom-W's ability to take on Water-types like Slowbro as well as Ground-types like Gliscor and Sand Rush Excadrill. Mega Charizard Y can help Rotom-W take on Grass-types like Tangrowth and Serperior while also appreciating Rotom-W using Volt Switch to bring it in safely as well as paralyzing fast threats like Tornadus-T and Latios, making it harder for Mega Charizard Y to be revenge killed. Tyranitar can eliminate threats like Latios and Latias, which can both check Rotom-W, and also appreciates Rotom-W's ability to take on Ground-types like Excadrill and Gliscor. Excadrill can help Rotom-W check Fairy-types that can annoy it like Mega Altaria and Clefable while also providing Rapid Spin support, while Rotom-W can switch into Ground-type moves that threaten Excadrill like Earthquakes from Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Sand Rush Excadrill. Ferrothorn can provide entry hazards in Stealth Rock and Spikes and resist Fairy-type attacks from the likes of Mega Altaria and Clefable. Ferrothorn also appreciates Rotom-W's ability to take on Fire-types that can threaten it like Heatran as well as physical attackers that can set up on it like Swords Dance Mega Scizor and Gliscor.

Thunder Wave is used as a way to cripple the Speed of fast threats like Latios, Tornadus-T, and Serperior, making them easier to revenge kill. Additionally, Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple physical attackers or put foes on a timer. Pain Split is also an option as a way to stay healthy, but it is unreliable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf makes Rotom-W a fast and reliable revenge killer. 236 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Rotom-W to outspeed foes up to Mega Alakazam before using Trick. The remaining EVs go into HP and Defense to allow Rotom-W to take on attacks better from foes like Excadrill, Heatran, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T. Levitate is Rotom-W's only ability, allowing it to avoid Spikes and Ground-type attacks. Additionally, a spread of 240 HP / 16 SpA / 252 Spe with a Modest nature can be run to boost Rotom-W's damage output, but this spread does make it slower than Mega Alakazam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set can be used to grab momentum via Volt Switch, revenge kill foes thanks to its Choice Scarf, or cripple defensive foes like Clefable and Chansey with Trick, making them very predictable. Because this set is more offensive, it is not a reliable answer to threats like Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, and Mega Pinsir. Pivot Rotom-W into moves that cannot harm it, such as a Choice-locked attack like Pursuit from Tyranitar or Flash Cannon from Magnezone or a Ground-type attack like Earthquake from Gliscor, Sand Rush Excadrill, or Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Heatran can provide Stealth Rock support and help Rotom-W deal with Grass-types like Serperior and Tangrowth as well as Dragon-type attacks like Draco Meteor from Latios, while Rotom-W can take on Ground-types like Gliscor and Sand Rush Excadrill for it. Excadrill can help Rotom-W deal with Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Altaria while also providing Rapid Spin support, making Rotom-W's Volt Switch more effective. Tornadus-T can form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W and can also check Grass-types like Serperior and Tangrowth that threaten it. Mega Scizor can also form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W, checks Fairy- and Grass-types, and appreciates Rotom-W's ability to check Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Mega Pinsir as well as Fire-types like Heatran and Talonflame. Mega Metagross can also deal with Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Altaria while also appreciating Rotom-W dealing with bulky Water-types like Slowbro and using Volt Switch to give it a free switch-in. Clefable can help Rotom-W absorb status moves like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, which otherwise put Rotom-W on a timer, while also appreciating its ability to deal with Clefable checks like Sand Rush Excadrill, Heatran, and Gliscor. Setup Pokemon like Swords Dance Bisharp and Mega Pinsir as well as Belly Drum Azumarill appreciate Rotom-W's ability to chip at fast foes like Latios, Keldeo, and Mega Lopunny while also providing them with Volt Switch support to come in. Pokemon like Rocky Helmet Garchomp and Ferrothorn are appreciated because they can punish foes that can gain momentum with slower U-turns than Rotom-W's Volt Switch, like Tornadus-T, adding contact damage onto damage from Rotom-W's Volt Switch.

    "overview": "<p>Azelf finds itself being one of the most effective suicide leads in OU again as Mega Sableye has been banned, its high Speed tier and access to Taunt and Explosion grant it many opportunities to set up Stealth Rock, shutting down slower Pokemon such as Garchomp with Taunt, while Explosion allows Azelf to block Defog and Rapid Spin, giving its teammates an opportunity to come in afterwards. However, problems Azelf face are faster Taunt users such as Tornadus-T and Alakazam, as well as being forced to run a Steel-type move or Skill Swap to deal with Mega Diancie.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Azelf's high Speed makes it a good user of Trick in order to lock a foe into a single move, but it has better things to do and already stallbreaks well enough with Taunt. Thunder Wave can be used to shut down opposing sweepers, but Azelf lacks room for the move. Rain Dance and Damp Rock can be used to set up rain for offensive rain teams that want to wait on bringing Politoed in. A special attacking lead set can be used due to Azelf's colorful offensive movepool, but it is almost completely outclassed by Alakazam and its Mega Evolution; nevertheless, Azelf has access to Fire Blast, Nasty Plot, and Explosion to set it apart.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Tyranitar will OHKO Azelf with Crunch, while Azelf cannot do anything back. Weavile and Bisharp will bring Azelf down to its Focus Sash, and both will move first due to the former's higher Speed and the latter's access to Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Once Azelf’s Focus Sash has been broken, it can be easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Weavile and Tornadus-T, Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion and Keldeo, and priority moves from the likes of Mega Scizor, Azumarill, and Talonflame.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: Though Defoggers and Rapid Spin users such as Latios and Starmie cannot threaten Azelf directly due to the threat of Taunt and Explosion, they can easily wipe out your team's entry hazards once Azelf faints.</p> <p><strong>Fast Taunt Users</strong>: Tornadus-T and Alakazam can both Taunt Azelf and prevent it from setting up entry hazards. Fortunately, faster Taunt users are rare.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Sandstorm damage, poison, and burn are all ways to break Azelf's Focus Sash, allowing it to be OHKOed.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit Moves</strong>: Mega Heracross's Pin Missile and Breloom's Bullet Seed are two ways to break Azelf's Focus Sash. However, Azelf outspeeds both these Pokemon, so it will always be able to at least set up Stealth Rock before fainting.</p>",

      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Azelf's objective is to set up Stealth Rock quickly, which it can do easily because of its high Speed. Explosion deals an insane amount of damage even on a resisted hit and prevents foes from removing entry hazards on the turn it is used. Skill Swap can be used instead to steal Magic Bounce from Mega Diancie, allowing Azelf to not have to worry about its Stealth Rock being bounced back, while Hidden Power Steel is an option to hit Mega Diancie for super effective damage and potentially OHKO it, preventing Skill Swap mind games. Iron Tail can be used if netting the OHKO on Mega Diancie is crucial but has a nasty miss rate in return. Taunt allows Azelf to shut down slower entry hazard leads and users of status moves in general.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>228 Defense EVs are used to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Lopunny's Fake Out followed by Return, preventing it from anti-leading Azelf and turning it into dead weight. 28 Special Attack EVs give Azelf a 50% chance to OHKO Naive Mega Diancie. The remaining EVs go into Speed to allow Azelf to outspeed everything up to base 115 Speed, meaning that it can usually set up Stealth Rock very easily. A Naive nature is necessary to maximize Azelf's Speed without cutting into either of its offensive stats. Focus Sash is critical due to the suicide nature of the set, as it guarantees that Azelf will survive a single powerful attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Keep in mind that Azelf will almost always be using Stealth Rock and then Explosion directly after. However, if the foe does not threaten Azelf offensively, feel free to use Taunt should Azelf be running the move. Because Azelf is a very obvious choice as a lead, don't lead with it if the opponent has a reliable answer to it, such as Bisharp for non-Fire Blast variants. If facing a Pokemon that can use Azelf as setup bait, Taunt it. However, not many Pokemon can reliably set up on Azelf due to the threat of Explosion. Prediction is key if you are running Skill Swap, as the opponent can decide whether or not to Mega Evolve their Diancie right away.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Azelf finds a home on many hyper offense teams that appreciate its Stealth Rock support. Sweepers such as Keldeo enjoy having their foes softened a bit, thus allowing them to land crucial KOs that they would not achieve without the chip damage. Bisharp can help keep Stealth Rock on the opponent's side of the field because it threatens users of Defog as well as Starmie. Gengar can attempt to spinblock in order to gain momentum against the likes of Starmie, but it can find itself OHKOed by Psyshock.</p>"

  "Manaphy": {
    "overview": "<p>Manaphy is one of the best wallbreakers and stallbreakers in the tier thanks to Tail Glow. Manaphy also has a wide movepool consisting of many coverage moves, which includes Energy Ball for Water-types like Rotom-W and Slowbro; Ice Beam to hit Latios, Mega Latias, Mega Altaria, and Tangrowth; and Psychic to hit Pokemon like Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Keldeo. Manaphy's ability Hydration removes all status aliments in the rain, making moves like Rest and Rain Dance good moves to run. Manaphy does, however, have an average Speed stat, making fast offensive threats like Serperior, Mega Lopunny, Latios, and Thundurus threats. Manaphy also heavily relies on Tail Glow, making it subpar when it doesn't use a turn to set up, and its typing makes it vulnerable to common types like Electric and Grass.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire is helpful for baiting in and heavily damaging or removing foes like Ferrothorn, which can help other teammates that appreciate Ferrothorn being gone. Rest is a viable option with Rain Dance to heal Manaphy to full while also not putting it to sleep as long as rain is up thanks to Hydration. Sitrus Berry is a viable option for an item, as it allows Manaphy to tank more hits from foes. Salac Berry can also be used, boosting Manaphy's Speed and making it harder for foes to revenge kill.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Thundurus is able to threaten Manaphy with a Thunderbolt and take one hit from it. Magnezone shares a similar role where it can take any one hit from Manaphy without a Tail Glow boost while also outspeeding and threatening it with an Electric-type move like Thunderbolt or Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Ferrothorn is one of Manaphy's best checks, as it's able to take attacks from Manaphy while retaliating back with Power Whip. Mega Venusaur is able to beat Manaphy one-on-one unless Manaphy is running Psychic by tanking hits and retaliating with Giga Drain. Serperior is able to threaten Manaphy with Leaf Storm and can also take a single Ice Beam. Manaphy can, however, tank one unboosted Leaf Storm. Assault Vest Tangrowth can survive a Tail Glow-boosted Ice Beam and return damage with Giga Drain. Do note that Manaphy can tank a Giga Drain if needed, as Giga Drain is only a 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Fast Offensive Foes</strong>: With an average Speed stat, strong threats that are faster than Manaphy like Mega Lopunny, Mega Metagross, Choice Specs Latios and Keldeo, Mega Latias, Jolly Excadrill, Weavile, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Landorus-T, and Magnezone can all deal a great amount of damage to and revenge kill Manaphy. Most of these threats, however, do not appreciate switching into Manaphy.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: If Chansey runs Thunder Wave or Toxic, it is able to beat Manaphy that lack Rain Dance. If Manaphy has Rain Dance or Chansey lacks Toxic or Thunder Wave, it is not a reliable counter, as it loses to Manaphy one-on-one.</p>",

      "Tail Glow + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tail Glow allows Manaphy to easily break through defensive cores. STAB Surf is Manaphy's main move to hit walls like Chansey and Clefable as well as common Fire-, Ground-, and Rock-types, which includes Heatran, Excadrill, and Tyranitar. Ice Beam hits Grass-types like Serperior, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth; Dragon-types like Latios, Mega Latias, and Mega Altaria; Flying-types like Zapdos and Tornadus-T; and Ground-types that are 4x weak to Ice like Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. Energy Ball gives Manaphy coverage to hit other Water-types like Slowbro, Rotom-W, Keldeo, Suicune, and other Manaphy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs with a Modest nature allow Manaphy to OHKO Mega Metagross after one Tail Glow and 2HKO Chansey after two Tail Glows while being as fast as possible. A Timid nature allows Manaphy to Speed tie with threats like Mega Charizard Y and Mega Medicham that run a Timid or Jolly nature. Leftovers gives Manaphy passive recovery, helping it stay healthy. Lum Berry is a also viable option to remove status ailments like paralysis, Toxic poison, and burn, making it easier for Manaphy to set up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Manaphy enjoys setting up on foes that cannot threaten it back like Heatran, Skarmory, Gliscor, and Choice-locked Pokemon like Choice Scarf Magnezone and Tyranitar locked into Hidden Power Fire and Pursuit, respectively. Manaphy appreciates faster foes being crippled through means like paralysis and removing Choice Scarfs or eliminated. If Manaphy is holding Lum Berry, use it to set up freely on foes that use status moves like Thunder Wave from Clefable and Slowbro and Spore from Amoonguss. Be wary of the foe's status moves like Thunder Wave, which can cripple Manaphy's Speed, and Toxic, which can slowly chip it down.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone is a good partner, as it can remove Ferrothorn while also being able to trap and revenge kill Mega Metagross. Mega Metagross can Pursuit trap Latios and Latias while also checking Clefable and wearing down Ferrothorn. Latios can remove entry hazards and wear down similar checks like Ferrothorn, Clefable, and Chansey. Latios can also bait Tyranitar to use Pursuit, giving Manaphy a free turn to set up with Tail Glow. Healing Wish users like Latias and Clefable can restore Manaphy's health and remove any status. Latias can also remove hazards for Manaphy, while Clefable can provide Thunder Wave and Knock Off support. Manaphy appreciates teammates that can help with speed control, which makes Sticky Web Shuckle a great partner, making Manaphy harder to revenge kill.</p>"
      },
      "Tail Glow + Rain Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tail Glow enables Manaphy to bust through defensive teams. Rain Dance helps Manaphy remove status effects thanks to its ability Hydration while also boosting the damage of its Surf. Surf is Manaphy's strongest STAB move and main move to break through walls like Chansey. Ice Beam is used to hit Grass- and Dragon-types like Amoonguss, Serperior, Tangrowth, Latios, Mega Altaria, and Mega Latias. Psychic is also a viable option, as it can hit Pokemon like Keldeo, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>240 HP EVs give Manaphy a high chance to avoid a 2HKO from Mega Metagross while also always surviving a Thunderbolt from Choice Scarf Magnezone even after Stealth Rock damage. They also allow Manaphy to always avoid the 2HKO from maximum Special Attack Life Orb Clefable and the OHKO from Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor. 160 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature let Manaphy OHKO Mega Metagross after Stealth Rock damage and one Tail Glow boost. 108 Speed EVs allow Manaphy to outspeed Jolly Bisharp, Mega Metagross before it Mega Evolves, and defensive Garchomp.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Manaphy should look to set up on Pokemon that cannot threaten it like Heatran; Landorus-T; and Choice-locked Pokemon like Pursuit Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Ice Shard Choice Band Weavile, and Hidden Power Fire Magnezone. When Manaphy is paralyzed, poisoned by Toxic, or burned, use Rain Dance to remove the status effect. This also means that Manaphy has an easier time setting up versus more defensive Pokemon such as Clefable and Chansey, as their status moves won't be effective. You can also use Rain Dance before Manaphy has a status aliment on it to keep it safe from status. With less Special Attack, Manaphy appreciates its counters like Ferrothorn and Chansey being weakened or eliminated before setting up. Also, keep in mind Rain Dance also boosts the damage output of Surf. Faster threats like Thundurus, Mega Lopunny, Latios, and Mega Metagross can revenge kill Manaphy but can rarely OHKO it thanks to the extra EVs invested into HP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Metagross has access to Pursuit to trap and eliminate Latios and Mega Latias and get chip damage on Chansey as it switches out. Mega Metagross can also wear down Ferrothorn with Hammer Arm while also checking Clefable. Magnezone can remove Ferrothorn for Manaphy and can also revenge kill or wear down Mega Metagross. Latias can provide entry hazard removal thanks to Defog while also providing Healing Wish support. Latios can wear down Manaphy's checks and counters like Ferrothorn, Chansey, and Clefable. Tornadus-T can help Manaphy deal with Grass-types like Serperior while also appreciating Manaphy's Rain Dance, allowing Hurricane to always hit. Excadrill is a good partner, as it's able to check common Electric-types that threaten Manaphy while also removing entry hazards thanks to Rapid Spin and providing Stealth Rock support. Weavile can Pursuit trap Latios and Latias, weaken Tornadus-T, and offensively check Mega Metagross that lack Bullet Punch. Weavile can also remove items like Leftovers from Ferrothorn and Eviolite from Chansey, making it easier for Manaphy to break through them.</p>"

  "Victini": {
    "overview": "<p>Victini's main claim to fame is its access to V-create, one of the most powerful moves in Pokemon. Thanks to this, alongside its wide movepool, it can act as a solid wallbreaker, with barely any truly reliable counters to its name. Moreover, it has a decent typing with good resistances to common types such as Fairy, Fire, Steel, Psychic, and Fighting alongside good natural bulk, which enables it to check big threats such as Scizor, Mega Metagross, Mega Gardevoir, Breloom, and Clefable lacking Thunder Wave. Unfortunately, it suffers from a large number of flaws, such as V-create's Speed drop, which makes Victini very exploitable after using it. And while its Speed is good, it doesn't match up to many OU threats such as Latios, Keldeo, and Starmie, which can revenge kill it easily. Its typing also leaves it weak to common offensive types like Water, Ground, and Dark, which in turn makes it vulnerable to many common Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Azumarill, and Garchomp. Furthermore, its role as a wallbreaker is severely hindered by its weakness to Stealth Rock, as well as the popularity of Choice Scarf Tyranitar, which can Pursuit trap it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Victini can use a Choice Scarf set; however, it's severely lacking in power when compared to other sets, it lacks the typing to revenge kill a lot of sweepers, and its Stealth Rock weakness makes it a poor offensive pivot. Trick Room is an option to take advantage of V-create's Speed drops, but Victini is a bit fast for that.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Pursuit trappers can permanently remove Victini from play, making them big threats to it. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can switch in on any move bar Focus Blast, can OHKO Victini with a boosted Pursuit if it has previously used V-create, and is guaranteed to OHKO Victini with Stone Edge after Sandstorm damage. While Bisharp cannot switch in on Victini, if Victini has KOed something with V-create, Bisharp can outspeed it and OHKO it with a boosted Pursuit. Weavile, on the other hand, just needs a free switch in on Victini to be guaranteed to outspeed it and OHKO it with Pursuit if it tries to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types resist both V-create and Bolt Strike, Victini's two primary moves, making them good answers to it. Mega Charizard X is one of the safest answers to Victini, since it resists V-create and takes, at worst, neutral damage from all of its coverage moves, meaning it only fears an uncommon Psychic-type STAB move. Mega Latias is a surefire answer to the Life Orb set, taking little damage from Glaciate and resisting all its other moves; however, it struggles to switch into U-turn from the Choice Band set. Conversely, Garchomp is a full stop to the Choice Band set thanks to Rough Skin giving Victini a huge amount of recoil; however, it cannot switch into Glaciate. Still, it survives one from full health and can OHKO back with Earthquake, and offensive sets will always beat Victini by outspeeding and OHKOing it. Latios and Latias act as good checks to Victini and deal massive damage to it with Draco Meteor; however, they fear both Glaciate and U-turn. Mega Altaria does a good job of switching into almost all of Victini's moves and doesn't even fear Glaciate much so long as it runs enough bulk investment. Dragonite can take V-create relatively well, but it fears Choice Band-boosted Bolt Strike and Glaciate, especially if its Multiscale is broken.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types can easily take V-create from the Choice Band set; however, they are not good checks to the Life Orb set, since they fear either Bolt Strike or Energy Ball. Mega Slowbro has just enough bulk to take a Choice Band-boosted Bolt Strike, but it goes down to Grass Knot or Energy Ball from the Life Orb set. Regular Slowbro, Alomomola, and Suicune can take V-create and U-turn decently, but are all 2HKOed by Choice Band-boosted Bolt Strike and Life Orb Energy Ball. Quagsire and Gastrodon only fear Trick from the Choice Band set, but they too fear Grass-type coverage from the mixed set. Keldeo can take neither Bolt Strike nor Energy Ball, but it can switch into V-create and OHKO back with Hydro Pump. Furthermore, Choice Scarf Keldeo does not fear Icy Wind, since it outspeeds Victini even after the Speed drop. In the same vein, Starmie can switch into V-create and OHKO Victini back; however, Choice Band-boosted V-create can OHKO the offensive set after Stealth Rock damage, and Starmie can't take U-turn from it at all. Rotom-W acts as a decent check to the Choice Band set, but it can get worn down by repeated U-turns and takes a huge amount of damage from Bolt Strike. Azumarill and Crawdaunt can take V-create from Victini, and, after the Defense drop, OHKO back with Choice Band-boosted Aqua Jet. Manaphy can switch into V-create, outspeed Victini, and OHKO it back with Scald, while Mega Gyarados has the bulk to take any move from Victini and OHKO back with Crunch or Waterfall. Rain sweepers like Kingdra, Kabutops, and Mega Swampert can easily check Victini, especially Kingdra, which takes neutral damage from both Bolt Strike and Energy Ball.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran's Fire immunity and neutrality to Victini's other common moves make it a good check; however, it does take a huge amount of damage from Choice Band-boosted Bolt Strike.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types naturally act as good checks to Victini thanks to their natural bulk, Electric immunity, and access to super effective STAB moves. Defensive Landorus-T can take one V-create from the Choice Band set and OHKO back, and while it can't take Glaciate from the Life Orb set, if it's running Choice Scarf, it can switch in on any other move from that set, outspeed it, and OHKO it. Gliscor, much like Landorus-T, can't take two V-creates from Choice Band Victini, but it can take one if it's physically defensive and is almost guaranteed to OHKO back with Earthquake. Hippowdon can't take two V-creates from the Choice Band set or two Grass moves from the Life Orb set, however; it can take one and deal massive damage back with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: While they are uncommon, Rock-types usually serve as good checks to Victini. Mega Diancie can take any move from Victini, including Energy Ball, and OHKO back with Diamond Storm. Mega Aerodactyl and Terrakion both fear Bolt Strike and Icy Wind, but they can take any other move and OHKO with Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers and Choice Scarf users</strong>: While they cannot necessarily switch into it, many faster attackers can revenge kill Victini, such as Excadrill under sand, Talonflame, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "MixTini": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>V-create is Victini's main STAB move, bringing extremely high Base Power and having perfect accuracy with Victory Star. Bolt Strike is a powerful coverage move that hits Water-types such as Manaphy, Azumarill, Keldeo, and Starmie as well as Talonflame super effectively. Glaciate enables Victini to hit Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Latios, and Latias, as well as certain Ground-types that are physically bulky enough to comfortably switch into V-create like Landorus-T and Gliscor. It can also slow down faster foes such as Keldeo and Starmie, enabling Victini to outspeed them on the next turn. Energy Ball allows Victini to 2HKO standard Hippowdon, Rotom-W, and Slowbro, which otherwise wall it, as well as hit other physically bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Quagsire, and Gastrodon. Grass Knot can be use over Energy Ball in order to hit Hippowdon, Tyranitar, Mega Slowbro, and Suicune harder; however, it deals less damage to Slowbro and little-to-no damage to Rotom-W. Focus Blast can also be used to 2HKO Heatran and Tyranitar; however, both still take a lot of damage from Life Orb-boosted Bolt Strike and Energy Ball, respectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb increases Victini's damage output without locking it into a move, making it much easier for it to wallbreak. An Expert Belt can be chosen in order to bluff a Choiced set more easily, as well as prevent Victini from being worn down via recoil, while still dealing a solid amount of damage to Glaciate and Grass Knot targets, but this makes a neutral V-create significantly weaker and requires more Special Attack investment to 2HKO or OHKO the likes of Latios and Landorus-T. Victory Star makes it so that V-create and Glaciate can never miss and increases the accuracy of Bolt Strike to 92%. This EV spread enables Victini to 2HKO Slowbro and Hippowdon with Energy Ball, OHKO defensive Landorus-T after Stealth Rock, 2HKO Latios after Stealth Rock, and OHKO Naive Garchomp with Glaciate, all the while hitting as hard as possible with physical moves. A Naive nature guarantees that Victini will survive Hippowdon's Earthquake from full health after Life Orb and sand damage, enabling it to beat it one-on-one. It also helps against other physical attackers like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Talonflame. However, a Hasty nature is preferred if Victini serves as the team's main check to special attackers such as Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>V-create is a relatively difficult move to switch into, since most Pokemon that resist it either lack recovery and bulk, meaning they can take it only a couple of times, or are slower than Victini even after the Speed drop and can be hit by the appropriate coverage move next turn. This makes it a worthwhile move to use most of the time. If faster Fire-resistant foes such as Latios, Keldeo, and Talonflame or bulkier Pokemon that can easily take V-create such as Heatran, Tyranitar, and Garchomp are still active, try to predict around them. Otherwise, you should only attempt to hit what Victini is facing with the appropriate coverage move. Glaciate is a good move to use on forced switches, since not only does it 2HKO a handful of Victini's switchins, but it also slows down checks like Keldeo, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Choice Scarf Heatran, which eases prediction against them, as they can be hit by the appropriate coverage move the following turn. However, if the opponent is using a Glaciate target, you may want to scout their reaction to Victini before revealing it. This works better on bulky teams, which can give Victini multiple opportunities to come in, especially if VoltTurn support is employed. Grass coverage and Bolt Strike should rarely be used on switches, since most of their targets already take massive damage from these moves and can just be hit with them next turn. The only notable exceptions are Slowbro and, if Victini is weakened to the point where Brave Bird KOes it, Talonflame. Mixed Victini is at its most effective against defensive teams, so when facing those, try keeping it healthy until its checks have been weakened. Against offensive teams, Victini should take advantage of Glaciate in order to help teammates that would want certain offensive Pokemon to be slowed down. Try not to send out Victini when Pursuit trappers are still active, since they can remove it from play, especially Choice Scarf Tyranitar, which switches into it quite easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Victini fits well on more offensive teams that require a wallbreaker with the usual defensive qualities associated with a Fire- or Psychic- type, such as the ability to check certain Fairy-, Steel-, Fighting-, and Fire-types. Victini's weakness to Pursuit users and Dark-types in general requires it to be paired with a Dark-type check that can take advantage of these such as Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, or Azumarill. Victini hugely benefits from VoltTurn support, since it has trouble finding opportunities to switch in due to its typing, Stealth Rock weakness, and relatively low Speed. Teammates that benefit from bulky Ground- and Water-types being eliminated, such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Charizard X, Excadrill, and Mega Metagross, appreciate Victini's support. Due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, Victini requires support from an entry hazard remover such as Excadrill, Latios, or Starmie; however, the latter two stack a crippling Dark weakness with Victini. Electric-types like Raikou, Mega Manectric, and Thundurus are also great partners, since Victini can lure the Ground- and Dragon-types that check them, all the while enjoying Volt Switch support. Landorus-T is a good teammate for Victini, since it provides U-turn support to enable Victini to get on the field safely, checks Excadrill and Tyranitar, and benefits from Garchomp, opposing Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and bulky Water-types being eliminated by Victini. Victini enjoys Spikes support, since it can quickly wear down checks to it such as Heatran, Tyranitar, Keldeo, Azumarill, and Suicune, as well as lure Latios, Latias, and Starmie, all three of which are common hazard removers.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>V-create is Victini's most powerful STAB move by far; it is incredibly strong and 2HKOes almost all Pokemon that do not resist it. Bolt Strike is a very strong coverage move that hits Water-types such as Manaphy, Keldeo, Azumarill, and Slowbro super effectively. It also gets good neutral coverage on other Pokemon that resist Fire such as Heatran and Rotom-W. U-turn enables Victini to hit Latios, Latias, and Tyranitar very hard, wear down checks like Rotom-W, and take advantage of forced switches by getting a teammate in for free, thus generating momentum for the team. Trick can disable defensive Pokemon like Quagsire and Heatran. It also lets Victini get rid of its Choice lock, which may be beneficial against slower teams that can easily play around it. Zen Headbutt can be used in order to 2HKO Mega Charizard X, which otherwise walls Victini. Brick Break hits Heatran and Tyranitar super effectively; however, both of these are already hit very hard by Bolt Strike.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band enables Victini to hit incredibly hard, especially with V-create. It is preferred over a Life Orb because the lack of recoil gives Victini more longevity and makes it harder to wear down, which in turn makes it a more consistent check to the likes of Clefable and Ferrothorn. Victory Star increases the accuracy of V-create and Bolt Strike. Maximum Attack and Speed investment lets Victini hit as hard as possible. A Jolly nature enables Victini to Speed tie with opposing positive-natured base 100 Pokemon, particularly Manaphy. However, an Adamant nature can also be chosen in order to give Victini even more firepower; for instance, it can 2HKO Rotom-W after Stealth Rock damage much more easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>You should always remove entry hazards before sending Victini in, since the residual damage will severely compromise its role as a wallbreaker and U-turn user by preventing it from outlasting its checks. V-create should be used when Pokemon that resist Fire are gone or weakened to the point where V-create will KO them. Use U-turn early on in the battle in order to weaken Victini's checks, ease prediction, and let a teammate come in for free. U-turn is especially good against Pokemon that cannot deal much damage to Victini and must therefore switch out. Don't rely on U-turn too much, though, since the opponent may predict it and stay in, preventing you from reliably gaining momentum. Trick is a good move to use if Victini would benefit more from the ability to switch moves than the raw power brought by the Choice Band. It is particularly useful against stall teams, whose answers to Victini are usually severely crippled by Trick. Against more offensive teams whose Fire-type checks lack reliable recovery, V-create is a very safe move to use, unless the opposing team has Heatran or Garchomp. In the latter case, Victini should not be sent out at all, unless your team would benefit from Garchomp being weakened at the cost of losing Victini. Use Bolt Strike when you predict Talonflame, Heatran, or bulky Water-types that are not part Ground-types to switch in. However, it is usually better to use U-turn early on in the battle, in order to gauge the opponent's reaction to Victini, and use Bolt Strike later on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Victini fits well on offensive teams that require a physical wallbreaker that can weaken Pokemon like Landorus-T and Hippowdon so that other Pokemon can sweep, all the while serving as a decent check to certain Fairy-, Fire-, Fighting-, and Steel- types. Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, and Terrakion can take advantage of Pursuit trappers, which can easily remove Victini after it KOes a Pokemon. Victini is severely hampered by Garchomp's presence on the opposing team in general, so something that can weaken Garchomp, such as Ice Punch Lopunny, Ice Punch Metagross, or Swords Dance Landorus-T, can also help it considerably by quickly and painlessly removing it. Entry hazards are extremely crippling for Victini, since it has a Stealth Rock weakness and must switch out often due to its Choice lock. Hence, Victini should be paired up with a hazard remover, such as Skarmory. Spikes and Toxic Spikes really help Victini by wearing down or disabling checks to it such as Garchomp and Quagsire. However, if they are used, a spinner such as Excadrill is preferred over a Defogger. Bisharp is a particularly good partner for Victini because it not only deters hazard removal with Defiant but also helps wear down other checks such as Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Keldeo. Victini is very weak to sand teams and requires a check to Sand Rush Excadrill, such as Azumarill, Breloom, Rotom-W, or Mega Alakazam. Victini works very well in VoltTurn cores due to its access to U-turn as well as its low Speed making it difficult for it to come in without support from a slow pivot. As a result, U-turn or Volt Switch users such as Landorus-T, Scizor, Tornadus-T, and Mega Manectric are all good partners. Grass-types like Mega Venusaur help Victini handle the Water- and Ground-types it tends to struggle with.</p>"

  "Serperior": {
    "overview": "<p>Serperior acts as a powerful sweeper thanks to its great Special Attack and Speed as well as its access to Contrary, which allows Serperior to boost its Special Attack by two stages every time it uses its strongest STAB move in Leaf Storm. Serperior's decent Speed tier also allows it to outspeed Pokemon like Thundurus, Latios, Mega Diancie, and Mega Metagross. Serperior also has access to a decent number of utility moves; Glare allows it to cripple fast offensive threats such as Tornadus-T, Mega Latias, and Talonflame, and Leech Seed can help stall out and cripple Pokemon like Heatran if run alongside Substitute. However, due to a lack of special coverage moves, Serperior is forced to use Hidden Power Fire to hit Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor or Hidden Power Ground to hit Heatran. Although Serperior has decent typing, its resistances are undermined by common secondary STAB moves from Water-types like Keldeo's Secret Sword and Azumarill's Play Rough. Serperior is definitely a big threat in ORAS OU, but it still has a few hard counters that it cannot deal with.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ice can be used to catch Pokemon that are 4x weak to Ice such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp. Taunt is also an option over Glare or another utility move to prevent entry hazards, setup, recovery, and status moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Talonflame can consistently take attacks from Serperior thanks to Roost and threaten it back with Brave Bird. Tornadus-T can take any hit from Serperior and retaliate back with either Hurricane or Heat Wave or gain momentum on it with U-turn. Serperior can, however, cripple Tornadus-T with Glare on the switch. Mega Pinsir can easily pivot into Serperior and threaten it back with Return or Quick Attack.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: If Serperior lacks Hidden Power Ground, Heatran is able to hard wall it. Mega Charizard Y can take any hit from Serperior as well and threaten it back with a Fire-type move. Serperior can, however, use Glare or Leech Seed on the switch and spam Substitute, which can cripple these checks. Like Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona is able to take any hit from Serperior and retaliate back with a super effective STAB move. However, Serperior is unable to utilize Substitute against Volcarona, as Bug Buzz goes through it, although it can still cripple Volcarona with Glare.</p> <p><strong>Amoonguss</strong>: Amoonguss resists Leaf Storm and can take a +2 Hidden Power Fire. It is also able to hit Serperior with either a strong Sludge Bomb or Clear Smog, which is super effective and removes the boosts from Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey is able to hard wall Serperior while stalling out Leaf Storm's 8 PP. Variants of Serperior carrying either Taunt or Substitute + Leech Seed are able to beat Chansey, however.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Latios, Latias, and Mega Altaria resist Serperior's Leaf Storm. Latios and Latias are able to threaten Serperior back with a Psychic- or Dragon-type attack, while Mega Altaria is able to beat Serperior one-on-one with the combination of Dragon Dance and Roost. Do keep in mind that Serperior outspeeds most Dragon-types outside of rare Choice Scarf variants, and that it can also cripple them on the switch with Glare.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Fast threats like Mega Lopunny, Weavile, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T are able to outspeed and finish off Serperior. Serperior is, however, able to cripple them with Glare or do a lot of damage on the switch if they do decide to hard switch in.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: If Serperior gets burned or badly poisoned, it gets put on a timer and into range of enemy attacks. If paralyzed, Serperior will not be able to utilize its excellent Speed and will be easier to revenge kill.</p>",

      "Utility Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm alongside Contrary boosts Serperior's Special Attack by two stages each time it is used. Hidden Power Fire is used to hit Steel-types like Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Hidden Power Ground is also an option to hit Heatran. Glare can be used to paralyze switch-ins to Serperior such as Tornadus-T and Talonflame. Alternatively, Leech Seed allows Serperior to whittle down common checks like Heatran while also restoring its HP. Substitute lets Serperior avoid status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave and eases prediction against switches. Knock Off is also an option to remove items like Chansey's Eviolite or Tornadus-T's Assault Vest. Synthesis can also be run to help Serperior stay healthy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>56 HP EVs stop Rotom-W's Hydro Pump from breaking Serperior's Substitutes. 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Serperior to be as fast as possible, and the rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Attack to make Serperior hit as hard as possible. An alternative spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe is an option to maximize Serperior's breaking power. Leftovers is used to give Serperior more longevity and help it stay as healthy as possible. Contrary is always chosen to allow Serperior to get a boost every time it uses Leaf Storm.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Serperior cannot consistently switch into attacks, so it prefers to come in freely via methods such as a teammate fainting, a pivot move like Volt Switch or U-turn, a double switch, or a switch into a Pokemon that cannot threaten it like Rotom-W. Be aware of Leaf Storm's limited PP. Glare can be used to catch Serperior's checks on the switch like Tornadus-T, Heatran, and Talonflame. A common strategy with Serperior is setting up Substitute on the switch, using Leech Seed the next turn, and spamming Substitute to slowly wear down the foe's health. Hidden Power Fire should be used on Steel-types like Skarmory and Ferrothorn after Serperior gets a boost with Leaf Storm so it can do more damage to them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Serperior struggles with Fire- and Flying-types that can stomach its hits and threaten it back. Keldeo is a good partner, as it's able to take on Fire-types like Heatran while also appreciating Serperior's ability to take on Water-types like Slowbro and Starmie that eat up Keldeo's Water-type moves. Tyranitar can also help remove or weaken Pokemon like Latios, Latias, Heatran, and Talonflame to help Serperior sweep. Weavile has a similar role as Tyranitar in the sense that it has access to Pursuit, but, more importantly, it is able to check Tornadus-T and Grass-types like Amoonguss. VoltTurn users like Rotom-W and Tornadus-T help Serperior to switch in. Mega Charizard Y is a good partner because it is able to wear down Heatran with Focus Blast while also lowering the accuracy of Tornadus-T's Hurricane due to setting sun.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Serperior's high Speed makes it an effective user of dual screens, providing easy setup opportunities for its offensive teammates. Light Screen reduces the damage taken from special attacks, while Reflect reduces the damage taken from physical attacks. Taunt prevents enemy setup moves such as Dragon Dance from Dragonite and Stealth Rock while Serperior sets up dual screens. It also ensures that Defog users cannot remove entry hazards and the dual screens Serperior has set up. Leaf Storm, alongside Contrary, lets Serperior hit decently hard, preventing it from being too passive. Finally, Glare can be used to punish switch-ins such as Tornadus-T and Heatran, and it prevents Pokemon like Mega Charizard X from setting up on Serperior, but Taunt is much preferred to prevent Defog.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread lets Serperior be as fast and bulky as possible, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon like Thundurus, Mega Metagross, and Mega Diancie and ensuring that Serperior can survive heavy hits from Pokemon like Mega Alakazam to set up dual screens. Light Clay is mandatory to increase the duration of dual screens. Most importantly, the EV spread allows Serperior to survive the combination of Fake Out and High Jump Kick from Mega Lopunny.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Serperior can use its high Speed and great utility options to set up dual screens, even at the cost of being KOed. It should make sure to set them up as quickly as possible to provide much easier setup opportunities for its teammates, making them more difficult to revenge kill. If only one move can be used, determine if the opposing team has more physical or special attackers and set up accordingly. Serperior can be preserved for later in the game to come back in and set up the dual screens again in case they wear out. It should also be wary of Knock Off, as losing its Light Clay will reduce the number of turns that it can keep its dual screens up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Serperior set thrives on hyper offense teams, which enjoy the setup opportunities that dual screens provide, as well as other utility options such as Taunt to deny entry hazards and setup opportunities and Glare to cripple switch-ins. A multitude of offensive teammates such as Volcarona, Manaphy, and Mega Charizard X greatly enjoy the support provided by dual screens and are able to use their setup moves in a much safer environment thanks to them. Teammates that help prevent Defog, such as Taunt Mega Alakazam and Defiant Bisharp, are also appreciated, as this allows dual screens to stay on the field for a longer time.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Serperior": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is Serperior's main STAB move, dealing heavy damage and triggering a +2 Special Attack boost through its Contrary ability. Hidden Power Rock hits many of Serperior's switch-ins that resist Grass-type moves such as Zapdos, Thundurus, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard Y. On the other hand, Hidden Power Fire super effectively hits Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Magnezone, and Mega Metagross that would otherwise give Serperior a hard time. Glare paralyzes foes that are faster than Serperior as well as foes that cannot be effectively damaged with Serperior's other moves like Tornadus-T and Heatran. In combination with a Chesto Berry, Rest heals Serperior instantly and removes all status conditions, providing greater longevity.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Max Speed investment and Timid nature are preferred to fully utilize Serperior's base 113 Speed. 200 HP and 44 Defense EVs allow it to survive Mega Lopunny's Fake Out and High Jump Kick as well as a Hurricane from Tornadus-T. The bulk gives Serperior time to accumulate Special Attack boosts through the combination of Leaf Storm and Contrary. With a raised Special Attack and the ability to use Rest later in the game, Serperior can effectively remove some of its threats such as Thundurus and Mega Alakazam. It is worth noting that EVs invested in Special Attack double in value after a single Leaf Storm. Though this set is quite bulky and formidable, it will lack in immediate power even after one Leaf Storm due to a lack of Special Attack investment.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The main advantage of using Rest Serperior is its ability to cure status conditions that Serperior often receives throughout the game. Paralysis is common to get upon switching into Slowbro, Clefable, Thundurus, or even opposing Serperior. Serperior also gets burnt often by switching in on Scalds or Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp. Finally, Serperior often gets poisoned by switching in on Slowbro or Gastrodon. Having a one-time full recovery allows Serperior to get past some of its checks throughout the game if played carefully. A paralysis on Tornadus-T can later lead to a KO with some good positioning and luck.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Serperior functions well in balanced or bulky offense teams. Due to its weakness to fast Flying- and Ice-types such as Tornadus-T and Weavile, respectively, Pokemon like Mega Metagross, Rotom-W, and Heatran make suitable partners. Strong physical attackers like Choice Band Tyranitar and Weavile help Serperior by overcoming defensive cores. Additionally, these teammates can Pursuit trap threats like Latias, Amoonguss, Heatran, and Tornadus-T, and can take advantage of paralysis that Serperior provides with Glare.</p>"

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Excadrill's unique typing, stat distribution, access to both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, and abilities in Sand Rush and Mold Breaker make it a significant offensive threat in the OU tier. Its typing allows it to check Electric- and Fairy-types consistently. Excadrill is one of the most consistent answers to Clefable, thanks to resisting Moonblast, being immune to Thunder Wave, and hitting back hard with STAB Iron Head. Excadrill is also one of the best spinners in the tier, able to threaten common Stealth Rock users like Heatran, Clefable, and Tyranitar. With Leftovers and double resistance to Stealth Rocks, Excadrill becomes one of the best and most consistent Rapid Spin users in the metagame. Thanks to Mold Breaker, Excadrill can threaten Levitate Pokemon with Earthquake, get Stealth Rock up against Mega Diancie, and get past Unaware Pokemon with Swords Dance. If Sand Rush is used, Excadrill becomes an incredible offensive threat, outspeeding the majority of the meta under sand and being able to revenge kill many threats such as +1 Volcarona and Dragonite. Excadrill's main weaknesses are Pokemon that can outspeed and OHKO it, such as Keldeo or Mega Lopunny; Rocky Helmet users, such as Landorus-T and Slowbro; and Cofagrigus, as it can spinblock against Excadrill effectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sitrus Berry and resistance Berries such as Shuca Berry can often prolong Excadrill's life by one turn versus fast-paced teams. Soft Sand and Life Orb are other options that can improve Excadrill's offensive power, especially on the Sand Rush set, at the cost of longevity. Air Balloon can be used on the fast utility set as well. Finally, a mixed defensive set can also see occasional viability; an EV spread of 192 HP / 24 Def / 252 SpD / 40 Spe with a Jolly nature lets Excadrill outspeed Jolly Tyranitar and Adamant Bisharp while also surviving both Mega Metagross's Earthquake and Mega Alakazam's Focus Blast from full HP.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Flying-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Zapdos, bulky Thundurus, Skarmory, Landorus-T, and Gliscor can pivot on Excadrill almost endlessly. Defog Zapdos and Defog Skarmory can also nullify the progress Excadrill can make with Stealth Rock, while Gliscor and Skarmory are immune to Toxic, which makes them even more consistent at countering Excadrill. With Rock Slide or Swords Dance, Excadrill can overcome some of these walls, so be careful.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Walls</strong>: Aside from previously mentioned Pokemon such as Skarmory and Zapdos, Pokemon like Slowbro, Hippowdon, physically defensive Garchomp, Mega Scizor, Tangrowth, and Cofagrigus are particularly great at putting a hard stop to Excadrill. Hippowdon and Garchomp are especially useful, as they can renew Stealth Rock every time Excadrill is on the field. Cofagrigus is great at stopping Excadrill from doing what it wants, as it can both spinblock and burn it. Mega Scizor can use the free turn Excadrill gives it to use Defog or set up Swords Dance. Slowbro and Tangrowth can continuously check Excadrill thanks to Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Contact Damage</strong>: Rocky Helmet users such as Garchomp, Skarmory, Zapdos, and Ferrothorn are great at punishing Excadrill by switching into Iron Head and Rapid Spin, two of Excadrill's most commonly used moves. Over the long course of the battle, they can whittle down Excadrill and prevent it from spinning long-term.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Threats</strong>: Fast Pokemon such as Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, and offensive Garchomp can both outspeed and OHKO Excadrill. Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Dragonite, Nasty Plot Thundurus, and Swords Dance Gliscor can set up on Excadrill by virtue of their typing, ability, or natural bulk, and proceed to threaten the rest of the team.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Excadrill thrives on its longevity thanks to Leftovers and double resistance to Stealth Rock. In the same vein, removing Excadrill's Leftovers with Knock Off puts a limit on the amount of time it can spin.</p>",

      "Fast Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin is the main reason to use utility Excadrill, removing Stealth Rock for the team multiple times in a game. Earthquake and Iron Head are stable STAB options that make Excadrill hit decently hard. Toxic can be used for defensive walls that Excadrill struggles with, such as Zapdos, Cofagrigus, Slowbro, and Cresselia. On the other hand, Swords Dance combined with Mold Breaker makes Excadrill a fantastic stallbreaker. Stealth Rock is used for maximum utility; however, this makes Excadrill struggle to spin versus Cofagrigus, as it doesn't have Toxic or Swords Dance to slowly break it. Rock Slide and Toxic over Iron Head are potential options Excadrill can run for better matchups into Zapdos and Thundurus; however, it is not recommended, as Excadrill's main objective is checking Fairy-types like Clefable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers is used to prolong Excadrill's longevity as much as possible, allowing it to recover HP on every switch even with Stealth Rock on the field, thanks to Excadrill's unique typing. The EV spread maximizes Excadrill's defenses while maintaining maximum Speed. Maximum Speed with a Jolly nature is important to outspeed Adamant Mega Medicham, tank Garchomp, and Mild Kyurem-B, making Excadrill a versatile pivot. It also helps against opposing Excadrill. 32 HP EVs maximize Leftovers recovery while minimizing HP investment, as Excadrill's massive HP stat means that investing in its defenses yields better defensive calculations. The given physical bulk investment lets Excadrill take Choice Band Weavile's Knock Off from full HP. The rest of the EVs are put in Special Defense to minimize damage from Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Clefable. Alternatively, 32 HP / 60 Atk / 52 Def / 108 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used for more wallbreaking power while still surviving non-Life Orb Thundurus's Focus Blast from full HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used as a fast, defensive pivot against special attackers like Clefable, Magnezone, and Latios. Use these timely pivots to spin hazards away or get Stealth Rock up. With Toxic, Excadrill can be used to lure defensive targets like Zapdos and Cresselia to open up for the rest of the team, while Swords Dance allows Excadrill to be a surprise wallbreaker.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fast utility Excadrill thrives with fast-paced teammates such as Tornadus-T and Rotom-W that can alleviate Excadrill's weaknesses and complement its utility. Other options like Zapdos, Slowbro, Clefable, and Cresselia are excellent switch-ins to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks that Excadrill can struggle against. Zapdos in particular deserves a special mention, since with Excadrill around, it can afford to drop Defog and run Static. Pokemon that can switch into Water-type attacks, especially Scald, are also appreciated. Those include Volcanion, Serperior, Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and other previously mentioned Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Clefable, and Slowbro.</p>"
      },
      "Sand Rush": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake and Iron Head are stable STAB options that make Excadrill hit quite hard with maximum Attack investment. Rapid Spin allows Excadrill to fill another role of removing entry hazards, especially versus fast-paced offense teams that rely on their speed to deny Rapid Spin. Swords Dance can be used to make Excadrill an excellent wallbreaker that is almost impossible to revenge kill under sand. Rock Slide can be used to make Excadrill more of an immediate threat, especially to common switch-ins like Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Thundurus. Substitute can be used to help Excadrill spin against Cofagrigus while also aiding in dealing with difficult scenarios Sand Rush Excadrill often finds itself in. Finally, Stealth Rock, especially with Air Balloon, can be used to make Excadrill a lightning-fast utility Pokemon that is always guaranteed to get up Stealth Rock versus offense teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature is generally preferred, as Excadrill is already lightning-fast under sand, and the nature can make a huge difference in its damage output. However, a Jolly nature can still be used for purposes outside of sand or to outspeed +2 Jolly Dragonite, +2 Jolly Mega Gyarados, and +2 Modest Volcarona under sand. Alternatively, a spread of 176 Atk / 80 SpD / 252 Spe with an Adamant nature preserves much of Excadrill's wallbreaking power but makes it a better pivot into Clefable, maximizing its chances to live 2 Flamethrowers after Stealth Rock damage. Thanks to Excadrill's unique typing giving it double resistance to Stealth Rock, leftovers is the preferred item to gain back HP with every switch provided Spikes are not up. Alternatively, Air Balloon allows Excadrill to pivot into Ground-types such as Hippowdon and opposing Excadrill, enabling it to get a timely Rapid Spin or forcing them out.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used as an offensive threat that punches holes in enemy defenses or a late-game cleaner that can sweep the opposing team once it has been weakened enough. Alternatively, and especially with an Air Balloon, it can be used as a fast utility Pokemon that is guaranteed to set Stealth Rock, use Rapid Spin, or both.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>An automatic sand setter, such as Tyranitar or Hippowdon, is a must with this set. Other teammates that can mitigate Excadrill's weakness to Rotom-W, such as Amoonguss and Clefable, are also greatly appreciated. Pokemon that can grab momentum with Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Zapdos, allow Excadrill to come in multiple times during the game, which can come in very handy in certain matchups.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin is the main selling point of utility Excadrill. Being able to remove entry hazards multiple times in a game and against common Stealth Rock setters like Clefable is very helpful for the team. Earthquake and Iron Head are stable STAB options that make Excadrill hit decently hard. Toxic, alongside Excadrill's bulk, can be a great tool to alleviate Excadrill's passivity and cripple common switch-ins such as Zapdos, Cresselia, and Slowbro. Although it makes Excadrill weak to Cofagrigus, Stealth Rock is a valid option, as this Excadrill set is very reliable at getting them up. With the given HP investment, Excadrill can make 101 HP Substitutes, allowing it to put more pressure on Chansey and Night Shade Cofagrigus. Swords Dance can still be used, but the lack of Speed makes it far less effective than fast utility variants.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>40 Speed EVs let Excadrill outspeed Adamant Choice Band Tyranitar, defensive Landorus-T, and most Rotom-W. 176 HP Evs are used to allow Excadrill 405 HP, which allows it to pivot into Chansey better. Maximum Special Defense with a Careful nature allows Excadrill to live very strong special hits such as Mega Alakazam's Focus Blast. 28 Def EVs allow Excadrill to live Mega Metagross's Earthquake. The rest of the EVs is put into Atk, allowing Excadrill to hit slightly harder. Alternatively, a spread of 120 HP / 20 Def / 252 SpD / 112 Spe can be used for more Speed at the cost of bulk. This enables Excadrill to stand a better chance versus Bisharp, faster Rotom-W, and Modest Volcanion. Leftovers is the preferred item of choice as it synergizes well with Excadrill's typing and bulk, minimizing the damage it takes from Stealth Rock and weak moves such as Clefable's Moonblast throughout the game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used a defensive pivot into special attackers like Mega Diancie, Zapdos, and Mega Alakazam. Be sure to make use of these pivots to get Stealth Rock off the field or set up your own. Toxic can be used to cripple Pokemon trying to take advantage of Excadrill's low damage output, such as Calm Mind Slowbro or Nasty Plot Thundurus. Substitute can be used to apply more pressure on Chansey and Cofagrigus teams. Be sure to preserve Leftovers on Excadrill to maintain its longevity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially defensive Excadrill thrives on slower-paced teams like balance, bulky offense, and even semi-stall. Teams that use Spikes setters like Skarmory and Ferrothorn can benefit greatly from Excadrill's ability to keep entry hazards off while also complementing its defenses. Bulky offense teams, especially those that include Cresselia, Volcanion, or Zapdos, can also appreciate Excadrill's consistent ability to pivot on special threats like Mega Gardevoir and Clefable and keep hazards off.</p>"
      },
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is an important STAB move that KOs Bisharp and opposing Excadrill, while Iron Head hits Pokemon such as Dragonite and Weavile harder. Rapid Spin is crucial, as it allows Excadrill to be used as the team's main hazard removal. Stealth Rock gives Excadrill further utility to the team, fulfilling two roles in one slot. Toxic is a great way to punish Pokemon attempting to take advantage of Excadrill's low damage output, such as Landorus-T and Hippowdon. Substitute is also worth a mention on this set in particular, as it can aid in making physically defensive Excadrill an even better Bisharp check.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread allows Excadrill to maximize its physical defense. The special bulk investment allows Excadrill to take Rotom-W's Hydro Pump from full HP and minimize the chance of getting KOed after Stealth Rock chip. 128 Speed EVs are enough to outspeed Adamant Bisharp and Jolly Tyranitar. 32 HP EVs maximize Leftovers recovery. Alternatively, a spread of 32 HP / 252 Def / 20 SpD / 204 Spe can be used to outspeed Jolly Bisharp at the cost of getting OHKO'ed by Rotom-W's Hydro Pump.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used as a defensive pivot against physical attackers like Weavile, Bisharp, opposing Excadril, and Choice Band Tyranitar. It is important to take advantage of these opportunities to remove Stealth Rock from the field or set up your own. Toxic is great at poisoning bulky Ground-type Pokemon that often switch into Excadrill such as tank Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Landorus-T. Substitute can be used for extra insurance versus Bisharp, avoiding Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Physically defensive Excadrill thrives on bulky offense teams that struggle against strong physical attackers such as Weavile and Bisharp. This set is particularly great on Cresselia teams that usually struggle versus Weavile, Bisharp, and opposing Excadrill, all of which Excadrill can help with or lure in.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake allows Excadrill to be a great late-game cleaner once Flying-types have been eliminated. With Mold Breaker, it can hit Levitate Pokemon such as Rotom-W. Iron Head, combined with Excadrill's Speed, is another great tool for late-game cleaning, especially when some lucky flinches are needed. Rapid Spin, especially with Choice Scarf, can be used to remove entry hazards once or twice per game. Rock Slide can be used to revenge kill fast Flying-types such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Charizard Y, and Thundurus. Alternatively, Toxic or Stealth Rock can be used for more utility.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread with a Jolly nature maximizes Excadrill's Speed to outspeed fast threats as Mega Alakazam and setup Pokemon such as Jolly Gyarados, Jolly Dragonite, and Modest Volcarona at +1.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used as a late-game sweeper and a revenge killer. Once any opposing Flying-types have fainted, Excadrill can spam Earthquake freely, especially when bulky threats such as Slowbro are also KOed or weakened. Rapid Spin is only supposed to be used once or twice per game, as it is a huge momentum killer.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can lure or reliably eliminate Flying-types and physically defensive walls make the best of teammates. Pokemon such as Mega Metagross, Mega Diancie, and Mega Pinsir are some examples that can do both.</p>"

With Focus Sash, it is often guaranteed to both set up and remove Stealth Rock. Rock Tomb is used to allow Excadrill to guarantee Stealth Rock is set the next turn versus faster threats while also threatening Thundurus. Earthquake is Excadrill's main way of dishing out damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature with maximum Speed is preferred to increase the chances of Excadrill setting up Stealth Rock as much as possible. Maximum Attack is used to threaten common Rapid Spin and Defog users such as Excadrill and Zapdos. Mold Breaker allows it to set up Stealth Rocks against Mega Diancie and lower the Speed of Serperior with Rock Tomb. Other options include Chople Berry to get past Mega Lopunny.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used as a lead in the majority of matchups. Avoid leading with Excadrill versus fast Fake Out users such as Mega Lopunny and Jolly Mega Medicham, as they can prevent Excadrill from doing anything one-on-one. Be sure to use Rock Tomb versus faster threats, especially if Focus Sash is still intact.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fast Pokemon with immediately threatening power or a one-turn setup are the preferred teammates for this Excadrill set, as they can maintain the pressure to prevent the opposing team from removing Stealth Rock. Examples of such are Choice Band Weavile, Life Orb or Nasty Plot Thundurus, Quiver Dance Volcarona, and Tail Glow Manaphy. Additionally, at least one teammate that can pivot into Mega Lopunny, such as Rocky Helmet Thundurus or Choice Scarf Latias, is highly recommended.</p>"

Conkeldurr is vulnerable to Psychic-, Fairy-, and Flying-types, which gives it a tough standing due to the high prevalence of these threats. In addition to this, Conkeldurr is outclassed by other Fighting-types like Mega Medicham, Keldeo, and Terrakion. Despite Conkeldurr struggling to find its place due to its bulk, with the right moveset and item, it can become a powerful threat to many teams. An advantage Conkeldurr has is his ability Guts, which allows it to benefit from status conditions and switch into them.</p>",

Lastly, Mach Punch is a strong priority move that can pressure faster foes like Tyranitar, Hydreigon, Excadrill, and Heatran while picking off weakened threats.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature guarantee Conkeldurr’s maximum damage output, making it as threatening as possible. The 136 Speed EVs allow Conkeldurr to be faster than Clefable and Hippowdon. The rest of the EVs are invested in HP, giving Conkeldurr as much bulk as possible. Flame Orb is used to activate Guts, which not only increases its damage but also makes it immune to other status moves. An alternative EV spread of 48 HP / 252 Atk / 208 Spe makes Conkeldurr faster than Skarmory.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Conkeldurr should be used mainly as a wallbreaker, ideally coming in on Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Bisharp; it can then revenge kill them or threaten them out, delivering powerful hits on their teammates. Another option is to bring Conkeldurr in on moves that can afflict status, like Will-O-Wisp, Lava Plume, and Scald. Using Knock Off early in the game can be helpful to beat threats later by removing key items such as Leftovers, Rocky Helmet, and Choice items.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Conkeldurr fits well on bulky offense teams and can have a place on balanced teams as well. It appreciates teammates that can deal with bulky Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Rocky Helmet Garchomp as well as Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Talonflame. On less aggressive teams, Conkeldurr can also benefit from Wish support from Pokemon like Jirachi, Clefable, and Chansey that can also switch into opposing Clefable or Psychic-types like Mega Alakazam and Latios.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Drain Punch is Conkeldurr's primary STAB move, giving it longevity. Knock Off supports the team by removing items like Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from foes like Clefable, Zapdos, and Landorus-T. Additionally, it hits Psychic- and Ghost-types that resist Conkeldurr’s other attacks. Mach Punch pressures faster foes like Tyranitar, Hydreigon, Excadrill, and Heatran while picking off weakened threats. If Conkeldurr is statused, Facade is an option to deal a lot of damage, especially to targets that resist its STAB attacks including Clefable, Amoonguss, and Tornadus-T. Stone Edge can also be run instead to hit Flying-types like Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, and Zapdos as well as Volcarona.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature give Conkeldurr a high damage output, while the HP investment makes it bulky enough to absorb many special attacks and gives it better sustainability against physical moves like Bisharp's Knock Off or Iron Head, Tyranitar's Stone Edge, and Excadrill's Earthquake. Assault Vest supports Conkeldurr's mediocre Special Defense. Guts allows Conkeldurr to absorb status-inflicting moves. Another option is using Iron Fist instead of Guts and Ice Punch and Poison Jab over Facade and Knock Off. Since Iron Fist boosts its main attack, Drain Punch, as well as other potential coverage moves, Conkeldurr can carve itself a niche as a powerful wallbreaker and pseudo-tank. The downside of this set is that it becomes vulnerable to burns.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Assault Vest Conkeldurr is supposed to absorb special attacks or status moves. With Drain Punch, Conkeldurr can stay relatively healthy, allowing it to check certain threats multiple times. Due to its typing, Conkeldurr shouldn't switch into Flying- or Psychic-type moves. However, if Conkeldurr is already on the field, it has the chance to KO foes that would otherwise KO it but can’t due to the Assault Vest, like Tornadus-T and Mega Alakazam. Assault Vest Conkeldurr is good against many offensive teams, since it can switch into Volcarona and Bisharp, threatening to OHKO them. Having access to Knock Off enables Conkeldurr to provide support for the team by removing items such as Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from foes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Conkeldurr fits well on bulky offense teams, where it can absorb status moves while keeping the pressure up and checking threats like Volcarona or Bisharp. Due to its weakness to Flying- and Psychic-type Pokemon, having Bisharp or Tyranitar as a teammate is beneficial. Physically offensive Pokemon that provoke Will-O-Wisp synergize well with Assault Vest Conkeldurr, either giving Conkeldurr the burn it needs for its Guts to be activated or forcing the opponent to be careful with the usage of such moves, giving Conkeldurr’s teammates the chance to stay in on opponents that they are not supposed to otherwise.</p>"

  "Seismitoad": {
    "overview": "<p>Seismitoad's solid typing and ability allow it to check and counter many threats in OU, including Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, and Mega Metagross lacking Grass Knot, or to function as a powerful sweeper under rain. Seismitoad has a niche in rain, only shared with Mega Swampert, as a sweeper that cannot be crippled by Thunder Wave. However, Seismitoad has a 4x weakness to Grass-type moves which can easily be exploited by Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn, and very little with which to fight back. It also has a lack of reliable recovery, which means it has limited longevity and an over-reliance on Leftovers or switching into Water-type moves. Seismitoad also faces very strong competition from Gastrodon as a bulky Water-type, but Seismitoad has access to Knock Off and Stealth Rock, in addition to higher Speed and better physical bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rain Dance lets Seismitoad set up rain for itself and sweep, but lasts only 5 turns because Seismitoad needs Life Orb, and also means that Seismitoad loses out on coverage. A specially defensive spread can be run to check special attackers such as Gengar and Alakazam, but the physically defensive set takes on many more Pokemon. Running 56 Attack EVs and a Relaxed nature on the defensive set allows Seismitoad to OHKO Mega Diancie 75% of the time with Earthquake and 2HKO Mega Metagross. However, the loss of bulk is quite noticeable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types resist Seismitoad's STAB moves and can threaten it with 4x effective STAB moves. Mega Venusaur, Serperior, Celebi, and Amoonguss can all easily switch into defensive Seismitoad and force it out, although Celebi and Serperior cannot safely switch into offensive Seismitoad as they risk taking a Sludge Wave.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types can also take Seismitoad's attacks quite easily and stall it out with poison or set up on it. Examples include Slowbro, Keldeo, and Starmie.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Dragon-types</strong>: Bulky Dragon-types, such as Latias, Latios, and Goodra, have no trouble taking Seismitoad's attacks. However, Latias and Latios should be wary of Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Due to Seismitoad's lack of recovery, offensive Pokemon such as Azumarill, Mega Gallade, and Gengar can take Seismitoad out by consistently putting offensive pressure on it. However, Azumarill and Mega Gallade are crippled by the burns Scald can inflict.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: While an immunity to paralysis is very handy for Seismitoad, it is very susceptible to poison and burn because they will easily wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Chansey can take any hit from the offensive set and stall Seismitoad out. However, it is 2HKOed if its Eviolite has been removed. Mega Venusaur also can take Seismitoad's attacks, then KO it with Giga Drain. Latias can easily take Seismitoad's attacks, but must be wary of Knock Off.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Seismitoad can find plenty of opportunities to set Stealth Rock up, as it can easily come in on Pokemon such as Electric-types that lack Grass coverage or Pokemon locked into weak or Water-type moves. Scald's chance to burn allows Seismitoad to cripple a lot of Pokemon that try to switch in, such as Breloom. Despite having a Bold nature, Earthquake is the preferred Ground-type STAB move on Seismitoad, as it prevents Seismitoad becoming setup bait for specially defensive Pokemon such as Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo. Earthquake also does solid damage to Fire- and Steel-types such as Mega Charizard X, Heatran, and Mega Metagross. Knock Off can cripple Pokemon such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, and Rotom-W by removing their items. Toxic can severely shorten the longevity of setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Altaria lacking Heal Bell or Refresh, and Mega Gyarados, while also wearing down Grass-type switch-ins outside of Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximizing Seismitoad's HP and Defense allows it to handle many threats in OU such as Victini, Mega Metagross lacking Grass Knot, and Tyranitar. 12 Speed EVs are used to ensure Seismitoad outspeeds Mega Scizor lacking Speed investment. Water Absorb is the best ability to use on Seismitoad, as it completely deters Pokemon such as Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Slowbro from spamming Water-type moves. Leftovers provides valuable recovery for Seismitoad, as it lacks any outside of Leftovers and Water Absorb.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Stealth Rock should be used as soon as possible to punish switches, but only when Seismitoad is in a safe position. Seismitoad shouldn't be switched in repeatedly, as it has a lack of recovery and is easily worn down by entry hazards and powerful attacks. Scald is Seismitoad's most spammable move and should be used to weaken or cripple Pokemon with burn while Knock Off should be used against Pokemon that are item reliant, such as Chansey and Gliscor. Seismitoad can be used to pivot and gain momentum against threats such as Victini locked into Bolt Strike or Landorus-T locked into Stone Edge.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, Scizor, and Mega Venusaur make for good partners, as they can handle the Grass-types that force Seismitoad out, while Seismitoad handles Rotom-W for Talonflame and Scizor. Fairy-types appreciate support from Seismitoad, as it can handle Steel-types such as Jirachi and Heatran. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Rotom-W, Scizor, and Landorus-T can gain momentum for Seismitoad, allowing it to come in more easily and set up Stealth Rock. Scizor handles the Fairy-types that can give Seismitoad trouble such as Clefable and Mega Altaria, while Seismitoad takes on Heatran for Scizor. Steel-types such as Bisharp, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory are good partners because they have decent defensive synergy with Seismitoad. Bisharp punishes the use of Defog with Defiant, while Skarmory and Ferrothorn can set up Spikes. Jirachi can heal Seismitoad with Wish and deal with the Grass-types that beat Seismitoad, such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. Seismitoad is a very useful Pokemon on sand teams as it can provide Stealth Rock and handle Rotom-W, which is a big problem for Sand Rush Excadrill.</p>"
      },
      "Rain Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Seismitoad's main attacking move and is boosted even further when rain is up. Earth Power is weaker but more reliable. Sludge Wave allows Seismitoad to deal damage to Grass-types that resist its STAB combination. Focus Blast allows Seismitoad to break past Ferrothorn, which resists its Water, Ground, and Poison coverage, though it has unreliable accuracy. Knock Off can be used over Focus Blast to deal a lot of damage to Latios and Latias, as they can handle Hydro Pump and Sludge Wave and have an immunity to Earth Power. Knock Off also cripples Chansey by removing its Eviolite and gives Seismitoad a good chance to 2HKO it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Seismitoad's offensive capabilities while the Speed investment allows it to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T and the remaining EVs are dumped into HP. Swift Swim is the only reason to use offensive Seismitoad, as it allows Seismitoad to become a very threatening sweeper in rain. Life Orb should be run to maximize damage output, as Seismitoad has a fairly low Special Attack stat. A Modest nature maximizes Seismitoad's Special Attack, but, a Rash nature should be run with Knock Off to allow Seismitoad to 2HKO Latios and Latias.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Offensive Seismitoad should only be used on rain teams, as rain support makes Hydro Pump very powerful while allowing Seismitoad to outspeed the entire unboosted tier. Seismitoad acts as a late-game cleaner rather than a wallbreaker, and so should be used once specially defensive Pokemon have been weakened. Try to only use Seismitoad once rain is set up as it is very slow without the Swift Swim boost and can be easily beaten by faster threats. To get Seismitoad in safely, send it in on Fire- and Electric-type Pokemon that are Choice-locked or do not have any Grass-type coverage as it can take their moves easily and OHKO or force them out next turn. Aim to have entry hazards set before attempting to sweep with Seismitoad to break Focus Sashes and Sturdy and make it easier to net OHKOs. Seismitoad also appreciates VoltTurn support as it minimizes the damage it takes from coming in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Politoed is the best teammate for Seismitoad, as it can set up rain with Drizzle, which is absolutely necessary for Seismitoad to sweep. Manual rain setters such as Thundurus and Klefki are also great partners, while Klefki can put pressure on teams with Spikes. Entry Hazard support from Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Celebi are very useful for Seismitoad, as it helps it net OHKOs and 2HKOs more easily. All three work well in rain, as rain halves the damage they take from Fire-type moves. Seismitoad works well with other rain sweepers such as Kabutops and Mega Swampert as they can handle specially defensive Pokemon that trouble Seismitoad, while Seismitoad can break physically defensive Pokemon that trouble Mega Swampert and Kabutops. Pokemon that can switch into Grass-type moves, such as Tornadus-T and Thundurus, are very useful, as bulky Grass-types can beat Seismitoad under rain. Bulky Water-types can halt Seismitoad's sweep, so Electric-types such as Thundurus and Magnezone are also good teammates. Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr and Keldeo can threaten Chansey and Blissey, both of which are problems for Seismitoad. Conkeldurr can restore HP against them with Drain Punch, while Keldeo can take advantage of the rain.</p>"

It can set entry hazards as a suicide lead or sweep with Swords Dance-boosted attacks. It threatens offense and balance teams alike, functioning as a fast hazard setter or an underrated wincon, given the right support. Scolipede's typing and decent Attack let it pressure common threats like Clefable and Mega Venusaur, while Speed Boost allows it to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame after just one turn. However, it's held back by a poor defensive typing, making it vulnerable to priority moves and common typings like Flying, Psychic, and Fire.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used over Toxic Spikes on the entry hazard set to have a more direct approach and to hit Flying-types like Zapdos and Tornadus-T. Rock Slide can be used on the sweeper set as well to hit the aforementioned Flying-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Flying-types:</strong> Zapdos, Skarmory, and Landorus-T can wall most of Scolipede's attacks and threaten it back. Defog Zapdos also counters the entry hazard lead set.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types with Priority:</strong> Talonflame, Thunder Wave Thundurus, Quick Attack Mega Pinsir, and Extreme Speed Dragonite can pick off weakened Scolipede.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Bug-types:</strong> Mega Scizor and Mega Heracross can both wall the Swords Dance set and take advantage of the entry hazard lead set.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types:</strong> Cofagrigus, Jellicent, and Gengar resist both of Scolipede's STAB moves and can generally survive any hit from Scolipede. However, Gengar faints to +2 Aqua Tail.</p> <p><strong>Quagsire:</strong> Quagsire walls the Swords Dance set, as it is not weak to any of Scolipede's moves and is never 2HKOed.</p>",

      "Entry Hazard Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes and Toxic Spikes are the core of this set, enabling Scolipede to function as an efficient entry hazard lead that can pressure teams from turn one. Endeavor synergizes well with Speed Boost, allowing Scolipede to weaken bulky threats after taking a hit. Superpower lets it hit Steel-types like Heatran and Excadrill, which are immune to Toxic Spikes and Poison Jab. Alternatively, Poison Jab provides a more consistent STAB option, hitting Fairy-types like Clefable, Azumarill, and Mega Altaria.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The maximized Speed allows unboosted Scolipede to outpace Mega Metagross, Latios, and Thundurus, giving it extra opportunities to set up entry hazards or make use of Endeavor. 48 Attack EVs let Superpower put Excadrill in Rocky Helmet range, which is important to protect the hazards. Rocky Helmet further punishes physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, and Mega Gyarados. The rest of the EVs are put into bulk to allow Scolipede to stay on the field as long as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lead with Scolipede against slower or passive Pokemon to stack multiple layers of entry hazards early. Be careful of Taunt leads like Aerodactyl and Azelf. Use Endeavor after taking damage to cripple walls or tanks and put them in range of a teammate's attack. Endeavor can also be used when anticipating a big hit from a faster-paced foe before taking advantage of Speed Boost the following turn. Since often times the amount of hazards that can realisticly be used is limited it is important to assess weather Spikes or Toxic Spikes will have the most impact. Be cautious against Mega Diancie, which counters this set.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Scolipede fits best on offensive teams. The entry hazard stacking helps teams break down defensive cores. With its attacking options and the support of Rocky Helmet, Scolipede can pressure spinners like Excadrill, allowing strong hitters like Talonflame, Bisharp, and Weavile to capitalize on the provided chip damage. Ghost-types like Gengar, Jellicent, and Cofagrigus can block Rapid Spin, helping to preserve Scolipede's hazards. Bisharp can benefit from opposing Defog or deter it with the threat of its Defiant-boosted Attack alone. Excadrill makes for a good partner, threatening Mega Diancie and providing Stealth Rock. Furthermore, partners that handle Flying-types, such as Tyranitar, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T, are all solid options, and the latter two are especially useful for being able to keep up the momentum, not allowing the opponent to remove hazards.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance lets Scolipede function as a late-game cleaner, allowing it to set up and sweep. Megahorn is a strong STAB move that hits bulky switch-ins, such as Ferrothorn, Mega Metagross, and Mega Venusaur. Poison Jab is a consistent STAB option that hits Fairy- and Flying-types that resist Megahorn, such as Clefable, Tornadus-T, and Mega Altaria. Earthquake hits Fire-types like Heatran and Volcanion hard while providing strong neutral coverage that bypasses contact. On the other hand, Aqua Tail can hit Landorus-T and Gliscor, which otherwise wall Scolipede, while still hitting bulky Fire-types. Protect guarantees a Speed Boost by preventing Scolipede from taking damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>172 Speed EVs allow Scolipede to outspeed Excadrill at +0, Mega Alakazam at +1, and Sand Rush Excadrill at +2. Maximum Attack investment optimizes Scolipede's potential as a late-game sweeper. The rest of the EVs are thrown into bulk while keeping an odd HP number to minimize Stealth Rock damage. This allows Scolipede to better take priority attacks and weak coverage moves, as well as find easier opportunities to set up Swords Dance. Black Sludge gives it passive recovery, which helps it stay on the field longer and stack multiple boosts from Speed Boost and Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Scolipede should be brought in safely and given the opportunity to set up Swords Dance. It can be used early to weaken key defensive targets or used later for an attempt to clean late-game. Before attempting to sweep, some key defensive checks like Skarmory, Garchomp, Landorus-T, (AC) and Zapdos should be KOed or severely weakened. Strong priority users like Talonflame and Dragonite should ideally be eliminated before attempting a sweep. Although Cofagrigus walls this set, Scolipede can still be useful against it by absorbing its Toxic Spikes throughout the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Scolipede fits best on offensive teams, where other Pokemon open up defensive cores. Bisharp can remove Rocky Helmet with Knock Off and weaken certain foes like Zapdos and Skarmory. Wallbreakers like Kyurem-B, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar can soften up physical walls that otherwise tank Scolipede's attacks, such as Cofagrigus and Zapdos. Dual screens can allow Scolipede easier setup opportunities; therefore, Serperior and Latias can make good teammates. Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar can remove troublesome Ghost-types like Cofagrigus.</p>"

  "Cofagrigus": {
    "overview": "<p>Cofagrigus's Ghost typing, great natural bulk, and diverse movepool makes it the most versatile Toxic Spikes user in ORAS OU. With access to Toxic Spikes and Will-O-Wisp, Cofagrigus is able to cripple offense and balance teams while also doubling as a spinblocker. Cofagrigus boasts Mummy, which is able to shut down wallbreakers like Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Altaria, as well as denying Regenerator against dominant pivots like Tornadus-T. In addition, Cofagrigus's low Speed tier and Nasty Plot allow it to utilize its good offensive typing on Trick Room teams. However, its low Special Attack and susceptibility to Dark-types often make this option inferior to the defensive Toxic Spikes set. Although Cofagrigus possesses a wide array of utility options, it is held back by a lack of reliable recovery and vulnerability to residual damage from entry hazards and status conditions. As a result, it faces competition from walls with better longevity such as Slowbro and Hippowdon, which have access to Slack Off, and other spinblockers like Jellicent, which has access to Recover.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cofagrigus has a wide array of options that can be used to disrupt many Pokemon; however, many of them are situational and often fall short of the defensive Toxic Spikes set. Skill Swap may be used on Pokemon like Clefable, forcing it to take residual damage from Will-O-Wisp or Toxic Spikes while also preventing Cofagrigus from taking residual damage. It may also be used on Pokemon reliant on their abilities to heal, such as Gliscor, which takes heavy damage from its Toxic Orb following a Skill Swap. Snatch can be used to steal boosting moves from Pokemon Calm Mind Clefable, as well as stealing recovery moves like Soft-Boiled, Roost, and Slack Off. Memento is a possible option to use on Trick Room teams or as a suicide lead, as it pairs well with Cofagrigus's ability to cripple attackers with status and turn them into setup fodder. Haze may be used to deny setup to sweepers, which can be devastating especially if they are put on a timer by Toxic Spikes or Will-O-Wisp. Knock Off may be used to let Cofagrigus lure in specially bulky Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Chansey, and Clefable to remove their items.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Pokemon like Tyranitar, Weavile, and Bisharp all take minimal damage from Cofagrigus's STAB attacks and can force it out with Knock Off. However, these Pokemon do not appreciate switching into Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Status-immune Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Altaria, Heatran, Clefable, Gliscor, Rest Suicune, Chansey, and Refresh Mega Latias are all either immune to residual damage from status or can heal such damage off. Mega Charizard X is unaffected by Will-O-Wisp and doesn't take Toxic Spikes before Mega Evolving, so it can take advantage of Cofagrigus for setup. In addition, these Pokemon have enough bulk to prevent being 2HKOed by boosted Hex and may consequently set up in front of Cofagrigus.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Although Cofagrigus's physical bulk is very high, its special bulk is not, often resulting in it being overpowered by special wallbreakers like Keldeo, Manaphy, Thundurus, and Volcarona.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Due to Cofagrigus's reliability on status moves to whittle down teams, it can often be shut down by most Taunt users due to its low Speed. Pokemon like Serperior are easily able to use Taunt to prevent Toxic Spikes and Will-O-Wisp usage versus offensive teams.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Cofagrigus's lack of adequate recovery options makes it susceptible to being worn down by entry hazards and status such as burn and poison. This can force Cofagrigus into a state of passivity, relying on Pain Split to desperately regain HP.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Cofagrigus can use Toxic Spikes to quickly whittle down teams, putting powerful wallbreakers like Keldeo, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny on a timer and limiting their longevity. Will-O-Wisp is used to cripple Pokemon unaffected by Toxic Spikes such as Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T. Pain Split utilizes Cofagrigus's low HP stat to chip down opponents and heal itself, but is an unreliable source of recovery. Hex can be used to severely chip statused foes and is an excellent way to deter hazard removal from the likes of Excadrill and Starmie. It can also be used in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp to deny setup opportunities from Pokemon like Mega Latias, Mega Altaria, and Mega Pinsir. Night Shade is useful for hitting specially bulky Pokemon like Assault Vest Tornadus-T harder as well as chipping away at Ghost-resistant Pokemon like Tyranitar. Knock Off can be used to punish the likes of Chansey, Clefable, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T that Cofagrigus can usually do little against. Shadow Ball is a more consistent option for hitting unstatused targets, notably 2HKOing Latios.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Cofagrigus's EV spread aims to maximize its physical bulk, with 8 EVS in Special Defense for a slight boost to its special bulk. Leftovers is used to enhance Cofagrigus's longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is important to analyze the opponent's team prior to battle to see if Toxic Spikes is useful and to set it up as soon as possible if that is the case. Cofagrigus can take advantage of switching into Pokemon like Excadrill to spinblock and Pokemon like Mega Medicham, Mega Metagross, and Mega Scizor to remove their abilities and cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. Once the opposing team is mostly crippled, Cofagrigus can start spamming Hex to severely chip them down, and Pain Split whenever necessary to heal off damage.</p> <p>Due to Cofagrigus's lack of reliable recovery, it is best to avoid being statused or having its Leftovers removed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky sweepers like Calm Mind Suicune, Calm Mind Mega Latias, and SubRoost Kyurem appreciate Cofagrigus's ability to switch into Pokemon that check them like Mega Metagross and Mega Medicham. They also benefit from Cofagrigus's ability to whittle down offensive teams with Toxic Spikes and Will-O-Wisp. Pursuit users like Tyranitar and Weavile punish attempts at entry hazard removal by trapping Defoggers such as Latios and Latias. Spike setters appreciate Cofagrigus's ability to prevent Rapid Spin. Ferrothorn is a notable partner, as it can set Spikes and appreciates Cofagrigus switching into Fighting-type moves. Ferrothorn can also aid Cofagrigus's recovery by using Leech Seed on incoming switch-ins like Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny, which enhances Cofagrigus's ability to switch into them long-term. Cofagrigus also appreciates partners that can resist Dark-type moves such as Knock Off like Tyranitar and Clefable; however, Mega Diancie can also be used as a more offensive option to check Dark-types. Since Cofagrigus is susceptible to residual damage from hazards, it benefits from spinners such as Excadrill and Starmie that can remove hazards.</p>"

      "Offensive Trick Room Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Under Trick Room, Cofagrigus is able to outspeed most of the ORAS metagame, barring Pokemon like Ferrothorn.

Shadow Ball allows Cofagrigus to spam a largely unresisted STAB move, OHKOing Psychic types like Mega Metagross, Latios, Latias, and Starmie at +2. Hidden Power Fighting is preferred over Will-O-Wisp to hit Dark-types like Tyranitar and Normal-types like Chansey that would otherwise wall Cofagrigus. It is also able to OHKO common Dark-types such as Weavile and Bisharp.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment and minimum Speed investment allow Cofagrigus to maximize its offensive power and be as quick as possible under Trick Room. The rest of the EVs are invested into HP and Defense, the added bulk allows it to survive a Life Orb Bisharp's Sucker Punch from full HP. Leftovers are also used to maximize Cofagrigus's longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is best to use Cofagrigus late-game to sweep after the opponent's team has been weakened. In order to prevent Cofagrigus's sweep from being cut short, it is optimal to use Nasty Plot prior to using Trick Room in order to have the maximum 4 turns to attack under Trick Room.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that lure in and severely chip or KO bulky Normal- and Dark-types pair well with Cofagrigus and help to enable its sweep. Latios can work to lure in Tyranitar to chip it with Draco Meteor into the range where it can be KOed by +2 Hidden Power Fighting. Tail Glow Manaphy and Life Orb Clefable can be used to lure in Chansey and severely chip it down with boosted Surf and Moonblast. Special attacking Knock Off users such as Serperior and Clefable may also be used lure Cofagrigus's switch-ins like Chansey and Tornadus-T, removing their items to reduce their bulk.</p>"

  "Reuniclus": {
    "overview": "<p>On paper, Reuniclus might seem somewhat mediocre, as it has a relatively poor defensive typing and is easily taken advantage of by some of the most threatening Pokemon in OU, including Bisharp, Weavile, Mega Gyarados, Mega Scizor, and Mega Heracross. It also faces enormous competition as a Calm Mind sweeper with Clefable, which boasts a superior defensive typing. Thankfully, Reuniclus possesses a couple of traits that give it a niche, the first of which is STAB Psyshock. Psyshock allows Reuniclus to do physical damage to targets and thus win Calm Mind wars and easily damage Chansey. Furthermore, Reuniclus's Psychic typing and bulk, while not spectacular, are respectable and allow it to safely check or counter and set up on many offensive Pokemon, including Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, Mega Medicham, Mega Venusaur, Choice Scarf Heatran, Mega Diancie, and Mega Manectric. Additionally, its Magic Guard ability helps it check offensive teams and defensive teams alike. It renders Reuniclus immune to Stealth Rock as well as Toxic and Leech Seed, which are commonly used as defensive teams' answers to setup sweepers. Reuniclus takes advantage of many defensive Pokemon in OU, such as defensive Mega Altaria, Mega Venusaur, Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Hippowdon, and thus helps out stall teams tremendously when playing against other stall teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Reuniclus could use a Life Orb, as with Magic Guard Reuniclus is immune to its recoil damage. This would boost the power of its moves substantially, but it typically isn't worth giving up the recovery it gains from Leftovers. Colbur Berry counteracts Reuniclus's proneness to Dark-types such as Tyranitar, Weavile, and Bisharp. An offensive Trick Room set could be used with Life Orb and three attacks, as Reuniclus is extremely powerful and fares well against offensive teams. However, offense has multiple means of stalling Trick Room turns and checking Reuniclus, and this set is practically useless against any team that is not offensive, so it is generally an inferior option. Heal Block prevents opposing Pokemon from healing. In particular, it prevents Slowbro from using Slack Off. Grass Knot is another option Reuniclus can utilise as it deals heavy damage to bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, while being a strong option against Mega Sableye because of its high base power. On top of this, it allows Reuniclus to break Quagsire, which walls it easily because of Unaware.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Strong Dark-types such as Bisharp, Tyranitar and Weavile all pressure Reuniclus heavily due to their strong Dark-type STAB moves. They can find switchin opportunities easily, especially if Reuniclus is in a situation where it needs to use Recover. Tyranitar and Weavile both often run Pursuit, which makes it difficult to preserve Reuniclus.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Bug-types such as Mega Scizor, Mega Heracross, and Mega Pinsir are capable of breaking through Reuniclus easily. Bulky Mega Scizor in particular can set up on Reuniclus freely as it takes little damage from Focus Blast and can pick off Reuniclus easily. Mega Heracross struggles to switch in, but it can OHKO Reuniclus with Pin Missile, while Mega Pinsir can net an opportunity to set up with Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Pokemon</strong>: Reuniclus is reliant on Calm Mind to do impressive damage. Unaware Pokemon, namely Quagsire and Clefable, ignore Calm Mind boosts and thus make great switch-ins to Reuniclus. However, neither can 2HKO Reuniclus without a boosting move of its own, so the battle tends to turn into a PP war.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Although Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn can't take on Reuniclus well, the aforementioned Mega Scizor and Jirachi can take it on very well, with Mega Scizor being able to set up on Reuniclus very easily, while Jirachi can paralyze Reuniclus with Body Slam and paraflinch it. Skarmory isn't a solid stop, especially if it comes down to a 1v1 situation, but it can phaze Reuniclus to prevent it from setting up early on in the game. Mega Metagross isn't the most reliable option but it can deal heavy damage to Reuniclus and force it to switch out to preserve Recover PP.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind allows Reuniclus to boost its Special Attack so that it can start doing insane damage and Special Defense so that it becomes impenetrable specially. Psyshock is a fairly powerful Psychic-type STAB move that lets Reuniclus counter Poison-types, such as Mega Venusaur. Psyshock also lets Reuniclus win Calm Mind wars and hit Chansey hard at +6, unlike Psychic. Focus Blast covers the Steel-types, such as Ferrothorn and Heatran, that Reuniclus easily sets up on. It also lets Reuniclus OHKO Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Weavile, while dealing heavy damage to Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Recover is necessary for continually recovering Reuniclus's HP while it is setting up and after it switches in on Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny. Signal Beam is another option over Focus Blast but lacks the power to OHKO the aforementioned Dark-types, but gives Reuniclus an option against opposing Psychic-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP EVs and 56 Special Defense EVs let Reuniclus almost always be able to switch into Naive Mega Diancie's Moonblast, take the next one, and then beat it. 68 Special Defense EVs could be used instead to guarantee avoiding the 2HKO, but Reuniclus would lose out on the ability to counter some physical threats, such as Life Orb Terrakion. The remaining EVs are put in Defense, and a Bold nature is used so that Reuniclus is as physically bulky as possible with the Special Defense investment. Leftovers is used for passive recovery, and Magic Guard is the ability of choice, as it makes Reuniclus immune to status damage and entry hazard damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Do not try to sweep with Reuniclus unless all of its checks and counters have been removed or you have a plan for luring them in and defeating them, such as using Focus Blast instead of Calm Mind or Psyshock to hit Bisharp on the switch. Once all of Reuniclus's checks and counters are gone, switch Reuniclus in, and alternate between Calm Mind and Recover until Reuniclus is powerful enough to win in the least amount of turns. Try to make sure you don't have to rely on Focus Blast to 2HKO a lot of Pokemon, as it misses frequently and has low PP. Reuniclus takes zero damage from Toxic, Stealth Rock, and Spikes, so don't be afraid to constantly switch it in and out. It laughs at many common defensive Pokemon, such as Ferrothorn and Heatran; Reuniclus should switch into them and start using Calm Mind. Reuniclus, thanks to its good bulk and fair typing, can also switch into common offensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Mega Manectric, Mega Diancie, and Mega Lopunny and proceed to use Calm Mind.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Reuniclus, despite having access to Focus Blast, can find itself being pressured very easily by Dark-types such as Bisharp, Weavile, and Tyranitar, so Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion make for good options as they can check the aforementioned Dark-types effectively. Keldeo in particular is a good teammate as it can switch into Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Jirachi that annoy Reuniclus. Magnezone is another good teammate for Reuniclus as it can trap Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Jirachi, making it easier for Reuniclus to find setup opportunities. Fire-types such as Heatran and Talonflame can also take on Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Jirachi while Reuniclus can set up on bulky Water- and Ground-types such as utility Starmie, Rotom-W, Hippowdon, and Landorus-T lacking Swords Dance.</p>"
      },
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is the main move on this set, allowing Reuniclus to remove items from the opposing Pokemon to enable its teammates. Recover provides Reuniclus with immediate healing, allowing it to consistently stave off threats like Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham. Psychic is a strong STAB move that can make progress on defensive Pokemon such as Clefable and Gliscor. Thunder Wave completes the moveset, providing Reuniclus additional utility in spreading paralysis to cripple offensive Pokemon such as Mega Metagross, Kyurem-B, and Serperior.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum physical bulk lets Reuniclus fulfill its role in checking physical attackers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Metagross. Rocky Helmet enables Reuniclus to spread chip damage to wear down the aformentioned threats. Magic Guard lets Reuniclus act as a status absorber due to its immunity to passive damage from burn and poison. It also allows Reuniclus to be unfazed by entry hazards, thus improving its ability as a defensive check.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Reuniclus should be used to switch into physical attackers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Metagross, since it can spread chip damage by taking their contact attacks. Reuniclus should avoid facing off against Dark-types like Weavile, Tyranitar, and Bisharp, since they can deal heavy damage with their Dark-type moves, even threatening an OHKO.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Reuniclus fits best on balance and bulky teams looking for a Mega Medicham answer due to their poor matchup against it. Teammates such as Chansey greatly appreciate Reuniclus's ability to deal with the Fighting-types that otherwise threaten it. Entry hazard setters such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn make for good teammates for Reuniclus, since they benefit from Reuniclus's ability to remove Leftovers with Knock Off, thus increasing the impact of Spikes. They also synergize with Reuniclus in that their hazards help to chip down Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar and Weavile that greatly threaten Reuniclus. Pokemon that resist Dark-type attacks such as Mega Lopunny and Clefable also make for fantastic teammates, since they cover Reuniclus's one major weakness to Dark while also taking advantage of Dark-types to either wallbreak or set up and sweep. These Pokemon also appreciate Reuniclus wearing down their checks with Knock Off and Rocky Helmet chip damage.</p>"

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<p>Amoonguss is a solid pivot in the OU metagame with a defensive typing that allows it to check threats such as Keldeo, Azumarill, Mega Diancie, and Breloom. It possesses an excellent ability in Regenerator, which allows it to heal by switching out rather than using a turn for Synthesis. One of Amoonguss's best traits is that it learns Spore, which is an excellent move to cripple a member of the opposing team with. While Amoonguss is very solid, it has competition as a bulky Grass-type from Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth, which all have more offensive presence. Amoonguss is also extremely slow, and after Spore has been used it can be rather passive and easy to switch into.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Synthesis is an option for recovery, but generally Regenerator is the only healing necessary and Synthesis makes Amoonguss more passive. Toxic can be used to better wear down some switch-ins, but many of them are better targeted by other moves than Toxic. Hidden Power Ice can be used to better wear down some Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Latios, Mega Alakazam, Mega Metagross, and Mega Medicham are all capable of OHKOing Amoonguss after Stealth Rock damage and don't particularly mind anything in return except Spore. Mega Gardevoir can tank a Sludge Bomb and 2HKO Amoonguss with Psyshock. Reuniclus can lose its boosts to Clear Smog but still threatens Amoonguss with its super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Tornadus-T, Talonflame, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Pinsir are all very threatening to Amoonguss. Togekiss can also threaten Amoonguss but has to rely on making it flinch. Most of these Pokemon are vulnerable to switching into Stun Spore bar Togekiss, and poison from Sludge Bomb can limit their effectiveness as well, so they should be switched in with caution.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran can't really be touched by Amoonguss outside of status moves. Both Mega Charizard formes, Volcarona, and Victini are also capable of OHKOing Amoonguss pretty easily and can take its attacking moves comfortably.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Mega Venusaur is bulkier and stronger than Amoonguss, while also being immune to Spore. It can spam Hidden Power Fire or Sludge Bomb to force Amoonguss out.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Gliscor isn't susceptible to status moves and takes very little damage from Amoonguss's attacks, while Mew can simply use Taunt to annoy Amoonguss to no end.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Kyurem-B cleanly OHKOes Amoonguss with Ice Beam and cares very little about its attacking moves. Weavile and Mamoswine can also do a ton of damage but are frailer and can't always take out Amoonguss in one hit.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spore is a must-have on Amoonguss to cripple one Pokemon on the opposing team, and Giga Drain allows Amoonguss to stay somewhat healthy, while threatening Water-types it naturally checks. Clear Smog removes stat boosts from Pokemon such as Clefable and Serperior, while Stun Spore can be used as a secondary status moves to catch opponents off guard when they think they're safe after Spore has been used. Hidden Power Fire is an option to hit Ferrothorn and Scizor, both of which can otherwise wall Amoonguss. Sludge Bomb can be used for a stronger STAB move than Clear Smog with a 30% chance to poison the foe. Foul Play can also be used to punish setup sweepers such as Landorus-T and Mega Scizor if something on the opposing team is already sleeping while also being able to deal heavy damage to the likes of Mega Metagross.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs reduce damage from entry hazards and maximize Amoonguss's overall bulk. 92 Special Defense EVs allow Amoonguss to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Keldeo's Icy Wind, while the other EVs are poured into Defense with a Bold nature to better take on Pokemon such as Azumarill, Breloom, and Mega Lopunny. Regenerator allows Amoonguss to heal up upon switching out. Black Sludge is chosen to restore HP and is superior to Leftovers to punish Pokemon that wish to switch items with Trick. An alternate spread of 248 HP / 200 Def / 60 SpD with a Calm Nature can be used to avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Thundurus's Hidden Power Ice with Stealth Rock up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Amoonguss in on Pokemon such as Keldeo, Serperior, Breloom, and Azumarill early game to force them out. It can also switch into Rotom-W, but Rotom-W can easily bail out with Volt Switch. If Amoonguss switches in on a Volt Switch from Rotom-W, a counter to Amoonguss is likely going to come out, so be careful of this. Utilize Amoonguss as a pivot, double switching out of the things it checks to keep up momentum. Analyze what Pokemon your opponent is most likely to let Amoonguss cripple with Spore, and try to use Spore on something else if possible. Stun Spore should be used as a follow-up after something has been put to sleep with Spore. Double switching with Amoonguss can be important because it can allow certain Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur to come in without any repercussion. Amoonguss can also be used as an answer to certain setup sweepers such as Clefable and Mega Altaria thanks to Clear Smog, so be sure to keep it healthy to prevent these Pokemon from sweeping.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Amoonguss works well on teams with Tyranitar, which resists Psychic-, Flying-, and Fire-type attacks, while Amoonguss can take on Water-, Fairy-, and Fighting-type attacks in return. Amoonguss also checks key threats to sand teams such as Azumarill, Breloom, Celebi, and Keldeo, and Regenerator healing synergizes with this playstyle better than Mega Venusaur's Synthesis does. Water-types such as Slowbro and Rotom-W can check Fire-types such as Talonflame and Heatran, while Slowbro checks Mega Charizard X and Rotom-W checks Tornadus-T. Specially defensive Gastrodon is also a strong check to Fire-types and Tornadus-T, and it checks Mega Alakazam as well. Other Regenerator pivots such as Tornadus-T function well with Amoonguss for momentum purposes. Clefable can take on Latios, many variants of Tornadus-T, and Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Weavile. Mega Scizor checks Psychic- and Ice-types and can pick off fast threats with its priority Bullet Punch. Heatran can check Psychic- and Flying-types while setting up Stealth Rock and pressuring opposing Grass- and Steel-types. Skarmory can take on powerful Ground-types and many Psychic-types for Amoonguss while being able to remove hazards or set them up. Hippowdon sets up Stealth Rock and checks many Fire-types for Amoonguss such as Talonflame and Mega Charizard X.</p>"

  "Jellicent": {
    "overview": "<p>Jellicent has an excellent Ghost / Water defensive typing alongside a fantastic Special Defense stat, allowing it to act as a solid wall and the best spinblocker in the tier. It also has access to good utility moves such as Recover to keep itself healthy, Will-O-Wisp to cripple foes, and Taunt to prevent foes from healing, setting entry hazards, or throwing out a status move. Its ability Water Absorb also allows it to take Water-type attacks from the likes of Slowbro, Keldeo, and Starmie. Jellicent's Ghost typing makes it an excellent choice to have on hazard stacking teams, as it can block Rapid Spin from the likes of Excadrill and Starmie. Jellicent does, however, have very poor Speed, making it difficult to utilize Taunt against many fast Pokemon effectively. Jellicent's low Defense also holds it back, as it struggles to reliably check physical attackers such as Excadrill, Mega Metagross, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Medicham. Jellicent's typing also leaves it weak to common types like Dark and Electric.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Protect is a viable option to scout out moves, which is especially useful against Choice-locked Pokemon like Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Magnezone as well as Choice Band Weavile. An example of this is scouting whether Choice Scarf Tyranitar will use Pursuit or Crunch so you know whether or not you should switch out. Hex is also a viable option, as it can do a lot of damage in combination with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status Absorbers</strong>: Clefable does not mind being burnt by Scald or Will-O-Wisp from Jellicent and can recover off any damage thanks to Leftovers and Soft-Boiled. Gliscor can avoid being burnt thanks to its Toxic Orb and Poison Heal; it takes very little damage from Scald and can set up on Jellicent with Swords Dance. Mega Altaria does not mind being burnt, as it has access to Heal Bell, can set up on Jellicent with Dragon Dance, and can recover off any damage thanks to Roost.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Thundurus is able to soak up any hit from Jellicent and threaten it back with Thunderbolt. Magnezone can also take any hit from Jellicent and retaliate with Thunderbolt or Volt Switch to gain momentum. Rotom-W can cripple Jellicent with Will-O-Wisp and threaten it with a Volt Switch. Zapdos can threaten Jellicent with a STAB Electric-type move and recover off any damage Jellicent dishes out with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Serperior can threaten Jellicent with Leaf Storm or set up Substitute safely on it. Amoonguss can soak up anything Jellicent throws out and threaten it back with Spore or Giga Drain while being able to recover off any damage with Regenerator. Tangrowth shares a similar role, as it also has Regenerator and can threaten Jellicent with Giga Drain or Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Strong Dark-types like Tyranitar, Weavile, Crawdaunt, Bisharp, and Hydreigon can threaten Jellicent with a Dark-type move like Knock Off, Pursuit, Crunch, or Dark Pulse. However, a majority of them are physical attackers that do not appreciate taking Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status moves like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp chip down Jellicent, forcing it to use Recover or switch out. Jellicent also does not appreciate Thunder Wave, as it becomes slower than defensive Pokemon, allowing them to use a move before it can use Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Attacks that can do a lot of damage and force Jellicent to use Recover are threatening towards it. These attacks include Thunder Punch from Mega Metagross and Mega Medicham, Hidden Power Grass from Keldeo, Tail Glow-boosted attacks from Manaphy, Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor from Latios, Moonblast from Mega Diancie, Return from Mega Lopunny, and Thunderbolt from Mega Latias.</p>",

Recover is used to help Jellicent stay healthy throughout the game. Taunt can be used to stop foes from recovering, using status moves, setting up, or setting entry hazards. Scald is Jellicent's main STAB move and has a useful chance to burn foes. Night Shade offers consistent damage and enables Jellicent to chip down foes regardless of its lack of offensive EVs.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>44 Speed EVs allow Jellicent to outspeed Clefable so it can get off Taunt before Clefable can use Thunder Wave, Calm Mind, or Soft-Boiled. 44 Speed EVs also allow Jellicent to outspeed Pokemon with base 65 Speed, which includes Alomomola and Scizor before it Mega Evolves. 248 HP EVs allow Jellicent to take less damage from Spikes. 216 Defense EVs slightly optimize Jellicent's physical bulk, given its Bold nature. Leftovers provides Jellicent with passive recovery, though Colbur Berry can be used instead to help it absorb Dark-type moves like Knock Off, Crunch, and Pursuit.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jellicent should be used as a defensive pivot, so utilize Water Absorb to take Water-type attacks like Hydro Pump from Keldeo, Surf from Choice Specs Latios, and Scald from Starmie and Slowbro. Take advantage of Jellicent's Ghost typing to stop Rapid Spin from Excadrill and Starmie as well as Fighting-type moves like High Jump Kick from Mega Medicham and Hammer Arm from Mega Metagross. Use Will-O-Wisp to cripple threats like Ferrothorn, Excadrill Mega Scizor, and other physical attackers, and Taunt to stop setup and shut down slower defensive Pokemon like Chansey and Clefable. Recover should be used to keep Jellicent healthy and out of range of foe attacks. If running Colbur Berry, use it to absorb a Dark-type move like Crunch or Knock Off from a physical attacker like Bisharp, Weavile, or Tyranitar and retaliate with Will-O-Wisp, making it easier for Jellicent to handle them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jellicent is the best spinblocker in the tier, making Spikes setters like Ferrothorn and Skarmory good partners. Ferrothorn is especially good, as it can also provide support through Thunder Wave and Knock Off. Jellicent also appreciates its own hazard removal, making spinners like Excadrill and Defog users like Latios and Latias great partners. Jellicent does not appreciate taking status moves like Toxic, making status absorbers like Magic Guard Clefable and Gliscor great partners. Clefable and Gliscor also appreciate Jellicent's ability to bait Choice Band and Choice Scarf users like Tyranitar and Weavile to lock themselves into Pursuit so they can set up. The same applies to other setup Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Bisharp. Speaking of Pursuit, Pokemon like Weavile and Tyranitar can help Jellicent remove threats like Latios and Latias that resist Jellicent's Scald. Mega Metagross can also provide Pursuit support and checks the status absorbers that like switching into Jellicent's Will-O-Wisp, like Clefable and Gliscor, with Meteor Mash and Ice Punch, respectively. Assault Vest Tornadus-T can help deal with Grass-types like Serperior, switch into Dragon-types that resist Water like Latios, and provide Knock Off support. Mega Latias appreciates Jellicent's ability to burn Dark-types and can act as a wincon thanks to this. Heatran forms a nice defensive core with Jellicent, as it can take on Grass-types like Serperior as well as other threats like Choice Specs Latios and Volcarona. Heatran also appreciates Jellicent's ability to take on Water-types like Keldeo.</p>"

  "Alomomola": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting a massive HP stat, Alomomola perfectly epitomizes the concept of a bulky Water-type. With its good Defense stat to complement its HP, Alomomola is a great wall to many common OU Pokemon, including Talonflame, Garchomp, and Azumarill. It can heal itself and its teammates with gigantic Wishes, and it is the only usable Pokemon in OU with the combination of Wish and Regenerator, allowing it to heal itself as it passes Wishes to other Pokemon. Regenerator makes Alomomola difficult to wear down and mitigates potential entry hazard damage. As a defensive Pokemon, it has a good Water typing, as well as access to Scald to burn physical attackers that could try to set up on it. Scald also allows Alomomola to cripple defensive threats such as Ferrothorn and Mega Sableye. Unfortunately, Alomomola's Scald is very weak, often not even doing much to Pokemon it is super effective against, which means that Alomomola is vulnerable to setup sweepers with Substitute or those that aren't affected by burns such as Gyarados and Poison Heal Gliscor, respectively. However, Alomomola can still wall a huge amount of dangerous threats and is a fine choice on balanced and stall teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Some of Alomomola's other options include Refresh to alleviate Toxic poison, Healing Wish to restore a teammate back to full health, Light Screen to reduce the damage of special attacks, and possibly Soak in order to use Toxic on Pokemon immune to it, such as Mega Scizor and Amoonguss.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Strong Electric-types such as Thundurus, Mega Manectric, and Raikou can easily KO Alomomola on its weaker Special Defense stat with powerful, super effective STAB moves, and they can also threaten to set up as it switches out. Magnezone is also notable, as it is immune to Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Defensive Grass-types such as Venusaur, Celebi, and Amoonguss take almost no damage from Scald, are immune to Toxic (Natural Cure aids in Celebi's case), threaten Alomomola with Giga Drain and sleep-inducing moves, and are able to completely stall it out. Mega Venusaur is definitely better than the others, as it uses Synthesis more often, has a stronger Giga Drain, and can freely switch into Knock Off. It does lack Black Sludge or Leftovers recovery, though. Serperior can switch in and force Alomomola out with Leaf Storm as well.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers with the appropriate coverage moves, such as Mega Charizard Y and Hidden Power Electric Keldeo, can muscle through Alomomola lacking Mirror Coat.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Gliscor</strong>: Gliscor takes little damage from Scald, can't get burned, and can cripple Alomomola with Toxic while recovering with Poison Heal, Protect, and possibly Roost. It can even set up Swords Dance multiple times. Other Pokemon with Toxic such as Chansey and Mega Sableye can also be bothersome, as the move limits Alomomola's opportunities to switch in, especially with entry hazards up.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Alomomola's only attacking move is a weak Scald used for its burn chance, so Substitute sweepers are a real pain for it. Substitute + Dragon Dance Gyarados resists Scald, so it can set up Dragon Dance on Alomomola, potentially troubling the rest of the team too. Substitute Kyurem-B and Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo also pose rather large problems to Alomomola.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set walls a lot of common and powerful Pokemon and passes very large Wishes to Alomomola's teammates. Protect prevents Alomomola from taking damage as it receives its own Wish while also aiding it in Toxic stalling and occasionally scouting moves such as Hidden Power Electric on Keldeo. Toxic cripples the offensive Pokemon Alomomola walls by putting them on a timer and gives it a means of damaging defensive Pokemon with reliable recovery, but if you feel that Scald is enough for this, Knock Off can be used instead to hinder switch-ins such as Chansey and Keldeo. Scald is used against physical attackers that can potentially set up and muscle their way through Alomomola, and it is also necessary for Steel-types such as Mega Scizor. Mirror Coat is quite niche, but it is useful for surprising special attackers such as Latios. However, the teams Alomomola is on should have the necessary means for dealing with stronger special attackers. It is, however, very useful against RestTalk Suicune.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers provides Alomomola with passive recovery, but Rocky Helmet is viable too, as Alomomola already has two means of recovery, one of which happens without the use of a move. Because of Alomomola's incredible HP stat, it is more beneficial to invest heavily in Defense and Special Defense. 36 HP EVs are enough to reach a Leftovers number. Special Defense is maximized because Alomomola needs investment there to perform as a mixed wall, and the rest of the EVs are put into Defense. Fully invested Special Defense with 36 HP EVs is much better than 252 HP / 252 Def because the overall physical bulk is around the same but Alomomola's special bulk gets much better. If you choose not to use Scald, a Careful nature should be used over a Calm nature.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alomomola should switch into many attackers, such as Talonflame, Mega Metagross, Mega Charizard X, Keldeo, Garchomp, Mamoswine, Mega Diancie, Mega Lopunny, Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Terrakion, and from there it almost always should use Wish, as the opponent will often switch out to a Pokemon that can beat Alomomola. Alomomola can use this opportunity to heal a teammate or itself. Protect can also be used to scout for Choice-locked moves, but it can get predictable very easily, especially when using it with Wish.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alomomola fits the best on balanced and stall teams. It works very well with potent defensive Pokemon that lack reliable recovery, such as Ferrothorn and Heatran. Amoonguss has great defensive synergy with Alomomola; it can take on Mega Manectric, Celebi, and Serperior, for example, and Alomomola can take on some Pokemon that trouble Amoonguss, such as Talonflame. Amoonguss is also capable of absorbing Toxic Spikes which can wear down Alomomola very quickly. They also both have Regenerator, making them almost impossible to wear down, with few Pokemon able to deal with both outside of Nasty Plot Hidden Power Flying or Psychic Thundurus. Specially defensive Hippowdon completes a brilliant core here, taking on this Thundurus variant, Raikou, and Mega Manectric. Clefable also makes for a great teammate, as it can absorb status. Mega Charizard X and Ferrothorn also create an excellent balanced core with Alomomola, as they all cover each other's weaknesses.</p>"

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn has a lot to love as a defensive Pokemon. First and foremost, it has a great Grass / Steel typing and solid mixed bulk. Together, its unique set of resistances and bulk allow Ferrothorn to check a plethora of threats. In addition to this, Ferrothorn has access to a wide array of support moves, such as Stealth Rock, Spikes, Leech Seed, and Thunder Wave. Because it has decent offensive presence, Ferrothorn can be hard to switch into for many offensively-oriented teams. However, while Ferrothorn's typing gives it a great set of resistances, it also gives it a glaring 4x weakness to Fire-type attacks, which means that Ferrothorn is easily forced out by Fire-type opponents. In addition to this, some special attackers, such as Latios, can get past Ferrothorn if they are carrying Hidden Power Fire. Ferrothorn's typing also leaves it vulnerable to being trapped by the increasingly common Magnezone. Lastly, Ferrothorn's Speed is terrible, which means it has to rely on surviving an attack before using a move itself.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Ferrothorn has access to quite a few support moves, it doesn't really have many other options than the ones mentioned in the main set. Bulldoze hits Heatran and Magnezone hard, but it will not OHKO either of them. Toxic can be used to punish bulky switch-ins, such as Zapdos, Mew, and Mandibuzz, while Curse is a decent boosting option, as Ferrothorn has high Special Defense and is immune to Toxic. Rest is an option alongside Leech Seed for semi-reliable recovery. It should be noted that Ferrothorn has to drop a utility move if running Rest, however. If Ferrothorn is run on Trick Room teams, Explosion is an option, as it does a lot of damage to most opponents and gains momentum for the team. With its decent offensive stats, it also has the option to run a Choice Band set, but such a set is gimmicky and wastes Ferrothorn's potential as a support Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Heatran resist Ferrothorn's STAB attacks and can OHKO Ferrothorn with their respective Fire-type STAB attacks. However, Mega Charizard X and Talonflame must be wary of the recoil damage from Flare Blitz and Iron Barbs. Volcanion can also threaten Ferrothorn with its high-powered Fire-type moves but can take hefty damage from Power Whip.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur takes little-to-no damage from Power Whip, can tank Ferrothorn's Gyro Balls, and can do significant damage in return with Hidden Power Fire. Mega Venusaur is also immune to Leech Seed, so it only has to be wary of the uncommon Thunder Wave. Amoonguss can also switch into Ferrothorn freely and wear it down with Hidden Power Fire, while the likes of Hidden Power Fire Celebi can also do the same and not fear being crippled by Thunder Wave thanks to Natural Cure.</p> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: If Ferrothorn is not running Shed Shell, Magnezone can trap Ferrothorn with Magnet Pull and proceed to do a lot of damage with Hidden Power Fire. Magnezone also fears very little from Ferrothorn, as it resists its STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Mega Scizor</strong>: With the combination of Roost and Swords Dance, Mega Scizor uses Ferrothorn as setup fodder, as it fears nothing that Ferrothorn can throw at it.</p> <p><strong>Magic Guard users</strong>: With maximum investment in Defense or a Speed-reducing nature, Clefable can outstall Ferrothorn's Gyro Balls and proceed to set up with Calm Mind. It can also 2HKO Ferrothorn with unboosted Flamethrowers. Reuniclus also doesn't care about what Ferrothorn does and proceeds to set up with Calm Mind and then pick it off with Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Strong Fighting-types, such as Terrakion, Keldeo, Mega Heracross, Mega Lopunny, Mega Gallade and Mega Medicham, can do hefty amounts of damage to Ferrothorn with their STAB moves, if not OHKO it. They all have to be wary of switching into Gyro Ball or Power Whip, however. Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham both need to be wary of Protect since their main way of damaging Ferrothorn is High Jump Kick.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users that fear little from Ferrothorn's attacks, such as Mew and Mandibuzz, completely shut it down, as Ferrothorn can't use Leech Seed when Taunted.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos resists both Ferrothorn's STAB moves and can threaten Ferrothorn out with Heat Wave or Defog its entry hazards away.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ferrothorn is a consistent setter of Spikes because of its great bulk and ability to beat common entry hazard removers, such as Latios, Latias, and Excadrill. Stealth Rock is an alternative if your team lacks a user of the move. Because of its ability to take on common hazard removers, Ferrothorn is also one of the best defensive Spikes setters. Leech Seed gives Ferrothorn a way of recovering health and is a must on every Ferrothorn set, as it lacks reliable recovery. The damage Leech Seed does is also useful for chipping away at the opponent's health. Gyro Ball is Ferrothorn's primary choice for an attacking move, as it OHKOes Mega Gardevoir, and does significant damage to many fast Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, Gengar, and Fairy-types such as Clefable and Sylveon. Power Whip is generally preferred in the last slot so that Ferrothorn can deal with Substitute Mega Gyarados and hit Azumarill, Keldeo, Excadrill, and Hippowdon hard; it can even be run over Gyro Ball if Protect or Thunder Wave is desirable. Protect in tandem with Leech Seed grants Ferrothorn even more recovery and can scout the opponent's next move. Ferrothorn appreciates all the recovery it can get as it has no form of instant, significant recovery. If the ability to cripple common switch-ins such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran is important, Thunder Wave is an option for the last moveslot. Knock Off is yet another option to annoy common switch-ins by removing their item, such as Heatran's, Zapdos's and Mew's Leftovers, and can be run in the last moveslot. Finally, Ferrothorn can opt to run both Stealth Rock and Spikes on the same set, which is effective as Ferrothorn gets opportunities to set up hazards on many common Pokemon and doesn't really need any of the moves in the last slot, though this does put a lot of pressure on Ferrothorn. It's generally only used on more offensively inclined teams that can't fit Stealth Rock elsewhere and are using Ferrothorn for its defensive and supportive traits.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread with a Relaxed nature lets Ferrothorn fare well against both physically and specially oriented opponents. 168 Special Defense EVs give Ferrothorn enough special bulk to survive two Ice Beams from +3 Manaphy. A Sassy nature with the given EV spread allows Ferrothorn to survive the combination of Hyper Voice + Focus Blast from Modest Mega Gardevoir most of the time, while still avoiding the 2HKO from +1 Mega Gyarados's Earthquake most of the time; the downside is that this leaves Ferrothorn much more susceptible to Crunch from Mega Gyarados and physical attackers in general, so it isn't typically recommended. If there's a lot of stress on Ferrothorn to handle physical attackers such as Azumarill, Life Orb Excadrill, Mega Gyarados, and Diggersby, more Defense investment can be run to tank hit from these Pokemon more easily. An example of a more physically defensive spread is 252 HP / 168 Def / 88 SpD avoids the 2HKO from Adamant Life Orb Excadrill after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Leftovers is the preferred item, as Ferrothorn heavily appreciates the added recovery. Chople Berry is another useful item that allows Ferrothorn to take less damage from Fighting-types or the likes of Mega Gardevoir and Mega Alakazam and proceed to cripple them with Thunder Wave or OHKO the latter two with Gyro Ball. However, Shed Shell is a decent alternative over Leftovers if the ability to escape from Magnezone is more valuable to your team than the extra recovery Leftovers provides. Rocky Helmet is an alternate option over Leftovers or Shed Shell in order to weaken physical attackers that try to hit Ferrothorn with weaker attacks, such as U-turn, Knock Off, and not very effective moves that make contact.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It's advised to send in Ferrothorn on a Pokemon that does not really threaten it, such as Azumarill, Chansey, opposing Ferrothorn, Slowbro, or Suicune, and proceed to set up Stealth Rock or Spikes. Leech Seed is the most spammable move in the moveset, and if the opposing team lacks a Pokemon that is immune to it, it's more than likely favorable to use it. Playing carefully with Protect is advised, as it can be easy to take advantage of. Its main uses are letting Ferrothorn gain extra recovery in a pinch and scouting for lures such as Hidden Power Fire Latios. You should always scout for this type of moves by using Protect or switching out, especially if Ferrothorn is important to beat the opposing team. If the opposing team has a Defogger capable of switching safely into Ferrothorn, such as Skarmory or Zapdos, pulling double switches to stop them from Defogging is smart. Lastly, if not running Shed Shell, it's advised to play carefully around Magnezone, especially if Ferrothorn is important to take on a member of the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that are capable of dealing with Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Heatran make good teammates. Heatran excels at this role, especially if holding an Air Balloon. It can also set Stealth Rock, which allows Ferrothorn to run Spikes. Defiant users that can take advantage of the opponent trying to remove Ferrothorn's entry hazards with Defog, such as Bisharp and Thundurus, also make good teammates. If running a Sassy nature, Ferrothorn's physical walling capabilities are reduced, so Pokemon that can deal with strong physical attackers such as Life Orb Excadrill and Diggersby make great teammates. Defensive Landorus-T is one of the best options, as it is also capable of running Stealth Rock. Fairy-types such as Clefable and Azumarill also make good partners because they can take on Fighting-types. Lastly, Keldeo and Infernape make good teammates, as they are capable of beating Mega Scizor and Bisharp, both of which can use Ferrothorn as setup fodder.</p>"

  "Haxorus": {
    "overview": "<p>In a tier rife with Dragons of all shapes and sizes, Haxorus maintains several noteworthy traits over its dragon brethren. It retains the highest Attack stat of all non-legendary Dragon-types, surpassed only by Kyurem-B and Mega Garchomp, neither of which have access to Dragon Dance. Haxorus's pure Dragon typing, being oddly uncommon, makes it far less susceptible to non-STAB Ice attacks that are often carried for the likes of Dragonite and Garchomp. Furthermore, Haxorus's relatively rare ability, Mold Breaker, allows it to disregard Pokemon with otherwise problematic abilities like Levitate Rotom-W, Filter Mega Aggron, Unaware Clefable, numerous Sturdy users, and Multiscale Dragonite. However, Haxorus is not without its faults. Haxorus's overall lack of bulk means that it is easily 2HKOed by strong neutral hits and is potentially vulnerable while setting up. Fairy-types will also make you hesitate to use Outrage, meaning that it isn't just the ubiquitous Steel-types it needs to worry about anymore. While Haxorus has enough coverage options to handle most Steel- and Fairy-types, it can't cover everything and can find itself hard-walled without the right team support. Base 97 Speed is acceptable for wallbreaking and sufficient with enough boosts to clean up late-game with an unresisted Outrage. Haxorus has the right stats, ability, moves, and typing to perform its role very well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Low Kick is Haxorus's best attack against Ferrothorn and can OHKO Mamoswine and Mega Gyarados at +1, as well as hitting Heatran that carry Air Balloon. Rock Slide is a fair choice on Choice Scarf sets, being able to hit many of the faster 4x weak Pokemon like Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Volcarona with the potential to flinch. Superpower with Swords Dance is the most efficient way to consistently deal with Skarmory, but offers little else. Dragon Claw is Haxorus's most conservative and reliable STAB move if you hate Outrage's lock-in and Dual Chop's accuracy, but it comes with a severe reduction in power. Aqua Tail provides good neutral coverage with Dragon-type attacks and can be particularly useful against Air Balloon Heatran and Excadrill, but leaves Haxorus walled by Azumarill and Ferrothorn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Airborne Steel-types</strong>: Haxorus's most common sets are not tailored to handling airborne Steel-types. Without Taunt for Skarmory or Aqua Tail for Air Balloon Heatran and Excadrill, Haxorus will be hard-pressed to come out on top.</p> <p><strong>Speedy Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon with immediate access to Speed and power like Keldeo demolish stallbreaker sets, and even then certain Choice Scarf users like Garchomp and priority users can take advantage of Dragon Dance Haxorus, even after a boost. Requiring setup time to be effective puts Haxorus at an immediate disadvantage against most Pokemon that outspeed it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance is Haxorus's boosting move of choice, giving it the power and Speed he needs to rip through weakened walls and slower sweepers. Earthquake is great for handling Steel-types like Heatran and Klefki, and is also great for hitting Rotom-W. Taunt completely shuts down would-be walls like Skarmory that don't carry Brave Bird, helping Haxorus nab additional boosts. For wallbreaking or sweeping, Outrage will benefit Haxorus the most with its insane power, as Dragon Claw and Dual Chop severely lack power in general and prevent Haxorus from fulfilling its role.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Dragon Dance is the better boosting move to let Haxorus compete with hyper-offensive teams, as the Speed boosts are crucial. Once Haxorus ideally gets to +2, simply use Outrage, assuming no Fairy-types remain, and never look back. 240 Speed EVs maintains an advantage over Jolly Dragonite and other max Speed base 80s as well as Jolly Gyarados, and max Speed Kyurem-B if you choose a Jolly nature. Life Orb gives Haxorus some extra oomph and compensates in situations where it can't get as many desired Dragon Dances in, helping it continue its rampage. Haxorus is still threatening without boosts against slow or weakened Pokemon like Heatran and Tyranitar with Earthquake, or Breloom with Poison Jab. Taunt often makes slow walls like Chansey and Skarmory switch out, giving Haxorus breathing room to boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Haxorus requires safe opportunities to boost to overpower sturdy walls and bypass faster and frailer threats. Getting two Dragon Dances is your goal and is often enough to shift the odds in your favor against many would-be checks and counters. A weakened team with Steel- and Fairy-types eradicated simply cannot stand up to its mighty Outrage. Don't try to switch Haxorus into anything, and ideally remove priority users beforehand. A slow Volt Switch or U-turn is a reliable method of getting Haxorus in unscathed against favorable matchups. Rotom-W can be Taunted and often has to Volt Switch out as a result, which Haxorus fortunately resists. Heatran fears Earthquake, and Air Balloon versions can safely be Taunted and thus are unable to use Substitute, Will-O-Wisp, or Roar. Having Stealth Rock is generally helpful against priority users such as Talonflame and Dragonite. Zapdos carries no threatening moves and is easy to set up against, with Taunt as insurance. Ferrothorn that lack Gyro Ball are also pure setup and Taunt bait, and Earthquake doesn't activate Iron Barbs or incur Rocky Helmet damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Most Steel-types protect Haxorus from all three of its weaknesses. Heatran's plethora of resistances and great bulk make it a reliable team player with Fire STAB for other Steel-types and the ability to lay Stealth Rock. Any U-turn or Volt Switch user can help get Haxorus in for free against an unwilling opponent, allowing for more boosting opportunities. Rotom-W is a popular choice that is easy to fit onto most teams and is a good answer for Talonflame, Scizor, Air Balloon Heatran, and Landorus-T, slows down faster enemies with Thunder Wave, and can scout with Volt Switch. Rotom-H similarly handles Talonflame but is also great against many Steel-types such as Scizor, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn, handily resisting their common moves and threatening to OHKO with Overheat. Being immune to burn as well as paralysis like Rotom-W is also beneficial. Landorus-T can prompt switches with Intimidate and can U-turn Haxorus in safely on top of setting up Stealth Rock. Klefki protects you from opposing Dragon-, Fairy-, and Ice-type attacks, has access to Prankster Thunder Wave, can set up dual screens for Haxorus to boost behind more safely.</p>"
      },
      "Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance with Mold Breaker makes Haxorus an insane wallbreaker and the most potent Dragon-type capable of defeating Fairy-types. Outrage is for maddening power, but Dual Chop is better for handling Substitute and Focus Sash users, especially Substitute Kyurem-B. Earthquake hits the majority of Steel-types and +2 Poison Jab makes short work of even Unaware Clefable, Azumarill, Togekiss, and Sylveon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>For pure wallbreaking purposes, Swords Dance gives Haxorus the power it needs to be one hell of an anti-stall Pokemon. Lum Berry is a great item to let Haxorus boost in the face of slower walls that would depend on a burn or Toxic to cripple it, and is recommended if Haxorus forgoes Taunt. Otherwise, use Life Orb to wallbreak better. However, Lum Berry does cure confusion caused by Outrage, so keep that in mind. 240 Speed EVs keeps Haxorus faster than max Speed neutral-natured Kyurem-B, which can be crucial without Dragon Dance to boost its Speed, and a Jolly nature guarantees it. Mold Breaker is by far Haxorus's best and most consistent ability, ignoring Sturdy, Multiscale, Magic Bounce, Unaware, and Levitate.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As a pure stallbreaker set, Haxorus is forgoing Speed for power. Use a Lum Berry to setup in the face of would-be threats, and after it has taken out Steel- and Fairy-types with Earthquake and Poison Jab you are free to demolish with Outrage. Chansey can waste a turn trying to use Toxic if Haxorus has a Lum Berry, and a +2 Outrage is a guaranteed OHKO after Stealth Rock or with Life Orb and no Stealth Rock. Thundurus is OHKOed by Outrage no matter what, so don't attempt to use Swords Dance when it has priority Taunt and instead hope it wastes a turn using Thunder Wave or Nasty Plot.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stallbreaker Haxorus struggles against hyper-offensive teams, and as such wants naturally fast partners and priority users. Assault Vest Conkeldurr is great for sponging some special hits as well as status effects and has Mach Punch. Mega Aggron is also very bulky and has Thunder Wave and Dragon Tail to slow down or phaze the opponent. Bisharp threatens Fairy-types and Defog users with Defiant and has Sucker Punch. Azelf is a great dual screens user and can lay some entry hazards for easier KOes, as well as threaten fast and frail threats like Keldeo, Thundurus, and Terrakion. Talonflame is one of the best priority users around, and Tailwind makes Haxorus immediately more threatening and better suited for fighting balance and heavy offense. Klefki has access to priority Thunder Wave and dual screens while resisting all of Haxorus's weaknesses. If you opt to have a Chansey for Wish, Aromatherapy, and Natural Cure support, you can rationalize forgoing Lum Berry for Life Orb. Choice Scarf Excadrill is a natural at handling fast threats and can spin the opponent's entry hazards away while preserving your own. Focus Sash Alakazam is also insanely fast and is able to revenge kill or eliminate fast sweepers with strong special attacks. Terrakion is also a fast teammate that doesn't particularly mind Talonflame's priority and even benefits from Sucker Punch, courtesy of Justified.</p>"

  "Bisharp": {
    "overview": "<p>Bisharp is a top-tier threat in ORAS OU, as it sports numerous positive traits that allow it to take on many different team archetypes. Defiant, STAB Knock Off and Sucker Punch, and the ability to check many top-tier threats, such as Latios, Latias, and Clefable, make Bisharp a good choice for many offensive teams. Additionally, it can act as a great setup sweeper with Swords Dance or support the team by using Pursuit to trap Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Latios and Gengar. However, it still has a few drawbacks, such as a nasty 4x weakness to Fighting-type attacks, average-at best-Speed, and the tendency to be setup bait for many Mega Evolutions. Additionally, Bisharp is often reliant on Sucker Punch to deal with faster Pokemon, which leads to mind games that can sway the game in either side's favor depending on the outcome.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt can be used to punish defensive Pokemon like Skarmory and Quagsire that want to heal up against Bisharp or, in the case of Skarmory, go for a Defog or layer of Spikes. This makes Bisharp a more effective stallbreaker, but Swords Dance and Pursuit are typically superior options because they are better in matchups outside of stall. A Stealth Rock set with a Focus Sash can be used as a good hazard setter that beats most Defoggers and Rapid Spinners one-on-one, although there are usually better options out there for laying down entry hazards. Finally, Low Kick allows Bisharp to take on opposing Ferrothorn and opposing Bisharp more reliably, while also 2HKOing Heatran. Bisharp can run Pursuit in order to trap threats such as Latios and Latias, but other Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Weavile usually pull it off better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Many Fighting-types, such as Mega Lopunny, Terrakion, Breloom, and Conkeldurr, are able to check Bisharp, as they resist Knock Off and can score an easy OHKO with one of their STAB moves. Keldeo, Cobalion, Lucario, and Infernape also resist Iron Head, which makes them reliable checks that are able to switch into Bisharp repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Dark-types</strong>: Many opposing Dark-types take little damage from Iron Head and resist Knock Off, which allows them to switch into Bisharp quite reliably. Mandibuzz and Mega Gyarados can switch into Bisharp without fearing any of its attacks. Mandibuzz can Roost stall and wear Bisharp down with Foul Play and Mega Gyarados can set up a Dragon Dance on it. Additionally, opposing Bisharp carrying Low Kick can check Bisharp well. Choice Scarf Tyranitar also deserves a mention, as it resists Sucker Punch and can OHKO Bisharp with Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp and Substitute</strong>: Rotom-W, Heatran, defensive Mega Charizard X, Bulky Talonflame, and fast variants of Mew, can all burn Bisharp with Will-O-Wisp, which effectively renders Bisharp useless if it is not carrying a Lum Berry. Additionally, Substitute blocks Sucker Punch, giving the user a free turn against Bisharp. Users of Substitute such as Gyarados, Excadrill, and Mega Gardevoir are able to defeat or cause significant damage to Bisharp with a free turn.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Gliscor, bulky Garchomp, Quagsire, and physically defensive Hippowdon fear little from Bisharp's attacks and can KO it back with STAB Earthquakes, while the latter two also have reliable recovery. Additionally, Pokemon such as Chesnaught, Mega Slowbro, Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Counter Skarmory can defeat Bisharp if it lacks Swords Dance.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Bisharp's main STAB move, as it hits incredibly hard and has utility in removing items. Swords Dance boosts Bisharp's attack to insane levels and puts immediate pressure on a lot of offensive teams. Iron Head hits Fairy-types super effectively and is Bisharp's best bet against many Mega Evolutions, such as Mega Venusaur. Sucker Punch hits faster Pokemon that Bisharp would otherwise be unable to touch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment is used to hit as hard and fast as possible. An Adamant nature bolsters Bisharp's high attack stat further, allowing it to OHKO Choice Scarf Landorus-T after Stealth Rock damage. A Jolly nature ensures Bisharp can outrun threats such as Adamant Mega Altaria and Diggersby, but Adamant variants are uncommon now. It also ensures Bisharp will Speed tie at worst against opposing Bisharp. Life Orb is the preferred item, as it boosts the power of all of Bisharp's attacks, although Black Glasses can be used if the recoil from Life Orb is unappealing, which is the case when using the aforementioned EV spread. Additionally, a Lum Berry is an option to aid in setting up on bulky Water-types, as Bisharp will no longer have to worry about random Scald burns. It also helps with Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Rotom-W, Mew, and Mega Gardevoir.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This variant of Bisharp is best used as a late-game sweeper against offensive teams, so consider saving it for after its checks and counters have been sufficiently weakened. However, Bisharp can act as a powerful wallbreaker early- or mid-game against more defensively oriented teams, so bringing it in early versus a Pokemon it can set up on, such as Stealth Rock Clefable, is advisable. Additionally, Bisharp makes for a good revenge killer thanks to its powerful Sucker Punch, which can be used to revenge kill certain sweepers such as Gengar, Mega Metagross, and Sand Rush Excadrill after prior damage. Note that Sucker Punch, as it requires the foe to use an attack in order to work, can be taken advantage of in certain situations by providing the foe with free switches or a Substitute. When using Bisharp, it is important to recognize the following situation: the foe has a non-attacking move and attempts to stall out Sucker Punches. Bisharp can stop using Sucker Punch at any point and go for an attack, which the foe can punish with well-timed attack of their own. There isn't any specific strategy related to getting out of these scenarios, so try to avoid them as much as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bisharp struggles immensely with Fighting-types, so teammates that can handle Pokemon such as Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gallade are appreciated. Such Pokemon include Clefable, Celebi, and Mega Metagross. Choice Band Azumarill also makes for a good teammate, as it can take on Pokemon that are able to stomach an unboosted Sucker Punch from Bisharp, such as Garchomp and Mega Charizard X. Pokemon that can capitalize on Bisharp's ability to remove Fairy-types also synergize well with it, such as Latios, Latias, Mega Gallade, and Keldeo. Lastly, Bisharp is able to deter the removal of entry hazards via Defog thanks to Defiant, so heavy offense suicide leads such as Garchomp, Azelf, Mamoswine, and Custap Berry Skarmory pair well with Bisharp.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Bisharp's main Dark-type move, dealing heavy damage on top of removing items from switch-ins like Skarmory, Zapdos, and Rotom-W. Iron Head is Bisharp's secondary STAB move, enabling it to properly check bulky Fairy-types. Sucker Punch lets Bisharp revenge kill frail offensive threats like Mega Alakazam and Latios while also allowing it to pick off Pokemon like Volcarona after some chip damage. Pursuit allows Bisharp to trap and remove prevalent threats such as Latios, Latias, and Tornadus-T as well as get chip damage on Choice-locked Pokemon like Weavile. Low Kick can be used over Pursuit if the team is especially weak to opposing Bisharp and not in need of Pursuit.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP on Bisharp maximizes bulk, helping Bisharp check and trap Pokemon like Serperior and Latios while also allowing Bisharp to pivot in against Pokemon like Weavile and Tyranitar. Maximum Attack is preferred on this set, as it is needed to effectively Pursuit trap bulkier Psychic-types like Slowbro, Mega Latias, and Cresselia. An alternative spread of 144 HP / 252 Atk / 112 SpD can be used to survive +3 Manaphy's Surf, at the cost of some physical bulk. Finally, some Speed can also be used on this set, but it is not needed, as outpacing the likes of Skarmory and Mega Scizor is unnecessary.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The main use of this set is to come in on Psychic- and Ghost-types, which Bisharp can immediately threaten with Knock Off and Pursuit. Bisharp is also able to Pursuit trap any Pokemon that is afraid of getting KOed by Sucker Punch. The set focuses on support, with Knock Off removing items such as Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from Pokemon like Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Skarmory and Sucker Punch giving Bisharp a priority move, letting it revenge kill faster Pokemon that threaten it, like Mega Alakazam, Mega Metagross, and Gengar. Bisharp must be used carefully throughout the course of a match, avoiding moves like Will-O-Wisp and Scald so as to not compromise its longevity. Defiant prevents Intimidate users from walling Bisharp while also punishing Defog attempts from Pokemon such as Zapdos and Latias.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Assault Vest Bisharp thrives with teammates that struggle versus bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types. Pokemon like Mega Gallade, Mega Medicham, and Mega Metagross, all of which struggle against Cresselia, Slowbro, and Cofagrigus, greatly appreciate Bisharp's ability to Pursuit trap or at least weaken these foes. Teammates that can cover Bisharp's weaknesses to Ground-, Fighting-, and Fire-type attacks, such as Tornadus-T, Dragonite, and Mega Latias, are appreciated. Other Pokemon like Rotom-W and Thundurus are also great teammates, as they can bring in Bisharp comfortably with Volt Switch, allowing Bisharp to Pursuit trap foes more effectively.</p>"

  "Hydreigon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hydreigon's unique Dark / Dragon typing, high Special Attack and good overall stats, and wide range of coverage moves like Flash Cannon, Surf, and Fire Blast make it difficult for certain teams to switch into. Its ability in Levitate allows it to avoid all entry hazards barring Stealth Rock as well as Ground-type attacks like Earthquake from Landorus-T. Hydreigon's typing alongside its decent bulk allows it to switch into foes like Rotom-W and Slowbro with relative ease. However, with a mediocre Speed stat, Hydreigon is left vulnerable to offensive Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, Mega Metagross, Mega Charizard Y, and Latios that can all outspeed and threaten it. Hydreigon also struggles against Fairy-types such as Clefable, Azumarill, and Mega Altaria while also having a tough time breaking through specially defensive foes like Chansey.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave can be used on the Expert Belt set to cripple foe's speed. Earth Power can be used as a better way to hit the likes of Heatran. Additionally, Choice Scarf can be used as an item, allowing Hydreigon to outspeed offensive foes like Mega Metagross, Keldeo, Mega Diancie, and more. Life Orb is also an option to boost Hydreigon's damage output but does have the drawback of residual damage every turn. Superpower can be used as another method to hit Steel-types like Bisharp as well as a better way to hit Chansey.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types like Azumarill, Clefable, Mega Altaria, and Mega Diancie resist Hydreigon's STAB moves and threaten it back with their own. Hydreigon can, however, use Flash Cannon to deal a large amount of damage to each of them.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Chansey can consistently switch into Hydreigon's attacks and cripple it with Thunder Wave or Toxic or chip away at it with Seismic Toss. Assault Vest Tornadus-T can soak up hits from Hydreigon, remove its item with Knock Off, or use Hurricane and U-turn to chip away at it. Specially defensive Heatran can take hits from Hydreigon while retaliating back with Toxic but does not appreciate taking Surf or Choice Specs-boosted Dark Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Fast Offensive Foes</strong>: With Hydreigon's mediocre Speed stat, strong threats that are faster than it like Mega Lopunny, Choice Specs Latios, Mega Metagross, Keldeo, Weavile, Mega Diancie, Choice Scarf Excadrill, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar can all deal a great amount of damage to Hydreigon and revenge kill it. Most of these threats, however, do not appreciate switching into Hydreigon.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: If Hydreigon gets paralyzed, its Speed will become crippled, making it easier to revenge kill. If Hydreigon gets badly poisoned or burned, it gets put on a timer and into range of enemy attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dark Pulse is Hydreigon's primary STAB move with very few drawbacks, making it a very spammable move. Draco Meteor hits harder compared to Dark Pulse but is less reliable, lowering Hydreigon's Special Attack as well as having low PP and a chance to miss. Flash Cannon acts as a coverage move to primarily hit Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Altaria, which resist both of Hydreigon's STAB moves. Fire Blast is primarily used to hit Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and bulky Excadrill. Alternatively, Surf can be used to hit Fire-types like Heatran as well as Ground-types like Gliscor for more damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature let Hydreigon outspeed neutral-natured base 100s like Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard Y, and Manaphy. A Modest nature can also be run, which makes Hydreigon more powerful and harder to switch into but leaves it more vulnerable to revenge killers, as foes like Thundurus-T, Excadrill, and Modest Manaphy can now outspeed it. Levitate gives Hydreigon a useful immunity to Spikes and Ground-type attacks. Choice Specs makes Hydreigon a stronger breaker.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hydreigon should be used early-game to pressure and weaken opposing teams with its strong attacks. Dark Pulse should be spammed, as very few Pokemon can consistently take it. Draco Meteor is Hydreigon's most powerful move and should be used to net OHKOs. Do keep in mind that being locked into Draco Meteor drops Hydreigon's Special Attack, making it very passive and easily taken advantage of the following turns. Flash Cannon should be used on Fairy-types like Mega Altaria and Clefable as they switch in, leaving them at very low health. Hydreigon should not switch into many offensive foes' attacks, so VoltTurn support is recommended to provide it with a way to switch in safely. It can come in on more passive Pokemon or those using attacks it resists, though; for example, Slowbro and Rotom-W are passive and use resisted Water-type attacks, and Weavile and Tyranitar locked into a Dark-type move do not threaten it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Metagross is a great partner, as it can deal with Fairy-types that Hydreigon struggles with and also Pursuit trap the likes of Latios, which could otherwise offensively check Hydreigon. Volt Switch and U-turn users like Rotom-W and Tornadus-T are also good partners, as they can provide Hydreigon with a way to switch in safely. Tornadus-T can also provide Knock Off support, removing items like Chansey's Eviolite and Clefable's Leftovers to make it easier for Hydreigon to wear them down. Rotom-W can provide Thunder Wave support to cripple foes like Tornadus-T and Latios, which makes Hydreigon harder to revenge kill. Excadrill help deal with Fairy-types and absorbs Thunder Wave from the likes of Clefable while also appreciating Hydreigon's ability to handle bulky Water-types like Slowbro and Rotom-W. Ferrothorn is able to switch into Fairy-type attacks and can provide entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes, which help wear down Hydreigon's switch-ins. Clefable can act as a status absorber, spread paralysis via Thunder Wave, or provide Knock Off support to remove items like Tornadus-T's Assault Vest, Heatran's and other Clefable's Leftovers, and Chansey's Eviolite, making it easier for Hydreigon to break through them.</p>"

      "Expert Belt": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dark Pulse acts as Hydreigon's primary STAB move with great neutral coverage hitting the likes of Slowbro, Starmie, and Rotom-W for a good amount of damage. Flash Cannon is Hydreigon's coverage move to primarily hit Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Altaria, which could otherwise wall it. Flamethrower is used to hit Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Excadrill, Bisharp, and Skarmory and Grass-types like Serperior, Ferrothorn, and Amoonguss for super effective damage. Surf can be used to hit Fire-types like Heatran and Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T for super effective damage as well. Alternatively, Head Smash OHKOes Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>72 Defense and 4 HP EVs allow Hydreigon to always live a +2 Bullet Punch from Adamant Mega Scizor, even after Stealth Rock damage. 188 Speed EVs allow Hydreigon to outspeed foes up to Timid Heatran. A Modest nature with all the remaining EVs thrown into Special Attack allows it to hit as hard as possible. Expert Belt is the chosen item to boost Hydreigon's damage output and take advantage of its large movepool. Levitate is Hydreigon's only ability, and it allows it to avoid Ground-type moves and all entry hazards besides Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hydreigon should look to come in on weak or resisted hits like Scald from Slowbro and Starmie or Hydro Pump from Rotom-W. It can also pivot into Ground-type attacks like Earthquake from Gliscor or Landorus-T thanks to Levitate or come in on double switches giving it a favorable matchup. Predictions are necessary with Hydreigon in order to 2HKO foes like Clefable on the switch with super effective damage. With a lack of recovery, status aliments like Toxic and burn cripple Hydreigon, as it is put on a timer. Avoid letting Hydreigon get paralyzed, or else it will become easier for foes to revenge kill it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Heatran can deal with Fairy-types that annoy Hydreigon like Clefable while also providing Stealth Rock support and crippling Keldeo with Toxic. Amoonguss can resist Fairy-type attacks while also checking Keldeo, which resists all of Hydreigon's attacks. It also can provide Spore support, making it easier for Hydreigon to come in, or use Stun Spore on the likes of Tornadus-T and Latios, making Hydreigon harder to revenge kill. Tornadus-T can provide Knock Off support to get rid of Chansey's Eviolite, Clefable's Leftovers, and opposing Tornadus-T's Assault Vest, making it easier for Hydreigon to break through them. It can also provide U-turn support, making it easier for Hydreigon to come in. Excadrill can help Hydreigon check Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Altaria and provide entry hazard removal while also appreciating Hydreigon's ability to take on defensive Water-types like Slowbro and Rotom-W. Mega Metagross can also take on Fairy-types and Pursuit trap the likes of Latios and Latias, which can offensively check Hydreigon. Rotom-W can provide Thunder Wave support, crippling the likes of Clefable, Latios, and Tornadus-T, and has Volt Switch to allow Hydreigon to come in more easily. Ferrothorn can resist Fairy-types' attacks and provide Spikes support, making Hydreigon harder to switch into. It can also provide Thunder Wave support to make Hydreigon harder to revenge kill.</p>"

  "Volcarona": {
    "overview": "<p>Quiver Dance Volcarona is one of the most dangerous sweepers in ORAS OU. Its STAB moves, Giga Drain, and Hidden Power make it very difficult to switch into, its boosted attacks OHKO most Pokemon, and it outspeeds everything but a few Choice Scarf users after boosting, meaning it is more often checked than countered. Although it seems that Volcarona can sweep through a majority of teams on paper, in reality, its Stealth Rock weakness mandates entry hazard removal and limits setup opportunities. Its low bulk makes it susceptible to priority moves from Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Crawdaunt, Dragonite, and Bisharp. Volcarona's sweeps are shut down by Chansey, and without the proper coverage, it is also be walled by bulky Fire- and Dragon-types like Heatran, Volcanion, Mega Charizard X, and Dragonite.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ice can be used as a safer means of OHKOing bulky Ground-types like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. It also hits bulky Dragon-types like Mega Altaria and Dragonite harder. Fiery Dance can be used as a means of boosting while attacking; this is beneficial when faced with a Calm Mind sweeper like Clefable or Mega Latias. However, it is much less powerful than Fire Blast and is not as consistent as just using Quiver Dance. Life Orb Volcarona is an option that can be used to hit harder and sweep easier; however, its longevity is particularly bad given Volcarona's weakness to Stealth Rock. Unlike Timid Volcarona, +1 Modest Life Orb is able to surely OHKO Pokemon like Keldeo, Tyranitar, Rotom-W, Manaphy, Hippowdon, Gliscor, Gastrodon, and defensive Landorus-T. On hyper offense teams, Sitrus Berry can be a viable option if Stealth Rock is unable to be removed, giving Volcarona a slight boost in health to help it set up easier. Similarly, Passho Berry may allow Volcarona to set up more easily versus weak Water-types and reduce the likelihood of being revenge killed by Aqua Jet from Crawdaunt and Azumarill. Bulkier spreads with less Speed and Leftovers may also be used to increase Volcarona's longevity during a sweep. However, this increases Volcarona's chances of being outsped and severely damaged by Pokemon like Hydreigon and Excadrill while unboosted.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey's astronomical special bulk allows it to counter any variant of Volcarona and slowly KO it with Seismic Toss and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Due to Volcarona's low physical bulk, it needs to be at full health to take a hit while boosting. With Stealth Rock or Spikes up, Volcarona risks getting KOed while boosting and is more easily revenge killed by priority users.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, Dragonite, Crawdaunt, Azumarill, and Bisharp can all heavily chip or KO a boosted Volcarona. Talonflame is Volcarona's best check because it is immune to burn and can use Volcarona as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Coverage</strong>: Bulky Pokemon like Hippowdon, Garchomp, and Tornadus can take a hit from most +1 Volcarona and dent or KO them back with Rock Slide, Rock Tomb, or Smack Down.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fire-types</strong>: Volcarona is usually walled by the likes of Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran if not running the appropriate coverage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Pokemon like Volcanion and Suicune can take hits from Volcarona at +1 and remove its boosts with Haze or Roar.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Dragon-types</strong>: Without the appropriate coverage, Volcarona is unable to touch Mega Altaria, Mega Charizard X, and Dragonite. These Pokemon freely set up on Volcarona with Dragon Dance or simply KO it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance increases Volcarona's Speed so that it outruns all of the unboosted metagame. Fire Blast allows it to deal massive neutral damage, greatly threatening checks like Assault Vest Tornadus-T, especially when boosted. Alternatively, Flamethrower can be run as a more accurate option while still dealing high damage. Bug Buzz hits Psychic-types like Latias, Mew, and Reuniclus as well as deals great damage to checks like Tyranitar and Dragon-types like tank Garchomp, which are otherwise good answers to Volcarona. Giga Drain allows Volcarona to hit Water-types like Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Slowbro and Ground-types like Hippowdon, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon, all while providing Volcarona with a source of recovery. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ground allows Volcarona to muscle past Heatran and most Volcanion sets which are otherwise are good Volcarona checks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature guarantees an OHKO on Heatran with Hidden Power Ground and on Slowbro with Giga Drain. It also lets Volcarona OHKO specially defensive Gliscor and Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock with Fire Blast. The downside of running a Modest nature is that it leaves Volcarona than Choice Scarf Pokemon like Excadrill, Landorus-T, Kyurem-B even after a boost while also being slower than maximum Speed Excadrill, Landorus-T, Kyurem-B, Jolly Medicham, and Timid Manaphy at +0. This can be avoided by running a Timid nature, but this is at the expense of reducing the damage output and losing OHKOs on certain Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The power of this set allows Volcarona to be used at various points in the game as either an early-game or mid-game wallbreaker or as a late-game sweeper. It is especially lethal early game, since it can catch opponents off guard by immediately applying pressure as opposed to waiting until late-game scenarios to try and pull off a sweep. This lets Volcarona weaken its own checks by immediately throwing off attacks or setting up early to punch holes for teammates to come in and make use of. Avoid bringing Volcarona in against entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, to maximize Volcarona's health and let it stick around longer. Volcarona should be brought in on Pokemon it can safely set up against like Ferrothorn, non-Thunder Wave Clefable, and Steel-types like Skarmory and Magnezone.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock, are dangerous for Volcarona, so partners like Excadrill, Latias, and Zapdos that can remove hazards for it are great partners. Latias can provide Healing Wish, dual screens and Thunder Wave support to Volcarona, whereas Zapdos can bring it in safely with Volt Switch. Mega Diancie can prevent hazards with Magic Bounce and can come in on Tornadus-T, which Volcarona is threatened by. Dual screens support from Serperior also ensures that Volcarona can stay healthy for a longer duration. Clefable provides Knock Off support to remove items like Assault Vest from Tornadus-T and Tyranitar, allowing Volcarona to beat them easily. Pokemon that can take advantage of Volcarona's wallbreaking such as Manaphy and Keldeo make fantastic partners, since they benefit from Volcarona weakening their special checks in Tornadus-T and Latias while being able to deal with Volcarona's checks in Chansey and Sand Rush Excadrill.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>+1 Volcarona is faster than all relevant Pokemon bar Sand Rush Excadrill and rare Choice Scarf users like Garchomp, Terrakion, and Keldeo. Bug Buzz allows Volcarona to hit Psychic-types like Latios, Latias, Mew, and Reuniclus as well as Dark-types that resist Fire like Hydreigon and Tyranitar. Giga Drain provides some recovery and KOes Water-types like Keldeo, Gastrodon, Manaphy, Slowbro, Starmie, and Rotom-W after one or two boosts. Hidden Power Ground allows Volcarona to severely damage or KO a few Pokemon that would normally switch into it such as Heatran and Volcanion.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Flame Body can punish priority users that may try to whittle Volcarona down such as Fake Out Medicham and Lopunny, which become setup fodder if burnt. Even if Volcarona is KOed, a Flame Body burn can allow other team members to set up. Lum Berry enables setup on Pokemon that can inflict status like Serperior, Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Slowbro. It also can save Volcarona from foes that run Prankster + Thunder Wave such as Thundurus and Klefki.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When using Volcarona, always look for ways to chip its checks and counters. Volcarona enjoys Stealth Rock for wearing down checks like Talonflame and Volcanion over time and needs Stealth Rock removed from its own side before setting up. Common Pokemon that Volcarona can set up on are Ferrothorn, Serperior, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss; Volcarona can set up on Pokemon Choice locked into the wrong move such as -2 Latios and Latias locked into Draco Meteor, Magnezone locked into Hidden Power Fire, and even Keldeo locked into Secret Sword if Stealth Rock is not up. Do not underestimate Volcarona's special bulk while it is boosting. If the opponent switches to a Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Manaphy, Rotom-W, or Slowbro, Volcarona can easily use Quiver Dance again, avoiding a 2HKO while threatening to OHKO back. While Volcarona is mostly used as a mid- or late-game sweeper, it can also be used early-game to wallbreak and lure its checks into getting chipped or trapped.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Volcarona appreciates entry hazard removal from spinners like Excadrill and Starmie and Defoggers like Latios and Latias. Excadrill can also set Stealth Rock and appreciates Volcarona's ability to deal with Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Slowbro, Tangrowth, and Skarmory. Latias is also an excellent partner outside of Defog, as it provides dual screens, Safeguard, and Healing Wish support. On more offensive teams, Volcarona appreciates partners that can switch into and overwhelm its checks and counters. Pokemon like Manaphy can switch into Aqua Jet from Azumarill and Crawdaunt, while Thundurus can switch into Talonflame and use it to set up. Manaphy can overwhelm special walls like Chansey and help eliminate Fire-types like Heatran and Talonflame as well as Dragon- and Ground-types like Mega Altaria, Dragonite, Garchomp, and Hippowdon. Thundurus can help eliminate bulky Water-types like Suicune and checks to Volcarona such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Dragonite. Serperior is a unique utility option because it can set up dual screens for Volcarona or bait in checks like Heatran and KO them with Hidden Power. Pokemon that appreciate other Steel-types being removed such as Mega Metagross, Mega Altaria, Mega Diancie, and Dragonite also pair well with Volcarona; they support Volcarona by removing Heatran with Earthquake or Earth Power. Pokemon that appreciate bulky Psychic-types being removed such as Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny pair well with Bug Buzz Volcarona. In return, they remove Chansey with High Jump Kick and bulky-Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp with Ice Punch. On bulkier teams, Volcarona appreciates partners that can chip or trap its checks and counters. Knock Off users such as Bisharp, Weavile, Tornadus-T, and Clefable can help Volcarona sweep by removing items like Assault Vest from Tornadus-T, Eviolite from Chansey, and Leftovers from Heatran, specially defensive Garchomp, and Clefable. Pursuit users like Tyranitar can help Volcarona by trapping and chipping Pokemon like Heatran and Talonflame. Glare Serperior, Thunder Wave Clefable, and Starmie are great partners that can cripple bulky Water-types, Charizard, Heatran, Tornadus-T, Keldeo, Manaphy, and Clefable with status. If Volcarona's checks get paralyzed, it gets chances at free setup turns and has less to fear from opposing setup sweepers like Manaphy. Toxic from Pokemon like Gastrodon and Slowbro can be very important to wear down Talonflame, bulky Dragon-types like Garchomp, Dragonite, and Mega Altaria, and Fire-types like Volcarona and Charizard.</p>"
      },
      "Sub Swarm": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute beats some of Volcarona's common countermeasures such as status and priority users like Crawdaunt, Bisharp, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny. With Quiver Dance, Volcarona gets the special bulk to become very hard to KO. Flamethrower is run over Fire Blast because it is easier to spam and fish for a burn, which makes Volcarona's Substitute harder to break. Bug Buzz is run along with Swarm to maximize damage output versus bulky Water- and Ground-types like Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Garchomp, which can break Volcarona's Substitute repeatedly.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>88 HP EVs prevent +1 Volcarona's Substitute from being broken by Heatran's Lava Plume, allowing it to use Heatran as setup fodder. 184 Speed EVs with a Timid nature make Volcarona faster than Adamant Mega Medicham, Modest Manaphy, and Jolly Excadrill unboosted and faster than Choice Scarf Landorus-T after boosting. 236 Special Attack EVs give Volcarona a good chance to OHKO Hippowdon and Garchomp at +1 and Gastrodon at +2 with Swarm and some prior damage. Leftovers recovers HP against weak, passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Amoonguss while setting up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal is even more important because this set relies on Leftovers recovery and multiple Quiver Dance boosts to tank hits. Since Volcarona is mostly used as a mid- or late-game sweeper, it is also important to weaken checks beforehand. This can be done with entry hazards, which weaken Heatran, Volcanion, and Talonflame, or status, which cripples foes like Garchomp and Gastrodon. Volcarona sets up Substitute on Pokemon like Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, Magnezone locked into Hidden Power Fire, and -2 Latios and Latias. At +1, it can continue setting up versus Lava Plume Heatran, Scald Alomomola, defensive Zapdos, and Clefable.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters like Excadrill are good teammates for wearing down Volcarona answers like Heatran, Volcanion, and Talonflame with Stealth Rock. Knock Off users such as Clefable, Serperior, and Mega Scizor can lure in these Fire-types, Assault Vest Tornadus-T, and Eviolite Chansey. Serperior can deal with Water-types and bait in Fire-types to cripple them with Glare, chip them with Leech Seed, or outright KO them with boosted Hidden Power. Gastrodon can importantly switch into Keldeo and chip foes with Scald and Toxic. It also can combat the Fire-type setup sweepers that threaten Volcarona like Mega Charizard X and Talonflame with Toxic and Clear Smog. Partners that can help break through Chansey include Tail Glow Manaphy, Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, Keldeo, and Breloom.</p>"
      },
      "Bulkarona": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance is the key move that lets Volcarona always be a scary factor. Its ability to self-boost shall not be missing on this set either, as it allows it to set up and sweep. Roost helps with longevity, as this Volcarona requires more time to set up effectively as well as to heal chip damage from the like of Mega Lopunny, Mega Scizor, and Landorus-T. Furthermore, it helps to mitigate Stealth Rock damage. Flamethrower threatens Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp as well as Grass-types like Serperior and Amoonguss. Giga Drain allows Volcarona to recover while hitting Water-types like Keldeo, Volcanion, and Rotom-W. Alternatively, Bug Buzz hits Psychic-types like Mega Latias and hits typical switch-ins like Tyranitar and Garchomp harder.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>60 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Volcarona to outspeed Adamant Excadrill, and after two Quiver Dance boosts, it outspeeds Adamant Sand Rush Excadrill in sand. Furthermore, after a Quiver Dance, Volcarona is faster than Mega Lopunny and Tornadus-T. The rest of the EVs are put into bulk, allowing Volcarona to soft-check physical threats it is supposed to check like Mega Lopunny, Mega Metagross, and Weavile while threatening them back with a burn through Flame Body. It is worth nothing that Volcarona is an imperfect check to those and relies on its ability to burn them. Passho Berry allows it to take hits from Water-type threats like Keldeo, Volcanion, and Crawdaunt and potentially revenge kill them. An alternative spread is 248 HP / 100 Def / 160 Spe with a Timid nature, which allows Volcarona to outspeed Mega Alakazam at +1 as well as Excadrill and Adamant Mega Medicham unboosted.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bulky Volcarona should be used with caution. Its crippling weakness to Stealth Rock can limit switch in opportunities heavily. Furthermore, it can only check foes that threaten it, such as Weavile, Mega Metagross, and Mega Lopunny, it if it's already on the field and healthy. Ideally, Volcarona is brought in safely through a pivot on weak and unthreatening moves or after a Pokemon is KOed. This allows it easier setup opportunities. Before opting for a sweep, key checks like Talonflame, Garchomp, and sand core Pokemon like Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Excadrill should be out of the way. This Volcarona works best against teams that have soft checks to it such as Fake Out Mega Lopunny and Assault Vest Tornadus-T or against teams whose strategy is to revenge kill Volcarona by the likes of Aqua Jet Crawdaunt or Azumarill, especially if Passho Berry is used as the item. Moreover, status users like Chansey, Alomomola, and Clefable should be weakened or KOed, since especially Toxic but also paralysis can cripple Volcarona and cut its sweep attempt short.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Volcarona fits best on bulky offensive and VoltTurn teams where it can function as a defensive check. Its Flame Body burns can enable its teammates, it can keep up pressure on the opposing team, and it can find good setup opportunities. Due its crippling weakness to Stealth Rock, it relies on its teammates to remove or prevent them. Excadrill with Rapid Spin and common Defog users like Zapdos and Latias make excellent partners. Mega Diancie can help too by keeping entry hazards off the field. Taunt users like Thundurus and Serperior can prevent the use of entry hazards while fitting well on the teams Volcarona usually finds itself on. Landorus-T can help against sand teams, switching into Tyranitar and Excadrill while delivering chip damage with Rocky Helmet and threatening them out. Thundurus and Keldeo threaten Garchomp with Hidden Power Ice or Water-type moves and Excadrill, Heatran, and Tyranitar with their Fighting-type moves.</p>"

  "Cobalion": {
    "overview": "<p>Cobalion's niche in OU is being is a great Stealth Rock setter and Volt Switch user that is capable of dealing with Bisharp and Mega Gardevoir. Cobalion has a high Defense stat and access to attacks such as Stealth Rock and Volt Switch, allowing it to support its team and gain momentum. It's able to take hits due to its Steel / Fighting typing, which gives it eight resistances as well as an immunity to Poison-type attacks. However, Cobalion has mediocre offensive stats that make it difficult for it to dish out heavy amounts of damage and achieve KOs, so it rather easily handled by common Pokemon. Although Cobalion is only weak to Fighting-, Fire-, and Ground-type attacks, offensive moves of these types are common and thus still manage to cause massive problems for it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance with three attacks is a possibility, as Cobalion's Defense, Speed, and multiple resistances give it opportunities to set up and proceed to sweep. However, Cobalion still suffers from a lack of power and finds difficulty in setting up the multiple boosts that would be required for it to sweep. Stone Edge can be used to hit Pokemon such as Charizard and Talonflame super effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-type Pokemon such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon don't mind switching in against Cobalion and can threaten it out with a STAB Earthquake. If they're predicting the switch, they can also use the chance to set up Stealth Rock; Hippowdon and Gliscor can also use Slack Off and Roost to heal themselves.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-type Pokemon such as Slowbro, Starmie, and Gastrodon can take Iron Head and Close Combat with ease, not to mention they all have access to recovery. Cobalion only has 72 Special Defense, so it doesn't appreciate being hit or crippled by a burn with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, and Chandelure can take Iron Head and Close Combat and retaliate with their STAB Fire-type attacks; however, they have to be wary if they don't know Cobalion's full set, as they do not like being hit by Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Fast Revenge Killers</strong>: Fast revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Heatran, Choice Scarf Keldeo, and Manectric can come in after a teammate has fainted and threaten Cobalion out with their hard-hitting attacks due to Cobalion's mediocre Special Defense. Choice Scarf Heatran can also catch Cobalion off guard if it's played correctly by faking the specially defensive set, as Cobalion will think Heatran is going to switch out.</p>",

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Cobalion's most powerful STAB attack and hits Pokemon such as Bisharp, Kyurem-B, and Tyranitar for super effective damage. Iron Head is a Steel-type STAB move that hits Fairy-types such as Clefable and Mega Gardevoir for super effective damage. Volt Switch allows Cobalion to gain momentum against several of its checks and counters by using it on the turn that they switch in. Taunt is great for crippling common switch-ins such as Mew and Skarmory and preventing Pokemon such as Landorus-T from setting up Stealth Rock. Stealth Rock is useful for damaging Pokemon as they switch in and can be used in the last slot if no other Pokemon on Cobalion's team has room to run it. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple Pokemon that don't mind switching in, such as Mega Charizard X. Hidden Power Ice is another option in the last slot to catch Gliscor and Landorus-T off-guard, as they don't mind taking an Iron Head or Close Combat.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The 144 HP EVs allow Cobalion to survive an Earthquake from Excadrill and take it out with Close Combat while the Attack EVs ensure an OHKO on Mega Gardevoir with Iron Head and 2HKOs on Ferrothorn and specially defensive Heatran with Close Combat after Stealth Rock damage. Leftovers is chosen to keep Cobalion healthy as it switches into foes throughout the match. An alternate EV spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD and a Jolly nature can be run, letting Cobalion tank a Focus Blast from Timid Mega Gardevoir while avoiding the 2HKO from Life Orb Latios's Hidden Power Fire most of the time.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Volt Switch should be used constantly to gain momentum, but be cautious of common Ground-type switch-ins such as Gliscor and Landorus-T, which don't fear Cobalion's attacks if it isn't running Hidden Power Ice; double switches expecting these Pokemon can prove effective. Use Stealth Rock when Pokemon such as Bisharp and Tyranitar are on the field, as they will likely switch out, not wanting to get OHKOed. Bringing in Cobalion on a predicted Dark-type attack can be useful to gain it an Attack boost via Justified and dish out more significant damage, but this can prove risky if the Dark-type attack user is not Bisharp. Cobalion can be unpredictable with Hidden Power Ice and Thunder Wave if you choose to run one of those options, so revealing them too early can throw away the element of surprise against opponents with Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Mega Charizard X.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Landorus-T is an excellent partner, as it's able to check Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Excadrill, and Garchomp, which don't mind switching in on Cobalion. In return, Cobalion is able to remove Bisharp, which Landorus-T doesn't like switching in on due to Defiant; together, these Pokemon form a solid VoltTurn core. Mega Manectric is a great partner as well, being able to check Water-type Pokemon and forming a VoltTurn core with Landorus-T and Cobalion; however, keep in mind that you're stacking two not-so-strong VoltTurn Pokemon together, so Spikes to take advantage of the switches forced by using Volt Switch or other methods of stallbreaking are necessary. Latios keeps Water- and Fire-types in check, particularly Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y, and appreciates Cobalion's ability to check Pokemon such as Bisharp, Mega Gardevoir, and Tyranitar. Psychic-type Pokemon such as Mew and Slowbro also appreciate Cobalion for its ability to deal with Bisharp; Slowbro is also able to cover all of Cobalion's weaknesses by checking Fire- and Ground-type Pokemon and resisting Fighting-type attacks. Mega Latias is a good partner as Cobalion can check the Dark-types that get in its way.</p>"

  "Terrakion": {
    "overview": "<p>Terrakion is one of OU's most fearsome and underrated wallbreakers, and at a quick glance, it isn't difficult to see why. With a respectable Attack stat and extremely high-powered STAB attacks that have phenomenal coverage, Terrakion is an absolute nightmare to switch into. Furthermore, its ability, Justified, makes opponents fear using Dark-type moves multiple times, as Terrakion is able to get a free Attack boost off of these resisted attacks. As a result, Terrakion is a decent check to Weavile, Tyranitar, and Bisharp for offensive teams. Its Speed tier is just enough to revenge kill base 100s, especially the likes of Manaphy, Charizard, Jirachi, and Mega Gardevoir. However, while Terrakion is a menace offensively, its typing and mediocre bulk leave it wanting more in terms of defensive prowess. Being weak to common offensive attacking types, such as Ground, Fairy, Fighting, Water, and Steel, means switching Terrakion in is difficult, even on certain Knock Off users. On top of this, Close Combat's defense drops make it even easier to revenge kill with priority from the likes of Azumarill, Scizor, and Talonflame. Choice Scarf Terrakion lacks the raw firepower to break past the likes of Clefable, Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Landorus-T, while other more powerful sets are easily revenge killed due to their Speed. Nevertheless, even with its downsides, Terrakion proves itself as one of the most devastating wallbreakers in the tier and is a strong choice for most offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Terrakion's movepool is quite shallow, so it struggles to find moves to use outside of its standard sets. Hidden Power Ice targets defensive Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, also preventing Terrakion from taking recoil damage from the former; however, it has very limited uses outside of hitting these targets and, for the most part, you're better off using one of Terrakion's STAB attacks to handle them. A set with a Focus Sash and Stealth Rock can be used to make Terrakion a decent suicide lead.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority from the likes of Azumarill, Breloom, Scizor, and Talonflame can cut Terrakion's sweep short, as Terrakion lacks the bulk to take these hits efficiently and has no priority of its own outside of the weak Quick Attack.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Since Terrakion is in a middling Speed tier, teams with hard-hitting Pokemon such as Alakazam, Latios, Mega Lopunny, Mega Metagross, Mega Diancie, and Serperior can all defeat a weakened Terrakion without a Rock Polish boost. Most Choice Scarf Pokemon have no issue defeating a weakened Terrakion either.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Although shakier checks against a Terrakion with a Swords Dance boost, most physically defensive Pokemon, such as Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and bulky Garchomp, are able to defeat Terrakion in a one-on-one situation; however, both Landorus-T and Garchomp are heavily pressured by the rare Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Mega Medicham</strong>: Mega Medicham is one of the best offensive checks to Terrakion, as it is not 2HKOed by any of Terrakion's moves and can OHKO back with its STAB attacks or pick it off with Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro and Mega Slowbro</strong>: Mega Slowbro fears nothing from Terrakion and can easily OHKO with Scald or Psyshock after any prior damage. Slowbro takes on any Terrakion set, with the exception of Adamant Swords Dance, and can recover any damage by switching out thanks to Regenerator. However, both must be wary of Toxic, which heavily cripples them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Terrakion's most powerful STAB attack, and it heavily damages even Pokemon that resist it and plows through offensive checks. Stone Edge targets the likes of Azumarill, Tornadus-T, Talonflame, and Landorus-T if they attempt to switch in. Rock Slide provides Terrakion with a more accurate Rock-type STAB attack that is better when you're finishing off a weakened target; however, the power difference compared to Stone Edge is extremely noticeable, and it fails to KO certain targets that Stone Edge would. Iron Head lets Terrakion heavily pressure the likes of Clefable without having to rely on the shaky accuracy of Stone Edge. Quick Attack gives Terrakion some form of priority, allowing it to revenge kill a heavily weakened Charizard X or Mega Lopunny. However, even with a Choice Band, the move is extremely weak, and it should only be used when the target is guaranteed to be KOed by it. Earthquake is another option, targeting the likes of Jirachi, Metagross, and Klefki, damaging them a bit more than Close Combat and also not lowering Terrakion's defenses. Unfortunately, Earthquake is a terrible move to be Choice-locked into, as Flying-types and Pokemon with the ability Levitate are immune to it, and it is fairly weak against bulkier walls.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in its Attack stat provides Terrakion with as much physical prowess as possible, and maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows it to outpace base 100 Speed Pokemon and Speed tie with Keldeo. When it has a Choice Band equipped, Terrakion's Attack stat soars to sky-high levels, and it is able to blow past a large portion of the metagame. Justified is Terrakion's only ability and is sometimes situational, but it allows Terrakion to get an Attack boost off a Dark-type move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Terrakion in during the early game, if possible. Thanks to its insane power with a Choice Band, Terrakion is able to heavily weaken most foes, giving teammates an easier time to sweep later on. Unless Terrakion has a guaranteed KO on the opposing Pokemon, try not to leave it on the field after a use of Close Combat, as its defenses become pathetic afterwards. Terrakion is best switched in after a teammate's slow U-turn or Volt Switch, as its mediocre typing prevents it from switching directly into hard-hitting attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Choice Band Terrakion's natural wallbreaking potential, such as Swords Dance Talonflame, Weavile, Mega Scizor, and Mega Lopunny, make good teammates. The last forms a fantastic Fighting-spam core and together they break down each other's checks and counters. Latias and Latios are able to safely switch into Fighting-, Water-, and Ground-type attacks targeted at Terrakion, and Terrakion is able to get a Justified Attack boost from Dark-type attacks aimed at the duo. Grass-types, such as Serperior, Mega Venusaur, and Celebi, are able to defeat the likes of Azumarill, Hippowdon, Slowbro, Suicune, and Landorus-T. Electric-types such as Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Raikou handle Water-types that are able to stomach Terrakion's attacks. Dark-types, such as Bisharp and Weavile, defeat Slowbro and Celebi and pressure Hippowdon and Gliscor. Fairy-types, such as Mega Altaria, Clefable, and Mega Gardevoir, maul physical walls, allowing Terrakion to go wild late game with Close Combat. Magnezone traps and KOes Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn, which can all handle a Terrakion locked into the wrong move. Hazard setters such as Klefki, which can provide speed control with Thunder Wave, Tyranitar, which gives Terrakion a Special Defense boost but shares awful typing synergy with it; and Landorus-T, which help Terrakion achieve OHKOs or 2HKOs it could not normally get.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance is Terrakion's main setup move, boosting its Attack to sky-high levels. This allows Terrakion to blow through general checks, especially the likes of Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Garchomp. Close Combat is an extremely high-powered STAB move that tears apart Pokemon that do not resist it. Stone Edge provides fantastic neutral coverage with Close Combat, nailing Flying-types, such as Tornadus-T and Talonflame, if they attempt to switch in. Substitute prevents status from the likes of Thundurus, and Klefki, which can give Terrakion an opportunity to sweep. On the other hand, Rock Polish boosts Terrakion's Speed to astronomical levels, allowing it to easily outpace the entire unboosted metagame. Stealth Rock is another possibility, used to wear down Pokemon as they switch in, and Terrakion can set it up on a predicted switch. Quick Attack is a final option that gives Terrakion some form of priority and picks off faster, weakened targets. However, it is extremely weak, even at +2.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Terrakion's Attack and Speed stats with a Jolly nature lets it hit as hard as possible and outpace base 100 Speed Pokemon, such as Charizard, Manaphy, and Gardevoir, while Speed tying with Keldeo and other Terrakion. An Adamant nature can be used over Jolly, allowing Terrakion at +2 to OHKO Hippowdon, Calm Mind Manaphy, defensive Garchomp, Slowbro, and Gliscor. Sadly, missing out on outspeeding opposing base 100 Speed Pokemon, which often run maximum Speed and a positive nature, is a huge thorn in Terrakion's side, leaving Jolly as the preferred nature for the majority of the time. Life Orb is the best item for Terrakion, sacrificing a small amount of HP each turn while providing a significant increase to attacking prowess. Justified is Terrakion's only ability, and it is useful when Terrakion is hit by a Dark-type move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Instead of setting up with Swords Dance turn one, Terrakion's best play early-game is to use Close Combat or Stone Edge. This whittles down defensive walls very quickly, allowing Terrakion to muscle through them with Swords Dance-boosted attacks later. Against offensive teams, boosting Attack isn't as important as blowing through frailer Pokemon with its dual STAB combination, as most of such teams will have a solid way to defeat Terrakion due to its questionable Speed. When using Close Combat, be wary of the defense drops that come along with it. Lowering Terrakion's mediocre defenses even further makes it extremely vulnerable to priority from the likes of Azumarill, Scizor, and Talonflame and to revenge killers, such as Latios, Mega Manectric, Mega Metagross, and most Choice Scarf users. Terrakion is best switched in through a slow U-turn or Volt Switch from a teammate, as predicting wrong is very costly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Terrakion has very limited switch-ins, and the majority of them, particularly the likes of Celebi and Slowbro, are heavily pressured by various Dark-type Pokemon, such as Weavile and Bisharp. Latios and Latias appreciate Terrakion's ability to check Tyranitar and Bisharp, and, in return, the duo is able to defeat most bulky Ground- and Water-types that threaten Terrakion. Grass-types, such as Serperior, Mega Venusaur, and Celebi, pressure Ground- and Water-types with their respective STAB attacks. Fairy-types, such as Mega Altaria, Clefable, and Mega Gardevoir, can also break down physical walls such as Garchomp and Hippowdon. Magnezone traps Mega Scizor and Skarmory, the former being difficult for certain offensive teams to properly handle, allowing Terrakion to bust through the opposing team once they are eliminated.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Terrakion's most devastating move and, even without a boosting item, tears through weakened Pokemon that don't resist it. However, it comes with the cost of lowering Terrakion's defenses after its use. Stone Edge provides phenomenal coverage with Close Combat, targeting Flying-, Ghost-, and Psychic types, especially the likes of Talonflame, Latios, Mega Charizard Y, and Tornadus-T. Rock Slide provides Terrakion with a more accurate way of finishing off weakened targets and does not have the nasty side effect of lowering its defenses. However, the power drop between this and Terrakion's other options is quite noticeable. On the other hand, Toxic cripples bulky walls, such as Hippowdon, Slowbro, Garchomp, and Landorus-T, as they switch in to handle an attack. Iron Head gives Terrakion a way to deal heavy damage to Fairy-types, doing decent damage to Clefable, OHKOing Mega Diancie, and OHKOing Mega Gardevoir after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment allows Terrakion to deal as much damage as possible. A Choice Scarf lets Terrakion outspeed the unboosted metagame and revenge kill Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Mega Lopunny, and +1 Mega Charizard X, and maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows it to stay in its crucial Speed tier if it happens to lose its Choice Scarf to Knock Off. Justified is Terrakion's only ability and gives Terrakion an attack boost if it is hit by a Dark-type move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When using Terrakion late-game to clean up, make sure you don't overestimate its firepower. While its moves have high Base Power, sometimes even such power isn't enough to KO a target. Make sure everything is weakened to a degree that Terrakion can break past it. Terrakion serves as a fantastic revenge killer to certain Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Tyranitar and Jirachi, as well as most Dragon Dance users. This includes Dragonite, a weakened Mega Altaria, and Mega Charizard X. Terrakion's already mediocre defenses are lowered even further by Close Combat's drops, so if the opponent has a powerful priority user such as Scizor or Azumarill, be wary of mindlessly clicking it. Although Terrakion has access to Justified, switching directly in to Knock Off is generally an unfavorable play; due to the nature of offensive teams, Terrakion desperately wants to keep its Choice Scarf to be able to outspeed otherwise faster Pokemon. When pinned up against the likes of Landorus-T and Slowbro, catch them on the switch with Toxic to cripple them. Just beware that locking Terrakion into Toxic means it can be taken advantage of.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-types, such as Serperior, Mega Venusaur, and Celebi, break down the likes of Hippowdon, Azumarill, Quagsire, and Suicune, which are all decent checks to Terrakion. Latios and Latias provide Defog support, and Healing Wish support in the latter's case, and check Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-types for Terrakion. In return, Terrakion handily defeats Bisharp and Tyranitar. Water-types, such as Manaphy, Azumarill, and Starmie, handle Ground-types that Choice Scarf Terrakion might not have the power to break through before they are weakened. Fairy-types, such as Clefable, and Mega Gardevoir, hit physical walls hard with their respective STAB attacks and break down Terrakion's answers such as Slowbro. Dark-types such as Bisharp and Weavile pressure defensive walls, such as Garchomp and Hippowdon, early on, so that Terrakion has an easier time defeating them. Magnezone traps Mega Scizor and Skarmory, as Terrakion lacks the power to defeat them if they are near full health.</p>"

  "Tornadus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>With a great Speed tier, powerful Flying-type STAB move in Hurricane, and abundance of coverage and utility moves to choose from, Tornadus-T has all of the tools necessary to be a top-tier Pokemon in ORAS OU. Tornadus-T’s upsides don’t end there, however. It was also gifted one of the best abilities in the game in Regenerator, making it one of the few Pokemon that can effectively utilize Assault Vest. The combination of Regenerator and Assault Vest, plus its access to U-turn, makes Tornadus-T one of the best pivots in the metagame. However, although Tornadus-T’s mono-Flying typing gives it a few crucial immunities and resistances, it is also one of Tornadus-T’s greatest impediments. With Stealth Rock taking away 25% of its HP every time it switches in, Tornadus-T can quickly get overwhelmed by the Pokemon it is supposed to check.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Air Slash is an option on the Assault Vest set if you want a more accurate Flying-type STAB move; the huge drop in power is usually not worth it, however. Icy Wind has some merit, since it drops the foe's Speed. The only reason to run Ice-type coverage on Tornadus-T is to check Gliscor, though, and Icy Wind is not a guaranteed 2HKO. Focus Blast can be used over Superpower, but it is much less consistent due to its lower accuracy. On top of that, the Pokemon that you want to hit with your Fighting-type coverage are generally bulkier on the special side, such as Chansey, Heatran, and Tyranitar, so Superpower does more to them. LO Tornadus-T can also be used with Hurricane and Superpower along with Knock Off and Taunt but it is not recommended in the current meta.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos is probably the best counter to Tornadus-T, as it resists the majority of Tornadus-T's attacks and can recover any damage taken with Roost. Rotom-W can switch into Tornadus-T and can get a slow Volt Switch off against it or threaten it with a Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave. Rotom-W does not appreciate its item being removed by Knock Off, however, as Leftovers is its only form of recovery outside of Pain Split. Thundurus is a Pokemon that can offensively check Tornadus-T, as it naturally resists Tornadus-T's STAB move and U-turn. It must be wary of Hidden Power Ice and Knock Off, though.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Many Steel-types can check Tornadus-T if it lacks the proper coverage move to hit them. Heatran can check all non-Superpower variants of Tornadus-T, as it resists both Hurricane and U-turn. Heatran's only form of recovery is Leftovers, however, so once it gets hit by Knock Off, it is very easy to wear down. Specially defensive Skarmory is able to switch into Assault Vest Tornadus-T if it lacks Heat Wave. Specially defensive Jirachi is one of the best answers to Tornadus-T, as it is naturally bulky and has access to Wish, which allows it to stay healthy. Choice Scarf Jirachi can also revenge kill Tornadus-T fairly reliably. Lastly, Mega Metagross can check all Tornadus-T variants, as Heat Wave only has a small chance to 2HKO it, and its Ice Punch and Thunder Punch both have an almost certain chance to OHKO Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Tyranitar is able to switch into non-Superpower Tornadus-T and threaten it out with its Rock-type STAB moves, although U-turn will quickly wear it down. Tyranitar also has the option to Pursuit trap Tornadus-T. Mega Diancie can switch into Tornadus-T a couple of times and threaten it out with Diamond Storm. Mega Aerodactyl is a Pokemon that can switch into all of Tornadus-T's attacks and recover off the damage with or threaten it with a powerful Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon that are not weak to Tornadus-T's coverage such as Clefable, Gliscor, Slowking, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon can all switch into non-offensive Tornadus-T and heal off the damage with their recovery moves. These Pokemon will get shut down by the rare Taunt Tornadus-T, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Weavile, Mega Manectric, Sand Rush Excadrill, and some Choice Scarf Pokemon can outspeed and revenge kill Tornadus-T. Most of these Pokemon can not switch into Tornadus-T's attacks, however. Weavile is a Pokemon worth highlighting for its ability to Pursuit trap Tornadus-T.</p>",

      "Assault Vest Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hurricane provides Tornadus-T with a strong Flying-type STAB move, allowing it to hit Pokemon such as Serperior and Keldeo hard. The second moveslot is very team dependent. Heat Wave allows Tornadus-T to hit Pokemon such as Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, and other Steel-types hard and is generally the best option. Superpower allows Tornadus-T to threaten Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Heatran. Hidden Power Ice can be used if your team needs a back-up check to Gliscor and hits Garchomp and Landorus-T harder than Hurricane would, but it is usually the least useful of the three options. If your team is weak to Mega Charizard Y or Volcarona, Smack Down is an option that allows Tornadus-T to hit them for super effective damage. This is usually not recommended, though, as Smack Down is very weak and Tornadus-T’s ability to check Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona with it is shaky at best. For its final two moveslots, Knock Off and U-turn are both mandatory for Tornadus-T. Knock Off allows Tornadus-T to cripple its switch-ins by removing their item, while U-turn lets Tornadus-T gain momentum and make use of its wonderful ability in Regenerator.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Assault Vest allows Tornadus-T to check common special attackers such as Keldeo, Serperior, and Latios. 252 Speed EVs with a Speed-boosting nature allows Tornadus-T to outspeed Pokemon such as Starmie, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Serperior, and the rare Alakazam. When running Superpower, a Jolly nature can be used to guarantee that Tornadus-T can get the OHKO against no bulk Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and deal more damage to Pokemon such as Heatran and Excadrill. When running Hidden Power Ice, a spread of 144 HP / 148 SpA / 216 Spe is recommended with a Timid nature, allowing Tornadus-T to 2HKO Gliscor with Hidden Power Ice while still outspeeding Choice Scarf Tyranitar and keeping as much bulk as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tornadus-T should be used as a pivot against common special attackers such as Keldeo and Latios. When Stealth Rock is not on the field, Tornadus-T can switch into these Pokemon pretty freely thanks to its incredible special bulk with an Assault Vest and its ability Regenerator. When Stealth Rock is set, however, Tornadus-T must be much more careful. For example, after Stealth Rock damage, Mega Alakazam is able to 2HKO Tornadus-T with Psychic, and Choice Specs Latios has a slight chance to OHKO Tornadus-T with Draco Meteor. Choice Specs Keldeo is also able to muscle through Tornadus-T with either Hydro Pump or Scald after a couple of switch ins.</p> <p>If Tornadus-T does not have any significant defensive value versus your opponent's team, you can make use of its access to Knock Off to remove items from Pokemon such as Heatran, Clefable, and Rotom-W, crippling them for the rest of the game and opening up doors for Tornadus-T's teammates. All three of the aforementioned Pokemon can carry status moves, though, so you must carefully weigh the risk of getting inflicted by status in return for removing an item.</p> <p>During battle, it is often best to switch Tornadus-T into a Pokemon that it checks and then use U-turn to gain momentum and gauge your opponent's reaction to Tornadus-T or Knock Off to punish your opponent's switch-in. Hurricane, since it can be a big momentum killer early- to mid-game, should usually only be used late-game when your opponent's team is weakened or in a scenario where it is too risky to use U-turn or Knock Off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Assault Vest Tornadus-T fits well on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its ability to sponge special attacks and maintain offensive momentum. Bulky Ground-types such as TankChomp, Gliscor, and Hippowdon pair well with Tornadus-T, as all three are able to switch into Tyranitar and are immune to Electric-type attacks, and the former two are also able to switch into Heatran, while Tornadus-T is able to tank hits from strong Water- and Grass-types such as Keldeo and Serperior. Gastrodon is also worth mentioning for its ability to wall all of the relevant Electric-types in the tier. Excadrill is also a good partner, as it is able to remove Stealth Rock and switch into Pokemon such as Clefable. Strong Water- and Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Azumarill, and Mega Medicham can take advantage of some of Tornadus-T's common checks and appreciate the safe switches that it gives them. Clefable is a solid partner, as it is able to switch into Pokemon that force Tornadus-T out such as Weavile and Choice Scarf Tyranitar, as well as Rotom-W and Zapdos. Clefable also appreciates Tornadus-T removing the items from Pokemon such as Heatran and Excadrill. Similarly, Serperior appreciates Tornadus-T's ability to remove Heatran's item, and it is also able to switch into and threaten Pokemon such as Rotom-W. Lastly, strong Steel-types such as Mega Metagross and Mega Scizor are able to take advantage of Tornadus-T pivoting out versus Clefable, and the latter also appreciates Tornadus-T's ability to remove the items from Pokemon such as Heatran and Rotom-W.</p>"

      "Taunt": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Taunt allows Tornadus-T to prevent entry hazards from setters like Garchomp, Heatran, and Clefable; recovery and status from Pokemon like Clefable, Serperior, and Chansey; and setup attempts from Pokemon such as Dragonite and Cloyster. U-turn is used to grab momentum, allowing a teammate to come in more safely especially on a target afflicted by Taunt; it also allows Tornadus-T to safely bring in Pokemon that don't like taking hits often such as Mega Medicham. Knock Off allows Tornadus-T to wear down foes by removing items such as Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from targets such as Clefable and Garchomp. Lastly, despite its low accuracy, Hurricane's power combined with Tornadus-T's high Special Attack stat makes it a threatening option, especially in conjunction with its confusion chance. Air Slash can be run as an alternative for higher accuracy, but the loss of power means Tornadus-T can't threaten OHKOs on Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Serperior, and Mega Medicham.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs maximize Tornadus-T's bulk, exacerbated further by its ability, Regenerator. Maximum Speed EVs let Tornadus-T outrun most of the unboosted metagame, allowing it to get off a fast Taunt against most setup sweepers and entry hazard setters. Rocky Helmet forces chip damage onto physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Taunt Tornadus-T has to be wary when facing strong special hits from Mega Alakazam, Keldeo, and Volcarona. Tornadus-T can often be used as a lead, since it can prevent early Stealth Rock with Taunt, spread Knock Off, or use a fast U-turn into a teammate with a better matchup against the foe. Tornadus-T can come in multiple times a game especially on contact attacks to spread chip damage with Rocky Helmet and its moves while being able to sustain itself with recovery from Regenerator. When using Tornadus-T, be wary of threats like Weavile, which outspeeds and can OHKO Tornadus-T, and Choice Band Tyranitar, which can Pursuit trap and OHKO it after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates like Volcarona and Dragonite appreciate Tornadus-T's ability to prevent entry hazards. Defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W benefit from Tornadus-T's ability to deny setup attempts, thus making it easier to perform their role in defensively checking foes; they also form a VoltTurn core that allows for easy pivoting. Additionally, Rotom-W and Tornadus-T both beat each other's checks, since Rotom-W checks threats like Mega Metagross that otherwise wall and take advantage of Tornadus-T, while Tornadus-T checks Grass-types such as Serperior and Mega Venusaur that otherwise take advantage of Rotom-W. Excadrill is also a good teammate due to its access to Rapid Spin, which allows it to support Tornadus-T by removing Stealth Rock from the field. This is aided further by Excadrill's Rock resistance and Electric immunity, two of Tornadus-T's biggest weaknesses; in return, Tornadus-T supports Excadrill with its Fighting resistance and ability to take on the Grass-types that otherwise take advantage of it. Lastly, wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham and Choice Specs Keldeo appreciate Tornadus-T preventing recovery attempts from defensive Pokemon such as Clefable and Mega Latias, since with Taunt, Tornadus-T is able to check their common checks.</p>"

  "Thundurus": {
    "overview": "<p>Thundurus is one of the top offensive threats in modern ORAS. It outspeeds a majority of the OU tier given that it lies just above the crucial base 110 Speed tier. Its unique typing and decent bulk make it a decent pivot against common metagame staples such as Excadrill, Serperior, and Tornadus-T. It also has access to both Thunder Wave and Knock Off, two great tools that disrupt both defensive and offensive teams. Prankster Thunder Wave allows Thundurus to act as an emergency check to sweepers and faster threats, giving it valuable utility for offensive teams. Thundurus also has access to Nasty Plot, making it a powerful sweeper. Finally, it has access to Focus Blast, making it one of the few Electric-types that can punish Excadrill and Ferrothorn. Unfortunately, Thundurus has no recovery moves and is weak to Stealth Rock, making it hard to preserve throughout the match. Furthermore, it doesn't learn powerful or reliable Flying-type moves such as Hurricane and Air Slash.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A mixed offensive set with Defiant is old but still viable. Superpower and Knock Off are surprise coverage moves that hit some of Thundurus's typical checks hard, especially after a +2 boost from Defog. Grass Knot and Hidden Power Flying are two very notable coverage moves on Thundurus, especially the Nasty Plot set, as they can aid it in getting past common counters such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Mega Venusaur. It is also worth to note that Rocky Helmet can still be used on the Nasty Plot set, as it provides chip damage on Fake Out users and can let Thundurus bluff a Thunder Wave set better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, Seismitoad, and Nidoking are immune to Thundurus's STAB moves and Thunder Wave, making them good natural checks to it. These Pokemon in particular do not take much damage from Hidden Power Ice or Focus Blast and can often threaten Thundurus with status or a KO.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, Serperior, and Assault Vest Tangrowth resist Thundurus's STAB moves and avoid the 2HKO from Hidden Power Ice or Focus Blast. Mega Venusaur is one of its best counters, as Thick Fat allows it to take very little damage from Hidden Power Ice. Serperior is notable because it is one of the Pokemon that outspeeds Thundurus, while Tangrowth can continuously check Thundurus due to Regenerator. Amoonguss's Clear Smog neutralizes the Special Attack raise from Nasty Plot even if another Pokemon is already asleep and Amoonguss can't use Spore.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Chansey, specially defensive Clefable, and Heatran are great pivots versus Thundurus. However, they can get overwhelmed by Stealth Rock and Volt Switch chip damage over the course of the battle, not to mention that Knock Off or Taunt is usually devastating for them.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Dragon-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Latias, Latios, and Mega Charizard X resist Thundurus's STAB moves and avoid getting OHKOed from Hidden Power Ice or Focus Blast. However, these Pokemon are often beaten by the Nasty Plot set, and they do not appreciate paralysis.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunder Wave, alongside Prankster, makes Thundurus a very strong disruptive and anti-offense tool. Hidden Power Ice hits bulky Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Gliscor, Grass-types such as Serperior and Amoonguss, and Dragon-types such as Latias and Garchomp. Focus Blast hits Pokemon that resist Electric and take little damage from Hidden Power Ice, such as Excadrill, Ferrothorn, Quagsire, and Kyurem-B. Volt Switch provides the team with momentum, allowing Thundurus to chip its counters such as Chansey and Clefable while pivoting into a teammate that can threaten them out immediately. With how prevalent Stealth Rock is and how hard it is to get it off, Volt Switch is the preferred STAB move over Thunderbolt, as it accumulates more damage throughout the game with all the momentum it grabs with Stealth Rock up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Prankster gives Thundurus priority Thunder Wave, allowing it act as an emergency check to sweepers and faster threats. Leftovers is the chosen item on Thundurus over the traditional Life Orb because it mitigates Thundurus's weakness to Stealth Rock and provides longevity. Rocky Helmet is an alternative that indirectly increases Thundurus's damage, and it can be used to chip Pokemon going for weak moves such as U-turn, Rapid Spin, and Fake Out. The given spread with a Timid enables Thundurus to threaten base 110 Speed Pokemon effectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thundurus's unique coverage of both Hidden Power Ice and Focus Blast allows it to bypass the most commonly used Ground-types, mainly Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. Thunder Wave should be used against sweepers that can otherwise sweep your team, such as Volcarona, Mega Charizard X, and Serperior. With another Volt Switch or U-turn user, Thundurus can initiate momentum loops that can create a lot of passive damage on the enemy team, especially with Stealth Rock up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Thundurus fits well on offensive teams, as it provides both offensive pressure and utility in Prankster Thunder Wave. Thundurus thrives with teammates that can create VoltTurn cores with its own Volt Switch, such as Mega Scizor and Landorus-T with U-turn and Rotom-W with Volt Switch. Pokemon such as Serperior, Clefable, and Latios that can take advantage of bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad are greatly appreciated. Strong Stealth Rock setters that can keep Stealth Rock on the enemy's side of the field such as Garchomp and Landorus-T are also great, as they can elevate Thundurus's pressure with Stealth Rock's constant presence.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Prankster Thunder Wave enables Thundurus to cripple faster attackers and sweepers, especially in ORAS where paralysis is a 75% Speed reduction. Hidden Power Ice allows Thundurus to 2HKO many common Ground-types, even without Special Attack investment, including Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor. Knock Off provides further utility by removing important items such as Leftovers from common switch-ins such as Hippowdon, Excadrill, and Clefable. Focus Blast is an alternative that can still 2HKO Excadrill even without Special Attack investment. Taunt enables Thundurus to disrupt both its defensive and offensive answers, especially with Prankster. Volt Switch takes advantage of Thundurus's ability to force doubles to give its teammates safe switch ins.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Prankster gives Thundurus priority Thunder Wave and Taunt, allowing it to be a great disrupter of both defensive and offensive teams. Rocky Helmet is the preferred item, as it reduces Thundurus's passivity that it can suffer from a lack of Special Attack investment. However, Leftovers is still a valid option, as it maximizes Thundurus's longevity and mitigates its Stealth Rock weakness. The given spread maximizes Thundurus's overall bulk while letting it survive Mega Lopunny's combination of Fake Out and Return. This allows Thundurus to pivot into Mega Lopunny multiple times throughout the game if timed correctly. Maximum Speed with a Timid nature is used to outspeed base 110s such as Mega Diancie and Mega Metagross.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thundurus's unique typing, decent bulk, and access to Prankster Thunder Wave enable it to be a great blanket check to many offensive threats that are susceptible to paralysis. Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Mega Charizard X, Mega Altaria, and Weavile often have to switch out from Thundurus despite being able to OHKO it out of fear from getting paralyzed by Prankster Thunder Wave. Knock Off is a great tool to cripple the enemy team slowly, especially early-game. Thundurus is often a great lead, but be sure to preserve it as much as possible to maintain its ability to provide speed control and an emergency Thunder Wave.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Thundurus fits well on both offensive teams and bulky offensive teams. Most teams appreciate Prankster Thunder Wave, especially ones that are susceptible to getting swept. Pokemon that can reliably remove Stealth Rock from the field, such as Rapid Spin Excadrill and Defog Latias, are greatly appreciated, as they can extend Thundurus's longevity. Pokemon that can cover Thundurus's weakness to Rock- and Ice-type attacks, such as Keldeo, Bisharp, and Mega Metagross, are great partners.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot allows Thundurus to become an immediate threat, allowing it to OHKO or 2HKO most of the metagame. Hidden Power Ice hits bulky Ground-types such as Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. After a Nasty Plot boost, it can 2HKO many of Thundurus's checks such as Hippowdon, Latias, and Amoonguss. Focus Blast provides great damage on Electric-resistant foes such as Excadrill, Ferrothorn, Gastrodon, Mega Charizard X, and Kyurem-B. Thunderbolt is the preferred STAB option, as it provides the most consistent damage, especially because Volt Switch results in removing the Nasty Plot boosts.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Prankster is still the preferred ability on Thundurus even without Thunder Wave, as Thunder Wave can still be bluffed before the Nasty Plot reveal. Alternatively, Defiant can bluff a mixed offensive set, which can be used to Thundurus's advantage if timed correctly on a Defog. Leftovers is the preferred item to provide Thundurus with longevity, allowing it to possibly set up Nasty Plot more than once per game. Life Orb is still a strong option, as it turns Thundurus to a powerful nuke, especially after Nasty Plot. Many of its near OHKOs, such as those on Serperior and Latios, become guaranteed with the additional Life Orb boost. The given spread with a Timid nature allows Thundurus to be as fast and powerful as possible, taking full advantage of its base 111 Speed and making it harder to revenge kill.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against slower teams, Thundurus can find opportunities to set up on more passive Pokemon, such as utility Excadrill and Ferrothorn, to attempt to punch holes in the enemy team composition. Against more offensive teams, it is more advisable for Thundurus to not set up and simply focus on attacking, as this proves to be more effective at disrupting the opposing team's strategy, and it can maintain the Thunder Wave bluff for as long as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Nasty Plot Thundurus is mostly used on offensive teams that can create momentum and double down on the holes in the enemy team Thundurus can often create. Nasty Plot Thundurus is much easier to revenge kill than Thunder Wave variants, so teammates that can switch in on strong threats such as Weavile and Mega Lopunny are great. Pokemon that can get timely entry hazard removal, such as Rapid Spin Excadrill and Defog Latias, are also appreciated. Latias in particular also has access to Healing Wish, which can synergize well with Nasty Plot Thundurus, giving it a second chance to sweep after trading its health to weaken the enemy team.</p>"

  "Thundurus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Thundurus-T is a unique Pokemon in the OU metagame, blessed with access to two exceptional boosting moves in Nasty Plot and Agility. These moves, complemented by Thundurus-T's massive Special Attack stat, allow it to blow through a variety of teams with little effort. Thundurus-T also has decent typing for an offensive sweeper, resisting two forms of priority in Brave Bird and Bullet Punch, as well as having an immunity to Ground-type attacks. Volt Absorb allows it to switch into Electric-type attacks from Pokemon such as Magnezone, Rotom-W, and opposing Thundurus and regain some of its health in the process. Residing in a decent Speed tier, Thundurus-T outspeeds opposing base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Charizard, Manaphy, Mega Gardevoir, and Jirachi without having to resort to using Agility beforehand.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Thundurus-T is highly vulnerable to residual damage, especially Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock, with no reliable recovery outside of Volt Absorb and possibly Leftovers. Thundurus-T also has subpar bulk, struggling to take even powerful resisted hits, such as Choice Specs Keldeo's Secret Sword, meaning every attempt to switch it in is a gamble.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thundurus-T has the option to run a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs set with Volt Switch, although it's generally inferior to both the Agility and Double Dance sets, as Pokemon such as Raikou can arguably do the job better. Expert Belt is an option to hit harder with super effective attacks without having to take Life Orb recoil; however, Thundurus-T loses power on non-super effective attacks. Thundurus-T can effectively use Knock Off to cripple Latias, Latios, and Chansey, as usually, only Thundurus carries this. A Yache Berry can be used for a one-time neutrality to Ice-type attacks, helping it survive a possible Ice Shard or Hidden Power Ice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, Quagsire, Seismitoad, and Garchomp give Thundurus-T a hard time, especially if it's not carrying Hidden Power Ice or Grass Knot, thanks to their immunity to its main STAB move. They can also wear down Thundurus-T using Toxic or Sandstorm.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey is a hard stop to sets that don't use both Nasty Plot and Focus Blast. It is able to wear Thundurus-T down with Toxic and Seismic Toss while being able to recover any lost health with Soft-Boiled.</p> <p><strong>Latios and Latias</strong>: Latios and Latias can take Thundurus-T's STAB moves and most coverage moves well thanks to their decent natural bulk, outspeed it before an Agility, and OHKO it in return with Draco Meteor. They must remain wary of the rare Knock Off, however.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers such as Mamoswine, Mega Manectric, and Sucker Punch abusers such as Bisharp can come in after a teammate has been sacrificed and force Thundurus-T out.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Residual damage from things such as burn, Toxic, Stealth Rock, Sandstorm, and Life Orb leaves Thundurus-T vulnerable to priority moves or revenge killing and can drastically reduce its time on the field, thanks to its lack of reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Bulky attackers such as Assault Vest Conkeldurr, Assault Vest Goodra, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Mega Venusaur can beat Thundurus-T one-on-one. They can easily stomach any attack it can throw at them and respond by wearing it down or, in some cases, outright KOing it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Agility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Agility boosts Thundurus-T's Speed stat by two stages, allowing it to outspeed the entire metagame, including common Choice Scarf users. Thunderbolt is Thundurus-T's most reliable STAB move, dealing heavy damage to most Pokemon that don't resist it, thanks to its high Special Attack. Focus Blast is used for super effective coverage against bulky Steel-type Pokemon that take little damage from Thunderbolt, such as Ferrothorn and Heatran, as well as Tyranitar. Hidden Power Ice hits bulky Ground-type Pokemon that are immune to Thundurus-T's main STAB move, such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon. Hidden Power Flying is another option that not only is a reliable secondary STAB move but also can also hit bulky Grass-type Pokemon such as Celebi, Mega Venusaur, and Chesnaught harder than Hidden Power Ice. Grass Knot can be used to hit Seismitoad, Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Hippowdon harder than Hidden Power Ice, but it misses out on hitting Garchomp and Gliscor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment into Special Attack allows Thundurus-T to hit as hard as possible, and complemented by a Modest nature, this gives Thundurus-T the ability to break down even the sturdiest of walls. However, a Timid nature with maximum Speed investment allows Thundurus-T to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Charizard, Manaphy, and Jirachi before an Agility boost, although this option is generally inferior to a Modest nature because, thanks to Agility's Speed boost, these situations will rarely come into play in the first place and a Modest nature allows Thundurus-T to wallbreak more easily. Leftovers gives Thundurus-T passive recovery and can mitigate residual damage to a certain degree. Conversely, while Life Orb gives Thundurus-T slight recoil for each damaging attack, the extra power allows it to KO Kyurem-B with Focus Blast and specially defensive Gliscor with Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thundurus-T works as an excellent late-game cleaner thanks to its good coverage and power, being able to easily get to +2 on Pokemon such as Magnezone, specially defensive Talonflame, and Skarmory. This being stated, Thundurus-T appreciates its checks and counters, such as Seismitoad, Gastrodon, and Mega Venusaur, weakened before attempting to sweep, as Thundurus-T will rarely get a second opportunity to sweep due to its frailty. Use Volt Absorb to its advantage, allowing Thundurus-T to switch into attacks such as Choice Specs Raikou's Thunderbolt and regain a small amount of health. If the opponent has a Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon or Garchomp, be aware that they can freely switch into Thundurus-T's main STAB move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A Defogger or a spinner is a necessity to keep Thundurus-T healthy, as Stealth Rock deals a nasty 25% each time Thundurus-T switches in, drastically cutting its longevity. Excadrill not only clears Stealth Rock but also can pressure Assault Vest Raikou and loves having Thundurus-T's coverage to beat bulky Water-types, as well as Landorus-T and Garchomp if running Hidden Power Ice. Latios and Latias can clear away entry hazards, while Latias offers Thundurus-T a second chance at sweeping with Healing Wish. Powerful Fighting-type Pokemon such as Keldeo and Conkeldurr can handle Chansey, which threatens Thundurus-T without Focus Blast, easily forcing it out. Partners that can pressure bulky Ground-type Pokemon, such as Serperior and Keldeo, can help Thundurus-T break through the opponent's team. To take advantage of opposing Latios and Latias, Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Bisharp can Pursuit trap them, severely damaging them or outright KOing them. Talonflame is able to handle Mega Venusaur thanks to its high-powered Flying-type STAB moves, while Thundurus-T can absorb Electric-type attacks aimed at Talonflame. Klefki can easily switch into Weavile while also providing Spikes support, giving Thundurus-T an easier time when attempting to sweep.</p>"

      "Double Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Agility gives Thundurus-T the ability to outspeed entire offensive teams, dealing fair damage without needing the +2 Special Attack. Conversely, Nasty Plot allows it to easily plow through the majority of defensive teams, because it has the Speed stat to outspeed most defensive Pokemon. Thunderbolt is Thundurus-T's most reliable STAB move, dealing heavy damage to targets that don't resist it. Hidden Power Ice allows Thundurus-T to hit bulky Ground- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. Focus Blast is an option over Hidden Power Ice, but it is generally an inferior choice due to its lower accuracy, fewer PP, and worse coverage, because Thundurus-T can no longer hit Pokemon such as Gliscor for respectable damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment gives Thundurus-T as much power as possible behind its special attacks, and with a Modest nature, Thundurus-T gains even more wallbreaking power, even 2HKOing Chansey at +2 with Focus Blast after Stealth Rock damage. However, running a Timid nature allows Thundurus-T to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon before using Agility; nevertheless, Modest is generally the preferred nature, due to Agility raising Thundurus-T's Speed anyway. Leftovers is used for passive recovery, as well as slightly mitigating Stealth Rock damage, but a Lum Berry can be used to cure Toxic and burn, helping cure residual damage from status.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Keep in mind that Thundurus-T generally will not need both a Special Attack and Speed boost to be efficient. Nasty Plot is the more useful boost against bulkier teams, while, thanks to Thundurus-T's fantastic Special Attack stat, Agility is more useful for breaking apart weakened offensive teams. Thundurus-T can use its ability to switch in to Pokemon Choice-locked into an Electric-type move, such as Magnezone and Raikou, giving it more opportunities to set up freely while also having the chance to recover a small amount of HP, slightly negating residual damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Thundurus-T needs entry hazard removal to keep it healthy, as Stealth Rock deals 25% damage upon each switch in, cutting its health quickly. Excadrill can clear Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin, as well as pressuring Raikou, while Starmie can also clear Stealth Rock and beats Heatran. Fighting-type Pokemon such as Gallade, Keldeo, and Terrakion can deal with Chansey, Ferrothorn, and Heatran if Thundurus-T is not running Focus Blast. Mega Sceptile, Serperior, and Gyarados can help deal with bulky Ground-type Pokemon that would otherwise give this set trouble without Hidden Power Ice. Pursuit trappers such as Bisharp and Tyranitar can easily remove Latias and Latios, making it easier for Thundurus-T to sweep. Klefki offers Spikes support, damaging Thundurus-T's checks when they switch in, giving it an easier time when attempting a sweep.</p>"

  "Landorus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Landorus-T proves itself to be one of the OU metagame's premier bulky Ground-types due to its great typing, access to U-turn, and Intimidate support. It functions as a pivot, thus providing momentum and controlling the tempo of the match, while also functioning as an all-around blanket check to many physical threats in the tier such as Mega Lopunny, Excadrill, Mega Charizard X, and Tyranitar. It can set up Stealth Rock pretty comfortably, as its high Attack stat prevents many threats from coming in freely regardless of how defensive the set you run may be. Its wide movepool consisting of great options such as Swords Dance, Explosion, Knock Off, and Rock Polish also makes it a threat in many different ways; for example, it's a great Choice Scarf user filling the role of revenge killer and can also work as setup sweeper. However, Landorus-T faces competition from Hippowdon and Garchomp as a Ground-type, with the former being able to utilize Sand Stream along with its superior bulk and defensive typing and the latter being able to spread passive chip damage through Rough Skin + Rocky Helmet. Its lack of reliable recovery outside of Leftovers also leaves it relatively low on HP to manage various threats on the opponent's team, especially if you don't play cautiously. Lastly, Landorus-T packs weaknesses to Ice- and Water-type moves, meaning it cannot set up Stealth Rock without inviting the likes of Kyurem-B, Manaphy, and Keldeo in.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A lead Focus Sash set can be considered for surprising Ice-types and other annoying leads that want to prevent Landorus-T from getting up Stealth Rock; normally when this item is used Landorus-T carries Explosion to prevent Defog after getting up Stealth Rock. Normal Gem + Explosion has a niche on teams with offensive Flying-type cores, as it can weaken Rotom-W and bulky Ground-types. Gravity is a nice equivalent to Smack Down because they basically do the same thing, limiting Skarmory and Rotom-W switch-ins. Gravity can be chosen over Smack Down because it is active, for five turns which another teammate can also advantage of; however, it also could benefit your opponent, as it makes every move 100% accurate. Substitute paired with Bulk Up or Swords Dance could make Landorus-T a good setup sweeper that can avoid status while breaking teams; such a set could also carry Salac Berry to clean late-game.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Landorus-T cannot threaten most Water-types, while they can force it out with their STAB moves. Some examples include Keldeo, Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Manaphy.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Weavile, Mamoswine, and Kyurem-B can eliminate Landorus-T with their powerful Ice-type STAB move of choice, and the former two can pick off faster sets with their priority Ice Shard. It is important to note many cannot switch in without being eliminated by U-turn or taking 25% from Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Opposing Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Gliscor can come in on Landorus-T and set up Stealth Rock freely. However, they can easily be taken care of with Swords Dance-boosted attacks or crippled by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Most Grass-types such as Tangrowth, Chesnaught, and Mega Venusaur can force out non-Swords Dance Landorus-T due to their typing and strong Grass-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Skarmory can remove Landorus-T's entry hazards, wall it, and even beat Swords Dance sets by phazing them with Whirlwind or KOing them with Counter. Ferrothorn can wear Landorus-T down faster than it can do the same to Ferrothorn. Bulky Mega Scizor can also set up on Landorus-T without Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Pokemon with Ice-type coverage in general can be a pain for non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Raikou, Gengar, Tornadus-T, and Mega Manectric are great examples, but they will have to be wary of the uncommon Yache Berry. Mega Latias not only can outpace Landorus-T and KO it with Ice Beam but also has the necessary bulk to tank Knock Off from Choice Scarf Landorus-T.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Wallbreakers</strong>: While Landorus-T has great physical bulk, its middling Special Defense makes it vulnerable against Mega Charizard Y, Latios, Serperior, and Hydreigon despite it having a neutrality to their STAB moves.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Landorus-T's main way to deal with Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Excadrill. Stealth Rock is used for gradually wearing down your opponent's Pokemon and punishing switch-ins, with Landorus-T being an excellent user due to its good typing and ability to switch into many physical attackers to sponge hits. U-turn makes Landorus-T a great pivot to gain offensive momentum and scout the foe's moves as well as baiting in some defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory that strong wallbreakers on your team can take advantage of without taking the risk of getting damaged beforehand. Stone Edge is the best possible coverage move for Landorus-T, allowing it to hit Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate while being able to OHKO some threats such as Mega Pinsir, which is one of the reasons why Stone Edge is a superior move to Rock Slide despite the lower accuracy. Swords Dance can be run over U-turn because it can help Landorus-T pressure bulkier Pokemon such as Clefable, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and opposing Landorus-T rather than having to U-turn into a better matchup. Toxic can be used to cripple setup sweepers and bulkier Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Hippowdon, Garchomp, and Talonflame. Knock Off is also a good option for the last slot, as it provides a nice utility for teammates or for Landorus-T itself by helping them wear down bulky Pokemon more easily. For example, you can remove Skarmory's or Ferrothorn's Shed Shell and trap them with Magnezone later, and you can remove Leftovers, Eviolite, and Smooth Rock. It also hits Psychic-types for super effective damage. However, this leaves Landorus-T vulnerable to Mega Pinsir and Talonflame. Hidden Power Ice is a completely viable option to nail opposing Landorus-T and Garchomp, but if you opt for this it's preferable to run a Lax nature for higher rolls on the aforementioned foes, especially considering the Special Defense investment isn't that useful in most situations.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment and near-maximum Defense investment with a Impish nature is used to buff Landorus-T's defensive potential as much as possible to take on physical threats optimally. The 8 EVs in Special Defense allow Landorus-T to always survive Mega Manectric's Hidden Power Ice at full HP. The rest is dumped into Speed to outpace base 50 Speed Pokemon with a positive nature such as Azumarill. Intimidate strengthens Landorus-T's ability to come into threatening physical attackers. As for items, Rocky Helmet works well due to its ability to spread chip damage on threats such as Mega Lopunny and opposing Landorus-T, making it easier for its teammates or itself to pick them off later. Leftovers is the superior option on more defensive teams due to the great longevity it provides.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>One of the main reasons to use this set is setting up Stealth Rock, so try to set it up on Pokemon that are threatened by Earthquake or fear Rocky Helmet damage such as Excadrill, Mega Charizard X, Mega Lopunny, and Klefki, or just get it up as soon as possible in the match to instantly apply pressure on your opponent, potentially forcing a spin or Defog that you can take advantage of. Another reason why Landorus-T is slapped onto so many teams is its ability to come into many threatening attackers and force them out, allowing you to gain momentum, get up Stealth Rock, or get off a hefty chunk of damage on something to put you in a favorable situation. Try to KO Pokemon that threaten your team or at least will rack up damage, such as +1 Excadrill under sand, Swords Dance Talonflame, and Dragon Dance-boosted Mega Charizard X. U-turn is a great way to grab offensive momentum or scout the foe's moves, as Landorus-T can pivot into Pokemon that it would force out such as Jirachi and Excadrill and proceed to U-turn out on the opponent's expected switch out to rack up damage alongside Stealth Rock to keep the tempo of the match in your favor. Another way to use it is getting a slow U-turn after taking a hit and bringing in a teammate that matches up favorably. If you pack Swords Dance, use it early-game to break bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon and defensive Garchomp. Knock Off should be used to remove annoying items such as Leftovers, Eviolite, Shed Shell, Rocky Helmet, and Life Orb to make it easier to deal with those Pokemon later.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Latios and Starmie both can switch into Water-type attacks and check Keldeo perfectly; Starmie can also switch into Ice-type attacks. Ferrothorn is a great partner to complete the entry hazard-stacking core and resists Water-type attacks as well; it also switches into some special wallbreakers that Landorus-T can't manage, such as non-Hidden Power Fire Latios, Mega Diancie, and Kyurem-B, somewhat comfortably. Another great hazard core partner is Klefki for the more offensive approach, as between the two, they possess great defensive synergy and are capable of checking a large portion of the metagame, with Klefki also providing a ton of utility with moves like Spikes, Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Thunder Wave. Wallbreakers or hard-hitting Pokemon enjoy the slow U-turn Landorus-T can provide, such as Volcanion, Kyurem-B, Mega Medicham, and Thundurus, because they don't enjoy taking hits and all take advantage of what foes Landorus-T baits in, such as bulky Ground- and Water-types. Tyranitar is also good when paired with Landorus-T because Landorus-T tends to lure in Starmie, Latios, and Latias, which Tyranitar can trap, guaranteeing hazards on the other side of the field stay. Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Rotom-W can complete a VoltTurn core and keep momentum throughout the match; Mega Manectric also enjoys that Landorus-T can Toxic bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon or weaken them with Swords Dance-boosted attacks, while Rotom-W helps on a more defensive front, spreading status and alleviating pressure from Landorus-T in checking many threats. Landorus-T also makes a great core in terms of synergy and hazards with Dragalge, as it can take Water-type attacks while Landorus-T is immune to Ground-type attacks that hurt Dragalge. Clefable is a solid option too, as it can take unboosted Water- and Ice-type attacks from Pokemon such as Mega Manectric, Weavile, defensive Starmie, and Lopunny, while Landorus-T can deal with Pokemon that threaten Clefable such as Excadrill, Talonflame, and Mega Charizard X and also resists Poison-type attacks. Keldeo is also a nice alternative to pair with Landorus-T because Bisharp can get out of hand due to a +1 boost from Intimidate and it enjoys the slow U-turn to wallbreak safely. Bulky Water-types like Slowbro and Slowking take Water- and Ice-type attacks directed at Landorus-T reliably, with the latter taking on special wallbreakers slightly better and the former taking pressure off Landorus-T in beating the majority of the physical metagame.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>STAB Earthquake is easy to spam mid- and late-game without having anything immune to it; it also is able to revenge kill threats such as Choice Scarf Excadrill and Mega Alakazam. On a Choice Scarf set, U-turn is one of the best moves to have, functioning to gain offensive momentum and revenge kill weakened Pokemon to have switch initiative. Stone Edge is the perfect coverage move to go with Earthquake, hitting Flying-types, and it's a superior option over Rock Slide because this set needs the power to KO the likes of Dragonite, whose Outrage + Extreme Speed it cannot tank, and gain a high chance of OHKOing Tornadus-T. Knock Off cripples defensive Pokemon like Skarmory and Ferrothorn to wear them down more easily while also OHKOing Latias and Latios, which U-turn can't do; it also hits Gengar in a more reliable way and super effectively. Explosion should be considered as a last-ditch effort if you can't KO a foe with Earthquake and it is dangerous enough to sweep your team, as well dealing massive damage to bulkier Pokemon and even OHKOing them after a prior damage in the case of Clefable; it also works to gain momentum by providing switch initiative if the situation allows you to do so. Superpower nails Air Balloon Excadrill, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gyarados. Hidden Power Ice is a viable option as well to lure and eliminate opposing Landorus-T or other Pokemon 4x weak to it such as Garchomp.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment into Attack provides enough power to revenge kill threats such as Excadrill, Mega Charizard X, and Keldeo, the latter with a bit of prior damage. A Jolly nature with maximum investment into Speed is needed in order to grab momentum and revenge kill every single Mega Evolution such as Mega Lopunny or Mega Alakazam or Pokemon with a +1 Speed boost such as Mega Gyarados and Dragonite. Choice Scarf is the reason why this set is a great momentum grabber and revenge killer.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The main use of this set is to revenge kill threats after one of your Pokemon has been sacrificed. Try to maintain momentum as much as you can, for example by using U-turn on weakened Pokemon; you can bring in Landorus-T to force a Pokemon out, not only granting you offensive momentum or switch initiative but also racking up damage on the opponent's team and getting a fast U-turn off. Use it to check Mega Charizard X, Excadrill, and Mega Lopunny, but be wary of switching it directly in because its bulk is still average even with Intimidate; you can also use it to clean up late-game once Pokemon that resist or are immune to Ground have been removed or are weakened enough. It's also a good lead to scout your opponent's intentions as well as match up perfectly the majority of the time, and for poor matchups Landorus-T can just U-turn out. Be careful of locking Landorus-T into a move that leaves it vulnerable to a setup sweeper.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers fit perfectly as teammates, as they can beat what Choice Scarf Landorus-T baits in, granting you the upper hand in a match. The momentum grabbed by Landorus-T gives free switches in to Pokemon like Kyurem-B, Thundurus, Volcanion, Mega Heracross, Mega Gardevoir, Latios, and Magnezone that can trap Skarmory or Ferrothorn trying to switch into Landorus-T. An entry hazard setter is needed to inflict chip damage combined with U-turn; a good option is Ferrothorn, as it has nice synergy with Landorus-T defensively. Ferrothorn is able to take Water- and Ice-type attacks that threaten Landorus-T, which can take Fighting-type attacks in return. Pokemon that can weaken checks for Landorus-T are well received, such as Heatran, which can beat bulkier Pokemon such as Clefable and Skarmory and has access to Stealth Rock. Mega Manectric and Rotom-W complete a VoltTurn core to pressure bulkier builds and keep up offensive momentum. Spikes are really good with Landorus-T because many of its checks are grounded; Klefki in particular works great because it has use on offensive teams, and lead Skarmory is an option if you're taking the hyper offense path. Despite being an offensive set, this still can check some threats such as Excadrill and switch into Poison-type attacks, which Clefable appreciates; in return, Clefable can switch into multiple attacks that threaten Landorus-T, such as Kyurem-B's Ice Beam and Keldeo's Scald. Magnezone is really good to complete a VoltTurn core as well while also trapping pesky Steel-types such as Skarmory that completely counter Landorus-T, and Landorus-T in return is immune to Ground-type attacks that destroy Magnezone.</p>"

      "Double Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake should be spammed most of the time after setting up, or even before. Stone Edge hits targets that Earthquake cannot such as opposing Landorus-T, Talonflame, Rotom-W, and Skarmory, making it the best coverage move for Landorus-T. Swords Dance is capable of boosting Landorus-T's Attack in order to sweep teams under the right circumstances. Rock Polish works best against a more offensive team, where Speed is more needed than power.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack with an Adamant nature is used to hit as hard as possible both with and without a Swords Dance boost, dismantling defensive builds. Full investment into Speed is used in order to outpace key threats like Adamant Excadrill and fast Taunt users such as Heatran and Gliscor. Earth Plate lets Landorus-T net certain OHKOs, most notably on defensive Garchomp and Slowbro after Stealth Rock and a Swords Dance boost more than 50% of the time. An alternative EV spread of 8 HP / 176 Atk / 92 Def / 232 Spe allows Landorus-T to comfortably set up on Life Orb Excadrill and other physical attackers, which are what Landorus-T will most likely try to find a setup opportunity on, while still maintaining a Speed benchmark for Excadrill in sand after a Rock Polish; however, you can still go with maximum Speed to outpace Heatran before setting up. 176 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature alongside Earth Plate are more than enough to devastate bulkier teams. Lum Berry lets Landorus-T avoid Toxic and burn that can stop its sweep, which is useful against status-reliant stall teams, for example. Yache Berry is an option to check Electric-types and avoid the OHKO from Weavile's Ice-type attacks. Leftovers with a bulkier spread can be used to fit into bulky offense builds, but the lack of immediate power is significant.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use this set to break bulkier Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Clefable, and Slowbro for a teammate like Mega Lopunny to take advantage of mid- or late-game. You can also use this set to clean late-game, setting up a Swords Dance against slower builds, which tend to be bulkier, or a Rock Polish against offensive or fast builds, which, conversely, require Speed over power because they typically are more frail. Try to set up in front of physical attackers or Pokemon that can't do much back such as Hippowdon and Choice Scarf Keldeo locked into Secret Sword, and aim to eliminate all users of priority before attempting to sweep, such as Weavile, Scizor, Azumarill, and Talonflame. You should use wallbreakers early- or mid-game to weaken Landorus-T's checks or find an opportunity to eliminate threats like Rotom-W before attempting a sweep. Don't play your Landorus-T like a physical wall early-game, as its HP should be preserved as much as possible if you are using it as your main wincon or sweeper. If you choose Lum Berry, you can play more recklessly in term of setup, but without the Earth Plate boost Landorus-T won't 2HKO Quagsire on the switch even with Stealth Rock. Earth Plate can give Landorus-T a better matchup against stall, but it is recommended you set up on non-status move users or try to bluff another set, such as bluffing Knock Off on Chansey or bluffing Stealth Rock to bait Skarmory in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Other strong attackers appreciate Landorus-T's ability to weaken the opponent's team, such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Scizor, Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, Alakazam, and Keldeo. On the other hand, Landorus-T appreciates teammates that can break its checks for a mid- or late-game sweep such as Mega Heracross, Mega Medicham, Volcanion, Magma Storm + Power Herb + Solar Beam Heatran, and Mega Charizard X. Clefable is great teammate, as it can absorb status in case you're not packing Lum Berry and appreciates that Landorus-T can break Steel-types and special walls so it can freely set up some Calm Minds to clean up. Magnezone traps Skarmory, which can phaze Landorus-T with Whirlwind or stall it out of Stone Edge PP. A defensive Pokemon like Slowbro that is capable of checking what a more offensive variant of Landorus-T cannot break through throughout the course of a match such as Excadrill is appreciated.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With an Adamant nature and Earth Plate boost, Earthquake hits like a truck and can be spammed in any stage of the match. Stone Edge provides the best coverage with Earthquake by hitting Rotom-W, Skarmory, and Talonflame. Swords Dance boosts Landorus-T's Attack and enables it to hit ridiculously hard, granting it even greater wallbreaking potential to hurt bulkier teams. Also, with a Swords Dance boost Landorus-T can force switches to get up Stealth Rock, which is the main point of this set. Smack Down is an option to lure and eliminate some common switch-ins in Skarmory and Rotom-W, allowing you to freely click Earthquake the turn after or, if they have another Flying-type or Levitate user, get up Stealth Rock. U-turn is an option over Swords Dance if you prefer an offensive pivot; if you choose this move, Earth Plate is pretty much necessary to make up for the loss of power. Smack Down is also a much more valid option on U-turn sets to grab offensive momentum. Knock Off can remove items such as Eviolites and Leftovers, to cripple and wear down opposing builds quickly, and Shed Shell, in case you have Magnezone in the back. Explosion is an option to weaken some bulky Pokemon and pick them off with another teammate or to block Defog.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Earth Plate provides much more damage output in general, allowing you to crush Quagsire on the switch, for example, if an Adamant nature is chosen. Yache Berry is a nice option to lure and eliminate Electric-types, most of which pack Hidden Power Ice, and Ice-types. Leftovers lets Landorus-T check Excadrill and Mega Charizard X more than once. Passho Berry allows Landorus-T to set up on Water-types that don't have an Ice-type attack and beat Starmie one-on-one. A Jolly nature is an option to outpace Pokemon like Jolly Excadrill or neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon. Maximum Attack is mandatory to break bulkier teams, as is maximum Speed so Landorus-T isn't dead weight against faster teams packing Hidden Power Ice Heatran, for example. An alternative spread of 192 HP / 136 Atk / 180 Spe with an Adamant nature aims to switch into Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Excadrill, and Talonflame, hits an extra point in Attack and still hits hard, and allows Landorus-T to outspeed Jolly Breloom and Bisharp as well as Timid Volcanion.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The point of this set is to become more threatening offensively by hitting much harder with a lot of Attack investment, essentially providing Landorus-T with wallbreaking potential to pressure bulkier teams and thereby open a window to set up Stealth Rock. Set up Swords Dance on Pokemon that cannot OHKO Landorus-T, on foes that can't touch it such as non-Roar Hippowdon. If you force them out, go for Stealth Rock. The whole idea of multiple items like Lum Berry, Yache Berry, Earth Plate, or Passho Berry is to lure some threats so your teammates have an easier time late-game. This set struggles to consistently check strong physical attackers such as Excadrill, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Charizard X, so use it conservatively. Whether you need Stealth Rock up or to break a team with a Swords Dance boost is your choice; aim for whichever benefits your game plan in the long term.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Lopunny, Mega Charizard X, or any strong physical attacker likes Landorus-T wearing down bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon, opposing Landorus-T, and defensive Garchomp. A offensive Grass-type such as Breloom can beat bulky Water-types that Landorus-T struggles with, but this leaves your team vulnerable to Ice-type attacks. Klefki is a great offensive partner that perfectly pairs with Landorus-T in an offensive entry hazard-setting core, as the two possess great defensive synergy and are capable of checking a large portion of the metagame, with Klefki also providing a ton of utility with moves like Spikes, Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Thunder Wave. Landorus-T can lure some Pokemon depending on the type of Berry you choose or if you pack Smack Down; for example, Swords Dance Mega Scizor has an easier time once Electric-types have been removed with the help of Yache Berry. Smack Down is also good to remove Skarmory and Rotom-W for Mega Scizor. Latios takes on Keldeo, reliably switches into Water-types, and can hit them harder with Draco Meteor; once again, watch out for Ice-type attacks. Keldeo is a good teammate, as it takes on common threats to Landorus-T such as Bisharp and Weavile. Tyranitar can Pursuit trap Latios, Latias, and Starmie to ensure Stealth Rock stays on the field, as well having great synergy with Landorus-T. Mega Manectric and Raikou like Ground-types being weakened.</p>"
      },
      "Suicide Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The job of suicide lead Landorus-T is to set up Stealth Rock as early as possible. Focus Sash makes it impossible to OHKO, allowing it to safely set up Stealth Rock. To prevent slower Pokemon from setting up their own Stealth Rock, Landorus-T can use Imprison. Alternatively, Rock Tomb denies setup sweepers and hits faster targets like Tornadus-T, dealing chip damage, and allows Landorus-T to set up Stealth Rock on the next turn thanks to the Speed advantage. Earthquake deals heavy damage to grounded foes like Excadrill and Mega Diancie, which can otherwise disrupt Landorus-T from its core function as a Stealth Rock setter. Explosion finalizes its moveset, allowing Landorus-T to get off a strong hit and sacrificing itself and safely bring in a teammate. U-turn can be used instead of Explosion when used alongside Imprison; it prevents other Landorus-T and Mega Scizor from pivoting out with U-turn and breaking Landorus-T's Focus Sash. It also allows Landorus-T to gain momentum and provides a teammate a safe switch in, preserving Landorus-T for later in the game.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack investment with a Jolly nature allow Landorus-T to outspeed Excadrill, letting it prevent Rapid Spin attempts with an OHKO from Earthquake. The high Attack also threatens out Mega Diancie and makes Explosion as strong as possible. Alternatively, Landorus-T can run 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 Spe and a Jolly nature with either Rocky Helmet or Yache Berry as its item. 248 HP EVs allow Landorus-T to absorb physical hits and pivot into its teammates with U-turn, which should be used on this set over Explosion. Yache Berry can be used to survive strong Ice-type moves like Icicle Crash from Weavile, Hidden Power Ice from Thundurus, and Ice Beam from Mega Latias to either set up Stealth Rock or deal heavy damage to the foe. This set is recommended for teams that struggle with physically offensive threats like Mega Lopunny and want Landorus-T to pivot into them once or twice. This is often used in combination with Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar, Serperior, and Mega Alakazam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Landorus-T variant should set up Stealth Rock as soon as possible while preventing others from setting up. Against faster foes, it can make sense to use Rock Tomb first. After setting up and preventing Stealth Rock, Explosion is usually the best course of action, allowing a teammate to come in safely. When faced with a faster suicide lead such as Aerodactyl, Mew, or Azelf, Landorus-T will not be able to set up Stealth Rock because of opposing Taunt. In that case, Landorus-T can either use Rock Tomb to deal chip damage or another lead should be chosen instead. When running U-turn, Landorus-T can absorb the Taunt as well as break a possible Focus Sash and pivot into a threat for the opposing lead.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Landorus-T variant functions best on offensive teams. In comparison to other suicide leads, it is easier to set up Stealth Rock against Landorus-T. Therefore, it should be paired with either a Rapid Spin user like Excadrill or Cloyster or partnered with Mega Diancie, since it can prevent entry hazards with Magic Bounce. This Landorus-T set can also be used on offensive teams that are not particularly weak to Stealth Rock and profit from the dynamic of Intimidate and Landorus-T's attacks. Other good teammates are Pokemon that appreciate their common checks being weakened by Stealth Rock, such as Volcarona, Serperior, and Bisharp, whose threats include Talonflame, Volcanion, Dragonite, and Tornadus-T. Serperior especially appreciates Landorus-T's Stealth Rock chipping down Weavile and opposing Volcarona, while Serperior takes on bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Slowbro that annoy Landorus-T and uses Taunt to prevent foes from using Defog to clear hazards or set up their own. Other setup Pokemon like Manaphy take advantage of the Water- and Ice-types that Landorus-T draws in and use the opportunity to set up Tail Glow.</p>"

  "Kyurem": {
    "overview": "<p>Kyurem, while uncommon in the OU tier, is a strong special wallbreaker able to threaten a number of Pokemon with its great STAB moves that are difficult to switch into, such as Clefable, which gets 2HKOed by Ice Beam. Despite facing competition from Kyurem-B as a wallbreaker, as its ability is not as useful as Kyurem-B's Teravolt as well as being unable to run Roost due to needing Choice Specs, it has a higher Special Attack stat than its counterpart, allowing it to run a Choice Specs set more viably. Good bulk along with valuable resistances to Water, Electric, and Grass moves allows it to check threats such as Rotom-W, Manaphy, Serperior, and Mega Manectric. However, weaknesses to common types such as Fighting and Rock with a vulnerability to all types of entry hazard, mainly Stealth Rock, can limit its ability to switch in, and its Speed, although not bad, leaves Kyurem outsped by a number of threats sitting at the base 100 Speed benchmark.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute + Roost can be a neat set on slower builds to utilize Pressure, Kyurem's good bulk, and its ability to create 101 HP Substitutes in order to PP stall foes, although Kyurem is better suited for being a special wallbreaker due to its hard-hitting STAB moves. Other offensive sets are done better by Kyurem-B due to Fusion Bolt and its ability to go mixed along with having Teravolt, which means it doesn't have to rely as much on prediction as Kyurem does.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Although they cannot directly switch into its coverage options, Steel-types, mainly Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, and Jirachi can easily threaten Kyurem due to their strong STAB moves while also resisting its STAB combination. Excadrill is also an honorable mention; while it can't switch into Kyurem, threatens it with its strong Iron Heads.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Threats such as Chansey can come in on Kyurem repeatedly due to taking little from its moves, being able to heal off any damage with Soft-Boiled, and being able to threaten Kyurem with a Toxic, which limits its time on the field, or a Thunder Wave, which can cripple it by making it slower than all of the threats that it is supposed to handle.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Slowking deserves a mention due to being able to take Kyurem's attacks and recover off the damage while also being able to set up with Calm Minds; while it cannot switch directly into two Draco Meteors, it can safely switch into all of Kyurem's other moves and set up on it with ease. Suicune is able to handle Kyurem if running Rest in a one-on-one situation as well.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Despite not being able to switch in easily, faster attackers like Terrakion, Keldeo, and Mega Lopunny are all able to take out Kyurem with their strong Fighting-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Threats such as Azumarill, Mega Diancie, and Clefable can all take advantage of a Kyurem locked into Draco Meteor and use their super effective STAB moves to take out Kyurem. Azumarill specifically can switch into all of Kyurem's moves except for Earth Power, although being locked into Earth Power can be easily taken advantage in other ways. However, Clefable cannot switch in directly into a Choice Specs-boosted Ice Beam and must take great care when playing around Kyurem.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Choice Scarf Tyranitar can switch into Kyurem's attacks barring Focus Blast and threaten it with Stone Edge. Faster Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Latios, and Mega Charizard X, in particular, threaten Kyurem with super effective STAB moves as well.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam is a strong STAB move that doesn't come with any drawbacks, making it a safe option in general and allowing Kyurem to 2HKO relevant targets such as Clefable. Draco Meteor is Kyurem's hardest hitting STAB move, dealing great damage to Pokemon that resist Ice, mainly Water-types such as Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Keldeo. Earth Power provides great coverage in smacking Steel-types that resist Kyurem's STAB combination, such as Heatran, Jirachi, and Mega Metagross; it is also Kyurem's best move to hit Azumarill with. Hidden Power Fire completes its coverage by being able to hit Mega Scizor, which can generally take the rest of Kyurem's moves and threaten it with a strong STAB Bullet Punch. Focus Blast is another good coverage move, being able to OHKO Tyranitar while still netting good coverage against Ferrothorn and having a good chance to 2HKO standard Mega Scizor if running a Timid nature.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs bolster the power of Kyurem's special moves. Choice Specs lets Kyurem act as a strong special wallbreaker with the drawback of locking it into one move. Maximum Speed with a Timid nature allows Kyurem to outspeed threats such as Jolly Excadrill out of sand and Adamant Mega Medicham. A Modest nature is usually not necessary, as maximum Special Attack investment with a Timid nature is enough to 2HKO both standard Calm Clefable and have a strong chance to 2HKO Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock with Ice Beam. Being able to outspeed Excadrill and Mega Medicham while still achieving a 2HKO on both Clefable and Ferrothorn is what gives Kyurem an edge over Choice Specs Kyurem-B, which fails to achieve the 2HKO most of the time with Timid itself.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Removing entry hazards is helpful so that Kyurem can utilize its bulk to switch in more often without having to worry about residual damage. Pairing Kyurem with partners that can bring it in through the use of Volt Switch or U-turn helps it come in safely without having to fear strong attacks it might not be able to switch into directly. Generally, Kyurem should be used as an early-game wallbreaker to punch holes into opposing teams. It can switch into weak Water, Grass, and Electric attacks thanks to its good bulk and retaliate, and it can also be brought in on double switches as well as passive Pokemon such as Skarmory. Ice Beam is the most spammable move to use, dealing a large chunk to a wide variety of threats, and it can help your team handle threats such as Clefable, as it will not be as willing to switch into Kyurem predicting Draco Meteor due to the fear of being 2HKOed by Ice Beam. Draco Meteor is also very useful to take out threats that can take more than one Ice Beam, such as Slowbro and Rotom-W, and can even deal heavy damage to Pokemon that resist it, mainly Steel-types such as Jirachi, thus limiting their ability to switch into Kyurem again, as Draco Meteor is mainly meant to be used as a hit-and-run move; however, be wary of using it with a Fairy-type on the opposing team, as it can gain momentum if Kyurem locks itself into it. If a Steel-type is on the opposing team, you can either stick to using Kyurem's STAB moves to wear it down, or predict the switch in with its coverage moves, although getting locked into the wrong coverage move can give the opponent free momentum, so be careful.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Tyranitar pairs well with Kyurem, as it helps deal heavy damage to Chansey while being able to trap faster threats such as Latios for Kyurem. Starmie is a great option that can handle threats such as Mega Diancie for Kyurem while also dealing with Keldeo, as well as providing Rapid Spin support. Latios appreciates Kyurem's ability to take out Clefable and provides Kyurem with entry hazard removal and the ability to handle problematic threats such as Keldeo; however, given that Kyurem prefers having entry hazard support, particularly Spikes, Rapid Spin is usually a better hazard control option. Heatran is able to pressure Steel-types, set up Stealth Rock, and provide Toxic support against the likes of Slowking. Landorus-T provides Stealth Rock support and a slow U-turn while being able to handle Excadrill, which can prove to be a major threat to Kyurem under sand, and Landorus-T in return appreciates Kyurem's ability to handle Electric-, Water-, and Grass-types for it. Garchomp fulfills a similar role minus the U-turn support while being able to take on many problematic threats to Kyurem that sit at the base 100 Speed tier such as Mega Gardevoir and Charizard. Rotom-W also checks Excadrill, Mega Scizor, and other threats such as Jirachi thanks to Will-O-Wisp and provides slow pivoting support for Kyurem, while in return it appreciates having Grass-types taken out.</p> <p>Steel-type partners such as Jirachi, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, as well as Mega Metagross and Mega Scizor serve as great partners due to their ability to handle Fairies for Kyurem. Jirachi can provide Stealth Rock support, pivot with U-turn, and pass Wishes or Healing Wishes in case Kyurem gets worn down too much, with Healing Wish, in particular, being very helpful for Kyurem. Ferrothorn and Skarmory are able to set up Spikes, allowing it to more easily wallbreak against worn down foes, and Skarmory can also take on Excadrill under sand. Mega Scizor helps take out Mega Diancie and can also provide a slow U-turn, as well as being able to switch into Latios and Latias while also being able to provide Pursuit support. Metagross also provides Pursuit support with either a Mega or an Assault Vest set. Excadrill greatly appreciates Kyurem being able to threaten strong checks to it such as Landorus-T and Tangrowth, and Kyurem benefits from potential Rapid Spin support that Excadrill may provide. Stealth Rock Clefable is a notable partner, since it can get the hazard up against stall teams for Kyurem and can also provide Thunder Wave support for it.</p>"

  "Kyurem-Black": {
    "overview": "<p>Upon looking at Kyurem-B's monstrous Attack stat and its solid stats overall, you can tell right away that it's an offensive powerhouse in the OU tier. Boasting the game's most powerful Outrage, a solid Special Attack stat, and a great STAB type in Ice, it has almost no switch-ins and can break down even the bulkiest of walls. Despite being Ice-type, Kyurem-B is no slouch defensively; well-rounded bulk and resistances to the common Electric- and Water-type attacks give it plenty of opportunities to enter the battlefield. Whether Kyurem-B is breaking down walls, revenge killing, or even stallbreaking with Substitute, its versatility means that can fit onto nearly any offensive team and perform well. On the downside, Kyurem-B most of the time is forced to run a mixed set due to its lack of any usable physical Ice-type STAB moves. While Kyurem-B's defensive typing grants it some decent resistances, it also gives Kyurem-B nasty weaknesses to Fighting-, Fairy-, and Rock-type attacks, all of which are highly prevalent in OU. Lastly, base 95 Speed is not very good, as it leaves Kyurem-B outsped by a wide variety of threats, such as Mega Gardevoir, Hydreigon, and Keldeo.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Freeze Shock alongside Power Herb is a very powerful Ice-type STAB move that takes advantage of Kyurem-B's monstrous Attack stat, but the move can only be used once. Assault Vest can be used to turn Kyurem-B into a strong special tank, but Kyurem-B will miss the ability to use Roost and Substitute.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Scizor can tank all of Kyurem-B's attacks and retaliate hard with Bullet Punch, while Ferrothorn can directly threaten Kyurem-B with Gyro Ball, cut its Speed with Thunder Wave, or stall it out with Leech Seed. However, neither Scizor nor Ferrothorn enjoys being hit with the occasional Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Talonflame can revenge kill a weakened Kyurem-B with Brave Bird, Landorus-T destroys non-Choice Scarf variants with Stone Edge, and Choice Scarf Keldeo often OHKOes Kyurem-B with Secret Sword after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Clefable</strong>: Standard Magic Guard Clefable can switch in on all of Kyurem-B's attacks bar Iron Head and Choice Specs-boosted Ice Beam. Clefable can then proceed to set up with Calm Mind, cripple it with Thunder Wave, or hit Kyurem-B hard with Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Should Kyurem-B lack Roost, it becomes very vulnerable to the passive damage brought on by entry hazards. It is also weak to Stealth Rock, so entry hazard removal is almost required to keep it alive.</p> <p><strong>Conkeldurr</strong>: Conkeldurr can take any of Kyurem-B's attacks bar Outrage and then 2HKO Kyurem-B with the combination of STAB Drain Punch and Mach Punch.</p>",

      "Mixed Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam is a strong, reliable STAB attack that hits the Dragon-, Ground-, and Flying-types of OU hard. Earth Power provides coverage against the Steel- and Fire-types that resist Ice Beam, such as Heatran, Bisharp, Jirachi, and Victini. Fusion Bolt puts a dent in Water-types such as Azumarill, Mega Slowbro, and Manaphy and deals heavy damage to Flying-types that are not weak to Ice, such as Talonflame and Skarmory. Roost heals off Life Orb recoil; Kyurem-B is bulky enough to get several chances to use Roost in most games. Alternatively, Outrage is Kyurem-B's most powerful STAB attack and puts a dent in even the bulkiest of physical walls.</p> <p>Dragon Claw can also be used in the fourth slot as a STAB attack that does not lock Kyurem-B into a move, though Dragon Claw is noticeably less powerful than Outrage. Hidden Power Fire helps this set act as a lure to Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, though it has limited use outside of that. Iron Head is another viable option to hit Fairy-types hard, such as Clefable and Gardevoir before it Mega Evolves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs and a Mild nature allow Kyurem-B to outspeed fully invested, positive-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon, Speed tie with other neutral-nature Kyurem-B, and Adamant Mega Garchomp, while a Naive nature can be used to outspeed Pokemon such as Jolly Landorus-T and Heracross prior to Mega Evolution. Full investment in Special Attack raises the power of Ice Beam and Earth Power to maximum levels. Life Orb is the preferred item to make Kyurem-B's attacks hit as hard as possible. Teravolt is useful for breaking through several defensive abilities, such as Dragonite's Multiscale and Rotom-W's Levitate.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kyurem-B should be used in the early- and mid-game as a dedicated wallbreaker. As this Kyurem-B will be worn down by Life Orb recoil, it should enter the battlefield on free switches whenever possible. Also be sure to keep entry hazards off the field, as Kyurem-B is weak to Stealth Rock and passive damage of any kind will wear it down even faster. Due to Kyurem-B's unpredictability, most opponents will switch their Pokemon around to try to scout Kyurem-B's moveset; take advantage of this by hitting the predicted switch-in with the appropriate attack. If running Outrage, do not use the move until the opponent's Fairy-types have been eliminated and their Steel-types weakened. If running Roost, use the move when Kyurem-B gets low on health; that way it can leave the battlefield and come in later if it needs to.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T and Azelf can wear down walls for Kyurem-B, giving it an easier time breaking down the opposing team. Entry hazard removers such as Excadrill are required because of Kyurem-B's Stealth Rock weakness. Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y can force out Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, both of which wall Kyurem-B should it lack Hidden Power Fire. Dedicated late-game sweepers, such as Serperior and Talonflame, enjoy Kyurem-B's wallbreaking because it allows them to clean up the opposing team more easily. Steel-types such as Bisharp appreciate Kyurem-B's ability to scare Ground-types, particularly Garchomp, Landorus-T, Diggersby, and Hippowdon.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Outrage is Kyurem-B's main STAB move. It hits extremely hard thanks to Kyurem-B's amazing Attack stat and Choice Band, and it can even 2HKO Steel-types like Heatran and Excadrill and OHKO a large portion of the offensive metagame. Fusion Bolt is Kyurem-B's best option for hitting Steel-types and Fairy-types, gaining at least neutral coverage on all of them bar Ferrothorn and Excadrill. It also deals massive damage to Water-types like Azumarill and Slowbro without requiring it to lock itself into Outrage. Iron Head is used in order to OHKO standard Clefable. Finally, Dragon Claw serves as a powerful STAB move that does not lock Kyurem-B in, enabling it to weaken Steel-types without having to predict. Ice Beam can also be used to OHKO Landorus-T, deal decent damage to Ferrothorn, and bypass Garchomp's Rough Skin; however, it is rather weak.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment makes Kyurem-B as powerful as possible, while its Speed is also maxed out to at least tie with other neutral-natured Kyurem-B. A Choice Band enables Kyurem-B to hit incredibly hard, making it difficult to wall without also making it suffer Life Orb recoil. An Adamant nature gives Kyurem-B a chance to OHKO standard Clefable with Iron Head from full health. However, a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed neutral-natured base 100s as well as at least Speed tie with other Kyurem-B.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kyurem-B acts as a very straightforward wallbreaker. Try to get it in through U-turn and Volt Switch in order to limit the damage it takes throughout the battle. It can also be sent in on Water-types like Slowbro and Rotom-W; however, be careful, because a burn from Scald or Will-O-Wisp will leave it almost useless for the rest of the battle. Kyurem-B should be kept relatively healthy throughout the battle in order to clean the opposing team later in the match. Therefore, it will usually need entry hazards to be removed before being sent out on the field due to its Stealth Rock weakness. It can also be worn down by repeated Volt Switches from Pokemon it is supposed to counter. Early on in the battle, try to wear down Steel- and Fairy-types with Fusion Bolt, and avoid using Outrage. Once all Fairy-types have been removed and all Steel-types have been weakened, exclusively use Dragon Claw if Pokemon that can revenge kill Kyurem-B, like Keldeo and Mega Lopunny, are still active, and use Outrage otherwise. You also may want to use Outrage to severely weaken a Steel-type that threatens your team, such as Ferrothorn, or Chansey, which usually counters Kyurem-B but loses almost all of its health to a single Choice Band-boosted Outrage. While this set isn't as threatening to physical walls like Landorus-T and Hippowdon as its other sets, bluffing a mixed set can cause your opponent to switch these Pokemon out when facing Kyurem-B.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set works well on teams that require a bulky holepuncher with useful resistances to Water, Electric, and Grass. Magnezone is a great partner for Kyurem-B, since it can trap Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Skarmory, enabling it to more freely use Outrage, and check Fairies. Kyurem-B also requires support from an entry hazard remover. Latios is particularly good, since it can lure and eliminate Steel-types, particularly Ferrothorn with Hidden Power Fire, and appreciates Chansey being removed. Kyurem-B appreciates VoltTurn support from the likes of Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T, as they can get it in for free against a wall. Fairies are annoying for Kyurem-B to handle, since they prevent it from safely using Outrage. Thus, it requires support from a check to Fairies, like Jirachi, which can heal Kyurem-B up via Healing Wish; Scizor, which can set up on checks like Diancie and Ferrothorn; or Klefki, which provides Thunder Wave and Spikes support. Excadrill is particularly good, since it can remove hazards and, with sand support, clean faster teams, which Kyurem-B struggles against. Kyurem-B hates dealing with Ferrothorn, so a Pokemon that can lure it in and deal with it, like Swords Dance Landorus-T or Hidden Power Fire Starmie, makes for a good partner. A general check to Steel-types, like Heatran or Keldeo, is also required in order to help Kyurem-B outlast them. Garchomp supports Kyurem-B well, since it can also eliminate Steel-types via Fire Blast or even Swords Dance, set up Stealth Rock, and weaken faster attackers and priority users like Bisharp and Mega Lopunny. Choice Band Kyurem-B's ability to KO Chansey makes it a good partner for special attackers that want it removed, such as Starmie, Manaphy, Raikou and Mega Manectric.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute gives Kyurem-B a shield against weaker, resisted attacks as well as status moves. Ice Beam is Kyurem-B's best STAB attack due to its vast coverage, hitting Dragon-, Ground-, and Flying-types for massive damage. Fusion Bolt handles the Water-types that can switch into Ice Beam, such as Keldeo, Azumarill, and Mega Gyarados; the move also helps Kyurem-B against dedicated special walls, such as Chansey. Earth Power rounds out this set's coverage, taking down the Fire- and Steel-types that resist Ice Beam. However, Roost can also be used to make Kyurem-B last longer on the battlefield.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>56 HP EVs give Kyurem-B 404 HP, ensuring that Chansey's Seismic Toss will not break Kyurem-B's Substitute in a single hit. 252 EVs in Speed allow Kyurem-B to outspeed fully invested base 80 Speed Pokemon as well as Speed tie with other neutral-nature Kyurem-B, while the remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack alongside a Mild nature to make Kyurem-B hit as hard as possible. Leftovers is the preferred item to increased Kyurem-B's longevity, though Life Orb is an alternative to bluff a mixed wallbreaking set. The recoil from Life Orb can be healed off with Roost as well. Teravolt is useful for breaking through several defensive abilities, such as Dragonite's Multiscale and Rotom-W's Levitate.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used as a dedicated tank against offensive teams. Bring Kyurem-B into the battlefield against a Pokemon that it forces out, such as Suicune or Celebi, and then use Substitute on the predicted switch. After getting behind a Substitute, Kyurem-B can freely attack with the corresponding coverage move as the foe tries to break the Substitute. Keep in mind that this Kyurem set is not a wallbreaker, so it struggles against stall staples such as Chansey and Clefable.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal from the likes of Starmie, Zapdos, and Latias is crucial because Kyurem-B is vulnerable to all entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock. Steel-types such as Excadrill can deal with the Fairy-types that give Kyurem-B trouble. In particular, Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon must be eliminated because their Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice bypasses Kyurem-B's Substitute. Poison-types can also wear down Fairy-types and have great defensive synergy with Kyurem-B, tanking the Fighting-type moves that hit Kyurem-B super effectively. A strong physical attacker such as Mega Metagross can break down the special walls that can easily switch into Kyurem-B.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam is a reliable STAB attack that has amazing coverage in the OU metagame, hitting the various Ground-, Flying-, and Dragon-types hard. Kyurem-B possesses the most powerful Outrage in the game; the move annihilates anything that is not a Fairy- or Steel-type. Fusion Bolt gives Kyurem-B perfect neutral coverage alongside Ice Beam and hits Water-types and Flying-types that are neutral to Ice for massive damage. Dragon Claw is an alternative physical STAB attack that does not confuse Kyurem-B and prevent it from switching like Outrage does. Alternatively, Iron Head can be used to surprise Fairy-types such as Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Sylveon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Naive nature allow Kyurem-B to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T and OHKO it with Ice Beam. Full Attack investment maximizes the power of Kyurem-B's physical attacks. Choice Scarf makes Kyurem-B outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, allowing Kyurem-B to function as a terrifying cleaner and revenge killer.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used as both a revenge killer after a teammate faints and a cleaner in the late-game. Kyurem-B will be spamming Outrage the majority of the time, but it must not use the move if opposing Fairy-types are still alive. If Kyurem-B is low on health, be careful around opposing Choice Scarf users and priority attackers, as they will both revenge kill Kyurem-B rather easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal is required for Kyurem-B to switch into the battlefield safely; Starmie, Excadrill, Zapdos, Latios, and Latias can all provide this. Steel- and Poison-types such as Mega Metagross and Gengar, respectively, can deal with the Fairy-types that prevent Kyurem-B from spamming Outrage. Dedicated special wallbreakers such as Manaphy and Mega Gardevoir can break down bulky Pokemon, allowing Kyurem-B to finish off the opposing team more easily. Entry hazard support from the likes of Klefki and Landorus-T can also wear down bulky foes. Magnezone can trap and KO the Steel-types that resist Outrage, particularly Ferrothorn. Pokemon weak to Ground, such as Heatran, Bisharp, Raikou, and Mega Diancie, appreciate Kyurem-B's ability to outspeed and KO Landorus-T, and non-Choice Scarf Garchomp.</p>"

  },
  "Keldeo": {
    "overview": "<p>Keldeo is one of the most influential Pokemon in the ORAS metagame, being not only a complete powerhouse on its own, but also notorious for its ability to wear down a good majority of its checks through Scald burns, exerting an incredible amount of pressure in most games. Unlike most special attackers, Keldeo isn't walled by Chansey thanks to its signature STAB move in Secret Sword, which allows Keldeo to prey on its low Defense stat, giving it an inherent advantage versus stall. Additionally, good Speed and fantastic Special Attack, coupled with a fearsome STAB combination, ensure that it pulls its weight in just about every matchup. Keldeo also sports solid all-around bulk for an offensive Pokemon and great typing defensively, which allow it to check several threatening Pokemon such as Bisharp, Weavile, Tyranitar, Mega Scizor, and Heatran. All of these traits combined make Keldeo a very low-risk, high-reward Pokemon, capable of fulfilling a variety roles effectively on several types of teams. Due to a limited movepool, though, Keldeo will always be walled by something depending on what coverage it chooses. Some notable examples include Latios, Starmie, Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Latias, and for the latter two in particular, it doesn't matter what coverage Keldeo may have regardless. Furthermore, while Keldeo's Speed tier is good, it still leaves it outpaced by quite a few common Pokemon such as Latios, Starmie, Serperior, Tornadus-T, and Mega Lopunny.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Offensive Calm Mind is an option that can work, given that Keldeo benefits from an extra coverage move, but generally Choice Specs is better due to the immediate boost it gives, and the standard Calm Mind set really appreciates the extra longevity that Leftovers provides, in addition to the shield against status with Substitute. Expert Belt can be used to bluff Choice sets and catch certain counters off guard that think Keldeo is locked into a move. A RestTalk set using either Life Orb or Rocky Helmet lets Keldeo act as more reliable check to Mega Scizor, Bisharp, and Weavile due to being much harder to wear down. Taunt has use in shutting down passive Pokemon such as Alomomola, Suicune, and Gastrodon while also preventing Stealth Rock being set up by certain Pokemon. Endeavor can be a nice last-resort option on Keldeo's Choice Scarf set to break down an unsuspecting counter when low on HP. Endeavor can also be used in tandem with Substitute or a Focus Sash to force Keldeo down to low HP more reliably, thus taking the most advantage of it. Hidden Power Flying hits primarily Mega Venusaur and still maintains coverage on Amoonguss, but otherwise there are better coverage options. A Choice Scarf set can also be used with a Timid Nature and maximum speed EVs allowing Keldeo to outspeed +1 Mega Charizard X and Volcarona.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types, in particular those that resist Water as well, are some of the consistent Keldeo checks. Latios and Mega Latias in particular both are not 2HKOed by Keldeo's STAB combination, naturally outspeed Keldeo, and OHKO it with Psyshock. Both are also capable of restoring lost HP with Recover but can find themselves pressured to do so more when burned by Scald. Latios also has to watch out for Choice Specs-boosted Icy Wind, which will not only 2HKO it on the switch but also make Latios slower on the following turn. Other Pokemon such as Slowking and Slowbro are very troublesome, as they also resist Keldeo's STAB combination and can either cripple Keldeo with Thunder Wave, deal heavy damage with Psyshock, or set up Calm Mind against it. Keldeo also has harder time wearing them down with burns as well due to Regenerator, though it's worth noting that Slowbro is 2HKOed by Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock plus a burn. Starmie also outspeeds and promptly OHKOes or 2HKOes Keldeo depending on whether it's offensive or defensive, but offensive variants do have a much harder time switching in. It's worth noting that Starmie also doesn't mind Scald burns due to Natural Cure. Offensive variants also risk being 2HKOed by Hidden Power Electric from Keldeo's Choice Scarf set. Defensive Starmie can also fail to check Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo if it's already behind a Substitute and Starmie has opted for Thunder Wave or Toxic over Psyshock. (Mega) Alakazam is able to revenge kill Keldeo with Psychic, but it by no means can directly switch in and must be wary of Choice Scarf Keldeo.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Amoonguss is a thorn in Keldeo's side, taking little from even Choice Specs-boosted attacks and having Regenerator to alleviate the residual damage from Scald burns. To retaliate, Amoonguss can use Keldeo as a free opportunity to put something to sleep with Spore or just attack with Giga Drain. Mega Venusaur also hard walls Keldeo, not caring about any coverage move Keldeo carries, and being bulky enough that it can switch in to two Hydro Pumps, even when burned. Serperior, while by no means able to directly switch in, naturally outspeeds Keldeo and threatens to OHKO it with Leaf Storm. Serperior does have to watch out for its Choice Scarf set, though, as Secret Sword will 2HKO after Stealth Rock. Celebi, while certainly less common, is an incredibly consistent switch in to Keldeo thanks to its typing, bulk, access to Recover, and Natural Cure. Assault Vest Tangrowth is also a decent answer, but it does risk being 2HKOed by Choice Specs-boosted Focus Blast and in general hates being worn down by Scald burns due to a lack of recovery outside of Regenerator. Physically defensive Tangrowth is still capable of checking Keldeo, but only Choice Scarf or Substitute + Calm Mind variants.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Suicune, Gastrodon, Alomomola, and Rotom-W can also give Keldeo a hard time, as Keldeo cannot do much back to them except catch them on the switch with Focus Blast. It's worth noting that Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo can take advantage of the passive nature of most of these Pokemon by setting up freely, as Toxic or Scald burns is usually their most meaningful way of dealing with Keldeo. Suicune can be very difficult for Keldeo to face if Secret Sword is the best it can do back to it, as it has a small chance to 3HKO, meaning Suicune can, for the most part, continually use Rest and become even harder to break through as it sets up Calm Mind. Gastrodon also can break Keldeo's Substitutes with Earthquake and ensure it cannot be 2HKOed by setting up Curse alongside it. It's worth noting that Curse Gastrodon without any stat boosts risks getting 2HKOed by both Choice Specs-boosted Secret Sword and Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Tornadus-T naturally outspeeds Keldeo and OHKOes it with Hurricane; the Assault Vest set in particular is generally more consistent, as it finds more opportunities to switch in, but regardless hates being burned by Scald. Tornadus-T also can come in a few times thanks to Regenerator. While Talonflame and Mega Pinsir cannot switch in by any means, both are able revenge kill Keldeo, regardless of whether its Choice Scarf or not with Gale Wings Brave Bird and Aerilate Quick Attack, respectively, though Mega Pinsir needs quite a bit more prior damage to do so. They also cannot revenge kill Keldeo if it is behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Mega Altaria is a really solid check to Keldeo thanks to its typing in combination with Heal Bell and Roost, ensuring that it will outlast Keldeo, regardless of burns. Offensive variants of Mega Altaria, particularly Dragon Dance, are crippled by burns, while special Mega Altaria is able to bypass Keldeo's Substitute with Pixilate Hyper Voice. Clefable can also serve as a decent check, but it is extremely shaky versus its Choice Specs set, as Hydro Pump easily 2HKOes, and Scald forces Clefable to use Soft-Boiled as it switches in. After enough Calm Mind boosts, though, Keldeo fails to break past it barring critical hits and is OHKOed by a +1 Moonblast or neutered with Thunder Wave. Choice Scarf and Substitute + Calm Mind have a much harder time dealing with Clefable. Mega Gardevoir is by no means a good check to Choice Specs Keldeo, but it handles the other sets decently, especially Substitute + Calm Mind thanks to Pixilate Hyper Voice bypassing Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Thundurus, Raikou, and Mega Manectric outspeed Keldeo and OHKO it with Thunderbolt, but none of them are capable of switching in, and Mega Manectric has to be Mega Evolved prior to outspeed Keldeo; otherwise, Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump will OHKO it. All of them also fall flat to Keldeo's Choice Scarf set, as they're easily 2HKOed by the appropriate move.</p> <p><strong>Shedinja</strong>: While Shedinja isn't common by any means, it's noteworthy in that it's immune to all of the attacks on Keldeo's main movesets. To retaliate, Shedinja wears down Keldeo with Will-O-Wisp. The only way Keldeo can damage it is by using the rare Toxic or Hidden Power Flying, and even then, Shedinja is still able to scout for either of those moves by using Protect.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Keldeo's most consistent and safest move to lock into, thanks to its decent Base Power, perfect accuracy, and, more importantly, ability to potentially burn its checks, making them much easier to handle in the long term. Secret Sword has decent neutral coverage with Keldeo's Water-type STAB moves, 2HKOing Pokemon such as Serperior, Ferrothorn, and Volcanion, and is important to have to ensure Keldeo is not stopped by Chansey. Hydro Pump is used for the extra firepower on bulkier targets such as Clefable, Mew, Mega Scizor, and Jirachi. Icy Wind is used in the last slot to 2HKO Latios and Latias on the switch and subsequently knock either out the following turn due to the Speed drop. It also has important coverage on other checks such as Amoonguss, Dragonite, and Mega Altaria. Alternatively, Focus Blast, while less consistent of a STAB attack than Secret Sword, is capable of OHKOing Rotom-W after Stealth Rock, as well as 2HKOing Suicune, Gastrodon, Alomomola, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Hidden Power Electric is an option to deal heavy damage to the likes of Gyarados, Starmie, and Azumarill, as well as maintaining coverage on other Water-types, though it's quite a bit weaker than Focus Blast for several of them.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Keldeo's offensive potential, ensuring it hits as hard as possible while taking advantage of its good Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed key threats such as Mega Medicham, Mega Gardevoir, and offensive Garchomp. Choice Specs is used to turn Keldeo into a fearsome wallbreaker, at the expense of being able to switch between its moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Generally, Scald is the safest move to use early-game to fish for burns on whatever checks the opponent may have. Don't hesitate to be aggressive, though, and predict incoming switch-ins with the appropriate STAB or coverage move; otherwise, Keldeo will get forced out more often. This is something that comes into play while Spikes are on Keldeo's side of the field, as repeated switches in will quickly put it in range to being knocked out by the likes of Weavile, Bisharp, and Mega Scizor. Likewise, try to avoid status as well because this causes a similar scenario. Toxic in particular means Keldeo will be likely stalled out or pivoted around until it's knocked out. Keldeo can also be brought in via double switches or VoltTurn support to keep up offensive momentum and give more chances to weaken the opposition. Once the enemy team is weakened enough, use Scald or Secret Sword to power through anything remaining. One particularly important thing to make note of is that while Keldeo is a solid check to Dark-types, you should try to avoid directly switching into them unless absolutely necessary, as Keldeo's wallbreaking prowess is cut into significantly if its Choice Specs gets Knocked Off. This is generally something to keep in mind more versus more balanced-inclined teams, where Keldeo will need the power.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dark-types, particularly those with Pursuit, pair incredibly with Keldeo. Choice Scarf Tyranitar is the most notable, because it outspeeds Latios and Starmie and traps both fairly easily. Support variants of Tyranitar also work, as they provide Stealth Rock support as well and, with a Chople Berry, can check Mega Alakazam. Weavile is a fantastic teammate as well because it handles not only Psychic-types but also common checks to Keldeo such as Serperior, Amoonguss, and Tornadus-T. Bisharp is also a fine option, though it tends to struggle a bit more versus faster threats due to its reliance on Sucker Punch. Keldeo complements them nicely by being able to check Mega Scizor, which can prove to very troublesome for all them. The latter two also appreciate teams being weakened to the point where they can clean with their high speed and powerful priority, respectively. Heatran is a valuable teammate for its ability to handle Serperior, Amoonguss, Tangrowth, Mega Venusaur, and non-Surf Latios in one slot. Additionally, it helps wear down bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Alomomola with Toxic, making it easier for Keldeo to muscle through them, as well as provide Stealth Rock support, enabling Keldeo to achieve certain OHKOs or 2HKOs. It also gives Keldeo some extra leeway when facing Mega Scizor. In return, Keldeo helps deal with Ground-types for Heatran. Rotom-W acts as pivot towards a few of Keldeo's checks such as Tornadus, Azumarill, and Slowbro, gaining momentum off all of them with Volt Switch, thus letting Keldeo enter the field safely to get off an attack. Rotom-W also alleviates some pressure from the likes of Heatran, Bisharp, and Weavile.</p> <p>Latios complements Keldeo nicely, being able to handle Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and various passive bulky Water-types while Keldeo deals with problematic Dark-types like Tyranitar and Weavile as well as Heatran. Stored Power Mega Latias also pairs well for similar reasons, but it particularly appreciates the removal of Dark-types and the offensive pressure Keldeo applies to Clefable. Calm Mind Clefable is also a nice sweeper to pair alongside Keldeo, as it handles Latios, Electric-types, and Mega Alakazam, using all of them as setup fodder and paralyzing any potential threats while Keldeo facilitates Clefable's sweep team by eliminating key threats such as Heatran and Mega Scizor. Mega Gardevoir and Keldeo form a fearsome wallbreaking duo that dismantles many balanced teams, being able to break past the likes of Amoonguss, Slowbro, and Clefable. Electric-types such as Thundurus, Zapdos, and Mega Manectric help Keldeo better deal with bulky Water-types, barring Gastrodon, and additionally help check the likes of Talonflame and Tornadus-T, both of which outspeed and OHKO Keldeo. Tornadus-T checks many problematic Pokemon for Keldeo such as Amoonguss, Serperior, Latios, and Alakazam while being able to gain momentum versus potential Heatran, Skarmory, and Jirachi with U-turn, which Keldeo can capitalize on.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute shields Keldeo from status, letting it prey on passive Pokemon that cannot break it such as Suicune, Alomomola, and standard Heatran, as well as keeping it from being revenge killed by faster Pokemon. It also scouts what the opponent's initial switch-in may be. Calm Mind lets Keldeo become increasingly threatening, giving its attacks more firepower and making its Substitutes harder to break with special attacks. Scald is used over any other Water-type STAB due to its consistent power, ability to potentially burn checks, perfect accuracy, and high PP. Secret Sword complements Scald nicely through its coverage and ensures this set isn't walled by Chansey in particular.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Keldeo's offensive potential, ensuring that it still hits for a decent amount without any Calm Mind boosts. Maximum HP EVs over Special Attack are also an option to allow Keldeo's Substitute to not be broken by Amoonguss's Giga Drain while at +2. Just note that doing so means Keldeo will miss out on a significant amount of power, notably against the likes of Garchomp, Ferrothorn, and Clefable. A Timid nature is very important, letting Keldeo outspeed key threats such as offensive Garchomp, Mega Medicham, and Mega Charizard X. Leftovers is crucial for this set to work, helping Keldeo set up more Substitutes and alleviating chip damage like Stealth Rock or sandstorm damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set has a better matchup versus more balanced-inclined teams, so as such it should be played a bit more conservatively in order to ensure Keldeo can outlast the opposition and sweep. Keldeo should not be brought directly into Pokemon such as Heatran, Suicune, or Alomomola, as it risks getting crippled by burn, poison, or Knock Off in the case of the last, which ruins its chances of repeatedly setting up Substitute and Calm Mind. Use Substitute sparingly, as doing so too often weakens Keldeo to the point where it no longer is able to sweep and is easily picked off. Don't attempt to set up with Calm Mind while Keldeo's checks are still healthy; instead try to burn them as they switch in with Scald, increasing Keldeo's chances of breaking past them in the later stages of the match. Another thing to note is that you can use Keldeo behind a Substitute to bait a Pokemon such as Latios or Starmie to use Psyshock and subsequently bring in a Pursuit user in to trap them. Just keep in mind that the opponent can double switch into a Pokemon that can handle the Pursuit trapper, causing a loss in momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit support is a must, as without it, Keldeo has a very difficult time dealing with Latios, Latias, Starmie, and Slowking. Choice Band Tyranitar is a decent option, as it has the raw power to break through Mega Latias and Slowking. Choice Scarf also works to more reliably trap Starmie, but having Tyranitar simultaneously act as a breaker benefits Keldeo more, as this set is quite passive until it gets a couple Calm Mind boost under its belt. Mega Metagross also works well, as with the right coverage, it can weaken a good majority of Keldeo's checks and, if needed, can provide Pursuit support as well. It also helps deal with Clefable, Mega Diancie, and Mega Altaria. Lures to Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur are also very important, as Keldeo has a much easier time sweeping through the team once they're heavily weakened or eliminated. Such examples include Lansat Berry Natural Gift Breloom, Stored Power Clefable, and maximum Attack Mega Diancie. Tornadus-T is also a fine option as a more direct means of threatening Keldeo's checks. Tornadus-T can also gain switch initiative with U-turn off Heatran, giving Keldeo a free opportunity to set up a Substitute depending on the variant.</p> <p>Heatran deals with Amoonguss, Tangrowth, Mega Venusaur, and non-Surf Latios, as well as cripple bulky Water-types that tend to switch into it such as Rotom-W, Alomomola, and Gastrodon, making it easier for Keldeo to break through the opposition. Talonflame is notable for its ability to break past Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Clefable. It also wears down Water-type switch-ins with Will-O-Wisp. In return, Keldeo threatens various Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon. Keldeo also preys on bulky Water-types that don't mind status from Talonflame as much, most notably Suicune, which Keldeo can boost on and eventually break past with Secret Sword. Maximum Attack Mega Diancie applies pressure to Clefable and aids Keldeo in dealing with Flying-types such as Tornadus and Talonflame. Spikes help this Keldeo set a lot in the long term; Ferrothorn is the best option for this, as it deals with some problematic foes such as Azumarill, Latios, and Starmie, being able to set up Spikes easily on all of them. Keldeo in return threatens Heatran and sets up on non-Psychic Mew. Other breakers, such as Gengar, Excadrill, and Garchomp also aid Keldeo in dealing with some of its checks.</p>"

  "Chesnaught": {
    "overview": "<p>Chesnaught's great physical bulk allows it to shut down unprepared physical attackers such as Excadrill, Mega Lopunny, Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Terrakion. Its amazing ability Bulletproof grants it immunities to common attacks such as Shadow Ball, Gyro Ball, Focus Blast, and Sludge Bomb. Its good support movepool with Leech Seed and Spikes gives it means of supporting the team, but the biggest change to Chesnaught in ORAS has been the addition of Drain Punch. With it, Chesnaught is no longer reliant on Hammer Arm, which drops Chesnaught's Speed, and can sustain itself while also hitting the enemy for decent damage. However, it has a huge number of weaknesses that hinder its defensive prowess, especially to Flying, which is made more problematic with the prevalence of Talonflame and Mega Pinsir in the current metagame. Its poor Special Defense inhibits it even further, meaning it is weak to many common special attackers. It's also very slow, meaning it can't naturally outspeed opposing walls. It also suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, as it is limited by its move choices. Additionally, Chesnaught faces competition from Ferrothorn as a defensive Spiker, which boasts a better typing and defenses. Despite these drawbacks, Chesnaught still can be quite a threat under the correct circumstances.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Chesnaught certainly doesn't lack in other options, but several of these are niches. Stone Edge can surprise Flying-types on the switch. Substitute on the defensive set can be used to give Chesnaught a way to handle status, and it can be used in combination with Spiky Shield and Leech Seed. Roar can be used for shuffling foes and racking up entry hazard damage. Super Fang can whittle down Pokemon that Chesnaught can't damage with its usual STAB moves. Toxic is useful on more stall-based teams, and Taunt is fantastic for phazing and stopping setup sweepers. Chesnaught can use a combination of Substitute, Salac Berry, and Belly Drum to function as a sweeper, capable of setting up on common Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, and defensive Landorus-T, however, it is easily revenge killed by common Flying-types in Talonflame and Tornadus-T.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Talonflame, Staraptor, and Mega Pinsir all threaten Chesnaught with their 4x super effective STAB moves. They do not appreciate switching into Leech Seed, however.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Chesnaught still hits reasonably hard with Drain Punch; however, it can easily be shut down by faster Taunt users such as Thundurus, Mandibuzz, and Mew.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Mega Venusaur isn't affected by Leech Seed, can shrug off Drain Punch if carrying Synthesis, and deal heavy damage to Chesnaught with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-Types such as Charizard, Heatran, Volcarona, and Mega Camerupt all threaten Chesnaught with their respective STAB moves, though they don't appreciate Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Gardevoir, Sylveon, Mega Altaria, and Clefable all can take care of Chesnaught. Clefable is a good answer to Chesnaught as its Magic Guard ability negates Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Users</strong>: Magic Bounce users can deflect Spikes and Leech Seed. Mega Diancie in particular can KO Chesnaught with Moonblast. However, it fears switching into a Grass-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Mega Metagross, Mega Gallade, Latios, Latias, Slowbro, and Medicham all threaten Chesnaught with their super effective moves. Even physical attackers such as Gallade and Medicham can eliminate Chesnaught with enough damage. However, most of these Pokemon don't appreciate taking Leech Seed and Spiky Shield damage.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar can set up a Substitute, threaten to burn with Will-O-Wisp, or OHKO Chesnaught with STAB Sludge Wave.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leech Seed is Chesnaught's main form of recovery and allows it to recover a lot of HP when used in combination with Spiky Shield. Drain Punch is Chesnaught's other form of recovery. Backed by STAB and solid Attack, Drain Punch allows Chesnaught to heal itself while still dishing out damage. Spikes gives Chesnaught utility by punishing opposing Pokemon as they switch in. Chesnaught can set up multiple layers of spikes due to its high physical bulk. Wood Hammer has an impressive Base Power of 120 and is a STAB move and can be used to handle common bulky Water-types and Ground-types such as Azumarill, Hippowdon, Swampert, Quagsire, and Gastrodon. Seed Bomb can be used for its lack of recoil damage, but it has less power. Spiky Shield could also allow Chesnaught to recover more HP in conjunction with Leech Seed while also enabling it to deal chip damage, lock Choiced Pokemon into their respective moves, and enable Chesnaught to better handle Gyarados, a huge boon for a defensive wall.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs are standard for a physical tank such as Chesnaught: max Defense and HP to make it as physically bulky as possible. More Attack and Speed can be used for more offensive prowess, at the cost of some bulk. Bulletproof is far superior to Overgrow, as it gives Chesnaught some helpful immunities to common attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Leech Seed with its passive damage and health restoration makes Chesnaught a great tank. Set up Leech Seed as soon as possible. Using Leech Seed on a Pokemon that cannot hurt Chesnaught very much will probably force a switch, and said switch should be capitalized on by setting up Leech Seed or Spikes. That said, Spiky Shield is still a great move that is ideal to use against Choiced foes, such as Keldeo, to scout moves and appropriately respond. If Spiky Shield is not being run, instead use Wood Hammer to force out Pokemon such as Azumarill and Gyarados. Spikes should be used on switches that Chesnaught forces with its sheer bulk, but be wary of Defog and Rapid Spin. Instead, take advantage of these switches by using Leech Seed once more. Drain Punch should be used whenever Chesnaught can get a chance to attack, as it deals damage and gives Chesnaught some health back. When facing a boosted enemy that Chesnaught can significantly damage, such as Bisharp, don't waste your time with Leech Seed or Spikes, as using them causes Chesnaught to take unnecessary damage; go for the KO with Drain Punch. Chesnaught hates status, so try to keep it free of these afflictions. Be wary of special attackers and don't let Chesnaught stay in for long in unfavorable situations.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chansey can heal status, provide good defensive synergy, and contribute Wish support. Heatran covers all of Chesnaught's defensive weaknesses, while Chesnaught covers Heatran's weaknesses to Ground and Water. In addition, Heatran's special bulk and Chesnaught's physical bulk complement each other. Heatran can also set up Stealth Rock to weaken Flying-types and continually shuffle foes with Roar. Slowbro and Slowking work well with Chesnaught as well, although Slowking has special bulk to complement Chesnaught's physical bulk and has access to Dragon Tail for synergy with entry hazards. Rotom-W provides Chesnaught with some switch-in opportunities while covering its weaknesses as well; Rotom-W's weakness to Grass is covered by Chesnaught. Rotom-H can also fit this role. Spinblockers can be valuable to Chesnaught because having its Spikes removed by Rapid Spin would reduce its effectiveness.</p>"

  "Diggersby": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Diggersby might not look impressive with its generally low stats, its great ability Huge Power doubles its Attack stat, making it an excellent wallbreaker. Immunities to Ghost- and Electric-type attacks give it opportunities to set up and an immunity to Thunder Wave. Access to great boosting moves in Swords Dance and Agility and surprisingly great STAB coverage backed up by the elemental punches and Knock Off make Diggersby a fearsome Pokemon that all teams should prepare for. However, Diggersby is not without flaws; weaknesses to common Grass-, Ice-, and Fighting-type moves make it somewhat hard for Diggersby to effectively sweep. Lackluster Speed and bad bulk also hold Diggersby back, as it is easily revenge killed by anything that can survive a Quick Attack. Fast Pokemon such as Mega Metagross make this flaw noticeable. Diggersby's weaknesses to common priority moves such as Aqua Jet, Mach Punch, and Ice Shard are also annoying for it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A double dance set with Agility, Swords Dance, Earthquake, and Return could be used, but although Diggersby has good STAB coverage to make it work, it lacks the bulk to effectively pull it off without dual screens support. A Choice Band set could be used with the same moves as the Choice Scarf set, but it's mostly outclassed as a wallbreaker by the Swords Dance set. Diggersby can use an offensive Spikes set that takes advantage of the switches it forces to lay down Spikes and wear the opponent down. Ice Punch can be used to lure in and OHKO offensive variants of Landorus-T, while defensive variants come very close to getting OHKOed. However, variants with no HP or Defense investment already get 2HKOed by Return anyway, which is why Ice Punch is not a preferred option. Substitute is a useful move to protect Diggersby from status and could be used over Swords Dance, Fire Punch, or Knock Off. Jolly Diggersby can easily set up a Substitute on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Mew, but the move requires it to hold Leftovers for longevity, limiting Diggersby's offensive capabilities.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: As it is immune to Diggersby's STAB moves, Gengar can freely switch in against the Swords Dance set and do whatever it wants. It also puts a lot of pressure on the Choice Scarf set because Gengar gets free switches against Diggersby's STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority Attacks</strong>: Because of Diggersby's lackluster bulk, it struggles to survive strong priority attacks such as Crawdaunt and Azumarill's Aqua Jet, Mamoswine and Weavile's Ice Shard, Breloom and Conkeldurr's Mach Punch, and Talonflame's Gale Wings Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Fast Pokemon that resist Quick Attack, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Heatran, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar, can take a +2 Quick Attack pretty well and KO Diggersby rather easily in return. It should be noted that Diggersby's Choice Scarf set actually outspeeds the latter two and takes care of them very easily with a STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Although Diggersby breaks through a lot of walls, there are some defensive Pokemon Diggersby struggles with. Base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mew and Celebi can outspeed Diggersby and burn it or use Giga Drain, respectively. Landorus-T can switch into the all-out attacker and Choice Scarf sets and do huge damage back. Landorus-T is, however, not hard to wear down due to its lack of reliable recovery. Skarmory resists both of Diggersby's STAB moves, but it needs Counter to actually defeat it. Skarmory also fails to wall Fire Punch variants and can be trapped by Magnezone if its Shed Shell has been taken away. Physically defensive Mega Slowbro and Alomomola can also come in for free and can threaten Diggersby with Scald, though Alomomola cannot come in safely against Swords Dance Diggersby.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is Diggersby's primary STAB move, boasting incredible breaking power and excellent neutral coverage. Earthquake is Diggersby's other STAB move, hitting most Pokemon that resist Return hard, particularly grounded Steel-types. Quick Attack is a rather strong priority attack that makes Diggersby a legitimate threat against offensive teams. Swords Dance boosts Diggersby's Attack stat to insane levels, allowing it to 2HKO Skarmory with Life Orb-boosted Return and making Quick Attack a potent cleaning tool. However, Skarmory often carries Counter, so Fire Punch is a useful option to 2HKO it on the switch; it also OHKOes Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, which otherwise beat Diggersby 1v1.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full Attack and Speed investment maximize Diggersby's offensive capabilities. Life Orb is the preferred item to hit even harder while still being able to switch moves, but a Focus Sash can prevent Diggersby from being revenge killed or help it set up against offensive teams. It also makes Diggersby a pretty effective lead that can do a lot of damage right off the bat and potentially get some surprise KOs. An Adamant nature is preferred to do as much damage as possible and thus maximize Diggersby's wallbreaking potential. A Jolly nature can, however, be used to improve Diggersby's matchup against offensive teams by making it capable of outspeeding Breloom, Jolly Bisharp, Adamant Excadrill, most Mew variants, Timid Heatran, Adamant Dragonite, Adamant Gyarados, and Jolly Mega Tyranitar, among others. Note that both Jolly and Focus Sash are generally poor options if not running Swords Dance, as Diggersby needs all the raw power it can get without the potential to boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set works best early- or mid-game to weaken or just defeat walls for teammates to sweep later. Do not set up on anything offensive except for Choice-locked Electric- or Ghost-types, because with Diggersby's bulk it simply won't work, unless it has a Focus Sash. It is, however, easy to set up on passive Pokemon such as Chansey. A +2 Return 2HKOes Skarmory after Stealth Rock damage, and a +2 Quick Attack can OHKO or come close to OHKOing a lot of offensive Pokemon, including Mega Sceptile, Mega Gallade, Thundurus, and Tornadus-T. Even without a Swords Dance boost, a Life Orb-boosted Quick Attack can revenge kill less bulky Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Skarmory is Swords Dance Diggersby's best check on defensive teams, so Magnezone is a great teammate to remove it. Mega Pinsir and Diggersby weaken each other's counters and checks, and together with Magnezone they form a great core. If using this core, teammates with Knock Off are necessary because Skarmory always has a Shed Shell to escape from Magnezone. Examples of these would be Azumarill, Bisharp, Mamoswine, and Scizor. Pokemon that can switch into Mach Punch, Aqua Jet, and Ice Shard users such as Breloom, Crawdaunt, and Mamoswine are good teammates. Examples of these are Azumarill, Mega Venusaur, and Keldeo. While not necessary, Pursuit support from Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Weavile is useful to remove Gengar, which hard counters this set. Healing Wish support is amazing, as it lets Diggersby get a second attempt at sweeping. With it, Diggersby can wallbreak for itself early-game, and then clean up late-game. Latias is easily the best user of Healing Wish.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Diggersby's primary STAB move and the move it should be using the most outside of U-turn. Return is a secondary STAB move that hits a lot of Pokemon that are immune or resistant to Earthquake, and it is one of the reasons to use Choice Scarf Diggersby over Choice Scarf Landorus-T, the other reason being access to Wild Charge to hit Skarmory with. Knock Off hits Gengar, which is immune to both of Diggersby's STAB moves, as well as the occasional Bronzong, and is a generally good utility move with which to remove items, most notably Shed Shell from Skarmory. Wild Charge removes the need to Knock Off Skarmory's Shed Shell, as Diggersby has a good chance of 2HKOing Skarmory on the switch with Stealth Rock up. U-turn is mandatory to take advantage of any switches Diggersby causes to gain momentum. It also OHKOes Celebi, which can survive a Return.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs maximize Diggersby's damage output. 252 Speed EVs let Diggersby outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame with a Choice Scarf, with the few relevant exceptions being Mega Alakazam, Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Sceptile. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Mega Lopunny, Mega Manectric, and some slower Choice Scarf users such as Magnezone and Tyranitar; due to the high viability of Mega Lopunny in this metagame, Adamant isn't really an option. A Choice Scarf is the chosen item for this set, as it makes Diggersby capable of outspeeding and surprising many common offensive threats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Diggersby does not like being locked into either one of its STAB moves, so predict well and use U-turn a lot to prevent it from becoming setup fodder for a foe such as Mega Sableye or Landorus and to wear down Diggersby's checks and counters so it can clean up late-game with its powerful moves. With a Choice Scarf, Diggersby can be a decent revenge killer, but it is not exactly the best choice for this role, because its Speed is still not high enough to revenge kill Speed-boosting sweepers such as Gyarados and Mega Altaria, and it is defeated by strong priority attacks from Pokemon such as Azumarill and Dragonite.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>If using Wild Charge, this set baits Skarmory pretty well, so Pokemon that appreciate it being weakened or removed, such as Excadrill, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Metagross, are good teammates. Other Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Raikou and Talonflame can form a VoltTurn core with Diggersby and keep the momentum on your side. Entry hazard setters such as Heatran, Mamoswine, and Ferrothorn force foes to take hazard damage every time they switch in, making them easier to wear down for Diggersby to clean up late-game. As Choice Scarf Diggersby fails to revenge kill Speed-boosting sweepers, Pokemon such as Thundurus and Talonflame are good partners to revenge kill them instead. Powerful wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B, Mega Heracross, and Mega Pinsir can help soften up the opposing team for Diggersby to clean up. Magnezone is an obvious teammate that can remove Skarmory, one of Diggersby's best checks, once Skarmory's Shed Shell has been Knocked Off.</p>"

Talonflame also has an above-average Speed stat to use its other moves quickly, which include Swords Dance, Will-O-Wisp, and Taunt to stop entry hazards as well as status moves and setup. It does, however, struggle with Stealth Rock, which takes away 50% of its health every time it comes in. With a lack of offensive coverage and a subpar Attack stat, Talonflame can easily be dealt with by common Pokemon like Heatran, Zapdos, Rotom-W, Tyranitar, and Thundurus.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Offensive sets like Choice Band and three attacks with Sharp Beak can be run but are subpar at best. Bulk Up can also be run over Swords Dance to increase Talonflame's defensive presence.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Mega Diancie resists Talonflame's attacks and is immune to Will-O-Wisp thanks to Magic Bounce. It can also OHKO Talonflame with Diamond Storm. Tyranitar resists Talonflame's STAB moves and can threaten it back with Stone Edge, but Will-O-Wisp on the switch severely cripples it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Thundurus, Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Magnezone can all threaten Talonflame with Volt Switch or Thunderbolt. If Talonflame is not at full HP, though, it can use Roost to make these moves not super effective.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Physically defensive Water-types like Slowbro, Mega Slowbro, Alomomola, and Quagsire can take Talonflame's attacks easily while threatening it back with a super effective STAB Scald. Bulky Water-types are also likely to have Toxic, which puts Talonflame on a timer.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Garchomp can tank attacks from Talonflame and punish it with Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet or use Toxic against it. Hippowdon can take hits from Talonflame and threaten it back with a Rock Slide. Both of these Ground-types, however, do not appreciate Taunt or Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran resists Talonflame's STAB moves while also being immune to Will-O-Wisp. It can then set up Stealth Rock, which Talonflame does not appreciate, or cripple it with Toxic. However, if Talonflame has Taunt, Heatran cannot beat it.</p>",

      "Bulky Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Acrobatics is strong and does not wear Talonflame down with recoil like Brave Bird does. This lack of recoil, Roost, and Will-O-Wisp let Talonflame use Swords Dance to both sweep teams and break through defensive cores. Will-O-Wisp plus extra bulk makes it easier for Talonflame to set up Swords Dance compared to the offensive Swords Dance set. Roost and Will-O-Wisp also provide defensive utility.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs minimize the damage Talonflame takes from Stealth Rock. 8 Defense EVs allow Talonflame to always live a Thunder Punch from Mega Metagross at full HP. Alternatively, you can invest 60 Attack EVs into Speed, allowing Talonflame to outspeed Pokemon up to Jolly Excadrill. Gale Wings gives Acrobatics and Roost priority. Talonflame runs no item to double the damage from Acrobatics, and this also reduces damage from Knock Off from the likes of Bisharp and Weavile.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Talonflame's typing leaves it vulnerable to Stealth Rock, so don't send it into Stealth Rock if possible. If you must switch it in anyway, send it in on foes that can't threaten it like Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn and immediately use Roost. Use Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers like Tyranitar, Weavile, Mega Metagross, and Landorus-T, wear down checks and counters like Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Mega Tyranitar, and wear down more defensive threats like Skarmory and Ferrothorn so that they're forced to recover up more often. Once checks and counters are weakened or eliminated, use Swords Dance and priority Acrobatics to sweep or clean up teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Talonflame must have a teammate that can remove Stealth Rock for it. Starmie can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards, switch into foes like Heatran, and spread Toxic to Water-types that can threaten Talonflame like Rotom-W and Slowbro. Starmie appreciates Talonflame's ability to spread Will-O-Wisp on Pursuit users like Tyranitar and handle Grass-types like Serperior and Amoonguss. Excadrill also has access to Rapid Spin, is able to take Electric-type attacks for Talonflame, and appreciates Talonflame resisting attacks from Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona as well as Grass-types like Tangrowth and Serperior. Latios and Latias can both provide Defog support while also taking on Water- and Electric-types like Rotom-W, Slowbro, Thundurus, and Zapdos. Latios and Latias also appreciate Talonflame burning common Dark-types like Bisharp and Tyranitar. Grass-types like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Serperior are all good partners, as they can deal with Water-types that threaten Talonflame. Mega Diancie is able to offensively check Electric-types like Zapdos and Thundurus and prevent entry hazards thanks to Magic Bounce. It also appreciates Talonflame's ability to take on Grass-types like Serperior and Amoonguss as well as Steel-types like Skarmory and Ferrothorn. Clefable can act as a status absorber, provide Knock Off and Thunder Wave support to cripple the likes of Heatran, and help with Electric-types like Rotom-W.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is Talonflame's strongest Flying-type STAB move. Will-O-Wisp is used to cripple Tyranitar, Mega Metagross, Bisharp, Landorus-T, and other physical attackers. Its residual damage is also useful against foes like Thundurus, Rotom-W, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn. Roost is used to keep Talonflame healthy so it can consistently come onto the field. Swords Dance helps it break through defensive teams as well as sweep. Taunt is a viable option over Swords Dance, as it can stop recovery from the likes of Chansey, entry hazards from Pokemon like Skarmory and Ferrothorn, and setup from foes like Clefable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Gale Wings gives Talonflame priority on Brave Bird, which allows it to revenge kill and sweep teams late-game, as well as on Roost, allowing it to stall out faster foes or avoid super effective damage from Electric-type moves like Volt Switch. 248 HP EVs allow Talonflame to take the least amount of damage from Stealth Rock, 8 Defense EVs allow it to always survive a Thunder Punch from Mega Metagross, and 252 Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature allow it to take on special hits from the likes of Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, Serperior, and Clefable a lot more easily. Talonflame can also invest 60 Special Defense EVs into Speed, allowing it to outspeed Jolly Excadrill. Additionally, a more physically bulky spread can be run to better take on physical attackers such as Mega Scizor and Excadrill that lack Rock Slide.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Talonflame should avoid coming onto the battlefield if Stealth Rock is up. If it must switch into Stealth Rock, make sure it comes in on Pokemon that cannot deal too much damage to it like Leftovers Clefable, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard Y, which all can't KO Talonflame from half HP. Make sure to use Roost right after. Use Will-O-Wisp as Pokemon that check Talonflame like Thundurus, Tyranitar, Rotom-W, and Zapdos switch in to slowly whittle them down. Take advantage of this set's bulkier spread and use Swords Dance on Pokemon that cannot outdamage Roost and Leftovers, like Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, Clefable, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn. Make sure Talonflame's checks are eliminated or in range of Brave Bird before you use Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon with Rapid Spin or Defog are good partners for Talonflame given its weakness to Stealth Rock. Excadrill can use Rapid Spin and soak up Electric-type moves that threaten Talonflame. Latios and Latias can help Talonflame with its common weaknesses in Electric and Water while also removing Stealth Rock with Defog. Latios and Latias also appreciate Talonflame's ability to burn problematic Dark-types like Tyranitar and Bisharp. Starmie can help deal with the likes of Heatran, spread Toxic on Water-types like Slowbro and Rotom-W, and remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Starmie also appreciates Talonflame burning common Dark-types. Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Serperior can help deal with Water-types like Slowbro and Quagsire, and Rock-types like Mega Diancie and Choice Scarf Tyranitar resist Electric-type hits from the likes of Magnezone and Rotom-W that threaten Talonflame. Clefable can act as a status absorber, take on Electric-types like Rotom-W, and provide Knock Off and Thunder Wave support to cripple the likes of Heatran.</p>"

Swords Dance allows Talonflame to break through defensive cores and clean up or sweep teams late-game. Roost is used to keep Talonflame healthy. Flare Blitz gives coverage against Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Magnezone, Excadrill, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs allow Talonflame to outspeed base 110s, which include Latios, Latias, Mega Metagross, Mega Diancie, and Gengar. Gale Wings lets Talonflame revenge kill or clean up teams with Brave Bird as well as avoid super effective damage from Electric-type attacks via priority Roost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be sure to remove Stealth Rock before sending in Talonflame. Weaken checks like Heatran, Thundurus, Rotom-W, and Tyranitar before setting up Swords Dance. Use Swords Dance on foes that cannot threaten Talonflame like Ferrothorn, Serperior, Clefable, and Choice item users locked into a move that cannot threaten it, like Magnezone locked into Flash Cannon or Hidden Power Fire. Take advantage of Gale Wings to revenge kill as well as strike before faster foes like Mega Lopunny, Tornadus-T, Serperior, and Weavile.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is best used on a more offensive team archetype like hyper offense. Talonflame requires teammates that can remove entry hazards; Excadrill can use Rapid Spin as well as absorb Electric-type attacks for Talonflame. Starmie also has access to Rapid Spin, and it checks Talonflame checks like Heatran and Hippowdon. Latios can provide Defog support while also handling Water- and Electric-type attacks. Latias shares Latios's advantages and can also provide Healing Wish support for Talonflame. Mega Pinsir can weaken Talonflame's checks and counters, as they share similar switch-ins, like Rotom-W, Thundurus, Zapdos, and Mega Diancie. Manaphy can take on Talonflame checks like Heatran, Hippowdon, and Tyranitar while also appreciating Talonflame's ability to take on Grass-types like Ferrothorn.</p>"

  "Doublade": {
    "overview": "<p>After the Aegislash ban, many powerful wallbreakers that Aegislash stopped now roam free without having to run additional coverage to get past it. By virtue of its typing and natural bulk, Doublade fills the void left by Aegislash's departure. Its ability to beat the likes of Mega Heracross, Mega Medicham, and Mega Gardevoir makes it a popular choice on stall teams. The fact that the metagame stopped preparing for its defensive typing after the Aegislash ban, such as Mega Medicham forfeiting Fire Punch and Mega Pinsir, Mega Heracross, and Terrakion forfeiting Earthquake, gives Doublade the ability to completely stop a few important threats. Its immunity to trapping is a huge advantage over the likes of Ferrothorn and Skarmory, which need to run Shed Shell to avoid Magnet Pull from breaking them down. Unfortunately, Doublade's ability No Guard makes all moves used against it, notably Hydro Pump, Fire Blast, and Will-O-Wisp, always hit. Doublade's Special Defense stat is also very mediocre, meaning it gets worn down by a few things it is supposed to counter, namely Mega Gardevoir, Latias, and Latios. Doublade also suffers from a lack of recovery apart from Rest, making it require Heal Bell support to function efficiently and wall threats consistently.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Doublade doesn't have many options in its arsenal, but Shadow Sneak is usable for finishing off weakened opponents such as Mega Medicham and Mega Gardevoir and dealing chip damage before Doublade gets OHKOed. A Swords Dance set with Shadow Sneak, Sacred Sword, and a coverage move with an EV spread of 128 HP / 116 Atk / 48 Def / 216 SpD and a Sassy nature could work, as Doublade forces many switches; however, it's easily revenge killed by Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Talonflame, and it's easily walled by common Ground-types and physical walls.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bisharp</strong>: Bisharp threatens Doublade with Pursuit and Knock Off and doesn't mind Gyro Ball or Toxic, but it must be careful not to switch into Sacred Sword.</p> <p><strong>Mandibuzz</strong>: Mandibuzz dislikes Toxic, but it walls Doublade and can wear it down with Foul Play, remove its Eviolite with Knock Off, or even Taunt it so it can't use Rest.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, Thundurus, and Manectric are some special attackers that force Doublade out, however, they must be wary of switching into Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Gliscor walls Doublade completely and while Landorus-T and Hippowdon don't like to switch into Toxic, they can tank any of Doublade's hits and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur don't care about Doublade at all, and they can threaten it with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Heatran is immune to Toxic and takes negligible damage from Gyro Ball, while Sacred Sword can't even 2HKO it. Skarmory and Ferrothorn can't do much damage to Doublade, but Doublade can't do much to them either, and they can set up Stealth Rock, use Leech Seed, or phaze Doublade.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Talonflame, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y take negligible damage from Doublade's attacks and can proceed to destroy it or set up on it for free; however, they also dislike Toxic.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gyro Ball is a strong STAB move that deals a lot of damage to the threats Doublade counters. Toxic cripples common switch-ins such as Mega Charizard X and Y, Talonflame, Mega Manectric, and bulky Ground- and Water-types. Sleep Talk is useful so Doublade will not be complete setup bait after using Rest, while Sacred Sword is mainly for Bisharp, which would otherwise threaten Doublade, and to hit Heatran and Magnezone on the switch. Pursuit traps the likes of Celebi, Latias, and Latios. Rest is the only recovery Doublade gets and should only be used when Doublade gets weakened; it also cures its status.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread and an Eviolite allow Doublade to take on Mega Gardevoir reliably, as Doublade is already physically bulky enough to take on Mega Pinsir, Mega Medicham, Mega Heracross, Terrakion, Hawlucha, Lucario, and Breloom. A Sassy nature and a 0 Speed IVs maximizes Gyro Ball's power, allowing Doublade to score crucial OHKOs and 2HKOs on the threats it checks or counters.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Doublade has an average Special Defense stat, so only switch in on resisted special attacks. Use Toxic early in the game, as Doublade forces many switches, and be careful around Pursuit trappers. Try to avoid getting worn down by certain threats if you also need Doublade to take on other ones. For example, don't switch it in on Latios if there is also a Mega Gardevoir on the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Doublade appreciates cleric support, so pairing it up with Chansey, Sylveon, or Clefable is a good idea. Doublade needs to be paired with a counter to wallbreakers that beat it, such as Mega Charizard Y and Crawdaunt, because they can take advantage of it very easily and threaten the rest of your team. Chansey and Chesnaught, respectively, are options that cover them. Doublade should also be paired up with an additional check to Mega Gardevoir, as it cannot always take it on on its own, so Jirachi makes for a good partner. Bisharp is a big threat to Doublade, so checks such as Chesnaught and Mega Charizard X are amazing partners. Mega Charizard X also enjoys Slowbro and Landorus-T getting hit by Toxic and takes on stallbreakers such as Mew and Gengar. Heatran also pairs up well with Doublade because it is able to switch into Mega Gardevoir's Hyper Voice, motivating it to use Focus Blast, which gives Doublade an easier time switching into it the next turn. It also takes on Hidden Power Fire Latios and Mega Charizard X without Earthquake. Checks to Keldeo and Mega Charizard X such as Mega Venusaur and Slowbro, respectively, are recommended, as they can come in easily on Doublade.</p>"

  "Dragalge": {
    "overview": "<p>Based on stats alone, there are much more powerful specially based available Dragon-types such as Latios and Latias; why would you use a Pokemon with a mere base 97 Special Attack? Furthermore, Dragalge is the slowest fully evolved Dragon-type in the game. Alongside its defensive typing, and in the context of the OU metagame, this means it has to worry about being revenge killed by many top-tier threats, including Mega Charizard X, Excadrill, Landorus-T, Mega Alakazam, Mega Medicham, and Latios.</p> <p>However, by virtue of that same defensive typing, Dragalge is able to find a place on many teams as a tank, capable of handling many common threats, including Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, Gengar, Clefable, Manaphy, Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Mega Venusaur. Regardless of the set, Dragalge's ability Adaptability (which bolsters the power of its STAB moves by a total factor of 2), is a great boon. Dragalge is also able to differentiate itself from other Dragon-types thanks to its access to STAB Sludge Wave, which powers through many common Fairy-types, including Clefable, as well as its secondary Poison typing, which renders it neutral to Fairy-type moves to which Latios or Latias would fall. Dragalge also provides additional utility with Toxic Spikes, which allows it to cut into the longevity of foes such as Substitute Calm Mind Keldeo. However, do not assume Dragalge needs Toxic Spikes to function; it can also use a devastating Choice Specs set capable of achieving feats such as OHKOing Mew, Keldeo, and Zapdos.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Haze is a really great move for any set lacking Choice Specs, as it eases the checking or countering of many setup sweepers, including Clefable, Mega Sableye, Volcarona, and Keldeo, by reducing their stat gains as well as bringing Dragalge's Special Attack back to normal after using Draco Meteor. RestTalk can be useful on defensive sets whose teams don't desire Toxic Spikes. The RestTalk combination allows Dragalge to constantly heal off status as well as damage taken, and therefore lets Dragalge be a much more reliable counter to Mega Charizard Y, Rotom-W, and Gengar. Toxic poisons potential switch-ins to defensive sets, such as Talonflame, that are immune to Toxic Spikes. Dragon Tail hits nowhere near as hard as Dragalge's other Dragon-type STAB moves, but it can be useful for its ability to phaze foes. It can work well in tandem with Toxic Spikes, spreading the poisoned or badly poisoned statuses to grounded foes. Hydro Pump is an alternative for the fourth slot on the Choice Specs set. Basically, it does more damage to specially defensive Heatran than Scald does while having better accuracy than Focus Blast. Sludge Bomb is a possibility over Sludge Wave; it trades 5 Base Power and the ability to hit Chesnaught for a 20% increase in the chance to poison. Venoshock hits very hard against poisoned foes, which makes it pair well with sets involving Toxic Spikes, but against targets that aren't poisoned it's very weak. Substitute can be useful, as if used on the switch it allows Dragalge to do massive damage to the foe that is forced to break the Substitute. It, however, must be used in lieu of Scald, a STAB move, or Toxic Spikes, which are all extremely important to any set's success.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types resist Dragon-type moves and are immune to Poison-type moves, so naturally they make for the best checks and counters to Dragalge. Klefki is immune to both of Dragalge's STAB types, loses half of its health at most from a Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power Fire, and can use Dragalge for Spikes setup. Jirachi takes little from any of Dragalge's attacks, can use Wish to heal off any damage taken and can threaten with its STAB super effective Zen Headbutt. Mega Metagross and Assault Vest Metagross can tank any hit and threaten Dragalge with a STAB Zen Headbutt. Mega Metagross and Metagross must, however, be wary of Scald burns. Specially defensive Heatran can easily switch into Dragalge's STAB moves. Mega Scizor can switch into any move except for Hidden Power Fire and Roost off the damage. It must, however, be wary of Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey</strong>: Blissey and Chansey avoid the 2HKO from a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor, so both can switch in and subsequently force Dragalge out.</p>",

      "Offensive Toxic Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is an obscenely powerful STAB move that hits everything except Fairy- and Steel-types neutrally. If setting Toxic Spikes isn't ideal at the time, you should generally use this move, because it'll hit almost all switch-ins very hard. Sludge Wave complements Draco Meteor, as it hits Fairy-types super effectively. Additionally, Dragalge is neutral to Fairy-type moves, and thus can switch in on many Fairy-types and destroy them with Sludge Wave. Focus Blast covers the Steel-types that Dragalge's STAB moves cannot, such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp. However, Hidden Power Fire can be used if you'd prefer having better accuracy and the ability to hit Mega Scizor and don't mind not being able to handle Heatran. Toxic Spikes spreads the poisoned or badly poisoned status to all grounded foes, which greatly benefits your team by inhibiting opposing setup Pokemon, including Unaware Clefable and Substitute Keldeo.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>28 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Hippowdon, which would otherwise 2HKO with Earthquake. Maximum Special Attack EVs are used so that Dragalge can hit as hard as possible, and the rest of the EVs are put in HP so that Dragalge has good mixed bulk. 140 Speed EVs, at the expense of HP, can be used if you need Dragalge to outspeed Clefable, hitting it with a powerful Sludge Wave before it can use Calm Mind, or Tyranitar, so that Dragalge can hit it with Focus Blast. If Dragalge is using Hidden Power Fire, Tyranitar isn't necessary to outspeed, so only 136 Speed EVs would be needed. Draco Plate is typically the item of choice, as it boosts the power of Dragalge's most-used move, Draco Meteor, by 1.2 without causing recoil. However, if this extra damage is not needed, Black Sludge also is a great choice, as it gives Dragalge the passive recovery needed to switch into Pokemon less riskily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Dragalge's amazing defensive typing to switch into numerous Pokemon, including Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, Clefable, Manaphy, Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, Magnezone, Thundurus, and Mega Venusaur. Once in, Dragalge can either use its offensive or defensive advantage to set up Toxic Spikes, which greatly hurts your opponent's grounded setup sweepers' chances of setting up, or fire off powerful moves. Draco Meteor, especially when boosted by Draco Plate, is immensely powerful, and it lets Dragalge do as much damage as possible to threats such as Raikou, Keldeo, Mew, and Rotom-W. However, Sludge Wave is more consistent and should be used both when the Draco Meteor's Special Attack cut is unappealing and in order to stop a Clefable sweep. Basically, your mentality when using Dragalge should be to decide when it's right to attack and when it's right to set up Toxic Spikes. Be wary of using Toxic Spikes when you know Dragalge won't be able to get up a second layer, as that could result in having many foes being poisoned instead of badly poisoned, which isn't ideal because the goal is to wear them down rather than apply more short-term chip damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone can trap Steel-types such as Jirachi, which are very troublesome for Dragalge to face, even considering its access to Focus Blast. Grounded Poison-types, such as Amoonguss and Tentacruel, remove Dragalge's Toxic Spikes, so Reuniclus, which can set up on them, and Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Mega Alakazam, which can revenge kill them, make for good teammates. Physical wallbreakers such as Victini and Heracross can also prove to be spectacular teammates for their ability to demolish Chansey. Because Psychic-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Latios can easily revenge kill Dragalge, a Pursuit trapper such as Tyranitar can make for a great teammate. Mega Metagross can also be a great teammate because it can check many of these bulky Psychic-types, including Gardevoir and Latios.</p> <p>Ferrothorn can prove to be a spectacular teammate, as it resists or can usually switch in on the Dragon-, Ice-, and Ground-types moves Dragalge is weak to, while Dragalge can switch into the Fire- and Fighting- type moves Ferrothorn is weak to. Add this to Ferrothorn's access to Spikes and Stealth Rock, and the two can make a great entry hazard-setting defensive pair for balanced and bulky offensive teams. Dragalge is prone to being revenge killed by Ground-types, such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Landorus, so to remedy this weakness, Rotom-W, Mandibuzz, and Manaphy can serve as great teammates. Teams that this Dragalge variant is a part of often rely, to a varying degree, on Toxic Spikes to function. If these entry hazards get Defogged or spun away, the team loses a substantial part of its wincon. Bisharp can add offensive pressure in an effort to prevent Defog, and it also boasts a fair matchup against two premier Defoggers, Latios and Latias, while Ghost-types such as Mega Sableye can act as Rapid Spin blockers.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Despite not running Special Attack EVs, Dragalge still can hit very hard with Draco Meteor, which has great neutral coverage and OHKOes Gengar after considering Stealth Rock or Life Orb damage. Dragon Pulse is another viable option, which is substantially weaker but doesn't force Dragalge out after its use. It relegates Sludge Wave as Dragalge's most powerful move, if chosen over Draco Meteor, and therefore Dragon Pulse should only be used against Dragon- and Ground-types on the switch, as well as on Gengar. Be wary that unlike Draco Meteor, Dragon Pulse can never OHKO Gengar. However, Dragon Pulse performs better against Substitute variants of Gengar and is overall more consistent than Draco Meteor. Sludge Wave is a complementary STAB move to Dragalge's Dragon-type STAB move of choice, as it hits Fairy-types such as Clefable. The move is also useful for stinging Grass-types such as Celebi and Serperior much more than Draco Meteor. Scald hits Steel-types, which resist or are immune to Dragalge's STAB moves, neutrally and has a very useful burn chance, which can allow Dragalge to stay in relatively comfortably on physical attackers that would otherwise force it out. It's also a good move to use on a predicted switch, as almost nothing can switch into Scald without risking a burn. Toxic Spikes spreads the poisoned or badly poisoned status to all grounded foes and is especially useful for stopping setup sweepers such as Quiver Dance Volcarona, Calm Mind Keldeo, and Calm Mind Unaware Clefable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>28 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Hippowdon, which would otherwise outspeed and 2HKO with Earthquake. 248 EVs are put in HP for maximum mixed walling potential, and the rest are put in Special Defense, as Dragalge should opt to specialize in walling specially based Pokemon. Black Sludge is used for constant recovery, which ameliorates Dragalge's chances of countering Pokemon such as Gengar when factoring in Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Despite its low HP, Dragalge is remarkably specially bulky, and you should exploit this by switching into Pokemon Dragalge's typing can handle. Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, Clefable, Manaphy, Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, Magnezone, Thundurus, and Mega Venusaur are all examples of Pokemon that Dragalge easily can switch into. Additionally, with the added bulk, Dragalge becomes a safe (but not foolproof) counter to Life Orb Gengar, which is remarkably hard to check. The name of the game with defensive Dragalge is getting into something that it can handle. If it hard walls the foe (in the case of Mega Venusaur, for example), Dragalge should set up Toxic Spikes in order to cripple the opponent's team, and if it can't completely counter the foe but can do immense damage (such as with Gengar and Draco Meteor), Dragalge should go for the KO. However, in most scenarios, your primary goal with Dragalge shouldn't be to attack, as Toxic Spikes will often prove to be more essential as your team's win condition.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Opposing Poison-types remove Toxic Spikes, so useful teammates include Reuniclus to set up on them and Landorus-T as well as Life Orb Alakazam to revenge kill them. Strong physical wallbreakers such as Mega Heracross and Victini as well as utility Mega Sableye with Taunt and Knock Off can also deal with Chansey. Mega Sableye doubles as a way to protect Dragalge's Toxic Spikes from being spun away, and the same can be said for Bisharp and the entry hazards being Defogged away. Because of their defensive synergy and entry hazard coverage, Dragalge and Ferrothorn make for great teammates on defensive teams. Dragalge is prone to being revenge killed by Ground-types such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Landorus, so to aid this problem, Rotom-W, Mandibuzz, and Manaphy can serve as great teammates. Psychic-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Latios can easily revenge kill Dragalge. A Pursuit trapper such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar can thus make for a great teammate. Mega Metagross can also check many bulky Psychic-types, including Gardevoir and Latios.</p>"

Thanks to the move's massive 130 Base Power, Adaptability boost, and Choice Specs boost, it is able to do a massive amount of damage to anything but Fairy-types, Chansey, and Blissey. It's able to OHKO frailer Steel-types such as Bisharp as well as 252 / 0 Mew after Stealth Rock damage. Fairy-types, the absolute best switch-ins to Draco Meteor, are, barring Klefki, annihilated by Dragalge's secondary STAB move, Sludge Wave. Sludge Wave also gives Dragalge a much more reliable STAB move with which it can hit both Grass-types and neutral targets hard without having to suffer from Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop. Focus Blast allows Dragalge to hit common Steel-type switch-ins, such as Ferrothorn, Bisharp, and Heatran as well as Tyranitar. However, if you don't mind being worse off against Heatran, and would much rather have better accuracy and the ability to demolish Mega Scizor, Hidden Power Fire can be used in lieu of Focus Blast. Scald lets Dragalge check Heatran, mostly if Dragalge isn't running Focus Blast. Scald doubles as a move with almost no drawbacks, and it can be used early-game to fish for a burn on some of Dragalge's most common switch-ins, such as Klefki, Jirachi, and Mega Metagross.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>In order to outspeed Hippowdon, which would otherwise cripple Dragalge with Earthquake, it's recommended for Dragalge to run 28 Speed EVs. Because Dragalge is a specially based wallbreaker, maximum Special Attack EVs are used. Likewise, Choice Specs is the recommended item for the set, as it is capable of boosting all of Dragalge's moves to their highest possible power. The remaining EVs are thrown into HP because Dragalge enjoys having mixed bulk. 140 Speed EVs, at expense of HP, can be used if you desire Dragalge to outspeed Calm Mind Clefable and Tyranitar so that Dragalge can hit them with Sludge Wave or Focus Blast, respectively. If Dragalge is using Hidden Power Fire, only 136 Speed EVs would be needed, as outspeeding Tyranitar wouldn't be a priority.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dragalge has excellent special bulk, respectable physical bulk, and a unique defensive typing; exploit all of these characteristics! Dragalge can easily pivot into many threatening Pokemon in OU, including Keldeo, Mega Charizard Y, Rotom-W, Mega Manectric, Raikou, Clefable, and Thundurus; tank a hit; and proceed to fire off a ridiculously powerful move on whatever decides to switch in. The majority of the time, the only button you'll be clicking is Draco Meteor, but if the opponent has bulky Steel- or Fairy-types, more prediction will be necessary. Don't be too shy about using Sludge Wave; despite its lower power compared to Draco Meteor, it still can accomplish absurd feats such as OHKOing Keldeo after factoring in Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Despite Dragalge's access to Focus Blast, Hidden Power Fire, and Scald, it is still going to have immense troubles with Steel-types. Magnezone is an excellent partner for its trapping ability. Dragalge's low Speed and four common weaknesses also leave it prone to being revenge killed. For instance, Psychic-types, such as Mega Gardevoir and Latios, can easily KO Dragalge after Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop. A Pursuit trapper, such as Tyranitar, is thus a useful teammate. Mega Metagross also makes for a great teammate because of its ability to check both Mega Gardevoir and Latios. Finally, Dragalge is prone to being revenge killed by Excadrill; to remedy this weakness, Rotom-W and Celebi can serve as great teammates.</p> <p>Trick Room staples such as Bronzong, Cresselia, Porygon2, and Crawdaunt can make for good teammates as well, as Dragalge's terrible Speed stat, while normally a huge flaw, can allow it to sweep under Trick Room. Defensive cores are also plausible, as Dragalge, even without any Special Defense investment, has solid bulk and a great typing. Skarmory resists all of Dragalge's weaknesses except Ice, while Dragalge resists both of Skarmory's weaknesses. Needless to say, these two work really well together, with Dragalge able to deal out serious damage and act as a generic check to special attackers and Skarmory acting as a mixed wall capable of setting and removing entry hazards. Unaware Clefable also can make for a good teammate, as it can heal off any damage Dragalge might take with Wish. It also can serve as a lure for Poison-type moves, which gives Dragalge opportunities to switch in, and heal off any burns Dragalge might have taken with Heal Bell. Other Fairy-types, including Azumarill, Gardevoir, and Sylveon, can similarly lure in Poison-types for Dragalge to switch into. Mega Gyarados also can make for a good teammate; Dragalge can KO Keldeo, Dragon-types, Azumarill, Chesnaught, and Ferrothorn for Mega Gyarados, while Mega Gyarados can set up on Ground-types and Heatran, both of which give Dragalge trouble. Mega Diancie also makes for a good teammate, as it and Dragalge have a lot of checks in common and therefore can break down the other Pokemon's answers. Dragalge baits in and wears down Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, which opens up the opportunity to sweep for Diancie. In turn, Diancie can take on Jirachi and Heatran better than Dragalge can thanks to its access to Earth Power.</p>"

  "Klefki": {
    "overview": "<p>Klefki's wide support movepool, which includes Spikes, Thunder Wave, and dual screens, coupled with Prankster allow it to function as a very effective support Pokemon. Its Steel / Fairy typing gives it numerous resistances and immunities to common attacking types, allowing it to check threats such as Mega Gardevoir, Mega Pinsir, Latios, and Weavile. Notably, Prankster Thunder Wave allows Klefki to act as a catch-all stop to most setup sweepers. Klefki has access to Magnet Rise, which gives it the ability to avoid Ground-type attacks for five turns, which alleviates one of its only two weaknesses. Unfortunately, Klefki has subpar stats overall and lacks significant offensive presence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flash Cannon OHKOes Mega Diancie, which bounces back Klefki's Spikes and status moves, takes little from Foul Play and Play Rough, and can use Klefki as setup fodder. Magic Coat bounces back opposing entry hazards and status moves. Heal Block prevents defensive Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Hippowdon, and Chansey from using recovery moves. Switcheroo is an alternate way of disrupting offensive Pokemon by giving them a Choice item, status orb, or crippling their Speed with a Lagging Tail.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Excadrill</strong>: Excadrill can come in on any of Klefki's moves with impunity and proceed to spin away entry hazards or hit Klefki with a super effective Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Thundurus, Mega Gardevoir, and Gengar prevent Klefki from using its support moves such as Spikes, Thunder Wave, Light Screen, and Reflect. However, the latter two are severely crippled by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Defensive Pokemon such as Heatran, Hippowdon, Rotom-W, Gliscor, and Slowbro are major nuisances for Klefki due to its lack of offensive presence. Gliscor gets a notable mention, as it is not affected by either Thunder Wave or Toxic and shrugs off Foul Play and Play Rough thanks to its great Defense.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Offensive Pokemon such as Keldeo, Thundurus, Mega Metagross, Azumarill, and Talonflame can break through Klefki with repeated hits, although most of them are crippled by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Pokemon with Magic Bounce, particularly Mega Diancie, bounce back Klefki's Spikes and status moves, can easily take most of Klefki's attacks, and use Klefki as setup fodder.

      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes quickly rack up damage on grounded Pokemon, and Klefki finds many opportunities to set them up due to its great defensive typing. Thunder Wave cripples offensive Pokemon and halts setup sweepers such as Mega Pinsir and Mega Gyarados. Magnet Rise allows Klefki to avoid Ground-type attacks from Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Excadrill, and Landorus-T. Toxic is an alternate choice to hit Ground- and Electric-types, which are immune to Thunder Wave, such as Hippowdon, Thundurus, and Raikou. Play Rough ensures that Klefki is not completely shut down by Taunt, and it has good neutral coverage overall. Foul Play hits Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Jirachi, Excadrill, and non-Mega Gyarados.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full HP investment is used to maximize Klefki's solid bulk, and a Careful nature and the Special Defense investment allows it to better take hits from the likes of Starmie, Keldeo, Thundurus, Gengar, and Mega Gardevoir. A Calm nature should be used with Foul Play, as preserving Klefki's Attack stat is not needed with Foul Play. Alternatively, a physically defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD and a Bold nature can be used to handle threats such as Weavile, Dragon Dance Mega Altaria, Mega Lopunny, and Azumarill. Leftovers provide passive recovery, while a Sitrus Berry gives Klefki immediate recovery when it reaches low HP, giving it more opportunities to set up layers of Spikes. Prankster gives priority to all of Klefki's status moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Klefki should pivot into resisted or immune attacks from Pokemon such as Latios, Weavile, Mega Altaria, and Gengar. Klefki should set up layers of Spikes early on when it forces switches into a Ground- or Electric-type trying to absorb a Thunder Wave or against a paralyzed foe. Magnet Rise should be used versus Ground-types such as Mamoswine and Landorus-T to avoid their attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Klefki is a great team supporter and fairly self-sufficient Pokemon, although there are many offensive Pokemon that appreciate its support. Pokemon whose checks and counters are grounded Pokemon, and are thus worn down by Klefki's Spikes, such as Mega Sharpedo, Mega Gyarados, and Scizor make for good teammates. Pokemon with Defiant such as Thundurus or Bisharp deter the use of Defog to clear Klefki's Spikes, but are not always necessary due to how Klefki puts immense pressure on the two most common Defog users, Latios and Latias. Water-types such as Keldeo and Gyarados are good teammates to handles the Fire-types that trouble Klefki.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Reflect and Light Screen give Klefki's teammates invaluable support by significantly decreasing the damage from opposing Pokemon's attacks. This support is extremely helpful for setup sweepers that rely on taking an attack and boosting. Fairy Lock prevents both Pokemon in play from switching out in the turn that it is used, which is helpful when Klefki is about be KOed so a teammate can use the opposing Pokemon as setup bait or to just fire off an attack. Foul Play prevents Klefki from being Taunt and setup bait from the likes of Thundurus, Talonflame, Mega Scizor, and Mega Charizard X. Spikes are a great entry hazard that quickly rack up damage on grounded Pokemon, but Klefki struggles to fit them on this set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment is important to take hits while setting up screens, and a Calm nature helps against the likes of Taunt users such as Gengar, Thundurus, and Mega Gardevoir. Light Clay increases the duration of Light Screen and Reflect. Prankster gives priority to all of Klefki's support moves, particularly Light Screen and Reflect. A physically defensive EV spread can be used to lessen the damage taken from physical attacks and Psyshock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set works best as a lead for offensive teams to quickly set up Light Screen and Reflect for setup sweepers. If the opponent has a more physically oriented team, then it is more useful to set up Reflect, and if they have a more specially oriented team, then Light Screen is better. Fairy Lock should be used when Klefki is about to be KOed so a teammate can either set up on or KO the trapped Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Klefki is fairly self-sufficient, and it usually provides more team support than it needs in return. Setup sweepers such as Scizor, Azumarill, Landorus-T, and Mega Charizard X are excellent teammates that appreciate the screens that Klefki provides. Pokemon with Defiant such as Bisharp and Thundurus deter the use of Defog from the likes of Latios and Latias, which would waste Klefki's efforts by getting rid of the screens.</p>"

  "Diancie": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Diancie is one of OverUsed's most dangerous Mega Evolutions courtesy of its unique typing, efficient coverage, and critical Speed tier. With its high offensive stats and powerful STAB moves, Mega Diancie can threaten both physical and special walls effectively. Additional coverage in the form of Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire lets it handle many of the common Pokemon that can stomach its STAB attacks. Defensively, Diancie's typing grants it resistances to Fire, Flying, and Dark as well as an immunity to Dragon, letting it check non-Earthquake Mega Charizard X and Dragonite and take crucial attacks such as Talonflame and Volcarona's boosted STAB moves, Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack, and Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Mega Diancie's Speed is one of its most important traits, letting it get the jump on threatening Pokemon that hover on and around the crowded base 100 Speed tier, such as Garchomp, Manaphy, Keldeo, and unboosted Volcarona, as well as Speed tie with Latios and Latias. Magic Bounce allows Mega Diancie to deny entry hazards with proper prediction and shield itself from status moves such as Heatran's Toxic and Taunt, Clefable's Thunder Wave, and Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp. However, Mega Diancie is burdened with mediocre bulk, and its typing gives it weaknesses to common Water-, Steel-, Grass-, and Ground-type moves, making revenge killers such as Serperior, Weavile, Mega Lopunny, Mega Scizor, and Mega Metagross adept at picking it off. Additionally, Mega Diancie's lack of reliable recovery means it struggles to take strong repeated hits from Pokemon it wants to check, particularly Tornadus-T. Diancie's low Speed before Mega Evolving is also a concern, forcing it to run Protect and forfeit valuable coverage or utility options in order to render its Speed usable the next turn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ice lets Mega Diancie blitz through Landorus-T after Stealth Rock and deal huge damage to Gliscor, which otherwise is able to stall out Moonblasts with Roost. However, Hidden Power Ice is best used alongside Protect due to increased emphasis on scouting Landorus-T's set and greatly increases Diancie's reliance on teammates like Volcarona and Magnezone to handle Steel-types. Calm Mind can let Mega Diancie overwhelm checks such as Clefable and Alomomola and soak up hits from faster Pokemon such as Latios and Thundurus. Unfortunately, this is an extremely niche option because it comes at the cost of Protect, making Diancie painfully easy to revenge kill, and the loss of Diamond Storm makes it far more difficult to break special walls and check key Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y. In addition, Calm Mind Mega Diancie can still struggle in one-on-one situations with checks that can offensively pressure it such as Gliscor, Chansey, Jirachi, and Amoonguss. Rock Polish gives Mega Diancie the potential to sweep weakened offensive teams on paper, but this is also a subpar option, as it fails to help it against defensive checks and still leaves Diancie completely vulnerable to Bullet Punch and Aqua Jet users. In addition, like Calm Mind, it occupies a valuable moveslot in which Diancie would prefer to carry an important coverage or utility option. Though it can be similarly difficult to fit, Heal Bell lets Diancie offer more team support by acting as a cleric, ridding its teammates of burns from the Scalds that they may have switched into for Diancie.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Mega Metagross outspeeds Hidden Power Fire Mega Diancie, can take an Earth Power, and OHKOes Diancie with a Steel-type STAB move. Jirachi can also take a hit and strike back with Iron Head. Skarmory and Mega Scizor switch into Mega Diancie lacking Hidden Power Fire, and the latter OHKOes it with Bullet Punch. Ferrothorn can take a STAB move followed by Hidden Power Fire from full health and OHKO Diancie back with Gyro Ball. Magnezone survives any one hit from Diancie barring Earth Power and dispatches it with Flash Cannon. While it is OHKOed by Moonblast, Mega Medicham is known to run Bullet Punch to OHKO Mega Diancie before it can strike back, so tread carefully when facing it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Gastrodon and Jellicent check Mega Diancie decently well if they are healthy, recovering off Moonblasts and dealing huge damage back with Earthquake and Scald. Suicune survives any two hits after Stealth Rock and as such makes for a decent check, but its lack of reliable recovery is a concern. Though they also crumble to repeated blows, Rotom-W and Manaphy each can take a hit and KO Mega Diancie in return. Azumarill and Crawdaunt can revenge kill Mega Diancie with Choice Band-boosted Aqua Jet after some prior damage, but only the former is able to endure a Moonblast. Slowbro can force damage on Mega Diancie in a pinch, but it struggles greatly to take Moonblast. Slowking does not have this problem due to its higher special bulk, making it an excellent check.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth switch into Mega Diancie reliably and threaten it with their Grass-type STAB moves, and they can do so multiple times over the course of the game thanks to Regenerator. Mega Venusaur is an even stronger counter, taking all of Mega Diancie's common moves with ease and healing any damage taken with Synthesis.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Chansey is extremely difficult for Mega Diancie to overcome, as it can take Mega Diancie's hits quite easily with Eviolite intact and 3HKO in return with Seismic Toss. Specially defensive Gliscor can stall out Moonblast with Roost and threaten major damage with Earthquake, but Moonblast can 2HKO it with Stealth Rock up and Hidden Power Ice will nearly OHKO it. Specially defensive Hippowdon and Alomomola can take two hits unless Spikes are up, but Hippowdon must be cautious of Magic Bounce returning its Toxic or Whirlwind, and Alomomola does little damage back with its weak Scald. Specially defensive Excadrill is an especially notable check, surviving a Moonblast followed by an Earth Power and OHKOing Diancie back or setting up Stealth Rock thanks to Mold Breaker.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Serperior and Starmie are excellent offensive checks that force Mega Diancie out. The former can then take the opportunity to set up with Substitute or Leaf Storm, while the latter can heal or fire off a Scald. Weavile, Life Orb Thundurus, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Alakazam also outspeed and deal huge damage to Mega Diancie, but none of them can OHKO Mega Diancie without prior damage, and it can OHKO all of them in return. Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T are able to revenge kill Mega Diancie, but Mega Diancie can scout their chosen move with Protect and act accordingly.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Protect lets Diancie Mega Evolve safely and circumvent its low Speed before Mega Evolution. Protect also serves a number of other purposes, helping Diancie effectively scout Choice item users such as Azumarill, Landorus-T, and Weavile, discerning whether Mega Medicham carries Bullet Punch, and forcing mind games with Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick. Moonblast is Mega Diancie's strongest and most reliable STAB move, hitting most neutral targets very hard. Diamond Storm helps Mega Diancie act as a mixed attacker, dishing out respectable damage to specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey and Slowking while destroying key Fire- and Flying-types such as Tornadus-T, Volcarona, and Charizard. The Defense boost it often provides is also notable, potentially coming into play against revenge killers such as Crawdaunt and Weavile. Earth Power is Mega Diancie's best coverage option to threaten important Steel-types, most importantly securing the 2HKO on any variant of Excadrill and Mega Metagross while obliterating Heatran, Magnezone, and Bisharp. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire can 2HKO Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. However, using the latter lowers Mega Diancie's Speed IV, forfeiting the Speed tie against threats such as Latios, Mega Metagross, and the odd Gengar. Stealth Rock can be used in place of Diamond Storm or a coverage option if the team lacks another setter, as Mega Diancie is an effective user of the move due to the number of switches it forces. It is especially noteworthy for being able to keep Stealth Rock up versus stall thanks to its strong matchup against Zapdos, the most common form of entry hazard control on the archetype.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Naive nature is preferred over Hasty, letting Mega Diancie better check Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Charizard X while always surviving Gliscor's unboosted Earthquake at full HP and Bisharp's +2 Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock. It is also worth noting that even with a Naive nature, Mega Diancie can survive two uninvested Moonblasts from Clefable as well as take a +1 Giga Drain from Volcarona before Mega Evolving. However, if Stealth Rock is chosen over Diamond Storm, Diancie should instead run a Timid nature to preserve its bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In many matchups, players should lead off with Diancie and Mega Evolve safely with Protect to reap the benefits of Mega Diancie's Speed and Magic Bounce. However, choosing to abstain from leading with and immediately Mega Evolving Diancie can be beneficial depending on the circumstance. For example, it may be wise not to lead with Diancie if your team dislikes switching into Scald and the opponent can anti-lead it with a bulky Water-type or if the opponent has a Mold Breaker Excadrill, which can set Stealth Rock freely on Mega Diancie in spite of Magic Bounce. Also, if Diancie is not immediately Mega Evolved, it can act as a better initial pivot into certain Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Hydreigon due to its regular forme's higher bulk. At later stages in the game, Mega Diancie should be used to soften up defensive cores by firing off powerful attacks. Diancie is best brought in with partners that can pivot into it with U-turn or Volt Switch due to its mediocre bulk, and its health should be preserved if it is needed as a revenge killer or emergency check to a threat such as Bisharp or Dragonite. If this is not the case, Mega Diancie can find additional wallbreaking opportunities by switching directly into Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Talonflame that can do little to threaten it. Do not shy away from utilizing Protect often; aside from scouting the moves of Choice item users, it can be used to learn valuable information about the opponent's moveset. For example, Mega Diancie should use Protect against Mega Medicham to see if it carries Bullet Punch and against Latios to check for Surf.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Diancie finds itself at home on bulky offensive builds that can effectively make use of its Speed, defensive utility, Magic Bounce, and most importantly, its incredible firepower. Fire-types such as Volcarona, Talonflame, and Volcanion can deal with its Steel-type checks and enjoy Mega Diancie warding off Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce. The former two especially appreciate its ability to keep Tyranitar at bay, weaken bulky Water-types, and threaten Heatran with Earth Power. Other Pokemon that are hindered by Stealth Rock and can clean up after Mega Diancie softens up teams, such as Dragonite and Weavile, also appreciate said traits. Magnezone is an excellent teammate if Diancie opts not to use Hidden Power Fire, as it frees up Mega Diancie offensively by trapping and eliminating Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor for it and pivots it in with Volt Switch. It should be noted that Mega Diancie loses to common Stealth Rock setters such as Excadrill, Chansey, and Ferrothorn, making it an unreliable means of entry hazard control. As such, bulky Excadrill is one of Mega Diancie's most common and effective partners, providing vital Rapid Spin support to take the pressure off of Mega Diancie to keep hazards away while preserving the hazards the latter sends back with Magic Bounce. Excadrill also takes care of Magnezone, Clefable, and Jirachi and can cripple bulky Water-types with Toxic while appreciating Mega Diancie's ability to pressure Skarmory and Tornadus-T. Starmie is another good spinner to pair with Diancie, as it can pivot into Scald from bulky Water-types, provide Thunder Wave support, and check Steel- and Ground-types such as Mega Metagross and bulky Excadrill for it. In return, Mega Diancie offensively checks Dark-types such as Bisharp and Tyranitar that give Starmie grief. Both of these spinners are highly fond of Mega Diancie's unparalleled ability to force opponents to switch and pivot around it, giving them more opportunities to come in safely and click Rapid Spin.</p> <p>If Mega Diancie forgoes Stealth Rock, entry hazard setters are important teammates for it to help chip Mega Diancie's answers into range of its powerful attacks and make it near impossible to pivot around. Clefable can use Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave to support Mega Diancie or carry Ice Beam or Flamethrower to deal with Gliscor and Ferrothorn for it. Ferrothorn checks Chansey and bulky Water-types and can set up Spikes as well as Stealth Rock. Lastly, pivots that bring Mega Diancie in and soak up the hits aimed at it are great partners. Tangrowth and Alomomola handle threats such as Mega Metagross and Mega Lopunny for Mega Diancie and give it opportunities to come in safely with Sleep Powder and Wish, respectively. Rotom-W and Tornadus-T can directly pivot Mega Diancie in with Volt Switch and U-turn; the former takes on Mega Scizor and Mega Metagross for Mega Diancie, while the latter checks Serperior and other Grass-types for it.</p>"

  "Volcanion": {
    "overview": "<p>Volcanion is a powerful wallbreaker in the metagame thanks to its rare and potent Fire / Water typing, high-base 130 Special Attack, and access to the potent Steam Eruption. Its typing gives it valuable resistances to Fairy, Fire, Ice, and Bug, while Water Absorb allows it to check threats like Keldeo, Slowbro, and opposing Volcanion. With powerful dual STAB moves in Steam Eruption and Flamethrower, Volcanion is capable of pressuring bulky cores and punishing switch-ins with burns, and its solid natural bulk lets it pivot into weaker attackers. It can also take a more supportive role with moves like Toxic and Roar. Furthermore, coverage options like Earth Power and Sludge Wave let it hit common answers such as opposing Volcanion, Mega Altaria, and Clefable. However, Volcanion's low Speed leaves it vulnerable to faster offensive threats, and its weakness to Stealth Rock severely limits its ability to switch in repeatedly. It also struggles to break past special walls like Chansey and has no reliable recovery outside of Leftovers or Water Absorb, making long-term survivability an issue without strong team support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs is a decent option on Volcanion, although it is a bit slow to take full advantage of it. A Timid nature is preferred with Choice Specs. Fire Blast can be used especially on teams that require more immediate damage than Flamethrower, but Flamethrower is ultimately more consistent. Brick Break is a niche option that can be used if the team is weak to dual screens.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attacking Dragon-types</strong>: Bulky special attacking Dragon-types that resist both Steam Eruption and Flamethrower are the best, especially if they do not mind a burn. Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, and Kyurem are all fantastic Pokemon to check Volcanion, as they can safely switch into Volcanion and also have access to Roost. They also threaten Volcanion out with powerful special attacks. Other more niche options include Hydreigon as well.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Gastrodon are great at absorbing both Steam Eruption and Flamethrower—the two moves that are always present on every Volcanion set. They also have built-in recovery and do not mind being statused too much. However, they do have to watch out for Hidden Power Grass variants.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Alakazam and Mega Lopunny both outspeed Choice Scarf Volcanion and can potentially threaten a KO if Volcanion is weakened. Mega Alakazam in particular can copy Volcanion's Water Absorb with Trace and recover with Steam Eruption. Thundurus is also notable, as it always threatens to OHKO or 2HKO Volcanion while also having the ability to use Prankster Thunder Wave on Choice Scarf sets to cripple it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Chansey and Tornadus-T are good pivots versus Volcanion, but they take a considerable amount of chip damage with Stealth Rock and a potential burn, so they are not the greatest options.</p>",

Common switch-ins such as Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Dragonite do not appreciate a burn and will be reluctant to switch in. Flamethrower is a consistentmove that punishes Steel- and Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Serperior. Earth Power provides good neutral coverage and also hits opposing Volcanion. Sludge Bomb targets Fairy-types like Clefable, Azumarill, and Mega Altaria, giving Volcanion a surprise factor against typical switch-ins, while also providing a possible 30% chance to poison; Hidden Power Grass, Overheat, and Sludge Wave are all good alternatives. Overheat and Sludge Wave over Flamethrower and Sludge Bomb, respectively, provide Volcanion with more immediate damage, while Hidden Power Grass over Sludge Bomb allows Volcanion to nail Water-types such as Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Slowbro with a super effective hit.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf transforms Volcanion from a relatively slow wallbreaker into an unexpected revenge killer, allowing it to outspeed key offensive threats such as Serperior, Mega Metagross, and Thundurus. A Timid nature allows Volcanion to make the most of its role as a fast pivot and cleaner. Full investment in Special Attack maximizes its power to punch through offensive threats. Water Absorb offers utility by letting Volcanion switch into Water-type attacks from Pokemon like Keldeo and Rotom-W, potentially healing off passive damage such as Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Volcanion as a revenge killer and a surprise fast pivot against threats that normally outspeed it, such as Mega Diancie, Thundurus, and Mega Medicham. Take advantage of its bulk and Water Absorb to switch into predicted Scalds or Hydro Pumps, gaining free momentum and healing chip damage. Use Steam Eruption or Sludge Bomb early to fish for status, which can allow Volcanion to break its checks quicker. Be cautious about locking into the wrong move, however, as Volcanion's coverage is strong but not perfect, since aggressive opponents can exploit it being Choice-lock and its predictability. Be mindful of Stealth Rock and look for opportunities to bring it in safely using VoltTurn support or after a KO. Be sure to note that Volcanion is not faster than Mega Lopunny, Mega Manectric, and Mega Alakazam. Be especially careful versus Mega Alakazam, as it can use Trace to gain an immunity to Steam Eruption to safely switch in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Volcanion fits well on offensive or bulky offensive teams that need speed control and a Water-immune Pokemon. Entry hazard removal is crucial, so partners such as Zapdos, Excadrill, and Latios are greatly appreciated to clear Stealth Rock, which otherwise limits Volcanion's switch in opportunities. VoltTurn support from Mega Scizor, Landorus-T, or Rotom-W helps bring Volcanion in safely and keep up offensive pressure. Wallbreakers like Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny take advantage of Volcanion spreading burns and weakening common switch-ins like Slowbro and Clefable.</p>"

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Steam Eruption offers a high Base Power and a 30% burn chance. Flamethrower serves as a reliable Fire-type STAB attack to handle Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Serperior, and Amoonguss. Toxic allows Volcanion to cripple bulky switch-ins such as Rotom-W, Gastrodon, Slowbro, and Latias. Roar prevents setup sweepers like Clefable and Suicune from becoming problematic while phazing threats and racking up passive damage alongside Toxic and Stealth Rock. Protect is a viable alternative to scout Choice-locked attackers, rack up Leftovers recovery, and gain extra Toxic or burn chip damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread allows Volcanion to survive powerful physical hits such as Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick after Spikes, +2 Life Orb Bisharp's Knock Off from full HP, and two hits from Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick. The Speed EVs enable it to outrun uninvested base 70s like Skarmory and Assault Vest Bisharp. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Defense to provide a buffer against special attackers such as Serperior, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard Y. Water Absorb gives Volcanion a valuable immunity and healing option against Water-types like Keldeo and Rotom-W, making it an effective pivot. Leftovers provides essential passive recovery to offset Volcanion's lack of reliable healing and chip damage from entry hazards.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Volcanion into physical attackers such as Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, and Talonflame. Use Toxic early to wear down common switch-ins, particularly bulky Water- and Dragon-types like Gastrodon and Latios. Roar can prevent setup sweepers like Clefable and Suicune from becoming late-game threats. Be conservative when clicking Steam Eruption, as its burn chance can interfere with Toxic's effectiveness. If Volcanion has Protect, use it to scout Choice item attackers like Keldeo and Scarf Landorus-T, but be aware not to overuse it so much that it becomes a liability. Avoid switching into Knock Off users if possible, as Volcanion relies on Leftovers for longevity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Volcanion fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate a Water-immune teammate with status-spreading potential. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon like Excadrill, Hippowdon, and Landorus-T is crucial to maximize Roar's utility and pressure on opposing teams. Defoggers and spinners like Excadrill, Zapdos, and Latios are valuable teammates to remove Stealth Rock, which limits Volcanion's ability to switch in consistently. Pokemon that appreciate Volcanion's ability to cripple bulky Water-types, such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Metagross, make for strong partners. Finally, teammates that can deal with special wallbreakers like Thundurus, Latios, and Mega Diancie such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Cresselia help cover Volcanion's weaker special side and secure its defensive role throughout the match.</p>"

      "Bulky Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Alongside Flamethrower, Steam Eruption provides great coverage, hitting almost everything except Water- and Dragon-type Pokemon. Hidden Power Grass is crucial for letting Volcanion lure and remove bulky Water-types like Gastrodon, Slowbro, and Rotom-W, which would otherwise wall it. Substitute capitalizes on Volcanion's solid bulk and ability to force switches, letting it block status and create free turns for Leftovers recovery or repeated attacks. This is especially useful against the bulky Water-type Pokemon that usually wall Volcanion, such as Slowbro and Alomomola, which struggle to break its Substitute. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb gives Volcanion strong coverage against Fairy-types like Clefable, Mega Altaria, and Azumarill while spreading poison for extra chip damage. Finally, Toxic can be used with Substitute and over Hidden Power Grass, allowing Volcanion to cripple both Water- and Dragon-type Pokemon but at a slower pace.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread maximizes bulk and power, and the Modest nature lets Volcanion hit as hard as possible. 8 Speed EVs allow Volcanion to outpace base 70 Pokemon with no investment, such as Skarmory and Assault Vest Bisharp. Water Absorb grants key utility by punishing Scald and other Water-type moves while recovering health. The item choice is flexible: Leftovers provides steady recovery and is preferred with Substitute. All the other possible items are preferred without Substitute with Sludge Bomb or a different move instead. Custap Berry can enable a surprise revenge kill when Volcanion is weakened and is preferred on high-paced teams. Mystic Water boosts Steam Eruption's damage for a more offensive role and allows damage similar to Timid Choice Specs Volcanion. Shuca Berry can catch Ground-types like Landorus-T or Garchomp off guard, buying an extra turn in key matchups.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Volcanion's strong dual STAB moves and great natural bulk to whittle down bulky cores and force favorable trades. Use Substitute to take advantage of switches and force progress without fearing status from the likes of Chansey, Slowbro, and Clefable. Hidden Power Grass is a great tool for punishing typical Water-type switch-ins like Gastrodon, Keldeo, and Rotom-W. If Volcanion is running Sludge Bomb, use it to wear down Fairy-types that would otherwise be safe. If it's using Custap Berry, preserve Volcanion near 25% HP to potentially trade favorably against faster threats or revenge kill a weakened foe. If it's using Shuca Berry, position Volcanion to lure Ground-types in a way that isn't too obvious.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky offensive Volcanion fits well on balance and bulky offense teams looking for a strong wallbreaker with decent defensive utility. Teammates that appreciate Volcanion removing or weakening bulky Water-types, like Mega Metagross and Weavile, benefit greatly. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Excadrill, Garchomp, or Landorus-T is important for breaking defensive cores. VoltTurn support from Mega Scizor or Rotom-W helps bring Volcanion in safely. Finally, bulky Ground-types that punish Volt Switch users such as Thundurus, Zapdos, and Rotom-W are greatly appreciated, as they can break Volcanion's Substitute and limit its wallbreaking ability.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Steam Eruption can burn physical threats that come in to take advantage of Volcanion's weaker Defense while still providing damage without too much investment in Special Attack. Flamethrower complements it by reliably hitting Steel- and Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Serperior. Earth Power is an essential good neutral coverage move and hits Water-types such as Volcanion and Keldeo. Sludge Bomb gives important coverage against Fairy-types such as Clefable, Mega Altaria, and Azumarill, as well as potentially spreading poison status.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set allows Volcanion to be a strong tank thanks to its naturally high Defense, good typing, and Assault Vest. The given EV spread allows Volcanion to tank two Psychics from Mega Alakazam after Stealth Rock damage, as well as allowing Volcanion to outspeed most defensive Heatran, Mega Scizor, and uninvested base 70s such as Skarmory. 56 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature guarantee decent damage output, including a high chance to 2HKO physically defensive Clefable with Sludge Bomb. Water Absorb grants a valuable immunity to Water-type moves, letting Volcanion freely pivot into Scald and Hydro Pump from Pokemon like Keldeo and Rotom-W.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Volcanion as a sturdy pivot against special attackers and Water-types. Thanks to Assault Vest and Water Absorb, it is an excellent answer to threats like Manaphy, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Alakazam. Predict the switch-ins and use your coverage options accordingly; use Sludge Bomb for Fairy-types and bulky Water-types, Earth Power as a midground, and Flamethrower for Grass- and Steel-types. Even though it lacks recovery without having Leftovers, play conservatively to preserve its bulk for key switches and be mindful of Stealth Rock chip damage over time.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Volcanion fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that need a reliable switch-in to special attackers and Water-types. Entry hazard control is essential; pairing Volcanion with Excadrill, Zapdos, or Latias helps remove Stealth Rock, which otherwise wears it down quickly. Wish, Healing Wish, and Lunar Dance support from Chansey, Clefable, Latias, and Cresselia, respectively, are all fantastic with the bulky Volcanion set. Teammates like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor provide great synergy by handling physical attackers Volcanion may struggle against. Ground-types such as Excadrill and Hippowdon that can cover Volcanion's weakness to Volt Switch are greatly appreciated.</p>"
