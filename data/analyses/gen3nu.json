  "Charmeleon": {
    "overview": "<p>Charmeleon's niche in the NU tier is being the third fastest Fire-type available, sitting just under Ponyta and Magby, while sporting all-around better stats than either of those two. However, it's really one-dimensional, as it really shouldn't be doing anything other than its standard special attacking set. That said, it isn't exactly easy to wall, which makes it a good fit on heavy offense teams that want a hard-hitting Fire-type that's quite a bit faster than Flareon. If you're unconcerned about the Speed and just want some Fire power, Flareon should be your Fire-type of choice.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Charmeleon actually has interesting setup options in its movepool, but it's rather hard to use them properly, and they are all ultimately done better by Pokemon like Vigoroth. However, the one move that really stands out in Charmeleon's movepool is Belly Drum, which can be super dangerous under the right circumstances, as Charmeleon is fast and threatening enough to guarantee itself a Substitute in most situations and begin setting up. With a moveset of Belly Drum / Substitute / Return / Rock Slide while holding a Salac Berry, Charmeleon could prove to be pretty threatening even without any physical STAB attacks. Unfortunately, even at +6, Charmeleon will lose to physical stalwarts like Relicanth, which can still avoid the 2HKO from Rock Slide or Return and can easily OHKO back. For the same reasons, a Swords Dance or SubPunch set can do some damage under the right circumstances but require way too much support to pull off properly and are stopped cold by popular physical walls.</p> <p>Finally, Sunny Day is an option to boost Charmeleon's Fire power and help support Chlorophyll sweepers like Bellossom. Under sun, Charmeleon has a really good chance to OHKO Hitmonchan with Overheat, which is guaranteed with a layer of Spikes, and Charmeleon even has a small chance to 2HKO 252 / 252+ Dewgong with Fire Blast. Unfortunately, Charmeleon lacks Solar Beam or anything else to benefit from the sun, but it also comes with the benefit of weakening Water-type attacks directed its way.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Kecleon is an almost complete stop to any special Charmeleon set and can proceed to either paralyze it with Thunder Wave and make Charmeleon useless or simply 2HKO it with Return. Defensive Flareon and Magcargo are the next best stops to any special Charmeleon set, as they fear nothing it can throw at them apart from Rock Slide or Toxic. They probably can't do much in return, but they will ultimately outlast Charmeleon. Wailord, Pelipper, and other Water-types that can avoid the 4x hit from Hidden Power Grass are other really good switch-ins to Charmeleon and can easily OHKO it with their STAB Water-type moves. Most of the Pokemon that can outspeed Charmeleon can also threaten it, including Pidgeot, Murkrow, Plusle, and Haunter. Finally, Sudowoodo can just barely avoid the 2HKO from Fire Blast + Hidden Power Grass and proceed to OHKO Charmeleon with its STAB move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Fire Blast is going to be the main STAB move Charmeleon will be using, with Overheat available in the second slot as a secondary STAB nuke that can force some targets like Lickitung to immediately heal and give Charmeleon a safe switch out. To demonstrate a situation where Overheat can come in handy: with a Modest nature, Charmeleon will always OHKO max HP Glalie with Fire Blast, but with a Timid nature, that drops to about a 50% chance, while Overheat stays at a 100% chance to OHKO. So, depending on the nature choice and the target, having both Fire Blast and Overheat available is nice to do what Charmeleon wants to—which is blow stuff away.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass shreds apart the Rock- and Water-types that would otherwise be able to switch into Charmeleon's Fire-type attacks, notably easily 2HKOing Whiscash. Dragon Claw fills out the last slot as a great super effective hit on Shelgon, preventing it from using Charmeleon as setup bait, as well as getting a decent neutral hit on Flareon and other Fire-types. Rock Slide is a good alternative that deals significantly more damage to Flareon even with a -Atk nature at the cost of missing out on Shelgon and the rare Dragonair. The power difference between the two moves on other Fire-type targets is pretty negligible.</p> <p>Modest gives Charmeleon the power it needs, such as OHKOing 252 / 252+ Roselia with Fire Blast, whereas Timid can allow Charmeleon to outrun and 2HKO Jolly Hitmonchan and prevent it from switching into Charmeleon, which is highly desirable on the kind of heavy offense team you would typically want to use Charmeleon on. Charcoal boosts the power of Charmeleon's Fire-type moves even more, which works best when using a Timid nature to make up for some of the lost power. Charmeleon's available special movepool is pretty barren apart from the given moves above. Flamethrower is available as a guaranteed safe move and is usable over Overheat, but the drop in power is pretty significant. Hidden Power Water is usable as a super effective hit on Rock- and Fire-types, but Charmeleon then has almost no way of combating Water-types, making it easy setup prey for dangerous threats like Huntail. Finally, Toxic is always available to cripple Flareon and other special walls in the long run.</p> <p>Flareon and Magcargo give this set a hard time even if you choose to run Rock Slide, making your own Water- and Rock-types like Seadra and Relicanth good teammates. Kecleon completely walls this set, meaning Hitmonchan is a great teammate to bust through it as well as Lickitung and Wigglytuff, which can otherwise stomach a couple hits from Charmeleon. Spikes support is amazing with this set, as all of Charmeleon's checks are grounded, making Cacturne and Roselia fantastic teammates as well.</p>"

  "Butterfree": {
    "overview": "<p>Without question, Butterfree is one of the worst Pokemon in the game. It's not good enough for standard, it's not good enough for UU (Scyther outclasses it, among many others), and even amongst the NU Pokemon, there are still plenty of other choices in Ledian, Ariados, and Dustox. Its main use is using Sleep Powder and other status moves to delay opponents from hitting your other Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thanks to Compound Eyes, all of Butterfree's moves are fairly accurate, so you can use Swagger and just hope your opponent hits himself in confusion all the time. Toxic is an alternative to Stun Spore, if you're into that. Thief steals some item--make sure not to attach anything to Butterfree if you're using it. Giga Drain can be used for Whiscash in NU.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>You'll always want to max Speed for Butterfree to get in that Sleep Powder or Choice Banded hit. Stack an attacking stat if you're using one, or pump some HP to live through an Ice Beam.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>With weaknesses to some of the most prominent attacks in the game (Rock Slide, Fire Blast, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Flying-type moves) and the same capability of taking hits as a wet piece of paper, I'm sure you can find some way of beating Butterfree. Sleep Talk also negates Butterfree's main use: putting something to sleep. Generally, switch in something that can afford going to sleep, then send in anything that can hurt it or set up. In the NU environment, good bets are Whiscash (if there's no Giga Drain), Ledian, Dustox (Psychic will do little, especially with Light Screen), Murkrow, Pidgeot (beware of Stun Spore), Mawile, and Lickitung.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Double Powder": {"description": "<p>Using Butterfree in standard play is automatic suicide. The best way to use this set is to come in on a Choice Banded Earthquake, a slower Earthquake, or a predicted switch to a slower Pokemon and then use Sleep Powder. If you're sure you put something to sleep that is not a Sleep Talker, either start attacking or try to inflict more status on the switch with Stun Spore or Toxic. Psychic hits Heracross and Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types. In a pinch, you can always pray for Quick Claw to activate to get that Sleep Powder in. Compound Eyes will make sure it hits.</p> <p>The same goes for switching in when using Butterfree in UU. Sleep Talk is less common in UU, but Pokemon are more offensive in general, so it's still dangerous. Using this set in NU play is not a bad idea at all, though you may want to use other attacking moves.</p>"},
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Choice Band Butterfree is decent for a Butterfree set, but Heracross, Scyther, and even Ledian do it much better in any metagame. Use it in NU play for a surprise. Sleep Powder is the only advantage Butterfree will have over them. You can use an attacking move first to hit the sleep absorber they'll likely bring in, and then save sleep for later when they think you have a pure attacking set. Shadow Ball is another option to hit Banette.</p>"}

  "Beedrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Beedrill has bad stats all around, no real special movepool, and a poor physical one. Its typing does very little to benefit it as well. It is really only usable in NU, where it is still outclassed by other Pokemon. The Endeavor set, for example, is just a worse Raticate.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>EVs</h1> <p>Max Attack and Speed. Most of the time, 252 / 252 / 4 spreads aren't very effective, but no matter how much Defense you put on Beedrill, it won't live through anything. On the Endeavor set, make sure that the 4 leftover EVs do not go into HP, as you want to be able to Substitute down 4 times for it to work optimally. You could also run 8 HP to get down to exactly 1 HP, if you are that meticulous, but it's not necessary, and it forces you to take EVs out of Attack or Speed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>In NU, Beedrill's STAB moves are resisted by other Poison-types like Ariados and enemy Beedrill. Whiscash and Piloswine take it on easily as well thanks to their Sludge Bomb resistance. Pidgeot and Murkrow do the same if they can get in without being hit hard by Sludge Bomb, or in Murkrow's case, Bug moves as well, both threatening to OHKO with Drill Peck. Togetic's Defense isn't the best, so Sludge Bomb might hurt, but a Hustle-boosted Aerial Ace or a Fire Blast still hurts a lot. Magcargo has great Defense and the type advantage over both Beedrill's STAB options and can OHKO with a Fire move. Relicanth and Sudowoodo resist Sludge Bomb and can Rock Slide Beedrill to death. Torkoal easily takes some blows and can counterattack with a Fire move as well. Mawile has Intimidate, resists Bug, and is immune to Poison, so it can set up some boosts to Baton Pass to another Pokemon or just kill Beedrill outright.</p> <p>For the Endeavor set, carefully watch your switches and preferably finish off Beedrill with Quick Attack, Extreme Speed, Fake Out (watch out for Endure), or a similar move. Killing it with a faster Pokemon and not allowing it to get in a Substitute (Rock Blast and other multi-hit moves can help with this) is generally the best way.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Choice Band set, probably the best you will get with Beedrill on most teams. It can't really damage much and cannot switch into anything without prediction, but it is faster than stuff like Breloom... Only use Twineedle if you really want Hidden Power Rock to hit Flying-types and other Bug-types, as Twineedle isn't that powerful.</p>"},
      "Swords Dance": {"description": "<p>A pathetic sweeper, this usually won't even survive one hit to setup. You'll need most of the other team's Pokemon to be paralyzed for this to even START sweeping. Leftovers is not suggested because this set has NO sort of survivability. If you are using Salac Berry, don't use any Speed EVs, but rather, pump one of the defenses or HP to give Beedrill a chance to survive a hit while it Swords Dances.</p>"},
      "Endeavor": {"description": "<p>If you want to use an Endeavor team and don't want to use the slowpokes (Swampert and Aggron), this is always an option. As always, Substitute down to as close to 1 HP as possible and watch Beedrill do the most damage you'll ever see in your life. This is the only way to get an almost guaranteed kill out of Beedrill. Do NOT put the last 4 EVs into HP, or you will not be able to Substitute the fourth time.</p>"}

  "Pidgeot": {
    "overview": "<p>Super high Speed, considerable power, and great dual STABs, what more could you ask for in an offensive Pokemon? Indeed, Pidgeot stands out at the head of the pack in the NU tier. While it faces direct competition from Murkrow as an offensive Flying-type, Pidgeot is far bulkier, has STAB Normal-type moves, and possesses Quick Attack. On the downside, Pidgeot hits slightly weaker than Murkrow with its coverage attacks. However, that's very minor, and in the end there's very little risk to using Pidgeot thanks to its immunity to Spikes, high Speed and power, and ability to check many dangerous attackers in the tier, most prominently Hitmonchan and Bellossom.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Agility is a great move to get the jump on Pidgeot's common revenge killers, namely Plusle and Haunter, and make late-game sweeping much easier considering +2 Pidgeot also outspeeds Bellossom and Tangela in the sun. An Endure + Liechi Berry set is also effective, and a +1 Quick Attack can really sting Raticate, Plusle, and Hitmonchan. A more defensive set can make use of Whirlwind and Toxic; however, Tropius, Togetic, and Noctowl are much more effective defensive Flying-types than Pidgeot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best initial switch-ins to Pidgeot are Steel- and Rock-types, particularly those lacking a 4x weakness to Ground. Namely, Mawile, Metang, Relicanth, and Sudowoodo all very effectively tank anything Pidgeot can throw at them and threaten it out with their STAB moves. Lairon gets a special mention for 4x resisting both Double-Edge and Aerial Ace, but it really needs to be careful of Hidden Power Ground. Physically defensive Sableye easily walls Pidgeot and can stall it out with Toxic and Recover. From there, generally physically bulky Pokemon like Piloswine and Pelipper can tank any attack from Pidgeot and KO it back, particularly if it damages itself with Double-Edge in the process. Finally, Pidgeot is relatively easy to revenge kill with both Plusle and Haunter, as well as Choice Band Raticate.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Band, Pidgeot's STAB Double-Edge hits like a bus, and due to Pidgeot's amazing Speed, it's one of the best revenge killers and late-game sweepers available in the tier. If your style is more conservative, Return is a decent STAB alternative to Double-Edge; however, the power drop is noticeable against defensive threats like physically defensive Lickitung, where Return will fail to 2HKO but Double-Edge has a 30% chance of doing so even without Spikes support (it is guaranteed with one layer of Spikes). Aerial Ace completely wrecks Hitmonchan and works well with Hidden Power Ground, which takes out the Rock- and Steel-types likely to switch into Pidgeot. Please note that Aerial Ace should only be used in situations where the recoil from using Double-Edge would be undesirable, as Aerial Ace hits at about half the strength of Double-Edge on neutral targets.</p> <p>Alternatively, Hidden Power Flying can be used over Aerial Ace, as it hits slightly harder and has a chance to OHKO defensive Bellossom after Spikes. However, if Hidden Power Flying is chosen, Steel Wing must be used in the third slot in order to provide coverage against Rock-types. This combination of moves should only be chosen if switching into Steel- and Rock-types is not an issue for Pidgeot's team. The last moveslot goes to Quick Attack, which is surprisingly strong when backed by STAB and Choice Band. It's useful for picking off weakened Plusle and can be used as a last resort against weather sweepers like Bellossom and Huntail.</p> <p>Jolly is the nature of choice to ensure Pidgeot can Speed tie against other Pidgeot and Murkrow. Dropping the Speed down by going with Adamant gives Pidgeot quite a bit more power, but being slower than other Pidgeot and Murkrow, not to mention getting outsped by base 90 Speed Pokemon, is just terrible.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass can be used on this set to easily eliminate Graveler, Whiscash, and Relicanth; however, Hidden Power Ground is usually better for retaining the super effective hit on Magcargo and Mawile, among other threats. Spikes support is incredible when used with this set, as it pushes a ton of Pokemon into easy 2HKO range, particularly defensive threats like Lickitung and Swalot. What's more, nearly every defensive Pokemon likely to switch into Pidgeot is grounded, with Pelipper being about the only exception. Because of this, Roselia and Glalie are nearly necessary teammates to pair with Pidgeot.</p> <p>Pidgeot is a great check to the Grass-types of the tier, meaning Rock- and Water-types are good teammates to use with it. Loading on the Choice Band users is a good strategy when using Pidgeot, as very few teams can withstand that kind of onslaught, particularly if Pidgeot is used with its partner in crime, Murkrow, as well as other Normal-types like Vigoroth and Raticate. Finally, Plusle and Haunter have an easy time revenge killing Pidgeot, so something that can absorb Electric-type attacks is needed. Here again, Roselia is a good teammate, as are Ground-types like Whiscash, Graveler, and Piloswine.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>Pidgeot's greater bulk over Murkrow is put to work with this set. Even without any HP investment, Pidgeot's Substitute is never broken by defensive Tangela's Hidden Power Grass, which is something Murkrow can't accomplish even with maximum HP investment. Substitute is used to ease prediction, protect Pidgeot from status, and prevent revenge killers like Plusle and Haunter from accomplishing their mission. The ability to switch moves is the major reason why you would choose this set over Choice Band, as there are a number of Pokemon that can switch into any one of Pidgeot's moves, but few that are safe from them all.</p> <p>Return is used over Double-Edge to avoid recoil and make the most of Leftovers, Pidgeot's higher bulk, and its ability to stick around in a battle longer than Murkrow. Hidden Power Ground is a good move to ensure that Steel- and Rock-types can't just switch in and dominate Pidgeot, but Quick Attack is also a great move to ward off Plusle and other faster attackers like Raticate from just switching in willy-nilly. Finally, Aerial Ace is used as a secondary STAB attack, but it's very weak when not super effective. Therefore, Toxic is a good replacement; it's probably Pidgeot's best move for very bulky walls like Relicanth, and it's a good way to stall out dangerous threats like Huntail and Vigoroth.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is needed to Speed tie with other Pidgeot and Murkrow and outrun Venomoth. However, Adamant is an option on this set thanks to Substitute protecting Pidgeot from being revenge killed, and it beefs up the power behind its STAB Return. Spikes support is incredible with this set, as it pushes many Pokemon into easy 2HKO range, particularly less defensive Steel-types like Mawile. Thanks to the lack of Choice Band, Spikes punishes common switch-ins even more, as Pidgeot can use Return as a drawback-free move and then follow up with a more appropriate attack.</p> <p>Pidgeot is a great check to Grass-types, meaning Rock- and Water-types are good teammates to use with it, particularly more immediately offensive Pokemon like Graveler and Seadra. Murkrow is another good offensive teammate to pair with this particular Pidgeot set, as Pidgeot can very effectively lure in targets like Mawile and Plusle and eliminate them with Hidden Power Ground from behind a Substitute, opening up an easy sweep for Murkrow later in the game.</p>"

  "Pikachu": {
    "overview": "<p>Pikachu stands out among the relatively small crowd of Electric-types as a strong, fast wallbreaker and late-game cleaner. This is largely due to Pikachu's exclusive item, Light Ball, which doubles its Special Attack, allowing it to break down defensive staples such as Dewgong and Sableye with ease. Furthermore, Pikachu has near-perfect coverage between STAB Thunderbolt and its variety of Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type coverage moves, essentially allowing it to take on any foe not faster than it, which is hard to come by because only a handful of a Pokemon exceed base 90 Speed. However, the immense amount of offensive pressure Pikachu puts on teams is counteracted by a complete and utter lack of any defensive utility. Pikachu cannot directly switch into anything due to extreme frailty, which makes it feel like playing a game with a Pokemon on your side already down: a huge disadvantage. For comparison, Pikachu's bulk is even less than that of Pokemon such as Zubat and Lotad. Pikachu also necessitates some team support, most notably in the form of Spikes from users such as Glalie and Cacturne, to help assist it in picking up KOs. The looming threat of Diglett also hampers Pikachu's offensive capabilities, as once Diglett is brought in, Pikachu is trapped, outsped, and revenge killed by Earthquake.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Encore can lock foes such as Bulk Up Hitmonchan and Toxic Flareon into their non-attacking moves, which works great in tandem with Substitute, also allowing Pikachu the chance to utilize two attacks instead of just one. However, Encore also relies on prediction, even more so in the case of frail users such as Pikachu. Locking a foe into an actual attacking move will likely spell disaster for Pikachu. Encore is also incompatible with Surf, an extremely important coverage move Pikachu cannot afford to give up. Hidden Power Grass is another option that nails Whiscash, which would otherwise counter Pikachu. Volt Tackle is an immensely strong alternative to Thunderbolt, picking up several different KOs such as the guaranteed 2HKO on specially defensive Flareon after one layer of Spikes. However, Volt Tackle also causes Pikachu to take an enormous amount of recoil damage, meaning it can only get off about one or two Volt Tackles per game. Pikachu can opt to take out 60 Special Attack EVs and move them into Defense to survive Choice Band Hitmonchan's Mach Punch from full health. However, this lowers the damage output for all of Pikachu's attacks and therefore is not recommended. Pikachu's health is also already compromised by the use of Substitute for scouting.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Whiscash beats Pikachu variants not carrying Hidden Power Grass, which are extremely rare due to the sacrifice Pikachu would have to make matchup-wise against Grass-types such as Roselia and Bellossom. Bellossom and Roselia check variants of Pikachu by stomaching a Hidden Power Ice and revenge killing it with either the combination of Sunny Day and Solar Beam or just Hidden Power Grass. Specially defensive walls such as Flareon and Kecleon can easily sponge hits from Pikachu and retaliate with Flamethrower and Body Slam, respectively. However, offensively pressuring Pikachu is considerably easier than defensively switching into and checking it. Diglett is able to trap Pikachu with no Substitute up after it picks something off and can revenge kill it with Earthquake, although it cannot safely switch into Pikachu directly. Faster attackers such as Murkrow, Pidgeot, and Yanma can outspeed and OHKO Pikachu. Furthermore, Pokemon that rely on Chlorophyll and Swift Swim to outspeed foes such as Bellossom and Huntail can outspeed Pikachu under the duration of the required weather. Priority move users such as Mach Punch Hitmonchan and Quick Attack Raticate can severely cripple or outright KO Pikachu due to its paper-thin defenses. Knock Off users such as Sableye can remove Pikachu's Light Ball, turning what was once an overwhelming offensive threat into an extremely passive Pokemon that one of Sableye's teammates can capitalize on.</p>",

Surf is Pikachu's strongest option against Electric-types such as Plusle and the majority of Ground-types such as Piloswine, Graveler, and Pupitar. Substitute shields Pikachu from status and is the only form of protection Pikachu really has due to its paper-thin defenses. Successfully setting up a Substitute allows Pikachu to scout the opponent. Hidden Power Ice covers for Grass-types such as Bellossom and Roselia that resist the combination of Thunderbolt and Surf, rounding out Pikachu's near-perfect neutral coverage.</p> <p>Pikachu has extremely low defenses and therefore should not directly switch into anything. Instead, Pikachu should utilize slow Baton Pass support from Pokemon such as Flareon and Mawile or wait until a teammate faints. If it is predicted for the foe to use a non-attacking move or switch out themselves, Pikachu should use Substitute. Pikachu shouldn't worry about lowering its own HP this way, as it is already going to faint to just about any neutral hit. One of Pikachu's biggest threats is Diglett, which outspeeds Pikachu, traps it with Arena Trap, and KOes it with Earthquake. Use Substitute to scout for Ground-type switch-ins such as Diglett and Whiscash as they potentially come in. Grass-types such as Tangela, Cacturne, and Bellossom can check Whiscash for Pikachu, one of its most reliable switch-ins. Pikachu appreciates Spikes support from users such as Glalie and Cacturne, as the chip damage can assist Pikachu in breaking down walls and cleaning later in the game. Physical wallbreakers such as Hitmonchan and Sudowoodo can help demolish specially defensive walls that give Pikachu trouble such as Kecleon, Lickitung, and Flareon. Pikachu's above average Speed tier is considerably helpful for offensive teams, as it ensures Pikachu outspeeds a plethora of threats to clean late-game without needing much additional team support.</p>"

Its insane movepool does mean it has a couple perks over them, but its subpar stats mean most of the time it won't be worth it. If you do want to use Wigglytuff, you really have to make sure you make use of that sprawling movepool. This does make it a bit unpredictable, meaning it's possible to bluff certain moves and get your opponent to misplay around it, and its stats are just good enough to mean your opponent can't afford to do that. Or you can hope they get lost in those big, baby-doll eyes. Either way.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>As stated before, Wigglytuff's movepool is pretty extensive, opening up various moveset options not listed above. The sets given above are what Wigglytuff has over its competition, namely Lickitung and Kecleon. That said, Wigglytuff is able to run other sets to success, just be sure they're not done better by said competition. The big draw to Wigglytuff's learnset is its access to a plethora of special moves, but its physical movepool is actually pretty decent as well, and its Attack is only marginally lower than its Special Attack. A Choice Band set with Double-Edge / Brick Break / Shadow Ball / Hidden Power Ground can leave a large dent in the specially defensive Pokemon that are most likely to switch into Wigglytuff, particularly OHKOing Hitmonchan and Flareon and doing upwards of 80% to maximum HP Lickitung with Double-Edge. A SubPunch set is doable, as Wigglytuff's Substitutes are massive, meaning it can really take advantage of defensive Pokemon that rely on Seismic Toss for damage, in particular Sableye and Lickitung.</p> <p>Wigglytuff is one of the few Pokemon with access to Perish Song in NU, and it is probably the best user of it after Dewgong, giving it a bit of a niche on teams that need a stallbreaker. Wigglytuff's signature move Sing is somewhat viable, as sleep-inducing moves are pretty uncommon in NU, and can be paired with Nightmare for some shenanigans, but it's pretty unreliable in the long run due to its accuracy. Seismic Toss is perfectly viable on any set for consistent damage; however, it ignores Wigglytuff's usable attacking stats, and if not using them, you're probably better off using Lickitung.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Thanks to Hitmonchan's good special bulk and ability to OHKO even maximum Defense Wigglytuff, it's probably the overall best switch-in to Wigglytuff as long as it avoids Thunder Wave and Body Slam. Apart from that, it's best to avoid aiming physical attacks at Wigglytuff unless you're sure you can OHKO it from whatever health it's at, lest you risk the chance of eating a Counter in return. Strong special attackers like Huntail can cleave right through Wigglytuff's bulk without the risk of Counter, and bulky special attackers like Chimecho can take full advantage of Wigglytuff by using it as setup bait. Apart from that, it's hard to list any true counters to Wigglytuff, as its movepool is pretty dangerous and most of the time Wigglytuff is going to be in a support role. In general, it's best to scout out Wigglytuff's moveset a bit before switching in something too hastily, but Rock- and Steel-types make for decent safe switch-ins, as Wigglytuff will rarely be running anything to hit them for much damage, they resist its STAB attacks, most don't mind being paralyzed, and they have good enough bulk to survive a hit should Wigglytuff be carrying something specifically for them.</p>",

Thanks to that gargantuan HP, nearly every attack Wigglytuff Counters is going to KO the foe right back. Luckily for Wigglytuff, while its horrid defenses mean it's usually 2HKOed by most Choice Band-boosted STAB moves, it usually isn't OHKOed unless it's a Fighting-type move, further increasing the use of Counter considering the large number of non-Fighting-type Choice Band users in the tier, including Graveler, Relicanth, and Pidgeot.</p> <p>Wish and Protect allow Wigglytuff to survive throughout the match, support the team, and possibly even use Counter more than once. Protect also allows it to scout the moves of Choice Band attackers and react accordingly. Return is for a reliable STAB attack; however, Toxic can be used, as Wigglytuff is going to be utterly walled by Haunter and Steel-types anyway, and Wigglytuff can provide a defensive role by using Toxic to stall out certain weak attackers like Sableye and defensive Flareon.</p> <p>An Impish nature ensures Wigglytuff can survive as many physical moves as possible and be able to hit back with Counter. With max HP investment, Wigglytuff's Counter is going to one-shot pretty much anything that doesn't OHKO it. While typically it would be better to invest in both defenses and leave Wigglytuff's HP alone, which will increase Wigglytuff's overall bulk significantly, investing fully in HP actually increases Wigglytuff's physical bulk significantly enough to allow it to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Sudowoodo's Double-Edge where it wouldn't otherwise.</p> <p>If you check Wigglytuff's learnset, you'll notice how you can scroll for quite a while before reaching the bottom. There are a ton of moves that can be used in place of any of Wish, Protect, or the last slot depending on your team and what you want Wigglytuff to accomplish. Some good choices include strong damaging moves like Fire Blast, Blizzard, Focus Punch, Psychic, and Thunder to make use of Wigglytuff's decent attacking stats, a consistent move like Seismic Toss, support options like Safeguard, Reflect, Light Screen, Sunny Day, and Rain Dance, and other niche moves like Perish Song.</p> <p>Having a switch-in to Hitmonchan's Fighting-type attacks is needed for this set to be successful, making Swalot and Pelipper good teammates. Really strong special attackers like Rain Dance Huntail just shred right through Wigglytuff, meaning dedicated special walls like Kecleon and Dewgong should be considered, and both appreciate the healing that Wish can provide. Wigglytuff can usually scare off physical attackers with the threat of Counter, making Spikes paired with it extra effective, and Roselia makes a naturally good partner to it. All that said, Wigglytuff actually fits quite well on heavy offense teams as a lure to blow back certain physical attackers, heal a teammate with Wish, and open the opponent's team a bit to aid in a teammate's sweep.</p>"

      "Screen Support": {
        "description": "<p>Wigglytuff plays a complete support role for offensive teams with this set, setting up a screen, passing a Wish to a teammate, and eventually allowing itself to be KOed to keep momentum going for its team. Safeguard is a neat alternate option to Wish that's uncommon in NU and ensures that Wigglytuff's teammate can't be stricken with status. Although it's kind of hard to set up both a screen (or both screens if you're crazy) and Safeguard all in one go, it can ensure the perfect setup conditions for a frailer sweeper that doesn't want to worry about status ruining its sweep, such as Swords Dance Kingler or Dragon Dance Pupitar. Thunder Wave and Body Slam are used to spread paralysis on the opponent's team to make sweeping easier for a teammate. While Wigglytuff is slightly outclassed by Metang with this set, as Metang has Explosion to get off the field quickly, Wigglytuff's higher special bulk and access to Wish and paralysis-inducing moves make it a decent alternative.</p> <p>The EV spread provided best allows Wigglytuff to set up a screen and use Wish before being KOed. Maximum Speed can be run to allow Wigglytuff to outspeed as many defensive Pokemon as possible to better ensure it can get a screen up before going down. Protect can be used in the last slot with Wish to increase Wigglytuff's longevity and allow it to survive throughout the course of the match, but that creates a situation in which it's totally dead weight outside of providing screen support, which is not at all desirable in most cases.</p> <p>As Wigglytuff is in a complete support role with this set, it shouldn't be the focus of a team. It won't do much in the way of filling team weaknesses and at most will only softly check some weaker attackers. Instead, it should be chosen as a way to try to guarantee a sweep with another Pokemon. Setup sweepers are a must to be paired with this set, meaning Swords Dance Mawile, Dragon Dance Pupitar, Rain Dance Huntail, and Sunny Day Bellossom are all ideal teammates. Wigglytuff tends to lure in Hitmonchan, so Pokemon that can take advantage of its Fighting-type moves, such as Venomoth, Haunter, and Chimecho, are also great teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Wigglytuff has an absolutely massive special movepool, and it has a just high enough Special Attack stat to make a set worth using, particularly since its Special Attack is something that separates it from the other Normal-types in the tier. With this set, Wigglytuff acts as a decent wallbreaker, opening the opponent's team up to a special sweeper like Huntail later in the match. Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Fire Blast get incredible coverage in just three slots, hitting every Pokemon in the tier for neutral damage at worst. Thanks to this coverage, the last slot is open to a lot of moves, with Wish allowing Wigglytuff to provide team support or help itself, though it's hard to use without Protect. Fake Tears makes Wigglytuff's attacks actually pretty terrifyingly strong, usually forcing the opponent to switch and increasing the damage output to the opponent's team. Finally, Psychic can be used to nail Hitmonchan on the switch, and it is a nice way to more easily take out Swalot and Haunter.</p> <p>Wigglytuff needs all the power it can get from a Modest nature, since base 75 Special Attack isn't overly impressive and the goal with this set is to punch holes in the opposing team. Maximum Speed is needed to outspeed as many defensive Pokemon as possible, as this set's main merit comes from surprising opponents who would normally be expecting a more defensive set. Blizzard and Thunder can be used for the sheer damage output they provide, but Wigglytuff gets enough mileage out of Ice Beam and Thunderbolt as it is, making the accuracy of the former two undesirable. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast for more accuracy, but Fire Blast is accurate enough compared to Blizzard and Thunder, and the extra power can come in handy against certain threats like Roselia, as Fire Blast guarantees a 2HKO against it where Flamethrower just misses out.</p> <p>As for other move alternatives, a vast array of Hidden Powers can be used in the last slot to complete coverage on certain targets, such as Hidden Power Dark for Chimecho, Hidden Power Water for Fire-types, and Hidden Power Grass for Whiscash. Focus Punch can be used to get a surprise hit on Kecleon and Lickitung looking to switch in and absorb its special hits, further helping a sweeper like Huntail later in the game. If using Focus Punch, be sure to change the nature to Rash. Toxic is also a decent option to cripple special walls with recovery in extended matches.</p> <p>Wigglytuff is extremely vulnerable to Hitmonchan if not running Psychic, making Chimecho, Haunter, and Pelipper great teammates to take advantage of the Fighting-type moves it'll be firing off. As Wigglytuff is actually rather frail without any defensive investment, most other faster, strong attackers are threats to this set, making sturdy, defensive Pokemon good teammates in general. Relicanth, Kecleon, and Lickitung can all provide a decent defensive backbone to support Wigglytuff. Pokemon that can make use of the surprise holes that Wigglytuff punches are great teammates as well, particularly special sweepers like Huntail and Calm Mind Sableye.</p>"

  "Bayleef": {
    "overview": "<p>Bayleef is the only conceivably viable Grass-type that gets both Light Screen and Reflect. This, along with its status as one of the mere handful of Pokemon that has these moves, much less can afford to run them, grants Bayleef a unique niche in NU. It has quite a bit of natural bulk, and mono-Grass typing is usually useful in a tier full of Water-types. However, Bayleef's niche isn't always that useful in a tier that punishes passive Pokemon like itself with setup and is dominated by Toxic. Bayleef is also almost strictly outclassed by Wigglytuff as a straight dual screens setter, and the only major benefits to running it are it checking Huntail and having a better defensive typing. Furthermore, while Bayleef may be bulky, it has no offensive presence, gets shut down by Taunt, is neutered by Encore, and is easily taken advantage of. Bayleef is best used to set up dual screens quickly and allow a teammate to set up at reduced risk. The only reason you would ever consider running Bayleef is for Light Screen. Otherwise, just use Bellossom or Tangela for a Grass-type.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Protect can be used with Leech Seed or Toxic to help rack up damage versus foes. Counter can make use of Bayleef's natural physical bulk to surprise many heavy hitters that think it cannot do anything in return. Grass Whistle has horrible accuracy issues, but it can be used to attempt to put opposing Pokemon to sleep. Safeguard can be an interesting option to protect Bayleef's teammates from being crippled by Toxic for a few turns, giving them more freedom to set up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt is the most effective counter to Bayleef, as its utility is almost completely dependent on the use of status moves. Taunt users like Vigoroth, Chimecho, and Golbat can all effectively prevent dual screens from going up.</p> <p><strong>Flying-, Ice-, and Fire-types: While Bayleef has excellent defenses, powerful super effective moves from attackers like Murkrow, Golbat, Glalie, and Flareon can put a huge dent into or even OHKO Bayleef, and it cannot do much in return.</p> <p><strong>Substitute: Pokemon such as Haunter and Mawile can effectively set up Substitute versus Bayleef, as it will likely not be able to break it with even Hidden Power Grass if it is running it. Once the opposing Pokemon has set up a Substitute, it is free to start setting up stat boosts or firing off attacks at Bayleef or its teammates.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Light Screen and Reflect reduce damage the team takes for a few turns, and Bayleef can take advantage of its bulk to set them up versus many common Pokemon that don't hit it super effectively. Synthesis gives Bayleef reliable recovery to keep it healthy and set up dual screens multiple times if needed. Hidden Power Grass is a STAB attack that prevents Bayleef from being completely disabled by Taunt and allows it to beat Huntail and Pupitar more easily, but the move is extraordinarily weak in most situations.</p> <p>The EV spread is extremely customizable, so its Special Defense and Defense EVs along with the nature can be altered to augment Bayleef's bulk according to whatever a particular team needs most. Calm is the suggested nature to lessen the damage received from a plethora of special attackers, including Flareon and Huntail. Bayleef should only be used with Pokemon that appreciate the ability to set up more easily, such as Crawdaunt, Lickitung, Hitmonchan, Huntail, Sableye, and Chimecho. Bayleef should not be used as a lead, however, as it loses to many common leads such as Glalie as well as other Taunt users and gets set up on by others. Bayleef is able to set dual screens versus some more passive variants of Pokemon like Wailord and Roselia, so it should try to find opportunities to do so throughout the match. Leech Seed is useful for providing passive recovery to teammates, as well as forcing switches to allow teammates to get in safely or set up freely. Taunt and Toxic can both render Bayleef completely useless, so they should be scouted for adequately.</p>"

  "Bellossom": {
    "overview": "<p>Bellossom is awesome. Despite facing direct competition from Tangela as a Sunny Day sweeper, Bellossom has risen above its competition due to its high special bulk, good speed and power, and access to Sleep Powder. Tangela's perks are that it is faster and a little stronger, but Bellossom's higher bulk allows it to set up on and countersweep one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the tier: Huntail. This trait alone gives Bellossom a major niche in a tier sorely lacking in solid answers to the rain menace. While Bellossom is typically seen as a Sunny Day sweeper, it also has a very effective specially defensive set that can counter some very dangerous Pokemon in the tier, including Chimecho, Plusle, and Haunter. Overall, Bellossom is a solid pick in NU and is worth building a team around.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A SubSeed set can be brutal if used correctly, as there are very few phazers in NU and only a couple of viable Grass-types. Roselia is a huge roadblock that would need to be overcome before attempting to bring this set, but with it gone Bellossom could wreak havoc on slower teams. Hidden Power Psychic is Bellossom's best move for a few of its common switch-ins such as Swalot, Arbok, Golbat, Haunter, Roselia, and Hitmonchan, but this comes at the cost of being completely walled by Steel-types and gives Murkrow a much safer switch in. RestTalk can be used to make Bellossom very durable and more carefree about status, but Bellossom's biggest highlights are access to Sleep Powder and Moonlight, both of which don't work too well on a RestTalk set. Swords Dance can be used, and Bellossom actually has a decent Attack stat to make use of it, but Bellossom has a pretty barren physical movepool that includes only Return, Sludge Bomb, and Hidden Power. Finally, Petal Dance or Magical Leaf can be used anywhere Giga Drain and Hidden Power Grass are mentioned, but the secondary healing and higher power of the latter two are more desirable compared to the locked-in nature of Petal Dance and the lower power of Magical Leaf.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Swalot, particularly RestTalk variants, utterly walls Bellossom to kingdom come. It fears no move that Bellossom can throw at it—even Hidden Power Psychic will fail to 3HKO specially defensive Swalot—and Giga Drain and Leech Seed will backfire on Bellossom because of Liquid Ooze. Flareon and Torkoal only dislike the status that Bellossom can throw their way, and in return they can completely roast Bellossom with their Fire-type STAB moves. Murkrow will take a decent chunk of damage from Bellossom's attacking moves, but it's immune to Sleep Powder and will annihilate Bellossom with Drill Peck. Pidgeot and Golbat have an easier time switching into Bellossom save for not being immune to Sleep Powder and can threaten back with Aerial Ace. Arbok and Seviper can tank anything Bellossom can throw at them (Seviper even has a chance to activate Shed Skin to get rid of Sleep Powder), and in return they'll KO Bellossom with Sludge Bomb. Kecleon can be taken advantage of because of Color Change, but it will be able to easily tank any of Bellossom's moves and retaliate with Return or Thunder Wave. Venomoth, Glalie, and Roselia will take a decent chunk of damage from Hidden Power Fire, especially in the sun, but outside it they can threaten Bellossom back with their STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sunny Day Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>This set is best used as a late-game sweeper, hopefully once the opponent's Fire-, Poison-, and Fire-types have been sufficiently weakened. The idea is simply to get Bellossom in, set up Sunny Day, and pummel the foe with Solar Beam and Hidden Power Fire. Sleep Powder is Bellossom's ace in the hole, allowing it to safely switch out of a dangerous situation or potentially break through a foe that it wouldn't normally have a chance against, such as Golbat or Flareon. With Sunny Day up, Bellossom safely outspeeds the entire tier unless the opponent is packing Tangela, and Hidden Power Fire gains a pseudo-STAB boost to give Bellossom great two-move coverage. The major downside to using Bellossom as a weather sweeper compared to its main competition in Huntail is that Bellossom is fairly vulnerable without Sunny Day up; Solar Beam needs to charge without sun and Hidden Power Fire is pretty weak.</p> <p>With the given EV spread, Bellossom is as strong as possible while outspeeding the entire tier with Sunny Day up. A Timid nature is certainly doable, as it allows Bellossom to at worst Speed tie other Bellossom in the sun and outspeed as much as possible before setting up Sunny Day, giving it the chance to potentially put something like Modest Huntail or maximum Speed Octillery to sleep with Sleep Powder beforehand. A bulkier EV spread of 252 HP / 100 SpA / 52 SpD / 104 Spe with a Modest nature allows Bellossom to completely avoid the 2HKO from Timid Huntail's Ice Beam while still outspeeding the tier in the sun. The only move on this set that's replaceable is Sleep Powder, which should only be done if sleep moves make an appearance elsewhere on your team. If this is the case, Sleep Powder can be replaced with Moonlight to give Bellossom a ton of longevity in and out of the sun. It can also be replaced with a secondary Grass-type STAB move such as Giga Drain so that Bellossom isn't quite so vulnerable out of the sun.</p> <p>Bellossom 2HKOes a decent portion of the tier but OHKOes very little, highlighting the importance of making sure that Bellossom is saved for the late-game once the opponent's team is sufficiently weakened. Flareon and other Fire-types present the largest roadblock to successfully sweeping with Bellossom, as they take a pittance from Bellossom's attacks and gain a super boost to their STAB moves in the sun. Hitmonchan thus makes a good teammate, as it can switch into and weaken or KO the Fire-types in the tier with Earthquake, as well as take on other special walls like Kecleon and Lickitung with its Fighting-type STAB moves. A special mention needs to go to Diglett here, as it can trap and KO the Fire-types in the tier thanks to Arena Trap, as well as take out Swalot and Arbok, guaranteeing they are out of the way for Bellossom later in the match. Flying-types also present a tough obstacle for Bellossom, making a lure like Stun Spore Venomoth a good teammate to cripple them.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>By sheer stats, Bellossom is one of the specially bulkiest Pokemon available in the NU tier, and this set attempts to make the most of that fact. This set should be used on teams that need a solid counter to Huntail, Haunter, and Plusle in one slot, which other similar specially bulky Pokemon like Dewgong and Flareon cannot provide. Otherwise, Roselia will probably fit better on teams in this Bellossom's place due to the Spikes it provides. Sleep Powder is one of the major draws to using Bellossom, and it is almost non-negotiable on this set in order to cripple dangerous offensive Pokemon looking to use Bellossom as setup bait. Giga Drain is recommended as the primary STAB move due to the secondary healing it provides, although Hidden Power Grass is a viable alternative, as it is stronger and has way more PP. Stun Spore pairs very well with Sleep Powder and can cripple common switch-ins to Bellossom like Murkrow to allow for a teammate to sweep later in the match. Toxic is a good alternative in the third slot, as it will allow Bellossom to beat other defensive Pokemon like Sableye and Chimecho one-on-one. The last slot goes to Moonlight to provide Bellossom with a reliable source of healing and allow it to effectively counter Huntail throughout the match.</p> <p>Maximum Special Defense investment is recommended so that Bellossom is bulky enough to take on Huntail and other special attackers throughout the match. Some Defense investment can be run so that Bellossom is better equipped to check the Rock-types in the tier, although Bellossom requires significant investment to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Relicanth and Graveler, and at that point you're probably better off using Tangela. Protect is the most prominent alternative that should be put over Moonlight, as it can help Bellossom stall for Toxic damage and scout Choice Band attackers' moves. Hidden Power Fire is usable in the last moveslot to ward off opposing Grass- and Bug-types that will otherwise have an easy switch into Bellossom, particularly Roselia, since it also doesn't mind status thanks to Natural Cure.</p> <p>Defensive Bellossom fits best on balance teams as part of a defensive backbone to support frailer attackers that need a safety net against a variety of special threats in a single teamslot. With Bellossom covering these, a physically defensive teammate is needed to complete the core. Relicanth is highly recommended for this reason, as they have fantastic synergy together; Sableye and Wailord are also good teammates to consider. Bellossom tends to force a lot of switches because of the status that it throws out, meaning it fits particularly well on Spikes-centered teams. To avoid stacking type weaknesses, Glalie therefore makes the best Spiker to pair with Bellossom. Swalot completely mangles this set thanks to Liquid Ooze and its fantastic special bulk, making a teammate that can eliminate it like Chimecho or Piloswine much appreciated. Chimecho also helps significantly with Roselia, and in return Bellossom covers Huntail and Dark-type attacks aimed Chimecho.</p>"

  "Hitmonchan": {
    "overview": "<p>Say hello to what is possibly the most dangerous Pokemon in NU. This dominance is thanks to a lot of factors: a fantastic offensive and defensive typing, great stats, an almost perfect movepool that includes Mach Punch, which is probably the best priority move in a metagame sorely lacking in them, and a huge amount of viable sets, making Hitmonchan pretty unpredictable. Along with all of its amazing qualities, Hitmonchan is also about the only viable Fighting-type available in NU apart from Machoke, giving it a place on every offensive team to crush the common Normal-, Rock-, and Steel-types of the tier. With practically unique access to Rapid Spin, Hitmonchan is a staple on stall and defensive teams as well. Hitmonchan is the reason Sableye and Chimecho are as important and good as they are in the tier, despite Hitmonchan having ways to bypass them and every other counter to it. Prepare well for Hitmonchan, and consider it on every team you make; your teams will likely be made better with its addition.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While there aren't a lot of other sets that Hitmonchan can viably run outside of the ones listed above, it does have a lot of alternate move options that haven't been mentioned in much detail. In particular, Focus Punch can be run on any of the sets mentioned above in place of Hitmonchan's STAB attacks or other moves. It's just generally not recommended, as Sky Uppercut is sufficiently powerful enough for most sets and Focus Punch requires precision prediction that is tough to accomplish without the help of Substitute. Liechi or Salac Berry can be run on any set mentioned above as well to give Hitmonchan a bit more oomph in the late-game that it otherwise wouldn't have. Counter is an interesting and potentially useful option to run with a bit of defensive investment, as most offensive teams' answer to Hitmonchan is to revenge kill it with something like Pidgeot; with some defensive investment, Hitmonchan can theoretically tank the hit and eliminate Pidgeot from the picture in one move, a feat that it otherwise would not be able to accomplish. Revenge is an alternative STAB option on any set not running maximum Speed, as the doubled power if Hitmonchan moves second can definitely be worth it. Hidden Power Bug is available for Hitmonchan to get a strong hit on Tangela and Chimecho, but its effective coverage ends there. A ChestoRest set is doable, giving Hitmonchan some much-needed longevity on its bulkier sets, but Rest costs a moveslot that Hitmonchan typically needs. Finally, Thief is an option over Toxic wherever it's mentioned above as a way to cripple Sableye and other defensive Pokemon like Wailord.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Thanks to being immune to Hitmonchan's STAB moves and taking neutral damage from the rest of Hitmonchan's coverage options, Sableye is Hitmonchan counter numero uno. With maximum Defense, it avoids a 2HKO from Choice Band-boosted Earthquake and can Recover off any damage Hitmonchan throws at it apart from Toxic. Maximum Defense Chimecho is the next best answer to any Hitmonchan, as it is only just 2HKOed by Choice Band-boosted Hidden Power Ghost, which is relatively easy to pivot out of should Chimecho take the hit, and can set up Reflect on Hitmonchan to soften its other blows. Haunter needs to avoid Hidden Power Ghost at all costs, but it is typically immune to the other three of four moves most Hitmonchan carry, allowing it to easily pick Hitmonchan off with Psychic. Golbat, Pelipper, and Tropius are generally good switch-ins as well, as they only need to fear the uncommon Rock Slide and can eliminate Hitmonchan with Hidden Power Flying. Swalot and Arbok are good initial switch-ins to Hitmonchan but need to be wary of straying into an Earthquake. Venomoth is practically immune to Fighting, only really fears Rock Slide, and can put Hitmonchan to sleep with Sleep Powder. Defensive Tangela takes 40% at most from Choice Band Hitmonchan's Sky Uppercut, allowing it to stall Hitmonchan out with Leech Seed and Morning Sun. Finally, Hitmonchan is rather easy to revenge kill with faster physical attackers, particularly Murkrow, Pidgeot, Vigoroth, and Raticate, as long as they avoid Mach Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>This is Hitmonchan's flagship set and one of the most dangerous sets in the tier, with devastating power, speed, and coverage immediately upon entering the field. STAB Fighting-type attacks destroy a huge portion of the tier, and Sky Uppercut is a powerful and reliable attack to batter opposing Pokemon with, especially when backed by the power boost of a Choice Band. Brick Break is a bit weaker, but is 100% accurate and comes with the added benefit of breaking Reflect, which is an otherwise reliable way to soften Hitmonchan's blows. Hidden Power Ghost and Earthquake give Hitmonchan almost perfect coverage alongside its Fighting-type STAB move, with the former destroying Haunter and Chimecho, otherwise good switch-ins, and the latter taking out Swalot and Arbok as well as being Hitmonchan's strongest option against Sableye. The last moveslot is up to how you want Hitmonchan to operate on your team. Mach Punch makes Hitmonchan a safety net option against dangerous late-game sweepers like SubSalac Flail Kingler, Dragon Dance Pupitar, and Choice Band Raticate. Alternatively, Rock Slide completes Hitmonchan's stellar coverage and makes it extremely difficult to switch into safely for defensive teams, eliminating Flying-types like Golbat, Pelipper, and Tropius and Bug-types like Venomoth as decent switch-ins.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is needed to let Hitmonchan Speed tie with other Hitmonchan and ensure it outspeeds Kingler and maximum Speed base 65s, instead of just tying with them as it would with Adamant. Hidden Power Bug can be used to hit both Chimecho and Tangela in one slot, but Haunter is far more dangerous to teams than Tangela if it gets in for free, making Hidden Power Ghost the overall better option. Focus Punch can be used in the last slot if you think you can predict well; the power of a STAB Choice Band-boosted Focus Punch is almost unreal, blasting through neutral targets like Bellossom and 2HKOing bulky targets that Sky Uppercut only 3HKOes such as Wailord. Focus Punch's power is so great, a super effective Hidden Power Ghost only does about 10% more against targets that resist Focus Punch like Chimecho.</p> <p>There are only a few Pokemon that can take on this set without much trouble. Physically defensive Sableye is the most pressing concern for anybody using this set, as it is only 3HKOed by Earthquake and can heal off the damage with Recover. Pairing Hitmonchan with a strong special attacker that can blow past Sableye like Seadra or using a teammate that can hit it with Toxic will allow Hitmonchan to eventually break through it. Spikes will also go a long way in allowing Hitmonchan to punch through Sableye and other defensive threats like Swalot, meaning Roselia and Glalie are classic teammates. Any Pokemon that resist Fighting are roadblocks to Choice Band Hitmonchan, as they prevent it from using its powerful STAB moves. Dark-types like Cacturne and special walls like Kecleon can eliminate Fighting-resistant threats like Chimecho and Haunter, and Electric-types like Plusle can remove Pelipper and other Flying-types from the picture. Hitmonchan is rather easy to revenge kill with faster offensive Pokemon like Pidgeot and Murkrow, meaning Mawile is a great teammate; Mawile also comes with the benefit of being able to Baton Pass Substitutes and Swords Dance boosts to Hitmonchan. Keep in mind, though, that the goal is not to necessarily sweep with this Hitmonchan set—it works best as a wallbreaker and safety net. This set should be paired with a dedicated late-game sweeper, such as Dragon Dance Pupitar, SubSalac Flail Vigoroth, or Rain Dance Huntail, to clean up the opponent's team.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>With Bulk Up, Hitmonchan turns into more of a tank, letting it blow through the Pokemon it's meant to take out and keep on chugging. Being able to switch moves is a big selling point in running Bulk Up over Choice Band, as is the added recovery from Leftovers to deal with Spikes and the greater number of hits Hitmonchan is able to take. Sky Uppercut and Hidden Power Ghost give Hitmonchan great two-move coverage, hitting everything in the tier for sufficient damage once Hitmonchan has enough boosts under its belt. Earthquake prevents Arbok and Swalot from stopping Hitmonchan's sweep, but Mach Punch can be used to pick off weakened attackers like Raticate, Glalie, and Murkrow. The choice comes down to your team. Earthquake makes Hitmonchan more of a wallbreaker and stallbreaker, while Mach Punch makes Hitmonchan a better cleaner and safety net.</p> <p>A bulkier EV spread like 200 HP / 252 Atk / 56 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used to make better use of the Defense boosts from Bulk Up, while still outspeeding maximum Speed Jolly Pupitar. This spread features more Attack than the listed spread thanks to the Adamant nature beefing up Mach Punch and effectively making up for the Speed lost. Specially defensive spreads, with varying degrees of defensive investment are also usable, but having immediate Speed and power is what generally makes Hitmonchan so dangerous. Rock Slide can be used in the last slot depending on the needs of your team, in particular giving Hitmonchan super effective coverage on Golbat and Pelipper. Substitute is an option that allows Hitmonchan to better sweep the opponent's team end-game by protecting it from revenge kills from the likes of Flying-types and Chimecho as well as status from Sableye.</p> <p>This set fits best on balance teams that need a way to stallbreak, dismantle common defensive cores, and prevent Sableye and Chimecho from being consistent, reliable answers to Hitmonchan. A big perk to using this set over others is that it's harder for physical threats like Pidgeot and Raticate to revenge kill it, although they still pose a threat should Hitmonchan be sufficiently weakened. Haunter in particular is still a major threat to the success of this set, making generally defensive teammates that can keep offensive pressure up ideal to pair with Hitmonchan; options include Kecleon, Relicanth, and Tangela. This set is stopped cold by Swalot if lacking Earthquake or Substitute, making Chimecho a good partner to take it out; Chimecho can also heal status with Heal Bell.</p>"

      "Bulky Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<p>Hitmonchan is one of the few Pokemon with access to Rapid Spin in the tier, and it's far and away the most usable, meaning it has a major niche apart from being a super strong Fighting-type. Hitmonchan also has a pretty easy time spinning when needed, as Haunter, Sableye, and Shedinja are the tier's only spinblockers, and only Sableye can repeatedly switch into Hitmonchan without much worry. Hitmonchan also destroys two of the major Spikers in the tier in Cacturne and Glalie and deals a good number on the third, Roselia. All of this makes Hitmonchan a staple on defensive teams, allowing common grounded stall Pokemon like Roselia, Sableye, Flareon, and Relicanth to thrive.</p> <p>A bulky EV spread allows Hitmonchan to more easily come in throughout the game and spin when needed and retains its strength on the battlefield with maximum Attack investment. The moveset is designed to allow Hitmonchan to spin as reliably as possible, with Toxic making an appearance here in the last slot to cripple Sableye and eventually let Hitmonchan win the spin war against it. If you're not concerned by that, Earthquake gives Hitmonchan as much coverage as possible with its other moves, allowing it to get a spin off by forcing switches, if the opponent lacks Sableye that is.</p> <p>The EV spread has enough Speed to outrun Adamant Pupitar before a Dragon Dance, with the rest of the EVs invested in Attack and HP. Mach Punch can be used in the last slot to make Hitmonchan more of a safety net for the slower, defensive teams it'll likely be featured on, letting it check faster threats that can give defensive teams some trouble like Vigoroth and Raticate.</p> <p>Because this set is slower than other Hitmonchan variants, there are a number of Pokemon that can outspeed it and deal a huge amount of damage. This includes dangerous Choice Band attackers like Flareon and Kingler, which can blow right through Hitmonchan's increased bulk with Double-Edge for a near OHKO. With this in mind, this set requires a sturdy backbone to allow it to switch in and out; thankfully, this set fits best on teams that feature such backbones. Relicanth, Mawile, Metang, and Sudowoodo make great physically defensive Pokemon to pair with Hitmonchan. This set has a tougher time with Chimecho than most of its other sets, even with Hidden Power Ghost to beat it back, making a specially defensive teammate to take it down, like Kecleon, a good partner.</p>"
      },
      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<p>Hitmonchan's Focus Punch is one of the strongest unboosted attacks in the tier and absolutely devastates even those Pokemon that resist it, exposing even the most physically defensive versions of Chimecho to a 2HKO from Focus Punch followed by Hidden Power Ghost. Substitute pairs perfectly with Focus Punch, as it protects Hitmonchan from status and revenge kills and allows Hitmonchan to fire off a Focus Punch guaranteed. The last slot is flexible, with Mach Punch picking off most Pokemon that can break Hitmonchan's Substitute and survive a Focus Punch such as Pidgeot. Earthquake is also usable to muscle through the Poison-types that can comfortably tank Focus Punch and Hidden Power Ghost like Swalot and Arbok and is Hitmonchan's best weapon against Sableye apart from Toxic.</p> <p>The EV spread given makes Hitmonchan as specially bulky as possible while keeping a decent amount of power behind its attacks, in particular allowing its Substitute to survive Giga Drain from 0 SpA Roselia and Surf from 0 SpA Dewgong. If you feel you don't need these benchmarks and want Hitmonchan to hit as hard as possible, a simple 252 Atk / 252 Spe spread is perfectly doable and lets Hitmonchan gain a guaranteed OHKO on 0 HP Pidgeot. This set can be combined with a Liechi or Salac Berry over Leftovers to allow Hitmonchan to sweep in the late-game. If you go this route, it's recommended to place Sky Uppercut in the last slot to give Hitmonchan a STAB move should it be unable to keep its Substitute up. Rock Slide can be used in the last slot, as Hitmonchan tends to lure in Golbat and this set is apt at taking it out along with Pelipper and Venomoth. Finally, Toxic is another option for the last slot as Hitmonchan's best move for Sableye and can allow Hitmonchan to stall for extra chip damage on foes should the need arise.</p> <p>Sableye and physically defensive Chimecho pose a huge barrier to the success of this set, making a very strong special attacker to break through these threats a good teammate. Cacturne in particular can set up Spikes against Sableye to weaken Hitmonchan's other checks and threatens Chimecho out with a STAB Hidden Power Dark. Wish Flareon makes a great partner to this set as well to help recover off the damage Hitmonchan will take from setting up Substitute and to obliterate Sableye with STAB Fire Blast. This set works well as a lure to weaken the opponent's physically defensive Pokemon, opening the door for a late-game sweeper like Kingler or Pupitar to clean up after Hitmonchan throws around a few Focus Punches.</p>"
      },
      "Agility": {
        "description": "<p>This set is pretty unorthodox but can work wonders against frailer, offensive teams should Hitmonchan get a turn to set up. The goal with this set is to set up Agility late-game on a Pokemon Hitmonchan forces out, like Flareon or Kecleon, and proceed to sweep the opponent's team because nothing is able to outspeed it. This set completely turns the tide against otherwise safe checks and revenge killers like Raticate and Haunter, as they are outsped and OHKOed by a boosted Hitmonchan. Sky Uppercut and Hidden Power Ghost give Hitmonchan the coverage it needs to successfully sweep, with the last slot taking out key threats to the success of this set. Rock Slide is recommended here to get as strong a hit on targets like Pidgeot, Golbat, and Venomoth as possible and make use of the possible flinch chance should it come down to it. Earthquake is a strong option as well to make sure Arbok and Swalot cannot stop Hitmonchan's sweep, and it is Hitmonchan's best way to break through Sableye.</p> <p>With the given spread, Hitmonchan is as strong as possible while outspeeding literally everything else in the tier after Agility, even vastly outpacing maximum Speed Tangela in the sun. Due to this, you can drop Hitmonchan's Speed investment down a bit and pump some of those EVs into HP to protect Hitmonchan a bit from foes' priority moves, but outspeeding as much as possible before a boost may be more beneficial to the success of this set.</p> <p>This set should function almost solely as a sweeper, meaning it's going to need teammates to break walls and generally weaken the opponent's team enough to allow it to sweep. In particular, Sableye needs to be removed or weakened sufficiently before Hitmonchan sets up, as it'll otherwise wall Hitmonchan to oblivion. Spikes is the best way to whittle down Sableye down, along with a few of Hitmonchan's other checks, making Glalie and Roselia ideal teammates. Strong special wallbreakers should be next on the list of Hitmonchan's teammates to force the opponent's hand and hopefully get them to sacrifice Sableye or other physically defensive Pokemon. Seadra, Flareon, and Huntail are particularly adept at eliminating Sableye and other Hitmonchan checks from the picture. Alternatively, pairing Hitmonchan with a physically attacking lure to take out Sableye is also doable. Machoke can lure Sableye in and nail it with Toxic, effectively removing its long-term capability to wall both Machoke and Hitmonchan. Other physical attackers like Raticate can punch a hole deep enough into Sableye and Chimecho to allow Hitmonchan to clean up later with Earthquake and Hidden Power Ghost.</p>"

If your opponent switches, Stun Spore the next Pokemon; otherwise, attack. This set dies pretty easily but it's the best thing Beautifly can do.</p>"}}
  },
  "Mawile": {
    "overview": "<p>Mawile is pretty unassuming at first glance, with no stellar stats to speak of; however, as its Pokedex entries state, looks can be deceiving. Mawile is actually one of the best Pokemon in NU with a lot of positive qualities to speak of, which include: a defensively fantastic pure Steel typing, a great ability in Intimidate to bolster its otherwise below-average Defense, and most importantly, access to Baton Pass and a phenomenal movepool. Thanks to these qualities, Mawile can take on several roles for teams and do them all extremely well. Most commonly, Mawile's roles are to check Normal- and Flying-types, help the team through softening physical blows with Intimidate, and support its offensive teammates by passing Swords Dance and/or Substitute to them. Common weaknesses, particularly the ubiquitous Fighting-type weakness that plagues nearly every physically defensive Pokemon in the tier, and low Special Defense and Speed stats are Mawile's downfalls. Despite this, Mawile is a fantastic choice for offensive and defensive teams alike, and most teams are only made better with its addition.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A specially defensive set is doable considering Mawile's plethora of resistances; although, its special bulk is pretty abysmal on the whole, it does at least avoid the 2HKO from Plusle's Thunderbolt at max Special Defense investment, making a RestTalk set a viable option. Speaking of, a physical RestTalk set is more than doable, but one of Mawile's major draws is its flexibility in battle thanks to Baton Pass, and a RestTalk set actively works against that. A special attacking set is a cute gimmick when paired with Fake Tears, and Mawile actually has a decent special movepool that includes Fire Blast, Crunch, Fire Punch, Ice Punch, and Hidden Power Grass. Finally, a Substitute + Torment set could really screw over a lot of Pokemon, as most in the tier will typically only be carrying one move that threatens Mawile; however, Mawile's Speed makes this set somewhat ineffective on the whole.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>RestTalk bulky Water-types are the best immediate answers to Mawile, as they resist Steel, don't care too much about Toxic, and can hit Mawile on its lower Special Defense stat with their STAB moves. Wailord in particular is probably the best overall answer to Mawile, as it can use Roar to disrupt Mawile's Baton Passing shenanigans. Dewgong can also disrupt Baton Pass through Encore and Perish Song. Otherwise, Whiscash and Relicanth can easily 2HKO Mawile with Earthquake and shrug off Mawile's other attacks easily enough. After Water-types, Hitmonchan has a tougher time switching directly into Mawile due to its physical frailty, but once in it'll easily OHKO Mawile. Fire-types like Flareon make great switch-ins to Mawile, as they resist Steel and can easily OHKO Mawile with their Fire STAB moves, with Flareon also being able to carry Roar to disrupt Baton Pass. Tangela is physically bulky enough to not be fazed by anything Mawile can through at it apart from a rare boosted Sludge Bomb, and it can proceed to either put Mawile to sleep or blast it with Hidden Power Fire under the sun.</p> <p>For the most part, fully countering Mawile is difficult due to its affinity to Baton Pass out. Doing things to disrupt the momentum and making smart switches are going to do more to bring Mawile down than trying to counter it directly. Pokemon with phazing moves are the most effective answers to Mawile outside of the ones listed above, Whirlwind Tropius being an excellent answer in particular, but Roar Lairon and Piloswine making decent answers as well. Other disrupting moves like Encore, Perish Song, Leech Seed, and status moves like Thunder Wave will go a long way in taking it and its teammates down.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>One of Mawile's biggest draws is its access to Baton Pass, which lets it both support its team and keep momentum. Substitute is the most flexible move to pair with Baton Pass, as it allows Mawile to protect itself from whatever Pokemon is switching in, giving it a clean exit to Baton Pass out to a teammate and scout your opponent's team and movesets. Mawile makes an exceptional switch-in to Choice-locked Rock-, Normal-, and Flying-type attacks, an invaluable asset for any team, and doing so lets it get a free Substitute up or simply keep momentum by dry passing on the predicted switch.</p> <p>Once freely behind a Substitute, Mawile can do a couple different things apart from simply passing it to a teammate. Mawile is one of the few Pokemon with access to both Swords Dance and Baton Pass in NU, which is an incredible tool for offensive teams. At +2, dangerous physical attackers like Hitmonchan and Pidgeot become absolute wrecking balls with little to stand in their way. If you're able to pass both Substitute and Swords Dance to a teammate, there's little that can stand in the way of a victory. Alternatively, Focus Punch is a fantastic option that pairs perfectly with Substitute, allowing Mawile to dish out decently powerful hits on the Pokemon likely to switch in on it.</p> <p>Hidden Power Steel is a required STAB move to give Mawile a decent hit on a good portion of the metagame and makes sure it isn't a sitting duck should it be unable to get up a Substitute or Baton Pass out to a teammate. With a Swords Dance under its belt, Mawile is actually pretty threateningly strong, allowing it to attempt a sweep itself should the need be there, although this shouldn't be a main end-game goal considering Steel's poor coverage and Mawile's lackluster stats.</p> <p>The EV spread is highly flexible and the one given is a balanced spread to allow Mawile to do a couple different things. With 124 Speed EVs, Mawile is able to outspeed minimum base 60s, particularly Whiscash and Wailord. 132 HP EVs let Mawile set up a Substitute on -1 Choice Band Murkrow's Drill Peck and keep the Substitute intact as it passes to a teammate. This lets Mawile invest the rest of its EVs in Attack to boost the strength of Hidden Power Steel and Focus Punch. If you have no desire to use Mawile for attacking and instead want to focus on its defensive qualities, an Impish nature with max HP and 132 EVs in Defense can be run to allow Mawile to set up on even more attacks, with its Substitute notably surviving even -1 Choice Band Raticate's Double-Edge. No Speed and a Relaxed nature can be run as well to allow Mawile to underspeed as much as possible, forcing it to eat the hit of the opposing Pokemon before passing to a teammate, giving its teammate clear entry onto the battlefield. With max Defense investment, Mawile's Substitute will survive even -1 Choice Band Pidgeot's Double-Edge. Finally, no attacking moves can be run on this set, allowing Mawile to run both Swords Dance and Iron Defense on the same set, which is most commonly seen on Baton Pass chains.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types, particularly Wailord and Whiscash, are the best switch-ins to Mawile, so Pokemon that can take advantage of Substitute and Swords Dance and force them out are the best possible teammates, with examples including Kecleon and Hitmonchan. Ground- and Fighting-types are also common switch-ins to Mawile, making Flying-types like Pidgeot and Poison-types like Swalot good teammates too. Pelipper creates a very good defensive core with Mawile, as it resists Fighting and Fire and is immune to Ground. Kecleon and Lickitung are good specially defensive Pokemon to pair with Mawile as well, since its Special Defense is abysmal and you'll need switch-ins to the special attacks aimed its way.</p> <p>Finally, Mawile is an essential part of Baton Pass chains, and this set is essentially the one you would use should you put it on a chain. If doing so, it's recommended to replace Hidden Power Steel with Iron Defense, as Mawile is one of the few with access to it and Baton Pass. Max HP and max Speed should be used as well.</p>"
      },
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Intimidate and its Steel typing, Mawile is actually a fairly stout physically defensive bulwark against the myriad of Choice Band users and physical attackers in the tier, despite its average stats. This set aims to make the most of this fact, becoming an amazing defensive pivot for defensive and offensive teams alike. Even with no Attack investment, Hidden Power Steel is a good STAB move that makes use of Mawile's decent base 85 Attack and makes sure it isn't a complete sitting duck. That said, Seismic Toss provides much more consistent damage at the cost of being unable to touch Haunter. Toxic is needed as a semi-consistent damage source and heavily cripples the Choice Band attackers that Mawile so effectively checks. Protect helps scout the opponent's attacks and stalls for Leftovers recovery and Toxic damage. Baton Pass should be on the set, regardless if Mawile actually has something to pass or not, as it provides amazing momentum and scouts your opponent's switches.</p> <p>The EVs on this set are flexible, although max defensive investment is recommended to allow Mawile to check and counter as many Pokemon as possible. A bit more Attack can be used to beef up Hidden Power Steel a bit, or a bit more Speed can be run with Substitute over Protect to allow Mawile to, for example, set up a Substitute before getting hit by Sleep Powder or Leech Seed from defensive Bellossom and then Baton Passing to a teammate. Body Slam can be run somewhere to let Mawile spread paralysis a bit on the opponent's team, preferably over Toxic so the two statuses don't clash too much. Taunt is an interesting option to let Mawile outstall certain defensive Pokemon like Kecleon and Relicanth that would normally be able to shrug off Toxic with Rest; however, it's hard to use, as it only lasts two turns and Mawile sports no recovery of its own outside of Leftovers. Counter is a good option as well, since Mawile can tank almost any physical attack thrown its way at full health, even most super effective ones if the foe is at -1 Attack, and take out the opponent in one fell swoop.</p> <p>Spikes paired with this set make it very dangerous, as almost all of Mawile's checks are grounded, which means Glalie and Roselia are good teammates. As this set fits well on defensive and stall teams, dedicated special walls like Lickitung make excellent teammates to cover Mawile's lower Special Defense and forming a solid defensive core. Chimecho and Pelipper in particular pair well with Mawile as they cover its Fighting and Ground weaknesses, with Pelipper also covering the Fire weakness. In return, Mawile checks the Choice Band attackers they cannot handle, like Pidgeot. Mawile also fits well on more offensive teams as a pivot to check dangerous attackers like Raticate and dry passing to teammates to keep momentum.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>This set is a bit unexpected and allows Mawile to hit very hard right off the bat, which can surprise the opponent and force more switches. Hidden Power Steel is a decent STAB move and is a nice safety move to use on this set. Focus Punch hits very hard, in fact—it hits way harder than Hidden Power Steel on almost every target—but is a bit hard to use without Substitute, and Brick Break is an all-around safer and more reliable option to use. That said, Focus Punch can OHKO Dewgong where Brick Break tops out at about 65%, so if you can predict well the power is more than worth it. Rock Slide rounds off coverage nicely and hits the Fire-types likely to switch into Mawile very hard. However, Sludge Bomb is an option as well and hits neutral targets and Tangela far harder than Rock Slide.</p> <p>Baton Pass is what makes this set viable and dangerous. With it, Mawile can retain momentum for its team and feign a defensive or supportive set early in the game while scouting the opponent's team. This gives Mawile a huge leg up when compared to similar Choice Band users like Lairon, and because of Mawile's tendency to switch often, it creates opportunities to surprise your opponent with a powerful Focus Punch.</p> <p>124 Speed EVs are run to let Mawile outspeed minimum base 60s, particularly Wailord, max Attack is run to give it as much power possible, and the rest is pumped into HP to increase its overall bulk. More Speed can easily be run to outrun key threats like Dewgong, but one of Mawile's perks is its decent bulk combined with Intimidate, and having a Choice Band user that isn't threatened by a large majority of physical attackers is one of the major reasons to include it on your team. A move not mentioned above that is perfectly usable is Double-Edge―a powerful safety move that can be included in the third or fourth slot—but it offers no additional super effective coverage and the recoil is undesirable.</p> <p>Mawile tends to lure in defensive Pokemon like Relicanth and Flareon with its other sets, and this set can surprise them and take them out quickly with Focus Punch and Rock Slide, respectively. Lacking Earthquake and a powerful STAB move is ultimately Mawile's downside as a Choice Band user, but when combined with one or two more heavy hitters like Hitmonchan and Murkrow, Mawile can really put the pressure on defensive and offensive teams alike, making it a decent choice for offensive teams. Pelipper creates a very good defensive backup for Mawile, as it resists Fighting and Fire and is immune to Ground. Kecleon and Lickitung are good specially defensive Pokemon to pair with Mawile as well, since its Special Defense is particularly abysmal, with Kecleon being able to pull off a similar Choice Band or physical attacking set itself to continue pressuring the opponent.</p>"

  "Plusle": {
    "overview": "<p>A pretty unassuming specimen at first glance, Plusle is actually one of the most threatening Pokemon in the NU tier, largely due to the fact that it's one of only three usable Electric-types available and the best one of the bunch. Directly outclassing Minun offensively and packing more Speed than Pikachu makes Plusle the dominant Electric-type. While it has little in the way of offensive coverage apart from its STAB moves and Hidden Power Ice and Grass, it doesn't really need the coverage to blast apart the opposition. It sits atop its throne as one of the best revenge killers and late-game sweepers available, a much-needed check to the Flying-types and sweepers like Huntail, and basically the cutest threat there is.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Plusle has a few tricks up its sleeve, but they're all pretty much done better by Minun. That said, Toxic and Thunder Wave are available to cripple common switch-ins, particularly the Grass-types not named Roselia and specially bulky Pokemon like Kecleon. Agility + Baton Pass can make a teammate especially threatening, but Plusle itself doesn't need the extra Speed in most cases, apart from getting to outspeed Raticate as well as Huntail in the rain. Light Screen and Wish are also both options to help out the team, but again, they are better left to Minun.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Kecleon with Rest and Lickitung with Wish are probably the best overall switch-ins to Plusle, as they aren't even 4HKOed by Thunderbolt and only really dislike Encore or Toxic. Grass-types, particularly specially defensive Bellossom and Roselia, don't fear much from Plusle either, as 252 / 252+ Bellossom isn't even 3HKOed by Hidden Power Ice. Specially defensive Flareon isn't even 3HKOed by Thunderbolt either and has Wish to heal itself back up. Other specially defensive options include Swalot and Sableye, although the latter should be wary of switching in despite having Recover, as it is easily 3HKOed.</p> <p>Shelgon can use Plusle as setup bait if Plusle is using Hidden Power Grass over Hidden Power Ice. Other offensive checks to Plusle include Hitmonchan and bulky Ground-types like Piloswine and Whiscash, the latter assuming Plusle lacks Hidden Power Grass. Diglett can trap and KO Plusle if the latter is running anything other than max Speed, but otherwise, it only Speed ties and Plusle can either escape with Baton Pass or go for the KO with Hidden Power. Apart from that, anything with Earthquake that can tank at least one Thunderbolt will easily annihilate Plusle, which includes Pokemon like Arbok, Metang, and Vigoroth.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>The choice between which Hidden Power to pair with Plusle's STAB Thunderbolt is a tough one; Hidden Power Ice gets extremely important coverage against Grass-types, but Hidden Power Grass gets a far stronger hit on many of the dangerous Ground-types of the tier, namely Whiscash, Piloswine, and Graveler. It all comes down to the team Plusle is on and what threats are most dangerous that it needs to cover. In the end, though, the common Grass-types will likely be able to tank Hidden Power Ice, but in end-game scenarios, they should be sufficiently weakened enough to be KOed by it.</p> <p>Substitute takes advantage of the switches Plusle is likely to create, blocks status, and is a good way to Baton Pass into a teammate safely. However, Encore is a fantastic disrupting move if you predict a non-damaging move from the foe that can create opportunities for Plusle's teammates to switch in for free or force the foe to take more damage from Thunderbolt. The last moveslot needs to go to Baton Pass to allow Plusle to scout the opponent's switches and retain momentum in Plusle's favor throughout the match.</p> <p>Max Speed and a Timid nature are absolutely needed in order to Speed tie with other Plusle and Haunter and be able to outspeed Pidgeot and Murkrow. Running anything else is not at all recommended due to the importance of Plusle's Speed tier. Magnet is an option to boost the power of Plusle's STAB move a bit, in particular opening up a 2HKO on physically defensive Chimecho. Petaya Berry is another alternative item option with a boost that can be Baton Passed to a teammate as well. At +1, Plusle can easily 2HKO Roselia with Hidden Power Ice and OHKO even specially defensive Wailord with Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Fake Tears can be used to push a lot of switch-ins into the OHKO or 2HKO range, particularly Lickitung, which is easily 2HKOed by Thunderbolt after a Fake Tears, and Choice Band Hitmonchan, which is OHKOed after Fake Tears and a layer of Spikes. However, using Fake Tears requires a lot of prediction and is generally less safe to use than Substitute or Encore. Rain Dance can be used with Thunder as the STAB move, and this combination is great when used in tandem with Huntail as a sweeping partner. Apart from those two options, most other support moves are done better by Minun, which is slightly bulkier.</p> <p>In general, most specially bulky Pokemon can check Plusle, particularly Grass-types and other Pokemon that aren't weak to Thunderbolt like Swalot and Kecleon. Flying-types like Murkrow and Fire-types like Flareon make good teammates in order to blast through the Grass-types, and Flareon can easily countersweep Sunny Day Bellossom. Hitmonchan makes for a good teammate that can smash apart Kecleon and Lickitung. Piloswine and other Ground-types like Graveler are good teammates to take on the likes of Swalot, and they love Plusle's ability to remove Water- and Flying-types from the picture.</p>"

Offensively, Minun is outclassed by both; however, in a support role, Minun is usually the better choice. Fortunately for Minun, its support movepool is pretty expansive, and while it's outclassed by Plusle offensively, it's still offensively threatening in its own right. The real question to consider is: why choose Minun over other support Pokemon in the tier, particularly much more defensive options like Kecleon and Swalot? The answer should be its incredible base 95 Speed and the fact it has Electric-type STAB moves to revenge kill the likes of very dangerous Pokemon like Pidgeot and Murkrow. Either that or because it's significantly cuter than the other options.</p>",

A Rain Dance + Thunder + Hidden Power Water set is possible, and Minun's higher bulk may allow it to set up Rain Dance where Plusle could not, but that's unlikely and Plusle would just hit harder than Minun. Finally, Endure + Petaya Berry + Baton Pass is another option, but again, because it relies on Endure to work anyway, Plusle would ultimately be a better choice.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Because Minun is primarily a support Pokemon, outright countering it is difficult. However, as an Electric-type, it is still fairly threatening to more offensive teams. Therefore, the best general move when faced with a Minun is to switch in a Ground-type like Graveler. Very rarely Minun will be running Hidden Power Grass, but just play carefully and try to suss out if the opponent might be using Minun as a lure. The next best switch-ins to Minun are Grass-types, which only fear the extremely rare Hidden Power Ice. Roselia in particular is a fantastic switch-in to any Minun. Special walls like Lickitung, Kecleon, and Swalot are also great choices to switch into Minun, but just be wary of getting blocked by Substitute or getting locked into a non-damaging move by Encore. Finally, really anything with Earthquake that can tank a Thunderbolt will ultimately defeat it. The main thing to keep in mind is what Minun is doing for its teammates, which is most likely passing Wishes.</p>",

      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set fully separates Minun from Plusle and Pikachu by accenting its increased bulk and ability to make use of its very large array of support moves. Wish is the most prized move, increasing the team's longevity throughout the match. The next three moveslots can be mixed and matched to your liking, and there's a lot of ways that you can play with Minun depending on your team and playstyle. Encore opens up a lot of setup opportunities, and Minun possesses the fastest Encore in the tier, allowing it to lock fast setup threats like Vigoroth into Bulk Up if Minun switches in as they set up. Substitute is cool when passed with Baton Pass, and it can also be used with both Encore and Baton Pass to ensure the Substitute gets to Minun's teammate. Baton Pass is also a great tool to get Minun out to a teammate it wants to pass Wish to.</p> <p>Light Screen is a neat option, as Minun threatens some of the most threatening special sweepers in the tier, particularly Huntail. Minun also tends to lure in Grass-types like Bellossom and Roselia, and Light Screen allows for an easier switch in for a teammate. Thunderbolt is used for a STAB move, and even without any Special Attack investment, it easily clips the wings of Murkrow and Pidgeot and is just in general a great move in the tier.</p> <p>A more offensive EV spread is usable, but if you want to take that route, you're better off using Plusle instead. Thunderbolt and Wish can also be replaced by any of the moves listed in the set above, depending on how Minun best fits on your team. Another move option is Protect, which allows Minun to easily heal from its own Wish and can build up Toxic damage on the foe. Rain Dance is usable as well to allow for a Huntail teammate sweep, and Encore and Baton Pass create a lot of good setup opportunities. Thunder Wave is an option to spread status, and Minun's Speed allows it to cripple a few threatening sweepers that other slow support Pokemon may fail against, such as Vigoroth, Arbok, and Hitmonchan.</p> <p>Offensively, Hidden Power Grass can be fit on the set, as Minun tends to lure in Ground-types like Whiscash and Graveler. Agility + Baton Pass is another good strategy to consider with this set; Choice Band Relicanth is an example of a great teammate that becomes significantly more threatening with +2 Speed under its belt, and Relicanth is relatively easy to switch into battle thanks to its high bulk.</p> <p>Assuming Minun isn't running Hidden Power Grass, Ground-types fear nothing from this set apart from getting locked into a non-damaging move from Encore. This means a teammate that can tank Earthquake is needed. Chimecho, Flying-types, and Grass-types are all good teammates for this reason, and they all appreciate the Wish support and easier switch in opportunities Minun provides. Lickitung and Kecleon also fear nothing Minun can throw at them apart from the rare Toxic, meaning strong physical sweepers like Hitmonchan and Kingler are needed to break past them.</p>"

  "Kecleon": {
    "overview": "<p>A huge Special Defense stat, decent Attack, and a massive movepool give lots of reason to use Kecleon. With just Protect and Leftovers, Kecleon has a lot of staying power, and on the offensive it can be pretty difficult to switch into. Unfortunately, the chameleon falls pretty short of being an \"NU Snorlax.\" Color Change is a huge mixed bag of an ability, and while it works in Kecleon's favor sometimes, more often than not it gives the opponent a workaround to break it faster. Most of the special attackers in the tier carry moves that are super effective against their STAB move or vice versa, and Kecleon's low Defense means most physical attackers just blow right through it. In the end, Kecleon is great on support and forms one of the most potent defensive cores in the tier with Relicanth and Chimecho, but don't expect it to \"one-man army\" the opponent.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Kecleon is one of the best blanket checks to special attackers in NU, and this set is designed to take advantage of that fact and spread paralysis for the rest of its team. Kecleon fits best on balanced teams as a role compressor, completing a two- or three-Pokemon defensive core. Body Slam makes use of Kecleon's decent Attack stat and hits most of the specially offensive Pokemon in the tier in their weaker Defense stat. Protect allows Kecleon to scout moves, which is particularly helpful in Kecleon's case, as it allows you to more accurately predict how your opponent will play into Color Change. Shadow Ball is recommended to fill out the set, since Kecleon is one of the best answers to Haunter in the tier and it gives Kecleon something to hit Sableye with. Brick Break is a good alternative to prevent Mawile from being able to use Kecleon as complete setup bait, and it gets a decent hit on Glalie and Dewgong.</p> <p>Kecleon's movepool is huge, so there are a lot of different ways you can customize this set to suit your needs and take on the Pokemon you need to more reliably counter. Most prominently is Kecleon's huge array of coverage moves that can fill the last slot to allow it to cover certain weak points in your team structure. Icy Wind is a great option on Kecleon to slow the opposing Pokemon down to potentially stop a sweep and get a decent hit on Pupitar, Tropius, and Tangela. Fire Blast allows Kecleon to counter Bellossom and Tangela even in the sun, as long as it avoids Sleep Powder. Hidden Power Grass can be a nasty surprise for Whiscash and Relicanth thinking they can absorb Body Slam and Thunder Wave safely.</p> <p>Kecleon works best as part of a defensive core, as its lacking Defense stat leaves it very vulnerable to physical attackers like Hitmonchan, Pidgeot, and Raticate. Relicanth and Chimecho pair extremely well with Kecleon, and as a core they cover nearly every major threat in the tier between them. Relicanth in particular appreciates Kecleon's ability to absorb most Grass-type attacks, and Chimecho loves Kecleon's ability to paralyze the opposing team. In return, Relicanth easily stops Normal-types in their tracks, and Chimecho switches into Hitmonchan's Fighting-type attacks. In general, Pokemon that will appreciate Kecleon's paralysis support make the best teammates, in particular slower, bulkier sweepers such as Swords Dance Tropius, Bulk Up Hitmonchan, and Bulk Up Vigoroth.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>This set is better designed for heavy stall teams, making the absolute most of Kecleon's huge Special Defense stat to counter special attacking threats throughout a match, including even Huntail. Seismic Toss and Toxic allow Kecleon to inflict the most damage possible over an extended match, preventing it from being complete setup bait to any Pokemon apart from some Substitute users such as Whiscash. RestTalk gives Kecleon a ton of longevity, making it very hard to break for weather sweepers and opposing stall teams in particular. With a RestTalk set, Kecleon is less susceptible to its Color Change being taken advantage of by the opponent, as the recovery helps cover most mispredictions and surprise coverage moves by special attackers.</p> <p>This set should focus completely on Kecleon's Special Defense in order to best counter the special attackers in the tier throughout a match. As RestTalk Kecleon should only be used on stall teams, it should have teammates to cover its lower Defense stat. While Kecleon has no trouble walling most special attackers like Plusle and Bellossom, it has some major issues with mixed attackers and setup sweepers that can take advantage of its offensive impotence like Substitute Whiscash, Calm Mind Chimecho, and Haunter. Stall staples such as physically defensive Sableye, Roar Wailord, and Chimecho make good partners for Kecleon for this reason. Chimecho stands out for being able to check Hitmonchan, and it can carry Heal Bell to wake Kecleon more easily. As a stall team member, Kecleon appreciates Spikes support from Roselia and Glalie to more quickly wear the opposing team down with Toxic and Seismic Toss. Rapid Spin Hitmonchan also makes a good teammate to clear Spikes from your side of the field and ensure that Kecleon can more reliably check Huntail and other powerful special attackers throughout the match.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Kecleon stands out as a Choice Band user by possessing a ton of natural special bulk, allowing it to simultaneously check special attackers and threaten the opposing team offensively with its strong physical moves. While Kecleon has rock-bottom Speed as a Choice Band user, meaning it likely won't be able to sweep the opponent, it makes up for it by checking many Pokemon other similar Choice Band users, such as Pidgeot and Raticate, cannot. Return is the recommended STAB move, as Kecleon will likely be taking a lot of damage from the opponent due to its low Speed, meaning the recoil from Double-Edge is undesirable. It should be noted here that Kecleon is unlikely to keep Return as its STAB move if it switches into a special attacker's attack, so another move of your choice can easily fit this slot. Shadow Ball and Brick Break pair with Return to give Kecleon perfect neutral coverage and nail the Ghost-, Steel-, and Rock-types that can switch into Return for free. Focus Punch is a decent alternative to Brick Break if you feel you can predict well due to its sheer power, but mispredicting can spell doom for Kecleon or its teammates. The last slot is reserved for Trick, which is nearly unique to Kecleon in NU. With Trick, Kecleon can completely cripple Sableye or another stall staple, such as Wailord, for the rest of the match, giving it a great niche over other similar Choice Band users.</p> <p>Kecleon is so slow that there's not much point in running any Speed; otherwise, you'll end up detracting too much from its bulk or Attack. However, if you really want Kecleon to outspeed minimum base 50s, 84 EVs can be moved from Attack to Speed. Kecleon has a few other physical moves to choose from if you want to target specific threats on the opponent's team. Aerial Ace can make for a very nasty surprise for Hitmonchan and Tangela; Rock Slide will put the hurt on the Fire- and Ice-types that Kecleon can switch into easily; and Iron Tail will hit Rock-types significantly harder than Brick Break. A Lonely nature can be run with Ice Beam or Hidden Power Grass as well to get a very strong hit on Tangela, Graveler, Shelgon, and Relicanth with the appropriate move.</p> <p>Choice Band Kecleon fits best on balance teams that want an offensive switch-in to special attackers in the tier in order to keep up offensive pressure and not give the opponent an opportunity to set up. Good offensive teammates to pair with Kecleon include Relicanth, Murkrow, Tangela, and Pikachu, as they have low Special Defense and lure in the special attackers that Kecleon can use to fire off strong attacks. Raticate in particular can make an effective teammate with Kecleon to clean up once the opponent's Normal-type counters have been revealed and weakened. Kecleon is very easily revenge killed due to its low Defense and Speed, meaning a physically bulky teammate that can pick up its slack is recommended. Offensive Chimecho is a good example that can switch into Hitmonchan easily, and offensive Mawile can keep up momentum with Baton Pass and check the Normal- and Flying-types that will target Kecleon's Defense.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Kecleon's movepool is very large, making many different kinds of sets possible that have not been listed above. A SubPunch set can make use of Kecleon's great bulk and ability to force switches, but Kecleon is too slow to pull this set off effectively against more offensive teams. A straight special attacking set can make use of Kecleon's huge special movepool, although it's a bit outclassed by Wigglytuff due to its higher Special Attack. However, access to Blizzard, Ice Beam, Thunder, Thunderbolt, Fire Blast, Flamethrower, Hidden Power Grass, Feint Attack, Water Pulse, and Psybeam makes Kecleon very unpredictable and tough to switch into. Screech can be used to greatly increase the damage of Kecleon's physical moves, but Kecleon is too slow to really make the most of it.</p> <p>Of particular note is Kecleon's huge array of supportive moves that have not yet been mentioned. Kecleon is probably the best user of Psych Up in the tier, as it can easily switch into a Calm Mind-boosted Sableye or Chimecho and steal the boosts, making it nigh-unbreakable with special attacks. Skill Swap is pretty gimmicky, but it can really screw over something like Flareon that can then become unable to even scratch Kecleon. Magic Coat can prevent Kecleon from being inflicted by status and bounce it back at the opponent, but RestTalk is a better method overall of preventing status from crippling Kecleon. Sunny Day and Rain Dance can be used to support the team; and Kecleon can offensively take advantage of Sunny Day with Fire Blast and Solar Beam, and it can use Thunder and Water Pulse with Rain Dance. Finally, Kecleon can use Trick with an item like Macho Brace to cripple the foe without having to use a Choice Band.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Metang is probably the safest switch-in to Kecleon as it takes little from Kecleon's STAB moves, is immune to Toxic, typically doesn't mind being paralyzed, and can target Kecleon's lower Defense stat with Meteor Mash and Earthquake. Mawile is another great switch-in as it really only fears a Choice Band-boosted Focus Punch or the uncommon Fire Blast and can lower Kecleon's Attack with Intimidate. Rock-types such as Relicanth and Sudowoodo will not appreciate being hit by Toxic, but they can also absorb Kecleon's Normal moves and nail Kecleon with a strong Rock Slide. Hitmonchan has a tougher time switching directly into Kecleon, but it can easily OHKO Kecleon with Sky Uppercut. Most strong physical attackers such as Raticate, Kingler, Piloswine, and Pidgeot can easily O-2HKO Kecleon with the appropriate move. In general, many Pokemon can take advantage of Kecleon's Color Change by changing it into a type that's weak to their coverage moves. For example, Huntail can nail Kecleon with Hydro Pump, follow up with a super effective Hidden Power Grass, and proceed to follow that up with a super effective Ice Beam. Other attackers that typically carry a move super effective to another they carry include Flareon, Bellossom, Pikachu, and Whiscash.</p>"

  "Arbok": {
    "overview": "<p>Arbok differentiates itself from other Poison-type wallbreakers in Haunter and Golbat with its strong coverage options, which let it better pressure checks such as Torkoal, Mawile, and Chimecho. Additionally, its solid coverage and power give it an advantageous matchup against common leads like Metang, Flareon, and Hitmonchan and make it difficult to wall. Arbok's also one of the best offensive checks to Hitmonchan and can check other physical attackers like Raticate and Vigoroth in a pinch thanks to Intimidate. However, Arbok still finds itself mostly outclassed by Golbat, whose better typing lets it check foes like Tropius more effectively. Arbok also suffers from being extremely vulnerable to some of the most common Pokemon in the tier, namely Haunter, Chimecho, and Sableye, which hurts its consistency.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Ghost guarantees an OHKO on Haunter and has a better chance to 2HKO Chimecho than Sludge Bomb does, but it has little application otherwise. Bulkier variants with Glare capitalize on Arbok's utility more effectively but miss out on the wallbreaking power of offensive sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Sableye: Sableye resists Sludge Bomb and isn't 2HKOed by any of Arbok's coverage moves without Spikes support. This lets it recover lost health with Recover or remove Arbok's Choice Band with Knock Off, making it impossible to break past.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Pupitar can easily set up on Arbok when it's Choice locked into Sludge Bomb, while Diglett can trap and remove it. Other Ground-types like Whiscash and Piloswine have the bulk necessary to switch in multiple times and threaten Arbok with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Haunter: Although Haunter is vulnerable to Rock Slide, it easily switches into any of Arbok's other coverage moves and can KO it with Psychic or set up Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Relicanth and Pelipper have the physical bulk to take even Arbok's super effective coverage moves and retaliate with solid damage.</p> <p><strong>Chimecho: Chimecho's bulk lets it switch into Arbok relatively easily, only fearing high-damage roll Sludge Bombs and a potential poison. From there, it can easily deal with Arbok with Psychic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Sludge Bomb has overall good neutral coverage, and its chance to poison lets Arbok punish resistant foes like Sableye, Relicanth, and Whiscash. Earthquake targets Rock- and Steel-types like Relicanth, Metang, and Mawile as well as Torkoal and Sableye, while Rock Slide is Arbok's best way to hit Haunter. Sleep Talk makes Arbok a better soft check to offensive Bellossom and lets it absorb Venomoth's Sleep Powder, although Double-Edge is a good alternative if hitting Whiscash harder is desired, and it has good neutral coverage. Maximum Speed with a Jolly nature lets Arbok outspeed Jolly Hitmonchan and Speed tie with Glalie, and maximum Attack investment alongside a Choice Band helps Arbok pressure its switch-ins as much as possible. Intimidate helps Arbok against other leads such as Hitmonchan, Sudowoodo, and Relicanth.</p> <p>There's very little that goes into successfully using Arbok; for the most part, simply focus on predicting switches correctly and using the appropriate coverage move. Arbok's use outside of counterleading certain foes is mostly limited to using its defensive utility to pivot into non-Earthquake Hitmonchan and Sunny Day + Solar Beam users like Bellossom and Tropius to get more wallbreaking opportunities. Something to keep in mind is how low drawback using Sludge Bomb is; only two relevant Pokemon are immune to it, and those that resist it dislike being poisoned.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Diglett is a fantastic partner because it can trap Steel- and Rock-types, which enables Arbok to spam Sludge Bomb more reliably. Since Arbok does a good job of pressuring physical walls like Torkoal, Mawile, and Relicanth, Pokemon such as Swords Dance Tropius and Endure Raticate fit well alongside it. Arbok can struggle to break through Pokemon such as Whiscash and Sableye that it lacks a super effective coverage move for; therefore, pairing it with a Spiker such as Roselia or Cacturne is ideal, giving it better odds to 2HKO them. Additionally, teammates like Wailord and Bellossom are beneficial to deal with Ground-types; Wailord also deals with Metang and Mawile.</p>"

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Noctowl doesn't have many options outside of the sets listed.

That decent attack power, coupled with two great attacks is sure to screw a few Pokemon over, it can Baton Pass a few nice things to other Pokemon to benefit from, and it completely stops Hypno, Parasect, Jumpluff, and friends from mutilating you with sleep moves (temporarily). Yes, it is a weak Pokemon, but use it right and it can make quite a positive difference to your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute is something else that can be passed (Double Team can also be passed if evasion moves are allowed). Giga Drain can be used for Golem, Sandslash, and the other Pokemon that resist its Sludge Bomb. Ariados can also Toxic and trap the opponent, although it's a strategy that generally doesn't work. Thief and Hyper Beam are your standard suicide moves, really, and both work well enough on this Pokemon.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>Well, if you're going with the physical sweeper set, you will want to boost that Attack a lot. However, put a fair bit into that HP as well, so it can actually Baton Pass something as well. If you are using it primarily to Baton Pass, its defenses should be your area of focus.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Both defenses are horrible, and none of its attacks (even Giga Drain) will do serious damage to Golem, Sandslash, and other hard skinned Pokemon resistant to both STAB attacks (who usually hold Rock Slide anyway.) Also be wary of fast sweepers like Fearow, Mr. Mime, and friends. Whether you have Spider Webbed it or not, you will need to get Ariados out of there.

A 10% chance of confusion is always handy as well.</p> <p>Start off the battle with either Spider Web or Agility (Agility is generally better), and start attacking. When Ariados is close to fainting, you can Baton Pass the Speed or trap onto another Pokemon to benefit from.

  "Magcargo": {
    "overview": "<p>Magcargo really is a mixed bag of pros and cons. It sports a very bad array of weaknesses to Fighting-, Rock-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks, but a Rock weakness is a nice trade for a Grass neutrality overall compared to the other Rock-types in the tier. On top of that, Magcargo also has a resistance to Ice, which, combined with a decent Special Defense stat, really sets it apart from the other Rock-types in the tier. Unfortunately, its Attack stat is abysmal, meaning it can't really make use of its Rock STAB or access to Self-Destruct to the fullest. That said, its Special Attack is above average, and its STAB Fire Blast will hurt a lot of the tier. It's also extremely slow, even being outsped by the other Rock-types in the tier, therefore making it easy to revenge kill. Magcargo shines on teams that can make use of its mixed defenses and ability Flame Body to wall special attackers like Flareon and physical Normal-types like Pidgeot and Raticate; just be mindful of its snail's pace when using it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Focusing on Magcargo's Special Attack and making it into a tank is an option, but Torkoal and Flareon are typically better suited for this role, due to the former's higher overall bulk and the latter's higher Speed. Hidden Power Electric is another move option on the above set, as it keeps the super effective hit on Water-types and trades the ability to thrash Whiscash for the ability to smack around Pelipper. Overheat can be used as a STAB move, as Magcargo will be switching in and out often enough anyway. Magcargo also has access to both Acid Armor and Amnesia, though Reflect and Light Screen will typically be better in the long run. Finally, Magcargo's Rock STAB can be used through Rock Slide or Hidden Power Rock, but without heavy Attack EV investment, it won't be very useful except for a better hit on Kecleon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Water-types, particularly RestTalk users like Relicanth, Whiscash, and Dewgong, are the absolute best switch-ins to Magcargo, as they resist its STAB attacks and can shrug off status easily, and Relicanth even resists Self-Destruct. Offensive Water-types such as Seadra and Huntail will easily outspeed and OHKO Magcargo with Surf, but they need to be mindful of status and Self-Destruct. Other Rock-types, such as Sudowoodo and Graveler, resist Fire Blast and Self-Destruct and will easily OHKO Magcargo with Earthquake, but they will be whittled down by Toxic over time if they're not careful. Piloswine can't switch into Fire Blast or Flamethrower safely, but it will also easily OHKO with Earthquake.</p> <p>Hitmonchan will do a ton of damage with either its STAB moves or Earthquake, but it will not enjoy taking anything Magcargo throws at it in return and definitely will not like being burned by Flame Body. Guts users, namely Machoke and Raticate, will enjoy being hit with status to give a boost to their attacks, but they will take a lot of damage from Fire Blast. Finally, anything else with Earthquake or Hidden Power Ground, such as Vigoroth or Pidgeot, will be able to check Magcargo and threaten an OHKO or near-OHKO.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Even with max Defense EV investment Magcargo still crumbles to any Fighting- and Ground-type attack, and without any Defense investment Magcargo still walls most Normal- and Flying-type attacks, meaning the logical choice is to focus on its average Special Defense to allow it to wall special attackers like Flareon and tank attacks from Chimecho much better. Flamethrower and Fire Blast are both decent STAB moves that separate it from the other Rock-types in the tier, targeting the foes that it normally walls on their generally lower Special Defense. Toxic spreads status and is Magcargo's best way of crippling the bulky Water-types that are sure to switch into it. RestTalk is recommended on this set to give Magcargo as much longevity as possible and allow it to absorb Sleep Powders and other status from the Grass-types it easily walls. When taking this route, pairing Magcargo with a Heal Bell user like Chimecho would be wise to wake it quickly. Toxic can be replaced with Yawn and pairs well with Magcargo's defensive nature by forcing a switch and giving Magcargo's team some momentum.</p> <p>Sassy is the chosen nature to not lower the power of Self-Destruct or Flamethrower, and the slightly lower Speed stat is not an issue due to Magcargo's already snail's pace. A mixed defensive EV spread is doable; a spread of 252 HP / 200 Def / 56 SpD with a Sassy nature can be used, with the Defense investment preventing the 2HKO from a +2 Adamant Mawile's Hidden Power Steel while still allowing Magcargo to avoid the 2HKO from 252 SpA Modest Chimecho's Psychic. Generally, however, the additional Special Defense is preferred to allow Magcargo to beat Plusle one-on-one, and Magcargo OHKOes Mawile with Fire Blast anyway (though not with Flamethrower).</p> <p>Magcargo surprisingly has a number of viable move options not listed above that can be tailored to meet the needs of your team. If running RestTalk doesn't suit your taste, Protect pairs best with Toxic to allow for residual damage buildup and additional Leftovers recovery, as well as allowing Magcargo to scout Choice Band attackers' attacks. That said, Protect's utility can be forgone in favor of additional coverage from Hidden Power Grass, which gives Magcargo some modicum of defense against the other Rock-types in the tier beyond status and will deal a ton of damage to the likes of Whiscash. Self-Destruct is pretty weak compared to the other boom attacks in the tier due to Magcargo's paltry Attack stat, but it's still a good way of crippling opposing Pokemon and allowing Magcargo to keep momentum for its team and prevent Pokemon like Huntail from freely setting up on it; obviously, this should only be run when not using RestTalk. Light Screen and Reflect are both available, with Reflect notably allowing Magcargo to avoid the OHKO from Choice Band Hitmonchan's Earthquake 75% of the time. Light Screen may be more handy overall, though, as with max Special Defense investment and behind a Light Screen, Magcargo is only 3HKOed by defensive Dewgong's Surf. Hidden Power Water can be used over Hidden Power Grass, which trades the ability to batter Whiscash and Relicanth for the ability to threaten other offensive Fire-types like Charmeleon. Both Toxic and Yawn can be used on the set at the same time, allowing Magcargo to literally pick its poison for the enemy between those two moves and its ability, Flame Body; however, doing so can leave Magcargo completely helpless against Substitute users.</p> <p>Spikes support is very effective with this set due to the status and switches it forces, and Roselia has fantastic type synergy with Magcargo, though using both will create a large Ground-type weakness that can be hard to fill. Still, a switch-in to Ground-, Fighting-, and Rock-type attacks is needed when using Magcargo, making physically defensive Swalot, Pelipper, and Whiscash good teammates. Water-types are particularly dangerous to the success of this set, making defensive Bellossom and Kecleon good teammates as well. Finally, offensive Pokemon that appreciate Magcargo's ability to wall both Fire- and Flying-types should be used with it, examples including Tangela, Piloswine, and Venomoth.</p>"

Corsola is really, really bad, has a pretty bad type mix, and has crappy stats in everything but its defenses. It's weak to a lot of stuff, too. Just use it in UU matches and it's an okay utility type of Pokemon and can be an average special sweeper, but it's poor in OU play.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Not much to say here. You could try Ingrain if you are Baton Passing to it, or along with Amnesia, Barrier, and Recover or Refresh as some sort of pseudo-stalling set, but I wouldn't recommend it. Screech might force a switch or two, and Refresh is purely for stalling, as it already has Natural Cure. When the Pokemoning is over, Corsola makes an excellent hockey puck.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>For the standard set, give it max Special Attack unless you are Calm Minding, and even then still give it near max and put the rest in Defenses with a Modest nature. For the Choice Band set, screw Speed, as its slow as hell anyway, and just give it max Attack and a Brave nature with the rest in HP and Special Attack. For the support and Mirror Coating set, give it max Special Defense and split the rest in HP and Defense with a Calm nature. That's it, really, but always try and take advantage of its good defenses no matter which set you are using.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Jolteon, Raikou, Sceptile, Venusaur with a Grass-type move, just about any Grass- or Electric-type Pokemon (except for the Choice Band set, maybe). Suicune will neutralize him, anything that can take a hit and OHKO or 2HKO him works; lots of stuff counters him. Just run when you know you're beat.</p>",

Use Psychic if you want more of a pure sweeping set or Calm Mind if you think you can pull it off. Leftovers because Natural Cure takes care of status recovery. Switch out at the sight of Sceptile and Zapdos etc., but try and hit with an Ice Beam on the switch in.</p>"},

Light Screen or Amnesia on the switch, then Mirror Coat the subsequent attack and get the hell out of there. Focus Band to try and survive a Grass-type attack and Mirror Coat it back. Recover is there to get your HP back when you find a safe time to switch in. Toxic because once they know what you're up to, all this can do is pseudo-pass. Not too bad of a set, and it takes advantage of Corsola's good defenses.</p>"},
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Choose your favorite Rock-type move, but remember that Hustled Rock Blast only has 64% accuracy. Explosion is powerful but extremely risky with Hustle, so you may want to go with Earthquake.

Always use Hustle with this for the extra pop, though I will admit a Natural Curing CBer is interesting. Too bad he doesn't have the Attack to back it up.</p>"},

  "Pelipper": {
    "overview": "<p>Pelipper differentiates itself from the other bulky Water-types in Wailord, Dewgong, and Whiscash by being immune to Spikes and taking neutral damage from Grass-type attacks. These factors increase Pelipper's longevity, since it's not exposed to constant chip damage and is not at risk of being removed by Hidden Power Grass from Flareon or Torkoal as easily as other Water-types are. Additionally, Pelipper is a rather solid Hitmonchan check, only fearing the not-so-common Rock Slide, and handles other threats like Metang rather well. Unfortunately, Pelipper is unable to check Rock- and Water-types like Relicanth, Pupitar, and Wailord as favorably as other bulky Water-types, and it's unable to reliably perform as anything other than a wall due to being outclassed offensively by other Water-types like Huntail, Wailord, and Dewgong.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Protect can be considered over Rest to scout for lure moves as well as rack up poison damage and Leftovers recovery, although Rest is preferred because it significantly increases Pelipper's longevity. Hidden Power Flying lets Pelipper deal with Roselia and Hitmonchan more effectively. Offensive sets with Agility are feasible due to Pelipper's good coverage, but other offensive Water-types provide more utility or power and are thus preferred.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Pikachu, Plusle, and Minun all outspeed Pelipper and OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Furthermore, forcing Pelipper out allows them to set Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Wailord and Dewgong dislike being poisoned by Toxic, although they take little damage from Pelipper's attacks and OHKO it in return with Hidden Power Electric. Octillery can viably use Lum Berry to prevent Pelipper's Toxic from being as annoying and easily OHKOes it with Hidden Power Electric.</p> <p><strong>Roselia: Roselia isn't 2HKOed by Pelipper's Ice Beam and can set Spikes fairly safely against it.</p>",

Toxic is an alternative to Ice Beam that allows Pelipper to cripple opposing Water-types in Wailord and Dewgong. Rest increases Pelipper's longevity and cleanses it of poison from Pokemon like Hitmonchan and Metang. Sleep Talk makes it harder for foes to take advantage of Pelipper while it's asleep. Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature helps Pelipper switch into Pokemon like Hitmonchan, Metang, and Murkrow more reliably, while the remaining 4 EVs are thrown into Speed so Pelipper outspeeds uninvested Roselia.</p> <p>It's very important to be cautious when switching into certain Pokemon; offensive Hitmonchan variants sometimes carry Rock Slide for Flying-types like Pelipper, and Metang almost always has Explosion, which can heavily dent Pelipper. Although Surf is a relatively low-drawback move to use, it's helpful to predict switches to Roselia and Cacturne by using Ice Beam, which helps dissuade them from setting Spikes. Similarly, using Toxic is a good way to punish Water-type wallbreakers in Wailord and Dewgong that may switch into Pelipper. Thanks to Pelipper's Spikes immunity, it doesn't have to worry as much about switching out after using Rest, so don't feel obligated to keep Pelipper in to brute force through sleep turns.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since Pelipper is incredibly vulnerable to Electric-type attacks, it appreciates Pokemon like Roselia and Lickitung that can switch into such attacks; additionally, both provide cleric support and check offensive Water-types well. Pelipper also benefits from Rock-type checks like Hitmonchan and Chimecho. Pokemon like Pikachu, Lickitung, and Chimecho appreciate Pelipper's handling of Hitmonchan as well as Metang, which threatens to power through the latter two with its strong Meteor Mash.</p>"

Delcatty is otherwise completely outclassed by the other Normal-types in the tier due to its lacking stats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunderbolt can be used over Wish to prevent Delcatty from being neutralized by Taunt and let it make use of its boosts; it can also be clutch in preventing Roar Wailord and Perish Song Dewgong from breaking the Baton Pass chain. If you're aiming to Baton Pass Speed boosts to Delcatty early, an EV spread with maximum Defense as opposed to maximum Speed is more plausible, making Delcatty more difficult to take down overall. Spinda is an alternative to Delcatty as a Calm Mind passer due to its access to Hypnosis, which can let the Baton Pass chain accrue boosts more reliably.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Anti-Baton Pass Moves: Moves like Roar, Perish Song, and Taunt all disrupt Baton Pass chains; while Taunt forces Delcatty to use Struggle repeatedly and can leave it vulnerable to the foe's attacks, Roar and Perish Song reset the chain entirely.

Ariados is unique in that it can trap a passive foe with Spider Web, essentially making it impossible for the opponent to break the chain. Octillery is the best option as a stat recipient due to its broad coverage and ability Suction Cups, which prevents Roar users from phazing it; however, Clamperl is an alternative recipient that trades reliability for greater damage output.</p>"

Notable resistances to Fighting and Ground further let it reliably take on Pokemon such as Hitmonchan locked into Sky Uppercut and Piloswine locked into Earthquake. However, Volbeat has such an incredibly low Special Attack stat that even after one Tail Glow boost it still fails to 2HKO a majority of Pokemon. Volbeat's STAB Bug Attacks are also physical, meaning it must forgo STAB if it wants to make use of its Tail Glow boosts. Volbeat is an enigma of being really awful in nearly every aspect but having the rather stellar ability to pass Special Attack boosts to teammates such as Haunter and Huntail.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Volbeat can utilize a Choice Band set consisting of Hidden Power Bug, Shadow Ball, Brick Break, and Trick alongside maximum Attack EVs and a Jolly nature; however, Volbeat doesn't have a secondary type or STAB option and is ultimately outclassed by other physical Bug-types such as Yanma and Venomoth. Tail Glow sets utilizing Hidden Power Grass over Baton Pass should run maximum Special Attack EVs over HP EVs. Such a set can lure and beat Pokemon such as Relicanth and Whiscash.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Fire-types such as Flareon and Torkoal threaten to KO Volbeat with their super effective STAB attacks. Flareon is particularly noteworthy, as its high Special Defense stat allows it to take multiple boosted Thunderbolts and restore its health with Wish and Leftovers and it can break Volbeat's chain with Roar. Flying-types such as Pidgeot and Murkrow are troublesome as they can OHKO Volbeat with their STAB moves. However, if Volbeat is behind a Substitute, they are threatened by a super effective Thunderbolt or Ice Punch. Phazers such as Roar Wailord and Whirlwind Golbat can force Volbeat or the Baton Pass recipient out, although they fear a boosted Thunderbolt. Generally, Rock-types can take on an unboosted Volbeat with relative ease. However, Relicanth is wary of Thunderbolt, while Pupitar and Graveler are scared of Ice Punch. Despite what their typing suggests, certain Grass-types such as Bellossom commonly run Hidden Power Fire and have enough special bulk to take at least one boosted Ice Punch.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Substitute shields Volbeat from status conditions and allows it to set up with Tail Glow more safely. Passing a Substitute with Baton Pass also allows the recipient to come in freely without worry of taking an attack head-on. Thunderbolt is Volbeat's strongest special attacking option, nailing Flying-types such as Pidgeot and Murkrow, while also hitting scary Water-types such as Huntail, Relicanth, and Wailord super effectively (the latter of which will usually try to phaze Volbeat with Roar). However, Thunderbolt leaves Volbeat vulnerable to common Grass-types such as Bellossom and Roselia that can set up with Sunny Day and Spikes quite easily, and it does nothing to the elusive Dragonair and Shelgon. Thus, Ice Punch, albeit not nearly as strong as Thunderbolt, is an option to still hit Flying-types super effectively while also dealing with said Grass-types, all of which commonly carry Hidden Power Fire. However, running Ice Punch comes at the cost of not being able to deal with Fire-types, such as Magcargo and Torkoal, should the need arise.</p> <p>Leftovers gradually restores Volbeat’s health, allowing it to set up multiple Substitutes through the course of the match and further ensure that the eventual Baton Pass recipient comes in safely. Maximum HP EVs make the strongest Substitutes for the foe to break, while maximum Speed EVs alongside a Timid nature allow Volbeat to outpace a large portion of the metagame and pass Special Attack boosts and Substitutes to a teammate safely. On non-Baton Pass chain teams, Volbeat should attempt to switch into a Pokemon locked into a resisted attack, such as Choice Band Hitmonchan locked into Earthquake or Sky Uppercut. When talking about Baton Pass chain teams, Volbeat is typically not the lead, so expect it to be Baton Passed into with a few Defense or Special Defense boosts before attempting to boost with Tail Glow. In either situation, Volbeat should try to set up a few Tail Glow boosts and have a Substitute up before Baton Passing to another Baton Pass user or the recipient. The best teammates for Volbeat fall under two categories: Pokemon that can continue the Baton Pass chain and Baton Pass recipients. Other Pokemon that can continue the Baton Pass chain include Mawile with Swords Dance and Iron Defense, Plusle with Agility, Delcatty with Calm Mind, and Ariados with Spider Web. Since Volbeat will be passing Special Attack boosts, special attackers with great type coverage options such as Huntail make for the best recipients.</p>"

It is already so delicate that I felt it was much more important to make sure it could both withstand and dish out attacks. My EVs were pretty much 252 Attacking Stat/252 Defensive Stat/4 Speed. Nature could be either +Attack or +Defense. I tried to compensate for its lack of defenses by concentrating on only one defensive stat and using it only against Pokemon primarily of that alignment. Although it melts against attacks it isn't designed to take, this setup actually gives it decent durability. It is more vulnerable, but it is probably more effective overall. Castform really is not designed to be easy to play. If you really wanted to use mixed defenses go ahead, but I don't think it would be effective at all.

I don't think most people are aware of the attack options available to Castform (as far as types go).

    "overview": "<p>Chimecho has a very distinct niche in NU as being one of the very few Psychic-types in the tier and the most splashable one by far. This is because, unlike Metang, Chimecho resists Fighting, making it a better answer to Hitmonchan, and Chimecho is way, way bulkier than Abra, giving it far more utility. With access to a wide movepool and a decent stat spread, Chimecho is super versatile in what it can do for its team, being able to go offensive or defensive with ease. Its deep movepool and pure Psychic typing also lets Chimecho blanket check a ton of threats in the tier, from dangerous sweepers like Huntail and Haunter to defensive stalwarts like Swalot and Relicanth. All things considered, there's very little downside to using Chimecho, and it's a Pokemon to consider on every team you make.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Chimecho's movepool is pretty expansive, but most of the notable examples have been mentioned already. Chimecho can fit Rain Dance and Sunny Day on any set pretty easily to support a weather-sweeping teammate. Skill Swap can be used to really mess with certain threats like Flareon and Huntail, allowing offensive Chimecho to even countersweep Huntail's team if done correctly. Psych Up can prevent Calm Mind Sableye from using Chimecho as complete setup bait. Curse can be used on Chimecho's Calm Mind sets to make it super hard to break both physically and specially--it just can't make use of the Attack boosts that come with it. Icy Wind is an interesting option to slow down certain threats like Vigoroth before Chimecho is KOed, allowing a teammate to more easily revenge kill it. Nightmare can be paired with Hypnosis, and in general is a fun move to mess with the large amount of RestTalk users in the metagame.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Metang is probably the best all-around answer to Chimecho thanks to its 4x resistance to Psychic, neutrality to Hidden Power Electric, and immunity to Toxic. It can easily remove Chimecho with Explosion or whittle it down with Meteor Mash faster than Chimecho can wear it down; however, it needs to be wary of Hidden Power Fire. Dark-types are also very good switch-ins to Chimecho as they are immune to Psychic. Cacturne is probably the best example, as it also resists Hidden Power Electric and Hidden Power Dark and easily 2HKOes Chimecho with Hidden Power Ghost. Murkrow and Crawdaunt also easily 2HKO Chimecho with Shadow Ball and Crunch respectively, although they need to be very wary of Hidden Power Electric. Calm Mind Sableye can use most of Chimecho's sets as setup bait and eliminate it with Hidden Power Dark, though it really doesn't like Toxic unless it's running RestTalk. Mawile and Lairon can switch into Chimecho if needed and blast it with their STAB moves. While Chimecho is decently bulky, it falls short of avoiding 2HKOes from the hardest hitters in the tier, with strong Choice Band attackers like Raticate, Pidgeot, Vigoroth, Piloswine, and Flareon all being able to easily 2HKO even the most physically defensive Chimecho if it isn't behind a Reflect.</p>",

      "Defensive Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set is one of the best blanket checks in the NU metagame, in particular being a fantastic answer to the omnipresent Hitmonchan. With the given EV spread, Chimecho avoids a 2HKO from non-Choice Band Hitmonchan's Hidden Power Ghost and Choice Band Murkrow's Drill Peck, and it survives even Huntail's Modest rain-boosted Hydro Pump at full health. Besides being a great check to a multitude of threats in the tier, this set also supports the team in multiple ways, including crippling troubling defensive threats like Sableye with Toxic, healing status on your own Pokemon with Heal Bell, and buffering attacks with a screen of choice to make setup easier for a teammate. Yawn is a good choice to force switches or put a foe to sleep, which when combined with screen support can create a very good setup opportunity for a teammate. As a support Pokemon, this Chimecho set fits on a wide range of teams, with stall teams finding its access to Heal Bell almost invaluable and offensive teams appreciating its ability to pivot around Hitmonchan and other threats.</p> <p>Chimecho is highly flexible in its EV spread and move choices; it all comes down to what gaps you want Chimecho to fill on your team. More Defense EVs can be added to let Chimecho more reliably answer Hitmonchan and other offensive monsters like Pupitar. Alternatively, Chimecho can add more Special Defense investment to let it take on special attackers like Haunter, as Chimecho's resistance to Fighting allows it to check Hitmonchan reliably enough with just maximum HP investment.</p> <p>There's a ton of move choices that can be added and swapped around, all with their own perks and downsides over the moves listed. Icy Wind can allow Chimecho to lessen the threat of a Pokemon like Raticate that it wouldn't be able to KO with Psychic before being KOed itself. Chimecho can set up Rain Dance or Sunny Day to allow a weather sweeper like Huntail or Bellossom come in and start wreaking havoc. Finally, Taunt or Torment can allow Chimecho to effectively stallbreak when combined with Toxic and Heal Bell.</p> <p>Being able to check Hitmonchan is one of the biggest draws to using Chimecho, and using it to fill a Hitmonchan weakness is one of the easiest ways to fit it onto teams. There are some great defensive cores that Chimecho fits on to fulfill this purpose, such as with Kecleon and Relicanth or Mawile and Flareon. As a support Pokemon, Chimecho should be used to patch weaknesses in your team and its goal is not to sweep itself, but there are a few Pokemon to keep in mind that Chimecho simply can't touch with this set, most notably Steel-types like Metang and Dark-types like RestTalk Sableye. Flareon is a particularly useful partner to ensure these Pokemon don't become too problematic, and on stall teams, Wish Flareon + Sableye + Heal Bell Chimecho is one of the sturdiest defensive cores in the metagame. Finally, a dedicated sweeper like Huntail, Tangela, or Dragon Dance Pupitar should be paired with Chimecho in some manner, as it can protect their vulnerable defenses with a screen of choice and heal any status they may accrue with Heal Bell.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Chimecho has many fantastic qualities of a late-game sweeper with great bulk, few weaknesses, good resistances, access to a great boosting move, and a reliable enough mono-STAB attack. Relying on just Psychic to sweep is doable in NU thanks to the general lack of Dark-types aside from Sableye, and only one of the three common Steel-types (Metang) can take repeated blows from this set. Thanks to RestTalk, Chimecho also doesn't care too much about status, allowing it to steamroll stall teams as a last Pokemon if they lack Perish Song. In the mid-game, Chimecho also has utility as being one of the best Hitmonchan checks in the tier, and thanks to Calm Mind, Chimecho can throw out some decent hits with a boosted Psychic to help secure a sweep.</p> <p>44 Speed EVs are run to outspeed minimum Speed Dewgong, with the rest of the EVs invested in making Chimecho as physically defensive as possible, as it will be boosting its Special Defense through Calm Mind to make up for the lack of investment. With the given defensive investment, Chimecho just barely avoids the 2HKO from Choice Band Relicanth's Rock Slide and at +1 avoids the 2HKO from Huntail's Hydro Pump out of rain. While focusing on Defense investment is probably the better route to take, focusing on Special Defense is an option and can make Chimecho nearly impregnable from the special side. With full Special Defense investment and at +1, Chimecho avoids the 2HKO from Huntail's Hydro Pump in the rain, quite the major feat for a Pokemon that doesn't resist Water.</p> <p>This set requires some team support to work, as there are a few key threats that need to be removed before trying to sweep. This set works best against slower stall teams that lack a way to break through it outside of status, with the only major roadblock on these teams being Sableye. Pokemon that can lure in Sableye and remove it are the best partners to this set, and this includes Hitmonchan with Toxic, mixed attackers like Crawdaunt and Seviper, and super strong physical attackers like Choice Band Graveler and Piloswine. The other common Dark-type to be wary of is Murkrow, which is significantly easier to lure in and remove than Sableye due to its frailty. Other major threats that need to be removed are strong physical attackers that can 2HKO Chimecho, which includes Choice Band users, such as Raticate, Pidgeot, and Flareon. Having a super defensive teammate like Relicanth that can tank attacks from these threats and remove them is necessary.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>This set makes Chimecho as dangerous as possible as quickly as possible, pressuring the opponent and making it hard to switch into thanks to a good amount of power and awesome coverage. Psychic + Hidden Power Fire gets incredibly good neutral coverage in NU, with Hidden Power Fire getting a much needed super effective hit on two of the three Steel-types in Metang and Mawile, as well as a decent hit on most the dangerous Dark-types in the tier, particularly Sableye, Murkrow, and Cacturne. While Hidden Power Fire is preferred for its greater super effective coverage, Hidden Power Electric gets better neutral coverage with Psychic and is Chimecho's best weapon against the Dark-types, in particular gaining super effective hits on Murkrow and Crawdaunt. The last slot goes to the move that best supports Chimecho's team, and there's a few different choices for the last slot that each have a lot of merit. Reflect protects Chimecho from Hidden Power Ghost from Hitmonchan and Shadow Ball from other physical attackers like Raticate and Vigoroth, allowing it to beat them one-on-one. Heal Bell allows Chimecho to steamroll through defensive teams that rely on Toxic to beat it, as well as supporting the team and helping RestTalk users. Finally, Yawn can completely cripple a Pokemon on the opponent's team or force switches, allowing Chimecho more time to gain boosts with Calm Mind.</p> <p>There's quite a few directions you can take Chimecho's EV spread in, with the given one making Chimecho as powerful and bulky as possible while outspeeding minimum Speed Dewgong. Running max Speed investment with a Timid nature is an option that allows Chimecho to Speed tie with Adamant Hitmonchan and outrun Timid Tangela before it can hit Chimecho with Sleep Powder. Another option is running more defensive investment to make Chimecho more of a tank, but that's generally done better when using a RestTalk set. If you need Chimecho to check Huntail, 252 HP and 80 SpD EVs need to be run to avoid the OHKO from Hydro Pump in the rain. For alternate move choices, Hidden Power Ice is an option in the second moveslot to gain a super effective hit on Ground-types, but it comes at the cost of losing the super effective hit on Steel-types. Hidden Power Dark actually provides the best neutral coverage for Chimecho, and it gains a super effective hit on opposing Chimecho and Abra. Substitute is a fantastic move to protect Chimecho from status conditions and can be very difficult for the opponent to play around once Chimecho racks up a couple of Calm Mind boosts. Shock Wave can be used in the last slot alongside Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Dark to increase Chimecho's coverage as much as possible, although Chimecho benefits from the ability to support its team with this set.</p> <p>Spikes support is great with this set to pressure the opponent and push foes into easier KO range, particularly specially-weaker Pokemon like Piloswine and Graveler. Even without much defensive investment, Chimecho is a great answer to Hitmonchan, making Mawile and Kecleon ideal offensive partners to capitalize on this fact. Pokemon that can switch into the physical attacks that will be thrown at Chimecho make the best teammates for this set, Relicanth and Sableye in particular being good examples. Offensively, Murkrow is a great partner for Chimecho as it switches into Dark- and Ghost-type attacks easily despite its frailty and is extremely dangerous for Bellossom and Cacturne, both of which can interrupt a sweep from Chimecho.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes a more tank-based approach to Chimecho, allowing it to retain the ability to check Hitmonchan by OHKOing it with Psychic while being very hard for the opponent to switch into. Psychic + Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Electric has very good coverage in NU, the choice between the Hidden Powers coming down to the Pokemon you wish Chimecho to beat back. Hidden Power Electric gets a neutral hit on Dark- and Steel-types, as well as scoring a super effective hit on Murkrow and Crawdaunt, while Hidden Power Fire blasts Steel-types and OHKOes Tangela in its own sun. The last two moveslots allow Chimecho to deal with stall teams, with Toxic crippling major defensive threats like Sableye and Dewgong and Taunt preventing them from healing. However, Taunt only lasts two turns, making Heal Bell a decent alternative that allows Chimecho's team to better take on stall teams and not fear status as much. Finally, Yawn can be used to force switches or put a foe to sleep, which can create a great setup opportunity for a teammate.</p> <p>The EV spread is designed to make Chimecho as strong as possible while outspeeding a decent portion of offensive and defensive threats. At max Speed, Chimecho outruns Jolly Pupitar and Speed ties with neutral-natured Flareon. If running Speed investment seems unimportant to you, moving those EVs to HP is an option and makes Chimecho significantly more bulky, in particular giving it a chance to survive a Hydro Pump from Huntail in the rain and being able to OHKO Huntail in return with Hidden Power Electric.</p> <p>There are a ton of alternate move options that can be used effectively on this set, depending on what you want Chimecho to accomplish. Reflect or Light Screen can turn the tide against certain attackers, effectively allowing Chimecho to tank a hit from a foe it wouldn't be able to otherwise and KO it. Protect can be used in the last moveslot to help rack up Toxic damage and scout Choice Band users' moves. An alternate Hidden Power can be chosen if you want Chimecho to pick and choose its victims, with Hidden Power Dark being able to remove opposing Chimecho quite handily. Finally, running Substitute is an option to protect Chimecho from status and make it harder for the opponent to revenge kill Chimecho.</p> <p>This set forms a very good balanced core with Relicanth and Kecleon, with the three together checking almost every major offensive threat in the tier. This set works very well with Wish support, making Lickitung and Flareon great defensive partners as well. Pokemon that can capitalize on Chimecho's ability to break down the opponent's defenses are needed as teammates as well, with fellow special attackers, such as Huntail and Bellossom, being of particular importance. Finally, a check to opposing Calm Mind versions of Chimecho is needed when using this set, making a Dark-type like Murkrow or super strong physical attackers like Piloswine appreciated as teammates.</p>"

  "Trapinch": {
    "overview": "<p>Trapinch is actually not really a great Pokemon, but it has its uses, like everything. You could use Skarmory to lure Magneton, trap and kill it with Trapinch (needs prediction to work), then start Spiking away with Skarmory. It has a decent shot at killing Blissey (as long as she doesn't have Counter or Ice Beam) as well, while Dugtrio needs Adamant for this. However, this thing also cannot switch in on anything that attacks, unless the enemy is paralyzed and is using an attack with low Base Power.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>This is where you say \"Hidden Power random\". Hidden Power Flying could kill Breloom or Heracross, but good luck surviving their hits.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>If you're playing Trapinch with paralysis support, you'll want to bring it to about 99 Speed, which requires 176 EVs. This will ensure that the only Pokemon faster than Trapinch after they are paralyzed are Ninjask (who will never ever be paralyzed, anyway, if you are playing a decent player) and Electrode (who will, in the unlikely event that it is paralyzed, almost certainly Explode immediately after you manage to paralyze it), so, for all intents and purposes, Trapinch will be faster than any paralyzed opponent. Otherwise, Speed is mostly irrelevant on Trapinch, as it is second only to Shuckle for the rank of slowest Pokemon in the game. The remaining EVs for a Trapinch based around paralysis, therefore, should be something resembling 80 HP, 252 Attack, 176 Speed, Adamant. This is, interestingly enough, the exact point in HP after which Trapinch is best optimized by splitting defenses while pumping HP--at or below 80 HP EVs, you want to only invest in HP to optimize defenses, but after it, you'll want to invest in HP, Defense, and Special Defense.</p> <p>172 HP, 40 Defense, and 44 Special Defense EVs will optimize Trapinch's defensive stats with the EVs leftover after maxing Attack. This will make you 2HKOed by Tyranitar's Choice Band Hidden Power Bug or Rock Slide, 3HKOed by Heracross Choice Band or Guts activated Rock Slide, 2HKOed by non-Choice Band / Dragon Danced Tyranitar / Salamence Earthquake, and you'll usually survive Calm Mind Jirachi / Celebi Psychic if they don't invest in Special Attack EVs. If you want to make it guaranteed survival from Jirachi and Celebi (assuming they don't invest Special Attack), 152 HP and 104 Special Defense is the spread that guarantees survival and increases physical defensive abilities the most with the 256 EVs remaining after maxing Attack. If you want, you can lower Attack slightly to 232 EVs, and give Trapinch 28 HP and 248 Special Defense EVs, as this will guarantee survival from Modest Magneton Hidden Power Ice (and thus also guarantee survival from Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Ice from any Magneton, Raikou, or other non-Zapdos Electric). This will, coincidentally, allow Trapinch to always survive one Modest 252 Special Attack EV Blissey Ice Beam with at least 2 HP remaining.</p> <p>Always give Trapinch an Adamant nature, it really needs it to help damage stuff, and it's the only one of Trapinch's stats that really benefits from a 10% increase.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Hit it on the switch. You can't really counter a trapper since counters should be able to switch in, and if you're trapped by this thing you cannot switch (thanks Captain Obvious). Usually, after killing something (especially if it took damage), Trapinch becomes worthless for the rest of the match, and it'll be dead weight on the team it's on.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>This set can do some damage in normal play, and has an even easier time in UU. You can kill Hidden Power Fire Magneton with it, and with some Special Defense EVs it can survive an Alakazam Psychic and Earthquake back for the KO. Or with more Defense investment, survive Metagross Meteor Mash and kill it. Further, you can come in on very low HP Pokemon, especially those Flail / Reversal Pokemon, and kill them with Quick Attack. If you use another Quick Attacker for this, you will find they will switch out and come back later to kill something. But against Trapinch, no switching is allowed unless said Pokemon is a Flying type or has Levitate. Hidden Power Bug is for the OHKO on Celebi--if you can switch this in on Recover, Heal Bell or something, you will survive Psychic and kill it.</p>"},
      "200 Metagame": {"description": "<p>The non-Choice Banded, old 200 version of Trapinch. Not as powerful, but the most reliable Slaking killer in the game.

It still serves the Quick Attacker purpose, can still beat aforementioned Hidden Power Fire Magneton and survive one Alakazam Psychic to KO it.</p>"}
    }
  },
  "Raticate": {
    "overview": "<p>Raticate stands out as the fastest unboosted attacker in the tier (not counting the irrelevant Voltorb) and is an extremely potent offensive threat on teams built with the focus of sweeping with it. Apart from its Speed, which places it just above the base 95 Speed tier occupied primarily by Plusle and Haunter, it boasts a great STAB type in Normal, decent coverage options, a great ability that can take its threat level to 11, and enough flexibility to keep its opponents on their toes the second it makes its presence known. The only major downside to bringing Raticate is that nearly every team is going to be naturally prepared for it, whether that be through the near-omnipresence of Hitmonchan in the tier or through the presence of physically bulky checks to it like Sableye and Relicanth. Regardless, Raticate's deadliness is undeniable, and it's definitely worth consideration for building a team around.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Silk Scarf can be used in place of Choice Band, which can be great for bluffing; Double-Edge packs about as much power, and Raticate can switch moves. However, Raticate loses a ton of power on its other moves, which may or may not be worth it, depending on your team.</p> <p>As a Normal-type, Raticate has quite the expansive movepool, but almost none of it is worth using due to Raticate's stats. Substitute can be used with Silk Scarf, which can help with predicting and protects Raticate from Thunder Wave. Super Fang is an option on any Raticate set, and when used with Substitute it turns Raticate into a decent stallbreaker; unfortunately, Raticate's would-be main target, Sableye, is immune to it. Finally, Thunder Wave and Toxic are options to weaken some of Raticate's main checks, including Sableye and Relicanth.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Haunter is immune to basically every one of Raticate's moves apart from Shadow Ball, meaning it'll generally have a safe switch into Raticate and at worst will be able to easily revenge kill the Choice Band set. Steel- and Rock-types resist Raticate's STAB moves and can usually tank Hidden Power Ground, even when it's Guts-boosted, although they must all be wary of the Reversal set. Hitmonchan easily OHKOes Raticate with Mach Punch, but it cannot safely switch into most of Raticate's moves. Swalot checks the Choice Band set and almost completely walls the Reversal set, but it must be wary of accidentally giving Raticate a Guts boost. Defensive Tangela can easily tank anything from either set but isn't strong enough to 2HKO in return, so be careful when using it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Raticate is the fastest Choice Band user in the tier, and it is still just as strong as Pidgeot, cementing it as an undeniably scary offensive presence in the tier. With just Double-Edge, Shadow Ball, and Hidden Power Ground, Raticate covers every Pokemon in the tier that it needs to, meaning the last moveslot will mostly be filler. Quick Attack is probably the most useful of Raticate's options, protecting it from getting picked off by a weakened Hitmonchan's Mach Punch and weakened weather sweepers like Bellossom and Huntail. Facade is another option that becomes stronger than Double-Edge without the recoil should you be able to switch Raticate into a Toxic, which also powers up Raticate's other moves thanks to Guts.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is needed to outpace the base 95 Speed tier, which includes dangerous threats such as Plusle and Haunter, both of which Raticate OHKOes with the appropriate move. Super Fang is a good option for the last slot to spread around damage on the opponent's team if you can support Raticate well enough to get in and out quickly, and it is Raticate's best option for wearing down Relicanth and Mawile. However, Super Fang should only be used if you can expect to be able to switch Raticate out immediately, as being locked into Super Fang can create clear setup opportunities for dangerous threats like Huntail.</p> <p>When playing with Raticate, do all in your power to switch it into a Toxic to activate Guts, which takes Raticate from a moderately dangerous, semi-truck of an attacker to a nuclear-warhead-attached-to-a-wrecking-ball-being-launched-off-a-rocket sweeping powerhouse. This requires playing a bit riskily and predicting your opponent heavily, but the reward is worth the risk tenfold, and when playing against stall-centric teams, where Toxic is most likely to get thrown at your team, the risk level for playing hard and fast with Raticate is usually pretty low.</p> <p>Haunter is immune to three of the four moves on this set, so you need to bring a decent switch-in to it when using Choice Band Raticate, preferably something very specially bulky like Flareon or Chimecho. Spikes support is exceptionally good with this set as well, as nearly every check or counter to Raticate, apart from Haunter, is grounded, making Glalie and Roselia good teammates to lead off the team with. Rock- and Steel-types easily tank even a Guts-boosted Facade, making Water- and Grass-types good offensive teammates to bring with and wallbreak for Raticate. Finally, physically defensive Swalot and Lickitung can tank a Double-Edge from full health, making other physical attackers like Piloswine good teammates to bring with Raticate as well.</p>"
      },
      "Reversal": {
        "description": "<p>The idea of this set is pretty simple; get Raticate down to 1 HP and unleash hell the likes of which your opponent has never seen. The best way to accomplish this is to bring Raticate in on something that can likely OHKO it, like Hitmonchan without Mach Punch, use Substitute during the proceeding attacks or Endure the hit, and attack with Reversal from 1 HP, which after a Liechi Berry boost OHKOes even fully physically defensive Relicanth, and watch as your opponent's team just crumbles before you. This set is best used late-game so that switching Raticate in on something that will likely annihilate it doesn't look as suspicious. The choice between Substitute and Endure comes down to personal preference and your team build: if you are positive you can keep Spikes off the field or won't have to switch Raticate in on anything to eat a hit, using Substitute is probably the safer option; if you are confident in your prediction skills and don't want to have to accommodate for Rapid Spin on your team, Endure is probably the better option.</p> <p>Shadow Ball is needed so that Haunter, Chimecho, and Sableye don't just completely wall this set. The choice between Quick Attack and Return is tough. Quick Attack is a better option than any other STAB move apart from Return because a full-powered Reversal is nearly as strong as a full-powered Facade (which is hard to use on this set considering if Raticate is poisoned or burned, it won't be at 1 HP for long, and if it's paralyzed it's too slow to sweep anyway). Quick Attack also protects Raticate from Mach Punch and other Quick Attacks thrown its way. Return is still an option if having a strong STAB move when not at 1 HP is desired, and Return is Raticate's best option for Poison-types if you're scared of your opponent packing an Arbok or Swalot.</p> <p>Liechi Berry with a Jolly nature is the main option due to the fact that Raticate is the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the tier when Jolly, meaning a Speed boost from Salac Berry will usually be unwarranted. Salac Berry does have its use when used with an Adamant nature, as Raticate is then able to hit slightly harder when unboosted as well as outspeed Sunny Day Bellossom and Rain Dance Huntail once boosted. However, Raticate loses a ton of power without the Liechi Berry boost.</p> <p>Endeavor is an option on the set as well in place of Quick Attack, which can bring any one Pokemon down to 1 HP before Raticate goes down itself. This will rarely be helpful, but if you're unable to remove the opponent's Swalot, this will be Raticate's best option to help the rest of team. Taunt can be used to force the opponent into attacking Raticate and activating its Berry, which eliminates any mind games the opponent can play with you and prevents Raticate from getting hit by status, but if the opponent attacks the turn Raticate uses Taunt and OHKOes it, all will have been for naught.</p> <p>Physically defensive Swalot is about the only major block to this set, making Chimecho and Ground-types like Piloswine good teammates. Diglett deserves a special mention for basically ensuring Swalot is removed or at least weakened enough for Raticate to break through. Physically defensive Whiscash and Wailord can tank a +1 Reversal, meaning Grass-types are good partners as well to eliminate or weaken them before sweeping. Defensive Pelipper is another good check to Raticate, making Plusle a good teammate (and Hidden Power Grass Plusle will blow past Whiscash as well). Finally, Venomoth and defensive Tangela can check this set as well, making Flareon a good teammate.</p>"

  "Golbat": {
    "overview": "<p>Golbat is one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier and has a phenomenal Poison / Flying typing, giving it a 4x resistance to Fighting and Grass along with an immunity to Ground. This makes it one of the best checks to the best Pokemon in the tier, Hitmonchan, given it is not running the uncommon Rock Slide. Golbat's base 80 Attack is decent, especially given its powerful physical STAB attack in Sludge Bomb. However, Golbat struggles to deal with the multiple good Rock-types that are in the tier. It also struggles with Steel-types, especially Mawile, as it forces Golbat to predict with Hidden Power Ground and even then can become setup fodder that allows Mawile to Baton Pass to a teammate.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A set utilizing Screech is a good option to help Golbat wallbreak, being able to 2HKO even the bulkiest Pokemon in the tier with neutral attacks. More importantly, it allows Golbat to be able to beat Sableye easily late-game. It also forces a lot of switches, making Golbat pair nicely with Spikes support. A bulky set with Substitute can be used to help ease prediction. An even more bulky EV spread can be run to check the likes of Hitmonchan more effectively, but this takes a lot away from Golbat's offensive presence. Haze can be run to prevent Pokemon from setting up on Golbat, and Thief can be used to cripple Pokemon dependent on Leftovers as their source of recovery. Curse is an option for Golbat to set up itself, but it reduces Golbat's appealing Speed that makes Golbat a popular option. Sunny Day can be used to set up sun for another Pokemon to take advantage of while also removing rain to prevent Huntail and Swift Swim Relicanth from utilizing it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Mawile is immune to Golbat's STAB Sludge Bomb, resists Aerial Ace, and forces Golbat to predict with Hidden Power Ground to even hit it for chip damage. Even Choice Band Golbat will do less than 40% to Mawile with Hidden Power Ground, letting it set up for almost no cost and then Baton Pass the boosts and possibly a Substitute to one of its teammates. Sableye completely walls the Choice Band set, as Golbat cannot 2HKO it with any move, and Sableye only fears Toxic from the bulky Leftovers set. Rock-types such as Sudowoodo, Relicanth, and Graveler resist both of Golbat's STAB attacks and can punish back with a super effective Rock Slide, but the latter two must watch out for a potential Giga Drain. While it can't take a Hidden Power Ground well, Plusle will always have at least one chance to KO even bulky Golbat from full health, so you need to predict well when anticipating it to come in, as it will almost always force Golbat out. Pikachu is also a potential revenge killer that forces a Speed tie with Jolly Golbat. Poison-types such as Swalot and Arbok check Golbat well, and Chimecho fares well against it unless Golbat is holding a Choice Band.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Band, Golbat's already decent Attack is improved substantially, turning it into an effective revenge killer, cleaner, and wallbreaker. Sludge Bomb is Golbat's main STAB attack, hitting Grass-types very hard and neutral targets for good damage. Aerial Ace is the preferred STAB Flying-type attack to allow Golbat to run Hidden Power Ground. Hidden Power Ground hits the Rock- and Steel-types that Golbat usually struggles with. The last slot goes to Giga Drain, which hits Relicanth and Graveler harder than Hidden Power Ground would. Shadow Ball can be a good alternative option to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Chimecho and Haunter super effectively. Maximum Attack and Speed investment with a Naive nature ensures that Golbat will hit as hard and as fast as possible and will at worst Speed tie with opposing Vigoroth and Venomoth.</p> <p>Golbat is one of the best offensive switch-ins to Hitmonchan, but Rock Slide should be scouted for to ensure that Golbat is not KOed. Golbat should be kept as healthy as possible to check Fighting- and Grass-types to its maximum potential, as without Leftovers, it gets worn down quite easily. It outspeeds the majority of the tier and can be used to clean up late-game as long as all Rock- and Steel-types are properly dealt with beforehand. Golbat should avoid getting locked into moves without knowing or being able to guess most of the opponent's team, as it can become potential setup fodder for Pokemon like Pupitar, Mawile, and Plusle. Golbat has the option of running Quick Attack to beat out weakened threats, Double-Edge for an overall powerful attack, and Shadow Ball over Giga Drain to hit Psychic-types like Chimecho harder.</p> <p>Golbat appreciates Pokemon that can deal with Rock-, Ground-, and Steel-types. Whiscash is a particularly good partner for this reason. Grass-types such as Bellossom and Tangela help eliminate Rock- and Ground-types that wall Golbat. Diglett traps and KOes Mawile and Flareon, meaning Golbat can switch in and stay in more easily.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Leftovers": {
        "description": "<p>The goal of this set is to make the most of Golbat's typing to check certain Pokemon like Hitmonchan, Roselia, and Sableye throughout the match and provide the team with a decent pivot and backup cleaner. Sludge Bomb is Golbat's main STAB attack, hitting Grass-types very hard and neutral targets for good damage. Aerial Ace is the preferred STAB Flying-type attack to allow Golbat to run Hidden Power Ground. Hidden Power Ground hits the Rock- and Steel-types that Golbat usually struggles with. Toxic allows Golbat to put a foe on a timer, wearing down potential walls that might switch into Golbat. Whirlwind phazes the opposing Pokemon, resetting stat boosts and potentially revealing more of your opponent's team. Taunt can be used to prevent setup and other status moves, and can potentially allow Golbat to outstall certain Pokemon like Sableye by blocking its use of Recover. Giga Drain is an option to hit Relicanth, Pupitar, and Graveler harder than Hidden Power Ground would. Protect over Hidden Power Ground is an option that allows Golbat to gain an extra turn of Leftovers recovery, which greatly increases longevity, as Hidden Power Ground isn't doing much to common Steel-types without the power of Choice Band behind it. The given EV spread maximizes HP and has enough Speed investment to make Golbat outspeed Jolly Hitmonchan, with the rest of the EVs thrown into Attack to boost Golbat's offensive potential.</p> <p>This Golbat set can be used to switch into Fighting-types more liberally, having the passive recovery of Leftovers to help it out. Golbat can also be used to deal with Grass-types, which usually rely on their STAB moves to defeat foes. Golbat can switch into powerful Earthquakes from many Pokemon, but because many Ground-type Pokemon are also Rock-type, Golbat needs to make use of effective double switching to get in a teammate that can take on these Pokemon one-on-one.</p> <p>Golbat appreciates teammates that can deal with Rock-, Ground-, and Steel-types. Whiscash, Hitmonchan, and Graveler are particularly good partners to perform this task. Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Dewgong, Seadra, and Mawile can cover Golbat's Ice weakness. In return, these Pokemon like the removal of Fighting-types, which Golbat does well. Grass-types such as Bellossom and Tangela help eliminate Rock- and Ground-types that wall Golbat. Diglett can remove Rock- and Steel-types, particularly Mawile, which Golbat has significant trouble playing around without good prediction.</p>"

  "Parasect": {
    "overview": "<p>Parasect is NU for a good reason: its typing is awful. With two 4x weaknesses (to Fire and Flying) as well as weakness to Ice Beam, it really has a hard time coming into anything. Its really, really low Speed isn't helping either. Even in NU it is outclassed both as a Grass and a Bug Pokemon by Sunflora and Roselia for the former and Dustox for the latter. It does get some very good moves like Aromatherapy and Spore, but overall it isn't exactly worth it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Parasect could try out using Thief, but this works best if it has a physical attack or two, as otherwise, it might end up stealing a Choice Band, thus rendering itself fairly useless. Parasect has a decent amount of Defense, and thus can survive even a Choice Band Pidgeot Return without any EVs whatsoever, and max HP allows it to survive a Choice Band Double-Edge, which can take quite a few enemies by surprise, but watch out for Flying moves. Stun Spore is good for alternate status and completely screws up Pidgeot and Fearow. Aerial Ace can be used with Hidden Power Bug, but it hits so few things it's not generally worth it.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>Needs a lot of HP so it can last at least one turn. A few Speed EVs can be useful, primarily for Sudowoodo. Other than that, you'll want to give it a lot in the attacking stat of choice on the attacking sets, and boost the defenses for support-oriented Parasect.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ariados is immune to Spore thanks to Insomnia, and resists Hidden Power Bug and Sludge Bomb. However, it has to beware of Hidden Power Rock, as it will take a large chunk out of it. Mawile is immune to its main attack, Sludge Bomb, and resists just about anything else Parasect can throw at it, especially with that Intimidate, letting it potentially set something up with a Swords Dance or a Substitute. Glalie, although not particularly sturdy against Parasect's attacks, can scare it off with STAB Ice Beam and use that to set up Spikes. Sudowoodo shrugs off whatever Parasect might do, and attacks with STAB Rock attacks, but greatly fears special attacking sets. Murkrow and Pidgeot are also the big threats to Parasect, but have to worry about Hidden Power Rock, and even Sludge Bomb takes a hefty chunk of life. Murkrow, however, has the advantage of being immune to Spore, but Pidgeot resists Hidden Power Bug.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {"description": "<p>A support-oriented Parasect. Puts something to Sleep, heals the team of status, and takes on Choice Banded Ground / Fighting attacks. Hidden Power Bug is good for decent damage all around thanks to STAB, but Hidden Power Rock hits the omnipresent Choice Band Birds, Pidgeot and Murkrow. Only use Hidden Power Rock in NU, Hidden Power Bug is superior in UU.</p>"},
      "Swords Dance": {"description": "<p>Because people expect Spore, you might not want to use that right away. For instance, if they have Murkrow, you've just given them a free switch to come in and use Choice Banded Drill Peck on your team; the same goes for Sludge Bomb Ariados. For this reason, it's generally best to open with Swords Dance if you predict a Sleep Talker, or Hidden Power Rock if you predict one of those two. Hidden Power Rock is a good opener if you have no idea what to do, because the common switches into Parasect are weak to it. Hidden Power Ground can do something to Mawile and maybe Sudowoodo, but Sudowoodo has STAB on Rock Slide, so you can't stay in on it. Once again, only use Hidden Power Rock in NU, Hidden Power Bug and Ground are superior in UU.</p>"},
      "Special Attacker": {"description": "<p>This set's main power is that it can kill its main counters through surprise. For instance, Mawile will take quite a bit of damage from Hidden Power Fire, and Sudowoodo is 2-3HKOed by Giga Drain. If you use Hidden Power Ice, you can still hit Murkrow and Pidgeot on the switch super effective, so they'll likely think you're using Hidden Power Rock. For this reason, Growth and Sunny Day should generally be used later on in the match (and also because you need to make sure they don't have any guys that can OHKO Parasect). This is inferior to Pokemon like Vileplume in UU; the accuracy of Spore over Sleep Powder does not make up for the worse stats and ability.</p>"}

  "Venomoth": {
    "overview": "<p>Venomoth's Speed advantage over other common leads combined with Sleep Powder makes it easy for it to provide early-game support. After neutralizing a foe, Venomoth can easily make use of Baton Pass and Substitute to freely get a teammate into an advantageous position. Furthermore, despite Venomoth's uninspiring damage output, Baton Pass helps it keep momentum up against possible switch-ins like Metang and Sableye. Unfortunately, Venomoth is rather limited beyond these options, and its fragility makes it a poor check to Pokemon like Hitmonchan and Arbok that it'd like to switch into. Venomoth also has no means of boosting its stats apart from Silver Wind and Berries and has to use its much lower Attack stat if it wants to make use of its STAB moves. Despite these faults, Venomoth makes for a capable lead and team player on offensively inclined teams that are looking for something a little different.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead Support": {
        "description": "<p>Venomoth's biggest perk is that it's one of the fastest Pokemon in NU with a sleeping move, and this set aims to make the most of this fact. Venomoth works very well in the lead slot, as it outspeeds most of the other common leads, primarily Glalie and Hitmonchan, and instantly puts them out of commission with Sleep Powder. Substitute allows Venomoth to safely Baton Pass out to a teammate. Sludge Bomb or Psychic ensure Venomoth isn't set up bait. Sludge Bomb gets a great hit on Flareon, Bellossom, and Roselia, while Psychic has a bit more oomph against Arbok and Hitmonchan. Stun Spore is a decent alternative in the third moveslot that helps support the team and can deter some dangerous Pokemon like Murkrow from freely switching into Venomoth.</p> <p>Maximum Speed investment is needed to Speed tie with opposing Venomoth and Golbat and securely outspeed Seadra and Glalie. Maximum HP investment allows Venomoth to more easily check the likes of Hitmonchan, and it can allow Venomoth to more easily reenter the field and attempt to land another Sleep Powder later in the match. A Petaya or Liechi Berry can be run to give Venomoth the option of Baton Passing a stat boost to a teammate. Lum Berry is another option to win the rare Venomoth duel and secure a sleep against the opponent. Thief and Toxic are good options to cripple the defensive Pokemon that would otherwise have an easy time switching into Venomoth like Sableye and Flareon.</p> <p>Diglett pairs naturally well with Venomoth, as it can trap and eliminate a few of the Pokemon that have an easy time switching into Venomoth, namely Flareon, Mawile, and Metang. Venomoth fits best on offensive teams that need the immediate momentum provided by Sleep Powder and need Glalie's Spikes prevented from being set up from turn one. Good offensive teammates that pair well with Venomoth include Murkrow, Plusle, and Raticate, as they can blow through a few of the Pokemon that are likely to switch into Venomoth and don't require setup to become offensive threats.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Venomoth's usable movepool is quite shallow, and most other offensive or supportive variants are going to be done better by Pokemon like Haunter and Chimecho. One option not mentioned so far is Screech, which when combined with Baton Pass, can be an infuriating set for your opponent to deal with, as they have to choose whether to stay in and brunt the incoming Sludge Bomb or Hidden Power Ground from Venomoth at -2 or allow Venomoth to scout their switch-in with Baton Pass. For other special attacking options, Giga Drain and Hidden Power Fire have some use as coverage for specific Pokemon, namely Relicanth for Giga Drain and Metang for Hidden Power Fire, but overall Venomoth is better suited to switching out of these targets to a teammate with Baton Pass.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Countering Venomoth is not difficult, as it isn't exactly Earth-shatteringly powerful, but it is tough to pin it down because of Baton Pass allowing it to keep momentum. RestTalk Dewgong and Wailord are probably the best overall switch-ins to Venomoth, as they can absorb Sleep Powder and other status from Venomoth and take a pittance from any of its moves apart from rare Screech sets, while they can easily 3HKO Venomoth with Surf and Ice Beam in return. Murkrow can switch into Sleep Powder and Psychic for free, easily outspeeds Venomoth, and OHKOes it with Drill Peck. Once Sleep Powder is out of the equation, countering Venomoth becomes an entirely easier ballgame. Chimecho and Flareon easily OHKO Venomoth with Psychic and Fire Blast. Rock-types such as Sudowoodo and Relicanth have to be wary of Giga Drain but will otherwise be able to tank Venomoth's moves and OHKO it with Rock Slide. Finally, faster Pokemon such as Pidgeot, Raticate, and Haunter can easily outspeed and KO Venomoth.</p>"

  "Diglett": {
    "overview": "<p>Diglett is an extremely metagame-defining and unique Pokemon in NU because of its ability Arena Trap, which allows it to trap and remove many key threats in the tier, including Flareon, Pikachu, and Pupitar, as well as weakened Hitmonchan and Sableye. It also possesses a great Speed tier, making it one of the best revenge killers available, and it has good coverage and just enough offensive power to get the job done. However, Diglett has almost no defensive utility at all, making it difficult to directly switch into Pokemon it would want to trap.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Diglett could potentially run an Adamant nature to help secure KOs on bulky Pokemon like Metang, but it then fails to outspeed the multitude of Pokemon with a base 90 Speed stat. Substitute and Liechi Berry can be used to give Diglett a damage boost versus faster foes and the ability to switch moves, but this combination is sometimes unreliable factoring Spikes or prior chip damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Diglett is extremely weak, and even resisted attacks can KO it. Additionally, almost anything faster than Diglett can revenge kill it. The best way to deal with Diglett is to not bring too many Pokemon weak to it and have Pokemon that can set up on Choice-locked Diglett's Earthquake. Chimecho is unable to be trapped by Diglett and is able to set up on Choice-locked Diglett's Earthquake, and Sunny Day + Solar Beam users like Bellossom and Tangela can as well. Many defensive Pokemon like Sableye and Wailord can survive Diglett's relatively weak attacks and take advantage of Diglett's pathetic defenses.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trapper": {
        "description": "<p>Arena Trap is what sets Diglett apart from the other Ground-types in the tier that are more bulky and powerful, allowing it to strategically remove many Pokemon in the tier. Diglett's only job is to trap and remove the opponent's Pokemon. Therefore, EVs are placed fully into Attack and Speed with a Jolly nature to make it as fast and powerful as possible, Speed tying with Plusle and outspeeding a crowded base 90 Speed tier with Pokemon like Pikachu, Golbat, Ponyta, Venomoth, and Vigoroth. Earthquake + Rock Slide provide EdgeQuake coverage that lets Diglett hit the Flying-types that it cannot trap with its ability. Sludge Bomb provides a way for Diglett to damage Grass-types such as Tangela and Bellossom, though both need to be significantly weakened and Sunny Day must not be in effect before Diglett attempts to trap them. Double-Edge provides good, powerful neutral coverage that can help clean up at the end of the game, provided there are no Ghost-types remaining on the opponent's side. Toxic can be used to badly poison Pokemon that Diglett cannot KO and would normally switch out to avoid Toxic from other Pokemon like Relicanth, such as Sableye and Vigoroth. Hidden Power Bug can be used over Sludge Bomb for more consistent damage to Chimecho, but it hits Grass-types for significantly less damage.</p> <p>Diglett is extraordinarily frail and is best used as a revenge killer for Pokemon like Flareon and Mawile, as well as weakened Pokemon that need to be finished off. Scouting for Baton Pass, phazing moves, and attacks that can KO Diglett is very important. Despite Mawile being something that Diglett wants to trap and remove, it can easily Baton Pass straight out of trapping if Diglett hard switches into it. Diglett also risks getting hit by an attack, and while Diglett will barely survive an uninvested Brick Break from full health, it will always be KOed by Hidden Power Steel. As a result, Diglett appreciates Baton Pass support from Pokemon such as Mawile, Plusle, and Venomoth to allow it to get in safely. Mawile in particular is useful for its ability to lure in Flareon, which Diglett can trap and remove effectively. Plusle can lure in Pupitar and weakened Roselia, so Spikes support is very useful. Diglett appreciates Spikes support from Pokemon like Roselia and Glalie, as it helps Diglett get Pokemon into range of Earthquake to be removed.</p>"

This combination is supplemented by useful utility in Substitute and Endure as well as decent coverage options, which help Abra avoid being easily revenge killed or walled. Unfortunately, Abra's bulk is nonexistent; even Choice Band Hitmonchan's resisted Mach Punch can KO Abra after one layer of Spikes, and almost anything naturally faster than Abra such as Raticate or Murkrow will easily OHKO it. Additionally, certain Pokemon like Chimecho, Sableye, and Kecleon will always reliably check Abra defensively, meaning it requires a fair bit of support to bypass such checks.</p>",

Thunder Punch can also be considered to hit both Crawdaunt and Murkrow; it's also Abra's best way to damage bulky Water-types like Wailord and Dewgong. Encore lets Abra lock foes into non-attacking moves, which can give it the opportunity to set up Calm Mind; however, Abra rarely gets the chance to use it. Hidden Power Dark gives Abra a much greater matchup against Calm Mind Chimecho, although it provides overall worse coverage than Fire Punch.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Sableye: Even with Spikes support and Calm Mind, Abra struggles to break through Sableye before it uses Recover to gain back any lost HP and KOes Abra in return with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Raticate, Murkrow, and Pidgeot can't reliably switch into Abra, but they easily OHKO it.

Fire Punch complements Psychic well by targeting foes resistant or immune to it like Metang, Mawile, and Cacturne; it's also Abra's best way to hit Chimecho and Sableye. Substitute provides Abra with insurance against revenge killers and helps activate Salac Berry. Endure is an alternative to Substitute that lets Abra get its Speed boost from its Berry when faced with a faster attacker, although it's much more prediction reliant and can lead to Abra giving up momentum. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Abra hit hard and Speed tie with Pokemon like Golbat and Pikachu. 4 HP EVs allow Abra to activate its Berry after three uses of Substitute. Salac Berry enables Abra to be even scarier late-game, giving it the jump on Pokemon like Haunter, Plusle, and Murkrow.</p> <p>Abra's main focus should be on sweeping late-game once its checks are weakened and removed, although it can make use of its solid Speed tier and great power to revenge kill early- and mid-game. By bringing Abra in against a Pokemon like Roselia that it can easily force out, you gain a free turn to boost with Calm Mind or set up Substitute.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Spikes from Roselia, Glalie, or Cacturne benefits Abra greatly, helping it get by Pokemon like Lickitung, Torkoal, and Flareon more easily. Similarly, special wallbreakers such as Haunter, Flareon, and Wailord wear down switch-ins to Abra like Kecleon and opposing Wailord. Haunter in particular is a solid partner—especially Thief variants—because it's great at drawing in and weakening Sableye and Chimecho. Due to Abra's extremely poor bulk, it's very prone to being revenge killed by attackers like Raticate and Pidgeot; as a result, pairing it with sturdy checks such as Sudowoodo, Relicanth, and Sableye is beneficial. A slow Baton Pass user like Mawile is also great, since it can make getting Abra safely onto the field much easier.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Machoke is largely, if not almost completely, outclassed by Hitmonchan in almost every role that it would aim to fill on a team. However, as the only other available Fighting-type, and because it is far more physically bulky, it does have an advantage over Hitmonchan in its ability to both switch into and threaten certain physical attackers, particularly Pupitar, Raticate, and Piloswine, and holds a niche in the tier as a Bulk Up sweeper. Machoke also has a great ability in Guts, which allows it to hit astronomically harder than Hitmonchan if you play your cards right. Ultimately though, Hitmonchan's unpredictability, splashability, great STAB options, Speed, and ability to break through certain counters that Machoke cannot means you're unlikely to see Machoke much in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Machoke is capable of running a few other sets and alternative move options, but most are done almost 100% better by Hitmonchan. Most notably, Substitute + Bulk Up and Substitute + Focus Punch sets are pretty viable, but Substitute works counter to Guts, which is one of Machoke's biggest selling points. For alternative move options, Machoke is bulky enough to make use of Counter pretty effectively, but most attacks coming its way are likely going to be special. Body Slam and Rock Tomb give Machoke a way to slow down the opposition and can make switching into it a bit harder for the opponent. Light Screen can be used pretty effectively to protect Machoke from Chimecho and Haunter switch-ins and give it the chance to take them out, but there are typically better options for doing so and Machoke still isn't really specially bulky enough to fully take advantage of it. Finally, Low Kick is another alternative STAB option, but the NU metagame is pretty light, meaning it'll likely be outdamaged by Machoke's other STAB options most of the time.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Chimecho is the top counter to any Machoke set, as it can easily switch in, outspeed, and OHKO even max HP Machoke with Psychic. Haunter can also switch into most of Machoke's attacks, although it has a bigger fear of Hidden Power Ghost than Chimecho, and easily OHKO with Psychic. Sableye has to be wary of giving Machoke a Guts boost, but without one it completely walls Machoke unless Machoke gathers too many Bulk Up boosts. Defensive Tangela isn't 2HKOed by anything Machoke can throw at it except a Choice Band-boosted Focus Punch, and it can easily Leech Seed stall out Machoke. Arbok and Swalot can wall Machoke pretty effectively if it lacks Earthquake and proceed to take it out with a couple of Sludge Bombs, but they need to be careful of giving Machoke a Guts boost. Pelipper resists Machoke's Fighting STAB moves and can proceed to stall Machoke out or easily 2HKO it with Hydro Pump if using an offensive set, although it doesn't like Rock Slide. Most Bug-types, particularly Venomoth, are also good switch-ins if they avoid Rock Slide. Finally, most special attackers are generally good answers to Machoke, as its Special Defense pales in comparison to its Defense.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>After a Bulk Up, Machoke becomes incredibly hard to break physically, making it a great option to plow through the abundant Rock- and Steel-types in the tier and meaning it's tough for Flying-types to revenge kill it. Revenge is the chosen STAB move because Machoke will almost always be going second, and this set is meant to tank through the opponent's team, meaning it thrives on being hit first and dishing the damage back out. Cross Chop is still an option for an always-powerful move, though the accuracy hurts its viability a bit. Hidden Power Ghost is needed coverage for Haunter and Chimecho, though Machoke should never stay in versus Chimecho, as it's almost always OHKOed by Psychic. Earthquake is Machoke's best option to take out Swalot and Arbok as well as being Machoke's best move for Roselia and Sableye. Rock Slide helps take out the Bug- and Flying-types likely to switch into Machoke, although Revenge will normally be doing enough to the two main Flying-types, Pidgeot and Murkrow, as they're neutral to Fighting. Lastly, Encore is also a very viable option which can make setting up far easier and forces switches. Locking something like Mawile into a status move also gives Machoke the Guts boost it loves.</p> <p>44 Speed EVs let Machoke outpace minimum Speed Mawile and other base 50s. More or less Speed can be run depending on how you want to play Machoke, with 0 Speed being an option to ensure Machoke goes second against as many Pokemon as possible in order to power up Revenge. A physically or specially defensive spread can also be used by moving the Attack EVs to whichever defensive stat you want, since even with no Attack investment, at +1 and with a Guts boost Machoke is going to be hitting like a truck regardless. A specially defensive spread can help Machoke take out the likes of Dewgong and Glalie, while a physically defensive spread can allow Machoke to more easily switch into Rock-types like Pupitar.</p> <p>Focus Punch and Brick Break can be used as alternative STAB moves, but both are less useful than Revenge and Cross Chop in most cases. If using a Substitute + Bulk Up set, with Substitute used in the last slot over Rock Slide or Encore, Focus Punch becomes a far more desirable option to consider, as the additional power is incredible for breaking normally safe switch-ins like Chimecho. If using Machoke as a lure to open up a Hitmonchan sweep, Hidden Power Bug is also an option to destroy defensive Tangela, but overall Hidden Power Ghost is more important for Haunter and Chimecho.</p> <p>Special walls are needed teammates to bring when using Machoke to switch in on the inevitable opposing Chimecho and Haunter, making Kecleon, Dewgong, and Lickitung good teammates. Hitmonchan is a good teammate to consider, as most teams will be unprepared to take on two strong Fighting-types, allowing either Hitmonchan or Machoke to weaken their counters for the other to sweep.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Machoke's great coverage and high Attack stat scream for a Choice Band set, and because Machoke is significantly tankier than Hitmonchan physically, it does hold a viable niche in the tier. Cross Chop is the recommended STAB move due to its high power and relative consistency, but the accuracy can be gut-wrenching at times, making Brick Break a decent alternative. Hidden Power Ghost is needed for Haunter and Chimecho and generally pairs well with Machoke's Fighting-type STAB move. Rock Slide lets Machoke take out certain Flying- and Bug-types looking to switch into Machoke's Fighting STAB move, particularly Pelipper and Venomoth. The move in the last slot will be rarely used, but Earthquake is still needed for Swalot and Arbok, and it is Machoke's hardest hit against Sableye.</p> <p>The biggest difference when using Choice Band Machoke over Choice Band Hitmonchan is you want to try to switch Machoke into predicted status moves to activate Guts. While Hitmonchan would be utterly crippled and walled by Toxic Sableye, Machoke can actually use it to its advantage and cleanly 2HKO even 252 / 252+ Sableye with Earthquake if it's hit by Toxic. This makes Machoke theoretically a better choice to combat heavy stall teams, but in practice Machoke will still be worn down pretty quickly and is more easy to outspeed than Hitmonchan, meaning even the slower stall teams won't find it too difficult to revenge kill Machoke.</p> <p>44 Speed EVs let Machoke outpace minimum Speed Mawile and other base 50s. From there, Attack is maxed out and the remaining EVs are placed into HP to increase Machoke's bulk as much as possible. Focus Punch can be used over any of the moves on this set, and after a Guts boost it becomes the single strongest attack in the tier without any needed setup. It can be pretty tricky to use, but it has a ton of payoff if it connects over Cross Chop, notably OHKOing Huntail, 2HKOing Chimecho, and OHKOing defensive Tangela after a Guts boost. Revenge is another alternative reliable STAB option, but it doesn't garner any notable KOs over Brick Break, and Machoke typically wants to outspeed what it can with this set. Finally, Facade can be used somewhere on this set to take advantage of the status that Machoke will likely absorb for your team, and it'll hit nearly as hard as Cross Chop without the risk of missing.</p> <p>Teammates are needed to take on Chimecho and Haunter, making special walls like Kecleon and Dark-types like Murkrow good teammates. Flying- and Bug-types are pretty dangerous for this set as well, particularly bulky examples like Pelipper, making Rock- and Steel-types good teammates, particularly Mawile and Relicanth.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With the ability to run a physically based offensive set, Weepinbell differentiates itself from other prominent sun hyper offense Pokemon such as Tangela and Bellossom. While Tropius does compete with Weepinbell as a physical Chlorophyll sweeper, Weepinbell sports not only a higher Attack stat but also higher Base Power on its physical STAB move. However, Weepinbell is exceedingly frail, being 2HKOed even by neutral hits such as Mawile's Hidden Power Steel and Relicanth's Rock Slide. Weepinbell is also not particularly fast outside of sun, making it susceptible to being revenge killed. Weepinbell has an exceedingly difficult time breaking past certain Pokemon like Golbat and Pelipper, as its Poison + Ground coverage only covers so much. Lastly, Weepinbell does not fit on any team archetype outside of sun hyper offense, as it's otherwise outclassed by other Grass- and Poison-types such as Cacturne, Roselia, and Arbok.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit Bug- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Venomoth, Yanma, and Pidgeot for super effective damage. However, this comes at the cost of no longer being able to deal with Steel-types such as Mawile and Metang adequately. Hidden Power Fire can be used with a more specially oriented attacking set. However, such a set makes it hard for Weepinbell to distinguish itself from other special Chlorophyll sweepers such as Tangela and Bellossom. Leftovers gives Weepinbell gradual recovery, but Weepinbell is so incredibly frail that what little health it would restore pales in comparison to the extra damage output Poison Barb offers Sludge Bomb.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Golbat is the ultimate check to Weepinbell, as it resists all three of its attacks and KOes back with Aerial Ace. Golbat must be careful of the rare Hidden Power Rock, however. Pelipper is another great check to Weepinbell, as it can take an unboosted Sludge Bomb and fire back with Ice Beam. Tangela can also act as a stop to Weepinbell, as the Sunny Day sweeper set outspeeds Weepinbell and KOes it with Hidden Power, and the physically defensive set can stomach an unboosted Sludge Bomb and retaliate with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore. Any Pokemon that is faster than Weepinbell outside of sun, including Hitmonchan, Haunter, and Pidgeot, can take advantage of its frailty. If Weepinbell opts not to run Solar Beam and Sleep Clause is in effect, Huntail can tank Sludge Bomb, set up Rain Dance, and countersweep.</p>",

Hidden Power Ground hits Rock-, Poison-, and Steel-types such as Magcargo, Arbok, Mawile, and Metang. Solar Beam helps Weepinbell break through Water-types and is the best attacking option against physically defensive Pokemon such as Lairon and Graveler. Alternatively, Swords Dance boosts Weepinbell's Attack stat to absurd levels, allowing it to OHKO a significant portion of the metagame if successfully used, while Sleep Powder generates free turns for Weepinbell to set up sun once more or fire off extra hits.</p> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs allow Weepinbell to fire strong attacks and outspeed the entirety of the metagame under the sun. An alternate spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe and a Jolly nature can be used if one opts not to run Solar Beam. Poison Barb boosts Weepinbell's strongest and most spammable attack, Sludge Bomb, to enable important KOs such as a 2HKO on physically defensive Tangela. Suicide leads such as Glalie and Swalot can assist not only Weepinbell but also other members of a sun hyper offense team by setting up Spikes or Sunny Day and then using Explosion to allow the next Pokemon to switch in safely. Bellossom, Tangela, and Flareon make fantastic partners as well, forming a solid offense core that takes advantage of the sun activating Chlorophyll and boosting Fire-type STAB attacks. Pokemon that can beat both Golbat and Pelipper such as Sudowoodo, Pikachu, and Plusle can help Weepinbell sweep. Weepinbell should be brought in late-game, as it lacks the power to immediately break through bulky Pokemon such as Sableye without a Swords Dance boost but excels at cleaning up thanks to its high Speed in the sun and mixed capability, making it rough for offense teams to face.</p>"

  "Graveler": {
    "overview": "<p>Graveler is one of many Rock-types in the tier, but it separates itself from the pack by getting STAB on Earthquake, carrying Explosion in its back pocket, and being immediately stronger and physically bulkier than Pupitar. What's more, it has a great base 95 Attack stat which is made even better when backed by a Choice Band, and Graveler makes a good check to the multitude of Normal- and Flying-types of the tier. However, Graveler needs to be very wary of Hidden Power Grass that's often carried on sets specifically to take it, Relicanth, and Whiscash out in one move. It's also extremely slow, and despite its advantages, it faces stiff competition from Sudowoodo and Relicanth for the Rock-type team slot as they are much more flexible in their movesets, sport better defensive stats and typings that make them less susceptible to their foe's coverage moves, and provide all-around better team synergy than Graveler.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A defensive set is certainly viable, as Graveler packs the typing and bulk to check Normal-, Flying-, and Poison-types throughout a game. However, a full defensive set is almost entirely outclassed by Relicanth due to its higher bulk and slightly better typing. A SubPunch set is powerful, but less useful on Graveler than on Sudowoodo due to Graveler getting STAB on Earthquake. As for individual moves, Counter can be a nice tool to use, but most of its targets are going to be hit harder by Rock Slide or Earthquake. Finally, Rock Tomb can allow a teammate to initiate a sweep against a target like Vigoroth, but most times the higher damage output from Rock Slide is just going to be more useful, and the only major target that Graveler is going to outspeed itself after using Rock Tomb is Dewgong.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best initial check to Graveler is any Water-type with decent physical bulk; examples include Wailord, Whiscash, and Kingler. The Graveler user won't typically Explode immediately, so they will usually have a safe first switch in and can easily OHKO with any Water move. Defensive Tangela is probably the best overall counter to Graveler, and it really only fears Explosion, since it can shrug off Hidden Power Bug from full health, and if Graveler uses Hidden Power Bug that just opens up an easy switch-in opportunity for a large portion of the tier. Hitmonchan resists Rock Slide and can KO Graveler with Sky Uppercut, but it can't risk switching into Earthquake.</p> <p>Relicanth and other Rock-types can switch into Rock Slide and particularly Explosion easily enough, but they must be very wary of Earthquake. If Graveler is locked into Earthquake, then Chimecho, Haunter, Pelipper, and a whole mess of other Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate can switch in for free. Choice Band Diglett can trap and OHKO Graveler with Earthquake after a layer of Spikes but cannot switch into it at all. Finally, there are a lot of Pokemon that can easily fit Hidden Power Grass onto their moveset to eliminate Graveler specifically, such as Murkrow and Plusle, and even weak ones from the likes of Pidgeot will do a massive amount of damage to Graveler.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>This set is the best way to take advantage of Graveler's good bulk and great Attack stat. Rock Slide + Earthquake is amazing STAB coverage in the tier, and they're the main moves that are going to be used most of the time; just be wary of using Earthquake and giving the opponent a free switch to Pelipper, Chimecho, Haunter, or other Ground-immune Pokemon. Double-Edge is a great safety move that doesn't have any recoil thanks to Rock Head and should be used when you're not sure what the opponent will do and has an option for both Earthquake and Rock Slide. Explosion is a good replacement and a great tool to take out the opponent's Water-type or threatening Pokemon like Hitmonchan that Graveler tends to lure in. Hidden Power Bug removes Chimecho and Grass-types from the equation and even 2HKOes defensive Tangela after a layer of Spikes. However, Explosion is also an option here in the last slot to be used alongside Double-Edge if Hidden Power Bug isn't needed, and Explosion is a great tool to take out Tangela and other Grass-types too.</p> <p>44 Speed EVs are used to outpace minimum Speed Kecleon, with the rest pumped into HP and Attack to increase overall bulk and damage output. The Speed EVs can be easily dropped and placed into HP to max out bulk, since outpacing Kecleon isn't that important most of the time, although by doing so you will also typically outrun Sudowoodo, so it really just depends on how you feel about it. Leftovers is an option over Choice Band that increases Graveler's longevity and allows it to switch moves. This is particularly useful when Graveler is being used as the team's primary check to Flying- and Normal-types, which will be running coverage specifically for Graveler and other Rock-types.</p> <p>Toxic is an option on this set, more so with Leftovers than Choice Band, to cripple the bulky Water-types that are likely to switch into Graveler. Toxic is also a good safety move in general, as Poison-types are highly unlikely to switch into Graveler. Graveler should only be chosen over other Rock-types for a team to make use of its secondary Ground typing, which brings an Electric immunity and a powerful STAB Earthquake to the table over the likes of Relicanth and Sudowoodo. Therefore, teammates that are weak to Electric, such as Pidgeot and Huntail, are ideal and both appreciate Graveler's ability to blow through sturdy checks like Mawile and Kecleon.</p> <p>Graveler is exceptionally weak to Grass-, Water-, and Ice-type attacks, being OHKOed by most of them, so unless you can time Explosion well to eliminate these threats as they come in, good defensive teammates are needed so that Graveler can switch out safely. Specially defensive Flareon, Venomoth, and Murkrow are good teammates to switch into Grass-type attacks, while Grass-types like Roselia and Electric-types like Plusle are a good option to remove Water-type attackers. Finally, Hitmonchan can switch into Rock Slide rather easily and KO Graveler in return with Sky Uppercut, making Pokemon like Haunter, Chimecho, and Flying-types valuable teammates as well.</p>"

  "Dewgong": {
    "overview": "<p>Dewgong is a fantastic Water-type in the NU tier and a staple of heavy stall teams thanks to its great bulk, ability to hard counter Huntail, and access to Perish Song. A resistance to Water- and Ice-type attacks and lack of a 4x weakness to Grass are the main advantages Dewgong has over Whiscash and Relicanth, and Dewgong even sports a resistance to Fire as well thanks to Thick Fat. Weaknesses to Rock- and Fighting-type attacks limit Dewgong's effectiveness overall as a defensive threat, particularly physically defensively, meaning its specially defensive set is far more common. Overall, Dewgong is a great choice for defensive teams needing a solid backing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A physically defensive set is certainly doable, particularly since Dewgong's STAB moves completely crush the multitude of Rock-, Ground-, and Steel-types of the tier, all of which are slower than Dewgong as well. However, Dewgong can effectively check these Pokemon using a specially defensive set, and Dewgong still takes too much damage from most Rock- and Fighting-type attacks when using a physically defensive spread.</p> <p>Blizzard is a viable alternative to Ice Beam despite the shoddy accuracy thanks to its incredible damage output when it connects. Body Slam is a decent move to use on the defensive set to spread paralysis, which can make sweeping for slow Pokemon like Octillery much easier. Finally, Safeguard is a great move to protect Dewgong and its team from Toxic and other status, and Dewgong is probably the best user of the move since it outspeeds the other defensive Pokemon of the tier. However, Encore is generally more effective in this regard.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Hitmonchan fears little from Dewgong, outspeeds it, and pulverizes it with STAB Sky Uppercut. Plusle and Haunter have a tougher time switching in, but both do a lot with Thunderbolt, and Plusle can lock Dewgong into a useless move with Encore. Defensively, Kecleon and Lickitung fear almost nothing from Dewgong apart from Toxic. However, if Dewgong is running RestTalk at most they will stall Dewgong down to a stalemate. Calm Mind Chimecho has a very easy time setting up on Dewgong lacking Perish Song.</p> <p>Rock-type attacks in general do a ton to Dewgong; however, the only Rock-type that can effectively take on Dewgong one-on-one is Relicanth thanks to its resistance to Ice Beam and neutrality to Surf. Steel-types like Mawile and Metang also resist Ice Beam and are immune to Toxic, though they need to be careful of Surf. Finally, offensive Grass-types like Bellossom and Tangela can blow through Dewgong with Sleep Powder and Solar Beam, though they do not like Ice Beam.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>This set is one of the best checks to special attackers in the tier, despite its weaknesses to Grass- and Electric-type attacks. With max Special Defense investment, Dewgong is only 4HKOed by Huntail's Hidden Power Electric, giving it an obvious niche in the tier as a check to offensive Water-types. Ice Beam is chosen as the main STAB move, as it prevents Grass-types from switching in easily and gives Dewgong a tool to check Sunny Day Tangela and Bellossom, and STAB Ice Beam is kind of hard to switch into in general. Surf is a good choice for the second slot as a secondary STAB move that has fantastic coverage with Ice Beam, allowing Dewgong to effectively threaten Fire- and Steel-types. Alternatively, Toxic or Perish Song can be chosen instead, the former giving Dewgong a tool to wear down Pokemon that would otherwise be able to wall it endlessly like Kecleon and Lickitung, and the latter making Dewgong one of the best checks to Calm Mind Chimecho in the tier. The last two slots are dedicated to RestTalk, which is the best method for keeping Dewgong around for the whole match and lets it absorb status like Toxic as well.</p> <p>Toxic and Protect can be run together in the last two slots over RestTalk to increase Dewgong's flexibility and allow it to scout for the opponent's movesets. However, the longevity provided by RestTalk is usually far more preferable. Encore can be used in the second moveslot to disrupt an opponent's defensive Pokemon or lock an offensive Pokemon into an ineffective move. More Speed can be run, but Dewgong is already the fastest defensive Pokemon in the tier. Generally, just dropping a couple more EVs in Speed will ensure that the offensive Pokemon using minimum Speed Dewgong as their target won't be able to outspeed it.</p> <p>Most Rock- and Ground-types can't switch into Dewgong safely, but Dewgong still needs a teammate that can switch into Rock-type attacks. Piloswine, Whiscash, and Mawile are all good options to take on the few Rock-type attacks that Dewgong can't ward off on its own. Hitmonchan is a major threat to Dewgong, especially considering it has a high base Special Defense stat, meaning Chimecho, Haunter, and Flying-types are good teammates to help combat it. Physically defensive Chimecho also has an easy enough time with most of the Rock-types that threaten Dewgong.</p> <p>Plusle and strong Grass-type attackers like Sunny Day Bellossom can still run straight through Dewgong despite its massive Special Defense, making a Pokemon like Roselia or Kecleon still a good teammate to have around, but be careful of stacking too many Pokemon on your team susceptible to Hitmonchan and other physical threats like Vigoroth. For this reason, Swalot makes a very effective physically defensive Pokemon to pair with Dewgong, as it can also take on the few special attackers that give Dewgong trouble.</p>"

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Dewgong has an advantage as a special attacker in NU in that it is both very bulky and fast enough to outrun every major defensive Pokemon without any Speed investment. Ice Beam is an incredible STAB move in the tier, blasting apart the Grass-types that would normally give Dewgong trouble and being generally super hard to switch into safely. Surf pairs exceptionally well with Ice Beam and takes out the Rock-, Steel-, and Fire-types that may be able to stomach an Ice Beam. Hidden Power Electric completes the coverage against opposing Water-types, though Hidden Power Grass may be chosen for a better hit on Whiscash and Relicanth.</p> <p>The last slot on this set is almost completely filler, and it depends entirely on what you'd like Dewgong to do for the team when blasting the foe isn't the best option. Encore prevents the opponent from setting up against Dewgong and can lock a defensive Pokemon into a non-damaging move. Toxic can wear down the defensive Pokemon that can comfortably wall Dewgong's attacks, particularly Kecleon and Lickitung. Perish Song ensures that Dewgong can't get run over by a late-game sweeper like Calm Mind Chimecho, and it forces switches against other bulky setup Pokemon like Wailord.</p> <p>Dewgong naturally outpaces every other major defensive Pokemon in the tier, meaning it can devote EVs that would normally be spent on Speed to HP to increase its overall bulk. However, running Speed is still an option, and max Speed ensures that Dewgong can outspeed certain attackers, most notably Flareon, as well as unboosted Pupitar, Tangela, and Huntail. However, even with max Speed Dewgong fails to outrun its most dangerous threats, namely Hitmonchan, Plusle, and Haunter, so in the end investing in bulk will probably be the most helpful.</p> <p>Icy Wind can be used on this set pretty effectively to allow another slower teammate to come in against a switch-in to Dewgong and outspeed it. This is particularly effective for counteracting the opponent's Hitmonchan and Plusle. This set is much harder for something like Hitmonchan to switch into, and Spikes makes this set even more effective, meaning Roselia is a fantastic teammate, particularly as it can provide a secondary check to Grass- and Electric-types. An offensive Pokemon that can switch into Hitmonchan is still recommended, particularly Chimecho and Haunter, as they can keep up offensive momentum. Special walls like Kecleon and Lickitung are of particular concern when using this set, making strong physical attackers like Hitmonchan, Piloswine, and Flareon good teammates. Finally, a teammate that can switch into Plusle and Haunter is needed for this set to work effectively, making dedicated special walls like Kecleon good team choices as well.</p>"

Additionally, Haunter is quite self-sufficient; it can utilize utility moves such as Thief and Toxic to make breaking through foes such as Chimecho and Flareon easier. Haunter can even function as a late-game sweeper, utilizing Endure and a Berry to boost its Speed or Special Attack to become an even greater threat to weakened teams. Furthermore, Haunter is one of two viable Ghost-types in the tier and possesses a great amount of defensive utility; it can spinblock against Hitmonchan, check Normal-types like Pidgeot, and switch into Ground-type attacks from Pokemon like Choice Band Relicanth. Haunter's only real shortcoming is its pitiful bulk, although even then it can take advantage of Choice-locked foes like Hitmonchan and Raticate to switch in and set Substitute.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hypnosis can give Haunter free opportunities to set Substitute, but its shaky accuracy makes it unreliable. Destiny Bond works well on Haunter due to its great Speed and is useful for removing problematic foes that its teammates can't remove themselves. If using Haunter in the lead slot, Taunt lets it disrupt other common leads like Glalie and Venomoth, preventing them from setting Spikes and Substitute. Additionally, Taunt can shut down walls like Lickitung and Roselia.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chimecho: Chimecho can take multiple Thunderbolts from Haunter and easily OHKOes with Psychic in return. Although Haunter can cripple it with moves like Thief and Toxic, Chimecho can potentially have Rest, which helps with its longevity against Haunter.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Normal-types like Kecleon and Lickitung take negligible damage from Haunter's Thunderbolt and can remove poison with Rest and Heal Bell. Vigoroth is similar but can also use Haunter as setup fodder with Bulk Up. Flareon has the bulk to take repeated attacks from Haunter too and can sustain itself with Wish. Although Sableye is pressured by Spikes, it can generally take one Thunderbolt and safely use Recover afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Cacturne: Although not too common due to the competition it faces from Roselia, Cacturne fears little from Haunter outside of Explosion or Toxic and can easily OHKO it with Hidden Power Dark.</p>",

      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Thunderbolt and Psychic are the strongest special attacks Haunter gets and provide it with nearly unresisted coverage, only relevantly missing out on Cacturne. Substitute prevents Haunter from being revenge killed by Pokemon bulky enough to take a hit from it such as Chimecho, Flareon, and Cacturne. Explosion is useful for removing anything in KO range, be it weakened walls like Lickitung or offensive Pokemon like Bellossom. Additionally, Haunter is the fastest Explosion user the tier has, which makes it more reliable as a way to remove faster Pokemon. Thief is helpful for crippling common Haunter switch-ins like Chimecho and Sableye by removing their Leftovers, which makes them much easier to take down with repeated Thunderbolts. Toxic is also usable to cripple similar Pokemon and has great synergy with Substitute. Will-O-Wisp is very effective for crippling Metang and still does a good job of nullifying the Leftovers recovery of Pokemon such as Chimecho, Sableye, and Lickitung. Hidden Power Grass has a narrow scope of targets, but it's very beneficial for teams weak to Pupitar and is Haunter's best move to hit Whiscash with. Finally, Perish Song is a fantastic way to put a stop to Baton Pass chains. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature makes Haunter as strong as possible and lets it outspeed Pokemon like Murkrow and Pikachu. If running Explosion, a Naive nature is preferred to not reduce its damage. Leftovers is ideal to provide Haunter with additional longevity, although if Haunter is running Thief, it should forgo holding an item. Levitate lets Haunter switch into Pokemon such as Relicanth and Hitmonchan that are Choice locked into a Ground-type move and grants it immunity to Spikes.</p> <p>There are few things in ADV NU scarier than a Haunter behind a Substitute; its great Speed and power allow it to 2HKO much of the tier, and the safety Substitute provides it with prevents bulkier attackers from taking a hit and retaliating. Haunter's bulk is terrible, but its defensive typing and ability enable it to switch into attacks such as Choice Band Hitmonchan's Sky Uppercut and Choice Band Metang's Earthquake, granting it a chance to set Substitute and wreak havoc. Haunter very typically draws in Pokemon like Sableye, Chimecho, and Lickitung; Thunderbolt is its best way of dealing damage to such targets, although if you opt for Thief, removing their Leftovers on their first switch in makes them much easier to break later on. While it may be tempting to use Explosion on the latter two and against other targets like Flareon and Kecleon, it should be noted that due to Haunter's low base Attack, it requires a fair bit of chip damage to KO them with Explosion.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Spikes support from Roselia or Glalie is crucial so Haunter can pressure switch-ins like Sableye, Flareon, and Metang more effectively, especially when running Thief. Late-game sweepers such as Bellossom, Huntail, Pupitar, and Calm Mind Chimecho appreciate Haunter's ability to weaken or remove their checks. In particular, Chimecho is helpful because it provides a sturdier Hitmonchan answer. Haunter cannot deal with Normal-type walls like Kecleon, Vigoroth, and Lickitung by itself, so physical wallbreakers like Hitmonchan, Choice Band Metang, and Choice Band Relicanth make good teammates.</p>"

Endure enables Haunter to take a hard hit and activate its Berry. Alternatively, Substitute lets Haunter more reliably activate its Berry and capitalize on forced switches. Hidden Power Fire hits Cacturne and Metang harder than any of Haunter's other moves, although because Haunter must run 30 Speed IVs to use it, it's only recommended alongside Salac Berry. Alternatively, Explosion lets Haunter remove a weakened defensive Pokemon like Lickitung, Chimecho, or Kecleon. Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs with a Timid nature make Haunter as strong and fast as possible. If running Explosion, a Naive nature is preferred to not reduce its damage. Salac Berry makes Haunter the fastest threat in the tier, letting it avoid Speed ties with opposing Haunter and Plusle and outspeed Raticate, and enables it to run Hidden Power Fire much more reliably, although Petaya Berry is an option to boost Haunter's already amazing damage output further. Levitate lets Haunter switch into moves like Earthquake and Hidden Power Ground from Choice Band Hitmonchan and Pidgeot.</p> <p>The key to this set is preserving Haunter for late-game; although it's still a fantastic wallbreaker, the goal should be to use Endure to enable a sweep after the opposing team has been sufficiently weakened. Furthermore, avoid revealing this set's identity; by using Hidden Power Fire, you let your opponent know they aren't at risk of Speed tying with Haunter with a base 95 Speed Pokemon of their own. If it seems unlikely that Haunter will get an opportunity to clean the opposing team, using Explosion against a Pokemon like Chimecho or Flareon may open the door for another teammate.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Although Haunter is capable of pressuring its own checks, other special wallbreakers such as Wailord and Flareon make it easier for Haunter to clean late-game. In return, Haunter can pressure bulky Water-types like opposing Wailord and Dewgong. Spikes from Pokemon like Roselia and Glalie are also useful for weakening Haunter switch-ins like Sableye, Torkoal, and Metang. Between Psychic and Thunderbolt's good damage output, Haunter is still an effective wallbreaker; as a result, other late-game sweepers like Bellossom, Huntail, and Agility Metang are solid teammates.</p>"

Fortunately, there is Onix, which can utilize its decent base 70 Speed to reliably set up Sunny Day and use Explosion to conserve precious sun turns. Onix also possesses key resistances to Flying, Fire, and Poison, which makes it a great teammate for Chlorophyll users such as Bellossom and Tangela, which are predominantly Grass-type. However, using Onix has several downsides, such as the fact that it's fairly one-dimensional. Onix's Special Defense stat is also absolutely abysmal, leaving it susceptible to common special attackers such as Huntail and Chimecho. Lastly, Onix isn't that great because it only fulfills its niche on full sun teams, an archetype that isn't necessarily viable in NU.</p>",

These last two moves are fairly situational, however, as Onix's main purpose is to set up the sun and bring in a teammate.</p> <p>Maximum Speed EVs alongside a Jolly nature and a potential boost from Salac Berry improve Onix's odds of reliably setting up Sunny Day. 144 Attack EVs guarantee the KO with Explosion on Pidgeot, while the remaining 112 EVs go into HP to increase Onix's overall physical bulk so that it can switch into Pidgeot and other Flying-types repeatedly if need be. While Sturdy and Rock Head are both completely useless for Onix, Rock Head could be useful for certain Trace and Skill Swap users such as Porygon and Kecleon, which would suddenly no longer take recoil from Double-Edge. As such, Sturdy is Onix's better ability. Chlorophyll users such as Bellossom, Tangela, and Tropius make great teammates for Onix, as they greatly benefit from the offensive utility it provides. Fire-types such as Flareon can also make use of the sun Onix provides, as it gives a power boost to their STAB attacks. Spikes support from suicide lead Glalie is helpful, not necessarily for Onix but for sun hyper offense teams as a whole.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A lead set utilizing Endure over Block allows Onix to more reliably activate its Salac Berry, nearly guaranteeing that it can use Sunny Day. Be aware that Onix loses to a majority of opposing leads such as Glalie, Hitmonchan, Vigoroth, Magby, and Venomoth. Rock Slide can be used over Earthquake as Onix's attacking option, nailing Flying-types such as Murkrow and Pidgeot without having to sacrifice itself with Explosion prematurely. However, Onix has likely already set up Sunny Day by the time the aforementioned Flying-types have switched in, so it's okay if it sacrifices itself. Rock Slide is also less useful than Earthquake when up against Swalot, which can Rest off the damage more easily and KO Onix with Ice Beam or Hidden Power Ground.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Opposing Chlorophyll users such as Tropius, Tangela, and Bellossom can all wreck Onix with Solar Beam, put it asleep with Sleep Powder, or set up Swords Dance in Tropius's case. Other Grass-types such as Roselia can also make quick work of Onix, although not quite as reliably. Water-types such as Wailord, Dewgong, Kingler, and Whiscash can douse Onix with Surf or Hydro Pump. Pelipper and Huntail are considerably dangerous, as Pelipper is immune to Earthquake and has immense physical bulk, while Huntail is slower than Onix and can set up Rain Dance after Onix uses Sunny Day to countersweep with Surf. Hitmonchan can deal massive damage with Sky Uppercut and pick off a weakened Onix with Mach Punch. However, Hitmonchan still takes a lot from Earthquake and Explosion. Electric-types such as Plusle and Pikachu carry Hidden Power Grass from time to time, nailing Whiscash, Graveler, Pupitar, and, of course, Onix. Even if they opt to run Hidden Power Ice, Onix will be severely crippled due to its pitifully low Special Defense stat.</p>"

  "Kingler": {
    "overview": "<p>Kingler possesses an insane base 130 Attack stat, but like many Pokemon in NU, it can't make use of it with its STAB moves. That said, with access to Double-Edge and a Speed stat that puts it above all of the common defensive Pokemon in the tier to back up its massive Attack, Kingler is still a very dangerous Choice Band attacker and late-game sweeper to look out for. It also has a nice base 115 Defense stat, meaning it doesn't simply fall over to the few priority attacks that exist in the metagame and can pull off an effective defensive set as well. While Kingler seems scary at first glance, its shallow movepool, terrible Special Defense, middling Speed, and poor coverage all attribute to its downfall, and it is ultimately effectively walled by most of the popular walls available in the tier if played around correctly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A straight Swords Dance sweeper is a doable take on Kingler, but the immediate power of Choice Band is typically more appealing, and the fact that Kingler isn't really going to be using much other than Double-Edge means it won't necessarily appreciate the ability to switch moves with a Swords Dance set. Apart from that, there's really not much else to do with Kingler; its movepool is so shallow that there is nothing else to mention, except that Rock Tomb and Mud Shot are \"usable\" on all the above sets but probably not worth it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Switching into Kingler is a daunting task, but Pokemon that resist Normal are a good place to start. Sableye is probably the safest answer to all Kingler variants, as it's immune to Double-Edge and Flail and takes a pittance from Kingler's coverage moves; the only things it has to really worry about are a Swords Dance-boosted Kingler and Toxic from the defensive set. Defensive Relicanth and other Rock- and Steel-types are the next best answers to Kingler, although a multitude of the latter two need to be wary of Hidden Power Ground and Surf. Defensive Tangela is a pretty surefire check to any Kingler set; it just needs to watch out for Blizzard and the rare Hidden Power Bug.</p> <p>Kingler isn't exactly bulky, so taking it out offensively and revenge killing it is a pretty easy task if you lack a good defensive answer to it. Plusle and Haunter easily OHKO any Kingler set with Thunderbolt. Offensive Grass- and Water-types will also easily OHKO with Hidden Power Electric or Hidden Power Grass. The main thing to keep in mind when checking Kingler offensively is to not be baited into activating its Salac Berry and then staring down the barrel of a full-powered Flail sweep.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Kingler's Choice Band-boosted Double-Edge easily OHKOes dangerous attackers like Hitmonchan and offensive Chimecho and cleanly 2HKOes bulky walls like Kecleon, physically defensive Lickitung, physically defensive Whiscash, and Dewgong after a layer of Spikes. Hidden Power Ghost ensures that Kingler isn't completely walled by Ghost-types, particularly Haunter and Shedinja, though Hidden Power Ground can be chosen instead, as it gets the same hit on Sableye while giving Kingler a much better tool for Swalot, Mawile, and Relicanth than Kingler's other moves.</p> <p>Kingler's viable physical movepool stops there, though there are other Hidden Power types worth considering. Hidden Power Rock has pretty good coverage with Double-Edge and rips apart Dewgong, Pelipper, and Golbat. Hidden Power Bug gives Kingler a reliable hit on Tangela and is a stronger option for Bellossom and Chimecho.</p> <p>The last two slots have to go to special moves in order to fill Kingler's moveset. As it happens, Surf isn't an absolutely terrible move to get locked into. Kingler's Special Attack is just high enough to make it the better option for taking out a few Rock-types, particularly Graveler, as well as Magcargo, Lairon, Sudowoodo, and Pupitar if not running Hidden Power Ground. Blizzard is Kingler's best attack for Tangela, but it doesn't have much use outside of that. The last slot can also go to Flail, but it's probably more situational than Blizzard is considering how difficult it is to use it effectively.</p> <p>A Naughty nature is used so as to not lower the power of Surf and Blizzard while giving Kingler as much power behind its physical attacks as possible. A Naive nature can be used to outrun positive-natured base 65 Speed Pokemon, particularly maximum Speed Flareon and Adamant Hitmonchan, the latter of which would make it worth it, though maximum Speed base 65 Speed Pokemon are rare. Kingler does get access to Mud Shot and Rock Tomb as alternative physical move options, which can allow Kingler to use a different Hidden Power type like Ghost more comfortably, but they're so weak that it really isn't worth getting locked into either one of them in the long run.</p> <p>Choice Band Kingler should be used primarily as a wallbreaker for another physical attacker to sweep late-game, or as part of a physical onslaught core with the goal of overwhelming the opposing team with multiple Choice Band attackers. Kingler makes for a good fit for the latter with its access to Surf and Blizzard, which can be used to remove a wall that resists Normal, such as Graveler, which would otherwise be pesky for other typical members of the team, like Murkrow, Pidgeot, and Raticate, to break through.</p> <p>Kingler is easily revenge killed by fast special attackers like Plusle and Haunter, so packing a special wall or tank is highly recommended when using Kingler, with Flareon and Sableye among the best choices for teammates. Lickitung and Kecleon are also solid choices, with Kecleon also making for a good choice for physical onslaught teams if using a Choice Band set. Having a teammate to take on defensive Tangela and Bellossom is also recommended, as they can tank an attack or two from Kingler and OHKO it in return with their Grass-type STAB moves. Murkrow stands out as a great offensive partner to switch into them, while Flareon is a great defensive choice.</p>"
      },
      "Flail": {
        "description": "<p>A 200-Base Power Flail coming off of Kingler's base 130 Attack stat straight-up OHKOes pretty much every offensive Pokemon in the tier, and after a Swords Dance boost, it OHKOes everything save for Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types. Here are some calculations to highlight the sheer power of Kingler's Flail against a selection of common Pokemon in the tier:</p> <ul> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 4/0 Hitmonchan: 120.2 - 141.7%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 4/0 Bellossom: 93.8 - 110.6%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 4/0 Huntail: 91.2 - 107.5%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 4/0 Pidgeot: 98.3 - 115.9%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 252/0 Flareon: 108.3 - 127.5%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 4/0 Vigoroth: 95.3 - 112.2%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 0/252+ Wailord: 56.5 - 66.7%</li> <li>+2 200 Base Power Flail vs 0/252+ Wailord: 113 - 133.2%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Lickitung: 53.9 - 63.5%</li> <li>+2 200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Lickitung: 107.5 - 126.5%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Swalot: 48 - 56.6%</li> <li>+2 200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Swalot: 95.7 - 112.8%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Mawile: 31.5 - 37.1%</li> <li>+2 200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Mawile: 62.8 - 74%</li> </ul> <p>Hidden Power Ghost has the best two-move coverage with Flail, ensuring that Haunter and Shedinja don't just completely wall Kingler. However, Hidden Power Ground is an option, as it gives Kingler a move to 2HKO maximum Defense Mawile without a Swords Dance boost, and OHKO it with a boost. Hidden Power Ground is also Kingler's best hope against defensive Relicanth, but it still manages to 2HKO maximum Defense Relicanth at +2. If you don't think that Kingler will be able to find the time to boost with Swords Dance, Surf is a decent option in its place, as it is Kingler's best option for Graveler, Pupitar, Magcargo, and Sudowoodo, OHKOing the former three and cleanly 2HKOing 252 HP versions of the latter.</p> <p>Kingler makes for an amazing late-game sweeper with this set if you can bait something like Plusle or Haunter into attacking Kingler, use Endure as they use Thunderbolt, obtain the Salac Berry's Speed boost and a full-powered Flail, and proceed to just mangle everything left on the opponent's team. Be wary of both of these Pokemon and other similar frail attackers like them using Substitute before attacking Kingler. If you aren't confident in your baiting skills, Substitute is a much safer option to bring Kingler down to 1 HP to begin the sweep; just be sure to keep Spikes off the field so that it will work correctly.</p> <p>There really aren't any other options to consider in regards to EVs or nature; however, a positive Speed nature is worth considering in order to allow Kingler to outpace Adamant Hitmonchan before attempting to boost. Considering Hitmonchan is one of the few Pokemon with access to priority in the tier, removing it when possible is desirable when using this set. That said, without a positive Attack nature, many of the KOs and 2HKOs listed above, and many more not listed, are just missed out on.</p> <p>If using Substitute, Kingler should have 8 HP EVs to try make it easier to bring it down to low health manually; however, the prevalence of Spikes in the tier makes it incredibly hard to bring Kingler down to 1 HP correctly. Substitute does come with the benefit of blocking status and protecting Kingler from priority if done correctly, but it also requires Kingler to get in on a foe it outspeeds, which is not always possible. Both Endure and Substitute have a major risk factor attached to them, but Endure is generally the better choice for the most situations in this tier.</p> <p>This set can only 2HKO most defensive threats without a Swords Dance boost, and even many offensive Pokemon with some HP investment avoid the OHKO, increasing the importance of making this set a late-game sweeper once most Pokemon on the opposing side have been weakened, and preferably with a layer or two of Spikes set up to push a few of those aforementioned calculations into guaranteed KOs. Tangela, Rock-types, and Steel-types are particularly important to remove or weaken before bringing out Kingler and attempting a sweep. Diglett is a good Pokemon to consider to use with Kingler to remove, or at least heavily weaken, the latter two obstacles. Murkrow and Flareon are both good options to consider to take on Tangela and defensive Bellossom.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>This set is a more defensive take on Kingler, making use of its good physical bulk to act as a pivot and disrupter for more balanced teams that need a good check to physical attackers like Hitmonchan while retaining a good amount of offensive momentum. Body Slam is the main attack due to its paralysis chance, and with the given EVs, it'll almost always 2HKO 4/0 Hitmonchan and Pidgeot. Knock Off is actually surprisingly good in the NU tier due to the prevalence of Spikes, and without their Leftovers, defensive Pokemon like Lickitung and Sableye become much more exposed to various 2HKOs they otherwise just barely avoid. Toxic conflicts with Body Slam a bit, but it is a great tool when combined with Knock Off to quickly wear out the likes of Sableye and other defensive Pokemon likely to switch into Kingler, like non-RestTalk Relicanth and Tangela. The last slot is largely filler, but Surf prevents Rock-types like Graveler and Pupitar from switching freely into this set, even when Kingler's using an Adamant nature. Hidden Power Ground is a good alternative if a weak Surf is undesirable, and it is Kingler's best weapon against Mawile.</p> <p>Maximum HP investment increases Kingler's overall bulk substantially due to its low base HP stat. 72 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Modest Huntail before it sets up rain, and the remaining EVs are placed into Attack to beef up Body Slam to allow Kingler to better threaten targets like Chimecho, Kecleon, and Hitmonchan. No Defense or Special Defense EVs are needed, as the investment in HP increases Kingler's bulk enough, and further defensive investment leaves Kingler outclassed by Wailord and Whiscash.</p> <p>A main goal of this set is to spread paralysis with Body Slam and generally weaken the opponent's team to allow another teammate to come in later in the match and clean up. This means that slower, but stronger sweepers that love having the opposing team paralyzed make for the best teammates, which include special Flareon, Choice Band Piloswine, and Swords Dance Tropius.</p> <p>Plusle and Haunter easily KO this set with Thunderbolt, and Haunter is usually immune to three out of the four attacks, making special walls like Kecleon and Lickitung particularly good teammates to use with this set. Kecleon is also a good check to offensive Huntail, which can otherwise set up on Kingler and KO it quite easily, although it faces the risk of getting paralyzed by Body Slam. Most Grass-types dislike getting paralyzed or poisoned by this set, but they will OHKO Kingler quite easily, making Flareon and Murkrow good teammates to use with Kingler too. Finally, Mawile makes for a particularly good defensive partner to this set, and together with a special wall like Kecleon, it can form a solid defensive core to take on a majority of the tier quite effectively.</p>"

  "Voltorb": {
    "overview": "<p>Voltorb carves a niche for itself by being the absolute fastest Pokemon in the tier with its blazing base 100 Speed, and a plethora of utility options such as Rain Dance, Light Screen, Taunt, and Explosion to differentiate it from other fast Electric-types such as Pikachu and Plusle. However, because rain hyper offense is an uncommon team archetype, the utility Voltorb brings to the table generally isn't worth it. Outside of dedicated rain teams, Voltorb suffers from being outclassed by the aforementioned Electric-types due to its extreme frailty and relative lack of power.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Leftovers promotes Voltorb's longevity, but longevity isn't necessary for a suicide lead such as Voltorb, and Silk Scarf is important to boost its Explosion. Magnet is another, more offensive item option that boosts Voltorb's Thunder. Again, though, Voltorb's primary purpose is setting up Rain Dance and getting off the field, and it would miss the power boost to Explosion greatly. Hidden Power Grass nails Whiscash but doesn't really hit much else. Lead Whiscash is also extremely uncommon, and even if Whiscash tries to switch into Voltorb, Voltorb can just use Explosion the following turn. Thunderbolt has a more reliable accuracy than Thunder outside of rain, but because Voltorb's primary function is to set up rain, Thunder is more often than not a better option. Thunder Wave is another utility option that generates free turns for Voltorb's teammates similarly to its Static ability. However, Voltorb usually doesn't have room in its moveslot to use it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Because Voltorb is faster than every other Pokemon in the tier and is bulky enough to take the strongest priority move in the metagame (an Adamant Choice Band-boosted STAB Mach Punch from Hitmonchan), it is absolutely guaranteed to set up Rain Dance when used in the lead position and by extension has no true counters. However, Voltorb telegraphs strongly that the opponent is facing full rain offense, which in itself is a weakness to using Voltorb, as the element of surprise is completely lost. Ghost-types such as Haunter and Sableye can even immediately switch into Voltorb turn 2 to absorb its Explosion. Furthermore, several Pokemon can check the team archetype of full rain. Opposing Huntail may win the Speed tie and countersweep Voltorb's team, RestTalk Dewgong checks Huntail and Seaking, Bellossom can eat an Ice Beam in a pinch and countersweep with Sunny Day, and Tangela sets up on Relicanth and similarly countersweeps with Sunny Day.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Suicide Rain Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Thunder is Voltorb's strongest STAB attack and makes use of Rain Dance to ensure its perfect accuracy and nails opposing Water- and Flying-types such as Dewgong and Pidgeot. Light Screen is yet another utility move in Voltorb's arsenal that improves the matchup against certain opposing leads such as Glalie and Magby. Taunt stops common opposing leads such as Glalie and Venomoth from using Spikes and Sleep Powder, respectively. Explosion allows Voltorb to conserve precious turns of rain so a Swift Swim teammate such as Huntail can attempt to sweep.</p> <p>Maximum Speed EVs allow Voltorb to outspeed the entire metagame, while maximum Attack EVs enable the strongest Explosion possible. Because Voltorb also has Thunder and acts as a suicide lead, running a Naive nature is more optimal than running a Jolly one. Static is fairly situational, but it is infinitely more useful than Soundproof and can potentially paralyze an opposing lead to potentially generate free turns once a Swift Swim user such as Huntail comes in. Silk Scarf increases the power of Voltorb's Explosion, severely denting opposing leads such as Glalie and Hitmonchan. Offensive Pokemon that have access to Swift Swim such as Huntail, Relicanth, and Seaking are mandatory teammates for Voltorb, as they need rain being up to function and sweep. While opposing Sunny Day users such as Bellossom and Tangela are extremely threatening for rain teams and can easily survive Voltorb's Explosion, Voltorb can use Taunt to prevent them from setting up Sunny Day and countersweeping the turn it uses Explosion.</p>"

  "Lickitung": {
    "overview": "<p>Lickitung is a good defensive Pokemon in the tier thanks to its acceptable mixed defenses, its great defensive typing, and, most importantly, its access to two invaluable cleric options in Wish and Heal Bell. It can easily utilize both physically and specially defensive sets, depending on your team's needs, although it has a tougher time going mixed, as its bulk is just not quite there to allow for it. Unfortunately for Lickitung, it is yet another defensive Pokemon in NU that's weak to Hitmonchan, decreasing its effectiveness slightly as a physically defensive Pokemon. Despite that, Lickitung is a Pokemon to strongly consider on defensive teams looking for role compression.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Lickitung's movepool is huge; it just lacks the stats to really make use of most moves. Lickitung is one of the few Pokemon with access to Swords Dance in the tier, and it can use its bulk to find the time to gather boosts. Curse just usually proves itself more effective due to Lickitung's already low Speed, and the Defense boosts it gives let Lickitung out-tank much of the tier. However, Curse is illegal with Wish. Belly Drum is another way to take Lickitung on the offensive, and thanks to its good bulk, it has a chance to boost on a weak attacker without the need of setting up a Substitute for protection, but again, its low Speed and lack of priority can make it hard to use effectively. Substitute + Focus Punch can be used as an effective stallbreaker and lure against the Pokemon that will usually switch into Lickitung, such as Mawile.</p> <p>Lickitung is probably one of the best users of Counter in the tier, as it isn't OHKOed by almost anything in the tier, letting it take out select threats for your team in a similar way to Explosion lures like Sudowoodo. Psych Up is an option to copy the boosts of dangerous setup sweepers like Calm Mind Sableye and outstall them. A specially offensive set can be super tricky for your opponent to play around, as Lickitung's special movepool features very dangerous options across the board, including Ice Beam, Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Grass, and Surf. The only major thing holding this kind of set back is Lickitung's pitifully low Special Attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Hitmonchan is the best all-around answer to Lickitung, as it can OHKO even fully physically defensive sets with its Choice Band-boosted Sky Uppercut. Haunter is typically immune to everything that Lickitung can throw at it and will eventually run Lickitung out of Wish PP. Steel-types, such as Mawile, Lairon, and Metang, are the next most reliable answers to Lickitung, as they are immune to Toxic and take little damage from Lickitung's STAB attacks and typical coverage options. However, most are not strong enough to threaten Lickitung with a 2HKO, allowing it to heal up with Wish and safely switch to a teammate. Strong Choice Band users like Piloswine and Pidgeot will be able to 2HKO even fully physically defensive Lickitung, although Lickitung has a chance to Wish stall Pidgeot out of health if it uses Double-Edge. Finally, RestTalk users with Toxic like Relicanth can outstall Lickitung in the long run if played right.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>The most important thing to note about this set is that the playstyle and set remain the same whether you choose to go physically or specially defensive; Lickitung just ends up walling different Pokemon depending on whichever you choose. Specially defensive is the most common choice and arguably a better way to use Lickitung due to the fact that it has no special weaknesses, and physical walls are far easier to come by in the tier. With a specially defensive spread, Lickitung is one of the few Pokemon that can avoid a 2HKO from Huntail's Surf in the rain, allowing it to stall out rain turns and paralyze or poison Huntail in return. Wish and Protect provide Lickitung with reliable recovery, and it is one of the few Pokemon in the tier with access to Wish, giving it a major leg-up on its main competition in Kecleon.</p> <p>Lickitung's main niche in the tier is that it is able to run both Wish and Heal Bell on one set, allowing it to function as a kind of one-stop-shop for stall teams looking to compress roles in one team slot. Heal Bell is pretty invaluable for stall teams in NU, as a lot of stallbreakers rely on Toxic to break through some of the main defensive Pokemon in the tier, most notably Sableye and Flareon, but also other defensive Pokemon like Relicanth and Tropius. Alternatively, and also somewhat ironically, Toxic is probably the best way Lickitung is going to spread damage on the opponent's team and allows it to outstall Pokemon like Flareon with the combination of Wish and Protect. So, if you have Heal Bell covered elsewhere on your team, likely by Chimecho, Toxic is typically going to be the best choice for the third slot. Seismic Toss is the main option in the last slot to spread consistent damage on the opponent's team due to Lickitung's abysmal attacking stats and allow it to prevent Pokemon from using it as complete setup bait, particularly Substitute users. Alternatively, Body Slam can be used, since it still does a decent amount of damage to frailer special attackers like Plusle and can paralyze foes if that's desired for your team.</p> <p>If you already have a special wall on your team, Lickitung can play around with its defensive EVs to better suit your team's needs. A fully physically defensive spread can be used by moving the Special Defense EVs to Defense and changing the nature to Impish. With a physically defensive spread, Lickitung can actually outstall a lot of the physical attackers in the tier not named Hitmonchan, notably Choice Band Sudowoodo (avoiding Focus Punch and Explosion), Kingler, Flareon, and Murkrow. Lickitung can also run a more balanced EV spread of 252 HP / 88 Def / 168 SpD with a Careful nature, which can allow it to take on a broad range of unboosted threats in the tier. With that spread, Lickitung has just enough physical bulk to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Murkrow's Drill Peck and enough Special Defense to avoid the 2HKO from Bellossom's Solar Beam.</p> <p>Lickitung's movepool is absolutely gigantic, so there's lots of room to play around with its last two slots; feel free to fill them in with whatever best suits your team. One thing to note is that Lickitung's Special Attack is actually higher than its Attack, so its special movepool options aren't out of the question. The most prominent alternative is Shadow Ball, which allows Lickitung to actually touch Haunter, something it can't do with the given set. Knock Off can be used somewhere on the set to help its team win stall wars, as Pokemon like Sableye become significantly easier to 2HKO without their Leftovers recovery, and Choice Band threats like Hitmonchan are significantly easier to wall without their item. As for special attacking options, Ice Beam, Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, and Hidden Power Grass all have their uses and allow Lickitung to better combat certain threats like Tangela, Huntail, and Pupitar should your team need it.</p> <p>Regardless of the EV spread chosen for this set, Hitmonchan remains a major threat, as it can easily OHKO Lickitung with Sky Uppercut, even if Lickitung is running a fully physically defensive spread. Chimecho, Haunter, Swalot, or Pelipper is a required teammate if using Lickitung to assuage this issue. Physically defensive Pokemon like Pelipper and Relicanth love Lickitung as a teammate, as Lickitung can wall nearly every Electric-, Grass-, and Water-type attacker in the tier effectively, giving them a solid backbone to fall back on and pivot around, and Lickitung can pass them Wishes because they lack solid recovery of their own. Unfortunately for Lickitung, Rain Dance Huntail can 2HKO it with Hydro Pump, even with a fully specially defensive EV spread, but Lickitung can effectively stall it out if it hits Huntail with Toxic as it uses Rain Dance and continues to cycle with Wish and Protect. This should be a last resort strategy for dealing with Huntail when using a stall team, however, so a primary answer is needed, making specially defensive Bellossom a desired teammate.</p> <p>If using a physically defensive spread, a specially defensive teammate like Swalot or Whiscash is recommended; Swalot in particular can still wall Hitmonchan effectively if it's running a specially defensive EV spread. Spikes support makes this set much more effective, as Lickitung can force out a lot of Pokemon and, combined with Toxic, really build up passive damage. Roselia is the best in this regard, as it resists Fighting unlike Cacturne and Glalie, and it is the best fit for the kinds of stall teams you would be using Lickitung on.</p>"

Offensively, Tangela and Bellossom can be considered rivals somewhat; while Tangela boasts slightly higher Speed and power and much better physical bulk to make end-game sweeping easier, Bellossom has much, much better special bulk to take better advantage of its typing against major metagame threats like Huntail and is therefore easier to fit on teams. Defensively, Tangela has few rivals when it comes to physical bulk; it's almost unmatched in its ability to wall Rock-types (outside of not resisting Explosion), and it easily checks the likes of other huge physical threats like Hitmonchan and Raticate. Regardless of whether Tangela is running an offensive or defensive set, Sleep Powder will be its ace in the hole, crippling many Pokemon in the tier. All in all, Tangela holds a very secure spot as one of the top Pokemon in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tangela has access to Growth, which on paper sounds awesome on the Sunny Day sweeper set, but it only gives +1 to Special Attack and it won't do anything to help Tangela get past its main counters in Swalot, Flareon, and Kecleon. A more effective set that was not included above is a SubSeed set, which Tangela can actually pull off pretty effectively with its decent Speed stat and high Defense, made even better with its low HP stat. However, defensive Tangela will tend to get more mileage out of spreading status, and a SubSeed set is even more walled by Roselia than just the defensive set.</p> <p>More gimmicky options include a RestTalk set, which can make Tangela very hard for opposing defensive teams to take on, but Tangela has massive four-moveslot syndrome as it is; making room for both Rest and Sleep Talk will leave Tangela completely walled by a huge number of Pokemon while not walling much more than it otherwise would in return. Tangela's Attack is pretty terrible, but it does get Endure and Flail, which can surprise a couple of its common specially defensive counters while it cannot be walled by Rock-types in return thanks to its Grass STAB. Finally, Psych Up can allow Tangela to get the jump on a Calm Mind-boosted Chimecho or Sableye, but it doesn't have much use outside of that.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Swalot, especially specially defensive RestTalk variants, is the most surefire counter to any set Tangela may be running, as it's not even 4HKOed by anything Tangela can throw at it apart from Hidden Power Psychic (which is never seen), and it isn't fazed by any status Tangela can inflict, even passively harming Tangela throwing out Giga Drain and Leech Seed with its ability Liquid Ooze. Next in line are Fire-types, particularly Flareon and Torkoal, which accomplish pretty much the same as Swalot minus packing Liquid Ooze but gaining power to their STAB moves under Sunny Day. Venomoth and Roselia are practically immune to Tangela's Grass-type STAB attacks and can put the hurt on Tangela with Hidden Power Fire, but they will take a lot of damage from Tangela's own Hidden Power Fire in return.</p> <p>Pidgeot and Murkrow resist Tangela's Grass-type attacks, and Murkrow is even immune to Sleep Powder, but they need to be healthy to effectively take on Tangela under the sun, as Solar Beam will still be doing a ton of damage to both. Haunter is even frailer than those Flying-types but still resists Grass and will cleanly OHKO Tangela in return, which neither Flying-type can cleanly accomplish, though Murkrow almost always will with Drill Peck if Tangela is running 0 HP EVs. Finally, Glalie doesn't resist Solar Beam and will take a ton of damage from Hidden Power Fire, but it will easily OHKO Tangela in return with Ice Beam.</p>",

      "Sunny Day Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>This set is best brought out in the end-game, when most of the opponent's specially defensive Pokemon have been worn down and most users of Ice- and Fire-type attacks have been removed. Sleep Powder is what makes this set as dangerous as it is, completely invalidating a Pokemon late in the game and opening up an opportunity for Tangela to set up Sunny Day. From there, Solar Beam will hit like a wrecking ball, with Hidden Power Fire complementing it almost perfectly. It should be mentioned that Morning Sun is a viable option in the second moveslot to make the most of Tangela's bulk and sustain its sweep, especially if you already have a sleep inducer elsewhere on your team.</p> <p>There are many different viable EV spreads to consider when using Tangela. Maximum Speed with a Timid nature is recommended, as the base 50 and base 60 Speed tiers are heavily contested, and winning the Speed tie outside of sun could be game-changing. With maximum Speed and a Modest nature, Tangela will outrun Timid Bellossom by one point, allowing Tangela to keep its power level while giving it the possibility to beat Bellossom one-on-one if the latter is partially damaged beforehand. However, with a Modest nature, Tangela is left outsped by Jolly Pupitar by two points and will be outsped by other dangerous neutral-nature base 65 Speed Pokemon like Flareon and Chimecho. Therefore, Timid is the preferred nature, giving Tangela the ability to outspeed these threats as well as Pokemon with base 70 Speed and a neutral nature like Castform, along with giving Tangela the best possible chance of beating other Tangela under the sun. A bulkier spread is also efficient and pairs best with Morning Sun. Just 24 Speed EVs are needed with a Modest nature to outpace the entire unboosted tier under the sun; the remaining EVs should be put into HP to give Tangela some bulk to ease setup. It's important to keep in mind, though, that Tangela will have almost no chance of beating Flareon regardless of EV spread outside of crippling it with Sleep Powder, and Tangela can only hope to beat Bellossom that have taken upwards of 25% damage; Tangela will otherwise fail to KO with Hidden Power Fire under the sun and Bellossom will always have a guaranteed OHKO back.</p> <p>There's very little that can stand in Tangela's path once the sun is up, but there are a few immediate threats that must be taken care of before successfully sweeping with Tangela, most notably including Flareon and Torkoal. Both avoid even a 4HKO from Tangela's attacks and easily OHKO in return with Flamethrower, meaning even if they are hit by Sleep Powder at full health, Tangela has almost no chance of KOing them before they wake up. These two make Diglett a very valuable teammate to employ to ensure they are removed before attempting to sweep with Tangela, but Diglett can be pretty hard to use. Other choices include Rock-types like Sudowoodo, Water-types like Dewgong, and other Pokemon to lure them in and cripple them with Toxic. Specially defensive Swalot completely walls this set, it too avoiding a 4HKO from any of Tangela's moves and easily KOing back with either Sludge Bomb or Ice Beam. Diglett again comes in handy here for taking it out, while other Ground-types like Graveler or a Psychic-type like Chimecho can be used to try to knock it out before bringing out Tangela. Finally, specially defensive Kecleon and Lickitung are only 3HKOed by Tangela's attacks, making a physically inclined partner like Hitmonchan a valuable teammate to take them out ahead of time.</p> <p>Spikes support will ensure that Tangela will come out on top against a myriad of other Pokemon in the tier, including Hitmonchan, Bellossom, and Venomoth, ensuring an OHKO on the latter after a layer of Spikes and getting super close after two layers on the former two. Other Pokemon that need to be weakened before bringing out Tangela include Haunter, Chimecho, Murkrow, and Pidgeot, all of which can tank any one of Tangela's moves and all of which but Pidgeot can OHKO back after a layer of Spikes.</p>"
      },
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>65/115 physical bulk is amazing on a Pokemon that resists Earthquake in the NU tier, and Tangela puts that bulk to use with this set. Between Giga Drain and Leech Seed, Tangela will usually be getting enough health back to not warrant the use of Morning Sun, but the instant recovery is useful in certain situations. Double status is a good strategy to use with Tangela in order to cripple as much of the opponent's team as possible. Stun Spore is best used if your team needs Tangela to be able to cripple offensive Pokemon like Arbok, Vigoroth, and Murkrow. Toxic is better on teams with multiple RestTalk or Protect users to stall for Toxic damage and better allow Tangela to help the team come out on top against stall cores of Sableye, Flareon, and Dewgong.</p> <p>Giga Drain is the recommended STAB move thanks to its passive healing; however, its PP is really low, meaning Hidden Power Grass is a good alternative that has a bonus of being slightly stronger. Leech Seed is the main option in the last slot to increase Tangela's overall longevity and spread more residual damage around the opposite team. Toxic can be used here as well, which makes Tangela much less susceptible to Grass-types save for Roselia.</p> <p>There's not much point to running Special Defense EVs, as Bellossom just does a specially defensive set a million times better. Some Speed can be run to allow Tangela to hit some other defensive Pokemon with Sleep Powder before they can status Tangela in return, though Tangela typically wants maximum Defense to tank attacks from the likes of Hitmonchan better. Hidden Power Fire can be used in the last slot with Giga Drain to ward off Grass-, Bug-, and Steel-types looking for an easy switch into Tangela. Tangela also has access to Reflect, which can make it nigh impregnable physically and possibly allow Tangela to turn the tides against a Flying-type switch-in such as Murkrow. Hidden Power Ice is a good offensive option if going this route to turn Tangela into a lure to open a sweep for something weak to Flying-types such as Hitmonchan. Finally, Protect is a decent option to include somewhere on this set to allow Tangela to scout the opponent's attacks, rack up passive damage, and stall for more Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery.</p> <p>Swalot completely mangles this set thanks to its huge Special Defense, resistance to Grass, and ability in Liquid Ooze, which turns Leech Seed into a hindrance for Tangela and its teammates. This makes Ground-types like Piloswine good teammates to have to switch into Swalot and other Poison-types to threaten them out with a STAB Earthquake. Chimecho is also a good teammate to have for this reason, and it also helps immensely with combating opposing Roselia, which can otherwise switch into this set without fear and shrug off any status with Natural Cure.</p> <p>In general, defensive Tangela should be used as part of a defensive core and thus needs a specially defensive teammate to work effectively for the team. Kecleon, Flareon, and Dewgong make great teammates to accomplish this and pair well with Tangela typing-wise. Dewgong is particularly effective for taking on Fire-types and can tank attacks from the common Flying-types as well if need be. Having Spikes support will increase the effectiveness of the passive damage Tangela will spread around the opposing team with Toxic and Leech Seed, and all of its moves tend to cause switches, which will rack up damage. Finally, because Tangela almost completely walls most Ground- and Rock-types, having a late-game sweeper that can take advantage of their absence is best to have along, with examples including Plusle, Pidgeot, and Raticate.</p>"

  "Seadra": {
    "overview": "<p>Seadra sports great Speed and Special Attack stats for a Water-type in NU, and it doesn't need rain support to be an immediate threat. It's very one-dimensional, but a decent choice for high offense teams. Most other Water-types in the tier are too weak, too slow, or need setup to be useful, and Seadra is just good right off the bat. However, it's relatively easy to wall and has no way of breaking its usual counters, as it doesn't have a way of boosting its attacks outside of Rain Dance, which doesn't give it a Speed boost, unlike its main competition in Huntail. All in all, Seadra is a great choice, just make sure Huntail isn't a better choice for your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There really isn't much more for Seadra to do, as its movepool is pretty barren. Rain Dance is an option to boost its STAB attacks and form a dual-sweeping core with Huntail. Blizzard offers more power than Ice Beam and can make Bellossom a more risky switch-in to Seadra, but the accuracy just kills it as a reliable option. Finally, Hidden Power Dark gives Seadra a super effective hit on Chimecho.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Specially defensive Bellossom is probably the best answer to Seadra available, as it can withstand an Ice Beam or two and proceed to OHKO Seadra back with any of its STAB moves. Dewgong is the next best answer, as it is avoids the 3HKO from Hidden Power and can proceed to 2HKO back if it's carrying its own Hidden Power or 3HKO with Surf or Ice Beam. Specially defensive Lickitung, Swalot, and Kecleon are the next best answers, as they are not threatened by a 2HKO from any of Seadra's moves and can proceed to stall it out. Finally, Seadra is relatively easily revenge killed by most Pokemon with neutral or super effective special attacks. Plusle and Haunter both outspeed Seadra and OHKO with Thunderbolt. Roselia can tank an Ice Beam and OHKO with Giga Drain. Maximum Special Attack Chimecho can easily OHKO with Hidden Power Electric and tank a Hydro Pump.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set is a good choice for hyper offense teams that can continually pummel the opponent without the need for setup. While Huntail is more powerful and faster in rain, Seadra does not need to rely on rain being active in order to outspeed a huge portion of the metagame and blast foes with its STAB move, making it a bit more reliable in that regard. The choice between Hydro Pump and Surf is the age-old story of power vs accuracy. Hydro Pump is generally preferred due to the chance to break through defensive stalwarts like Swalot and Lickitung; however, the tier is pretty specially frail on the whole, making Surf a decent option.</p> <p>Ice Beam and either Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Electric give Seadra almost perfect neutral coverage on the tier, which Seadra is thankful for because it really does not have a movepool outside of that, making the last slot somewhat of a filler option. Substitute is nice to protect Seadra from being revenge killed by the likes of Plusle and Haunter, and it can be used with a Petaya or Salac Berry to give Seadra an extra boost to possibly sweep the opposing team. Toxic is a great way to cripple the special walls that can tank its attacks well, particularly Kecleon and Bellossom. Finally, Agility can turn the tables on the opponent late-game and let Seadra outrun even Huntail in the rain.</p> <p>A Timid nature is needed to let Seadra outspeed Glalie and the rare Fire-types that sit near its Speed tier, like Charmeleon and Magby. Modest is still a choice though if you're looking for straight power and is recommended if you're using Hydro Pump. Speaking of power, Mystic Water can be used to give Seadra's Water-type STAB move a bit more bite and ensures a 2HKO on physically defensive Swalot with Hydro Pump and 2HKO on Choice Band Hitmonchan with Surf. Hidden Power Grass can be used over Hidden Power Electric to nail Whiscash, but Electric is generally better, as it provides better neutral coverage and has a more desirable super effective hit on Pelipper.</p> <p>Spikes is central to hyper offense teams, making Roselia, Glalie, and Cacturne required teammates, with Roselia in particular sporting great type synergy with Seadra. Bellossom is a huge threat to this set, as it is tanky enough to withstand Ice Beam and easily OHKOes Seadra with any of its STAB moves. Flying-types like Murkrow and Fire-types like Flareon are thus good offensive teammates to pair with Seadra, as they can take advantage of Bellossom and OHKO it, and in Flareon's case, enjoy a nice Sunny Day boost as well should Bellossom choose to set up. Plusle and Haunter are the main revenge killers to watch out for when using this set, making a special tank a recommended teammate; Chimecho is a good team choice, as it can continue to pressure the opponent with offensive Calm Mind sets. Finally, Hitmonchan is a great offensive partner to blow through a few of the special walls that stand in Seadra's way, while Seadra soaks the physical walls that give Hitmonchan some trouble.</p>"

  "Flareon": {
    "overview": "<p>Flareon's one of NU's best wallbreakers thanks to its combination of raw strength, good versatility, and useful defensive traits. It can run a mixed set with a very potent Double-Edge to lure in and chunk bulky Water-types and Quick Attack to pick off weakened foes like Pikachu and Huntail. Alternatively, it can go specially offensive to amp up its Fire Blast's damage and give it better odds against Sudowoodo, Relicanth, and Whiscash with Hidden Power Grass or Pelipper with Hidden Power Electric. Flareon's coverage is superb regardless of which set it uses, and teams usually must rely on smart pivoting around its attacks to prevent it from wreaking havoc. Flareon's also hard to revenge kill because most faster attackers can't reliably KO it without significant chip damage. Its defensive prowess also lets it check foes such as Haunter, Bellossom, and Torkoal. The most noticeable downside to Flareon is its reliance on Double-Edge to significantly damage Wailord and Dewgong, and depending on which Hidden Power it uses, varying foes like Pelipper, Whiscash, and Sudowoodo can pose problems. Flareon is also weak to common Water- and Ground-type attacks from Pokemon such as Wailord, Glalie, and Metang, which can make fitting it onto teams difficult.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Specially defensive EV spreads with Wish and Baton Pass make Flareon much more secure against foes such as Haunter, Bellossom, and Plusle while keeping it from being too easily trapped by Diglett, although they falter against Water-types such as Wailord and Huntail. Alternatively, physically defensive spreads are workable due to Flareon's fantastic natural special bulk, make it harder for Haunter to pick it off with Explosion, help against Flying-types such as Murkrow and Pidgeot, and ensure Diglett's Earthquake never OHKOes Flareon. A Lum or Chesto Berry makes the Bellossom and Venomoth matchups trivial by cleansing sleep, and the latter has more general use if Flareon opts for Rest. Salac Berry in conjunction with Endure and Flail makes Flareon a potent late-game sweeper if the opponent lacks a priority move user, with Fire Blast and Hidden Power Grass ensuring its coverage remains solid. Curse + Baton Pass with White Herb supports physical powerhouses like Hitmonchan and gives Flareon a way to boost its own Attack, but Curse's Speed drop means you really only have one chance to make this strategy work. Hidden Power Water or Rock offers niche coverage for opposing Fire-types in Torkoal and Flareon, with the latter also hitting Pelipper, although they're generally outclassed. Choice Band lets Flareon net higher KO thresholds than Silk Scarf against foes like Wailord, Chimecho, and Dewgong when using Double-Edge, but this set makes Flareon more trappable and easier to take advantage of.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Defensive Wailord, Pelipper, and Whiscash all easily tank Flareon's Double-Edge, although the latter two must first scout which Hidden Power type it has. Offensive Water-types like Huntail, Octillery, and Crawdaunt take significantly more damage from Flareon's attacks, but they threaten to KO it back. Seadra and Dewgong get special mentions here for being faster than Flareon and KOing it with Hydro Pump and Surf, though the latter needs prior chip damage to do so.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Sudowoodo and Relicanth resist Flareon's strongest attacks, and the latter can EV to avoid being OHKOed by Hidden Power Grass. Pupitar can use non-Hidden Power Grass Flareon as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Torkoal and Sableye: Torkoal takes a pittance from any attack of Flareon's. If Flareon has Substitute + Toxic, though, it's wholly walled unless running a niche attack like Rock Slide.

Hidden Power Grass hits Rock-types such as Sudowoodo and Relicanth while offering more damage against Whiscash than Double-Edge.

Substitute lets Flareon take advantage of foes like Torkoal, Roselia, and Mawile that can't threaten it with their attacks, and it can use Substitute alongside Baton Pass to guarantee safe entry for its teammates. Alternatively, Toxic helps Flareon beat Fire- and Water-types like Torkoal, opposing Flareon, and Pelipper, whereas Wish helps Flareon check Pokemon such as Haunter and Bellossom throughout the game while supporting teammates like Metang and Chimecho that are prone to being worn down.

A neutrality to Electric and missing STAB on Earthquake can be a significant downside when considering it over Graveler and other Rock-types like Pupitar, but a wider movepool, including access to both Explosion and Focus Punch, ensures it has a place on teams needing a solid Rock-type that doesn't just cave in to the abundance of Grass- and Water-types in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sudowoodo has a surprisingly large movepool, but like most Pokemon in NU, there's little reason to use most of it. An Endure + Salac Berry + Flail set can hit like a truck, but Sudowoodo is excruciatingly slow; although with max Speed EVs, +1, and a Jolly nature it does outspeed max Speed Adamant Hitmonchan. Unfortunately, it loses out to anything faster than Hitmonchan. A more defensive RestTalk set is definitely viable; however, it's largely outclassed by Relicanth, which is more physically bulky and sports a slightly more useful defensive typing.</p> <p>As for single move options, Rock Tomb can allow Sudowoodo to get the jump on some defensive Pokemon like Kecleon. Block can prevent an Explosion target from escaping if the opponent predicts wrong. Finally, Calm Mind is an interesting option to allow Sudowoodo to tank a super effective Water- or Grass-type attack and blow the target up with Explosion. Please don't try to sweep with Calm Mind, though.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best initial switch-ins to Sudowoodo are defensive Grass-types, particularly Tangela, as they take little damage from Rock Slide, resist Earthquake, and can outspeed and threaten it with their STAB moves. Defensive Water-types, particularly Whiscash because it resists Rock Slide, are other good initial switch-ins. Both types really need to be wary of Explosion, however. Other Ground-, Rock-, and Steel-types are good switch-ins as well, as the former resist Sudowoodo's STAB moves and the latter two resist Explosion; good examples being Graveler, Relicanth, and Mawile. However, they all need to watch out for Focus Punch and Earthquake. Hitmonchan also resists Rock Slide and can take Sudowoodo out with Sky Uppercut. Finally, Haunter and Sableye get a special mention for being immune to Explosion and Focus Punch, and Haunter is even immune to Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>The good thing about Sudowoodo when choosing it as a Choice Band user is that it is quite flexible in what it can do. Rock Slide and Hidden Power Rock are the STAB move options; the choice comes down to whether you want perfect accuracy in Hidden Power Rock or a bit more power in Rock Slide. Earthquake pairs perfectly with its Rock-type STAB move to form near-perfect neutral coverage. Focus Punch can be used in the third slot to annihilate the foe if a switch can be predicted, but it can be kind of hard to use correctly. This makes Brick Break a decent alternative that still hits the defensive Normal-types in the tier harder than Sudowoodo's other moves. The last slot is dedicated to Sudowoodo's Normal move of choice. Explosion can take out nearly any Pokemon in the tier when backed by Choice Band, and in fact it is the strongest unboosted attack in the tier. Alternatively, Double-Edge is a fantastic safety move that can be great for when the opponent has both Pelipper and Hitmonchan waiting in the wings and you're not sure which they'll go to, and it doesn't have any recoil thanks to Rock Head.</p> <p>Sudowoodo is very slow, so simply maxing out HP and Attack is generally the best thing to do when using it. Running enough Speed to outpace Kecleon, Lairon, and Graveler is an option, but there's ultimately not much use in doing so, as the former two don't necessarily threaten Sudowoodo and the latter wins regardless. However, a couple EVs can be transferred from HP to Speed to make sure Sudowoodo can outpace Magcargo and Lickitung.</p> <p>There's not a lot of other options that can really find a spot on this set, since Sudowoodo gets such good coverage with the moves provided; however, Hidden Power Ghost can be used for a better hit on Haunter and Chimecho. This set works well as a lead for offensive teams that have a reliable answer to Hitmonchan, as it easily OHKOes common leads like Glalie, Venomoth, Flareon, and Mawile. Because Sudowoodo is so slow, it's easily revenge killed even by most defensive Pokemon running 0 Speed, so it needs some defensive support to work properly. Defensive Grass-types in particular have an easy time with Sudowoodo, making Flying-types like Murkrow and Pidgeot good teammates. Grass-types of your own make good teammates to pair with Sudowoodo, as they can switch into the multitude of Water-types in the tier, and Sudowoodo has an easy time with the aforementioned Flying-types to protect them. Specially defensive Normal-types like Lickitung and Kecleon make for great team choices to form a good defensive core with Sudowoodo. Finally, Chimecho and Haunter are good teammates to check Hitmonchan, as it can otherwise easily switch into Rock Slide and blow Sudowoodo away with its Sky Uppercut.</p>"
      },
      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes a more conservative approach to playing with Sudowoodo, taking advantage of the switches it causes to allow it to choose the correct move against the incoming Pokemon. Focus Punch pairs naturally well with Substitute, providing an extremely strong attack with good coverage when paired alongside Sudowoodo's Rock-type STAB move. The last slot depends on how you want to use Sudowoodo. With Explosion, Sudowoodo becomes a fantastic lure to be able to take out specific Pokemon with a level of certainty from behind a Substitute, particularly the Grass- and Water-types likely to switch into it. However, if you want Sudowoodo to stick around, Earthquake completes Sudowoodo's fantastic coverage and gives it a reliable tool for taking out Steel-types like Mawile.</p> <p>Running more Speed on this set has merit, as getting a Substitute up before a defensive Pokemon like Sableye or Kecleon can use Toxic is fantastic. How much Speed is up to you, but in doing so be aware that Sudowoodo's bulk drops significantly the more HP you take away due to its low base HP.</p> <p>This set tends to cause a lot of switches, making Spikes phenomenally useful, which also means Glalie and Roselia are good teammates. As Sudowoodo will largely be picking and choosing its target with Explosion on this set, if you choose to use it, having a Pokemon that thrives with the removal of the opponent's bulky Water- or Grass-type is highly recommended. Examples include special attacking Flareon or Plusle, depending on your target. Sudowoodo still easily counters most Flying- and Normal-types with this set, making it a good defensive teammate for Pokemon like offensive Grass-types and special walls like Kecleon. Finally, defensive Grass-types, namely Tangela, have an easy time countering this set, even with the threat of Focus Punch, making Flying-types like Murkrow and Pidgeot good teammates.</p>"

  "Sunflora": {
    "overview": "<p>If you venture outside of the NU game, you'll find Sunflora quite underpowered and unable to withstand most offense, especially on the physical side. Sunflora is definitely an overlooked Pokemon, even in NeverUsed, but it can be quite useful to a NU team in a couple different roles.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Encore is always worth a mention. Sunflora learns Endeavor, too, and NU is full of Quick Attack users to pair it with. Growth is an option to boost Sunflora's Special Attack. Swords Dance and Curse are comedy options, but Sunflora does learn them.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>For the SunnyBeamer, the only real question is Timid or Modest. Modest gives you quite a boost in Special Attack, but Sunflora will be slower than Jolly Raticate after using Sunny Day and tied with Timid Plusle and Minun if it uses Hidden Power Fire as that will lower its Speed IV by one. Timid allows Sunflora to outspeed everything in NU after the Sunny Day, but it may lack the power necessary. The special wall might surprise you if EVed similarly to the spread above. Modest Plusle's Hidden Power Ice is a 4HKO; likewise for a defensive Whiscash's Ice Beam. STAB Ice Beam from most Dewgong and Piloswine (200 Special Attack and below) is a 3HKO. You can go even more defensive at the expense of your attacking power, should you choose to.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Swalot will stop the SunnyBeamer cold and has Liquid Ooze for Leech Seed. Pidgeot cannot be OHKOed at full health by anything Sunflora can dish out unless it has Hidden Power Ice and a Petaya boost and can come in on a predicted Razor Leaf or Sunny Day. Roselia can come in and stack Spikes or Aromatherapy on the walling version and can Synthesis off its super effective Hidden Power.</p>",

This is pretty much an all or nothing sweeper, so the Petaya boost is more valuable than Leftovers would be. That is also why Grass Whistle is in the last slot. Its accuracy is hard to take, but it is the only option available to get rid of your opponent's counter and keep sweeping. The EVs given are for if you are Timid, as they will make you faster than Jolly Raticate and Adamant Sneasel after a Sunny Day. If you are Modest, just max Special Attack and Speed.</p>"},

  "Yanma": {
    "overview": "<p>Yanma differentiates itself from other Reversal sweepers such as Vigoroth with its unique access to Speed Boost and Spikes immunity. The unresisted type combination of Fighting and STAB Flying makes Yanma an absolute menace once the snowball starts rolling. Yanma also has nifty resistances to Grass and Fighting and an immunity to Ground. However, Yanma suffers from the same issues as any other Reversal sweeper: a vulnerability to priority and physically bulky Pokemon. Yanma's Attack stat is decent at best, only letting it dish out meaningful damage while at 1 HP and +1 Attack. Nevertheless, Yanma is one of NU's scariest late-game sweepers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shadow Ball perfectly rounds out Yanma's coverage in tandem with Reversal, but Hidden Power Flying does just as well and receives STAB. Toxic is great for nailing switch-ins as they come in, such as physically defensive Relicanth. However, Yanma should be played in a late-game role, not a mid-game role. Hypnosis can be used in conjunction with Yanma's other ability Compound Eyes on a specially offensive set utilizing Substitute and two of either Psychic, Giga Drain, and a special Hidden Power, most likely Hidden Power Fire. This set can be used early- to mid-game instead of late-game, since it doesn't revolve around sweeping but rather around incapacitating foes and firing off attacks. Hidden Power Bug is Yanma's strongest Bug-type STAB attack, but it prevents Yanma from using Hidden Power Flying, which undoubtedly is a stronger coverage move to utilize with Reversal.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Priority such as Mach Punch from Hitmonchan and Quick Attack from Flareon is the ultimate stop for snowballing Endure / Substitute + Reversal Pokemon such as Yanma once they bring themselves down to 1 HP. There are also certain physically defensive walls that Yanma cannot break even at +1, such as Relicanth, Torkoal, and Sableye. Lastly, although they are few and far between, Pokemon such as Golbat and Wailord can phaze Yanma with Whirlwind.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Reversal": {
        "description": "<p>Substitute shields Yanma from status and, more importantly, cuts down its HP by 25%, allowing it to accumulate several Speed boosts as it brings itself to 1 HP for maximum Reversal Base Power and the activation of its Liechi Berry. Reversal is Yanma's most spammable move once it gets down to 1 HP, OHKOing a multitude of Pokemon such as Hitmonchan, Flareon, and Mawile. Hidden Power Flying provides STAB and synergizes well with Reversal, hitting Bug- and Poison-types such as opposing Yanma, Venomoth, and Roselia super effectively. Protect ensures that Yanma's Speed Boost activates before attempting a sweep, eliminating the majority of the risk associated with utilizing other Endure and Substitute + Reversal Pokemon, which can be outsped by the opposition.</p> <p>An Adamant nature alongside maximum Attack and Speed EVs gives Yanma the best opportunity to sweep late-game. Because Yanma will almost always use Protect turn one, it's more advantageous to utilize an Adamant nature over a Jolly one. Unless Yanma can be guaranteed to KO the opposing Pokemon, using Substitute until it's at 1 HP is by far Yanma's safest play. It's important to utilize the lack of a Team Preview to your advantage by not bringing Yanma in until late-game when it has the greatest chance of sweeping. Specially attacking teammates such as Huntail and Haunter that can break down physical walls such as Relicanth, Torkoal, Sableye, and Shuckle all help Yanma sweep late-game by removing some of its greatest checks. Spikes support is important for Yanma, as all of its best checks are grounded, and Yanma needs help getting KOs considering its low Attack. Roselia is the most reliable setter available, as it is the bulkiest and has access to reliable recovery, although Glalie and Cacturne work fine too. Keep in mind that Yanma, Roselia, Cacturne, and Glalie all share a common weakness in Fire and that they will need proper team support to help cover these extra weaknesses.</p>"

  "Murkrow": {
    "overview": "<p>Murkrow is one of the most simple, yet one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the NU metagame. An extremely high Speed stat, STAB Drill Peck, and really high Attack when combined with a Choice Band give it an incredible offensive presence on the battlefield. While it's extremely similar to Pidgeot, which even boasts the same Speed stat, Murkrow has a slightly better typing, ability, and overall coverage than its brother-in-wings. Insomnia makes Murkrow a golden answer to a majority of the Grass-types in the tier (though it needs to be really wary of Stun Spore), and its Dark typing means it can get a free switch into Chimecho's STAB Psychic and threaten it back with Shadow Ball. While it is much, much frailer than Pidgeot, and its STAB Drill Peck is leagues weaker than Pidgeot's Double-Edge, there's still very little risk to using Murkrow. Quoth the raven: \"your walls will be nevermore.\"</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There's a lot Murkrow \"can\" do but not a lot it \"should\" do. Losing the power of Choice Band is almost sickening, but forgoing it and replacing Double-Edge with Substitute and Choice Band with Liechi Berry is an option, and doing so can help when you're unsure of what your opponent will do next while protecting Murkrow from status from defensive teams. Thunder Wave can cripple a switch-in, but most Pokemon that will be switching into Murkrow are super slow already. Perish trapping the opposing Pokemon is an option, but Murkrow hardly lacks the bulk to effectively pull this off in any capacity. Finally, Calm Mind is there, but Murkrow's strongest STAB move, Feint Attack, is horribly weak even at +1, and Murkrow has no coverage other than Hidden Power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The number one counter to Murkrow is defensive Mawile. Intimidate removes Hidden Power Ground as an effective answer to it, and in return, Mawile can slap Murkrow around with Hidden Power Steel or use Murkrow as setup bait. Defensive Relicanth is a close second, though it fears Hidden Power Grass more than it would like. That said, nothing else from Murkrow is going to leave a lasting scratch on it. Other Steel- and Rock-types, such as Metang, Lairon, Graveler, and Sudowoodo, are great answers to Murkrow, though they all have to be more wary about Hidden Power Ground, especially if Spikes are on their side of the field.</p> <p>Apart from those that resist Drill Peck, generally physically bulky Pokemon like Piloswine can tank an attack and easily KO Murkrow back; other examples of which include Whiscash, Wailord, Dewgong, and Swalot. Plusle and Haunter cannot switch into Murkrow safely, but they outspeed Murkrow and easily OHKO it with Thunderbolt, and Raticate does the same with Double-Edge.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Murkrow's STAB Drill Peck is, undeniably, one of the best moves in a tier where Hitmonchan, Grass-types, and Bug-types abound. What's more, it's powerful enough to 2HKO 252 HP Piloswine and OHKO Raticate when boosted by a Choice Band, indicating its pure unadulterated power. Hidden Power Ground takes out the Rock- and Steel-types bold enough to try stepping into the path of Murkrow's Drill Peck, easily 2HKOing Sudowoodo, Lairon, Metang, and Graveler after a layer of Spikes. Hidden Power Ground is preferred to Hidden Power Fighting for its super effective hit on Poison-types, particularly Swalot, but Hidden Power Fighting offers a super effective hit on Normal-types and doesn't let the multitude of Ground-immune Pokemon switch in for free. Shadow Ball and Double-Edge are largely filler but can be used as safety moves when you're unsure of which way your opponent is going to go. Shadow Ball is particularly nice for its super effective hit on Chimecho and neutral hit on Rock-types.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is absolutely needed to not only get the Speed tie with other Murkrow and Pidgeot but also outspeed the base 90 Speed tier, which notably includes Venomoth and Vigoroth. Dropping down to Adamant gives Murkrow more power, but losing those Speed ties and getting outsped by positive-natured base 80s like Glalie is a death wish. Sharp Beak can be used to bluff a Choice Band while keeping high power on Drill Peck and gaining the ability to switch moves, although the drop in power on its other moves is super noticeable. There are only two notable move changes to consider on this set. The first is replacing Hidden Power Ground or Hidden Power Fighting with Hidden Power Grass and using a Naughty nature, as doing so gives Murkrow an easy way to blow past its biggest nemesis in Relicanth along with Graveler and Whiscash. Hidden Power Ground will be better most times, however, particularly against the likes of Mawile and the other Steel-types. The second is Pursuit, which can be used effectively in the last moveslot over Double-Edge when you know your opponent is going to switch, in particular being a nice tool for Chimecho; just be sure to change Murkrow's nature to Naughty when doing so. Pursuit is a terrible move to be locked into, though, so it's recommended to only use it with Sharp Beak.</p> <p>Spikes support is incredible with this set, as it pushes a ton of Pokemon into 2HKO range, particularly the Rock- and Steel-types weak to Hidden Power Ground, and the only Pokemon that can really tank attacks from Murkrow are grounded (Pelipper being about the only exception). Due to this, Glalie and Cacturne make exceptional offensive Spikes partners to use with Murkrow, and both have an easy time OHKOing the Rock-types that can withstand Murkrow's attacks.</p> <p>Murkrow is a great counter to the defensive Grass-types in the tier and a great check to the offensive ones, meaning Rock- and Water-types such as Sudowoodo and Seadra appreciate having Murkrow as an offensive teammate to eliminate them. Murkrow also generally has an easy time with Chimecho, if it avoids Hidden Power Electric anyway, meaning Hitmonchan likes having Murkrow as a teammate too. Loading on Choice Band users on your team is a good strategy when using Murkrow, as very little in the tier can take on that kind of onslaught, particularly if Murkrow is used with its partner in crime Pidgeot.</p> <p>Defensive Relicanth and Mawile are probably the best switch-ins to Murkrow, with the former only really fearing Hidden Power Grass and the latter weakening Murkrow with Intimidate. Due to this, Murkrow absolutely needs teammates that can reliably switch into these Pokemon and try to eliminate them. If your prediction is good, Diglett is an almost surefire way of trapping and getting rid of Mawile. Otherwise, a Grass-type like Tangela has a very easy time with Relicanth and other Rock-types, while Fire-types like Torkoal can switch into Mawile with impunity and force it out with Fire Blast. Plusle and Haunter have an easy time revenge killing Murkrow, so bringing something to absorb Electric attacks is a good idea; Grass- and Ground-types being good general partners to do so.</p>"

However, two of the best Dark-types in NU, Murkrow and Sableye, are neutral or immune to it. Other Hidden Power types that threatening Pokemon such as Vigoroth and Flareon might be immune to, including Ghost and Fire, are not recommended. All physical variants of Unown should move the Special Attack EVs into Attack, change the nature from Modest to Adamant, and equip Unown with a Choice Band. Chimecho is a worthwhile replacement for your Unown team slot, as they both have Levitate, and Chimecho has better base stats than Unown in all departments except for Attack, which neither one uses on their primary set.

Regardless, Piloswine is a veritable tank in the tier, being very hard to OHKO and usually being able to OHKO the foe back with the right move. However, low Speed, a lack of resistances, and a vulnerability to the many Grass-, Fire-, and Water-types in the tier, as well as Hitmonchan, lower Piloswine's general effectiveness. Still, its lack of a Ground-type weakness is nice, and its access to a plethora of moves outside of Earthquake like Roar gives it some utility over its main competition in Graveler.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Similar to the screen lure set, Piloswine can make use of a Substitute + 3 attacks set to protect itself from an attack and possibly KO the opponent in return. However, using a screen not only allows Piloswine to do the same but also supports the rest of its team. Still, Piloswine can make 101 HP Substitutes, and Substitute blocks all status, allowing it to really work its magic against a stall-heavy team where a screen would not. As for other sets, the only one not really mentioned is a RestTalk set. However, Piloswine's lack of resistances makes this set undesirable compared to the tank sets provided above.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best initial switch-ins to Piloswine are bulky Water-types, as they aren't weak to any of the moves that Piloswine carries save for Toxic and can remove Piloswine with a STAB Water move. Dewgong and Pelipper in particular make exceptional switch-ins if they avoid Rock Slide, and Wailord, Whiscash, and Huntail all can make quick work of Piloswine with Surf. Grass-types such as Bellossom, Tangela, and Cacturne resist Earthquake and take little from Piloswine's other physical moves, although they all will take a hefty chunk from Blizzard. Fire-types like Flareon and Charmeleon cannot switch into Piloswine very safely, but they can take it out easily with STAB Fire Blast once in.</p> <p>Hitmonchan easily takes out Piloswine with Sky Uppercut, but it too has a hard time switching directly into Earthquake and dislikes Toxic. Physically defensive Lickitung with Heal Bell is probably the safest switch-in to Piloswine in the tier, although it's massive setup bait for much of the tier and needs to be careful of the screen lure set. In the same vein, Heal Bell Chimecho can switch into most Piloswine easily but needs to be careful of Choice Band-boosted attacks like Double-Edge.

However, with a layer of Spikes on the opposing side of the field, Piloswine cleanly 2HKOes even fully physically defensive Whiscash and isn't OHKOed by Surf in return, assuming the above EV spread. Piloswine tends to draw in Fire-, Grass-, and Water-type attacks, making special walls like Flareon, Kecleon, and Dewgong really important teammates to bring with Piloswine. Venomoth and Flying-types also make good switch-ins to Grass-type attacks, while Grass-types like Roselia and Electric-types like Plusle can scare out most Water-types.</p> <p>Hitmonchan is very dangerous for this set to deal with, making Chimecho, Haunter, and Flying-types important teammates to bring when using Piloswine. Piloswine also makes a really good check to Plusle and Haunter, unlike most of the other Ground- or Rock-types in the tier, due in part to its higher bulk, its immunity to Electric, and the fact that it's not totally destroyed by Grass- or Ice-type attacks. With this fact in mind, Piloswine also makes a good partner to Pokemon especially weak to the aforementioned Pokemon, such as Huntail and Mawile.</p>"

      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>Piloswine is the epitome of the word \"tank,\" and it really shows its true colors with this set. While not packing as much power as with a Choice Band, this set aims to take attacks and dish them out, spreading and taking as much damage as possible before going down. This set is very flexible thanks to the ability to switch moves, and Piloswine's longevity is truly surprising with just Leftovers recovery.</p> <p>To give an idea of Piloswine's tankishness, with the given EV spread, Piloswine avoids the 2HKO from Choice Band Raticate's Return after Protect and easily 2HKOes with Earthquake in return. This set is also less susceptible to special attackers like Plusle and Haunter than most of Piloswine's other sets due to its ability to stall for Leftovers recovery and switch moves to play around those sporting Levitate.</p> <p>Ice Beam and Blizzard do a good amount of damage to the Flying-types that are immune to Earthquake, as well as to Tangela. Toxic + Protect allows Piloswine to spread residual damage around the opponent's team and stall for Leftovers recovery. However, either can be replaced with Roar, which is an actually highly sought-after move in the tier and allows Piloswine to phaze dangerous setup sweepers like Bulk Up Vigoroth and rack up potential Spikes damage.</p> <p>The Special Attack investment of this set allows Piloswine to OHKO Tangela, offensive Shelgon, and Murkrow with Ice Beam as well as get the 2HKO on Haunter. With the same spread, Blizzard has a chance to OHKO even Pidgeot and ensures the OHKO on Graveler. Brave is the needed nature to make sure Earthquake does enough damage to relevant targets like Swalot, with which Piloswine easily 2HKOes physically defensive variants. All this said, the STAB Ice move and Special Attack investment can be dropped in favor of Rock Slide or Double-Edge with the EVs pumped into Attack instead. However, doing so removes a lot of utility and uniqueness that Piloswine holds by making use of its Ice STAB.</p> <p>Piloswine is a little harder to switch into with this set for defensive Pokemon, as many do not like taking a potential Toxic, but Grass- and Water-type switch-ins will still be the most common. RestTalk Dewgong in particular can switch into this set without much fear, so a teammate that can take it out like Hitmonchan is a must. Flareon, Murkrow, and Haunter make good teammates to capitalize on the opponent's Grass-types and appreciate Piloswine's ability to spread damage around the opposing team, making a few KOs for the latter two in particular easier when Toxic and Spikes damage have been spread around a bit. As always, Hitmonchan is super threatening for Piloswine, making Chimecho a brilliant teammate as well as Poison-types such as Golbat and Swalot.</p>"

      "Screen Lure": {
        "description": "<p>Piloswine tends to lure in a large array of special attackers, particularly Water-types, but Grass- and Fire-types too. The latter two are actually weak to Piloswine's STAB moves, and because of this fact, this set is extremely effective at getting the jump on those Pokemon by using Light Screen as a buffer shield as they switch in and causing them to fail to KO Piloswine while it easily KOes back with the appropriate move. Piloswine also lures in Hitmonchan too, making Reflect a decent alternative to Light Screen, although Piloswine will only be doing 72.3 - 85.5% to 4/0 Hitmonchan with Earthquake and the given EV spread.</p> <p>Screen support in general is great in NU. To give an idea of its effectiveness, Modest Huntail can't even OHKO Piloswine with Surf in the rain with Light Screen up, while Piloswine in return can rack up damage with Toxic or Earthquake or safely switch out to a teammate like Plusle to take it head on. The possibilities are truly endless with this set, allowing Piloswine to tank attacks from Pokemon it otherwise fears, such as Flareon, Tangela, and Roselia, and really turn the tables on them, with the only caveat being you must be able to predict and set up the Light Screen on the switch. The combination of a screen and Roar also makes Piloswine arguably the best phazer in the tier, for five turns at a time anyway, and prevents really dangerous threats from being able to use Piloswine as setup bait.</p> <p>The EV spread includes Special Attack investment to allow Piloswine to OHKO Shelgon, Tangela, and Murkrow with Ice Beam and OHKO Pidgeot and Graveler with Blizzard. Blizzard also allows Piloswine to 2HKO bulky Sunny Day Bellossom after Spikes while only taking roughly ~60% in return from Solar Beam from behind a Light Screen.</p> <p>Plusle absolutely adores this set as a teammate, as Piloswine most commonly lures in Water-types, and from behind a Light Screen Plusle can switch in especially easily and force the foe out or KO it with its STAB Thunderbolt. Pokemon that enjoy Fire- or Grass-types out of the way make the best possible teammates for this set, as they can then capitalize on their absence and hopefully sweep. Good examples of these include Mawile, Kingler, Dragon Dance Pupitar, and frail sweepers like Pikachu.</p> <p>Pokemon that can make use of the screen support, particularly setup sweepers, make especially good teammates as well. Bulk Up Vigoroth, Swords Dance Tropius, and weather sweepers like Huntail and Bellossom are all exceptionally dangerous when protected by the right screen. As a bonus, the weather sweepers in particular have an easy time switching into the attacks that are normally directed at Piloswine too. Finally, Hitmonchan is as always a threat to this set, and while rare, it could also be carrying Brick Break, making a teammate that can take it out like Chimecho or Pidgeot essential to this set's success.</p>"

Octillery is also the best recipient of stat boosts via Baton Pass in the tier thanks to its ability Suction Cups, which prevents foes from dealing with it by phazing it, and it can also utilize Thunder Wave to help make up for its poor Speed. Unfortunately, because of said meager Speed, Octillery heavily struggles against faster foes like Haunter, Plusle, and Pikachu if it lacks Speed boosts or doesn't get the chance to paralyze them. Additionally, Octillery is outclassed both offensively and defensively by Wailord and Dewgong due to its poor bulk and inability to get past checks with utility moves like Self-Destruct and Encore.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Octillery can opt for more Speed EVs to outspeed targets faster than Relicanth; 164 Speed EVs let it outpace base 65 Speed Pokemon like Roselia and Flareon, while 204 Speed EVs give it the jump on Dewgong. Do note, however, that Octillery will serve as an even worse switch-in to resisted attacks. A Lum Berry can be utilized on the Baton Pass-based set to make Octillery less vulnerable to status, especially if it isn't being Baton Passed a Substitute.

Fire Blast targets Grass-types such as Roselia, Cacturne, and Bellossom. Additionally, its ability to OHKO lead Glalie and Venomoth makes it superior to more accurate moves like Ice Beam and Flamethrower. Hidden Power Electric rounds out Octillery's coverage by hitting Water-types like Wailord, Dewgong, and Pelipper super effectively, although Hidden Power Grass works as an alternative to target Relicanth as opposed to Pelipper for 4x super effective damage. Thunder Wave helps make up for Octillery's poor Speed and lets it support its team by crippling faster Pokemon like Golbat and Pidgeot. 84 Speed EVs let Octillery outspeed Relicanth, while the remaining EVs with a Modest nature make Octillery stronger and bulkier. Leftovers provides Octillery with useful recovery so it can pivot into certain attacks like Flareon's Flamethrower and Wailord's Surf more frequently, although Lum Berry is a great option if Octillery is being used as a lead to improve its matchup against Venomoth. Suction Cups is mostly useless, although it's nice to prevent the foe from phazing Octillery to rack up Spikes damage.</p> <p>If Octillery isn't being used as a lead, it is ideal to bring it in on weak, resisted attacks such as Flareon's Flamethrower and Wailord's Surf to preserve its HP. Once on the field, the goal should be to take advantage of Octillery's great coverage to hit predicted switch-ins such as Roselia and Pelipper with the appropriate coverage move. If the opponent has a dedicated special wall like Kecleon or Vigoroth, paralyzing it with Thunder Wave or simply switching out to a check is ideal. When Octillery is in the lead slot, the main goal will be to force out opposing leads with Octillery's positive matchup against them to reveal other members and get hard hits off early-game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon such as Pupitar, Calm Mind Chimecho, and Haunter appreciate Octillery's wallbreaking support enabling them to clean late-game more effectively. Because Octillery isn't as reliable as other Water-types at switching into Fire- and Water-type attacks, Pokemon like Flareon and Roselia are useful to provide secondary switch-ins to such attacks. Flareon can also bring Octillery in against Pokemon like Torkoal and Relicanth with Baton Pass, Roselia's Spikes help support Octillery's wallbreaking, and both can switch into Grass-type attacks. Normal- and Flying-types such as Raticate, Pidgeot, and Murkrow benefit from Octillery pressuring Rock- and Steel-types; in return, they help against special walls.</p>"

Ice Beam targets Grass-types such as Roselia, Cacturne, and Tropius and is generally preferred to Fire Blast for its greater accuracy despite requiring two Special Attack boosts to OHKO Roselia. Hidden Power Electric gives Octillery a way to threaten Water-types like Wailord and Dewgong. Substitute shields Octillery from status moves and critical hits. 144 Speed EVs enable Octillery to outspeed Raticate after two Speed boosts, while the remaining EVs with a Modest nature improve its bulk and attacking power.

Mawile can help provide Defense boosts, while Plusle supplies Speed boosts. Delcatty gives Octillery its Special Attack and Special Defense boosts and can even pass Wish in case Octillery is entering a field with Spikes.

  "Pupitar": {
    "overview": "<p>A trolly base 51 Speed (getting to outspeed fully invested base 50s before boosting is pretty golden) and a great offensive typing are enough tools to give Pupitar an edge in the NU metagame, but what really makes Pupitar one of the absolute top offensive threats in the tier is its access to Dragon Dance. At just +1, Pupitar packs only slightly less power than Choice Band Relicanth while also outspeeding every unboosted Pokemon in the tier. Its access to fantastic offensive STAB moves cannot be understated, and Hidden Power Bug and Hidden Power Flying both give Pupitar the coverage it needs. Even its ability Shed Skin is a gigantic perk that protects it somewhat against sleep, burn, and paralysis, and with a natural immunity to Thunder Wave, Pupitar has an easy time steamrolling over purely defensive teams. The only major downside is that Pupitar is rather slow before boosting, which can leave it vulnerable to more offensive teams. Outside of Dragon Dance, though, Pupitar is heavily outclassed by the other Rock-types in the tier, which are far stronger and bulkier, including Graveler, Sudowoodo, and Relicanth.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There are a lot of different ways to play with Pupitar, but almost none of them will be as effective as the set above. Taunt + Dragon Dance and Substitute + Dragon Dance both have their perks and can secure a sweep where just having the coverage of Hidden Power Bug would not, but finding the time to use both moves can be a daunting task when a good portion of the tier has a move that will hit Pupitar super effectively. Adding Liechi Berry to the Substitute + Dragon Dance set is an option that has a huge payoff if done well. A bulky EV spread and the Dragon Dance set above can be done, but Pupitar doesn't have much bulk to speak of, and the only real benefit would be making Pupitar harder to KO with Hitmonchan's Mach Punch.</p> <p>A Choice Band set is certainly doable, and Pupitar has a huge perk in outspeeding max Speed Mawile and other base 50s like Piloswine. However, while there may be a bit of a surprise factor to running Choice Band, Pupitar will still be weaker than the likes of Sudowoodo and Graveler and would much rather keep its main advantage of outspeeding the tier after a boost rather than having immediately strong moves. Finally, Toxic is an option to get cripple defensive Tangela, but that's about the only target it'll make an impact on.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Physically defensive Tangela is probably the ultimate switch-in to Pupitar, as it's not 2HKOed by anything a +1 Pupitar can throw at it and easily OHKOes in return with Hidden Power Grass. Even at +5 Pupitar will fail to OHKO defensive Tangela with Hidden Power Bug. Physically defensive Whiscash, Wailord, and Kingler are probably the next best defensive switch-ins to Pupitar, as they can tank an Earthquake with ease and OHKO Pupitar in return with Surf. Physically defensive Relicanth can tank an Earthquake or two if using Protect and easily 2HKO Pupitar with its own Earthquake.</p> <p>Bulky Hitmonchan, Hitmonchan with Mach Punch, and Machoke can prevent Pupitar from getting too dangerous and pick off weakened ones easily enough. Defensive Bellossom takes a lot from Hidden Power Bug but also easily OHKOes with Hidden Power Grass or Giga Drain. Offensive Water-types like Seadra and Huntail will be able to tank an attack and OHKO in return, but they will leave the exchange heavily battered. It should be noted that Huntail can even use a +1 Pupitar as setup bait if Huntail is at full health, as it can tank an Earthquake, set up Rain Dance, and then outspeed and OHKO the next turn; Timid Huntail is fast enough to not fear Pupitar getting to +2 either. Finally, Piloswine can tank multiple attacks from Pupitar from behind a Reflect and easily OHKO in return with Earthquake.</p>",

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Ideally, only bring out Pupitar late-game when the opponent's walls have been sufficiently weakened, set up Dragon Dance immediately, and pummel foes with the appropriate move. Earthquake + Rock Slide is great STAB coverage and all that Pupitar really needs most of the time. At +1, Rock Slide is a guaranteed OHKO vs 252 HP Glalie and offensive Pelipper, whereas Hidden Power Rock just falls short and doesn't come with a flinch chance, making Rock Slide the more desired option for Rock STAB despite the lower accuracy.</p> <p>Hidden Power Bug can be used in the last slot for a reliable 2HKO on all but the most physically defensive Chimecho and Grass-types like Bellossom and Tangela, though standard defensive Tangela can avoid the 2HKO and OHKO Pupitar in return with its STAB moves. Protect is a neat alternative that can bide time for Leftovers recovery, pushing Pupitar out of a 3HKO range from Seismic Toss and Night Shade. Protect also comes with the benefit of scouting the opponent's Choice Band moves and allows for extra turns to activate Shed Skin if needed.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is needed for Pupitar to outpace the entire unboosted tier after a single Dragon Dance, as well as ensure that Pupitar can outspeed maximum investment base 50s before boosting, primarily Timid Bellossom. An Adamant nature can be used, but this leaves Pupitar at only 302 Speed at +1, leaving it outsped by all maximum investment base 90s and up, including big threats like Venomoth, Haunter, and Plusle. Taunt is a great choice for the last slot as it prevents the opponent from setting up on it or healing and can bide time for extra turns of Leftovers recovery and Shed Skin activation. Hidden Power Flying is the best alternative to Hidden Power Bug as it gets a super effective hit on Hitmonchan and retains the super effective hit on Bellossom and Tangela. Rest can be used in the last slot to let Pupitar quickly recover health and remove status manually, and it has a high chance of wearing off early thanks to Shed Skin. This is difficult to pull off though, especially considering that even extremely defensive teams will have multiple moves that will easily 2HKO Pupitar. Finally, Double-Edge can fill out the set and is a great safety move to use when you're unsure of what the opponent will switch to next, although it does come with some recoil.</p> <p>Spikes are a great tool to generally weaken the checks and counters to Pupitar, as all of them are grounded, particularly the Grass- and Water-types. Flareon and Murkrow are good partners to take out the Grass-types that threaten Pupitar easily, while Plusle and Grass-types of your own can take out the Water-types that stand in Pupitar's path. Hidden Power Grass Plusle for example can eliminate Whiscash and nearly all of the other Water-types in the tier. Physically defensive Chimecho tank Pupitar's STAB moves and threatens an easy 2HKO back with Psychic if Pupitar lacks Hidden Power Bug, making Sableye and Metang good partners too.</p> <p>Pupitar can have a tough time setting up if it can't get in against a Normal-, Bug-, Rock-, or Flying-type locked into an ineffective move, making an Encore partner or a screen partner a good teammate as well to give Pupitar the best chance of setting up as possible. A particularly good screen partner is Reflect Piloswine, as it tends to lure in Hitmonchan and can eliminate its threat of Mach Punch before bringing in Pupitar to clean the rest of the opponent's team.</p>"

However, its unique access to Heal Bell + Roar allows it to compress the roles of cleric and phazer for defensively oriented Spikes stacking teams; this, in tandem with Intimidate and heavy defensive investment, allows Mightyena to pivot into physical attackers such as Pupitar and Vigoroth with relative ease and Roar them out. However, Mightyena is quite passive, not only losing one-on-one against three of the strongest Pokemon in the tier, Hitmonchan, Huntail, and Flareon, but also struggling in matchups against Roselia, Mawile, and the majority of special attackers. Mightyena's lack of notable resistances and reliable recovery further hampers its effectiveness as a defensive Pokemon. Hence, Mightyena should only be considered on teams specifically designed for setting up Spikes and phazing, as otherwise Chimecho or Roselia will better serve as a cleric.</p>",

Offensive sets utilizing either Choice Band or Howl can make use of the perfect neutral coverage that Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting provide.

While Hitmonchan prefers not to be badly poisoned by Toxic as it switches in, Machoke doesn't mind whatsoever, as poison activates Guts. Poison- and Steel-types such as Roselia, Venomoth, and Mawile are immune to Toxic, take very little from Crunch, and can either set hazards or super effectively hit Mightyena in return. Strong special attackers such as Plusle, Dewgong, and Wailord can all 2HKO Mightyena.

Crunch prevents Mightyena from being overly passive even if uninvested, letting it nab several important KOs such as 3HKOing Huntail when combined with repeated Spikes damage. Toxic nails Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Sableye as they switch in and, in tandem with Spikes support, further drains opposing Pokemon's health.</p> <p>It's dangerous to rely on Mightyena to check multiple threats throughout the match unless you have Wish support. All of NU's viable Wish users have an unfavorable matchup against Hitmonchan, unlike Chimecho, which can sufficiently heal itself. Thus, unless phazing is an absolute necessity for your team, it's probably better to use Chimecho. Mightyena needs to be paired with a Spiker to function properly; Roselia is an optimal choice, thanks to not only having no overlapping type weaknesses, unlike Glalie and Cacturne, but also having access to reliable recovery using Synthesis. Furthermore, Roselia sports the best bulk out of all three of NU's Spikers, fitting best on the defensively oriented teams Mightyena enjoys being used on. Mightyena also needs a bulky spinblocker to keep Spikes in play and check the most prominent Rapid Spin user, Hitmonchan. Sableye is ideal for this. Possessing Fighting- and Normal-type immunities and reliable recovery, Sableye can switch into Hitmonchan time and time again fearing nothing but Toxic, which Mightyena can alleviate with Heal Bell.</p>"

Vigoroth's Normal typing is somewhat of a hindrance, however, as it has trouble hitting Ghost-types, particularly Haunter and Sableye, and is weak to the omnipresent Hitmonchan. While Vigoroth's bulk is good, it has a low base 55 Special Defense stat. However, with the right EV investment, Vigoroth can still be an incredibly bulky and threatening Pokemon in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Vigoroth sports a gigantic movepool and good enough stats to run just about anything, allowing it add a niche option to any of its sets in order to surprise your opponent. Do note though that the moves provided above give Vigoroth the best overall potential when on the battlefield. Crush Claw can actually be pretty cool, as it can allow Vigoroth to potentially break through physically defensive Relicanth, allowing it to 2HKO with Earthquake once Relicanth is at -2. Bulk Up will overall be more useful as it simultaneously provides Vigoroth with Defense boosts and is not reliant on the opponent staying on the battlefield, but it can be an interesting stallbreaking tool on sets that are strapped for moveslots, as it will also fulfill the need for a STAB move. Rock Slide is an option that allows Vigoroth to hit Flying-types like Golbat super effectively while also catching Fire-types like Flareon and Torkoal in the same slot. Facade is an alternative STAB option to capitalize on the fact that Vigoroth is a common target of Toxic; however, Return and Body Slam are overall more reliable and non-dependent on being inflicted with status. Rain Dance or Sunny Day can be run to help support a teammate, and Vigoroth is one of the fastest users of the moves available in the tier. Finally, Yawn can be used to force the foe to switch out or put them to sleep, although Encore and Taunt are overall more useful for stallbreaking.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ghost-types are the most significant counter to Vigoroth, though Haunter has to watch out for Shadow Ball. Sableye in particular walls every Vigoroth set excluding ones with Taunt or Toxic. Steel-types like Metang and Mawile are difficult to break without Earthquake, but the latter needs to watch out for Reversal, Brick Break, or Focus Punch as well. Bulky Rock-types like Sudowoodo and Relicanth resist Vigoroth's Normal-type STAB moves and take surprisingly little from all super effective coverage due to their sheer bulk. Toxic renders almost every Vigoroth set useless, as many require certain HP or multiple turns to set up, thus reducing Vigoroth's overall usefulness throughout a match.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>The purpose of this set is to provide a bulky setup sweeper that is difficult to break after acquiring boosts. Return is the more powerful STAB option; however, Body Slam can be used to fish for paralysis. Earthquake is used to hit Steel-types such as Mawile and Metang and Rock-types like Relicanth and Sudowoodo. Shadow Ball hits Ghost-types like Haunter super effectively, but it still is not doing very much damage to Sableye. Alternatively, Substitute protects Vigoroth from status but leaves it without useful coverage. Slack Off guarantees recovery for Vigoroth, allowing it to have a good matchup versus bulky teams lacking solid checks.</p> <p>The EV spread provided helps compensate for Vigoroth's poor special bulk and allows it to manually boost its Defense with Bulk Up. Vigoroth best sets up on weaker attackers such as Roselia and Mawile when given free turns, but it needs to make sure it is able to set up multiple boosts before it attempts to take on Hitmonchan. It also should make sure any phazers are eliminated or able to be OHKOed before they can force Vigoroth out if it wants any chance of sweeping. Vigoroth is almost hard countered by Sableye, so make sure it is removed or significantly weakened before attempting to set up with Vigoroth. Ghost-types in general trouble Vigoroth, and as Haunter is immune to Earthquake due to Levitate, it is advised that all Ghost-types be dealt with beforehand. It also struggles with Rock- and Steel-types, so they should also be weakened or removed prior. However, they can struggle to break through Vigoroth in return without Toxic or Explosion. Vigoroth needs to be wary about Toxic, as it can render it almost useless, since it nearly always needs quite a few turns to set up. Vigoroth appreciates Pursuit support from Pokemon like Houndour and Murkrow to help deal with troublesome Ghost-types. Vigoroth also likes having teammates like Golbat and Chimecho that can sponge Fighting-type attacks, the latter of which can also provide some crucial Heal Bell support in the event of Vigoroth getting inflicted by Toxic.</p>"
      },
      "Flail + Reversal": {
        "description": "<p>As a more offensive approach to Vigoroth, this set aims to take advantage of the fact that it is the only Pokemon capable of running Flail and Reversal, and it uses this to great effect. Endure is used to guarantee to survive a hit that would OHKO it at 1 HP; however, it relies more on prediction than Substitute. Substitute, however, requires Vigoroth to be faster than whatever it is using it against before Salac Berry activates and can get thoroughly messed up by Spikes currently on your side of the field. Flail is a powerful STAB move that will have 200 Base Power in ideal circumstances. Reversal can be a powerful 200 Base Power Fighting-type move that hits Steel- and Rock-types that resist Flail, but it is also reliant at being low on HP. Shadow Ball allows Vigoroth to hit Haunter as well as Sableye, but it fails at doing anything to Sableye if it has any sort of HP left.</p> <p>Salac Berry raises Vigoroth's Speed when it is under a quarter of its total HP. If running Substitute, more HP investment might be useful, as Vigoroth might be able to survive some weak hits behind Substitute. However, Vigoroth's HP should always be a multiple of 4 plus 1 to allow it to get down to 1 HP. An Adamant nature can be used for more power, but Jolly can be used if Vigoroth wants to outspeed Huntail in rain after its Salac Berry activates. Vigoroth appreciates Pokemon that can deal with Ghost-types such as Steel-types, Pursuit trappers, and many specially defensive RestTalk users. Ground-types can be used to deal with Pokemon like Metang, which resists Flail and takes Reversal neutrally, though it is 2HKOed by a maximum Base Power Reversal. Rapid Spin users like Hitmonchan and Wartortle are a necessity for sets involving Substitute to work properly, and sets utilizing Endure appreciate them as well. Either Flail or Reversal can be replaced by Return or Brick Break, respectively, if you are concerned about having two moves that are reliant on Vigoroth getting down to 1 HP to be useful. However, replacing either makes Vigoroth a worse sweeper should circumstances allow Vigoroth to successfully get to 1 HP.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band is a good option for Vigoroth if it wants immediate power, resulting in Vigoroth being one of the fastest and strongest wallbreakers available in NU. Return or Double-Edge can be used, but Return is preferred for its lack of recoil damage even though it doesn't hit as hard. Earthquake hits Rock- and Steel-types, and Shadow Ball nails Ghost-types that every Vigoroth set struggles with. Focus Punch is a more powerful option to hit Normal-resistant Pokemon on the switch but requires far more prediction than Brick Break, which on the other hand is far less destructive.</p> <p>An Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment let Vigoroth hit as hard as possible. 252 Speed EVs allow Vigoroth to outspeed Jolly Hitmonchan. This set relies significantly more on prediction than other Vigoroth sets, but this is to be expected when equipping a Choice Band. As usual, Vigoroth appreciates Pokemon that can remove its normal counters of Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-types while also enjoying teammates that appreciate its breaking power. In particular, another Normal-type sweeper such as Raticate loves having Vigoroth as a wallbreaking partner, allowing the pair to overwhelm the opposition.</p>"
      },
      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<p>The main boon of this set is Focus Punch, which allows Vigoroth to deal with many of its conventional checks that are not Ghost type, such as Mawile, Relicanth, and other Steel- and Rock-types. Substitute eases prediction and helps to safely utilize Focus Punch. Bulk Up is a useful boosting tool to increase Vigoroth's power and bulk. Flail has the potential to be a powerful STAB attack but often requires ideal scenarios to work properly. Shadow Ball lets Vigoroth hit pesky Ghost-types like Haunter and Shedinja. Body Slam is a more consistent option that is useful for fishing for paralysis as well as solid damage output without the needed setup or prediction with using Focus Punch.</p> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment with an Adamant nature allows Vigoroth to hit as hard as possible while still outspeeding Hitmonchan. Salac Berry is the preferred item due to its ability to boost Vigoroth's Speed in a pinch, but Leftovers can be used for more longevity. Note that Leftovers should never be used in combination with Flail. Vigoroth needs Pokemon that deal with Ghost-types, as they are most likely a hard stop to Vigoroth. If using Flail, Rapid Spin support from Pokemon like Hitmonchan and Wartortle is required to ensure that the move works optimally. This set works nicely as a lure for Steel- and Rock-types to open a sweep for a partner such as Raticate and Pidgeot which will then have free range to nail the opponent with their strong Normal-type STAB attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Taunt Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Taunt is an excellent move for preventing status and entry hazards and allows Vigoroth to shut down Pokemon like Roselia, Venomoth, and Glalie. Return is a solid STAB move with consistent damage, and Earthquake hits Steel- and Rock-types that resist Return. Shadow Ball hits Ghost-types, while Encore is a very useful option that locks setup users into their setup move and generally allows more flexibility at the cost of being completely walled by Ghost-types. Toxic is another viable move for this set to help wear down foes. Slack Off can be run in the last slot in order to give Vigoroth a more useful long-term purpose in a match, enabling it to wear down many Pokemon while having recovery of its own.</p> <p>This set is optimal as a lead, having very few bad matchups against most of the common leads seen in the tier. A Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment are required for Vigoroth to outspeed common Glalie leads. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack to allow for Vigoroth to have an offensive presence as well. Vigoroth retains excellent stallbreaking potential with Taunt and Encore with this set, and they can be used to their full effect in stall matchups. Vigoroth should not riskily switch into a potential Toxic, which would completely neuter it. In case of emergency, Vigoroth does appreciate cleric support from teammates like Roselia and Chimecho. Leftovers is the preferred item for its consistent and reliable recovery.</p>"

  "Loudred": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite having one of the best movepools in the game, Loudred is a pretty horrible choice in NU. It has mildly decent mixed attacking stats, but a lack of bulk, terrible typing, and utterly mediocre Speed make it extremely difficult to use. However, Loudred finds a singular redeeming quality in its ability, Soundproof, which allows it to block Roar from phazers like Wailord and Flareon. This, in combination with its workable movepool, makes Loudred a niche, but decent choice for a recipient of a Baton Pass chain. However, Octillery's existence makes Loudred's place in the metagame questionable, as better attacking stats and an ability that can also block Whirlwind are often more useful.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ice Beam can be used to hit Flying-types hard, particularly Golbat and Tropius, which can run Whirlwind and still force Loudred out. Endure and either a Salac or Liechi Berry could be used to get a last-ditch boost but leaves Loudred even more vulnerable to priority.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Whirlwind, while not common, is not blocked by Soundproof and can still remove Loudred from play, effectively winning the matchup singlehandedly if played correctly. The most effective way of stopping Loudred is by breaking the Baton Pass chain. Moves like Taunt and Encore, and powerful setup sweepers or breakers can shut down a Baton Pass chain so that Loudred cannot have an opportunity to win. Common users of these moves include Glalie, Vigoroth, Abra, and Pikachu, as well as some viable others that can end the Baton Pass strategy with ease. Hitmonchan's Mach Punch will do a monstrous amount of damage to Loudred because of its low defensive prowess, as a Choice Band-boosted one can OHKO Loudred if it doesn't have Defense boosts passed to it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass Recipient": {
        "description": "<p>Loudred doesn't have much over Octillery in the role of Baton Pass receiver apart from its typing and being a slightly better physical attacker thanks to its access to Normal STAB moves; Octillery boasts higher stats all around, making it the better receiver in most cases. Return is STAB boosted and hits decently hard off base 71 Attack, especially if boosted. Shadow Ball allows Loudred to hit Ghost-types such as Haunter, which are immune to Return. Earthquake hits Steel-types and Rock-types like Metang, Relicanth, and Sudowoodo. Fire Blast is a powerful attack that hits certain Pokemon harder than Loudred's other moves, such as Mawile and Tangela. Flamethrower is an alternative option that doesn't miss, although it does less damage. Substitute can be used to protect Loudred from status and ease prediction, as well as being able to possibly take hits if Loudred has been passed defensive boosts. It can also protect Loudred from Hitmonchan's Mach Punch if set up before it comes in.</p> <p>252 Attack EVs along with a positive nature make sure that Loudred can hit its foes as hard as possible. 140 EVs are placed into Speed so that Loudred can outspeed uninvested base 65s like Chimecho without a Speed boost, as well as the entire metagame at +2. 16 EVs are placed into Special Attack to ensure that Loudred OHKOes Tangela with Fire Blast and avoids being put to sleep, and the rest of the EVs are placed into HP to marginally increase Loudred's bulk. Leftovers is the item of choice, allowing Loudred to passively recover damage racked up from chip and opposing attacks, especially if running Substitute. Soundproof is the whole point of using Loudred, as its immunity to Roar makes it usable as a recipient of a Baton Pass chain. As a physically-based receiver, Loudred needs Swords Dance boosts on the Baton Pass chain, which can be provided by Mawile, Beedrill, and Ledian. Other good members to include on the chain include Ariados, Huntail, and Togetic.</p>"

  "Nosepass": {
    "overview": "<p>Nosepass bears the curse of having an extremely coveted ability that it can't make use of in Magnet Pull, with the reason being that the very Steel-types Nosepass is trying to trap hit it super effectively. Nosepass is able to successfully trap and 2HKO Mawile, however, using a combination of Taunt, Block, and Fire Punch to do so. This doesn't amount to anything, though, as applying offensive pressure on Mawile using Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Flareon or even bringing a defensive Pokemon that resists its attacks such as Wailord or Tangela is a much more reliable strategy. Ultimately, Nosepass is utterly atrocious and should be passed up in favor of a more viable Rock-type or Mawile check.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Defense Curl and Rollout together can make Nosepass a somewhat threatening late-game sweeper. However, Shuckle outclasses Nosepass in this role, as it has exceedingly high bulk and can invest its EVs fully in Attack, unlike Nosepass, which would have to devote all of its EVs into HP and Special Defense. A set utilizing Rest, Sleep Talk, Earthquake, and Rock Slide may seem alright at first, but again Nosepass is outclassed, this time by Relicanth. While Nosepass isn't a Water-type and doesn't have any 4x weaknesses unlike Relicanth, this isn't enough of a niche to warrant its use, especially considering the steep drop in overall bulk.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Water-types such as Huntail, Dewgong, and Wailord can drown Nosepass out with a STAB Surf. Nosepass is also passive enough for Huntail to reliably set up Rain Dance against and attempt to sweep. Grass-types such as Tangela and Bellossom take Nosepass out with a STAB Solar Beam, although if they set up Sunny Day, they must be wary of a sun-boosted Fire Punch. Hitmonchan can switch into any of Nosepass's attacks bar Explosion and threaten it out with a super effective Sky Uppercut. Pokemon with Rock / Ground typing such as Pupitar and Graveler resist all of Fire Punch, Hidden Power Rock, and Explosion and can demolish Nosepass with Earthquake. Even with Taunt, Pupitar can use Nosepass as setup fodder with Dragon Dance. Even though it's also a Steel-type that Nosepass can trap, Metang possesses overall better bulk than Mawile and also has Meteor Mash, which threatens to OHKO Nosepass after one layer of Spikes.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trapper": {
        "description": "<p>Taunt stops defensive Seismic Toss variants of Mawile from using Baton Pass to escape Nosepass. Because Mawile's Defense is higher than its Special Defense, Fire Punch is the best option for Nosepass to hit Mawile with and 2HKO it. Block prevents non-Steel-type Pokemon from double switching in and out of Taunt. Block can also be Baton Passed by Mawile so that something else becomes trapped. Alternatively, Hidden Power Rock is Nosepass's most reliable STAB move and hits Pokemon such as Pidgeot and Murkrow super effectively. Explosion, although powered down by Nosepass's Timid nature, is still strong enough to OHKO Roselia and severely dents Chimecho.</p> <p>Magnet Pull is Nosepass's only defining feature, differentiating itself from other Rock-types with its ability to trap opposing Steel-types. Maximum Speed EVs alongside a Timid nature allow Nosepass to outspeed uninvested base 60s while also outspeeding most standard 128 Speed Mawile and defensive Pokemon such as Roselia and Chimecho that it can use Explosion on. Maximum Special Attack EVs ensure that Nosepass 2HKOes Mawile with Fire Punch. Leftovers and the remaining 4 Defense EVs allow Nosepass to more adequately take two Hidden Power Steels from Mawile. Poison-types such as Arbok appreciate Mawile being removed, as they can spam STAB Sludge Bomb more freely, making them good teammates for Nosepass. Nosepass and Poison-types share a weakness to Ground, so Pokemon that have the Flying typing such as Pidgeot can provide the necessary Ground-type immunity while also resisting Grass for Nosepass. Chimecho is another great example, utilizing Levitate to provide a switch-in for Ground-types and adding a Psychic-type resistance for Arbok. Be sure to not reveal Nosepass too early; if Nosepass is revealed too early, Mawile will keep double switching out every time it is brought in, and Nosepass will lose all momentum in the process. While its defense stats might suggest otherwise, Nosepass is exceedingly frail and must be played carefully. Mawile can very easily 2HKO Nosepass with two Hidden Power Steels. Once trapped, Nosepass needs to predict correctly whether Mawile is going to attack, Taunt, or Baton Pass. Hopefully, by the time you bring Nosepass into Mawile, you will know what set it is running so that you can more easily predict around it.</p>"

Sableye can pivot into multiple wallbreakers like Hitmonchan, Haunter, and Raticate while checking certain setup sweepers like Chimecho and Abra, all the while staying healthy with Recover. As a result, Sableye fits on a plethora of archetypes and is usually fairly easy to justify using. However, it does have a couple flaws, mainly its vulnerability to passive damage like Spikes and Toxic poison. The latter is especially problematic, as certain Pokemon it checks, such as Hitmonchan and Chimecho, run Toxic in part because of it. Additionally, because Sableye's defenses aren't particularly amazing, it can be very easy to overwhelm with certain attackers like special Flareon and Choice Band Hitmonchan.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sableye can make use of Taunt and Speed investment to better deal with Pokemon like defensive Relicanth, Mawile, Roselia, and Whiscash, although the move can be hard to fit over Sableye's other options. Protect helps Sableye immensely in scouting for potential lure sets like Toxic Hitmonchan as well as strong Choice Band users like Murkrow, Relicanth, and Hitmonchan. However, it is extremely difficult to fit on sets and thus sees limited use. Fire Punch can be run on Sableye's Calm Mind set over Rest to target Metang as well as Dark-resistant Pokemon like Hitmonchan, Cacturne, and Mawile. It also allows Sableye to deal substantial extra damage to Roselia, Tropius, and Bellossom. However, Sableye is already extremely vulnerable to Toxic, and dropping Rest means this set is no longer an exception to that.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers: Even if Sableye has Special Defense investment, it is still capable of being overwhelmed by certain special attackers like Flareon, Pikachu, Octillery, and Wailord.

Spikes pose similar problems, forcing Sableye to use Recover more often and give up momentum to the opposing team.</p> <p><strong>Certain Setup Sweepers: Taunt Vigoroth doesn't have to fear being badly poisoned by Sableye's Toxic and completely shuts down Calm Mind variants, whereas Pupitar's Shed Skin helps against it as well.

Other clerics like Roselia and Chimecho also pair well with Sableye and can check certain special attackers.

However, Lairon comes with awful, terrible, horrible 4x weaknesses to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, which are found on virtually all Choice Band users' sets, diminishing its overall effectiveness as a physical wall, which is compounded by its rather low Special Defense stat. Ultimately, Lairon is a subpar choice in the metagame but a neat Pokemon to use regardless if you want a super solid switch-in to Normal-, Flying-, Ghost-, and Rock-type attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Lairon has a pretty shallow movepool outside of the recommended sets above. Body Slam is a neat alternative that can help spread paralysis to allow a slow teammate like Octillery to sweep late-game. Endeavor is available but is hard to use and doesn't accomplish much for Lairon in the long run. Finally, Rock Tomb is an OK move when used with some Speed investment to allow Lairon or another teammate to get the jump on the foe. However, Lairon has trouble making use of it itself due to its low Speed and lack of very strong STAB attacks.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Hitmonchan is the best check and counter to Lairon, as it really only fears a Choice Band-boosted Double-Edge and can threaten Lairon with a quick OHKO with either Sky Uppercut or Earthquake in return. From there, really any Fighting- or Ground-type attack will remove Lairon from of the game, even weak, non-STAB Hidden Powers. Water-types, particularly Relicanth, Huntail, and Whiscash, have an easy time of switching in and disposing of Lairon. Tangela can easily switch in, tank anything Lairon can throw at it, and remove it with its strong STAB Grass-type moves. Mawile almost completely walls all that Lairon can throw at it, even being immune to Toxic, and can threaten it in return with Focus Punch. Piloswine doesn't get in as safely as other checks but easily annihilates Lairon with Earthquake. Finally, while Diglett can't switch in easily, it can trap and cleanly OHKO Lairon with its own Earthquake.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Lairon's typing and huge base Defense stat mean that it doesn't even need any investment in order to wall the physical attacks it needs to. Therefore, its Special Defense is invested to make use of the resistances it has, allowing it to check certain special attackers like Haunter, Chimecho, and Venomoth effectively. Hidden Power Rock or Hidden Power Steel is used as a STAB move depending on which Pokemon you'd like to target; Hidden Power Rock gets better super effective coverage, while Hidden Power Steel hits Hitmonchan and Ground-types neutrally, the latter of which are common switch-ins to Lairon.</p> <p>Toxic is the best way Lairon can spread damage around on the opponent's team considering Poison-types are unlikely to switch into it. Roar phazes the foe, prevents setup, exposes more Pokemon to Toxic damage, and racks up Spikes damage. Protect can be used in the last slot to further build up Toxic damage, scout for Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, and get some Leftovers recovery. However, Earthquake is a nice safety move to have that generally prevents Lairon from getting walled by a few Pokemon its STAB coverage misses out on, namely Water-types if using Hidden Power Steel and Ground-types if using Hidden Power Rock.</p> <p>A physically defensive EV spread can be run, as it decreases the damage from Hidden Power Ground from the likes of Choice Band Murkrow and Pidgeot pretty substantially, but it won't prevent Hidden Power or any Ground- or Fighting-type attack from 2HKOing Lairon, which is why the specially defensive EV spread is recommended. RestTalk can be used to greatly increase Lairon's longevity; however, due to Lairon's susceptibility to being easily OHKOed by common moves and the great utility of both Roar and Protect, it's hard to justify using it over the presented set. Both Rock Slide and Hidden Power Steel can be used on this set to give Lairon a bit more coverage, but it's largely unneeded and Protect is still an overall better choice considering the large number of Choice Band users in the tier.</p> <p>A switch-in to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks is needed for this set to be effective, making Pelipper, Tangela, and Chimecho valued teammates. Lairon can check a myriad of special attackers, but it's super weak to Water-type attacks and some special attackers can still break through, making special walls like Kecleon, Lickitung, and Bellossom great teammates. Spikes support is pretty crucial to this set's success, making Glalie, Cacturne, or particularly Roselia a needed teammate.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thanks to a great base 90 Attack stat, a typing that allows some free switches, and decent coverage, a Choice Band set is very viable. Lairon's Steel typing gives it a bit of a niche over the other Rock-types in the tier, making it a bit less susceptible to the special attackers they are normally forced to switch out of like Chimecho, Roselia, and Haunter. Lairon also still completely walls the physical attackers it needs to. Hidden Power Rock and Iron Tail are the recommended STAB moves due to the former's reliability and the latter's sheer power. However, if you're uncomfortable using Iron Tail due to its accuracy, Rock Slide can be used over Hidden Power Rock and Hidden Power Steel can be used over Iron Tail. Earthquake and Double-Edge complete the set's coverage, with Double-Edge chosen in the last slot over Return thanks to the lack of recoil due to Rock Head.</p> <p>Some Speed EVs can be run to let Lairon outpace minimum Speed base 50s; however, Lairon needs all the bulk it can get in order to tank special attacks like Chimecho's Psychic. A switch-in to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks is needed for this set to be effective, making Pelipper, defensive Tangela, and Whiscash valued teammates. Lairon is extremely weak to most special attackers with this set even with its many resistances. Kecleon, Dewgong, and Lickitung are good specially defensive teammates that can take on a large portion of the special attackers in the tier, though they stack a major weakness to Hitmonchan with Lairon. Swalot is another option to switch into special attackers, and it can also take on the likes of Hitmonchan very well, though it too stacks a weakness to Ground-type attacks. An offensively inclined teammate like your own Hitmonchan is recommended, as Lairon effectively walls a number of Pokemon that normally force Hitmonchan out, particularly Pidgeot, Murkrow, and Raticate.</p>"

Roselia's access to utility in Synthesis and Stun Spore alongside its ability Natural Cure helps make it rather self-sufficient; while other defensive Pokemon may require team support to function at their peak, Roselia can keep itself healthy while preventing its checks from easily taking advantage of it on predicted uses of Spikes. Unfortunately, Roselia has a rather poor defensive typing that leaves it vulnerable to several common attackers, including Flareon, Chimecho, and Golbat. Roselia also struggles to keep Spikes up on its own, since Hitmonchan easily switches into it and threatens heavy damage.</p>",

Toxic is a way to cripple Flareon and Torkoal by targeting their longevity, and it aids Roselia against bulky setup sweepers like Chimecho and Vigoroth. Leech Seed can cripple Baton Pass chains and provides Roselia with extra healing, potentially letting it set another layer of Spikes.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Hitmonchan: Hitmonchan's combination of power and special bulk lets it easily switch into Roselia and threaten it with heavy damage, giving it an opportunity to remove Spikes with Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types like Haunter, Golbat, and Arbok don't appreciate being paralyzed, but they resist Grass and can also switch in on predicted uses of Spikes to force Roselia out.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Chimecho poses a great threat to Roselia, since it can remove paralysis with Heal Bell and set up in Roselia's face with Calm Mind. Metang is also problematic, since its STAB Meteor Mash threatens to outright remove Roselia with minor chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Murkrow and Pidgeot can easily OHKO Roselia with their STAB Flying-type attacks, while Tropius can use non-Hidden Power Fire variants as setup fodder with Substitute and Swords Dance.

Synthesis keeps Roselia healthy, letting it continue setting Spikes and checking Pokemon like Huntail and Plusle. Giga Drain helps Roselia immensely against offensive Wailord and Huntail, healing it for a great amount and letting it take multiple Ice Beams, although Hidden Power Grass works on and against bulkier teams due to its greater PP. Stun Spore dissuades Flying-types like Pidgeot and Murkrow as well as Haunter from switching into Roselia while it sets Spikes. Alternatively, Aromatherapy turns Roselia into a cleric and lets it support other bulky teammates by healing them of poison. Hidden Power Fire targets Steel- and Grass-types like Metang, Mawile, Bellossom, and Tropius as well as Glalie. 20 Defense EVs prevent Choice Band Pidgeot's Aerial Ace from OHKOing Roselia, while the remaining EVs go into special bulk to improve its matchup against foes like Wailord and Pikachu.</p> <p>It's ideal to set Spikes as early as possible; although Roselia will have multiple opportunities to each game thanks to Synthesis keeping it healthy, the chip damage from Spikes helps create and press advantages greatly. Due to Roselia's average bulk, it must be careful of coverage moves like Wailord's Ice Beam; be sure to monitor Roselia's health carefully so that it isn't put in range of a 2HKO from such attacks. Several Pokemon that can take advantage of Roselia detest being paralyzed; using Stun Spore on a predicted switch is generally a low-drawback play, so long as setting Spikes isn't necessary.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Checks to Hitmonchan are mandatory to pair alongside Roselia, as it's unable to prevent Hitmonchan from switching into it and removing its Spikes with Rapid Spin. Sableye and Chimecho are great partners for this reason, and they also check other Pokemon that threaten Roselia such as Haunter, Golbat, and Chimecho. In return, Roselia checks certain offensive Water-types like Wailord, Huntail, and Seadra. Wallbreakers and late-game sweepers like Metang, Haunter, and Wailord greatly benefit from Roselia's Spikes; furthermore, Metang and Wailord enjoy Stun Spore support, since they're rather slow. Backup checks to special attackers, like Lickitung and Dewgong, are helpful, since Roselia's bulk can lead to it folding to strong, super effective coverage moves.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Swalot has some of the best defenses in the NU tier and only really loses the title of \"best defensive Pokemon\" to Sableye, which hinges largely on the latter's access to Recover. Unfortunately, that also means that Swalot's viability in the tier is almost invalidated, despite it sporting way better base stats and a much more colorful movepool. Even though Swalot's somewhat outclassed, its resistance to Fighting and relatively few weaknesses across the board make it a decent choice for balanced defensive teams. By being a great check to Hitmonchan, disrupting stall tactics by the likes of Sableye and Roselia, and packing an atom bomb in Explosion, Swalot performs amicably in the tier and has a place on balanced teams that need to condense roles into a couple of Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Luckily for Swalot, its usable movepool is actually quite expansive. A specially attacking tank set is definitely viable, as Swalot has a decent base 73 Special Attack and a very nice special movepool with Ice Beam, Thunder Punch, Fire Punch, and Hidden Power Grass; the surprise moves Counter and Explosion can still make an appearance here too. A Choice Band set can also be done, as a Choice Band-boosted Explosion is absolutely ridiculous, and STAB Sludge Bomb is going to leave a huge mark in targets like Chimecho.</p> <p>As for individual moves, Pain Split is Swalot's best chance at reliable recovery outside of Rest, but it's pretty hard to use considering Swalot's massive HP stat. Swalot gets both Sunny Day and Rain Dance; it can use either to good effect and get a weather sweeper in for free with Explosion. Sing can be used to put a target to sleep, but its accuracy sucks and Yawn is about as effective overall. A combination of Acid Armor and Amnesia can make Swalot nigh-impenetrable save for a critical hit, but they do nothing to prevent the opponent from setting up on Swalot as usual.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best general switch-ins to Swalot are Chimecho and Haunter, the latter being probably better since it is immune to Explosion and 4x resists Sludge Bomb. Sableye is another great switch-in for the same reasons and can set up Calm Mind in front of Swalot, though it will need to watch out for Toxic. Otherwise, Steel-types like Mawile and Metang are probably the safest switch-ins to Swalot, as they resist Ice Beam and Explosion and are immune to Toxic. In general, anything with Earthquake like Piloswine, Graveler, Relicanth, or Whiscash will be effective against Swalot, though they must be prepared for Counter. In the same vein, Diglett can trap and nail Swalot with a Choice Band-boosted Earthquake, coming close to OHKOing the specially defensive set, but it will be only doing 68% at most to the physically defensive set. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Pupitar and Bulk Up Vigoroth definitely give Swalot some problems as well. Finally, immediately strong special or physical attackers like Rain Dance Huntail, Choice Band Kingler, and Abra will be able to plow through Swalot without many issues.</p>",

It's also one of the few Pokemon that's not 2HKOed by Rain Dance Huntail, assuming it is running Surf over Hydro Pump; even if things go south, Swalot can Explode on it as well. Physical attacks like Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Ground are preferred with a specially defensive spread as most special attackers tend to have a lower Defense stat, which is particularly true of most of the Grass-types save for Tangela.</p> <p>Encore can be used over Hidden Power Ground to lock the foe into a useless move like Toxic to force switches. Toxic is the best option in the third slot to allow Swalot to spread damage around defensive teams, though it may be a bit redundant with the poison chance from Sludge Bomb. Yawn can be used to force switches and works super well with Spikes on the opponent's side of the field. Shadow Ball is another good option for the third slot to complete Swalot's neutral coverage with Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Ground, destroy Haunter, and land a good hit on Chimecho without having to resort to Explosion. The last slot goes to Explosion, which gives Swalot a nearly guaranteed way to take out the foe and ensures the opponent can't use Swalot as setup bait.</p> <p>Specially defensive Swalot is one of, if not the, best counters to Grass-types in the tier, due largely to its massive bulk, resistance to both Grass and Poison, and Liquid Ooze ability, the latter of which punishes the use of Leech Seed. Maximum Special Defense is the preferred EV spread to allow Swalot the best possible chance of tanking an attack from Huntail and being able to retaliate in some manner.</p> <p>Special attacks like Ice Beam and Thunder Punch can be used over Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Ground, and doing so comes with the benefit of being able to hit Tangela, Huntail, and Seadra super effectively while targeting their weaker defensive stat, but the stronger hits on most other special attackers are more desired. Chimecho and Haunter are probably the safest switches into Swalot, though the former needs to be really careful of Explosion and Swalot's specially defensive set may just be luring it in for that exact reason. Regardless, Pokemon that can take them on like Kecleon and Murkrow can be used to switch into and KO them.</p> <p>Steel- and Rock-types have a harder time consistently switching into Hidden Power Ground, but they have an almost free switch into Sludge Bomb, meaning physically defensive Pokemon like Wailord and Mawile can be good teammates to take them on. Physically defensive Lickitung makes a good teammate in particular, as Swalot can easily switch into most Hitmonchan variants for it and Lickitung takes on most other physical attackers for Swalot in return.</p>"

With this set, Swalot becomes one of the best counters to Hitmonchan, giving it an almost assured spot on many defensive teams if Sableye doesn't fit anyway. Ice Beam is used as the general attacking move, as it hits the Ground-types looking to switch into Swalot for super effective or neutral damage and nails the Flying- and Grass-types that Swalot counters super effectively. Counter is a major move that sets Swalot apart from other defensive Pokemon like Chimecho and Sableye, giving it a tool to take a powerful physical attack and eliminate the attacker in one turn.</p> <p>Toxic is the best option in the third slot to allow Swalot to spread damage around defensive teams and force Chimecho to switch out or use Heal Bell or Rest. Yawn can be used to force switches, which works extra well with Spikes on the opponent's side of the field. Thunder Punch is another option for this slot to give Swalot amazing neutral coverage and let it hit the Water-types that can otherwise tank Ice Beam super effectively. The last slot goes to Explosion, which gives Swalot another tool to take out the foe and is a great way to ensure that the opponent can't use Swalot as setup bait for a sweeper like Vigoroth.</p> <p>A fully physically defensive EV spread gives Swalot the ability to counter physical threats as well as possible, with a Relaxed nature used because Swalot's Speed is largely unimportant and it doesn't weaken the power of Ice Beam or Explosion. Physical attacks such as Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Ground can be used over Ice Beam and Thunder Punch, but most of the physical threats that Swalot can counter have lower Special Defense (the major exception being Hitmonchan). Running a physical move also allows Swalot to run a neutral Speed nature, which can sometimes come in handy to get the Explosion off against a defensive Pokemon like Kecleon before getting hit.</p> <p>Chimecho is probably the best immediate safe switch-in to Swalot, as it destroys Swalot with its STAB Psychic, but it really needs to be wary of Explosion. Haunter with Psychic is probably a better switch-in to Swalot for this reason alone, though it takes far more damage from Ice Beam than Chimecho does. Still, these two Pokemon and others like Venomoth can be kind of threatening for Swalot, making specially defensive Pokemon like Kecleon and Lickitung good teammates that can form an almost impenetrable defensive core together with Swalot.</p> <p>Steel-types like Mawile and Metang are immune to Toxic and resist Ice Beam and Explosion, but they need to watch out for Counter. Mawile with Substitute, however, is particularly threatening for Swalot, and may force it to use Explosion or risk having it set up Swords Dance and Baton Passing to a teammate. Water- and Fire-types make good teammates for Swalot for this reason, Flareon in particular because it can pass Wish to Swalot on top of checking Mawile.</p> <p>Rock-types not weak to Ice Beam like Sudowoodo and Relicanth can nail Swalot super effectively with Earthquake and resist Explosion, though they too have to be extremely wary of Counter. A Grass-type like Bellossom or Tangela can be a good teammate to have to switch into Earthquake anyway, and they enjoy having Swalot around to tank attacks from Murkrow and Pidgeot.</p>"

Amazing mixed bulk, immunity to Toxic, and great longevity provided by RestTalk make this set extremely hard to take out, especially for balanced defensive teams. Ice Beam is Swalot's best general attacking move, as it sports good power and has no immunities, although Sludge Bomb can be used instead, as it has a good poison chance and hits slightly harder on neutral targets, in particular Hitmonchan, thanks to STAB, though at the cost of Swalot being completely walled by Steel-types if not also running Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p>Toxic pairs best with Ice Beam to spread as much residual damage as possible and allows Swalot to outstall certain threats like Sableye and Flareon, which cannot do much in return thanks to Swalot's immunity to Toxic. Sludge Bomb + Toxic may be kind of redundant and leaves Swalot completely exposed to Steel-types and Rock-types with Substitute, meaning Hidden Power Ground is the better move to run when using Sludge Bomb. Yawn is a viable third option for the second slot, but it doesn't really allow Swalot to outstall other Pokemon except for the chance to put Chimecho or Lickitung with Heal Bell to sleep.</p> <p>The EV spread and nature let Swalot avoid being 3HKOed by Timid Plusle's Thunderbolt and any of Choice Band Hitmonchan's attacks aside from Earthquake. There are a lot of moves that can be used in the first and second slots not mentioned above, and they depend largely on what your team needs. Counter is the most prominent and can ensure that Choice Band attackers think twice before trying to take out Swalot.</p> <p>Spikes are a near must with this set, meaning Roselia and Glalie are good teammates to consider. Chimecho is particularly dangerous for this set, as it can set up Calm Mind or use Heal Bell in front of Swalot without it being able to do much in return. Haunter also doesn't care for much of anything Swalot does with this set. Lickitung, Sableye, or an offensive check like Murkrow or Kecleon is an almost required teammate due to this fact. Steel-, Ground-, and Rock-types have an easier time with this set as well, as they don't need to really watch out for Counter, Explosion, or Hidden Power Ground in most cases. Defensive teammates like Pelipper and Relicanth or offensive checks like Hitmonchan are therefore needed to ensure that Swalot isn't just complete setup bait for these Pokemon.</p>"

Although Wailord's Speed tier isn't amazing, with minimal investment it can still outspeed many defensive threats such as Roselia, Flareon, and Chimecho, further improving its offensive potency. While Wailord may face slight competition with Dewgong as a bulky Water-type due to the latter's access to Encore and comparable defensive capabilities, Wailord's lack of weaknesses to Fighting and Rock combined with better offensive capabilities generally leave it as the superior choice. However, Wailord can be heavily pressured by wallbreakers like Haunter, Pikachu, and physical Flareon and is extremely passive if not invested in its offenses.

Wailord can run Toxic over Roar on its defensive set to slightly make up for passivity issues, but it's then complete setup fodder for Heal Bell + Calm Mind Chimecho and unable to do much versus Baton Pass teams. Water Spout may seem appealing for its great power when Wailord's at full health, 2HKOing Bulk Up Vigoroth, Lickitung after one layer of Spikes, and specially defensive Kecleon after three layers of Spikes.

Ice Beam 2HKOes Roselia most of the time and prevents other Grass-types like Bellossom and Cacturne from taking advantage of Wailord.

Self-Destruct lets Wailord lure in and remove special walls like Kecleon and Lickitung, as well as take out bulky Water-types like Dewgong and opposing Wailord more reliably. 44 Speed EVs let Wailord outspeed base 65 Pokemon like Roselia, Flareon, and Chimecho, with the remaining EVs making Wailord stronger and more capable of checking Pokemon like special Flareon and Huntail. Wailord can also choose to hit different Speed benchmarks, with outspeeding Dewgong, Bellossom, and Pupitar being notable options. If you're using Wailord as a lead, running 216 Speed EVs is an option to outspeed lead Choice Band Relicanth. A Mild nature can be used over Modest if weakening Self-Destruct's power isn't wanted.

It's imperative to catch Pokemon like Roselia and Dewgong on the switch with Ice Beam and Hidden Power Electric so Wailord can have an easier time using its STAB attack later in the game. Getting Wailord onto the field safely is also important so it can wallbreak. Bring it in versus Pokemon like special Crawdaunt, Seadra, and special Flareon that don't pose a great threat to it. Additionally, don't haphazardly use Self-Destruct, especially if the opponent hasn't revealed their full team yet, as this risks having a Steel- or Ghost-type come in on it.

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Seismic Toss allows you to focus on those crappy Defenses. Teeter Dance can get a few turns to set up, but Hypnosis is still better. Counter is fairly useful though, as it's likely an instant KO if Spinda can survive the hit.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>Max Speed and a +Speed nature (Jolly or Timid depending on your offensive move) is preferred as Spinda outspeeds Breloom this way and can Substitute before Spore. Focus on HP and Defenses on the Baton Passing set; max Attack on the Choice Band set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Just attack it directly or predict and Substitute against its Hypnosis (it might have Snatch and outpredict you, though).

Basically, Hypnosis something, Calm Mind up as fast as you can, then Baton Pass the boosts along with a Salac boost if you're lucky. Thunder Punch Skarmory / Suicune if they come to phaze Spinda; it won't do shit to Suicune, but I guess it can hurt Skarmory quite a lot if it tries to do that again / was damaged before.

Or anything that isn't Spinda. With base 60 Attack, Spinda isn't going to do much, but your opponent probably won't bother switching against it, so you can surprise something with a STAB Choice Band Double-Edge, as well as Tricking Choice Band off to something that comes in to set up such as Skarmory.</p>"}

  "Cacturne": {
    "overview": "<p>The immediate thing to notice about Cacturne is its access to Spikes. It is one of only three usable Spikers available in NU, meaning it has a very secure niche within the tier. On top of that, it has amazing mixed attacking stats and a decent offensive typing. With that said, it doesn't have a solid STAB move that can make use of its great attacking stats. What's more, it is very slow, extremely frail, and has an awful defensive typing in a tier dominated by Fighting-, Poison-, and Flying-types. Still, it has a lot of perks over Glalie and Roselia, and since Spikes is the only form of entry hazards in NU, you'll probably make a team with Cacturne on it at some point.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Band set and a Swords Dance set are both possible, but Cacturne's physical coverage is too lacking outside of Focus Punch and Hidden Power Ghost to really make use of Choice Band, and Cacturne isn't quite quick enough to sweep with Swords Dance. Counter is a good option for surprising an opponent using a non-super effective STAB move, but without Focus Sash in ADV it's really hard to pull off with Cacturne's frailty. Finally, Toxic and GrassWhistle are options as status moves, but Leech Seed or Encore will generally be more useful than either of those two.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Murkrow has an exceptionally easy time switching into Cacturne, as it resists both of Cacturne's STAB moves, resists Hidden Power Ghost, only really fears Thunder Punch or Focus Punch, and immediately threatens Cacturne with Drill Peck. Pidgeot can similarly switch in and threaten Cacturne with Aerial Ace, but it can't switch in quite as safely as Murkrow. Hitmonchan easily annihilates Cacturne with Sky Uppercut and resists Hidden Power Dark; it even spins away Cacturne's Spikes. Flareon can easily tank anything from the special attacking sets and can eliminate Cacturne with Fire Blast.</p> <p>Defensively, Swalot fears almost nothing from Cacturne and even enjoys switching into Leech Seed because of Liquid Ooze. Venomoth isn't even fazed by Cacturne's Grass-type attacks nor Focus Punch and threatens Cacturne with Sludge Bomb in return. Finally, defensive Bellossom and Roselia both generally beat Cacturne one-on-one due to their significantly higher special bulk and immunity to Leech Seed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>This set combines all of Cacturne's best aspects to get as much mileage out of it as possible. The main reason you'd use Cacturne over Glalie or Roselia as a Spiker is that Cacturne is significantly harder to switch into, and with a wide array of coverage moves available, Cacturne ensures just that with this set. Giga Drain or Needle Arm should be used as Cacturne's primary STAB move. Giga Drain offers passive recovery, which can let Cacturne take on Water- and Rock-types slightly better, while Needle Arm has far more PP and has a chance to flinch the target. Hidden Power Dark is recommended as a secondary STAB move, and Dark-type attacks are hard to come by in the tier, which allows Cacturne to act as one of the few decent checks to Chimecho. However, Hidden Power Psychic can be used instead to nail Hitmonchan looking for a free switch in to spin away Cacturne's Spikes, and it also gets a decent hit on the Poison-types in the tier.</p> <p>Destiny Bond is a great tool for ensuring the opposing Pokemon goes down with Cacturne, and Cacturne is one of the few with access to the move in the tier. As a bonus, it may also scare the opponent into switching the next turn, freeing up time for Cacturne to lay another layer of Spikes. Because Cacturne is rather slow, Destiny Bond is kind of hard to use effectively or consistently, which is why Thunder Punch is also suggested in the last slot. Normally, Murkrow and Pidgeot have a fairly safe switch into Cacturne, but Thunder Punch ensures that that is not the case, OHKOing the former and easily 2HKOing the latter.</p> <p>A Timid nature and maximum Speed investment allow Cacturne to outrun maximum Speed Jolly Pupitar, with the rest of the EVs pumped into Special Attack so that Cacturne hits as hard as possible. A special attacking set is preferred due to Cacturne's STAB types being special. As for other move options, Toxic is a decent option for crippling Hitmonchan and bulkier walls like Lickitung and Kecleon. Different Hidden Powers can be used depending on your team's needs, but Dark and Psychic are by far the most useful.</p> <p>Teams that don't want to use Glalie because of its typing and don't like Roselia because of its physical frailty will really like Cacturne. While it's frail both specially and physically, its resistances allow it to stand up to some attacks the other two cannot. Cacturne fits best on heavy offense teams since it doesn't last long itself but is capable of dishing out a ton of damage. Unfortunately, Hitmonchan probably has the easiest time switching into Cacturne out of the Spikers and can either easily OHKO it with Sky Uppercut or spin away Cacturne's Spikes. To combat Hitmonchan, Haunter and Chimecho are recommended as teammates, and they have decent synergy with Cacturne outside of checking Hitmonchan. Murkrow and Pidgeot easily switch into anything apart from Thunder Punch and threaten to KO Cacturne with their Flying-type STAB moves, making Rock-types like Relicanth and Sudowoodo and Steel-types like Mawile good teammates. Rock-types also make good use of the Spikes Cacturne sets up and lure in bulky Water-types, which Cacturne can then easily switch into and threaten out.</p>"
      },
      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<p>Despite the lack of STAB moves, this is Cacturne's hardest hitting set. Special attacking sets are far more common, and the Pokemon that counter those sets, such as Lickitung and Kecleon, are easily taken out by Focus Punch. Substitute is needed to allow Cacturne to fire off Focus Punch without flinching. Hidden Power Ghost forms perfect coverage with Focus Punch and is needed to hit Haunter and Chimecho. The last slot is mostly filler, but Leech Seed is probably the most useful option because it creates a makeshift SubSeed set, which can push some bulky Pokemon like Kingler into KO range of Focus Punch. However, Destiny Bond is a useful tool for threatening an instant KO against the foe. Both choices are great, and both allow an opportunity to fire off a free Focus Punch by forcing switches.</p> <p>The EV spread is designed to hit as hard as possible while outrunning maximum Speed Modest Huntail. Running a Grass- or Dark-type STAB move in the last slot is an option, but they're pretty weak with an Adamant nature and no investment, even with Cacturne's high Special Attack stat. Other physical move options include Brick Break and Double-Edge for a strong, reliable attack when without a Substitute. Glalie is an ideal teammate for this set, as Cacturne forces a lot of switches between Focus Punch and Leech Seed or Destiny Bond, and Spikes helps capitalize on those forced switches.</p> <p>This set can lure in and take out common switch-ins to Cacturne like Hitmonchan and Murkrow, meaning Pokemon that can sweep with their removal are good teammates. Rock-types, Pupitar in particular, love having Hitmonchan out of the picture. Hitmonchan of your own and Chimecho love having Murkrow and Pidgeot out of the way. This set is probably the best switch-in to Chimecho in the tier, particularly Calm Mind variants, as most don't carry a move that can hit Cacturne effectively, while Cacturne can easily 2HKO Chimecho by targeting its weaker defensive stat. This fact further increases the synergy between Cacturne and Hitmonchan and also makes Cacturne a valued teammate of Poison-types like Haunter and Arbok. Finally, this set is totally walled by Swalot, making Ground-types like Piloswine good teammates as well.</p>"
      },
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set combines Cacturne's good offensive presence and its ability to set Spikes, disrupt the opponent's team, and force switches. In order to get the best out of this set, switch in on a foe using a setup or status move like Reflect and use Encore on it. From there, set up Spikes, or if you can predict what Pokemon your opponent is going to switch to, use the appropriate STAB move. Hidden Power Dark is more useful than Needle Arm for its broader neutral coverage, higher power, and ability to rip apart Chimecho and Haunter. The best options over Needle Arm are Leech Seed and Substitute, both of which best utilize the switches Encore will force and can lead to even more switches by the opponent.</p> <p>The Speed EVs outspeed minimum base 60 Speed Pokemon and max Speed Adamant Sudowoodo as a bonus. The rest of the EVs are placed into HP to give Cacturne a bit of bulk, and Special Attack is maxed out to make use of Cacturne's Special Attack as best as possible. However, the EVs as a whole are pretty flexible, and EVs can be moved from Special Attack or Speed to the defenses to better cushion common attacks Cacturne resists like Earthquake and Surf.</p> <p>As a support Pokemon, this set is less dependent on having teammates that support it, but having teammates that can capitalize on the Spikes Cacturne provides is important. Offensive Pokemon like Pidgeot, Raticate, Hitmonchan, and Vigoroth are good examples of Pokemon that make use of Spikes and enjoy having Cacturne's offensive presence on the team to remove problematic Pokemon like Rock-types and Chimecho. Cacturne also has an easy time switching in on defensive Pokemon like Whiscash and Lickitung and forcing them out with Encore, making it a good partner for Fire-types and special attackers like Plusle.</p>"

  "Seviper": {
    "overview": "<p>Seviper has awesome mixed attacking stats and a fantastic offensive movepool, making it extremely unpredictable and incredibly hard to switch into. Poison is also a nice typing to switch into opposing Pokemon, and an offensive Pokemon that can switch into Choice Band Hitmonchan's STAB attacks is always a plus. Beyond that, though, it doesn't have much going for it. Shed Skin is neat to absorb status from defensive teams, but Seviper is super frail and a bit on the slow side. It languishes at the bottom of the pack for mixed attackers, as it ultimately doesn't offer that much over similar options in Crawdaunt, Cacturne, and Octillery and finds itself wanting either more bulk or more Speed in most battles.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There is a huge variety of combinations of the moves mentioned above that Seviper can run that are certainly doable. Going mixed will always keep your opponent guessing as to what moves Seviper is or isn't using and can definitely lead to some misplays by them. Substitute can be used when going mixed to further ease prediction on Seviper's part, as well as raise the anxiety of your opponent to keep them guessing as to what Seviper is running.</p> <p>Most of Seviper's viable moves were listed above, but there are a couple left worth mentioning. Glare is probably done better by Arbok, but it does give Seviper a tool to use against faster Pokemon thinking they can switch into a predicted attacking move. Taunt allows Seviper to mess with defensive Pokemon like Lickitung and Flareon and prevent them from healing, but overall Seviper is a bit too frail to make very good use of it. Finally, Seviper is one of the few Pokemon in the tier with access to Haze, which could be valuable in preventing a dangerous setup sweeper from sweeping your team.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>In general, Chimecho can tank an attack from Seviper and easily OHKO it back with STAB Psychic; it just needs to be careful of Crunch and Hidden Power Ghost, both of which will leave a huge dent in it. Haunter and Venomoth with Psychic can easily outspeed and OHKO Seviper as well, though the latter needs a layer of Spikes to ensure the KO. Ground-types that can tank a Flamethrower or Giga Drain will easily OHKO Seviper with Earthquake, which admittedly is mostly just Piloswine. Other Pokemon that outspeed with Earthquake will have an easy time with Seviper too, particularly Hitmonchan, Glalie, and Vigoroth. Fire-types have the easiest time with the special attacker set if it lacks Hidden Power Water, but they have a very hard time with the physical sets. Finally, Mawile and Metang need to avoid the special attacker and mixed sets, but they have a very easy time against the Choice Band set as long as they avoid Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>Seviper is incredibly hard to switch into, and this set makes the most of that fact by focusing on smashing through as many walls in the metagame as possible. STAB Sludge Bomb coming off a base 100 Attack stat will dent nearly everything, and it easily OHKOes offensive Bellossom, deals over 50% to 252 HP Kecleon, and will 2HKO specially defensive Lickitung after a layer of Spikes the vast majority of the time. Earthquake smashes Flareon, easily 2HKOes specially defensive Swalot, and thrashes Lairon. Flamethrower OHKOes 252 HP Mawile and Tangela after a layer of Spikes and easily 2HKOes Metang. The last slot goes to a Hidden Power of choice. Hidden Power Grass shreds Relicanth, Whiscash, Graveler, and other Rock-types like Sudowoodo. Hidden Power Ghost is Seviper's best hit on Chimecho and Haunter, but it will miss out on the 2HKO on 252/252+ Chimecho.</p> <p>A Naughty nature with maximum Attack ensures the strongest hit from Sludge Bomb as possible and OHKOes Bellossom after Spikes. The Speed EVs are there to outpace max Speed neutral nature Pupitar and Tropius, as well as the more common max Speed neutral-natured base 50s like Piloswine. The rest is pumped into Special Attack and gives Seviper the ability to OHKO Mawile and Tangela where it needs to.</p> <p>While Seviper has the ability to outspeed most walls in the metagame and deal a good amount of damage to nearly all of them, it finds itself outsped by nearly every other offensive Pokemon in the tier, meaning Seviper will be playing a game of tit for tat almost every battle. In order to make the best use of Seviper, very sturdy defensive partners are a must to allow it to threaten a KO against the opposing Pokemon and have a safe passage out of the battlefield when something faster steps up to the plate. Relicanth, Kecleon, and Torkoal are good examples of Pokemon that can allow this, particularly the former, as it is a hard stop to Pidgeot and Murkrow as well other Choice Band users like Kingler and Raticate. Kecleon is also valuable to almost hard counter Chimecho and Haunter, as they'll likely switch in to OHKO Seviper with Psychic.</p> <p>An offensive teammate to make use of Seviper's ability to wallbreak is a definite must when considering using this set. Huntail is a prime example, particularly because one of the few walls that can stand up to Seviper, Sableye, is an extremely easy setup opportunity and Huntail has no problem blowing past it with Hydro Pump. In return, Seviper severely dents the likes of Kecleon, Lickitung, and Dewgong, even almost 2HKOing the latter with Sludge Bomb, and can lure in Chimecho and cripple it with Hidden Power Ghost. Other good offensive teammates include those that require turns of setup to become threatening, such as Vigoroth, Pupitar, and Kingler.</p>"

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Seviper's incredible coverage and great base 100 Special Attack stat make it a very dangerous special attacker in the tier, despite the lack of STAB moves. Flamethrower blows away Steel-types thinking they're safe switching into Seviper's STAB move, dealing a ton of damage to both Mawile and Metang. Flamethrower also does a number on the Grass- and Bug-types in the tier. Giga Drain annihilates the Ground- and Rock-types that think they can safely nail Seviper with Earthquake. Crunch obliterates Chimecho and Haunter and is Seviper's best hit on Pelipper apart from Hidden Power Electric. The last slot goes to a Hidden Power of choice. Hidden Power Psychic can be used to nail Hitmonchan and opposing Poison-types, while Hidden Power Water can be used to get a great hit on Lairon, Magcargo, and Flareon. Hidden Power Ice is worth considering as well for its super effective hit on Flying-types and Shelgon.</p> <p>A Modest nature and maximum Speed are run to give Seviper as much power as possible while retaining the ability to Speed tie with neutral-natured max Speed Flareon and Chimecho as well as outspeed Jolly Pupitar. Timid is definitely an option to outrun Timid Tangela and minimum Speed Dewgong, but considering the overall low Base Power of Seviper's moves and the lack of STAB, Modest is generally better to get as many KOs as possible.</p> <p>Rest can be run in the last slot, as Shed Skin has a high chance of waking Seviper up early, but it's unreliable and Seviper can't waste any turns sleeping due to its frailty. That said, Shed Skin is a reason enough to boldly switch Seviper into defensive Grass-types for its chance to absorb Sleep Powder or Stun Spore and be able to shrug it off.</p> <p>This set ravages slow defensive teams, but it has a couple of hard stops, most notably special walls like Kecleon, Swalot, Flareon, and Sableye. Because of this, Hitmonchan and other strong physical wallbreakers like Vigoroth and Pupitar make good teammates. Seviper is also very prone to being revenge killed, particularly from the likes of Choice Band Murkrow, which can OHKO it after a layer of Spikes, and other strong attackers like Haunter, which also OHKOes with Psychic. Due to this, hefty defensive backbones that can keep offensive momentum like Choice Band Relicanth and SubPunch Kecleon make excellent teammates. Chimecho also makes a good partner to take on the likes of Haunter and Hitmonchan looking to revenge kill Seviper.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Seviper's Attack stat is equal to its Special Attack, and it even gets a strong STAB move to make use of it, making a Choice Band set a great choice. The only downside is that overall a Choice Band set is done slightly better by Arbok, which sports higher Speed and better bulk backed up by Intimidate. Still, Seviper packs more power, and because Seviper has the element of surprise with its massive special movepool, it's still a highly recommended set when considering Seviper for your team.</p> <p>Sludge Bomb and Earthquake have really good coverage together, with the latter providing super effective hits on enemy Poison-, Steel-, and Rock-types that resist or are immune to Sludge Bomb. Hidden Power Ghost is for Haunter and gets a slightly stronger hit on Chimecho than Sludge Bomb does. Unfortunately, Seviper doesn't get Rock Slide, another perk Arbok sports over its slithery friend, but the last slot here is largely filler anyway. Iron Tail is a good safety move, minus the accuracy, that ensures a super effective hit on Rock-types when using Earthquake could lead to a free switch to a Flying-type or a Levitate user by the opponent. Double-Edge is stronger and more reliable overall than Iron Tail, but this comes at the cost of any super effective coverage.</p> <p>An Adamant nature and maximum Speed are run to give Seviper as much power as possible while retaining the ability to Speed tie with neutral-natured max Speed Flareon and Chimecho. Jolly is definitely an option, as outspeeding neutral Flareon and Chimecho with this set is heavenly, but the drop in power isn't worth it in the long run. A Naughty nature can be used with a special move, particularly Giga Drain, in the last slot, which gives Seviper a much better tool to use against Whiscash and other physically bulkier Pokemon that resist Sludge Bomb like Relicanth and Graveler.</p> <p>This set has a hard time with Rock- and Steel-types, even with Earthquake available, making a physical sweeping partner such as Hitmonchan or a special attacker like Seadra or Haunter valued teammates. Defensive Chimecho can be lured in and eliminated, or at the very least sufficiently weakened, with Hidden Power Ghost, further making Hitmonchan and other Pokemon walled by it, like Plusle, good teammates to bring when using Seviper. A switch-in to Flying-types and Haunter is needed for this set to be successful, as they will gladly switch into a Choice-locked Earthquake at the first chance they get, meaning physically defensive Pokemon like Relicanth and specially defensive Pokemon like Kecleon should be paired with Seviper as well. In the same vein, having a good answer to Mawile is crucial to this set's success, as it will use its immunity to Sludge Bomb to set up Substitute or Swords Dance without hesitation, making Flareon a good teammate as well.</p>"

  "Whiscash": {
    "overview": "<p>Whiscash faces some stiff competition for the role of bulky Water-type in the NU metagame. Its main competition, Wailord, sports similar defensive capabilities (in fact, they shake out to be almost identical) as well as higher offensive stats, crucial resistances to Water and Ice, and access to two coveted moves in Roar and Self-Destruct. Whiscash, on the other hand, has what is possibly the best typing in the game and access to STAB Earthquake, effectively letting it take on several top threats, such as Haunter, Pikachu, and Pupitar, that Wailord can struggle against. However, despite just how good the Water / Ground typing is, the 4x weakness to Grass is what really lowers Whiscash's standing in the tier; Grass is a popular coverage type on wallbreakers, Fire-types like Flareon, and Water-types like Dewgong and Wailord, since there are many Pokemon that share Whiscash's unfortunate 4x weakness. If you can cover Whiscash's abhorration of the green stuff it'll pull its weight in any match.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Band set is perfectly doable thanks to Whiscash's high bulk and access to Earthquake, but its overall lack of power and meaningful coverage leave it outclassed by similar users like Relicanth and Metang. A fully specially defensive set is possible but ultimately strictly outclassed by Dewgong and Wailord due to Whiscash's unfortunate weakness to Grass-type attacks, which makes it an ineffective check to Fire- and Water-types that typically carry Hidden Power Grass. Rock Tomb and Icy Wind are interesting options considering Whiscash's middling Speed stat, potentially allowing it to tank an attack from, say, Haunter and finish it off the following turn with Surf. Spark is a cool option that allows Whiscash to run Grass, Electric, and Ice coverage all in one moveset, something very few other Pokemon can accomplish in NU, but Whiscash's Special Attack is pretty lackluster to make the most of it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Bellossom is probably the best overall switch-in to Whiscash, as it resists Whiscash's STAB attacks, doesn't take too much from Ice Beam, and can easily OHKO Whiscash with its Grass-type STAB moves. Roselia and Tangela will also both easily KO Whiscash but need to be more careful around Earthquake and Ice Beam, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Pelipper, Wailord, and other bulky Water-types will usually take a pittance from Whiscash's moves and can threaten back with Hidden Power Grass more than it can threaten them, but all will dislike getting inflicted by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Especially strong physical attackers will still break even maximum Defense Whiscash, such as Bulk Up Vigoroth and Hitmonchan at +2.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Attacks: Most of anything else with a Grass-type attack, such as Haunter, Flareon, and Huntail, can consider itself an effective check to Whiscash.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>With maximum Defense investment, Whiscash is physically bulky enough to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Metang and Hitmonchan, giving it an immediate niche in the tier. Physically defensive Whiscash vies for a team slot with Relicanth and Wailord, but there are a couple of things that make Whiscash worth using over both. While Relicanth resists Normal- and Flying-type attacks and Wailord is a better Fire-type check by virtue of being less susceptible to Grass-type attacks and has Roar, Whiscash has an easier time offensively beating back Hitmonchan, resists Rock and is immune to Electric, and more easily takes on special attackers like Haunter (assuming they lack Grass-type coverage). Earthquake and Ice Beam have very good coverage together and prevent Pokemon like Substitute Tropius from being able to take advantage of Whiscash even if it's asleep. RestTalk provides Whiscash with great longevity and allows it to absorb status for the team. Protect + Toxic is another option if you feel RestTalk leaves Whiscash too vulnerable, with Toxic allowing Whiscash to cripple most Pokemon that aren't too threatened by its coverage moves, notably other bulky Pokemon like Wailord and Chimecho.</p> <p>A more balanced EV spread can be used to turn Whiscash into a more of a blanket check and try to make the most of its set of resistances. With a spread of 252 HP / 140 Def / 112 SpD and a Sassy nature, Whiscash is still physically bulky enough to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Murkrow's Drill Peck and specially bulky enough to just barely survive a Fire Blast followed by a Hidden Power Grass from maximum Special Attack Flareon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Spikes can heavily pressure Whiscash and make it harder for it to check the physical attackers it needs to, such as Choice Band Metang and Relicanth, making Rapid Spin support from Hitmonchan highly valued to get the most out of Whiscash. In the same vein, Spikes support of your own will allow Whiscash to nab some KOs it can otherwise miss out on, such as an OHKO on Pupitar and a 2HKO on Choice Band Hitmonchan. Roselia is the best Spiker to pair with Whiscash, as it completely covers Whiscash's Grass-type weakness, can easily switch in on opposing Wailord, and can provide cleric support, and in return, Whiscash deals with a large majority of the physical attackers that give Roselia trouble. Other cleric options to consider pairing Whiscash with so that it doesn't have to rely on Sleep Talk rolls include Chimecho and Lickitung.</p>"

Whiscash's typing is perfectly suited to counteract the most common stall and defensive archetypes in the tier, with only other bulky Water-types standing in Whiscash's way of total team decimation. With the moves and EV spread given, Whiscash can create 101 HP Substitutes, giving it a totally free setup against standard physically defensive Sableye and letting it cleanly 2HKO it with Surf. Roselia, Flareon, and Mawile are all easily 2HKOed by Earthquake, and Substitute protects Whiscash from the former two's Grass-type attacks. The last slot is dedicated to how you want Whiscash to handle the opponent's bulky Water- or Grass-type. Ice Beam will absolutely shred Tangela and deals a decent chunk to offensive Bellossom, and Earthquake + Ice Beam has pretty stellar coverage in the tier. Toxic is the best all-around choice for weakening Dewgong, Wailord, and Bellossom in the long run but is easily worked around if the opponent has a cleric or RestTalk user. Hidden Power Grass deals some decent chip damage to Wailord and especially other Whiscash and Relicanth. It's not recommended to deviate from the EV spread given, as it is specifically tailored to achieve the KOs Whiscash needs.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Whiscash set thrives on Spikes support to weaken the opponent's bulky Water-type and help Whiscash nab the KOs that it wants to. Roselia is the best option, as it covers Whiscash's Grass-type weakness perfectly, although this set also fits well on the offensive teams that Glalie works best on. Pokemon that can lure in and eliminate the opponent's Water-type will also work wonders here, with an Explosion lure such as Torkoal and Metang making particularly good choices. Finally, Pokemon that work best with the opponent's stall core broken up are needed to make the most of this set. Late-game sweepers such as Huntail and Bellossom would be among the best choices.</p>"

  "Crawdaunt": {
    "overview": "<p>Crawdaunt stands out in the tier for sporting amazing mixed attacking stats and featuring a decent typing to make use of them. Having no physical STAB move is a letdown though, especially considering its incredible base 120 Attack stat, but its base 90 Special Attack is still fantastic by NU standards. It also has great coverage, both physical and special, meaning that once Crawdaunt steps onto the battlefield, something's getting hurt. Unfortunately, getting Crawdaunt in is hard considering its subpar bulk, and its low Speed means it'll be unlikely to sweep the opponent's team anytime soon. Still, if it's an unpredictable wallbreaker you're looking for, Crawdaunt is a fine candidate for offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The only major moves not mentioned above that are done well by Crawdaunt are Endeavor and Counter. Counter is extremely hard to use due to Crawdaunt's frailty, but from behind a teammate's Reflect it can be used effectively. Endeavor could see use on a Salac Berry set, but it is also pretty hard to use. As for other move choices, Icy Wind is an interesting move to cripple a potential revenge killer and give Crawdaunt the opportunity to threaten a KO with an appropriate move. Knock Off is a great move in general to remove the longevity of certain walls likely to switch into Crawdaunt, like Sableye and Wailord.</p> <p>Most other sets available to Crawdaunt are done better by Kingler, which sports slightly higher Attack, significantly higher Speed, a lack of a Fighting-type weakness, and better physical bulk. This includes, in particular, any Swords Dance or Salac Berry sets as well as any combination of the two.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Probably the best overall switch-in to Crawdaunt is Sableye, which really only fears Surf from the special attacking set or the rare Toxic or Taunt. Otherwise, it easily switches into most attacks from the Choice Band set and can outstall Crawdaunt with Toxic and Recover or use it as setup fodder for Calm Mind. Relicanth also switches into most attacks from the Choice Band set without fear, save for the uncommon Hidden Power Grass, and it can retaliate with its Rock-type STAB moves. However, Relicanth must be careful around the special attacking set. Tangela only fears Ice Beam and Sludge Bomb from the Choice Band set, but it cannot switch into anything very safely from the special attacking set. Rock-types and Mawile can easily tank Double-Edge or Return from the Choice Band set, but most of the other moves will leave a hefty dent or KO them if the opponent predicts wrong. In general, bulky Water-types like physically defensive Whiscash and Wailord can switch into most attacks from the Choice Band set, save for Double-Edge, and they fear little from the special attacking set.</p> <p>Hitmonchan, Plusle, Haunter, and most strong special attackers with a super effective move can revenge kill Crawdaunt without much issue, but they really cannot switch into anything safely. Finally, most strong physical attackers like Choice Band Piloswine can tank a physical attack and OHKO in return.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>A Choice Band set is probably the best way to make the best use of Crawdaunt's massive base 120 Attack stat, despite the lack of physical STAB moves. Double-Edge is Crawdaunt's strongest physical move and will hit like a truck, being only marginally weaker than Choice Band Raticate's own STAB-boosted Double-Edge. Return is a viable alternative if the recoil is unappealing and will still be Crawdaunt's strongest available physical move on the set. Hidden Power Ghost is used to annihilate Haunter and is Crawdaunt's best weapon against Chimecho, which Crawdaunt can generally switch into without much fear if it lacks Hidden Power Electric. Brick Break takes out Mawile, Lickitung, and Kecleon and will generally be used as a safety move. The last slot is saved for a special move to allow Crawdaunt to eliminate those targets that either resist its physical moves or just have substantially more Defense than Special Defense. Surf is boosted by STAB and is Crawdaunt's best weapon for Piloswine, physically defensive Sableye, Rock-types like Sudowoodo and Lairon, and Mawile, 2HKOing it after a layer of Spikes. Ice Beam can be used instead to take out Tangela, and it still hits some Rock-types harder than Crawdaunt's other moves, particularly Graveler. Finally, Hidden Power Grass is an option over Hidden Power Ghost to completely devastate Relicanth and Whiscash more than Crawdaunt's other options.</p> <p>The EV spread maxes out Attack to give Crawdaunt's physical moves as much damage output as possible, and enough Speed is run to outspeed minimum Speed base 70s like Dewgong. The rest is dumped into Special Attack to beef up the power of Crawdaunt's special move of choice.</p> <p>Crawdaunt's movepool is actually pretty extensive, and there are a few viable alternatives that can be run in the last slot. Going fully physical is definitely an option, with the Special Attack EVs then moved into Speed, which then ensures Crawdaunt can get the jump on maximum Speed Modest Bellossom and Huntail before they set up weather. If going fully physical, Sludge Bomb is probably the best option for the last slot, as it completely destroys Bellossom and even OHKOes uninvested Tangela. Hidden Power Rock is another great choice, as it has neutral coverage and is a good safety move to have, but nearly every target that it's super effective against takes about the same damage from Double-Edge anyway. Other special moves that can be run in the last slot include Crunch and Crabhammer, but they're generally less effective than the other options. Choice Band can be dropped in favor of Leftovers, which allows Crawdaunt the ability to switch moves and pummel the opposition with the correct move, but a lot of power is lost on its physical attacks if taking this route.</p> <p>Crawdaunt's role on a team with this set is to open holes in the opposition for another physical sweeper to come in later in the match and clean up the remains. Good options to do so are those that enjoy having Rock-types weakened or out of the way like Pidgeot and Murkrow, as well as generally good physical sweepers like Raticate, Vigoroth, and Hitmonchan. There's little that can actually switch into Crawdaunt completely safely, though Relicanth stands out as the most prominent if Hidden Power Grass isn't run, so having a switch-in to it such as Hitmonchan or a Grass-type like Tangela is desirable. Sableye also doesn't fear much from this set, being immune to Double-Edge and Brick Break and taking little from Hidden Power Ghost or the special move. Bringing a strong special attacker like Bellossom or Flareon to smash it to pieces would be a good idea when using Crawdaunt. Torkoal also switches into this set quite easily, even if Crawdaunt has Surf, making a Rock-type of your own like Magcargo or Sudowoodo a good teammate to have.</p> <p>Plusle and Grass-types cannot switch directly into Crawdaunt, but they do easily OHKO it once they get in, so having a teammate to tank their attacks and allow Crawdaunt to switch out is a good idea. Whiscash, Kecleon, and Swalot can all do this pretty well and mesh with Crawdaunt's typing pretty well too. Finally, Hitmonchan itself is pretty threatening for Crawdaunt, so having a teammate like Chimecho or Sableye is a good idea too.</p>"

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>A straight out-and-out special attacking set makes the best use of Crawdaunt's great base 90 Special Attack and special STAB moves, allowing it to surprise its normal switch-ins and deal a ton of damage to many targets in the tier in general. The main advantage Crawdaunt sports over the other special attacking Water-types in the tier is its access to STAB Crunch, which nearly OHKOes 252 HP Chimecho, and its surprise factor. Ice Beam pairs very nicely with Crawdaunt's STAB attacks and shreds Tangela apart while dealing a nice chunk of damage to Bellossom and Roselia. The last slot can go to Hidden Power Electric to get a super effective hit on Water-types like Pelipper and Huntail. However, Substitute can be used instead to protect Crawdaunt from revenge killers and status, and it allows Crawdaunt to more easily select the correct move for the situation. Another viable option for the last slot is Taunt, which is Crawdaunt's only real hope of being able to break past Sableye effectively and can trip up other defensive switch-ins like Dewgong, Swalot, and Wailord pretty nicely.</p> <p>There isn't much point to running any HP investment, considering Crawdaunt's terrible overall bulk, so maximum Speed is run to give Crawdaunt the edge against Modest Bellossom and Huntail. A Timid nature is an option as well, but making full use of Crawdaunt's good Special Attack is recommended, despite Timid coming with the advantage of outspeeding Timid Bellossom and Huntail. Going mixed is not recommended either, as then you are playing with a slightly worse version of the Choice Band set, and the only physical move of note that's really missed with this set is Brick Break.</p> <p>Toxic is a good move to run in the last slot as well, as it is Crawdaunt's best general weapon against special walls like Kecleon and Dewgong, both of which Crawdaunt has no real hope of breaking past otherwise. Hitmonchan makes a good partner to smash these as well as other special walls like Lickitung, and together Hitmonchan and Crawdaunt make a pretty fearsome offensive core, as Hitmonchan loves Crawdaunt's ability to remove Chimecho from the picture. Plusle and Grass-types have a really hard time switching into this set, but once in, they can obliterate Crawdaunt with their STAB move of choice. Because of this, Whiscash, Roselia, Swalot, and Flareon make good teammates to switch into them and force them out. Finally, Hitmonchan can switch into this set pretty easily, though it takes upwards of 50% from Surf, and it can OHKO Crawdaunt with Sky Uppercut; Chimecho and Sableye thus make good teammates.</p>"

  "Tropius": {
    "overview": "<p>Tropius is basically a poor man's version of Exeggutor. It cannot use Swords Dance well either. If, perchance, its max HP was two higher, it could produce 101 HP Substitutes and then have a use, but unfortunately, it doesn't. 99 Base HP is very odd. Seriously, use Exeggutor for Sunny Day + Chlorophyll movesets. In Ubers, Tropius might be able to switch into Groudon's Earthquake and Solar Beam it to death or Swords Dance up, though it doesn't stand a chance of doing anything else and is still inferior to Jumpluff, who has access to Sleep Powder, Encore, and a myriad of other status moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>You could try to raise Tropius's pathetic Special Attack with Growth, but honestly, it'll still be slow and the set up is too much effort with Tropius's lacking stats. You can use Leech Seed to help support Tropius, but the low Speed and mediocre defenses combined with high HP is the exact opposite of what you want in a Subseeder.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>The Sunny Day versions will need Speed and Special Attack. The Swords Dancer will need Attack and HP / defenses instead of Speed because it'll be slow as hell anyway. Tropius's max HP is 402, so it gets shafted and is unable to produce 101 HP Substitutes.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Anything carrying Ice Beam. Even Suicune can survive a Solar Beam due to Tropius's poor Special Attack and then OHKO it with Ice Beam. The Pokemon Tropius should be able to counter with its top movesets, Water-types, can easily OHKO with a non-STAB move. Pathetic. Blissey, Snorlax, and other special walls, especially Regice, can easily defeat any Tropius moveset. Any semi-decent physical tank such as Weezing and Skarmory can and will laugh at Swords Dancing Tropius.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SunnyBeam": {
        "description": "<p>Sunny Day makes Synthesis recover two-thirds of Tropius's HP as well as causing Solar Beam to only take one turn. Hidden Power Fire stops Steel-types like Skarmory from ruining Tropius's fun and is also boosted by sun. Add in the fact that Tropius's ability is Chlorophyll, and this makes for the best moveset it can run. However, Exeggutor still does this a lot better. Tropius's Special Attack is no where near Exeggutor's, so lower Special Defense Pokemon like Skarmory can sit and take its Solar Beams like nothing. Petaya Berry is an option because Tropius could use all the Special Attack boosts it can get, and with Synthesis recovering 66.7% in the Sun, there's not as much of a need for Leftovers. Hidden Power Ice does less to Steel- and Grass-types (as it doesn't get the weather boost), but Salamence is probably the safest switch-in to Tropius, so why not get it with Hidden Power Ice? It also hits other Flying-types harder than Solar Beam and Hidden Power Fire would.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {"description": "<p>Tropius will have trouble sweeping anything without the Speed boost from Chlorophyll because it is pretty damn slow, which is why Salac Berry is an option.

There are definitely better Pokemon to Swords Dance with than Tropius.</p>"}

  "Glalie": {
    "overview": "<p>Glalie stands out as the fastest and best Spiker for hyper offense teams in NU as well as the defining factor of the lead metagame. What makes Glalie such a good lead is its combination of high Speed, ability to go physically or specially offensive, and access to said Spikes as well as Explosion. Explosion gives Glalie a ton of offensive presence and is a great tool for granting it momentum by allowing it to choose when to go out after Spikes are set. Unfortunately, Glalie is almost impossible to switch in safely due to its poor defensive typing, and its movepool is pretty shallow, giving it little utility outside of the lead teamslot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A specially offensive Spiker set is definitely viable, but strictly outclassed by both the bulky and physically offensive sets due to weaker overall coverage, despite making the most of Glalie's STAB Ice Beam. If you want to run such a set, use Spikes, Crunch, Ice Beam, and either Explosion or Hidden Power Water with a Hasty or Timid nature, depending on what you fill the last slot with.</p> <p>As for general move alternatives, Blizzard is available for a stronger Ice-type STAB attack, which deals significantly more damage to the targets it's neutral on. Light Screen is available to support the team before going down, but most teams would rather make use of the hole provided by Explosion. Rain Dance is an option that can allow Glalie to set up Spikes and rain, then Explode to give a free switch to a sweeper like Huntail. Finally, Sing is risky but available to cripple the foe.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As Glalie is typically seen as a lead, the best way to limit its effectiveness is to be as prepared for it in the lead slot as possible. Magby and Ponyta are probably the best anti-leads available in the metagame, as they easily outspeed Glalie and OHKO it with Overheat before it can even move. Charmeleon and Quilava are decent alternatives but can only Speed tie it. Vigoroth and opposing Glalie can prevent Glalie from setting up Spikes with Taunt. Venomoth can easily outspeed Glalie and put it to sleep with Sleep Powder, totally crippling it unless it runs Lum Berry or Sleep Talk. A lead Hitmonchan can threaten an immediate KO with Sky Uppercut and spin away the Spikes Glalie might set up, but it's slower than Glalie and therefore susceptible to Explosion. Other effective anti-leads that can normally limit Glalie to one layer of Spikes includes Torkoal, Flareon, and Rock- and Steel-types.</p> <p>Outside of the lead metagame, Mawile is probably the best initial switch-in to Glalie because it has Intimidate to lessen the blow from Earthquake, resists Explosion and Ice Beam, and can eliminate Glalie with Hidden Power Steel or Focus Punch. However, it's slow and will allow Glalie to get at a minimum of two layers of Spikes if it switches in on turn one. Ghost-types like Haunter, Shedinja, and Sableye are completely immune to Explosion, and Shedinja is immune to Ice Beam as well, though KOed by Spikes. Lairon is essentially immune to Explosion and resists Ice Beam, though it's really weak to Earthquake. Other Rock-types, particularly Sudowoodo and Relicanth, can easily KO Glalie with Rock Slide and resist Explosion with the latter also resisting Ice Beam.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>This set is designed to get as many layers of Spikes up as early in the game as possible. The bulk from the HP investment gives Glalie some survivability against non-super effective STAB moves like Kecleon's Return and opposing Glalie attacks not named Explosion. Taunt prevents other Glalie from setting up Spikes for two turns, assuming your Glalie wins the Speed tie. Alternatively, Sleep Talk can prevent Glalie from being completely crippled by sleep leads, such as Venomoth. Ice Beam destroys Grass- and Ground-types that may be leading for the opponent, though they're rare sights. It also deals a ton of damage to Pokemon looking to absorb Explosion, particularly Haunter and Rock-types like Graveler. Explosion allows Glalie to take out or leave a hole in the opponent's lead and limits the number of Spikes layers their Glalie can set up. Explosion is also Glalie's best tool against a few common switch-ins like Flareon and Hitmonchan, the latter of which will be looking to spin away Glalie's Spikes.</p> <p>Naive is the chosen nature to make sure Explosion and Ice Beam are as strong as possible. A Hasty nature is an option as well, and both have the same general level of effectiveness in the long run. Max Speed is needed to Speed tie with other Glalie as well as Charmeleon, an admittedly uncommon anti-lead. Lum Berry is an alternative item choice to Leftovers that can prevent Venomoth from totally crippling Glalie on turn one and guaranteeing Glalie to get at least one layer of Spikes against it. Hidden Power Grass can be used in the second moveslot to eliminate Relicanth and other Rock-types looking to absorb Explosion. In the same vein, Hidden Power Water hits Rock- and Fire-types for a decent amount of damage, both of which are otherwise capable anti-leads to Glalie. Finally, Hidden Power Psychic deals a high amount of damage to Hitmonchan and Haunter, but Ice Beam deals a fair amount already.</p> <p>Nearly every team benefits from having a Spiker in some way, and this set is the most reliable way of getting at least one layer up early in the match. Unfortunately, Glalie doesn't really provide any type of synergy and should probably be used in the lead slot only. This set works best on more offensive teams due to the fact that Glalie likely isn't going to last throughout the match and will be KOed in the lead slot, meaning it's not going to be coming in later in the match to set up Spikes again if they get spun away. Teams that have a lot of fast, strong attackers like Murkrow, Raticate, and Plusle will make the best use of having Glalie on their team.</p> <p>Explosion is ideally Glalie's mode of leaving the match, and there are a few Pokemon that can tank it pretty well, particularly Rock-, Ghost-, and Steel-types like Relicanth, Sableye, and Mawile. However, it will leave a sizable dent in nearly everything that is not a Ghost-type or Lairon, meaning Pokemon that can take advantage of the hole it leaves and force them out are the best teammates. Hitmonchan, Vigoroth, and Arbok are all offensive Pokemon that can sweep with the opponent's physical wall heavily damaged. Finally, if the opponent leads with a Pokemon weak to Ice Beam, they'll likely switch to a Fire- or Water-type to tank the attack. Pokemon that can switch into them to preserve Glalie for later in the match make good teammates as well; Kecleon and Pelipper are good examples that can switch into either one.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>This is probably the best offensive approach to Glalie, allowing it to deal as much damage as possible while still setting up Spikes efficiently. Earthquake deals a ton of damage to common Glalie switch-ins, particularly Rock- and Steel-types like Lairon, Metang, and Sudowoodo looking to absorb Explosion or Ice Beam, as well as Fire-types like Magcargo and Flareon. Shadow Ball takes out the likes of Haunter, Chimecho, and Shedinja, which otherwise can easily switch in on Earthquake or Explosion. Alternatively, Hidden Power Rock makes sure Pidgeot and Murkrow can't switch in easily on Earthquake and takes them out without having to resort to Explosion, and it still does a decent amount to Haunter and takes out Shedinja. Finally, Explosion gets Glalie out of the way and deals an insane amount of damage with max Attack, letting it leave a dent in even physical stalwarts like Relicanth.</p> <p>Leftovers allows Glalie to both set up Spikes and attack with the appropriate move when it needs to, but Glalie gains a ton of power with Choice Band. Getting locked into Spikes with Choice Band isn't a huge detriment, either, considering setting up Spikes is its primary role on the team.</p> <p>This set is best fit on heavy offense teams that want Glalie to set Spikes but also have the ability to punch holes in the opposing team from turn 1. This set is a good lure for weakening or removing the Rock-types that are likely to switch into Glalie to absorb Explosion, which can allow for an easier sweep by your Normal- or Flying-types later in the match. With a Choice Band, Glalie even easily 2HKOes 252 HP Relicanth with Earthquake. If it wins the Speed tie, this set also beats lead Charmeleon, which normally forces Glalie to either switch out or get only one layer of Spikes up.</p>"

  "Huntail": {
    "overview": "<p>Huntail behaves on the battlefield as it does in nature: lurking in the depths, ready to pounce at a moment's notice and decimate its prey. Huntail is the best single-turn setup sweeper available in NU, almost literally turning the tide of battle as soon as it makes its appearance. With just rain active, Huntail easily outspeeds and OHKOes or 2HKOes a huge portion of the NU tier thanks to the combination of Swift Swim and rain-boosted Hydro Pump, making it a threat you absolutely must have an answer for. As if its STAB attacks were not scary enough, it also boasts great coverage, making it incredibly hard to outright wall and unpleasant to play around. Make no mistake; misstep around Huntail, and the battle is lost.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Despite boasting one of the most dangerous sets in NU, Huntail really can't do much more than what's been listed. While its Attack is actually higher than its Special Attack, it doesn't have any notable moves nor STAB to make use of it apart from Double-Edge and Hidden Power, although it does get Screech to add some oomph to its attacks. Crunch is an alternate coverage option available to Huntail, but is really only useful for Chimecho, and Huntail's STAB attacks do more to Chimecho than Crunch does with rain active. Blizzard is an option over Ice Beam to threaten Bellossom a bit more, but its accuracy sucks. Refresh can protect Huntail from Thunder Wave from the likes of Octillery and Kecleon, as well as other status, but is hard to fit on its sets. Finally, Toxic is an option to whittle down Dewgong and Bellossom if they lack Rest, which may be more helpful in the long run than Huntail's other attacks.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>By avoiding the 3HKO from Hidden Power Grass and being able to heal off any damage done to it, RestTalk Dewgong is about the only true counter to Huntail available in the tier. The next best answer is specially defensive Bellossom, particularly those that carry Sunny Day, but they will still take a number from Ice Beam. Castform gets a special mention here as being a solid offensive check, although it is still 2HKOed by a Mystic Water- and rain-boosted Hydro Pump while only being able to 2HKO back with Thunderbolt (it does get the OHKO with a Modest Thunder, however). RestTalk Wailord with Roar is a great answer to Huntail, as it too can heal off the damage from Hidden Power Grass and use Roar to disrupt Huntail's rain turns. Lickitung, Kecleon, and Wigglytuff are good checks to Huntail if they can nail it with Toxic as it uses Rain Dance, and proceed to stall out its rain turns with Wish and Protect or Rest. Roselia just barely avoids the 2HKO from Ice Beam if it switches into it, and can proceed to use Giga Drain to deal huge damage to Huntail or paralyze it with Stun Spore. Outside of rain, Huntail is rather easy to revenge kill with fast Pokemon that have powerful Electric- or Grass-type attacks like Plusle, Haunter, and Grovyle.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swift Swim Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Not only is this set super dangerous, it's also super easy to play with if you're good at making use of the limited rain turns. Simply get Huntail in, set up Rain Dance, and proceed to use Hydro Pump until you win. Ice Beam is there to keep Roselia and other Grass-types from effectively countering Huntail. The last moveslot is dedicated to dealing as much damage as possible to the tier's other Water-types. Hidden Power Grass is nice to get the OHKO on Relicanth and Whiscash, while Hidden Power Electric decimates Pelipper.</p> <p>The EV spread is straightforwardly offensive to make Huntail as strong and fast as possible, with maximum Speed being needed to ensure Huntail at least Speed ties with other Huntail and outspeeds base 50 Speed Pokemon outside of rain. A bulkier EV spread of 152 HP / 252 SpA / 104 Spe is certainly doable if you are unconcerned about tying with other Huntail, giving Huntail some cushion against priority attacks and weaker attacks from its counters like Dewgong. The 104 Spe EVs are kept to hit 166 Speed, which doubles to 332 in the rain, just enough to outpace +1 Pupitar. Running the above spread with a Modest nature is also an option, which will notably ensure the 2HKO against Roselia with Ice Beam. Finally, Mystic Water is an option to give Huntail's Water-type STAB attack a bit more punch, in particular opening up a guaranteed OHKO on 252 HP Chimecho with Hydro Pump and a 2HKO on maximum Special Defense Lickitung with Surf.</p> <p>The last moveslot can be replaced if you are confident in your ability to remove Huntail's checks and counters before bringing it out. Baton Pass is the most immediate replacement option, as it gives Huntail a fantastic way out of the battlefield and keeps momentum on your team's side. Substitute can be used to protect Huntail from status from the likes of Lickitung, Togetic, and Wailord. Finally, Toxic is an option to counteract Dewgong lacking Rest as a reliable long-term answer to Huntail.</p> <p>Huntail is a pretty self-sufficient late-game sweeper, although there are a couple Pokemon that need to be weakened or removed before it can consider a sweep. Specially defensive Dewgong is the most pressing concern, as it is only 4HKOed by Hidden Power Grass and can easily remove the damage with Rest and attack in kind with its own Hidden Power Grass. Specially defensive Bellossom is the other major barrier to a successful Huntail sweep, as it is only 3HKOed by Ice Beam and can regain its health with Giga Drain and Synthesis. As both of these answers, as well as most of the other Pokemon that can tank a Hydro Pump, are grounded, Spikes support is the best way to initiate a Huntail sweep. This makes Cacturne and Roselia good teammates, and both can switch into the Grass- and Electric-type attacks that are sure to be aimed at Huntail. A strong, physically attacking teammate can remove most of the Pokemon that can reliably answer Huntail, making Hitmonchan a good offensive partner. Plusle makes a fantastic offensive teammate as well, as it can remove Dewgong from the picture and weaken the other specially defensive Pokemon on your opponent's team enough for Huntail to sweep. As a bonus, Plusle gets Rain Dance and Thunder, making it a good dedicated rain setter teammate as well. Pairing Huntail with a lure like Seadra is also an option, as it can force the opponent to reveal their Water-type answer and weaken it, allowing you to best prepare for a Huntail sweep later in the game.</p>"

      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>While Huntail's main role and presence in NU is as a rain sweeper, it also has a function as a member of Baton Pass chains. Its main role on chains is as an anti-lead; after a Barrier boost, Glalie's Explosion is only doing a maximum of 54% to Huntail. On top of this, Huntail easily OHKOes the common Fire-type leads of the tier with Hydro Pump and isn't threatened by Hitmonchan after a Barrier boost either. This allows it to start the Baton Pass chain on the right foot and get the Defense boost its teammates will need to continue the chain. While Huntail doesn't offer anything else to pass (no Aqua Ring or Agility in ADV), it does offer a large offensive presence and can make use of the Special Attack boosts that are going to be accumulated on the rest of the chain.</p> <p>Maximum Speed and HP EVs are run to give Huntail as much speed and bulk as possible to start the chain off on the right foot. Lum Berry is a recommended option if using Huntail in the lead slot to make sure it can avoid status from leads like Octillery, Venomoth, and Torkoal. Otherwise, Leftovers is preferred to make the most of Huntail's bulk and give it some longevity to switch into Spikes repeatedly if needed.</p> <p>While this set can be run off of Baton Pass chains and used as simply a bulky attacker outside of rain, Seadra typically does the part better thanks to its higher Speed. That said, most players will assume an attempt at a rain sweep as soon as Huntail's presence is known, allowing this set to function more as an offensive pivot and play around your opponent's assumptions. Baton Pass also gives Huntail a bit more momentum than Seadra does, and passing a Substitute to a teammate like Bulk Up Hitmonchan can be game-changing. If using this set that way, it's recommended to replace Barrier with Ice Beam to give Huntail a bit more coverage.</p>"

  "Relicanth": {
    "overview": "<p>Say hello to the overall best Rock-type in NU. Relicanth has a lot of things going for it: it has the highest physical bulk in the tier (beating out even Shuckle), it's decently strong, it has great abilities, and its secondary Water typing is decently useful despite it adding weaknesses to Grass and Electric. Thanks to these factors, Relicanth can take on an offensive or defensive role for your team, making it easy to fit on teams looking for a good Normal and Flying check. However, its really common weaknesses, particularly its weakness to Fighting, are awful, and while it's a physically defensive behemoth, its Special Defense is pretty lacking. That said, you really can't go wrong with including Relicanth on your team; just keep an eye out for errant Grass-type attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Relicanth's movepool is surprisingly large for a fish Pokemon, but the most effective sets have been listed above. Of the sets not listed, a Substitute + 3 attacks set is probably the most effective, with Rock Slide, Earthquake, and Double-Edge having sufficient coverage and Rock Head preventing recoil giving Relicanth a nice niche over similar users of the set like Pidgeot. A status platform set focusing on the various status moves Relicanth has like Toxic, Body Slam, and Yawn can be a fun gimmick to disrupt the opponent's team with, but going that route sacrifices Relicanth's overall effectiveness and longevity. Relicanth's immense physical bulk means a Swagger + Psych Up set is possible, although Relicanth is a bit too specially frail to really make use of it, as Relicanth's main revenge killers hit it specially, meaning it won't be able to risk staying in to get the Psych Up boost.</p> <p>Hidden Power Flying wasn't specifically mentioned before, but it gives Relicanth a move for both Grass-types and Hitmonchan in one moveslot. Relicanth is probably the best user of Rock Tomb in the tier and it gets STAB on the move, although Rock Slide's extra power is usually going to be more appreciated. Hydro Pump can make a decent last move to give Relicanth the jump on Mawile and Metang among other physically bulky Pokemon, but the needed Special Attack EVs to make it worth it are too costly in the long run. Finally, Blizzard is Relicanth's best option for Tangela and will completely throttle it, but its accuracy and the fact that defensive Tangela isn't super common mean it'll be a dead moveslot way more often than not.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Defensive Grass-types are the absolute best answers to any Relicanth set, with Tangela and Bellossom only really fearing Toxic and easily OHKOing back with their STAB moves. Roselia is even immune to Toxic, but it takes quite a bit more from Rock Slide. Hitmonchan resists Rock Slide and will leave a large dent in Relicanth with Sky Uppercut. If Relicanth lacks Toxic, it becomes huge setup bait for Bulk Up Hitmonchan. Plusle and Haunter have a hard time switching in but will easily 2HKO Relicanth with Thunderbolt. Mawile's Intimidate, immunity to Toxic, and Rock resistance make it a great switch-in as well, although it'll still take a decent amount from Earthquake; however, against Earthquake-less sets Mawile will easily get up a Substitute and start boosting with Swords Dance.</p> <p>In general, Hidden Power Grass destroys Relicanth, and a lot of Pokemon can easily find the room to stick it on their sets with the sole intention of nailing Relicanth with it. Murkrow in particular is notorious for having this option waiting in the wings, but many other Pokemon can find the room for it too, including Chimecho, Golbat, Lickitung, and Water-types like Wailord and Dewgong.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>This is the pinnacle of physical defense in NU. Not even Choice Band Kingler's Hidden Power Ground can 2HKO this set, and Hitmonchan only does 70% at most with its Choice Band-boosted Sky Uppercut. While it would be great if Relicanth could avoid a 2HKO from powerful STAB Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, literally every other physical attack barely even fazes this fish, giving your team a super solid backbone to rely on and pivot around. Rock + Ground is great attacking coverage and lets Relicanth fend off a huge portion of the Pokemon it'll be switching into, and having two attacking options means Relicanth is less of a liability while it's sleeping via Rest. That said, Toxic allows Relicanth to effectively wear down common defensive Pokemon like Sableye, and ultimately win stall wars via RestTalk, making it an option over the added coverage that Earthquake provides. Speaking of RestTalk, the combination allows Relicanth to absorb status for the remainder of its team, which is a somewhat rare commodity in NU, and greatly increases its own longevity throughout the match.</p> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment is recommended to make Relicanth as physically bulky as possible; however, the EV spread is flexible depending on what you need Relicanth to do for your team. 84 Speed EVs can be run to allow Relicanth to outspeed uninvested Chimecho, but beware that Chimecho typically runs enough Speed to outrun Dewgong, so this may ultimately be a fruitless effort. 108 Attack EVs can be run to always OHKO standard Charmeleon with Rock Slide, although this is the only significant KO picked up by running any Attack less than maximum; otherwise, you're better off just using a more offensively oriented set. Swift Swim should be the ability because there aren't any recoil moves on this set, and the possibility to countersweep rain sweepers should always be kept open.</p> <p>Body Slam can be run on this set over Toxic or Earthquake to spread around paralysis. Yawn is another option in this moveslot to force the opponent to switch more often and accumulate Spikes damage or to just put the opposing Pokemon to sleep if it stays in, which can be game-changing. While unorthodox and typically not recommended, Calm Mind and Surf can be run on this set to turn Relicanth into an extremely bulky tank that's nearly impenetrable on both defenses. However, Surf is super weak until it's boosted to about +4, and Relicanth will rarely find the time to boost that high, since most special attackers will still blow through it with Grass- or Electric-type moves even if it's boosted. Psych Up can also be run on this set to protect Relicanth from setup sweepers like Calm Mind Chimecho and Swords Dance Kingler, although it will be a dead moveslot in most games.</p> <p>Defensive Relicanth fits best on teams that have glaring weaknesses to the Normal- and Flying-types found in the tier, particularly those that have Bellossom, Hitmonchan, and Venomoth all on the same team. Pairing Relicanth with a specially defensive bulwark like Kecleon can create a nigh-impregnable defensive core, and filling the defensive gap between the two against strong Fighting- and Ground-types with something like Chimecho, Pelipper, or Tangela can be a good idea.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Relicanth is far and away the bulkiest Choice Band user in the tier and has really good coverage, making it a decent choice for offensive teams looking for a defensive backbone that don't want to lose offensive momentum. Not having STAB on Earthquake is really awful and is a major perk Graveler has over this Relicanth set, as well as access to Explosion, but Relicanth's higher Speed, overall better bulk, and recoil-free Double-Edge make it a better tank. The last slot on this set is largely filler, with Hidden Power Ghost being Relicanth's best attack for Haunter and Chimecho, and Hidden Power Bug getting a marginally better hit on Tangela and Bellossom than Relicanth's other moves.</p> <p>84 Speed EVs let Relicanth outpace minimum Speed Chimecho, which very few of the other Choice Band users in the tier can spare the bulk or Attack to do. Like with any of Relicanth's sets, you can put a lot of different things in the last slot, as you'll rarely, if ever, use it. Sleep Talk is a cool option, and although Relicanth is rarely going to be absorbing Sleep Powder due to the main users being Grass-types, it does do a decent job at absorbing Yawn from the likes of Chimecho and Swalot. Leftovers can be used on this set over Choice Band, but Relicanth wants the power and can usually afford to miss the recovery. If going with Leftovers, Protect makes a phenomenal move to use in the last slot to increase Relicanth's longevity and ease prediction.</p> <p>Relicanth is an exceptionally good check to the Normal- and Flying-types in the tier, making frail attackers that usually have problems with them, such as Flareon and Hitmonchan, good teammates. While Relicanth can switch into Fire-type attacks very easily, it is extremely susceptible to the Grass-type attacks they're normally paired with. Grass- and Bug-types make good teammates, as they can switch into the Grass-type attacks Relicanth fears, and they can switch into Fire-type attacks should it be needed, particularly random Hidden Power Fires from the likes of Venomoth and Chimecho. Relicanth has a hard time with Plusle and other special attackers, making Lickitung, Kecleon, and specially defensive Flareon good teammates as well.</p>"

      "Swift Swim Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>This set functions as a decent late-game cleaner that separates itself from the pack by being extremely naturally bulky. With the moves chosen, Relicanth has fantastic neutral coverage, further improving its niche over other similar late-game cleaners like Sunny Day sweepers and Salac Berry sweepers like Kingler. The idea with this set is simple: get it in late-game on a Flying-type that Relicanth takes little damage from like Pidgeot, set up Rain Dance, and proceed to clean up the remnants of your opponent's team with the appropriate move. QuakeSlide offers the best possible neutral coverage for Relicanth in two moves. Surf and Hydro Pump are the best choices for the last slot due to the boost they receive from the rain and STAB, even though they use Relicanth's lower Special Attack.</p> <p>There's a lot you can do with the EV spread, but the listed one is recommended and does several things. 52 Speed EVs let Relicanth outspeed minimum Speed Whiscash outside of rain and base Speed 95s and below in rain. 152 Special Attack EVs are enough to OHKO maximum HP Sudowoodo in the rain with Surf after Spikes damage. A bit more Speed can be run to outpace Raticate in the rain, but it's largely unneeded, since Raticate can't do a whole lot to Relicanth (though it may be worth it if you're scared of Reversal sets). Less Special Attack can be run if using Hydro Pump to put those EVs in HP to increase bulk. Surf and the Special Attack EVs can be dropped for something like Double-Edge, Hidden Power Bug, or Substitute. If doing this, move the Special Attack EVs to HP to increase overall bulk, as Relicanth does not need the extra Speed.</p> <p>This set makes a good one-two punch sweeping partner with Huntail, as Huntail can blast open holes in the opponent's defense for Relicanth to come in later to finish the job. Huntail also hits specially and Relicanth physically, making the duo hard to wall. Plusle and Pikachu are also really good offensive teammates, as they can set up Rain Dance and take advantage of the rain with an accurate Thunder, and Pikachu also receives a boosted Surf to play around with.</p> <p>This Relicanth has a really tough time with Grass-types, particularly defensive Tangela and Bellossom, making Flying-types like Murkrow and Fire-types like specially attacking Flareon good teammates. Specially defensive teammates in general are good to have to absorb the Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks aimed Relicanth, making Kecleon and Lickitung good teammates. Relicanth can only KO Hitmonchan if it's been severely weakened, and Relicanth's lower bulk also means that it's more susceptible to Mach Punch than usual, meaning Swalot and Chimecho are good teammates too.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Luvdisc has no use outside of NU, and even then, it's inferior to just about any Pokemon. This is quite possibly the most underpowered Pokemon aside from Ditto and maybe Unown (at least Unown has decent attacking stats and is immune to Ground). It lacks the stats and movepool to hurt anything.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Yeah, Luvdisc is pretty bad and has like NO moves. It doesn't even learn Hydro Pump. Flail on a physical attacker is an option (because Luvdisc's Attack is nearly as good as its Special Attack).</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>Just HP, a defense, and Special Attack for the Rain Dancing Luvdisc. With a ton of Defense EVs, it can survive Choice Band Metagross's Meteor Mash and possibly 2HKO with Rain Dance-boosted Surf.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Anything with an attack; look out for bulky Water-types!</p>",

Rain Dance up against something like Rhydon that won't survive a Surf and hit everything \"hard\" with Surf and Blizzard. If you come across a Water-type, hit it with Hidden Power Grass. Lum Berry is more useful than Leftovers because, if Luvdisc get statused, it basically loses instantly and everything will either OHKO it or do 90% or so anyway so Leftovers aren't really that important. Even Suicune 2HKOes with Surf in the rain.</p>"}}

  "Shelgon": {
    "overview": "<p>Shelgon stands out in the NU tier as the only usable Dragon-type (Dragonair is there but not really usable), giving it a unique defensive and offensive niche. Access to Dragon Dance makes it very dangerous, and setting up is pretty easy overall thanks to its typing and good physical bulk. It's also a very durable defensive option with access to Wish to keep it and its teammates healthy throughout the match. A huge weakness to Ice and being specially frail hurts it, though, and it lacks a usable STAB move. Still, for teams looking for a good surprise offensive or defensive option, Shelgon is certainly a viable candidate.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A bulky Dragon Dance set is certainly possible, but not focusing on Shelgon's Speed can lead to it being ineffective against offensive teams, and not focusing on its Attack can leave its overall damage output much to be desired, even at +2.</p> <p>Beyond that, Shelgon actually has a surprisingly wide movepool; it just can't make use of a lot of it. Hydro Pump and Fire Blast can both prove to be very useful on either the Dragon Dance or defensive set, with the former easily OHKOing Graveler and the latter 2HKOing Mawile, but the unique KOs they get pretty much stop there. Iron Defense can make Shelgon nigh untouchable physically and could make very good use of the last slot on the Dragon Dance set, but it does nothing to protect Shelgon from special attacks or critical hits. Finally, Shelgon has access to both Rain Dance and Sunny Day, meaning it could be a useful defensive teammate to weather sweepers, especially when also running Wish.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Water-types, particularly Dewgong and Whiscash with Ice Beam, will prove to be the best switch-ins to Shelgon, with the former only being 2HKOed at best by any of Shelgon's attacks at +1, and the latter not even facing a 2HKO from Double-Edge at +2 (assuming it's fully physically defensive). Offensive Water-types like Seadra and Huntail won't be able to switch in as easily, but they'll cleanly OHKO even defensive Shelgon with Ice Beam after a layer of Spikes. It should be mentioned here as well that Glalie will easily outspeed any Shelgon and cleanly OHKO it with Ice Beam as well.</p> <p>Mawile and Metang probably make the next best switch-ins, as they resist Double-Edge and won't take much damage from Brick Break or Hidden Power Ground. They do need to be careful of Shelgon just boosting in their faces, though, and they need to watch out for Fire Blast, but it's super rare on Shelgon overall. Defensive Tangela also avoids the 2HKO from Double-Edge even at +2, and it can hit Shelgon with Leech Seed and Stun Spore quite easily. Finally, any strong special attacker will be able to break through even defensive Shelgon without much trouble, including Haunter, Chimecho, Plusle with Hidden Power Ice, and Crawdaunt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Bring Shelgon in late-game on something that can't really hurt it, like Flareon or Hidden Power Grass Plusle, set up with Dragon Dance, and pummel the foe with the appropriate move. Double-Edge will be Shelgon's main weapon and comes with no recoil thanks to Rock Head. Rock Slide and Brick Break give the best possible coverage against the Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-types that resist Double-Edge. Brick Break can be replaced with Hidden Power Ground, though, to trade a super effective hit on Lickitung for a 4x super effective hit on Magcargo and a super effective hit on Metang.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is needed to outpace Raticate and the numerous base 95s at +1, although Adamant can be used, as Shelgon will then have a chance to OHKO Pidgeot with Rock Slide and a much higher chance to OHKO Hitmonchan after a layer of Spikes with Double-Edge. Speaking of which, Spikes is really important for the success of this set, as Shelgon is just on the cusp of a lot of OHKOs and 2HKOs at +1, making Glalie and Cacturne highly recommended offensive Spiking teammates. Shelgon's movepool is pretty tiny, so there's not a lot to use in the moveslots over the choices given, although Substitute is available and could prove useful to ease setting up and protect Shelgon from debilitating status or priority.</p> <p>Shelgon excels at cleaning up weakened teams, as it can 2HKO a large portion of the tier but normally won't be OHKOing much, especially bulky Pokemon like Graveler, Sudowoodo, defensive Tangela, Lickitung, and Whiscash. Shelgon's only relevant type weakness is to Ice-type attacks, which are few and far between, but having a defensive backbone to absorb them is a good idea, particularly specially defensive Normal-types like Lickitung and Kecleon and Pokemon that will beat Dewgong one-on-one like Sableye and Hitmonchan.</p>"

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Shelgon is physically defensive enough to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Hitmonchan's Sky Uppercut after a turn of Protect, and that fact combined with a lack of physical weaknesses gives Shelgon a nice defensive niche in the tier. While Shelgon's Defense is high, it has little in the way of a supportive movepool outside of Wish, but it certainly makes do with what it's got. The main reason you'd choose Shelgon over Lickitung as a Wish passer is its lack of Fighting weakness, while Shelgon's appeal over Flareon is its higher physical Defense and lack of Water and Ground weaknesses.</p> <p>Protect is super nice for scouting Choice Band attacks, racking up Toxic damage, and guaranteeing Wish recovery, but it can be forgone for Roar, which not only is rare in the tier but also prevents the opponent from using Shelgon as complete setup fodder. Roar also pairs nicely with the defensive nature of this set by exposing the opponent's team and racking up Spikes damage. Body Slam is pretty weak, especially without STAB or Attack investment, but it's nice for a chance to paralyze, which completely cripples a couple of the Pokemon Shelgon can wall, namely Pidgeot and Raticate. There's not a lot available that can go in its place; Dragon Claw is available and will get roughly the same amount of damage on targets with equal defenses like Pidgeot, but it lacks a paralysis chance, will be significantly weaker against specially defensive targets like Hitmonchan and Flareon, and still leaves Shelgon walled by Steel-types like Mawile; however, the higher damage against Rock-types like Sudowoodo could prove useful if your team is weak against them.</p> <p>While Shelgon's typing is better suited for a specially defensive set, as it resists key special types in Water, Fire, Electric, and Grass, it simply doesn't have the bulk to pull it off, so it's not a good idea to take Shelgon in that direction. Hidden Power Ghost can be used somewhere on the set to ensure that Haunter can't just switch into Shelgon for free, but Haunter isn't super hard to counter and Shelgon will normally be passing Wish to its teammates anyway. Switching up the set and replacing Wish and Protect with RestTalk is an option that gives Shelgon a lot of longevity, but Shelgon just doesn't have the defensive or offensive presence on the battlefield to really make it worth it in the long run.</p> <p>Spikes support can really make or break the effectiveness of this set, making Glalie and defensive Roselia great teammates worth strong consideration. Bulky Water-types, particularly RestTalk Dewgong and Whiscash, will walk all over this set thanks to Ice Beam and the fact they won't mind being hit by status. Due to this, bulky Bellossom and offensive teammates to shatter these Pokemon such as Plusle and Haunter are needed. Chimecho with Taunt or Heal Bell can set up on this set pretty easily, making Dark-types good teammates as well.</p> <p>Finally, defensive Shelgon is best used in a defensive core with specially defensive teammates to cover those offensive Pokemon it cannot beat itself. Flareon stands out from the pack due to its access to Wish, resistance to Ice, and good synergy with Shelgon all around; the only issue with this core is the fact they are both weak to offensive Water-types like Seadra and Huntail. Other specially defensive candidates include Kecleon and Dewgong, both of which enjoy Wish support and Shelgon's ability to take on Hitmonchan.</p>"

By virtue of Metang's bulk and typing, it's able to check potent offensive Pokemon like Haunter, Calm Mind Chimecho, and Golbat. Offensively, Metang's access to near-perfect coverage lets it heavily pressure defensive cores, with Meteor Mash's chance to raise Metang's Attack leaving traditional physical walls at risk of being overpowered by even non-Choice Band variants, while its access to Agility helps it give offensive teams headaches. Metang also has access to an incredibly powerful Explosion, which makes it great at drawing in and removing bulky Water-types for its teammates. Unfortunately, Metang struggles to pressure bulky Water-types without sacrificing itself and faces a fair amount of competition from Mawile as a defensive Steel-type due to the latter's better capabilities as a physical wall thanks to Intimidate, which makes it less susceptible to coverage moves from the likes of Murkrow and Pidgeot. Additionally, Metang is vulnerable to common coverage attacks from Pokemon such as Raticate and Pidgeot as well as less common options like Hidden Power Fire from Roselia and Will-O-Wisp from Haunter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Metang can make use of RestTalk so it has a more reliable form of recovery and isn't passive while asleep, although it loses out on a great deal of utility by dropping Toxic, Protect, and Explosion.

Relicanth is also a fair check to Metang, although it's more susceptible to being removed by Earthquake. Although Metang can remove all of them bar Relicanth with a well-timed Explosion, trading Metang isn't always ideal, making it an overall unreliable way to deal with them. These foes can retaliate with consistent damage from Surf and Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Pokemon like Chimecho, Sableye, and Torkoal can switch into at least one of Metang's moves with ease. In particular, Hidden Power Fire + Heal Bell Chimecho prevents defensive variants of Metang from handling it as reliably. Nonetheless, Choice Band-boosted Meteor Mash handily deals with the former two, while Earthquake gives Torkoal problems. Additionally, Toxic severely hampers their longevity and can force Chimecho into giving up momentum by using Heal Bell.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Diglett can trap Metang and KO it with Earthquake after some chip damage so long as it doesn't have a Speed boost from Agility.

Toxic lets Metang cripple bulky Water-types like Wailord, Pelipper, and Whiscash, which switch into its primary attacks with ease. Protect is great for racking up poison damage and scouting Choice item Pokemon such as Relicanth and Murkrow. Explosion is an alternative to Protect that lets Metang remove problematic foes for its teammates, although due to Metang's lack of Attack investment, it may require decent chip damage to do so. 252 HP EVs and 228 Special Defense EVs let Metang avoid the 2HKO from defensive Chimecho's +1 Hidden Power Fire, while the Defense EVs help it pivot into attacks from Normal- and Flying-types like Raticate and Pidgeot.

As Metang draws in defensive Water-types very frequently, it's usually wise to double switch to a teammate that can handle a predicted switch into such a foe.

Agility lets Metang serve as a late-game sweeper and outspeed Pokemon such as Raticate, Haunter, and Pikachu. Protect and Toxic are alternatives to Agility that aid Metang in wallbreaking; Protect provides it with insurance against Choice Band Pokemon like Relicanth and Pidgeot that only have one attack to threaten Metang with, while Toxic cripples Pokemon like Sableye and Pelipper. 124 Speed EVs allow Metang to outspeed base 65 Speed Pokemon like Roselia and defensive Flareon; the remaining EVs with an Adamant nature maximize Metang's Attack and improve its bulk somewhat.

If using Metang as more of a wallbreaker rather than a sweeper, Pokemon such as Huntail and Pupitar that appreciate it pressuring Pokemon such as Wailord and Whiscash with Explosion are ideal.

Choice Band-boosted Explosion essentially lets Metang remove any foe that isn't resistant or immune to it, with bulky Water-types being a common target. Sleep Talk is beneficial for leading with Metang, letting it absorb Venomoth's Sleep Powder, although Toxic is a fine alternative so Metang can cripple bulky Water-types. Maximum Speed investment is necessary so Metang can outspeed Sunny Day Bellossom outside of sun. Maximum Attack with an Adamant nature and Choice Band allows Metang to 2HKO defensive Chimecho and Sableye.

Although Earthquake can generate decent damage against Wailord and Whiscash, particularly with Spikes support, Explosion is a guaranteed way to remove them, so long as it connects. However, be careful with your timing of it; if Metang's defensive properties are helpful to check a Pokemon like Haunter or Pidgeot, it may be more beneficial to keep chipping away with Earthquake or cripple them with Toxic if you opt to run it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Spikes from Glalie or Roselia is extremely beneficial, as it makes breaking through Wailord and Whiscash with Earthquake less of a daunting task. Roselia is also great because it can threaten heavy damage to Water-types and paralyze faster Pokemon like Murkrow and Pidgeot with Stun Spore. Late-game sweepers such as Huntail, Calm Mind Chimecho, and Salac or Petaya Berry Haunter benefit from Metang's wallbreaking; in particular, Huntail enjoys having Wailord removed by Metang's Explosion, while Chimecho and Haunter appreciate Sableye and opposing Chimecho being heavily pressured.</p>"
