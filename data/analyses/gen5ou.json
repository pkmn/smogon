    "overview": "<p>Deprived of consistent sun following the Chlorophyll + Drought ban, Venusaur is trapped in a tier it no longer belongs in. It can still be used on non-Drought teams as a way to \"countersweep\" opposing sun teams, but considering sun teams are almost always stall oriented, Venusaur is not exactly a great answer to them. Being forced to manually set its own sun if not facing a Drought team and then having to find turns to set up Growth to be threatening means the effort-to-reward ratio is way too imbalanced to merit using Venusaur in most situations. Outside of sun, Venusaur is outclassed by Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Celebi in pretty much all aspects despite sporting nice balanced stats and the ability to check Keldeo.</p>",
    "sets": {"Sun \"Sweeper\"": {"description": "<p>Venusaur can be used on a dedicated manual sun team, or on any other non-Drought using team, as a late-game sweeper. If using it on a dedicated manual sun team, you can replace Sunny Day with Sludge Bomb to give Venusaur a bit more coverage. Growth is needed so Venusaur has enough power to threaten bulkier Pokemon like Tentacruel, Landorus-T, and Celebi. Giga Drain is Venusaur's most reliable STAB move and allows it to threaten Pokemon like Keldeo, Politoed, Tyranitar, and Excadrill even outside of sun. Hidden Power Fire provides the best two-move coverage with Giga Drain, becomes a pseudo-STAB move in the sun, and allows Venusaur to blow through Ferrothorn and Scizor; however, Sludge Bomb is far stronger and gives Venusaur another reliable STAB move outside of sun to threaten Pokemon like Latios, Hydreigon, Breloom, and Thundurus-T.</p>"}},

  "Clefable": {
    "overview": "<p>Blessed with the ability Magic Guard, Clefable is a serviceable support Pokemon in BW OU with an immunity to the widespread residual damage sources in the tier. In a metagame defined by permanent sand and rain-boosted Scald, Clefable differentiates itself from other special walls through its passive longevity and—most importantly in a tier with Spikes Skarmory and Ferrothorn—little reliance on Rapid Spin support. Utilizing these traits, Clefable easily finds entry points on many passive Pokemon and disrupts opposing teams with tools such as Knock Off and Thunder Wave.</p> <p>That said, Clefable's lack of resistances and middling stat spread is exploitable in a generation also renowned for offensive power creep. Compared with other dedicated special walls such as Blissey, Clefable's bulk doesn't hold up in the face of more powerful wallbreakers such as Thundurus-T, Choice Specs Latios, and boosted Volcarona. A reliance on Thunder Wave to drive progress also makes Clefable exploitable by the wide range of offensive Ground-types in BW OU. A sole weakness to Fighting, similarly, is a limitation for Clefable considering the introduction of Keldeo and Terrakion as well as the widespread use of Focus Blast and Superpower as coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Clefable has access to Stealth Rock, and this is sometimes an option to free up a slot on otherwise dedicated Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T and Gliscor, which can instead go more offensive routes. Clefable has strong matchups as a Stealth Rock setter against Starmie and Tentacruel, which can be enticing. However, this trade often comes at huge expense no matter which moveslot is dropped to facilitate Stealth Rock, as any Clefable lacking Knock Off is fodder for Excadrill, while any Clefable lacking Thunder Wave is exploitable by every wallbreaker in the tier. These same issues apply for all of Clefable's other moveset options.</p> <p>Encore is a niche support move that more directly inhibits Calm Mind Reuniclus than Thunder Wave, as well as helping Clefable more easily beat some defensive Pokemon, locking them into the status move they used on switch-in. Clefable also has access to Wish and Heal Bell to support partners, but these are hindered by its middling HP stat and anti-synergy with the status absorption of Magic Guard, respectively. Trick + Choice Scarf and Trick + Sticky Barb sets have potential at lead but again suffer from losing one of Knock Off or Thunder Wave.</p> <p>As a Gen 1 Normal-type, Clefable has access to a deep attacking movepool that contains the likes of Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, Charge Beam, Grass Knot, and Focus Blast as well as access to boosting moves, including Calm Mind and Cosmic Power. It may be tempting to craft Clefable as a late-game boosting sweeper with combinations of these tools, but, by and large, they are outclassed by other options, mostly notably Reuniclus, which boasts a better STAB option, defensive typing, and stat spread.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: With a middling defensive stat spread, Clefable can't stand up to many of the tier's stronger wallbreakers, especially those that run Fighting-type moves. Although they are deterred from switching in directly by threat of Thunder Wave, Terrakion and Keldeo are particularly good punishers of Clefable that threaten OHKOs with Choice-item boosted Fighting-type attacks while also having Substitute and setup sets that can take advantage of Thunder Wave. Special mentions also go to Breloom and Conkeldurr, which fear the risk of Thunder Wave less with Poison Heal and Guts, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Thunder Wave-immune Pokemon</strong>: The best pivots against Clefable are often Thunder Wave-immune, and there's no shortage of strong Ground-types in the tier. Landorus-T and Garchomp switch safely into any sets lacking Ice Beam, assuming they are happy to lose their item. With access to reliable recovery, Hippowdon and Gastrodon can tolerate losing Leftovers and can enter PP draining stalemates with Clefable. Notably, Mamoswine is resistant to even Ice Beam with Thick Fat and threatens Clefable with both of its STAB moves and Choice Band Superpower. Excadrill fears Knock Off more than most other options in this category, but, supported by Rotom-W for safe entry from Volt Switch, it is a thorn in the side of Clefable. Gliscor, particularly Swords Dance sets, is the biggest threat for Clefable, as it is completely safe against any non-Ice Beam set, as well as threatening to sweep against many of the compositions Clefable finds itself on. Thundurus-T's Electric immunity through Volt Absorb makes it a good pivot into Clefable, which it can threaten with Focus Blast or Nasty Plot-boosted Thunder.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt blocks Clefable from spreading paralysis and recovering, making it far more exploitable. Taunt Jellicent can allow safe entry for teammates free from the risk of Thunder Wave, though most sets are unable to damage Clefable directly. Magma Storm + Taunt Heatran turns the Clefable matchup on its head and can handily trap and remove it for teammates.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: With a strong reliance on Thunder Wave and Knock Off, Clefable is naturally checked by the move Substitute. Substitute Terrakion and Keldeo find setup opportunities by forcing out Clefable while also lowering the threat of Thunder Wave. Pokemon with access to 101 HP Substitute are particularly strong against Clefable due to its high usage of Seismic Toss—Substitute Excadrill and Kyurem-B both take advantage of Clefable in this way, while Substitute + Baton Pass Celebi is less directly threatening but can provide safe passage for a teammate.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Clefable's standard role in BW OU is that of disruptor, utilizing its easy entry points on passive walls and causing chaos with a combination of moves that lack good switch-ins—Thunder Wave and Knock Off. Thunder Wave stops Clefable from being exploited by opposing offense, deterring powerful wallbreakers such as Keldeo, Terrakion, and Kyurem-B from switching in; therefore, the opponent is forced to pivot indirectly to avoid having their best offensive tools being crippled. Thunder Wave has wider utility, too—even against defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory or slower setup threats such as Reuniclus, paralysis is a huge limiter that reduces the likelihood of successive recovery moves and makes them more easily broken by teammates. Thunder Wave also eases many of Clefable's one-on-one matchups including versus Tyranitar, Magnezone, and Heatran, where a fast Soft-Boiled and waiting for a 25% full paralysis drives the odds in Clefable's favor. Knock Off partners well with Thunder Wave by being a particularly good punisher to Ground-types that try to pivot through their paralysis immunity, especially Excadrill, which struggles to consistently remove entry hazards without its Leftovers. Knock Off is also strong against other defensive Pokemon that glean their longevity from Leftovers, particularly Politoed and Jirachi.</p> <p>The main decision to be made when crafting teams with support Clefable is in the selection of its lone attacking move. Seismic Toss is broadly more consistent, hitting an even 100 damage with 32 PP, making it a reliable way of depleting the 16 PP from recovery moves on opposing defensive Pokemon. However, in choosing Seismic Toss, the set is fully exploitable by Gliscor, which already switches into both Thunder Wave and Knock Off, and it just as worryingly makes Clefable a setup opportunity for Lum Berry Dragonite. Offensive Ground-types that are less item-reliant, such as Swords Dance Garchomp, also happily trade Seismic Toss damage to generate setup chances. The solution for both of these issues is Ice Beam, though this comes at the cost of less consistent damage output against Steel-types and Tyranitar and suffers from reduced PP.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread leans towards Clefable's Special Defense, in line with its role as a Scald absorber and disruptor of bulky Water-types. 252 HP and 184 Special Defense EVs ensure Clefable is never 2HKOed by Modest Heatran Magma Storm after Leftovers and almost never OHKOed by Latios's +1 Dragon Fang Draco Meteor, the strongest single move Latios is ever likely to fire. With these benchmarks met, the remaining EVs aim to improve Clefable's consistency against some of its more marginal matchups—12 Speed EVs make Clefable faster than 0 Speed Tyranitar, allowing it to get a faster Thunder Wave or Soft-Boiled and avoid the 2HKO from Superpower. 60 Defense EVs ensure Clefable will always survive an unboosted Keldeo's Secret Sword, as well as improving Clefable's odds into against defensive Ground-types, including giving support Landorus-T only a 0.4% chance to 2HKO with Earthquake.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clefable's strongest differentiation over other similar special walls lies in its residual damage immunity, including Spikes. As a result, Clefable is best utilized on teams that minimize their Spikes weaknesses and therefore avoid requiring a spinner. If the team is taken in a direction that requires Rapid Spin support, it is likely that Clefable becomes a less favorable option compared to the likes of Blissey or Chansey. With this in mind, Clefable's main partners in crime are themselves Spikes-immune.</p> <p>Physically defensive Skarmory forms a strong two-Pokemon defensive core with Clefable, helping to cover its weakness to strong Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Clefable complements Skarmory by luring in and crippling Excadrill with Knock Off, helping Skarmory to win the entry hazard game long-term. Bronzong is a similar option, lacking Spikes but gaining an Ice resistance that helps cover Mamoswine.</p> <p>Clefable also pairs well with Pokemon that take advantage of its Knock Off- and Thunder Wave-spreading as well as the recovery PP draining it can facilitate. Among the best wincons for Clefable teams is Calm Mind Reuniclus, which appreciates moving first, finding setup opportunities against paralyzed foes, and taking advantage of Steel-types like Jirachi and Excadrill that have been hit by Knock Off. Reuniclus also supports Clefable by being one of the sturdiest physical Fighting-resistant Pokemon in the tier, making it a good pivot against the likes of Terrakion.</p> <p>Ground-type Stealth Rock setters make great partners—Landorus-T and Gliscor are efficient at trading Stealth Rock in the lead slot and synergize well with Spikes-immune strategies. Hippowdon is grounded but can offset its Spikes weakness with Slack Off and provides Sand Stream to synergize with Clefable's Knock Off.</p> <p>Latias and Latios have great defensive synergy with Clefable, serving as strong defensive switch-ins against the offensive rain threats such as Keldeo and Thundurus-T, while Clefable nullifies rain's defensive core of Politoed, Ferrothorn, and Tentacruel. Clefable's paralysis spreading also helps Latios and Latias break some of their defensive counterplay, such as specially defensive Skarmory.</p>"

  "Alakazam": {
    "overview": "<p>Alakazam is one of the best Pokemon in the metagame. It's the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the entire tier, outspeeding even Latios and Keldeo. Its strength and many coverage options in Focus Blast, Grass Knot, Signal Beam, and Hidden Power Ice let it threaten many common Pokemon, being especially destructive alongside Spikes, which quickly wears down Pokemon that can take these attacks. Encore and Thunder Wave allow it to punish defensive and offensive answers that could otherwise set up on it, like Calm Mind Reuniclus and Volcarona lacking Lum Berry. Lastly, Magic Guard enables an extremely reliable Focus Sash set that can revenge kill or cripple any one threat, beating Tyranitar if it hits Focus Blast twice. It can even run Life Orb without recoil to become a stronger wallbreaker that rips through defensive teams without as much need for prior damage. However, Alakazam can struggle to break through the opposing team without prior damage, especially if running Focus Sash, due to many Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Latios taking at least one hit to consume its Focus Sash or OHKO. It can also be properly walled if running the wrong coverage move, like by Reuniclus if lacking Signal Beam or Shadow Ball, Gastrodon if not running Grass Knot, and Gliscor if lacking Hidden Power Ice. It's also quite vulnerable to Pursuit from Chople Berry Tyranitar and Scizor, especially the former if Alakazam lacks or misses Focus Blast.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off can punish switch-ins like Jirachi, Rotom-W, and Ferrothorn by removing their passive recovery, letting Alakazam and its Psychic-type partners more easily overwhelm them with entry hazards up. However, these Pokemon can usually be worn down regardless. Psych Up in tandem with Psyshock and Focus Sash beats Calm Mind Reuniclus and can sweep hyper offense teams by copying Quiver Dance boosts from Volcarona. However, it's unlikely to be useful, since many hyper offense teams have priority moves to revenge kill Alakazam back. Taunt prevents recovery and support moves from Pokemon like Reuniclus, Skarmory, and Gastrodon, allowing Alakazam to keep them at low health and finish them off itself or let a partner pressure them later. However, most of the Pokemon Alakazam would use Taunt on fear its coverage and can attack it back after being inflicted with Taunt. Encore also already punishes these utility moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Chople Berry Tyranitar can take any one hit from Alakazam and Pursuit trap it to at least break its Focus Sash. However, it will go down if Focus Sash Alakazam hits Focus Blast twice and is worn down by Grass Knot. It also tends to get weakened by Latios and Reuniclus, making it unable to take Focus Blast. Scizor is able to take a hit and Pursuit trap Alakazam to break its Focus Sash, even outspeeding it with Bullet Punch or if running Choice Scarf. However, Focus Blast can 2HKO it without bulk investment and Hidden Power Fire OHKOes.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf users like Keldeo, Latios, Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Scizor can break Alakazam's Focus Sash and KO if it's already broken. Garchomp can get around Alakazam's Focus Sash with Dual Chop, while Landorus-T and Rotom-W can break the Focus Sash and switch out with their pivot moves to revenge kill Alakazam later. Priority users like Dragonite and Scizor can also move first and revenge kill it. However, all of these Pokemon can be threatened by coverage and can't KO if Alakazam's Focus Sash is still intact.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that can take at least one hit from Alakazam, like Chansey, Cresselia, Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, Heatran, Hippowdon if lacking Grass Knot, and Celebi if lacking Signal Beam, can break its Focus Sash and use it to gain momentum, status it, or set up entry hazards. However, they are easily worn down by entry hazards, sand, and Alakazam's teammates and struggle to come into the Life Orb set consistently. Sableye deserves a special mention, taking all of Alakazam's attacks well and having priority Recover with Prankster to work around its slower Speed stat.</p> <p><strong>Jirachi</strong>: Specially defensive Jirachi can take repeated hits thanks to its bulk, ability to passively recover in sand, and recovery in Wish. However, it can be forced into Wish cycles from entry hazards and Alakazam's common teammates easily wearing it down. Hidden Power Fire and Life Orb variants are especially able to pressure Jirachi.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psyshock can be used over Psychic to better damage Pokemon like specially defensive Politoed, specially defensive Rotom-W, and Volcarona while also OHKOing Terrakion in sand and Tentacruel after Stealth Rock. Hidden Power Ice lets Alakazam threaten Pokemon like Gliscor, Landorus-T, Dragonite, Garchomp, and Latios. Focus Blast hits Tyranitar and Steel-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill. Grass Knot is a good alternative to hit Jellicent and Gastrodon harder, accurately KO Mamoswine, and more reliably wear down Tyranitar, especially Chople Berry sets, on the switch. Hidden Power Fire can be run with Grass Knot to hit Jirachi, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Scizor harder than Focus Blast, maintain coverage for most other Steel-types, and have better accuracy and PP. However, it also makes Heatran a complete wall, does less damage to Excadrill and Magnezone, and makes Alakazam run an imperfect Speed IV, leaving it outsped by opposing Alakazam lacking the move. Encore punishes Pokemon like Reuniclus, Gliscor, and Politoed for using status or setup moves, which can turn the momentum of the game. Thunder Wave is more geared towards punishing offensive threats, crippling Pokemon like Volcarona and Dragonite lacking Lum Berry while also beating other Alakazam. Encore and Thunder Wave should only be used with Focus Sash for reliability. Shadow Ball and Signal Beam hit Psychic-types like Reuniclus, Starmie, and Slowking hard, with Signal Beam hitting Celebi and Tyranitar harder, while Shadow Ball hits Jellicent. Life Orb sets can use Substitute to punish switches and block revenge killers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature is used to outspeed common Pokemon like Latios, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Starmie, and Keldeo. Focus Sash is the preferred item to make Alakazam much more consistent, better enable support moves, and beat Chople Berry Tyranitar with a Focus Blast 2HKO. Life Orb can be used on teams that don't need support moves and can handle most revenge killers, giving Alakazam enough power to 2HKO specially defensive Rotom-W, Bold Politoed, and Jellicent after Stealth Rock and KO common Pokemon that pivot into it, like Heatran and Latios, with less prior damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alakazam fits on sand teams that utilize Spikes, benefitting greatly from them wearing down many of its checks, while these teams appreciate its Speed and Focus Sash safety net. Tyranitar sets sand, sets Stealth Rock with a Chople Berry set, and offers Pursuit to break other Alakazam's Focus Sash and trap Reuniclus and Jellicent. It can also wear down and punish potential checks like Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Skarmory with Fire Blast. Alakazam works very well alongside other Psychic-types like Reuniclus and Latios, since they can overwhelm their shared checks, mainly Tyranitar, Heatran, and Ferrothorn. BoltBeam Reuniclus can easily sweep late-game once Alakazam wears down Tyranitar and Excadrill, while Reuniclus can more reliably counter Pokemon like Gliscor and Ferrothorn and wears down Pokemon like Skarmory and Politoed. Latios switches into Water- and Grass-types like Keldeo, Politoed, and Breloom, with Colbur Berry Latios wearing down shared Psychic-type checks particularly well, forcing entry hazard damage with Roar and hitting Chople Berry Tyranitar into KO range of Focus Blast or Grass Knot. This preserves Alakazam's Focus Sash. Ferrothorn and Skarmory can set up Spikes and provide key defensive utility. Ferrothorn can switch into Dragon-types like Latios and Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Superpower, as well as Water-types like Starmie and Politoed, and further wear down the opponent's team with Stealth Rock and Knock Off. Skarmory counters Dragonite lacking Fire Punch, Scizor, and Ground-types like Excadrill, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. Fighting-types like Keldeo, Breloom, and Terrakion can take out Steel-types and Tyranitar while also wearing down Pokemon like Gastrodon and Rotom-W so Alakazam can more easily sweep. Alakazam can keep Calm Mind Reuniclus from setting up on them with Encore. Ground-types like Gliscor, Gastrodon, Landorus-T, and Excadrill check Tyranitar and Steel-types like Heatran, Jirachi, and Excadrill and provide various forms of support. Gliscor can provide Stealth Rock and Knock Off to wear down switch-ins and bring Alakazam onto the field safely with U-turn, Gastrodon checks Electric- and Water-types like Thundurus-T and Politoed, Excadrill pressures Reuniclus and checks Electric- and Dragon-types, and Landorus-T can set Stealth Rock and pivot Alakazam in safely with U-turn. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock, spread status, check Dragon- and Steel-types like Latios and Ferrothorn, and wear down Tyranitar. It benefits from Alakazam revenge killing Fighting-types like Terrakion, Breloom, and Keldeo and punishing Pokemon that can set up on it, like Dragonite and Reuniclus.</p>"

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<p>Though Zapdos competes with Rotom-W, it has several notable traits that separate it. Zapdos can threaten Ferrothorn while also checking Breloom and Scizor due to its access to Heat Wave. Its access to reliable recovery in Roost grants it much more longevity than Rotom-W, despite its vulnerability to Stealth Rock and sand. These traits allow it to see some use on sand teams as a Ground-immune Volt Switch user with good longevity. However, despite these promising traits, Rotom-W is generally used over Zapdos due to its Stealth Rock neutrality and resistance to Water- and Ice-type moves, allowing it to check Pokemon like Keldeo and Mamoswine. Zapdos also frequently gets forced out by strong special attackers like Latios, Alakazam, Reuniclus, Thundurus-T, and Volcarona. Outside of sand teams, Zapdos faces heavy competition with Thundurus-T, who is faster, stronger, and is immune to Electric courtesy of Volt Absorb.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic cripples checks like Gastrodon, Tyranitar, Latios, and Thundurus-T. However, it forces Zapdos to give up Heat Wave or Hidden Power Ice, both of which are important to check what it's supposed to. A Substitute + Roost set may seem appealing to punish switches and PP stall Pokemon like Tyranitar, but, like Toxic, Zapdos would have to give up crucial coverage. An offensive set can act like Thundurus-T with better defensive utility. However, it's not worth using since it's weaker, slower, and has worse coverage than Thundurus-T while giving up Zapdos's main niche of checking strong physical attackers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Stealth Rock wears Zapdos down and puts it into range of attacks it could otherwise survive, like Tyranitar's Crunch. Zapdos is also vulnerable to status, particularly poison and burn, from Pokemon like Heatran, Jellicent, and Rotom-Wash, which exacerbates Zapdos's inability to passively heal under sand.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Attacks</strong>: Kyurem-B, Mamoswine, and Cloyster force Zapdos out with their STAB attacks and use it switching out to set up Substitute and Shell Smash. However, Kyurem-B has to be wary of Discharge's paralysis chance, Mamoswine can't take too many Heat Waves, and Cloyster is OHKOed by both Volt Switch and Discharge.</p> <p><strong>Ground-Types</strong>: Gastrodon blocks Volt Switch, takes minimal damage from Hidden Power Ice, has reliable recovery, and can cripple Zapdos with Toxic and burn. Seismitoad similarly walls Zapdos but doesn't have reliable recovery, meaning it can get overwhelmed over the course of a game. Excadrill, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T all have to be wary of Zapdos's coverage but can block Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers like Latios, Reuniclus, Alakazam, Keldeo, Volcarona, and Thundurus-T can come in and force Zapdos out, using it as an opportunity to set up or cripple whatever teammate switches in with Trick and status.</p>",

Tyranitar appreciates Zapdos pivoting it in against Latios and Reuniclus with Volt Switch to more safely Pursuit trap them, while Zapdos covers Breloom, Scizor, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn. Additionally, Tyranitar can set up Stealth Rock to wear down Zapdos's checks. While Hippowdon doesn't benefit from Volt Switch pivoting the same way Tyranitar does, it does check Tyranitar, Thundurus-T, and Terrakion. Excadrill can keep Stealth Rock off the field with Rapid Spin, allowing Zapdos to consistently check Breloom, Scizor, and opposing Excadrill. Gastrodon forms a solid defensive core with Zapdos, as it appreciates Zapdos's ability to check Breloom and Ferrothorn, while it can check Tyranitar, Keldeo, and Thundurus-T. Heatran forms a solid defensive core with Zapdos, able to set Stealth Rock, cripple Tyranitar with burn or poisonToxic, and check Dragon-types like Latios and Kyurem-B, while Zapdos checks Breloom. Ferrothorn checks Dragon- and Water-types like Kyurem-B, Latios, and Starmie, sets entry hazards, and can remove Leftovers from checks like Heatran with Knock Off. Latios checks Keldeo and Thundurus-T, can act as a backup check against Breloom, and is able to keep other faster threats in check with a Choice Scarf set, while Zapdos checks Scizor and pivots it in with Volt Switch. Jellicent checks offensive Fire- and Water-types like Heatran and Keldeo, burns checks like Tyranitar with Will-O-Wisp, and appreciates Zapdos's ability to check Pokemon like Breloom and Gliscor.</p>"

  "Milotic": {
    "overview": "<p>Milotic finds a good niche in the tier through its good defensive stats, pure-Water typing, and reliable recovery. Milotic is also not overly passive due to Scald threatening a burn on switch-ins such as Ferrothorn and Tentacruel, allowing it to blanket check various threats such as Tyranitar, Gliscor, Landorus-T, Heatran, Scizor, Mamoswine, and Keldeo. However, Milotic is heavily susceptible to all forms of residual damage, often forcing it into using Recover and becoming relatively passive. The likes of Alakazam and Jirachi can easily wear it down and overwhelm it, as can threats it is supposed to check such as Mamoswine and Keldeo, with Heatran and Keldeo even possibly using Toxic to cripple Milotic. Its power is somewhat lacking against bulkier threats like Reuniclus and Jellicent. Additionally, it faces competition from other bulky Water-types such as Jellicent, Rotom-W, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon, as Jellicent performs a similar niche with the added benefit of blocking Rapid Spin, Rotom-W acts as a stronger check against the likes of Excadrill and Mamoswine while keeping momentum with Volt Switch, Seismitoad is immune to Electric and Water while having more utility options such as Stealth Rock and Knock Off, and Gastrodon acts as a stronger check against Water-types such as Politoed and Keldeo while also boasting an Electric immunity.</p>",

Thundurus-T can easily outspeed and OHKO Milotic with its STAB Thunder, while Electric-type moves from the likes of Magnezone, Reuniclus, Starmie, and Jirachi can 2HKO Milotic after minor chip damage. However, these Pokemon need to exercise caution while switching in, as most don't appreciate either burn or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn and poison force Milotic into using Recover more often and prevent it from properly checking what it is supposed to. Paralysis makes Milotic easier to exploit for offensive Pokemon such as Breloom. This being said, Refresh variants of Milotic are capable of handling status.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Passive damage from entry hazards and sand can eventually overwhelm Milotic and force it into using Recover, somewhat compromising its defensive utility and making it relatively passive. Faster offensive threats such as Terrakion, Alakazam, Latios, and Volcarona can take advantage of Milotic after it has been worn down.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulkier Water-types such as Jellicent, Politoed, Tentacruel, and Gastrodon can easily take Milotic’s hits and punish it with status. Jellicent in particular can also use Taunt to completely shut down Milotic. However, none of these options like being inflicted with status from Scald or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Powerful setup sweepers such as Agility Thundurus, Calm Mind Reuniclus, and Calm Mind Jirachi can use Milotic as setup fodder if it lacks the rare Haze or Dragon Tail and eventually overwhelm it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Ferrothorn can switch into anything Milotic can throw at it and remove its Leftovers with Knock Off, heavily hindering its longevity, freely set entry hazards on it, or 2HKO it with Power Whip. However, despite its Toxic immunity, Ferrothorn dislikes burn, meaning it has to switch in carefully. Celebi can handle any attack Milotic throws at it and can force it out with Giga Drain. It can also heal off Milotic’s status thanks to Natural Cure. Breloom can set up on Milotic and overwhelm it with its STAB moves while only truly fearing Ice Beam.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam is the ideal coverage move for this set, nailing Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Dragonite, and Salamence, as well as hitting Breloom, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. Toxic is great for preventing bulky Water-types such as Jellicent, Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Politoed variants that lack Refresh from switching in for free. Refresh is a great option to alleviate Milotic's vulnerability to status at the cost of losing momentum when still at low health, becoming more vulnerable to the likes of Calm Mind Latios and Quiver Dance Volcarona and making it difficult to achieve progress against bulky Water-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set fully invests in Defense to better fend off threats such as Mamoswine and Tyranitar. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack to guarantee an OHKO on Salamence with Ice Beam.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Milotic is mostly featured on sand teams, where it acts as a defensive pivot that can easily keep itself healthy while spreading status. Milotic has great defensive synergy with Tyranitar, as Milotic retains good longevity in sand while checking Keldeo and Gliscor. In return, Tyranitar can Pursuit trap threats that can overload Milotic such as Latios, Alakazam, and Reuniclus and can set Stealth Rock and sand, bringing more residual damage to work in tandem with the status Milotic spreads. Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory appreciate Milotic switching into Fire-type moves from Pokemon such as Heatran and Tyranitar. Both of these Steel-types can bring even more residual damage to the table with Spikes, and they also check Latios and Excadrill, respectively. In a similar manner, Dragon-types such as Latios, Garchomp, and Substitute + Dragon Dance Dragonite appreciate Milotic taking Ice-type moves from the likes of Mamoswine, Heatran, and Keldeo. Latios in particular works very well with Milotic, as Choice Scarf sets can revenge kill Pokemon Milotic is unable to handle such as Volcarona and Alakazam. Breloom is able to absorb status for Milotic due to Poison Heal and check the likes of Rotom-W. Gliscor heavily appreciates Milotic taking Ice- and Water-type attacks, and in return, it provides practical status immunity with Poison Heal, an Electric immunity, Stealth Rock, and Knock Off to remove foes' Leftovers, further accentuating Milotic's chip damage. Landorus-T can set Stealth Rock and brings an Electric immunity while checking Terrakion and Excadrill. It can also use U-turn to allow Milotic to switch in with more ease more easily. Rapid Spin support from Excadrill is crucial, as entry hazards are one of the most consistent ways to chip Milotic and make its job difficult. Heatran can also set Stealth Rock and spread more status in Toxic and burn in tandem with Milotic, and it can check Thundurus-T, Jirachi, and Latios while also being a better check to Volcarona. In return, Milotic is able to stomach a solid amount of the Ground- and Water-type coverage within the tier. Magnezone can trap and remove Steel-type Pokemon such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill if it runs Air Balloon, preventing the former two from setting up entry hazards—further helping Milotic’s longevity—and heavily appreciating Milotic switching in on Ground- and Fire-type attacks from Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Heatran. Celebi appreciates Milotic coming in on Fire- and Ice-type attacks and can perform as a more consistent Keldeo check and Water-resistant Pokemon.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Infernape may seem like it holds a niche to threaten common Pokemon on sand teams like Tyranitar, Gastrodon, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory, using its powerful STAB moves and good coverage in Grass Knot, Hidden Power Ice, and U-turn. However, it's too frail, easy to wear down, and weak to do this properly. It's vulnerable to all entry hazards and sand and revenge killed by common faster Pokemon like Alakazam, Keldeo, Latios, and Choice Scarf variants of Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W. Further, it lacks the firepower to OHKO common offensive Pokemon like Thundurus-T, Keldeo, and Latios or the bulky sand Pokemon it's meant to threaten, like Chople Berry Tyranitar, Gastrodon, and Gliscor. They often OHKO it in return, and the same is true for other miscellaneous threats that it can't threaten much at all, like Reuniclus and Rotom-W. It's also unable to threaten rain teams significantly due to common Pokemon on them like Politoed and Tentacruel easily taking its hits. Infernape is outclassed by the other Fighting-types in the tier, including Keldeo, Terrakion, and Breloom, as a result of their better offenses, defensive utility, set versatility, and ability to fit on teams.</p>",

Tornadus is an offensive Flying-type superior to Staraptor in every way due to its better Speed tier and set versatility, and Landorus-T, Scizor, and Dragonite further outclass Staraptor as a physical attacker due to their better defensive utility and similar offensive prowess.</p>", "sets": {"Choice Band": {}}, "credits": {"writtenBy": [{"user_id": 515642, "username": "Gamer1234556"}], "teams": [{"name": "Grammar checked by", "members": [{"user_id": 517429, "username": "Adeleine"}]}]}},
  "Seismitoad": {
    "overview": "<p>Seismitoad has an interesting niche in BW OU as an anti-metagame supporter that can stop VoltTurn users such as Rotom-W. Refresh is the move Seismitoad's counterpart, Gastrodon, wishes it had, as blocking Will-O-Wisp is normally enough to prevent VoltTurn teams' progress. Seismitoad is also capable of walling the vast majority of the bulky Water-types in the metagame, making it a valid choice for some sand and rain teams. Its biggest problem is its lack of recovery outside of Leftovers and Rest, since even its good defensive stats are not perfect and switching into the wrong move is normally enough to put Seismitoad into KO range of the biggest OU threats, like Latios, Garchomp, and Alakazam.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earth Power is similar to Earthquake and doesn't require a Speed-reducing nature, but it has a little less power, which can be an issue against Substitute Kyurem or Calm Mind Keldeo. Ice Punch is an option to not be setup fodder for Dragonite, Garchomp, and specially defensive Gliscor, and to deal some damage to Breloom, Celebi, and Amoonguss, but a valuable moveslot is used for it, and Seismitoad isn't OHKOing the Dragon- and Flying-types or 2HKOing the Grass-types anyway. Rest can be used over Refresh, but Seismitoad will never have an opportunity to wake up, so Heal Bell or Aromatherapy support is needed. Gastro Acid is a surprise option that has potential, since it nullifies Breloom and Gliscor's Poison Heal, Reuniclus's Magic Guard, and the Water immunities of Gastrodon, Jellicent, and opposing Seismitoad, but it is difficult to find a moveslot for it. A specially defensive or mixed defensive set is possible to better handle hits from Alakazam, Thundurus-T, and offensive Starmie, but Seismitoad will usually be taking strong physical hits, so having more Defense is normally ideal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Poison Heal Breloom doesn't care about anything Seismitoad can do except for the rare Gastro Acid and can use it as setup fodder for Swords Dance, Bulk Up, or Substitute. Ferrothorn threatens Seismitoad away with Power Whip, which lets it safely set Spikes or Stealth Rock or use Knock Off, but it's deathly afraid of getting burned and having its item removed. Celebi can shrug off a Scald burn with Natural Cure, threaten a KO with Leaf Storm or Giga Drain, set up Stealth Rock, or use Seismitoad as setup fodder for Nasty Plot, Swords Dance, or Substitute. Amoonguss threatens an immediate KO with Giga Drain and can heal away the passive damage with Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: Storm Drain Gastrodon can use Recover to outlast Seismitoad. Jellicent can heal HP with Water Absorb, burn Seismitoad with Will-O-Wisp, deal significant damage with Night Shade, and shut it down with Taunt. Opposing Seismitoad can beat your Seismitoad if they have Knock Off or Earthquake, or the rarer Gastro Acid, and yours doesn't. Toxicroak can set up Swords Dance or Substitute versus any Seismitoad that doesn't have Ground-type coverage. Defensive Starmie can use Rapid Spin against Seismitoad forever if it lacks Toxic and can also threaten it away with Psychic, Psyshock, or Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Reuniclus can use Seismitoad to set up Calm Mind or Trick Room with no penalty outside of the uncommon Knock Off. Latias and Keldeo can easily set up Calm Mind or Substitute versus Seismitoad. With maximum Special Defense investment, Gliscor takes little damage from Scald and can use Seismitoad to set up Swords Dance or remove its item with Knock Off. Dragonite with Substitute and Dragon Dance can freely set up versus any variation of Seismitoad, since even Ice Punch does mediocre damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers like Alakazam, Latios, and Hydreigon threaten a 2HKO with their STAB moves. Thundurus-T and Tornadus threaten an OHKO with Grass Knot but don't want to directly switch into Scald. Kyurem can use Seismitoad to safely set up Substitute and then punish it with its STAB moves. Keldeo can OHKO Seismitoad with Hidden Power Grass or deal great damage with Secret Sword boosted by Choice Specs or Calm Mind. Heatran can grab a surprise KO with Hidden Power Grass or Sunny Day + SolarBeam.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald's most important function is fishing for burns, which lets Seismitoad not be entry hazard fodder for Skarmory and Ferrothorn, since they hate being burned on the switch. Refresh is what makes Seismitoad so valuable, since negating Toxic, Toxic Spikes, and Will-O-Wisp allows Seismitoad to neutralize bulky Water-types like Rotom-W, Politoed, Tentacruel, Milotic, and defensive Starmie. The primary use of Protect is to stack Leftovers recovery and sand damage, but it also lets Seismitoad scout Choice-locked Pokemon like Latios, Tyranitar, and Garchomp. Stealth Rock is an amazing option, as Seismitoad can pressure all spinners with the combination of Scald + Refresh and free up a moveslot for its teammates. Alternatively, Knock Off can make progress by removing items, making foes like Ferrothorn, Refresh Politoed, and opposing Seismitoad unable to regain health with Leftovers. Earthquake can be used to damage other Water-types—especially Keldeo, break Kyurem's Substitute, OHKO Heatran if it's not maximum HP, and damage Toxicroak. However, it lacks any other important targets, since Seismitoad has mediocre offensive stats, and forces it to run a Relaxed nature. Toxic can also be used in the last moveslot to deal with other Water-immune Pokemon, like Gastrodon and Jellicent, and to not be overly dependent on Scald burns to make progress. Dropping Protect for another support move is possible but never recommended, since losing the stability it provides alongside Leftovers hurts Seismitoad a lot in the long run.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>28 Speed EVs are used to outspeed standard specially defensive Heatran. 248 HP and 232 Defense EVs with a Bold nature prevent Seismitoad from being 2HKOed by Jolly Sand Force Excadrill's Earthquake after Protect. If running Earthquake, use 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD with a Relaxed nature.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Do not waste any opportunity to bring Seismitoad safely to the field, since almost every team has a bulky Water-type. Spam Scald against Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Jirachi, and Tentacruel, as burns are the main way for Seismitoad to threaten them. Use Refresh as soon as Seismitoad gets inflicted with status so to not waste any HP. Do not let common Substitute users go unpunished, as Seismitoad attracts them, oftentimes being unable to break the Substitute of Pokemon like Breloom and Keldeo. Going for Scald to burn the foe or outright switching to achieve an advantageous position is best in these scenarios. Avoid using Protect too predictably. If using Stealth Rock, bring Seismitoad in as soon as possible to set it up. If using Knock Off, do not be afraid to predict switches, since its best targets in Ferrothorn, Latios, Jellicent, and Reuniclus love to switch into Seismitoad. Refresh, Stealth Rock, and Knock Off are Seismitoad's advantages over Gastrodon, so it should use them to their fullest.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Seismitoad loves the chip damage sand provides, Tyranitar is one of its best partners, and it also Pursuit traps problematic Psychic-types like Latios and Reuniclus. Pokemon that can deal with Ferrothorn like Heatran, Breloom, Magnezone, and Xatu are a must, since Ferrothorn can use Seismitoad as entry hazard fodder. Xatu especially is an amazing partner for an anti-metagame core, shutting down entry hazard stacking and helping Seismitoad with Reflect support. Magnezone invalidates any free switch in that Ferrothorn or Skarmory tries to grab versus Seismitoad. Because Seismitoad is a bit passive, it loves having Spikes support from Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Skarmory. Offensive Pokemon that can benefit from Seismitoad's ability to nullify Rotom-W like Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Garchomp are also amazing partners. Pokemon that have ways to deal with Reuniclus like Latios, Scizor, Encore Alakazam, and Nasty Plot Celebi are needed on the team. Bulky Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Skarmory can help deal with Adamant Excadrill. Seismitoad can be used in rain structures to neuter Rotom-W, which is normally a nightmare for rain teams. In those, partners like Gyarados, Tentacruel, Scizor, Breloom, Latios, Latias, and Jirachi are good options.</p>"

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>There is no Pokemon in BW OU with the same effectiveness as a supporter as Ferrothorn. With a great defensive typing, good stats, and a fantastic support movepool that includes Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Knock Off, it is an invaluable addition to offensive and defensive teams alike. The ability to absorb powerful hits from and check Dragon-type attackers like Latios, Kyurem-B, Dragonite, and Salamence gives Ferrothorn many opportunities to switch in, as does its ability to take powerful Water-type attacks like Hydro Pump from Choice Specs Keldeo and Starmie. Once in, it can set entry hazards, remove the foe's item, or use either of its two powerful STAB moves. However, it must always watch out for a Scald burn from bulky Water-types and Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W and Jellicent, since being burned greatly reduces its utility. Burn is so fundamental in breaking Ferrothorn that most rain teams spam Scald versus it just to fish for the 30% burn chance. Ferrothorn must also watch out for Trick Latios, since being Choice-locked basically removes it from the game. Its other drawbacks are its Fighting weakness, 4x Fire weakness, and lack of reliable recovery.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shed Shell can be used on more defensive teams to let Ferrothorn Spikes stack with no fear of Magnezone, but the lack of Leftovers recovery cripples its ability to check Pokemon like Choice Specs Latios, and Shed Shell also forces it to play more conservatively versus Knock Off users so it doesn't lose to Magnet Pull. Rocky Helmet can be used on more offensive teams to better punish U-turn from Landorus-T and Rapid Spin from Excadrill and Tentacruel, but normally Ferrothorn gets more use from another item. Chople Berry can be used to survive a hit from Keldeo or Terrakion and KO back with Power Whip, but the lack of Leftovers recovery again makes Ferrothorn struggle in some matches. Protect can be used to stack Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery and scout opposing Choice item users, but it is difficult to fit on Ferrothorn's moveset. Endeavor has some merit on more offensive teams to keep pressuring the opposing team after a couple of entry hazards are down, but this is heavily dependent on good predictions. In the opposite direction, Rest can be used to fully restore Ferrothorn's utility and remove status, since some teams have difficulty in dealing with it outside of stalling for a burn, but in most games Ferrothorn doesn't have the free time necessary to wake up from the sleep. A Impish or Relaxed nature with 48 or 88 Defense EVs can be used to have more balanced defenses, but Ferrothorn normally prefers being able to better enter against Choice Specs Latios. With this in mind, a set with a Careful or Sassy nature and 252 Special Defense EVs to optimize the Latios matchup is possible, but this leaves Ferrothorn a bit vulnerable to Earthquake from Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill. More offensive sets with Choice Band or Swords Dance are possible but not worth using, since this function is better executed by other Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: Magnezone can trap Ferrothorn with Magnet Pull and defeat it in any weather with Hidden Power Fire and Sunny Day or use it as setup fodder with Substitute and Charge Beam.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran resists both of Ferrothorn's STAB moves and threatens it out with a Fire-type move, allowing it to set up Stealth Rock or a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Thundurus-T</strong>: Thundurus-T resists both of Ferrothorn's STAB moves and can safely set up a Substitute versus Ferrothorn that lack Gyro Ball. Further, it can set up with Agility or Nasty Plot versus any Ferrothorn variant and threaten it out with Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Reuniclus</strong>: Reuniclus can set up Calm Mind with almost no risk versus Ferrothorn, since Power Whip isn't a 2HKO. It can also set up Trick Room easily and threaten to KO Ferrothorn with a Life Orb-boosted Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Getting Ferrothorn burned is one of the best ways to deal with it, since burn reduces its Attack stat to mediocre levels and puts it on a timer. Will-O-Wisp users like Rotom-W and Mew threaten Ferrothorn, as do Scald burns, which are the only way for defensive Water-types like Politoed, Tentacruel, and support Starmie to deal with it. Tentacruel deserves a special mention, since Substitute Tentacruel always defeats Ferrothorn if the rain is up. Also, having Spikes on the field heavily reduces the number of times Ferrothorn can switch in, especially if it was hit by Knock Off, reducing its effectiveness as a supporter throughout the game.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Breloom can switch into Ferrothorn, set up a Substitute, and use a boosting move or threaten it out with Drain Punch. However, it must beware of Knock Off and Thunder Wave if its Toxic Orb hasn't activated, as well as Gyro Ball and Worry Seed. Strong Fighting-types like Keldeo and Terrakion threaten an immediate KO with Secret Sword or Close Combat, respectively. Mienshao forces Ferrothorn out immediately with High Jump Kick, and Toxicroak can use Ferrothorn as Substitute fodder, since it can outstall Gyro Ball's PP with rain support.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Moves</strong>: Outside of rain, Fire-types like Volcarona and Victini and Pokemon that can use powerful Fire-type moves like Garchomp, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon can immediately threaten Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Pokemon like Jellicent, Skarmory, and Mew can nullify almost all of Ferrothorn's impact by preventing Spikes, Stealth Rock, or other support moves with Taunt. They are also not bothered by Ferrothorn's attacking moves because of their typings or access to Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Pokemon like Latios and Latias can cripple Ferrothorn by passing it a Choice Specs, Choice Scarf, or Flame Orb.</p> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu's Magic Bounce blocks any entry hazards from Ferrothorn, and it can enter on any of Ferrothorn's moves and outstall it with the combination of Reflect, Roost, and Night Shade.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Since Ferrothorn is the best Spikes user in the tier, Spikes is mandatory on all of its movesets, and the move also gives it something to do after switching in on a foe that can't touch it. Knock Off's main functions are crippling opposing Ferrothorn blocking it from hazard stacking while recovering HP with Leftovers and discouraging Breloom and Gliscor from switching in for fear of having their Toxic Orbs removed. Knock Off also makes Reuniclus and Thundurus-T, two notorious Ferrothorn checks, afraid of switching in directly, since both of them hate losing Leftovers. If your team has other ways of dealing with opposing Ferrothorn, Leech Seed is an option to deal passive damage and heal, but it can be dangerous, since there are a lot of Substitute users in the tier and it gives Grass-types and Magic Guard users a free switch-in. Power Whip and Gyro Ball are Ferrothorn's best attacking options, hitting the majority of the standard metagame for at least neutral damage. Each of these two moves has its merits; the former primarily slams Water-types, such as Rotom-W, Jellicent, Starmie, Politoed, and Keldeo, and punishes Excadrill and Tentacruel that try to use Rapid Spin. The latter is generally more effective against faster Pokemon and those that resist Power Whip such as Latios, Dragonite, Kyurem-B, and Breloom and, unlike Power Whip, it breaks a Substitute from Thundurus-T. Be aware that Gyro Ball has low PP. Because Ferrothorn's Attack stat is less than impressive without any investment, there are several alternatives to running both attacking moves. Stealth Rock is a good option, since Ferrothorn can enter several times in a match to lay entry hazards, and using it also frees up your teammates' moveslots. Worry Seed puts pressure on Gliscor and Breloom that will try to set up on Ferrothorn and wins the matchup against opposing Ferrothorn when used after Knock Off. Worry Seed also lets Ferrothorn escape Magnezone's Magnet Pull; this is most effective in rain, which forces Magnezone to either use a weakened Hidden Power Fire or give Ferrothorn a free Worry Seed turn by using Sunny Day. If those moves are not needed, Thunder Wave has merit as a method of crippling faster powerful threats that often enjoy switching into Ferrothorn, but it doesn't pair well with Gyro Ball.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With a Careful nature, 208 Special Defense EVs optimize Ferrothorn's bulk and let it survive three Draco Meteors from Choice Specs Latios so it has more opportunities to lay Spikes. If using Gyro Ball, then a Sassy nature with 0 Speed IVs is optimal. A Lum Berry or Rawst Berry can be used to nullify a burn from Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp or Politoed's Scald before immediately retaliating with Power Whip.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Let Ferrothorn absorb hard-hitting special moves like Draco Meteor from Latios to have opportunities to lay entry hazards. Use Ferrothorn as an opposing Ferrothorn check if your team has difficulties with it; Knock Off is Ferrothorn's second most important move in this situation. Keeping opposing Ferrothorn from recovering HP via Leftovers is extremely helpful in all games. You can also double switch Ferrothorn into a Pokemon that doesn't like to stomach a Power Whip, like Rotom-W or Politoed, so it can use Spikes or Knock Off freely. Take advantage of Ferrothorn's defensive capabilities early-game to lay entry hazards or cripple opposing Pokemon as quickly as possible. Pay attention to whether Iron Barbs damage can prevent Rapid Spin or U-turn spam from opposing Pokemon. Try to avoid getting Ferrothorn burned, since it reduces a lot of its defensive and support potential by putting it on a timer and making its attacks very weak. Be wary of Tentacruel when the rain is up, as it can easily defeat Ferrothorn if it successfully fishes for a Scald burn, and Substitute Tentacruel can PP stall Power Whip and win the matchup with no trouble at all.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-W adds another Water-type check to the team, especially for Keldeo, and helps Ferrothorn by bringing it in safely via Volt Switch or burning opposing Pokemon like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Excadrill, and opposing Ferrothorn. Other Keldeo checks and switch-ins to Fire-type moves like Jellicent, Tentacruel, Gastrodon, Slowking, and Seismitoad are also very good partners. Jellicent in particular makes an interesting combination with Ferrothorn, since they together resist every attacking type in the game outside of Flying and Ground. Jellicent is also capable of spinblocking after Ferrothorn sets entry hazards. Ferrothorn also benefits from teammates that can scare off the Steel-types that give it trouble, namely Skarmory, Heatran, and Excadrill. Landorus-T and Gliscor are awesome partners, since both can check Excadrill, check Fighting-types like Terrakion, and free up Ferrothorn's Stealth Rock moveslot, letting it to be more effective in the match. Politoed also deserves a special mention, since Ferrothorn has formidable defensive synergy with rain teams; its Fire weakness is halved, and it is an awesome Dragon sponge for rain teams. Hard-hitting Pokemon like Latios, Alakazam, Reuniclus, Thundurus-T, Keldeo, Terrakion, Garchomp, and Tyranitar love the extra damage Spikes provides, which makes most 3HKOs become 2HKOs and 2HKOs become OHKOs. Latios particularly is one of Ferrothorn's best teammates, helping keep Keldeo and Heatran in check and loving the Spikes and Knock Off support Ferrothorn provides.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ferrothorn is the primary Stealth Rock setter on rain teams, and Power Whip will seriously threaten bulky Water-types like Rotom-W, Jellicent, Politoed, and Tentacruel. Gyro Ball lets Ferrothorn threaten Pokemon that resist Power Whip, including Latios, Dragonite, and Breloom. Its ability to do so against the last two is important because they can set up on Ferrothorn without the move, especially since they can use Substitute to protect themselves from any other option Ferrothorn can have. Knock Off is an irritating move in general to switch into, as bulky Pokemon treasure the passive recovery from Leftovers and offensive Pokemon would rather have their items that give them extra power or Speed. Spikes are important because they push damage into bulky Pokemon like opposing Ferrothorn and Jellicent that would irritate rain teams. Explosion seems counterintuitive on such a bulky Pokemon, but it prevents Ferrothorn from becoming setup fodder for the likes of Volcarona, Dragonite, and Thundurus-T. Thunder Wave is an irritating move for both offensive Pokemon like Latios that like being fast as well as bulky Pokemon like Reuniclus and Skarmory that dislike giving up free turns.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rain teams often have issues with bulky Water-types, including Rotom-W and Jellicent on sand teams and Politoed and Tentacruel on rain teams. These teams are often reliant on Water-type moves such as Keldeo's Hydro Pump, Latios's Surf, and Politoed's and Tentacruel's Scald to make progress, and the aforementioned bulky Water-types not only resist these attacks but also threaten burns in return, such as Rotom-W and Jellicent with Will-O-Wisp and Politoed and Tentacruel with Scald. However, with a Lum or Rawst Berry, Ferrothorn will shrug off their status, and with maximum Attack investment, Power Whip will seriously sting them. The choice between the two Berries is between whether or not Ferrothorn wants to shrug off paralysis and freeze as well and let a Latios that has used Trick on Ferrothorn shrug off paralysis. Leftovers is another solid item that gives Ferrothorn some passive longevity to enhance its naturally good defensive typing and bulk. A Brave nature is used to boost the power of Gyro Ball further, but an Adamant nature is also possible if it is not used.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ferrothorn fits on rain teams, and Politoed is required on these teams. It, and other Water-types like Tentacruel and Keldeo, appreciates Ferrothorn's ability to take on Grass-, Electric-, and Dragon-types. In exchange, these Water-types threaten the Ice- and Ground-types like Mamoswine and Landorus-T that Ferrothorn can struggle against without bulk investment. Thundurus-T also takes advantage of Ground-types like Landorus-T and Excadrill. Ground-types like Mamoswine, Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Garchomp enjoy Ferrothorn weakening bulky Water-types early-game. Dragon-types like the aforementioned Garchomp, Latios, and Kyurem-B appreciate Ferrothorn's ability to switch into opposing Dragon-type attacks. However, it will struggle to do so repeatedly without bulk investment and especially without Leftovers, so using Ferrothorn with a second Steel-type like Excadrill, Jirachi, or Scizor is a solid idea. Fighting-types like Breloom, Terrakion, and Keldeo threaten Ferrothorn severely, so using teammates that can pivot into or scare them out like Tentacruel and Latios are good. Teams weak to threats such as Quiver Dance Volcarona and Agility Thundurus-T after they have set up could consider offensive Explosion Ferrothorn to deny them the setup opportunity. However, Swords Dance Breloom threatens to OHKO Ferrothorn before a boost, denying the opportunity for it to use Explosion, and Swords Dance Scizor will set up on it anyway, so an Explosion Ferrothorn team will have to consider revenge killers that can deal with these threats. In general, the rain teams that use offensive Ferrothorn will lean more offensive than the ones that use defensive Ferrothorn because Ferrothorn, which is often a pivot on these teams, won't be able to take as many hits without bulk investment; as a result, these teams are less likely to run other defensive Pokemon, and the Politoed will run more offensive sets.</p> <p>Ferrothorn also fits on sand teams, which appreciate its ability to set up Spikes and resist Water. Teammates that enjoy having Spikes weakening their checks, including Reuniclus, Alakazam, and Latios, enjoy Ferrothorn's presence. These Pokemon, in return, repel Fighting-types that threaten Ferrothorn. Because sand teams don't come with a Water-type by default, pairing Ferrothorn with one like Rotom-W or Jellicent is important so that it has a teammate that can take Fire-type attacks from the occasional Heatran and Ice-type attacks from Mamoswine; Rotom-W is immune to Spikes and Ground-type attacks, so it can deal with opposing hazard stacking teams and Ground-types, while Jellicent's Ghost typing makes it superior against Keldeo and spinners. Dragon- and Ground-types also fit well on sand teams, and their synergy with Ferrothorn on sand is as effective as it is on rain. Many Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor can set up Stealth Rock, freeing up Ferrothorn from having to use the move and giving it more moveslot flexibility. Having a second Steel-type, while helpful, is not as important on sand because Tyranitar can remove Latios to relieve Ferrothorn of some of its defensive duties.</p>"

  "Chandelure": {
    "overview": "<p>Chandelure has a small niche in BW OU with its ability to form solid double Ghost-type cores with Jellicent on hyper offensive teams. In contrast to Gengar, Chandelure is able to OHKO Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Scizor while also being threatening against bulkier Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Gliscor and Seismitoad. Chandelure also has Flame Body, which makes it difficult for Excadrill to spin against it, since it must risk getting burned while attempting to break its Air Balloon. Flame Body is also useful for burning Tyranitar, which Chandelure's partners Latios and Alakazam can take advantage of.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Chandelure on its own faces several problems. First off, it is Stealth Rock weak, meaning that it can take a lot of damage for attempting to spinblock. It struggles immensely against the most common playstyles in the game, sand and rain, and is ultimately unable to spinblock Starmie and Tentacruel. Its Speed tier leaves it forced out by faster threats such as Latios and Keldeo. These reasons are why Chandelure is often passed over for Jellicent which has better defensive typing, better special bulk, and a stellar ability in Water Absorb.</p>",

  "Volcarona": {
    "overview": "<p>Volcarona is one of BW OU's definitive sweepers. Its typing has problematic weaknesses but is an excellent offensive combination with credible defensive merit, resisting Grass, Steel, and most notably Fighting against Breloom and Scizor. Flame Body is a good defensive perk, making up for Volcarona's low natural physical bulk by potentially neutralizing dangerous attackers like Tyranitar and Scizor. Its solid coverage options include Psychic and Giga Drain, which blow away checks such as Tentacruel, Jellicent, Keldeo, Terrakion, and Gastrodon. In addition, its solid Speed tier lets it outspeed serious threats such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, Kyurem-B, and Modest Thundurus-T. Quiver Dance, not only fixing its power, increases its special bulk to take powerful hits like Choice Scarf Keldeo's Hydro Pump outside of rain.</p> <p>Despite these incredible boons, Volcarona can't just be slapped on any team. Despite its resistances and Flame Body, its physical fraility is a concern that can prevent it from outright sweeping, and its 4x Stealth Rock weakness mandates Rapid Spin support. Because of this, Volcarona fits best on offensive teams that can provide this support and easily beat whatever its coverage fails to hit. Though +1 Volcarona's Speed is impressive, it is still outpaced by notable Choice Scarf users like Latios, Garchomp, and Keldeo and is hit hard by Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Rock is a seemingly plausible option that has good odds to KO Dragonite and Gyarados after Quiver Dance and Stealth Rock. Hurricane is an option that destroys Keldeo and has solid neutral coverage. Lum Berry can be used for setting up on Toxic or Thunder Wave from Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Jellicent, Gliscor, and Jirachi. Passho Berry is another option, helping Volcarona more easily stomach hits from Water-types such as Politoed, Rotom-W, and most importantly Keldeo. Volcarona can also utilize Rest and Chesto Berry with a more defensive spread. Although this forgoes a good deal of power, it increases Volcarona's longevity and allows it to resist status, giving it many more boosting opportunities.</p> <p>Life Orb Volcarona is an enticing prospect due to its utterly ruthless strength after a boost, but there are a few key factors holding it back. For one, it forces Volcarona to take far more chip damage than it is comfortable with in many cases, especially in tandem with sand, potential Toxic, and Stealth Rock, which can prematurely end its sweep even when it's played carefully. If one chooses to run Life Orb Volcarona, sun support is paramount; +1 Life Orb Volcarona can then 2HKO even the bulkiest special walls with Fire Blast, in particular Chansey and Tentacruel.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Volcarona's biggest obstacle is Stealth Rock, which leaves it more vulnerable to physical attackers like Dragonite, Breloom, and Scizor.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey</strong>: With unmatched special bulk, Chansey and Blissey are solid long-term checks to Volcarona. Life Orb Volcarona can 2HKO them in sun, however.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran has the typing and bulk to handle most of Volcarona's coverage moves, although Volcarona can carry Hidden Power Ground to threaten it. However, Heatran can carry Air Balloon or Substitute, letting it land a crucial Toxic or Magma Storm.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Tyranitar and Terrakion are great answers to Volcarona that force it out to use Swords Dance or Stealth Rock. Volcarona commonly carries Bug Buzz and Psychic to threaten Tyranitar and Terrakion, though, leaving them significantly weakened or KOed.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Choice Scarf Keldeo can outspeed +1 Volcarona and threaten to OHKO it with Hydro Pump, but only in rain. Gastrodon's typing and bulk allow it to deal with Volcarona and threaten it with Toxic. Tentacruel and Jellicent also fare well against most Volcarona, walling the majority of its moves and chipping it down with Scald and Toxic. However, Volcarona can bypass these answers with coverage moves such as Psychic and Giga Drain.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast hits important benchmarks such as OHKOing Thundurus-T, Gliscor, and most Landorus-T at +1, along with having favorable rolls against specially defensive Excadrill unboosted and opposing Volcarona at +1. However, if you are more confident that Volcarona will acquire multiple boosts and prefer reliability and PP over sheer power, Flamethrower is a suitable alternative. Bug Buzz in tandem with Bug Plate hits Pokemon resistant to Flamethrower such as Slowking, Garchomp, Latios, Tyranitar, Rotom-W, and Politoed. In addition, the boosted move decimates Latios and Latias as well as other Dragon- and Ground-types such as Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Kyurem-B. Psychic is mostly used to dish out huge damage to Tentacruel and OHKO Keldeo. Giga Drain is an option to easily OHKO Gastrodon and 2HKO Jellicent with a boost, provide longevity, and retain a strong—albeit not quite fatal—hit on Keldeo and Terrakion. Giga Drain can also be used over Bug Buzz and paired with another coverage move if Volcarona's team is extremely confident against Tyranitar. Finally, if your team can handle Water-types effectively, Hidden Power can be a devastating surprise to an otherwise solid check. Hidden Power Ground devastates Heatran-reliant teams even without a boost. It also preserves Volcarona's ability to hit Terrakion and Tentacruel to an extent. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ice is Volcarona's best weapon against Dragonite, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Garchomp.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Volcarona's damage output and allows it to outspeed Landorus-T, and consequently outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T at +1. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Volcarona's HP, allowing it to survive key hits such as Fusion Bolt from Life Orb Kyurem-B and Low Sweep from Life Orb Breloom twice. Volcarona can run more or less Speed if desired. For example, 160 Speed EVs beat Excadrill, 216 catch Jolly Kyurem-B, and maximum Speed lets Volcarona ties with opposing Volcarona and other base 100s such as Mew. Flame Body potentially incapacitates revenge killers such as Dragonite, Scizor, and Kyurem-B. Insect Plate is the preferred item, as enables Bug Buzz to always OHKO Slowking after Stealth Rock and KO Pokemon like Tyranitar, Garchomp, and Politoed with less prior damage. Mind Plate makes +1 Psychic OHKO Tentacruel after Stealth Rock a majority of the time, eliminating one of Volcarona's best checks, assuming Protect is played around.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In a game where it is likely to clean up at the end, Volcarona should switch in indirectly via pivots or double switches, and only once its checks have been severely weakened or removed. If a sweep is highly unlikely, Volcarona can still be useful to check Steel-types, and Flame Body should not be discounted as a last-ditch effort to burn an out-of-control sweeper like Dragonite. Volcarona should stay away from Stealth Rock at all costs; unless it runs Giga Drain, it loses half of its HP permanently and usually forfeits the ability to set up safely. Volcarona should set up primarily against Pokemon it forces out, such as Ferrothorn, offensive Excadrill, Breloom, Jirachi, unboosted Reuniclus, Keldeo locked into non-Water-type moves, Choice Scarf Latios locked into Dragon Pulse, and Celebi. However, Volcarona should also consider attacking them outright—many of them can have moves that hinder Volcarona while using Quiver Dance. Winning this mind game and eliminating a setup opportunity may make it more difficult for Volcarona to sweep regardless, but it can dispose of a crucial threat for a teammate such as Dragonite or Starmie to capitalize on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A Rapid Spin user is necessary. Starmie can form a wonderful offensive core with Volcarona, providing Rapid Spin while pressuring Terrakion, Keldeo, Dragonite, and Heatran. In return, Volcarona mauls most of the Pokemon that trouble Starmie, such as Latios, Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Celebi, and they weaken Tyranitar and Tentacruel for one another. Despite its vulnerability to chip damage, Volcarona can find itself right at home on a sand team. It has excellent synergy with Excadrill, which provides extremely reliable Rapid Spin support and can stomach Stone Edge and Draco Meteor from Terrakion and Latios. Tyranitar checks and traps Volcarona checks such as Tornadus, Heatran, and Choice Scarf Latios, while Volcarona deals with the Steel-types, namely Jirachi and Skarmory, that plague Tyranitar. In addition, both Tyranitar and Excadrill appreciate Volcarona's ability to lure in and remove Politoed and Ground-types such as Garchomp and Landorus-T. Chief among helpful Stealth Rock setters is Landorus-T, which can take on Terrakion, Garchomp, and Dragonite and provide general Intimidate support to help Volcarona set up against physical attackers. Landorus-T can also pivot Volcarona in with U-turn. Rotom-W can do the same while taking advantage of Jellicent and Heatran and luring in Ferrothorn. Sun from Ninetales is another way to support Volcarona, boosting Fire Blast's power to nuclear levels and weakening Water-type assailants.</p>"

  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gengar is a decent Pokemon on sand teams with multiple Psychic-types since it wears down Psychic-type checks, mainly Tyranitar, as well as Ferrothorn and Jirachi thanks to its coverage and ability to burn them with Will-O-Wisp. It is an excellent spinblocker, switching into Sand Force Excadrill and OHKOing it with Focus Blast; the same is true against Starmie, as it can take one Hydro Pump from full health and OHKO with Shadow Ball. Gengar is quite fast, outspeeding Pokemon like Keldeo, Garchomp, Terrakion, and Thundurus-T and Speed tying Latios, letting it threaten many common offensive Pokemon. It also has some defensive utility in countering Landorus-T and Gliscor since they can't hit Gengar hard and it threatens them offensively. However, Gengar is uncommon because of its lack of self-sufficiency outside of crippling checks for Psychic-types. It lacks defensive utility, leaving it unable to switch into many Pokemon, notably failing to spinblock Tentacruel. It's also easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Alakazam, Starmie, and Choice Scarf users, especially Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Scizor since they can Pursuit trap it. It also isn't a great wallbreaker due to its inability to do much against bulkier targets that it can't hit super effectively like Gastrodon, specially defensive Skarmory, and Politoed outside of burning them. It also faces stiff competition as a spinblocker that cripples Psychic-type checks from Jellicent, which has much better defensive utility thanks to its better defensive profile letting it spinblock Tentacruel more effectively and more comfortably doing so against Excadrill.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Life Orb or Choice Specs set may seem tempting given Gengar's good movepool and Special Attack. However, these sets tend to underperform as a result of their lack of longevity, weakness to Pursuit if not locking into Focus Blast, and competition from other special attackers like Latios, Alakazam, Reuniclus, and Keldeo. Destiny Bond can be used over Focus Blast to take down Pokemon with Gengar as it faints, mainly when it's worn down against Pokemon like Tentacruel, Politoed, and Heatran. Hidden Power Fire OHKOes Scizor and does a lot of damage to Ferrothorn. However, it forces Gengar to run an imperfect Speed IV, leaving it outsped by Latios. It also lacks usefulness outside of these targets. Should Hidden Power Fire be run, Protect should be used alongside it to scout and beat Choice Scarf Scizor and scout Choice Scarf Tyranitar. 88 HP and 224 Defense EVs can be run on the Substitute + Will-O-Wisp set to let Gengar always survive Jolly Excadrill's Sand Force-boosted Iron Head after Stealth Rock and sand damage as well as Starmie's unboosted Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock. However, this spread can only outspeed up to Garchomp, leaving it unable to check Latios and Keldeo offensively. Hex can be used on the Substitute + Will-O-Wisp set to do more damage to burned targets and pressure Gliscor more reliably.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Tyranitar and Scizor can Pursuit trap Gengar, especially if running Choice Scarf since they'll do so before Gengar gets the chance to burn or significantly damage them. However, they will often need to take a burn or Focus Blast when removing Gengar if lacking Choice Scarf, leaving them vulnerable to Gengar's Psychic-type partners.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie and Choice Scarf users like Latios and Keldeo can all outspeed and KO Gengar with ease as a result of its immense frailty. However, they don't enjoy getting burned or taking one of its hits, making them unable to switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Gengar can't break through bulky Pokemon like Gastrodon, Politoed, Tentacruel, and specially defensive Skarmory as a result of their immense bulk, recovery, and ability to threaten Gengar. However, they don't enjoy taking a burn, which leaves them vulnerable to Gengar's Psychic-type partners, and in Politoed's case, losing the weather war to Tyranitar.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Focus Blast wears down support Tyranitar and forces it to use its Chople Berry, making a teammate like Alakazam more easily able to take it out later in the game. It also hits Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Heatran, and physically defensive Skarmory hard. Trick can be used to more consistently cripple the aforementioned Pokemon due to Focus Blast's poor accuracy; furthermore, Trick removes Tyranitar's Chople Berry more consistently, letting Gengar's Psychic-type teammates more easily break past it. It also lets Gengar cripple Pokemon that can't be burned, like Gliscor and Poison Heal Breloom, and make foes like Gastrodon and specially defensive Skarmory take a ton of passive damage in tandem with burn. However, its one-use nature makes it less consistent at crippling teams with multiple Psychic-type checks compared to Focus Blast. Will-O-Wisp burns and wears down bulky Pokemon like Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, Jirachi, Skarmory, and Rotom-W, which is especially potent alongside entry hazards and sand. Hidden Power Ice hits Garchomp, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Dragonite very hard, meaning Gliscor can't freely U-turn into Tyranitar against Gengar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Black Sludge is the chosen item to give Gengar enough longevity to cripple and wear down what it needs to and makes Trick usable should it be run.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gengar fits well on sand teams that use Spikes, in tandem with multiple Psychic-types, since it spinblocks Excadrill and Starmie and cripples Psychic-type checks. Tyranitar sets sand and Pursuit traps Reuniclus, Latios, and Alakazam with its Chople Berry set. It also enjoys Gengar spinblocking Excadrill and crippling Pokemon that'd take its hits, like Ferrothorn and Skarmory, with Will-O-Wisp. Ferrothorn and Skarmory are able to set up Spikes to wear down most of Gengar's common switch-ins, like Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Heatran, while enjoying Gengar denying foes from removing Spikes with Rapid Spin. Ferrothorn notably switches into Dragon-types like Latios and Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Superpower as well as Water-types like Starmie and Politoed. It also provides other support in the form of Stealth Rock and Knock Off to wear down the opponent even more alongside Gengar's Will-O-Wisp. On the other hand, Skarmory checks offensive Ground-types like Excadrill and Garchomp more reliably as well as Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Scizor. Gengar works very well alongside Psychic-types since Gengar cripples and wears down their switch-ins, mainly Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn; as such, Alakazam, Latios, and Reuniclus are fantastic partners. Alakazam is able to break past Tyranitar without needing to break its Focus Sash if Gengar forces it to use its Chople Berry and revenge kill Starmie if it predicts Gengar switching in. Latios switches into Water- and Psychic-types like Keldeo, Politoed, and Alakazam, with Colbur Berry Latios being a particularly good partner since it can act as a way to wear down Choice Scarf Tyranitar, which Gengar often fails to do. Reuniclus appreciates its switch-ins being worn down so it can more easily sweep with Calm Mind late-game and more justifiably drop Focus Blast for Hidden Power Ice or Thunder. Gliscor checks Steel-types like Heatran, Jirachi, Excadrill, and Tyranitar and can provide Stealth Rock and Knock Off support to further wear down Gengar's switch-ins in tandem with burn. Gliscor can also safely get Gengar on the field with U-turn.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set is designed to safely burn Tyranitar to help rain teams win the weather war. It also provides a decent spinblocking option against Tentacruel in matchups against opposing rain teams. Substitute punishes switches and lets Gengar safely burn or attack the switch-in. Gengar can set up Substitute easily against targets like burnt specially defensive Jirachi, Ferrothorn, and Gliscor. Will-O-Wisp cripples checks like Tyranitar and Tentacruel, making them much easier to wear down and break through. Will-O-Wisp is also easy to use freely if Substitute is up. Focus Blast wears down and forces support Tyranitar to use its Chople Berry, making a teammate like Tornadus or Thundurus-T more easily able to take Tyranitar out later in the game. It also hits Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Heatran, and physically defensive Skarmory hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Black Sludge is the chosen item to give Gengar enough longevity to cripple and wear down what it needs to. 80 HP and 236 Defense EVs lets Gengar always survive Jolly Excadrill's Sand Force-boosted Iron Head after Stealth Rock and sand damage. The Speed EVs allow Gengar to outspeed Garchomp.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gengar fits well on Spikes-based rain teams with Pokemon like Latios and Tornadus that benefit greatly from Gengar crippling Tyranitar and keeping Spikes on the field long enough for its teammates to wreak havoc. Politoed brings rain, switches into Tyranitar and Steel-types like Jirachi and Heatran, spreads status in tandem with Gengar, and baits in Grass-types like Ferrothorn for Gengar to switch into while Gengar burning Tyranitar makes it easier to maintain rain. Excadrill is more easily able to spin entry hazards off the field with Skarmory burned, which is important since Gengar lets Skarmory easily set up Spikes; Excadrill can also act as a check to Tyranitar. Ferrothorn counters Dragon- and Water-types like Latios, Starmie, and Kyurem-B and enjoys Gengar preventing Tentacruel and Excadrill from spinning away its entry hazards at least once. Choice Scarf Keldeo can clean late-game with its rain-boosted Water-type STAB moves thanks to Gengar making it easier to win the weather war. Keldeo also checks Pokemon like Tyranitar, Heatran, and Jirachi, while Gengar checks Grass-types like Breloom and Celebi lacking Psychic. Latios, particularly Choice Scarf variants, greatly appreciates Gengar crippling checks like Tyranitar and Jirachi and keeping Spikes from being removed, letting Latios more easily revenge kill what it needs to. Tornadus can more freely use Hurricane with Tyranitar being weakened by Will-O-Wisp and Focus Blast; it further appreciates Tyranitar's Chople Berry getting used. Thundurus-T benefits in a similar manner to Tornadus, with its STAB Thunder being able to be more freely used thanks to rain being up more often while also letting Thundurus-T heal with Leftovers more frequently, giving it much better longevity against sand teams.</p>"

  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnezone has one job in the BW OU metagame, and it does that job well: trap and remove Steel-type Pokemon, particularly Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill. Thanks to Magnezone's typing and ability, it can come in on most Steel-type Pokemon without much trouble and remove them. This makes Magnezone an enabler for Pokemon that are stopped by Steel-types, such as Latios, Garchomp, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Amoonguss; making it the cornerstone of the famous DragMag style, where Magnezone clears the way for a collection of Dragon-type Pokemon to fire off powerful attacks. In addition, its ability to trap common entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory and a common spinner and wallbreaker in Excadrill can make it a valuable teammate and take pressure off your spinner by reducing the need to spin as soon as possible. Also, thanks to its solid bulk, it can take weaker hits or resisted attacks from Pokemon such as Politoed and Latios in a pinch and get an attack off. However, Magnezone does not have much of an offensive presence beyond removing Steel-types due to its low Speed, and it has weaknesses to common attacking types, harming its overall viability.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set consisting of Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Fire, Flash Cannon, and Thunder Wave with a Chople Berry can be used to survive a hit from Pokemon like Alakazam, Keldeo, and Terrakion and KO them with Thunderbolt or Flash Cannon or cripple them with Thunder Wave. However, it does not offer as much utility as other sets and is less consistent. Thunder Wave seems like a good option to cripple faster Pokemon that might try to come in, but none of Magnezone's sets have space for it other than Choice Scarf. Choice Specs is an option to OHKO Ferrothorn without any setup, but it is easy to take advantage of and does not really accomplish anything that Sunny Day Magnezone does not already accomplish. Barrier is also an option for the last slot on the Substitute + Charge Beam set, as it allows Magnezone to survive strong physical attacks such as Outrage from Kyurem-B, Garchomp, and Dragonite, as well as Keldeo's Secret Sword and Breloom's Drain Punch, but it promotes more long-term setup than trying to trade two Pokemon for one. Custap Berry is an option to take your opponent by surprise and KO a weakened Pokemon, as Magnezone has a tendency reach the activation benchmark over the course of a game, but it is not consistent. Salac Berry is an option on the Substitute + Charge Beam set to attempt to sweep faster teams after racking up Special Attack boosts, but it lacks consistency, still is not particularly fast, and comes with the heavy opportunity cost of Leftovers recovery. Magic Coat is an option for Magnezone to reflect Spikes back at a trapped Ferrothorn, but it usually is not worth the moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon do not really care about whatever move Magnezone throws at them and can KO it with a Ground-type STAB move. Excadrill can also come in on any move other than Hidden Power Fire and KO Magnezone, but it needs to be wary of Air Balloon + Magnet Rise variants. Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus-T can come in easily on Electric-type moves and Hidden Power Fire and KO Magnezone, but they need to be careful of Flash Cannon or Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types such as Latios, Garchomp, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon can switch in on one or more of Magnezone's moves and KO it with their move of choice.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Terrakion, Mienshao, and Breloom can outspeed Magnezone and KO it with their STAB Fighting-type moves. However, they cannot switch in easily against Magnezone. In addition, Chople Berry sets can invalidate these checks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Latios, Alakazam, and Starmie can outspeed and deal heavy damage to or KO Magnezone with the correct move after chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Magnet Pull Circumvention</strong>: Worry Seed on Ferrothorn and Shed Shell on Skarmory can invalidate Magnet Pull and allow them to switch out of Magnezone, defeating the purpose of running it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Heatran, Chansey, Amoonguss, and Cresselia take little damage from anything Magnezone throws at them and can chip it back or outright KO it in Heatran's case. In addition, bulky setup sweepers such as Reuniclus can shrug off most attacks from Magnezone and proceed to set up against it. Tyranitar can also come in against almost any move Magnezone has, but it needs to be careful of Flash Cannon and chip damage from Volt Switch.</p>",

      "Sunny Day": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt allows Magnezone to knock out Skarmory without any trouble. Hidden Power Fire is used to allow Magnezone to take out most other Steel-types, particularly Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Jirachi. Sunny Day clears rain and sand and increases the power of Hidden Power Fire, allowing Magnezone to trap and KO Ferrothorn when it was raining previously, 2HKO Excadrill, and do significantly more damage to Jirachi. Magnet Rise in tandem with Air Balloon allows Magnezone to trap Excadrill, which can no longer hit it with Earthquake.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature is chosen to deal as much damage as possible, notably increasing the damage done to Excadrill and giving Magnezone an easier time dealing with Leech Seed + Protect Ferrothorn and Wish + Protect Jirachi, while Timid does not hit many relevant benchmarks. Air Balloon allows Magnezone to set up Magnet Rise against Excadrill so that it can be trapped and removed and also allows Magnezone to dodge stray Earthquakes. For example, the combination of Air Balloon and Magnet Rise prevents Landorus-T from revenge killing Magnezone after the latter has removed its target.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Magnezone's role is to trap and remove Steel-types, and it should be played as such. Magnezone can come in for free against Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Jirachi lacking U-turn and proceed to take them out. Magnezone should only come in on a free switch against Excadrill, however, as offensive variants can potentially pop its Air Balloon on the switch with Iron Head or Rapid Spin, allowing it to be KOed with Earthquake on the next turn before it can use Magnet Rise. In addition, in a one-on-one situation, Excadrill will use Iron Head to try to pop the Air Balloon and make Magnezone flinch, making it unable to use Magnet Rise safely. Magnezone will have to switch back out if this happens. Try to bring in Magnezone on a U-turn, Volt Switch, or double switch, as some players will bring in their Steel-type and switch it back out while Magnezone comes in to keep it at bay. After Magnezone has done its job, it can still serve a small purpose in taking a weak hit and attacking back or being sacrificed to bring in a sweeper unscathed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any Pokemon that appreciates the removal of Steel-type Pokemon will appreciate Magnezone as a teammate. Wallbreakers such as Latios, Alakazam, Kyurem-B, and Mamoswine all appreciate the removal of Ferrothorn so that they can go to town on the other team with their powerful attacks. Gliscor, Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Salamence all enjoy the removal of Skarmory, which can otherwise stop them in their tracks. In addition, entry hazard setters such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn appreciate Magnezone's ability to remove one of the best spinners in the tier in Excadrill. Bulky teammates such as Tyranitar or Jirachi will enjoy the removal of Ferrothorn and Skarmory, which can otherwise set hazards and put more pressure on your spinner. Icy Wind Jirachi both lures in Excadrill and allows Magnezone to beat it every time, as it can no longer outspeed Magnezone and hit it before it gets a chance to use Magnet Rise. Other Jirachi sets make good partners as well, as it can lure in Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory and bring in Magnezone with U-turn to trap them easily. Landorus-T and Gliscor can check Excadrill, removing some of the pressure on Magnezone to trap it, appreciate the removal of Skarmory, and can lure it in if running U-turn.</p> <p>Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Dragonite, Latios, and Salamence get a special mention here, as they form the \"DragMag\" strategy and can quickly overwhelm an opposing team after the removal of their Dragon-type answer. In particular, Garchomp, Dragonite, and Salamence really prefer the removal of Skarmory, though removing Ferrothorn allows them to fire off Outrages without fear of being walled or taking Iron Barbs damage. Latios appreciates the removal of Ferrothorn in particular, which resists everything it runs except for the occasional Hidden Power Fire.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt allows Magnezone to quickly remove Skarmory. Volt Switch allows Magnezone to gain momentum on an opposing switch, allowing you to bring in your check to whatever is brought in, provided their switch-in is not a Ground-type or Thundurus-T. The choice of Hidden Power comes down to what you would rather take care of. Hidden Power Fire can be used if Ferrothorn and Scizor are very threatening. On the other hand, Hidden Power Ice is useful for revenge killing Pokemon such as Garchomp, Salamence, and Dragonite when they're locked into Outrage or lack any Speed boosts. Finally, Flash Cannon has solid neutral coverage and is therefore good for cleaning towards the end of the game, notably hitting Tyranitar and Mamoswine harder than anything else Magnezone has. Thunder Wave is another option that allows Magnezone to cripple faster Pokemon on the opposing team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Speed boost from Choice Scarf allows Magnezone to function as a revenge killer against every relevant unboosted Pokemon up to Timid Tornadus while still letting it trap Steel-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Magnezone can come in for free against Skarmory and can remove it with Thunderbolt. It can also come in against Scizor locked into Pursuit or Bullet Punch and take it out with two Thunderbolts or a Hidden Power Fire if there is no rain. Additionally, Magnezone can come in and beat Ferrothorn if it's running Hidden Power Fire and there is no rain. If the opponent has no Ground-type or it is sufficiently weakened, feel free to spam Volt Switch early and often to maintain offensive momentum and chip away at the opponent's check to Magnezone, allowing it to come in later and clean up more easily against slower teams. Also, thanks to its good bulk, it is able to come in on a weaker attack and attempt to damage something or try to gain momentum with Volt Switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Magnezone is not as self sufficient as its other sets, so while it does offer support, it requires some support of its own. Nothing it has hits Ground-types really hard, outside of Hidden Power Fire against Excadrill, so strong Water- and Grass-types like Keldeo, Starmie, and Breloom can be useful in this regard. Also, if running Hidden Power Ice, Magnezone lacks the ability to deal with Ferrothorn, so checks to that are helpful. Interestingly, Breloom can fill both of these roles and is great for absorbing status for the team and punching holes. On the other hand, Magnezone provides a lot of support to its team. Choice Scarf Magnezone takes care of Skarmory and Ferrothorn with little trouble, which allows Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Latios to go nuts on the opposing team. Landorus-T can also check Excadrill, lure in Skarmory, and bring Magnezone in versus it with U-turn. Removing Skarmory and Ferrothorn also makes spinning as soon as possible a less pressing issue, as quickly KOing them with Magnezone means they will not get as many entry hazards up. Jirachi is a great partner, as it lures in Ferrothorn and Skarmory and can pivot into Magnezone with U-turn, which can then trap them easily. Gliscor checks Excadrill and Landorus-T, greatly appreciates the removal of Skarmory, and can also lure it in to bring in Magnezone if running U-turn, making it a great partner as well.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Charge Beam": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Magnezone to set up all over Ferrothorn and get a hit in against the opponent after their Steel-type is removed, notably making them more reluctant to bring in a Ground-type like Garchomp, Gliscor, Excadrill, or Landorus-T. Charge Beam allows Magnezone to boost its Special Attack against Ferrothorn, both allowing it to be removed with ease and enabling Magnezone to trade for at least one other Pokemon on the opposing team. Hidden Power Ice has fantastic coverage alongside Charge Beam, allowing Magnezone to hit Ground-types such as Gliscor, Garchomp, Landorus-T, and specially defensive Excadrill harder than anything else it has. Do note, however, that +6 Hidden Power Ice will not OHKO specially defensive Excadrill. Thunderbolt is used in the last moveslot to take out Skarmory more quickly than Charge Beam should Magnezone's stallbreaking capabilities not be required, limiting the entry hazards it can set up, and is Magnezone's go-to move after setting up because of its greater power and perfect accuracy. Flash Cannon can be used in the last slot for its solid neutral coverage, but most of its targets are hit harder by Hidden Power Ice, with the exception of Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers is the item of choice to allow Magnezone to set up as many Substitutes as possible and increase its longevity in case your opponent tries to chip it down. Magnet Pull traps Steel-types, allowing Magnezone to set up against them. A Modest nature improves Magnezone's damage rolls against bulky Pokemon, giving it a better chance to KO them if you are unable to reach +6. Alternatively, a spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 24 SpA / 84 SpD / 144 Spe allows Magnezone to survive a Hydro Pump from Choice Specs Keldeo, endure a Hydro Pump from Choice Scarf Keldeo in rain or take a rain-boosted Surf from Choice Specs Latios and KO it with a +2 Hidden Power Ice. These Speed EVs allow Magnezone to outspeed everything up to specially defensive Heatran, including Politoed, Jellicent, and Breloom that are not running Speed investment. This spread is notably effective when run alongside Barrier, though Barrier is not particularly common.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Magnezone set plays as a wallbreaker and trapper. Magnezone can come in for free against almost any Ferrothorn, Skarmory, or Jirachi. Be wary of Knock Off and Leech Seed from Ferrothorn or paralysis from Jirachi's Body Slam or Thunder, as the removal of Magnezone's Leftovers or constant chip damage from Leech Seed makes it far more difficult for it to set up against them, and paralysis will severely inhibit its ability to set up. When facing Skarmory, it is best to take it out with Thunderbolt as quickly as possible, as most Skarmory will use Whirlwind after they see a Substitute, and preventing Spikes is of high priority.</p> <p>This Magnezone set requires aggressive plays such as double switching, as most players will not willingly keep their Ferrothorn in when they see you have a Magnezone. Double switching is especially important because there are not many Pokemon that invite Ferrothorn in and have Volt Switch or U-turn, with the only two being Rotom-W and Jirachi. The goal with this Magnezone set is to try to apply pressure on the opposing team early and trade for Ferrothorn and at least one other to shape the game in your favor.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As this set is more focused on wallbreaking and less focused on removing Steel-types efficiently, the opponent can set up more entry hazards against this Magnezone set than others. Thus, a spinner such as Excadrill or Starmie is helpful to keep entry hazards off of your side of the field. This set lacks coverage for Excadrill, so checks to it such as Landorus-T and Gliscor are helpful. In addition, Pokemon that take advantage of Steel-types being removed make great teammates, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Mamoswine, Kyurem-B, and Latios. Rotom-W is a good partner, as it invites Ferrothorn in and can pivot to Magnezone with Volt Switch, and it is also an excellent VoltTurn partner with Landorus-T. Rotom-W is also a good Excadrill check, but it needs to be careful of Mold Breaker variants. Please note that this set does not fit particularly well on DragMag teams but rather on rain and sand teams to remove walls and apply heavy offensive pressure afterwards with powerful boosted attacks.</p>"

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatran has amazing defensive utility thanks to its typing and Flash Fire, which make it immune to sandstorm, Toxic, and Fire-type attacks. These qualities let it check Steel- and Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Amoonguss, and Jirachi very well. Heatran also has great support options like Stealth Rock, Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, and Taunt that it can easily mix and match to effectively support its team, as its sets aren't very team dependent. Its offensive presence is also fantastic thanks to high-Base Power moves like Magma Storm and Earth Power, which let it punish and effectively wear down its checks such as Water-types, Garchomp, and Tyranitar. However, Heatran has a noticeable lack of recovery outside of Leftovers that makes it very vulnerable to entry hazards, which makes it more difficult to switch into and consistently check what it needs to. This problem is further compounded by the fact some Pokemon that Heatran can normally beat such as Volcarona run coverage specifically for it, which leaves it quite pressured. Another issue is that some of the best Pokemon in the metagame, including Excadrill, Garchomp, and especially Politoed, all threaten Heatran immensely.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf is a decent option on sand teams to give Heatran a secondary form of speed control, but such a set is quickly worn down and these teams would usually prefer a bulkier set with more longevity. Choice Specs seems good on paper for wallbreaking; however, the moves this set locks into are usually extremely punishable; Heatran's defensive utility also decreases dramatically, and offensive sun teams, where this set shines best, aren't very optimal in the metagame. Such a set is also slow and easy to force out.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Tentacruel, Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Politoed all threaten Heatran with super effective moves and have the type advantage against it. Politoed, in particular, can summon rain to weaken Heatran's Fire-type moves while strengthening Water-type moves. However, all of these Pokemon can be worn down by status, residual damage from Magma Storm, and entry hazards over time.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Gliscor, Excadrill, Garchomp, and Landorus-T can all destroy Heatran with super effective STAB moves. They can even set up, or in Excadrill's case, spin away Stealth Rock as Heatran switches. However, Garchomp and Landorus-T hate Toxic, and all of them have a hard time against the Magma Storm set, since it wears them down. Heatran can even use Hidden Power Ice on the switch to take these Pokemon out.</p> <p><strong>Certain Dragon-types</strong>: Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Dragonite can beat Heatran by virtue of their higher Speed, Fire resistance, and super effective STAB or coverage moves that can take it out. These Dragon-types hate taking status and Hidden Power Ice, however, and are worn down relatively quickly.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can take on Heatran thanks to Natural Cure removing poison, its special bulk letting it take all of Heatran's hits, and being able to heal with Soft-Boiled; it can also wear Heatran down with Seismic Toss, which can break a potential Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Pokemon like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Latios can potentially threaten Heatran and force it out. However, all of these Pokemon have a hard time switching in, and if Heatran is carrying Protect, it can scout the move they lock into if they're holding a Choice item.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Pokemon like Mienshao, Terrakion, and especially Keldeo can hit Heatran very hard; the latter two can also take a few hits from it if need be. However, all of these Pokemon hate status and can be worn down by Heatran over time.</p> <p><strong>Lure Sets</strong>: Pokemon like Volcarona that Heatran would otherwise beat often run coverage moves like Hidden Power Ground to lure in and KO Heatran.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Magma Storm lets Heatran punish its switch-ins thanks to the trapping effect and residual damage. It's especially potent in tandem with sand. Fire Blast, on the other hand, is stronger and more accurate, which makes it more consistent. It also works much better with Flame Charge. Protect lets Heatran scout Choice-locked attackers like Latios and Landorus-T, get free Leftovers recovery, and get more residual damage on foes with Magma Storm. Flame Charge can be run with an Air Balloon to let Heatran get a Speed boost so it can threaten more offensive Pokemon and potentially sweep late-game. Earth Power lets Heatran hit opposing Heatran, Tyranitar, Terrakion, and Tentacruel while giving it another attack to use should Heatran need to preserve Magma Storm's PP. Hidden Power Ice hits the Dragon- and Ground-types of the tier, mainly Latios, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus-T, hard on the switch. Will-O-Wisp lets Heatran cripple switch-ins like Garchomp, Tyranitar, Politoed, and Tentacruel and wears them down much faster. Taunt can be used over Protect to let Heatran defeat Chansey with Magma Storm and helps a lot against sun stall teams. However, this makes Heatran unable to rack up free residual damage or Leftovers recovery and leaves it unable to scout moves from Choice-locked attackers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment lets Heatran outspeed Adamant Breloom, Modest Politoed, and most Rotom-W, as Rotom-W typically opts for a slower spread. Leftovers is Heatran's only form of recovery; it has an easy time recovering thanks to Protect, the many switches it forces, and its immunities to sand, poison, and burn damage. Air Balloon makes Heatran a solid offensive answer to most Dragon-types, mono-Earthquake Gliscor, and most opposing Heatran; it also lets Heatran stay in on Tyranitar, meaning you can burn and weaken it for teammates like Latios or Thundurus-T to take advantage of, and it makes Heatran immune to Spikes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to keep Heatran as healthy as possible so it can check what it needs to consistently, take a super effective hit in a pinch, and come in to pressure the opposing team more often. Be cautious about coming in directly on Pokemon Heatran checks that have options to punish it, namely Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Latios as they can use Stun Spore, Knock Off, and Surf or Trick respectively. Attempt to keep entry hazards off your side of the field if possible, as they hurt Heatran's longevity and make it more difficult to switch in. Try to get and keep your own entry hazards up as they make switching into Heatran even more punishing than it already is, especially if sand is up. If Heatran is running Hidden Power Ice, it can be used if predicting a switch to a Ground- or Dragon-type if it isn't too risky to do so in a given situation. Don't be afraid to throw out Magma Storm if given a free turn, as it punishes almost everything that comes in on Heatran. However, its low PP must be kept in mind. Use Protect to scout Choice-locked attackers like Latios and Landorus-T, regain health via Leftovers, and rack up more residual damage on the foe. However, be cautious of using Protect against Pokemon that can punish its use by setting up or healing. Avoid letting Heatran get paralyzed, as it will leave Heatran very vulnerable to Pokemon like Jirachi and Breloom that it could check otherwise. If Heatran has Will-O-Wisp, use it when predicting a switch to checks like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tyranitar is an excellent partner for this set due to its ability to set up Stealth Rock and sand while checking and potentially trapping Pokemon like Jellicent and Starmie that Heatran can struggle with. Water-types like Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Jellicent are good partners as well, as they can check opposing Water- and Ground-types like Keldeo, Gliscor, and Landorus-T, while Heatran handles Grass- and Dragon-types like Amoonguss and Latios for them. They can even spread status, namely burn, to make Protect on Heatran more effective and switching into it harder. Pokemon that can set up entry hazards, like Tyranitar, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn make for good partners to punish the opposing team as much as possible. Pokemon like Tyranitar, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn are good options for this. Latios can soft check Pokemon like Keldeo, Gliscor, Rotom-W, and Politoed and appreciates Heatran's ability to weaken or cripple Tyranitar and beat most Steel-types, making Latios much more difficult to switch into. Amoonguss and Poison Heal Breloom have good offensive and defensive synergy with Heatran, as they can handle Water-types such as Politoed, Jellicent, and Keldeo. Ground-types like Gliscor and Excadrill take advantage of Heatran wearing down, crippling, or trapping their checks. Both of them can also spread Toxic, piling on the residual damage the foes have to take and suffocating them as a result. Pokemon that appreciate Heatran's balance breaking capabilities and match up well against offense are good partners. Choice Scarf users like Keldeo, Landorus-T, and Garchomp pair well with Heatran for this reason. Spinners like Excadrill and Starmie work well with Heatran, as they have good offensive synergy with it and improve its longevity, making it easier for Heatran to switch in and punish its foe.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Protect": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute lets Heatran punish switches and take advantage of Pokemon that can't do much damage to it while making it easier for it to spread status. Protect lets Heatran scout Choice-locked Pokemon if it's not already behind a Substitute, get a free turn of Leftovers recovery, and rack up free poison and potentially sand damage in tandem with Substitute. Toxic allows Heatran to punish most of its switch-ins by putting them on a timer and synergizes well with Substitute and Protect because these moves make it easier to rack up free residual damage with the extra protection provided. Will-O-Wisp can also be used to more reliably spread burns to Pokemon like Tentacruel and Garchomp, and it synergizes well with Substitute and Protect for the same reasons as Toxic. Earth Power can be used over Toxic or Will-O-Wisp to punish opposing Heatran as well as wear Tentacruel down more quickly, although this means Heatran can't wear down other Pokemon as reliably. Finally, Hidden Power Ice is an option to OHKO Garchomp, Landorus-T, and non-Special Defensive Gliscor while maintaining the pressure on Latios and Dragonite.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>8 HP and 100 Special Defense EVs make sure Rotom-W's Volt Switch does not break Heatran's Substitute, forcing Rotom-W to use Hydro Pump to break it and making Heatran adept at PP stalling Rotom-W. 244 Speed EVs and a Timid nature are used to outspeed Adamant Excadrill. Leftovers helps Heatran recover health after using Substitute and also works well in tandem with Protect.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Heatran is meant to punish standard sand teams by wearing them down while being tough to KO thanks to Substitute and Protect. Try to keep Heatran as healthy as possible so it can come in on what it checks and set up Substitute consistently. Be cautious about coming in directly on Pokemon Heatran checks that have options to punish it, like Ferrothorn and Amoonguss, as they can cripple Heatran on the switch with Knock Off and Stun Spore, respectively. Try to keep entry hazards off your side of the field if possible, as they hurt this set's longevity. Attempt to set up Substitute when given a free turn or on Pokemon that Heatran naturally beats, like Amoonguss and Jirachi, so it can more easily spread status and wear down the opposing team. Heatran can even set up Substitute on weaker Water-types like Jellicent, which can't break its Substitute in one hit. Use Toxic or Will-O-Wisp if behind a Substitute or predicting a switch to a check susceptible to it, mainly Water- and Ground-types. Lava Plume can be used if predicting a switch to a Pokemon immune to Toxic or as a catch-all play that's usually low-risk and high-reward, especially behind a Substitute. Protect should be used to scout Choice-locked attackers if Substitute isn't up, get free Leftovers recovery, and rack up more residual damage on the foe. Alongside Substitute, it also lets Heatran PP stall moves with low PP, most notably Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and Alakazam's Focus Blast; these attackers can't do anything of note to Heatran if they run out of their respective moves' PP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tyranitar is a fantastic partner due to setting sand, which becomes incredibly suffocating alongside Heatran's methods of passive damage. Tyranitar also has the ability to set up Stealth Rock while also checking and potentially trapping Pokemon like Starmie and Tentacruel that Heatran can struggle with. Water-types like Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Jellicent are good partners as well, as they can check opposing Water- and Ground-types such as Gliscor and Politoed as well as opposing Heatran, while Heatran checks most Grass-types like Amoonguss and Ferrothorn for them. They can even spread status themselves if Heatran lacks it. Entry hazard setters like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Garchomp make good partners to punish the switches from the opposing team as much as possible. Pokemon that appreciate Heatran's ability to wear down, inflict status on, or outright beat bulkier Pokemon and match up well versus offense are good partners. Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T, Keldeo, and Garchomp pair well for this reason. Spinners like Excadrill and Starmie work well with Heatran, as their support makes it easier for Heatran to switch in and pressure their checks in return. Ground-types like Gliscor and Excadrill take advantage of Heatran wearing down and crippling their checks, namely Rotom-W and Jellicent, while providing utility in Taunt and Rapid Spin, respectively; Gliscor even switches into Fighting-types. Amoonguss and Breloom provide checks to Water- and Ground-types while appreciating Heatran handling and setting up on Steel- and Grass-types and wearing them down or potentially beating counters like Latios and Amoonguss. Latios can soft check Pokemon like Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Politoed and appreciates Heatran's ability to put Tyranitar on a timer with Toxic and beat other Steel-types.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Heatran's typing and bulk let it set up Stealth Rock pretty easily against most bulky Pokemon. Lava Plume ensures Heatran isn't Taunt bait and gives it a spammable STAB move that has a good chance to burn potential switch-ins like Tentacruel and Garchomp. Roar lets Heatran phaze setup sweepers like Reuniclus and Calm Mind Jirachi, which it can struggle against under rain while also punishing the foe with more residual damage. Will-O-Wisp lets Heatran guarantee a burn on most of its switch-ins, namely Tentacruel, Latios, Tyranitar, and Garchomp, which makes it easier to wear them down. Toxic lets Heatran cripple all its switch-ins except Tentacruel and Gliscor and synergizes well with Protect. Protect lets Heatran scout Choice-locked Pokemon, recover health with Leftovers for free, and rack up residual damage. Taunt can be used over Stealth Rock, as it lets Heatran stop setup sweepers like Reuniclus and Jirachi, prevent entry hazards from Pokemon like Tyranitar, and deny use of healing moves from Pokemon like Reuniclus, Slowbro, and Slowking. However, this move is quite team specific and removes one of this set's greatest qualities in being a great Stealth Rock setter.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP / 252 SpD with a Calm nature allow Heatran to shrug off hard-hitting treats like Latios and Alakazam. Leftovers is Heatran's only form of recovery and works well with Protect.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to keep Heatran as healthy as possible so it can switch into and wall what it needs to consistently. Be cautious about coming in directly on Pokemon Heatran appears to check, like Volcarona and Gengar, as they can punish it with super effective coverage. Try to keep entry hazards off your side off the field if possible, as they hurt Heatran's longevity and make it more difficult to switch into what it's supposed to. Set Stealth Rock up when given a free turn from a forced switch or a Pokemon Heatran walls to keep pressure on the opposing team. Use Toxic or Will-O-Wisp to cripple checks susceptible to it, mainly most Water- and Ground-types. If lacking Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, it isn't a bad idea to fish for a Lava Plume burn on the switch. Use Protect to scout Choice-locked attackers like Latios and Landorus-T, regain health from Leftovers, and potentially rack up more Toxic poison or sand damage on the foe. However, be cautious of using Protect against Pokemon that can take advantage of its use by setting up or healing. Avoid letting Heatran get paralyzed, as it will leave Heatran unable to check what it's supposed to, mainly Jirachi and Reuniclus.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Water-types like Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Jellicent are good partners, as they can check opposing Water- and Ground-types as well as opposing Heatran and have good defensive synergy with Heatran. Pokemon that can set up Spikes make for good partners as well to punish switches from the opposing team as much as possible. Ferrothorn is a decent option, thanks to the fact that it's a good Water-type check, takes pressure off Heatran to switch into Pokemon like Latios, and can even provide Knock Off support. Tyranitar is a good partner due to it setting up sand while also checking and potentially trapping Pokemon like Jellicent, Tentacruel, and Starmie that Heatran can struggle with; this is appreciated especially for the latter two, as they can spin away the Stealth Rock Heatran sets up. Tyranitar not needing to run Stealth Rock also makes it easier to keep healthy, as it won’t need to take a hit to set them up and can instead run other sets like Choice Scarf more effectively. Amoonguss and Poison Heal Breloom provide a Water- and Ground-type check while appreciating Heatran switching into most Steel- and Dragon-types for them and setting up Stealth Rock. Excadrill and Gliscor are good partners, as they can provide Rapid Spin support and a switch into Fighting-types, respectively, while taking advantage of the poison and burn damage Heatran spreads with their own Protect. They can also spread Toxic poison in tandem with Heatran to force more residual damage on the foe. Spinners like Excadrill and Starmie work well with Heatran, as they have good offensive synergy with it and increase its longevity, making it easier to switch and pressure the opponent. Pokemon that appreciate Heatran's ability to set Stealth Rock and match up well against offense are good partners. Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T, Mienshao, and Keldeo pair well for this reason. Latios can soft check Water-types like Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Politoed and appreciates Heatran's ability to poison or burn Tyranitar, putting it on a timer, and beat most Steel-types.</p>"

      "Sunny Day Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Magma Storm is able to trap Heatran's natural checks. This, alongside Sunny Day to set up sun and one-turn Solar Beam, allows Heatran to threaten bulky Water-type Pokemon and instantly win the weather war against Politoed. Other targets for Magma Storm include Slowbro, Slowking, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon. The last move is dependent on the team's needs. Earth Power is useful to defeat opposing Heatran, have a perfect accuracy move to hit Excadrill and Magnezone, and have a one-turn move to damage Tyranitar, but using it means Heatran is setup fodder for Dragon-type Pokemon. Hidden Power Ice lets Heatran defeat even specially defensive Gliscor that switch into Magma Storm, and it does heavy damage to Dragon-types that are not threatened by Heatran's Fire- and Grass-type coverage. Leftovers is the preferred item because it mitigates entry hazard damage, but Air Balloon lets Heatran safely trap and defeat Gastrodon and Seismitoad.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>160 Speed EVs let Heatran outspeed Adamant maximum Speed Scizor, uninvested support Landorus-T, and standard specially defensive Excadrill as well as Speed tie with standard specially defensive Gliscor. 96 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature let Heatran 2HKO specially defensive Gliscor with Hidden Power Ice after a Magma Storm, even after Poison Heal.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to bring Heatran onto the field as soon as possible, since this set loses its surprise potential after the early-game. Use Heatran to lure out its natural checks and counters for the Magma Storm + Sunny Day combo to start opening holes in the opposing team. Do not be afraid to use Magma Storm when Heatran is on the field, since this set relies more on Magma Storm's trapping ability than prediction. Its ideal targets are defensive Politoed and Starmie, or a bulky Water-type like Slowking, Slowbro, or Jellicent. If Heatran is at full HP, it can even risk Sunny Day + Solar Beam versus Gastrodon and Seismitoad, since it has about a 50% chance to not be OHKOed by a Ground-type move from either. If using Air Balloon, be careful to keep it intact as long as possible, since scaring away Excadrill, Garchomp, and Gliscor is a huge feat. Always run Hidden Power Ice if using Air Balloon so as to not be overpowered by the tier's Dragon-types. Remember to have Steel-type Pokemon as teammates, since this set has noticeably less defensive presence against powerful wallbreakers like Latios, Alakazam, and Reuniclus.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tyranitar is Heatran's best partner, as it negates rain while forming a phenomenal anti-Psychic-type core with Pursuit. While more passive, Hippowdon and Ninetales are also possible partners to get rid of rain. Pokemon that utilize VoltTurn, like Rotom-W, Magnezone, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Scizor, help safely bring Heatran onto the field, and they love the offensive synergy Heatran provides with Magma Storm's trapping ability. Water-type checks like Latios, Ferrothorn, Breloom, and Jellicent are also very good partners, since you need a backup plan in case Magma Storm misses. Celebi is a phenomenal partner, since it can set up Stealth Rock, bring Heatran safely into battle via U-turn, and help check Keldeo, Rotom-W, and offensive Starmie.</p>"

  "Cresselia": {
    "overview": "<p>Cresslia is a cornerstone of sun teams thanks to its recovery in Moonlight, an otherwise mediocre move, restoring much more HP. This, along with its excellent ability, Levitate, allows Cresselia to wall some of the most powerful Pokemon in OU, such as Garchomp, Dragonite, and Terrakion, which are troublesome Pokemon for sun teams. However, it's unable to threaten anything offensively due to its miserable offensive stats and lack of strong attacks. It's also more heavily pressured by Tyranitar than many other Pokemon due to its reliance on Moonlight for recovery and Tyranitar being able to Pursuit trap it easily. The issue of Moonlight's recovery is similarly crippling against rain teams, with rain teams also having brutally powerful Pokemon like Keldeo and Starmie able to 2HKO Cresselia.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>RestTalk lets Cresselia fully heal itself and cure itself of status. However, it is rather unreliable and forces Cresselia to acquire two move slots to be used effectively. A Chesto Berry can be used with Rest and Recycle; it's slightly more reliable, but it gives Cresselia a severe case of four moveslot syndrome. Psycho Shift and Flame Orb can be used on the defensive set, giving Cresselia the opportunity to spread burns and cripple her counters. Psycho Shift can also be used with RestTalk to spread sleep. Magic Coat can be used to bounce back entry hazards and status. However, it leaves Cresselia with bad four-slot syndrome.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar threatens Cresselia with its STAB Crunch and Pursuit, doesn't take much damage from any of Cresselia's attacks, and significantly cripples Cresselia's longevity by negating its passive recovery and significantly crippling Moonlight's recovery. However, Tyranitar doesn't enjoy getting poisoned by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Scizor</strong>: Scizor can strongly threaten Cresselia with U-turn and Pursuit and set up against Cresselia should it lack Hidden Power Fire. However, Hidden Power Fire does a lot of damage to Scizor, especially in sun.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Tentacruel, Jellicent, Rotom-W, and Politoed can all cripple Cresselia with burn and poison and don't take much damage from any attack Cresselia can dish out. However, all of them except for Tentacruel and Refresh Politoed are severely crippled by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Skarmory can all set up entry hazards against Cresselia; additionally, Ferrothorn and Skarmory don't take much from Hidden Power Fire if sun isn't up.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Reuniclus and Substitute Latias can set up easily on Cresselia due to their good bulk and being able to avoid getting affected by Toxic.</p>",

Hidden Power Fire dents Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Scizor; without it, they could set up on Cresselia. Reflect allows Cresselia to wall physical attackers even more easily, softening the impact of Tyranitar and Scizor's Pursuit, and grants Cresselia's partners more ease in switching into physical threats.

    "overview": "<p>Ninetales's niche comes from its sun-setting capabilities, as Ninetales is otherwise offensively weak, very vulnerable to entry hazards, and loses to common Pokemon like Keldeo, Reuniclus, Starmie, and Latios. Sun teams have generally good matchups against rain teams due to sun removing the offensive prowess of many Pokemon found on rain teams, namely Keldeo and Thundurus-T and the fact Ninetales can burn Politoed and remove its rain with Sunny Day. Sun also lets dangerous Pokemon like Volcarona become even more dangerous thanks to the power boost from sun, lack of sand wearing them down, and opposing weather setters that usually check it being weakened or removed. However, Sun is generally not common in the metagame due to its shaky matchup against sand teams despite Ninetales being able to burn Tyranitar. Ninetales's utility outside of setting sun is also non-existent.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive Nasty Plot set with Fire Blast, Solar Beam, and Hidden Power Ice might seem viable, but Ninetales is outclassed by Heatran and Volcarona as an offensive Fire-type. Toxic could be used in place of Will-O-Wisp to more significantly cripple Pokemon like Gastrodon, Politoed, and Volcarona. However, Will-O-Wisp is superior due to burn already wearing down these Pokemon quickly and the crippling halving of Attack burn provides. Rest can be used in tandem with Chesto Berry to give Ninetales a one-time full heal that can make the difference in outlasting Politoed and Tyranitar. However, it causes Ninetales to lose health in sand every turn and it generally misses the passive recovery of Leftovers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar replaces Ninetales's sun with sand, can punish it for switching with Pursuit, and cripple it with Thunder Wave. However, Tyranitar despises getting burnt by Will-O-Wisp, and Ninetales can even keep sun up when Tyranitar switches in if it uses Sunny Day as Tyranitar comes in.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Keldeo, Tentacruel, Starmie, Rotom-W, and Politoed can all threaten Ninetales with their powerful Water-type moves if sun isn't present, with Politoed able to replace sun with rain and cripple Ninetales with Toxic should it be running it. However, all these Pokemon are crippled by burn reducing their longevity, and Ninetales can use Sunny Day after Politoed switches in to keep sun up.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Latios, Kyurem-B, and Dragonite can all easily break past Ninetales with their powerful STABs, with Substitute + Dragon Dance Dragonite even being able to set up Dragon Dance freely should Ninetales lack Roar. However, Kyurem-B and Dragonite need to be careful to avoid Will-O-Wisp when switching in.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T, Garchomp, Excadrill, and Mamoswine can all OHKO Ninetales easily, even if they need to be careful to not get burnt by Will-O-Wisp. Gliscor can heavily damage Ninetales and comes with the additional benefit of not having to worry about getting burnt once its Toxic Orb activates.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Latios, Keldeo, Alakazam, and Terrakion need to be careful when switching into Ninetales, but can outrun and greatly damage it.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp lets Ninetales cripple switch-ins like Politoed, Rotom-W, and Tyranitar and wear them down, helping it win the weather war. Sunny Day lets Ninetales punish Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Politoed for switching in to change the weather, and makes Ninetales able to beat burnt Politoed lacking Toxic. Pain Split gives Ninetales a modicum of longevity, letting it heal against healthy switch-ins like Tyranitar, Gliscor, and Tentacruel lacking Toxic if sun is up. Protect allows Ninetales to get free recovery if sand isn't up, scout the intentions of Choice item Pokemon like Latios and Garchomp, and rack up burn damage without consequence. Roar can be used instead to phase out setup sweepers like Reuniclus and to rack up entry hazard damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread lets Ninetales survive an Outrage from Choice Scarf Garchomp after Stealth Rock and outrun Modest Hydreigon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ninetales is weak to Stealth Rock, vulnerable to all other entry hazards, and meant to fit on sun stall teams, so entry hazard control is essential. Xatu blocks entry hazards from going up with Magic Bounce, provides a pivot to Ground-type moves, can wear down Tyranitar with Reflect + Rocky Helmet, and pivot Ninetales in safely to reset the weather with U-turn. Mold Breaker Excadrill and Forretress can spin entry hazards off the field, with Mold Breaker Excadrill able to pivot into and threaten Latios and Tyranitar and set Stealth Rock while Forretress can take on Dragon-types like Dragonite lacking Fire Punch. Chansey can keep special threats like Alakazam, Latios, and Volcarona in check, set up Stealth Rock, and benefits greatly from not taking passive damage from sand every turn. Cresselia is able to have much better longevity thanks to Moonlight recovering much more health, letting it wall common threats to sun teams like Terrakion and Garchomp and being able to heal with Leftovers. Cresselia also enjoys Tyranitar getting burnt and worn down so sand can stay off the field and have one of its main counters removed. Volcarona is able to run a bulky Quiver Dance set thanks to its Flamethrower becoming much stronger with the boost fron sun, being able to passively recover with Leftovers, having good anti-hazard support, and Ninetales burning and wearing down checks like Tyranitar, Rotom-W, and Jellicent. Substitute + Dragon Dance Dragonite provides a resistance to Water and immunity to Ground and is able to more easily set up without sand negating its Leftovers. Latias has similar defensive synergy to Dragonite, appreciates Ninetales burning Tyranitar, and keeping sand off the field so it can more easily set up with Calm Mind and sweep.

  "Tentacruel": {
    "overview": "<p>Tentacruel finds its niche as a utility Pokemon on rain teams. Thanks to its good typing, decent stats, and fantastic ability in Rain Dish, Tentacruel is nearly impossible to KO in rain and can check the Pokemon it is supposed to throughout long matches while providing Rapid Spin support and spreading status. Tentacruel's access to Rapid Spin allows it to support Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock such as Tornadus, Thundurus-T, and Volcarona as well as any grounded Pokemon that gets worn down quickly by Spikes. In addition, it does not even have to spin to remove Toxic Spikes. However, Tentacruel's reliance on Black Sludge and Rain Dish for recovery leaves it vulnerable to residual damage, as a burn from Keldeo's Scald or Knock Off from Ferrothorn will leave it far more easy to wear down with entry hazards and U-turn. In addition, when sand is up, Tentacruel has a net recovery of zero per turn. It also is very reliant on Scald to threaten switch-ins and is very passive without it. However, on the right team, Tentacruel's support capabilities make it a great choice.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sludge Bomb is an option for Tentacruel's last slot to 2HKO Breloom and deal a decent amount to Celebi, but it does not hit much else and does not provide as much utility against bulkier teams. It also hits Latios for a reasonable amount of damage and has the chance to poison it. Similarly, Ice Beam is an option to hit Dragon-types such as Latios on the switch and deal heavy damage to Dragonite if it tries to set up, but again it does not offer as much utility as Tentacruel's other moves. Venoshock is another option that allows Tentacruel to OHKO most Breloom but lacks targets outside of it. Finally, Knock Off is an option to remove items such as Leftovers on the opposing Pokemon, leaving them more vulnerable to chip damage, but it leaves Tentacruel unable to defeat Jellicent and does not limit the longevity of every Pokemon that comes on the field as much as Toxic does. Also, an offensive set could be used consisting of Scald or Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, Giga Drain, and Rapid Spin to pick off unsuspecting Water-types such as Gastrodon and Seismitoad and beat Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo, which other Tentacruel cannot, but it lacks consistency and cannot switch into most Keldeo reliably. Also, offensive sets are usually outclassed by Starmie.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Jellicent</strong>: Jellicent is easily the best Ghost-type in OU and therefore a huge roadblock in terms of spinning. It is also immune to Scald thanks to Water Absorb. Though Tentacruel can beat it if it manages to land a Toxic, if Jellicent switches in on a single layer of Toxic Spikes and as a result does not get badly poisoned, Tentacruel will not be able to get past it.</p> <p><strong>Sand</strong>: Sand both deactivates Rain Dish and cancels out Leftovers recovery, making Tentacruel far more vulnerable to the entry hazards it has to switch in on and remove. As Rain Dish is one of the things that make Tentacruel capable of doing its job, this is of paramount importance. In addition, Tyranitar can threaten Tentacruel with Crunch and Pursuit to wear it down quickly in conjunction with sand. However, Tyranitar and Hippowdon cannot switch in easily, as they fear a burn from Scald while also taking chip damage from it and can be annoyed by a combination of Toxic and Protect.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Though they cannot prevent Tentacruel from using Rapid Spin, Water-types such as Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Starmie can come in on Tentacruel relatively safely and threaten it back with their move of choice or potentially burn it, allowing them to beat Tentacruel in a one-on-one situation.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types such as Latios and Hydreigon can come in against Tentacruel with little fear and proceed to fire off a free Draco Meteor. Similarly, Garchomp can do the same but with an Earthquake or Outrage and requires a Lum Berry to avoid a Scald burn or Toxic poison. Dragonite and Salamence can also come in against Tentacruel and set up for free if they have a Lum Berry, making them serious threats as well.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn takes very little damage from Tentacruel's Scald and is immune to Toxic. It can also hit back at Tentacruel, removing its Black Sludge with Knock Off and significantly hampering its longevity, especially if sand is active. In addition, it can hit Tentacruel hard with Power Whip and set entry hazards in Tentacruel's face. However, Ferrothorn is not a primary switch-in to Tentacruel, as a burn from Scald is absolutely catastrophic for it, allowing Tentacruel to sit on it as long as rain is up. It also wears Ferrothorn down very quickly for Tentacruel's teammates and causes Ferrothorn to deal significantly less damage. In addition, Substitute variants of Tentacruel can stall out Power Whip's PP and can try to land a Scald burn in the case Power Whip misses against its Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Reuniclus does not care about anything that Tentacruel can throw at it and can proceed to set up with Calm Mind or threaten Tentacruel immediately with Psychic or Psyshock. Additionally, while it can not switch in, Alakazam can immediately threaten Tentacruel. Starmie is also capable of threatening Tentacruel immediately with Psyshock and Thunder.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Breloom and Celebi do not mind most things Tentacruel can throw at them and can proceed to set up, though they must be wary of the occasional Venoshock or Sludge Bomb. Amoonguss can also wall Tentacruel easily and paralyze it with Stun Spore and chip it with Giga Drain if sand is up or Tentacruel is burned. It also absorbs Toxic Spikes.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Tentacruel's most spammable move, as it has decent power under rain and can cause problems for switch-ins that would otherwise come in easily on Tentacruel, such as Latios, and make them much easier to deal with thanks to burn damage. It notably allows Tentacruel to burn and beat Ferrothorn and Amoonguss, which otherwise cause many problems for it. Rapid Spin allows Tentacruel to provide support for entry hazard-weak teammates and is used well by Tentacruel thanks to its good bulk. Protect allows Tentacruel to scout the move of opposing Choice item users and grants Tentacruel a free turn of recovery, which adds up fast due to the combination of Black Sludge and Rain Dish. Toxic is the best move in the last slot, as it allows Tentacruel to take down Jellicent so it can spin reliably and also cripples Pokemon that resist Scald, including but not limited to Keldeo, Latios, and Rotom-W. Toxic Spikes is an option on Tentacruel to weaken any Pokemon that comes in until they are removed and is particularly useful for winning the weather war against Tyranitar or the occasional Ninetales. It is also better against Natural Cure users such as Starmie, Celebi, and Chansey, as they will just get poisoned again even after switching out to remove status. However, if Jellicent switches in on one layer of Toxic Spikes and as a result does not get badly poisoned, Tentacruel will not be able to break through it by itself. Substitute is an option to block status and Leech Seed, allowing Tentacruel to beat Ferrothorn more reliably and PP stall certain Pokemon in a pinch in combination with Protect. Substitute also allows Tentacruel to beat other Tentacruel by spamming Scald to try to burn them. It can also let Tentacruel force out bulky Starmie, though Tentacruel does not necessarily win, force out Life Orb stall offensive Starmie, and fire off a free Scald against a faster foe if Tentacruel sets up on the switch. In addition, it can use it in attempts to land a Scald burn on Ferrothorn, making it much less likely to break its Substitutes. It also notably beats Amoonguss, which can not break Tentacruel's Substitutes and is then susceptible to being burned by Scald if it stays in. However, Substitute means Tentacruel can not harm Water-immune Pokemon and also makes it totally useless against a healthy Jellicent.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Tentacruel to outspeed every Pokemon up to Jolly Landorus-T, including all Mamoswine and all non-Choice Scarf Excadrill. EV spreads with less Speed can be run if you feel safe towards Landorus-T and Excadrill. 96 Speed EVs and a Timid nature are enough to outrun Jolly Mamoswine and all Dragonite, allowing Tentacruel to use Toxic before it can use Substitute. The 72 remaining EVs can go in either Defense or Special Defense, which is mostly up to preference. Placing them in Defense allows Tentacruel to take hits slightly better from Pokemon such as Scizor and Ferrothorn, but placing them in Special Defense improves damage rolls against Latios and Choice Specs Keldeo.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to bring Tentacruel in against Pokemon such as Keldeo or other defensive Pokemon such as Politoed, Skarmory, specially defensive Heatran, and burned Ferrothorn and spin to clear entry hazards. Be wary of Ferrothorn, however, as Knock Off can hurt Tentacruel's longevity, and it can deal a good chunk to Tentacruel with Power Whip if it does not fear Scald burns. In addition, switching into Politoed is not optimal if it can be avoided, as Scald burns can severely inhibit Tentacruel's ability to spin and check the Pokemon it needs to, and Politoed can also use Refresh to remove any status you afflict upon it. If entry hazards are not an immediately pressing issue and the opponent has Dragon-types or a Jellicent, feel free to use Toxic in order to cripple them as they switch in. If your opponent's main switch-in to Tentacruel is Ferrothorn, use Scald often to chip it down and potentially burn it. Burning Ferrothorn is doubly beneficial for Tentacruel, as it means that Ferrothorn really cannot do much damage back and reduces Tentacruel's future burden of clearing entry hazards. Depending on the matchup and situation, you may be forced to be a bit more cavalier with Tentacruel. For example, if Stealth Rock and Spikes are present on your side of the field, spinning may be more of a pressing issue than if there is only Stealth Rock up, unless you have multiple Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon such as Thundurus-T, Tornadus, Gyarados, Kyurem-B, and Volcarona.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Politoed is the best partner for Tentacruel, as it provides rain support for Tentacruel's Scald and Rain Dish. In return, Tentacruel can remove entry hazards for Politoed, as it is vulnerable to all three types. Ferrothorn has excellent type synergy with Tentacruel and can provide support for your team by means of entry hazards. Also, it can provide counterplay against Reuniclus in the form of Worry Seed if you inflict Toxic on it. Thundurus-T, Tornadus, and Volcarona are all great offensive Pokemon on rain teams and are all vulnerable to Stealth Rock, as well as Spikes and Toxic Spikes in Volcarona's case. Thundurus-T also threatens Jellicent, which is one of Tentacruel's biggest roadblocks when attempting to spin. Breloom is a good partner for Tentacruel, as it can threaten Jellicent, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn, all of which are problems for rain teams in general and Pokemon Tentacruel cannot beat unless they are inflicted with status on the switch. Jirachi makes a good partner because it counters Reuniclus and it can switch into Latios, which is otherwise a huge threat to Tentacruel. Mamoswine is a good teammate for Tentacruel as well, as it can pick off Thundurus-T, Tornadus, Dragonite, Latios, and Garchomp with Ice Shard, all of which pose a large threat to Tentacruel. In return, Tentacruel's Rapid Spin support will keep Mamoswine from being worn down too quickly as a result of entry hazard and Life Orb damage.</p>"

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>Slowbro has a good defensive typing, reliable recovery, and fantastic physical bulk that let it check common Pokemon like Heatran, Garchomp, Terrakion, Dragonite, Keldeo, Mamoswine, and Alakazam lacking Grass Knot or Signal Beam. It also has Regenerator to reduce the long-term effects of entry hazards and make it less crippled by Pursuit when switching out on Tyranitar. It's also not overly passive, since Scald and Thunder Wave can burn and paralyze common checks like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W while it's also able to run coverage options like Ice Beam and Flamethrower to hit Dragon- and Grass-types. However, Slowbro's average special bulk and weaknesses leave it vulnerable to common special attackers like Volcarona, Reuniclus, Thundurus-T, and Latios. Its low Speed forces it to take a hit before attacking or recovering, making it possible to easily overwhelm, especially in tandem with entry hazards. While not passive, Slowbro can struggle to threaten and gets set up on by bulkier Pokemon that aren't crippled by status or hit super effectively, like Reuniclus and Latios. It's quite vulnerable to status, namely poison and burn, from Pokemon like Gastrodon, Tentacruel, Heatran, and Keldeo. It also faces strong competition from other bulky Water-types like Jellicent, Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad as a result of their better typings that let them check Pokemon Slowbro fails to, higher Speed and special bulk, and ability to spread status or set up entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psyshock can be run to punish Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo, Tentacruel, Amoonguss, and do more damage to Breloom and Terrakion. However, it's more niche than Flamethrower and Thunder Wave. Running Grass Knot over Thunder Wave lets Slowbro hit Cloyster, Gastrodon, and Starmie hard and breaks Dragon Dance Gyarados's Substitute, making it unable to setup on Slowbro. Protect lets Slowbro scout what move Choice item Pokemon lock into, which is notable against Latios since it lets Slowbro check what move it locks into before switching to Tyranitar to Pursuit trap it. Trick, in tandem with a Choice Scarf or Flame Orb in the lead slot, can cripple switch-ins like Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Jellicent and steal their Leftovers. However, it's hard to fit, can be ruined by Protect leads, and is hard to pull off consistently since Pokemon like Latios can switch into Choice Scarf variants and Reuniclus can switch into Flame Orb variants. Toxic can be used over Thunder Wave or Flamethrower to cripple switch-ins like Rotom-W, Gastrodon, Jellicent, and Latios alongside Magnezone to trap Ferrothorn that'd otherwise absorb it.

However, losing health in sand is not worth it a lot of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon like Latios, Thundurus-T, Reuniclus, and Rotom-W can all greatly threaten Slowbro with their strong special attacks or set up on it. Pokemon that it should be able to check like Alakazam, Keldeo, and Heatran can also threaten it should they be running an appropriate coverage move.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Slowbro's vulnerability to common residual damage methods like burn, poison, sand, and entry hazards from Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Heatran cause it to be worn down over the course of a game and forced to use Slack Off or switch for Regenerator recovery often, making it easy to overwhelm and take advantage of.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Chople Berry Tyranitar can force a weakened Slowbro into a difficult mind game of Crunch or Pursuit, paralyze it with Thunder Wave, or set up Stealth Rock on it. However, Slowbro can beat a paralyzed or burned Tyranitar and avoid the 2HKO from Crunch if at full health.</p>",

Tyranitar sets sand and can set up Stealth Rock with a Chople Berry set, which also brings Pursuit to trap Reuniclus, Jellicent, and Latios. It also appreciates Slowbro checking faster setup sweepers so it isn't as overwhelmed having to check these threats if running Choice Scarf and burning foes like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W with Scald. Excadrill is an important partner to keep entry hazards off the field, switch into Electric- and Dragon-type moves, pressure Reuniclus, which can use Slowbro as setup fodder, and hit Rotom-W with Earthquake if running Mold Breaker. Ferrothorn sets entry hazards, which are important with Slowbro so it can wear down its switch-ins alongside Scald burns. Ferrothorn also checks stronger Water-, Dragon-, and Electric-types like Rotom-W, Jellicent, and Kyurem-B while providing Knock Off support and appreciating Slowbro checking Fire- and Fighting-types like Heatran, Keldeo, and Terrakion. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock, spread status, and counter Grass-types like Ferrothorn and Celebi as well as Volcarona while benefitting from Slowbro taking on Fighting- and Psychic-types like Terrakion, Keldeo, and Alakazam lacking Grass Knot or Signal Beam. Choice Scarf Latios revenge kills fast Pokemon like Volcarona, can more easily break through burned Pokemon like Ferrothorn, and can cripple Calm Mind Reuniclus with Trick so it can't set up on Slowbro.</p>"

Its higher Speed stat lets it, with a Choice Scarf, outspeed +1 Adamant Dragonite, +1 Gyarados, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Alakazam, and Starmie. This makes Magneton seem appealing to bulkier teams that struggle against them, as Choice Scarf Magnezone gets outsped by the aforementioned Pokemon.

Its ability to trap Ferrothorn and Jirachi is also strictly inferior to its evolution due to Magneton's weaker power. Magnezone also has the benefit of being less one-dimensional than Magneton, as it is able to run an Air Balloon set that better traps Excadrill thanks to its better bulk and power. Outside of this, Magneton is easily punished by common setup sweepers like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Volcarona after it has revenge killed something. Magneton also lets dangerous Pokemon like Latios, Tyranitar, and Excadrill switch in because of its weaker power.</p>",

However, Chansey is rarely seen due to stall being uncommon in the metagame as a result of there being so many strong wallbreakers in the tier. Chansey is forced out by common physical attackers like Dragonite, Kyurem-B, and Breloom, making it need to switch often, which is worsened by Chansey's vulnerability to entry hazards and lack of passive recovery.

    "overview": "<p>Starmie is a prominent offensive Pokemon as a result of its good movepool, Analytic, ability to outspeed Latios and Keldeo, and decent defensive typing, which lets it pivot into Fire- and Water-types like Heatran and Keldeo. These traits make Starmie fit well on hyper offense teams as a strong Rapid Spin user and on rain teams as a devastatingly strong wallbreaker. However, Starmie can struggle to break through common Pokemon that resist its STAB moves and aren't weak to its coverage, namely Ferrothorn, as well as others like Rotom-W and Gastrodon, while offensive Pokemon like Latios and Kyurem-B can take at least one hit from Starmie and OHKO it. Starmie is also quite frail and easily worn down by entry hazards, Life Orb recoil, and sand, making its longevity and ability to switch-in limited despite its typing. Further, Choice Scarf users and Alakazam outspeed Starmie and threaten it with super effective coverage, with Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Scizor even being able to Pursuit trap it. Starmie also faces competition as a fast Water-type attacker from Keldeo, which has more set versatility, can threaten Ferrothorn, and has a better defensive typing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A defensive set with Rapid Spin can be used on sand teams to compress entry hazard removal and a Keldeo and Heatran check into one teamslot; it also burns threats like Rotom-W and Ferrothorn with Scald. However, it's quite passive and unreliable as an entry hazard remover due to Tyranitar, especially Choice Scarf variants, easily Pursuit trapping it. A Choice Scarf set can be used on rain teams to revenge kill boosted threats like Dragonite and Cloyster as well as other Choice Scarf users like Keldeo, Garchomp, and Latios. However, it's quite weak and is generally outdone in this role by Keldeo, which is stronger and has better bulk to take attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Scizor's Bullet Punch; furthermore, Choice Scarf Keldeo still outspeeds threats like +2 Adamant Dragonite. Trick can be used with Choice Specs to cripple switch-ins like Celebi and Gastrodon while letting Starmie switch moves against teams where that's more practical. Grass Knot lets Starmie hit Seismitoad and Gastrodon hard while maintaining coverage on Keldeo and Jellicent. However, it's difficult to justify compared to Thunderbolt or Thunder because they hit Tentacruel, Politoed, Rotom-W, and Keldeo harder. A Recover + three attacks set with Life Orb may seem appealing to improve Starmie's longevity while preserving its strong offensive presence. However, this is usually not worthwhile because Starmie won't find many opportunities to use Recover throughout a game, and it's usually better to just do as much damage as possible to support a partner for the late-game instead.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Scizor can Pursuit trap Starmie should they get on the field safely. However, they can't switch into any move besides Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Bulky Pokemon like Rotom-W, Gastrodon, Ferrothorn, and Chansey can all take at least one hit from Starmie and KO it, set up entry hazards on it, or cripple it with status. However, Rotom-W and Ferrothorn can be overwhelmed easily with entry hazard support, since they lack reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Naturally faster Pokemon like Alakazam, Choice Scarf users like Keldeo, Latios, and Garchomp, and boosted Pokemon like Dragonite can all outspeed and KO Starmie. However, they cannot switch into it safely.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Starmie's longevity isn't great due to its vulnerability to burn, poison, sand, and entry hazards, on top of potential Life Orb recoil, putting it into KO range of faster attackers or letting smart pivoting stall it out.</p>",

      "Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Starmie is a good spinner thanks to it threatening common entry hazard setters like Heatran, Garchomp, and Landorus-T. Ice Beam hits Garchomp, Breloom, Dragonite, and Latios hard while also providing a more accurate move for Landorus-T and Gliscor. Thunderbolt nails Water-types like Jellicent, Politoed, Tentacruel, and Keldeo while also being Starmie's strongest move against Rotom-W; Hidden Power Fire can be used instead if hitting Ferrothorn is more important. However, this leaves Starmie outsped by opposing Starmie, and wearing down Ferrothorn for its teammates with Ice Beam is usually sufficient for checking it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Air Balloon is the preferred item to more easily switch into Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp while also avoiding Spikes damage, keeping Starmie out of KO range of Pokemon like Alakazam. Life Orb can be used to better threaten and wear down foes, with the recoil not being a big deal since Starmie's longevity isn't very important. Analytic is preferred to do more damage to Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W, which often switch into its attacks, making it more difficult for them to pivot into safely. A Timid nature is used to outspeed Latios and Keldeo.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is primarily found on hyper offense teams thanks to it threatening common entry hazard setters and facilitating wallbreakers like Dragonite and Kyurem-B. With Starmie spinning Stealth Rock away, Dragon Dance Dragonite is able to set up much more easily with Multiscale intact, and it appreciates Starmie threatening and wearing down Pokemon like Latios, Keldeo, and Ferrothorn. Volcarona also benefits from Starmie removing entry hazards, which lets it set up on and avoid being revenge killed by Pokemon like Choice Scarf Latios and Focus Sash Alakazam. Starmie also wears down bulky Water- and Fire-types like Jellicent and Heatran for it. Kyurem-B can maximize its great bulk to get on the field and wallbreak without Stealth Rock wearing it down, and it benefits from Starmie's better matchup against faster threats. Offensive Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp and Landorus-T help Starmie break through bulkier targets while directly weakening or removing potential checks. Swords Dance Scizor brings strong priority to revenge kill faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Alakazam. It benefits from Starmie wearing down and beating Fire- and Water-types like Heatran, Keldeo, and Jellicent and forcing Choice Scarf Tyranitar to lock into Pursuit, which lets it set up safely. Offensive Breloom can weaken or take out Water-types and bulky Pokemon like Gastrodon, Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Reuniclus, and it benefits from Starmie beating faster Pokemon like Latios and Dragonite. Starmie fits well on DragMag teams, especially because Magnezone is able to trap and remove Ferrothorn. Latios enjoys Starmie wearing down Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Jellicent so it can break through them.</p>"

Thunder hits Water-types like Jellicent, Politoed, Tentacruel, and Keldeo hard while also being Starmie's strongest move against Rotom-W.

Politoed sets rain, can use Encore to give Starmie a free switch against foes like Calm Mind Reuniclus, and burns Pokemon like Tentacruel and Ferrothorn so they're easier to muscle through with Hydro Pump and Surf. Tentacruel keeps entry hazards off the field, giving Starmie better longevity and letting it check Keldeo more easily. Agility Thundurus-T is able to sweep late-game thanks to Starmie breaking down its checks, with both of them also having a great matchup against frailer offensive teams. Choice Scarf Keldeo is a fantastic revenge killer on rain teams, able to sweep through weakened teams and revenge killing boosted sweepers like Dragonite, Cloyster, and Volcarona. Ferrothorn is able to counter Dragon-types like Latios and Kyurem-B and provide entry hazard and Knock Off support, helping Starmie break through switch-ins like opposing Ferrothorn and Gastrodon more easily. Tornadus can take advantage of the Grass-types Starmie baits in, like Celebi and Ferrothorn, while also wearing down other bulky Pokemon like Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Jellicent.</p>"

  "Gyarados": {
    "overview": "<p>Armed with Dragon Dance, a reliable physical Water-type STAB attack, and two incredible abilities, Gyarados establishes its niche as a dangerous sweeper. Utilizing its solid bulk and rare typing, Gyarados has many switch-in and setup opportunities, pivoting into and threatening top Pokemon like Excadrill, Heatran, Gliscor, Volcarona, Scizor, and Keldeo. Many of the Pokemon it checks are common on hyper offense teams, which grants it a particularly strong matchup against them. The ever-present rain set by Politoed is also a boon to Gyarados, as it clears the sand that cuts into its bulk, and physical checks like Skarmory and Reuniclus can be much more easily muscled through with a boosted Waterfall when rain is present.</p> <p>However, weakness to Stealth Rock and vulnerability to sand severely cuts into Gyarados's defensive reliability, necessitating entry hazard removal support. This is exacerbated by it relying on its bulk and typing to set up directly on Pokemon like Excadrill. Gyarados is also not very immediately threatening, as its middling Speed and mediocre STAB option of Waterfall often require it to use Dragon Dance before it can meaningfully damage teams. This Speed issue persists even after setting up one Dragon Dance, as common Choice Scarf users like Latios and Garchomp often put Gyarados in an awkward situation after it has claimed one KO. Finally and most importantly, Gyarados has a large number of checks, such as Skarmory, Jellicent, Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, Encore Politoed, and Dragonite, which are all quite common and often necessitate different moves to beat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf can leverage its immediate Speed to revenge kill threats and potentially sweep with Moxie's snowballing Attack boosts, but the inability to switch moves is a major hindrance. Natural Gift when paired with a Berry can give Gyarados some powerful and surprising coverage options. Watmel Berry allows Gyarados to make use of a surprise Fire-type coverage option to circumvent Ferrothorn as an answer and do a lot of damage to Skarmory, while Liechi Berry becomes a high-Base Power Grass-type attack, catching Rotom-W and Jellicent off guard. However, this move comes with a lot of drawbacks. Natural Gift is a one-time option, uses up both an item and a moveslot, and forces Gyarados to use Intimidate due to legality issues. Choice Band grants Gyarados an extremely powerful Waterfall when under it's rain, and it can use its immediate power to break down its checks with coverage options. Having said that, Gyarados is a slow Choice item attacker, its STAB moves can be resisted pretty easily, and it does not appreciate being forced to switch out multiple times in the face of Stealth Rock. Rest, Sleep Talk, and defensive investment can be used to turn Gyarados into a mixed wall thanks to Intimidate and its good resistances; however, its Stealth Rock weakness is extremely crippling, and sleep mechanics make it so that Gyarados must burn all its sleep turns without switching out or be forced to play the rest of the game asleep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Stealth Rock, Sandstorm, and Toxic all impede Gyarados heavily and will limit the amount of damage it can do before being KOed. Burns from Will-O-Wisp and Scald are particularly crippling to a physical sweeper like Gyarados.</p> <p><strong>Water-resistant Walls</strong>: While Gyarados has good coverage options, Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Ferrothorn will reliably beat it one on one, while Celebi will beat any variant without Bounce. Other options such as Gastrodon, Amoonguss, and Jellicent can check it after it has taken enough damage. Seismitoad is uncommon, but it can completely wall Bounce variants between Water Absorb and Protect.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Latios, Garchomp, and Excadrill can outrun and take out a weakened Gyarados with their strong attacks.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority Moves</strong>: While Gyarados fortuitously resists Mach Punch and Bullet Punch, it is still susceptible to very strong neutral priority when it's weakened. Mamoswine's Ice Shard, Dragonite's Extreme Speed, and Scizor's Quick Attack can all stop Gyarados after it has been brought to low health.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: While they range in reliability due to coverage and Waterfall flinches, Skarmory, Reuniclus, and Kyurem-B can potentially take a hit from +1 Gyarados and threaten it back.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gyarados's excellent bulk and typing affords it many opportunities to use Substitute, protecting itself from status and weaker moves; from there, it can look to use Dragon Dance repeatedly. It has many opportunities to set up a Substitute, threatening many staples that can't hurt it back like defensive Landorus-T, Heatran, Politoed lacking Encore, Tentacruel, and Excadrill. Substitute also has the added benefit of taking Rotom-W’s Volt Switch, forcing it to switch in again to check Gyarados and take more residual damage in doing so. Waterfall is mandatory as a reliable STAB attack with good coverage, and the 20% chance to flinch can rapidly snowball games if the opponent's primary check is KOed without taking an action. Bounce is used alongside Waterfall, as it gives Gyarados a secondary STAB attack and has decent coverage alongside Waterfall. Bounce also gives an extra turn of Leftovers recovery and hits Water-resistant targets such as Ferrothorn and Jellicent as hard as possible. However, the two-turn nature of the move can result in opponents pivoting to Flying-resistant Pokemon, such as Skarmory and Tyranitar, which could not switch in to bother Gyarados otherwise. Earthquake is a good alternative to Bounce, sacrificing a little power for reliability and granting Gyarados a way more consistent matchup against Politoed and Keldeo, which often run Protect. Taunt can be used over Substitute to directly prevent phazing and Encore attempts while also being useful against status moves like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp. However, Substitute also prevents these status moves from affecting Gyarados in addition to preventing the chance of a Scald burn occurring and allows for better synergy with Bounce, making it overall more useful.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers enhances Gyarados's bulk, granting it recovery in rain and clear weather and offsetting sand damage. It’s especially relevant with Substitute and Bounce, which let Gyarados heal itself while preventing foes from attacking it directly. 168 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Gyarados to outspeed Choice Scarf Latios after two Dragon Dance boosts and neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon like Dragonite and Mamoswine without a boost. 88 HP EVs allow Gyarados's Substitute to withstand Power Whip from a burned Ferrothorn, making it a potential setup opportunity. The remaining EVs maximize Gyarados's Attack. An Adamant nature could be used to give Gyarados better odds to 2HKO common walls after a Dragon Dance, primarily Skarmory. However, an Adamant nature requires Gyarados to invest fully into Speed in order to outrun neutral natured Mamoswine, making itself and its Substitutes much less durable. Intimidate gives Gyarados more defensive utility and Pokemon to set up on. Notably, -1 Excadrill and -1 Scizor are prime Substitute and Dragon Dance opportunities. Moxie trades this defensive reliability for the opportunity to snowball, becoming rapidly difficult to handle if the opponent sacrifices a Pokemon to try and send in their check cleanly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set should be used on rain teams to have the most effect, since rain allows Leftovers to have a net gain in recovery while also strengthening Waterfall to be able to break through bulkier targets without as many boosts. Politoed provides rain and supports the rain-reliant Rapid Spin users this set should be paired with. Rapid Spin support is very important to this set, since Gyarados needs as much HP as possible to reliably set up Substitute and Dragon Dance. Tentacruel in particular has excellent synergy with this Gyarados set; Scald and Toxic allow Tentacruel to spread burns and poison on targets Gyarados loves being statused such as Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Starmie is also a great partner, as its Speed and power allow it to threaten offensive Stealth Rock setters such as Terrakion and Garchomp, and its Analytic-boosted attacks are great at pressuring Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Gyarados especially appreciates this offensive synergy, since it can't run a third attacking move to fill coverage gaps. Starmie is an essential partner without rain support thanks to its reliability on weatherless offense teams. Ferrothorn is a great support pick for its huge number of complementary resistances, ability to set up entry hazards to wear down Gyarados's checks, and its reliability at switching into the many revenge killing attempts aimed at Gyarados. In particular, Lum and Rawst Berry variants of Ferrothorn are amazing at luring in and weakening Rotom-W, which Gyarados appreciates. Keldeo can weaken Ferrothorn and utilize a Choice Scarf set to slice through the hyper offensive teams this set doesn't do quite as well against, while this Gyarados set is more easily able to break down the defensive teams Choice Scarf Keldeo struggles against. Garchomp does a great job deterring Electric-type moves, potentially switching into Rotom-W's Volt Switch and Thundurus-T's Thunder and threatening them back, while many teams are forced to rely on Skarmory to check Gyarados, which Garchomp appreciates being weakened. Thundurus-T is a staple on rain teams that Gyarados can struggle to partner with due to their overlapping types, but Thundurus-T's ability to counter Ferrothorn and do enormous damage early in the game can open the path for a Gyarados sweep. Although Magnezone is very difficult to fit on rain teams, they can pair up effectively on weatherless offense. Magnezone can directly remove Ferrothorn and Skarmory for Gyarados while being able to clear sand with Sunny Day, while Gyarados reliably sets up on Magnezone's common revenge killers such as Excadrill, Heatran, and Landorus-T.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gyarados with two moveslots of coverage can become an immediate threat and a very difficult Pokemon to handle just after one Dragon Dance. Waterfall is a necessary STAB attack that hits the numerous Ground-types in the tier, additionally being able to potentially flinch and push through defensive checks to itself such as Skarmory and Reuniclus. Earthquake is the most reliable coverage option, hitting grounded Water-resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Tentacruel, and Keldeo for solid damage after a boost. For the last slot, Stone Edge gives Gyarados a strong attack with good neutral coverage against many checks like Rotom-W and Air Balloon Jellicent and Starmie while hitting Dragonite and Kyurem-B super effectively. Return allows Gyarados to hit non-grounded Water-resistant Pokemon such as Latios and Rotom-W as well but trades a super effective hit on Dragonite and Kyurem-B for reliable accuracy. Bounce gives Gyarados a second STAB move, allows it to regain HP with Leftovers while in the air, has a nasty paralysis rate, and gives it the strongest attack against Ferrothorn and Breloom. However, it has somewhat unreliable accuracy and is a two-turn move, making it very exploitable when not used in tandem with Substitute. Ice Fang could be used to KO Breloom reliably while still hitting Dragon-types hard, but it is much weaker outside of hitting those targets.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed allows Gyarados to outrun Adamant Dragonite, Adamant Mamoswine, and Modest Heatran before a Dragon Dance. An Adamant gives Gyarados the necessary strength to muscle through bulkier Pokemon, but a Jolly nature 168 Speed EVs is an option to outrun Choice Scarf Latios and Terrakion after two Dragon Dance boosts. Moxie is the preferred ability to snowball Attack boosts and make Gyarados progressively more difficult to handle. However, Intimidate provides Gyarados with more comfortable setup opportunities and defensive presence against Pokemon like Excadrill and Scizor. Leftovers improves Gyarados's longevity, allowing it to not lose health in sand and get health back outside of sand to better check the Pokemon it switches into. Lum Berry is very useful for setting up against Pokemon that could otherwise inflict status, such as defensive Water-types with Scald, and completely flips the Jellicent matchup. Life Orb could be used for as much power as possible, doing a great deal more damage to Gyarados's counters, which is especially useful for Rotom-W, but the constant recoil damage greatly impacts Gyarados's staying power.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gyarados is a natural fit on rain teams, so Politoed is an extremely valuable partner, since Drizzle provides a power boost to Waterfall, and it can create switch-in opportunities for Gyarados through Encore. Rain teams appreciate Gyarados's ability to overwhelm Water-resistant Pokemon, and Gyarados especially needs good entry hazard removal, which rain teams can reliably provide. Tentacruel is an amazing partner for its ability to spin reliably over the course of a game and pressure their shared checks, such as Ferrothorn, Jellicent, and Rotom-W, with Scald burns or Toxic. Starmie is an incredible spinner on offensive teams and can use its coverage options boosted by Analytic to pressure Water-resistant Pokemon. Ferrothorn is another great partner thanks to its excellent defensive synergy with Gyarados, reliably checking difficult matchups such as Rotom-W, Latios, and Politoed. These great defensive traits allow Ferrothorn to find opportunities to set Stealth Rock and Spikes, accelerating the pace at which walls are put into range for Gyarados to KO. Ferrothorn can even choose to go on the offensive with a Lum or Rawst Berry, which can allow it to potentially OHKO Rotom-W from the get-go and absorb Scald burns from Water-types like Gastrodon or Politoed. Latios checks the threats that force out Gyarados, answering Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Breloom quite well and often necessitating Ferrothorn or Tyranitar to check it, weakening either the primary Gyarados check or sand setter. Other wallbreakers that reliably beat or lure Gyarados's checks are important teammates as well. Thundurus-T can switch into and has the power to severely threaten Water-resistant Pokemon like Rotom-W, Jellicent, Ferrothorn, and Gastrodon as well as dissuading Electric-type attacks by virtue of Volt Absorb. Gyarados will be eventually KOed, either by a faster Choice Scarf user or by a bulkier Pokemon that can tank its hits and KO back. Setup Pokemon such as Scizor and Volcarona have an ideal opportunity to boost against Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Latios after it has used a Draco Meteor, and Reuniclus. Magnezone can be used to forcibly remove Ferrothorn and Skarmory, which is especially useful if Gyarados is not paired with Politoed to boost its Waterfall damage against Skarmory. Directly preventing Stealth Rock from being set up is another tactic to facilitate Gyarados on hyper offensive teams, making aggressive Taunt-using leads like Skarmory, Terrakion, and Aerodactyl situationally good partners. Abomasnow as a partner provides a unique way to pressure Ferrothorn thanks to Snow Warning and its damage output from Blizzard or Hidden Power Fire.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Ditto has a unique niche on bulky teams as a revenge killer due to its ability Imposter, which allows Ditto to scout movesets, deter setup sweepers, and matchup well against stall since it has pseudo-infinite PP so long as it can switch around. However, Ditto is far more situational than other revenge killers that can more easily fulfill that role while providing more utility. It is susceptible to all entry hazards, compromising its ability to switch in without a sack or pivot support. It also cannot take advantage of every setup sweeper, as bulkier setup sweepers like Reuniclus, Jirachi, and Gliscor ultimately end up winning against it, further decreasing its value. It is also blanked by Substitute users such as Breloom, Thundurus-T, and Jirachi, further limiting its ability to take advantage of offensive threats it could otherwise come in on and gain momentum against.</p>",

Keldeo and Starmie are better choices, as the former can break past special walls like Chansey and Ferrothorn with Secret Sword, while Starmie has better natural Speed, Electric coverage to hit Politoed and Tentacruel, and Analytic, which further punishes switch-ins. Vaporeon is also outclassed as a defensive Water-type by Pokemon like Rotom-W, Jellicent, Gastrodon, and Slowking as a result of their better typings and longevity letting them check more prevalent threats, including Keldeo, Starmie, Thundurus-T, and Alakazam. Other Water-resistant Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Latios, and Celebi outclass Vaporeon as well, as they have better overall typings, offensive utility, and movepools, and they function outside of rain, making them fit on many more teams than Vaporeon.</p>",

It's very weak, unable to significantly damage metagame staples like Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, Latios, Hippowdon, Celebi, Jirachi, Gastrodon, Reuniclus, and Excadrill. This weakness also makes it easy to block its Volt Switch with a Ground-type, even if running Hidden Power Ice. It also has no notable defensive utility outside of an immunity to Electric, making it very difficult to switch into battle. It's also outclassed by other Electric-types, mainly Thundurus-T due to it also having Volt Absorb and bringing a Ground immunity, much more power, better coverage, and more set versatility between its Substitute wallbreaker and Agility sets. Rotom-W also outclasses Jolteon due to its much better defensive profile letting it check and pivot around common threats, like Alakazam, Keldeo, Gliscor, Excadrill, and Heatran, as well as being able to burn its checks with Will-O-Wisp. Jolteon is also outpaced and revenge killed by common Choice Scarf users like Keldeo, Garchomp, and Latios, making its Speed less of an advantage.</p>",

However, Aerodactyl faces competition from other Stealth Rock setters such as Garchomp, Terrakion, and Landorus-T, as they all have more set versatility and defensive utility, making them easier to fit. Garchomp and Terrakion can run Swords Dance alongside Stealth Rock to wallbreak while setting Stealth Rock, while Landorus-T can run Imprison to prevent Stealth Rock from slower leads and use Explosion to give Cloyster, Dragonite, and other partners a free switch.</p>",

  "Dragonite": {
    "overview": "<p>Dragonite is a popular pick on offensive and bulky teams due to its power and versatility. Offensively, it can run a Dragon Dance or Choice Band set on hyper offense and DragMag teams. Extreme Speed grants it offensive utility against faster threats like Volcarona and Thundurus-T, which is especially good against other hyper offense teams. It also has good bulk and a decent defensive typing, which grants it an immunity to Spikes and some good resistances. These resistances not only give it setup opportunities against Pokemon like Volcarona and Keldeo lacking Ice-type coverage, but also let it run a Substitute + Dragon Dance set that beats bulkier forms of counterplay. Multiscale further aids in this defensive utility, letting Dragonite take pretty much any one hit, which is often essential for using Dragon Dance. However, Dragonite's lackluster Speed tier leaves it outsped and revenge killed by common offensive Pokemon like Alakazam, Garchomp, Latios, Keldeo, and Mamoswine without a boost, as well as by Choice Scarf users like Latios, Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Garchomp even after a boost. Many of these Pokemon can also take +1 Extreme Speed if healthy. Dragonite is Stealth Rock-weak and thus can struggle to take advantage of its bulk and ability. It sometimes lacks the right coverage move to hit its targets and, at +1, fails to KO bulky targets like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Reuniclus, and Tyranitar.</p>",

      "3 Attacks Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Extreme Speed picks off weakened Pokemon that threaten to KO Dragonite, like Latios, Alakazam, Garchomp, Keldeo, and Scizor. It also lets Dragonite take out other setup sweepers like Volcarona, Thundurus-T, and Garchomp. Earthquake hits all Steel-types that aren't Skarmory or Ferrothorn and dents Tyranitar, while Fire Punch hits all Steel-types that aren't Heatran. Earthquake should be used over Fire Punch on DragMag teams, which can trap Skarmory and Ferrothorn. Extreme Speed can be dropped if hitting all Steel-types is important, but this is generally ill-advised due to Extreme Speed's utility.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>While a Jolly nature would outspeed bulkier variants of Thundurus-T and Timid Heatran unboosted, and Choice Scarf Keldeo and Latios at +2, Adamant is crucial for the extra damage against bulky Pokemon. Plus, Dragonite can revenge kill with Extreme Speed anyway. Lum Berry is the most consistent item; it lets Dragonite set up on Pokemon like Rotom-W and Jirachi lacking Ice-type coverage and cures Outrage confusion. Yache Berry can be used to set up on Pokemon with Ice-type coverage like Reuniclus, Alakazam, Landorus-T, Thundurus-T, Gliscor, and Starmie.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Dragonite in after a Pokemon faints or on an attack that can't KO it after Multiscale is broken. Set up Dragon Dance while at full health if possible, or at least on Pokemon that can't KO Dragonite. If an opposing Pokemon checks a majority of Dragonite's team at high health and outspeeds Dragonite, it may be worth it to hit the threat with sacrificial Extreme Speed, since teams using this Dragonite feature many potential wincons. Try to keep Stealth Rock off the field so Dragonite has an easier time coming in and setting up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Dragonite set is primarily found on hyper offense teams thanks to its resistances, power, and Speed after Dragon Dance. Offensive Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp and Landorus-T secure KOs for Dragonite while weakening or removing potential checks. Offensive Starmie can keep Stealth Rock off the field while outspeeding and threatening Pokemon faster than Dragonite, like Latios, Garchomp, and Keldeo. Volcarona can set up on Pokemon that revenge kill Dragonite, like Choice Scarf Latios and Focus Sash Alakazam, while Dragonite does the same with Choice Scarf Keldeo locked into a Water-type move. Swords Dance Scizor brings another strong priority move and sets up on the Choice-locked Dragon- and Ice-type moves Dragonite forces foes to use, with Dragonite doing the same for Fire- and Water-type moves used against Scizor. Offensive Breloom can weaken or take out Steel-types and bulky Pokemon early-game, like Skarmory, Excadrill, Gliscor, Landorus-T, Reuniclus, and Tyranitar, while also bringing another priority move to better handle offensive threats.</p> <p>This Dragonite set also fits well on DragMag teams due to Magnezone trapping Steel-types like Skarmory and Ferrothorn so Dragonite can use Outrage freely and run Earthquake over Fire Punch without opportunity cost. Magnezone can also bring Dragonite in safely with Volt Switch if running a Choice item or force in Ground- and Fighting-types, letting Dragonite double switch in. Jirachi sets up Stealth Rock and pivots with U-turn. It can also take Dragon- and Ice-type moves from Pokemon like Latios, Salamence, Alakazam, Politoed, and Reuniclus. Other Dragon-types, namely Choice Scarf variants of Garchomp and Latios, exploit the holes Dragonite creates to sweep far more easily late-game while also having better matchups against offensive teams. Choice Band Kyurem-B is able to break the opposing team open with its powerful Outrage so Dragonite can more easily sweep. Excadrill can work as a Rapid Spin user, and Dragonite can set up on Pokemon that are commonly used to check it, like Politoed, Ferrothorn, and Tentacruel.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute gives Dragonite room to punish switches and set up Dragon Dance on Pokemon that struggle to break through it. Dragon Claw is the only attack because it has fantastic neutral coverage and doesn't lock Dragonite in like Outrage. Further, Dragonite can set up on and outlast most bulky Ground-types and Steel-types that can take Dragon Claw, like Landorus-T, Gliscor lacking Ice Fang, and Heatran lacking Roar or Hidden Power Ice.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This EV spread makes Dragonite's Substitute survive specially defensive Jirachi's Iron Head most of the time and, even if Multiscale is broken, always take specially defensive Jirachi's Thunder and Rotom-W's Volt Switch. The Speed EVs alongside a Jolly nature let Dragonite outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after a boost, most notably including Alakazam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dragonite should set up Substitute on switches and Pokemon that struggle to break through it, like Ferrothorn, Breloom, defensive Jirachi, and Tentacruel, as well as Pokemon like Reuniclus, Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Heatran should they lack Hidden Power Ice. Attempt to bring in Dragonite while Stealth Rock isn't on the field to keep Multiscale intact. Use Roost often to let Multiscale help set up Dragon Dance, especially if Substitute is up. If Dragonite is being used on a rain team, aim to keep rain up and sand away so Dragonite can heal with Leftovers every turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits very well on rain teams as a game-ending sweeper, which they can lack, that destroys passive rain teams and punishes some sand teams. Politoed brings rain and can take Ice-type attacks while also baiting in bulky Water- and Grass-types like Tentacruel, Breloom, Celebi, and Rotom-W and Gastrodon lacking Ice-type coverage, giving Dragonite good setup opportunities. Politoed can also run Encore to punish Pokemon like Hidden Power Ice Reuniclus. Tentacruel is mandatory to remove Stealth Rock and keep Multiscale intact, and it also takes on Steel-types like Scizor, Heatran, and Excadrill and takes Ice-type attacks. It can even set Toxic Spikes to put switch-ins on a timer. Dragonite can take on Volcarona that have Psychic and beat passive rain teams in return. Thundurus-T is able to wallbreak effectively with its three attacks set, which takes out answers to Dragonite like Skarmory, Excadrill, and Encore Politoed. The two of them together also suffocate sand teams, which can only really handle one of them before the other comes in to finish the job. Choice Scarf Keldeo is a fantastic revenge killer on rain teams, and it eases the burden on Dragonite to beat offensive teams. Ferrothorn is able to counter Dragon-types like Latios and Kyurem-B, as well as providing another Water resistance to handle Pokemon like Starmie. It also provides Stealth Rock and Spikes while appreciating Dragonite's resistances to Fire- and Fighting-type moves from Pokemon like Volcarona, Breloom, and Keldeo.</p> <p>Dragonite can also work on sand teams because rain teams often struggle to break through this set. Tyranitar is needed a majority of the time, and it can set up Stealth Rock for Dragonite with a Chople Berry set that also Pursuit traps answers like Latios, Alakazam, and Hidden Power Ice Reuniclus. It can even take out or weaken Steel-types with coverage moves. Meanwhile, Dragonite takes advantage of potential Tyranitar switch-ins like Rotom-W, Keldeo, Breloom, and Gliscor. Excadrill is also a required partner, using Rapid Spin to clear Stealth Rock while also pivoting into some Dragon-type moves and offensively answering Steel-types and Hidden Power Ice Reuniclus. Meanwhile, Dragonite is able to take advantage of checks to Excadrill like Rotom-W, Keldeo lacking Ice-type coverage, and Gliscor. Like with rain teams, Ferrothorn counters Dragon-types, provides another Water resistance, sets entry hazards, and appreciates Dragonite's resistances to Fire and Fighting. Magnezone traps Steel-types like Skarmory and, if running Air Balloon, Excadrill. Rotom-W can bring Dragonite in safely with Volt Switch while burning opposing Pokemon. It also provides a more reliable Water-resistant Pokemon for foes like Starmie and can better check Hidden Power Ice and Roar Heatran.</p> <p>This Dragonite set can sometimes work on hyper offense teams as well thanks to its great matchup against rain, which hyper offense can often struggle with, and other teammates backing it up against most sand and offensive teams. Offensive Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp and Landorus-T weaken or removing potential checks like Steel- and Water-types. Offensive Starmie can spin Stealth Rock away so Dragonite's Multiscale stays intact while also outspeeding and threatening Pokemon faster than Dragonite, like Garchomp, Latios, and Keldeo. Volcarona can run Hidden Power Ground to destroy sand teams utilizing Heatran, which this Dragonite set sometimes struggles with, while Dragonite does really well in the rain matchups Volcarona struggles with. Swords Dance Scizor brings strong priority to revenge kill faster Pokemon and sets up on the Choice-locked Dragon- and Ice-type moves Dragonite forces foes to use, with Dragonite doing the same for Fire- and Water-type moves used against Scizor.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Extreme Speed allows Dragonite to pick off weakened Pokemon that can threaten to KO it like Latios, Alakazam, Garchomp, Keldeo, and Scizor. It also lets Dragonite take out other setup sweepers like Volcarona, Thundurus-T, and opposing Dragonite before they get out of control. Fire Punch is able to hit Steel-types that aren't Heatran hard. Dragon Claw brings a STAB move that doesn't lock Dragonite in for multiple turns, making it safe to throw out a lot of the time. Superpower is able to OHKO Tyranitar as well as most Steel-types, with the notable exceptions of Skarmory and Jirachi. It also 2HKOes almost anything that doesn't resist it, including Rotom-W, Garchomp, and Politoed. Earthquake lets Dragonite hit Steel-types outside of Skarmory and Ferrothorn hard, especially Jirachi, while also OHKOing Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Multiscale allows Dragonite to take pretty much any one hit from full health and fire off an attack, forcing the opponent into the awkward position of having to take a really powerful attack no matter what, especially if they're running a bulkier team that lacks many Pokemon that can outspeed or KO Dragonite.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dragonite is predominantly used to break open the opposing team so a teammate can finish them off late-game. Bring Dragonite in on resisted and neutral attacks like any attack from Breloom, Reuniclus's and Volcarona's STAB moves, Tyranitar's Crunch, and Magnezone's Thunderbolt to get momentum. Dragonite can also be brought in as a foe uses Stealth Rock or on a double switch. Outrage is a good move to use in the absence of resilient Steel-types or an easy sacrifice due to Dragonite's near-perfect coverage and ridiculous power. If such a Pokemon can take Outrage, punish it for switching in with a coverage move, since Pokemon that resist Dragonite's coverage but can't take Outrage will usually avoid switching in. Extreme Speed should be used to revenge kill faster Pokemon like Latios, Keldeo, boosted Dragonite, Garchomp, Volcarona, and Thundurus-T.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Dragonite set fits well on DragMag teams due to Magnezone trapping Steel-types like Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Jirachi, letting Dragonite easily spam Outrage for Dragon-type partners to clean through weakened teams late-game. Magnezone can also bring Dragonite in safely with Volt Switch if running a Choice item, or it can force in Ground- and Fighting-types so Dragonite can double switch in. Jirachi sets up Stealth Rock so Dragonite is even harder to switch into and uses U-turn. It can also take moves like Latios's Draco Meteor and Ice-type coverage from Pokemon like Reuniclus and Politoed. Other Dragon-types, namely Choice Scarf variants of Garchomp and Latios, massively benefit from the holes Dragonite creates to sweep more easily late-game, and they also have better matchups against offensive teams. Offensive Starmie can spin Stealth Rock away so Dragonite's Multiscale stays intact while also outspeeding and threatening Pokemon faster than Dragonite, like Garchomp, Latios, and Hidden Power Ice Keldeo.</p> <p>This set also fits well on rain teams thanks to it wallbreaking for many rain sweepers and rain giving it the support it needs. Politoed is mandatory for rain teams, and it clears sand—so Dragonite's Multiscale isn't broken passively—while also taking Ice-type attacks and burning Dragonite's potential checks like Ferrothorn and Jirachi with Scald. Dragonite, meanwhile, can threaten Pokemon that rain struggles with, like Breloom, Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and Celebi, and revenge kill weakened Latios, Rotom-W, and opposing Dragonite with Extreme Speed. Taking out Tyranitar is particularly beneficial to win the weather war. Substitute + Agility Thundurus-T loves Dragonite's ability to crack open Pokemon like Celebi, Excadrill, and Gastrodon so that it can sweep late-game. In return, Thundurus-T can take out Skarmory, Landorus-T, and Jirachi. Tentacruel keeps Stealth Rock off the field and also takes on Ice-type attacks and Steel-types like Scizor, Heatran, and Excadrill. Dragonite can take on Volcarona that have Psychic in return. Starmie and Excadrill can work on rain as more offensive Rapid Spin users, but they aren't as reliable as Tentacruel with this set due to their lesser defensive profile. Choice Scarf Keldeo can wipe out the opposing team late-game, once Dragonite breaks the right holes for it, while also acting as another way to take out boosted sweepers.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Haban Berry can be run on the 3 attacks Dragon Dance set for Choice Scarf Latios and Garchomp, which otherwise easily stifle a sweep. However, it isn't as consistently useful as Lum Berry, and Dragonite can take them out with Extreme Speed or sacrifice itself so a partner can set up on the Choice-locked attack. Waterfall could be used with rain on the Choice Band set to hit Steel-types hard, in addition to acting as a good midground move against sand teams that don't use Ferrothorn as their Steel-type. A mixed or special set may seem good due to Dragonite's wide movepool and power. However, it's outdone in these roles by Pokemon like Latios, Keldeo, Heatran, Alakazam, and Jirachi. Defensive Dragonite may also seem like an enticing prospect as a result of Multiscale and its resistances. However, Dragonite's typing isn't very special, and this set's passivity makes it ultimately inferior to other defensive Pokemon with better utility, like Rotom-W, Celebi, and Heatran.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Faster Pokemon that can hit Dragonite super effectively, like Latios, Alakazam, Keldeo, Garchomp, Mamoswine, Starmie, and Terrakion, make Dragonite fear switching in. However, these Pokemon can fall to Extreme Speed when sufficiently weakened and can't switch in safely. Meanwhile, bulkier Pokemon like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Tyranitar, and Reuniclus can take at least one of most Dragonite hits, even when boosted, and hit it back super effectively. However, Tyranitar falls to boosted Earthquake or Choice Band Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: While most Dragonite sets have coverage to get around Steel-types, it will often be unable to hit at least a few of them depending on its choice of moves. Should Fire Punch be dropped, Skarmory is able to wall Dragonite. Ferrothorn can do much of the same, except it also needs to watch out for Superpower from the Choice Band set and can be more easily overwhelmed over time due to lacking Skarmory's instant recovery. However, Magnezone can trap and KO most Steel-types, even if Dragonite lacks the appropriate coverage move to take them out.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis makes Dragonite unable to outspeed anything without using Extreme Speed, while burn cuts Dragonite's Attack and always leaves Multiscale broken. Poison also keeps Multiscale broken. However, the 3 Attacks Dragon Dance set often mitigates status by running Lum Berry.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock breaks Multiscale and does considerable damage, bringing Dragonite into 2HKO and OHKO range of many attacks.</p>"

  "Mew": {
    "overview": "<p>Mew is unique among Psychic-types in BW OU, running a fully defensive set with Will-O-Wisp to cripple common answers such as Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Scizor, and specially defensive Skarmory rather than breaking through them with coverage. Its typing, bulk, and instant recovery make it a solid answer to opposing Psychic- and Fighting-types; Mew walls Alakazam and Reuniclus should they lack Shadow Ball or Signal Beam, can shut down Technician Breloom and Terrakion should it not switch into their boosted coverage, and additionally can survive most unboosted attacks from physical threats such as Dragonite, Garchomp, Excadrill, and Mamoswine. Mew has Taunt and theoretically limitless coverage to cripple Ferrothorn and Tentacruel, as well as taking advantage of Reuniclus, Poison Heal Gliscor, and Poison Heal Breloom, which typically shrug off burns.</p> <p>Mew is quite niche in the current metagame for numerous reasons—its inability to do anything to dangerous Fire-types such as Heatran and Volcarona, its extreme vulnerability to status, and its general lack of offensive utility compared to other Psychic-types such as Alakazam, Reuniclus, and Latios. Heatran gets a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp and threatens to heavily damage Mew, and Volcarona often outspeeds Mew and threatens to sweep with Quiver Dance while OHKOing with a boosted Bug Buzz. Mew also is deathly afraid of any status despite Synchronize statusing the foe—Toxic and burn greatly decrease its longevity, while paralysis stops it from using its Speed to prevent setup. Mew often relies on its Speed and Roost to survive foes rather than resistances or raw numerical bulk—therefore, it especially struggles against rain teams, as the secondary effects of Scald and Thunder often let strong sweepers such as Keldeo, Latios, and Thundurus-T 2HKO it. Mew is generally outclassed by Jellicent, which shares the same moveset while having a far better typing and Water Absorb to and block Rapid Spin and check Keldeo better despite Mew's superior Speed and better ability to check Psychic-types. Mew is also hard to fit on teams compared to other Psychic-types given of its lack of resistances and offensive utility.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp is easy to spread because the tier lacks many pivots into it, and it cripples many prominent Mew checks such as Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Skarmory while shoring it up against physical attackers such as Garchomp, Dragonite, and Mamoswine. It also puts a timer on dangerous threats such as Keldeo, Latios, and Thundurus-T that can break through Mew but lack recovery. Taunt makes Mew sure Mew isn't set fodder and stops bulky Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Reuniclus, Politoed, and Skarmory from healing, setting up entry hazards, and removing status. Night Shade gives great neutral coverage, isn't subject to Mew's average Special Attack, and takes advantage of Pokemon with low HP stats such as Alakazam and Rotom-W. Ice Beam instead takes a more offensive approach to hit the metagame's many prominent Ice-weak Pokemon such as Gliscor, Breloom, Garchomp, Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Latios hard. Beware of not doing much damage to prominent Ice-resistant foes such as Heatran, Jellicent, and Volcarona, some of which also ignore burn, as well as bulky Pokemon like Reuniclus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Mew commonly runs a specially defensive EV spread to better wall Psychic-types such as Alakazam and Reuniclus and avoid OHKOs from Keldeo's rain-boosted attacks. Will-O-Wisp complements this investment by crippling physical threats. The Speed used here outspeeds Jolly Breloom, Jolly Cloyster, Adamant Dragonite, and Adamant Mamoswine.</p> <p>However, Mew can also shift its bulk into Defense to better answer Excadrill and physical Dragon-types like Garchomp, Dragonite, Salamence, and Kyurem-B, which can hit it hard before it can burn them or if Will-O-Wisp misses. Mew has many possible Speed investments—some common benchmarks run from 20 EVs to outspeed neutral Breloom, Cloyster, and Politoed up to 164 EVs with Timid to outspeed Jolly Excadrill. Keep in mind that increasing the Speed investment makes it harder for Mew to survive boosted hits, while being too slow leaves Mew vulnerable to Jolly Swords Dance Breloom, as well as preventing it from using Taunt on Dragonite and burning Mamoswine before it uses Substitute.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mew fits best as a supporter for other strong Psychic-type wallbreakers such as Alakazam, Latios, and Reuniclus, as it generally burns strong answers to Psychic-types early on such as Tyranitar, Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. On sand structures, Mew especially helps Alakazam and Latios, as it cripples Tyranitar and is a strong answer to bulky Reuniclus without Shadow Ball. This lets them run more offensive sets such as Life Orb, or an additional utility move on Alakazam or Choice Specs on Latios. Mew also enjoys entry hazard support to take advantage of the large number of switches it forces, as well as further wearing down Tyranitar. Some prominent setters that provide fantastic synergy with Mew include Ferrothorn and Skarmory—Ferrothorn checks Water-type attackers and uses Knock Off, while Skarmory helps against Psychic-types and checks strong physical attackers like Garchomp and Excadrill. Spikes in particular helps, as many prominent answers to Psychic-types that Mew wants worn down are grounded, such as Tyranitar and Jirachi; additionally, entry hazard damage helps to limit threats that can break through Mew, such as Keldeo and Volcarona. Excadrill can also help Mew against its weakness to entry hazards while likewise being effective in sand—in turn, Mew can answer prominent Excadrill checks such as Gliscor and Skarmory with Ice Beam and Will-O-Wisp, respectively. As Mew opens up prominent sand structures to Heatran and especially Volcarona, some additional counterplay is mandatory. For Heatran, Air Balloon Heatran, Garchomp, and Rotom-W can be helpful. Volcarona often requires multiple answers to handle different coverage choices—an example pairing is specially defensive Gliscor with Leftovers Keldeo or Heatran. Additionally, Tyranitar sets that can handle Volcarona such as ones with Thunder Wave or Tanga Berry, can be effective due to Mew switching into Focus Blast from Alakazam and Reuniclus, negating the need for Chople Berry. Mew also needs backup against rain teams, as, although Mew often shuts down Politoed, Ferrothorn, and Tentacruel early in the game with Taunt and Will-O-Wisp, it struggles with the secondary effects Scald and Thunder. It's also commonly 2HKOed by rain-boosted attacks from Keldeo. Poison Heal Breloom can sponge weak Scalds, while Latios and Rotom-W are good pivots into weather sweepers such as Keldeo and Starmie.</p> <p>Mew also often finds itself on weatherless balance teams due to its ability to answer Psychic-types. On these teams, Mew generally enjoys the same types of support: entry hazards, help against Heatran and Volcarona, and support against rain teams. However, with the additional teamslot, stronger cores built around leveraging Mew's ability to spread burn are possible. Offensive Latios sets are particularly effective, such as Calm Mind and Choice Specs, as they take advantage of Mew burning common special Dragon-type switch-ins such as Tyranitar and Ferrothorn while answering Keldeo and Thundurus-T. An offensive Landorus-T set, such as Swords Dance with or even Double Dance, can back up Mew against Breloom's and Terrakion's Fighting-type attacks while being a strong offensive threat. Substitute + Air Balloon Heatran has particularly good synergy, enjoying Mew spreading burns and answering defensive Reinclus—which sets up on it—while it answers opposing Heatran and Volcarona, which set up on Mew. Slowking and Poison Heal Breloom can also be effective, as Mew can help answer Tyranitar and bulky Psychic-types, while they in turn support Mew against rain.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Mew has access to almost every move in the game; however, due to its mediocre typing, Speed, and offensive stats, other moves are often outclassed. Mew can run a Stealth Rock suicide lead set that prevents both opposing Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin by using Taunt and Explosion. Azelf often outclasses Mew here, though, as it is faster and possesses a stronger Explosion. Mew learns both Nasty Plot and Swords Dance and a wide range of coverage moves like Aura Sphere, Fire Blast, Drain Punch, and Sucker Punch. However, Latios and Alakazam typically outclass it offensively, as they are faster and don't need setup to immediately threaten other Pokemon. Transform can copy Spikes users such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory to get layers up as well as potentially copying Volcarona's boosts and defeating it after it tries to set up on Mew. Reflect Type can help against Dark-types and more broadly grant resistances and immunities, for example a Toxic immunity when used on a Steel-type. Worry Seed can remove Magic Guard and Poison Heal, opening up Reuniclus, Alakazam, and Breloom to status and other residual damage. Heal Bell can potentially save Mew and its teammates from debilitating status if Mew switched into Toxic Excadrill or Keldeo, as an example. Should Mew want to run a niche move, generally Taunt is the most replaceable.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran and Volcarona are the biggest threats to Mew due to their immunity to burn. Heatran gets a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp, sets up Substitute, status, or Stealth Rock easily, and threatens with strong Fire-type attacks in return, while Volcarona often outspeeds Mew, easily sets up, and can potentially sweep the whole team.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Mew is vulnerable to all forms of residual damage—as Mew relies on its bulk and recovery, the extra damage from status, entry hazards, sand, and Leech Seed often get it KOed. Mew often exposes itself to Scald burns from Politoed and Tentacruel, and unexpected Toxic from Pokemon like Keldeo and Excadrill on the switch before it can Taunt. Toxic is especially damaging, as Mew often wants to stay on the field a long time to spread burns, heal, and bother foes with Taunt. Mew's vulnerability to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and especially Toxic Spikes often forces it to stay and spam Soft-Boiled while burn chips the foe, lest it take too much damage to come in again.</p> <p><strong>Extremely Powerful Attackers</strong>: Extremely strong attacks such as Keldeo's rain-boosted Hydro Pump and boosted Outrage from strong Dragon-type attackers such as Garchomp, Kyurem-B, and Dragonite can compromise Mew, especially if it sacrifices itself to burn them.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Tyranitar and Hydreigon can threaten Mew with their super effective STAB, with Choice Scarf variants of Tyranitar and most Hydreigon also outspeeding it. However, they should be careful about taking a burn, Tyranitar especially.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Latios, Starmie, Keldeo, Terrakion and Alakazam outspeed and overpower Mew if they have the right coverage or support, such as Calm Mind-boosted Draco Meteor for Latios and rain for Starmie and Keldeo. Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi has the added distinction of having 101 HP Substitutes to prevent Night Shade from breaking them in one hit.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp-immune Pokemon</strong>: Xatu completely counters Mew with Magic Bounce, which also lets it cripple Mew by switching into Will-O-Wisp or Taunt, but Synchronize can force a burn on it should this happen. Magic Guard and Poison Heal Pokemon are immune to burns and can set up on Mew with impunity if they outspeed it or Mew lacks the proper coverage move. As an example, Gliscor can set up Swords Dance on Mew if it lacks Ice Beam, while Reuniclus can set up on a paralyzed Mew.</p>"

  "Xatu": {
    "overview": "<p>Xatu has a niche in the OU metagame as the best Magic Bounce user and one of the best sources of entry hazard control. Xatu is able to completely shut down passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Hippowdon while also being a soft check to most Ground- and Grass-types. However, it has mediocre base stats, a shallow offensive movepool, and an exploitable defensive typing that makes it vulnerable to a lot of the metagame's offensive threats, including very effective Stealth Rock users like Garchomp, Heatran, and Jirachi. Once these Pokemon set Stealth Rock, Xatu's Stealth Rock weakness becomes a thorn in its side.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Xatu needs Reflect or Feather Dance to stand a chance against Tyranitar, so other moves should only be considered over U-turn or Toxic. Heat Wave is Xatu's best way to damage Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Excadrill, Scizor, and Forretress but has very low utility in general, especially in rain matchups. Hidden Power Ice can better deal with Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T, but it's very weak outside of those targets. Psychic and Air Slash are Xatu's best STAB options, and they can be used as emergency Breloom answers, but they are normally very weak. Protect can be used to scout Choice-locked Pokemon, but it lets Tyranitar easily Pursuit trap Xatu even with Reflect or Feather Dance, so you may as well run it in that moveslot. Skill Swap can be used to defeat any variation of Poison Heal Gliscor and make Xatu an emergency check to Poison Heal Breloom and badly poisoned Reuniclus, but losing Magic Bounce enables the opposing team's entry hazards. Thunder Wave, Light Screen, and Wish are Xatu's other support options for more defensive builds, but Toxic is generally the preferred move in those teams. Leftovers can be used if the extra damage of Rocky Helmet isn't needed, but this turns Xatu into a very passive Pokemon and lets Tyranitar fish for Crunch Defense drops. A set with dual screens, U-turn, and Light Clay is also possible, but this is done better by Espeon because of its base Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offensive Stealth Rock users</strong>: Xatu's biggest issue is its Stealth Rock weakness, so Stealth Rock users that can KO or threaten it out are problematic. Heatran can heavily damage Xatu with Magma Storm or Lava Plume, effectively defeating it or scaring it away to use Stealth Rock. Terrakion threatens an immediate KO with Stone Edge, letting it freely set up Swords Dance, Substitute, or Stealth Rock. Jirachi can threaten to KO Xatu with Thunder or Iron Head flinches to safely set up Stealth Rock, but sets reliant on the latter must be wary of Reflect + Rocky Helmet. Offensive Ground-types like Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Excadrill scare Xatu away with strong attacks or setup moves in order to safely use Stealth Rock. Mold Breaker Excadrill in particular can set up Stealth Rock freely.</p> <p><strong>Rain Pokemon</strong>: Politoed loves using Xatu as a way to safely activate Drizzle, and it 2HKOes Xatu with Scald. With rain up, Tentacruel and Starmie can freely use Rapid Spin or their STAB moves with almost no penalty against it. Tornadus threatens Xatu out with Hurricane, so it can grab momentum with Substitute, Tailwind, or U-turn. Keldeo also threatens an immediate KO with its Water-type attacks in rain. Jirachi can freely set up a 101 HP Substitute on Xatu and threaten it with perfect accuracy Thunder.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Reuniclus can use Xatu to set up Calm Mind or Trick Room with almost no penalty, and it threatens Xatu with Thunder, Hidden Power Ice, or Shadow Ball; however, chip damage from Night Shade and U-turn can force Reuniclus to spend a turn healing. Volcarona can use Xatu to safely set up Quiver Dance, but it needs to watch out for Toxic if it's lacking Lum Berry. Gliscor can set up Swords Dance on Xatu with almost no penalty, since it can outstall Feather Dance's PP and heal Night Shade damage with Protect + Poison Heal, but it must be wary of the rare Hidden Power Ice or Skill Swap. Poison Heal Breloom can use Xatu to set up Swords Dance or Bulk Up, as it can use Protect + Poison Heal to negate Night Shade damage; however, Xatu wins if sand or hail is up, or if it's carrying Skill Swap or a STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Choice Scarf Tyranitar can heavily damage Xatu before it can set up Reflect, effectively defeating it. Slower Tyranitar can also defeat Rocky Helmet Xatu by using Ice Beam or Stone Edge, or a non-Rocky Helmet variant with a Crunch Defense drop, opening opportunities to set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Powerful Dragon-types like Latios, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon threaten an immediate KO with their STAB moves. Pokemon like Dragonite, Latias, Kyurem, and Salamence can use Xatu as setup fodder for Substitute, Calm Mind, or Dragon Dance.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Rotom-W can heavily damage Xatu with Hydro Pump or steal offensive momentum via slow Volt Switch. Magnezone scares Xatu away immediately with Thunderbolt or Volt Switch. Thundurus-T can force Xatu out to safely set up Substitute or Agility.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roost is Xatu's best recovery move and can help it by removing its Volt Switch weakness. Night Shade breaks Substitute and does good damage to the vast majority of the metagame. Reflect and Feather Dance have basically the same function: weaken Tyranitar so it can't Pursuit trap Xatu. They also have the utility of softening physical offensive pressure for Xatu's teammates. Reflect has more PP and helps Xatu's teammates even if the foe switches out, so it's generally superior, but Feather Dance never needs renewal turns and can be stacked, helping Xatu stall out Tyranitar that get Crunch Defense drops or use moves that don't activate Rocky Helmet like Stone Edge and Ice Beam. Feather Dance is also less exploitable by Swords Dance sweepers like Gliscor and Breloom. U-turn is Xatu's best option to keep momentum and avoid being setup fodder, since it is a bit frail and passive, but Toxic can be used to remove a bit of Xatu's passivity if its teammates don't care about the momentum U-turn generates. However, Toxic makes Xatu vulnerable to Reuniclus and Celebi. Rocky Helmet, alongside Reflect or Feather Dance, lets Xatu outstall a Tyranitar that tries to Pursuit trap it, as well punish Landorus-T's U-turn, Breloom's Facade, Skarmory's Brave Bird, and Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP and 184 Defense EVs let Xatu never be 2HKOed by standard Tyranitar's Crunch, even with sand damage, after Reflect or Feather Dance. 72 Speed EVs make Xatu faster than all Tyranitar. Impish is the preferred nature if U-turn is being used. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 208 Def / 48 SpD with 30 Speed IVs can be used to underspeed utility Gliscor so it can't set Stealth Rock after Xatu's U-turn, and to never be 2HKOed by Naive Landorus-T's Hidden Power Ice, even with sand up, but this spread makes Xatu susceptible to being trapped by fast offensive Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Xatu's main function is to prevent entry hazards, so don't be afraid of sending Xatu out against hazard setters. Play smart with switches, U-turn, and Night Shade so opposing Pokemon can't grab momentum or use Xatu as setup fodder. Use Roost when Xatu must be active to block a crucial entry hazard that can prevent its teammates from setting up or Choice Scarf cleaning. If facing Tyranitar, use Reflect or Feather Dance as soon as possible to avoid being KOed by Crunch or Pursuit. Be wary of Knock Off users like Ferrothorn and Seismitoad, since they can effectively lure Xatu in and remove its item, allowing it to be trapped by Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Xatu fits best in balance teams. In those structures, it's common to see bulky Water-types or Water-immune Pokemon like Seismitoad, Jellicent, and Slowking as well as bulky Steel-types, like Heatran and Ferrothorn. Offensive Ground-types like Excadrill, Gliscor, Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Landorus-T use the offensive momentum Xatu can generate with U-turn. Excadrill in particular is an awesome option, as it can use Xatu's Magic Bounce to drop Rapid Spin for a setup move in Substitute or Swords Dance. Pokemon that love having Spikes users neutered, like Hippowdon, Jirachi, Scizor, Amoonguss, and Celebi, are also valuable teammates, since they can cover some of Xatu's type weaknesses. Xatu also finds itself as a central piece of most sun-oriented teams. In those, Pokemon like Ninetales, Cresselia, Chansey, and Blissey are very good defensive partners. More offensively, Pokemon like Victini, Dragonite, Kyurem-B, Kyurem, Salamence, and Ditto love Xatu's hazard control. Xatu's most ingenious partner, however, is Volcarona, which despises Stealth Rock and can use Reflect for more setup opportunites.</p>"

  "Politoed": {
    "overview": "<p>Politoed is one of the most prominent Pokemon in BW OU for one reason: its ability to put permanent rain on the field. This alone makes it one of the best support Pokemon in the metagame, as it brings out the full potential of Pokemon such as Keldeo, Tentacruel, Tornadus, and Thundurus-T. In addition, Politoed is capable of spreading status around the opposing team, allowing you to wear it down far more easily. Politoed's main shortcoming is its middling stats, as it is not capable of dishing out or soaking up significant amounts of damage. Its mediocre defensive stats are exacerbated by its vulnerability to all types of entry hazards and lack of reliable recovery.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam is an option to damage Pokemon such as Breloom, Latios, and Dragonite on the switch, but it is hard to fit onto a set and these Pokemon are better handled by Politoed's teammates anyway. Perish Song puts Pokemon such as Calm Mind Reuniclus and Substitute + Dragon Dance Dragonite on a timer and can be used to force out other Pokemon, but it isn't as immediately effective as Encore. A Choice Scarf set can be used to surprise and outspeed an opposing Pokemon and KO them, acting as a decent cleaner late-game and crippling Pokemon with a fast Encore, but it compromises Politoed's longevity and Politoed isn't really fast or strong enough to be a good Choice Scarf user anyway. A Choice Specs set can be used to deal heavy damage out of the gate with Hydro Pump, but it sacrifices longevity and there are better wallbreakers for rain teams anyway. Both Choice Scarf and Choice Specs can leave Politoed extremely vulnerable to Pursuit, making it tougher to keep rain up over the course of a game. A Rest + Chesto Berry set can be run, but it sacrifices a moveslot and the passive recovery of Leftovers, and Rest can only be used once without sacrificing a significant amount of momentum. Custap Berry can also be run with Endeavor to catch the opponent off-guard and significantly cripple a Pokemon, but it lacks consistency. In addition, Psychic can be used to hit Tentacruel, Breloom, and Toxicroak, but it is hard to justify over Politoed's other moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Weather Changers</strong>: Ninetales can switch into Politoed's Scald relatively easily and replaces rain with sun, nullifying Politoed's main supportive capability. Tyranitar and Hippowdon also change the weather in addition to canceling out Politoed's Leftovers recovery, and Tyranitar can also use Pursuit to quickly wear Politoed down, but they can't enter directly into a Scald.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Poison Heal Breloom and Celebi can switch into boosted Water-type attacks without taking much damage. In addition, they don't fear a Scald burn or Toxic and can use Politoed as setup fodder. Ferrothorn is immune to Toxic, scares out Politoed with Power Whip, and can set up entry hazards in its face. Amoonguss is immune to Toxic and can scare it out with Giga Drain. However, Ferrothorn and Amoonguss both hate being burned by Scald.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types such as Latios, Hydreigon, and Kyurem-B take little from Scald and can respond with their powerful STAB moves. Dragonite can threaten Politoed immediately with a Choice Band Outrage or set up with its Substitute + Dragon Dance set. Latias and Kyurem can use Politoed as setup fodder for Calm Mind or Substitute, respectively. However, none of them appreciate a Scald burn, Toxic, or Encore.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Jellicent and Gastrodon are immune to Scald, can wall Politoed that are not carrying Toxic, and can cripple it with Taunt or Will-O-Wisp in Jellicent's case or Toxic in Gastrodon's. Seismitoad can wall Politoed all day, as it often runs Refresh, and can cripple Politoed with Toxic, Knock Off, or a Scald burn. Toxicroak is immune to Scald and Toxic, but it needs to be careful of Encore.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Thundurus-T and Rotom-W can deal heavy damage to Politoed with their STAB moves. In addition, Rotom-W can switch into Politoed relatively safely, as it resists Water.</p> <p><strong>Status-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Chansey, Blissey, and Celebi take little from Scald and can shrug off burns or Toxic with Natural Cure or Aromatherapy. Reuniclus, thanks to Magic Guard, takes no damage from status and can set up on Politoed lacking Encore or attack it directly if running Thunder. Defensive Starmie and Milotic resist Scald and can shrug off any status with Recover + Natural Cure or Refresh, respectively.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald packs a decent punch when boosted by rain. One of its most important aspects, though, is its burn chance, meaning it can cripple Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Tentacruel that can't afford to be chipped down. Protect allows Politoed to stall for additional Leftovers recovery and burn or Toxic damage. In addition, it can be used to scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Latios, allowing you to play around them more safely. The last two moveslots depend on your personal preference and team. Refresh is an excellent move to help deal with Pokemon such as Tentacruel, Heatran, and opposing Politoed that spread status, allowing your Politoed to stay in the game longer. Notably, it allows you to use Politoed as your main switch-in to opposing Scalds so that you do not need to risk Politoed's teammates being burned. Encore is an option to deal with Pokemon such as Calm Mind Reuniclus and Substitute Breloom, which otherwise set up on Politoed for free. Toxic can be used to cripple Politoed's other switch-ins such as Latios, Jellicent, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W. Note that while running Toxic + Encore is viable, it leaves Politoed worn down very quickly by passive damage such as status, sand, and entry hazards, and thus Politoed will require more caution switching into status users.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers improves Politoed's longevity and alleviates its vulnerability to entry hazards. Politoed runs Defense EVs and a Bold nature to serve as a switch-in to Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Tyranitar and reduce Pursuit damage. However, a specially defensive spread with a Calm nature is also viable to take hits from special attackers such as Latios, Reuniclus, and Alakazam, and allows it to better handle chip damage from moves like Rotom-W's Volt Switch. Running additional Speed EVs is an option to get the jump on slower Breloom variants and use Encore against them, as Breloom can quickly become a problem for rain teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Politoed's primary objective in a game is to avoid being KOed and keep rain up. Therefore, it is critical to be mindful of its HP. That said, rain teams tend to be more offensive in nature, so it is likely that Politoed will be called upon to act as a temporary buffer against opposing threats. Take care when using Protect or Encore, as either can give a free switch to an opposing Tyranitar, both replacing rain with sand and giving Tyranitar a chance to use Pursuit on Politoed, which can go a long way in winning the weather war. As it runs Protect, Politoed is great at scouting Choice item users such as Latios and Keldeo, so you can double switch Politoed into them and play around them. Feel free to use Scald liberally, as the chip damage even without a burn can be significant, and landing a burn can be huge against Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Latios, and Rotom-W.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A great many Pokemon pair well with Politoed's rain. Politoed's best partner is arguably Tentacruel, which becomes one of the most difficult to KO Pokemon in the game when rain is active thanks to Rain Dish and is almost mandatory on rain teams. Tentacruel can use Rapid Spin to clear entry hazards, improving the longevity of its entire team, and has similar switch-ins to Politoed, meaning they can wear down each other's checks with repeated Scalds and Toxics. Toxicroak is another Pokemon that greatly benefits from rain healing it, and it is an excellent counter to opposing rain teams. Tentacruel and Toxicroak are both solid switch-ins to opposing Keldeo as well, which can cause tremendous damage under rain. Ferrothorn and Jirachi have their Fire weaknesses reduced by rain, can set up entry hazards, and are great switch-ins to opposing Dragon-types such as Latios that can do major damage otherwise. Ferrothorn can also use Knock Off to remove the Leftovers of other Pokemon, most notably other Ferrothorn, making it easier for your offensive Pokemon to break through them and for Politoed and Tentacruel to chip them down with Scalds and burns. Breloom also has its Fire weakness alleviated by rain, and it can switch into Pokemon such as Rotom-W that threaten Politoed and notably pairs well with Jirachi. The most prominent offensive teammate for Politoed is Keldeo, which becomes an immensely powerful wallbreaker with Choice Specs or a great cleaner with Choice Scarf, and it can run other sets to take advantage of Politoed's rain as well. Starmie and Gyarados are also Pokemon that can take advantage of the power boost to Water-type moves granted by Politoed's rain. Thundurus-T and Tornadus have perfect accuracy with Thunder and Hurricane, respectively, in rain, and both Pokemon can force damage onto an opposing Tyranitar, helping keep rain up. They can also provide some defensive utility, switching into Ground-types such as Excadrill and Landorus-T. Latios is another Pokemon that is found on a large number of rain teams, checking opposing Keldeo and Thundurus-T, crippling Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Reuniclus with Trick, and overall causing mayhem for the opposing team with its powerful attacks. In addition, its Surf is powered up by rain, making Surf a valuable tool for late-game cleaning, and it benefits from Pokemon like Thundurus-T and Tornadus weakening Tyranitar. Dragonite appreciates the removal of sand and the reliable spinning that Tentacruel provides, which let it make better use of Multiscale with its Choice Band, mixed attacker, and Substitute + Dragon Dance sets. Kyurem and Kyurem-B also appreciate the removal of sand and are capable of switching into Grass- and Electric-types that threaten Politoed to force them out. Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Mamoswine can check Thundurus-T and set up Stealth Rock. Mamoswine can also pick off Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Latios with Ice Shard, and it takes little from Ice-type attacks thanks to Thick Fat, making it a decent offensive check to a weakened Thundurus-T.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump allows Politoed to 2HKO Tyranitar after Stealth Rock, guarantee the OHKO on Thundurus-T after Stealth Rock, and threaten more damage on would-be switch-ins such as Reuniclus and Clefable. Surf is a more reliable option with more PP. Scald allows Politoed to threaten burns on Pokemon that don't care as much about taking Water-type attacks such as Rotom-W, Tentacruel, Amoonguss, opposing Politoed, and Ferrothorn. Toxic can alternatively be used to hit Pokemon that would typically wall Politoed such as Jellicent and Gastrodon while also guaranteeing status instead of relying on Scald. Ice Beam allows Politoed to revenge kill Garchomp, Dragonite after Multiscale is broken, Breloom, and weakened non-Choice Scarf Latios. Encore is used to lock slower setup sweepers like Reuniclus and punish Substitute attempts from Pokemon such as Keldeo, Mamoswine, and Poison Heal Breloom.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and a Timid nature allow Politoed to revenge kill +1 Dragonite and Alakazam. Maximum HP over Special Attack allows Politoed to more freely switch into attacks such as Tyranitar's Crunch and Alakazam's Psychic in order to check them more comfortably without having to sacrifice a Pokemon to get Politoed onto the field.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Politoed should be used when your team wants additional insurance against common fast threats like Alakazam and Dragonite but can't afford to fit Choice Scarf on their rain attackers. Pokemon such as Calm Mind Keldeo, Nasty Plot Thundurus-T, and Choice Specs or Calm Mind Latios make for great partners by wearing down Politoed checks such as Amoonguss, Celebi, Jellicent, and Gastrodon. Poison Heal Breloom also makes for a great partner, as it's able to take advantage of the Pokemon that Choice Scarf Politoed forces in like Rotom-W, Blissey, and Tentacruel and use them as a setup opportunity. Tentacruel and Starmie both make great partners, providing Rapid Spin support while also appreciating the rain for longevity and more breaking power, respectively.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump compensates for its shaky accuracy with incredible power in the rain, notably 2HKOing Bold Rotom-W. If a more reliable alternative is preferred, Surf or Scald can be used either in place of or alongside Hydro Pump. Surf's higher power can still 2HKO less sturdy Pokemon resistant to Water such as Keldeo and Slowbro, allowing it to be a very consistent midground attack. Scald's nasty burn chance allows Politoed to still spread status on usual targets such as Tentacruel and other Politoed while still being quite a powerful attack. Ice Beam primarily shatters Dragon-types such as Latios and Dragonite, but it also does great damage to Grass-types such as Celebi and the occasional Amoonguss. Focus Blast rips 60% off even the most specially bulky Ferrothorn, making Politoed one of the most effective lures for Ferrothorn available for rain teams; however, the commonly maligned accuracy makes this a riskier move than even Hydro Pump, which can still 3HKO Ferrothorn. Focus Blast also targets Kyurem-B and Abomasnow, which can be important to hit immediately. Hidden Power Grass is important coverage for the three most common Water-immune Pokemon, Jellicent, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad,though Politoed needs Stealth Rock to guarantee the 2HKO on maximum HP Jellicent.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack makes Politoed as powerful as possible, which is very important when it relies so heavily on barely 2HKOing Pokemon such as Jellicent with its coverage moves. Maximum Speed is used in order to reliably outrun the previously mentioned Jellicent as well as Pokemon around base 60 Speed such as Magnezone and Scizor. Modest is preferred for as much power as possible, though a Timid nature provides a notable jump in Speed for Pokemon such as Breloom, defensive Celebi, and neutral-natured Mamoswine and Dragonite.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Politoed brings the tier-warping Drizzle and should always be found on dedicated rain teams, but the offensive nature and lack of longevity of this set mean that rain teams with Choice Specs Politoed should be aggressive and fast paced. Ferrothorn is an excellent defensive pivot for any rain team, checking Pokemon that rain struggles with such as Latios and Rotom-W while providing entry hazards. Ferrothorn with Lum or Rawst Berry is particularly appreciated by Choice Specs Politoed, as the ability to shrug off Will-O-Wisp or a Scald burn once is very valuable to any fast-paced team. Thundurus-T forms an extremely powerful core with Choice Specs Politoed, carrying the raw firepower between the two to break nearly any defensive core with correct prediction. They also appreciate each other's defensive traits. Thundurus-T's immunity to Electric and Ground helps in playing around Rotom-W and Protect Gliscor, while its resistances to Ferrothorn's STAB attacks, and access to Focus Blast is invaluable to rain and its eternal struggle against Ferrothorn. Politoed in turn can pivot into Tyranitar at least once and replace Sand Stream with Drizzle as well as use its resistance to Ice to switch into a Mamoswine targeting Thundurus-T. Latios is very versatile on any rain build, helping handle a slew of threats such as Keldeo, Thundurus-T, and Terrakion while most commonly either helping Politoed break down the opposition with a Choice Specs or revenge kill boosted sweepers like Dragonite and Volcarona with Choice Scarf. Choice Specs Politoed and rain more generally struggle with Spikes and the Psychic-types of the tier. Spinners users such as Starmie, Excadrill, and Tentacruel can clear hazards while bringing their own brand of wallbreaking or defensive utility. Starmie reaches a crucial Speed tier which alongside a powerful Hydro Pump and its coverage, helps combat hyper offensive teams and Latios. Excadrill's unique typing and access to Mold Breaker allow it to pivot around Electric-, Psychic-, and Dragon-types problematic to rain such as Rotom-W, Alakazam, and Latios, allowing the user to bait an easier move to resist or even outspeed and threaten the foe with Choice Scarf Earthquake. Tentacruel is similarly very good against hyper offensive teams just like Starmie, and it provides excellent longevity thanks to its great bulk and persistent healing with Rain Dish. Steel-types with a neutrality to Fighting, specifically Scizor and Jirachi, can flip the weakness to Psychic-types on its head and either provide speed control with a Choice Scarf or set up for a sweep. While both are infamous for their effectiveness with U-Turn, Scizor can more quickly and more reliably remove Psychic-types with a much more powerful U-turn or Pursuit, while Jirachi's enormous movepool allows it to revenge kill a wider range of threats or provide support through moves like Trick and Healing Wish.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Espeon is unable to carve out any sort of niche in the metagame because it's completely outclassed by all the other Psychic-types in the tier. Offensively, Alakazam, Reuniclus, and Latios all outshine Espeon with their better Speed, bulk, power, movepools, ability to set up, and flexibility in set choice that also lets them fit on more team archetypes. Defensively, Espeon is lacking in any defensive profile compared to Reuniclus, Latios, and Xatu. Xatu in particular outclasses Espeon as a Magic Bounce user because of its aforementioned better bulk alongside its immunity to Spikes, more reliable recovery in Roost, access to U-turn to pivot in teammates safely, and ability to actually take on Tyranitar with Reflect + Rocky Helmet. As a lead dual screens setter on hyper offense, Espeon is outdone by Azelf and Mew due to their access to Explosion, letting them get teammates on the field safely while still being able to keep entry hazards off the field with Taunt.</p>",

  "Slowking": {
    "overview": "<p>With its useful typing, good defensive stats, and awesome ability in Regenerator, Slowking claims its spot in BW OU as one of the very few effective counters to Keldeo. Due to its high Special Defense, Slowking can also shrug off special hits from top tier threats like Latios, Alakazam, and Tornadus. Its problems are its very low Speed and average physical bulk, which make Slowking a target for U-turn users like Landorus-T and Scizor as well as powerful physical attackers like Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Garchomp.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast to have a perfectly accurate move, but its power loss is big, and it can prevent Slowking from KOing its main target, Ferrothorn. Future Sight can be used alongside Dragon Tail to force damage on Pokemon that are weak to it, like Breloom and Keldeo, but the randomness of Dragon Tail makes this a bit unreliable. Toxic is another option, but Slowking's moveslots are valuable, and spreading status is normally done better by other Pokemon. Protect lets Slowking get out of KO range against strong Pokemon like Keldeo and Mamoswine while also letting it scout for Choice-locked moves and stack Leftovers recovery or sand damage, but it's hard to find a moveslot for it. Calm Mind can be used on a physically defensive set to have a backup cleaner, but this job is better done by Slowbro or Reuniclus. Nasty Plot can be used to more effectively threaten sand teams, but it costs a valuable move slot and can struggle to get KOs even at +2 due to Slowking's relatively low Special Attack. Lack of power is also why offensive Trick Room sets struggle to be worthwhile. Grass Knot can be used to KO Gastrodon and Seismitoad while doing decent damage to Jellicent, but it lacks other targets. Signal Beam can be used to pressure Celebi while damaging other Psychic-types but hits little else. Magic Coat, Block, or Disable can be used as a way to defeat other balance structures, but it's very difficult to find a moveslot for them. Reflect can be used to prevent Slowking from being Pursuit trapped by Scizor and Tyranitar while supporting its teammates with the Defense boost, but Pursuit users are normally afraid of being burned by directly switching into Scald anyway. Hail is an option on weatherless teams to remove sand, rain, and sun. Eject Button can be used alongside a Pursuit user to instantly remove Latios, but the lack of Leftovers reduces Slowking's utility throughout the game, especially if sand is up. A set with Choice Specs + Trick can be used to get surprise KOs or to cripple Slowking's common switch-ins, but it becomes very mediocre once the surprise factor wears off. A set with maximum Defense investment and a Bold nature maximizes Slowking's defensive utility against sand at the expense of its reliability against rain offense</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>VoltTurn users</strong>: Rotom-W can burn Slowking with Will-O-Wisp, use it as a Pain Split target, or directly damage it with Volt Switch, only fearing a Scald burn or the rare Toxic. Scizor threatens to OHKO Slowking with Choice Band or Life Orb-boosted U-turn, but it must watch out for a Scald burn or Fire Blast. Landorus-T can heavily damage Slowking with Earthquake and U-turn, but it can't directly switch into Slowking. Tornadus similarly uses Hurricane and U-turn but it also doesn't like to directly switch into an attacking move or Thunder Wave. Thundurus-T and Magnezone can threaten Slowking immediately with Volt Switch or a stronger Electric-type move, but they have a hard time switching into an attacking move.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Tyranitar creates a deadly mind game with Crunch and Pursuit, especially if it's a more offensive variant. Scizor and Weavile also force Pursuit mind games. However, all of those Pokemon must watch out for a Scald burn and, if running Choice items, can be effectively scouted with Protect should Slowking be running it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Celebi takes little damage even from Fire Blast and can use Slowking to heal, set up Stealth Rock or Nasty Plot, or threaten it immediately with a Grass-type move. Ferrothorn can deal massive damage to Slowking with Power Whip, remove its item with Knock Off, or use it to stack entry hazards, but it must be wary of Fire Blast or a Scald burn. Amoonguss can wall any Slowking lacking Psyshock or Fire Blast. Breloom can threaten an immediate OHKO with Technician Bullet Seed or heavily damage Slowking with Seed Bomb from Poison Heal sets, but it can't switch into Psychic, Fire Blast, or Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Kyurem-B only cares about Scald burns and Thunder Wave, and it threatens an immediate OHKO with Outrage or Fusion Bolt. Choice Specs Hydreigon threatens a 2HKO with Dark Pulse, but it must be wary of Ice Beam and Thunder Wave. Latios and Latias can set up Calm Mind on any Slowking lacking Dragon Tail, Thunder Wave, or the rarer Toxic. Similarly, Dragonite can use non-Dragon Tail Slowking to set up Dragon Dance or Substitute, as Ice Beam isn't an OHKO if Multiscale is active. Kyurem can use any Slowking to set up Substitute and can PP stall it with Roost and Protect. Swords Dance Garchomp and Dragon Dance Salamence can use Slowking to set up if they are holding Yache Berry, or if Slowking is lacking Ice Beam or Dragon Tail.</p>",

      "Special Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Slack Off lets Slowking wall Keldeo, Latios, Alakazam and Reuniclus. Scald is Slowking's best offensive move option due to its ability to cripple Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and bulky Water-types. Dragon Tail lets Slowking phaze Pokemon that can try to set up on it, like Calm Mind Reuniclus and Latios. Alternatively, Ice Beam is Slowking's best option to not be setup bait for Substitute users like Dragonite, Garchomp, and Breloom while still pressuring Latios and specially defensive Gliscor. Fire Blast is mainly for Ferrothorn, which can otherwise use Slowking to stack Spikes. It also nails other Grass-types like Celebi and Breloom. However, Psyshock is an option that lets Slowking damage Water-types, especially Keldeo, Jellicent, and Tentacruel, while also hitting Terrakion and defeating Toxicroak, Amoonguss, and Breloom. Finally, Thunder Wave keeps dangerous setup sweepers like Quiver Dance Volcarona in check while crippling other fast threats like Alakazam, Latios, Keldeo, and Tornadus for Slowking's teammates. While Dragon Tail + Ice Beam is also a viable option, this combination requires specific support to work considering it leaves Slowking exploited by Water-types and Ferrothorn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP with 180 Special Defense EVs alongside a Calm nature let Slowking avoid a 2HKO from Choice Specs Keldeo's Hydro Pump in rain after Stealth Rock and avoid an OHKO from +1 Volcarona's Bug Buzz without entry hazard damage. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 232 Def / 24 SpD with a Calm nature can be used to improve Slowking's general utility and still take Substitute Thundurus-T's Thunder while not being 2HKOed by Mamoswine's Earthquake and reducing Pursuit damage. However, this spread leaves Slowking unable to check Volcarona or Choice Specs Keldeo in rain if Stealth Rock is up. A Bold nature can also be considered because it makes it easier to take Tyranitar's Pursuit and other physical attacks from Pokemon like Gliscor, Mamoswine, and Garchomp while still being able to take on threats like Keldeo, Alakazam, and Latios.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Slowking to wall strong special attackers like Keldeo, Latios, and Alakazam, and use Slack Off as soon as its HP drops below 67% because it usually needs to be at full health to safely check those Pokemon. Spam Scald early-game to burn Pokemon that can otherwise freely switch into Slowking, like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Be smart with when you use potential coverage moves because it's the surprise factor that will make them work most of the time. If using Psyshock, Ice Beam, or Fire Blast, only reveal them when you're sure Slowking will get the KO or permanently cripple its targets. Use Dragon Tail if a Pokemon that can normally use Slowking as setup fodder enters the field, like Reuniclus, Latias, or Volcarona, and if Spikes is up, as Slowking can force a lot of switches. Avoid getting Slowking statused, since burns and poison make it easier to KO and paralysis can keep it from using Slack Off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slowking is vulnerable to all entry hazards, so using it alongside Rapid Spin support is a must. Because of this, its best partner is Mold Breaker Excadrill, which can also deal with Slowking's Electric-type weakness and even defeat Rotom-W. Pokemon that can switch into Rotom-W and other Electric-types like Latios, Poison Heal Breloom, Amoonguss, and Celebi are important partners. Slowking also loves to be paired with Tyranitar because it can remove Reuniclus, one of Slowking's biggest problems, while setting up sand to help it defeat rain structures and helping Slowking check Latios. Other Pursuit users like Scizor and Weavile are also usable. Slowking needs entry hazard support to be used effectively, especially Spikes, so Ferrothorn or Skarmory is strongly recomended. Other Stealth Rock users like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Heatran are also very good choices. On the offensive side, Pokemon that can help with setup sweepers that Slowking can't deal with are appreciated. Choice Specs or Choice Scarf Latios is an awesome partner because it can check Thundurus-T and cripple setup Pokemon with Trick. Choice Scarf Garchomp can check Volcarona and help against Thundurus-T and DragMag teams. Dragonite can also be used to check Volcarona and revenge kill setup sweepers with Extreme Speed, but it isn't quite as good on sand teams. Mamoswine can deal with weakened Thundurus-T and Dragon-types with Ice Shard and loves Slowking's defensive support. Magnezone can trap and remove the two most common Spikes users, Ferrothorn and Skarmory, while pressuring Excadrill if using Choice Scarf or Air Balloon.</p>"

  "Forretress": {
    "overview": "<p>Forretress provides excellent team support and utility with Rapid Spin and Spikes along with possessing a great Bug / Steel typing, an impressive base 140 Defense stat, and a decent base 75 HP stat. These traits allow Forretress to check some of the scariest threats in the tier, including Mamoswine and Excadrill, and be one of the few defensive checks to Choice Band Kyurem-B. Forretress's great movepool sets it apart from other Steel-types: access to both Rapid Spin and Spikes is entirely unique, Earthquake allows it to threaten the most common Rapid Spin users in Tentacruel and Excadrill, and Pain Split and Volt Switch offer Forretress longevity and pivoting, respectively.</p> <p>However, its middling Special Defense stat means it can't repeatedly take Draco Meteors from Latios without running low on health, which is an important role to fill for any team. It also is a prime trapping target for Magnezone and Heatran; the former can eliminate it without much issue while being able to float over Earthquake with an Air Balloon, while the latter can force it out with Magma Storm while getting Stealth Rock up in the process. Forretress also fails to spin versus the premier spinblocker Jellicent, which can force it out with Will-O-Wisp, and it cannot repeatedly keep entry hazards off the field while being worn down by Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs and Skarmory's Rocky Helmet. Forretress is also too weak to damage Reuniclus and Volcarona, which can set up on it with ease. Similarily, other setup wallbreakers like Swords Dance Garchomp and Swords Dance Breloom can capitalize on its inability to do meaningful damage to them. Forretress also suffers from having too many options that it wants to run, which leads to it sometimes lacking certain coverage moves to hit the likes of Kyurem-B, Gliscor, and Excadrill.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Forretress can make use of Sturdy, both Stealth Rock, Spikes, Rapid Spin and a Custap Berry in order to try and lead off the game with both hazards and hopefully none on its own side, but this is outclassed by Skarmory due to Taunt. Forretress can use Pain Split to gain recovery from a healthier Pokémon. However, it is unreliable at that role, and using it makes Forretress unable to either hit Dragon-types like Dragonite and Kyurem-B, or unable to hit Steel-types like Excadrill and Jirachi. Other Utility moves like Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes are useful to further chip away at teams that are unprepared, but Forretress struggles to keep stealth rocks up reliably against Tentacruel and Starmie in particular, and Toxic Spikes are useless against much of the tier or even detrimental against Magic Guard Pokemon such as Reuniclus. Toxic is a good catch-all option that hits common switch-ins such as Jellicent, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W. However, it is totally useless vs the numerous Pokemon with either a Steel-typing, Poison-typing, Magic Guard, or Poison Heal. Additionally, many common Pokemon with setup run Lum Berry, such as Dragonite and Volcarona, which wastes a valuable turn to answer them as they set up Hidden Power Fire is an excellent lure for Scizor, while being able to more directly keep hazards off the field that opposing Ferrothorn and other Forretress set up, but otherwise has poor coverage and damage output, compromising Forretress against Pokemon it is meant to check such as Kyurem-B or Excadrill, depending on whether it drops Gyro Ball or Earthquake. Volt Switch provides good momentum, but it does not help versus ground types that regularly want to switch into Forretress such as Landorus-T, and means that Forretress will more often switch out then in, making it a lot more passive. Explosion also enables offensive teams , but many of the common Pokemon in the tier, such as Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-Therian, can shrug it off with relative ease. Counter is also a nice option to stop Dragonite with multiple boosts and can use its bulk to pick off common pokemon like Landorus-Therian and Excadrill, but it otherwise has no utility aside from that, and is useless versus special or mixed attackers as they will target its weaker special defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Jellicent</strong>: Jellicent can wall most variants of Forretress unless they are packing Toxic or Volt Switch, and can block attempts to spin hazards away.</p> <p><strong>Electric-Types</strong>: Rotom-W, Thundurus-T, and Zapdos can easily switch into any move Forretress commonly runs and threaten enormous damage on it. Magnezone carrying an Air Balloon is able to directly switch into and remove Foretress with its Hidden Power Fire and Magnet Pull combination.</p> <p><strong>Fire-Types</strong>: Volcarona can set up in front of Forretress, and threaten to bring it down to sturdy while tanking earthquake in return. Although Heatran cannot switch into Forretress directly, it can threaten to OHKO it with Magma storm that goes through sturdy, and Air Balloon variants can switch into Forretress without any issue.</p> <p><strong>Rapid Spin Users</strong>: Tentacruel is able Scald Foretress, dealing heavy damage and potentially leaving a Burn on it, making it unable to threaten Tentacruel back with Earthquake and limiting it's ability to keep hazards off. Similarly, Starmie is able to deal heavy damage with it's STAB Hydro Pump or Surf which will deal heavy damage to Foretress low Special Defence. As a result, this allows both Starmie and Tentacruel to Rapid Spin the Spikes that Foretress sets up.</p> <p><strong>Special-Attackers</strong>: While many can't switch directly into Forretress, special attackers target Forretress's poor special bulk for consistent 2HKOs. Latios's Surf and even resisted Draco Meteor can do upwards of 50% to Forretress, while Keldeo can switch into everything Forretress commonly runs and threatens to bring it down to Sturdy.</p> <p><strong>Magic Guard</strong>: Reuniclus can switch into Forretress, set up calm mind boosts, and threaten to sweep a team once forretress is gone. Clefable can set Stealth Rock, Paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and Knock its valuable leftovers, which it needs throughout the game to tank hits from most physical attackers.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Over the course of the game, Hazards and contact ability's such as Rough Skin and Iron Barbs can chip Forretress down to put it in range of strong attacks such as Choice Band Mamoswine Earthquake or Excadrill.</p>",

      "Entry Hazard Control": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Forretress sets Spikes and spins entry hazards away, which no other Pokemon can do, and it can do so multiple times per game due to its physical bulk. Gyro Ball is used to land a strong neutral hit against most attackers, notably being able to KO Terrakion and Mamoswine, as well as making Forretress a great check to Kyurem-B and Terrakion, allowing many entry points to set Spikes for Pokemon such as Latios to take advantage of or clear hazards for walls such as Celebi and Blissey. Earthquake allows Forretress to potentially 2HKO Excadrill and Tentacruel, protecting its Spikes against the two most common Rapid Spin users on balance teams. Earthquake also provides good coverage against Heatran and Magnezone without Air Balloon, as well as providing good damage against Jirachi and Tyranitar. However, Hidden Power Ice makes Forretress a great lure to Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and can do good damage to Landorus-T and Swords Dance Gliscor, which prevents them from coming in freely and setting up Stealth Rock, or setting up multiple boosts to overwhelm Forretress.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Defense and HP allow Forretress to stomach strong hits from Choice Band Terrakion, Excadrill, Life Orb Breloom, and Choice Band Kyurem-B. A Relaxed nature is recommended, as it doesn't reduce the damage output of Hidden Power Ice, and also makes Gyro Ball stronger against Latios and Tyranitar. 0 Speed IVs, or 2 IVs if running Hidden Power Ice, are used to maximize Gyro Ball's damage. Sturdy is used to allow Forretress to be a backup check to an out-of-control Dragonite or Volcarona in a pinch. However, Overcoat can prove to be helpful if running Abomasnow or simply if a team wants a better match-up into Abomasnow, as it can freely use its Leftovers recovery to stand strong versus physical attackers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Forretress finds itself right at home on defensive sand teams and hail teams that want to compress a Spiker and a spinner into one slot, so they can run Water-resistant Pokemon like Celebi and Rotom-W, or special walls like Jirachi and Blissey. Blissey is especially nice, as it can use Wish to give Forretress more health to play with, which lets it repeatedly wall Swords Dance Gliscor and Choice Scarf Landorus-T over the course of a game, as well as absorbing status from the likes of Rotom-Wash, Jellicent, and Tentacruel. Tyranitar sets sand, and can Pursuit trap Reuniclus and Alakazam, which can use Forretress as setup fodder or freely KO it with Hidden Power Fire. Jellicent can stop spinners like Tentacruel and Excadrill from removing entry hazards, further pushing the residual damage on the opposing team and allowing Forretress to run Hidden Power Ice to check Landorus-T and Gliscor more effectively. Xatu is also a nice option on these teams, as it can bounce hazards back at Ferrothorn, forming an incredibly reliable anti-hazard core. Chansey and Blissey are fantastic partners for Forretress, as they tank special moves with ease, and check Magnezone and Volcarona, while Forretress checks Terrakion and Kyurem-B for Blissey and Chansey. Gliscor sets Stealth Rock, provides an Earthquake immunity, and can deny hazards with Taunt, or offer a long term win condition with Swords Dance. Reuniclus also pairs well with Forretress, as the Spikes that it puts down can help enable a Reuniclus sweep late-game. Forretress can also fit on certain sun teams that want to compress a Spikes and Rapid Spin user as well as having a solid matchup against strong Rock- and Ground type Pokémon like Landorus-T and Terrakion.</p>"

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Scizor is a great pick for hyper offense teams because of its access to Pursuit, great typing, and strong priority. Scizor can Pursuit trap prominent Psychic-types like Reuniclus, Alakazam, and Latios lacking Hidden Power Fire and revenge kill them with Bullet Punch should they stay in. Scizor's Bullet Punch is one of the strongest priority moves in the tier, allowing it to revenge kill threats like Terrakion, Tyranitar, and Dragonite with some prior damage. It can also OHKO or heavily damage checks like Magnezone, Heatran, Keldeo, and Rotom-W with Superpower. Scizor can run a Choice Scarf set to outspeed and Pursuit trap Alakazam for rain teams. U-turn additionally allows Scizor to form VoltTurn cores with Rotom-W or Landorus-T to repeatedly force damage and gain momentum.</p> <p>However, Scizor suffers from poor longevity due to its vulnerability to entry hazards and Life Orb recoil. This is further compounded by strong attacks like Alakazam and Reuniclus's Focus Blast and Mamowsine's Earthquake 2HKOing it, which is made worse by Scizor's low Speed forcing it into Pursuit mind games against Alakazam and Latios. Scizor struggles a lot with rain teams for these reasons, since they often bring faster Pokemon that can take boosted Bullet Punch, like Keldeo, Thundurus-T, and Starmie, while defensive Politoed and Tentacruel can take its attacks and burn it with Scald. The Choice Scarf set often lacks power, as even Pokemon like Reuniclus are able to stay in on it and scout it with Recover or Protect. Scizor's weakness to Fire also makes it struggle against Heatran and Volcarona and Pokemon it could otherwise handle, like Alakazam, Colbur Berry Latios, and Tyranitar. It also leaves Scizor vulnerable to being trapped by Magnezone if it is faster.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Scizor can run a bulkier Swords Dance set with Roost, Bullet Punch, and a coverage move like U-turn, Bug Bite, Brick Break, or Superpower to set up consistently against Psychic- and Dragon-types. However, the extra bulk still isn't enough to withstand rain-boosted attacks from Pokemon like Keldeo, and various Fire-type coverage moves, and the set can still be overwhelmed by strong Dragon-type attacks from Dragonite, Kyurem-B, and Garchomp. The set also lets Skarmory set up Spikes for free. Scizor can also run a support set with U-turn, Bullet Punch, Roost, and Pursuit, taking advantage of Roost and its natural bulk to keep it alive throughout the game. However, such a set is setup fodder for common Pokemon like Volcarona, Dragonite, and Gliscor and still isn't bulky enough to survive strong attacks from Alakazam, Latios, and Reuniclus continuously if entry hazards are up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran and Volcarona OHKO Scizor, outspeed it, and can set up Stealth Rock or Quiver Dance on it, respectively. However, Heatran is OHKOed by +2 Superpower, while Volcarona doesn't enjoy taking Bullet Punch or Quick Attack after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: If it outspeeds Scizor and manages to switch in safely, Magnezone traps Scizor and OHKOes it with Hidden Power Fire. However, most common Scizor sets are faster and can easily OHKO it with Superpower or pivot out with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazards, Iron Barbs, Rocky Helmet, and Life Orb recoil all significantly hinder Scizor's longevity and put it into 2HKO range of Pokemon like Alakazam, Reuniclus, Kyurem-B, and Latios.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Fire-type coverage from Pokemon it'd normally check, like Alakazam, Latios, Tyranitar, and Garchomp, allows them to lure in and OHKO Scizor. However, most of these Pokemon can be taken out by a boosted Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Thundurus-T, Keldeo, Volcarona, and Starmie outspeed and threaten to OHKO Scizor; some of them also resist Bullet Punch, making it tougher to revenge kill them.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Keldeo, Gastrodon, Jellicent, and Rotom-W can burn Scizor and force it out by easily stomaching its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Very Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Physically bulky Pokemon like Skarmory, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W can take at least one boosted attack from Scizor and significantly weaken it or set up on it; this is even more painful for the Choice Scarf set.</p>",

Pursuit also has the notable benefit of hitting Jellicent super effectively. Superpower provides good neutral coverage against Pokemon like Keldeo, Politoed, and Skarmory and OHKOes Heatran, Magnezone, and Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Quick Attack can also be used over one of the coverage moves, most commonly Superpower, to better threaten faster Pokemon that resist Bullet Punch, like Thundurus-T, Keldeo, and Volcarona. Bug Bite lets Scizor OHKO Reuniclus at +2 and Latios unboosted, and it provides a reliable STAB move to hit Water-types like Rotom-W and Gastrodon. However, dropping Superpower leaves Scizor walled by common Steel-types, while dropping Pursuit causes the same with Jellicent.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Scizor can run a Jolly nature to outspeed all Magnezone lacking Choice Scarf, Jellicent, Adamant Breloom, and defensive Jirachi. However, the lack of power compared to Adamant is generally not worth it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Scizor best fits on weatherless hyper offense teams that need a check to Psychic-types while performing as a sweeper. Pursuit trapping Choice Scarf Latios is especially critical for sweepers such as Dragonite, Garchomp, and Volcarona to function, while breaking Alakazam's Focus Sash and weakening Reuniclus opens up Swords Dance Breloom and Terrakion. Garchomp and Dragonite can wear down and remove checks like Heatran, Keldeo, and Rotom-W so Scizor can sweep with Bullet Punch late-game. Lum Berry Volcarona appreciates Alakazam's Focus Sash being broken so it can't stop it with Thunder Wave and Tyranitar being worn down. Breloom pressures Water-types like Gastrodon and Rotom-W and can work with Scizor to remove faster threats with Mach Punch. Air Balloon Starmie removes entry hazards so Scizor can more easily set up on and take attacks from Pokemon like Latios and Kyurem-B; Scizor also benefits from Starmie wearing down Keldeo. Offensive Spikes users like Custap or Salac Berry Skarmory also fit well alongside Scizor, as entry hazards help put foes in range of a boosted Bullet Punch. Stealth Rock from setters like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Jirachi can chip Pokemon like Volcarona and Skarmory into KO range of Scizor's boosted attacks.</p>"

Pursuit also helps force damage on other frail foes threatened by Scizor's coverage, such as Mamoswine and Dragonite. Having a Pursuit user faster than Alakazam can be incredibly important for removing it; this quality is not replicated by the more common Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Superpower helps Scizor revenge kill Steel-types like Excadrill, Ferrothorn, Magnezone, and Heatran while 2HKOing Keldeo. Another option is Double Hit, which KOes Alakazam through Focus Sash and hits Substitute users, such as Thundurus-T, Keldeo, Tentacruel, and Tornadus. Aerial Ace is able to deal solid damage to Volcarona, but it is mostly useless outside of this matchup.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is run to outspeed Keldeo, Latios, Starmie, and Alakazam.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Scizor primarily fits on rain teams looking to better defend against Alakazam and Latios while also opening up some rain sweepers like Keldeo and Thundurus-T for setup opportunities thanks to U-turn. Politoed sets rain and is more easily able to run a physically defensive set to check Pokemon like Tyranitar and Mamoswine with Scizor removing Alakazam. Tentacruel and specially defensive Excadrill can spin away entry hazards to improve Scizor's longevity. Ferrothorn provides important resistances to Water and Dragon, sets entry hazards, and can Knock Off checks like Heatran. Keldeo appreciates Scizor removing Latios for it so it can more easily wallbreak while covering Heatran for Scizor. Thundurus-T can more easily sweep after setting up an Agility if Latios is taken out and is a strong wallbreaker in its own right. Furthermore, Scizor can also bring Thudurus-T and Keldeo onto the field safely with U-turn.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Scizor can be used alongside other Volt Switch users such as Rotom-W to form a VoltTurn core on sand teams with Hippowdon. Hippowdon can be used more easily thanks to Scizor removing the Psychic-types Tyranitar is usually tasked with handling. While these teams are relatively uncommon, Scizor still enjoys similar support on rain teams: Excadrill for Rapid Spin support, Pokemon like Poison Heal Breloom and Terrakion to take advantage of the removal of Psychic-types, and bulky Pokemon such as Slowking and Skarmory to take the strong hits that Scizor cannot take. Choice Scarf Latios can also act as a backup Choice Scarf user to handle offensive teams and Speed-boosting setup sweepers like Dragonite and Volcarona, while Air Balloon Heatran can assist against Volcarona and has good type synergy with Scizor.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>When it's armed with a Choice Band, Scizor becomes an excellent pivot, scouter, and revenge killer in the metagame thanks to STAB U-turn and Technician Bullet Punch, which hit incredibly hard when backed by its massive Attack stat. Bullet Punch allows Scizor to revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Terrakion, Alakazam, and Latios. It can also revenge kill weakened setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Salamence from higher health thanks to Choice Band. Choice Band-boosted STAB U-turn hits most Bug-neutral Pokemon hard, and its switching property also allows Scizor to scout opposing switches while circumventing Choice Band's drawback. Superpower allows it to target Steel-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill while also hitting Keldeo hard. Pursuit rounds out the set, and thanks to its typing as well as the threat of Bullet Punch and U-turn, it effectively allows Scizor to trap Psychic-type Pokemon such as Alakazam, Latias, and Reuniclus. Quick Attack can be run over Pursuit to allow Scizor to revenge kill faster Steel-resistant Pokemon such as Thundurus-T and Volcarona. However, dropping Pursuit sacrifices Scizor's ability to trap Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed allows Scizor to outspeed everything up to Rotom-W, Jellicent, and Modest Magnezone. Alternatively, Scizor can run a different EV spread of 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD, which can allow Scizor to maximize bulk while also underspeeding Skarmory so that Scizor can hit it with Superpower super effectively upon it using Roost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Scizor fits best on fast-paced teams such as rain, weatherless offense, and sand teams with VoltTurn cores as a way to keep dangerous Psychic-types such as Alakazam, Reuniclus, and Latios and other threats such as Dragonite and Kyurem-B in check. Politoed brings rain and synergizes well with Scizor, as it can switch into Fire-type attacks aimed at Scizor from Pokemon like Heatran and Volcarona. Politoed's rain also lessens Scizor's Fire weakness, which can allow it to tank a Hidden Power Fire in a pinch from Pokemon it's supposed to check such as Latios and Alakazam. Keldeo is one of Scizor's best partners, as Scizor can deal with faster Psychic-types that would otherwise pose a problem to Keldeo. In return, it can benefit from Scizor's U-turn pivoting it in and forcing out the aforementioned Psychic-types in addition to being a very strong offensive Pokemon that can check dangerous Fire-types like Volcarona and Heatran. Thundurus-T similarly enjoys Scizor removing Psychic-types, so it can more freely sweep with Agility or wallbreak with Nasty Plot. Offensive Starmie can clear hazards and answer Heatran and Ground-types like Hippowdon and Landorus-T in addition to being able to check Keldeo for Scizor. Scizor particularly appreciates hazards being cleared, as its frequent use of U-turn will rapidly rack up hazard damage. In return, it can pivot into resisted attacks from the likes of Tyranitar and faster Pokemon like Alakazam and Choice Scarf variants of Latios and Latias for Starmie. Latios similarly can answer Heatran and Ground-types as well as being a Water-resistant teammate. On weatherless offense, Garchomp can provide hazards, which allow Scizor to revenge kill Pokemon like Dragonite and Latios more easily; in return, Scizor can revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Terrakion and Alakazam for Garchomp to sweep later in the game. Magnezone synergizes well with Scizor, since it can bait in Skarmory and Ferrothorn with U-turn so that Magnezone can successfully trap them. Dragonite and Salamence pair well with Scizor, as Scizor can handle Alakazam and Latios, allowing them to sweep more effectively, while they can handle dangerous checks to Scizor such as Volcarona and Keldeo. Kyurem-B also appreciates Scizor removing Latios and Alakazam so that it can wallbreak and revenge kill more easily; in return, Kyurem-B can threaten Ground-types such as Gliscor and Landorus-T and rain teams that would otherwise all give Scizor a hard time. Scizor can also fit on sand teams that have other U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W to form VoltTurn cores. Rotom-W and Scizor can force out each other's checks and chain pivot moves together, allowing them to form a VoltTurn core. Landorus-T can also chain pivot moves with Scizor while also being able to check Garchomp and Excadrill. Scizor can compensate by trapping foes like Latios and Alakazam, which could otherwise be annoying for Landorus-T to deal with. Latios and Latias can excellently check Keldeo and Thundurus-T for Scizor as well as being able to deal with Ground-types such as Gliscor and Garchomp, while Scizor can check foes such as Alakazam and Mamoswine in addition to being able to pivot around Tyranitar for both teammates. Excadrill can clear hazards to improve Scizor's longevity while also being able to check Jirachi for Scizor. Keldeo is also an amazing teammate on sand teams since it can function the same way as Terrakion and benefits from Scizor's presence on such teams.</p>"

  "Skarmory": {
    "overview": "<p>Skarmory is a defensive staple in BW OU, checking many of its best Pokemon and avoiding passivity by setting up entry hazards. It's able to check Ground-types like Excadrill, Mamoswine, Garchomp, and Landorus-T as well as other common Pokemon like Scizor, Breloom, Tyranitar lacking Fire Blast, and Dragonite lacking Fire Punch. Roost and immunity to common residual damage methods like Spikes, sand, and Toxic let it consistently handle them. Normally physically defensive, it can also run a specially defensive EV spread to switch into Pokemon like Alakazam, Latios, and Tornadus while still checking most of the aforementioned threats relatively well. This gives it flexibility in fitting on teams. Setting Spikes, besides reducing its passivity, achieves fantastic progress for teams. Its defensive utility and ability to counter Excadrill, one of the most common spinners, and punish it with Rocky Helmet lets it keep entry hazards up more consistently. These traits alongside Stealth Rock and Sturdy also make it a great Custap Berry lead on hyper offense teams. Spikes also wears down Skarmory's common switch-ins, like Heatran, Jellicent, and Politoed, especially with Whirlwind. However, Skarmory's Fire and Electric weaknesses let common Pokemon, like Heatran and Thundurus-T, and specialized coverage, like Fire Blast on Tyranitar and Garchomp, get past it. Strong special attackers like Keldeo, Alakazam, and Latios can overwhelm physically defensive sets, as can common rain threats, with Tentacruel and Starmie successfully spinning on burned Skarmory. Magnezone, often paired with the Dragon-types Skarmory checks like Garchomp and Dragonite lacking Fire Punch, can trap and remove Skarmory. Skarmory also cannot punish Pokemon immune to Spikes, like Reuniclus, Rotom-W, and Xatu, which can hit it super effectively, set up on it, punish Spikes and Whirlwind with Magic Bounce, or inflict it with status. Ferrothorn competes with it on sand teams as a Steel-types Spikes setter, resisting Water and having better special bulk to stave off rain teams. Skarmory also competes with other Steel-types like Heatran and Jirachi given their better offensive presence and prowess in checking Psychic-types, respectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stealth Rock can be run on the defensive set should no other Pokemon be able to fit the move. However, this is a rare problem. Toxic can cripple certain switch-ins, like Thundurus-T, Keldeo, Volcarona, and Politoed lacking Refresh, especially in tandem with sand and entry hazards. However, it fails to bother many other switch-ins, and the moveslot is usually better spent on Brave Bird or Taunt. Drill Peck can threaten Fighting-types like Brave Bird without recoil and with better PP for longer games. However, it's too weak to really threaten Pokemon like Latios, Starmie, and Volcarona. Counter lets Skarmory take advantage of its physical bulk to get a surprise KO, especially against boosted Pokemon on offensive teams, like Dragonite and Scizor. However, Counter is worse in a majority of other matchups, mainly sand and rain. A faster defensive Taunt set can shut down standard opposing Skarmory and faster Tyranitar, Breloom, and Jellicent, which would cripple or set up on Skarmory. However, the loss in bulk makes Skarmory a noticeably less reliable wall. Secret Power can be run over Brave Bird on the defensive set to punish Pokemon that try to exploit Skarmory's passivity, like Heatran, Alakazam, Xatu, and Tentacruel, with paralysis. Thief can be run with no item to steal Leftovers from common switch-ins like Politoed, Rotom-W, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn, leaving them worn down more quickly, while also giving Skarmory a way to punish Taunt from Jellicent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran and Volcarona threaten to OHKO Skarmory and are free to use Stealth Rock or Quiver Dance. However, they are worn down quickly by entry hazards and other residual damage sources.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Magnezone traps Skarmory and OHKOes it with Thunderbolt. However, Shed Shell can circumvent it. Other Electric-types like Thundurus-T and Rotom-W threaten to KO Skarmory and use it to set up or gain momentum with Volt Switch, respectively. They're are also immune to Spikes, making shuffling from Whirlwind throughout the game less important if Stealth Rock isn't up.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon like Reuniclus, Alakazam, Keldeo, and Latios can break through Skarmory with the appropriate coverage due to its mediocre special bulk. A specially defensive set can handle them more easily, but they still hurt it quite a lot.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burns from Pokemon like Politoed, Tentacruel, and Jellicent wear Skarmory down quickly and force it to use Roost much more often, denying it opportunities to set Spikes. Paralysis can get Skarmory KOed if bad luck makes full paralysis activate as it tries to use Roost.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users like Gliscor, Jellicent, and opposing faster Skarmory leave Skarmory unable to do anything, making it difficult to set up Spikes consistently.</p> <p><strong>Anti-Entry Hazard Pokemon</strong>: A lot of the progress Skarmory makes is through entry hazard damage, so anti-hazard Pokemon like Tentacruel, Xatu, and Excadrill—if Skarmory is lacking Rocky Helmet—prevent and undo progress.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes wears down switch-ins like Tyranitar, Keldeo, and Heatran while also supporting Skarmory's hard-hitting teammates and giving Whirlwind offensive potential. Whirlwind stops setup sweepers like Scizor, Dragonite, and Landorus-T while also punishing switches by forcing entry hazard damage. Brave Bird makes Skarmory not complete Taunt fodder, hits Fighting-types like Breloom, and breaks Alakazam's Focus Sash. Taunt prevents Pokemon like Gastrodon, Ferrothorn, and Gliscor from healing or setting up entry hazards and beats other Skarmory if the Speed tie is won.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A specially defensive spread with 252 Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature is preferred to better check Pokemon like Latios, Alakazam, Tornadus, Fire Blast Tyranitar, and Reuniclus lacking Thunder. This spread still answers most physical attackers relatively well, though it requires more care. However, Defense investment can be used instead to make Skarmory as sturdy as possible against Ground- and Dragon-types like Excadrill, Mamoswine, Landorus-T, Garchomp and Dragonite lacking Fire Punch, in addition to Tyranitar lacking Fire Blast and Jirachi lacking Thunder. Leftovers is preferred to reduce Skarmory's reliance on Roost to remain healthy, especially with Stealth Rock up. Rocky Helmet instead punishes common contact moves, mainly U-turn, Crunch, and Outrage, and makes Excadrill unable to keep Skarmory's Spikes off the field long-term. However, it makes Skarmory more reliant on frequent Roosts and easier to get in 2HKO range of strong attackers. Shed Shell is also an option to switch out of Magnezone, making teams that rely on Skarmory getting trapped, primarily DragMag teams, struggle greatly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits best on sand teams, which appreciate it blanket checking so many strong attackers, and Spikes and sand have great synergy in wearing down the opposing team. Tyranitar sets sand and can set up Stealth Rock with a Chople Berry set that also Pursuit traps Reuniclus, Latios, and Jellicent, which can set up on, force out, and cripple Skarmory. This Tyranitar set also breaks Alakazam's Focus Sash with Pursuit and beats Alakazam if it misses Focus Blast. Tyranitar can also check Heatran and Volcarona if running Tanga Berry, and both sets appreciate Skarmory setting Spikes and beating Ground-types like Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T. Psychic-types like Alakazam, Latios, and Reuniclus work well with each other and love Spikes wearing down foes and Skarmory switching into Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn. Focus Sash Alakazam can revenge kill any Pokemon and punish Pokemon that try to set up on Skarmory, mainly Reuniclus and Volcarona, with Encore and Thunder Wave. Latios switches into Fire-, Water-, and Electric-types like Heatran, Keldeo, and Thundurus-T while bringing sweeping potential with a Choice Scarf set, which revenge kills and cripples Pokemon like Reuniclus and Volcarona. Once foes are worn down, in part from Skarmory's Spikes and possibly Rocky Helmet, Reuniclus can sweep with Calm Mind late-game. Ground-types like Gliscor, Gastrodon, and Excadrill can switch into Electric-type moves. Gliscor can provide Stealth Rock and Knock Off to wear down Pokemon even more quickly in tandem with Skarmory's Spikes. It also better checks Terrakion with its Fighting resistance, better switches into Fire Blast Tyranitar, and gives Skarmory general defensive backup. Gastrodon, on the other hand, checks Fire-, Electric-, and Water-types like Heatran, Thundurus-T, and Rotom-W while spreading Toxic to rack up even more passive damage with Spikes. Gliscor and Gastrodon can succeed together with Skarmory, as the trio's defensive synergy lets it check and easily wear down most of the metagame. Excadrill pressures Reuniclus and checks Electric- and Dragon-types while appreciating Skarmory countering bulky Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor. Jellicent can take on Fire- and Water-types like Volcarona, Politoed, and Keldeo, spread more residual damage with Will-O-Wisp, and stop recovery with Taunt, letting Skarmory's Spikes damage really stick. Skarmory answers common Ground- and Grass-types in return. Offensive Heatran sets Stealth Rock and enjoys Spikes support and a more dedicated defensive Steel-type.</p>"

      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Skarmory can nearly always set Stealth Rock or Spikes, oftentimes both, thanks to Sturdy and Custap Berry providing it insurance. Brave Bird chips a target so one of its partners can break through it later. It also stops Rapid Spin attempts if the recoil KOes Skarmory first, which is guaranteed if Sturdy activates beforehand. Taunt prevents slower leads from setting entry hazards and setting up, giving this set's offensive teammates more room to set up and sweep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An offensive spread is chosen to get into Custap Berry range more efficiently and empower Brave Bird, which helps Skarmory more easily self-KO.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits on very offensive teams that need both Stealth Rock and Spikes up from the start of the game. Jellicent can spinblock and use Will-O-Wisp alongside Spikes to quickly wear down its switch-ins. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can work with Jellicent to keep Skarmory's Spikes up against Starmie hyper offense teams while keeping hyper offense threats under control before they get a Speed boost. Swords Dance Terrakion and Garchomp can more easily sweep with Spikes wearing down very bulky Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Slowbro, and they can check Volcarona and Thundurus-T. Volcarona can more easily KO Tyranitar with Spikes putting it into range of +1 Bug Buzz. Swords Dance Scizor brings a strong priority revenge killer, sets up on the Choice-locked Dragon- and Ice-type moves that bother hyper offense, and benefits greatly from Spikes wearing switch-ins like Politoed and Volcarona. Offensive Starmie can use Rapid Spin if Skarmory fails to stop Stealth Rock with Taunt while outspeeding and threatening faster Pokemon like Latios, Garchomp, and Keldeo. Spikes also helps it wear down and take out Ferrothorn.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>While Kingdra has a theoretical niche as a decent revenge killer against rain teams, it's ultimately far too inconsistent in the current metagame. Kingdra's reliance on manual rain makes it very gimmicky against non-rain teams, and it can even struggle against rain teams because it can't reliably break through Ferrothorn and hates status from other rain staples like Politoed and Tentacruel. Keldeo and Starmie are better choices, since the former has Secret Sword to break past special walls like Chansey and Ferrothorn, while Starmie has better natural Speed and Electric-type coverage for Politoed and Tentacruel, as well as Analytic to punish switch-ins. They also don't require rain to be a threat, and they are much less one-dimensional than Kingdra thanks to their better overall movepools and matchups against non-rain teams.</p>",

While Donphan may have access to a workable support movepool, solid Attack and Defense stats, and the ability to switch into common Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Garchomp, these traits aren't enough for it to establish a niche. Excadrill far outclasses it as a spinner with its additional Steel typing and an ability to better pressure crucial Pokemon such as Jellicent and Reuniclus. It even struggles to find a place on modern sun teams, as most players instead use Xatu for its Magic Bounce and ability to preserve momentum with U-turn.</p>", "sets": {"Support": {}}, "credits": {"writtenBy": [{"user_id": 515642, "username": "Gamer1234556"}], "teams": [{"name": "Grammar checked by", "members": [{"user_id": 336073, "username": "Rabia"}]}]}},
  "Blissey": {"overview": "<p>Between its bad defensive typing and its vulnerability to residual damage and strong physical attackers, Blissey has a hard time answering that much of the metagame. In contrast to other defensive Pokemon, such as Ferrothorn, Celebi, and Jirachi, Blissey cannot check common threats such as Tyranitar, Mamoswine, Keldeo, Breloom, and Dragonite. While its ability to wield Leftovers, which its pre-evolution Chansey cannot do, may sound appealing, Blissey has a worse matchup against every threat in the tier. Stall teams also struggle to make a splash in the metagame, making it harder to fit Blissey on a viable team. For these reasons, Blissey is ultimately unviable and should not be considered on any serious team.</p>", "sets": {"Support": {}}, "credits": {"writtenBy": [{"user_id": 515642, "username": "Gamer1234556"}], "teams": [{"name": "Grammar checked by", "members": [{"user_id": 277988, "username": "dex"}]}]}},
  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Tyranitar is one of the most definitive Pokemon in BW OU thanks to it setting sand and keeping dangerous Psychic-types like Latios, Reuniclus, and Alakazam in check by Pursuit trapping them. Sand is a key component of the metagame, since it keeps rain off the field, limiting dangerous Pokemon on rain teams like Thundurus-T and Tentacruel, and works very well alongside other means of residual damage, like entry hazards and status. Sand damage puts Pokemon like Keldeo, Latios, Rotom-W, and Starmie on a timer and negates Leftovers recovery for many others. Outside of Psychic-types, Tyranitar also checks common threats like Thundurus-T, Heatran, Jellicent, and Volcarona if running Tanga Berry, and it can revenge kill and Pursuit trap faster threats with a Choice Scarf set. Tyranitar can even run lure options for checks like Skarmory, Excadrill, and Gliscor thanks to its deep movepool. However, Tyranitar is quite vulnerable to being worn down by the Pokemon it should check, given its lack of recovery and vulnerability to entry hazards. Most noticeably, opposing sand teams can use multiple Psychic-types to overwhelm Tyranitar in tandem with entry hazards. It also has common weaknesses that leave it forced out by Pokemon like Keldeo, Excadrill, Terrakion, and Scizor and 2HKOed by Focus Blast Reuniclus and Alakazam, which Tyranitar would otherwise Pursuit trap without much issue. It's also slow, making its Choice Scarf set fail to revenge kill any boosted threats or outspeed and beat Alakazam.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Slide and Stone Edge can be used on the Chople Berry set nail Volcarona and Thundurus-T, which can normally take one hit and set up on and KO Tyranitar. Choice Band Tyranitar is extremely strong, breaking through Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Gliscor much more easily while pressuring Reuniclus a lot more with Pursuit. However, it gets worn down quickly, is slow, can be exploited after locking into a move, and doesn't have the defensive utility of the defensive Pursuit set, leaving it beaten by Pokemon like Alakazam. Custap Berry can be run on the bulky Pursuit set to give Tyranitar a free turn, letting it surprise and remove Pokemon like Excadrill and Terrakion with Superpower or set up Stealth Rock as it goes down. Custap Berry can be run with Endure and Thunder Wave to get off a priority Thunder Wave in an emergency. This is especially useful to more reliably slow down Volcarona against hyper offense teams. Taunt can be run on the defensive set with a fast EV spread on Spikes-based teams, since Tyranitar can block opposing entry hazards while also preventing Pokemon like Gastrodon from recovering, making the team's Spikes more effective. Leftovers grants Tyranitar more longevity, and it's especially helpful in the weather war because Politoed can't recover health in sand, so it usually will get taken out first. Plus, it lets Tyranitar better check Latios, Heatran, and Tentacruel. However, this set still loses to Focus Blast Psychic-types or Volcarona. A Dragon Dance or Rock Polish set can be used to try and sweep thanks to Tyranitar's solid coverage and high attacking stats. However, Tyranitar's defensive utility is usually too important to give up, and these sets will usually end up revenge killed by Alakazam as well as common Choice Scarf users like Keldeo, Garchomp, and Latios, which outspeed even +2 Tyranitar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Keldeo, Breloom, and Terrakion can all take at least one hit from Tyranitar and OHKO it. They can also punish Tyranitar switching out by spreading Toxic in Keldeo's case and setting up Swords Dance in Breloom and Terrakion's case. However, they dislike Thunder Wave, and Breloom and Terrakion must be careful of Fire Blast and Superpower, respectively, when switching in.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Rotom-W, Politoed, Tentacruel, and Keldeo can all threaten Tyranitar with their STAB moves, inflict status on it, or change the weather in Politoed's case. However, these Pokemon lack reliable recovery, making them easy to wear down in sand.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Gliscor, Garchomp, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Excadrill can all take Tyranitar's hits, outspeed it, force it out, and use it to set up Stealth Rock or Swords Dance. However, the first three get destroyed by Ice Beam, on the switch from the support set or one-on-one from the Choice Scarf set, while Excadrill is OHKOed by Superpower and heavily damaged by Earthquake and Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Common residual damage sources like entry hazards and status easily wear Tyranitar down because it lacks recovery, making it easy for the Pokemon it should answer, primarily Psychic-types like Alakazam, Reuniclus, and Latios, to break through it.</p>",

      "Bulky Pursuit Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Pursuit traps Pokemon like Reuniclus, Jellicent, Latios, and Alakazam, with Crunch giving Tyranitar a reliable STAB option to break through the former three should they stay in. Due to heavy Special Defense investment, running both together also lets Tyranitar convincingly trap Tentacruel and weakened specially defensive Politoed under sand. Thunder Wave cripples offensive switch-ins like Keldeo and Rotom-W and makes Alakazam more consistently trappable, which is important since Alakazam 2HKOes Tyranitar with Focus Blast and survives any hit thanks to Focus Sash. Tyranitar can instead compress Stealth Rock for sand teams that can't fit it anywhere else. However, Tyranitar struggles to reliably keep Stealth Rock up against Excadrill, and it often takes damage while setting Stealth Rock, which compromises its Pursuit trapping mid- and late-game. Alternatively, Fire Blast hits Skarmory, Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Breloom hard, preventing them from freely switching in and setting up entry hazards or Swords Dance. Superpower hits Ferrothorn, Mamoswine, and Heatran while also OHKOing offensive Excadrill and having good odds to OHKO Terrakion. Earthquake hits Jirachi harder than Fire Blast, maintains a hard hit on Excadrill and Terrakion, and lets Tyranitar more reliably beat Heatran and Tentacruel, even when burnt. Ice Beam can be run over Thunder Wave to surprise Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Dragonite on the switch and maintain coverage for Breloom.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>88 Attack EVs and an Adamant or Brave nature makes Crunch 2HKO Reuniclus, letting Tyranitar handle it much more reliably. However, a spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD and a Careful or Sassy nature can be run instead if Reuniclus is well-covered elsewhere, and this helps Tyranitar take on Pokemon like Latios, Tornadus, and Thundurus-T. Chople Berry makes Tyranitar a one-time switch-in to Alakazam, Reuniclus, Tornadus, and Thundurus-T. However, teams that already cover these threats defensively can utilize Tanga Berry Tyranitar to take out Volcarona, which would otherwise take a hit from full health and KO Tyranitar after a boost with Bug Buzz. Brave and Sassy natures, depending on the EV spread, should be used if running Fire Blast or Ice Beam to not reduce their power. A faster spread can be run to outspeed Pokemon like Skarmory and Breloom so Tyranitar can hit them with Fire Blast before they use Roost and Drain Punch, respectively. However, this makes Tyranitar loses out on a lot of bulk and struggle to check Pokemon like Latios and Heatran.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is better used with partners that need Tyranitar to have better longevity to cut off rain more often, more reliably Pursuit trap Reuniclus, and not get taken advantage of by setup sweepers. Psychic-types like Alakazam, Latios, and Reuniclus work well with Tyranitar and each other. Focus Sash Alakazam provides a revenge killer for any Pokemon that try to set up on Tyranitar, mainly Volcarona and Garchomp, or punishes them with Thunder Wave or Encore. Latios switches into Fire-, Water-, and Electric-types like Heatran, Keldeo, and Thundurus-T while bringing sweeping potential with a Choice Scarf set, which revenge kills and cripples Pokemon sand teams would otherwise struggle against, like Volcarona. Reuniclus appreciates its switch-ins being worn down to sweep with Calm Mind late-game or threaten opposing sand and rain teams with its Life Orb three attacks set. Ferrothorn and Skarmory add to Tyranitar's residual damage with Spikes and also appreciate its longevity, which helps it remove rain, Pursuit trap Psychic-types they can't threaten, and check Fire-types like Heatran. Skarmory checks physical attackers like Dragonite and Scizor and Ground-types like Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Mamoswine in return. Specially defensive Skarmory can also act as a secondary switch-in into Alakazam to stop it and its Psychic-type partners from overwhelming Tyranitar. Ferrothorn, on the other hand, switches into Dragon-types like Latios and Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Superpower, as well as Water-types like Starmie and Politoed. It can also use Knock Off to remove Leftovers from sand-vulnerable Pokemon like Rotom-W. Ground-types like Gliscor, Landorus-T, Gastrodon, and Excadrill can switch into Electric-type moves. Gliscor also brings Knock Off, can set Stealth Rock for Tyranitar, and checks Fighting- and Ground-types like Terrakion and Excadrill. It also helps Tyranitar get on the field to Pursuit trap with U-turn. Landorus-T checks similar threats to Gliscor and sets Stealth Rock, bringing Intimidate but lacking Gliscor's Knock Off to amplify sand damage. Gastrodon checks Electric- and Water-types like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Keldeo and acts as a more long-term Heatran answer. It also spreads Toxic to rack up even more passive damage in sand and appreciates Tyranitar Pursuit trapping Reuniclus, which takes advantage of it. Gliscor, Gastrodon, and Tyranitar's combined defensive synergy lets them check and easily wear down most of the metagame. Excadrill pressures Reuniclus so Tyranitar can more comfortably run maximum Special Defense investment and checks Electric- and Dragon-types. It also keeps entry hazards off the field. Fighting-types like Keldeo, Terrakion, and Breloom all appreciate Psychic-types and Jellicent being Pursuit trapped, with Keldeo checking hyper offense threats like Volcarona and Scizor, Terrakion gaining a Special Defense boost in sand to more easily set up Swords Dance, and Poison Heal Breloom checking Water-types like Tentacruel and Rotom-W while feeling freer to run Facade and hit its checks harder. Jellicent can take on Water- and Fighting-types like Keldeo, Politoed, and Terrakion while spreading more residual damage with Will-O-Wisp and stopping recovery with Taunt, letting the damage stick. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock, check Grass- and Dragon-types like Celebi and Kyurem-B, and better pressure checks like Rotom-W and Latios with status or Magma Storm while in sand. Rotom-W checks Water- and Ground-types like Starmie, Keldeo, and Mamoswine and spreads Will-O-Wisp. It also pivots Tyranitar in safely against Reuniclus and Latios thanks to Volt Switch, which breaks Alakazam's Focus Sash so Tyranitar KOes it with Pursuit.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam hits Gliscor and Landorus-T hard while also letting Tyranitar revenge kill Dragonite, Garchomp, and Salamence lacking Yache Berry. Superpower hits Pokemon like Heatran, Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Terrakion hard while also acting as a good midground option to hit switch-ins like Keldeo thanks to its good neutral coverage. Stone Edge can be run over Ice Beam to OHKO Volcarona and Thundurus-T, which could otherwise take a hit and set up on and KO Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>48 Special Defense EVs make Tyranitar survive Latios's Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes, while 48 Special Attack EVs make Ice Beam OHKO maximum HP Lax Landorus-T and physically defensive Gliscor. Maximum Speed and a positive nature are important to properly revenge kill Starmie.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits on bulkier teams that have Alakazam and Reuniclus well-covered but need a revenge killer in addition to sand. Pokemon like Breloom, Calm Mind Reuniclus, and Protect variants of Keldeo enjoy Latios being more reliably removed, which helps them set up and function. Ferrothorn and Skarmory can set up Spikes to accompany sand's residual damage and appreciate Tyranitar keeping revenge killers that could overwhelm them under control. Specially defensive Skarmory is best with this set, since it can keep Alakazam under control and decently check physical attackers like Dragonite lacking Fire Punch, Scizor, and Ground-types like Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Mamoswine. Ferrothorn, on the other hand, switches into Dragon-types like Latios and Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Superpower, as well as Water-types like Starmie and Politoed. It can also bring Stealth Rock and Knock Off support to complement Tyranitar's sand damage. Ground-types like Gliscor, Landorus-T, Gastrodon, and Excadrill can switch into Electric-type moves. Gliscor can provide both Stealth Rock and Knock Off to augment Tyranitar's sand damage and check Fighting- and Ground-types like Terrakion and Excadrill. It also helps Tyranitar enter the field to Pursuit trap and revenge kill with U-turn. Landorus-T checks similar threats to Gliscor and also sets up Stealth Rock, bringing Intimidate but lacking Knock Off to augment sand. Gastrodon checks Electric- and Water-types like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Keldeo and acts as a more long-term Heatran answer. It also spreads Toxic to rack up even more passive damage with sand and appreciates Tyranitar Pursuit trapping Latios, which pressures it with Trick. Excadrill pressures Reuniclus and checks Electric- and Dragon-types while also keeping entry hazards off the field. Rotom-W checks Water- and Ground-types like Starmie, Keldeo, and Mamoswine while bringing more residual damage with Will-O-Wisp and getting Tyranitar in safely against threats like Latios with Volt Switch. Other pivots like Landorus-T also help Tyranitar more safely trap Choice Scarf Latios, especially if entry hazards are up.</p>"

  "Celebi": {
    "overview": "<p>Celebi's main niche in BW OU is as a bulky pivot due to its good resistances, bulk, and utility movepool. Celebi is especially effective against rain teams, as it walls Keldeo unless it runs the otherwise inferior Hidden Power Bug while also being able to shrug off attacks from Latios and Thundurus-T. Celebi is also unique in that it doesn't mind Scald burns due to Natural Cure, letting it take strong hits, heal, and U-turn out to gain momentum. Additionally, Celebi is probably the best Breloom answer in the game, as it takes even Swords Dance-boosted attacks well. Celebi also helps shore up teams against Alakazam and Reuniclus lacking Signal Beam, as it is able to safely pivot in a Pursuit user like Tyranitar with U-turn. Celebi has a huge support movepool and can run options such as Nasty Plot, Thunder Wave, Worry Seed, Stealth Rock, and Perish Song. However, Celebi is uncommon because of several crippling flaws, primarily its propensity to getting forced out by common Pokemon like Volcarona and Heatran, weakness to common moves like U-turn and Ice Beam, susceptibility to being worn down by Spikes, and vulnerability to Pursuit. Although Celebi walls most Pokemon on rain teams, Ferrothorn walls it and can use it to set up entry hazards while pressuring it with Knock Off. This issue, in tandem with its vulnerability to entry hazards, necessitates Rapid Spin support, making the team structures Celebi fits on quite limited. Being a Stealth Rock user so weak to Volcarona is also a huge vulnerability, as it can come in easily and start setting up without having to take Stealth Rock damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Celebi has access to Swords Dance to set up on the common Pokemon it walls. However, it can struggle to find setup opportunities, and most teams can easily handle it. Celebi has many utility moves that potentially have use, such as Worry Seed or Sucker Punch to break Alakazam's Focus Sash, Perish Song to force out Calm Mind Reuniclus, or Healing Wish to fully heal Tyranitar after it has been worn down. However, giving up the coverage of Hidden Power Ice, the status of Thunder Wave, or the superior role compression and utility of Stealth Rock means Celebi is even greater setup bait.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran, and especially Volcarona, are extremely dangerous to Celebi, since they can easily KO it with their Fire-type STAB moves. Heatran can take advantage of Celebi to set up Stealth Rock or Substitute, while Volcarona can use it as setup fodder with Quiver Dance.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Celebi is very vulnerable to entry hazards and easily allows Skarmory and Ferrothorn to set them up. This severely limits Celebi's longevity and limits when it can switch in and wall threats.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar can force Pursuit mindgames while doing a lot of damage with Crunch should Celebi decide to stay in.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Celebi is completely walled by a myriad of Steel-types. Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Jirachi set up entry hazards freely in front of it. Scizor is particularly dangerous, since Choice Scarf variants can outspeed and OHKO Celebi with U-turn and Swords Dance sets can use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Without Hidden Power Ice, Celebi is setup fodder for Garchomp, Dragonite, and Salamence. Kyurem-B doesn't care about any of Celebi's offensive options, while Latios deals a ton of damage with Draco Meteor and doesn't take much damage from Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Pokemon Celebi should answer, such as Keldeo and Alakazam, can run Bug-type coverage to lure in and KO it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic allows Celebi to threaten Fighting- and Poison-types like Keldeo, Terrakion, and Tentacruel for solid damage. Baton Pass allows Celebi to utilize its bulk to scout switches and bring in teammates safely; it is used over U-turn so that Celebi cannot get trapped by Tyranitar's Pursuit. Giga Drain and Grass Knot allow Celebi to threaten Ground- and Water-types like Mamoswine, Politoed, and Jellicent; Giga Drain provides Celebi with additional recovery, while Grass Knot deals more damage to Tyranitar. If Celebi uses Substitute, it can use Baton Pass to bring in threatening teammates in safely while giving them a Substitute to protect them from status and powerful attacks. Celebi can also use the opportunities it gets against Water-types to set up Stealth Rock, though it tends to invite in dangerous sweepers like Dragonite and Volcarona, which are the Pokemon you want Stealth Rock for the most. Celebi can instead use Thunder Wave to slow down them and other setup sweepers like Reuniclus and Scizor. An interesting option is Perish Song; while Celebi can tank Reuniclus's attacks fairly handily, it doesn't threaten Reuniclus in return, so Reuniclus will just set up Calm Mind on it. Perish Song will force out Reuniclus in a way unlike any other move Celebi can learn, though it should not be used in conjunction with Baton Pass, as Celebi would be KOing its own teammate if it is used with one turn left on the Perish Song timer. This can also be used as a last ditch against other sweepers like Volcarona and Dragonite, though their immediate power compared to Reuniclus allows them to reliably get a KO before being forced to switch out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>16 Speed EVs allow Celebi to outspeed Adamant Breloom. The rest of the EVs maximize its special bulk, allowing it to check powerful foes like Keldeo and Thundurus-T. Maximizing its HP is additionally beneficial if using Substitute, as it produces 101 HP Substitutes that do not get broken by Clefable's and Blissey's Seismic Toss and Jellicent's Night Shade.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Celebi is mostly seen on sand teams, which appreciate its ability to check dangerous attackers in rain, especially Keldeo and Thundurus-T. It resists Keldeo's STAB combination and can escape Pursuit from Keldeo's teammate, Tyranitar, with Baton Pass, making it one of the best Keldeo checks in the game. What's more, Thundurus-T's Hidden Power Ice only 3HKOes it, so it can pivot into Thundurus-T and bring in a teammate that would rather switch into Hidden Power Ice such as Tyranitar. Its special bulk is so immense that it can even swallow two unboosted Draco Meteors from Latios, though Celebi should not be considered a Latios check. Celebi's ability to take on Water-types like the aforementioned Keldeo, Rotom-W, Politoed, and Jellicent benefits Ground-types that dislike facing them, including Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Mamoswine. In return, these Pokemon threaten Steel-types and Tyranitar that Celebi can struggle against. Celebi can be worn down by entry hazards and particularly Spikes, so a spinner is a great teammate for it; Excadrill is the best teammate for this purpose and is a Ground-type that appreciates Celebi as mentioned before. Wallbreakers like Terrakion appreciate Celebi's ability to bring them in safely, especially if they receive a Substitute, and sponge hits from Pokemon that could revenge kill them. In return, Terrakion can check Volcarona, which sets up on Celebi. Alternative Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T and Heatran can free up Celebi to use Substitute and Thunder Wave instead of requiring that it be the main Stealth Rock setter of its team. Because Celebi dislikes U-turn from the likes of Landorus-T and Scizor, a teammate that can handle them, like your own Landorus-T, is appreciated. Pokemon that threaten Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Skarmory alleviate Celebi's weak matchup into them; the aforementioned Terrakion, Keldeo, Heatran, Magnezone, and Swords Dance Sand Force Excadrill can break through them. Grass Knot Celebi is great at damaging Tyranitar for the benefit of other Pokemon that get checked by it, namely Alakazam and Latios.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Celebi can exploit its defensive strengths by using the much-desired Nasty Plot. By doubling its Special Attack, Celebi quickly transforms from a special wall into an offensive threat that is not as afraid of status or stray damage because of its Natural Cure ability and access to Recover, allowing it to often boost multiple times per match. Leaf Storm might seem counterintuitive at first sight, since it wipes Celebi's Nasty Plot boosts, but the extra damage allows for crucial OHKOs. After a boost, it will KO staples such as Landorus-T and Excadrill without entry hazards while having the capacity to OHKO Garchomp and Tyranitar after Stealth Rock. Giga Drain is a good alternative Grass-type STAB move depending on the team's gameplan. The bonus recovery, higher PP, perfect accuracy, and lack of a drawback makes it much better when Celebi's team is less offensive, although the drop in power results in it struggling to outpace Reuniclus's Calm Mind boosts with its own Nasty Plot and KO it. Hidden Power Fire is crucial for taking down Steel-types such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Forretress. Without it, these Pokemon can easily wall Celebi, shrugging off any hits and either setting hazards or boosting themselves. If Celebi is supported by Magnezone to remove Steel-types, Hidden Power Ice fends off Dragon- and Flying-types that could set up on it, primarily Dragonite, Latios, and Thundurus-T, while also being able to beat Landorus-T without a Nasty Plot. Recover gives Celebi the option to heal itself, letting it switch in with much more freedom against common threats like Keldeo and Latios while also allowing it to potentially use Nasty Plot multiple times per match. The aforementioned combination of Nasty Plot and Recover is what gives this set its specific niche, hence those being the only two moves set in stone.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Considering Hidden Power Fire requires Celebi to run imperfect Speed IVs, an investment of 188 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allows it to hit the much-desired 310 Speed benchmark, a common Speed tier for Pokemon aiming to outspeed Landorus-T. Celebi's HP stat is maximized, and the rest is put in Special Defense in order to help it check common special attackers like Keldeo, Latios, and Thundurus-T as consistently as possible. An alternative investment of 112 Speed and 144 Special Defense EVs and a Calm nature grants Celebi even more bulk while allowing it to still outrun neutral-natured base 80s, such as Mamoswine, as well as lead Skarmory in order to 2HKO it with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Nasty Plot Celebi finds its natural home on sand structures thanks to the synergy it has with common sand teammates. Naturally, Tyranitar is the first to consider, eliminating the threatening rain and helping cover the big Volcarona gap left by Celebi's typing. As mentioned earlier, Magnezone is a great partner; by trapping and removing Steel-types, Celebi is able to use the more offensive Hidden Power Ice. Eliminating the entry hazard setters from the game also eases the burden of Celebi switching in, as Spikes are very detrimental to its gameplan, forcing it to use Recover in more situations. Celebi will ideally be paired with a Rapid Spin user, most commonly Excadrill, which also works best on a sand team thanks to its Sand Force ability as well as its versatility to fulfill multiple roles. Finally, another option worth mentioning would be Heatran; while not as common, its typing fits perfectly with Celebi's to provide wonderful defensive synergy, as what one falters to the other excels against.</p>"

  "Breloom": {
    "overview": "<p>Because of its offensive stats, coverage, and two fantastic abilities, Breloom keeps its title as one of the most powerful threats in BW OU, even if it can't use Spore anymore. While Technician turns Breloom into one of the most fearsome threats to balance teams, Breloom really shines with its Poison Heal sets, which let it counter all bulky Water-types by blocking status. However, Breloom has pitiful HP and Special Defense, mediocre base Speed, and the inability to fit all of the moves it wants on most of its sets.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stun Spore and Toxic can be used over Protect on Poison Heal sets or as the last move of the Choice Band set to spread status, but the shaky accuracy of Stun Spore and the lack of targets for Toxic make both mediocre options. Worry Seed can be used to defeat poisoned Gliscor and Reuniclus and to remove Amoonguss's Regenerator, but it doesn't have any other important targets. Other sets can be used if your team can afford a more customized Breloom: maximum Attack Superpower on a Poison Heal set gives Breloom greater offensive power alongside a surprise factor, but reduces Breloom's defensive utility versus Water-type Pokemon. A more defensive approach with Leech Seed and Protect or Substitute is also possible, but makes Breloom very passive versus Amoonguss, Celebi, and Reuniclus. A Choice Scarf set can be used to grab surprise KOs against faster foes, especially Alakazam because of Bullet Seed, but the lack of Spore also makes this a very fringe option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Amoonguss</strong>: Amoonguss doesn't fear any STAB attacks from Breloom, can heal any damage it deals with Regenerator, and can heavily damage it back with Sludge Bomb. However, Amoonguss must watch out for Facade and Choice Band Stone Edge because it is slower than Breloom.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Reuniclus has enough bulk to take any hit from Breloom and threaten to KO it with Psychic. Celebi can take any move used by Breloom, heal with Recover, and threaten to KO Breloom with Psychic, set Stealth Rock, or get momentum with U-turn. Cresselia can shrug off Breloom's attacks with Reflect + Moonlight, deal decent damage with Psychic or Ice Beam, or steal Poison Heal with Skill Swap. Latios and Latias take little from Breloom's STAB moves, and Latios threatens to OHKO it back with Draco Meteor. Alakazam can't switch in directly, but it also threatens an immediate OHKO with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Defensive Flying-types like Skarmory, Gliscor, and Landorus-T take little damage from Breloom's STAB moves and can threaten to OHKO back with a STAB Flying-type move or set entry hazards. More offensive Flying-types like Tornadus, Dragonite, and Salamence can use Breloom to set up Substitute or Dragon Dance, or they can threaten an immediate OHKO with their STAB moves. Thundurus-T can use Breloom to set up Substitute and Agillity or immediately threaten it with Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: If using Facade, Breloom can't touch Ghost-type Pokemon like Jellicent and Gengar. However, they need to scout for a Grass-type move, since Seed Bomb 2HKOes Jellicent and heavily damages Gengar.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Setup Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance is the preferred move to boost Breloom's Attack to insane levels and to immediately threaten Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Reuniclus. However, Bulk Up is an option if your team prefers a more controlled game pace, as it reduces damage from Excadrill's Iron Head and Keldeo's Secret Sword. Protect lets Breloom scout moves, activate Toxic Orb, and stall for Poison Heal recovery. Drain Punch contributes to Breloom's longevity by healing it while doing damage. The last slot is based on team preference: Facade is the best move to heavily damage bulky Pokemon like Amoonguss, Gliscor, and Reuniclus, while Seed Bomb targets Jellicent at the cost of not doing much damage to Latios, Celebi, Amoonguss, and Thundurus-T. If Breloom doesn't need the extra longevity from Drain Punch, Superpower can be used to have a stronger attack without needing any boosts.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>236 HP and 212 Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature maximize Breloom's bulk and Poison Heal recovery. 60 Speed EVs let Breloom outspeed standard specially defensive Heatran. Another possible EV spread is 236 HP / 36 Atk / 176 SpD / 60 Spe with an Adamant nature to OHKO standard Tentacruel with Facade after a Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avoid switching Breloom into Scald and Will-O-Wisp users before Toxic Orb has activated, as burns nullify Poison Heal. Because of this risk, leading with Breloom and using Protect Turn 1 is normally the best opening play possible. Use Breloom to steal momentum from Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W, which don't want to take any of Breloom's moves or give it a chance to freely set up. If your opponent has fast and powerful Breloom switch-ins like Latios and Thundurus-T, expect these Pokemon to switch in and use Facade on the switch to weaken them. Take advantage of Breloom's versatility as both a threat to balance teams with its setup options and a VoltTurn punisher that scares away Rotom-W and Ferrothorn, taking offensive momentum from your opponent throughout the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Breloom set has very good synergy with sand teams, since Poison Heal removes the residual damage from sand and lets Breloom counter Pokemon that trouble this structure, like Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, Politoed, and Tentacruel. Tyranitar is an amazing partner, as it sets up sand and can Pursuit trap Psychic-types such as Latios, Latias, Reuniclus, and Alakazam. Good answers to Excadrill, like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Skarmory, are also very good options, since Sand Force-boosted Iron Head immediately threatens Breloom that have not boosted with Bulk Up. Latios, Alakazam, Reuniclus, Mamoswine, and Garchomp are some of the most common offensive Pokemon that capitalize on Breloom's wallbreaking. Breloom also functions on rain teams as a way to force out Rotom-W. Rain Pokemon like Politoed, Tentacruel, Starmie, Keldeo, and Jirachi have very good defensive and offensive synergy with Breloom. Jirachi and Breloom in particular cover each other's weaknesses.</p>"
      },
      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute takes advantage of the switches Breloom forces to create a huge offensive threat with STAB Focus Punch. Even Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Latios and Thundurus-T take massive damage from Focus Punch. Protect lets Breloom safely activate Toxic Orb and, alongside Poison Heal and Substitute, become a durable PP staller if sand is not in play. Seed Bomb is the best option to hit Jellicent and heavily damage Tyranitar and Politoed without needing a Substitute. Facade can be used as a reliable, strong move and deals more damage to Amoonguss, Celebi, Reuniclus, and Gliscor; however, it makes Breloom useless versus Jellicent.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>236 HP EVs maximize Poison Heal recovery and make standard Rotom-W's Volt Switch unable to break Breloom's Substitute. 20 Special Defense EVs reduce the chance of standard Landorus-T 2HKOing Breloom with Hidden Power Ice in sand. Breloom can invest a bit in Speed to not be a target of Encore from standard defensive Politoed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Turn 1 Protect is one of Breloom's best possible moves, as Breloom does not need to fear a burn from Scald or Will-O-Wisp after activating Toxic Orb. Try to switch Breloom into Pokemon it naturally beats, like Rotom-W, Politoed, and Ferrothorn lacking Gyro Ball, so it can freely use Substitute when they switch out. Take advantage of Substitute + Protect, especially if there is no sand, to PP stall even Pokemon that could normally defeat Breloom like Latios, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. Do not be afraid to use Focus Punch behind Substitute, since even Pokemon that resist Fighting-type attacks receive massive damage from it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since this set forces a lot of switches from your opponent, its best partners are entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Skarmory for Spikes and Tentacruel for Toxic Spikes. Good Stealth Rock users like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Heatran, and Gliscor are also very good choices. If using Facade, Tyranitar is one of Breloom's best friends to Pursuit trap Jellicent. Scizor can Pursuit trap Psychic-types and safely bring in Breloom with U-turn. Other VoltTurn users are also amazing options. Pokemon that provide paralysis support, like Alakazam, Latias, and Jirachi, are very valuable, since full paralysis activating at the same time as Breloom sets up a Substitute has game-changing effects. If Breloom is using Seed Bomb, Psychic-types or strong special attackers, like Latios, Alakazam, Reuniclus, Hydreigon, and Tornadus, are needed to remove Amoonguss, which counters Breloom. If it is used outside of sand, remember to partner Breloom with weather-neutralizing Pokemon like Sunny Day Magnezone and Heatran so it can use the lack of sand damage to PP stall its foes.</p>"
      },
      "Technician": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bullet Seed is the best STAB move to use, since Technician gives it a massive power boost. Mach Punch provides priority and benefits from Technician, turning Breloom into a decent revenge killer. Low Sweep also benefits from Technician and is one of the best moves to use on a predicted switch-in, since even Fighting-resistant Pokemon take a lot of damage from it and have their Speed lowered, letting Breloom 2HKO them in most cases. Superpower is Breloom's most powerful STAB option but pressures it to switch out, while Stone Edge is the best option to hit Dragonite, Celebi, and Amoonguss. Another option is to use Facade to let Breloom deal consistent damage after it has been burned.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Mamoswine and Dragonite as well as Modest Heatran. Choice Band provides a larger power boost that applies to all of Breloom's moves while Fist Plate allows Breloom to switch moves and boost the power of its Fighting-type moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The best way to use this Breloom set is by bluffing a Poison Heal set and leading with it. Since most opponents will use the Protect turn from Poison Heal Breloom to set entry hazards or switch to a better Pokemon, Choice Band Breloom can grab a surprise KO with the correct prediction. Once the absence of Poison Heal is revealed, do not be afraid to play aggressively with Breloom and make double switches, since your opponent will try to prevent it from entering the field at all costs. Correct predictions and good switching are what make this set dangerous, so try to maintain offensive pressure at all times.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Breloom set belongs on hyper offensive teams alongside Pokemon like Scizor, Volcarona, Dragonite, Salamence, Garchomp, Starmie and suicide lead Skarmory. Pokemon that can deal with Skarmory, like Magnezone, Garchomp, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon, are also good partners.</p>"

  "Salamence": {
    "overview": "<p>Salamence is a decent addition to DragMag teams over Dragonite due to its better Speed, Moxie, and surprise factor. Its Speed gives it the leg up on common Pokemon like Landorus-T and Excadrill, while Moxie lets it have more potential to sweep after a KO, making Dragon Dance sets potentially more dangerous than Dragonite while also letting it run a solid Choice Scarf set. Its Dragon Dance set can find a decent amount of setup opportunities on Pokemon like Gliscor, Ferrothorn lacking Gyro Ball and Leech Seed, and Heatran and Volcarona lacking Hidden Power Ice as a result of its decent typing and good Speed. It also has more surprise value than Dragonite on DragMag teams due to it being less common and its sets requiring different counterplay. However, Salamence has a harder time setting up Dragon Dance than Dragonite as a result of its worse bulk and lack of Multiscale; these issues and its lack of Extreme Speed cause it to perform worse against offensive teams that don't let it easily set up. Beyond competing with Dragonite, Salamence is also weak to Stealth Rock and can have its sweep cut short by common Choice Scarf users like Latios, Keldeo, and Garchomp. It also doesn't fit on any other team styles except DragMag due to its lack of utility compared to other Dragon-types like Dragonite, Latios, Garchomp, and Hydreigon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tailwind can be used over Hidden Power Ice on the Choice Scarf set to grant whatever comes in after it higher Speed so they can sweep themselves should Salamence be unable to pull of its own sweep. However, it's situational, and Hidden Power Ice heavily damaging Landorus-T and Gliscor is usually more beneficial to DragMag partners that are checked by them anyway. Mixed and special sets may seem good thanks to Salamence's high Special Attack and great movepool; however, it's outclassed in these roles by Pokemon like Latios, Alakazam, Jirachi, and Hydreigon. Flamethrower or Fire Blast over Dragon Claw on the Dragon Dance set or Hidden Power Ice on the Choice Scarf set may seem appealing to let Salamence beat Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Skarmory. However, Magnezone traps these threats, and both Dragon Claw and Hidden Power Ice bring much more value.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon that can hit Salamence super effectively, like Latios, Alakazam, Keldeo, and Garchomp, all force Salamence out. Keldeo, Garchomp, and Latios can all also run Choice Scarf sets to outspeed even boosted Salamence, while Mamoswine can circumvent its Speed boosts with Ice Shard. However, these Pokemon struggle to switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulkier Pokemon like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Slowbro, and Reuniclus can take at least one of Salamence's hits from full health, even when boosted, and hit it back super effectively with Ice--type coverage.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis makes Salamence unable to outspeed anything and burn cuts its Attack; both make it more or less useless. Poison wears Salamence down, making it more difficult to sweep; however, it it doesn't hinder any of Salamence's stats, so it still poses a threat even when poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Skarmory is able to wall Salamence by healing off its hits with Roost and phazing it out with Whirlwind; it can also set up Spikes on it. Ferrothorn can wear down Salamence with Leech Seed or stop it from setting up in front of it with Gyro Ball or Thunder Wave. However, sets lacking these moves can be set up on. Air Balloon Heatran can't be hit with Earthquake and can KO Salamence with Hidden Power Ice. These Pokemon must be wary of getting trapped and KOed by Magnezone, however.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake hits all Steel-types that aren't Skarmory or Ferrothorn hard while also heavily damaging Tyranitar. Dragon Claw is used alongside Outrage to give Salamence a more reliable STAB option so it doesn't need to lock into Outrage and get confused. Aqua Tail should be used over Dragon Claw if if Salamence is paired with rain since the weather lets Salamence threaten Pokemon like Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Air Balloon Heatran.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread outspeeds Choice Scarf Landorus-T after a boost with the HP ensuring its Stone Edge doesn't OHKO Salamence. Moxie is chosen to let Salamence more easily sweep after getting a KO. Lum Berry is to more easily set up on Pokemon like Rotom-W, Jellicent, Tentacruel, and Politoed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As the other half of the DragMag core, Magnezone is an essential partner for trapping Steel-types like Skarmory and Ferrothorn so Salamence can more easily sweep. Magnezone can also safely switch Salamence in with Volt Switch if running a Choice item or force in Ground- or Fighting- types that Salamence can set up on. Jirachi sets up Stealth Rock so Salamence is even harder to switch into while also safely pivoting it in with U-Turn. It can also take Dragon- and Ice-type moves from Pokemon like Latios, Alakazam, and Reuniclus. Choice Band Kyurem-B is able to break the opposing team open with its powerful Outrage so Salamence can more easily sweep. Fast Dragon-types, namely Choice Scarf variants of Garchomp and Latios, can sweep late-game thanks to the holes Salamence creates in the opposing team while also putting less pressure on it to act as a DragMag teams only method to take on opposing offensive teams. Salac Berry Garchomp can be used in tandem with Salamence to threaten faster teams while forming a dual setup core that can break through bulkier teams. Offensive Starmie can remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin while outspeeding and threatening Pokemon faster than Salamence like opposing Garchomp, Latios, Thundurus-T, and Keldeo.</p> <p>This set can also fit on rain teams due to it giving rain teams a strong sweeper and means to threaten sand teams. Politoed is required to bring rain and can take Ice-type attacks while also baiting in bulky Water- and Grass-types like Gastrodon lacking Ice Beam, Breloom, and Celebi that Salamence can set up on. Politoed can also run Encore to lock Pokemon into moves that Salamence can set up on, like Celebi using Giga Drain. Choice Scarf Keldeo is a fantastic revenge killer on rain teams and gives Salamence a partner that backs it up against offensive teams so there isn't as much of a burden on its shoulders to win the game. Choice Specs Keldeo, on the other hand, can pressure bulkier threats so Salamence can break through them more easily. Thundurus-T is able to wallbreak effectively with its 3 attacks set that takes out answers to Salamence like Skarmory and Slowbro. The two of them together also put a lot of pressure on sand teams, since sand teams can only really handle one of them before the other finishes the job. Tentacruel can use Rapid Spin to keep Stealth Rock off the field, take on Steel-types like Scizor, Heatran, and Excadrill, and tank Ice-type attacks, while Salamence puts a lot of pressure on sand teams where Tentacruel may not be able to do as much against. Ferrothorn is able to counter opposing Dragon-types like Latios and Kyurem-B, handle Water-types like Starmie, and set Stealth Rock and Spikes.</p>"

Hidden Power Ice OHKOes Choice Scarf Landorus-T after Stealth Rock while doing the same to bulkier variants with a bit more prior damage, letting Salamence more easily sweep later in the game since Landorus-T can no longer Intimidate it while it uses Outrage. Fire Blast can be used over Hidden Power Ice to reduce Salamence's dependency on Magnezone to take out Steel-types. However, it's generally redundant, and Hidden Power Ice has more overall utility most of the time. Dragon Claw is used alongside Outrage to give Salamence a more reliable STAB option so it doesn't need to lock into Outrage and get confused.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread outspeeds Choice Scarf Landorus-T and improves Hidden Power Ice's damage rolls on Gliscor and Landorus-T. Moxie is chosen to let Salamence more easily sweep after getting a KO.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone traps Steel-types like Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill with an Air Balloon set and wears down other bulky Pokemon like Tyranitar and Reuniclus so Salamence can more easily KO them and start its sweep.

It can also take Dragon- and Ice-type moves from Pokemon like Latios, Alakazam, and Reuniclus. Choice Band Kyurem-B is able to break the opposing team open with its powerful Outrages so Salamence can more easily sweep late-game. Other wallbreaking Dragon-types like Choice Specs Latios and Swords Dance Garchomp can do much the same. However, Choice Scarf variants of Garchomp and Latios can still be used alongside this set to provide even more of a safety net against offensive teams and can also sweep late-game with the holes Salamence breaks should it fail to sweep outright. Offensive Starmie can remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin while outspeeding and threatening Pokemon faster than Salamence like opposing Garchomp, Latios, Thundurus-T, and Keldeo.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Metagross has a very small niche in BW OU as the only Steel-type that learns Pursuit, Stealth Rock, and Explosion, which makes it a fringe option on hyper offense teams that would like to compress a way to remove Latios and a Stealth Rock setter that maintains momentum into one teamslot. However, it's often not worth using due to the existence of better offensive Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp, Jirachi, and Landorus-T, as they are faster and have much better matchups against the majority of the metagame. It's also outclassed by other Steel-types, including Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Jirachi, Heatran, and Skarmory, in every other role as a result of their better defensive profiles, letting them more consistently check many of the metagame's offensive threats, and superior support movepools, letting them more easily set up or even remove entry hazards.</p>",

  "Latias": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite competition with Latios, Latias still makes for a great Pokemon in the metagame thanks to its superior bulk and access to Healing Wish while still offering the qualities that Latios brings to teams, such as sharing its same typing, Speed, and most importantly, an immunity to Spikes and Ground-type attacks thanks to Levitate. These excellent traits are key to keep checking threats throughout a game like Breloom, Terrakion, and Keldeo. Latias's superior bulk also allows it to act as one of the best checks to special attacking threats such as Thundurus-T and Keldeo, making it a very good answer to rain teams. Its Speed tier is incredible, as it's the defining benchmark of the tier and allows Latias to outspeed threats such as Terrakion, Keldeo, Garchomp, and Thundurus-T, as well as Speed tying Latios. Latias's main flaws are having stringent competition with Latios due to Latias's comparative lack of power to Latios and Tyranitar being very common and consistently Pursuit trapping, which is made even easier by the aforementioned lower power.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Latias can run Choice Specs over Choice Scarf, as despite not having enough firepower in comparison to other similar Choice Specs users such as Latios and Keldeo, it can still be effective due to Latias's additional bulk providing more chances than Latios to switch into and KO Keldeo and Thundurus-T in a single attack. Latias has historically ran a mono-attacking Calm Mind set with a set of Calm Mind, Dragon Pulse, Recover, and either Refresh or Substitute to completely blank rain teams and potentially win on the spot, should Latias's checks be eliminated or weakened. But, such a set is no longer effective in the metagame due to enormous competition with Reuniclus in this role, the fact that it needs a lot of support to get going, and how it's completely dead weight against sand teams due to how thoroughly it is countered by common staples such as Excadrill and Tyranitar. Latias can run a dual screens set with Healing Wish to support hyper offense Pokemon such as Volcarona, Conkeldurr, and Dragonite, but such a set does allow the opponent many turns to react and counter the incoming Healing Wish recipient with Stealth Rock, phazing, or disruption such as Encore and Taunt.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Thanks to Tyranitar's Special Defense boost in sand and unique typing, its arguably the best check to Latias in the tier, as it can take most of Latias's moves while threatening Crunch if Latias stays in or Pursuit if it switches out, both of which OHKO Latias if it predicts wrong. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can outspeed Latias and can force Crunch or Pursuit mind games. However, Latias often runs Colbur Berry to survive at least one attack from Tyranitar while crippling it in return with Thunder Wave, making it more vulnerable to Latias's teammates such as Calm Mind Reuniclus. Trick from Choice Scarf and Choice Specs sets can also ruin non-Choice item Tyranitar sets, as it doesn't enjoy losing it Chople Berry on support sets.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Jirachi, Scizor, and Skarmory all answer Latias thanks to their bulk and resistance to its STAB moves. Ferrothorn and Skarmory can very consistently switch into Draco Meteor and Surf in order to set up entry hazards, while Scizor is able to set up a Swords Dance or utilize its Bug typing to threaten Latias with a U-turn or potentially Pursuit trap it. Jirachi has numerous coverage and status moves to threaten Latias as well as Calm Mind to easily set up on it. However, Scizor and Ferrothorn have to watch out for Hidden Power Fire variants of Latias, and Scizor still has to be wary of rain-boosted Surf, while both Ferrothorn and Skarmory are ruined by Trick from Choice item sets. Skarmory and Jirachi can also be ruined by Thunder Wave from Colbur Berry sets, which can leave them vulnerable to teammates like Alakazam and Swords Dance Excadrill.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey, Celebi, and Clefable don't take much damage from Latias's attacks and can force progress by setting up Stealth Rock, impairing with Thunder Wave, or, in Clefable's case, threaten Latias's team with Knock Off. However, Trick from either Choice Scarf or Choice Specs sets can still ruin all of these Pokemon. Neither Celebi nor Clefable can switch into Choice Specs sets, as Draco Meteor can still potentially 2HKO them, and Thunder Wave from Colbur Berry Latias sets can also ruin Clefable.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that are naturally faster than Latias such as Starmie and Alakazam can threaten it thanks to their super effective coverage. Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp, Keldeo, Salamence, and Kyurem-B can also revenge kill non-Choice Scarf Latias; however, all of these Pokemon can get revenge killed by Choice Scarf Latias. Starmie and Alakazam can also have their Speed ruined by paralysis from Colbur Berry sets.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Latias's great bulk and Speed tier, good Special Attack, and access to Healing Wish allow it to be an excellent Choice Scarf user in the metagame, tying with Latios as the fastest Choice Scarf user seen in the tier and allowing it to outrun and KO Speed-boosting Pokemon such as Dragonite, Salamence, and Volcarona. Draco Meteor is strong enough to revenge kill most Pokemon that don't resist it such as Thundurus-T, Starmie, and Keldeo while always OHKOing Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Latios, and Kyurem-B. Surf gives Latias excellent coverage against Pokemon like Heatran, Excadrill, and Volcarona, as well as pressuring Ground-types such as Gliscor and Landorus-T. Trick cripples bulkier Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Blissey, Clefable, and Jirachi that could take on Latias's attacks while also preventing Calm Mind Reuniclus from getting out of hand. Healing Wish differentiates Latias from Latios, granting a weakened teammate like Volcarona, Dragonite, or Breloom another chance to assault foes. Psyshock is an option over Surf that OHKOes Calm Mind-boosted Keldeo. However, dropping Surf allows Steel-types to much more consistently answer Latias, while dropping Healing Wish leaves only Latias's bulk to differentiate itself from the excellent Latios.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Latias to outspeed everything up until +2 Dragonite, +1 Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Keldeo and Garchomp.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Latias fits best on offensive teams, such as rain and weatherless teams, as it combines important offensive and defensive traits to builds while carrying important utility. Its typing and bulk allow it to reliably switch into Keldeo, Thundurus-T, or Choice Band-boosted Close Combat from Terrakion and threaten to KO them back with Draco Meteor or Surf after they've been slightly weakened. Latias's Speed tier is also crucial, allowing it to outrun Speed-boosted Pokemon and Choice Scarf users, such as Volcarona, Garchomp, and Dragonite; rain teams in particular enjoy Latias providing great speed control and bulk to help guard them against these Pokemon. Politoed brings the rain and powers up Latias's Surf, which can allow it to more easily damage Pokemon that are weak to Surf such as Heatran, Gliscor, and Excadrill. Keldeo makes for a great teammate with Latias, as it appreciates Latias's ability to revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Alakazam, Starmie, and boosted Dragonite. In return, Keldeo can help Latias in dealing with special walls such as Tyranitar and Blissey and Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Heatran. Ferrothorn can provide entry hazards for Latias, which allows it to more comfortably revenge kill Pokemon, and in return, Latias can answer Fire- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Heatran, Terrakion, and Keldeo. Rain wallbreakers such as Thundurus-T and Starmie make for excellent teammates, since they can break through Latias's checks such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Starmie can spin away hazards to increase Latias's survivability, as well as being able to force more damage onto Tyranitar and Ferrothorn for Latias. In return, Latias can revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Alakazam and boosted Dragonite, which can allow Starmie and Thundurus-T to wallbreak or sweep more effectively. Latias can be used on weatherless teams as well thanks to it providing crucial speed control, Healing Wish, and a Pokemon that crucially resists Water, allowing hyper offense teams to match up much better against rain teams. Lead Jirachi and offensive Garchomp can set up Stealth Rock for Latias. Garchomp can also break through Latias's checks such as Heatran, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn, while Jirachi can pivot into dangerous threats such as Alakazam, opposing Choice Scarf Latias, and Latios. Other offensive Pokemon found on weatherless teams such as Volcarona, Breloom, Dragonite, and Scizor all appreciate Latias's revenge-killing capabilities in addition to Healing Wish support for a second assault.</p>"

      "Colbur Berry": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With a Colbur Berry, Latias can maximize its defensive utility and more safely take on Tyranitar by being able to escape it or stay in and try to ruin it with paralysis so slower teammates such as Reuniclus can exploit it. Draco Meteor still threatens to 2HKO Pokemon that don't resist it such as Keldeo and Rotom-W. Surf complements Draco Meteor perfectly, allowing Latias to 2HKO Excadrill and Heatran, which could otherwise take on Draco Meteor. Thunder Wave lets Latias spread paralysis on Pokemon that rely on their Speed such as Keldeo, Terrakion, and even Starmie. Thunder Wave can also ruin switch-ins to Latias such as Skarmory, Clefable, and Reuniclus. Roost allows Latias to maximize its longevity and heal off attacks. Hidden Power Fire can be used over Thunder Wave to allow Latias to more easily pressure Steel-types such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. However, dropping Thunder Wave for it gives up Latias's ability to spread paralysis.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Colbur Berry allows Latias to live Crunch or Pursuit from Tyranitar once, allowing it to continuously check foes such as Keldeo and Terrakion. Maximum Speed allows Latias to Speed tie Latios as well as outspeed Keldeo and Terrakion.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Colbur Berry Latias fits incredibly well on sand teams thanks to it being able to combat rain teams and resist Water-type attacks on such teams. Tyranitar is an excellent partner that can set sand and Pursuit trap Pokemon such as Alakazam and Latios, which can prevent Latias from getting revenge killed. Hippowdon can set Stealth Rock and sand and take on boosted threats and phaze them out such as Volcarona and Dragonite. In return, Latias can check Water- and Grass-types such as Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Breloom for both of them. Clefable synergizes well with Latias, since they can spread paralysis to help slower wincons such as Calm Mind Reuniclus, while Latias can also check threats such as Keldeo, Terrakion, and Thundurus-T for Clefable. Reuniclus appreciates Latias's ability to wear down Tyranitar and spread paralysis to make up for its low Speed, helping it sweep more consistently and beat opposing Reuniclus in a Calm Mind war; it is also able to combat Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Breloom with Latias. Swords Dance Excadrill is similar in how it appreciates Latias spreading paralysis so it can outspeed faster Pokemon and overwhelm bulkier Pokemon such as Skarmory. Latias can also check faster Pokemon that are immune to paralysis such as Landorus-T and Garchomp as well as Rotom-W. Skarmory and Ferrothorn can set up entry hazards for Latias, allowing Latias to break through checks such as Tyranitar in the long run, while being able to check Pokemon that Latias can't outspeed such as Choice Scarf Garchomp and Dragon Dance-boosted Dragonite. In return, Latias is able to check powerful threats such as Heatran, Thundurus-T, and Keldeo that could otherwise overwhelm Skarmory and Ferrothorn. Alakazam can revenge kill faster Pokemon for Latias, and both of them can wear down Tyranitar together. Keldeo is a strong offensive teammate that can help check Volcarona and Tyranitar as well as special walls such as Blissey and Clefable for Latias. In return, Latias can spread paralysis on faster Pokemon such as Starmie and Alakazam, allowing Keldeo to take advantage of their lowered Speed. Latias can check Rotom-W for Keldeo as well.</p>"

  "Latios": {
    "overview": "<p>Latios is one of, if not the, best wallbreakers in the metagame thanks to its insanely strong, nearly unresisted STAB Draco Meteor. This makes sets utilizing Choice Specs very difficult to switch into, let alone wall. This is further compounded by Trick crippling almost every defensive answer. It also has a great Speed tier that allows it to outspeed prominent threats like Keldeo, Terrakion, and Garchomp. This makes it a great Choice Scarf user, as it can outspeed all other Choice Scarf users and boosted sweepers. Latios's decent bulk and typing let it check Pokemon like Keldeo, Thundurus-T, Breloom, and Gliscor relatively well, which is made even easier due to its immunity to Spikes. It can even run Recover to aid its ability to check these Pokemon and mitigate sand and Stealth Rock damage. It's also great on rain teams, where it can hit most Steel-types hard with boosted Surf. Latios can also work on sand teams thanks to sand damage wearing down some of its counters and its ability to check and remove many Pokemon that pressure sand teams well, namely Breloom, Heatran, and Gliscor. However, despite its incredible strength, Draco Meteor leaves Latios incredibly exploitable after being used and usually forces it out. This is especially bad due to Tyranitar being very common and being able to easily Pursuit trap it after Draco Meteor has been used. Latios is also very vulnerable to many common residual damage sources like sand and Stealth Rock, which impedes its ability to stay healthy throughout a match, come in to attack, and check the things it should be able to.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Dragon Dance set with Life Orb, Earthquake, and Ice Beam can be used as a lure to dent Latios's counters in Jirachi and Tyranitar while also outspeeding all common Choice Scarf users in the tier when boosted. This set should only be used on teams utilizing Magnezone, however. An Expert Belt or Life Orb set with Draco Meteor, Surf, Roost, and Hidden Power Fire can be run to hit Pokemon like Ferrothorn that can take one move from Latios but not another while retaining good damage overall. Expert Belt also helps Latios retain more longevity and lets it bluff a Choice item set, while Life Orb sets are able to do more damage to a broader range of targets. A Trick + Flame Orb set can be used as a lead on rain teams to lure in and cripple switch-ins like Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn, helping its teammates that have a hard time breaking these Pokemon and potentially gaining an advantage in the weather war. However, it lacks the power or Speed boost of Choice item sets. Also, common leads that run Protect, like Breloom and Gliscor, ruin this set's surprise value and leave it easily handled. A set utilizing dual screens with Memento and Light Clay can be used to aid hyper offense teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar is the best Latios counter in the metagame because it can take at least one hit if healthy and easily trap Latios with Pursuit after a Draco Meteor or Dragon Pulse while getting a guaranteed Pursuit trap if it can get in via a double switch or sacrificed teammate. Specially defensive Tyranitar deters Draco Meteor spam with the threat of trapping Latios and has an easier time coming in on it. However, it has to be careful to not come in on a Choice Specs-boosted Surf with Stealth Rock down, as it has a low chance to 2HKO Tyranitar, although the chance is very low. The Choice Scarf set, on the other hand, is able to trap Latios easily, as it can take any hit from the Choice Specs set after Stealth Rock without having to take an extra hit if Latios isn't Choice Scarf itself. However, it needs to be careful coming into Choice Scarf Latios with Stealth Rock down, as it can 2HKO this Tyranitar. It should also be noted non-Choice Band Tyranitar is unable to OHKO Latios with Pursuit if it doesn't switch, so correct prediction is required.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn, Jirachi, Bronzong, and Scizor can take multiple hits and get up entry hazards, cripple Latios with status or, in Scizor's case, use U-turn to gain momentum or Pursuit to trap Latios. Defensive Heatran and Excadrill can take multiple Draco Meteors but must watch out for Surf.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Regenerator Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon with Regenerator, namely Slowking and Amoonguss, can take any hit, even a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor, and make it much easier for the opponent to pivot around Latios as a result. Slowking and Amoonguss can even cripple Latios with paralysis, making it risky for Latios to just throw out a Draco Meteor while they're in. However, Amoonguss must watch out for Psyshock, and Slowking needs to be wary of Trick.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can take any hit and heal off the damage with Soft-Boiled while crippling Latios with Toxic or Thunder Wave, although it must watch out for Trick, Psyshock, and boosted Draco Meteor if it's worn down.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers and Priority</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf users, Alakazam, Tornadus, and Mamoswine can all force Latios out thanks to their powerful attacks.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor, even when unboosted, is a powerful attack that can do good damage to offensive Pokemon. Surf synergizes well with potential rain support, can hit Steel-types like Heatran and Excadrill hard, and deals good damage to boosted Volcarona in rain. Trick cripples switch-ins trying to take advantage of the fact that this Latios is weaker and help its teammates break through defensive cores. Dragon Pulse gives a spammable late-game STAB attack if you're not able to afford a potential miss or if the power of Draco Meteor isn't necessary to nab a KO. It also makes the matchup against DragMag teams even better because the power of Draco Meteor isn't needed to take out most members of those teams. Recover is an option that gives Latios the ability to more efficiently handle Keldeo and Breloom in the long run, although it should only be used with Trick. Alternatively, Psyshock can OHKO Terrakion in sand and nails Keldeo, Tentacruel, and Breloom while also doing good damage to boosted Volcarona outside of rain. Thunder has perfect accuracy in rain and gives Latios a way to hit boosted Gyarados, Keldeo, and Politoed without having to lock into Draco Meteor. However, it's very exploitable and doesn't hit anything besides Water- and most Flying-types hard enough.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature is used over Modest, as it allows Latios to outspeed all other Choice Scarf users and boosted sweepers in the tier.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Latios as a hit-and-run revenge killer to handle threats that would otherwise sweep your team. Attempt to use Trick on defensive Pokemon that can impede Latios or its teammates if the Speed boost from Choice Scarf isn't needed. Getting Latios in via VoltTurn, a double switch, or a sacrifice to check what it needs to and not take unnecessary damage so it can take a hit mid- or late-game is the most optimal scenario. If coming in directly with Latios, get it in on attacks it resists or is immune to like Choice Scarf Keldeo's STAB attacks or Earthquake. If the opposing team is weakened enough, Latios can sweep late-game if it still has its Choice Scarf and doesn't need to lock into Draco Meteor. If the opponent is using Tyranitar and Latios is on a rain team, try to eliminate or weaken Tyranitar to win the weather war and make this Latios much more effective. This Latios is very good against DragMag teams, so, if up against one, try to wear down or take out the Steel-types so Latios can very easily clean. As this Latios will be coming in on setup sweepers like Thundurus-T, Breloom, and Reuniclus often, it's expected that it'll be taking damage, so try to not make it take too much unneeded chip damage, as it needs to be healthy for Thundurus-T, Keldeo, and Dragon Dance users. Staying healthy is also important for getting Trick off in the long game against Pokemon like Jirachi and Reuniclus.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Latios works very well on offensive rain teams, so Politoed is a great teammate. The defensive variant, in particular, is a good partner, because it can wear down common Latios switch-ins via status. In return, Latios can handle more offensive teams for it and cripple potentially problematic Pokemon like Ferrothorn with Trick. Tentacruel and Starmie, if this set is being used on rain, can use Rapid Spin to increase Latios's longevity while being better switch-ins to other Water- and Fighting-types. Tentacruel can lay down Toxic Spikes or spread poison with Toxic to wear down switch-ins, while Starmie can break holes in the opposing team so Latios can sweep late-game. Tyranitar, particularly the Chople Berry set, is also a good partner on non-rain teams, since it can bring sand and Stealth Rock to wear down some potential switch-ins to help get Latios closer to a late-game sweep. Excadrill is a good spinner on sand teams and takes on Tyranitar and Steel-types for Latios while also taking advantage of Latios's ability to offensively pressure Keldeo. Keldeo takes advantage of Latios threatening Jellicent, Tentacruel, and Amoonguss while also beating down Steel-types, Chansey, and Tyranitar and breaking other walls that can impede a Latios sweep, while Latios can handle boosted sweepers Keldeo may not be able to handle like Dragonite. Ferrothorn can set Stealth Rock and Spikes to help Latios sweep and consistently switch into Water- and Dragon-types to ease the pressure off of Latios to switch into them. Thundurus-T is another good wallbreaker and potential late-game cleaner that appreciates Trick support to let it set up on and beat its checks while having sweeping potential itself with Agility. Ground-types like Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Garchomp can take down Steel-types and potentially set Stealth Rock to facilitate a sweep for Latios. In return, Latios can threaten physical walls like Gliscor and Slowbro. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock and use Toxic or Will-O-Wisp a cripple a potential check, namely Tyranitar or Slowking, while also checking Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Jirachi. In return, Latios can come in on Water- and Ground-types as well as keep a potentially boosted Volcarona in check to lift the burden off of Heatran to handle it. Magnezone is able to trap the Steel-types that can easily impede a sweep from this set, which helps Latios clean through much more easily late-game. Rotom-W brings another Keldeo and Gliscor check, easing the pressure off Latios to handle them, supplies a slow Volt Switch to bring Latios in safely, and burns Tyranitar and Ferrothorn to make it easier for Latios to break through them for a sweep late-game.</p>"

      "Colbur Berry": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Even unboosted, Draco Meteor threatens to 2HKO almost all non-resistant Pokemon in the tier. Surf hits Steel-types like Heatran and Excadrill and lets Latios deal good damage to common Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T without dropping its Special Attack. Recover lets Latios check Heatran, Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Thundurus-T more reliably. The last move depends on Latios's teammates; Roar is better paired with Spikes setters and its main use is to phaze Tyranitar, which will try to Pursuit trap Latios after Draco Meteor, but it also phazes Calm Mind users like Reuniclus. Hidden Power Fire is the better option on teams that want to bait in Ferrothorn, since it is the natural defensive Latios switch-in, and deals good damage to Skarmory and Jirachi, but the Speed IV drop makes Latios always lose to opposing Latios and Latias that lack the move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Colbur Berry lets Latios escape from Tyranitar's Pursuit via Roar at least once. If Latios hasn't already used Draco Meteor, it can instead deal massive damage to Tyranitar with Surf followed by Draco Meteor, which KOes offensive Tyranitar with Stealth Rock on the field.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Since Colbur Berry Latios has a one-time escape from Tyranitar, use it early-game to exert offensive pressure on slower Pokemon like Breloom, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. Try to have entry hazards on the field as quickly as possible, since Latios forces a lot of switches. Use Roar if you predict a switch to a Pokemon Latios can't deal much damage to, like Ferrothorn or Jirachi, especially if Spikes is up. Do not be afraid to use Draco Meteor if it will grab a KO, since players usually remove Latios by sacrificing a weakened Pokemon to Draco Meteor and then bringing Tyranitar in to Pursuit trap it—which fails spectacularly against this specific set. If using Hidden Power Fire, correctly predict a Ferrothorn switch-in to not let it use entry hazards, Gyro Ball, or Knock Off against Latios. Only reveal Hidden Power Fire in the correct moment, since it loses a lot of its effectiveness when the surprise factor is gone.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Colbur Berry Latios wants Spikes on the field, so Ferrothorn and Skarmory are its best partners. Ferrothorn also provides Stealth Rock and Knock Off support to help Latios break through defensive Pokemon. Skarmory provides Taunt support to block opposing entry hazards and can form a unexpected double phazer core with Latios. Other Stealth Rock users like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor are also very good teammates; Gliscor especially, since it can also offer Knock Off, Taunt, or U-turn support, as well as good offensive synergy if running Swords Dance. Tyranitar is great to Pursuit trap Psychic-types that can try to use a non-Choice Specs or Choice Scarf Latios to set up Calm Mind, like Reuniclus. Tyranitar also deals with opposing Latios, which can be problematic if using Hidden Power Fire because of the Speed IV drop. Pokemon that can spread status like Rotom-W, Heatran, Giscor, Jellicent, and Mew support Latios well with the extra damage that a burn or a poison provides. Pokemon that can prevent opposing entry hazards from going up, either via Magic Bounce like Xatu or by trapping like Magnezone, are good partners. Rapid Spin support from Excadrill is advised, especially if not using Hidden Power Fire and therefore sacrificing power against Ferrothorn. Offensively, partners that like Colbur Berry Latios's ability to bait in and damage Tyranitar, like Reuniclus and Alakazam, are very good choices. Breloom is amazing to capitalize on a Ferrothorn switch-in to set up Swords Dance, Bulk Up, or Substitute or threaten an immediate KO with Technician sets. Breloom also provides interesting defensive synergy with Latios against rain structures with the stacked Water and Electric resistances. Mamoswine is another good offensive option, since it can deal with Dragon-types and Thundurus-T with Ice Shard, and it can capitalize on Latios's Roar or Hidden Power Fire to finish off weakened teams with its Substitute set.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is what makes Latios such a brutal wallbreaker, as it's nearly unresisted and can even break down some bulky resistant foes like Ferrothorn over time. Surf lets Latios do good damage to Pokemon that can come in on Draco Meteor like Heatran, Excadrill, and Tyranitar. It can also do great damage to Pokemon like specially defensive Jirachi in rain. Trick cripples switch-ins, including Ferrothorn, Jirachi, Tyranitar, and Chansey, while aiding teammates attempting to break through defensive cores. However, it should only be used if the extra power from Choice Specs isn't needed in the game. Trick also lets Latios potentially gain Leftovers, which nullifies sand damage and makes it easier to stay in if sand is up. Dragon Pulse is a safe move to lock into and spam due to its lack of a stat drop and perfect accuracy, which makes it a good late-game cleaning tool as well as a good move to use when wanting to not risk a miss. It also lets Latios save PP on Draco Meteor, which is especially nice against Pokemon that commonly run Protect like Breloom, Politoed, and Gliscor. Recover allows Latios to mitigate sand and entry hazard damage while making it easier to check Keldeo, Thundurus-T, and Breloom long-term. It's worth noting that Recover should only be used on sets with Trick. Psyshock is able to 2HKO Chansey after Stealth Rock while also OHKOing Tentacruel and Terrakion in sand. However, it leaves Latios as bait for Tyranitar, which is immune to Psyshock and is able to easily Pursuit trap Latios. Hidden Power Fighting lets Latios have a way to super effectively hit Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, and Excadrill but doesn't hit much else and makes Latios run an imperfect Speed IV, leaving it outsped by opposing Latios lacking it as well as the uncommon Gengar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature is used over Modest despite Modest letting Latios break through Tyranitar and other walls more easily in order to retain the ability to outspeed Keldeo, Garchomp, and Terrakion while also Speed tying opposing Latios</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Attempt to get Latios in safely through a double switch, a sacrifice, or VoltTurn support; it doesn't want to take too much damage despite its decent bulk and typing, as it will make it harder to fire off attacks and can potentially get it Pursuit trapped by a healthy Tyranitar. If Latios gets low on health, it may be best to throw out an attack to hit something hard and sacrifice it or use it as fodder later. Scout for Stun Spore Amoonguss as well as unexpected Choice Scarf users, as they can catch Latios off guard and cripple it. Use Trick as you predict the opponent to bring in a Pokemon that walls Latios and can be properly crippled by it, like Jirachi or Ferrothorn. However, don't use Trick if the power of Choice Specs is needed. Additionally, don't use Trick if predicting a Tyranitar to come in unless it helps further progress for a Pokemon like Alakazam, as it will lead to Latios being Pursuit trapped. Attempt to weaken Latios's checks so it can pressure the opponent even further and potentially sweep late-game with Surf or Dragon Pulse. It's also important to remove or at least wear down Tyranitar so Latios can't be Pursuit trapped.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-W brings another Keldeo and Gliscor check, easing the pressure off Latios to handle them, supplies a slow Volt Switch to bring Latios in safely, and burns Tyranitar and Ferrothorn to make it easier for Latios to break through them. Wallbreakers like Keldeo, Landorus-T, and Terrakion can break through Steel-types for Latios so it can easily spam Draco Meteor and or Dragon Pulse late-game. Bulky Steel-types like Jirachi, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory can check opposing Dragon- and Steel-types, while Latios can pressure and handle Fire- and Fighting-types for them. Entry hazards, particularly Spikes, are great with Latios, as its switch-ins are all incredibly vulnerable to them. Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, Excadrill, Heatran, and Skarmory can all get up entry hazards. Excadrill can also pressure opposing Steel-types and Tyranitar while supporting Latios with Rapid Spin so it can come in more easily. Meanwhile, Latios handles Gliscor and Breloom and wears down Skarmory for Excadrill. Politoed can remove sand to increase Latios's longevity, power up its Surf to make it pressure most Steel-types more effectively, and cripple switch-ins to Latios with status, while Latios can pressure many of Politoed's switch-ins. Magnezone can trap and remove Steel-types for Latios, making it particularly brutal to handle for many teams. Other Dragon-types like Garchomp and Kyurem-B work well with Latios to wear down each other's checks, especially in tandem with Magnezone on DragMag teams. Alakazam and Reuniclus can make good partners thanks to Latios usually wearing down or crippling mutual checks like Tyranitar and Jirachi. Alakazam, in particular, is a good partner due to Latios letting Alakazam potentially beat Tyranitar without breaking its Focus Sash. Tyranitar, particularly the Chople Berry set, can trap opposing Latios and Alakazam while bringing sand and Stealth Rock to wear down some potential switch-ins. In return, Latios can soft check Keldeo, Gliscor, and Breloom for it. Tornadus can take advantage of Latios wearing down Tyranitar and most Steel-types so it can spam Hurricane freely mid- and late-game.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind- and Draco Plate-boosted Draco Meteor does a ton of damage to almost everything in the metagame, most notably Tyranitar, but it should be used carefully as to not leave Latios too vulnerable after the Special Attack drop. Surf lets Latios do good damage to Heatran and Excadrill, which could otherwise come in directly and take advantage of it. Recover allows Latios to mitigate sand and entry hazard damage while giving it an easier time setting up and making it easier to check Keldeo, Gliscor, and Breloom. Dragon Pulse gives Latios a STAB attack that doesn't lower its stats and makes it able to sweep late-game with Calm Mind. Hidden Power Fire pressures Steel-types, notably being able to OHKO Ferrothorn and 2HKO specially defensive Jirachi after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes most of the time. However, the associated IV drop makes Latios outsped by other Latios lacking Hidden Power Fire as well as the uncommon Gengar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Draco Plate gives Draco Meteor the power boost to threaten walls with Calm Mind-boosted Draco Meteor, mainly Tyranitar, but also Pokemon like Celebi and Slowking. If Latios is running Hidden Power Fire over Recover, Lum Berry can be considered to heal off status from Pokemon like Heatran, Rotom-W, Amoonguss, and Politoed so it can set up more easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Latios mid-game to slam walls with Drao Plate- and Calm Mind-boosted Draco Meteor. Be sure to use it on the correct target to soften up the main threat for your sweeper or cleaner. Attempt to set up on switches and Pokemon that can't do much to Latios, like Gliscor and Heatran, as well as Pokemon locked into attacks Latios resists or is immune to. Try to get Latios's checks to switch in directly with the threat of Choice Specs Draco Meteor as you use Calm Mind and slam them with Draco Plate-boosted Draco Meteor. If Latios gets low on health and has Recover, use it in conjunction with Calm Mind to stay healthy before and after setting up with Latios in situations where the opportunity is presented to you. Be sure to get up entry hazards so Latios can take out the things it's meant to, mainly specially defensive Tyranitar, Heatran, and Excadrill.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Latios variant mainly fits on offensive rain teams that appreciate Tyranitar being lured in and removed from the game. As such, Politoed, mainly the defensive variant, is a very good partner that also makes it easier for Latios to come in by removing sand while bringing a backup switch-in to Water-types to lift the burden off of Latios. Starmie benefits majorly from Tyranitar being lured in and taken out early on so it can easily break holes in the opposing team without fear of being Pursuit trapped, and its ability to spin away Stealth Rock makes it easier for Latios to get on the field. Tornadus is able to more freely spam Hurricane with Tyranitar gone thanks to rain being easier to maintain while also removing items from Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Jirachi with Knock Off, and it can get Latios in safely with U-turn. Jirachi, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn can check opposing Dragon- and Steel-types and get up Stealth Rock early-game, while Latios can pressure and handle Fire-types and some Steel-types for them as well as pressure spinners. Magnezone is able to trap and remove Ferrothorn so Latios is more likely to destroy Tyranitar or another wall its teammates would like gone. It also lets Latios run Recover or Dragon Pulse as opposed to Hidden Power Fire. Other Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp appreciate Latios considerably wearing down their checks and general walls so they can sweep without much stopping them mid- and late-game. Reuniclus is able to put immense pressure on the opposing team late-game with a potential Tyranitar out of the picture. Ground-types like Garchomp and Excadrill can all pressure opposing Steel-types while also taking advantage of Latios taking out or severely weakening checks like Slowbro, Gliscor, and Skarmory for them.</p>"

  "Jirachi": {
    "overview": "<p>Jirachi's great defensive typing, good base stats, metric ton of team support, and resistance to Stealth Rock all make it a valid choice for a large variety of teams. It can run a variety of sets, from a utility set to a Choice Scarf set. Jirachi is a great check to numerous common threats, including prominent Psychic-types like Alakazam, Latios, and Reuniclus and Dragon-types like Dragonite and Kyurem-B. With its devastating paraflinch strategy using Iron Head and Thunder or Body Slam in tandem with Serene Grace, Jirachi can tear apart even the most threatening Pokemon. However, it's weak to Fire- and Ground-type attacks, which are very common, and has an extreme vulnerability to Spikes from Pokemon like Ferrothorn due to lacking instant recovery. It can also get overwhelmed by many of the Pokemon it's tasked to check, mainly the Psychic-types, which are often paired together, making its job harder.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Calm Mind + 3 Attacks Jirachi is a terror to behold, setting up frighteningly easily with its myriad of resistances and threatening balance teams. Thunder lets Jirachi spread paralysis; however, there is merit to using Jirachi with other weathers, in which case Thunderbolt is optimal. Hidden Power Ice or Icy Wind is preferred to hit Ground- and Dragon-types. Grass Knot hits Tyranitar and bulky Water-types. Psychic and Flash Cannon are Jirachi's best special STAB moves. Hidden Power Fire lets Jirachi hit opposing Steel-types outside of Heatran hard, while Hidden Power Ground hits many of the same Steel-types along with Heatran and non-Air Balloon Magnezone at the cost of losing to Ferrothorn. However, Calm Mind Jirachi doesn't have enough moveslots to cover all common threats, like Tyranitar, Heatran, and Ground-types like Excadrill, and isn't quite fast or strong enough to get the KOs you want it to get.</p> <p>A set with Substitute, Iron Head, Fire Punch, and a status-inflicting move like Toxic or Body Slam allows Jirachi to showcase its defensive, offensive, and supportive capabilities all at once. However,this set has a bad case of four-moveslot syndrome, as lacking Body Slam means faster Pokemon can be an issue and dropping Toxic makes defensive Pokemon like Jellicent easily wall it. Wish + Calm Mind can be fit on slow-paced teams to give a longevity-oriented wincon, but it is weak to Ground-types and usually takes too long to get going. Healing Wish on bulkier sets is a possibility, but getting Healing Wish off is easier with Choice Scarf. Even though Doom Desire has a turn delay, a Choice Specs set with Doom Desire hits very hard. A more offensive variant of the mixed attacking set with Expert Belt and another attack over Substitute can be used, as the extra coverage move and power boost can threaten teams that can stop Jirachi from setting up Substitute. Choice Band Jirachi can devastate slow balance teams with Iron Head flinches while still having decent coverage with Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, Fire Punch, U-turn, and Trick, but it needs a lot of team support to work and is unable to check fast Psychic-types like Latios and Alakazam.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran doesn't care about anything that Jirachi can do besides paralysis and Water Pulse because of Leftovers, its bulk, and its typing. It can then proceed to freely set up Stealth Rock, KO Jirachi with a Fire-type move, or hit a switch-in with Toxic because Jirachi switching out is so telegraphed.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Excadrill can come in on any move other than Water Pulse and KO Jirachi, but it needs to be wary of Icy Wind Jirachi + Magnet Rise Magnezone. Gastrodon and Seismitoad can wall Jirachi without Energy Ball and wear it down with a Ground-type move or a Scald burn. Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus-T can come in easily and KO Jirachi, but they need to be careful of Ice-type coverage. In addition, Garchomp and Landorus-T hate paralysis from Body Slam. Mamoswine can force Jirachi out with Earthquake, but it doesn't like taking Iron Head or Energy Ball and detests Body Slam paralysis. Hippowdon can set up Stealth Rock or KO Jirachi with Earthquake, but it doesn't like getting paralyzed from Body Slam or taking Energy Ball.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: If Magnezone isn't paired with Jirachi, Ferrothorn can easily take many hits from all Jirachi variants lacking the rare Fire Punch and set up entry hazards freely. However, Substitute + Calm Mind variants can KO it after a few turns of setting up and Substitute + 3 Attacks variants can beat a Ferrothorn that's been hit with Knock Off. Skarmory walls any Jirachi variant without Thunder and can set up entry hazards, heal, or phaze it. Magnezone itself is a tricky foe, since Jirachi can do practically nothing to it except escaping via U-turn, while Magnezone can set up Sunny Day on it and 2HKO it with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Pokemon like Tentacruel, Slowbro, Milotic, Slowking, Keldeo, and Politoed all threaten Jirachi with their rain-boosted STAB moves, especially Scald, and resist Iron Head. However, all of these Pokemon can be worn down by Thunder or Energy Ball. Rotom-W and Jellicent pose the same issues while also being more reliably able to burn Jirachi with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Volcarona can freely set up with Quiver Dance on Jirachi if it doesn't have Body Slam. Furthermore, Volcarona can run Lum Berry to mitigate Body Slam's paralysis chance. Victini threatens an immediate KO with its nuclear V-create but must avoid Body Slam paralysis. Ninetales can come in on any move bar Body Slam and threaten a 2HKO with Flamethrower or a burn with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Thundurus-T</strong>: Thundurus-T can set up Substitute in front of support Jirachi without fear because Thundurus-T's Substitute is able to take Body Slam, and it can break through Jirachi with Thunder once it paralyzes it and gets one full paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis makes Jirachi slower than Pokemon that can pick it off more easily, whereas burn reduces Jirachi's longevity and attack power.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Jirachi is a great Stealth Rock user, being almost impossible to OHKO thanks to its numerous resistances and Shuca Berry. Thunder and Icy Wind give Jirachi almost perfect neutral coverage. Thanks to the Speed drop, Icy Wind can 2HKO Landorus-T and Gliscor after Jirachi stomachs an Earthquake, as well as keeping setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragonite in check. Thunder is better than Thunderbolt due to its higher paralysis rate and higher power, letting Jirachi pressure rain Pokemon like Politoed and Tentacruel and OHKO Xatu. Energy Ball can be used to destroy Gastrodon, Seismitoad, Rotom-W, and Mamoswine. U-turn lets Jirachi escape Magnezone and pivot around Psychic-types. Iron Head is an option to use Jirachi's paraflinching ability and does more damage to Tyranitar, Reuniclus, and specially defensive Breloom than the rest of the moves on this set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Shuca Berry lets Jirachi safely set up Stealth Rock against Ground-types and, as a result, against almost every Pokemon if it's at full health. 40 Defense EVs let it survive an Earthquake from neutral natured Landorus-T. 26 Speed IVs with a Sassy nature let Jirachi underspeed standard Rotom-W for a slow U-turn, safely bringing in teammates while still outspeeding non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T after an Icy Wind Speed drop. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 160 SpA / 96 Spe can be used to outspeed Adamant Mamoswine, with a Modest nature if running Energy Ball or a Mild nature if running Iron Head. Leftovers is an option to let Jirachi more reliably check Psychic- and Dragon-types beyond the early-game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Although it is a good idea to preserve Jirachi's health against teams with many Psychic- and Dragon-types if running Iron Head, you can usually sack it as a lead early on against hyper offense or rain teams with Stealth Rock as your opening move, while Icy Wind can be used instead against Pokemon like Thundurus-T. Alternatively, Jirachi can pivot out with U-turn against Pokemon like Politoed or Tentacruel to get one of its teammates in safely. If running Energy Ball, the best way to exploit the surprise factor is is to pivot or switch out first when up against targets for Energy Ball, using it the next time Jirachi is in against its target to catch the opponent off guard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits on hyper offense structures, especially DragMag teams. Icy Wind Jirachi lures in Excadrill and allows for ally Magnezone to beat it every time, as Excadrill can no longer outspeed Magnezone and potentially flinch it with Iron Head before it gets a chance to use Magnet Rise. Jirachi also lures in Ferrothorn and Skarmory and can use U-turn to pivot into Magnezone to trap them. Since Magnezone can trap Steel-types, Dragon-types like Garchomp, Dragonite, Latios, Kyurem-B, and Salamence are good partners. Energy Ball destroys Gastrodon, Seismitoad, and Mamoswine, which Terrakion, Landorus-T, and the aforementioned Dragon-types appreciate. Water-types such as Starmie and Rotom-W can deal with Fire-types, which Jirachi struggles against. Jirachi also partners well with Pokemon immune to Spikes, like Alakazam, Dragonite, and Reuniclus, because it invites Spikers in. For the same reason, it likes Rapid Spin support from Excadrill or Starmie. Jellicent spinblocks to keep Stealth Rock up while also helping against rain teams. Technician Breloom pairs well with Jirachi on more offensive teams, and Volcarona can use Jirachi's momentum from Stealth Rock and U-turn to sweep with Quiver Dance while enjoying Jirachi damaging Water-type checks with Thunder.</p>"
      },
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Jirachi's typing and bulk let it use Wish or set up Stealth Rock pretty easily against most bulky Pokemon. Iron Head is used because of its high flinch chance and is Jirachi's strongest move against Dragon- and Psychic-type Pokemon. Body Slam hits and potentially paralyzes Ground-types and Thundurus-T, while Thunder defeats Skarmory and Jellicent. They also both sport the same paralysis chance. Protect scouts Choice-locked Pokemon like Latios and Keldeo, racks up Leftovers recovery, and lets Jirachi receive Wish safely. U-turn keeps up momentum by bringing in teammates safely so setup sweepers don't get too out of hand, and it prevents Jirachi from being trapped by Magnezone. Wish and U-turn can be used together to pass Wish to teammates more easily. Wish, U-turn, or Protect can be dropped for Stealth Rock when no other teammate can run it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>16 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Adamant Breloom, while the rest of the EVs let Jirachi check Choice Specs Latios, even in rain. An alternative spread with some Special Defense EVs moved to Defense is viable to better take on physical threats. For example, 248 HP / 84 Def / 64 SpD / 112 Spe with a Jolly nature outspeeds Adamant Kyurem-B and avoids a 2HKO from its Outrage after Leftovers recovery. A Sassy nature with 26 IVs lets Jirachi underspeed standard Rotom-W and opposing Jirachi for a slower U-turn so it can bring in its teammates more safely.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bringing Jirachi in as soon as possible to set up Stealth Rock is normally the best move. If using Wish, try to paralyze Pokemon with Body Slam or Thunder and, if given the chance, flinch foes with Iron Head. This racks up Leftovers recovery versus slower targets like Reuniclus and specially defensive Breloom while potentially preventing the former from healing with Recover, opening the door for teammates Reuniclus checks. Keep Jirachi healthy when possible so it isn't forced to Wish for itself or a teammate in an unsafe way, which can give the opponent a free turn at a particularly inopportune time.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This variant of Jirachi finds its home in more defensive weatherless and rain structures. Bulky Water-types like Rotom-W, Gastrodon, Jellicent, Seismitoad, and Milotic love Jirachi for Wish or Stealth Rock support. Jirachi hates Spikes from Pokemon such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn, and Magnezone can trap them easily, especially when Jirachi lures them in and pivots into Magnezone with U-turn. Rapid Spin from Excadrill or Tentacruel or Magic Bounce from Xatu can also prevent Spikes. Other Pokemon that can take advantage of Ferrothorn, like Breloom and Gliscor, are good teammates as well. Frailer Pokemon like Terrakion, Keldeo, and Alakazam love the slow U-turn Jirachi can provide to pivot them in safely. Offensive Dragon-types like Garchomp, Kyurem-B, and Dragonite can profit from the paralysis support Jirachi provides while enjoying it bringing them in safely and taking Dragon- and Ice-type attacks for them like Alakazam and Reuniclus's Hidden Power Ice or Latios's Draco Meteor. Jirachi can fit well on rain teams thanks to the Water-types on them taking on Fire- and Ground-types well, while Jirachi anchors them against the Psychic- and Dragon-types that usually threaten them. On rain teams, Politoed is a required partner, while Pokemon like Latios, Thundurus-T, Keldeo, and Tornadus can pair with Jirachi as well.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute lets Jirachi take advantage of passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Jellicent, and Politoed lacking Encore, punishes switches, and makes revenge killing, status moves, and Leech Seed fail at stopping Jirachi. Thunder is often preferred over Thunderbolt for its power and paralysis rate, which is further compounded by Substitute giving Jirachi multiple chances to land Thunder even when rain isn't up. However, Thunderbolt also has value due to its perfect accuracy regardless of weather and higher PP. When it comes to the last moveslot, Hidden Power Ice is usually preferred to hit Latios, Dragonite, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and specially defensive Gliscor while also KOing Ferrothorn more quickly than the alternatives and providing almost perfect neutral coverage alongside Thunder or Thunderbolt. The other option is Water Pulse on rain teams, which allows Jirachi to employ a devastating parafusion strategy while nailing Heatran, Volcarona, and Ground-types like Excadrill.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread gives Jirachi enough Speed to outrun neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon like Celebi and opposing Jirachi and enough HP to make Substitutes that survive one Seismic Toss or Night Shade. It's possible to run 252 Speed EVs to Speed tie with Salamence and Volcarona, but it's really not worth it since the bulk is crucial and outspeeding these Pokemon usually doesn't of payoff.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to keep Jirachi as healthy as possible so it can come in on Pokemon it checks like Alakazam, Ferrothorn, and Latios and set up Substitute. Be cautious about coming in directly on Pokemon that Jirachi should normally check but may have options to punish it. For example, Ferrothorn and Amoonguss can cripple Jirachi on the switch with Knock Off and Stun Spore, respectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rain support is highly recommended, as Jirachi functions much better with a perfectly accurate Thunder and Pokemon on rain teams work well with Jirachi in general. As such, Politoed, and other rain teammates like Latios, Thundurus-T, Keldeo, and Tornadus, are common partners. Entry hazards are also important to wear down foes. Defensive Landorus-T is an entry hazard setter that can check Ground-types, namely Excadrill, which is a troublesome Pokemon for Jirachi should it lack Water Pulse. Celebi can set Stealth Rock, check Ground-types, and take attacks from Water-types like Keldeo. Ferrothorn is likely the best entry hazard setter to pair with this Jirachi set, as it sets up Spikes as well as Stealth Rock. It can also use Knock Off to remove Leftovers from opposing Ferrothorn and other Steel-types, letting Jirachi win against them in the long run, and it can act as a primary Steel-type so that Jirachi doesn't get overwhelmed checking Dragon-types like Latios. It further takes on Water-types like Keldeo and Starmie. Lastly, a cleaner such as Choice Scarf Keldeo is useful to have around just in case Jirachi gets KOed before finishing its sweep; Keldeo demolishes Heatran for Jirachi while Jirachi disposes of Jellicent, Ferrothorn, and Latios, making it easier for Keldeo to spam Surf and Hydro Pump late-game.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute punishes passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Jellicent, and Politoed lacking Encore and switches while also making revenge killing, status moves, and Leech Seed fail at stopping Jirachi. Iron Head can flinch foes while doing a lot of damage to Tyranitar, Mamoswine, Kyurem-B, Latios, Reuniclus, and Alakazam. Thunder hits bulky Water-types like Jellicent, Politoed, Slowking, and Skarmory while having good odds to inflict paralysis, which can combine with Iron Head flinches and Substitute to let Leftovers heal Jirachi more, putting it in a very good position to ravage the opposing team. Thunderbolt is more reliable if using Jirachi outside of rain; however, it lacks Thunder's power and paralysis chance, making it worse even outside rain teams a majority of the time. When it comes to the last moveslot, Hidden Power Ice 2HKOes Landorus-T, Garchomp, and specially defensive Gliscor. Icy Wind is similarly strong and also reduces Speed, helping with Pokemon like Alakazam, Latios, and Dragonite; however, it has imperfect accuracy and fails to 2HKO specially defensive Gliscor after Poison Heal recovery. Water Pulse is also a good option on rain teams to 3HKO Excadrill, Volcarona, and Heatran while adding confusion to paralysis and flinching to further debilitate foes. It also still hits Landorus-T and Gliscor hard in rain.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP EVs are for 101 HP Substitutes, which one Night Shade or Seismic Toss from Jellicent or Xatu does not break. 184 Speed EVs make Jirachi outspeed Jolly Landorus-T. Leftovers helps Jirachi recover health after using Substitute.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to keep Jirachi as healthy as possible so it can come in on Pokemon it checks and set up Substitute. However, be cautious about coming in directly on Pokemon Jirachi checks, as they may have options to punish it. For example, Ferrothorn and Amoonguss can cripple Jirachi on the switch with Knock Off and Stun Spore, respectively. Set up Substitute when given a free turn or on Pokemon that offensive Jirachi naturally beats, like Jellicent, so it can spread status more easily and wear down the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Jirachi is great on rain and weatherless teams for its ability to perform well against sand teams while being tough to KO thanks to Substitute and its bulk. Rain support from Politoed is helpful to negate Jirachi's Fire weakness and enhance the power of Water Pulse. In return, Jirachi is a great switch-in to opposing Dragon-types such as Latios. Magnezone or Knock Off users like Ferrothorn are needed to deal with opposing Ferrothorn and Excadrill, which completely wall this set. Entry hazards from Pokemon like Ferrothorn help Jirachi further punish the switches it forces. It can also use Knock Off to remove Leftovers from opposing Ferrothorn and other Steel-types, making Jirachi win against them in the long run while acting as a primary Steel-type so that Jirachi doesn't get overwhelmed by checking Dragon-types like Latios and powerful Water-types like Starmie. Pokemon such as Latios and Thundurus-T are immune to Ground-type moves, while Jirachi can check opposing Dragon-types for Latios. Breloom takes on Ground-types for Jirachi, while Jirachi takes on Ice-, Flying-, and Psychic-types and counters Poison-types for Breloom. Since this set can't defeat Gastrodon if it is not statused, Toxic Spikes, Toxic, or Will-O-Wisp users like Tentacruel and Rotom-W are appreciated to wear it down.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Iron Head's high flinch rate allows Jirachi to flinch its way past numerous Pokemon and is very useful for picking off weakened foes. U-turn allows Jirachi to escape Magnet Pull, bring in teammates safely, and scout. Ice Punch hits setup sweepers like Dragonite, Garchomp, and Gliscor for super effective damage. Trick can not only cripple walls, most notably Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and bulky Water-types such as Jellicent, but also messes up sweepers such as Volcarona and offensive Trick Room Reuniclus if it's used as they set up. Healing Wish makes Jirachi an amazing support Pokemon; once it has outlived its usefulness, it can bring in a fully-healed teammate freely. Two other attacks can be run, namely Thunder Punch to hit Water-types, most notably Gyarados, and Zen Headbutt for Keldeo and Tentacruel, which also has a good chance to flinch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>184 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature makes Jirachi faster than Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Reducing the Speed investment to 96 EVs to outspeed +1 Dragonite frees up EVs for more bulk. One can even run a Careful nature to provide a reliable Alakazam answer for weatherless teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is particularly good at revenge killing Dragon-types because Jirachi is much bulkier than other Choice Scarf users like Latios and Keldeo, and it has numerous resistances, which allows it to switch into a large number of attacks at least once. This set's biggest flaw is its lack of power, which leaves it easily walled and set up on. If Jirachi is your team's only insurance for fast threats, be careful when using Trick, as it can leave you weak to setup sweepers like Dragonite or hard-hitting Pokemon like Latios.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive Flying-types like Landorus-T, Skarmory, and Gliscor are very good options to cover Jirachi's Ground weakness, and they set entry hazards to help Jirachi wear down its switch-ins, given the many switches it forces. Latios can capitalize on the offensive momentum Jirachi generates, check Gliscor, Rotom-W, and Keldeo for Jirachi, and bust holes in other walls that could potentially halt a Jirachi sweep from it. In return, Jirachi is able to revenge kill Tyranitar, which troubles Latios. If Healing Wish is used, Pokemon that can synergize well with Jirachi in general like Garchomp, Terrakion, and Volcarona are excellent recipients of it. Pokemon like Alakazam, Kyurem-B, and Reuniclus can capitalize on the momentum gained by U-turn.</p>"

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon holds an important niche in BW OU as one of the most reliable counters to offensive rain teams. Not only does its ability Storm Drain grant it a Water immunity, but its typing makes it one of the most reliable defensive checks to Rotom-W and Thundurus-T, provided that the latter isn't running Grass Knot. Gastrodon is also deceptively difficult to switch into, as most Pokemon that can reliably switch into Scald are ruined by Toxic. Gastrodon can also check physical attackers like Tyranitar and Gliscor. Finally, Recover and immunity to sand give it an easy time staying healthy to check the Pokemon it is supposed to. With these traits, Gastrodon is often used on sand teams that need a reliable answer to offensive rain teams. However, Gastrodon is very passive, meaning that Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Breloom can freely switch in and use it as setup fodder. Gastrodon's susceptibility to entry hazards is also problematic, preventing it from checking very strong physical attackers such as Dragonite. Its vulnerability to Toxic also hurts against Pokemon it can otherwise check that run the move, like Heatran and Keldeo. Finally, Gastrodon faces significant competition as an answer to rain teams with Jellicent and Seismitoad, as the former can better check Keldeo, spinblocks, and has a better matchup against Ferrothorn, while the latter does a better job checking Rotom-W with its access to Refresh and better supports its team, able to run Stealth Rock and Knock Off.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive variant can be used under rain, but Gastrodon's middling coverage and lack of power without a boost from Storm Drain makes this option very fringe. Clear Smog can be useful to completely blank setup attempts from Reuniclus and Latias. Substitute with 220 Speed EVs lets Gastrodon evade Toxic from defensive Politoed, which can't break the Substitute due to only running Scald as an attacking move. However, this is situational, and Politoed often runs Encore, making Substitute easily punishable. Protect can be useful to scout Choice-locked Pokemon and rack up Leftovers recovery. Since Gastrodon often takes on both physical and special attackers, Counter or Mirror Coat can be run to let it lure in attackers and take them out.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: While it has to be wary of Scald burns, Ferrothorn can freely switch into Gastrodon and either set entry hazards up, remove its Leftovers with Knock Off, or KO it with Power Whip. Likewise, Breloom can switch into Scald if Toxic Orb was activated beforehand and force Gastrodon out, though it has to be wary of Ice Beam. Celebi can cure itself of status if it takes Scald or Toxic on the switch thanks to Natural Cure, takes minimal damage from Ice Beam, uses Gastrodon as an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock, and forces it out. Gastrodon also fears Grass-type coverage from Pokemon like Thundurus-T, Alakazam, and Keldeo.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Gastrodon is susceptible to entry hazards, mainly Spikes, as well as status. It's particularly vulnerable to status given that the Pokemon it's meant to check, like Heatran, Rotom-W, and Tentacruel, often run Toxic or Will-O-Wisp, which cripple its longevity.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Faster threats such as Garchomp, Terrakion, Latios, and Kyurem-B can KO a weakened Gastrodon or force it out. Even Pokemon it should check, like Thundurus-T, can potentially muscle through Gastrodon with setup. However, all of these Pokemon must be careful when switching in due to Scald burns and Toxic crippling them.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Bulky setup sweepers like Calm Mind Reuniclus, Substitute + Calm Mind Latias, Calm Mind Jirachi, Swords Dance Gliscor, and Substitute + Dragon Dance Dragonite may get easy setup on Gastrodon, depending on its third moveslot attack, due to their ability to nullify Toxic and take Scald.</p>",

Tyranitar Pursuit traps Psychic-types like Alakazam and Reuniclus and sets sand up. Gastrodon particularly appreciates sand, which wears down Gastrodon's foes while it regains health. Skarmory can answer physical attackers like Dragonite, Excadrill, and Garchomp and Psychic-types like Latios and Alakazam, as well as setting up Spikes, while Gastrodon answers Pokemon like Keldeo and Thundurus-T for it. Ferrothorn is able to check Dragon-types, like Latios and Dragonite lacking Fire Punch, and spread residual damage with Knock Off and entry hazards. Gliscor is great to set Stealth Rock, remove Leftovers with Knock Off to give Gastrodon's Scald and Toxic more sticking power, and check very strong physical attackers like Garchomp and Terrakion. Alakazam and Reuniclus are fantastic partners, since they appreciate the residual damage and defensive backbone Gastrodon provides, with Alakazam doing excellent against the offensive teams Gastrodon can struggle against, while Reuniclus can act as a very potent wincon. A spinner like Excadrill is important, since entry hazards can easily put Gastrodon into 2HKO range of moves like Keldeo's Secret Sword, and Excadrill appreciates Gastrodon checking common rain Pokemon. Magnezone helps stop hazards by trapping Skarmory and Ferrothorn, preventing multiple layers of Spikes from going up. Heatran counters Grass-types like Celebi and Ferrothorn, spreads burns with Lava Plume, traps Pokemon with Magma Storm, and sets up Stealth Rock while appreciating Gastrodon answering Water-types. Celebi is a strong Keldeo and Tentacruel check and can absorb status for Gastrodon, while Gastrodon can reliably cover Thundurus-T.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Bronzong stands out from other Steel-types thanks to its immunity to Ground-type attacks, high bulk, nice defensive typing, and resistance to Ice-type moves. These valuable traits let it check Mamoswine, Landorus-T, Latios, Alakazam, and Earthquake Dragonite. Bronzong's defensive utility is further enhanced by its immunity to Spikes, Toxic, and sand, as well as its resistance to Stealth Rock, making it hard to wear Bronzong down through residual damage.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Bronzong lacks reliable recovery, making it vulnerable to repeated attacks. Bronzong also competes fiercely with Ferrothorn and Skarmory. Ferrothorn is able to set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes. In addition, it also checks Water-types and Latios. Skarmory also checks Ground-types and can set Spikes, and it importantly has reliable recovery in the form of Roost, giving it better longevity than Bronzong.</p>",

      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>Bronzong can reliably set Stealth Rock up using its great defenses and numerous switch-in opportunities. Gyro Ball is the STAB move of choice here thanks to Bronzong's poor Speed and usable base 89 Attack stat, allowing it do decent damage to Latios, Gengar, and Kyurem. Hidden Power Ice 2HKOes Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T. Earthquake allows Bronzong to smack incoming Heatran and Magnezone while making it actually able to take on Excadrill. Toxic is also usable to cripple Rotom-W, Keldeo, Thundurus-T, Jellicent, Slowbro, and many others.</p> <p>168 EVs Defense EVs allow Bronzong to take physical onslaughts much better, particularly Outrage from Dragonite, Kyurem-B, and Garchomp. The remaining EVs are invested into Special Defense to give great overall bulk. 104 Attack EVs can be invested if there is a need to OHKO Heatran, Gengar, and Terrakion. A Sassy nature is chosen here to not only provide extra Special Defense, but in order to give in minimum Speed to utilize Gyro Ball effectively. The 0 IVs in Speed serve the same purpose. 2 Speed IVs may be used to enhance the power of Hidden Power Ice, but the extra power is often not necessary and additional Gyro Ball power is more appreciated as it is the attack Bronzong will be using most often. Trick Room is usable on this set due to Bronzong's low Speed and can be used for further support. Additionally, Explosion can be used to safely send a teammate in while dealing as much damage as possible.</p>"

  "Garchomp": {
    "overview": "<p>Garchomp is a prominent Pokemon due to its fantastic typing, great offenses and Speed, good set versatility, and ability to fit on many teams. Garchomp's typing is superb offensively, threatening the entire metagame with its STAB moves aside from Skarmory and Bronzong. Defensively it is also very capable, commonly switching in on Tyranitar, defensive Heatran, and Thunder from Pokemon like Thundurus-T and Jirachi. Its moves have high Base Power, and it outspeeds common offensive Pokemon like Excadrill, Thundurus-T, Volcarona, Heatran, Kyurem-B, and Dragonite. This high Speed also makes Garchomp an effective Choice Scarf user, since it can revenge kill common set up sweepers like Volcarona, Dragonite, and Salamence at +1 and faster threats like Latios, Keldeo, and Alakazam. It can also be a Stealth Rock lead for hyper offense teams, a Swords Dance wallbreaker, and even a mixed attacker to break through checks to its physical sets like Gliscor and Landorus-T. These sets all differ in counterplay, making Garchomp difficult to play around. However, Garchomp can be handled offensively by a myriad of faster threats, including Latios, Alakazam, Keldeo, Terrakion, and Starmie, alongside powerful priority users like Scizor, Dragonite, and Breloom. Some Steel- and Ground-types like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Landorus-T, and Gliscor can check it defensively, with many other miscellaneous Pokemon like Politoed, Jellicent, Gastrodon, and Reuniclus surviving at least one hit to punish it with status or super effective coverage. Also, while its sets may differ in counterplay to a certain degree, most teams will be able to play around Garchomp because its offensive and defensive checks naturally fit well together.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band may seem like a good option for more immediate wallbreaking and Garchomp's nearly unresisted STAB combination. However, Swords Dance sets are better wallbreakers because they can switch moves and too many common Pokemon are immune to Earthquake. Haban Berry on the Swords Dance set can be used to take powerful Dragon-type moves from Choice Scarf Latios and opposing Garchomp, letting it more reliably revenge kill them. However, Yache Berry and Lum Berry are more consistently useful. A bulky Rocky Helmet set can generate a ton of residual damage between Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin and set Stealth Rock. However, bulky Garchomp is outclassed by Landorus-T and Gliscor, which are much bulkier, immune to Spikes and Ground-type moves, and provide more team support with Intimidate and Knock Off, respectively. Fling can be used over Rock Slide with Choice Scarf for matchups where being able to switch moves is more valuable. Toxic can also be used over Rock Slide on that set to cripple bulky Pokemon like Landorus-T, Jellicent, and Politoed on the switch, while Sandstorm instead lets weatherless teams remove rain and sun, giving much more leeway to play around them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon that can hit Garchomp super effectively, like Latios, Alakazam, Keldeo, Mamoswine, Starmie, and Terrakion, all force it out. Keldeo and Latios can also run Choice Scarf to even outspeed Choice Scarf and Salac Berry variants, with Mamoswine functioning similarly via Ice Shard. However, these Pokemon struggle to switch in safely, and Yache Berry can mitigate the threat of Alakazam, Keldeo outside of rain, and Mamoswine. Focus Sash variants match up better against all of these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulkier Pokemon like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Slowbro, and Reuniclus can take at least one of Garchomp's hits from full health, even after a Swords Dance, and hit it back with Ice-type coverage. However, they are worn down significantly by Draco Meteor and Swords Dance-boosted Outrage.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn makes Garchomp unable to achieve anything significant offensively. Poison puts it on a timer and makes it unable to switch into Pokemon like Heatran safely.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory stonewalls Swords Dance sets and can set up Spikes, heal off their hits with Roost, and phaze them. However, it can be taken out by +2 Aqua Tail in rain, Fire Blast from the mixed set, and Garchomp's common teammate Magnezone.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Slide lets Garchomp more consistently revenge kill Volcarona, while Stone Edge can revenge kill it and OHKO Thundurus-T after Stealth Rock in exchange for worse accuracy. Stealth Rock instead makes Garchomp a secondary setter for offensive teams that need Stealth Rock up at all times or sand teams that want Tyranitar to more easily check Latios, Reuniclus, and Thundurus-T instead of needing to set Stealth Rock every game. Garchomp also lets Stealth Rock go up early-game against Taunt leads like Aerodactyl, Terrakion, and Skarmory, which is really crucial if the opponent has a Volcarona or Dragonite. However, these niches usually aren't needed. Dual Chop can break through Substitute and do damage in one turn while also KOing Focus Sash Alakazam in one turn, letting Garchomp revenge kill one of the most difficult foes for offensive teams. Dragon Claw is an alternative that has perfect accuracy and only makes Garchomp take Iron Barbs damage from Ferrothorn once. However, these benefits are not worth it most of the time.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is preferred over Adamant to outspeed faster sweepers like boosted Volcarona and Choice Scarf Jirachi.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits well on DragMag teams due to Magnezone trapping Steel-types like Skarmory and Ferrothorn and the other Dragon-types wallbreaking, which lets Garchomp more easily sweep; in return, it keeps opposing hyper offense teams under control. Jirachi sets up Stealth Rock so Garchomp is harder to switch into while also safely pivoting it in with U-turn. It can also take Dragon- and Ice-type moves from Pokemon like Latios, Alakazam, and Reuniclus. Powerful Dragon-type wallbreakers like Choice Specs Latios, Choice Band Dragonite, and Choice Band Kyurem-B can break the opposing team open with their powerful Dragon-type STAB moves so Garchomp can more easily sweep. Choice Scarf variants of Latios provide more of a safety net against offensive teams so Garchomp isn't overwhelmed trying to keep them under control. Dragon Dance Dragonite and Salamence can focus more on wallbreaking rather than needing to sweep every game thanks to Garchomp finishing teams off if they can't, with Dragonite even being able to provide priority as further insurance against offensive teams. Offensive Starmie wears down Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Politoed, and Jellicent so Garchomp can more easily break through them, and it keeps entry hazards off the field so Garchomp can better take a hit from setup sweepers like Volcarona in a pinch.</p> <p>This set can also work on sand teams because they enjoy it revenge killing Pokemon they struggle against, like Volcarona, as well as breaking Alakazam's Focus Sash with Dual Chop. Garchomp, in turn, enjoys support from Pokemon like Tyranitar, which Pursuit traps Reuniclus, Latios, and Jellicent, Pokemon that can set up on, force out, and cripple it. Tyranitar also sets sand and can set up Stealth Rock with a Chople Berry set. Magnezone traps Steel-types like Skarmory and Ferrothorn so other sand teams can't pivot against it as easily. Ferrothorn, on the other hand, switches into Dragon-types like Latios and Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Superpower, as well as Water-types like Starmie and Politoed. Ferrothorn also provides Stealth Rock and Spikes and appreciates Garchomp revenge killing Pokemon that can set up on it, like Volcarona and Dragonite. Latios switches into Water- and Grass-types like Keldeo, Politoed, and Breloom and can wear down Ground-type pivots like Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W. Garchomp threatens Tyranitar and Steel-types like Jirachi and Heatran in return. Focus Sash Alakazam provides more insurance against offensive teams and takes out and wears down checks like Gliscor, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-T so Garchomp can sweep. Reuniclus acts as a good wincon against the bulkier teams Garchomp struggles against, switches into Gliscor and Breloom, and enjoys Garchomp's good matchup against offensive teams and Tyranitar. Gliscor has an easier time switching in against numerous foes, ensuring Garchomp doesn't get overwhelmed. It can come in on Excadrill, Jellicent, and opposing physical Garchomp and set Stealth Rock. Rotom-W is able to bring Garchomp in safely with Volt Switch, check Ground- and Water-types like Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Keldeo, and burn foes to put them on a timer. Swords Dance Landorus-T can break open walls like Skarmory and Gliscor so Garchomp can more easily sweep.</p>"

      "Stealth Rock Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Garchomp is a great Stealth Rock setter thanks to having high Speed, having a good matchup against other common leads like Jirachi, and threatening the most common spinners in Excadrill and Starmie with its powerful STAB moves. Outrage's high power threatens many Pokemon Garchomp would like to wear down as it sacrifices itself for early damage, like Starmie, Breloom, Rotom-W, Reuniclus, and Landorus-T. Swords Dance lets Garchomp get off an even stronger hit before going down should it get a free turn after setting Stealth Rock, hard punishing the aforementioned targets and Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Jirachi.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is preferred over Adamant to outspeed Volcarona, Thundurus-T, positive-natured Jirachi, and Jolly Landorus-T. Focus Sash guarantees Garchomp can get Stealth Rock up against any target, and it often gives an opportunity to attack slower targets that bring it down to 1 HP. Yache Berry, on the other hand, gives Garchomp two turns to move against lead Icy Wind Jirachi. It also gives Garchomp some mid-game utility to threaten attackers like Starmie and Thundurus-T should it be preserved.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits well on DragMag teams due to it getting Stealth Rock up quickly and doing a lot of damage as it goes down. Magnezone is a key member of this teamstyle, as it traps Steel-types like Skarmory and Ferrothorn. Dragon-type wallbreakers like Choice Specs Latios, Choice Band Dragonite, and Choice Band Kyurem-B enjoy having Stealth Rock up, as do Dragon Dance Dragonite and Salamence. Choice Scarf Latios and Salamence can more easily sweep with the holes Garchomp breaks early on and the Stealth Rock it sets. Jirachi can run a more specially defensive set thanks to Garchomp getting Stealth Rock up, serving as a momentum-grabbing special wall to Dragon- and Ice-type moves from Pokemon like Latios, Alakazam, and Reuniclus. Offensive Starmie more easily wears down and takes out Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Politoed, Latios, and Jellicent with Stealth Rock support, as well as appreciating Garchomp wearing down the opposing team.</p> <p>This set can also work on less centralized hyper offense teams for much of the same reasons it does on DragMag teams. Dragon Dance Dragonite sweeps more easily thanks to being able to break through bulky targets like Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Gliscor with Stealth Rock up, as well as revenge killing faster threats with Extreme Speed more easily. Stealth Rock lets Volcarona break through bulkier Pokemon that could otherwise take a hit from it, like Tyranitar, Politoed, and Gastrodon, and it can benefit from Garchomp directly wearing down these same Pokemon. Offensive Starmie better wears down and takes out Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Politoed, Latios, and Jellicent with Stealth Rock support. Swords Dance Scizor benefits from Garchomp forcing in Dragon-types and Alakazam to revenge kill it since it can set up on them while enjoying its Bullet Punch better KOing Pokemon like Volcarona, Dragonite, and opposing Garchomp, letting it easily sweep the offensive teams that'd otherwise check it. Offensive Breloom can 2HKO Pokemon like Dragonite and Thundurus-T with Stealth Rock and more easily revenge kill threats with Mach Punch. It also enjoys Garchomp chipping threats like Reuniclus and Landorus-T for it.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Outrage is extremely powerful after a boost, 2HKOing physically defensive Gliscor and Landorus-T from full health while OHKOing Rotom-W, Politoed, and Gastrodon after Stealth Rock. It's also quite powerful even unboosted, pressuring and wearing down targets like Reuniclus, Celebi, and Politoed well for teammates. Dragon Claw can be used over or with Outrage for a drawback-free Dragon-type move. It works best with Substitute since having a reliable STAB move against Earthquake switch-ins late-game is more important than Outrage's power a lot of the time. Dual Chop performs similarly while also breaking past Substitutes and KOing Focus Sash Alakazam in one turn, which is even more effective if it's running Yache Berry or has gotten a Speed boost from Salac Berry. However, its imperfect accuracy and greater self-damage against Iron Barbs make it inferior to Dragon Claw most of the time. Substitute can be used in tandem with Salac Berry to punish the many switches Garchomp forces, give it safe setup opportunities, and sweep late-game by outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame with a Salac Berry boost. Aqua Tail can be used on rain teams to slam Landorus-T and Gliscor and 2HKO Skarmory after a Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is preferred over Adamant to outspeed Landorus-T, Volcarona, and Thundurus-T. Yache Berry lets Garchomp more comfortably take out Pokemon like Mamoswine, Thundurus-T, Starmie, Keldeo, Slowbro, Reuniclus, boosted Volcarona, and Landorus-T, as well as Alakazam if running Dual Chop. Lum Berry can be used to set up comfortably on Pokemon that may try to status it, like Rotom-W, Jellicent, and Politoed, as well as curing confusion inflicted from Outrage. Salac Berry can be used with Substitute and 30 HP IVs to activate Salac Berry after three Substitutes. Salac Berry Garchomp should only be used on Magnezone teams, however.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits well on DragMag teams due to Magnezone trapping Steel-types like Skarmory and Ferrothron and it wallbreaking with other Dragon-types to open up a sweep late-game, or other Dragon-types wallbreaking for it to sweep if it's the Substitute + Salac Berry set. Jirachi sets up Stealth Rock so Garchomp is harder to switch into while also safely pivoting it in with U-turn. It can also take Dragon- and Ice-type moves from Pokemon like Latios, Alakazam, and Reuniclus. Powerful Dragon-type wallbreakers like Choice Band Dragonite and Choice Band Kyurem-B help Garchomp sweep and wallbreak. Choice Scarf Latios and Salamence can support the Salac Berry variant by dealing with opposing offensive teams. They also enjoy Garchomp's wallbreaking, as do Dragon Dance Dragonite and Salamence, and they too help Salac Berry sweep. Dragonite even provides priority as insurance against offensive teams. Offensive Starmie wears down Pokemon like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, Politoed, and Jellicent for Garchomp and keeps entry hazards off the field to let Salac Berry sets more safely activate their item.</p> <p>This set also fits well on rain teams because it wallbreaks for many rain sweepers, helping them pivot around opposing Thundurus-T, and gaining a stronger Aqua Tail. Politoed brings rain, takes Water- and Ice-type attacks from Pokemon like Keldeo and Alakazam, and burns potential switch-ins like Slowbro and Ferrothorn with Scald. Garchomp threatens Tyranitar, aiding its team in winning the weather war, and other problematic Pokemon for rain teams, like Tentacruel, Jellicent, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W. Choice Scarf Keldeo can easily sweep after Garchomp bashes its checks and better handles offensive teams, which non-Salac Berry Garchomp can struggle against. Substitute + Agility Thundurus-T appreciates Garchomp breaking through its checks, like Gastrodon, Celebi, and Tyranitar, while sweeping offensive teams for it. Choice Scarf Latios can check Keldeo and outspeed other offensive Pokemon like Alakazam and boosted Dragonite that can give Garchomp a hard time. It also benefits from Garchomp breaking through bulky Pokemon like Tyranitar and Gastrodon so it can sweep more easily late-game.</p>"

Outrage can be used with Life Orb and another Stealth Rock setter to KO Pokemon like Gastrodon, physically defensive Politoed, Rotom-W, and Celebi after using Draco Meteor. Instead, Hidden Power Ice can be run to OHKO Landorus-T and Gliscor outright for teammates that really need them removed. Fire Blast OHKOes Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Magnezone.

A Hasty nature is preferred over Naive to let Garchomp survive at least one Ice-type attack from weaker Pokemon like Gastrodon and Reuniclus, as well as improving its chances to survive attacks from Pokemon like Volcarona, Politoed, and Rotom-W. On the other hand, a Naive nature can be used to take Gliscor's and Excadrill's Earthquakes better and have better odds to avoid an OHKO from Choice Band Terrakion's Close Combat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set best fits on sand teams due to it breaking through common threats with good sand matchups like Gliscor, Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-T while letting sand wear down its switch-ins. Tyranitar is needed on sand teams a majority of the time, with Chople Berry sets enjoying Garchomp handling Stealth Rock, while Garchomp appreciates it Pursuit trapping checks like Latios, Alakazam, and Hidden Power Ice Reuniclus. In return, Garchomp can pressure Politoed and Ferrothorn and check offensive Pokemon like Volcarona and Thundurus-T. Rotom-W can switch into Ground-type attacks and burn potential checks like Amoonguss and Politoed, so Garchomp can more easily break through them while also pivoting it in safely with Volt Switch on targets like Ferrothorn. Heatran can wear down and trap bulky Pokemon that Garchomp can't OHKO like Reuniclus with Magma Storm and check Grass-types. Garchomp can set up Stealth Rock and take out Ground-types like Excadrill, Gliscor, and Landorus-T that can check Heatran. Ferrothorn switches into Dragon-types like Latios and Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Superpower, as well as Water-types like Starmie and Politoed. It also provides entry hazard and Knock Off support, and it appreciates Garchomp checking Fire-types like Heatran and Volcarona. Finally, physical attackers that struggle with Draco Meteor's targets, like Terrakion and Swords Dance Landorus-T, work well with this set.</p> <p>This set also fits well on rain teams thanks to it wallbreaking for many rain sweepers and pivoting around opposing Thundurus-T. Politoed brings rain, takes Water- and Ice-type attacks from Pokemon like Keldeo and Alakazam, and burns Pokemon that can potentially switch into Garchomp like Celebi and Ferrothorn with Scald. Garchomp threatens Tyranitar, aiding its team in the weather war, and other problematic Pokemon for rain, like Tentacruel, Jellicent, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W. Choice Scarf Keldeo can more easily sweep once Garchomp wears down its checks and better handles offensive teams, which Garchomp can struggle against. Substitute + Agility Thundurus-T appreciates Garchomp wearing down checks to it, like Gastrodon, Celebi, and Tyranitar, while it can sweep through offensive teams. Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi is a good wincon that benefits from Garchomp wearing down its checks and can take Dragon- and Ice-type moves from Pokemon like Latios and Alakazam. Choice Scarf Latios can check Keldeo and outspeed other offensive Pokemon like Alakazam and boosted Dragonite which can give Garchomp a hard time while benefitting from it breaking through bulky Pokemon like Tyranitar and Gastrodon to sweep late-game.</p>"

It struggles to set up Swords Dance at all because of its defensive worthlessness and inability to force switches against many offensive staples and common defensive Pokemon, like Tentacruel, Gliscor, and Reuniclus. It's wholly outclassed by other Fighting-types like Keldeo, Breloom, and Terrakion, due to them all having more power, Speed, defensive utility, set versatility, and compatible team structures.</p>",

Aside from being a useful asset in weather wars, Hippowdon is a capable mixed wall, capable of checking common threats like Volcarona, Magnezone, and Alakazam and Thundurus-T lacking Grass Knot with a specially defensive set that still answers Excadrill, Terrakion, Tyranitar, and Garchomp. It's also a solid Stealth Rock setter thanks to its ability to threaten Excadrill and Tentacruel. This defensive profile and better longevity makes Hippowdon a decent alternative sand setter over Tyranitar for bulkier sand teams that can handle Psychic-types in other ways. However, Hippowdon is much more passive than Tyranitar, and being unable to significantly threaten Psychic-types like Reuniclus and Latios significantly hinders it in most matches. It's also quite slow and will need to take two hits when switching in before it gets a chance to do anything, limiting the amount of switch-in opportunities it gets. It's forced out and set up on by common Pokemon like Latios, Reuniclus, Breloom, and Keldeo due to its common weaknesses and aforementioned passivity. It also faces stiff competition from Pokemon like Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Gastrodon, who all have secondary typings that let them check larger portions of the metagame while Gliscor and Landorus-T are also immune to Spikes.</p>",

Whirlwind lets Hippowdon phase out setup sweepers like Dragonite, Latias, and Scizor, giving it utility against hyper offense. Toxic is useful for crippling Rotom-W, Jellicent, and Latios, all of which are common switch-ins to Hippowdon. However, other common switch-ins, like Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Gliscor are uneffected by it while Refresh Politoed can heal it off.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given spread lets Hippowdon survive a Swords Dance-boosted Close Combat from Terrakion after Stealth Rock while handling Pokemon like Volcarona, Alakazam, Garchomp, and Excadrill. An altnerative EV spread of 252 HP / 80 Def / 172 SpD and an Impish nature can be used to avoid the 2HKO from Excadrill's Sand Force-boosted Earthquake after Stealth Rock. However, this makes Hippowdon worse against the myriad of special threats it can check with more Special Defense investment.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hippowdon works on bulky sand teams that need threats like Terrakion to be checked. Ferrothorn and Skarmory set Spikes to accompany Hippowdon's Stealth Rock. Skarmory acts as a sturdier check to physical attackers like Dragonite lacking Fire Punch, Landorus-T, and Scizor. Ferrothorn, on the other hand, switches into Dragon-types like Latios and Kyurem-B and Water-types like Starmie and Politoed. Meanwhile, Hippowdon switches in easily against Alakazam lacking Grass Knot and Terrakion. Excadrill can take advantage of Sand Force, keeps entry hazards off the field to improve Hippowdon's longevity, pressures Reuniclus, and checks Dragon-types while appreciating Hippowdon countering Ground-types like opposing Excadrill and Landorus-T. Psychic-types like Alakazam, Latios, and Reuniclus appreciate Stealth Rock wearing down their switch-ins. Focus Sash Alakazam can revenge kill any Pokemon and punish Pokemon that try to set up on Hippowdon, mainly Reuniclus, with Encore and Thunder Wave. Latios switches into Water-, Grass-, and Electric-types like Keldeo, Celebi, and Thundurus-T while bringing sweeping potential with a Choice Scarf set, which revenge kills and cripples Pokemon like Reuniclus. Reuniclus appreciates its switch-ins being worn down so it can sweep with Calm Mind and more easily wallbreak if running its three attacks set. Magnezone traps Skarmory and Ferrothorn, which could otherwise wall and set up Spikes against Hippowdon, while benefitting from Hippowdon checking Terrakion. Jellicent can take on strong special attackers like Volcarona, Politoed, and Keldeo while spreading more residual damage with Will-O-Wisp and stopping recovery with Taunt. Hippowdon checks strong physical threats like Terrakion, Garchomp, and Excadrill in return. Rotom-W checks Water- and Ice-types like Starmie, Keldeo, and Mamoswine and spreads burns with Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

  "Toxicroak": {
    "overview": "<p>Toxicroak is a Pokemon designed to function well on rain teams. It takes no damage from Water-type attacks, has passive recovery under rain, and access to Swords Dance and good coverage options, allowing it to check or bust through many Pokemon that rain teams struggle against such as Ferrothorn, Chansey, Tentacruel, Keldeo, and Breloom. However, other than its Attack, Toxicroak has poor stats and it relies a lot on rain to be useful. Depending on the set it runs, Toxicroak is also walled by common OU Pokemon such as Jellicent, Hippowdon, and Skarmory. At the end of the day, Toxicroak is a decent Pokemon for rain teams that helps them overcome some of their most common weaknesses, and even though it has some significant flaws, its positive traits make up for them with the right support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bulk Up lets Toxicroak boost its Attack while also becoming harder to break on the physical side. However, it takes too long to become strong enough to properly wallbreak, leaving it outclassed by Swords Dance a majority of the time. A SubPunch set can be used since Toxicroak can set up Substitute against Pokemon like Tentacruel and Ferrothorn and hit hard while healing. Toxicroak has access to Nasty Plot and Vacuum Wave, allowing it to use a special set to decent success, but Toxicroak's low Special Attack makes such a set have few merits outside of the surprise factor. Work Up is another option, if only for hitting with both physical and special priority, but it is a gimmick at best; Swords Dance is better for wallbreaking anyway. Cross Chop is an option that allows Toxicroak to OHKO 252 HP Jirachi after a boost, preventing it from paralyzing Toxicroak; unfortunately, the lowered accuracy is a letdown. Toxicroak can take advantage of its second STAB by using Poison Jab, which allows it to hit Pokemon such as Celebi, Gyarados, and Volcarona for better damage than with any other move, but it leaves Toxicroak helpless against the numerous Ground-types that are found in OU. Although situational, Toxic can cripple quite a few of Toxicroak's checks and counters, namely Jellicent, Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon, making it a decent option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Gliscor, Hippowdon, Garchomp, and Landorus-T can all take Toxicroak's Drain Punch and OHKO it with Earthquake. However, Gliscor and Landorus-T are OHKOed by Ice Punch after a boost.</p> <p><strong>Jellicent</strong>: Jellicent takes any attack from Toxicroak without issue and can neuter it with Will-O-Wisp and is able to damage it with Night Shade.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Reuniclus, Slowbro, and Skarmory can all take Toxicroak's attacks, even after a boost, and OHKO it or status it. However, they need to be healthy to take its hits.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Latios, Kyurem-B, Alakazam, Excadrill, Volcarona, and Thundurus-T can all outspeed and OHKO Toxicroak with their powerful attacks. However, most of these Pokemon can be taken out by a boosted Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sucker Punch complements Drain Punch nicely, providing almost unresisted neutral coverage, good Base Power, and priority, preventing Toxicroak from getting revenge killed by faster threats, including Latios, Starmie, and Alakazam. Ice Punch covers the few threats that the other attacking moves don't, maiming Gliscor, Landorus-T, Garchomp, Dragonite, and Hippowdon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Speed EVs allow Toxicroak to outspeed Jolly Breloom, and the rest are thrown into Attack and HP. An Adamant nature is usually the better option, as both Toxicroak's Attack stat and the Base Power of its STAB move leaves something to be desired, and Sucker Punch helps against many faster Pokemon anyway. However, with a Jolly nature, Toxicroak outspeeds Jolly Mamoswine and Timid Heatran, both of which are important targets that could otherwise OHKO Toxicroak.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Toxicroak should always be used on rain teams, so Politoed is an obligatory teammate. Stealth Rock and Spikes support are useful for Toxicroak, as with them on the field it can secure the OHKO or 2HKO on various threats after a boost, including Choice Scarf Politoed and Volcarona with Sucker Punch; 252 HP Jirachi and Volcarona with Drain Punch; and Gyarados with Ice Punch. Ferrothorn is an excellent partner that can set up both entry hazards and switch into many Pokemon that Toxicroak struggles against such as Hippowdon, Gyarados, Garchomp, and Kyurem-B. Celebi also has good defensive synergy with Toxicroak, sets up Stealth Rock, and takes care of Hippowdon and Gyarados with a specially defensive set. Offensive Starmie and Choice Scarf Keldeo are able to outspeed and KO almost everything that checks or walls Toxicroak, creating a very potent offensive duo. Generally, Swords Dance Toxicroak thrives on rain offense teams that need a way to handle Keldeo, Terrakion, Chansey, Blissey, Tentacruel, Breloom, and Ferrothorn, all Pokemon that Toxicroak can set up against easily.</p>"

Giga Drain is used as the second STAB option to stay healthy throughout the game while also hitting the bulky Water-types that will switch into Blizzard such as Politoed and Rotom-W. Leech Seed can disrupt any non-immune switch-in, providing significant chip damage and keeping Abomasnow healthy to win the weather war. The health drain allows Abomasnow to sit on walls trying to outlast it , such as Blissey and Jirachi, while the chip damage alongside hail will put Ice-resistant sweepers like Volcarona and Scizor on a much faster timer. Ice Shard can be used to revenge kill Dragon-type threats such as Latios, Dragonite, Garchomp, and Salamence, as well as breaking Alakazam's Focus Sash. Protect is used to get Leftovers recovery, rack up Leech Seed and hail damage, and scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Keldeo, Scizor and, Terrakion.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The bulk EVs allow Abomasnow to survive Secret Sword from Keldeo from full HP. 84 Special Defense EVs allow Abomasnow to take one Focus Blast from Modest Thundurus-T. The rest of the EVs and nature are dedicated to making Abomasnow as powerful as possible, with a Quiet nature chosen if it is utilizing Ice Shard. Alternatively, an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Sassy nature allows Abomasnow to survive a Modest Thundurus-T's Focus Blast after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Abomasnow set prefers to be used on more balanced or stall archetypes where residual damage is the aim of the game. Forretress is a great partner for Abomasnow, as it is immune to hail thanks to Overcoat and provides both Spikes and Rapid Spin support, which is required for Abomasnow due to its Ice typing Special walls such as Blissey, Clefable, and Heatran can take on special attackers that threaten Abomasnow such as Latios, Volcarona, and Alakazam. Blissey and Heatran can also both provide Stealth Rock, which can provide even more residual damage when combined with hail and Leech Seed. Other Steel-types such as Scizor and Jirachi are also good options to check Latios and, other Dragon-types that Abomasnow's Ice Shard is not enough to cover such as Kyurem-B and Yache Berry Dragonite. Reuniclus is immune to hail with its Magic Guard ability, and its pure Psychic typing lets it switch into the Fighting-types Keldeo and Terrakion that would otherwise threaten Abomasnow with heavy damage or a KO. Gliscor also brings a resistance to Fighting, can offset hail damage with Poison Heal, and can accrue hail damage on foes in many ways such as with Knock Off, Stealth Rock, and Swords Dance; these sets also appreciate counters such as Skarmory taking additional damage. Tentacruel, though niche, can also be partnered with Abomasnow to provide Knock Off , Rapid Spin, and Toxic Spikes, as well as being able to switch into common threats that would otherwise threaten Abomasnow such as Volcarona, Heatran, and Latios carrying Hidden Power Fire, though it doesn't appreciate the Hail cutting into its longevity.</p>"

Combining this with Wood Hammer, Abomasnow becomes incredibly hard to switch into. Wood Hammer threatens the plethora of bulky Water-types that would want to come in on Blizzard such as Politoed, Rotom-W, and Jellicent and hits Tyranitar switching in trying to reset the weather. Focus Punch threatens damage on Clefable, Tyranitar, Heatran, and, when outside of hail, Ferrothorn switching in. Earthquake can be used as a surprise option to threaten heavy damage on Heatran, which otherwise would check Abomasnow, and hits Tyranitar and Tentacruel hard without taking the recoil damage Wood Hammer has. Hidden Power Fire is used to threaten KOs on Forretress and Scizor and deals heavy damage to Ferrothorn and Air Balloon Magnezone. Ice Shard picks off weakened Dragon-Types such as Latios, Garchomp, Dragonite, and Salamence, as well as breaking Alakazam's Focus Sash.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>212 Speed EVs allow Abomasnow to outspeed Rotom-W. Maximum Special Attack investment maximizes Blizzard's damage. The remaining EVs are put into Attack to give Abomasnow's coverage and priority moves as much power as possible. Alternatively, Abomasnow can run 252 Speed EVs in order to outrun Modest Hidden Power Fire Magnezone and to guarantee at least a Speed tie versus other neutral-natured Abomasnow.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mixed Abomasnow's best archetype is hyper offense, as it hits very hard and is immediately threatening early-game, which sets the pace well for aggressive teams. Dragon-type partners such as Dragonite, Latios, Garchomp, and Salamence all appreciate the hail chipping their Steel-type checks such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Jirachi. Dragonite can hold Leftovers to keep its Multiscale intact in hail. In return, Abomasnow has priority Ice Shard to revenge kill Choice Scarf Dragon-types. Physical threats Mamoswine and Kyurem-B also appreciate Abomasnow's hail, as it chips their Steel-type checks such as Skarmory and Forretress while not damaging themselves. On top of that, Mamoswine can provide utility for its team with Stealth Rock if it's required. Gyarados grants hail teams a check to Keldeo and Excadrill, which both outspeed andOHKO Abomasnow once its Focus Sash is broken, as well as providing an offensive check to Volcarona, which can threaten to sweep with Quiver Dance against Abomasnow. Starmie provides Rapid Spin support, which is required for Abomasnow to keep its Focus Sash intact and to let it switch in and out throughout the game. In return, Starmie appreciates the hail chipping down Ferrothorn or denying its Leftovers recovery. Starmie also appreciates Abomasnow removing rain, letting it more easily run Hidden Power Fire over Ice Beam to further chip down Steel-types, further enabling Dragon-type teammates. Jirachi or Scizor can be used alongside Abomasnow as a switch-in for Dragon-type moves that would threaten Abomasnow and can provide pivoting with U-turn.</p>"

This means, unlike Tyranitar and Scizor, it's able to Pursuit trap the aforementioned Psychic-types without a Choice Scarf. Another appealing aspect about Weavile is its access to STAB Ice Shard, meaning that it can revenge kill sweepers like Garchomp, Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Thundurus-T. This makes Weavile good against offensive teams that rely on these Pokemon outspeeding foes after a Speed boost to sweep.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Weavile has several egregious flaws. While it's much faster and more efficient at disposing of specific Pokemon, it can't switch into any of them because of its weakness-laden typing that's exacerbated by its vulnerability to entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, thus worsening its consistency as a trapper. For these reasons, Weavile is often passed over for Tyranitar and Scizor, as the former sets up sand, granting it better defensive utility against special attackers, and can set up Stealth Rock, while the latter has a much better defensive typing and more versatility, making it easier to fit on teams. Additionally, both Tyranitar and Scizor have much better coverage and defensive utility than Weavile, lending themselves to a greater variety of teams.</p>",

Furthermore, it isn't too vulnerable to entry hazards due to Regenerator keeping it healthy upon switching, and it is able to punish switch-ins with Knock Off and status. However, Tangrowth struggles due to its abhorrent special bulk, leaving it vulnerable to special attackers like Latios, Volcarona, Starmie, and Keldeo which additionally makes it mostly deadweight against rain teams. Common coverage from Pokemon it's meant to check, like Garchomp and Tyranitar running Fire Blast and Gastrodon running Ice Beam, gives it even more problems. It's also susceptible to status from Pokemon like Rotom-W, Politoed, Tentacruel, and Breloom and is unable to threaten bulkier Pokemon that aren't as bothered by status like Skarmory, Heatran, Reuniclus, and Ferrothorn outside of hitting them with Knock Off.</p>",

  "Gliscor": {
    "overview": "<p>Gliscor is one of the best and most common Pokemon on sand teams thanks to its fantastic defensive utility, good support movepool, and ability to sweep with its Swords Dance set. Its typing and Poison Heal grant it immunities to common residual damage methods like Spikes, sand, and status, giving it incredible longevity. This longevity lets it make consistent use of its valuable immunities to Electric and Ground, resistance to Fighting, and general bulk to check common Pokemon like Tyranitar, Jirachi, specially defensive Heatran, Garchomp, Terrakion, and Excadrill. Its support movepool includes Stealth Rock and Knock Off, letting it make progress despite its lack of power. It can also run a sweeping Swords Dance set that leverages its defensive utility to find many setup opportunities against common Pokemon like Heatran, Jirachi, Reuniclus lacking Hidden Power Ice, and Tyranitar. This set also enables it to defeat less sturdy checks, like Rotom-W and Gastrodon. However, Stealth Rock Gliscor cannot threaten defensive Pokemon like Reuniclus, Gastrodon, Skarmory, and Rotom-W beyond using Knock Off. It also tends to get overwhelmed by common special attackers like Keldeo, Alakazam, Reuniclus, and Latios due to its average special bulk. It can get lured in and taken out by Pokemon running Ice-type coverage, like Tyranitar, Thundurus-T, Alakazam, Reuniclus, and Heatran. These aspects in tandem with its weakness to Water make it dead weight against rain teams. Gliscor also competes with Landorus-T as a result of its better offensive prowess and Intimidate.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt over Stealth Rock allows Gliscor to stop Pokemon like Skarmory, Gastrodon, Reuniclus, and Ferrothorn from setting up entry hazards or recovering. Toxic can be used on the Stealth Rock set to cripple switch-ins like Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Latios. However, many of Gliscor's other switch-ins, like Skarmory, opposing Gliscor, Reuniclus, and Refresh Politoed, are immune to or unbothered by poison. Substitute can be used over Protect on the Swords Dance set to get more setup opportunities and punish switches against Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Excadrill. Roost lets Gliscor recover a lot of health in one turn, making it more sustainable in the short term. However, Protect has much more utility and usually suffices for recovery because Gliscor takes so little residual damage. Substitute + Toxic + Protect alongside Magnezone and Pursuit Tyranitar can be used to Toxic stall foes. However, such a set abandons team support, and common Pokemon like Reuniclus, Refresh Politoed, and Encore Alakazam stop it in its tracks. Rock Slide OHKOes Volcarona, does solid damage to Thundurus-T, and creates solid neutral coverage in tandem with Earthquake. However, these Pokemon can be better handled through teammates than a valuable moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory uses Gliscor as setup fodder for Spikes.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gliscor gets many opportunities to set Stealth Rock by proxy of its longevity and ability to threaten the most common spinners, Tentacruel and Excadrill. Protect allows Gliscor to scout Choice item users and for coverage meant to lure it, like Ice Beam Tyranitar and Hidden Power Ice Alakazam and Heatran. It also lets Gliscor safely activate Toxic Orb. Knock Off is useful in longer games with its high PP and ability to remove Leftovers from Pokemon like Landorus-T, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn. U-turn pivots Gliscor's teammates in safely and, particularly, lets Pursuit Tyranitar safely trap Latios, Reuniclus, and even Focus Sash Alakazam. Ice Fang can be used over Knock Off or U-turn to hit Dragonite, Breloom, and Garchomp, and Wing Attack can be used to OHKO Breloom should Gliscor's team be especially weak to it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Adamant Sand Force Excadrill's Iron Head after Stealth Rock, with the HP investment also maximizing Poison Heal recovery. A more specially defensive spread of 244 HP / 72 Def / 192 SpD and with a Careful nature lets Gliscor take Alakazam's Hidden Power Ice and Choice Specs Latios's Surf and check other special attackers like Heatran and Volcarona more effectively. Lowering Gliscor's Speed IVs allows for a slower U-turn, which lets it more consistently pivot its teammates in safely. However, it lets Pokemon like Rotom-W and Jirachi outspeed and heavily dent Gliscor.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock Gliscor is best used on bulky sand teams; it checks threats to sand teams like Terrakion, sets Stealth Rock, and appreciates sand and Pursuit support further wearing down its checks. Tyranitar sets sand and Pursuit traps Reuniclus, Latios, and Alakazam with a Chople Berry set while also being able to run a coverage move or Thunder Wave with Gliscor setting Stealth Rock. It can also run a Choice Scarf set that checks offensive threats Gliscor can't cover, like Starmie and Thundurus-T. In return, Gliscor checks Ground-types like Excadrill and opposing Gliscor. Ferrothorn and Skarmory set Spikes to accompany Gliscor's Stealth Rock and Knock Off. Skarmory checks strong physical attackers like Dragonite and Scizor and more reliably switches into Ground-types that can overwhelm Gliscor, like Landorus-T and Mamoswine. It can also pivot into Alakazam and Latios should it be running a specially defensive spread. Ferrothorn, on the other hand, switches into Dragon-types like Latios and Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Superpower as well as Water-types like Starmie and Politoed. Meanwhile, Gliscor checks Fighting- and Fire-types like Terrakion, Breloom, and Heatran. Psychic-types like Alakazam, Latios, and Reuniclus appreciate Gliscor's Stealth Rock and Knock Off support wearing down their switch-ins. Focus Sash Alakazam can revenge kill any Pokemon and punish Pokemon that try to set up on Gliscor, mainly Reuniclus, with Encore and Thunder Wave. Latios switches into Water-, Grass-, and Electric-types like Keldeo, Celebi, and Thundurus-T while bringing sweeping potential with a Choice Scarf set, which revenge kills and cripples Pokemon that can set up on Gliscor like Reuniclus and Volcarona. Reuniclus appreciates its switch-ins being worn down so it can sweep with Calm Mind and more easily wallbreak if running its three attacks set. Jellicent can take on strong special attackers like Volcarona, Politoed, and Keldeo while spreading more residual damage with Will-O-Wisp and stopping recovery with Taunt, with Gliscor checking strong physical threats like Terrakion, Garchomp, and Excadrill. Gastrodon is a good partner because it more easily checks strong Electric- and Water-types like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, Starmie, and Keldeo and switches into Heatran more safely. Excadrill pressures Reuniclus and checks Electric- and Dragon-types while appreciating Gliscor countering Ground-types like Excadrill and opposing Gliscor. Heatran counters Grass- and Fire-types like Celebi and Volcarona and can drop Stealth Rock on its defensive set with Gliscor covering that role or serve an offensive role with the residual damage support Gliscor provides. Rotom-W checks Water- and Ice-types like Starmie, Keldeo, and Mamoswine while also spreading burns with Will-O-Wisp in tandem with Gliscor's Stealth Rock and Knock Off. Magnezone traps Skarmory, a Gliscor counter, while benefitting from Gliscor checking Fighting- and Ground-types.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance Gliscor is a potent balance breaker thanks to its longevity and bulk giving it many setup opportunities and making it able to beat Pokemon that'd otherwise check it, like Reuniclus lacking Hidden Power Ice and Rotom-W. Protect allows Gliscor to activate Toxic Orb safely and scout Choice item users and for coverage meant to lure it, like Ice Beam Tyranitar and Hidden Power Ice Alakazam and Heatran. Facade hits many Pokemon resistant to Earthquake, like Rotom-W, Latios, Breloom, and opposing Gliscor, while also having good neutral coverage and high PP for good utility in longer games. Ice Fang can be run over Facade to hit Breloom, Dragonite, Landorus-T, and opposing Gliscor much harder. However, it has less PP and worse neutral coverage, making it more situational.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A spread of 244 HP / 72 Def / 192 SpD with a Careful nature lets Gliscor take Alakazam's Hidden Power Ice and Choice Specs Latios's Surf, with the HP investment also maximizing Poison Heal recovery.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits on sand teams because they can remove and wear down its counterplay. Tyranitar brings sand and can set up Stealth Rock with a Chople Berry set that Pursuit traps Pokemon that can keep Gliscor from sweeping, like Alakazam, Perish Song Celebi, and Hidden Power Ice Reuniclus. Magnezone traps Skarmory, a Gliscor counter, while benefitting from Gliscor checking Fighting- and Ground-types. Rotom-W checks Water- and Ice-types like Starmie, Keldeo, and Mamoswine and spreads burns with Will-O-Wisp. Alakazam can create setup opportunities with Encore, revenge kill any one threat thanks to Focus Sash, and clean up late-game with the holes Gliscor can create against Pokemon like Reuniclus and Gastrodon. Latios switches into Water-, Grass-, and Electric-types like Keldeo, Celebi, and Thundurus-T while bringing sweeping potential with a Choice Scarf set, which revenge kills and cripples Pokemon that can set up on Gliscor like Reuniclus and Volcarona. Ferrothorn and Skarmory set Spikes to wear down switch-ins so Gliscor can sweep more easily. Ferrothorn switches into Dragon-types like Latios and Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Superpower as well as Water-types like Starmie and Politoed. It provides other forms of support with Stealth Rock and Knock Off while appreciating Gliscor checking Fighting- and Fire-types like Terrakion, Breloom, and Heatran. Skarmory checks strong physical attackers like Dragonite and Scizor while also acting as a more reliable switch-in for Ground-types that can overwhelm Gliscor, like Landorus-T and Mamoswine. It can also handle Alakazam and Latios should it be running a specially defensive spread. Heatran counters Grass- and Fire-types like Celebi and Volcarona in addition to setting Stealth Rock, but it can instead run an offensive set to wear down Gliscor's checks while appreciating its Fighting resistance.</p>"

  "Mamoswine": {
    "overview": "<p>Mamoswine's STAB combination hits almost the entire OU metagame for neutral or super effective damage, making it an excellent wallbreaker that can fit on a variety of teams and is difficult to deal with defensively. Ice Shard enables Mamoswine to also check many of the metagame's top threats, such as Landorus-T, Latios, and Garchomp. Thick Fat is also decently useful, especially if Mamoswine is used on a rain team to further reduce its Fire weakness. Mamoswine has subpar defensive stats and is weak to a lot of common attacks, which can make it hard to bring and keep in play. Its Speed is only decent, which makes it rather easy to revenge kill with faster Pokemon that aren't weak to Ice Shard unless it is behind a Substitute.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb is an alternative item for Mamoswine, although the recoil wearing it down makes it easier to play around. A Focus Sash set with Stealth Rock and Endeavor can be used on hyper offense teams that want Stealth Rock up immediately. However, this set has limited use and is outclassed by other Focus Sash leads. Stealth Rock can also be used on other sets if no teammate has a slot for it. Icicle Spear is an alternative Ice-type STAB attack that has perfect accuracy and punishes Substitute users like Breloom, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Thundurus-T but has unreliable power. Knock Off is a usable support option, although Mamoswine would often prefer to use stronger attacking moves. Chople Berry can be used to let a healthy Mamoswine survive Terrakion's Close Combat and Alakazam's or Thundurus-T's Focus Blast, but this doesn't have good interactions with Substitute, and a set with four attacks generally prefers an attack-boosting item. A set with Salac Berry alongside Substitute can be used to give Mamoswine a chance to sweep, but it generally prefers an item with more consistent benefits. Metronome is a decent option alongside Substitute, but it can be hard to get a significant boost with. A Choice Scarf set with Icicle Spear can be used to better check fast threats like Focus Sash Alakazam and faster Substitute users. However, this set is a lot weaker than wallbreaking ones.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Rotom-W is one of the best counters to Mamoswine thanks to its Ground immunity and Ice resistance. However, it needs to consecutively hit Hydro Pump to beat Substitute Mamoswine reliably. Other bulky Water-types such as Politoed, Milotic, and Slowbro can also switch in and threaten Mamoswine out; however, Choice Band-boosted Earthquake can be hard to switch into, especially if entry hazards are up. Offensive Water-types like Keldeo and Starmie can outspeed Mamoswine and threaten it with super effective STAB moves, although they usually can't switch into Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Alakazam, Terrakion, and Volcarona naturally outspeed Mamoswine and threaten to KO it as long as they're not in KO range of Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Physically defensive Skarmory can switch into Mamoswine. Although not as common, Bronzong is a good switch-in thanks to Levitate. Scizor and Forretress can take anything except Choice Band Earthquake and threaten Mamoswine back with Bullet Punch or Gyro Ball, respectively. If holding Air Balloon, Magnezone and Heatran can beat Mamoswine that lack Superpower. Additionally, Choice Scarf Magnezone can switch into a predicted Ice-type attack and threaten to OHKO with Flash Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Calm Mind Reuniclus isn't 2HKOed by any Mamoswine move except Earthquake from a Choice Band set, and it threatens to KO Mamoswine with Focus Blast; however, it must be cautious with Icicle Crash flinches. Mew outspeeds all Mamoswine sets, can burn it with Will-O-Wisp, and breaks Mamoswine's Substute with Psychic or a Fighting-type move, but it must watch out for Choice Band Earthquake. Cresselia can outstall Mamoswine if there is no sand or rain up using the combination of Moonlight, Reflect, and Toxic, and it can break Mamoswine's Substitute with Psychic, but Cresselia must be wary of flinches from Choice Band-boosted Icicle Crash.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute eases prediction and protects Mamoswine from Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, and Stun Spore. Notably, Substitute means Rotom-W needs to land Hydro Pump consecutively in order to beat Mamoswine. Ice Shard picks off faster Pokemon such as Latios and Garchomp. It can also be used to check weakened setup sweepers like Agility Thundurus-T and Dragon Dance Dragonite as long as Mamoswine isn't in KO range of the latter's Extreme Speed. Never-Melt Ice allows Mamoswine to OHKO offensive Garchomp with Ice Shard and 3HKO Gastrodon, Ferrothorn, and specially defensive Skarmory with Icicle Crash. Leftovers is an alternative that provides Mamoswine with passive recovery and gives it more opportunities to use Substitute.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature is preferred for increased damage output, Jolly can be used to outspeed Adamant Excadrill and maximum Speed Heatran.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mamoswine should be used as a wallbreaker, possibly paving the way for a teammate to clean up late-game. It's often best to bring Mamoswine in using a pivot or after a teammate has fainted so that it can stay healthy. However, some situations let it directly switch in, such as against passive Pokemon like Gliscor and Skarmory or against Tyranitar and Landorus-T when you predict they will use Stealth Rock. Mamoswine can then use Substitute as it forces a switch, preventing the opponent from switching around Mamoswine's attacks. Substitute is especially risk-free against Pokemon that can't break it, like BoltBeam Reuniclus. Substitute can also be used to block status moves like Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W and Jellicent as well as Toxic from Chansey, and it can be used to stall out moves like Hydro Pump from Rotom-W and Gyro Ball from Ferrothorn if they're already low on PP, especially if Mamoswine is running Leftovers. If Mamoswine isn't behind a Substitute, choosing whether to use Icicle Crash or Earthquake can be tough. If the opponent has Ground-immune Pokemon, it's often safer to use Icicle Crash. Earthquake is best used once Ground-resistant and immune Pokemon are removed or weakened. Ice Shard should be used to check and revenge kill faster Pokemon like Latios, Thundurus-T, and Garchomp. If the opponent has a setup sweeper like Dragon Dance Dragonite or Agility Thundurus-T, it can be important to keep Mamoswine intact to check them. Many offensive teams lack faster Ice-resistant Pokemon, making Ice Shard a great tool against them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mamoswine fits best on bulky offense teams due to its offensive presence. VoltTurn support from Pokemon like Rotom-W and Landorus-T is great for bringing it in safely. The former is also a good check to Water-types that Mamoswine can struggle with. Ferrothorn and Amoonguss can also check Water-types for Mamoswine. Additionally, the former can set up entry hazards to wear down Mamoswine's checks, while the latter can slow foes down with Stun Spore to support Mamoswine's merely decent Speed. Mamoswine is a decent option on rain teams, with Politoed's rain and Thick Fat both decreasing the damage it takes from Fire-type attacks. Politoed and Tentacruel can use Toxic to poison Rotom-W and other bulky Water-types for Mamoswine. Tentacruel and Starmie can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards that wear Mamoswine down. Tornadus is also a good teammate on rain teams that can wear down Rotom-W and other Pokemon for Mamoswine, use U-turn to bring it in safely, and use Tailwind to help it outspeed the opposing team. Knock Off users like Ferrothorn, Gliscor, and Seismitoad help Mamoswine by crippling the likes of Rotom-W and opposing Ferrothorn.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Choice Band Mamoswine rivals Kyurem-B in sheer destructive power. Superpower is Mamoswine's best option for hitting Rotom-W, and it hits Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Kyurem, and Kyurem-B for super effective damage. Additionally, it can hit Steel-types like Air Balloon Heatran and Air Balloon or Magnet Rise Magnezone. Ice Shard can be used to pick off faster Pokemon that have been weakened. It's also great for checking Speed-boosting setup sweepers, especially if they're weak to it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature is usually preferred for increasing damage output; however, Jolly can be used to outspeed Adamant Excadrill and maximum Speed Heatran.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to bring Mamoswine in using pivots or double switches so it can safely start wallbreaking. Correctly predicting your opponent's switches is ideal, but Icicle Crash is usually a safe move to use, as nothing is immune to it and Choice Band allows it to hit any neutral Pokemon hard. Earthquake is usually ideal to use once Ground-immune and resistant Pokemon have been weakened or removed. If the opponent has a faster Pokemon like Latios or Alakazam, or a Speed-boosting Pokemon like Dragonite or Thundurus-T, it can be important to keep Mamoswine from fainting to check them with Ice Shard. This is especially true against offensive teams, which usually lack a faster Ice-resistant Pokemon. Try to avoid status moves like Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, which severely hinder Mamoswine.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Mamoswine set fits best on more offensive teams. VoltTurn support from Pokemon like Rotom-W and Landorus-T is useful to bring Mamoswine in safely. Ferrothorn can set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes for Mamoswine while switching into Water-types and using Knock Off to remove Leftovers from Rotom-W. Landorus-T can set up Stealth Rock and check offensive Fighting-types that threaten Mamoswine out. Amoonguss is another decent check to offensive Water- and Fighting-types, and it can use Stun Spore so Mamoswine can outspeed the opposing team. Mamoswine normally forces in bulky Water-types and can wear them down with its raw power; Pokemon that appreciate this, such as Keldeo and Heatran, can work well with it. Late-game cleaners that can take advantage of Mamoswine weakening the opposing team are decent options; Swords Dance Scizor, Agility Thundurus-T, and Choice Scarf users like Keldeo and Latios are good picks. Rapid Spin support from Tentacruel or Excadrill can be useful, as this Mamoswine set likes to switch in multiple times.</p>"

  "Froslass": {
    "overview": "<p>Froslass has a very small niche on hyper offense teams as a lead, since it's the only Pokemon that can set up Spikes and block Rapid Spin. Taunt lets it further prevent entry hazards from opposing hazard leads like Skarmory. Froslass can also take out slower Pokemon that attack it after breaking its Focus Sash with Destiny Bond, making it harder to play around than other hazard-setting leads like Landorus-T and Garchomp. However, Froslass's defensive profile is insignificant, meaning it's deadweight outside of the lead slot and often has to pick between setting up multiple layers of Spikes or landing a KO with Destiny Bond. Its typing also leaves it prone to Pursuit trapping from Tyranitar and Scizor. Froslass faces strong competition as a Ghost-type with Taunt from Jellicent, which has much better defensive utility, and as a Spikes setter on hyper offense from Skarmory, which can also set Stealth Rock and run a Custap Berry or Salac Berry + Sturdy set to easily set multiple hazards.</p>",

  "Rotom-Wash": {
    "overview": "<p>Having an awesome defensive type combination alongside a fantastic ability, Rotom-W is one of the best defensive pivots in the BW OU metagame and the foundation of the classic VoltTurn strategy. With solid base 107 in both defenses, an okay base Speed, and a great support movepool with Volt Switch, Will-O-Wisp, and Thunder Wave, Rotom-W is the primary choice for most sand structures to check powerful Ground-types like Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Mamoswine. It does this while maintaining the utility of taking strong Water-type hits from foes like Keldeo and Starmie. Rotom-W also benefits from sand building pressure on special walls, helping it keep up the team's offensive momentum. It does have a low base HP and a very shallow offensive movepool, but Rotom-W still is one of the most solid options for any sand team and a great choice even outside of sand.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ice can be used over Hydro Pump on the defensive set to give Rotom-W BoltBeam coverage, have a more accurate move that can't be PP stalled via Substitute and Protect users like Gliscor, and still have a form of healing in Pain Split. However, this makes Rotom-W weak to Heatran and Substitute Mamoswine, two Pokemon that it's normally able to counter. Hidden Power Flying can be used over Pain Split to instantly defeat Poison Heal Breloom and deal decent damage to Amoonguss and Celebi, but it doesn't have any targets outside of this. In a same vein, Hidden Power Fire can be used to heavily damage Ferrothorn, but this requires good prediction, and you lose a valuable moveslot for it. Signal Beam can be used on a non-Choice item set to demolish Celebi and deal heavy damage to Latios and Reuniclus while not risking a miss from Hydro Pump, but it doesn't have targets outside of this. Rest alongside a Chesto Berry is the only other form of healing Rotom-W has, but the loss of Leftovers makes it struggle in sand. Thunder Wave paralysis is another status Rotom-W can spread to help its teammates, but Will-O-Wisp is almost always the better option. A physically defensive Rotom-W set can also be used to better handle Landorus-T's U-turn, Garchomp's Outrage, and Keldeo's Secret Sword, but the Special Defense loss greatly hurts its defensive utility. A Choice Specs set in rain can be utilized to have an insanely strong Hydro Pump and perfectly accurate Thunder, but other Pokemon can do this better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Breloom with Poison Heal active can use Rotom-W as a setup fodder for Bulk Up, Swords Dance, or Substitute, since the only move it fears is the rare Hidden Power Flying. Amoonguss can enter in front of Rotom-W anytime and scare it off with Giga Drain, but Amoonguss alone is unable to stop a VoltTurn chain. Celebi doesn't care about anything Rotom-W can do because of Natural Cure, and it can steal the momentum with Leaf Storm, Nasty Plot, or Baton Pass. Ferrothorn can use Rotom-W to stack Spikes, since there is nothing Rotom-W can do to it except a Will-O-Wisp burn, and Rotom-W fears Power Whip in retaliation or having its item removed with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Kyurem-B outspeeds defensive Rotom-W and threatens an immediate KO with Outrage. Latios and Hydreigon can come in on any Rotom-W set and immediately fire off Draco Meteor to heavily damage it, but Latios must watch out for a Volt Switch into a Tyranitar that Pursuit traps it. Latias can use any Rotom-W set to set up Substitute and Calm Mind or help its teammates with Tailwind or Healing Wish. Dragonite can use Rotom-W to set up Dragon Dance, either by hiding behind a Substitute or having a Lum Berry.</p> <p><strong>Gastrodon and Seismitoad</strong>: Gastrodon is immune to both of Rotom-W's STAB moves and can heal off burn damage with Recover while poisoning or burning it with Toxic or Scald. Seismitoad can do the same thing; it's also immune to both STAB moves, shrugs off a Will-O-Wisp burn with Refresh, and threatens Rotom-W with Knock Off, Toxic, or a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Electric-immune Pokemon like Gliscor, Mamoswine, Garchomp, Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Thundurus-T can use Substitute to outstall Hydro Pump's PP, especially if they are carrying Leftovers or running Protect, or fish for a miss with Hydro Pump's shaky accuracy. Pokemon with high Special Defense, like Heatran and Terrakion in sand, can set up Substitute that isn't broken by Volt Switch and then outstall Hydro Pump's PP or fish for a miss. Dragon-types like Dragonite, Kyurem-B, and Kyurem can set up Substitute versus any standard Rotom-W variant and immediately threaten it or its teammates.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is the most important move, since it lets Rotom-W keep the offensive momentum while checking Water-types and Ground-types, as the latter will not stay in due to fearing a stray Hydro Pump or burn. Will-O-Wisp lets Rotom-W spread burn to severely cripple Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Garchomp, and Tyranitar. It also helps defeat specially defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss, Latios, and opposing Rotom-W, as the extra damage puts those Pokemon in KO range faster, especially alongside sand damage. Pain Split is the best healing option Rotom-W has and works well with its low base HP, but it's a bit unreliable in the later stages of the match. Because of this, using Hidden Power Ice over Pain Split is an option to help Rotom-W's troubles with Dragon-types, Poison Heal Breloom, and specially defensive Gliscor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>56 Special Defense EVs let Rotom-W always survive Timid Thundurus-T's Thunder after 2 rounds of Stealth Rock while the rest of the EVs hits a Defense number and maximizes Leftovers recovery. An alternative spread of 248 HP / 20 Def / 240 SpD with a Calm nature can be used to better check special attackers like Heatran, Starmie, and Tornadus while letting Rotom-W always survive two Secret Swords from Choice Scarf Keldeo without Stealth Rock. However, better checking physical threats like Mamoswine, Gliscor, Tyranitar, and Cloyster is typically more important. Rotom-W can run reduced Speed IVs to bring in teammates more safely with a slower Volt Switch, but at least 14 IVs are recommended to outspeed standard specially defensive Heatran. It can also run 88 Speed EVs to outrun Adamant Scizor.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Rotom-W early-game to spread burn as soon as possible. Its STAB moves alongside Will-O-Wisp scare away a good portion of the metagame's threats; use this knowledge with Volt Switch to keep the offensive momentum, either by bringing an entry hazard stacker like Ferrothorn or a hard-hitting Pokemon like Landorus-T. Landorus-T can further keep the pressure with U-turn, forming a VoltTurn core. Do not fear bringing Rotom-W in front of a strong special attacker like Keldeo or Alakazam, since you can recover its HP with Pain Split; this is most effective early-game because most of the opposing Pokemon will be at full health. Beware of opposing Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, and Scald burns, since poisoning or burning Rotom-W, alongside sand damage, is the easiest way of putting it into KO range.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tyranitar is the primary partner, since it sets sand and can Pursuit trap Pokemon that give Rotom-W trouble like Latios and Amoonguss. Landorus-T and Gliscor are amazing options, as both can help Rotom-W with Stealth Rock and Knock Off support, checking Mold Breaker Excadrill and Poison Heal Breloom, and forming a VoltTurn core with U-turn. Ferrothorn provides Spikes and Knock Off support alongside a Dragon-type check if used with Gyro Ball or another rain check if used with Power Whip. Powerful offensive Pokemon like Latios, Alakazam, Reuniclus, Excadrill, Garchomp, and Terrakion love the slow Volt Switch Rotom-W provides to enter the field safely. Other U-turn users, like Jirachi, Scizor, and Celebi, are also valid team choices.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to deal good damage while avoiding opposing attacks and sand damage, which is useful because Rotom-W's low HP makes it a bit frail. Hydro Pump is mandatory, since it's Rotom-W's best attacking move and defeats foes that are immune to Volt Switch like Excadrill and Mamoswine. Hidden Power Ice checks Pokemon that normally love to use Rotom-W as setup fodder, like Dragonite and Garchomp, while dealing good damage to Pokemon that resist both of Rotom-W's STAB moves, like Latios, Breloom, Hydreigon, and Amoonguss. Trick is Rotom-W's best option to stop setup sweepers like Reuniclus or cripple Pokemon it can't naturally defeat, like Ferrothorn, Celebi, and Gastrodon. Thunderbolt deserves a mention to possibly replace Trick or Hidden Power Ice, since having a Electric-type STAB move besides Volt Switch is useful in some matchups.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With a Timid nature, 224 Speed EVs let Rotom-W outspeed standard bulky Choice Scarf Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to avoid getting Rotom-W damaged by Stealth Rock or sand, since this would reveal its lack of Leftovers and you want to bluff a more defensive set to have maximum effectiveness with a Choice Scarf. This is particularly important early-game, as this is where you can grab a surprise KO against a Pokemon like Garchomp and Landorus-T or cripple a Pokemon like Ferrothorn or Gastrodon with Trick. However, if Rotom-W is your team's only failsafe for fast threats, then be careful when using Trick, since this can leave you very weak to setup Pokemon like Dragonite and Reuniclus or fast, hard-hitting Pokemon like Keldeo and Latios.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Rotom-W set hates the chip damage sand causes, so it's best used in a weatherless or rain structure. Politoed is a powerful partner, since it tanks strong Water-type attacks and can summon rain to boost Rotom-W's deadly Hydro Pump. Partners that can capitalize on the offensive momentum Rotom-W generates like Breloom, Landorus-T, Latios, Kyurem-B, and Scizor are very good options. Keep in mind that you must have ways to deal with strong special attackers like Latios, Alakazam, and Thundurus-T, so Pokemon like Jirachi and Celebi are also good partners.</p>"

It also OHKOes virtually any neutral offensive target, making switching into it a very difficult prospect. Moreover, Victini's access to Bolt Strike and Brick Break means that many of its checks like Tyranitar, Politoed and Heatran need to be careful switching in. Victini's access to U-turn also means it can safely maintain momentum for its team and thwart Tyranitar's attempts to come in and Pursuit trap it. These traits make Victini a decent wallbreaker on offensive teams.</p> <p>However, Victini isn't seen too often due to its awful defensive typing making it difficult for it to switch in safety. It can only directly switch into Alakazam lacking Shadow Ball and Calm Mind Reuniclus variants with Psychic + Focus Blast and is often forced out by faster threats such as Latios, Keldeo, Garchomp and Terrakion. The presence of sand and rain is also particularly problematic, as the former cuts into Victini's already limited longevity with its vulnerability to Stealth Rock, while the latter weakens Victini's V-create. Finally, Victini has to be very careful about spamming V-create to avoid letting Tyranitar and Heatran switch in and take advantage of it. As such, it's often passed over for other wallbreakers like Dragonite, Scizor, and Terrakion since they all have better defensive utility. As an offensive Fire-type, Heatran and Volcarona are often superior, as the former has better defensive utility while the latter has access to Quiver Dance and a much better matchup against sand teams. Both also have the benefits of being far less prediction reliant for damage and not being as vulnerable to being Pursuit trapped by Tyranitar.</p>",

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Excadrill is one of the best Pokemon in the tier. Its excellent defensive typing and decent natural bulk make it able to switch into Pokemon like Latios, Tyranitar, Reuniclus lacking Focus Blast, and Jirachi. It is hard to wear down because of its 4x resistance to Stealth Rock and immunity to sand; this means Excadrill recovers more health from Leftovers and can effectively run Protect, making it even harder to wear down. It is incredible offensively because it's so strong and has good STAB attacks, which makes it hard to defensively answer, and Sand Force and Mold Breaker further this by changing how the opponent has to approach handling Excadrill. Because of these things and being able to threaten the most common entry hazard setters in the tier, mainly Tyranitar, Heatran, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn, it's the best spinner in the tier. This ability to support its team so well makes Excadrill work with many of the best Pokemon in the tier, and as such, it fits on a wide variety of teams and is pretty much always useful in a game. However, it doesn't have the greatest natural Speed tier, so it can be offensively checked by Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Keldeo. It also has common weaknesses, which means it needs to be careful around the Pokemon it usually wants to come in on, mainly Latios and Tyranitar, since they run super effective coverage. On top of this, good checks like Air Balloon + Magnet Rise Magnezone, Garchomp, Landorus-T, Keldeo, Rotom-W, Skarmory, and Gliscor are also quite common, which limits its overall viability and ability to come in.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance + Rapid Spin can be used on rain teams, as it grants them a Jirachi and Reuniclus answer that can give entry hazard control. However, rain teams are typically better off running Tentacruel as a spinner. Air Balloon can be used to completely wall Gliscor lacking an attack besides Earthquake and Landorus-T locked into Earthquake while also making Excadrill immune to Spikes. However, it breaks upon taking any hit and leaves Excadrill without Leftovers recovery or even a boost to Speed like Choice Scarf would grant. Air Balloon is best used on a Swords Dance + 3 Attacks set with Iron Head, Earthquake, and Rock Slide. Choice Band Excadrill can be a fierce wallbreaker, especially with Sand Force. However, Excadrill doesn't have a move that isn't very punishing to lock into and much prefers getting Leftovers recovery so it can come in throughout the game much more easily.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory is the best Excadrill answer in the tier. Excadrill can't hurt Skarmory, and Skarmory can set Spikes on it, especially if Skarmory's a Rocky Helmet variant. However, Excadrill can use Rapid Spin or attempt to flinch Skarmory down in a pinch it if it's not Rocky Helmet, while Skarmory can't actually hurt it if back should it lack Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor can all take at least one hit from Excadrill and take it out with Earthquake or, in the former two's case, set Stealth Rock. However, Garchomp and Landorus-T are vulnerable to being worn down over time, and Gliscor can get flinched down should it come to that.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-W</strong>: Rotom-W hard walls all Sand Force sets lacking Rock Slide, forces Excadrill out with the threat of Hydro Pump, and uses it as an opportunity to use Will-O-Wisp or Pain Split. However, it can't handle Mold Breaker variants and can take a decent chunk from Sand Force-boosted Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Other Water-types</strong>: Politoed, Keldeo, and Gyarados are able to switch into Excadrill at least once and take it out with super effective STAB attacks. However, Politoed needs to be healthy to win the weather war and as such can't take too many hits and is outsped if lacking Choice Scarf, Keldeo takes a lot from Earthquake despite being able to take a hit, and Gyarados is weak to Stealth Rock, so it's easily worn down.</p> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: Air Balloon Magnezone can get in on a predicted Earthquake or after a KO, use Magnet Rise as Excadrill breaks the Air Balloon, then take out Excadrill with Hidden Power Fire. However, it's vulnerable to being flinched by Iron Head from the Sand Force set as it uses Magnet Rise. It's worth noting Choice Scarf Excadrill locked into any non-Earthquake move is trappable by all Magnezone sets.</p> <p><strong>Thundurus-T</strong>: Thundurus-T is a decent soft check that can take at least one Sand Force-boosted Iron Head reasonably well and force Excadrill out with the threat of Focus Blast. It can also set up a Substitute on a forced switch should it have Substitute as well, and Substitute makes Thundurus-T beat defensive sets. However, Substitute + Agility sets can't beat the Sand Force set due to lacking the proper coverage to do good damage to it while taking quite a bit from Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Breloom, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth can take at least one hit and cripple or take out Excadrill with super effective coverage or status. However, they're also liable to be worn down, especially Ferrothorn due to its lack of recovery and tendency to get burned and lose Leftovers to Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Garchomp, Landorus-T, Keldeo, Thundurus-T, and Alakazam can all outspeed Excadrill and take it out with powerful super effective coverage, and all of them can take at least one hit. However, they often have a hard time switching in and can struggle to take on the Choice Scarf set.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Protect in tandem with Leftovers lets Excadrill stay at high health as well as scout potentially Choice-locked Pokemon like Landorus-T, Terrakion, Tyranitar, Latios, and Garchomp. Rapid Spin lets Excadrill greatly support its entry hazard-susceptible teammates as well as itself and uses the move well thanks to being very hard to spinblock. Rock Slide has some potential utility with Sand Force sets due to doing a good amount of damage to Rotom-W, Thundurus-T, and Skarmory while also denting Gyarados quite heavily. However, it's hard to fit and doesn't have much utility outside of these specific targets.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sand Force is the preferred ability on this set, as it lets Excadrill nail a 2HKO on Ferrothorn and Reuniclus with Earthquake while also 2HKOing Choice Scarf Landorus-T that don't have much bulk investment and Poison Heal Breloom with Iron Head. A Jolly nature can also be used for teams especially weak to Timid Heatran while also outspeeding Adamant Dragonite and Mamoswine. However, this leaves Excadrill unable to get the important damage benchmarks mentioned above. Mold Breaker lets Excadrill use Earthquake more freely against teams that rely on Rotom-W or Latios as their primary pivot to Earthquake. A spread of 252 Atk / 124 SpD / 132 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used to outspeed maximum Speed Jolly Tyranitar, Adamant Breloom, and Modest Politoed and take attacks like Draco Meteor from Latios better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Attempt to get Excadrill in via a double switch or into resisted or weak attacks like Tyranitar's Crunch, Reuniclus's Psychic or Hidden Power Ice, and any of Amoonguss's attacks. Use Protect to scout a Choice-locked Pokemon, gain health from Leftovers, and rack up residual damage with sand and a potential Toxic poison or burn. If you need to spin away entry hazards, do it on a forced switch or a weak or resisted attack like Reuniclus's Hidden Power Ice. Do not take a lot of unnecessary damage; this set doesn't have as much bulk, meaning it may be unable to take an important hit such as Latios's Dragon Pulse late-game if its health dips too low. If up against a rain team, use Excadrill to spin Ferrothorn's entry hazards away throughout the game and force chip damage on Politoed to aid in winning the weather war. Excadrill can also threaten Tentacruel out should it be healthy enough, since Scald doesn't OHKO it. If predicting a counter such as Skarmory, Gliscor, or Rotom-W if Excadrill is running Sand Force to come in, switch into an answer to these Pokemon to maintain momentum and pressure. Pay attention to which Pokemon heals from Leftovers first against opposing Excadrill and Heatran because whether Excadrill can offensively answer them is contingent on it being faster. If Excadrill is slower, switch out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tyranitar is this set's best partner, as it lets Excadrill run Sand Force while also setting Stealth Rock and trapping potentially problematic Pokemon such as Alakazam, Jellicent, and Thundurus-T. It can even attempt to lure in and OHKO Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Skarmory with Ice Beam and Fire Blast to make Excadrill even harder to check. Excadrill, meanwhile, can act as a backup Reuniclus measure and handle most Steel-types that may give Tyranitar a hard time based on its coverage. Latios can check Keldeo, Gliscor, and Rotom-W while also busting holes in other walls alongside it. In return, Excadrill is able to handle or heavily damage Tyranitar and most of the Steel-types that trouble Latios. Keldeo makes for an excellent partner because it beats the Ground- and Steel-types Excadrill can't, namely Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Skarmory. The Toxic + Protect set, in particular, is an excellent partner, as it spreads more residual damage, which Excadrill can take advantage of with Protect, and lets it break through Pokemon like Rotom-W and Thundurus-T over time. Meanwhile, Excadrill handles Reuniclus, non-Stun Spore Amoonguss, and Latios to an extent so Keldeo can more easily spread Toxic poison while also spinning; this is particularly helpful due to Keldeo's lack of recovery outside of Leftovers, which is usually getting negated by sand. Rotom-W takes on opposing Sand Force Excadrill, Politoed, Choice Scarf Keldeo, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Mamoswine while burning said Pokemon; except for Gliscor; and even gets Excadrill in safely via Volt Switch. Excadrill can threaten Pokemon such as Reuniclus, Tyranitar, and Latios in return. It can even bait Latios into locking into Surf so Rotom-W can come in and get off a free Pain Split or Will-O-Wisp. Poison Heal Breloom can take care of Choice Scarf Keldeo, Rotom-W, Politoed, and Gliscor lacking a Flying-type move, while Excadrill can handle Reuniclus and Tornadus. Ferrothorn is able to set entry hazards, can use Knock Off to remove Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Politoed so Excadrill's damage sticks more in the long-term, and is a good Water-type and Latios switch-in. Excadrill is able to check Reuniclus and Jirachi in return while spinning away Spikes so Ferrothorn is able to check Latios more easily throughout the game. Reuniclus enjoys Excadrill's ability to handle the Steel-types that trouble it, mainly Jirachi and opposing Excadrill, to facilitate a Calm Mind sweep while also taking advantage of Excadrill handling Tyranitar very well. Reuniclus is able to beat Toxic + Protect Keldeo, Gliscor, and Skarmory for Excadrill while even beating Choice Band Terrakion in tandem with Excadrill, as Excadrill can scout what move Terrakion locks into with Protect and takes Stone Edge, while Reuniclus takes Close Combat.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin lets Excadrill support teammates weak to entry hazards and itself and uses the move well because it can force switches well and take a hit or two from common Stealth Rock setters like Tyranitar and Jirachi. Toxic is able to cripple the majority of Pokemon that can switch into Excadrill, such as Politoed, Landorus-T, Tangrowth, Hippowdon, and Jellicent, while also nailing other miscellaneous threats like Keldeo, Garchomp, Thundurus-T, and Latios. Alternatively, Excadrill can viably use Stealth Rock thanks to effectively threatening spinners. Additionally, its overall bulk in tandem with Protect and Leftovers lets it stay healthy and scout potentially Choice-locked Pokemon like opposing Excadrill, Mienshao, Tyranitar, Landorus-T, and Latios.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This EV spread outspeeds uninvested Landorus-T as well as maximum Speed neutral nature Tyranitar. The rest of the EVs guarantee maximum Leftovers recovery and make Excadrill able to come in on Latios, Tyranitar, and Tornadus more comfortably while taking at least one super effective attack from them and most other special attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Excadrill is meant to stay around throughout the game and dissuade Pokemon such as Latios from spamming their STAB moves and makes pivoting around them and Tyranitar easier for its team. When up against Ferrothorn, avoid spinning away its entry hazards before scouting for Knock Off or Leech Seed, as these moves make it so Ferrothorn will win the matchup. It's also a better idea to play out the game and wear Ferrothorn down over time with residual damage from burn or entry hazards so Excadrill can KO it and spin away the entry hazards for good. Use Protect to get back health and scout a Pokemon that has good potential to be Choice-locked like Latios, Tyranitar, or Landorus-T. Pay attention to which Pokemon heals from Leftovers first against Pokemon like Rotom-W and opposing Excadrill because whether Excadrill can offensively answer them is contingent on it being faster. If it's slower, it should switch out. When expecting a switch into a Pokemon that can check Excadrill, like Gliscor or Skarmory, switch Excadrill out as they come in to not lose momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-W takes on opposing Sand Force Excadrill, Politoed, Choice Scarf Keldeo, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Mamoswine while burning said Pokemon, except for Gliscor, and even gets Excadrill in safely via Volt Switch. Excadrill can switch into Reuniclus, Tyranitar, and Latios in return. It can even bait Latios into locking into Surf so Rotom-W can come in and get off a free Pain Split or Will-O-Wisp. Tyranitar can run Stealth Rock, letting Excadrill more freely run Toxic while also trapping potentially problematic Pokemon such as Reuniclus, Jellicent, and Thundurus-T. It can even attempt to lure in and KO Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Skarmory with Ice Beam and Fire Blast so Excadrill is not as easily answered, and sand chips down some of its answers. Excadrill, meanwhile, can act as a backup Reuniclus switch-in and handle most Steel-types that may give Tyranitar a hard time based on its coverage. Reuniclus enjoys Excadrill's ability to handle Pokemon that trouble it, mainly Jirachi, Tyranitar, and opposing Excadrill, to facilitate a Calm Mind sweep. Reuniclus is able to beat Toxic + Protect and Choice Scarf Keldeo, Gliscor, and Skarmory for Excadrill while even beating Choice Band Terrakion in tandem with Excadrill, as Excadrill can scout what move Terrakion locks into and takes Stone Edge, while Reuniclus takes Close Combat. Heatran can work together with Excadrill on Toxic + sand-based teams to suffocate the opponent over time with residual damage. Heatran also handles Breloom, Ferrothorn, and Scizor while setting Stealth Rock, which lets Excadrill run Toxic more freely. Latios can check Keldeo, Gliscor, and Rotom-W while weakening Ferrothorn and the opposing team in general. In return, Excadrill is able to handle most of the Steel-types that trouble Latios and comes in on and handles Tyranitar. Keldeo makes for an excellent partner, as it beats the Ground- and Steel-types that Excadrill can't handle, like Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Skarmory. The Toxic + Protect set in particular is a great partner, as it spreads more residual damage that Excadrill can take advantage of with Protect. Meanwhile, Excadrill handles Alakazam, Reuniclus, and Latios to an extent for Keldeo so it can more easily spread Toxic poison while spreading Toxic poison itself. Ferrothorn is able to set entry hazards, use Knock Off to remove Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Politoed so Excadrill's damage sticks for longer, and be a good Water-type and Latios switch-in. Excadrill is able to check Reuniclus and Substitute Jirachi in return while spinning away Spikes so Ferrothorn is able to check Latios more easily throughout the game. Substitute + Dragon Dance Dragonite is a great partner for Excadrill, as it takes advantage of Excadrill removing Stealth Rock to very easily get up a Substitute on many Pokemon while also liking Excadrill handling Jirachi and Gyro Ball Ferrothorn to an extent and badly poisoning bulky Water-types. Amoonguss can take care of Keldeo, Rotom-W, Politoed, and Gliscor if running Hidden Power Ice, while Excadrill can handle Reuniclus, Substitute Jirachi, and Latios for it.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin lets Excadrill assist its teammates, and, because this set is much faster than the others, it's also able to safely generate more switches to spin on. However, Excadrill is easily exploited when locked into Rapid Spin. Rock Slide should mainly be used on Sand Force sets, as it gives Excadrill a good move to hit Rotom-W while also targeting Thundurus-T and Gyarados. Toxic is an option to cripple Landorus-T, Slowbro, Hippowdon, Tangrowth, and other offensive switch-ins. However, it's incredibly punishable to lock into and doesn't work on other common counters like Gliscor and Skarmory.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sand Force is the preferred ability on this set because it lets Excadrill 2HKO Ferrothorn and Reuniclus with Earthquake in sand while also 2HKOing Choice Scarf Landorus-T that don't have much bulk investment and Poison Heal Breloom with Iron Head. An Adamant nature should be used with this ability. Mold Breaker lets Excadrill use Earthquake more freely against teams that rely on Rotom-W or Latios as their primary pivot to Earthquake. Adamant is able to get the aforementioned 2HKOs with Sand Force, while Jolly can outspeed Pokemon like +1 Jolly Dragonite, slower variants of Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and opposing Adamant Excadrill.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Don't recklessly lock into Rapid Spin, as it leaves Excadrill very exploitable. It can even let any Magnezone set come in and trap it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tyranitar is this set's best partner, as it lets Excadrill run Sand Force while also setting Stealth Rock and trapping potentially problematic Pokemon such as Alakazam, Jellicent, and Thundurus-T. It can even attempt to lure in and KO Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Skarmory with Ice Beam and Fire Blast to make Excadrill even harder to check. Meanwhile, Excadrill can more effectively clean and check faster threats thanks to the power boost with Sand Force. Latios can check Keldeo, Gliscor, and Rotom-W while also busting holes in other walls that could potentially halt a sweep. In return, Excadrill is able to revenge kill most of the non-Protect Steel-types that trouble Latios as well as Tyranitar. Keldeo makes for an excellent partner, as it beats the Ground- and Steel-types that Excadrill can't, like Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Skarmory, and potentially spread residual damage. Excadrill can take advantage of this to open up a late-game sweep for it as it wears down Pokemon like Rotom-W and Thundurus-T over time that could force Excadrill out. Meanwhile, Excadrill can revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Latios and Choice Scarf Politoed for Keldeo. Rotom-W takes on opposing Excadrill, Politoed, Choice Scarf Keldeo, Gliscor, Gyarados, and Mamoswine while even getting Excadrill in safely via Volt Switch. It can also spread burn with Will-O-Wisp so the opposing team gets weakened for a late-game sweep. Excadrill handles faster teams in return. Poison Heal Breloom can take care of Choice Scarf Keldeo, Rotom-W, Politoed, Gliscor, and slower teams more reliant on passive damage, while Excadrill can pressure Reuniclus, Amoonguss, and the faster offensive teams Breloom can struggle with. Ferrothorn is able to set entry hazards and can use Knock Off to remove Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Politoed so Excadrill's damage sticks for longer to set up a sweep. Ferrothorn also acts as a good Water-type check and Latios switch-in. Reuniclus enjoys Excadrill's ability to handle the Steel-types that trouble them, mainly Jirachi and Ferrothorn, while it can also take advantage of it handling Tyranitar very well. Reuniclus is able to beat Toxic + Protect Keldeo, Gliscor, and Skarmory while even beating Choice Band Terrakion in tandem with Excadrill, as Excadrill can scout what move Terrakion locks into and takes Stone Edge, while Reuniclus takes Close Combat.</p>"

It's also very prediction reliant and is vulnerable to residual damage from sand and entry hazards. It has strong competition for a Fighting-type attacker from Keldeo, Breloom, and Terrakion, as they all have better offensive and defensive utility. Keldeo is much faster and stronger in rain, can better answer Fire-types like Heatran and Volcarona, can fit on more team styles, and offers better set versatility. Breloom has better longevity from Poison Heal while also being able to absorb status, making it a better fixture on both sand and rain teams. Finally, Terrakion's additional Rock-typing means that it has better STAB coverage with Stone Edge and is not only able to stay healthy under sand, but it also gets a Special Defense boost under it, meaning it can survive attacks such as Latios's Draco Meteor and Alakazam's Psychic.</p>",

  "Reuniclus": {
    "overview": "<p>Reuniclus is one of the best Pokemon in the tier as a result of its amazing ability, good offensive prowess, and defensive profile. Magic Guard invalidates the passive damage bulkier threats like Ferrothorn, Slowking, Rotom-W, Tentacruel, Skarmory, and Gliscor rely on, including sandstorm, entry hazards, and status, giving Reuniclus a great matchup against their team structures, especially when accompanied by Spikes. Its great coverage moves like Focus Blast, Hidden Power Ice, and Thunder make it just as scary to offensive threats switching in as the defensive ones it sets up on. For general defensive purposes, it can switch into and force out popular threats like Gliscor, Terrakion, Garchomp, Tentacruel, Ferrothorn, defensive Heatran, and Alakazam lacking Signal Beam or Shadow Ball. It also has good set versatility; on top of Calm Mind, it can run a powerful 3 attacks set that immediately threatens bulkier teams and a Trick Room set that flips the script on faster offensive teams. However, very strong Pokemon like Keldeo, Excadrill, Latios, Kyurem-B, and offensive Heatran can overwhelm Reuniclus as a result of its low Speed and lack of resistances. Pokemon that can prevent Reuniclus from setting up safely like Trick Choice Scarf Latios, Perish Song Celebi and Politoed, and Encore Alakazam and Politoed can punish the Calm Mind set. Reuniclus is also very vulnerable to Pursuit from the omnipresent Tyranitar, which often runs Chople Berry to take Focus Blast, as well as Scizor. Its Calm Mind set loses to Jirachi and can get walled by common Pokemon depending on coverage, like Excadrill if lacking Focus Blast and Dragonite and Latios if lacking Hidden Power Ice.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Trick with a Sticky Barb or Flame Orb can be used on the Calm Mind set over Calm Mind or a coverage move to lure in and cripple switch-ins like Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Jirachi, which aids Reuniclus and the Psychic-types this set should be paired with. However, giving up Calm Mind makes it worse against the bulky teams the Calm Mind set is meant to threaten while giving up a coverage move makes Reuniclus unable to break through its checks if it doesn't manage to hit Trick on its desired target. Reuniclus has a great support movepool, making it potentially possible to run a support set with moves like Knock Off and Thunder Wave. However, its defensive typing isn't good enough to outperform other defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Gliscor, and Skarmory. A set with Calm Mind, Acid Armor, Psychic, and Recover holding Rocky Helmet may seem appealing when paired with Toxic Spikes Tentacruel on rain teams to make Reuniclus beat Tyranitar and eventually impervious to all non-critical hits. However, this set takes too long to get going, and can be easily checked or forced out by Pokemon that are immune to Toxic Spikes or poison like Jirachi, Skarmory, Scizor, Trick Latios, and Encore Alakazam.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar can take most of Reuniclus's attacks, Pursuit trap it, and set up Stealth Rock on it if it's running Chople Berry. However, it struggles to take Focus Blast, and the Choice Scarf set can easily be scouted given Reuniclus's bulk. It also tends to get worn down easily by entry hazards and Reuniclus's teammates.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Offensive Pokemon like Latios, Keldeo, Thundurus-T, Dragonite, Scizor, and Alakazam packing Signal Beam or Shadow Ball can force Reuniclus to use Recover or switch out, and Dragonite and Scizor can even set up on it. However, they struggle to take repeated hits from it and can have the tables turned on them by the Trick Room set.</p> <p><strong>Jirachi</strong>: Jirachi can take repeated hits from every set thanks to its bulk and recovery in Wish while also being able to break through Reuniclus with Iron Head flinches or even pivot its strong teammates in safely to overwhelm it with U-turn. However, Calm Mind variants with Thunder can break through it with paralysis, and it can get overwhelmed if Reuniclus has boosted too many times or it's been worn down.</p> <p><strong>Anti-Setup Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Trick Latios, Taunt Jellicent, Perish Song Celebi and Politoed, and Encore Alakazam and Politoed keep Calm Mind variants under control.

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunder hits common Water-types like Politoed, Slowking, Jellicent, and Starmie as well as Skarmory super effectively and has generally good coverage against other other common Pokemon like Heatran and Tyranitar. It can also paralyze, giving Reuniclus a way to punish switch-ins. Hidden Power Ice makes Reuniclus one of the best answers to Gliscor and hits other Ground- and Dragon-types like Garchomp, Landorus-T, Latios, and Dragonite. Focus Blast beats many common switch-ins like Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Heatran while threatening Ferrothorn and Skarmory more immediately so they can't set up entry hazards when Reuniclus isn't boosted. It also hits neutral targets quite hard, giving Reuniclus a good midground move to use. Psyshock is an option to let Reuniclus more confidently win Calm Mind wars against users like Latias and better threaten specially bulky Pokemon like Volcarona, Rotom-W, and Chansey.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Defense investment is preferred for checking physical attackers properly and better taking Pursuit. A set with more Special Defense investment can be considered to better handle Pokemon like Latios, Alakazam running Signal Beam or Shadow Ball, Magnezone, and mixed Garchomp. Life Orb can be run over Leftovers with Psyshock to more easily beat other Calm Mind Reuniclus, but dropping Leftovers generally leaves Reuniclus too easily pressured.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Calm Mind Reuniclus fits on sand teams because they enjoy it checking Fighting- and Ground-types and Alakazam while it appreciates the sand and entry hazards wearing down its switch-ins. Tyranitar sets sand, gets up Stealth Rock, and Pursuit traps Pokemon that can keep Reuniclus from sweeping, like Choice Scarf Latios, Encore Alakazam, Perish Song Celebi, and opposing Reuniclus. It can also take out or weaken Steel-types with coverage moves. Ferrothorn and Skarmory set up Spikes to wear down most of Reuniclus's common switch-ins, like Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Heatran. Ferrothorn switches into Dragon-types like Latios and Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Superpower as well as Water-types like Starmie and Politoed. It also provides further support with Stealth Rock and Knock Off and appreciates Reuniclus checking Fighting-types like Terrakion and Breloom. Skarmory checks offensive Ground-types like Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Garchomp as well as Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Scizor. Reuniclus works very well alongside other Psychic-types because they can overwhelm their shared switch-ins, mainly Tyranitar, Heatran, and Ferrothorn. As such, Alakazam and Latios are fantastic partners because they have a better matchup against offensive teams that Reuniclus can sometimes get overwhelmed by. Focus Sash Alakazam can revenge kill most Pokemon and punish opposing Reuniclus with Encore. Latios switches into Water-, Grass-, and Electric-types like Keldeo, Celebi, and Thundurus-T, with Colbur Berry Latios being particularly good at wearing down shared checks by forcing entry hazard damage with Roar. Gliscor can provide Stealth Rock and Knock Off to wear down Pokemon so Reuniclus can break through them. Gastrodon checks Fire-, Electric-, and Water-types like Heatran, Thundurus-T, and Rotom-W while spreading Toxic to help Reuniclus break through bulky targets. Excadrill pressures opposing Reuniclus and checks Electric- and Dragon-types while appreciating Reuniclus countering Fighting-types and Gliscor if running Hidden Power Ice. Landorus-T can set Stealth Rock and pivot Reuniclus in safely with U-turn. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock, spread status, check Dragon- and Steel-types like Latios and Ferrothorn, and wear down Tyranitar while benefitting from Reuniclus taking on Fighting- and Psychic-types like Terrakion, Alakazam, and Breloom. Fighting-types like Keldeo and Terrakion can take out Steel-types and Tyranitar while also wearing down various other Pokemon so Reuniclus can more easily sweep. Rotom-W checks Water-types like Keldeo and Starmie, pivots Reuniclus in safely with Volt Switch, matches up well into Steel-types, and burns Pokemon to make Reuniclus more likely to overwhelm them.</p>"

      "3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set distinguishes itself from the Calm Mind set thanks to its more immediate power and ability to pressure opposing sand and rain teams thanks to its defensive profile letting it come in on Pokemon like Tentacruel and Ferrothorn. Focus Blast beats many common switch-ins like Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Heatran while also breaking through Ferrothorn and Skarmory. It also hits neutral targets quite hard, giving Reuniclus a good midground move to use. Hidden Power Ice makes Reuniclus one of the best answers to every Gliscor set while also hitting other Ground- and Dragon-types like Latios, Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Dragonite and having good neutral coverage. Signal Beam hits Psychic- and Dark-types like Latios, opposing Reuniclus, Slowking, Starmie, and Tyranitar in one slot, making it a another good midground move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread lets Reuniclus take Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor. 192 HP and 64 Defense can be used to avoid being 2HKOed by Choice Band Terrakion's Close Combat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sand teams enjoy 3 attacks Reuniclus's more immediate offensive prowess for breaking through opposing sand and rain teams and it checking Fighting-types and Alakazam. Tyranitar sets sand, gets up Stealth Rock, and Pursuit traps Psychic-types like Alakazam, Latios, and opposing Reuniclus. It can also take out or weaken Steel-types with coverage moves. Ferrothorn and Skarmory set up Spikes to wear down most of Reuniclus's common switch-ins, like Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Heatran. Ferrothorn switches into Dragon-types like Latios and Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Superpower as well as Water-types like Starmie and Politoed. It also provides further support with Stealth Rock and Knock Off and appreciates Reuniclus checking Fighting-types like Terrakion and Breloom. Reuniclus works very well alongside other Psychic-types because they can overwhelm their shared switch-ins, mainly Tyranitar, Heatran, and Ferrothorn. As such, Alakazam and Latios are fantastic partners because they have a better matchup against offensive teams that Reuniclus can sometimes get overwhelmed by. Focus Sash Alakazam can revenge kill most Pokemon, punish opposing Reuniclus with Encore, and enjoys Reuniclus wallbreaking for it. Latios switches into Water-, Grass-, and Electric-types like Keldeo, Celebi, and Thundurus-T and sweeps late-game with a Choice Scarf set. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock, spread status, and check Dragon- and Steel-types like Latios and Ferrothorn while benefitting from Reuniclus breaking Pokemon that check it like Tentacruel and Politoed. Fighting-types like Keldeo and Terrakion can take out Steel-types and Tyranitar while also wearing down various other Pokemon, while Reuniclus can check Psychic-types like Alakazam and opposing Reuniclus for them. Gliscor can provide Stealth Rock and Knock Off to wear down Pokemon so Reuniclus can break through them more easily. Gastrodon checks Fire-, Electric-, and Water-types like Heatran, Thundurus-T, and Rotom-W while spreading Toxic to help Reuniclus break through bulky targets. Excadrill pressures opposing Reuniclus and checks Electric- and Dragon-types while appreciating Reuniclus countering Fighting-types and Gliscor if running Hidden Power Ice. Landorus-T can set Stealth Rock and pivot Reuniclus in safely with U-turn. Rotom-W can pivot Reuniclus in safely with Volt Switch, check Water- and Steel-types like Keldeo and Heatran, and burn opposing Pokemon.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room flips the script on offensive teams trying to overwhelm Reuniclus with their power and higher Speed. Focus Blast beats many common switch-ins like Tyranitar, Excadrill, Scizor, and Ferrothorn and hits neutral targets quite hard, giving Reuniclus a good midground move to use. Hidden Power Ice hits Ground- and Dragon-types like Gliscor, Garchomp, Latios, Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Salamence. Signal Beam is another good midground move that hits Psychic- and Dark-types like Latios, opposing Reuniclus, Slowking, Starmie, and Tyranitar in one slot, which is important to get the most out of Trick Room. Recover lets Reuniclus play defense and get more chances to set up Trick Room multiple times. However, it leaves Reuniclus wanting for coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Choice Band Terrakion's Choice Combat while maximizing power. A spread of 208 HP / 200 SpA / 100 SpD can be used for tanking Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits well on weatherless teams due to it being able to strongly threaten offensive teams that can overwhelm them, mainly rain teams. Magnezone is a key member of this team style, trapping Steel-types like Skarmory and Jirachi lacking U-turn so Reuniclus can get the most out of its Trick Room turns and avoid risking Focus Blast. Jirachi sets up Stealth Rock so Reuniclus is more easily able to KO its targets so it can make the most out of Trick Room's limited turns while also safely pivoting it in with U-turn so it can more easily set up Trick Room against threats that 2HKO it, like Garchomp and Alakazam packing Shadow Ball or Signal Beam. It can also take strong attacks from Pokemon that overwhelm Reuniclus, like Latios, Tyranitar, and Dragonite. Powerful Dragon-type wallbreakers like Choice Specs Latios, Dragonite, and Kyurem-B fit on these teams, weakening the opposition so Reuniclus can sweep in one attempt. Choice Scarf variants of Garchomp and Latios provide a safety net against offensive teams so Reuniclus isn't the only way to defeat them. Dragonite similarly helps against offensive teams with Pokemon that can break past Reuniclus to sweep like Volcarona thanks to its strong Extreme Speed and ability to take advantage of the holes Reuniclus breaks with Dragon Dance. Offensive Starmie wears down Pokemon like Tyranitar, Jirachi, Politoed, Ferrothorn, and Jellicent so Reuniclus can more easily break through them. Swords Dance Scizor appreciates Reuniclus threatening rain teams and can set up on Tyranitar to sweep through the aggressive offensive teams that can keep Reuniclus from setting up. Volcarona enjoys Reuniclus wearing down switch-ins like Tyranitar, Heatran, and Jellicent.</p>"

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<p>Amoonguss is a decent pivot in BW OU thanks to its solid typing and defensive stats alongside its ability to recover HP every time it switches out thanks to Regenerator. Due to this combination, it is a solid switch-in to Pokemon such as Keldeo, Breloom, Politoed, Rotom-W, and Thundurus-T. Unfortunately, Amoonguss is held back by its susceptibility to entry hazards and its passivity making it fodder for setup sweepers and entry hazard setters, and it is a big momentum drain as well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Specially defensive EV spreads can be used to better handle Pokemon such as Keldeo and Thundurus-T, but they compromise Amoonguss's ability to deal with Breloom, Landorus-T, and the like. Worry Seed is an option that allows Amoonguss to pressure Pokemon such as Gliscor and Reuniclus, but its situational nature makes it very hard to justify over Amoonguss's other moves, all of which are important. Toxic would work well in conjunction with the sand that is usually present with Amoonguss, but most of Amoonguss's switch-ins are Steel-types, rendering it useless against them. Venoshock can be used to OHKO most Breloom but is generally useless in most other matchups. Protect allows Amoonguss to scout Choice item users, but it takes up a valuable moveslot and does nothing to mitigate Amoonguss's passivity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types do not take much damage from Amoonguss and can deal heavy damage to it in Heatran's case or set up entry hazards in Ferrothorn's and Skarmory's cases. Ferrothorn can also remove Amoonguss's Black Sludge with Knock Off, which means it can be worn down quickly with sand up. Jirachi can set up a Substitute or Stealth Rock against Amoonguss and use Wish to recover health or support its teammates. Scizor also does not mind Amoonguss most of the time, but it does fear Hidden Power Fire, as do other Steel-types to a lesser extent.</p> <p><strong>Gliscor</strong>: Specially defensive Gliscor can withstand Hidden Power Ice and doesn't mind anything else that Amoonguss can throw at it, notably blocking Stun Spore with its Toxic Orb, although uninvested Gliscor does take significant damage from Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Alakazam and Reuniclus can threaten to KO Amoonguss. Reuniclus is particularly problematic, as it does not mind paralysis too much, can comfortably stomach any attack Amoonguss throws at it, and can even set up if Amoonguss lacks Clear Smog.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers like Latios and Tornadus, provided they switch in against the correct move, can threaten to OHKO Amoonguss and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types such as Latios, Dragonite, and Garchomp can force Amoonguss out and take little from most of its moves aside from Hidden Power Ice, but they need to be wary of Stun Spore.</p> <p><strong>Volcarona</strong>: Volcarona resists Giga Drain and Hidden Power Ice, takes little from Hidden Power Fire and Clear Smog, and can shrug off a Sludge Bomb poison or Stun Spore with Lum Berry. This means that it can set up in Amoonguss's face and threaten to sweep.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stun Spore allows Amoonguss to cripple Pokemon such as Latios, Excadrill, and Terrakion on the switch and open the door for slower wallbreakers to blow holes in the opposing team. In particular, it can absolutely ruin Pokemon such as Latios that can generally take a hit from Amoonguss otherwise. However, it only has 75% accuracy, which can be game changing on occasion. Giga Drain allows Amoonguss to beat threats such as Keldeo and Politoed, and it conveniently can help Amoonguss recover HP when sand is up, which is expected because Amoonguss often ends up on sand teams. The choice of Hidden Power is relatively team dependent. Hidden Power Ice is generally the preferred option, as it hits Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor very hard and does non-negligible damage to Latios and Thundurus-T, making it more difficult for them to come in and force Amoonguss out. Hidden Power Fire is an option, however, if pressuring Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Excadrill, and the rare Scizor helps the team more, but it doesn't hit much else and is weakened in rain to the point where it is best to switch out anyway. Sludge Bomb is recommended in the last slot as a stronger STAB move that can poison switch-ins, making it a good general purpose move, and it most notably does major damage to Breloom, which Amoonguss is often tasked with handling. Clear Smog is another option that makes Amoonguss better at handling Pokemon such as Swords Dance Breloom, Calm Mind Keldeo, and Calm Mind Reuniclus, but it is less useful than Sludge Bomb in most matchups. In addition, Clear Smog must never be used alongside Hidden Power Fire, as such a set allows free Substitutes for Thundurus-T and Dragon-types such as Dragonite.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Regenerator lets Amoonguss stick around over the course of long games. The EVs are placed in Defense to make Amoonguss a better check to Breloom and an acceptable switch-in to Pokemon such as Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Amoonguss is best used to switch into Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Breloom and force them out while spreading paralysis. Depending on its moveset, it can also come into Pokemon like Gliscor and Landorus-T and pressure them. Amoonguss's presence can also force mindgames against Terrakion, but it does not want to come in on Stone Edge. One must be careful when dealing with Ferrothorn because of Knock Off, which removes the Black Sludge Amoonguss needs to compensate for its vulnerability to all types of entry hazards, which are very widespread in BW, and sand, which is problematic because Amoonguss is most often used on sand teams. Be careful when playing against Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Heatran when not running Hidden Power Fire, as Amoonguss lets them switch in relatively freely, allowing them to set up entry hazards, set up a Substitute, or fire off a threatening attack like Lava Plume or Brave Bird. Jirachi can also use Wish freely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rapid Spin support from Excadrill and Starmie is very helpful, as Amoonguss is still quite vulnerable to entry hazards despite Regenerator. In return, Amoonguss can spread paralysis, making it easier for Excadrill to break down the opposing team and switch into Pokemon like Keldeo that threaten it. Tyranitar is a good partner, as Amoonguss can handle Pokemon such as Keldeo and Breloom that threaten it, and Tyranitar can in turn handle Latios, Alakazam, and Reuniclus. Magnezone is an excellent teammate, as it can remove the Steel-types that otherwise switch into standard Amoonguss freely. Keldeo threatens Pokemon such as Heatran and appreciates Amoonguss's ability to paralyze its faster checks like Latios and Tornadus. Heatran threatens many of the entry hazard setters in BW OU and has excellent defensive synergy with Amoonguss. Slowbro and Slowking also have good synergy with Amoonguss, notably forming a Regenerator core to keep both Pokemon healthy throughout the game. Slowking, or another bulky Water-type like Rotom-W, Gastrodon, or Jellicent, is also helpful because Amoonguss is not capable of beating Keldeo under rain on its own. Pokemon that generally appreciate the paralysis support Amoonguss provides, such as Dragonite, Garchomp, Terrakion, Mamoswine, Gliscor, and Reuniclus, make good teammates as well.</p>"

  "Jellicent": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its stat distribution, typing, and Water Absorb, Jellicent stands out as one of the best answers to rain offense in BW OU. It is one of the only good spinblockers in the tier, alongside the more fringe Gengar, shutting down Rapid Spin attempts from Tentacruel, Mold Breaker Excadrill, and non-Life Orb Starmie. With Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, and base 60 Speed, Jellicent can shut down Ferrothorn, Politoed, Gastrodon, Seismitoad, Chansey, Forretress, and Skarmory while keeping bulky setup sweepers like Calm Mind Reuniclus and Swords Dance Scizor at bay. Jellicent is also able to check crucial offensive Pokemon such as Keldeo, Heatran, and Volcarona. However, Jellicent has no reliable way of curing status ailments, which can be problematic because most Pokemon it is meant to check, namely Tentacruel, Gastrodon, and to a lesser extent Heatran and Keldeo, run Toxic for it. Many of the aforementioned Pokemon, especially Starmie and Volcarona, often run Thunderbolt or Giga Drain as well. Finally, Jellicent faces significant competition as a rain check in Gastrodon and Seismitoad, as they are both immune to Electric as well as Water, which is crucial because Thundurus-T and Rotom-W often force Jellicent out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Protect allows Jellicent to scout for Toxic and Choice item users such as Latios, but it prefers Night Shade, which it needs to avoid becoming Taunt bait to opposing Jellicent. Scald prevents Heatran from freely coming in and absorbing Will-O-Wisp, and it better pressures Swords Dance Gliscor, but it's worse than Night Shade against Substitute users such as Tentacruel and Keldeo. Shadow Ball can be used to surprise an unsuspecting Starmie. An offensive set with Water Spout, Shadow Ball, Giga Drain, and Ice Beam, alongside Choice Specs, is possible, but Jellicent's mediocre Special Attack and Speed make this a very fringe option. Colbur Berry lets Jellicent survive Tyranitar's Crunch if it misses a Will-O-Wisp, but it generally wants an item that improves its overall longevity. Finally, Toxic and Hail aren't normally viable options, but they do disrupt momentum on opposing teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Poison and burn are easily Jellicent's biggest issues, as they put it on a timer and into KO range from opposing threats. Jellicent is also vulnerable to sand chip damage despite being so common on sand teams.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Choice Scarf Tyranitar can easily defeat Jellicent with a correctly predicted Crunch or Pursuit. However, standard utility Tyranitar must watch out for Will-O-Wisp. Scizor, while not having STAB Crunch in case Jellicent stays in, can use Pursuit if it's weakened. However, Scizor must also avoid getting burned as it comes in.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: While Rotom-W and Thundurus-T don't enjoy taking a burn on the switch, they can force Jellicent out. Rotom-W can use Jellicent to gain momentum through Volt Switch or burn it with Will-O-Wisp, while Thundurus-T can use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: While Ferrothorn doesn't enjoy taking a burn, it can threaten Jellicent with Power Whip or Knock Off. Meanwhile, if Ferrothorn is holding a Lum Berry or Rawst Berry, it doesn't mind absorbing burn once and can 2HKO Jellicent with Power Whip. Celebi has Natural Cure, so it doesn't mind taking Will-O-Wisp, and can either force Jellicent out with Giga Drain or use it to gain momentum through U-turn. If Poison Heal Breloom has Seed Bomb and its Toxic Orb activated prior, then it can freely pivot into Will-O-Wisp and use Jellicent as setup fodder. Technician Breloom can force Jellicent out with Bullet Seed, though it can't directly switch into a Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Magic Guard Users</strong>: Alakazam can pivot into a predicted Will-O-Wisp and force Jellicent out with Grass Knot or Shadow Ball, while Reuniclus can force it out with Thunder or Shadow Ball. However, Calm Mind Reuniclus cannot use Jellicent as setup fodder due to Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Excadrill</strong>: Sand Force Excadrill in sand is one of the few spinners that Jellicent cannot spinblock, always 2HKOing it with Earthquake. Moreover, an Iron Head into Earthquake can KO Jellicent if it attempts to pivot into a predicted Rapid Spin but predicts incorrectly. However, Excadrill can't switch into Jellicent directly without risking a burn.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: If Swords Dance Gliscor has Toxic Orb activated, it can freely switch into Jellicent's Will-O-Wisp and set up several Swords Dances; however, it needs to be wary of the occasional Scald. Agility Thundurus-T, Calm Mind Latios, and Calm Mind Jirachi don't enjoy taking burns but can overwhelm Jellicent.</p> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: While having to be wary of the rarer Scald or Shadow Ball, Xatu can punish Jellicent for using Will-O-Wisp or Taunt because of Magic Bounce, and it can heal Night Shade damage off with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Faster threats such as Garchomp, Terrakion, Latios, Landorus-T, and Tornadus can take advantage of Jellicent's vulnerability to entry hazards by forcing Jellicent out if it's been worn down.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Taunt and Will-O-Wisp are mandatory to shut down defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Politoed, Seismitoad, Gastrodon, and Skarmory. Taunt also denies Reuniclus from setting up Calm Mind and using Recover, letting Jellicent keep it at bay despite its immunity to burn damage. Further, Will-O-Wisp makes it difficult for offensive threats such as Latios, Thundurus-T, and Garchomp to switch in and force it out. Recover allows Jellicent to stay healthy throughout games, as sand negates its Leftovers recovery. Finally, Night Shade prevents Jellicent from being setup fodder for Substitute users such as Garchomp, Mamoswine, Dragonite, and Tornadus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread lets Jellicent outspeed specially defensive Rotom-W and maximizes its bulk against support Landorus-T and Scizor. Leftovers helps Jellicent's longevity because it is often used on sand balance; Air Balloon and Sitrus Berry can be used to spinblock Sand Force Excadrill once; and Eject Button is useful for hyper offensive teams against Life Orb Starmie.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jellicent does a very good job of spreading burns throughout games, especially against slower, bulkier teams. Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, and Recover are all very spammable, as it can be very difficult for opposing teams to force Jellicent out. When facing rain offense, the opposing Tentacruel or Politoed may run Toxic in an attempt to ruin Jellicent. If Jellicent gets in on a predicted Scald from Tentacruel, it's usually best to trade status, limiting Tentacruel's spinning capabilities. Politoed and Tentacruel will often use Protect after Jellicent is poisoned; use this opportunity to switch out into an offensive threat like Latios or Tyranitar that can pressure the opposing team. Against more offensive teams with Starmie, Jellicent can switch in on a predicted spin or sack itself to bring in a revenge killer like Alakazam, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, or Choice Scarf Landorus-T. This is especially effective if Jellicent has Eject Button.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jellicent does a fantastic job shutting down rain offense, so it is often seen on Psychic-type + Spikes sand teams and hyper offense teams with Skarmory. Skarmory switches into Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Sand Force Excadrill, while Jellicent can handle common rain threats such as Politoed, Keldeo, and Tentacruel for Skarmory. Ferrothorn can also work as a partner; however, the synergy isn't as solid due to its slightly worse matchup against Ground-types. Jellicent appreciates entry hazard support from Skarmory and Ferrothorn to pressure Pursuit Tyranitar and in return blocks Rapid Spin. Psychic-types such as Reuniclus, Alakazam, and Latios enjoy Jellicent's ability to wear down checks like Tyranitar, Skarmory, and bulky Water-types like Gastrodon, keeping entry hazards up by blocking Rapid Spin and pressuring them through Will-O-Wisp and Night Shade. If Jellicent has Eject Button, Alakazam and Choice Scarf Latios can come in and force Starmie out, thus denying any attempt for Starmie to spin. Tyranitar and Scizor can work with Jellicent to pressure Reuniclus through Taunt and Pursuit. Jellicent can also spinblock for Tyranitar's Stealth Rock. Gliscor and support Landorus-T can handle Tyranitar, Garchomp, and Excadrill for Jellicent, while Jellicent can cover Water-types like Tentacruel, Politoed, Keldeo, and Starmie. Landorus-T can bring Jellicent in against them with U-turn. Gliscor works well in particular; Jellicent can burn foes, letting Gliscor outlast them with Poison Heal, and Gliscor can pivot into Rotom's Will-O-Wisp for Jellicent. Eject Button Jellicent can take a hit from Starmie and switch into Choice Scarf Landorus-T to force it out, preventing Starmie from spinning. Excadrill is a spinner that can handle Tyranitar and sponge Latios's Draco Meteors, while Jellicent can deal with the aforementioned Water-types and burn Landorus-T and Skarmory for Excadrill. Excadrill and Jellicent make for a very solid pairing against Calm Mind Reuniclus, as Excadrill handles BoltBeam variants, while Jellicent handles Psychic and Focus Blast variants. Heatran and Jellicent together can completely shut down Volcarona, since Volcarona often has to choose between running Giga Drain and Hidden Power Ground. Poison Heal Breloom enjoys Jellicent handing Fire-types such as Volcarona and Heatran, while it handles Tyranitar for Jellicent.</p>"

However, it's mostly outclassed by the other Dragon-types in the tier such as Garchomp, Dragonite, Salamence, and especially Kyurem-B, as they are either faster or, in the case of Kyurem-B, stronger than Haxorus. They also all have a better defensive presence due to their better bulk and typings. Haxorus's meager defensive profile and middling Speed tier make it prone to being revenge killed by common offensive Pokemon like Latios, Garchomp, Keldeo, and Alakazam before setting up.

  "Mienshao": {
    "overview": "<p>Mienshao holds a small niche on sand teams with its Choice Scarf set due to its high Speed and good coverage, letting it revenge kill setup sweepers like Dragonite, Volcarona, and Salamence as well as slower Choice Scarf users like Garchomp and Tyranitar. This makes it quite good against hyper offense teams that rely a lot on these setup threats to get past sand teams and outspeed everything. It can also pivot around with U-turn to keep up momentum, which is especially good against bulkier teams that can take its hits it while recovering health as it does so with Regenerator, which mitigates the effects of residual damage from entry hazards and sand a bit. However, Mienshao struggles in the metagame due to its abysmal bulk that makes it hard to take even the weakest neutral attacks, being unable to break through common metagame staples like Skarmory, Reuniclus, and Tentacruel, and strong competition from other Choice Scarf users like Latios, Keldeo, and Garchomp as a result of their better defensive profile and ability to check similar threats. It also can't do much of anything against common rain teams due to their tendency to use multiple Pokemon with Protect, like Tentacruel, Politoed, and Jirachi, while the same is true for sand teams to a lesser degree with Pokemon like Jirachi and Gliscor. Other Fighting-types in Keldeo, Breloom, and Terrakion also outclass it a lot of the time due to being stronger, having more set versatility, and fitting on more team styles than it.</p>",

  "Hydreigon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hydreigon carves out a decent niche as a strong special attacker thanks to its great STAB moves and incredible coverage. Hydreigon also has some good defensive utility thanks to its decent bulk, immunity to Ground, Psychic, and Spikes, and resistance to common moves like Scald, Hydro Pump, Volt Switch, and Pursuit. Its Pursuit resistance and better coverage give it a niche over the often superior Latios, better defeating bulkier sand teams that rely on Pursuit Tyranitar to remove wallbreaking threats. However, Hydreigon is outpaced and forced out by very common offensive Pokemon like Latios, Keldeo, Alakazam, Garchomp, and Terrakion. This is made worse by Hydreigon's weaknesses to their common attacks like Draco Meteor, Focus Blast, Outrage, and Hidden Power Ice, as well as priority moves like Ice Shard and Mach Punch. It can't fit all of Dark Pulse, Focus Blast, and Roost, which means it will either lack crucial coverage or the sustainability to wallbreak throughout the game. Lacking Roost can especially hurt due to the residual damage Hydreigon takes from sand, Life Orb, and burns. Latios outclasses Hydreigon a lot of the time due to its better defensive utility in checking Pokemon like Keldeo, Thundurus-T, and Breloom, better Speed tier to outpace Pokemon like Garchomp, Terrakion, Volcarona, and Keldeo, and greater set versatility on varying team archetypes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf with a Timid nature and U-turn can make Hydreigon a pivoting revenge killer that can bring more powerful teammates in. Unfortunately, it is outclassed by Latios, which outspeeds +2 Dragonite and Choice Scarf Keldeo. Choice Scarf Keldeo and Garchomp also outclass Hydreigon for similar reasons. Expert Belt can be used to avoid Life Orb recoil and still get a power boost against Pokemon Hydreigon hits super effectively. However, it sacrifices the power boost Draco Meteor needs to really threaten targets like Gliscor, Rotom-W, and Politoed. To mitigate the loss of power, Expert Belt must be used with a Modest nature. Earth Power can be run over Focus Blast or Fire Blast to hit all of Heatran, Tentacruel, Excadrill, Jirachi, and Tyranitar in one moveslot. However, it misses out on hitting Ferrothorn and Skarmory sufficiently while also not hitting Tyranitar hard enough to adequetly threaten sand teams. Taunt can be used over Dark Pulse to punish passive Pokemon like Jellicent, Reuniclus, Gastrodon, and Ferrothorn at the expense of a reliable STAB move. Substitute can be considered over Dark Pulse with Expert Belt to let Hydreigon punish switches, evade status, and lessen prediction. However, it has the same issue as Taunt while also making it easy for Pokemon like Gastrodon and Jellicent to take advantage of Hydreigon, since they can recover on Draco Meteor and leave it with lost health from Substitute and nothing to show for it. Superpower may seem like a good option to hit the same targets as Focus Blast while also doing solid damage to Chansey, but it's inferior to Focus Blast against everything besides Chansey.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Keldeo, Volcarona, Starmie, Latios, Garchomp, Terrakion, and Alakazam can OHKO Hydreigon and force it out. This is an even bigger issue against offensive teams, which put a lot of these threats together, leaving Hydreigon unable to make much progress against them. However, they cannot switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn contributes to chip damage from sand and Life Orb, and a lot of the Pokemon Hydreigon is meant to switch into like Tentacruel, Politoed, Rotom-W, and Jellicent can easily inflict it with burn. Poison has the same effect, while paralysis cutting Hydreigon's Speed makes it nearly useless. However, burn and poison damage can be mitigated if running Roost.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon like Chople Berry Tyranitar and Chansey can take Hydreigon's hits, with Tyranitar able to punish it with Superpower or Thunder Wave, and Chansey running the same debilitating status. However, Tyranitar lacks reliable recovery and can't switch in more than once, while Chansey is rare due to stall being an uncommon archetype.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran fears Focus Blast, but it can otherwise switch into Hydreigon and set up Stealth Rock or cripple it with Toxic.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast OHKOes or 2HKOes every Steel-type besides Heatran. Dark Pulse is a reliable STAB option that hits Psychic-types like Reuniclus and Slowking super effectively and can beat shakier checks like Gastrodon with its flinch chance, while Dragon Pulse boasts higher overall power. Focus Blast nails Heatran and hits Tyranitar much harder than any other move, making Hydreigon better able to threaten sand teams. Roost heals residual damage and gives Hydreigon better sustainability to take on the bulky sand and rain teams it's meant to threaten. Roost can be run with both Fire Blast and Focus Blast by dropping Dark Pulse, but this leaves Hydreigon lacking a spammable STAB move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Modest is largely preferred over Timid for damaging the Pokemon Hydreigon is meant to threaten, like Tyranitar, Rotom-W, Gliscor, Heatran, and Politoed. However, Timid can be used if your team really needs Hydreigon to outspeed Pokemon like Kyurem, Modest Thundurus-T, and Jolly Excadrill. Life Orb gets many important 2HKOs and OHKOs. Choice Specs can be used instead with Draco Meteor, Dark Pulse, Fire Blast, and Focus Blast to make Hydreigon even more powerful while avoiding Life Orb recoil. However, it lets Protect Pokemon commonly found on sand teams scout Hydreigon and easily play around it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should aim to come in on resisted and weak attacks from Pokemon like Reuniclus, Gliscor, Tyranitar, Rotom-W, Politoed, and Jellicent. Will-O-Wisp is a particularly common entry point, since Hydreigon often forces out its users. Roost Hydreigon should attempt to stay healthy throughout the game against bulkier sand and rain teams, which it can pivot around and threaten, while it can be used less conservatively against offensive teams because it won't be able to switch in as consistently. Against Pokemon that Hydreigon cannot OHKO and have recovery, such as Gastrodon, Tentacruel in rain, and Hippowdon, try to wear them down with other attacks, mainly Dark Pulse, to get them into KO range of Draco Meteor.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hydreigon fits well on offensive teams thanks to it heavily threatening sand teams. As a teammate, sand staple Chople Berry Tyranitar can set up Stealth Rock and Pursuit trap Latios and Alakazam. Psychic-types like Alakazam and Reuniclus can pressure Fighting-types, form a Spikes-immune core with Hydreigon, and benefit from Hydreigon denting their checks like Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Celebi. Alakazam also brings a good matchup against offensive Pokemon like Latios, Keldeo, Terrakion, and Volcarona. Steel-type entry hazard setters like Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Jirachi support Hydreigon and switch into Dragon-type moves. Skarmory can also pivot into opposing Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T, while Ferrothorn can act as a sturdier answer to Water-types like Starmie. Heatran can spread status with Toxic to further wear down Hydreigon's switch-ins while better pivoting into Ice-type moves from Pokemon like Rotom-W and and Thundurus-T. Specially defensive Jirachi can use Wish to give Hydreigon more longevity while taking Dragon- and Ice-type moves like Heatran. Hydreigon appreciates pivot support from Pokemon like Landorus-T, Jirachi, and Rotom-W to get in on its desired targets safely, and their attacks wear down foes for it. Water-types like Keldeo, Jellicent, and Rotom-W check Volcarona and Heatran and enjoy Hydreigon threatening Grass-types like Celebi and Ferrothorn. Keldeo helps handle hyper offense teams, namely handling Scizor, Dragonite, and boosted Cloyster while Hydreigon wears down Rotom-W and Celebi. Terrakion and Mamoswine similarly threaten hyper offense threats and can wallbreak alongside Hydreigon.</p>"

  "Terrakion": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>As part of the new legendary foursome (don't forget PONY, people!), Terrakion boasts a unique type combination and some pretty beastly base stats to take advantage of it offensively. The great type coverage granted by its STAB moves alone essentially allows Terrakion to do whatever it wants with its last two moveslots. Because of these factors, Terrakion can be one of the best stat-boosters in the game, one of the best Choice Band users in the game, or one of the best revenge killers in the game when equipped with a Choice Scarf. With this offensive diversity, Terrakion is one of the best offensive threats in the game that every team should be prepared for, and everyone should consider using.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>I'm sure you've already looked through Terrakion's moveset and thought, \"Whoa it learns Calm Mind!\" Yes, yes it does learn Calm Mind. It's arguably Terrakion's best set; however, for some reason, the Quality Control guys won't let me list it first in this analysis. In a similar (and more serious!) vein, Terrakion also learns Work Up. The only use for it would be to lure Gliscor into a +1 Hidden Power Ice. The problem with that idea is that using Work Up as your opponent switches to Gliscor is a dead giveaway that you're rocking Hidden Power Ice. If you want Terrakion to act as a Gliscor lure, you're much better just pumping a ton of EVs into Special Attack so that it doesn't see it coming until it's already dead. Terrakion can also make use of Protect on some sets, which can be used to scout against Choice-locked Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Scizor; however, in order to use this, it sacrifices an important moveslot for a move that is only useful in a niche situation, and as such Protect is usually inferior to Terrakion's standard options.</p> <p>Terrakion also learns Taunt, which obviously makes a Taunt/Swords Dance set an option. However, most of Terrakion's counters are simply going to attack it straight up, meaning there are very few situations in which Taunt would be anywhere near useful. Maybe against Skarmory I guess? Yeah, that makes sense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>If there was an award in OU for \"most difficult Pokemon to switch into,\" here's your winner. Slowbro is probably the best check you'll find in OU, although a Stone Edge boosted by a Choice Band or a Swords Dance boost will hit like a truck. Gliscor and Landorus-T are also good checks, though they will be taking a ton from Stone Edge from those sets. Mew, Reuniclus and Jellicent also fall into the similar category. There is light at the end of the tunnel though; Terrakion needs to hit two consecutive Stone Edges to KO any of these Pokemon. Hippowdon can also tank a hit and Slack Off. You may be inclined to use Skarmory as your Terrakion counter, but despite its good Defense, Skarmory is ravaged by a Close Combat from the Choice Band or Swords Dance set, allowing it to only deal with Terrakion that lack Attack boosts.</p> <p>Terrakion can be hard to check because of its great Speed. Scizor and Azumarill are two Choice Band users that can stop any Terrakion set dead in its tracks with their STAB priority attacks. Infernape can also do a good chunk of damage with Mach Punch; Conkeldurr can do the same and can also, at high health, survive a non-boosted Close Combat and go for the OHKO with Drain Punch after Stealth Rock. Latios and Tornadus can outspeed and hit Terrakion hard with Psyshock or Hurricane, respectively. Gengar and Starmie can smash it with Focus Blast and Hydro Pump, while Espeon can hit it hard with Psychic. Gengar deserves a special mention because it can Disable Stone Edge, crippling Terrakion instantly. Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-W and other Terrakion are also fantastic checks.</p> <p>Ironically, Terrakion's best counters litter the lower tiers, with examples being Golurk, Nidoqueen, Claydol, and Tangrowth. If you're feeling desperate, then one of these is your best bet.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Stop me if I'm talking too much about how great Terrakion's offensive typing is, but the Choice Band set truly exemplifies just how fantastic its STAB moves really are. Choice Band Terrakion essentially boils down to, \"Click its appropriate STAB for the situation and watch things take massive amounts of damage.\" Additional factors, such as great Speed, a resistance to Stealth Rock, and solid bulk make Terrakion arguably the best Choice Band user in the OU metagame.</p> <p>Because Terrakion's STAB moves are just so balling, the last two moves in the set serve very limited functions. X-Scissor hits the bulky Psychic-types a bit harder than Stone Edge does, while also having the upside of being 100% accurate. Sacred Sword is a solid option in the fourth moveslot for situations in which you want to use your Fighting-type STAB without being forced to lower Terrakion's defenses. Quick Attack, normally a terrible option on just about everything that learns it, is somewhat viable on Terrakion. Because Terrakion doesn't need a coverage move in that last slot, Quick Attack becomes a solid situational, last-resort move if you need to knock that last 15% off Latios.</p> <p>Earthquake is extremely redundant with Close Combat, but it nails a couple things slightly harder and doesn't lower your defenses. However, because Choice-locked Earthquake without STAB is generally a terrible option, you're often better off with Sacred Sword as your situational move of choice; that or either Double Kick can be favorable aiding against threats like Focus Sash Mamoswine and those behind a Substitute. Rock Slide is also a viable option, as it allows you to take advantage of a more accurate Rock-type STAB that can fish for a flinch if you ever need one.</p> <p>Generally, an Adamant nature is ill-advised on any Terrakion set that doesn't have Rock Polish since it means you will be outpaced by a large number of threats (as well as losing the speed tie with Virizion and Infernape). But on Choice Band Terrakion, the extra power can be very welcome against Pokemon such as Gliscor and Slowbro.</p> <p>The same Pokemon that pair up well with the Double Boosting set also pair well with Choice Band Terrakion. In this case, however, Terrakion is generally best suited as the Pokemon that does the damage necessary to open holes in the opponent's team. The sheer damage that even bulkier Pokemon like Gliscor take from Terrakion's STAB moves make it nearly impossible for those defensive Pokemon to stay around long enough to wall the subsequent Landorus-T.</p>"
      },
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Due to the popularity of Terrakion's Choice sets, many of its checks and counters often rely on it being locked into one move. With this set, Terrakion is able defeat these Pokemon by using either its STAB attacks or coverage moves. Close Combat and Stone Edge function as Terrakion's bread-and-butter STAB moves, getting nearly unresisted coverage in the OU tier. Hidden Power Ice is a key coverage move in Terrakion's arsenal, 2HKOing its two primary counters, Landorus-T and Gliscor, as well as OHKOing a weakened Dragonite or Salamence without risking a miss with Stone Edge. Earthquake is primarily used to hit Toxicroak, Tentacruel, and Jirachi for super effective damage. However, Protect allows Terrakion to scout against revenge killers, most notably Scizor and Breloom.</p> <p>X-Scissor is Terrakion's most powerful attack against Psychic-types such as Latias, Latios, and Celebi. However, a super effective X-Scissor is only slightly more powerful than a STAB Stone Edge, and oftentimes, the Pokemon that Terrakion would want to hit with X-Scissor are faster and carry a super effective attack, reducing X-Scissor's overall utility. Despite its low Base Power, Quick Attack is an option to defeat extremely weakened Pokemon that are either faster or carry a super effective priority move. Substitute is an option over either Earthquake or Protect, as it allows Terrakion to capitalize on the switches it forces and defeat faster Pokemon by using either its STAB attacks or Hidden Power Ice. However, Substitute in tandem with Life Orb recoil will wear down Terrakion relatively quickly, making it a mediocre option in comparison to Protect. Terrakion can also utilize an Expert Belt to bluff a choice item and function as an even better lure for Landorus-T and Gliscor; However, the extra power boost that Life Orb provides is generally more useful.</p> <p>Because this set lacks the power of Terrakion's Choice Band set, entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Skarmory and Forretress is recommended. Due to Terrakion's ability to lure and defeat Gliscor and Landorus-T, Dragon Dance Dragonite, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Swords Dance Lucario are exceptional partners. Due to Terrakion's weakness to common priority, such as Bullet Punch and Mach Punch from Scizor and Breloom, respectively, Pokemon that can defeat these priority users, such as Thundurus-T, Zapdos, and Volcarona are also excellent partners. Keldeo is another excellent partner, as Terrakion is able to defeat nearly every one of Keldeo's counters, allowing the pony to sweep later in the game.</p>"
      },
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<p>While other Terrakion sets are more focused towards sweeping and punching holes, this set focuses more on supporting its teammates by setting up Stealth Rock. Terrakion makes for an excellent user of Stealth Rock due to the many switches it forces with its heralded STAB moves. This Terrakion set is best used in the lead position, as it can get up Stealth Rock right off the bat and threatens common weather inducing and entry hazard-setting leads. With Taunt, it can also stop most setup sweepers that might choose to lead in their tracks. Another reason why Terrakion is an excellent user of Stealth Rock is that it can beat a common spinner—Forretress—as well as Espeon and Xatu which reflect Stealth Rock and Taunt. Very few Stealth Rock users can beat Espeon and Xatu, so this is a major advantage over other users. In addition, Terrakion is pretty much the only Stealth Rock user not named Tyranitar that is legitimately threatening to sun teams and their most common methods of preventing Stealth Rock from being set up, namely Forretress and Xatu. Stone Edge and Close Combat hit most of a sun team for heavy damage and Stealth Rock is a pain for Fire-types such as Volcarona, Victini, and Ninetales on said teams. Terrakion is also not setup bait for opposing entry hazard setters, unlike Ferrothorn and Forretress. Swords Dance can be used over Taunt to bluff one of the more traditional Terrakion sets and to provide immediate pressure in the lead position and later in the game after Stealth Rock has already been set up. As a final note, Stealth Rock Terrakion is often unexpected, which gives it more opportunity to set it up.</p> <p>The EVs are fairly obvious, with maximum investment in both Attack and Speed for Terrakion to function as efficiently as possible. A Jolly nature is used to best utilize Terrakion's high Speed stat, but an Adamant nature is an option, allowing Terrakion to always OHKO standard Breloom. However, this would cause Terrakion to be slower than other Terrakion, Keldeo, and other Pokemon with 95 base Speed or above that choose to run positive natures, as well as making it impossible to test whether opposing Salamence are using a Choice Scarf or not with Terrakion's Focus Sash, but it is often worth the trade-off should one desire Terrakion to hit harder. Speaking of Focus Sash, it guarantees the setup of Stealth Rock in the lead position and allows Terrakion to stay in and go for the KO on opposing Starmie and Jolteon, among other Pokemon that outspeed it.</p> <p>Where other move options are concerned, there are two that can boost Terrakion's effectiveness in certain situations. Substitute can be used to allow Terrakion to beat every common spinner, including Forretress, Starmie, and Tentacruel. In that case, a Stone Plate may be used to boost the power of Stone Edge or a Fist Plate to boost the power of Close Combat due to the fact that Substitute makes Focus Sash unusable. However, Focus Sash already does this and more, so Substitute is very niche and usually less effective than Focus Sash + Taunt. X-Scissor is an option to OHKO Celebi, but its use would be solely for that purpose and so is not recommended unless one's team has trouble with Celebi.</p> <p>In the realm of support, there is nothing mandatory as Terrakion does very well as a standalone Pokemon. However, there are many optional forms of support that are beneficial to Terrakion. A spinblocker, such as Gengar, Jellicent, or Sableye, is helpful because Terrakion will have trouble setting up Stealth Rock multiple times due to its reliance on Focus Sash. Toxic Spikes support may be helpful if one wants Terrakion to beat bulky Water-types, with the two best users being Tentacruel and Forretress. There are many Pokemon that partner well with Terrakion thanks to its overwhelming power and utility. Since this Terrakion is a nightmare for sun teams, Tyranitar loves it as a partner, freeing up a moveslot for another coverage move and in return providing a 50% boost to Terrakion's Special Defense. Dragonite boasts excellent defensive synergy with Terrakion and enjoys Stealth Rock not being set up as well as having Ferrothorn removed. Latias is in the same boat as Dragonite and always beats Starmie, a major threat to Terrakion if its Focus Sash is already broken. Politoed enjoys the fact that Terrakion can remove its two most common rival weather inducers, Tyranitar and Ninetales, both of which hinder Politoed and its teammates. Lastly, it should be mentioned that every team pretty much requires Stealth Rock in one way or another, and Terrakion is an amazing user of it.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Besides Gliscor, Slowbro, Landorus-T, and a few obscure counters that struggle to reach even 2% usage in OU, the only way to deal with Terrakion is through status or revenge killing. Now, imagine if it had a way to get around status users and revenge killers--that would be a sight to behold wouldn't it? If this behemoth managed to set up, the opponent would surely be stuck between a rock and a hard place. Well, why are you still imagining? Substitute + Swords Dance Terrakion does just that! With Substitute, the terracotta warrior can now block those ever so annoying Thunder Waves, Will-O-Wisps, and Toxics. Furthermore, Substitute acts as a buffer against annoying revenge killers, such as Alakazam and Starmie, who now must waste a turn breaking the Substitute, and are destroyed by a powerful STAB move in return. Most importantly, though, Terrakion is cushioned from priority moves, such as Scizor's Bullet Punch, and with its newly found fly swatter, can crush the red bug in cold blood.</p> <p>While Substitute is certainly the distinguishing move on this set, it is important to note that without Terrakion's fantastic stats, movepool, and offensive typing, this set wouldn't be nearly as effective. Swords Dance skyrockets Terrakion's Attack to terrifying levels. Even Gliscor and Slowbro must think twice about coming in, because if they are damaged prior to the encounter, a +2 Stone Edge can still break through. Its Fighting- and Rock-type STAB combination provides fantastic coverage, resisted only by a select few lower-tier Pokemon. Close Combat is Arceus's gift to Fighting-types; backed by Terrakion's immense power, it is one of the most fearsome moves in the metagame. Stone Edge rounds off this brute's set, allowing it to barbarically tear apart opposing teams.</p> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment further oil this killing machine. A Jolly nature is preferred to Speed-tie with opposing base 108 Pokemon; with Substitute protecting Terrakion from potential revenge killers, you may fall to temptation and use an Adamant nature, but keep in mind that the longer you can preserve that Substitute, the more time you have to dismember your opponent's Pokemon. The extra power would certainly make Terrakion an even more formidable attacker, but being outsped by base 100 Pokemon is a real turn off. 4 Defense EVs rather than 4 HP EVs seems trivial at first, but 4 HP EVs give Terrakion 324 HP, which only allows it to make three Substitutes. You never know when a fourth Substitute can come in handy.</p> <p>Life Orb can be used to bluff a Double Dancer set, although Substitute and Life Orb recoil could build up very quickly. If you use Substitute conservatively though, this set will still serve you well. Leftovers can be used, although the element of surprise is key for this set, and Leftovers is a dead giveaway that you're running Substitute. Salac Berry trades Speed for power, giving Terrakion a +1 boost if it ever gets low on health. You can use this to your advantage by repeatedly using Substitute, though you have to make sure opposing Breloom, Lucario, and Scizor are removed first. In any case, Terrakion is so powerful that it could probably pull its weight even without an item, so don't fret too much about the choice of item.</p> <p>This set is incredibly self-sufficient, and doesn't need much in terms of support. However, it would be wise to pair it with another powerful physical attacker, such as Landorus-T or Lucario, to form a one-two punch. Wish support can come in handy, especially if using Life Orb, as Terrakion will often wear itself out with Substitute. Chansey and Blissey are ideal candidates, as they can also check troublesome Psychic-types, such as Starmie and Alakazam. Do keep in mind that Terrakion remains helpless against the likes of Scizor when not behind a Substitute, so Magnezone can be used to dismantle it. Bulky Psychic-types, such as Slowbro and Reuniclus, are swiftly eliminated by Scizor and Tyranitar. Tyranitar also happens to summon permanent Sandstorm, which gives Terrakion a nice 50% Special Defense boost. Finally, the only Pokemon that can put a full stop to this set are obscure threats, such as Golurk, Nidoqueen, and Claydol. As laughable as these Pokemon may seem, it would be a catastrophe if your Terrakion sweep fell short because of them. It would be wise to carry a powerful Water-type, such as Gyarados, Starmie, or Rotom-W, to clear the ruffian's path.</p>"
      },
      "Double Dancer": {
        "description": "<p>As mentioned in the Overview, Terrakion has amazing offensive typing, and combined with its bulk, has the freedom to do what very few other Pokemon in the game are able to: run a double boosting set. This gives Terrakion the versatility to be a fantastic weapon against both offensive and defensive teams. Against offensive teams, Rock Polish allows Terrakion to use its great STAB moves and the boost from Life Orb to run through them. Against slower, defensive teams, Terrakion can amplify its raw power with a Swords Dance, since it is unlikely to require the Speed boost. Also, it isn't that uncommon to find yourself in a situation where you are able to boost both Speed and Attack.</p> <p>Air Balloon versus Life Orb is the biggest question you have to ask yourself when using Double Boosting Terrakion. Air Balloon is extremely useful for setting up in those frequent situations where you need to avoid an Earthquake. The most obvious scenario is getting an extra boost against Gliscor. Life Orb, on the other hand, adds to Terrakion's raw power, allowing it to nail a number of KOs that it normally wouldn't get. It really comes down to personal preference and which item is best suited for your team. Choose wisely!</p> <p>Whether to choose Adamant or Jolly is another difficult choice. Jolly is preferred for the ability to outpace positive base 100 Speed Pokemon before a Rock Polish boost, and to tie other base 108s, most notably Virizion, Infernape, and obviously other Terrakion. The power boost from an Adamant nature is very welcome, however, so if you're fine losing the jump on a few notable Pokemon, feel free to go with that. You could also run a slightly bulkier spread with Leftovers if that floats your boat. However, the standard 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe spread generally works best.</p> <p>Air Balloon is a useful one-time item, and Life Orb provides a more consistent power boost.</p> <p>Terrakion already has fantastic coverage with its two STAB moves, but you can always drop one of the boosting moves for a coverage move, the best option being X-Scissor. X-Scissor gives you a slightly stronger, 100% accurate move against a few of the Psychic-types that can slow Terrakion down a bit (especially Claydol). Earthquake is generally a terrible option, as its coverage is extremely redundant with Close Combat, so don't run that on this set.</p> <p>Terrakion can function as either a Pokemon that opens holes for the rest of your team, or one that takes advantage of the holes opened by other threatening sweepers. Generally, the best sweepers to pair with Terrakion are those that fare well in sand. Landorus-T is the most prominent sweeper that comes to mind. Landorus-T can stick Hidden Power Ice on its set to take out Gliscor or run Swords Dance and Life Orb to absolutely eviscerate Slowbro or Reuniclus. Terrakion itself can muscle its way through Gliscor, which allows Landorus-T to have a field day. Because Terrakion shares a number of weaknesses with either two of those sweepers, you should also consider pairing Terrakion with some sweepers that offer nice resistance-pairing. Choices include Gyarados, which resists Fighting-, Water-, Steel-, and is immune to Ground-type attacks; or Latios, which also provides several compatible resistances while potentially baiting Dark-type attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Many of the same factors that make Terrakion an amazing Choice Band user lend themselves to making Terrakion one of the best Choice Scarf users in the game as well. Its blazing Speed allows it to safely revenge kill some of the biggest threats in the game. The moves are self-explanatory if you read the Choice Band set. Close Combat and Stone Edge are your two powerful STAB moves and X-Scissor covers bulky Psychic-types. The fourth slot is, once again, essentially useless, so run whatever you feel like. Rock Slide is the first option merely because its ability to flinch can be useful in a pinch, while other options such as Earthquake provide redundant coverage.</p> <p>Once again, Adamant is an option over Jolly, and it is even more viable with Choice Scarf compared to other sets. But still, losing the jump on several key Pokemon is rarely worth the extra power. Earthquake is a terrible option again for doing slightly more damage to Jirachi or...Muk, or something. You could still run Quick Attack in the last slot to pick off threatening Pokemon at low health...I'm just kidding. Please don't do that.</p>"

Its STAB Hurricane—perfectly accurate in rain—is very difficult to switch into, with most Pokemon that resist Flying either getting taken out by Focus Blast or pivoted on by U-turn. However, Tornadus also is weak to Stealth Rock and struggles to switch into much of the metagame safely due to its mediocre bulk. This lacking bulk makes it easy to force out with faster Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie, as well as Choice Scarf users like Keldeo and Latios. Tornadus is also vulnerable to being Pursuit trapped by Tyranitar, which easily switches in on Hurricane. Finally, it has to compete with Thundurus-T, which is much stronger and provides a better matchup against sand teams.</p>",

Taunt on the offensive set prevents recovery from Pokemon like Jellicent, Gastrodon, and Jirachi, letting Tornadus keep them at low health to finish off later.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Tornadus is weak to Stealth Rock and vulnerable to sand, making its longevity limited against sand teams.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey can switch in easily and cripple Tornadus with Toxic and Thunder Wave or set Stealth Rock against it. However, Chansey is rare and detests Knock Off. While Tyranitar doesn't enjoy taking Focus Blast or U-turn, it can switch in and potentially Pursuit trap Tornadus. However, Choice Scarf Tyranitar can be scouted if Tornadus is running Protect.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Skarmory, Heatran, and Jirachi can all switch into Hurricane safely. Skarmory and Jirachi can also stay healthy thanks to their recovery and neutrality to Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Thundurus-T forces Tornadus out with its STAB Thunder and sets up a Substitute or Agility as it switches out. Specially defensive Rotom-W and Zapdos can switch into Hurricane and force Tornadus out while pivoting with Volt Switch. It is important to note, however, that all of these Pokemon may struggle to make progress against Substitute + Protect Tornadus and can be scouted by U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Alakazam, Starmie, and Choice Scarf users like Garchomp, Tyranitar, and Keldeo can all outspeed and KO Tornadus.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Focus Blast hits Pokemon resistant to Hurricane, like Tyranitar, Heatran, and Excadrill, super effectively while also dealing solid damage to Rotom-W. U-turn lets Tornadus maintain momentum and pivot out of switch-ins like Jirachi, Tyranitar, and Rotom-W. Protect scouts Choice item Pokemon like Latios, Keldeo, and Tyranitar, easily playing around Choice Scarf Tyranitar in particular, which often attempts to Pursuit trap Tornadus. Tailwind lets Tornadus support slower teammates like Kyurem-B and, thanks to Prankster, prevent a sweep from even faster foes late-game. Tailwind should always be run if Choice Specs is the chosen item. Knock Off cripples switch-ins reliant on their item, like Jirachi, Rotom-W, and Heatran.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers grants Tornadus better longevity, particularly against sand teams, since it'd otherwise get passively worn down. Sharp Beak lets Tornadus switch moves and still get a power boost, letting it 2HKO bulky Thundurus-T after Stealth Rock. Choice Specs provides the largest increase in power, notably letting it OHKO Latios and Garchomp after Stealth Rock. Prankster should be used with Tailwind. Both abilities matter little with Protect or Knock Off, but Defiant has marginal situational utility.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tornadus fits best on rain teams thanks to them giving Hurricane perfect accuracy and Tornadus threatening Grass-types for them. Politoed brings rain, switches into Tyranitar and Steel-types like Jirachi and Heatran, statuses Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W so Tornadus can more quickly break through them, and baits in Grass-types like Ferrothorn for Tornadus to switch into. Tentacruel keeps entry hazards off the field and takes on Steel-types like Skarmory and Jirachi. It also cripples Pokemon like Jellicent and Rotom-W with Toxic so Tornadus can more easily break through them. Ferrothorn counters Dragon- and Water-types like Latios, Starmie, and Kyurem-B, and it removes Leftovers from Thundurus-T as it switches in and Rotom-W as it burns Ferrothorn, helping Tornadus break through them. It also provides entry hazard support and appreciates Tornadus breaking through Pokemon like Breloom and Reuniclus. Choice Scarf Keldeo can clean late-game with the holes Tornadus breaks, while the Choice Specs set can wallbreak in tandem with Tornadus to destroy bulkier teams. Keldeo also checks Pokemon like Tyranitar, Heatran, and Jirachi, while Tornadus breaks past Grass-types like Breloom and Celebi. Jirachi brings Wish and U-turn support to keep Tornadus healthy and pivot it in safely, as well as answering Psychic-types like Latios, Alakazam, and Reuniclus that threaten it. Excadrill can clear entry hazards, switch into Jirachi, and force in Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor for Tornadus to threaten.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Prankster Substitute and Protect, Tornadus is able to stall out slower foes with ease. Substitute punishes switches, while Protect scouts Choice item users like Latios and Keldeo and gives free Leftovers recovery to mitigate Substitute's HP loss. Focus Blast hits Pokemon resistant to Hurricane like Tyranitar, Heatran, and Excadrill super effectively and deals solid damage to Rotom-W.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Prankster is mandatory, as Tornadus gets priority when using Substitute, and Leftovers maximizes Tornadus's longevity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tornadus fits best on rain teams because they support it best, for example giving Hurricane perfect accuracy, and bait in Substitute fodder Pokemon like Stealth Rock Gliscor and Ferrothorn while appreciating it threatening sand teams. Politoed brings rain, switches into Tyranitar and Steel-types like Jirachi and Heatran, statuses Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W to help Tornadus break through them, and baits in Grass-types like Ferrothorn for Tornadus to switch into and use Substitute on. Tentacruel keeps entry hazards off the field and takes on Steel-types like Skarmory and Jirachi. It also cripples Pokemon like Rotom-W and Tyranitar with Toxic so Tornadus can more easily break through or stall them. Tentacruel can also lay down Toxic Spikes for the same benefits. Ferrothorn counters Dragon- and Water-types like Latios, Starmie, and Kyurem-B, and it removes Leftovers from Thundurus-T as it switches in and Rotom-W as it burns Ferrothorn, letting Tornadus more easily break through them. It also provides entry hazard support and appreciates Tornadus breaking through and taking advantage of Pokemon like Breloom and Keldeo. Choice Scarf Keldeo can clean late-game with the holes Tornadus breaks, while the Choice Specs set can wallbreak and force in passive walls for Tornadus to set up Substitute on. Keldeo also checks Pokemon like Tyranitar, Heatran, and Jirachi, while Tornadus breaks past and sets up on Grass-types like Breloom and Celebi. Jirachi brings Wish and U-turn support to keep Tornadus healthy and pivot it in safely, as well as answering Psychic-types like Latios, Alakazam, and Reuniclus that threaten it. Excadrill can clear entry hazards, switch into Jirachi, and force in Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor for Tornadus to threaten and set up Substitute on.</p>"

  "Thundurus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>With insanely high Special Attack, important Ground and Electric immunities, powerful attacks in Thunder, Focus Blast, and Grass Knot, and good utility moves in Agility, Nasty Plot, and U-turn, Thundurus-T finds itself as one of the best assets for an offensive team. Its flaws are its mediocre Speed stat for an offensive Pokemon, reliance on inaccurate moves, and need for Rapid Spin support to relieve its Stealth Rock weakness.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A double dance set with Nasty Plot + Agility is viable, but it's difficult to get both boosts without a dedicated team to support it. A Nasty Plot + 3 Attacks set turns Thundurus-T into a fearsome balance breaker; however, it needs dedicated team support, since its mediocre bulk and Speed make it an easy target for revenge killers. Knock Off can be used alongside Substitute or Protect to help Thundurus-T's teammates by crippling defensive Pokemon, but Thundurus-T normally does this by just using a more powerful move. Volt Switch is a possible move in a four attacks set, but Thundurus-T normally prefers the coverage of Focus Blast + Grass Knot. Similarly, U-turn can be used to act as an offensive pivot and to heavily damage Celebi, but it forces Thundurus-T to lose some bulk by running a Hasty nature, or it risks not doing enough damage to defensive Celebi. Superpower can be used in a mixed set to have a perfect accuracy Fighting-type move that also threatens Chansey and Blissey, but the Defense drop alongside a Hasty nature makes Thundurus-T very weak to Pursuit. A Choice Scarf set can have interesting surprise effects, since almost all players expect Leftovers or a slower set from Thundurus-T, and it still is powerful enough to break through defensive cores. However, once the surprise factor fades away, it becomes a mediocre Pokemon because of the Stealth Rock weakness. Expert Belt can be used to improve Thundurus-T's damage output, but being sand- and Stealth Rock-weak reduces a lot of its utility during the game. Yache Berry and Lum Berry improve Thundurus-T's utility in very specific matchups, but this is generally worse than just holding Leftovers. Finally, Salac Berry and Petaya Berry can be used alongside Substitute + Nasty Plot or Substitute + Agility, respectively, to drastically improve Thundurus-T's sweeping potential, but being sand-weak makes this a fringe strategy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Weather Inducers</strong>: Tyranitar can take at least one Focus Blast if using Chople Berry, or it can surprise KO Thundurus-T with Stone Edge if using a Choice Scarf set. Tyranitar also sets up sand, making it more difficult for Thundurus-T to wallbreak with shaky Thunder accuracy and effectively removing its Leftovers recovery. Hippowdon can also set up sand and only fears Grass Knot if using a specially defensive set, but it needs to be wary of a 2HKO from Hidden Power Ice if using a physically defensive set. Ninetales sets up sun, drastically dropping Thunder's accuracy and supporting teammates like Cresselia, which shrugs off even neutral Electric-type hits because of its massive bulk. Abomasnow sets up hail and can threaten to finish off a weakened Thundurus-T with Ice Shard, but it has mediocre defenses and can't switch directly into Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Specially defensive Celebi takes little damage from Hidden Power Ice, heals away the damage with Recover, and can use Thundurus-T to set up Stealth Rock, Nasty Plot, or Swords Dance. Amoonguss can pivot around Thunder and Focus Blast and play mind games with Sludge Bomb + Stun Spore, but it doesn't like to take Hidden Power Ice, especially if it got damaged by entry hazards. Ferrothorn can check Thundurus-T sets that don't have Focus Blast and can break Thundurus-T's Substitute with Gyro Ball.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Gastrodon can wall Thundurus-T with Recover, but must fear an OHKO from Grass Knot. Seismitoad similarly checks Thundurus-T, but it needs to be played more carefully, since it doesn't have reliable recovery. Excadrill can be used to pivot around Thunder and Hidden Power Ice, and it can clear entry hazards or break Thundurus-T's Substitute with Sand Force-boosted Iron Head before being KOed by Focus Blast if using a Jolly nature. Mamoswine can't directly switch into any move outside of Thunder or Hidden Power Ice, but it can be used to finish off a weakened Thundurus-T with Ice Shard. Mamoswine can also safely set up Substitute on Thundurus-T variants without Focus Blast or Grass Knot.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Latios can switch into any move Thundurus-T can use at least once, scare it away with Draco Meteor or Dragon Pulse, and heal with Recover, but it needs to fear Thunder paralysis. Similarly, Latias can take every move Thundurus-T uses and heal away the damage with Recover, but it further takes little damage from Hidden Power Ice, can set up Calm Mind, and can shrug off Thunder paralysis with Refresh. Kyurem-B and Kyurem can take one Focus Blast and immediately KO Thundurus-T with Outrage and Ice Beam, respectively. Hydreigon outspeeds any Thundurus-T set that doesn't use a Timid nature and threatens to KO it with item-boosted Draco Meteor, but it needs to be wary of Focus Blast. Garchomp and Dragonite fear Hidden Power Ice if they are not using a Yache Berry, but Garchomp outspeeds Thundurus-T and can be used to revenge kill it, while Dragonite can finish off a weakened Thundurus-T with Extreme Speed or set up Dragon Dance if Multiscale is intact. However, Dragonite needs to be wary of Thunder paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Fast Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Terrakion outspeeds Thundurus-T and threatens an immediate OHKO with Stone Edge, but it can only switch into Hidden Power Ice, since it fears Thunder paralysis or a KO from Focus Blast. Keldeo can KO any Thundurus-T variant in rain that isn't behind Substitute, but it can't switch into an Electric-type move. Alakazam can't switch directly into Thundurus-T but can be used to finish it off once it's weakened. Alakazam can also use Encore to force Thundurus-T into an undesired move so a teammate can finish it off or capitalize on it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey</strong>: Chansey and Blissey take virtually nothing from any move that Thundurus-T has and can retaliate with Toxic or Seismic Toss. However, they must watch out for Nasty Plot sets and the rare Knock Off and Superpower.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute eases prediction and blocks incoming status and Knock Off from Ferrothorn. Thunder is the best offensive option, as Thundurus-T should be paired with rain, and its 30% paralysis chance is a potential death sentence for offensive checks like Latios and Alakazam, but Thunderbolt can be safely used even outside of rain. Hidden Power Ice forms BoltBeam coverage and OHKOes Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. It also damages Latios, Breloom, Amoonguss, and Celebi and 2HKOes Dragonite and opposing Thundurus-T. Focus Blast is the preferred move in the last moveslot to pressure Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Kyurem-B, but Agility lets Thundurus-T be a late-game cleaner instead of a wallbreaker. Nasty Plot can be used to turn Thundurus-T into the best balance breaker of the tier, allowing it to mow down natural checks like Celebi and Gastrodon, but this removes some of its offensive pressure versus teams with fast and hard-hitting Pokemon like Alakazam and Terrakion.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>104 HP EVs alongside 144 Defense EVs make sure that Ferrothorn's Power Whip and specially defensive Jirachi's Body Slam never break Thundurus-T's Substitute in one hit. 4 Special Defense EVs make unboosted Latios's Draco Meteor never OHKO Thundurus-T. 208 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Adamant Kyurem-B. Leftovers mitigates damage taken from sand, Stealth Rock, and Substitute usage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Play aggressively with double switches to bring Thundurus-T in front of a Pokemon it scares away like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Excadrill, or Power Whip Ferrothorn so it can safely set up Substitute. If using Focus Blast, bring in Thundurus-T as soon as possible to maximize its function as a wallbreaker, since there are almost no Pokemon that can stomach BoltBeam + Fighting-type coverage. If using Agility, try to keep Thundurus-T healthy during the match to have a better sweep chance in the endgame. Use every possible opportunity to get chip damage on the opposing team, as the lack of Focus Blast makes the task of beating Pokemon like Excadrill, Ferrothorn, Mamoswine, and Tyranitar much more difficult.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Politoed is Thundurus-T's best partner, since it sets up rain to give Thunder perfect accuracy. Politoed also offers Encore support to allow free Substitutes. Thundurus-T loves entry hazard support to amplify its role as wallbreaker or cleaner, so Ferrothorn, which can use both Stealth Rock and Spikes, is an amazing partner. Ferrothorn also provides Knock Off support to help with Thundurus-T's wallbreaking. Tentacruel and Excadrill provide Rapid Spin support, and Tentacruel also helps with Thundurus-T's Ice-type weakness and can take rain-boosted Water-type hits. Offensively, Choice Specs or Choice Scarf Latios and Keldeo take advantage of Thundurus-T's wallbreaking capacities to finish off weakened teams. Dragonite and Mamoswine are also very strong offensive partners that can help break through defensive cores with Choice Band sets, revenge kill setup sweepers with priority moves, or finish off weakened teams with their Substitute sets. Jirachi can offer Stealth Rock and Wish support, and it can paralyze Thundurus-T checks with Body Slam while being an answer to Latias and Latios. Latias, similarly to Latios, can capitalize on Thundurus-T to finish off opponents with a Choice Scarf set, or it can directly support Thundurus-T with Thunder Wave or Healing Wish. Celebi forms a rare but successful core, since it can remove Electric-immune Pokemon like Gastrodon and Seismitoad while supporting Thundurus-T with Stealth Rock.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Agility makes Thundurus-T the fastest Pokemon in the tier and an amazing late-game cleaner. Thunder is the best option in rain, but Thunderbolt is the ideal move if using this set on a sand or weatherless team. Hidden Power Ice gives BoltBeam coverage and KOes Electric-immune Pokemon like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and opposing Thundurus-T. The last move is team dependent; Focus Blast defeats Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Kyurem-B, and Kyurem, while Grass Knot should be used if Gastrodon, Seismitoad, or Hippowdon is problematic. Both options deal with Tyranitar and Mamoswine.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>24 HP EVs optimize Leftovers recovery from residual damage, and, with 104 Special Defense EVs, let Thundurus-T survive powerful special hits like Draco Meteor from non-Choice Specs Latios, rain-boosted Surf from Choice Specs Latios, and Hidden Power Ice from opposing Thundurus-T after Stealth Rock. 152 Speed EVs let it outspeed Adamant Excadrill to OHKO it with Focus Blast before it can use Rapid Spin. Leftovers negates sand damage so Thundurus-T can't be defeated by Protect stalling.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avoid taking unneeded damage with Thundurus-T, since it needs its HP to safely set up Agility. Use Thundurus-T as a hit-and-run Pokemon early-game to distribute damage while preserving its health. Only set up Agility when the opposing team is weakened enough to be swept or when you must remove a specific Pokemon, like Latios or Alakazam, to win with Thundurus-T's teammates. This set works better in the hands of an aggressive player, since it's heavily dependent on good predictions, like double switches, to do its job.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Even if this Thundurus-T prefers more offensive Pokemon as partners, Politoed still is its best partner, since it sets rain to give Thunder perfect accuracy alongside creating setup opportunities with Encore. Entry hazard setters like Jirachi and Ferrothorn also check Latios and other Psychic-types. Hard-hitting Pokemon like Latios, Keldeo, Starmie, Kyurem-B, and Mamoswine can weaken the opposing team to allow an Agility sweep. Rapid Spin support from Tentacruel, Excadrill, or Starmie is required as well. Pokemon that can safely bring Thundurus-T into play via U-turn like Landorus-T, Scizor, Gliscor, Jirachi, and Celebi are good partners. Scizor also helps by Pursuit trapping Psychic-types that can trouble Thundurus-T, like Alakazam. In hyper offense structures, fast Taunt and entry hazard users like Azelf, Terrakion, Mew, and Skarmory are the ideal partners. Mew and Azelf can also provide dual screens support for a better Agility sweep. Magic Bounce Espeon and Xatu can also provide dual screens support while reflecting entry hazards.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thundurus-T is almost only used on rain teams, so Thunder is optimal, but Thunderbolt is the best option on teams without rain. Hidden Power Ice is used to OHKO Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor while damaging Grass- and Dragon-types. Focus Blast hits Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Heatran, Kyurem-B, and Kyurem. Grass Knot is used to destroy Gastrodon, Seismitoad, and Hippowdon and to not risk missing Focus Blast when facing Tyranitar or Mamoswine. Nasty Plot lets Thundurus-T overwhelm its normal defensive checks like Celebi and Tyranitar with its sheer power while maintaining the ability to brute force Ground-types like Hippowdon and Seismitoad; U-turn instead lets Thundurus-T take advantage of many of the switches that it forces to bring in teammates that beat the aforementioned Ground-types and Tyranitar and does significant damage to Celebi and Latios.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>24 HP EVs optimize Leftovers recovery from residual damage and, with 56 Special Defense EVs, let Thundurus-T never be OHKOed by Choice Scarf Latios's Draco Meteor. 176 Speed EVs with a Timid nature let it outspeed Landorus-T. Maximum Speed investment can be used in order to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Jirachi and Volcarona and guarantee at least a Speed tie versus opposing Thundurus-T.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because this Thundurus-T is a wallbreaker, it is important to get value out of it early in the game. If using Grass Knot, do not reveal it early, especially if the opposing team has a Gastrodon or Seismitoad to catch them off guard. Since this Thundurus-T is faster than usual, it can even unexpectedly KO maximum Speed Landorus-T, Jolly Excadrill, and standard Tentacruel before they have a chance to set up entry hazards or use Rapid Spin. If it has U-turn, then Thundurus-T should use it on Water-types and Pokemon Choice-locked into Ground-type moves to preserve momentum for its team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Thundurus-T, ideally, is used in rain structures to give Thunder perfect accuracy, so Politoed is its best partner. If using Grass Knot, use Pokemon that love having Gastrodon and Seismitoad removed, like Starmie, Keldeo, and Mamoswine. If using Focus Blast, use powerful Dragon-types that want Steel-type Pokemon gone, like Latios, Dragonite, and Salamence. Ferrothorn is a very good partner, since it can check Latios and provide entry hazard and Knock Off support. Rapid Spin from Tentacruel or Excadrill is always advised. Both Ferrothorn and Tentacruel can set entry hazards, which U-turn Thundurus-T benefits from. Other Pokemon that can bring Thundurus-T in via U-turn like Jirachi, Landorus-T, and Scizor are also very good options. Choice Scarf Scizor deserves a special mention, since it can capitalize on Thundurus-T's ability to use U-turn on Latios and Celebi to effectively Pursuit trap them. Since this Thundurus-T also functions well in sand, especially if using Focus Blast + Grass Knot, partners that can profit from the removal of bulky Ground-types, like Tyranitar, Heatran, Gliscor, Garchomp, Alakazam, and Reuniclus, are very good choices.</p>"

  "Landorus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Landorus-T is a great Pokemon thanks to its good defensive utility letting it check many Pokemon paired with its solid offensive presence. Its typing, bulk, and access to Intimidate make it a good check to offensive Pokemon like Excadrill, Terrakion, Tyranitar, Breloom, and Garchomp; this is only enhanced by its immunity to sand and Spikes, giving it good longevity. These qualities, alongside its access to U-Turn, let it keep momentum and pivoting in dangerous teammates like Terrakion and Keldeo safely. This also lets it consistently set Stealth Rock throughout the game alongside its STAB Earthquake threatening the most common spinners in Excadrill and Tentacruel. Landorus-T is also offensively potent, being able to run a fully offensive set with Superpower that lures checks like Skarmory and Rotom-W while also being able to blend its offensive and defensive utility together to run a Choice Scarf set that revenge kills and keeps Pokemon like Dragonite and Terrakion under control with Intimidate. However, Landorus-T is forced out by common special attackers like Latios, Keldeo, Alakazam, and Thundurus-T. It also has a tendency to get worn down throughout the game by Stealth Rock and its tendency to switch into quite a few Pokemon that are sometimes paired together. This issue is even more true for sets lacking Leftovers, meaning its health needs to be managed throughout the game. It also has to compete with Gliscor as a defensive Ground-type, whose access to Poison Heal gives it an immunity to status and much better longevity; Gliscor can also check the same pool of Pokemon while not needing to directly switch into what it's supposed to check. Excadrill and Garchomp also give Landorus-T competition as an offensive Ground-type thanks to the former's access to Rapid Spin and ability to switch into Latios and the latter's higher Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be run on the defensive set with Magnezone if Stealth Rock can be fit elsewhere to cripple switch-ins like Rotom-W and opposing Landorus-T. However, this is usually not worth it since many of Landorus-T's other switch-ins, like Skarmory, Gliscor, Reuniclus, and Refresh Politoed, are all immune to or can cure themselves of poison. Protect can also be used alongside Toxic to get free recovery with Leftovers, scout Choice item Pokemon, and rack up Toxic damage. Rock Polish can be run standalone or in tandem with Swords Dance and Yache Berry to try and sweep late-game by outspeeding common revenge killers. Knock Off can be used on the Choice Scarf set on Ground-spam teams to remove Leftovers from switch-ins like Rotom-W, Politoed, and Skarmory so its teammates can break through them more easily while also removing Rocky Helmet from Skarmory, making Landorus-T much more easily able to safely spam U-turn. A Choice Band set may seem alluring as a way for Landorus-T to more immediately wallbreak while maintaining momentum in a similar vein to the Choice Scarf variant. However, it lacks the utility the Choice Scarf set provides and is outclassed by the Swords Dance set as a result of being unable to break past bulky Pokemon like Skarmory and Gliscor and being very punishable after locking into a move. Punishment can be used on the Choice Scarf set to KO Reuniclus after boosting with Calm Mind. However, this is quite situational, and Tyranitar can pressure it with Pursuit anyway. Smack Down or Gravity can be used on the Swords Dance set to make Pokemon that are immune to Ground like Skarmory, Gliscor, and opposing Landorus-T able to be hit with Earthquake, which benefits Landorus-T and its teammates in breaking past them. However, it's hard to fit and has less utility than the other moves on the set. Earth Plate lets Jolly Landorus-T 2HKO physically defensive Politoed and Jellicent after Stealth Rock and, if running an Adamant nature, OHKO maximum HP Tyranitar and offensive Volcarona and 2HKO Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock. Yache Berry lets Landorus-T take one Ice-type move from Pokemon like Thundurus-T and Alakazam, letting it retaliate and KO them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Keldeo, Volcarona, Latios, Alakazam, and Thundurus-T can all outspeed and OHKO Landorus-T with super effective coverage. It can also get overwhelmed by faster threats it's meant to check if worn down, like Excadrill, Garchomp, and Terrakion, especially the Choice Scarf set. However, many of these Pokemon struggle to switch in, and can be revenge killed by the Choice Scarf set.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Politoed, Jellicent, Rotom-W, Slowbro, Keldeo, and Tentacruel in rain can outspeed or take at least one hit from and KO Landorus-T with their strong STAB moves. However, they can tend to get worn down or revenge killed by the Choice Scarf set.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory switches into Landorus-T easily, sets up Spikes on it, and punishes U-turn if running Rocky Helmet. However, it can be trapped by Magnezone, which is easy to do since Landorus-T can U-turn into it as Skarmory comes in.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn lets Landorus-T pivot around and wear down switch-ins like Skarmory and Rotom-W and get in its teammates safely, letting it keep momentum. Hidden Power Ice hits Gliscor, Dragonite, Breloom, Garchomp, and opposing Landorus-T hard, letting it check them better.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread outspeeds Excadrill, opposing defensive Landorus-T, Modest Thundurus-T, and Substitute + Dragon Dance Dragonite. Leftovers helps Landorus-T check what it's supposed to and set Stealth Rock throughout the game. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 164 Def / 92 Spe with a Lax nature can be used to better check physical attackers while outspeeding Adamant Breloom and Modest Politoed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits on offensive sand teams that want their Stealth Rock setter to have more of an offensive presence and maintain momentum with U-turn. Tyranitar sets sand and Pursuit traps Reuniclus, Latios, and Alakazam with its Chople Berry set. It's able to run a coverage move or Thunder Wave with Landorus-T running Stealth Rock. It can also run a Choice Scarf set that lets it check offensive threats Landorus-T can't cover, like Starmie and Thundurus-T, while appreciating Landorus-T checking Ground-types like Excadrill and Gliscor and pivoting it in safely against Reuniclus with U-turn. Ferrothorn is able to set up Spikes to accompany Landorus-T's Stealth Rock and switches into Dragon-types like Latios and Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Superpower as well as Water-types like Starmie and Politoed, while Landorus-T checks Fighting-types like Terrakion and Breloom. Breloom can check Water-types like Politoed and Tentacruel and benefits from Stealth Rock wearing down switch-ins like Latios and Thundurus-T. Psychic-types like Alakazam, Latios, and Reuniclus appreciate Landorus-T setting Stealth Rock and switching into checks like Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn, with each of them providing support and working well with each other. Focus Sash Alakazam is able to revenge kill any Pokemon and enjoys being safely pivoted into with U-turn while Reuniclus appreciates its switch-ins being worn down so it can sweep with Calm Mind late-game and more easily wallbreak if running its 3 Attacks set. Latios switches into Water-, Grass-, and Electric-types like Keldeo, Celebi, and Thundurus-T and can keep setup sweepers like Volcarona and Reuniclus under control with its Choice Scarf set.

Hidden Power Ice hits Dragonite, Garchomp, and opposing Landorus-T hard, letting it revenge kill them even after a boost. Stone Edge OHKOes Thundurus-T, Gyarados, and Volcarona. Stealth Rock can be used over Rock Slide as a secondary Stealth Rock user for offensive teams that need Stealth Rock up at all times or on sand teams that want Tyranitar to have more flexibility in checking Latios, Reuniclus, and Thundurus-T instead of needing to set Stealth Rock every game. It also lets Stealth Rock go up early-game against Taunt leads like Aerodactyl, Terrakion, and Skarmory that try to prevent Stealth Rock from going up, which is really crucial if the opponent has a Volcarona, Dragonite, or Cloyster.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs let Landorus-T outrun Choice Scarf Excadrill and more easily take hits from it and Terrakion while maintaining an offensive presence.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Landorus-T fits on sand teams that need the role compression of a Choice Scarf user and backup check to physical attackers. Tyranitar brings sand, sets up Stealth Rock, and Pursuit traps Reuniclus and Choice Scarf Latios, which can set up on and revenge kill Landorus-T, respectively. Pokemon that can handle Volcarona, like Heatran, Keldeo, and Jellicent, are important partners since Landorus-T can't revenge kill it at +1. Heatran can also set Stealth Rock and counter Grass-types like Celebi. Keldeo provides a better matchup against hyper offense threats like Scizor and Dragonite and switch into Heatran. Jellicent can check Water-types like Keldeo and Politoed and spread burn to Skarmory and Rotom-W. Stealth Rock setters like the aforementioned Tyranitar and Heatran as well as others like specially defensive Jirachi are helpful since they wear down switch-ins like Skarmory and Rotom-W, which also get chipped by a potential U-turn, bringing them into range of Landorus-T's or its teammates' attacks. Psychic-types like Alakazam and Latios appreciate the pivoting support and ability to threaten most Steel-types that Landorus-T provides, with Focus Sash Alakazam able to revenge kill any Pokemon or cripple them with Encore and Thunder Wave, while Latios switches into Water-, Grass-, and Electric-types like Keldeo, Celebi, and Thundurus-T and can wallbreak with its Choice Specs set. Rotom-W forms a good VoltTurn core with Landorus-T and can check Fire-, Water-, and Ice-types like Heatran, Starmie, and Mamoswine.</p>"

Imprison prevents slower Stealth Rock leads from getting Stealth Rock up on Landorus-T and stops opposing lead Landorus-T should it lose the Speed tie.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Focus Sash is used to guarantee Stealth Rock goes up while also letting Landorus-T use Explosion should it outspeed the Pokemon that breaks its Focus Sash.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set works well on hyper offense teams due to it getting Stealth Rock up quickly, keeping momentum with Explosion, and being able to do a lot of damage as it goes down. Volcarona can break through bulkier Pokemon that could otherwise take a hit from it, like Tyranitar, Politoed, and Gastrodon, and enjoys Landorus-T wearing down these Pokemon and other bulky foes. Dragon Dance Dragonite can more easily sweep thanks to being able to break through bulky targets like Slowbro, Gliscor, and opposing Landorus-T with Stealth Rock up while also revenge killing faster threats with Extreme Speed more easily for the same reason. Swords Dance Scizor benefits from Garchomp forcing in Dragon-types and Alakazam to revenge kill it since it can set up on them while enjoying its Bullet Punch being able to KO Pokemon like Volcarona, Dragonite, and opposing Garchomp, making it able to easily sweep through the offensive teams that'd otherwise check and force it out due to its lower natural Speed. Offensive Starmie more easily wears down and takes out Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Politoed, Latios, and Jellicent with Stealth Rock support while also appreciating Landorus-T wearing down foes into range of its attacks and getting it in easily on a chipped foe thanks to Explosion. Offensive Breloom can 2HKO Pokemon like Dragonite and Thundurus-T and is more easily able to revenge kill threats with Mach Punch if Stealth Rock is up.

  "Kyurem": {
    "overview": "<p>Kyurem is a decent wallbreaker against balance teams thanks to its high Special Attack and fantastic Ice- + Ground-type coverage, which hits a majority of the metagame hard and forces a lot of switches. Its bulk and resistances are also excellent, letting it easily set up Substitute on common defensive Pokemon like Tentacruel, Rotom-W, Politoed lacking Encore, and Ferrothorn lacking Gyro Ball. It can also take a hit from other Pokemon like Starmie and Heatran. Kyurem's Speed tier lets it outpace some offensive Pokemon, like Dragonite, Excadrill, Breloom, and Heatran. However, it's outsped by Pokemon like Keldeo, Garchomp, Latios, and Alakazam, all of which are incredibly common and hit it super effectively. Kyurem is also reliant on having Substitute up to wallbreak properly, as it's otherwise forced out or crippled by Pokemon like Jellicent, Heatran, and Politoed. By extension, it must be careful when coming in on these bulky Pokemon. It can also struggle to break through bulky offensive threats that threaten it, like Tyranitar, Reuniclus, and Volcarona. Kyurem is very vulnerable to residual damage due to not healing with Leftovers in sand and being weak to Stealth Rock, forcing it to spend turns using Roost instead of attacking. Kyurem also faces competition as a Dragon-type wallbreaker from Pokemon like Latios, Dragonite, and especially Kyurem-B, due to them more easily fitting on teams, relying less on setup to wallbreak, and having more defensive utility.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set with Ice Beam, Draco Meteor, Focus Blast, and Earth Power could be used as a stronger wallbreaker with more coverage. However, it's too susceptible to residual damage and even weaker attacks as a result of lacking Roost. It's also outclassed by other Choice-item wallbreakers like Latios, Keldeo, and Kyurem-B as a result of their power, Speed, lessened prediction reliance, and defensive utility. Never-Melt Ice could be used over Leftovers to more effectively threaten pivots like Reuniclus, Rotom-W, and Tyranitar and bluff a Choice item. However, Leftovers is crucial to consistently pressure bulky teams over the course of the game and set up Substitute. Dragon Tail can phaze Volcarona and punish switches by racking up entry hazard damage. However, it's generally inferior to Substitute because it makes Kyurem vulnerable to status users and Substitute punishes switches well enough anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon that can hit Kyurem super effectively, like Latios, Alakazam, Keldeo, Volcarona, Garchomp, and Terrakion, all make it struggle to switch in, force it out, and can even set up on it. However, they struggle to switch in safely and can lose to Kyurem if Substitute is up.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Kyurem is very vulnerable to all entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, since it must stay healthy to set up Substitute and take hits from the bulky Pokemon it should handle. However, it can threaten or set up on common entry hazard setters, like Ferrothorn and Heatran.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: While Kyurem can threaten most Steel-types with Earth Power, Pokemon like Scizor and specially defensive Excadrill and Jirachi can take Earth Power relatively comfortably and force Kyurem out with their powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn and poison ruin Kyurem's longevity and make it harder to set up and wallbreak due to needing to use Roost more often. Paralysis, on the other hand, makes it unable to outspeed anything and, therefore, properly use Substitute or pressure Pokemon that run recovery moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Reuniclus, Volcarona, and Keldeo all easily take Kyurem's hits thanks to their bulk and threaten it and set up on it. However, they can't take too many hits and are susceptible to being worn down.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earth Power provides near-perfect coverage alongside Ice Beam, hitting Pokemon like Jirachi, Heatran, Tyranitar, and Tentacruel super effectively while also hitting other Water-types like Politoed and Keldeo decently hard. Substitute allows Kyurem to punish switches, protect itself from common status spreaders like Rotom-W, Politoed lacking Encore, and Tentacruel, and more freely attack. It also pairs well with Pressure to PP stall attacks like Hydro Pump and Focus Blast. Roost allows Kyurem to heal off entry hazard and Substitute damage while making it a long-term check to common bulky Pokemon like Rotom-W, Heatran, and Ferrothorn lacking Gyro Ball.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>56 HP makes Kyurem's Substitute have 101 HP, letting it withstand one Seismic Toss or Night Shade from Chansey, Jellicent, and Xatu and survive defensive Rotom-W's Hydro Pump. A Timid nature is preferred to outspeed Pokemon like Landorus-T, Modest Thundurus-T, and Jolly Excadrill.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Kyurem fits best on bulky rain teams, which best provide the support it needs and bait in Pokemon for it to set up on while appreciating it threatening sand teams. Politoed brings rain, switches into Tyranitar and Ground-types like Garchomp and Excadrill, punishes Pokemon like Calm Mind Reuniclus with Encore that'd otherwise check Kyurem decently, statuses Pokemon like opposing Politoed so Kyurem can more quickly break through them, and baits in bulky Water- and Grass-types like Tentacruel, Ferrothorn, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W for Kyurem to set up on. Tentacruel keeps entry hazards off the field and takes on Fighting-types like Keldeo and Terrakion, Volcarona, and Steel-types not as threatened by Earth Power, like Scizor and Jirachi. It also lays down Toxic Spikes to put bulky threats like Tyranitar on a timer, letting Kyurem more easily break through them and poison stall them with Substitute. Ferrothorn counters Dragon-types like Latios and Kyurem-B, as well as providing another Water resistance so Kyurem isn't forced to pivot in and use Roost as often. It also provides entry hazard support and appreciates Kyurem breaking through Pokemon like Heatran and Breloom. Landorus-T can pivot Kyurem in safely with U-turn to more easily set up Substitute while also getting Stealth Rock up and checking Ground- and Fighting-types. Choice Scarf Keldeo does well against offensive threats Kyurem struggles against, like Scizor, Volcarona, and Terrakion, while the Choice Specs set can wallbreak in tandem with it to destroy bulkier teams. Jirachi brings Wish and U-turn support to keep Kyurem healthy and pivot it in safely while also answering Psychic-types like Latios, Alakazam, and Reuniclus that threaten it. Excadrill can clear entry hazards, switch into Jirachi, and force in Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor for Kyurem to threaten and set up Substitute on.</p>"

  "Kyurem-Black": {
    "overview": "<p>Blessed with a titanic Attack stat, decent Speed, powerful coverage options, and set versatility, Kyurem-B makes its name as one of the most devastating wallbreakers in OU. Its famously dangerous STAB Outrage can OHKO nearly any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, while its good coverage threatens the Pokemon that can take Outrage. Teravolt nullifies the abilities an opponent may use to pivot around Kyurem-B, such as Volt Absorb, Sturdy, and Levitate. Kyurem-B also has solid bulk and some useful resistances to Water and Electric, letting it take a hit in a pinch.</p> <p>However, Kyurem-B lacks a usable physical Ice-type move, forcing it to rely on mixed or special sets. It also tends to be unreliable defensively, as, despite its bulk and numerous resistances, its typing curses it with weaknesses to common attacking types like Fighting, Dragon, and Rock. It's also extremely vulnerable to residual damage due to its weakness to Stealth Rock and vulnerability to common battle conditions like sand and Spikes. Finally, its Speed tier leaves it outrun by common Pokemon like Latios, Terrakion, Keldeo, and Alakazam, all of which greatly threaten it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Outrage is the primary move of this set, threatening literally every foe that does not resist it. Dragon Claw is used as a secondary, safer STAB option. Fusion Bolt hits Skarmory and other Steel-types like Heatran and Jirachi hard. Kyurem-B can also use it to devastating effect against rain teams due to Teravolt letting Kyurem-B ignore Thundurus-T's Volt Absorb. The last moveslot doesn't see much use, but Ice Beam can destroy Gliscor and Landorus-T without being forced to Outrage while Earth Power is much stronger against Heatran.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature is preferred to always OHKO max HP Tyranitar after Stealth Rock with Outrage. A Jolly nature is an option to always outspeed positive-natured Landorus-T and Excadrill and neutral-natured Thundurus-T. However, the drop in power is generally not worthwhile, and its reward is inconsistent. While both Adamant and Jolly reduce the power of Kyurem-B’s special coverage, it is still powerful enough to handle its targets.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Kyurem-B is a straightforward wallbreaker; teammates appreciate its unparalleled damage output and must, in turn, shore up Kyurem-B’s many defensive shortcomings. Latios is an ideal partner, as it can answer and threaten many of the offensive Pokemon that would outrun and OHKO Kyurem-B, such as Keldeo, Thundurus-T, and common Fighting coverage aimed at Kyurem-B. Latios can also utilize many sets to take advantage of Kyurem-B’s power, using a Choice Scarf to clean up teams barraged by Kyurem-B’s Outrages or a wallbreaker set to assist in breaking down the enemy team. Magnezone is another potent option, as it can trap and remove the Steel-types that would stomach Kyurem-B’s Dragon-type moves with Magnet Pull. Jirachi can set up Stealth Rock and immediately pivot out, generating momentum for Kyurem-B and giving it ample opportunities to fire off powerful attacks. Starmie can keep Stealth Rock off the field with Rapid Spin and handle the offensive Pokemon that outrun Kyurem-B, like Latio and Keldeo. However, Excadrill similarly removes entry hazards and sports a potent STAB combination when paired with Magnezone.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set takes a different approach, forgoing Kyurem-B’s powerful physical Dragon-type STAB in favor of its Ice-type STAB and wide special movepool. Kyurem-B has many opportunities to set up a Substitute since it forces so many switches and takes little damage from foes such as Politoed, Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, and Jellicent. Fusion Bolt has great neutral coverage alongside Ice Beam, doing huge damage to Water-types like Politoed, Keldeo, and Tentacruel. Kyurem-B can also easily spam it against rain teams due to Teravolt letting Kyurem-B ignore Thundurus-T's Volt Absorb. Earth Power is preferred in the last slot, as it threatens many Steel-types that would otherwise take Ice Beam and Fusion Bolt well, such as Jirachi, Heatran, and Magnezone, and hits Rotom-W hard thanks to Teravolt. Hidden Power Fire 2HKOes Ferrothorn and OHKOes Scizor outside of rain, but it is weaker against the aforementioned Steel-types and is hampered by rain. Focus Blast can be used for its good overall coverage and ability to hit Tyranitar harder than any other move Kyurem-B can run. However, the decrease in damage against Jirachi, Heatran, and Ferrothorn compared to Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire is significant, and the unreliable accuracy can be game-breaking.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>56 HP EVs give Kyurem-B 101 HP Substitutes, enabling them to survive one Seismic Toss or Night Shade. 224 Speed EVs allows Kyurem-B to outspeed neutral-natured Landorus-T and Excadrill and Timid Heatran. 236 Speed EVs can be run to outspeed Jolly Mamoswine and Dragonite, but these sets are exceptionally rare.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Substitute Kyurem-B's teammates should take advantage of this set's surprise factor and its ability to pressure sand and rain teams effectively while punishing common switch-ins to its Choice Band set, such as Ferrothorn. Latios checks many offensive Pokemon for Kyurem-B, like Keldeo and Breloom, and overwhelms teams alongside Kyurem-B. However, unlike the Choice Band set, this set's investment into bulk and use of Leftovers allows it to more comfortably switch into foes that target Latios, such as Starmie. Rapid Spin support is particularly appreciated with this set, as entry hazards limit Kyurem-B's setup opportunities. Tentacruel, specifically, pairs very well with this set, thanks to its ability to spin reliably over the course of the game and consistently spread passive damage through Toxic or Toxic Spikes. Both Politoed and Tyranitar also pair well with this Kyurem-B set. Politoed enables Rain Dish Tentacruel and contests Tyranitar's Sand Stream, which is detrimental to Kyurem-B's longevity. In turn, Kyurem-B pressures Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and Tentacruel. Tyranitar may seem counterintuitive, as sand cuts into Kyurem-B's longevity, but Tyranitar's ability to Pursuit trap Pokemon like Latios and Alakazam allows Kyurem-B to attack without worrying about being immediately revenge killed. Tyranitar also threatens Reuniclus, which can otherwise use Kyurem-B as setup fodder.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf leverages Kyurem-B's decent Speed stat and massive power to try and clean up teams late-game. However, it struggles to switch in and has poor longevity, compromising its utility in the mid- to late-game. A physically-based Substitute attacker set can be used with Magnezone support, but without a boosting item, this set is outdone by other Substitute users like Thundurus-T, Mamoswine, and Garchomp. A Substitute shuffler set consisting of Substitute, Roost, Dragon Tail, and either Ice Beam or Hone Claws can be paired with Spikes support to easily beat defensive teams that cannot easily break Kyurem-B's Substitute. However, this set is quite passive and is unable to threaten faster teams. Chople Berry allows Kyurem-B to take Fighting coverage from Pokemon like Alakazam and Thundurus-T and OHKO them back.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Steel Types</strong>: Steel-types like Jirachi, Ferrothorn, Heatran, Skarmory, and Scizor are able to take Kyurem-B's Outrage and either threaten it offensively or take advantage of it to set up entry hazards. Jirachi, Leech Seed Ferrothorn, and physically defensive Skarmory also have good longevity, making them able to do this multiple times throughout a game. However, Ferrothorn is unable to significantly threaten the Substitute set without Gyro Ball, while Heatran, Skarmory, and Scizor are severely damaged by Kyurem-B's coverage options. Heatran and Scizor also lack the longevity to stomach Kyurem-B's Outrage throughout the game.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: While they lack the ability to switch in reliably, faster offensive Pokemon like Latios, Alakazam, Keldeo, Garchomp, and Terrakion can switch in after Kyurem-B has KOed a foe and threaten to KO it back.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Kyurem-B is very vulnerable to residual damage due to its vulnerability to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and sand, severely limiting its longevity and putting it into KO range of Pokemon like Latios and Reuniclus very quickly.</p>"

  "Keldeo": {
    "overview": "<p>Keldeo is one of the most prominent and important Pokemon in the metagame. Its offensive typing is fantastic, having great neutral coverage and letting it beat common Water-type checks like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W with its powerful Secret Sword while also beating common switch-ins to Fighting-type moves like Gliscor and Landorus-T. It can also run a Hidden Power type to get around checks like Dragonite, Jellicent, and Gastrodon. Its typing, in tandem with its decent bulk, lets it check common Pokemon on sand teams like Gliscor, Heatran, and Tyranitar as well as a lot of Pokemon found on hyper offense, like Scizor, Cloyster, and Volcarona. Its Speed tier aids in this, outspeeding prominent offensive threats like Dragonite, Garchomp, Landorus-T, Volcarona, and Thundurus-T, and Speed tying Terrakion. Keldeo can also run a wide variety of sets, including Choice Specs, Choice Scarf, All-Out Attacker, Toxic + Protect, and Calm Mind. These sets have differing counterplay and can fit on both sand and rain teams, making Keldeo a hard-to-predict Pokemon that can punish some of its conditional checks very effectively. However, Keldeo is easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon in Latios, Alakazam, and Starmie. The same is true for Choice Scarf users like Garchomp should Keldeo lack a Choice Scarf itself. It's also vulnerable to passive damage from Spikes and sandstorm if lacking Leftovers, making it easy to wear down. While its different sets can demand specific counterplay, most teams use checks that cover most sets, like Jellicent, Tentacruel, Gastrodon, Latios, and Celebi.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Expert Belt can be used with Hydro Pump, Secret Sword, Icy Wind, and Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Bug to hit most of the metagame hard. However, it gets worn down in sand, it is still walled by some threats depending on what Hidden Power type it drops, and proper team support can similarly pressure Keldeo checks. Other Hidden Power types can be used on the Choice item sets, namely Hidden Power Psychic on Choice Specs to hit Tentacruel, Amoonguss, and Toxicroak and Hidden Power Electric on the Choice Scarf set to revenge kill Gyarados. However, Keldeo and its teammates can already overwhelm Poison-types, while Hidden Power Electric's utility is very situational. Aqua Jet over Protect on the Leftovers attacker set can let Keldeo finish off faster weakened targets, mainly Alakazam and boosted Volcarona, and also break Alakazam's Focus Sash for teammates so they can finish it off. Roar can be used over Protect to let Keldeo force entry hazard damage on many foes and punish the many switches it forces. However, a lot of switch-ins to Roar Keldeo, like Latios, Reuniclus, and Rotom-W, are immune to the Spikes that justify Roar's use in the first place.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Latios, Alakazam, Starmie, Choice Scarf variants of Garchomp and Rotom-W, and boosted Dragonite outspeed and do a lot of damage to Keldeo, at worst 2HKOing it. However, they must be careful switching in, and only Choice Scarf Latios outspeeds Choice Scarf Keldeo.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Pokemon that resist at least one of Keldeo's STAB moves, like Ferrothorn, Celebi, Amoonguss, Tentacruel, Gastrodon, Latios, Rotom-W, and Jellicent, can take a hit and do something impactful back. However, Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W are hit hard by Secret Sword, Tentacruel, Gastrodon, and Amoonguss can be easily overwhelmed by Choice Specs in rain or used as setup fodder by the Calm Mind set, and Jellicent is hit very hard by Hidden Power Grass from the Choice Specs set and is unable to take on the Calm Mind variant if it's running Hidden Power Grass, Ghost, or Dark.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Keldeo is very vulnerable to residual damage from sand and entry hazards as a result of its Choice item sets lacking any recovery, while Leftovers sets can't heal in the sand they're often accompanied by. It's also crippled by burn and Toxic from Pokemon like Politoed, Tentacruel, Jellicent, and Heatran.</p>",

It also OHKOes Scizor, Magnezone, Gliscor, and offensive Heatran outside of rain and Thundurus-T, Garchomp, and Reuniclus in rain.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature is necessary for outspeeding Garchomp and Timid Volcarona and Speed tying with Terrakion and opposing Keldeo.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Specs Keldeo is best used on rain teams, since Hydro Pump becomes nearly impossible to handle given it can wear down and take out common stops to rain in Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, Tentacruel, and Rotom-W. Politoed is a mandatory partner to bring rain and provides a switch-in to Pokemon like Landorus-T and Gliscor. It can also cripple Keldeo checks like Tentacruel, Amoonguss, and Jellicent with status. Choice Scarf Latios can outspeed and check threats that can take advantage of Keldeo like Alakazam, Rotom-W, Breloom, and boosted Dragonite while benefitting from Keldeo breaking holes in opposing walls and threatening Latios checks in Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn. Tentacruel uses Rapid Spin to improve Keldeo's longevity and spreads status on Keldeo's checks in a similar manner to Politoed. Thundurus-T can sweep late-game with a Substitute + Agility set or wallbreak alongside Keldeo with a Substitute 3 attacks set, both of which take advantage of Grass-types that switch into Keldeo's attacks, like Celebi and Ferrothorn. Ferrothorn can switch into Dragon- and Psychic-types like Latios, Dragonite, and Alakazam while also setting entry hazards and removing Leftovers to let Keldeo more easily break through its checks. Jirachi can act similarly while also pivoting Keldeo in safely with U-turn. Landorus-T can set Stealth Rock, pivot with U-turn, and switch into Electric- and Ground-type moves from Thundurus-T and Garchomp.

Scald can be used instead to deter Pokemon like Tentacruel, Politoed, and Rotom-W from switching in with the threat of a burn while still OHKOing Gliscor and defensive Landorus-T outside of rain.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Timid Choice Scarf Keldeo outspeeds +2 Adamant Dragonite, +1 Volcarona, and every Choice Scarf user besides Latios.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Keldeo works well on rain teams, where it can threaten to sweep with Water-type moves, answer fast threats to rain in Dragonite and Choice Scarf Garchomp, and threaten bulkier stops in Ferrothorn and Tyranitar. Politoed is a mandatory partner to bring rain and provides a switch-in to Pokemon like Landorus-T and Gliscor. It can also cripple checks like Tentacruel, Amoonguss, and Jellicent with status and use Encore to stop bulkier setup sweepers that may take advantage of Keldeo like Reuniclus, Gyarados, and Dragonite. Choice Specs and Calm Mind Latios appreciate Keldeo answering Tyranitar and can check threats like Breloom, Rotom-W, and Celebi so Keldeo can more easily clean late-game. Tentacruel uses Rapid Spin to improve Keldeo's longevity and spreads status on Keldeo's checks in a similar manner to Politoed. Thundurus-T can take advantage of Grass-types Keldeo checks like Celebi, Breloom, and Ferrothorn with a Substitute + 3 attacks set and then wallbreak for easier Keldeo sweeping. Ferrothorn can switch into Dragon- and Psychic-types like Latios, Dragonite, and Alakazam while also setting entry hazards and using Knock Off to remove Leftovers to let Keldeo more easily sweep. Jirachi can act similarly while also pivoting Keldeo in safely with U-turn. Landorus-T can set Stealth Rock, use U-turn, and switch into Electric- and Ground-type moves from Thundurus-T and Garchomp. Choice Band Dragonite can break holes, check Celebi and Breloom, and use Extreme Speed to pick off sweepers that set up on Keldeo like Dragonite, Gyarados, and Calm Mind Latios. This set also works on sand teams thanks to it improving their difficult hyper offense matchup and still working well if rain teams win the weather war. Tyranitar can Pursuit trap many of Keldeo's checks, like Latios, Reuniclus, Jellicent, and Alakazam, if holding a Chople Berry. It can also set Stealth Rock and use Thunder Wave to cripple the Pokemon that try to set up on Keldeo, like Dragonite and Gyarados. Psychic-types like Reuniclus, Latios, and Alakazam can punish Tentacruel and Amoonguss, appreciate appreciate it threatening Tyranitar and Steel-types, and provide more help against offensive teams. Focus Sash Alakazam, in particular, can handle setup sweepers like Dragonite and Gyarados through Encore or hitting them hard with Hidden Power Ice and Psychic. Heatran beats Amoonguss and Celebi, sets Stealth Rock, and spreads status. It can also run Magma Storm to trap Keldeo's checks while appreciating it checking Tyranitar and Ground-types and providing a better matchup against offensive teams. Excadrill can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards, which helps Keldeo's longevity immensely, and handle Jirachi and Reuniclus lacking Focus Blast. It benefits from Keldeo beating Ground- and Steel-types like Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Ferrothorn and its good matchup against rain and hyper offense teams. Ferrothorn and Skarmory can get up entry hazards to wear Keldeo's switch-ins down. Ferrothorn switches into Latios and can even use Knock Off to remove Leftovers from the Pokemon that can switch into Keldeo, while Skarmory switches into Ground-types, phases out Dragonite and Gyarados, and prevents Spikes with Taunt.</p>"

      "Leftovers Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is chosen over Hydro Pump and Surf due to its solid power, reliability, and ability to burn common switch-ins like Latios, Tentacruel, Rotom-W, and Politoed. Hidden Power Ice beats Dragonite and hits Garchomp, Latios, and Breloom hard. Hidden Power Ghost lets Keldeo more easily make progress against teams with Jellicent while also better threatening Celebi, Reuniclus, and Starmie and maintaining a way to hit Latios. Hidden Power Bug hits the same Psychic-types while also hitting Celebi much harder. However, this leaves Keldeo walled by Jellicent as well as Hidden Power Ice targets like Dragonite. Protect allows Keldeo to rack up burn and sand damage on the opponent, scout Choice-locked moves, and, if sand isn't up, recover health with Leftovers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers lets Keldeo not get worn down by the sand often accompanying this set, making it more able to check threats like Gliscor, Heatran, and Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set works well on sand teams thanks to it giving a better matchup against problematic hyper offense teams, not being worn down by sand while its checks are, and being able to check opposing sand teams with its STAB combination and typing. Tyranitar can set Stealth Rock and Pursuit trap many of Keldeo's checks, like Latios, Reuniclus, Jellicent, and Alakazam, if holding a Chople Berry. Psychic-types like Reuniclus, Latios, and Alakazam can punish Tentacruel and Amoonguss and enjoy Keldeo dealing with Tyranitar and Steel-types. Choice Scarf Latios, in particular, can outspeed and check Pokemon like Breloom, Alakazam, Rotom-W, and Celebi while also being able to cripple bulky Pokemon Keldeo can't beat easily with Trick. Heatran beats Amoonguss and Celebi and can set Stealth Rock and spread status. It can also run Magma Storm to trap Keldeo's checks while appreciating Keldeo checking Tyranitar and Ground-types and providing a better matchup against offensive teams. Excadrill can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards, which helps Keldeo's longevity immensely, and handle Jirachi and Reuniclus lacking Focus Blast. It benefits from Keldeo beating Ground- and Steel-types like Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Ferrothorn and its good matchup against sand and hyper offense teams. Ferrothorn and Skarmory can get up entry hazards to wear Keldeo's switch-ins down. Ferrothorn switches into Latios and can even use Knock Off to remove Leftovers from the Pokemon that can switch into Keldeo, while Skarmory switches into Ground-types and prevents Spikes with Taunt. Choice Scarf users like Latios, Garchomp, and Tyranitar provide a better matchup against faster offensive threats and enjoy Keldeo potentially burning bulkier threats with Scald and wearing down bulky threats like Ferrothorn, Gliscor, and Heatran. Grass-types like Celebi and Ferrothorn are better able to answer Water-types like Jellicent, Gastrodon, opposing Keldeo, and Rotom-W while benefitting greatly from Keldeo beating Fire- and Steel-types.</p>"

      "Toxic + Protect": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic lets Keldeo punish and wear down many of its switch-ins like Latios, Jellicent, and Politoed. It's especially potent alongside the sandstorm that Tyranitar provides. Protect allows Keldeo to rack up Toxic and burn damage, scout Choice-locked moves, and, if sand isn't up, recover health with Leftovers. Scald lets Keldeo potentially cripple switch-ins immune to Toxic like Tentacruel and Amoonguss, and provides it with a spammable STAB attack that can still cripple other Pokemon. Secret Sword gives Keldeo a secondary STAB move and lets it punish switch-ins resistant to Scald and certain Toxic absorbers that Scald isn't effective against, like Ferrothorn and Chansey.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Keep Keldeo healthy so it can check the Pokemon it's supposed to like Heatran, Gliscor, and Tyranitar. If you predict a switch to a Pokemon that hates taking a burn, but absorbs Toxic, such as Tentacruel and Amoonguss, use Scald on the switch to fish for a burn. However, if you predict your opponent to switch to a Pokemon that hates taking Toxic, use Toxic as they switch in. Try to keep sand up, as the chip damage it provides is part of what makes this set so hard to deal with in the first place. Get up entry hazards with a hazard setter when given the opportunity so you can further chip down the Pokemon that switch into Keldeo and make switching into Keldeo even harder. Don't use Protect on Pokemon that can take advantage of it, like Spikes or Stealth Rock Ferrothorn and Toxic Spikes or Substitute Tentacruel. Use Protect to scout what move a Pokemon potentially holding a Choice item will lock into as well as accumulate more residual damage alongside Toxic or burn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tyranitar, especially the Chople Berry variant, is an excellent partner for Keldeo, since it can Pursuit trap many of Keldeo's checks and counters, like Latios, Alakazam, and Reuniclus, while getting up Sandstorm; as the chip damage it provides is a big component of what makes this set work to begin with. Tyranitar can also get Stealth Rock up to punish switch-ins further. Psychic-types like Reuniclus, Latios, and Alakazam can all punish Tentacruel and Amoonguss while appreciating the fact that Keldeo can check Tyranitar and Steel-types and the constant chip damage from sand and the status effects Keldeo can spread. Heatran beats Amoonguss, has good defensive synergy with Keldeo, and can even use Magma Storm to trap Pokemon as well as accrue additional chip in addition to status and sand. It also appreciates Keldeo checking Tyranitar and spreading status to make Pokemon faint to residual damage more quickly. Excadrill can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards, which helps Keldeo and its teammates come in much more easily while handling Jirachi and Reuniclus lacking Focus Blast. It benefits from Keldeo beating Ground- and Steel-types like Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Skarmory as well. Ferrothorn and Skarmory can get up Spikes, which punishes switch-ins even further on top of the residual damage that Keldeo generates. Ferrothorn switches into Latios and can even use Knock Off to remove potential Leftovers from the Pokemon that can switch into Keldeo, while Skarmory switches into Ground-types and prevents Spikes from going up on your side of the field with Taunt.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind allows Keldeo to boost its Special Attack to ridiculous levels, letting it muscle through common checks like Tentacruel and Politoed, more easily than other variants. Hydro Pump is the preferred Water-type STAB move on this set due to its greater power than Scald allowing it to net some notable KOs, specifically against Garchomp and Reuniclus. Secret Sword is a consistent Fighting-type STAB move that allows Keldeo to heavily damage specially defensive Pokemon like Chansey and Ferrothorn that can switch into Hydro Pump. For the last slot, Hidden Power Ghost or Hidden Power Dark is the preferred coverage move of choice due to the ability to hit both Jellicent and Latios, two of Keldeo's most common checks as well as Celebi. Hidden Power Dark has the added benefit of not lowering Keldeo's IVs in exchange for being less effective against fringe targets, namely Toxicroak. If Hydro Pump's poor accuracy is unappealing, Scald can be used instead as a more consistent STAB move that can cripple common answers to Keldeo like Amoonguss and Tentacruel with a burn, but the power decrease is quite noticeable. Substitute can be used over Hidden Power Ghost alongside Toxic Spikes from another teammate, as Substitute turns the tables on traditional checks like Gastrodon and Tentacruel that rely on inflicting Keldeo with status. However, the loss of coverage against Hidden Power Ghost's targets is very noticeable, specifically against Jellicent and Celebi. Alternatively, Hidden Power Grass can be run to hit Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Jellicent at the same time, but the coverage is sorely missed against Latios and Celebi.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers increases Keldeo's longevity over the course of the match, counteracting damage taken from sand and entry hazards, allowing it to check Pokemon like Tyranitar and Gliscor more consistently. Alternatively, Lum Berry can be used to bluff a Choice Scarf set, making it easier to set up Calm Mind, and provides a buffer against status effects.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is fairly straightforward, functioning as a wallbreaker that performs particularly well against balance teams. Use rain-boosted Hydro Pump and Secret Sword to wear down the opposing team early-game. Then, once the opposing team has been adequately weakened, send in Keldeo on a Pokemon that it threatens, such as Excadrill or Gliscor, and either use Calm Mind or Substitute on the switch or scout depending on the situation and sweep if possible. It should be noted that Calm Mind and Substitute can be used in a similar fashion early-game to break the opposing team, but they aren't necessarily as efficient as attacking in some of those situations, particularly because Keldeo's HP can be essential for checking key threats like Gliscor and Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Keldeo fits well on both rain and sand teams that want an effective wallbreaker to break down defensive Water- and Grass-types. Politoed makes for an excellent partner, as rain boosts Hydro Pump's power significantly and makes it very dangerous to switch into without an immunity. If using Substitute, Toxic Spikes Tentacruel is an amazing partner, as Toxic Spikes can wear down Pokemon like Jellicent and Gastrodon that are problematic for Keldeo to deal with otherwise. Agility Thundurus-T is an effective partner, as it appreciates Keldeo's ability to break down Grass-types like Amoonguss and Ferrothorn that would trouble it otherwise. If opting for a coverage move over Substitute, Keldeo fits particularly well on offensive sand teams due to its ability to punch holes in teams and put pressure on Latios, making Tyranitar less required to check it. Late-game cleaners like Calm Mind Reuniclus and Choice Scarf Garchomp also appreciate Keldeo's ability to punch holes in teams in general to make way for a potential sweep.</p>"
