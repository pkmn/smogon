    "overview": "<p>Fantastic defenses, resistance to Dragon-, Ice-, Dark-, and Ghost-type moves, and array of useful support moves make Registeel very useful in the Uber tier. What is most useful about Registeel is that in Ubers, rain is a common field condition, alleviating Registeel of its Fire-type weakness. Registeel also provides a complete counter to some of the most common Pokemon in the tier, such as Giratina-o and Choice Scarf Palkia.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic can be useful over Thunder Wave in order to deal with Lugia and Groudon switch-ins, but won't likely support the team as much, as many of Registeel's preferred teammates would enjoy their common counters becoming paralyzed. Earthquake or Iron Head can be used to deal with Dialga and Mewtwo respectively. Iron Head also gives Registeel an attack against Darkrai, although many Darkrai will simply put Registeel to sleep, Nasty Plot, and then Focus Blast. Thunder is a final option to deal damage to many common Pokemon while also providing a chance of paralysis, but the damage is pretty low when you factor in the only 30% chance of paralysis compared to Thunder Wave's 100% chance.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Registeel's best counter is by far Groudon who is immune to Thunder Wave, has huge defense, can hit Registeel super-effective with STAB Earthquake, and provides sun to further increase Registeel's weakness to Fire-type attacks. Other solid counters include Bulk Up Dialga and Substitute Ho-oh, both of whom Registeel can't touch outside of Explosion. Much like in OU, Registeel's biggest weakness is that it can not defend against the most common Spikers in the tier.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set beefs up Registeel's already high Special Defense in order to take the most common attacks from the Uber metagame. Because of Registeel's excellent Steel-typing, it can provide to you an excellent check to many of the most common Uber Pokemon, while simultaneously supporting the team with Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is always useful to have, and Registeel is a reliable Pokemon to set it up. especially in the face of many Choice Scarfed Dragon-type attacks. Thunder Wave is extremely useful for crippling a wide range of Pokemon in the Uber tier, such as Latias, Latios, and Lugia. Ice Punch is Registeel's offensive move of choice, but don't expect too much out of it, given Registeel's mediocre offenses. Explosion can be used to go out with a bang, and will leave dents in almost everything that doesn't resist it. Toxic deserves a mention for the ability to cripple walls like Lugia, Giratina, and Groudon (on the switch-in), and may be used over Thunder Wave. Make your choice depending on the team's needs.</p> <p>The EVs lean towards Special Defense, with a small investment in Attack and Defense. The Attack EVs allow a guaranteed 2HKO on min/min Rayquaza with Ice Punch, and an OHKO on Latias with Explosion, with Stealth Rock in play. 80 Defense EVs allow you to be almost never 2HKOed by an Adamant, once Dragon Danced Rayquaza with Outrage, allowing you to cripple it with Thunder Wave, or if it is within range, flat out KO it. Additionally, Modest Choice Specs Kyogre's Thunder will be a 3HKO, allowing you to either paralyze it, poison it, or Explode on it, all of which will severely hinder its sweep.</p> <p>While it can survive against Dragon Dance Rayquaza locked into Outrage, DO NOT keep Registeel in against Swords Dance variants. This is because the Swords Dance variants run Dragon Claw instead of Outrage, and hence can simply Earthquake for the KO. You should also beware of Earthquake from any other variant of Rayquaza, especially Dragon Dance Rayquaza, since it will do a ton of damage, with a small chance of an OHKO. Additionally, do not even try to switch in Registeel onto Kyogre unless it is locked into Thunder or Ice Beam, as its STAB attacks OHKO Registeel in the rain.</p> <p>To get the most out of Registeel, partner it with an offensive Kyogre to provide rain support while also luring in Dragon-types who resist Water Spout. Registeel can switch in on most of these Pokemon, allowing it to either spread paralysis or simply explode. Other useful teammates include defensive Lugia and Ho-oh. Both of these Pokemon are resist Fighting-type attacks and are immune to Ground-type ones, while simultaneously providing support against many of Registeel's common switch-ins, including Groudon, Skarmory, and Forretress.</p> <p>Registeel may resist the premiere attacking types in Ubers, but is still weak against Ground- and Fighting-type attacks. It also suffers from a lack of reliable recovery. To these ends, Latias is a fantastic partner for Registeel, providing Wish support for the metal hunk, as well as having awesome defensive synergy with Registeel. Latios is also a decent partner, as Earthquakes aimed at Registeel give him free switch-ins to start wreaking havoc. Someone to take care of Rayquaza is also preferable, such as physically defensive Groudon. Speaking of Groudon, it absolutely mauls Registeel, so having someone like Wobbuffet, Giratina, Lugia, or Scarf Shaymin to check it is preferable.</p> "

  "Infernape": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Infernape may seem to be outclassed by other Uber attackers, it certainly has several key advantages. Infernape's unique Speed stat and offenses combined with its large movepool allow it to become a deadly wallbreaker in the Ubers environment. Although it may not be as powerful as other wallbreakers, such as Rayquaza, Palkia, and Dialga, it still has a number of qualities that many Uber Pokemon would kill for. This includes an immunity to Will-O-Wisp, access to STAB Close Combat which allows it to destroy Blissey without being forced to use Outrage, and U-turn for potent scouting. Infernape can be a real force in the Uber tier if played right and it should definitely be accounted for when making your team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Infernape is quite frail, so you'll always want to capitalize on its Speed and offenses. You will always want at least 212 Speed EVs with a boosting nature to outspeed the standard Timid Lugia and Latias. From there, just maximize your offenses however you see fit, although emphasizing Attack is recommended since most Ubers have lower Defense, thus maximizing Infernape's damage output.</p> <p>Infernape's best move options are listed in its sets already. Infernape can utilize Nasty Plot along with Fire Blast, Focus Blast, and Grass Knot or Hidden Power Ice to become a special attacking threat, but the lower accuracy of the STAB moves and the generally higher Special Defense of Uber Pokemon makes this a less effective choice than a more physically inclined set. Taunt can have some use on the lead set to stop support Pokemon, such as Groudon and Dialga, from setting up Stealth Rock. Mach Punch is an option on the Swords Dance set if one feels that they need a priority move to pick off faster threats after set up, though the only targets it is useful against are Choice Scarf Dialga and Darkrai. Fake Out is usable on the lead set to allow Infernape to KO Deoxys-S with Fake Out + Fire Blast without needing another teammate to do it, but this will force Infernape to sacrifice Stealth Rock or one of its other attacks. The best move to put it over is most likely U-turn if you feel like you really need it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Giratina and Giratina-O resist or are immune to both of Infernape's STAB moves, and they both have powerful STAB Dragon-type attacks with which to dispatch the flaming monkey. However, neither Giratina nor Giratina-O will enjoy a boosted Shadow Claw from the Swords Dance set, and minimum HP Giratina-O is 2HKOed by a Choice Banded Shadow Claw after taking Stealth Rock damage. Latios and Latias also resist both of Infernape's STABs, are faster, and have powerful Dragon-type STAB moves to dispose of it. However, they risk getting badly injured by U-turn or Shadow Claw. Rayquaza can come in on any of Infernape's attacks, barring Stone Edge, and has a powerful Extreme Speed to pick off a mildly weakened Infernape. However, be aware that Rayquaza can only switch into Close Combat once if Stealth Rock is up. In the absence of Stealth Rock, Ho-Oh stops Infernape cold if it does not have Stone Edge. Kyogre who run a ton of HP and Defense EVs can also stop Infernape, but Close Combat will still do a lot of damage. Wobbuffet can pick off Choice Band Infernape locked into Close Combat, Stone Edge, or Flare Blitz in rain.</p> <p>Any Pokemon faster than Infernape, such as Darkrai, Mewtwo, Shaymin-S, and Pokemon with a Choice Scarf such as Dialga, Palkia, and Garchomp, can stop it handily. However, keep in mind that Infernape can deal a lot of damage to them so be careful when switching them in.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Infernape's high Speed stat, large movepool, and decent offenses turn it into one of the most threatening mixed attackers and wallbreakers in the Uber tier. Once in, the flaming monkey will swiftly deliver a 2HKO to even the toughest of Uber walls, except Giratina.</p> <p>The set's play style is simple -- get Infernape in on a Pokemon whom it can scare out or on a weak resisted attack and proceed to let loose. Close Combat is Infernape's main attack, and while one might think that it may be ineffective in Ubers with so many Psychic-types running around, it still absolutely mauls quite a few Pokemon. Blissey, Dialga, Tyranitar, and Heatran are all OHKOed, while Palkia, Garchomp, and Kyogre are all 2HKOed. Fire Blast KOes all Groudon after they have switched into Close Combat once, burns most Steel-types to a crisp, and 2HKOes Mewtwo. With Stealth Rock support, Lugia is KOed by a combination of Fire Blast and Stone Edge. Overheat is also a viable option. It almost always OHKOes Mewtwo if the sun is shining, and it will also OHKO Lugia after Stealth Rock damage provided Blaze is activated. Speaking of Blaze, with it activated, Infernape's Fire Blast/Overheat attacks will become quite deadly - the latter is so strong that it 2HKOes Naive Giratina-O after Stealth Rock damage! U-turn allows Infernape to scout the opposing team while also doing massive damage to the many Psychic-types, like Latias and Latios, who may want to switch in on Infernape. Stone Edge OHKOes Rayquaza and Ho-Oh without question, as well as also 2HKOing Lugia after Stealth Rock damage, just in case the weather is not favorable.</p> <p>This set has massive problems with Giratina, Giratina-O, Latias, and Latios. All four resist both of Infernape's STAB moves, do not take much from its other attacks, and can retaliate with their STAB Dragon-type moves. However, Latios and Latias must be wary of U-turn, which deals significant damage and also allows the Infernape user to bring in a counter for free. Also, note that slower variants of Latias are outsped, preventing them from effectively checking Infernape. Mewtwo is faster than Infernape and has a powerful Thunder with which to 2HKO Infernape. Physically defensive Kyogre can also come in on anything, bar Close Combat, and drown Infernape with Surf. Rayquaza also resists both of Infernape's STAB moves and has Extreme Speed to pick it off. Finally, any Choice Scarf user, such as Dialga, Palkia, and Garchomp, is extremely threatening to Infernape, as it can easily KO the flaming monkey before it gets a chance to react. Choice Scarf Dialga is an excellent answer to Giratina, Giratina-O, Rayquaza, Latios, Latias, and Mewtwo (although Dialga must watch out for potential Aura Spheres that might be aimed at Infernape), as it outspeeds and OHKOes all of them with Draco Meteor. Latias counters Kyogre very well, thanks to her superb bulk and powerful Thunder; she can also deal with both formes of Giratina if she has enough health. Scizor has U-turn and Bullet Punch to easily pick off Latios, Latias, Mewtwo, and Rayquaza locked into Outrage. Groudon provides sunlight to power up Fire Blast and it deals with most Rayquaza and Choice Scarf Garchomp very well with its high Defense stat. Wobbuffet's Shadow Tag ability and access to Counter and Mirror Coat allow it to trap and KO Choice Scarf users, as well as some Latios, Latias, and Mewtwo, quite easily.</p> <p>Infernape is rather hard to switch in because he is very frail. Wobbuffet is a good Pokemon to pair with Infernape since the blue blob can Encore stat boosting and status moves, which are rendered useless by Safeguard, to help Infernape get in safely. Using someone like Latias who attracts moves like Pursuit can also help Infernape get a free switch in. Getting it in on something it can scare out, such as Blissey, a Choice-user locked into a move Infernape resists, Forretress, Skarmory, Bronzong, or Tyranitar can also help. Infernape's good Speed and formidable offensive might means that he is a good choice to send out after one of your other teammates falls in battle.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>The use of Choice Band eliminates Life Orb recoil while still allowing Infernape to pose a huge offensive threat. The main draw of this set is Flare Blitz, which when coupled with the sunlight, can 2HKO almost everything in Ubers. Although the recoil will quickly KO Infernape, this set is more designed to be a hole puncher than a sweeper.</p> <p>Provided the weather is sunny and Stealth Rock is up, Infernape can OHKO Ho-Oh and 2HKO Lugia, most Giratina-O, Latias, Rayquaza, Latios, Impish Groudon, and Garchomp with Flare Blitz, despite the fact that most of those Pokemon resist Fire-type attacks! Flare Blitz will also OHKO any Steel-type Pokemon not named Heatran. Should Blaze be activated, Infernape's Flare Blitz can even 2HKO Palkia! Close Combat allows Infernape to OHKO Palkia after a layer of Stealth Rock and Spikes have been put down, and it 2HKOes even physically defensive variants of Kyogre. It also gives Infernape a back up sweeping attack in case the weather is not in its favor. U-turn allows Infernape to scout for counters, and it also deals enormous damage to Mewtwo, Latios, Latias, and Darkrai. Shadow Claw allows Infernape to 2HKO Giratina-O after Stealth Rock damage just in case the weather is not sunny. Stone Edge is also a worthwhile option to always OHKO Rayquaza and Ho-Oh. It also always 2HKOes Lugia after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Groudon is highly recommended for use alongside this set because it provides the sunlight that makes Flare Blitz so deadly. Groudon can also help Infernape by paralyzing things such as Latias and Latios, allowing Infernape to 2HKO with its STAB moves before they can Recover off the damage or OHKO Infernape. Groudon can also set up Stealth Rock, which is absolutely required for this set for Infernape to grab the KOes mentioned previously.</p> <p>Giratina is the only Pokemon who can switch in on this set without any fear at all. Its huge HP means that Infernape will wear itself down quickly with recoil damage, and Shadow Claw only 5HKOes Giratina factoring in Leftovers. For this reason, packing a reliable Giratina counter is highly encouraged. Bulk Up Dialga is a good partner for Choice Band Infernape, as Giratina cannot do anything to it at all while Dialga can Bulk Up as much as it wants, Rest off Giratina's burns, and eventually KO Giratina with its powerful Outrage. Infernape can also help out Dialga by weakening Groudon. Flare Blitz will often do so much damage to Groudon that, at the cost of sacrificing Infernape, it will be left too weak to fight off Dialga. Aside from this, the same partners from the previous set also work well with this one.</p> <p>Unlike the other Infernape sets, Wobbuffet can be a serious problem, as it can switch into a Choiced Close Combat, Stone Edge, or Flare Blitz in the rain and threaten to KO Infernape with Counter. Unfortunately, because Wobbuffet has no true counters due to Shadow Tag, the best thing you can do is attempt to lure in Wobbuffet with mixed attackers that bluff a Choice Scarf, or use Close Combat sparingly early in the game.</p> "

        "name": "Lead",
        "description": "<p>Infernape's good Speed allows it to set up Stealth Rock quickly and reliably against nearly every lead while also being able to cause some damage later in the game, making it a good choice of lead for an offensive team.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is Infernape's best support move, and it is highly beneficial to Infernape's teammates, helping them to secure more KOs. U-turn allows Infernape to scout the opponent's team while breaking Deoxys-S's or Deoxys-A's Focus Sash, allowing you to go to a priority user or a faster Pokemon to finish them off. It is highly recommended to have either priority or a Choice Scarf user along with this Infernape to minimize the layers of entry hazards Deoxys-S or Deoxys-A is able to put down, lest your team be hacked apart by the combined damage from Stealth Rock and Spikes. Close Combat destroys Dialga and allows Infernape to 2HKO Kyogre leads, thanks to its Focus Sash protecting it from Surf. You lose to Choice Scarf Kyogre leads, however, as they are faster. Fire Blast destroys Scizor, Forretress, and Metagross leads, while 2HKOing Groudon. Overheat is also option if one wants the extra power for taking on threats, such as specially defensive Groudon. The EVs are the same as the previous set, since they allow Infernape to get the KOs on the necessary leads.</p> <p>Infernape will lose to Darkrai leads due to Dark Void, so carrying a sleep absorber on your team is recommended. Sleep Talk Kyogre is a good choice, since it also beats Ho-Oh, who will wall this Infernape set due to the lack of Stone Edge. Kyogre's rain will not hurt Infernape, as Fire Blast, which is negatively affected during rain, will still KO most of the targets it needs to. Having a priority user is also recommended to finish off leads who Infernape will U-turn out of, such as Mewtwo and Deoxys formes. Scizor is a particularly good choice, since it can also beat Choice Scarf Shaymin-S leads, whom Infernape loses to if Shaymin-S flinches it with Air Slash; Scizor can also Pursuit Mewtwo and Deoxys formes, should they switch out. Rayquaza benefits from the Stealth Rock laid down by Infernape, and it also has a strong priority move in Extreme Speed.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Although somewhat tricky to set up, Infernape can become a viciously powerful offensive threat after just one Swords Dance, capable of OHKOing or 2HKOing everything in Ubers.</p> <p>Close Combat is the primary attack of this set, and will absolutely devastate any Pokemon who does not resist it, OHKOing foes such as Dialga, Palkia, Kyogre, Scizor, and many others. Stone Edge covers most Flying-types whom Infernape is likely to face. After a Swords Dance, Ho-Oh and Rayquaza are both OHKOed, as is Lugia after Stealth Rock damage. Shadow Claw grants Infernape perfect coverage and is the best option against Latias, Latios and Giratina(-O). It also 2HKOes Giratina and Giratina-O after a Swords Dance, although the former will require Stealth Rock damage. Flare Blitz can be used over Shadow Claw if one has sunlight support from Groudon. In said sunlight, Flare Blitz will still 2HKO Latias, Latios, and Giratina-O, and it also OHKOes even defensive Mewtwo, something Shadow Claw can't always manage. However, the primary use of Flare Blitz is to OHKO Groudon after a Swords Dance, meaning it can no longer stop Infernape from sweeping.</p> <p>As for EVs, max Attack and Speed EVs are necessary for maximum sweeping potential. Jolly is preferred to Adamant, as the latter does not get any special KOs and Infernape really needs to outspeed as many things as it can, as it cannot take many hits. Life Orb gives Infernape a much needed power boost.</p> <p>Swords Dance Infernape's main issues are defensive Groudon, any faster Pokemon, and actually setting up. Wobbuffet is by far the best teammate for Swords Dance Infernape, since it can trap and kill most Groudon and Choice Scarf users while using Encore to give Infernape much needed opportunities to set up. Using Psychic-type Pokemon to bait Pursuit from Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Scizor is a good idea to help Infernape set up as well. Other than that, the same teammates from the Physical Mix Infernape set work very well with this one. Kyogre may seem like an odd partner for Infernape at first glance, but with Thunder Wave, it can cripple Latios, Latias, and Palkia switch-ins, thus allowing Infernape to break past them when it sets up later. If Infernape is not using Flare Blitz, Drizzle can actually help Infernape by letting it set up on Choiced Fire-type attacks.</p> "

Gengar has access to STAB Shadow Ball to hit the many Psychic- and Ghost-types of Ubers for super effective damage. It also gains very useful Normal- and Fighting-type immunities with its Ghost typing, the former allowing it to revenge kill Rayquaza, who would normally annihilate faster Pokemon with a boosted Extreme Speed. It has its downsides, however, as its paper-thin defenses will crumble under any attack that isn't Ground-, Normal-, Bug-, or Fighting-type. If you can see past its extreme frailty, though, Gengar can be a force to reckon with.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder or Energy Ball can be used to hit Kyogre and/or Groudon harder. However, Latias or Palkia can generally deal with Kyogre and Groudon better, although it still can be handy if your team does not have one of these two. Explosion is another possibility on the Choice Scarf set, as it provides a fast way to almost instantly take out a Pokemon (remember to use a Hasty nature in this case). Destiny Bond is a possibility, as you can eliminate specific counters to your other Pokemon as well as threaten any would-be counters to Gengar. Finally, Substitute is a possibility on the Life Orb set to aid in prediction, but will mean Gengar loses a lot of HP from Substitute + Life Orb.</p> <p>A Choice Specs set is also possible, as Gengar has very good Special Attack and Speed stats. However, Gengar loses its ability to revenge kill as effectively (which is really its niche), and the role of Choice Specs user is better filled by by Mewtwo, Kyogre, Palkia, or Dialga.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Pursuit users give Gengar a lot of problems, especially Choice Scarf users, as they can OHKO Gengar even if it doesn't switch out. The common Pursuit users in Ubers are Tyranitar, Scizor, and Metagross. Of these, Metagross is probably the most threatening, as Gengar can't OHKO it even with a predicted super effective attack. Specially defensive Jirachi can paralyze Gengar with Thunder Wave and wear it down with Iron Head while healing itself with Wish.</p> <p>Kyogre can be a problem for Gengar, since it has high base HP and Special Defense stats. Without Explosion or Thunder, Gengar will not be able to deal with a Kyogre who has Calm Mind + Rest / Sleep Talk. Ho-Oh will take little damage from Gengar that lack Thunder or Explosion (note that Thunder only has 50% accuracy in the sun) and OHKO Gengar with Brave Bird or Sacred Fire.</p> <p>Finally, Blissey will pose a large problem for Gengar unless it carries Explosion. Blissey is immune to Gengar's STAB Shadow Ball, and it also takes pitiful damage from its other moves. Also, even when Gengar uses Explosion, it can be predicted with a switch to a Ghost-type. This will cause Gengar to basically kill itself while doing absolutely no damage.</p> ",

Hidden Power Ice is used to eliminate threats such as Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Shaymin-S. Shadow Ball is Gengar's main attacking move, as it hits Pokemon like Mewtwo, Latios, Latias, and Giratina super effectively and gains STAB. Focus Blast can hurt Darkrai and Lucario, both of which are outsped by Choice Scarf Gengar (unless Darkrai has a Choice Scarf of its own). Trick can be used as a last ditch effort, and only should be considered when Gengar is low on HP or if it is truly imperative to cripple an opposing wall, sweeper, or Wobbuffet.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Gengar does not need much support since it will mainly be picking off already weakened enemies. However, it will be as good as dead if you do not take precautions by eliminating your opponent's Pursuit-users, most commonly Scizor, Tyranitar, and Metagross. Scizor can lured by a Mewtwo with Fire Blast, since most Mewtwo have Ice Beam and Aura Sphere and are quite vulnerable to Scizor. Metagross can be dealt with in a similar way. Tyranitar is always 2HKOed by an Aura Sphere from Mewtwo. Calm Mind RestTalk Kyogre can Calm Mind and Rest in the face of these threats and use its boosted Surf to eliminate them. The only Pokemon of Scizor, Metagross, and Tyranitar who can threaten Kyogre is Metagross with its Explosion. While this will end up with Kyogre being defeated, it is also a way (albeit slightly perverse) of getting rid of Metagross.</p> <p>By having Gengar as a revenge killer who can revenge kill many of the Uber metagame's most deadly sweepers, you can let other would-be revenge killers, such as Palkia or Dialga, take on other roles on your team, such as mixed sets. Also, by crippling Wobbuffet with Trick, Gengar can prevent it from using its Encore + Counter/Mirror Coat combo, or stop it from setting up a sweeper. Similarly, by crippling a wall like Blissey with its Choice Scarf, Gengar can prevent it from doing its duties properly. It becomes much easier for Pokemon like Calm Mind Kyogre to sweep if Blissey can only use one move until it switches out. Gengar can also revenge kill Dragon-types like Garchomp and Rayquaza who are locked into Outrage. If you eliminate these threats, it will be much easier for a Dialga or a Rayquaza or Garchomp of your own to sweep, as they become much harder to revenge kill.</p> "

Gengar can OHKO Rayquaza 100% of the time with Icy Wind, as long as Stealth Rock is down (about 80% of the time without). Icy Wind also has the beneficial side effect of lowering your opponent's Pokemon's Speed by 1 stage, which allows Gengar to outspeed all Pokemon who reach a Speed stat of 522 (including base 100s with a +Speed nature and a Choice Scarf). By using Hidden Power Fire, Gengar can eliminate Scizor, which is OHKOed by Hidden Power Fire even when the sun is not out; however, it is only a 2HKO in the rain. Metagross, on the other hand, is 2HKOed by a Hidden Power Fire with no weather (in the sun it has a small chance to OHKO, but it's only a 3HKO in the rain). Tyranitar is also handled relatively easily, since there's a 100% chance of an OHKO even when Tyranitar has maximum HP and Special Defense and a +SpD nature as long as there is Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes up.</p> <p>Protect and Explosion are other possibilities for the set. Protect allows you to scout whether Metagross or Scizor are using Bullet Punch or Pursuit, which allows you to determine whether or not Gengar should stay in and use Hidden Power Fire. Explosion serves as a last ditch attempt to KO one of your opponent's Pokemon; make sure to use a Hasty nature though. It will do tremendous damage to any Pokemon who is not immune or resistant to it (Blissey will be OHKOed, and max HP Kyogre and Ho-Oh will be OHKOed after they take Stealth Rock damage).</p> <p>Since Gengar will be eliminating mainly Scizor and Tyranitar, it will be much easier for certain Pokemon to sweep or wall. Some Pokemon who will benefit from this are Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Lugia. A Calm Mind Mewtwo is normally stuck when facing Scizor, as Scizor resists Ice Beam and takes neutral damage from Aura Sphere (the two most common attacks) and can hit back for super effective damage with U-turn or Pursuit. Likewise, Nasty Plot Darkrai is usually in a pickle against Scizor unless the Sleep Clause is not activated or if Darkrai has near full health. Scizor can use U-turn or Superpower on it for super effective damage or Bullet Punch it for priority, as it is only truly threatened by a +2 Focus Blast (which also has a large chance of missing). Lugia can also play a much larger role in teams, whether it be sweeping or walling, after Tyranitar has been eliminated. Not only does Tyranitar deal huge amounts of damage to Lugia with Crunch, Stone Edge, or Pursuit, but it also brings the sandstorm, which chips away at Lugia's health. It will be much easier to use Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Lugia after Gengar has done its job.</p> "

On the other hand, it has assets that other Pokemon could only dream of having. With its Swift Swim ability, Qwilfish becomes the fastest Spiker in the rain, while access to Taunt, Explosion, and Destiny Bond allow it shut down numerous walls. Its Poison typing means that it can absorb the dreaded Toxic Spikes that plague many Ubers. With Swords Dance, Qwilfish can also become a deadly sweeper. Play Qwilfish to its strengths, and it will not disappoint.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Qwilfish doesn't really have many other options to use in Ubers, due to its relatively poor stats. Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall for more power at the cost of some accuracy. Return is a viable option for neutral coverage in place of Explosion. Haze quickly wipes away boosts in a pinch, but it is quite useless otherwise. Finally, a Choice Band set with Waterfall, Aqua Jet, Poison Jab, and Explosion can also be used to decent effect.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Rayquaza outspeeds Qwilfish and OHKOs it with almost any attack. It resists Waterfall, does not take much from Poison Jab, and only needs to watch out for Explosion. Groudon, Dialga, Giratina, and Giratina-O completely wall Qwilfish unless it uses Destiny Bond, but the former two must watch out for Swords Dance-boosted Explosion and Giratina cannot stop Qwilfish from setting up entry hazards. Just hit Qwilfish really hard, and it will not trouble you very much.</p> ",

        "name": "Utility",
        "description": "<p>This set aims to abuse as much of Qwilfish's support options as possible. This set can set up entry hazards, break stall, revenge kill, and even clean up weakened teams. The main idea is to switch Qwilfish into a wall that cannot hurt it, such as Blissey and Lugia. Qwilfish can then Taunt said wall, preventing it from using its support moves, and then set up entry hazards for free. When Qwilfish is low on health, simply use Destiny Bond or Explosion to bring the opponent down with it. Qwilfish also has the added bonus of absorbing Toxic Spikes upon switching in, which is a boon for teams with Pokemon susceptible to them, such as Kyogre and Palkia. Make sure to keep Qwilfish alive to reabsorb Toxic Spikes if they are likely to be up again.</p> <p>Spikes and Toxic Spikes are the two entry hazards that Qwilfish can set up. Choose the appropriate entry hazard that suits your team. Taunt allows Qwilfish to shut down walls. Waterfall is Qwilfish's preferred STAB attack, and is surprisingly powerful in the rain, capable of 2HKOing Garchomp. It can also revenge kill frailer, weakened threats, such as Darkrai and Mewtwo, and clean up late-game. Destiny Bond is preferred over Explosion because Qwilfish's Explosion fails to KO Groudon and Giratina, two of Qwilfish's biggest counters. However, Explosion can still be used since setup sweepers can potentially set up on Destiny Bond.</p> <p>Max Speed and a Jolly nature is preferred since it allows Qwilfish to outspeed and revenge kill Choice Scarf Darkrai and Shaymin-S. Splash Plate boosts Waterfall without causing recoil damage, although a Life Orb can be used if Explosion is chosen over Destiny Bond. Leftovers is another option for longevity, although Qwilfish is usually too frail to enjoy its benefits.</p> <p>Since Qwilfish needs the rain for Swift Swim to activate, Kyogre is an essential teammate as it has Drizzle, though having two Water-types on the same team spells an Electric-type weakness. Having a Garchomp, Dialga, or Arceus-Ground is helpful to absorb Electric-type attacks such as Thunder. Rayquaza troubles Qwilfish, since Air Lock nullifies Swift Swim, allowing the dragon to outspeed and OHKO Qwilfish. Choice Scarf Jirachi is an excellent check to both Dragon Dance and Swords Dance Rayquaza while Lugia can take on all variants of Rayquaza very effectively.</p> <p>Since Qwilfish is a highly effective hazard layer, spinblockers enhance its potency. The Giratina formes are fantastic spinblockers to use; both are able to defeat Groudon without much effort and resist Thunder. Arceus-Ghost is also usable, as it has reliable recovery. Pokemon that can stall effectively, such as Ludicolo, are great teammates for Qwilfish, especially if Qwilfish is using Toxic Spikes. While it might seem like an odd choice to use on a rain team, Heatran with Torment abuses Toxic Spikes well and patches up weaknesses to Arceus-Grass, Latias, and other Pokemon that rain teams have trouble with.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>With a passable base 95 Attack, Swords Dance, and doubled Speed with Swift Swim, Qwilfish can become a deadly sweeper given the opportunity. After a Swords Dance, rain-boosted Waterfall obliterates almost everything that does not resist it, while Poison Jab and Explosion destroy most of the Pokemon that do.</p> <p>Here are some damage calculations to illustrate Qwilfish's power. All calculations assume that Qwilfish is using an Adamant nature, and rain is present:</p> <ul> <li>+2 Waterfall vs. 252/64 Lugia 81.49% - 96.15%</li> <li>+2 Waterfall vs. 28/228 Wobbuffet 95.64% - 112.68%</li> <li>+2 Waterfall vs. 252/252+ Skarmory 76.35% - 90.12%</li> <li>+2 Waterfall vs. 0/0 Giratina-O 51.02% - 59.86%</li> <li>+2 Poison Jab vs. 4/0 Palkia 93.16% - 109.93%</li> <li>+2 Poison Jab vs. 252/0 Kyogre 81.19% - 95.79%</li> <li>+2 Explosion vs. 252/0 Dialga 131.93 - 155.19%%</li> </ul> <p>Max Attack and Speed capitalize on what Qwilfish does best. An Adamant nature guarantees the OHKO on Palkia with Poison Jab, but a Jolly nature can be used if you want Qwilfish to get the jump on Choice Scarf Darkrai and Shaymin-S. Taunt can be used in place of Explosion, but Qwilfish does not have the bulk to use it effectively. Destiny Bond could be used in place of Explosion to surprise the Giratina formes, while Spikes or Toxic Spikes can be used to help bluff a support set earlier in the match and use Swords Dance for a sweep later.</p> <p>Giratina and Giratina-O are full stops to Qwilfish, although Giratina-O needs to be reasonably healthy to stomach a +2 Waterfall in the rain. Rayquaza outspeeds Qwilfish as Air Lock cancels out Swift Swim, and can easily OHKO it. Groudon resists Poison and brings in the sun to deactivate Swift Swim and to weaken Waterfall. Dialga resists Waterfall and is immune to Poison Jab. However, both need to watch out for a Swords Dance-boosted Explosion. Lugia is an excellent defensive teammate who can check Giratina-O, Dialga, Rayquaza, and Groudon reasonably well. Darkrai, Arceus-Dark, and Arceus-Steel can set up on the Giratina formes; Latias can set up on Outrage-less Giratina. Mixed Bulk Up Dialga is a fantastic Groudon lure and can easily defeat it, aiding Qwilfish to sweep later. Finally, Wobbuffet support is almost essential for a frail sweeper like Qwilfish.</p> "

        "name": "Lead",
        "description": "<p>While this set seems awkward, Qwilfish can be a surprisingly effective lead in the Uber metagame. With Payback and Aqua Jet, it can easily 2HKO Deoxys-S, limiting it to one layer of entry hazards at most. Against bulkier leads, such as Groudon, Dialga, and Kyogre, it can usually set up one layer of hazards and Explode or set up two layers and die. It can always set up two layers against Kyogre, since Swift Swim allows it to outspeed even Choice Scarf Kyogre. The choice of entry hazard depends on your team. More offensively based teams tend to prefer Spikes, while Toxic Spikes suits defensive teams better. Explosion is the suicide move of choice as it prevents Forretress from spinning away one layer of Spikes. However, Destiny Bond can be used to surprise Groudon and Dialga leads, which Explosion would not OHKO.</p> <p>While Qwilfish is an effective lead, it will lose to Darkrai, who outspeeds and puts it to sleep with Dark Void. It also loses to faster leads and leads with priority, such as Giratina-O, Deoxys-A, and Rayquaza. Sleep Talk users such as Dialga and Kyogre are decent switch-ins to Darkrai, but must be wary of Trick. Choice Scarf Heracross is possibly the best switch-in to Darkrai to exist. Lugia is an excellent check to mixed attacking Giratina-O and Rayquaza. Bulky Steel-types such as Jirachi, Metagross, and Arceus-Steel can take on Deoxys-A, Giratina-O, and Rayquaza without much trouble too. Giratina-O is a great teammate, as it can block Rapid Spin and picks Deoxys-A off with Shadow Sneak. Giratina and Arceus-Ghost are also good spinblockers. Fast stallers, such as Shaymin-S, Ludicolo, and Torment Heatran, love Toxic Spikes support. Substitute + Calm Mind Kyogre also loves Toxic Spikes support as it allows Kyogre to defeat potential counters, while providing eternal rain for Qwilfish. If you choose to use Spikes on Qwilfish, then powerful sweepers such as Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Swords Dance Arceus are great teammates as they appreciate the extra damage from Spikes to finish off possible walls.</p> "

  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnezone's main niche in Ubers is its Steel-type trapping ability. Much like in OU, there are many Dragon-type sweepers in Ubers who appreciate the removal of Steel-types who impede their sweeps, and the fact that far fewer Steel-types in Ubers carry Ground-type attacks coupled with the fact that the use of Shed Shell is all but nonexistent, Magnezone can often open up massive holes in your opponent's team. Also, its unique defensive typing grants it resistances to many popular attacking types in Ubers, including Dragon-, Steel-, Bug-, Ghost-, and Dark-types, as well as the famous BoltBeam combination. Magnezone isn't without its weak points, however. It is very slow without a Choice Scarf and it is weak to the common Fire-, Ground-, and Fighting attacks that a lot of Ubers sweepers tend to carry. It also does not have any recovery outside of Rest to help it stand up to repeated hits. However, while Magnezone may sometimes be overlooked in the Ubers environment, it is certainly not to be underestimated.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Magnezone does have some other moves available to it. Hidden Power Ground allows Magnezone to hit Dialga for super effective damage, but otherwise it has little use. Thunder Wave makes up for Magnezone's low Speed by paralyzing enemy Pokemon, which in turn can benefit your teammates. Charge Beam has low Base Power, but may boost Magnezone's Special Attack, which can be of some use for sweeping combined with Substitute. It does not really sweep in the traditional sense, but Magnezone can easily switch in on Choice-locked Scizor or Jirachi and set up a Substitute, for example. It can then accumulate boots with Charge Beam behind a Substitute until the enemy's Steel-type has fainted, and then Magnezone can possibly KO another Pokemon if it still has a Substitute up or a Salac Berry Speed boost. Mirror Coat is somewhat usable to help make dealing with Scarf Dialga and Heatran in the rain easier, but otherwise its usefulness is limited.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Groudon and Garchomp take no damage from Electric-type attacks and will easily OHKO Magnezone with Earthquake. They both need to avoid switching in to Hidden Power Ice, however. Specially defensive Tyranitar can also destroy Magnezone with Earthquake, while only really fearing Flash Cannon. Blissey with Seismic Toss can handle anything except Explosion. Non-Choiced Dialga variants equipped with Fire-type attacks can also lure in Magnezone, outspeed, and destroy it. Opposing Magnezone can also trap your Magnezone and KO if the enemy Magnezone has Hidden Power Fire. Choice Scarf Heatran also makes Magnezone shiver, as it can outspeed Magnezone and smash it with Fire Blast or Earth Power.</p> <p>Anything faster than Magnezone who carries a super effective attack or that can set up on it poses a good option for eliminating Magnezone. The best choices for this are Mewtwo, Darkrai, Choice Scarf Palkia, and Choice Scarf Dialga, as none of them are weak to Magnezone's Thunder and can all either OHKO it or set up on it (although Darkrai and Mewtwo won't want to switch in).</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Magnezone may seem like an odd choice for a slot on an Ubers team, but in reality that is not so. Magnezone has very good and numerous resistances to Dragon-, Dark-, Ghost-, Ice-, Electric-, and Normal-type attacks, making it very easy to switch in. Furthermore, Magnezone's base 130 Special Attack stat means that it can hit as hard as, if not harder than, the monstrous attackers in Ubers play. It also has a unique role in the ability to trap Steel-types, making it a very good check to Scizor, Forretress, Bronzong, and Metagross. Choice Specs tops it all off, bringing Magnezone's Special Attack stat all the way up to 591, making it a great hole-puncher and Steel trapper.</p> <p>Magnezone's Thunder is extremely powerful and will likely OHKO or 2HKO any Pokemon who does not resist it. For example, Palkia, Mewtwo, Lugia, and specially defensive Forretress are all always OHKOed after SR damage. Because of Thunder's low accuracy, however, it is strongly recommended to have Kyogre on your team to boost Thunder's accuracy to 100%, making attacking much easier. Hidden Power Ice always OHKOes Garchomp and Rayquaza as well as dishing out well over 50% damage to Max HP Groudon. Thunderbolt is an alternate attack just in case weather conditions are not favorable for usage of Thunder, such as in sunlight. Explosion allows Magnezone to pick off Blissey and Latias, but an OHKO is not guaranteed without a little prior damage. Flash Cannon is an alternative move to use over Explosion, but its only real use is to deal heavy damage to Tyranitar.</p> <p>Max Special Attack is needed to do as much damage as possible with this set. 48 Speed EVs allows Magnezone to outrun most Scizor; that way it can fry the Steel Bug with Thunder before it can escape with U-turn or KO Magnezone with Superpower. The rest of the EVs go into HP for some nice bulk. Mild is the recommended nature if you're using Explosion, but if not, Modest is the preferred nature so as to not needlessly lower Magnezone's defenses.</p> <p>Groudon and Garchomp are both immune to Thunder, Magnezone's main attack, and can either OHKO it with Earthquake or set up for a sweep (both of them need to watch out for Hidden Power Ice, however). A defensive Kyogre is capable of handling Garchomp and Groudon with ease, as Kyogre can take most of their attacks and can OHKO back with Surf. Rest + Sleep Talk Kyogre with Calm Mind can also use Blissey (who walls this Magnezone) as mere setup fodder, as well as countering Darkrai and most Mewtwo quite effectively. Kyogre also provides valuable rain support, which aids Magnezone greatly by making its Thunder 100% accurate. Latias can also switch in on Ground-type attacks from Garchomp and Groudon with ease, and is capable of OHKOing both with Dragon Pulse and Grass Knot respectively. Latias also counters most Palkia sets quite decently, and benefits from Magnezone removing enemy Steel-types. Choice Scarf Garchomp also benefits from the absence of Steel-types, and is capable of checking Palkia, Darkrai, Mewtwo, Latias, and opposing Garchomp thanks to its powerful STAB Dragon-type moves. Wobbuffet can't really be countered; however, using mixed attackers or status moves, such as Toxic, are helpful and weakening it to the point where it can no longer handle Magnezone.</p> "

        "name": "Dual Screens",
        "description": "<p>Magnezone's good defenses and impressive slew of resistances allow it to become quite a good user of Reflect and Light Screen. Although this set may seem to be outclassed by Bronzong, who has Levitate and better overall defenses, Magnezone has resistances to Ghost-, Dark-, and Electric-type attacks, giving it additional opportunities to come in and set up. Magnezone also packs an all-important ability to trap Steel-types, allowing Magnezone to do much more team supporting for your sweepers than just setting up dual screens.</p> <p>Reflect and Light Screen are on the set for obvious reasons; the 8-turn boost to defenses can really aid your sweepers in doing their jobs. Thunder is a very strong STAB move that does significant damage to anything that does not resist it, notably OHKOing Skarmory and 2HKOing Forretress and Scizor after Stealth Rock damage. Hidden Power Fire is the preferred option in the fourth moveslot to allow Magnezone to KO Steel-types in the sunlight (Since it lowers Thunder's accuracy to 50%), but Explosion is another option to instantly remove a problem Pokemon and get in one of your sweepers in for free. If you don't have a need for Explosion, Thunderbolt can provide a reliable way of finishing off weakened Steel-type Pokemon. It can also be used over Thunder if your team does not have rain support, but the power drop is noticeable.</p> <p>The EVs are very straightforward. 48 Speed EVs allow Magnezone always to outrun 8 Speed Scizor, allowing it to deliver a fatal Thunder or Hidden Power Fire before the metal bug U-turns out to safety or uses Superpower in an attempt to KO Magnezone. Maximum HP is required so that Magnezone can take hits more easily while setting up. The remaining EVs go into Special Attack, backed with a Modest nature to give Magnezone enough power to kill enemy Steel-types.</p> <p>Magnezone focuses on assisting the team more than sweeping, so the best teammates for this set are sweepers than can abuse the dual screens and the removal of the foe's Steel-type Pokemon. The best choices by far for this role are offensive Dragon-types, as they can usually come in on most, if not all, of Magnezone's weaknesses, and can just spam their STAB moves with no repercussions thanks to the lack of Steel-type Pokemon on the enemy's side of the field. Rayquaza, Salamence, Latios, Latias, and Giratina-O are the best choices, since they resist all of Magnezone's weaknesses and have enough power and bulk to easily set up under the protection of the Reflect and Light Screen, which will often spell death for your opponent.</p> "

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This very similar to the Choice Specs set, but instead Magnezone attempts to beat a few of its counters with Magnet Rise. By using Magnet Rise, Magnezone gains an immunity to Ground-type attacks for five turns. When Groudon or Garchomp, two of Magnezone's biggest counters, switch in on Magnet Rise, they will often be unable to touch Magnezone, allowing it to OHKO and 2HKO Garchomp and Groudon respectively with Hidden Power Ice. Thunder is once again present as a powerful attack to hurt anything that does not resist it. Explosion is still an option to cripple Blissey, Latias, and Wobbuffet switch-ins. Substitute can be used over Explosion to ease prediction, guard against status, and to possibly get a free hit on an incoming switch-in to Magnezone. Toxic is also useful as it hinders Latias and Giratina-O as they attempt to set up as well as crippling Lugia and defensive Groudon.</p> <p>There are three possible items for this set. Life Orb grants Magnezone the most power for its attacks, but the recoil detracts from its ability to switch in, especially if Substitute is being used. Magnet still gives a nice boost to Thunder, and helps keep Magnezone's health intact while possibly letting Magnezone bluff a Choice item. Expert Belt is usable since it increases damage output on targets weak to Magnezone's attacks without the recoil backlash, but Pokemon neutral to Magnezone's attacks will not suffer quite as much damage.</p> <p>Any of the teammates for the Choice Specs set work just as well with this one since they run into trouble against similar threats. However, a notable offensive teammate that works really well in tandem with this set is Swords Dance Garchomp. Garchomp really appreciates Magnezone's ability to trap and KO Steel-type Pokemon as well as weakening opposing Garchomp and Groudon, making it much easier for Garchomp to sweep. Magnezone is also a pretty hard counter to most Lugia sets, and it can give its life to KO Latias with Explosion. Both of these Pokemon can revenge kill Garchomp easily, so having them removed is very beneficial to the land shark. Garchomp can also come in on Fire-type attacks thrown at Magnezone, and it easily uses Blissey as set-up bait.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Magnezone can easily use a Choice Scarf to remedy its middling Speed. Although it may seem inferior to Choice Scarf Magneton since Magneton, with its higher Speed, can revenge kill Darkrai and Shaymin-S, Magnezone is much bulkier. For example, many things that would only 3HKO Magnezone, 2HKO Magneton, such as Choice Scarf Palkia's Spacial Rend. If your team does not care about Darkrai or Shaymin-S, then Magnezone is definitely worth considering as a Choice Scarf user.</p> <p>Thunder is the main attacking move on this set, severely punishing anything that is not a Ground-type or Blissey. Hidden Power Ice complements Thunder quite nicely, forming a pseudo BoltBeam combination, which is unresisted in Ubers except by opposing Magnezone and Shedinja. It also allows Magnezone to check non-Choice Scarf Garchomp and Swords Dance Rayquaza, as Magnezone can outspeed and OHKO both with Hidden Power Ice (Magnezone also resists Extreme Speed in Rayquaza's case). Hidden Power Ice also allows Magnezone to inflict heavy damage to Groudon. Hidden Power Fire is an acceptable alternative if one does not want their ability to hurt Steel-types compromised by Thunder's accuracy being slashed by sunlight from Groudon. Thunderbolt is best in the third moveslot so Magnezone can still use a reliable STAB attack in case the weather is not suited for using Thunder. Flash Cannon is another viable option since it provides decent neutral coverage, its main use being to hit Tyranitar for super effective damage, who otherwise takes little from Magnezone's moves. Explosion rounds out the set quite nicely, taking out many special walls that Magnezone has trouble with at the cost of its own life. For example, Explosion deals 81.75% - 96.32% to 4 HP / 252 Defense Calm Blissey, meaning that with a little prior damage she will be OHKOed, which is great for opening up a sweep for one of your other Pokemon. Explosion also always OHKOes Latias after Stealth Rock damage, which is a great way to take out these otherwise problematic Pokemon.</p> <p>The EVs are pretty standard for a sweeper set. Max Speed with a Speed boosting nature is necessary for Magnezone, as it can outpace all base 110 Speed Pokemon. Max Special Attack is obvious so that Magnezone can hit as hard as possible. A Hasty nature is chosen over Timid to provide more power for Explosion.</p> <p>Although this Magnezone still likes the teammates mentioned in the Choice Specs set, more entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock and Spikes will be appreciated to help make up for this set's reduced power. Dialga shares weaknesses with Magnezone, but it is a reliable user of Stealth Rock that appreciates having Steel-type Pokemon removed, clearing the way for it to do major damage with its STAB Dragon-type moves. Froslass and Deoxys-S are both reliable users of Spikes, and the latter can also use Stealth Rock effectively.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Heatran fills a unique niche in the Uber tier thanks to its stellar typing and monstrous Special Attack. Heatran retains its role from the OU environment by toasting opposing Steel-types that stand in its way, as well as stopping any offensive Shaymin-S not packing Earth Power, something not a lot of other Pokemon can claim. Heatran also resists or is immune to four key attacking types commonly found in Ubers: Fire-, Ghost-, Dark-, and Dragon-type. While it may be literally scared to death by the ubiquitous Kyogre and the tiniest of earthly tremors, Heatran functions well in the Uber tier when partnered with Groudon and its ever-lasting sun. However, don't expect it to be able to take too much punishment.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Heatran is fully capable of running an offensive set consisting of Fire Blast, Dragon Pulse, Earth Power, and Explosion while holding either a Life Orb or a Choice item. Heatran's largest selling point when running such a set is the large number of resistances Heatran possesses. Heatran is generally a bit too frail to pull such a set off effectively, though, and there are many other Pokemon in Ubers that can fill the same role but with better offensive prowess. Dark Pulse is another attack that hits a lot of Pokemon in Ubers for super effective damage, but Heatran's other moves provide better overall coverage. If you're terrified of opposing Ho-Oh walking all over Heatran, you could run Stone Edge to quickly clip its wings; outside of that though, there isn't much use for it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Heatran is far more one dimensional in Ubers than in the OU environment, so don't fret too much when faced with one. Just remember, Ground-type attacks and Kyogre will absolutely wreck Heatran. Garchomp and offensive Groudon can easily stomp Heatran into the dust with STAB Earthquake, while Kyogre can maim it with Surf and has Drizzle to dampen Heatran's Fire-type attacks. Outside of those primary checks, there exist a few other Pokemon that can give Heatran a headache. Palkia and Manaphy can put Heatran down with STAB Surf, Lucario can outrun non-Scarf Heatran and tear it to pieces with Close Combat, and Ho-Oh can eliminate it with Earthquake if it gets in on a move outside of Toxic and Stone Edge. If Heatran lacks Dragon Pulse or Hidden Power Ice, then a whole slew of Dragon-types, including Giratina-O, Rayquaza, and even Salamence, can come in and threaten it. Latias and Latios can also beat Heatran if they have Thunder and the weather is rain. Those two should beware of Toxic, though, and avoid setting up unless you're sure that Heatran lacks Roar.</p> ",

        "name": "Stallbreaker",
        "description": "<p>Heatran appears to be an odd choice for a stallbreaker in the Uber tier at first, especially considering its weaknesses to common attacks of the Fighting-, Ground-, and Water-type. However, Heatran's excellent set of resistances and immunities, most notably to Dragon- and Fire-type attacks, coupled with its acceptable defensive stats give it ample opportunities to switch in and do its job. Heatran can force switches with Roar, compounding entry hazard damage; it can also use Taunt to prevent the likes of Bulk Up Dialga, Giratina, and Blissey from recovering their health. Of course, one cannot forget that Heatran still has Flash Fire and a magnificent Special Attack stat, and is capable of inflicting serious damage to the opposing team with its STAB Flamethrower.</p> <p>Flamethrower is the preferred attack due to its combination of consistency and power, but Lava Plume may be used instead for the increased chance of burning opposing Pokemon. Dragon Pulse allows Heatran to deal quick damage to Dragon-types and pairs well with its Fire-type STAB, hitting everything barring an opposing Heatran for at least neutral damage. However, Dragon Pulse isn't powerful enough to handle Latias and Latios due to their magnificent Special Defense and Recover. Toxic provides Heatran with a way to severely cripple the Dragon / Psychic twins, as well as the defensive behemoth known as Lugia. Finally, Protect can also be used in the last slot to scout for unexpected Earthquakes or Earth Powers from the likes of Giratina-O and Dialga. It also aids in prediction against Choiced opponents, and can help Heatran recover a bit more health with Leftovers. Toxic Spikes support is a must if you decide to use Protect, however, as Heatran loses some coverage without Dragon Pulse or Toxic.</p> <p>The EV spread on this set is fairly simple. 252 HP EVs grant Heatran extra overall bulk, while the Speed EVs allow it to outrun the standard defensive Groudon, Giratina, Dialga, and Deoxys-D. The remaining EVs are thrown into Special Defense to help Heatran switch into the dominant special attacks in the Ubers metagame, particularly the powerful Draco Meteors from the likes of Dialga, Palkia, Giratina-O, and mixed Rayquaza. The Special Defense EVs also give Heatran a bonus point, which is cool. Since this set's purpose is not to deal heavy damage to opposing Pokemon via attacking, no Special Attack investment is required.</p> <p>To fully realize this set's potential, a fair amount of support is required. First and foremost, entry hazards are absolutely crucial to this set's success. Forretress can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes—both of which contribute to the effectiveness of this set—and bait Fire-type attacks for Heatran to switch into. The ability to clear away entry hazards on your side of the field is also helpful, as Heatran is vulnerable to Spikes. Although Deoxys-S is incapable of using Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spin, it can quickly lay down Spikes so that Heatran may begin its rampage early. Deoxys-S can also set up Stealth Rock, but this Heatran prefers Spikes; setting up Stealth Rock can be left to other Pokemon. Groudon is without a doubt the best Pokemon for this role, as it also provides much-needed sunlight for Heatran. Additionally, Groudon can ward off physical Rayquaza and Tyranitar who would otherwise murder Heatran with Earthquake. Finally, a spinblocker is required so that the opponent cannot simply Rapid Spin the entry hazards away. Giratina-O is perfect for the job, as it also has excellent defensive synergy with Heatran. Giratina is another viable choice due to its higher defenses.</p> <p>By far the biggest threat to Heatran is Kyogre, as it can override the sun with Drizzle and OHKO Heatran with Surf. Latias is an excellent partner since she handles Kyogre with relative ease and has spectacular defensive synergy with Heatran. Palkia can defeat Choice Specs and Choice Scarf Kyogre thanks to its 4x resistance to Water-type attacks, but has trouble with Calm Mind variants. Heatran also covers Palkia's sole weakness to Dragon-type attacks. As this Heatran set has no form of recovery outside of Leftovers, other teammates that absorb Dragon-type attacks can relieve some of the stress from Heatran. Jirachi is a particularly good choice as it can also pass Wish to Heatran; be aware, however, that Jirachi compounds Heatran's weakness to Ground-type attacks. Scizor and the aforementioned Forretress are not weak to Ground-type attacks, and can take a few Dragon-type attacks as well. Both Pokemon are capable of defeating the occasional Earthquake Giratina-O, as it rarely carries both Hidden Power Fire and Earthquake. Blissey is also a great partner for Heatran as she can fulfill most of the requirements mentioned above, and can take care of Latias and Latios, allowing Heatran to use Dragon Pulse instead of Toxic. Be wary when facing opposing Heatran, as they may carry Earth Power. Since these more offensive Heatran tend to lack anti-stall techniques, the aforementioned Blissey and Latias will often take care of them.</p> "

  "Giratina-Origin": {
    "overview": "<p>Whereas Giratina is a wall that never dies, Giratina-O is an attacker that can puncture many holes in the opponent's team. He is arguably the best spinblocker in the game too, as his Levitate ability allows Giratina-O to switch in without being scathed by Spikes and Toxic Spikes. The addition of Shadow Sneak in Heart Gold and Soul Silver allows Giratina-O to also check many dangerous Ubers threats. His ability to break down stall teams with the Calm Mind set is a feat that very few other Pokemon can achieve. Immunity to Trick and the item removing effect of Knock Off is also quite exclusive and can prove to be very useful.</p> <p>However, he does have some pretty disturbing weaknesses; Giratina-O only has base 90 Speed, which is quite slow for Ubers standards. He has weaknesses to the most common types in the Ubers metagame. And finally, his most fundamental flaw is his inability to hold anything else besides Griseous Orb, which is what Giratina-O is most often criticized for. The inability to hold any other items ruins what would otherwise be a Pokemon with amazing potential.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder Wave can be a good option on some Giratina-O sets, as it can ruin many common Giratina-O switch-ins, such as Kyogre, Latias, and the many Pokemon who might come in expecting Giratina-O to set up (such as Rayquaza and Darkrai). Giratina-O also enjoys paralysis support as it is rather slow. Will-O-Wisp can be used to weaken physical attackers, such as Groudon and Metagross, allowing Giratina-O to set up on them, but it will cost him the moveslot for a secondary attack. Energy Ball is Giratina-O's most reliable move against Groudon, but it does not have much use otherwise. Icy Wind is an interesting option to slow down Giratina-O's switch-ins. There's also the option of running 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe Timid with an all-out Calm Mind + 3 attacks set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Giratina-O is tough to counter directly, considering his huge offensive movepool. The mixed attacker will generally have trouble hurting Heatran and Lugia, while specially defensive Scizor in the rain can take Hidden Power Fire reasonably well and slowly chip down Giratina-O's health with Bullet Punch; he can also Roost off any damage taken.</p> <p>Latias can stop the special attacker set only if Stealth Rock is not up. While rare, Calm Mind or Psych Up Blissey can stop Giratina-O by breaking its Substitutes with Ice Beam, eventually defeating him outright. If Giratina-O lacks Aura Sphere, Tyranitar can easily take on Dragon Pulse and quickly destroy him with Crunch, Payback, or Pursuit Giratina-O if he tries to flee. Without Thunder, Kyogre can Calm Mind alongside Giratina-O or Roar it away. Choice Specs Dialga with investment in bulk can take a one Calm Mind-boosted Aura Sphere and OHKO back with Draco Meteor. If Dragon Pulse is absent, Rayquaza and Palkia can survive Shadow Ball and proceed to KO Giratina-O with their STAB Dragon-type moves.</p> <p>The physical sets are countered by Skarmory, Scizor, and Forretress. Skarmory and Scizor can both Roost off any damage done to them, while Forretress can set up entry hazards and use Payback to hurt Giratina-O. Lugia can also switch in on any attack apart from Shadow Force's execution turn and set up Reflect; he can then Roost off any damage and Whirlwind Giratina-O away or hit him with a Toxic or Thunder Wave, cutting short his sweep.</p> <p>A good rule of thumb is to take advantage of Giratina-O's low Speed and lack of recovery. Even relatively weak attacks like Forretress's Payback can place Giratina-O into KO range of stronger moves like Palkia's Spacial Rend.</p> ",

        "name": "Stallbreaker",
        "description": "<p>Giratina-O is a fantastic special sweeper and sports some valuable qualities that other special sweepers can only wish for. He has a great Special Attack stat, complemented by Calm Mind and a myriad of special attacks at his disposal. Being part Dragon-type gives Giratina-O an amazing STAB. His Ghost typing grants him immunity to Seismic Toss, shutting down Blissey's main method of damage, while any attempt to hurt Giratina-O with status is rendered useless by Substitute. Giratina-O's bulk is no laughing matter either, especially when they are coupled with Levitate, which makes him immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. To top it all off, Giratina-O has the ever elusive immunity to the item-removing effects of Trick and Knock Off.</p> <p>Dragon Pulse is a good option in general and is only resisted by Steel-types not named Dialga. Giratina-O can use Dragon Pulse to OHKO Rayquaza and Palkia and 2HKO Groudon without even using Calm Mind. Shadow Ball is a powerful STAB move that provides an easy KO on Mewtwo and deals more damage to other Psychic-types than Dragon Pulse, which includes Metagross and Lugia. Thunder inflicts massive damage to Kyogre while possibly causing paralysis, which aids Giratina-O in his sweep. After one use of Calm Mind, Giratina-O has an excellent chance of OHKOing 4 HP / 0 SpD Kyogre with Thunder after Stealth Rock damage. Substitute is a great defense against status, shutting down standard Blissey in the Ubers metagame while simultaneously aiding prediction. Be careful though, as Giratina-O has no recovery, so his ability to throw out Substitutes is very limited, so make each Substitute count. Aura Sphere allows Giratina-O to severely damage Dialga, Blissey, and most importantly, always 2HKO Tyranitar. If one does not care about Blissey, Calm Mind and 3 attacks can be used for maximum coverage. Finally, there's the option to drop Dragon Pulse in favor of the unresisted combination of Aura Sphere and Shadow Ball; while Giratina-O loses super effective coverage against Dragon-types and some power against Kyogre and Latias, he is compensated by super effective coverage on Psychic-types as well as Tyranitar and Dialga.</p> <p>112 Speed EVs allow Giratina-O to outrun Jolly Tyranitar and most Kyogre and Groudon while outspeeding Jirachi who do not invest in Speed, which means that Giratina-O can set up a Substitute before Jirachi gets to Toxic or paralyze him. The defensive EVs give him guaranteed survival against a Spacial Rend from Timid Palkia after Stealth Rock damage and Dragon Claw from Groudon without Stealth Rock. The rest of the EVs go into Special Attack to allow Giratina-O to hit as hard as possible.</p> <p>Giratina-O is an excellent choice on offensive teams that require a way to beat stall. Recall that a classic Ubers stall team often consists of Groudon, Forretress, Blissey, Latias, Giratina, and a filler (often Lugia). Giratina-O can switch in on Blissey without much of a problem and threaten devastation. The only Pokemon who can prevent this devastation from occurring is Latias, and in order to do so, she must sacrifice herself to deal massive damage to Giratina-O, ensuring that he is unusable afterwards. The loss of Latias enables Pokemon like Calm Mind Kyogre to demolish the remaining team members. Giratina-O's main attraction here is that he can threaten a sweep against stall teams unless he is stopped promptly, and the Pokemon who do try to stop him often fall shortly afterwards, opening up a potential sweep for another member of your team.</p> <p>An important thing to note when using Giratina-O is that, despite his many resistances and excellent HP and defensive stats, Giratina-O has no form of recovery in this set, and therefore it is not recommended to switch Giratina-O into powerful attacks. Instead, it is best to switch Giratina-O into moves that he is immune to. Wobbuffet can use his combination of Encore and Shadow Tag to force opponents to repeat support moves, such as Toxic and Stealth Rock, or moves that Giratina-O is immune to, such as Earthquake. Wobbuffet can then use Safeguard if he has Encored a status move, and provide a free switch in for Giratina-O.</p> <p>Offensive partners that are good teammates for this set are Pokemon who can set up entry hazards or those who can take advantage of Giratina-O's ability to weaken his switch-ins. Deoxys-S is a great entry hazard user that can get Stealth Rock and Spikes up early on in the game, while Forretress can set up all three types of entry hazards. Giratina-O can then switch in on predicted Rapid Spins, keeping the offensive momentum on your side and proceed to set up with Calm Mind. If Giratina-O has used Calm Mind once, he can severely weaken or KO most Dialga, Kyogre (with Thunder), and Tyranitar (with Aura Sphere). Weakening a Choice Scarf Dialga would mean that Swords Dance Rayquaza or Lucario can sweep an opponent's team unchecked. The removal of Kyogre would allow Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Lugia to set up much more easily, while any team based around Groudon's Drought ability would also appreciate Kyogre's retirement. Ho-Oh in particular will be much harder to stop after Kyogre is eliminated. With Tyranitar severely weakened or KOed, stopping Calm Mind Mewtwo or Calm Mind Latias or Latios will be much more difficult for the opponent.</p> <p>Tyranitar is Giratina-O's arch enemy, especially if Giratina-O lacks Aura Sphere. The combination of Tyranitar's powerful STAB Dark attacks and the sandstorm he summons will dramatically cut Giratina-O's life short. Groudon and Garchomp can switch into Tyranitar with ease and threaten him with STAB Earthquake. Groudon also changes the weather, meaning that Giratina-O will not have to face the damaging effects of Tyranitar's sandstorm. Lucario can freely switch into Dark-type attacks and threaten Tyranitar with Close Combat. Forretress is another threat as it can use Payback and Light Screen to defeat Giratina-O one on one. Lucario, Groudon, and Dialga can easily switch into Forretress and set up for a sweep. If one does not want to sacrifice Giratina-O to take down Latias, then Scizor and Metagross are good teammates to use alongside Giratina-O. Both can cripple Latias with Pursuit if she decides to switch out or KO her with the appropriate STAB move should she stay in. Blissey is also a reliable switch-in for most Latias.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This set combines the stat-boosting threat of the Substitute + Calm Mind set with a form of recovery to take advantage of Giratina-O's bulk. At the expense of Substitute and an extra attacking move, Giratina-O gains virtual immunity to status and more freedom to switch into attacks. At first glance, it would seem that Giratina is better suited to this set due to its better bulk and access to Leftovers. However, Giratina-O does possess a fair number of advantages over Giratina. While Giratina-O may not find as much room to set up as Giratina, his higher Special Attack stat and the boost from Griseous Orb more than makes up for it. For example, Giratina needs 3 Calm Minds to match the power of a Giratina-O that has used Calm Mind once.</p> <p>Unlike Giratina, as well as many other sleep absorbers in the game, Giratina-O packs a unique immunity to Trick. In the later stages of the game, this immunity helps prevent Trick users from shutting down Giratina-O's setup process. Finally, Giratina-O has the useful ability Levitate, allowing him to avoid the Spikes and Toxic Spikes that trouble Giratina. Although Giratina can Rest off the damage or status caused by these entry hazards, doing so takes up valuable turns, which can be better spent setting up Calm Minds. Having an immunity to Earthquake never hurts either.</p> <p>The EVs give Giratina-O a balanced amount of defenses, while holding enough power to take down standard Latias with a Calm Mind boosted Dragon Pulse. The Defense EVs ensure that Payback from Forretress does not 3HKO, allowing Giratina-O to set up Calm Mind against him and Rest off the damage. A Life Orb Dragon Claw from Jolly Rayquaza will never OHKO this Giratina-O, even after Stealth Rock damage, while the Adamant variant cannot OHKO without Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>On the classic Ubers stall team, the only Pokemon who will outspeed Giratina-O, after Latias is gone, is Lugia. This can be a problem, because if Stealth Rock is in play, Giratina-O will faint on the second switch in. To properly remedy this, be sure to include a Wobbuffet with Tickle and a Scizor with Pursuit on your team. Wobbuffet can Encore and then Tickle Lugia 5 times to get him into the KO range of Scizor's Pursuit as he flees. With Lugia gone, and once Giratina-O defeats Latias, he will often be able to restore his health with Rest before the opposition attacks, letting him continue his sweep in peace. Wobbuffet can also Encore moves such as Earthquake or status moves, this can provide Giratina-O with free time to either Rest to recover or Calm Mind to set up.</p> <p>Tyranitar will give Giratina-O some serious issues, as he is able to 2HKO with Crunch, bypassing Giratina-O's possible Calm Mind boosts. A Jolly Tyranitar can also use Taunt to prevent Giratina-O from using Sleep Talk, and then set up a sweep with Dragon Dance. A Calm Mind Lugia that has Whirlwind can also set up on Giratina-O and Whirlwind Giratina-O away. When Giratina-O is sleeping, Mewtwo can switch in and Taunt Giratina-O as he attempts to Sleep Talk; Mewtwo can then easily set up Calm Mind, as Giratina-O is now virtually helpless. A Mewtwo of your own can easily set up on opposing Calm Mind Lugia with Taunt and Calm Mind. Opposing Mewtwo that carry Taunt and Calm Mind can be taken care of by Scizor or Metagross, who can both Pursuit him as he runs or OHKO him with the appropriate STAB moves should he stay in. Finally, Tyranitar is best handled by Garchomp or Groudon. Thunder Wave Groudon is a particularly useful Pokemon to use with this Giratina-O because it's in your interest to paralyze fast threats, particularly Lugia and Mewtwo. This will allow Giratina-O to enter the battle during late-game and use Rest before they land the finishing blow.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<p>While the special sweeper set may be very appealing, one cannot forget that Giratina-O's Attack stat is equivalent to his Special Attack. He is a force to be reckoned with, hitting most Pokemon in Ubers in their softer physical defenses. With access to a STAB 120 Base Power Outrage, which is boosted further by Griseous Orb, he is not to be taken lightly. However, being locked into Outrage can be displeasing, as Giratina-O has mediocre Speed and is weak to Dragon-type attacks, making him very susceptible to the rampant Draco Meteors of Ubers. This can often be remedied by setting up Substitute before attacking to minimize punishment during the turns in which Giratina-O is locked into Outrage. Substitute also protects Giratina-O in case your opponent switches to a counter during Shadow Force's charge turn. Earthquake pairs up with Outrage pretty well as it takes care of Steel-types. The choice between Shadow Force and Shadow Claw is very much up to the user. They both serve as Giratina-O's secondary STAB and are helpful in the disposing of Psychic-types. Shadow Claw is the choice for reliability, while Shadow Force is the choice for sheer power. Shadow Claw can still KO some key targets though, despite its lower Base Power. For example, Mewtwo without physical defense investment and Latias will always be OHKOed by Shadow Claw after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>The EV spread used allows Giratina-O to outspeed Jolly Tyranitar, while having enough bulk to survive a Timid Palkia's Spacial Rend after Stealth Rock. The rest are placed in Attack so Giratina-O hits as hard as possible.</p> <p>Many people view Shadow Force as terrible due to the fact that it's a charge up move. Shadow Force isn't necessarily a great move, but it's certainly quite underrated, and it packs quite a punch. The only Normal-type Pokemon commonly seen in Ubers is Blissey, who fears Outrage and thus would never switch into physical Giratina-O. Even if Blissey switches in after seeing Giratina-O using Shadow Force, she is unable to do anything to Giratina-O anyway, which allows him to set up a free Substitute. Once the opponent's Normal-type is gone, Shadow Force can deal massive damage to even Pokemon that resist it, like Darkrai. Shadow Force also OHKOes physically defensive Mewtwo, something that Shadow Claw cannot achieve. One possible good moment to use Shadow Force is when Giratina-O's weakened opponent can be KOed by it, but not by Earthquake, while Outrage is very risky to use due to its locking side-effect. A good way to use this set is to almost always use Substitute as the opponent switches out. This is because some players may suspect that Giratina-O is using a Calm Mind set, and may send in Giratina-O's usual counters, such as Tyranitar, Kyogre, Dialga, or Latias. Giratina can then 2HKO Kyogre with Outrage, 2HKO Tyranitar and Dialga with Earthquake, and can either OHKO Latias with Outrage or with Shadow Claw after Stealth Rock. Pokemon like Calm Mind Kyogre greatly appreciate the removal of Latias, while other Calm Mind users, such as Latias and Mewtwo, appreciate the removal of Tyranitar. The removal of Dialga can open up a Swords Dance Rayquaza or Lucario sweep.</p> <p>Physical Giratina-O is walled by four main Pokemon: Forretress, Scizor, Skarmory, and Lugia. Forretress, Scizor, and Skarmory resist both of Giratina-O's STAB attacks and take little to no damage from Earthquake. While Lugia takes a heavy amount of damage from Shadow Force, he is faster than Giratina-O, and can therefore cushion the hit with Reflect and Roost. Because of this, a Support Groudon with Fire Punch and Toxic pairs well with Giratina-O. Fire Punch will easily OHKO Forretress and Scizor, while Skarmory is 2HKOed. Groudon will often lure in Lugia, who can be crippled by Toxic. Although Magnezone does not fit on many Uber teams, he can be useful for trapping and killing Forretress, Scizor, and Skarmory. Dialga can also easily switch into the aforementioned Steel-types and threaten to roast them with Fire Blast; Dialga, like Groudon, can also use Toxic to cripple Lugia. Finally, Wobbuffet can use Encore and Tickle on Lugia, switch to Scizor, who can then OHKO Lugia with Pursuit if he attempts to switch. Something to note is that, although Kyogre is not the safest switch into Scizor, Choice Specs Kyogre can work well with physical Giratina-O because he can OHKO all four of the problem Pokemon with his STAB Water-type attacks and Thunder.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "RestTalk",
        "description": "<p>Giratina-O can run a physical RestTalk set fairly effectively too, eliminating any worries about status and residual damage. The combination of Rest and Sleep Talk means that Lugia would be unable to do anything to him apart from setting up Reflect or Whirlwinding him away. Outrage is Giratina-O's weapon of choice, because it is very devastating to most Ubers, as previously mentioned in the physical attacker set. When picked by Sleep Talk, Outrage loses its locking side-effect, and essentially becomes a 120 Base Power STAB move with no drawbacks. This is extremely helpful for Giratina-O, because most of the other sets are easily revenge killed when he's locked into Outrage. Shadow Force is the preferred option out of the three moves listed on the second attack slot, as it cannot be picked with Sleep Talk, giving Giratina-O a higher chance of firing off a very deadly Outrage. This is a win-win situation, as when Giratina-O is awake, he has two powerful offensive moves to choose from, and when he is asleep, he has a high chance of picking consequence-free Outrage with Sleep Talk. If one were to find Shadow Force distasteful, you can choose either Shadow Claw or Earthquake as a replacement. While both of these moves interfere with Sleep Talk's chances of picking Outrage, they are more reliable than Shadow Force when Giratina-O is awake. Earthquake gives coverage against Steel-types, while Shadow Claw decimates Psychic-types.</p> <p>Again, the EVs used allow Giratina-O to survive a Timid Palkia's Spacial Rend while outspeeding Jolly Tyranitar. If you don't mind the loss of Speed, a spread of 200 HP / 44 Def / 224 Atk / 40 SpD can be used so Forretress never 3HKOes with Payback, while also allowing Giratina-O to take some abuse on the special side.</p> <p>Much like the Physical Attacker set, Giratina-O will struggle against Forretress, Skarmory, and Scizor. A Groudon with Overheat can be helpful here, as he can lure in Skarmory and OHKO it outright. Groudon can also take any of Scizor's attacks, and hit back with either Fire Punch or Overheat. A Choice Specs Kyogre can also switch in while Scizor uses Bullet Punch, or while Skarmory and Forretress use anything else, and OHKO them all with Surf or Water Spout. A support Dialga can also be helpful for similar purposes, being able to roast all three Steel-types with Fire Blast, while also being able to set up Stealth Rock.</p> "

  "Cresselia": {
    "overview": "<p>Cresselia is a physical tank who excels at preventing physical threats, most prominently Groudon, Rayquaza, and Garchomp, from annihilating one's team. While one would normally consider Lugia for such a role, Cresselia lacks a Rock-type weakness, meaning she takes less damage from Stealth Rock and Stone Edge, while sporting roughly the same physical durability. Due to the lack of Stealth Rock weakness, she can reliably defeat Dragon Dance Rayquaza, unlike Lugia, making her the ultimate physical wall. Cresselia also makes a great dual screener with only three weaknesses, titanic defenses, a passable Speed stat--with a Timid nature, she is capable of outrunning the many base 90 Speed Ubers that do not run a Speed-boosting nature--and perhaps most importantly, Lunar Dance, which enables a sweeper to come back into play at full health.</p> <p>However, Lugia often overshadows Cresselia, due to her limited movepool, overall inferior stats, and the need for sunlight support in order to have reliable recovery in the form of Moonlight (with less PP too). As a dual screen user, she also faces significant competition, though Lunar Dance makes her unique in her role. Nevertheless, these are only limiting factors. Cresselia's movepool is more than enough to adequately support her teammates, her stats enable her to carry out her purpose, and Groudon's constant presence on the battlefield makes Moonlight more reliable in Ubers than in the sandstorm-dominated OU metagame.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rest can be used in place of Moonlight, but it requires cleric support. Sleep Talk provides reliable recovery alongside Rest, but Cresselia needs to immediately Ice Beam Rayquaza to reliably counter it, as Rayquaza threatens to 2HKO, and Sleep Talk will only select Ice Beam 1/3 of the time. While Rest and Sleep Talk make Cresselia effective at PP stalling, they make Cresselia even greater setup bait, and almost anything with a setup move will beat Cresselia one-on-one.</p> <p>Light Screen is an option on the Ubers Wall for extra team support. Grass Knot hits most Ubers harder than Ice Beam, in particular Groudon, Kyogre, and Tyranitar. However, Cresselia will still deal very little damage with her pathetic base 75 Special Attack, and she still cannot stand up to Kyogre and Tyranitar. Cresselia's Special Attack also makes Calm Mind a poor option, as it takes many Calm Minds for Cresselia to actually dent the opposing Pokemon. Even +6 Cresselia is easily walled by Blissey, Kyogre, or Latias, while they can also set up alongside her with Calm Mind and beat Cresselia one-on-one after PP stalling Moonlight. Also, Lugia generally makes better use of Calm Mind, thanks to its higher Base Stat Total.</p> <p>Cresselia also gains access to Trick Room and Gravity. When using Trick Room, use a -Speed nature and 0 IVs to ensure you are slower than neutral nature Tyranitar. Keep in mind that under Gravity, Cresselia cannot counter Swords Dance Groudon, as she can be hit by Groudon's Earthquake, and it will deal too much damage with a Swords Dance boost.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Kyogre turns the weather into rain, reducing Moonlight's recovery to a pathetic 25%, and threatens Cresselia with its STAB-boosted Water-type attacks. Tyranitar also removes the sunlight and severely dents Cresselia with STAB Crunch or Pursuit. Scizor, Heracross, and Weavile can also hit Cresselia hard with their STAB attacks while only fearing Hidden Power Fire (and Thunder Wave in Weavile's case). Blissey with Toxic also has no problems against Cresselia without Rest. However, Cresselia can easily set up dual screens and wrap up with Lunar Dance against Blissey. Forretress will easily set up on Cresselia that lack Hidden Power Fire, which will not matter if rain is up; however, Forretress itself is set up on by dual screen Cresselia. Wobbuffet shrugs off Ice Beam and can trap Cresselia with Shadow Tag, Encore any attack, and use Tickle until Cresselia loses enough Defense to be OHKOed by an opposing Pursuit user. Lunar Dance Cresselia can, however, escape from Wobbuffet by sacrificing herself. Cresselia can also carry Shed Shell to escape Wobbuffet's grasp.</p> <p>Anything with Taunt will beat Cresselia, as her pathetic base 75 Special Attack means she cannot hit hard unless she hits for 4x super effective damage. Of the most common Taunt users in Ubers, which are Mewtwo, Mew, Heatran, and all Deoxys formes, all but Heatran easily use Cresselia as setup bait as long as they avoid Toxic and Thunder Wave on the switch. The same applies for Substitute users whose Substitutes can withstand an Ice Beam such as, once again, Mewtwo and Darkrai. However, Substitute does not stop Cresselia from setting up dual screens and using Lunar Dance.</p> <p>It's also important to note that while Cresselia handles physical variants of Rayquaza well, Mixed Rayquaza will often 2HKO her with the combination of Draco Meteor and Outrage after Stealth Rock damage, which makes it a great Cresselia lure.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>While Cresselia is often compared to Lugia in terms of physical walling, she lacks the weaknesses associated with the Flying-type. She doesn't fear Stone Edge and Stealth Rock, and cannot shed her Ground-immunity with Roost. Hence, she can more reliably counter Groudon, Rayquaza, and Garchomp, the three main physical powerhouses in Ubers, and take less damage from the ever-common Ice Beam and Thunder. Even +4 Life Orb Groudon's Stone Edge will never OHKO Cresselia. Also, in the sun, Moonlight heals 66.7% of her HP, which is more efficient than Lugia's Roost.</p> <p>Ice Beam is needed to counter Rayquaza, Groudon, and Garchomp. It OHKOes Rayquaza after Stealth Rock Damage and Life Orb recoil, and nets a 2HKO on Garchomp. Reflect halves the power of physical attacks, and is especially helpful against enemy Pursuit users or if rain is on the field, severely reducing Moonlight's effectiveness. Toxic is recommended for the last slot; Ice Beam does little damage to any Pokemon without a 4x Ice weakness. Furthermore, it deals more damage over time to Groudon than a single Ice Beam. Thunder Wave can hit incoming sweepers on the switch, and the two most common Pokemon in Ubers who are immune to Thunder Wave, Groudon and Garchomp, will never switch into Cresselia. Hidden Power Fire prevents Forretress from using Cresselia as set up bait and Scizor from using U-turn. Hidden Power Fire is also Cresselia's most powerful attack in the sunlight, 2HKOing 252 / 252+ Forretress. Unfortunately, in the rain, it won't even 4HKO thanks to Leftovers recovery.</p> <p>The HP and Defense EVs maximize Cresselia's bulk. Cresselia can easily survive a +1 Adamant Rayquaza's Outrage after Stealth Rock damage. Cresselia will even survive a +2 Jolly Rayquaza's Outrage 87% of the time when factoring in Stealth Rock and one turn of Leftovers recovery. If she switches directly into the Outrage--meaning no Leftovers recovery--she has a 50% chance to survive%. Leftovers is the preferred item choice for the HP recovery, reducing the number of times Cresselia will have to resort to using Moonlight's precious PP. However, Shed Shell enables Cresselia to switch out of Wobbuffet.</p> <p>Cresselia is offensively inept with her pathetic base 75 Special Attack. As such, she should only be used on stall teams; she is dead-weight on any offensive team. Cresselia should always be used alongside Groudon, setting up the sun so Moonlight will heal 66.7% of Cresselia's HP, and removing rain when necessary. Blissey as a teammate can absorb special assaults directed at Cresselia, who in return can take physical attacks aimed at Blissey, forming a pseudo SkarmBliss combo. Blissey can also provide Aromatherapy support to rid Cresselia of poison or a burn, or use Wish to heal Cresselia should there be rain on the field. In return, Blissey will more than appreciate the support provided by Reflect. An allied Latias acts similarly to Blissey. However, Latias shares all three of Cresselia's weaknesses. When using these two together, one of them should use Hidden Power Fire to deal with Scizor. Cresselia hates Toxic, so an ally who is either immune to Toxic, such as Dialga, Forretress, or Scizor, or can take advantage of it, namely Heracross, is recommended.</p> <p>Kyogre is Cresselia's main nemesis. Cresselia cannot dent it without status, while its ability, Drizzle, reduces Moonlight's recovery to only 25%. Timid Kyogre can 2HKO with Surf after Stealth Rock damage over 97% of the time, and Choice Specs Kyogre can OHKO Cresselia with Water Spout. Kyogre can also use Cresselia as setup bait with Calm Mind. Latias can handle all Kyogre sets, and can set up Calm Mind alongside Kyogre. Tyranitar can also reduce Moonlight's recovery and severely dent Cresselia with Crunch or Pursuit. Fortunately, Groudon handles Tyranitar. Darkrai can block any status attempts with Substitute or Taunt, set up Nasty Plot, and remove Cresselia with Dark Pulse. Heracross and Primeape counter Darkrai without fearing Dark Void, but should Sleep Clause be activated, Scizor, along with revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Palkia and Dialga, can check Darkrai too.</p> <p>Without Hidden Power Fire, Scizor and Forretress can comfortably switch into Cresselia and U-turn or set up entry hazards respectively. Ho-Oh, Dialga, and Groudon can roast them with Sacred Fire, Fire Blast, and Fire Punch respectively, while taking little damage from U-turn. If Cresselia lacks a Shed Shell, Wobbuffet can easily switch in, trap Cresselia with its ability, Shadow Tag, and use the Encore + Tickle combination to lower Cresselia's Defense to the point that an opposing Pursuit user, such as Tyranitar and Scizor, can easily OHKO Cresselia. Alternatively, Wobbuffet can enable a powerful sweeper to switch in for free. Unfortunately, Cresselia cannot switch out of Wobbuffet due to Shadow Tag. As most Pursuit users are Choiced, an allied Scizor or Dialga can come in after Cresselia is fainted, and in Scizor's case, use U-turn to scout the opponent's switch-in (Dialga has a myriad of options available to it, such as Fire Blast and Bulk Up). Scizor also deals heavy damage to Wobbuffet with U-turn, but it won't OHKO. However, if a Ghost-type switches in after U-turn, Wobbuffet's Counter fails, and the switch-in takes no damage.</p> "

        "name": "Dual Screens",
        "description": "<p>Switch Cresselia in on a Pokemon who can do little to harm Cresselia, such as Blissey, Lugia, Giratina, Groudon, or even Forretress if you do not mind your opponent setting up entry hazards, then proceed to set up dual screens. Late-game, use Lunar Dance to fully heal one of your sweepers, under the protection of dual screens. The last move is up to user preference. Thunder Wave provides extra team support, paralyzing Pokemon to support a late game sweep. Additionally, by paralyzing faster opponents, Cresselia can set up a screen before they attack her. Moonlight can keep Cresselia healthy and is useful if you want to set up dual screens more than once. Ice Beam enables Cresselia to check Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Groudon without Toxic. Even with no Defense EVs, Cresselia makes a comfortable counter to Swords Dance Rayquaza, outspeeding Adamant Rayquaza and always surviving +2 Jolly Life Orb Dragon Claw after Stealth Rock damage. However, keep in mind that +1 Jolly Rayquaza's Outrage is likely to OHKO Cresselia after Stealth Rock damage, so Cresselia is not a reliable Dragon Dance Rayquaza counter. One should not use Ice Beam for the sole purpose of not Struggling when Taunted, because all the common Taunt users have nothing to fear from Cresselia's Ice Beam and can easily use a Taunted Cresselia as setup bait.</p> <p>The Speed EVs enable Cresselia to outrun Adamant Rayquaza and the many base 90 Speed Ubers without a +Speed nature, so she can set up a screen before being attacked, enabling her to easily set up dual screens against Groudon, Dialga, Ho-Oh, and Rayquaza. Against these foes, you should only switch Cresselia in on them after a KO, so that you are not attacked without a screen. One can also elect to give Cresselia a Bold or Calm nature, and put all the Speed EVs into Defense and Special Defense respectively, to better protect Cresselia from one side. This is helpful for setting up against Pokemon who are always faster than Cresselia, such as Choice Scarf Dialga and Garchomp.</p> <p>Cresselia will rarely be on the offensive, if at all. She should be paired alongside a late-game sweeper who benefits from dual screen support, such as Calm Mind Giratina-O, Mewtwo, or Rock Polish Groudon with Swords Dance. Giratina-O can also switch into Brick Break and attempt a sweep, but any screens will still be broken. Cresselia can be paired with Mew, as the dual screen protection can help Mew set up and pass the boosts to a late-game sweeper. Lunar Dance also enables Mew to Baton Pass boosts twice, as Mew often loses a lot of HP after Baton Passing the first time. You should have teammates who both lure out Pokemon who Cresselia can easily set up on and benefit from dual screens themselves, such as Groudon to lure out Lugia or Giratina. Scizor lures in Pokemon whom Cresselia can easily set up on, for example, Groudon, Giratina, Forretress, and Skarmory, and can also check many fast Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Darkrai and Shaymin-S, who can revenge kill your late-game sweepers.</p> <p>Few Pokemon can switch in on Cresselia and prevent her from setting up dual screens. Choice Specs Kyogre 2HKOes with Water Spout if Light Screen is up, while Choice Band Tyranitar 2HKOs with Crunch after Stealth Rock damage and one turn of sandstorm damage if Reflect is up unless Cresselia invests in Defense or Special Defense EVs. Palkia and Latias can switch in on Choice Specs Kyogre, while Groudon or Scizor can switch in on Tyranitar's Crunch or Pursuit. Scizor also comfortably handles Mewtwo, Mew, Darkrai, and Deoxys-S, the most common users of Taunt, who would otherwise completely shut down Cresselia. However, Scizor must avoid Fire Blast from Mewtwo and Darkrai's Nasty Plot boosted Focus Blast.</p> "

  "Tentacruel": {
    "overview": "<p>Tentacruel is a valuable lead in Ubers. It's able to set Toxic Spikes on nearly any lead, ensuring valuable chip damage on threats such as Groudon, Mewtwo, and Palkia. Its solid Speed tier enables it to outpace leads like Tyranitar and Giratina-O, and its high Special Defense lets it take attacks like Life Orb Rayquaza's Draco Meteor and Shaymin-S's Seed Flare. Lastly, it boasts effective hazard control. Its Poison typing enables it to remove Toxic Spikes upon entry to the field, and it can clear Spikes and Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin in some circumstances.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Tentacruel has little use outside of leading. Its poor Defense and weak defensive typing hamper its ability to check anything, while its Special Attack is too low to be an effective offensive presence. Additionally, it lacks the durability of Forretress as a Rapid Spin user, making it occasionally challenging to keep Tentacruel useful over long games. Another point against it as a Rapid Spin user is its susceptibility to Giratina-O, which consistently forces it out with the threat of coverage such as Earthquake, Outrage, and Thunder, while blocking its ability to use Rapid Spin with its Ghost typing.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Though generally inferior to Clear Body, Liquid Ooze can be used to wall the gimmicky Jumpluff. Tentacruel can attempt to run a specially defensive set with Black Sludge outside of the lead slot, but the only things this has over Forretress are its ability to clear the field of Toxic Spikes without needing to click Rapid Spin and its higher Speed tier. Knock Off could be used over Icy Wind or Ice Beam; this would forfeit Tentacruel's ability to harm threats like Giratina-O, but it could catch switch-ins like Latios by surprise. Running Toxic over Icy Wind or Ice Beam leaves Tentacruel with no way to damage Rayquaza, but the chip damage it would generate on Giratina-O could eventually facilitate a Rapid Spin in long games. Mimic could theoretically be run over Rapid Spin to enable Tentacruel to set Stealth Rock in addition to Toxic Spikes versus Tyranitar leads, but this would only work if opponent sets Stealth Rock instead of first clicking Payback.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Psycho Boost Deoxys-S and lead Mewtwo can use Taunt on Tentacruel and nearly OHKO even bulky variants. Only Focus Sash Tentacruel can stand up to Psycho Boost Deoxys-A, but even that matchup is effectively a losing battle. Mew will either Speed tie with or outpace Tentacruel and fire off a fast Taunt before U-turning to a Pokemon Tentacruel may not want to fight. Froslass can use Taunt on Tentacruel and set up a layer of Spikes on it, but its next teammate will be forced to contend with a fully healthy Tentacruel. Metagross can OHKO Lum Berry Tentacruel with Earthquake and pick off Focus Sash variants with a follow-up Bullet Punch, but it cannot stop Tentacruel from securing a layer of Toxic Spikes. Giratina-O and Rayquaza are in the same position, but Rayquaza must be mindful of Ice Beam. Forretress, Kabutops, and Cloyster can use Rapid Spin to clear Tentacruel's Toxic Spikes off the field, minimizing its contribution to a game. Qwilfish absorbs Tentacruel's Toxic Spikes yet is unable to do much of anything back to it besides potentially threatening Explosion. Opposing Tentacruel will stalemate one's own Tentacruel by rendering its Toxic Spikes useless and consistently threatening Rapid Spin.</p> ",

        "name": "Lead",
        "description": "<p>Toxic Spikes is invaluable in a tier with numerous grounded threats such as Kabutops, Garchomp, and Kyogre, and Tentacruel has the right combination of Speed, bulk, and resistances to be able to set entry hazards in nearly any game. Rapid Spin augments Tentacruel's usefulness as a lead, enabling it to ward off hazards from leads such as Deoxys-S, Tyranitar, and Cloyster. Icy Wind's Speed drops further increase Tentacruel's utility, decreasing its passivity versus ambitious setup sweepers and heftily damaging Rayquaza and Shaymin-S. Lastly, Hydro Pump is Tentacruel's strongest STAB move, threatening leads such as Forretress, Scizor, and Tyranitar. Tentacruel can opt for a Lum Berry to set Toxic Spikes on Darkrai's Dark Void, whereas a Focus Sash guarantees Toxic Spikes versus Deoxys-A leads and prevents Life Orb Rayquaza and Groudon's Earthquakes from OHKOing it.</p> <p>Tentacruel's Speed investment ensures that it outpaces all lead Rayquaza. 160 Special Attack EVs let Tentacruel 2HKO uninvested Tyranitar leads with Hydro Pump. 132 HP EVs make Forretress's Payback a 4HKO while also preventing Jolly lead Tyranitar from KOing Tentacruel with Payback and two rounds of sand damage. An alternate EV spread with 52 Def / 240 SpA / 216 Spe and Ice Beam over Icy Wind is viable. This lets Tentacruel 3HKO 0 HP / 0 SpD Giratina-O while also OHKOing Shaymin-S and Naive Rayquaza. The Defense investment gives Forretress's Payback only a 1.9% chance to 3HKO, while Jolly Tyranitar's Payback still won't KO after 2 rounds of sand damage. Generally, more defensive teams will appreciate the former spread, as Tentacruel can appreciate the longevity more HP provides and Icy Wind has defensive utility. Some offense teams will tend to benefit from the latter spread's ability to actively damage threats while having a more realistic shot of using Rapid Spin versus teams with Giratina-O, but it should be noted that Icy Wind tends to outclass Ice Beam; Speed drops are incredibly useful for building momentum and also helping to decrease Tentacruel's passivity in a different way. Lastly, Clear Body is chosen over Liquid Ooze because it prevents Froslass from lowering Tentacruel's Speed with Icy Wind.</p> <p>Good teammates for Tentacruel tend to take advantage of Toxic Spikes. Powerful offensive partners include Dialga, Palkia, Giratina-O, and Ho-Oh. They tend to frighten off Levitate users and Flying- and Steel-types, which are immune to Toxic Spikes, and lure in checks susceptible to them. Giratina-O in particular is able to block Rapid Spin, ensuring that Tentacruel's Toxic Spikes remain up for the whole game versus some teams. Ho-Oh also deserves a special mention, as Tentacruel's fast Rapid Spin can mitigate its 4x Stealth Rock weakness. Other Stealth Rock-weak offensive Pokemon that appreciate Rapid Spin include Rayquaza, Shaymin-S, and Salamence. On defensive teams, Lugia is a valuable partner; Toxic Spikes help it Pressure stall more effectively, and Rapid Spin can mitigate its Stealth Rock weakness. Other stall-oriented Pokemon that benefit from Toxic Spikes support include Stalltwo, Ludicolo, Heatran, Gliscor, and Giratina. Lastly, Pokemon that do not appreciate residual damage from Toxic Spikes make good Tentacruel teammates, given its ability to absorb them simply by switching in. These include Choice Specs Kyogre, Choice Scarf Palkia, and Rock Polish Groudon.</p> <p>Tentacruel's largest purpose is setting Toxic Spikes. Therefore, this should be the move clicked first in most scenarios. Whether Tentacruel sets one or two layers, however, depends on its user's prediction of the opponent's team and one's own team. If the opponent leads Rayquaza or Deoxys-S, for instance, one can assume the opponent's team is offense. Conversely, a more defensive team is to be expected when the opponent leads a Pokemon like Forretress or Scizor. Assuming one's own team is not especially passive, it makes sense to only set one layer of Toxic Spikes versus offensive teams; the opponent's Pokemon will not be in play long enough for Toxic damage to accumulate to any sizable amount. If one's own team lacks much of a way to directly damage the foe, however, it's more rational to set two layers of Toxic Spikes versus offensive teams. If the Tentacruel user is running a passive team and anticipates the same from their opponent, it's logical to strive for two layers of Toxic Spikes versus their lead, and also potentially keep Tentacruel healthy so it can absorb Toxic Spikes the opponent may set or clear away other entry hazards with Rapid Spin.</p> "

  "Magneton": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, it may seem like Magnezone, with its superior bulk, completely outclasses Magneton. However, this is not entirely the case. Magneton's base Speed is higher than Magnezone's by 10 points, which actually allows it to outrun Darkrai, Shaymin-S, and Jolly Choice Scarf Tyranitar when Magneton holds a Choice Scarf; this is actually a pretty huge advantage as it allows Magneton to revenge kill these Pokemon, while Magnezone will not be able to outspeed the aforementioned threats with a Choice Scarf. However, because of Magnezone's greater bulk, there is no point to employing Magneton for any other purpose in Ubers other than a Choice Scarf user, as Magnezone WILL use any other set much more effectively.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Magnezone, Magneton's bulky cousin, seems to outclass it in every way, but Magneton has one great advantage when it comes to using Choice Scarf: its higher base Speed. This allows Magneton to revenge kill Darkrai, Shaymin-S, and Jolly Tyranitar when it holds a Choice Scarf, all of whom Magnezone fails to outspeed.</p> <p>Thunder is the main attack Magneton will use, and it will cause massive damage to any Pokémon who does not resist it. Rain support will make Thunder even deadlier by boosting its accuracy to 100%, so having Kyogre on your team is recommended to ensure the rain will be on the field. Hidden Power Fire allows Magneton to fry Scizor, Forretress, and Lucario in the sunlight, but it's only a worthwhile option if Groudon and its infinite sunlight are also included in your team. Hidden Power Ice can be used instead if you do not have a need for Hidden Power Fire; with it, Magneton can be an effective revenge killer to Swords Dance Rayquaza and Garchomp. Magneton will outspeed and OHKO them both, and Rayquaza will never be able to OHKO Magneton with Extreme Speed after a Swords Dance and Life Orb boost. Flash Cannon scores a neutral hit on Latias while also allowing Magneton to hit Tyranitar for super effective damage. Thunderbolt can be used to give Magneton a reliable STAB option if conditions are not suitable for using Thunder (read: if rain is currently not present on the field). Flash Cannon is also a worthwhile option since it scores a neutral hit on Latias while also allowing Magneton to hit Tyranitar for super effective damage. Explosion is to be used when Magneton has reached the end of its usefulness. It causes huge damage to several notable targets, such as Blissey and Latias, although neither will be OHKOed without prior damage.</p> <p>Maximum Speed EVs are required to allow Magneton to outrun anything slower than Shaymin-S. A Hasty nature is preferred to allow Magneton to be more suited to take the predominant special attacks thrown about in Ubers play, but Naive can be used if one needs to take hits from Scizor, Lucario, Metagross, and physical Rayquaza more effectively.</p> <p>Any Pokémon who resists or can take Magneton's Electric-type attacks with little risk or harm to themselves presents a problem for the little steel magnet. Ground-types, such as Groudon and Garchomp (though non-Scarf Garchomp will need to fear Hidden Power Ice), and special walls, such as Blissey, Latias, and Tyranitar, fall into this category. Wobbuffet can also trap Magneton with Shadow Tag and KO it with Mirror Coat. Physically defensive Kyogre can take on Groudon, most Garchomp, and Tyranitar with ease, as all three fear Kyogre's powerful Surf. Kyogre can also beat Blissey with Calm Mind and Rest. A Pursuit user, such as Scizor or Metagross, easily traps and KOes Latias (as well as Blissey); make sure that you know whether or not they are carrying any Fire-type moves before you try and trap them, however. Wobbuffet can't really be countered in the traditional sense, but the blue blob cannot touch physical Giratina-O or special Darkrai since their types grant immunity to Counter and Mirror Coat, respectively.</p> <p>Since Magneton can easily trap and eliminate most Steel-types, such as Scizor, Lucario, Skarmory, Bronzong, and Forretress (although trapping Scizor and Bronzong can be risky since they like to carry moves to hit Magneton for super effective damage), powerful Dragon-type sweepers can easily seize this hole to ravage the opponent's team. Rayquaza, Salamence, Latias, Latios, and Giratina-O are all great choices, and all five of them resist all of Magneton's weaknesses, while Magneton resists all of their weaknesses in return, so they will find ample opportunities to set up and wreak utter devastation.</p> <p>Magneton is primarily used as a revenge killer, so entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock and/or Spikes will greatly help the steel magnet do its job. Groudon is a fine choice as it can set up Stealth Rock reliably while also countering Garchomp, Tyranitar, and Blissey extremely well. Forretress can use any entry hazards you want to, and it has the bonus of Rapid Spin to rid your side of the field of entry hazards, allowing Magneton to possibly switch in on its targets more easily. Forretress can also use Latias, Blissey, and most Tyranitar as set-up bait, all of whom are common Magneton counters. As always, Deoxys is a reliable suicide lead who can easily set up Stealth Rock and Spikes quickly and efficiently.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Always use maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs with a positive Speed nature. Magnezone will always outclass any bulky Magneton set, so don't even bother investing in Magneton's defenses. Magneton does not really have a whole lot of other viable options. Hidden Power Ground always OHKOes Heatran and enemy Magneton while also dealing massive damage to Dialga, if one has a need to hit those targets. All of its other viable options are done better by Magnezone.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Groudon is probably Magneton's best counter. It is immune to Thunder and does not take much from Magneton's other attacks, and OHKOes it with Earthquake. Groudon can also set up on a Choice-locked Electric-type attack from Magneton with Rock Polish. Garchomp can do the same, and like Groudon, is immune to Thunder and can use the time to set up a Swords Dance for a sweep. Both of them, however, need to be wary of Hidden Power Ice. Specially defensive Tyranitar can also destroy Magneton with Earthquake while only really fearing Flash Cannon. Blissey with Seismic Toss can handle anything except Explosion. Non-Choice Dialga variants equipped with Fire-type attacks can also lure in Magneton while laughing at any attack but Hidden Power Ground and destroy it. Opposing Magneton or Magnezone can also trap your Magneton and KO it if the enemy Magneton has Hidden Power Fire or Ground. Choice Scarf Heatran also makes Magneton shiver, as it can outspeed it and smash it with Fire Blast or Earth Power. Wobbuffet can ensnare Magneton with Shadow Tag, leaving it at the mercy of Mirror Coat.</p> <p>Anything faster than Magneton that carries a super effective attack against it or that can set up on it poses a good option to eliminating Magneton. The best choices for this are Mewtwo, Choice Scarf Palkia, and Choice Scarf Dialga, as none of them are weak to Magneton's Thunder and can all either OHKO it or set up on it (although Mewtwo and Palkia won't want to directly switch in).</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Kabutops gets a huge boost in the Ubers environment because of Kyogre. The infinite rain created by Drizzle instantly transforms this sub-par Pokemon into an offensive force, as once its mediocre Speed stat is cured (it's actually quite impressive with a Swift Swim boost), its great Attack stat can shine as well. Kabutops is one of those Pokemon whom you probably laugh at the first time you see, but then watch in utter horror as it easily bulldozes through your team once it has set up.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aqua Jet can be used to take out weakened Pokemon, however Kabutops will generally be outrunning your opponent anyway, because of Swift Swim. X-Scissor is also a possibility, but it would mainly be filler, since the coverage granted by Waterfall / Low Kick / Stone Edge is quite vast.</p> <p>Rapid Spin can be used on a Choice Band set in order to clear Stealth Rock, but Kabutops has much better things to do than be a support Pokemon. Furthermore, being locked into an extremely weak Normal-type move is just asking to be set up on in Ubers.</p> <p>The choice between Adamant and Jolly is up to whether you prefer speed or power. With Adamant, you still outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Garchomp, as well as maximizing your Attack, and thus it is probably the better choice. Jolly, on the other hand, allows you to outspeed Modest Choice Scarf Shaymin-S and Choice Scarf Gengar, but it does come at the cost of Attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Groudon is by and large the best Kabutops counter. It can come in on most of Kabutops's attacks, because of its excellent Defense stat. It also replaces the rain with the sun. This reduces Kabutops's Speed, bringing it back down to its mediocre base 80 stat. Also, it not only gets rid of the rain boost on Kabutops's Water-type STAB, but it also actually further cuts it down, leaving Waterfall a shell of its former self (meaning Groudon can even switch in on that, even if Kabutops has managed to get a Swords Dance boost).</p> <p>Rayquaza can come in on a resisted Waterfall or Low Kick, or after a KO, and cancel out the weather temporarily with its Air Lock. Then, it outspeeds Kabutops, and can proceed to destroy it with a Dragon-type move, or Earthquake. Scizor can use Bullet Punch to bypass Kabutops's boosted Speed stat, and hit it for lots of damage.</p> <p>If Kabutops does not have a Jolly nature, Choice Scarf Shaymin-S can come in and force Kabutops out with the threat of a STAB super effective Seed Flare.</p> <p>Finally, Giratina can give Kabutops problems, since it resists Waterfall and is immune to Low Kick. It can also threaten to burn Kabutops with Will-O-Wisp, making Kabutops utterly useless. Furthermore, any user of Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp can threaten to completely cripple Kabutops.</p> ",

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Kabutops is a perfect example of a Pokemon who can excel when it is granted access to a metagame with permanent weather. Kabutops's already decent base 115 Attack stat gets raised to tremendous heights when it is boosted by Life Orb and Swords Dance. Furthermore, Kyogre's Drizzle ability allows it to abuse the perpetual rain with its Swift Swim, doubling its Speed.</p> <p>Swords Dance is obvious on this set, as, coupled with Life Orb, it makes Kabutops's Attack soar; this makes it a true threat, even in the Ubers tier, which holds some of the toughest Pokemon. Waterfall is also quite obvious. It gains not only STAB, but also the boost from rain, bringing its Base Power up to 180. This can rip through many Pokemon, especially since it comes off Kabutops's boosted Attack stat. Waterfall is its main STAB and will probably be the move that you use the most (and for good reason). Low Kick is a great move for Kabutops; it gives great coverage alongside Waterfall. Most Pokemon in Ubers are quite heavy, which gives a great 120 Base Power on these targets. Furthermore, it allows Kabutops to beat many Pokemon who would normally give it trouble. For example, most versions of Dialga will be OHKOed by a Swords Dance-boosted Low Kick. Stone Edge rounds off the set nicely, giving you a secondary STAB move. It will probably be used only sparingly, because of the great coverage from Waterfall and Low Kick, but it certainly does have its uses. It allows you to hit Latias and Latios, who otherwise resist your moves. It also hits Lugia, Ho-Oh, and Rayquaza for massive damage (it gets 150 Base Power after STAB, before weaknesses are taken into account).</p> <p>The EVs for this set are quite straightforward. Maximizing Attack and Speed give Kabutops all the power and speed that it can get, so it can sweep as easily as possible (since it's not going to be taking many hits). The choice between Adamant and Jolly is a classic choice between speed and power. Adamant is recommended, as it gives you more attacking power, while still letting you outspeed Choice Scarf Garchomp when the rain is up. Jolly, however, is also viable, as it allows you to outspeed Choice Scarf Gengar and Shaymin-S, at the cost of a bit of Attack.</p> <p>Scizor is a threat for Kabutops, since its Bullet Punch bypasses Kabutops's boosted Speed stat. Kabutops is quite frail, so it will be doing a lot of damage to the shellfish (Kabutops does not resist Bullet Punch). A bulky Kyogre, such as the \"Boosting Tank\" version, can take Scizor's Bullet Punches with ease. It can then start boosting its Special Defense and Special Attack with Calm Mind, Resting off damage when necessary; from there it can attempt a sweep. Kyogre will also set up the rain, which is so incredibly necessary for Kabutops to sweep.</p> <p>As mentioned before, Kabutops is quite frail, so any assistance in getting it into play or helping it set up is greatly appreciated. Wobbuffet can be a great help. By using Encore, Shadow Tag, and Safeguard (in some cases), Wobbuffet can provide for an easy switch into play. To do this, you can simply Encore a move that does little to no damage to Kabutops, or a status move (once Safeguard is set up). Then, you can switch Kabutops in without fear, while it also gains a turn to use Swords Dance while your opponent switches Pokemon. Although it is not necessary, Wobbuffet support is highly recommended. Kabutops's 60 / 105 / 70 defenses are really quite dismal (albeit its Defense isn't too bad), especially in Ubers, where Pokemon hit harder and generally from the special side.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Although Kabutops is holding a Choice Band, this set generally functions best as a revenge killer. Kabutops's Speed stat is boosted to epic proportions via Swift Swim, since Kyogre is the most-used Uber Pokemon. Furthermore, Kabutops's Attack is boosted right off the bat by its Choice Band, meaning that it can do some serious damage without the need for using Swords Dance.</p> <p>Like the Swords Dance set, Waterfall will generally be your move of choice. Waterfall receives two 1.5x boosts from STAB and the rain, as well as the Attack boost from the Choice Band, making it a truly potent threat. Low Kick and Stone Edge provide excellent coverage with Waterfall. The former has high Base Power due to how heavy most Pokemon are in Ubers, as well as doing huge damage to Dialga, who can normally walk all over Kabutops; the latter gains STAB boost and is generally your best bet against Lugia, Rayquaza switch-ins (don't stay in against Rayquaza because of Air Lock), and Ho-Oh. The fourth slot is mainly filler, since the other three moves hit most if not all Ubers for at least neutral damage. X-Scissor hits Latias and Latios for super effective damage, as well as being more reliable than Stone Edge, accuracy wise. Aqua Jet is an option to pick off weakened Pokemon, but, generally speaking, you'll be faster than your opponent thanks to Swift Swim.</p> <p>Since you are not boosting your Attack quite as much, sturdy physical walls can wall this Kabutops quite easily. Giratina in particular can present a problem, as it resists your main form of attack, Waterfall, and it has no weaknesses to your other moves, meaning that it can status Kabutops with Will-O-Wisp while Resting off the damage that Kabutops does. Special attackers can power through Giratina, as the mighty Dragon-type normally invests in Defense. Of note are Dialga or Palkia who can wallop it with a STAB super effective Draco Meteor.</p> "

  "Mewtwo": {
    "overview": "<p>Mewtwo, also known as the classic \"God\" of Pokemon, is certainly no slouch. Its offensive stats and huge Speed coupled with its amazing offensive movepool, giving coverage on pretty much any Pokemon, are hard to compare with other Pokemon. Mewtwo might have to share its throne with Kyogre, Darkrai, and other powerful threats; however, Mewtwo has a lot going for it with its \"perfectly placed\" stats and vast movepool. One of Mewtwo's most fearsome qualities is its amazing versatility. It can function well as a sweeper, a wall to many threats in the Ubers metagame with its underestimated bulk and plethora of defensive moves, or a supporter, so one must be extremely careful of Mewtwo's sheer unpredictability. In fact, Mewtwo's many skills make it pretty much uncounterable. Mewtwo's only bad qualities are its bad STAB and lack of resistances that a lot of other Uber Pokemon can boast, but these are very minor faults. \"Fear\" is the one thing you should think about when facing a Mewtwo, as it is one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the game.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Grass Knot is acceptable on many of the sets listed here, able to hit both Groudon and Kyogre for super effective damage without being reliant on the weather, but with so many Pokemon in Ubers resisting it, it isn't the best option. Psychic is a STAB option, but has the same problems as Grass Knot has: too many Pokemon resist it, or, in Psychic's case, are immune to it. Bulk Up Mewtwo can allow Mewtwo to surprise opponents with its underrated base 110 Attack Stat. Mewtwo has many physical attacks to choose from with its decent Attack stat of 110, but without Bulk Up they won't be terribly effective. Mewtwo can also create 101 HP Substitutes and use Focus Punch.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Blissey is probably the closest thing to a Mewtwo counter. Since most Mewtwo focus on boosting its Special Attack, the special wall should be able to handle it. Taunt and Substitute sets are Blissey's bane; without Seismic Toss, Taunt Mewtwo sets up on Blissey. With Substitute, Blissey has more issues to deal with. Self-Destruct will eliminate Blissey with little problems. While she is a fantastic counter to Mewtwo, you must always be on your guard against it.</p> <p>Scizor and Metagross can make Mewtwo's life miserable if it lacks Flamethrower or Fire Blast. Scizor's Bullet Punch, U-turn, and Pursuit will put Mewtwo in a hard spot. Metagross has a weaker Pursuit; however, STAB Meteor Mash isn't something to underestimate either. Beware of Will-O-Wisp and Reflect: it will soften the impact from these attacks. Tyranitar has many powerful attacks at its disposal, and is capable of surviving an Aura Sphere from even a Choice Specs Mewtwo with a Special Defensive EV spread.</p> <p>Kyogre and Ho-Oh don't have too many problems countering Calm Mind sets. Kyogre's massive Special Defense, resistance to Ice Beam, and its own ability to Calm Mind let it take on Mewtwo with ease. Furthermore, Surf really hurts Mewtwo due to the rain and its massive Special Attack. Ho-Oh, on the other hand, bypasses Mewtwo's Calm Mind boosted Special Defense with Sacred Fire or Punishment, and with its Special Defense rivaling Mewtwo's Special Attack, Ho-Oh easily shrugs off Ice Beam and Aura Sphere. Both should not be hasty in switching into Mewtwo, however, for there are chances where Mewtwo might carry Thunder or Self-Destruct. Heatran can easily revenge kill Mewtwo with a Choice Scarf, and immunity to Toxic and Will-O-Wisp make it well suited to countering defensive Mewtwo as well. Giratina-O is bulky enough to handle most hits from Mewtwo, and it can easily scare a 2HKO with Shadow Sneak while also bypassing Mewtwo's great Speed.</p> <p>Otherwise, focus on being faster than Mewtwo. Any Deoxys formes, excluding Deoxys-D, are faster than Mewtwo. Choice Scarf users such as Palkia, Kyogre, Ho-Oh, Jirachi, Darkrai, and Dialga also make good options to eliminating Mewtwo.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Taunt + Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>This is a set perfectly designed for Mewtwo. Its bulk, 130 base Speed, and sky-high Special Attack make this set destructive when played correctly. Many walls, Blissey, Lugia, and Giratina in particular, carry moves that are easily shut down by Taunt. After using Taunt, proceed to Calm Mind, bolstering your Special Attack and Special Defense stats. Aura Sphere is the best option here, as it does severe damage to Pokemon such as Dialga and Blissey while hitting Scizor and Metagross for neutral damage. Ice Beam should be the next attack to consider. Fighting and Ice complement each other, especially since many Uber Pokemon are hit for super effective damage by this combination. Thunder pairs well with Ice Beam, obliterating Kyogre and Groudon respectively with no problems. Shadow Ball, on the other hand, pairs well with Aura Sphere. Shadow Ball hits the abundant Psychic- and Ghost-types in Ubers while maintaining perfect coverage.</p> <p>Leftovers is the best item for this set because it keeps Mewtwo alive so it can Calm Mind more times before it is forced to attack. Expert Belt and Life Orb sound very appealing; however, this set should focus on being as bulky as possible. While this Mewtwo does remarkably against stall teams, it is hampered by Forretress with Gyro Ball (or Payback) and Blissey with Seismic Toss, provided Blissey hasn't switched into Mewtwo. To be fair, Mewtwo can 2HKO Blissey most of the time after 3 Calm Minds. In return, Mewtwo is suffering a 5HKO from Seismic Toss.</p> <p>While this set is quite a powerful sweeper, there are still plenty of things that can stop it. Blissey with Seismic Toss can still hamper Mewtwo, as chances are Mewtwo will not be able to KO Blissey before it can KO Mewtwo in return. Specially defensive Forretress with Payback or Gyro Ball can also survive most of Mewtwo's attacks and usually beat it down. Scizor and Metagross are probably the best counters to this set, as both of them can survive any of this set's attacks and KO Mewtwo with a Choice Band U-turn and Meteor Mash, respectively, or eliminate poor Mewtwo with Pursuit if it tries to switch out. Tyranitar hates Aura Sphere, but if it has a ton of EVs in HP and Special Defensive, it will survive the assault and maul Mewtwo with a Choice Band Crunch or Pursuit. Without Thunder, Kyogre is a massive pain for Mewtwo, as it can shrug off anything Mewtwo can throw at it and deliver a swift OHKO with Surf. Ho-Oh can bypass Mewtwo's Special Defense boosts and smother it with sun-boosted Sacred Fires or super effective Punishments, and can easily brush off any of Mewtwo's attacks bar Thunder. Finally, Mewtwo is very prone to being revenge killed by threats such as Palkia, Dialga, Shaymin-S, and Darkrai. (However, Darkrai can't revenge kill Mewtwo if it is at full health.)</p> <p>A physically based mixed Palkia is a good partner for Mewtwo because Blissey will often switch in to Palkia expecting a special set only to be OHKOed by Outrage. Palkia can also fry Scizor, Metagross, and Forretress with Fire Blast and smash Tyranitar and Ho-Oh with mighty Aqua Tails. Palkia can also switch in to Kyogre's absurdly powerful Water-type strikes and will 2HKO any variant with Outrage. Kyogre is also good to have on the same team because it can easily defeat Scizor, Ho-Oh, Forretress, Metagross, and Tyranitar with a mighty Surf. Kyogre can also set up on Seismic Toss Blissey and beat Darkrai with a combination of Rest/Sleep Talk and Calm Mind. Kyogre can also cripple Scarfers trying to revenge kill Mewtwo with Thunder Wave, and can also switch in on an opposing Kyogre's Surf (Beware if the opposing Kyogre is holding Choice Specs) and zap it with Thunder or Thunder Wave. Mewtwo also enjoys rain support from Kyogre, allowing Mewtwo to fire off Thunder without fear of it missing, should Mewtwo have it. Wobbuffet can be used to help Mewtwo set up Calm Minds, use Encore to completely mess up Blissey, and can revenge kill any enemy Scarfer sans Darkrai with Mirror Coat. Wobbuffet can also revenge kill Scizor, Tyranitar, and Metagross as long as it doesn't come in on a super effective attack or can use Tickle when paired with a Pursuit user (such as a Scizor or Tyranitar of your own) as an almost guaranteed way to get rid of Blissey. Scizor in particular is a good partner as it resists all of Mewtwo weaknesses, and can weaken Choice Scarf Dialga, Choice Scarf Palkia, Choice Scarf Darkrai, and Blissey with Superpower, smash Tyranitar and Shaymin-S with Bullet Punch, and can also use U-turn to weaken opposing Kyogre and Metagross, while also allowing you to switch to a counter for said Kyogre and Metagross.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Defensive Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>This is a bulkier Mewtwo who focuses on being able to take hits better while setting up. Calm Mind is once again the crux of the set, boosting Mewtwo's Special Attack and Special Defense to very high levels before attempting a sweep. This time however, Mewtwo focuses of using either Substitute or Recover to help set up. Substitute gives Mewtwo a shield against users of Pursuit (Scizor, Metagross, and Tyranitar come to mind) and revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Palkia, allowing you to switch out to a more suitable counter without being utterly annihilated. Substitute also gives Mewtwo some protection against status users such as Blissey and Lugia. (Beware if the latter has Whirlwind to phaze you as you are setting up.) Speaking of Blissey, Mewtwo can make 101 HP Substitutes, allowing it to always defeat Seismic Toss Blissey one-on-one as long as Toxic Spikes are not up on Mewtwo's side of the field. Because of this, Substitute Mewtwo can be quite a menace to stall teams as their main special wall, Blissey, cannot stop this Mewtwo. (Although Payback Forretress will still give you a headache.). Recover is also a viable option over Substitute. Recover allows Mewtwo to take hits while setting up, decreasing its vulnerability to revenge killers as well as letting it set up in any point of the game. However, without Substitute, Mewtwo will become more vulnerable to being trapped by Pursuit and status moves. If using Recover, it is a good idea to switch Mewtwo into a burn or one layer of Toxic Spikes, as that way Mewtwo cannot be paralyzed or slapped with Toxic. The residual damage with burn or normal poison is easily taken care of with Recover, and it makes Mewtwo almost unbreakable for stall teams since it cannot be hit with Toxic.</p> <p>Ice Beam and Aura Sphere are the best offensive options for this set. Ice Beam hits the plethora of Dragon-type Pokemon for lethal damage while Aura Sphere takes care of Tyranitar, Darkrai, and most Steel-types. If one wishes for it, Aura Sphere can be dropped to use both Substitute and Recover. This way Mewtwo can block status and deflect Pursuit while being able to heal itself, making it into a quite dangerous Pokemon for defensive teams to try and fight off. However, if you go this route, Magneton or Magnezone support is highly recommended to take care of any Steel-types. With Ice Beam as its sole attack, Mewtwo will be totally and completely walled by them.</p> <p>204 HP allows Mewtwo to make 101 HP Substitutes, meaning that Blissey will not be able to break the Substitute with one Seismic Toss, allowing Mewtwo to set up on Blissey. Maximum Speed allows Mewtwo to tie with other maximum Speed Mewtwo and to outpace anything slower than Shaymin-S. The rest of the EVs goes into Special Attack for a little extra oomph. Leftovers is the preferred item to use, as it allows Mewtwo to take hits a little better while boosting with Calm Mind.</p> <p>This set and the previous set share similar counters, so any partner for the Taunt + Calm Mind set will also work very well with this one. However, this Mewtwo is extremely prone to getting trapped and KOed by Wobbuffet, as Mewtwo can do nothing to stop Encore, forcing it to either let Wobbuffet KO it with Mirror Coat or let another Pokemon set up for a sweep. Without Substitute, Blissey will be a huge problem as Toxic or Thunder Wave will render Mewtwo incapable of sweeping. The best way to save Mewtwo from those dangerous foes is to lure them out and KO them with a mixed attacker such as Lustrous Orb Palkia or Expert Belt Dialga. The opponent will often be fooled into thinking they are holding a Choice item and switch in their Wobbuffet or Blissey only to be slapped with a lethal physical attack such as Outrage, bypassing Wobbuffet's Mirror Coat and likely 2HKOing Blissey. This gives Mewtwo a clear shot at setting up. Toxic Spikes is also useful to wear down Wobbuffet, Blissey, and other defensive Pokemon to help Mewtwo break through them. It is also particularly useful if Mewtwo has Recover. Forretress can set up them easily since it resists all of Mewtwo's weaknesses. It can also use Rapid Spin to get rid of Toxic Spikes and other entry hazards from Mewtwo's side of the field, which could compromise its sweeping potential. A mixed Giratina-O is a good partner if using Forretress to stop the opponent from getting rid of your Toxic Spikes. Giratina can also stop Blissey quite easily with Outrage, and it can help get rid of Wobbuffet since the blue blob cannot use Counter on Giratina-O's physical attacks.</p> "

        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<p>With just a Life Orb in hand, Mewtwo is capable of at least 2HKOing almost every Pokemon in the Ubers metagame, thus making it a great revenge killer when combined with Mewtwo's blistering 130 base Speed.</p> <p>With Aura Sphere, Mewtwo becomes one of the best Darkrai revenge killers in the game, being able to always OHKO it as long as it is not holding Chople Berry. Aura Sphere will also 2HKO Dialga, Heatran, and specially defensive Tyranitar 100% of the time. Registeel is only 3HKOed by Aura Sphere, and thus should only be used if the weather is rainy or if you lack a Fire-type attack. Ice Beam complements Aura Sphere's coverage well, hitting the Flying-types who resist Aura Sphere super effectively, in addition to KOing several key Pokemon whom Aura Sphere can't. For example, Ice Beam will OHKO Rayquaza, Shaymin-S, and Garchomp, while naive Giratina-O has around a 20% chance of being OHKOed after Stealth Rock damage. Lugia and Latias are also 2HKOed 100% of the time by Ice Beam after Stealth Rock damage (watch out for Calm Mind Latias though), while the standard 112 HP Rock Polish Groudon will take 90% minimum from Ice Beam. Finally, Self-Destruct is Mewtwo's speedy suicidal finisher, being able to OHKO Blissey, Ho-Oh, and max HP Kyogre. Self-Destruct is also Life Orb Mewtwo's only way of defeating Wobbuffet, dealing 87.1%-100% to Calm Wobbuffet. If you desire a way to OHKO Ho-Oh without sacrificing Mewtwo, Stone Edge can be a good choice.</p> <p>The last move is chosen depending on what you want Mewtwo to revenge kill. Fire Blast is usually the best choice, as it will OHKO Both Scizor--a Pokemon who normally gives Mewtwo problems--and Forretress regardless of the weather. As long as it is not raining, Fire Blast will also OHKO Bronzong, Metagross, and specially defensive Jirachi. If used with Groudon's Drought, Fire Blast will do a massive amount of damage to most Pokemon who don't resist it. For example, in the sun, Fire Blast will OHKO offensive Mewtwo after it takes Stealth Rock damage, while Calm Wobbuffet is 2HKOed. If Fire Blast's accuracy puts you off, Flamethrower is a suitable replacement, though Forretress and some Scizor have a chance of surviving it in the rain. If defeating Steel-types isn't too important, Thunder can be a good choice with Kyogre's rain support. Thunder is Mewtwo's best chance at defeating Kyogre, dealing 84.2%-99.4% to 4 HP Kyogre, and 71.3%-84.2% to maximum HP Kyogre. Thunder will also allow Mewtwo to 2HKO Palkia, Lugia, Forretress, and most Scizor and Metagross. Finally, if you don't care about Steel-types or the weather, Grass Knot can be used to still 2HKO Palkia with a 100% accurate move in the sun, and OHKO 252 HP / 60 SpD Groudon around 79% of the time.</p> <p>Both Naive and Hasty are viable natures, and should be chosen based on whether you prefer Mewtwo to take less from priority attacks or special attacks. With a Naive nature, Adamant Lucario will only have a 41% chance to OHKO Mewtwo with a +2 Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock and Spikes damage, while Hasty Mewtwo will always be KOed by that under the same conditions. Naive Mewtwo will also only be 2HKOed by a Jolly Rayquaza's unboosted Extreme Speed around 19% of the time after Stealth Rock damage, while Hasty Mewtwo will be 2HKOed around 99% of the time after Stealth Rock damage. As for Hasty Mewtwo, it will survive a Choice Scarf Palkia's or Kyogre's Surf in the rain around 54% of the time after it takes Stealth Rock damage (allowing Mewtwo to Self-Destruct), while Naive Mewtwo is always OHKOed after Stealth Rock damage by the same attack. Additionally, Hasty Mewtwo will have around a 67% chance of surviving Choice Scarf Draco Meteors from Palkia and Dialga after Stealth Rock damage, while Naive Mewtwo is always OHKOed by the same attack after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>This Mewtwo set also works well in the lead position as it is capable of 2HKOing most of the common leads seen in Ubers. Groudon and Kyogre will both fall to a Grass Knot, while Focus Blast will annihilate Dialga and Tyranitar. Scizor and Forretress will be destroyed by a Fire Blast, and Mew will also be 2HKOed by Fire Blast boosted by Life Orb. Ice Beam will also destroy the mighty Lead Rayquaza that is devastating to so many offensive teams. However, Lead Deoxys will get 2 layers of entry hazards against Mewtwo, so having Forretress is recommended to get rid of the Stealth Rock and/or Spikes that was set up by Deoxys after it is KOed. Lead Giratina-O, Lead Darkrai, and Lead Shaymin-S are also difficult to deal with. Having a sleep absorber such as Sleep Talk Kyogre or Heracross will help deal with Darkrai, and Lead Shaymin-S and Giratina-O will not be able to do much to a defensive Jirachi or Heatran.</p> <p>Many of Life Orb Mewtwo's problems are dependent on the last move chosen. If Fire Blast or Flamethrower is chosen, Palkia will be a huge issue. Mewtwo will only have around a 54% chance of 2HKOing Palkia after Stealth Rock damage with Ice Beam, while Lustrous Orb Palkia will OHKO Mewtwo with rain-boosted Surfs. Kyogre will wall Mewtwo's moveset barring Self-Destruct, and smash it with STAB, rain-boosted Surfs. Latias and Latios make superb teammates in this case, being able to take Palkia's Surfs, and threatening to OHKO it with Dragon Pulse. Latias can also switch into Kyogre that lack Thunder Wave, and set up Calm Mind on it, while Latios can slam it with Thunder or Grass Knot. Palkia can also take a Choiced Kyogre's Water Spouts without being 2HKOed most of the time, and shock it with Thunder. A Heatran can lure out Kyogre, and OHKO it with Explosion, and can also take Choiced Spacial Rends from Palkia.</p> <p>If you choose to forgo a Fire-type attack, Life Orb Mewtwo will have problems with several Steel-types. Although Thunder will 2HKO most Scizor and Metagross, they can revenge kill Mewtwo with U-turn and Meteor Mash respectively. Bronzong is never 2HKOed by Thunder, while Bronzong will 2HKO Mewtwo with Payback after Stealth Rock damage (and Life Orb recoil in Naive Mewtwo's case). Specially defensive Jirachi will also never be 2HKOed by Thunder, and can cripple Mewtwo with paralysis from Thunder Wave or Body Slam. Finally, if using Grass Knot, specially defensive Skarmory can attempt to stall Mewtwo with Roost. Groudon makes a superb teammate in this case. Groudon can generally handle Scizor's U-turns, and can scare out Metagross and Jirachi with the threat of STAB Earthquake. Groudon also has the option of using Overheat to fry incoming Skarmory and weaken Bronzong. Kyogre can switch into Metagross's Meteor Mash, Bronzong's Payback, or Skarmory's Roost, and threaten to crush them all with Surf. Heatran can easily switch into all of the Steel-types listed, and threaten to crisp them with its STAB Fire-type attacks. In a similar manner, Dialga can threaten to roast all of the above Steel-types with Fire Blast, or hit Metagross hard with Earth Power. Hidden Power Latios can be a good Scizor lure in the sun as well.</p> <p>There are 3 Pokemon in particular who will almost always force Mewtwo to use Self-Destruct if faced with them. Unless Mewtwo has Stone Edge, Ho-Oh will scoff at most of Mewtwo's non-suicidal attacks, and smash it with Sacred Fire or Brave Bird. Even Thunder will fail to OHKO Ho-Oh without Stealth Rock, and the sunny weather that often comes with Ho-Oh will lower Thunder's accuracy to 50%. Blissey's massive Special Defense and HP laughs at Mewtwo's attempts to hurt her, and can even use Protect if Self-Destruct is predicted. Finally, unless Mewtwo uses Fire Blast in the sun as Wobbuffet switches in, Mewtwo will be forced to use Self-Destruct in fear that Wobbuffet will destroy Mewtwo with Mirror Coat. Ho-Oh doesn't have a true counter, thus the best way to deal with it is to either revenge kill it with a faster Pokemon who has Stone Edge, or a faster Kyogre. Due to Shadow Tag, Wobbuffet also has no true counters. If you want a surefire way of defeating Blissey, you can use Tickle Wobbuffet with a Pursuit user to ensure Blissey's demise. Alternately, you can use Dugtrio to finish off a Blissey whom Wobbuffet has Encored into a support move, such as Toxic. Mixed attackers who pose as Choice Scarf users (such as Dialga and Palkia) are a great way of luring in Blissey and weakening Wobbuffet into Mewtwo's KO range. Strong physical attackers, such as Groudon, Garchomp, and Lucario, will usually force Blissey out as well.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>This set takes a different approach to the first Calm Mind set, attempting to sweep with only one Calm Mind under its belt instead of several. After just one use of Calm Mind, Mewtwo will be able to OHKO the majority of the Ubers metagame!</p> <p>Much like the Life Orb set, Ice Beam's main purpose is to OHKO Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Shaymin-S before a boost. With one Calm Mind under its belt, Mewtwo's Ice Beam will OHKO most Giratina-O and all but the most specially defensive of Groudon. Lugia and Latios are also OHKOed by a boosted Ice Beam after taking Stealth Rock damage, while Giratina takes a massive 76.7%-90.7% from the same attack (an OHKO after Stealth Rock and Spikes damage). Even Latias is always 2HKOed by a boosted Ice Beam, and thanks to Mewtwo's insane 130 base Speed, Latias cannot save itself by using Calm Mind. If you decide to forgo using Aura Sphere, Ice Beam will also 2HKO all Dialga variants with the exception of Bulk Up Dialga. Thunder is Mewtwo's most powerful attack in the rain. After one Calm Mind, maximum HP Kyogre is OHKOed by Thunder 100% of the time, making this Mewtwo a great Kyogre lure since most Mewtwo struggle to get past it. Both Lugia and Ho-Oh are OHKOed around 74% of the time by a boosted Thunder (be warned, the sunlight that often accompanies Ho-Oh will reduce Thunder's accuracy to 50%), while offensive Mewtwo are OHKOed by a boosted Thunder after taking Stealth Rock damage. Finally, a boosted Thunder will OHKO Palkia, Metagross, Forretress, and Scizor after they take Stealth Rock and Spikes damage, while Wobbuffet, Bronzong, and specially defensive Jirachi are 2HKOed by a +1 Thunder. If you settle for Flamethrower or Fire Blast as your last move and have ways of dealing with Ho-Oh and Heatran, Grass Knot is an acceptable alternative to Thunder that has the bonus of being 100% accurate in the sun.</p> <p>The last moveslot is contested between Aura Sphere, Flamethrower, and Fire Blast. Aura Sphere is usually the best choice for several reasons. Like the Life Orb set, Aura Sphere makes Mewtwo an excellent Darkrai revenge killer before a Calm Mind. After one use of Calm Mind, Aura Sphere will OHKO all variants of Tyranitar, OHKO the most specially defensive of Heatran after Stealth Rock damage, and OHKO all Dialga sets after Stealth Rock damage with the exception of Bulk Up Dialga. Flamethrower does have a few advantages over Aura Sphere though when used in the sun. In the sun, Flamethrower will be able to OHKO Darkrai after it takes Stealth Rock damage, while a +1 Flamethrower will still OHKO offensive Dialga and Mewtwo, and 2HKO Bulk Up Dialga. Flamethrower will also ensure that Mewtwo will destroy most Steel-types in the sun without relying on the shaky 50% accurate Thunder. If you prefer power over reliability, Fire Blast can be a workable choice over Flamethrower as well. Fire Blast's main advantages over Flamethrower are that in the sun, a +1 Fire Blast will OHKO specially defensive Mewtwo and support Dialga, in addition to having around a 58% chance to OHKO Calm Wobbuffet after Stealth Rock damage (100% chance with both Spikes and Stealth Rock). The main downfalls of choosing a Fire-type attack over Aura Sphere is that Mewtwo will have a much harder time against Tyranitar. Bulk Up Dialga can also be a pain in the rain, and Heatran can be difficult to take down in the sun.</p> <p>By far the most troubling Pokemon for this set is Blissey. Although Blissey is actually 2HKOed by a +2 Aura Sphere, she can cripple Mewtwo with Toxic or Thunder Wave before it beats Blissey. Wobbuffet can also be a serious problem, being able to survive everything but a +1 Fire Blast in the sun with ease, thus putting you in the tough situation of deciding whether to Calm Mind again to survive Mirror Coat, or attack in fear of Encore. Specially defensive Jirachi can also be problematic if you lack a Fire-type attack or it's raining, as it can threaten to paralyze Mewtwo with Thunder Wave or Body Slam. If you chose a Fire-type attack over Aura Sphere, Tyranitar can be a serious problem, scoffing at most of Mewtwo's attacks bar Grass Knot, and then smashing it with Crunch, or Pursuit if Mewtwo attempts to flee. Specially defensive Choice Band Tyranitar is especially problematic, as it will survive even a boosted Grass Knot. Aura Sphere-less Mewtwo will also struggle against Bulk Up Dialga in the rain and Heatran in the sun.</p> <p>Since Blissey is usually the only defensive Pokemon on most teams who can stop Mewtwo, the Tickle Wobbuffet + Pursuit-user strategy can spell doom to not only Blissey, but also allow Mewtwo to sweep through whole teams! Scizor is an excellent choice of a Pursuit user, and also has the bonuses of being able to Bullet Punch Tyranitar to its death and scare out Blissey. Tyranitar is not only a capable user of Pursuit, but can also revenge kill Wobbuffet and defeat Heatran. Mixed attackers who pose as Choice Scarf users (mainly Palkia and Dialga) are once again a useful asset due to their ability to lure in and defeat Blissey, and weaken Wobbuffet into Mewtwo's KO range. A mixed Kyogre with Waterfall can also be a good teammate, being a good Blissey lure, a good revenge killer of Tyranitar and Heatran, and providing the rain support that makes Thunder never miss. Groudon is an excellent response to specially defensive Jirachi, Tyranitar, Blissey, and Bulk Up Dialga, scaring them all out with the thought of STAB Earthquakes. Groudon can also revenge kill Heatran, though it should be wary of Fire Blast. Groudon is also notable for providing the sun that will power up Mewtwo's Fire-type attacks if it uses them. A Bulk Up Dialga of your own will laugh at Jirachi's paralysis attempts, and can set up on Blissey and Choice Band Tyranitar.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<p>When you first see this set, the first thing that may come into your mind is, \"What on earth?\". Yes, \"what on earth?\" is a fairly logical and acceptable response, as turning Mewtwo into a physical wall is very unexpected.</p> <p>This set attempts to abuse Mewtwo's underrated physically defensive capabilities via Reflect and Will-O-Wisp, a move learned by so few in the Uber metagame. With Will-O-Wisp and Reflect, Mewtwo can quickly shut down many of its usual counters, such as Scizor, Tyranitar, and Metagross, as well as stopping pretty much all physical sweepers dead in their tracks. Taunt prevents recovery, so even Blissey will be hard pressed to bring a stop to this set. With Taunt, Mewtwo can also prevent Pokemon such as Jirachi and Forretress from suffocating it with Toxic, or setting up Spikes / Toxic Spikes. Taunt, in tandem with Recover on the same set, is something no other physical walls in Ubers besides Deoxys-D can boast; however, Mewtwo's superior Speed allows it to abuse Taunt more efficiently, thus Mewtwo is not simply an inferior Giratina or Lugia and should not be treated as such. Thunder is an option over Reflect if you feel it's absolutely necessary to have an attacking move on the set. Thunder covers up Ho-Oh and Kyogre rather nicely, as they don't suffer much from your other three moves. Ice Beam and Seismic Toss are other options that can be used in that slot. Ice Beam hits Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Groudon while Seismic Toss will deal consistent damage and helps with wearing down foes faster. If you do not feel you need an attacking move, you may also use Substitute in the second slot to help Mewtwo protect itself against status, and to also help it outstall slower opponents such as Palkia or Dialga.</p> <p>The EVs generate 416 HP, 272 Defense, and 334 Speed. The 334 Speed allows Mewtwo to outrun max Speed Jolly Garchomp, the fastest physical attacker you'll see in Ubers, as well as max Speed base 100s like Mew and Palkia.</p> <p>This Mewtwo has a lot of trouble with most special attackers in the Uber tier. Dialga, Palkia, Latias, and Latios can easily piledrive Mewtwo into the ground with their powerful Dragon-type strikes. Heatran is immune to Will-O-Wisp and will beat Mewtwo senseless with its powerful Fire Blast. Kyogre can come in on anything but Thunder and OHKO Mewtwo with Water Spout. Darkrai can outspeed this variant of Mewtwo, put it to sleep with Dark Void, and set up on it with Nasty Plot. Opposing Mewtwo can also be a pain as they will usually carry a faster Taunt and can set up using Calm Mind while shrugging off any attack that this Mewtwo can throw at it. Finally, Ho-Oh is one of the few physical attackers that Mewtwo will have serious trouble trying to beat, as it is immune to Will-O-Wisp, does not fear Mewtwo's other moves, and will usually be able to overpower Mewtwo with sun-boosted Sacred Fires. Scizor is an excellent choice to pair with this Mewtwo, as it can trap and KO Latias, Latios, and Mewtwo without a Fire-type attack with Pursuit, OHKO to Darkrai with U-turn, and can come in on Choiced Dragon-type attacks from Dialga and Palkia to easily slam them both with Superpower. Kyogre can easily survive a boosted Dark Pulse from Darkrai and most non-super effective attacks from Mewtwo and will OHKO them back with Surf. Kyogre also does not fear Ho-Oh or Heatran that much and can use said Surf to drown the fiery duo. Latias is a great answer to Kyogre, able to survive any of its attacks, destroy it with Grass Knot, and can easily Recover off any damage dealt.</p> "

        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<p>This Mewtwo is the special defensive counterpart of the physical defensive Mewtwo mentioned above. With Light Screen, Mewtwo can soak up many special attacks, including a Surf from a RestTalk Kyogre, Spacial Rends from either Choice Scarf or Specs Palkia, as well as Dialga's Specs Draco Meteor without much of a hassle. (Substitute is also an option on this set for reason mentioned in the previous set, if you do not feel Light Screen is necessary.) Mewtwo can then proceed to inflict a status ailment of choice on the opponent; Will-O-Wisp is the preferred option as it cushions Mewtwo's more vulnerable physical side, allowing it to switch out of Tyranitar or Scizor Pursuits with HP to spare, as well as having the added bonus of being able to damage Dialga and Jirachi. Toxic is can also be used as it takes down opponents much faster than Will-O-Wisp can, and as such it will be more useful against Pokemon against whom Mewtwo doesn't want a prolonged stay, such as Ho-Oh and more offensive variants of Kyogre. Taunt stops any attempt of recovering, supporting, and statusing Mewtwo, making it very hard for Pokemon such as Blissey to get past it. Finally, Mewtwo is fortunate enough to be gifted with a reliable recovery move in Recover, allowing Mewtwo to replenish its health quickly and efficiently, and coupled with Mewtwo's Pressure ability, allows it to stall out low PP moves like the aforementioned Draco Meteor and Spacial Rend.</p> <p>The given Speed EVs allow Mewtwo to outpace Latias and Latios. This allows Mewtwo to Taunt and set up Light Screen without being interrupted.</p> <p>This Mewtwo, like the other defensive set, has problems with Ho-Oh, Heatran, faster Mewtwo with Taunt, Offensive Kyogre variants, and Darkrai. Without Will-O-Wisp, one must be especially careful of Scizor, Tyranitar, and Metagross as both have little to fear from this Mewtwo. All three have access to Pursuit should Mewtwo switch out, and they both pack attacks that can severely hurt Mewtwo if it doesn't (U-turn in Scizor's case, Crunch in Tyranitar's case, Meteor Mash in Metagross' case). Groudon can handle Scizor, Tyranitar, and Metagross with ease thanks to its high Defense stat and STAB Earthquake, as is mentioned many times before. A Groudon with Stone Edge and a high Speed investment can also serve as a decent Ho-Oh check, but must be careful of swapping into Sacred Fire. A defensive Kyogre can easily take attacks from Ho-Oh, Mewtwo, and Darkrai while possessing a powerful STAB Surf to destroy them. Latias, once again, makes for a great Kyogre counter thanks to her very high Special Defense and Thunder. Latias can also check Ho-Oh and Heatran with Thunder if necessary, but only if the sun is not shining, as then Latias will not be able to stop Ho-Oh and some Heatran reliably.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Mewtwo's high Special Attack means it is undoubtedly capable of dealing lots of damage, but often Mewtwo fails to find turns to utilize it, mostly because of the high usage of Choice Scarf in Ubers. Giving Mewtwo a Choice Scarf of its own immediately transforms it into an astonishingly quick revenge killer, and Mewtwo's solid defenses also allow it to take a hit or two late-game, where it is often able to clean up the opponent's team with a move of choice.</p> <p>Ice Beam, Thunder, and Grass Knot are Mewtwo's best attacking options for a set designed to revenge kill and check offensive threats. Together, you hit your main revenge kill targets--Rayquaza, Groudon, and Kyogre--for super effective damage. Rayquaza can threaten teams via either Swords Dance or Dragon Dance, but Mewtwo will always be able to take a +2 Life Orb Extreme Speed (even after Stealth Rock) and OHKO back with Ice Beam, whereas Dragon Dance versions are much less threatening and can only muster up to a maximum of 65% damage with a +1 Adamant Life Orb Extreme Speed. Mewtwo also checks Rock Polish Groudon, as Mewtwo outspeeds all Adamant +2 Groudon and deals 85-100% damage to 112 HP / 0 SpD Groudon, which is an OHKO after Stealth Rock and one turn of Life Orb recoil. Admittedly, +2 Jolly Groudon is not outsped, but it will fail to OHKO Mewtwo with a Life Orb Earthquake, even after two switches into Stealth Rock. In a straight 1v1 situation, Kyogre will beat Choice Scarf Mewtwo, but the 62% minimum damage to 4 HP / 0 SpD Kyogre with either Thunder or Grass Knot is hardly shabby. Kyogre also runs the risk of being crippled by paralysis from Thunder. If one is using this Mewtwo in a sun-centric team, Flamethrower is the preferred option in slot three so Mewtwo can still hit Steel-types, such as Scizor and Forretress, for good damage. Kyogre and Lugia will still be covered by Grass Knot and Ice Beam, respectively, although without Thunder Mewtwo will not be able to deal significant damage to Ho-Oh.</p> <p>Trick is the best general move for the last slot, as it allows you to play mind games and plan out a strong late-game plan, also crippling Blissey and Latias. However, there are other options. Aura Sphere will help against Darkrai and Dialga (and can alternatively be changed for the much riskier Focus Blast). Self-Destruct can damage most Pokemon even with a hindering nature (Mewtwo needs its defenses), and can put the pain on Blissey and Latias.</p> <p>Mewtwo's downfalls with this set are its hugely exploitable Pursuit weakness, and its ability to be trapped and easily KOed by Wobbuffet. Forretress makes a superb supporting teammate, easily Spiking/Rapid Spinning on Choiced Scizor and Tyranitar stuck on Pursuit, while also being able to Spike against Wobbuffet. Wobbuffet can Encore, but in reality most Uber threats are setting up on Forretress anyway, so its importance is often not great. Choice Specs Dialga can blast holes in opposing teams, especially if an opponent's Scizor has been weakened, or their Blissey Tricked. A bulky Kyogre also goes very well with Mewtwo, providing rain so that Thunder is 100% accurate, while also being able to sponge status and weaker special attacks if using Rest. Stacking up on fast and powerful sweepers such as Rayquaza, Lucario, and Darkrai is suggested, so you can fully utilize Mewtwo's ability to check lots of dangerous setup Pokemon who would otherwise destroy strong but frail teams.</p> "

        "name": "Dual Screens",
        "description": "<p>This Mewtwo works very well as a team supporter as it is centered around preventing your opponent from setting up their strategies or using status moves, while raising protective screens to double the defenses of your team. While this set is almost identical to Deoxys-S' \"Dual Screens\" set, Mewtwo has significantly higher base HP, so it can oftentimes set up the screens more reliably. Self-Destruct allows Mewtwo to take down a Pokemon after setting up while allowing a free switch in for another teammate.</p> <p>Taunt, in conjunction with Mewtwo's high base Speed, allows Mewtwo to shut down any slower support leads such as Dialga and Groudon. Under a Light Screen, Mewtwo will always outpace, set up a Light Screen and survive a Choice Specs Kyogre's Water Spout and a Choice Specs Dialga's Draco Meteor. Likewise, Reflect + Taunt, easily stops supporting Groudon and Bulk Up Dialga from doing any major damage. Light Clay is the preferred item for this set. It boosts the length of screens from five turns to eight, a welcome addition to any team in the fast-paced Uber metagame.</p> <p>Mewtwo mainly dislikes Pokemon who will hamper its set up. Scizor, Mixed Dialga, and Mixed Rayquaza commonly carry Brick Break, which breaks the screens, and all three of them can take advantage of this opening to KO Mewtwo. Mewtwo also hates Pokemon with a faster Taunt. Fortunately, this usually only applies to Deoxys-S, who is almost always a suicide lead and is usually KOed early on in the match. While Ghost-types are immune to Brick Break, most of them can't handle Scizor, Mixed Dialga, or Mixed Rayquaza by themselves. Choice Scarf Gengar probably comes the closest, as it can come in on Brick Break and inflict serious damage to Scizor with Hidden Power Fire, Dialga with Focus Blast, and Rayquaza with Hidden Power Ice. (You will have to choose which Hidden Power to use depending on whether you want to OHKO Scizor or Rayquaza. It should be noted, however, that Scizor will still take a lot of damage from Focus Blast, as will Rayquaza from Shadow Ball.) Garchomp will not take too much from Brick Break, and also has a super effective attack for Scizor (Fire Fang), Dialga (Earthquake), and Rayquaza (Dragon Claw).</p> <p>However, the best teammates for this Mewtwo are Pokemon who benefit from its screens. There aren't any Pokemon who won't benefit from dual screens, but there are a few who stand out. Mew can easily capitalize on the protection of the screens to use stat up moves such as Rock Polish and Swords Dance, allowing it to then Baton Pass the stats to a recipient such as Groudon, which will often spell death for your opponent if successful. Speaking of Groudon, a Rock Polish and Swords Dance set can easily take advantage of its bolstered defenses to use both boosting moves, and then go on to ravage the opponent's team. Users of Substitute, such as Giratina-O, benefit greatly from dual screens, as they often get more time to stat up thanks to screens making their Substitutes harder to break. Any other sweepers, especially ones such as Rayquaza, Lucario, and Garchomp who only need one turn to wreak havoc on your opponent, will enjoy dual screen support, as it can give them more opportunities to set up and it makes them harder to revenge kill.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Mewtwo hits incredibly hard right off the bat, easily reaching a monstrous Special Attack stat of 611, although at the cost restricting itself to one attack. Aura Sphere and Ice Beam shuts down many Uber Pokemon while Thunder and Grass Knot handle Kyogre, the latter not relying on weather to affect its accuracy. Thunder's 30% paralysis rate is very appealing, as it still cripples most Pokemon who attempt to switch into Mewtwo. Flamethrower is the best option in slot four to hurt opposing Scizor, Forretress, and Metagross. Fire Blast should only be considered for the ability to OHKO those Scizor who concentrate EVs in Special Defense in the rain. If you don't care about Scizor, Forretress, or Metagross, Trick is a wonderful replacement for Flamethrower to cripple common switch-ins to Mewtwo, such as Blissey and Forretress. Take care to only use Trick against physical Pokemon: it isn't a very good idea to use this on Pokemon who focus on special attacks, even if they are a wall. (Unless it is Blissey.)</p> <p>This Mewtwo set has serious issues with Scizor, Metagross, Tyranitar, Latias, Latios, Blissey, and Wobbuffet. Scizor and Metagross can come into anything bar Fire Blast and KO Mewtwo with Pursuit, as it is often forced to switch out. Since Scizor and Metagross often carry Choice Items, Trick won't really affect them that much, and will make Mewtwo as good as dead since it will still be locked into Trick. Tyranitar does not care about anything but Aura Sphere (which it can survive once with the proper EV investment) and it, too, can vanquish Mewtwo with Crunch or Pursuit. Latias and Latios despise Ice Beam and Trick, but otherwise can switch in on any other move and start setting up for a sweep. Blissey also hates Trick, but it can absorb everything else and wear down Mewtwo with Toxic and Seismic Toss. Wobbuffet can trap Mewtwo thanks to Shadow Tag and destroy it with Mirror Coat. Groudon can easily squash Scizor, Metagross, Blissey, and Tyranitar with its STAB Earthquake and it can also lure in Latias and Latios only to cripple them with Toxic or Thunder Wave. Kyogre can do the same, and also has the advantage of being capable of 2HKOing Wobbuffet with Surf, but has less Defense to sponge Scizor's, Metagross's, and Tyranitar's hits. A mixed attacker that usually has a Choice item, such as Palkia and Dialga, can also lure in Wobbuffet (and Blissey) and take it out by alternating between physical and special attacks. A Tickle Wobbuffet of your own paired with a Pursuit-equipped Pokemon (Scizor or Tyranitar) is an easy way to get rid of Blissey, Latias, and Latios, allowing Mewtwo to tear apart the opponent with little trouble.</p> <p>After a KO, there are a lot of Pokemon who can come in and start setting up for a sweep, depending on what attack Mewtwo last used. Groudon can come in on Thunder, Rayquaza and Garchomp can come in on anything bar Ice Beam (or Aura Sphere for Garchomp), Lucario can come in on Ice Beam or Grass Knot, and Dialga can come in on anything bar Aura Sphere, and all of them can potentially set up a sweep that could potentially destroy your team. Revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Dialga, Palkia, and Garchomp can also easily switch in, outspeed, and KO Mewtwo after it KOes one of the opponent's Pokemon. An extremely defensive Impish Groudon can ward off most of the above threats, wearing down opposing Groudon, Dialga, and Lucario with Earthquake and Toxic (remember that Toxic doesn't affect Lucario or Dialga), and can use Dragon Claw against Rayquaza and Garchomp. Lugia can also use Whirlwind, Toxic, and Ice Beam to take on Lucario, Groudon, Garchomp, Dialga, and Rayquaza. Wobbuffet can also easily come in, trap Choice Scarfers such as Dialga and Palkia, and KO them with Mirror Coat.</p> "

  "Mew": {
    "overview": "<p>If I were paid for all of Mew's movesets, I wouldn't be able to spend it all in a hundred lifetimes. Mew learns every single TM in all of Pokemon, and thus, its versatility is what all Pokemon wish they could have. Except Smeargle, that is.</p> <p>However, Mew can't really come in on anything without taking a decent chunk out of its health. It wishes it had more resistances to things other than Psychic- and Fighting-type attacks. In the sweeping department, Mew is also outclassed by Mewtwo, who is faster and more powerful. Still, it's Mew's versatility that makes it stand out, so its advantages over other Ubers should be exploited. Mew also has the ability to Baton Pass whatever boosts you see fit, which is truly an extraordinary ability, one that should never be overlooked.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mew has so many other options it's not even funny. Don't bother with Choice Specs, as Mewtwo is superior in every way. Flamethrower, Fire Blast and Overheat will take care of Scizor, Metagross and Forretress. Shadow Ball can replace Dark Pulse if you prefer the chance of a Special Defense drop, to the potential of flinching an enemy. Stone Edge is Mew's most powerful physical attack against Lugia, and obviously it will destroy Ho-Oh. Silver Wind has low Base Power and PP, making it rather unappealing, but the chance to Baton Pass +1 in every stat, makes it a viable, but not recommended option. Knock Off is a possibility on the Double Status set as an attacking option that also semi-cripples your opponent, however, burning or paralyzing the opponent's Pokemon is generally more useful.</p> <p>Bulk Up, Barrier, Calm Mind, and Amnesia are all available for Baton Pass sets. Soft-Boiled can also be used on some Baton Pass sets, as it allows Mew to possibly pull off more than one pass. However, it comes at the price of being able to only pass one type of stat boost, unless you go without Taunt.</p> <p>When using Baton Pass, you may find it better to use either Swords Dance or Nasty Plot with the necessary attacks (and Baton Pass). If you are using Swords Dance, you should use Ice Punch, Earthquake, and/or Brick Break, and if you are using Nasty Plot, you should use a combination of the following: Ice Beam, Grass Knot, Aura Sphere, Thunder, or Dark Pulse. However, Mew is completely and utterly outclassed at sweeping by Garchomp, Rayquaza, and Groudon on the physical side, and Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Latios on the special side. Furthermore, many Pokemon are too powerful for Mew, as its 100 / 100 / 100 defenses just cannot hold up to some of the Ubers sweepers, especially if its already taken damage, causing Mew to Baton Pass out almost immediately. In this case, it would just be better to be a pure Baton Passer.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>There is no single, undeniable counter to Mew. You have to figure out which one of its list of sets (and possibly those that are not listed) it's using before you can conceivably counter it. And be careful--Mew can Hypnosis its counters.</p> <p>Metagross serves as a good counter to most Mew, even when Mew has attacking moves, as it can even survive a boosted Earthquake and destroys Mew with Meteor Mash. Likewise, Tyranitar can handle a +2 Aura Sphere and Earthquake, if EVed correctly, but it will fall to a boosted Brick Break. Both can hit Mew with Pursuit if it switches, but it will usually have Baton Pass, meaning it can dodge taking a hit. Thanks to its superior Speed, Mewtwo can use Taunt to shut down any attempts Mew makes to Baton Pass or firing off status attacks.</p> <p>Since Mew is likely to be carrying Baton Pass, slower enemies will have trouble technically countering it, as it will be able to fulfill its role of passing stat boosts without disruption. With this in mind, sending in a faster Pokemon who is able to prevent this is the best way to stop Mew. Darkrai is a fine choice for this, as is a Taunt Mewtwo. Latios can scare Mew off by threatening a KO from Draco Meteor. Weavile, although not very common in Uber battles, is one of only a few Pokemon who carry a powerful Pursuit and outrun Mew, so it will be unable to avoid the hit by using Baton Pass. Deoxys-A can also pull this off, but it cannot switch into any direct attack from Mew. You must be careful, however, as after a Rock Polish, Mew will outspeed almost every Pokemon, except very fast Pokemon who have Choice Scarf (such as Darkrai, Shaymin-S, and Mewtwo).</p> ",

        "name": "Pure Baton Passer",
        "description": "<p>Mew is far and away the best Baton Passer in the game. It learns every TM in the game, allowing it to pass any type of boost it wants. By using a combination of Rock Polish and either Swords Dance or Nasty Plot, Mew can easily and quickly prepare any offensive Pokemon for an extremely deadly sweep. After a few turns with Mew preparing on the field, you can watch your opponent's team crumble under the sweeper you have turned into an offensive juggernaut. Bring Mew in on a double KO, or into something that cannot do too much damage to it, like Forretress, or something that it can Taunt, such as Wobbuffet, and use Rock Polish while they switch out. When the new counter comes in, you can either boost either Attack or Special Attack if you can live through an attack, or just Baton Pass off if you are killing range, as +2 Speed is much better than nothing.</p> <p>The EVs on this set give you the most bulk possible in Mew's Special Defense stat, while also giving it a healthy amount of Speed. After a Rock Polish, Mew will even outrun a +Speed Deoxys-S with max Speed EVs, making Mew a speedy threat and giving it the ability to boost its stats or Taunt quickly. Lum Berry is also helpful, as it prevents Mew from being paralyzed or put to sleep, which would end its chances of passing boosts. You can then Taunt your enemy to prevent him or her from trying to status you again. If you wish to make Mew faster, give it a Timid nature instead, and change its EVs to 252 HP / 36 SpD / 220 Spe. This allows you to hit 320 Speed without a Rock Polish boost, which outspeeds neutral natured Latias, Latios, and Lugia, as well as max Speed Rayquaza. After a Rock Polish, you can outspeed Choice Scarf Darkrai and Taunt it to prevent it from using Dark Void. Leftovers is another possibility over Lum Berry, but it is generally not recommended. The recovery granted by Leftovers is helpful, but not nearly as helpful as recovery from status. If you go with Leftovers, you will need to predict every status move and use Taunt, or else Mew will fail to pass its boosts well.</p> <p>Baton Pass Mew is not a Pokemon who you can just tack onto your Ubers team. It requires a team to be built around it, forming a very deadly Baton Pass team, with all of its teammates playing a very strategic role.</p> <p>A dual screen supporter is very appreciated to have on Mew's side. Reflect and Light Screen bolster Mew's defenses, and allow it to take more hits before Baton Passing out, meaning it can give the recipient more boosts, making a sweep much easier. A dual screener should obviously be able to set up both screens, which requires bulk, and must also provide the means to get Mew in with little to no harm. The most prominent dual screeners in Ubers are Mewtwo, Latios, Latias, Uxie, and Bronzong, each of whom has its advantages and disadvantages. Mewtwo is a very solid option, as it fulfills many of the above requirements, and is usually your best choice, unless it is your Baton Pass recipient. Mewtwo can Taunt any attempts to Taunt it, as its high base 130 Speed is one of the fastest in the tier. Furthermore, it is quite bulky, and after it sets up the screens, it can Self-Destruct which simultaneously damages your opponent and provides Mew a free switch in. Bronzong can work similarly, with Explosion over Self-Destruct and Hypnosis over Taunt, and is bulkier, but at the cost of it being quite slow, and therefore easy to Taunt, which completely halts your strategy. Both Latias and Latios also have access to Reflect and Light Screen, and both have their pros and cons. Latias is bulkier, and therefore can last longer to set up the screens, and also has Wish to heal Mew when it comes in. Latios is somewhat frailer, but it can use Memento, which lowers your opponent's Attack and Special Attack by two stages, making Mew come in almost unscathed. Both Latias and Latios however, are weak to extremely common moves in Ubers, such as Ice-, Dragon-, Ghost-, and Dark-type moves. Uxie has the advantage of being quite bulky, giving it time to set up the screens, as well as having Memento to ease Mew in switching in. Although it may seem like Uxie is inferior to Latios, it is quite a bit bulkier than Latios and is also not weak to Ice- and Dragon-type attacks, but at the cost of being slower, and therefore easier to Taunt. However, Uxie does have access to U-turn, making it able for it to U-turn out of Taunters and even Wobbuffet, which is another distinct advantage that it has.</p> <p>In choosing an attacking Pokemon for Mew to pass boosts to, you must first decide whether you want to make it focus on physical or special attacks. There are many more choices for special attacking Ubers than physical attacking ones, making it easier for you to choose a Pokemon who tailors to exactly what you need. However, there is no central physical wall, unlike Blissey for special attacks, meaning physical Pokemon generally have a slightly easier time powering through a team. This Pokemon must also be able to have the ability to hit many, if not all, Ubers for at least neutral damage with 4 moves.</p> <p>Should you choose to go for a physical recipient, Groudon is by and large the best choice. By using a moveset of Earthquake, Stone Edge, Dragon Claw, and Fire Punch, Groudon can hit every Pokemon in Ubers for at least neutral damage. It has a massive base 150 Attack stat, as well as tremendous bulk on the physical side. After +2 to both its Attack and Speed, Groudon will plow through anything that is not immune to its STAB Earthquake, even the deadly Wobbuffet, and it can use the rest of its moves when your opponent sends out a Pokemon who is immune to it. Furthermore, Groudon is immune to Thunder Wave, making it far harder to cripple. The only Pokemon not OHKOed are heavily defensive, such as other Groudon or Giratina, and thus cannot do much back. It is suggested that you use a Lum Berry on Groudon so it is not burned by Giratina. Rayquaza is another possibility if you wish to eschew bulk for power. Rayquaza has a more powerful STAB Outrage at its disposal, along with mixed capabilities, allowing it to break physical walls more easily.</p> <p>If you choose to use a special recipient, the best choices are Dialga, Mewtwo, Palkia, or Kyogre, the best of whom being Dialga. All of these Pokemon have high Special Attack and a varied movepool to hit many targets for a lot of damage. Dialga excels above the others, however, because of its larger bulk. Dialga with a moveset of Dragon Pulse, Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, and Aura Sphere hits many targets both powerfully and reliably, especially since you will most likely not have weather support. Furthermore, it has a very handy resistance to Extreme Speed, which bypasses all your Speed boosts, and can end your sweep and you Baton Pass strategy. Lum Berry is still recommended, as Dialga is threatened by Thunder Wave, which will completely cripple it. Mewtwo, Palkia, and Kyogre are all still possibilities, but you must be extremely wary of Extreme Speed.</p> <p>To complete your Baton Pass strategy, you should have a \"cleaner\". A \"cleaner\" is a final sweeper who cleans up the remains of your opponent's team, should your Baton Pass sweeper be killed. You can choose to make your \"cleaner\" use the same type of attacks (physical or special) or a different type of attacks, and there are pros and cons to each. By choosing another sweeper of the same specialty in attacking, you have another choice to Baton Pass off to, in case your primary sweeper cannot be used, for whatever reason. Also, in the event that Mew has sustained little damage, it can come back into play to possibly pull off a second Baton Pass. On the other hand, by using a \"cleaner\" who uses the other type of attacks, you can let it sweep, as its counters will be taken out by your main sweeper. For example, Groudon with boosts can easily take out Blissey, which can help out a final sweeping Dialga, should Groudon get KOed. A good choice for a physical \"cleaner\" is Rayquaza. Its huge base Attack stat allows it to deal a lot of damage even when its only boost is its own Swords Dance or Dragon Dance. Furthermore, it also has Extreme Speed to pick off weakened enemies. For a special \"cleaner\", Mewtwo is a great choice. Its high Speed and Special Attack stats, along with Calm Mind, make it easy for Mewtwo to devastate a weakened team.</p> <p>Wobbuffet can also be used with Mew, as Shadow Tag combined with Encore allow Mew to get into play easier. Furthermore, its Safeguard helps not only Mew, but also your Baton Pass recipient, continue its piece of the strategy even when faced with sleep or paralysis status, or after its Lum Berry has been used.</p> "

        "name": "Lead",
        "description": "<p>Mew is blessed with a phenomenal support movepool that allows it to fulfill almost any role in a team. With the moves, item, nature, and EVs shown, Mew becomes an amazing lead who matches up well against many common Uber leads and will reliably put you in a favorable position within the first few turns of battle, if it is used properly.</p> <p>The premise behind Lead Mew is fairly simple: Taunt is for preventing other leads from laying down entry hazards, Stealth Rock is for setting up your own entry hazards, and Explosion is for going out with a bang while hopefully taking the opponent's Pokemon with you. U-turn rounds out the moveset nicely, allowing Mew to switch out of Deoxys-S who Taunt first turn, as well as breaking Focus Sashes and generally being an excellent momentum tactic. However, this set's usefulness doesn't stop there; since Mew can often find opportunities later in the battle to come in and Explode on a threatening sweeper or an annoying wall, it is often in your best interest to keep it healthy for as long as possible. A strategically-timed Explosion can make the difference between winning and losing a battle, so one of the most important things about using Lead Mew is knowing when to sacrifice it and when to save it for later.</p> <p>Due to the Uber metagame's diverse assortment of common leads, you must use a slightly different approach to dealing with each Pokemon who you may encounter at the beginning of the battle. There are four common leads who are slower than Mew: Kyogre, Groudon, Dialga, and Forretress. Since Kyogre does not learn Stealth Rock and does not OHKO Mew with an unboosted Surf (watch out for Choice Scarf Kyogre with Water Spout or a fast Choice Specs version), you are free to use Stealth Rock on the first turn and then Explode the next turn, giving you the early advantage. Against Groudon and Dialga, you should Taunt first to prevent Stealth Rock from going up against your side; you can then lay down rocks on their side before Exploding because neither Pokemon will usually 2HKO Mew (though the standard lead Dialga has a 44% chance of doing so if it has Draco Meteor, it would be left essentially helpless afterward, so you come out ahead either way). Lead Forretress will always carry Rapid Spin, which makes using Stealth Rock a pointless endeavor; however, Taunt will stop its own attempts to set up entry hazards, and you can then U-turn out to the sweeper of your choice.</p> <p>Against the four fastest common Uber leads, Deoxys-A, Deoxys-S, Darkrai, and Shaymin-S, Mew will often find itself unable to use Stealth Rock without being KOed before it can do anything else. However, if you use the right moves under the right circumstances, you can gain the early momentum against all four of these Pokemon. Both Deoxys-A and Deoxys-S are usually holding Focus Sashes, making Explosion a waste to use; in addition, Deoxys-A can 2HKO Mew with either Shadow Ball or Signal Beam if it has 252 EVs in Special Attack, and Deoxys-S can Taunt Mew before proceeding to set up Stealth Rock and Spikes. When facing the former, it is usually best to U-turn right away if you do not know whether it will 2HKO you, but if it cannot then you should use Stealth Rock first; with the latter, you should use U-turn if you believe it will Taunt you, but if it decides to lay down entry hazards immediately then Taunt is the best option because it will be neutralized and you can use Stealth Rock as it switches out. Darkrai can be a pain, but since lead variants are usually Scarfed it can be dealt with as follows: Taunt if you predict a Dark Void (since Mew is protected from a first-turn sleep by its Lum Berry, this will result in Darkrai being forced to switch out as you use Stealth Rock), switch out to a resister if you predict Dark Pulse, and U-turn if you aren't sure. Lead Shaymin-S can 2HKO Mew the majority of the time with Seed Flare, but most will use the less risky option in Air Slash, which is only a 4HKO; therefore, unless you are afraid of being flinched multiple times, your best option is to stay in to use Stealth Rock before switching out to a bulky Pokemon who can tank its attacks.</p> <p>The recommended item, nature, and EVs for this set are listed above; they give Lead Mew the combination of power and bulk that it needs to do its job. The main purpose of the Lum Berry is to prevent Mew from being put to sleep by Darkrai; however, it also protects against Thunder Wave, which is a common move on bulky leads in Ubers, as well as providing a safety net against random status ailments like freeze from Ice Beam. With 184 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature, Mew's Attack stat reaches 310, which allows it to OHKO the vast majority of the Pokemon in the Uber metagame. As an example of the usefulness of this heavy Attack investment, Explosion scores a clean OHKO on the standard \"Boosting Tank\" Kyogre. Additionally, Bold Lugia is always OHKOed if it switches into Stealth Rock, and Impish Groudon with 252 HP / 136 Def will take up to 84% damage, meaning it has a high chance of going down if it has taken some kind of prior damage. Even Pokemon who resist Explosion will lose over half their health, unless they have a heavy EV investment in Defense, which is unlikely given the Uber tier's general bias toward specially-based attacks. A final point of note is that the combination of Lead Mew's U-turn and Life Orb Scizor's Bullet Punch will KO max HP Deoxys-S on average, allowing you to take it out without letting it get any hazards up, if it decides to use Taunt.</p> <p>There is an alternate nature and EV spread that can be used with Lead Mew: Jolly 252 HP / 36 Atk / 220 Spe. The Speed investment allows Mew to Explode on more Pokemon than it would be able to with the first spread, but at the cost of power and bulk. More specifically, Mew reaches a Speed stat of 319 with this spread, which allows it to act as a good check to both Lucario and non-Dragon Dance Rayquaza, as well as being able to outspeed and explode on all variants of Kyogre without Choice Scarf. Adamant Swords Dance Rayquaza's Extreme Speed does not OHKO Mew on average, even with Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, so you can Explode on it and end the threat it poses. Lucario is OHKOed by Explosion after Stealth Rock and one turn of Life Orb recoil, so Mew can tank a +2 Extreme Speed from it as well and sacrifice itself to save its teammates from being swept. While many of the offensive and defensive damage calculations discussed earlier no longer apply if you decide to use the alternate nature and EV spread, this version of Lead Mew can still take hits well and go out in style. 36 Attack EVs may not seem like much, but they ensure that Mew will always OHKO max HP Kyogre, which is the standard for lead variants, as well as anything with worse physical defenses. On the defensive side of things, Mew can switch into the standard Rock Polish Groudon as it boosts its Speed, survive a Life Orb Earthquake after Stealth Rock and Spikes damage, and OHKO with Explosion.</p> <p>One of the great things about Lead Mew is that it can work on virtually any kind of balanced or offensive Ubers team. It generally does not require much support from its teammates because it is the one helping them out, but there are several Pokemon with whom it particularly enjoys being partnered. Scizor is perhaps the most important of these: it resists every type that Mew is weak to, making it a great switch-in to attacks such as Darkrai's Dark Pulse or Shaymin-S's Seed Flare; it can use its powerful Bullet Punch to finish off Deoxys-A and Deoxys-S once Mew breaks their Focus Sashes with U-turn; and it can help to capture the early-game momentum with its own U-turn. Forretress operates in much the same manner as Scizor, except from a more defensive perspective, because of its ability to Rapid Spin, there is less need to worry about how many layers of entry hazards Deoxys-S will get to set up, so winning mindgames is not as important when it comes to gaining the early advantage. As said before, virtually any Pokemon in the Uber metagame benefits from having Lead Mew as a teammate because of its incredible supporting capabilities; however, there is one Pokemon in particular who has great offensive synergy with Mew, and that is its diabolical clone Mewtwo. Since Mew and Mewtwo are both pure Psychic-types who make any Uber battler quake in terror because of their potential to wreak havoc on the unprepared, they tend to have nearly identical switch-ins on a given team. If Mew is able to Explode and severely damage (if it does not KO outright) one of these Pokemon, Scizor being a prime example, the chances of a late-game Mewtwo sweep are greatly increased. In this way, a well played Lead Mew can be the unsung hero that helps an Uber team to victory, even when its impact cannot be described in exact terms.</p> "

        "name": "Transform",
        "description": "<p>Mew, along with Smeargle and Ditto, is one of the few Pokemon in the game who has access to Transform. Need a physical wall? Mew can Transform into Groudon. Need a special sweeper? Mew can morph into a Darkrai. The only requirement that Mew has in order to Transform, is that the Pokemon in question is on your opponent's team. This set's ability to do well is rooted in its unpredictability. Furthermore, by having Mew Transform into a sweeper who is on or is like one who is on your team, it can take advantage of the damage the other sweeper has already done. For example, Dragon Dance Rayquaza is an incredibly potent sweeper who is only checked by very bulky Lugia and Groudon after Choice Scarf users are dispatched. It also does extreme damage to its checks before it is taken out, to the point where they cannot do their job again. If you have Mew morph into a Pokemon who can take advantage of a weakened Groudon or Lugia, such as Swords Dance or SubSalac Garchomp, it will be easy for you to sweep.</p> <p>To use this set, simply switch into a threat who you would like to Transform into, provided Mew will not die quickly to it. Then use Trick to give it your Choice Scarf, or use Hypnosis if you choose to use Leftovers instead. Then, you can transform into the crippled Pokemon, or the Pokemon who switches in. Look out, however, for Pokemon who already have Choice items or are immune to Trick. This set is best reserved until late game. You should scout out your opponent's team before transforming, in order to find out to which of their own Pokemon are they the most weak.</p> <p>Mew's advantage of unpredictability with this set also makes it very hard to suggest teammates to accompany Mew, as its purpose, stats, and typing will vary from game to game. Wobbuffet, however, will work any time Mew uses a Choice Scarf. Wobbuffet can trap the Pokemon who you Trick the Choice Scarf to, keeping it locked into the move it used last. Wobbuffet can easily pick that Pokemon off by using either Counter or Mirror Coat. It can also use Safeguard to allow another sweeper a turn to set up. Dual screen support is also greatly appreciated, so that Mew will not die while it is trying to use Transform. Both Bronzong and Mewtwo fulfill this role very well.</p> <p>Watch out for Giratina-O, who is immune to Trick, and therefore can make Mew keep its Choice Scarf, which severely hinders its ability to make use of Transform. Tyranitar deals with Giratina-O very well, taking very little damage from Dragon Pulse, Shadow Ball, or Thunder. It can also even survive through Aura Spheres if its bulkier, thanks to the Special Defense boost from the sandstorm. Tyranitar can hammer Giratina-O with Crunch, should it stay in, or hit it with Pursuit, should it switch out. Furthermore, since Giratina-O is forced to hold Griseous Orb, and thus has no Leftovers recovery, Tyranitar's sandstorm will continuously chip away at Giratina-O's HP, further weakening it.</p> <p>Since Mew could wind up as any common Pokemon in the Ubers metagame, it is best to have Pokemon who resist the common attacks, them being Ice-, Dragon-, Dark-, Ghost-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks. A combination of Scizor and Latias can resist all of these attacks quite easily; Scizor handles the Ghost-, Dark-, Dragon-, and Ice-type attacks, while Latias deals with the Water- and Ground-type moves. The biggest users of Dark-, Ice-, and Dragon-type moves are Darkrai, Mewtwo, and Garchomp/Rayquaza, respectively, all of whom Scizor can deal with. As long as the Sleep Clause is activated, Scizor can switch in on anything that Darkrai can use, barring a +2 Focus Blast, and kill it with either U-turn or, if its weakened, Bullet Punch. Mewtwo can also be dealt with by using U-turn, Bullet Punch, or Pursuit, as long as it doesn't have a Fire-type move. Finally, Scizor can switch into any Dragon-type move from Garchomp or Rayquaza, provided it's not too badly hurt, and pick them off with Bullet Punch or U-turn. Not only this, but, by using U-turn, you can scout your opponent's switch-in. If they send in a Pokemon who you want to Transform into, you can then send Mew in without have to worry about it taking damage while it switches in. On the other hand, the biggest users of Ground- and Water-type moves are Groudon and Kyogre, respectively, both of whom Latias deals with quite easily. Latias is the best Kyogre counter in the game, as it can switch into even Water Spout and Recover off the damage before Kyogre can attack again. It also has Grass Knot to weaken not only Kyogre, but also Groudon, after it switches in on any support move, Earthquake, or Fire Punch. Latias can also take the Fire-type moves aimed at Scizor.</p> "

        "name": "Double Status",
        "description": "<p>Since Mew has access to every TM in the game, it can make good use of this ability by using a set which specializes in crippling your opponent. Your first moveslot is home to a status move which will destroy any chance of your opponent sweeping. Thunder Wave is more reliable, and can be used on any number of opponents. On the other hand, Hypnosis can completely incapacitate your opponent, but it can only be used on one Pokemon, and only has a 60% chance of hitting. In the second moveslot, Mew has the choice of Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, both of which are \"wearing\" status moves. Will-O-Wisp has the handy side effect of cutting your opponent's Attack, while Toxic's damage will grow over time, forcing your opponent to switch out soon or die. Feel free to mix and match, however. You do not have to have one \"wearing\" status and one \"crippling\" status.</p> <p>U-turn is a fabulous move, especially when used on this Double Status set. After crippling one or two of your opponent's Pokemon, use U-turn to scout out your opponent's next switch-in. You can then send in an appropriate counter, or a different Pokemon who can set up on your opponent. U-turn also allows Mew to take the possible hit from your opponent, allowing your incoming Pokemon to come in safely, as well as dealing some quick damage against your opponent. Soft-Boiled allows Mew to heal itself after taking a few hits, so it can come back in to keep crippling your opponent.</p> <p>Thunder Wave has the potential to help out your teammates immensely. Many of the Pokemon in the Ubers metagame are so destructively powerful that the only reliable way of dealing with them is to check them rather than counter them. For example, Dragon Dance Rayquaza is only checked by Choice Scarf Palkia or Choice Scarf Garchomp, as even Lugia and Groudon, two of Ubers' premier physical walls, are 2HKOed by a +1 Outrage. Furthermore, most of these checks rely on their high Speed stats, in addition to a Choice Scarf. Therefore, by paralyzing these checks with Thunder Wave, you can instantly open many chances to sweep for many Pokemon. By paralyzing Choice Scarf Dialga, you can instantly open up a sweep for Swords Dance Rayquaza. After a single Swords Dance, Rayquaza can blaze through many teams, especially without Choice Scarf Dialga getting in its way. Nothing can truly switch into a +2 Rayquaza, with even Giratina being OHKOed by Dragon Claw, and supporting Groudon taking 74.50% - 87.87% of its health, easily finished off next turn, or if you have a layer or two of Spikes and Stealth Rock. If you paralyze Mewtwo, Darkrai will have an easier time sweeping, as it will not have to worry about Mewtwo outspeeding and KOing it with Aura Sphere; instead it can KO it with Dark Pulse. Finally, if you paralyze Choice Scarf Shaymin-S, it will be unable to check Rock Polish Groudon, giving it a clear way to sweep. Hypnosis can completely incapacitate a check, but you then have to worry about it hitting and, even then, waking up.</p> <p>Toxic and Will-O-Wisp can also play big roles in aiding sweeps. By poisoning Lugia with Toxic, it will be unable to fulfill its role of being a physical wall. This will greatly aid Swords Dance Garchomp and any sweeping form of Groudon, both of whom are normally completely at Lugia's mercy. While Lugia can still threaten Garchomp with Ice Beam, it will be unable to weather Garchomp's (and Groudon's) attacks along with the mounting Toxic damage. Will-O-Wisp can work too, but on different targets. By burning Scizor, Mewtwo will have a much easier time getting a Calm Mind sweep going. Normally, Scizor can either U-turn on Mewtwo, giving you the choice of letting it do tremendous damage to Mewtwo or let it scout your team, trap it with Pursuit, or KO weakened versions with Bullet Punch. After burning it, however, you can leave Mewtwo in on a U-turn, only getting 2HKOed while Scizor is forced to switch out, or only 3HKOed sometimes by Pursuit, should you stay in (this is from the Choice Band set, the strongest set, unless Scizor has used Swords Dance, in which case you should not send Mewtwo in). This allows Mewtwo to keep Calm Minding to KO Scizor with Aura Sphere (2HKOes after 1 Calm Mind, or possible OHKO with +2 and Spikes and Stealth Rock).</p> "

  "Quagsire": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Quagsire has rather average stats, it works well in Ubers thanks to Water Absorb and an immunity to Electric-type moves. Quagsire has one main purpose in Ubers: to be one of the best Kyogre checks in the game. It doesn't do much else, but Kyogre is such a force in Ubers that Quagsire can be useful if you can find nothing else to check Kyogre. An immunity to Thunder Wave sets Quagsire apart from Latias as Kyogre may carry it, which could be devastating for Latias. Without its STAB Water moves, Kyogre is forced to use Ice Beam, which from a standard Choice Scarf Kyogre is only a 4HKO. Encore, Toxic, and Yawn give Quagsire an effective support movepool, which can be used to cause switches and inflict status on opponents. This can be extremely helpful when used in conjunction with entry hazards, such as Stealth Rock and Spikes. Quagsire's main downfall is its low offensive power. This makes it an easy Pokemon to set up against, and it's especially vulnerable to Pokemon with Taunt.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Quagsire has a few usable options; however, it lacks the space to use these moves. Sleep Talk is an option for Quagsire in Ubers, as Darkrai will inevitably put it to sleep with Dark Void, though it's better to switch in most cases. Safeguard is an option to prevent damaging status, such as Darkrai's Dark Void or Giratina's Will-O-Wisp. Earthquake may be used to hit Heatran (who shuts Quagsire down with Taunt) and Dialga super effectively, while gaining a boost from STAB. Ice Punch may be used as it will 2HKO Rayquaza, while it ensures that Quagsire isn't completely shut down by Taunt. Finally, Brick Break is an option as it allows Quagsire to break screens.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Faster Pokemon with Taunt will cause problems for Quagsire, as they will stop it from using Encore, Yawn, and Toxic. Mewtwo is one of the best options, as it can cripple Quagsire with Taunt, while setting up Calm Mind or supporting other teammates with dual screens. Mewtwo can also use Trick along with a Choice item, which will cripple Quagsire and make it easier to counter.</p> <p>A simple Lum Berry will also cause problems for any Quagsire who wish to status you. Darkrai is a good example as it can switch into Yawn or Toxic and put Quagsire to sleep with Dark Void. RestTalkers such as Dialga are effective at countering Quagsire as sleep status won't cause them any problems, while poison can be Rested off. However, RestTalkers should beware of Encore as Quagsire can lock a Pokemon into Sleep Talk while it wakes up.</p> <p>Shaymin-S can switch into Encore and OHKO Quagsire with Seed Flare or set up Substitute from its respectable HP stat. Any Grass-type move with a considerable amount of power behind it will cause problems for Quagsire. Latias, Latios, and Deoxys-A can all use Grass Knot to hit Quagsire with 80 Base Power, which will deal large amounts of damage due to their high offensive stats.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Quagsire's excellent typing, above average HP stat, and Water Absorb ability make it a solid support Pokemon in Ubers. Quagsire is an excellent counter to all Kyogre sets due to its immunity to the Water- and Electric-type moves Kyogre throws around. If Kyogre tries to set up Calm Mind or Substitute, Quagsire can cripple it with Encore and force it to switch out. However, many Kyogre use Choice items, forcing them to switch out immediately.</p> <p>Encore is a staple on this set, as it allows Quagsire to cripple any Pokemon who tries to set up, like Rock Polish Groudon. Not only that, but it's also helpful because it forces Pokemon such as Kyogre to use Ice Beam repeatedly, which allows you to bring in a Pokemon who will take little damage from it. Yawn is an excellent move to force switches and rack up damage from entry hazards. Toxic can be used to wear down bulky opponents such as Groudon, Kyogre, and Wobbuffet. An attacking move isn't used on this set due to Quagsire's low offensive stats. You may consider using a Shed Shell to escape Wobbuffet, as it can Encore a status move and make them useless with Safeguard.</p> <p>The EVs listed are geared towards Special Defense, due to the specially-based nature of the Uber tier. Max HP gives Quagsire an excellent level of bulk, while max Special Defense allows it to survive powerful special moves, such as Choice Scarf Palkia's Spacial Rend and even Choice Specs Kyogre's Ice Beam. The remaining EVs are placed into Defense, giving Quagsire an extra point in its defenses.</p> <p>Below are some damage calculations showing Quagsire's ability to take hits.</p> <ul> <li>252 SpA Timid Choice Scarf Kyogre Ice Beam = 27.4% - 32.5% <li>252 SpA Hasty Palkia Choice Scarf Spacial Rend = 43.4% - 51.3%</li> <li>252 SpA Timid Dialga Choice Scarf Dragon Pulse = 39.1% - 46.4%</li> </ul> <p>A Pokemon to set up entry hazards is a necessity, as Quagsire's ability to cause switches with both Yawn and Encore will rack up a lot of residual damage. Deoxys-S is one of the best options in the Uber tier due to its insane Speed stat, access to Taunt, and the choice of Stealth Rock, Spikes, or both. Forretress is another fine option thanks to its amazing typing and Rapid Spin. Unlike Deoxys-S, Forretress also has access to Toxic Spikes, which allow it to cripple grounded walls such as Groudon and Blissey. Skarmory is another excellent choice as it can switch into Pokemon like Choiced Shaymin-S or Rayquaza locked into Outrage, then set up Spikes or Stealth Rock.</p> "

  "Wobbuffet": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Wobbuffet appears to be a pathetic excuse for a Pokemon with awful stats, sans HP, and a movepool that's as shallow as can be. If one cares to look closer, however, Wobbuffet can be quite a threatening force. It possesses the ability to either kill any Pokemon whom it wishes with proper prediction and the combination of Encore and either Mirror Coat or Counter. It can also use Encore to make a support Pokemon complete setup fodder. Although it's almost completely shut down by Taunt (Mirror Coat and Counter ignore Taunt), it is still definitely a force to prepare for; you can suddenly find yourself without a check to a very threatening sweeper or utterly helpless to do anything as one of the opponent's Pokemon gets a free turn of set up.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Wobbuffet's large and diverse movepool consists of a whopping eight moves. Besides the absolutely useless Splash, the only moves not covered above are Destiny Bond and Charm. Destiny Bond may seem like an appealing option since it allows you to take one more opponent down when you're low on heath, but Wobbuffet does not have the Speed to pull this off effectively and thus it should only be used on Trick Room teams. Charm may appear an interesting way to set up on physical attackers, such as Groudon and Rayquaza, but by the time Wobbuffet switches in to them, they will usually have already set up, OHKOing Wobbuffet before it can use Charm.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>By definition, a proper counter must be able to switch in against whatever it is they are trying to counter. As mentioned, Wobbuffet's ability prevents the opponent from switching if they lack the moves Baton Pass or U-turn or aren't holding a Shed Shell, which means it essentially has no real counters. So if you should meet this Pokemon during one of your battles, what can you do against it?</p> <p>Taunt is probably the most effective defense against the blue blob. It will completely shut down Wobbuffet for a few turns, and all it can do is Counter and Mirror Coat for no damage. The most effective users of Taunt against Wobbuffet are Tyranitar, Mew, Mewtwo, and Darkrai, as they can use the time to set up. Sleep-inducing moves are also a temporary solution. By putting it to sleep, you can force it to switch out, use the opportunity to stat boost, or simply hit it with your strongest moves and hope you can score a KO before it wakes up. The Trick + Choice item strategy is also effective since it will limit it to only one move and therefore ruin its usefulness; just make sure you do this on the switch, or Wobbuffet can Encore Trick. A particularly effective Trick-user is Lugia, a Pokemon who Wobbuffet commonly switches in on. Toxic will help only if Wobbuffet is the last Pokemon on the team. Otherwise, it will simply Encore your Toxic and switch out to a cleric, one of the many Pokemon immune to Poison-type moves, or Wobbuffet will simply use Safeguard to set up a sweeper. However, Toxic Spikes can hinder Wobbuffet's jobs in revenge killing and setting up sweepers, as Aromatherapy can not get rid of them. Finally, Roar and Whirlwind will force it to switch out, although it will still come back to haunt you later in the battle. Never attempt to Roar or Whirlwind Wobbuffet if he is already in on said phazer, or else Wobbuffet will Encore your last used move, thanks to phazing moves' negative priority.</p> <p>As mentioned, Baton Pass and U-turn are the only moves that have the ability to allow users to escape from Shadow Tag's grip. U-turn is super effective, but if you use it and Wobbuffet uses Counter in the same turn, the Pokemon who switches in will receive a pretty nasty dent (provided that they are not a Ghost-type). Scizor is the best user of this, so if you use U-turn on a full health Wobbuffet, make sure you have a Ghost-type Pokemon, or Wobbuffet has a chance of surviving and KOing the next Pokemon to be switched in. Giratina is usually the best choice here. Shed Shell also allows you to switch, but the only practical Uber users of it, Blissey and Lugia, will not enjoy losing Leftovers recovery.</p> <p>Since Mirror Coat is a Psychic-type move, it will not affect Dark-types, which means Dark-type Pokemon can pound Wobbuffet with special attacks without fear of getting Mirror Coated back. Darkrai is a particularly good choice for this when battling in Ubers. Tyranitar also falls into this category but it must be using Dark Pulse and special Tyranitar isn't as useful in Ubers as it is in standard. Choice Band Tyranitar can also use Crunch or Pursuit against it. Likewise, Ghost-types are unaffected by the Fighting-typed Counter and can hit it with physical moves. Giratina-O can slam Wobbuffet with physical attacks. Spiritomb, being both Dark- and Ghost-type, is completely immune to both Counter and Mirror Coat; however, it is unlikely that any intelligent trainer will leave their Wobbuffet in against a Dark- and/or Ghost-type Pokemon. Dugtrio with Toxic can also turn the tables on Wobbuffet, as Wobbuffet will be unable to switch out and will slowly die off from Toxic damage. Extremely hard hitters, like Choice Specs Kyogre or Choice Band Ho-Oh, can bring Wobbuffet down, but if Reflect or Light Screen are in play then Wobbuffet will probably come out on top. Choice Specs Palkia, Choice Specs Dialga, and Choice Band Garchomp can be a nasty surprise to Wobbuffet, since these Pokemon often carry Choice Scarf, and their Dragon-type moves can 2HKO Wobbuffet with an attack-boosting Choice item.</p> <p>A common mistake in using Wobbuffet is to send him in on common Uber Spikes users, like Forretress. This is not a good idea, because Encoring Spikes will almost ensure that the opponent can set up 3 layers of Spikes; thus all grounded Pokemon on the team will take a whopping 25% of their health by just switching in.</p> <p>In the end, you will probably lose one Pokemon (especially if it is a Choice Scarf user) to Wobbuffet simply because you weren't expecting it. If this happens at the right time, this can put you at risk of being destroyed by powerful sweepers, such as Darkrai and Garchomp. Thus, it is often best to keep your Choice Scarf revenge killers (such as Choice Scarf Palkia) hidden until Wobbuffet is significantly weakened, because losing such vital revenge killers can potentially cost you the game.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Oh, no! It's Wobbuffet! (Standard)",
        "description": "<p>The one and only set for Wobbuffet. With little prediction, or none at all if Encore is used, Wobbuffet can guarantee at least one kill against a Choiced Pokemon (preferably a Pokemon with Choice Scarf). Choose Counter if your opponent is clearly a Choiced physical attacker, or Mirror Coat if it's a Choiced special attacker. If it's a Pokemon without a Choice item, simply use Encore and proceed from there since your opponent can't switch out. Encore can also work to your benefit if the opponent chooses to use a stat up move, as this will allow a free switch in for one of your Pokemon and at least one turn of set up. Encore is especially effective against defensive Pokemon, such as Lugia and Blissey, as the best they can do is use Toxic on Wobbuffet, and the move is rare on Lugia. Forcing a Pokemon to repeat a move while preventing them from switching is one of the most sadistic, and effective, strategies in Pokemon. Wobbuffet can also switch into a lead Choice Scarf Darkrai's Dark Void, forcing it to struggle to death. This can be risky, because if Darkrai uses Trick, Wobbuffet is crippled, and if Darkrai uses Dark Pulse, then Wobbuffet will take a massive amount of damage (and it cannot use Mirror Coat, as Darkrai is immune to it).</p> <p>Both Safeguard and Tickle will be helpful as your last move. Safeguard is obviously there to prevent Wobbuffet from being crippled by status ailments and can help it support the team at the same time. The only downside is that Wobbuffet is very slow and will most likely be statused before it can use Safeguard. Still, Encoring a status move and using Safeguard can be an effective way to set up a sweeper. With Tickle, Wobbuffet can become an effective wallbreaker when paired with a user of Pursuit (such as Tyranitar or Scizor). Tickle Wobbuffet's main targets are Lugia and Blissey. Once Lugia is Tickled and Pursuited to death, most stall teams will be vulnerable to sweeps from deadly physical setup sweepers, like Rayquaza or Garchomp.</p> <p>The given EVs are fairly obvious, since Wobbuffet has a massive base HP stat and poor defenses. The 28 HP EVs allow Wobbuffet to gain maximum Leftovers recovery and, with a Calm nature, allows it to survive a Modest Kyogre's full powered Water Spout and OHKO back with Mirror Coat. Calm is emphasized over Bold because of the concentration on special attackers in Ubers; however, Bold can be useful to better handle Groudon, Rayquaza, Garchomp, and other physical threats in the Uber metagame.</p> <p>Thanks to Wobbuffet's ability, Shadow Tag, Wobbuffet is hard to stop. However, Wobbuffet is most vulnerable after a revenge kill. After a revenge kill, Darkrai can easily switch in and ether set up on Wobbuffet by using Taunt or outright kill it with Dark Pulse. Mewtwo can also Taunt Wobbuffet and set up Calm Mind as a result. Because of this, Choice Scarf Heracross can be a useful Pokemon to pair with Wobbuffet, as Heracross can force both Darkrai and Mewtwo out, thanks to its STAB super effective Megahorn. Choice Specs Kyogre can also switch in on Wobbuffet after a revenge kill, so having a Pokemon who can survive Kyogre's Water Spout and scare it off is important. Latias is a good choice for scaring off Kyogre, because despite Water Spout 2HKOing Latias, Latias can use Thunder or Grass Knot before Kyogre can move, thus weakening the Base Power of its Water Spout. Palkia is a good choice as well, because Palkia takes less from Water Spout than Latias, at the cost of no recovery move.</p> <p>The secret to Wobbuffet's success is to use Pokemon who work well with him. Rayquaza is an excellent Pokemon to pair with Wobbuffet for a number of reasons. Wobbuffet can easily revenge kill Choice Scarf Dialga via Mirror Coat, which is many teams' best hope of stopping Swords Dance Rayquaza. Wobbuffet also helps out Dragon Dance Rayquaza by destroying its primary revenge killers, Choice Scarf Palkia and Choice Scarf Garchomp. Wobbuffet can also destroy Lugia via Tickle plus a Pursuit user, such as Tyranitar or Scizor, which greatly aids Rayquaza's attempts to sweep stall teams. Lucario also works in a similar manner to Rayquaza, but Lucario makes up for its weaker offenses with a typing that covers Wobbuffet's weaknesses. Lucario resists Ghost-type attacks and has a 4x resistance to Dark- and Bug-type, all of which are types to which Wobbuffet has a weakness.</p> <p>One of Wobbuffet's main weaknesses is that it can often only revenge kill one Pokemon per match, thanks to its lack of a recovery move; thus Wish support can greatly aid Wobbuffet. The main users of Wish in Ubers are Blissey, Jirachi, and Latias. Jirachi has the benefit of being able to Wish and then U-turn right back to Wobbuffet. Jirachi is very vulnerable to Groudon though, so it is best if you eliminate Groudon by U-turning on the switch, and bring in a powerful special attacker, such as Kyogre. Blissey and Latias are also viable Wishers; however, both are vulnerable to Scizor, a Pokemon who Wobbuffet often has trouble with as well, so only use those two if Jirachi cannot fit in your team. Blissey can also provide Aromatherapy support for Wobbuffet, which can be useful, but is risky because the opponent can easily send in a physical sweeper or an opposing Wobbuffet to set up on Blissey.</p> <p>Wobbuffet has problems with powerful Choiced Pokemon, such as Choice Specs Kyogre and Choice Band Groudon, as they can easily OHKO or do a severe amount of damage to Wobbuffet. Because of this, Pokemon who can use Light Screen and Reflect can help Wobbuffet take the powerful attacks of Ubers much more easily. The prime Pokemon for the job are Mewtwo and Deoxys-S. Deoxys-S can make a good lead, and thanks to Taunt and its massive base 180 Speed stat, Deoxys-S can shut down attempts to Taunt it. Deoxys-S can then proceed to use Light Screen and Reflect. If Deoxys-S is not a good lead for your team, then Mewtwo is the better choice, as Mewtwo can use Self-Destruct after it sets up Reflect and Light Screen.</p> <p>If you are using Tickle on Wobbuffet, there are two main Pursuit users to consider: Tyranitar and Scizor. After Tickling Lugia or neutral natured 4 HP/252 Def Blissey two times, a neutral natured Tyranitar with 56 Attack EVs and a Choice Band will OHKO either of them while they switch. Adamant Scizor with Life Orb and 100 Attack EVs requires a switching Lugia to be Tickled five times and Blissey to be Tickled four times to OHKO them with Pursuit. This can also work with Giratina, but Giratina must lack Will-O-Wisp, or else Giratina can burn the Pursuit-user and live. An Impish 248 HP / 248 Defense Giratina must be Tickled five times for a 87% chance of Scizor's Pursuit to KO on the switch, and three Tickles for Tyranitar to KO. While Tyranitar requires less Tickles to KO these walls, Scizor is not affected by Toxic, which Blissey or Lugia may use on Wobbuffet. While it may be tempting to use less Tickles so the walls will be KOed by the next switch in to Stealth Rock, this is not recommended because a common Pokemon on Uber stall teams, Forretress, can easily use Rapid Spin to get rid of Stealth Rock.</p> <p>In general, any setup sweeper will enjoy support from Wobbuffet, but Wobbuffet is especially effective with users of Substitute. For example, Wobbuffet can Encore a support move from a Pokemon like support Groudon, and send in Darkrai. Darkrai can then Substitute, and scout out the opponent's team. If the opponent sends in a Pokemon who ends up breaking your Substitute before you move, then it is evident that it has a Choice Scarf, and you can then send in the appropriate counter or revenge kill the Pokemon later with Wobbuffet. This strategy is also effective for setting up SubSeeders, such as Jumpluff and Shaymin-S. Another strategy to employ is abusing Thunder Wave. Since Wobbuffet will be faster than any paralyzed Pokemon under a Speed stat of 408, Wobbuffet can easily switch in on a weak move (such as Mewtwo's Aura Sphere), Encore, and then proceed to KO the paralyzed target.</p> "

  "Forretress": {
    "overview": "<p>When people think of Forretress in Ubers, they are usually only thinking of one thing: Rapid Spin. Forretress is the premier Rapid Spin user of the Uber tier and the only one worth using. It has fairly high physical bulk, allowing it to function as a switch-in for Outrages from the likes of Rayquaza, as well as for Draco Meteors, though they do significantly more damage due to Forretress's low Special Defense. Additionally, Forretress can set up every entry hazard, making it a staple on any team, particularly stall, that requires entry hazards and Rapid Spin, which Forretress wraps up, including free shipping, into one pointed package. While its offenses are low, Forretress's attacks still get the job done. Its low base Speed might seem to be a detriment, but Forretress has Payback and STAB Gyro Ball to make up for this. Overall, Forretress isn't that great, but its Rapid Spinning capabilities are invaluable in a tier lacking viable users of the move.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Forretress has a few other moves it could use for its attack. Explosion could be useful as a last-ditch attempt to KO a troublesome Pokemon, such as a setup sweeper or Dragon-type locked into Outrage, swinging the battle in your favor. However, Forretress needs to stay alive for as long as it can, so it must be used only after Forretress's use has fully expired, which is unlikely considering keeping a spinner around when using a Pokemon like Ho-Oh is required. Earthquake can be used to wear down Dialga, but that is its only use. Lastly, a physically defensive EV spread could be helpful to take Outrages even better; however, Forretress will lose its ability to take Draco Meteors in exchange, which invokes a number of undesirable situations. Forretress's high base Defense can do its job of weathering Outrages whether or not it is invested into, while the same cannot be said of its ability to take Draco Meteors.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As Forretress's main purpose is to spin away entry hazards, a spinblocker goes a long way toward shutting it down. Giratina is extremely bulky, taking pitiful damage from Payback and blocking Rapid Spin. Giratina-O is decent as well, though it can be worn down by Payback far more easily, so it must carry Hidden Power Fire to come out on top. For that matter, any Fire-type attack from Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Heatran, Arceus-Fire, Dialga, Deoxys-A, Rayquaza, and Salamence will take out Forretress due to its 4x weakness. However, it should be noted that the latter two must be wary of Gyro Ball and avoid locking themselves into Outrage. Forretress's low Special Defense can be exploited through the use of any strong neutral STAB special attack. This includes Water Spout from Kyogre, Surfs from Manaphy and Palkia, Air Slash from Shaymin-S, and Judgment from many variants of Arceus. Deoxys-S, and for that matter any fast user of Taunt, can shut Forretress down and use it as setup fodder. Generally speaking, Forretress's attacks are very weak, so any setup sweeper can use it as bait to demolish an entire team. Looking at more obscure options, Swords Dance Garchomp can set up on Forretress and 2HKO it after a single boost, with even the rare Hidden Power Ice not KOing and possibly even missing under sandy conditions. The rare Magnezone can trap and KO with Hidden Power Fire. Forretress is not difficult to defeat, but its sheer utility and unique support make it something to account for whenever building a team.</p> ",

        "name": "Support",
        "description": "<p>This set is a combination of all Forretress's little quirks and niches in Ubers. As previously mentioned, Forretress is the only viable Rapid Spin user in Ubers. It is also one of the few viable users of Toxic Spikes and has access to the invaluable Spikes. It supports the Stealth Rock-weak offensive Pokemon that populate Ubers, such as Ho-Oh and Rayquaza, as well as stall teams, which require the ability to switch into powerful attackers without worrying about hazard damage. Toxic Spikes is another important piece of Forretress's niche, as the hazard fits like a glove onto most teams. Its uses range from wearing down opposing Kyogre and Groudon, if you carry the opposite weather, to allowing special attackers carrying Substitute to be able to beat Blissey and other special walls one-on-one. Additionally, stall teams require Toxic Spikes to wear down opponents in the long run, particularly when facing other stall teams. Spikes are also very useful, both to weaken any checks to your sweepers that the opponent might have, and to add to a stall team's pile of residual damage it relies on. Alternatively, Stealth Rock can be used over another entry hazard if it cannot be fit in elsewhere on your team, but quite often it can be and therefore either form of Spikes is recommended unless it is absolutely required for Forretress to run Stealth Rock. In the realm of attacks, Payback is the best option, as it allows Forretress to get past Giratina-O, the premier spinblocker in Ubers, that lack Hidden Power Fire, which can be tested by simply luring the move and switching Forretress out.</p> <p>As far as Forretress's defensive investment is concerned, a specially defensive EV spread and Careful nature are necessary so that Forretress can switch into Draco Meteors from the likes of Dialga and Palkia. Gyro Ball is an option for Forretress's attack, allowing it to defeat mono-attacking Darkrai and to inflict heavy damage on Dragon Dance Rayquaza after it takes an Outrage. Hidden Power Ice could also be used, but its only real use is to turn Forretress into a godlike check to Rayquaza, though it is definitely worth it on teams that are weak to Rayquaza.</p> <p>For support, the first teammate that should be considered is a user of Pursuit, as even with Payback Forretress struggles to beat most spinblockers. Tyranitar is the best choice because it beats Giratina-O quite handedly. A spinblocker of your own is a requirement due to the fact that Forretress usually cannot redo all of its hard work setting up entry hazards. Giratina is the defensive choice and Giratina-O the offensive choice, though the latter does not quite fit that moniker with its still quite high 150 / 100 / 100 defenses. A bulky Fire resist, such as Tyranitar or Kyogre, is recommended due to Forretress's 4x weakness to Fire. Kyogre also brings with it rain, which halves the damage Forretress takes from Fire-type attacks, and as a bonus, Forretress spins away the entry hazards that weaken the power of Water Spout. Carry the necessary support for Forretress should you choose to run it; regardless of how you feel, it really needs it, and there aren't really any other spinners out there should you not be satisfied with Forretress.</p> "

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite being an OU Pokemon, it is almost as if Scizor was designed for Uber play. Scizor is a superb scout for offensive teams with U-turn, which it gets STAB on. Scizor's STAB U-turns do a massive amount of damage to the many Psychic-type Pokemon in Ubers as well. Bullet Punch is a powerful priority move thanks to it being a STAB move boosted by Technician, meaning that Scizor is easily able to destroy Deoxys-A, and is also able to pick off weakened Pokemon such as Darkrai and Rayquaza. Scizor is one of the few viable users of Pursuit in Ubers, allowing Scizor to trap and kill Pokemon such as Mewtwo and Latias. To sweeten the deal, Scizor even pairs up well with Tickle Wobbuffet, allowing the duo to smash Blissey and Lugia to pieces. Scizor's excellent Bug / Steel typing allows it to take on the powerful Ice-type and Dragon-type attacks that are common in Ubers. Scizor even has access to Roost to take advantage of these great resistances. Overall, Scizor's amazing typing and wonderful movepool make it a force to be reckoned with in Ubers.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Baton Pass is a very viable move for Uber Scizor, because it allows Swords Dance Scizor to take advantage of Forretress switch-ins, and attempt to pass the Swords Dance to powerful physical attackers such as Groudon, Rayquaza, and Garchomp. Occa Berry is a very viable option in Ubers when paired with Kyogre's eternal rain, because this will let Scizor survive even Fire Blasts from Dialga and Palkia!</p> <p>The Trapper set can also work with a much more defensive EV spread such as 246 HP / 16 Atk / 248 SpD using an Adamant nature and Leftovers. With this, you're able to take two Thunders from most Latias. This spread, or something similar, can also be beneficial in OU, allowing you to switch in on threats like Gengar much easier and KO with Pursuit. Bullet Punch will still be strong, but isn't going to OHKO like it can with the more offensive sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>In the Uber environment, Ho-Oh is one of Scizor's best counters. Even with Stealth Rock on the field, Ho-Oh can easily come in on any of Scizor's attacks, and destroy Scizor with Sacred Fire, regardless of the weather. Giratina will also wall Scizor's entire moveset, and either cripple Scizor with a burn from Will-O-Wisp, or set up Calm Mind. Lugia with Reflect have no problems taking any of Scizor's attacks. Lugia must be careful if it lacks Reflect though, as Scizor's STAB Bug-type attacks will do a huge amount of damage to Lugia when it uses Roost (due to losing the Flying typing when using Roost). Groudon can take Scizor's assaults thanks to its massive 140 base Defense stat, and either 2HKO Scizor with Earthquake or OHKO Scizor with a Fire-type attack.</p> <p>Dialga can switch into Scizor's Bug-, Steel-, and Dark-type attacks with ease, and either set up with Bulk Up or OHKO Scizor with a Fire-type attack. Dialga must be wary though, as a Choice Band Superpower from Scizor can OHKO Dialga. Kyogre can take a Bullet Punch from Scizor, thanks to its resistance, and threaten to destroy Scizor with its insanely powerful STAB, rain-boosted Water-type assaults. Palkia can also switch into Scizor's Bullet Punch, and either annihilate it with its STAB rain-boosted Surfs, or roast Scizor with a Fire-type attack. Be warned, however, as both Kyogre and Palkia will take a massive amount of damage from U-turn and Superpower.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Thanks to a combination of Scizor's typing, movepool, and offensive stats, Choice Band Scizor is an excellent choice in Ubers for a variety of reasons, the biggest of which being Scizor's ability to revenge kill with Bullet Punch, and its ability to scout Uber teams with U-turn (which hits a large amount of the Uber metagame super effectively.)</p> <p>U-turn is what makes Choice Band Scizor such a threat in the Uber tier, as it does a huge amount of damage to several prominent threats who may attempt to switch into Scizor. For example, a 4 HP Kyogre (who may switch in predicting a Bullet Punch) takes 52%-61% from a U-turn from the more bulky Choice Band Scizor, and even maximum HP Kyogre will take over 50% from a U-turn from max Attack Choice Band Scizor! Palkia also takes a large amount of damage, as U-turn will always do over 50%, regardless of the EV spread Scizor is using. U-turn will easily OHKO Darkrai, Latias, Latios, and offensive Mewtwo as well. The biggest benefit U-turn provides, though, is the ability to scout the opponent's switch-in to Scizor due to U-turn's switching ability, and thus allows you to switch to a Pokemon who can take advantage of Scizor's checks.</p> <p>The other defining move of Choice Band Scizor in Ubers is Bullet Punch, which allows Scizor to revenge kill several prominent threats in the Uber metagame. For example, Darkrai is always 2HKOed by Bullet Punch, taking 54%-64% from the more bulky Scizor spread, while taking 62%-73% from max Attack Choice Band Scizor. Shaymin-S will suffer 52%-61% from bulky Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch, while it will take 59%-70% from a max Attack Bullet Punch. Rayquaza takes 43%-51% from bulky Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch, which means that Rayquaza will always be 2HKOed after taking damage from Stealth Rock. Maximum Attack Choice Band Scizor does not even need Stealth Rock to 2HKO Rayquaza, as it takes 50%-58% from Bullet Punch. When attempting to revenge kill Garchomp, Scizor must have max Attack. This is because Bulky Choice Band Scizor will only have a 3% chance of 2HKOing Garchomp with Bullet Punch after Stealth Rock (dealing 40%-48% to Garchomp), while a max Attack Bullet Punch will always 2HKO Garchomp after Stealth Rock (doing 47%-55%, which means that there is also a 74% chance that Bullet Punch will 2HKO without Stealth Rock). This is not a problem if your team has Spikes and Stealth Rock support, as Bulky Choice Band Scizor will have a 99% chance of 2HKOing Garchomp with Bullet Punch, after Garchomp takes damage from Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. Finally, Bullet Punch will allow Scizor to easily revenge kill Deoxys-A.</p> <p>Superpower's main use is to hit Pokemon who resist both Bullet Punch and U-turn, such as Forretress, Lucario (although Bullet Punch still does a huge amount of damage to Lucario), opposing Scizor, and, most notably, Dialga. Superpower's best quality is that it can make Scizor into an effective Dialga lure, as Dialga will commonly switch into Scizor, due to the rest of its moves hardly even scratching Dialga. Bulky Choice Band Scizor will have a 92% chance of OHKOing a 4 HP Dialga after Stealth Rock, while max Attack Choice Band Scizor will always OHKO a 4 HP Dialga with Superpower, even without Stealth Rock. Most Dialga with only 4 HP EVs are Choice Scarf Dialga and with it out of the way, Darkrai, Garchomp, Shaymin-S, Swords Dance Lucario, and Swords Dance Rayquaza will have a significantly easier time sweeping. Max Attack Choice Band Scizor also has the bonus of being able to OHKO 120 HP mixed Dialga after Stealth Rock, and having a 79% chance of OHKOing 252 HP Dialga after it takes Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Pursuit can put Deoxys-A, Mewtwo, and Latias in a tough position. Pursuit will spell doom for Deoxys-A regardless of whether it switches or not (unless Deoxys-A is carrying Hidden Power Fire). Both Mewtwo and Latias are 2HKOed by Pursuit if they stay in on Scizor. If Latias attempts to escape, Pursuit and Stealth Rock will put Latias at low enough health to be KOed by Stealth Rock when it switches in next. Max Attack Scizor will always OHKO both Latias and Mewtwo as they switch from Pursuit, as long as they have taken damage from Stealth Rock beforehand. Finally, max Attack Choice Band Scizor has the bonus of being able to destroy a fleeing Choice Scarf Shaymin-S with Pursuit, as long as it as switched into Stealth Rock once, as the combination of Pursuit and two switches into Stealth Rock will destroy Shaymin-S.</p> <p>With so many Pokemon being eliminated by Pursuit, Scizor can allow several teammates to have an easier time sweeping. For example, the removal of Mewtwo will allow Darkrai, Shaymin-S, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar to have a much easier time sweeping. The destruction of Latias allows Kyogre to smash through teams (particularly the Calm Mind set with Sleep Talk and Rest). Choice Scarf Shaymin-S's elimination makes Rock Polish Groudon much harder to stop. Pursuit's utility is further expanded upon when in use with Tickle Wobbuffet. After Wobbuffet uses Tickle 3 times on the Standard 252 HP / 52 Def Bold Lugia, Pursuit will OHKO it as it flees. In a similar manner, 4 Tickles plus Pursuit will destroy a fleeing Blissey (max Attack Scizor will only require 3 Tickles). Destroying Lugia can open up sweeps for physically-based Pokemon, such as Groudon and Rayquaza, while defeating Blissey will allow Choice Specs Dialga and other powerful special attackers to sweep more easily. Pursuit does have a flaw on Choice Band Scizor, and it is that several powerful Pokemon in Ubers can easily set up on Scizor after it uses it. For example, Rayquaza, Darkrai, Garchomp, Groudon, Dialga, and many more Pokemon can use a Choiced Pursuit as set up time. It is impossible to counter all of the Uber Pokemon who can set up on a Scizor that is locked into Pursuit, thus it is best to use Pursuit only when you have nearly full knowledge of the opponent's team.</p> <p>Something very important to note about Uber Choice Band Scizor is that it has two equally usable EV spreads that have several advantages and disadvantages over each other. The first EV spread is 200 HP / 56 Atk / 252 SpD. This allows Scizor to not only have reasonable attacking power, but it also allows Scizor to survive a +1 Thunder from Latias. Scizor will also take less from special Dragon-type attacks from powerful foes, such as Palkia. The other EV spread is 248 HP / 252 Attack / 8 Spe. While Scizor loses a significant amount of bulk (most notably, it is OHKOed by a +1 Thunder from Latias after Stealth Rock), in return Scizor gains enough power to turn several 2HKOs to OHKOs.</p> <p>One of Choice Band Scizor's biggest problems in Ubers is dealing with both Stealth Rock and Spikes at the same time. Due to Choice Band Scizor's lack of a recovery move and the constant switching caused by U-turn, Stealth Rock and Spikes will make Scizor's life very short. Because of this, it is best to use a lead who can stop Deoxys-S from setting up both Stealth Rock and Spikes. Choice Scarf Darkrai is an excellent example of this. Choice Scarf Darkrai outspeeds Deoxys-S, and can either 2HKO (due to Focus Sash) it with Dark Pulse or put it to sleep with Dark Void, which also breaks its Focus Sash due to Bad Dreams. At the worst, Darkrai will only let Deoxys-S get Stealth Rock up. Choice Scarf Shaymin-S can also outspeed and 2HKO Deoxys-S with Air Slash. If Deoxys-S flinches, it will often be unable to even set up Stealth Rock. Tyranitar can stop most Deoxys-S from setting up more than Stealth Rock thanks to Crunch destroying Deoxys-S after the eternal sandstorm breaks the Focus Sash. A lead Metagross can defeat Deoxys-S with a combination of Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch, only allowing Deoxys-S to put up Stealth Rock. Finally, although not a lead, Forretress can use Rapid Spin to get rid of entry hazards. Using Forretress and at Scizor together may seem odd, but it can extend Scizor's life span by quite a bit, thanks to the lack of entry hazards harming Scizor. Choice Band Scizor will also appreciate users of Wish. The best two Pokemon for this job are Blissey and Latias. Blissey can take high powered special attacks (such as Surfs from Palkia) that are aimed at Scizor, while Latias and Scizor resist all of each other's weaknesses. Unlike the other Uber Scizor sets, Choice Band Scizor has some serious problems with being revenge killed by Wobbuffet. If Scizor is locked into any move but U-turn, Wobbuffet can use Counter to easily revenge kill Scizor. There is nothing that can be done if Wobbuffet does this, thus it is best to eliminate Wobbuffet before you use Choice Band Scizor's other moves. A good way to do this is to use either mixed Palkia or mixed Dialga, and pose them as Choice Scarf users. As Wobbuffet switches in on a special attack, you can then slam it with Outrage while it tries to use Mirror Coat, often weakening Wobbuffet beyond the point of usability.</p> "

        "name": "Trapper",
        "description": "<p>Scizor is a perfect choice for a Pokemon who can put its opponent into a checkmate position. With Technician, Pursuit becomes a 60 Base Power move if the opponent decides to stay and fight. If the opponent decides to flee, Pursuit's Base Power will double from 40 to 80. While this set may lack the power that Choice Band Scizor has, the ability to freely change attacks more than makes up for the power loss. For example, now that Scizor is not locked into Pursuit, Rayquaza and Darkrai will no longer be able to set up on Scizor, as they can be 2HKOed by Bullet Punch after they take Stealth Rock damage. Although Pursuit will never OHKO Mewtwo, it will still do 51%-61% if Mewtwo stays in, and Mewtwo will take 68%-81% if it dares to switch out. Latias will take 55%-66% from Pursuit if it stays in, while 74%-87% is dealt if Latias switches out. Deoxys-A will be OHKOed, regardless of whether it chooses to switch or stay in.</p> <p>The given EVs allows Scizor a balance of offense and defense. With the Special Defense EVs, Scizor has the ability to switch into Dragon and Dark Pulses from Latias and Darkrai, respectively. Scizor must be aware of Latias in the rain, however, as Thunder will 2HKO Scizor. With only one weakness, it is easy for Scizor to step into many of these threats and force them to switch out. This makes Roost an excellent option to recover damage from switching in to attacks and entry hazards and out again, or from constant Life Orb recoil. Roost, most importantly, allows Scizor to have a much easier time dealing with entry hazards than when it uses Choice Band. The 100 Attack EVs will allow Scizor to easily OHKO Darkrai with U-turn, and to always OHKO both Latias and a 4 HP Mewtwo with U-turn, after they take damage from Stealth Rock. Bullet Punch will not only destroy Deoxys-A, but will also deal 48% - 57% to Darkrai (a guaranteed 2HKO after Stealth Rock damage), since it resists Pursuit anyway. On top of that, a 379 HP / 216 Def Rayquaza suffers 36% -- 43% from Scizor's Bullet Punch, or a 95% chance of a 2HKO with Stealth Rock taken into account. Shaymin-S will take 46%-55% from Bullet Punch, another guaranteed 2HKO after it takes Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Life Orb is the best item for this set. It guarantees the OHKOs and 2HKOs listed above. If the recoil from Life Orb is a problem, Expert Belt is a fine option to remedy it. Unfortunately, not many Pokemon are hit for super effective damage from Bullet Punch. The only residual damage Scizor should really worry about is indirect damage from Stealth Rock and Spikes.</p> <p>Thanks to this Scizor's ability to freely switch between attacks, using Pursuit becomes much less risky than using it on Choice Band Scizor, thus Trapper Scizor is one of the best teammates for Tickle Wobbuffet. After Wobbuffet uses Tickle on Lugia 5 times, Scizor will OHKO Lugia with Pursuit while it attempts to flee, regardless of the EV spread that Lugia has. With Lugia out of the way, Swords Dance Lucario, Swords Dance Rayquaza, Bulk Up Dialga, Choice Band Garchomp, Groudon, and many other physical attackers will have a much easier time sweeping. After Tickling Blissey 4 times, Wobbuffet will allow Scizor to OHKO a fleeing Blissey with Pursuit. With Blissey eliminated, Choice Specs Dialga, Latios, Latias, Mewtwo, Shaymin-S, and many other hard hitting special attackers will be extremely difficult to wall.</p> <p>This particular Scizor set will have huge problems with Dialga, as it not only walls this Scizor's moveset, but is also an extremely unpredictable Pokemon who can cost you a game if you make a bad switch in. When dealing with Dialga, always check to see if it recovers any health from Leftovers. If Dialga is holding Leftovers, it is likely using either a Bulk Up set or a support set. Bulk Up Dialga is best handled by Groudon, as Groudon can a 2HKO Dialga who has used Bulk Up once with Earthquake. Although Lucario takes a massive amount of damage from a +1 Outrage, a Life Orb Lucario can set up a Swords Dance on Bulk Up Dialga, and then OHKO it with Close Combat. Both Lugia and Skarmory can take Bulk Up Dialga's assaults, and use Whirlwind to get it out of the way. Support Dialga will often carry either a Fire-type move or Thunder to get rid of Steel-types. A Specially Defensive Groudon can switch into even a support Dialga's Draco Meteor, and do a severe amount of damage with Earthquake. If Dialga is not holding Leftovers, then it is likely to be using on of its offensive sets (usually either a mixed attacker, Choice Scarf, Choice Specs, or Choice Band user). Although a risky choice, a Garchomp equipped with either Life Orb or Choice Band can switch into both the Thunders and Fire-type attacks that Dialga will attempt to hit Scizor with, and then OHKO it with Earthquake, but you must be extremely wary of switching into a Dragon-type move. Blissey is able to easily wall any Dialga set that lacks a physical move, and can cripple Choice Scarf Dialga with Thunder Wave.</p> "

        "name": "Attacking Lead",
        "description": "<p>This set is designed to beat several common leads in the Uber metagame. The EVs give Scizor just enough attack to beat common leads, and enough bulk for Scizor to be a useful switch-in to Dragon-type assaults, and restore its health later with Roost. With Bug Bite and Bullet Punch, Scizor is able to defeat Deoxys-S with ease. Because Bug Bite followed by a Bullet Punch that will destroy Deoxys-S, even those who carry Focus Sash, Deoxys-S will be forced to either switch out or only set up Stealth Rock in exchange for its life. Deoxys-S leads that carry Reflect and Light Screen will be foiled by Brick Break destroying its screens, and then Deoxys-S will be destroyed itself via Bug Bite and Bullet Punch. Deoxys-S will also be unable to OHKO Scizor with any move it has; not even Hidden Power Fire and Fire Punch will not OHKO this Scizor! Darkrai leads are also beaten thanks to Lum Berry. Darkrai will be unable to OHKO Scizor with any move it uses, while Scizor will always OHKO Darkrai with Bug Bite (and will be destroyed by Bullet Punch the following turn if holding a Focus Sash). Mewtwo leads will be beaten in a similar manner to the way Darkrai leads are destroyed, as Mewtwo leads will almost never be able to fit a Fire-type attack into their move sets. Choice Scarf Shaymin-S leads are 3HKOed by Bullet Punch, while Shaymin-S is only able to 3HKO Scizor with Air Slash, which means that Scizor will win due to Bullet Punch's priority. Scizor does have a chance against Tyranitar leads as well. Tyranitar will be unable to OHKO Scizor with Flamethrower without a significant EV investment in Special Attack, and will only have a 28% chance of OHKOing Scizor with Fire Punch when using 116 Attack EVs and a neutral nature. Scizor in return, will always outspeed and 2HKO Tyranitar leads with Brick Break. Be warned though, because if the Tyranitar is using a +Attack nature, it will have a much higher chance of OHKOing Scizor with Fire Punch. If you do not want to risk this, Groudon can be switched in to scare off Tyranitar.</p> <p>There are several leads who you should be prepared for whenever using Uber lead Scizor. Kyogre can take any of its attacks, and either 2HKO it with Surf (if Kyogre is the Thunder Wave lead) or OHKO it with Water Spout. Lead Groudon can easily take Scizor's attacks, thanks to its massive Defense stat, and can use the time to either 2HKO Scizor with Earthquake, OHKO Scizor with Fire Punch, or lay down Stealth Rock. Lead Dialga resists Bullet Punch, and can easily OHKO Scizor with Flamethrower, or predict the switch and set up Stealth Rock. Scizor can pair up well with a Specially Defensive Groudon, as this type of Groudon can survive even Draco Meteors from Dialga, and threaten to do a severe amount of damage with Earthquake. Like with Trapper Scizor, Life Orb or Choice Band Garchomp can switch into Dialga's Flamethrower, and threaten to destroy Dialga with its STAB Earthquakes. Blissey is able to wall both lead Kyogre and lead Dialga with no problems thanks to its massive Special Defense stat. Palkia and Latias can also be used to defeat lead Kyogre, but be warned that many lead Kyogre carry Thunder Wave for the purpose of crippling Palkia and Latias. Bulk Up Dialga works extremely well with lead Scizor in this case, as it can use most lead Kyogre as set up time. Since most lead Groudon do not carry Fire Punch, Shaymin-S can be switched in to scare off Groudon with the threat of a STAB super effective Seed Flare. Skarmory can switch in on Groudon, and set up Spikes if Groudon lacks a Fire-type attack. A Bulky Kyogre (preferably with a Bold nature, Rest, and Sleep Talk) can scare Groudon off with the threat of hitting it with STAB super effective Surfs boosted by the rain. Finally, Giratina can be used to weaken lead Groudon with Will-O-Wisp.</p> "

        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<p>This set may seem odd at first, as unlike all the other Scizor sets, this set focuses on Scizor's defenses. While this may seem like a waste of Scizor's great Attack stat, Scizor's wonderful Bug- / Steel typing and Roost allow it to take on the many Dragon- and Ice-type attacks in Ubers.</p> <p>U-turn is on this Scizor for a number of reasons. When the opponent sees that a Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf Palkia, can not even 4HKO this Scizor with Spacial Rend, they will often switch to a better way to deal with Scizor. U-turn will let Scizor scout and damage the opponent's next switch-in, and let you switch to a Pokemon who will beat your opponent's Pokemon. U-turn will also be Scizor's best weapon against Latias and offensive Mewtwo, who will take 63% - 75% and 59% - 70% respectively. Darkrai will also take 74% - 87% from Scizor's U-turn, weakening to the point where almost any priority move can KO it. Bullet Punch, while being much weaker than usual, is still a great move on Scizor because it lets it easily OHKO Deoxys-A before it can move, and allows Scizor to revenge kill several weakened Pokemon. For example, Bullet Punch will deal 32% - 38% to Darkrai, 30% - 36% to Shaymin-S, and 25% - 30% to Rayquaza. Note that all three of these Pokemon are 3HKOed by Bullet Punch, after taking Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>The final move slot has many viable moves to choose from. The first is Brick Break. Brick Break's main purpose is to break both Light Screen and Reflect. This is extremely useful in Ubers, as users of both Light Screen and Reflect (such as Mewtwo) have the potential to set up not only deadly sweepers (such as Groudon and Rayquaza), but also Baton Pass Mew. Baton Pass Mew is incredibly hard to stop when both Light Screen and Reflect are up, thus Scizor's Brick Break can make teams centered around Baton Pass Mew much easier to stop. Light Screen is another good move to choose. As mentioned before, many Choiced Pokemon who are locked into an unfavorable attack will switch out, thus allowing Scizor to set up Light Screen, which will make the hard hitting Special threats that may switch into Scizor (such as Kyogre and Dialga) much easier for the rest of your team to handle. Knock Off is another viable option on Scizor. Knock Off's item removing effects will annoy common Scizor switch-ins, such as Forretress and Giratina, as neither will like losing their Leftovers recovery, especially since they lack a recovery move, or a reliable one in Giratina's case. More importantly, Knock Off will allow Scizor to potentially reveal the sets of the many unpredictable Pokemon of Ubers. This is especially great against Dialga, who is not only a huge threat to Scizor, but to the rest of your team due to its unpredictability. With its item seen and removed, guessing which set Dialga is using becomes a far less dangerous task. Finally, Toxic can be a useful move for Scizor to use. Toxic can greatly shorten the life of common Scizor switch-ins, such as Kyogre, Groudon, and Palkia, and will also let Scizor beat Lugia. Toxic can be used to poison Pokemon, such as Garchomp and Palkia, who are locked into Outrage, allowing you to rack up some poison damage when they use their most powerful move. Be warned though, several of Scizor's other common switch-ins (such as Forretress, Giratina, and Dialga) will not care about Toxic at all.</p> <p>The EVs and nature are crucial to how this set plays. The 244 HP EVs and 76 Defense EVs allow Scizor to never be 2HKOed by a Choice Band Outrage from Garchomp after taking Stealth Rock damage and gaining Leftovers recovery. An Adamant Choice Band Dialga will only have a 10% chance of 2HKOing this Scizor with Outrage as well. Thanks to this bulk, Scizor will often be able to take both physical and special Dragon-type assaults, an extremely valuable quality in Ubers. The Special Defense EVs and the Careful nature allow Scizor to survive a Latias's Dragon Pulse followed by a Thunder, even after Stealth Rock. With such a large amount of Special Defense, this Scizor will have no problems taking resisted Choice-boosted attacks, such as Palkia's Spacial Rend and Choice Specs Kyogre's Ice Beam. To makes this even sweeter, the combination of Scizor's heavy investment in Special Defense, HP, and Leftovers allows Scizor to never be 2HKOed by an unboosted Thunder from Timid Palkia, Dialga, or Kyogre. This allows Scizor to switch into half of Choice Scarf Kyogre's moveset (Ice Beam and Thunder), and will keep Scizor safe from any of Choice Scarf Dialga's non Fire-type attacks. Groudon should always be considered as a teammate for bulky Uber Scizor, because, thanks to Groudon's eternal sunlight, even Choice Specs Palkia will be unable to 2HKO Scizor with Surf with Stealth Rock support! Kyogre's rain can also be very useful to this Scizor, as it can let it live through Flamethrower from Dialga or Palkia with enough health left to possibly recover later. Roost furthers Scizor's ability to take these powerful special attacks, and is especially valuable considering that the only other viable Steel-type Pokemon in Ubers with access to an immediate recovery move is Skarmory, who has an unfortunate weakness to Thunder and less Special Defense. The 22 Attack EVs are simply there to let Scizor have an extra bit of power, but feel free to move these EVs to either Defense or Special Defense if you feel the extra power is not needed. Something to note is that as bulky this Scizor is, Latias will have an 80% chance of 2HKOing Scizor with Thunder, if Scizor switches into its Thunder, after Stealth Rock damage. Also, a Modest Choice Specs Dialga has a small chance of doing the same with Draco Meteor. To solve this, you can use the spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD with a Careful nature. With this spread, Latias will only have a 6% chance of 2HKOing Scizor with Thunder after Stealth Rock, while Choice Specs Dialga will never be able to 2HKO Scizor with Draco Meteor. This alternate EV spread comes with a consequence though; Scizor will often be 2HKOed by a Choice Band Garchomp's Outrage after it takes Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>While this Scizor set will take on Choiced Pokemon very well, Pokemon who bluff a Choice item (such as Kyogre, Dialga, and Palkia), but are carrying a different items can cause huge problems for bulky Uber Scizor. Thus, it is best to look for information that can reveal whether or not the opposing Pokemon is carrying a Choice Scarf. For example, if Dialga and Kyogre recover their health via Leftovers, this means that you should switch Scizor back out, as Dialga and Kyogre are bound to do a massive amount of damage to Scizor. Life Orb damage will also give away Kyogre's, Dialga's, and Palkia's item. Palkia will often use Lustrous Orb as well, so it is best to be very careful when facing Palkia. If for any reason these Pokemon are not carrying items, then Latias and Garchomp will prove to be excellent partners for Uber bulky Scizor. Latias will be able to easily take Kyogre's Water-type assaults, and easily set up Calm Minds as Kyogre struggles to do much damage to Latias. Both Life Orb and Choice Band Garchomp can take the Thunders and Fire Blasts Dialga aims at Scizor, and then OHKO Dialga with Earthquake. Both Latias and Garchomp can take the Fire- and Electric-type attacks that Palkia aims at Scizor, and then outspeed and OHKO it with their STAB Dragon-type attacks.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>While Scizor may be slow, its access to Bullet Punch (which deals more damage than Rayquaza's Extreme Speed), superb typing, and Roost set it apart from Rayquaza and Lucario. Another significant selling point of Swords Dance Scizor as a late game sweeper is that it can easily set up on Forretress, a Pokemon who normally gives Scizor trouble.</p> <p>After one Swords Dance, Scizor is capable of OHKOing Pokemon such as Darkrai, Shaymin-S, and even Rayquaza with Bullet Punch after Stealth Rock damage. Roost is incredibly useful on this set. Scizor's typing gives it many opportunities to heal against or potentially set up on foes, such as Choice Scarf Pokemon locked into a resisted attack, as well as defensive Pokemon, such as Forretress and Blissey. For the last move, Bug Bite is the main choice, as it ensures that Scizor will easily OHKO Wobbuffet after a Swords Dance, as well as Mewtwo, Latias, and Latios before a Swords Dance. Scizor can also easily 2HKO even the bulkiest Groudon, and will even OHKO 4/0 Groudon after Spikes or Stealth Rock damage (if you have Life Orb). Superpower can be used to hit Dialga, as well as OHKO Heatran on the switch before a Swords Dance. Finally, Scizor can use U-turn to scout with early on in the match before sweeping once the opponent's Steel-type resisters are KOed.</p> <p>Stealth Rock support is highly recommended for Scizor, because it relies on it to gain several KOs after a Swords Dance. Spikes and Stealth Rock support together is also welcome, as this will allow Life Orb Scizor to always OHKO Garchomp with a +2 Bullet Punch, while Metal Coat Scizor will always OHKO Mewtwo with a +2 Bullet Punch.</p> <p>Scizor has several viable items to choose from: Life Orb, Metal Coat, and Leftovers. Each of them have some specific advantages and disadvantages. Life Orb will grant Scizor the most power. In addition to boosting the power of Bullet Punch, it will also boost the power of Scizor's other attacks. This is especially useful against Lugia, as the extra power Life Orb grants Bug Bite will allow Scizor to sometimes OHKO Lugia after it takes Stealth Rock damage. Even if Lugia puts up Reflect, Bug Bite will still do enough damage to force Lugia to restore its health with Roost, thus allowing you to KO it in its Bug-type-weak state. While Metal Coat won't offer as much power and doesn't boost anything other than Bullet Punch, its main advantage over Life Orb is the lack of recoil, thus allowing Scizor to last longer on the battlefield (which is especially important if Scizor is your main Dragon-type resister). This is particularly useful if you decide to use U-turn, as the recoil from Life Orb and entry hazards can quickly drain Scizor of its health. Finally, if you are content with losing more KOs, Leftovers can be a good choice to give Scizor more survivialbility.</p> <p>Swords Dance Scizor's biggest foes are Pokemon who resist Bullet Punch and can hit back with a Fire- or rain-boosted Water-type attack. This means that Palkia, Dialga, Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and Heatran will usually shut Scizor down effectively. If you use Life Orb Scizor you can use Bug Bite on the switch; it will deal such a massive amount of damage to Palkia and minimum HP Kyogre that they will almost always be in the KO range of Bullet Punch after Stealth Rock damage. In a similar manner, if you decide to use Superpower, you can OHKO Dialga and Heatran switch-ins. Thunder Wave Kyogre can easily switch into Heatran and Ho-Oh's Fire-type attacks with some Speed investment, and OHKO them with Surf. It can also paralyze Palkia, allowing you to OHKO with a +2 Bug Bite or Superpower. In a similar vein, Latias can easily switch into Kyogre, Palkia's non-Dragon-type attacks, or even set up on Choice Scarf Heatran. Garchomp can easily OHKO Heatran, Palkia, and Ho-Oh with Earthquake, Outrage, and Stone Edge respectively, as well as dealing massive damage to Dialga with Earthquake. Finally, a Heatran of your own can defeat most Dialga, and take advantage of Choice Scarf Palkia's Fire-type attacks (watch out for Surf in the rain, though).</p> "

  "Heracross": {
    "overview": "<p>Heracross is often considered to be inferior to its metallic Bug-typed brother Scizor, but this assumption is not always true in Ubers. With access to STAB Megahorn and Close Combat, coupled with the fact that many Pokemon in Ubers are weak to Bug- and Fighting-type attacks, Heracross can thrive in Ubers with its Choice sets. Heracross separates itself from other offensive Pokemon by welcoming poison and burn status to boost its already high Attack stat even more. Heracross's unique resistances to Fighting- and Dark-type attacks, moderate Speed, and humongous power are also strong incentives, and are its main advantages over Scizor. These traits make it an excellent candidate for any team, especially those in need of a good Darkrai check. Although it lacks the bulk of many other Pokemon in Ubers, it is sufficient enough to take at least one hit from many threats.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Heracross can use a RestTalk set with Bulk Up and Megahorn, but PP can run out quickly, and Megahorn may end up missing at an unfavorable time; Dialga is the superior option for such a set. A Swords Dance sweeper set with Close Combat, Night Slash, and Megahorn can be used, but it desperately needs Wobbuffet to set up properly and it has no priority to finish off faster sweepers. Lucario would be a far superior option in this regard.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Giratina and Giratina-O are Heracross's greatest counters thanks to their immense bulk, immunity to Close Combat, and resistance to Megahorn, although the latter can be 2HKOed by a Choice Banded Night Slash. Ho-Oh sports a quadruple resistance to Megahorn as well as a 2x resistance to Close Combat, and can easily OHKO Heracross with Brave Bird or Sacred Fire. However, Ho-Oh is OHKOed by Stone Edge and 2HKOed by Close Combat after taking Stealth Rock damage. Lugia can switch into Choice Scarf Heracross and stall it out with Reflect and Roost. Scizor can easily handle the Choice Scarf set due to its resistance to Megahorn and the ability to 2HKO Heracross with Bullet Punch. Furthermore, Scizor can OHKO Heracross with a Choice Band-boosted Bullet Punch after a Defense drop from Close Combat. Bullet Punch will also pick off SubSalac Heracross if the Substitute is not up. Finally, Wobbuffet can revenge any Choiced Heracross not locked into Megahorn.</p> <p>Groudon's bulk and Fire Punch can make quick work of Heracross, usually surviving whatever Heracross throws at it. Rayquaza boasts resists to both of Heracross's main attacks, and can finish it off with a STAB Dragon-type attack or Extreme Speed if Heracross is SubSalac. Forretress can set up entry hazards against Choice Scarf Heracross as long as it avoids Close Combat. Faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Dialga, Palkia, Shaymin-S, and Jirachi can often make short work of Heracross. The former two can smash it with Fire Blast (or Surf in Palkia's case, should it be raining), Shaymin-S can OHKO with Air Slash, and Jirachi can flinch Heracross to death with Iron Head. However, none of these Pokemon will enjoy switching into Heracross's powerful moves and, with the exception of Shaymin-S, can lose to Choice Band Heracross one-on-one under certain circumstances.</p> <p>As much as Heracross will enjoy Toxic Spikes at first, they will eventually wear down Heracross quickly, which means it is actually not a terrible idea to use them against it, especially if you have a solid Heracross counter to help neutralize the boost from Guts.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf, Adamant nature, and the given EVs, Heracross reaches 396 Speed, which is enough to outspeed max Speed Darkrai and Mewtwo, and OHKO both with Megahorn. This already separates Heracross from Scizor, who can subsequently be smacked by Flamethrower or hit with Dark Void by the faster Mewtwo and Darkrai, respectively. Heracross can also take down many of the most common Ubers with Stealth Rock and Spikes support, such as Dialga, who is guaranteed to be OHKOed by Close Combat after Stealth Rock. Choice Scarf Heracross's main selling point, however, is being able to almost perfectly counter Darkrai thanks to its resistance to Dark Pulse and Focus Blast, ability to absorb sleep with Sleep Talk, and the strength to OHKO it back on a whim.</p> <p>Close Combat, Megahorn, and Stone Edge are all necessary to achieve 2HKOs on most Uber Pokemon, while the last move depends solely on the player's needs. Sleep Talk allows Heracross to switch in on Darkrai's Dark Void, and KO it no matter what attack is chosen thanks to the Guts boost. However, Sleep Talk can only be used once while holding a Choice item; subsequent uses will cause the move to fail. Night Slash is Heracross's most powerful attack against Giratina-O, although it is still only a 3HKO at best.</p> <p>To outspeed Deoxys-A and Modest Choice are common, so the choice in losing the power for the Speed is entirely up to the user. Toxic is Heracross's best option against incoming Lugia and Giratina-O, and although it won't do any immediate damage, it will severely hinder both of them for the rest of the match. Finally, Pursuit can hurt Latios, Latias, and Mewtwo as they switch out fearing Megahorn. However, being trapped into a 40 Base Power attack is less than ideal. Heracross's ability, Guts, allows it to take advantage of status, most notably from Toxic Spikes, Blissey's Toxic, and Mewtwo's Will-O-Wisp. The boost from its ability allows Heracross to 2HKO or OHKO all commonly used Pokemon in Ubers with the exception of Giratina-O and Giratina. Keep in mind that, despite this boost, the aforementioned moves and Pokemon tend to appear on stall-based teams and will very likely have either Giratina-O or Giratina as a team member.</p> <p>Heracross needs Spikes and Stealth Rock support to be a major threat in Ubers. Deoxys leads have access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes, and can often lure in priority users who could otherwise easily revenge kill Heracross. Lugia, Ho-Oh, Giratina-O, and Giratina are often major issues for Heracross, making Darkrai an excellent partner, as it is able to destroy Lugia, Giratina, and Giratina-O with Dark Pulse, although it must be wary of switching into the latter due to its powerful Draco Meteor. Kyogre's bulk, resistance to Fire-type attacks, and ability to Calm Mind in the face of many of the Ubers that threaten Heracross make it a perfect partner for it, as it can eliminate Ho-Oh, Lugia, and Giratina fairly easily. Kyogre's Drizzle also weakens Fire-type attacks for Heracross, allowing it to often survive a hit from the likes of Mewtwo, Choice Scarf Palkia, and Dialga, and retaliate with its powerful Megahorn or Close Combat.</p> <p>If Heracross is locked into anything but Megahorn, Wobbuffet can annihilate it with Counter. Unfortunately, Wobbuffet can not be countered thanks to Shadow Tag. Mixed attackers such as Dialga and Palkia can often lure in Wobbuffet and destroy it with a combination of their special and physical attacks. Thanks to Dialga's convenient typing, it can check Giratina and Giratina-O as well, while Heracross resists Dialga's weaknesses to Ground and Fighting. Palkia's 4x resistance to Fire- and Water-type moves also allow it to absorb some of the most powerful attacks aimed at Heracross. Wobbuffet makes another fantastic partner to Heracross, as it can not only trap Lugia and kill it with Mirror Coat if it decides to attack, but it can also revenge kill Pokemon with Choice Scarf that can revenge kill Heracross, such as Choice Scarf Dialga or Choice Scarf Palkia. If you opt to use Wobbuffet, another sweeper such as Rayquaza will make an excellent partner to Heracross, cleaning up any Pokemon Heracross failed to finish off.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Almost identical to the Choice Scarf set, but with a key difference in power and bulk. With the HP EVs, Heracross can survive almost any attack and OHKO back with one of its STAB attacks. Unlike the Choice Scarf set, Guts is not a necessity to hit hard, thanks to the boost already given by Choice Band.</p> <p>Although Guts activation isn't necessary to achieve this set's goals, the boost in power will decimate defensive teams without a proper answer to Heracross. If Guts has been activated, Heracross can 2HKO or OHKO every Pokemon commonly used in Ubers with just its STAB moves, with the exception of Ho-Oh and Giratina. Stone Edge OHKOes Ho-Oh and provides a more powerful attack against Giratina-O than Megahorn. Sleep Talk turns Heracross into an excellent check to Darkrai, resisting Dark Pulse and Focus Blast while still being able to attack if hit with Dark Void. Once again, keep in mind that Sleep Talk will only work once as long as Heracross is holding a Choice item. Should one not wish to use Heracross as a sleep absorber, Pursuit is a fine choice. With support from Tickle Wobbuffet, Heracross can remove its greatest counter, Giratina. It takes four Tickles for Heracross to OHKO a switching Giratina with Pursuit, and two Tickles if Guts is activated. Speaking of Guts, Heracross sets itself apart from other Pursuit users, such as Scizor and Tyranitar, as not even Will-O-Wisp can save Giratina's life. Night Slash allows Heracross to 2HKO Giratina-O, something that it can't do with a Choice Scarf.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is needed like always, giving Heracross a better chance to OHKO Ho-Oh, Rayquaza, and many other Uber Pokemon with proper prediction. Unlike with Choice Scarf, Lugia fails to wall this set, as Heracross is slower and will pierce Lugia with Megahorn as it eliminates its Flying-type via Roost. Kyogre is, once again, a great partner as it can kill Ho-Oh and weaken Fire-type attacks via Drizzle. With Fire-type attacks and Pokemon weakened and/or eliminated, Heracross will more likely not have to contend with one of its major weaknesses. Since Choice Band Heracross lacks speed, faster powerhouses such as Choice Specs Kyogre, Latios, and Life Orb Dialga can OHKO Heracross with their powerful STAB attacks. Choice Scarf Palkia can take on Kyogre's Water Spout and Surf, and hit back hard with Thunder, Draco Meteor, or Spacial Rend. Palkia can also revenge Latios and moderately weakened Dialga.</p> <p>Heracross should not be the center of a team when using this set. Instead, it should be used merely to help other Pokemon, such as Rayquaza and Groudon, set up instead. After drawing out and killing Lugia with Heracross, these other Pokemon can easily sweep teams with Rock Polish, Swords Dance, or Dragon Dance.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Heracross's most interesting set, and certainly viable if used correctly. The goal is to switch in on something that can't do much, such as Forretress, and proceed to use Substitute. The opponent will likely bring in a much faster Pokemon to break the Substitute, which results in Heracross constantly using Substitute until Salac Berry activates. Assuming Substitute is still intact, Heracross can then Swords Dance and attempt to sweep. Heracross's subbing down to Salac Berry activation also activates the dual effect of Swarm, multiplying Megahorn's power x1.5. Along with STAB, the power of Heracross's Megahorn reaches an effective power level of 270. Follow up with a Swords Dance, then it boosts this number to a whopping 540!</p> <p>Here are some damage calculations to demonstrate Heracross's power:</p> <section><section><h1>Damage Calculations</h1> <ul> <li>+2 Swarm Megahorn vs 32 HP / 0 Def Rayquaza 86.91% - 102.23%</li> <li> <ul> <li>+2 Swarm Megahorn vs 252 HP / 32 Def Groudon 102.72% - 121.29%</li>  </li> <li>+2 Swarm Megahorn vs 252 HP / 64 Def Lugia 104.09% - 122.60%</li> <li>+2 Close Combat vs 224 HP / 0 Def Ho-oh 50.61% - 59.90%</li> </ul> <p>252 Speed EVs allows Heracross to outspeed max Speed, Modest Choice Scarf Kyogre after a Salac Berry boost. However, there are several Pokemon capable of outspeeding Heracross after the boost, namely Choice Scarf Pokemon with equal to or greater than 90 base Speed such as Palkia, Dialga, Shaymin-S, Mewtwo, Jirachi, Darkrai, and Timid Kyogre. After the Substitute is broken, Heracross will have no way of stopping priority attacks. With the prevalence of Groudon and Kyogre in Ubers, a mixed Tyranitar is a phenomenal partner, as the weather will likely change later. Tyranitar can lure in Scizor and Fire Blast to OHKO them, as well as take down Giratina-O with Crunch or Pursuit; Rayquaza also falls victim to Ice Beam. Rayquaza, Scizor, and Giratina-O commonly use priority attacks, making Heracross's job much easier with them eliminated.</p> <p>Wobbuffet, who always pairs well with Heracross, does phenomenally here, trapping and OHKOing most Choice Scarf Pokemon that would outspeed Heracross after a Salac Berry boost.

It has a key Dragon resistance that gives it the ability to check many common Pokemon such as Rayquaza and Groudon that lack Overheat. It's also got a quadruple Grass resistance and a resistance to Flying-type attacks, making Skarmory one of the best Shaymin-S checks around. Additionally, Skarmory is a hard stop to Scizor, as well as Latios and Latias that lack Thunder, Surf, and Hidden Power Fire. Setting up Spikes is a niche for which it competes with Forretress, but Skarmory is arguably better at it thanks to its access to Taunt. The combination of Taunt and Spikes makes Skarmory a decent lead, checking Groudon without a Fire-type attack and Deoxys-S to boot. Regardless of these positive attributes, Forretress is used more because it also has access to Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spin.

You could use Brave Bird so as not be total Taunt bait, but Skarmory already has four moveslot syndrome and will deal little damage to anything. Counter could be used to take advantage of Skarmory's Defense, but Skarmory has better things to do with its time, such as setting up Spikes, and its low HP stat means that it won't do a whole lot of damage with the move. Lastly, Torment could be used, as some Pokemon, such as Giratina-O, only carry one move that hits Skarmory hard; however, it's mainly a wasted moveslot when compared with Roost, Whirlwind, and Spikes. You might see Skarmory's base 140 Defense and want to use it as a physical wall, but it really needs the Special Defense investment to take Draco Meteors.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While Skarmory does check a plethora of Pokemon, there's also a myriad of Pokemon that are a hard stop to it. Calm Mind Arceus-Electric, -Fire, -Ice, -Normal, -Steel, and -Water all often carry moves that rip Skarmory apart (though the last needs rain to do so) and thus do not have to worry about being phazed. Arceus-Ghost and -Grass that carry Flamethrower and mixed Rock Arceus that carry Fire Blast work as well. Giratina-O and Groudon with a Fire-type attack can also break Skarmory. Ho-Oh is yet another Fire-type Pokemon that destroys Skarmory. Rain-boosted special Water-type attacks are too much for Skarmory, so Choice Specs Kyogre and Palkia can drown it. The rare Magnezone can trap and KO Skarmory. If you look at your team and somehow don't have at least one Pokemon that can beat Skarmory, you might want to rethink your team.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>While Skarmory seems to be a Pokemon built for tanking physical hits, its resistances give it the ability to be a decent switch-in to Draco Meteors; thus, its subpar Special Defense is invested into so that it can do this. With that in mind, Skarmory is an excellent check to most of the Dragon-types that dominate the Uber tier. Unfortunately, its Speed is mediocre and far below the Ubers standard of 90, limiting its ability to cripple Pokemon with Toxic and set up Spikes, as well as making it much more difficult to stall with Roost.</p> <p>The first decision for this set is choice of entry hazard. Spikes is preferred, as its limited distribution means that you're unlikely to have anything else on your team to set it up. Additionally, it gives Skarmory something to do while it's on the field instead of sitting around as setup fodder. Stealth Rock is also useful, as it severely hurts some popular Uber Pokemon, such as Lugia and Ho-Oh, but usually you will have something else that can set it up. Plus, not using Spikes means losing out on one of Skarmory's main draws. Roost inhabits the second moveslot because it provides recovery for Skarmory, allowing it to take attacks repeatedly. It is also Skarmory's biggest advantage over Forretress. Whirlwind spreads entry hazard damage and prevents Skarmory from being setup bait. Whirlwind also allows Skarmory to check Calm Mind Arceus formes that lack a super effective Judgment and most Swords Dance Arceus formes. Finally, Toxic is preferred as the last move to break down walls such as Lugia and force Giratina to use Rest, but Taunt is also an option to prevent opposing entry hazards and setup. If you are using Skarmory as a lead, Taunt is the better choice for its utility against common leads, including Groudon and Deoxys-S.</p> <p>The given EV spread brings Skarmory's relatively mediocre special bulk up to acceptable levels while also allowing it to take 2 Outrages from +1 Rayquaza. It might be wise to invest some EVs in Speed if using Taunt, such as 88 EVs and a Timid nature to outrun uninvested base 90s. The difference in bulk is significant, but doing so makes Skarmory a much better lead. Alternatively, you can invest maximum EVs in Special Defense with a Careful nature, but there isn't any large difference in special bulk that makes doing so desirable.</p> <p>If using Skarmory, you're going to want a few different things to take the brunt of attacks that would demolish it. Kyogre makes an excellent partner, as it sets up rain, which dampens Skarmory's Fire-type weakness, and is a great switch-in against most Fire-type attacks itself. Kyogre can also switch into rain-boosted Water-type attacks, and Skarmory has a quadruple resistance to Kyogre's Grass weakness. Additionally, Kyogre can take advantage of the Spikes that Skarmory sets up to weaken its switch-ins and sweep more easily with its mono-attacking Calm Mind set. The two do share an Electric weakness, however, so Dialga is also a great partner. Offensive terrors, such as Mewtwo and Extreme Killer Arceus, are even more threatening when Spikes are in play. Overall, Skarmory isn't difficult to support, as setting up Spikes and resisting Dragon-type attacks are qualities that work excellently on their own.</p> "

  "Kingdra": {
    "overview": "<p>Kingdra's stats may make it seem like it's outclassed by Dragon-types such as Palkia and Rayquaza. However, Kingdra's ability, Swift Swim, puts it in a class of its own. With Kyogre's eternal rain, Kingdra becomes an excellent revenge killer, and either a powerful mixed attacker, or a sweeper that is incredibly difficult to revenge kill. In the rain, Kingdra will outspeed even Choice Scarf Garchomp and Choice Scarf Palkia, and will easily OHKO both with its powerful, STAB Dragon-type attacks. No other Dragon-type is capable of doing this in Ubers, often making Kingdra a deadly surprise for most teams that rely on Choice Scarfed Dragon-type Pokemon to stop sweeps from Rayquaza. Overall, Kingdra is an excellent Pokemon in Ubers, and is the prime candidate to base an Uber rain team around.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Kingdra is capable of using a Choice Specs set in Ubers, which in conjunction with Swift Swim, can deal a huge amount of damage. However, it lacks the sweeping and/or the wallbreaking capabilities the other sets possess due to being restricted by a Choice item. A Choice Band set may be tempting with Waterfall and Outrage, but Kingda's physical move pool is too poor to support such a set. Substitute can be used on any of Kingdra's sets to scout out potential counters and to protect against status, however Kingdra's health will be drained fast if used with Life Orb.</p> <p>Dragon Pulse can be used as a more reliable special Dragon-type attack alongside Draco Meteor if needed. If using Dragon Pulse, make sure you use max Special Attack and a +Special Attack nature, as this will ensure that you will not only OHKO Rayquaza and Garchomp, but also OHKO Palkia after it takes Stealth Rock damage. Toxic can be used to cripple Lugia and Groudon switch-ins. Ice Beam can be used to 2HKO Groudon, but otherwise Draco Meteor is always the better move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Because of Kingdra's Dragon-typing and Speed in the rain, it is extremely difficult to counter in the Uber metagame. A Dialga with max HP, max Special Defense, and a Careful nature is the closest thing to a true Kingdra counter in Ubers. All other Dialga variants will have difficulty switching in, but they will be able to revenge kill Kingdra due to almost never being OHKOed by Kingdra's assaults. Although Choice Scarf Rayquaza cannot switch into Kingdra, it can easily revenge kill it thanks to Air Lock. Specially defensive Groudon will be able to take most of Kingdra's attacks thanks to the sunlight and cripple Kingdra with Thunder Wave. Groudon's sun will make Kingdra much easier to deal with by the rest of your team as well, as Kingdra loses its Speed boost and is walled by common Steel-types such as Scizor.</p> <p>While Kingdra is extremely difficult to revenge kill in the rain, there is a tactic that can be employed to defeat it. Since Kingdra is forced to KO Dragon-type Pokemon with Outrage if it has used Draco Meteor once, a good way to defeat Kingdra is to lure it into Outrage. When lured into Outrage, powerful, Steel-type attackers such as Scizor and Metagross can deal a severe amount of damage to it with their physical attacks. Jirachi in particular can use this time to paralyze Kingdra with Thunder Wave.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>While Kingdra may seem like it's outclassed by Rayquaza, Dragon Dance Kingdra has two very significant advantages over Dragon Dance Rayquaza in Ubers. First of all, Kingdra's typing grants it a neutrality to Ice-type attacks, Stealth Rock, and a resistance to Bullet Punch. Most importantly, the quality that truly makes Kingdra stand out in Ubers is Swift Swim. With only 176 Speed EVs and Kyogre's eternal rain, Kingdra is able to outspeed Choice Scarf Garchomp, the fastest Dragon-type Pokemon commonly seen in Ubers. After a Dragon Dance, Kingdra will easily outspeed every single Pokemon in the Uber metagame.</p> <p>Waterfall is Kingdra's main STAB attack, which, thanks to Kyogre's rain, becomes just as powerful as Outrage. Outrage complements Waterfall extremely well, allowing Kingdra to have nearly perfect type coverage (with only Shedinja not being hit at least neutrally). Even before a Dragon Dance, Waterfall is a useful move for revenge killing several threats simply because this Kingdra has a Speed stat of 500 in the rain. For instance, Darkrai has around a 92% chance of being OHKOed by an unboosted Waterfall after it takes Stealth Rock damage. While Kingdra is not as powerful as Rayquaza, its boosted Waterfalls and Outrages will still deal a massive amount of damage. For example, a +1 Outrage will always OHKO max HP Kyogre after it takes Stealth Rock damage, while a +1 Waterfall in the rain or Outrage will easily OHKO Mewtwo. The last slot is best occupied by Draco Meteor for two reasons: Draco Meteor will deal over 50% to most Groudon and Dialga switch-ins (barring specially defensive Dialga), meaning that next time Kingdra gets time to set up, Groudon will often be unable to switch in and take control of the weather without sacrificing itself, and Dialga that are not specially defensive will often be KOed by Outrage after being hit by Draco Meteor. Draco Meteor will also have enough power to OHKO Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Palkia, meaning that Kingdra can destroy them without getting locked into Outrage. Yawn is a reasonable option in the last slot if Groudon is not a problem for your team. Yawn can potentially put your opponent's Kingdra check to sleep, or cause a switch that Kingdra can take advantage of by using Dragon Dance. When using Yawn over Draco Meteor, use an Adamant nature and relocate the 80 Special Attack EVs, because Kingdra will no longer be a mixed attacker.</p> <p>While even defensive Groudon may sometimes be 2HKOed by a +1 Outrage, it can switch in as Kingdra attempts to set up, and either cripple Kingdra with Thunder Wave, or deal a massive amount of damage with Dragon Claw or Earthquake (Dragon Claw will almost always OHKO Kingdra if Groudon holds a Life Orb). Additionally, Groudon's sunlight will ruin both Waterfall's power and Kingdra's Swift Swim. Although Lugia is usually 2HKOed by a +1 Waterfall or Outrage, it can invest in more Defense EVs and then switch in on either Dragon Dance or Draco Meteor. Lugia can then use Reflect to survive the next Waterfall or Outrage, and stall Kingdra with Roost. Lugia can even use Whirlwind to foil any of Kingdra's attempts to set up on it. If Dialga manages to switch into Dragon Dance, or is specially defensive and does not switch in on Outrage, it will barely survive Kingdra's assaults (a Dialga with no EVs in HP and Defense will take around 85%-100% from a +1 Outrage), while Kingdra will be OHKOed by one of Dialga's STAB Dragon-type attacks.</p> <p>Mixed Rayquaza makes an excellent teammate for Dragon Dance Kingdra. It will often lure in Groudon and Bold Lugia, and then 2HKO most Groudon with Draco Meteor, and 2HKO Lugia with Draco Meteor after it takes Stealth Rock damage. Choice Scarf Dialga will often switch in to mixed Rayquaza, expecting the Swords Dance set, only to be OHKOed by Draco Meteor after taking Stealth Rock damage. Support Dialga will also work well with Dragon Dance Kingdra for several reasons: Dialga can set up the vital Stealth Rock that allows Kingdra to gain several KOs. Dialga also lures in both Groudon and Lugia when holding Leftovers, meaning that Dialga is often able to cripple either of them with Toxic. Dialga's Draco Meteor can put most Groudon into the KO range of Kingdra's Draco Meteor or boosted Outrage. Like most setup sweepers, Kingdra will appreciate Wobbuffet's support. Wobbuffet can Encore a Fire- or Water-type attack, a support move, or status move (and then use Safeguard) to allow Kingdra to have a free turn to use Dragon Dance. Wobbuffet can also revenge kill any Dialga that is restricted by Choice Scarf. Finally, Tickle Wobbuffet can be paired with a Pursuit user (such as Metagross or Scizor) to defeat Lugia. Scizor on its own makes a great teammate for Dragon Dance Kingdra due to its ability to function as a Dialga lure. If Choice Band Scizor uses Superpower as max HP Dialga switches in, it will have a 79% chance of being OHKOed after taking Stealth Rock damage. Additionally, Choice Band Scizor's U-turn will do enough damage to minimum HP Dialga to put it into the KO range of a +1 Kingdra's Outrage. Mewtwo can switch into Lugia, and use Taunt and Calm Mind to set up on it, while Darkrai can put Lugia to sleep with Dark Void, and threaten to set up a sweep with Nasty Plot.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Kingdra's Speed in the rain and Life Orb, Kingdra can easily become a powerful mixed attacker and revenge killer in one set. The most important choice to make is between using Surf or Hydro Pump. Surf is weaker than Hydro Pump, but the perfect accuracy often makes up for the power loss. In the rain, Surf will still do a massive amount of damage to any Pokemon who does not resist it. For example, Surf will OHKO Darkrai, while both Lugia and Calm Wobbuffet are 2HKOed when taking Stealth Rock damage and Leftovers recovery into account. Hydro Pump trades the reliable 100% accuracy for more power, which can be helpful in certain situations. For instance, offensive Mewtwo is always OHKOed by Hydro Pump (compared to Surf's approximately 66% chance of achieving the same after Stealth Rock damage), and will also always 2HKO Lugia regardless of any entry hazards. Hydro Pump has a chance of putting specially defensive Groudon into the KO range of Draco Meteor after it takes Stealth Rock damage; something that Surf can never do. Aside from its poor accuracy, Hydro Pump also only has 8PP, meaning that it will run out fast in a metagame infested with such a high number of Pokemon with Pressure. Because of these setbacks, make sure you only use Hydro Pump over Surf if your team needs it.</p> <p>Draco Meteor is Kingdra's most powerful attack against Pokemon who resist its STAB Water-type attacks, and will do almost as much damage as Surf in the rain! Draco Meteor will always OHKO every Dragon-type Pokemon who is weak to it with the exceptions of Giratina (who is OHKOed after taking Stealth Rock damage unless it is specially defensive), and Latias. Draco Meteor will also 2HKO most Groudon switch-ins after Stealth Rock damage, allowing your team to effectively take control of the weather. While Outrage may not pack as much of a punch as it did on the Dragon Dance set, it is still able to OHKO Latias, 2HKO Blissey, and 2HKO max HP Kyogre after it takes Stealth Rock damage. Finally, Waterfall's main purpose is to 2HKO Blissey in the rain, and to always 2HKO Tyranitar.</p> <p>Because mixed Kingdra does not have Dragon Dance, it will have issues with several Pokemon who have the potential to outspeed it, even in the rain. Although Rayquaza can only switch into Kingdra's Water-type assaults, it can also outspeed and revenge kill Kingdra thanks to Air Lock and powerful, STAB Dragon-type attacks. Although none of them can switch into Kingdra's attacks, fast Choice Scarf users such as Darkrai, Shaymin-S, and Mewtwo are capable of outspeeding Kingdra in the rain. While none of them OHKO Kingdra, Shaymin-S can flinch it with Air Slash or deal a massive amount of damage with Seed Flare. On the other hand, Darkrai can put Kingdra to sleep with Dark Void, and Mewtwo can either deal a massive amount of damage to it with Thunder, or sacrifice itself to OHKO Kingdra with Self-Destruct. Choice Scarf Jirachi is the best possible answer to Rayquaza, thanks to its Dragon-type and Normal-type resists, Ice Punch, and the ability to even outspeed Dragon Dance Rayquaza. Choice Scarf Metagross can take care of Rayquaza in a similar fashion, but has the bonus of being able to switch into Shaymin-S's Seed Flare without the fear of a Special Defense drop thanks to Clear Body. A Kyogre with Sleep Talk makes an excellent switch into Choice Scarf Darkrai's Dark Void, while Scizor can handle Darkrai's Dark Pulses and Shaymin-S's Seed Flares. Dialga can take not only Shaymin-S's Seed Flare, but it can also switch into Mewtwo's Self-Destruct and Thunder with ease thanks to its resistances. Finally, Wobbuffet can revenge kill both Choice Scarf Shaymin-S and Choice Scarf Mewtwo at certain points in the match.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Even in the Uber tier, there is no Pokemon who can do Blissey's job better. Although there are several Pokemon who can break through Blissey's Special Defenses in Ubers, don't let that discourage you from using Blissey, as it is still the best general special wall in the Ubers metagame. Almost any team will appreciate Blissey's ability to sponge special assaults, especially stall teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Blissey has a bundle of other support moves for use in Ubers. She is one of the few usable Pokemon in Ubers who has access to Stealth Rock. While Blissey is often better off using other support moves besides Stealth Rock, it is a viable move if no other Pokemon on your team can set it up. Light Screen may seem like an odd choice on Blissey, but it can be helpful for not only support the rest of your team, but will also make sure that Choice Specs Kyogre will no longer be able to 2HKO Blissey while Light Screen lasts. Blissey can use Sing to put would be counters to sleep, but note that Sing only has a 55% chance of hitting the opponent. Snatch can be used to steal Reflects, Light Screens, stat ups, and other support moves, but many users of such moves such as Mewtwo can easily use Taunt to shut down that strategy, in addition to Blissey often being better off using Calm Mind herself rather then stealing Calm Minds. Rest is almost always an inferior option to Soft-Boiled or Wish, but it can work well with Natural Cure, allowing Blissey to be relativity unharmed by Toxic Spikes, and will allow Blissey to outstall opposing Blissey. Blissey can use Block to trap Wobbuffet switch-ins, and then use Toxic to slowly stall Wobbuffet to death. Copycat may seem like a strange option on Blissey, but it can be useful in certain situations. For example, it can allow Blissey to use Spikes or Toxic Spikes on Forretress as it uses them. If Forretress attempts to Rapid Spin, Blissey can either roast it with Flamethrower (provided that its sunny), or Copycat Rapid Spin to get rid of the opponents entry hazards. Copycat can also allow Blissey to defeat Calm Mind Giratina-O and Calm Mind Kyogre that lack Rest. Note, however, that Copycat is illegal with Seismic Toss and Wish.</p> <p>Charm can be used to soften physical attackers attempting to prey on Blissey after a switch-in. Due to Charm, mixed Palkia (barring a Focus Punch) and Dialga will no longer be able to get past Blissey beyond scoring a critical hit, while Groudon and Garchomp will only have a small chance to 2HKO Blissey with a Choice Banded Earthquake and Outrage respectively. Note that both Garchomp and Groudon have access to Swords Dance, thus it is best to still have Pokemon who can defeat both. While an Adamant Life Orb Rayquaza can still 2HKO Blissey with Outrage after being hit by Charm, she can OHKO Rayquaza with Ice Beam after it switches into Stealth Rock and Charm (provided she has 84 SpA EVs), allowing Blissey to defeat a Pokemon by whom she is normally greatly troubled. Charm also has the potential to cause a large amount of switches, thus it is best to pair Charm Blissey with users of entry hazards. Note that both Wish and Seismic Toss are illegal to use with Charm.</p> <p>Blissey has access to Gravity. Gravity will allow both Groudon and Garchomp to freely use Earthquake and a 100% accurate Stone Edge, as Gravity eliminates the immunity Flying-type Pokemon and Pokemon with the Levitate ability for five turns. Gravity will also eliminate the immunity floating Pokemon have to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, meaning that Gravity Blissey will greatly benefit Forretress and Skarmory's Spikes (and Toxic Spikes in Forretress' case) laying abilities. Finally, Gravity will lower the evasion of all Pokemon by 2 stages, meaning that any move that has at least 60% accuracy will always hit. This is especially great for Darkrai, who must often use the 70% accurate Focus Blast and the 80% accurate Dark Void. Calm Mind Mewtwo with Life Orb will also enjoy the effects of Gravity, as it allows Life Orb Mewtwo to safely use Focus Blast, which will always 2HKO opposing Blissey after one use of Calm Mind. Garchomp not only benefits from an Earthquake that hits all Pokemon, it also enjoys the evasion cut as well. This is because the usually unreliable Dragon Rush becomes viable on Garchomp under Gravity, meaning that it will have access to a STAB 100 Base Power Dragon-type attack that has a 20% chance to flinch. Blissey's Sing will also hit 92% of the time under Gravity. There is one potentially fatal flaw with Gravity, and it is that the opponent can also take advantage of Gravity's effects. This will make Groudon and Garchomp particularly difficult to handle, thus it is best to either destroy them before using Gravity.</p> <p>Blissey has some alternate attacks at its disposal that can be useful in certain situations. When under the support of Groudon's everlasting sun, Flamethrower becomes a viable option to KO or cripple several common Steel-types that may switch into Blissey. Forretress is always OHKOed by Flamethrower after Stealth Rock, while only extremely specially defensive Scizor will survive Flamethrower after Stealth Rock damage. Blissey's Flamethrower will do a massive 76% - 90% to Lucario in the sun, while Metagross is always 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage. Grass Knot may normally be an inferior option to Thunder on Calm Mind , but it has two main selling points. Grass Knot is always a 100% accurate attack, regardless of the weather, which is particularly useful considering the fact that many Ubers are heavy enough to be hit by a 120 Base Power Grass Knot. Secondly, Groudon is hit quite hard by it. Finally, Counter can be a good option on Blissey, even in Ubers. Several Pokemon, such as Palkia and Dialga, will use mixed sets just to defeat Blissey. If Blissey predicts a physical attack from either of them, and uses Counter, Palkia and Dialga are sure to be KOed. Also, note that defensive Groudon, Choice Scarf Garchomp, and Scizor that lack Superpower are also unable to OHKO Blissey, meaning that Blissey will be able to gain a surprise kill on them if she is healthy.</p> <p>In the Uber tier, Blissey should use 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature on all sets without Ice Beam, as Blissey needs to be extra durable to take the powerful assaults of Ubers. If using Ice Beam, use the EV spread of 252 Def / 84 SpA / 172 SpD, because this will allow Blissey to OHKO a 0 HP / 4 SpD Rayquaza 100% of the time after it switches into Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>In the Uber tier, Bulk Up Dialga is, without a doubt, the best Blissey counter. It is immune to Toxic and can easily set up on Blissey. Powerful physical attackers such as Garchomp, Groudon, and Rayquaza can make Blissey's life a living hell. However, Ice Beam will do massive damage to Garchomp and Rayquaza and none of them will like being hit by Toxic.</p> <p>Many Pokemon in the Uber tier can surprise Blissey with mixed attacking sets, such as Mewtwo, Darkrai, Dialga, Palkia and Giratina-O. Dialga in particular can be a problem, as it is immune to Toxic.</p> <p>If Blissey lacks Calm Mind or Psych Up, Kyogre and Giratina can use a combination of Sleep Talk, Rest, and Calm Mind to easily set up on Blissey. Kyogre, Mewtwo, and Giratina-O can also use Substitute and Calm Mind to beat her. In the rain, Manaphy can easily set up Tail Glow on non-Calm Mind Blissey and 2HKO it with a +2 Surf. Choice Specs Kyogre also has the capability of 2HKOing Blissey with Water Spout.</p> <p>Wobbuffet can switch into Blissey and use Tickle several times to lower its Defense. After this, Blissey will be KOed by Pursuit from Scizor or Tyranitar. Wobbuffet can also use Encore on Blissey and switch in a sweeper such as Lucario or Giratina-O to take advantage of the free set up time.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Soft-Boiled",
        "description": "<p>This set is very similar to Wish Blissey, but it forgoes the supportive nature of Wish and Protect in exchange for Soft-Boiled, which frees up an extra moveslot for Blissey. The best two moves for this moveslot are Ice Beam or Aromatherapy. With the EV spread above, Blissey's Ice Beam is able to OHKO Rayquaza with 4 Special Defense EVs 100% of the time after it takes Stealth Rock damage, thus making Blissey an effective Rayquaza lure.</p> <p>Aromatherapy can be especially useful in Ubers for a number of reasons. Thunder is one of the most common moves used in the Uber tier, and with it comes a 30% chance of paralysis which can ruin the many sweepers of the tier. Darkrai is also a huge threat in Ubers, and can often cripple a Pokemon for the entire match with Dark Void due to the fast paced nature of Ubers. With that being said, many of Aromatherapy Blissey's best teammates are powerful or game changing Pokemon who are very vulnerable to status effects. A good example of this is Wobbuffet. When Wobbuffet is using Encore to either destroy a wall with the Tickle + Pursuit user combination, or just trying to set up a sweeper, Wobbuffet will often get hit by Toxic or Will-O-Wisp, cutting down its survivability. Blissey's Aromatherapy can remove Wobbuffet's status affliction, allowing Wobbuffet to do its job of removing Choice Scarf Pokemon more easily. Another good teammate is a Quiet mixed Dialga. While mixed Dialga will easily destroy Giratina with Draco Meteor, Giratina can use Will-O-Wisp to destroy Dialga's chances of breaking through Latias and Blissey. With your own Blissey's Aromatherapy, Dialga can once again be a powerful wallbreaker. Finally, Lugia works very well with this particular Blissey. This is because Lugia, when trying to beat Groudon, can often be hit by Thunder Wave and Toxic, meaning it will be unable to harm the team with the combination of Whirlwind and entry hazards for much longer. Thanks to Blissey's Aromatherapy, Lugia can once again wear down teams with Whirlwind. Generally, Aromatherapy Blissey does very well with sweepers that can be crippled by Paralysis and Burn.</p> <p>When using Blissey in Ubers, Forretress should always be considered for the purpose of laying down Toxic Spikes and Spikes. This is because Blissey will force a lot of switches on the opponent's side due to many Uber Pokemon focusing on special attacks. Toxic Spikes in particular are a huge help to Blissey, as they will wear down Pokemon such as Choice Specs Kyogre, Mewtwo, Garchomp, and Groudon; all of which are problems for Blissey. Stealth Rock can also be useful for the same reasons. Although Blissey can use Stealth Rock herself, it is better to have other Pokemon do this for her. Dialga and Groudon are good examples of this. Deoxys-S and Deoxys-D can also use Spikes that Blissey can benefit from. This can be useful because once Spikes and Stealth Rock are laid, Choice Specs Kyogre can no longer break through Blissey.</p> <p>Many teams rely on revenge killing their opponents with powerful special attacks in order to deal with certain threats. For example, many teams count on Choice Scarf Palkia to OHKO Darkrai with Draco Meteor. Blissey can work very well with Darkrai in this case. She can easily switch into the incoming Draco Meteor and use the time to either status the next switch-in or switch to another Pokemon who takes advantage of an incoming physical attacker . In a similar manner, Blissey can also partner well with Garchomp, Rayquaza, and Groudon. Many teams use Lugia to stop all three, and Blissey has no problems with switching into Lugia's Ice Beam. Blissey can then threaten to cripple it or the next switch-in with Toxic.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Wish Support",
        "description": "<p>Even with incredible walls such as Giratina and Lugia in the Uber tier, Blissey is still the number one special wall to use. Blissey is the only Pokemon in Ubers that can wall such a wide variety of special threats, such as Latias, Latios (as long as it lacks Refresh or Safeguard), Palkia, Dialga (provided they aren't mixed), and Calm Mind Lugia. As far as attacking options go, Seismic Toss is generally the most reliable as it will do a decent amount of damage to Pokemon like Kyogre and Latias who would otherwise laugh at Ice Beam. Seismic Toss also allows Blissey to have a better chance of beating Mewtwo that have Calm Mind and Taunt, which Ice Beam can not accomplish. Ice Beam is still a good option though, as three common Blissey switch-ins (Groudon, Garchomp, and Rayquaza) are hit super effectively by it. With 84 SpA EVs, Garchomp takes a massive 76.19% - 90.76% from Ice Beam when it switches in, while a 0 HP / 4 SpD Rayquaza will be OHKOed after switching into Stealth Rock. In emergencies, you can leave Blissey in on Rayquaza, because the opponent may attempt to set up a Dragon Dance or Swords Dance. When using Seismic Toss, use the EV spread 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD, as there is no reason to invest in Special Attack when using it. Toxic complements this set well, as the combination of Protect and Wish can very easily stall Pokemon to death. Toxic is a good choice to use if you predict the opponent is going to switch, as several threats to Blissey (Kyogre, Darkrai, and Giratina-O) become much easier to handle when badly poisoned. Thunder Wave can be used over Toxic, but make sure you use it only with Seismic Toss. This is because without Seismic Toss or Toxic, Latias can set up Calm Minds with no problem and eventually KO Blissey. Although not recommended due to moveslot competition, Heal Bell can be used over Protect if your team needs both a status reliever and a user of Wish.</p> <p>Blissey is one of the few viable Wish passers in the Uber tier, thus many good teammates for Blissey are simply Pokemon who greatly appreciate Wish. A perfect example of this is Choice Specs Kyogre. While Choice Specs Kyogre is an insanely powerful wallbreaker, Water Spout's power will unfortunately decrease as Kyogre's HP diminishes. With Blissey's Wish, Kyogre can have a chance to have an extremely powerful Water Spout again. In a similar manner, Choice Scarf Kyogre will also love Wish. Wobbuffet is another Pokemon who greatly benefits from Wish support. It, while being bulky, will usually only be able to revenge kill one Pokemon per match. With Blissey's Wish, Wobbuffet will be able to stay in battle for a much longer period of time, thus making it much more difficult for the opponent to handle. Another Pokemon who benefits from Blissey's Wish is Forretress. This will allow Forretress to take more powerful hits from the likes of Garchomp, allowing it to have more time to set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Finally, a defensive support Groudon will have a much easier time dealing with Lucario and Rayquaza thanks to Blissey's Wish support; as well as support Dialga having an easier time dealing with Palkia and Kyogre.</p> <p>While Blissey may still be the queen of special walling in Ubers, some of the special attackers of Ubers are so powerful that they can break through her. A good example of this is Kyogre, which has several sets that can make Blissey run for cover. Choice Specs Kyogre is so absurdly powerful that it can 2HKO Blissey with Water Spout, as long as it has at least 80% of its health. Kyogre can also use 252 HP EVs to make 101 HP Substitutes, which means that it can set up Calm Mind while Blissey is forced to use Seismic Toss twice to break the Substitutes. After three Calm Minds, a Modest Kyogre will always 2HKO Blissey with Surf, even when accounting for Leftovers recovery. Finally, Kyogre may carry the combination of Sleep Talk and Rest to either set up Calm Mind on Blissey or to outstall her. To solve the problems Blissey has with Kyogre, Latias should always be considered. Latias can switch into Choice Specs Kyogre's Water Spout, and use Thunder to weaken its power by reducing Kyogre's HP. Latias can use Calm Mind as the other Kyogre variants attempt to set up, and will usually beat it. The combination of Latias and Blissey will wall every single Kyogre set, making Latias an excellent teammate for Wish Blissey. Palkia is another good option if you only need a Pokemon to beat Choice Specs Kyogre. Something to note is that once Kyogre has switched into Stealth Rock twice, it will no longer be able to 2HKO Blissey with a Choice Specs Water Spout, thus Blissey will be able to wall it with ease as long as there are no critical hits. Manaphy can also cause serious issues for Blissey when it's raining. It will be immune to status and can set up Tail Glow or Rest off the damage it has taken and wake up immediately afterwards, thanks to its ability, Hydration. After two Tail Glows and Life Orb, Manaphy will always 2HKO Blissey with Surf. To beat Manaphy, Latias once again makes an excellent teammate, as it OHKOes it with Thunder after Stealth Rock and will win a Calm Mind war if Manaphy attempts that.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Darkrai can cause some serious problems for Blissey. After one use of Nasty Plot, Darkrai will 2HKO Blissey with Focus Blast. To make matters even worse, Darkrai can carry Substitute to block Thunder Wave and Toxic. It can also put Blissey to sleep with Dark Void, not only giving it the opportunity to set up, but also dealing damage with its ability, Bad Dreams. Generally, the best way to deal with Darkrai is to predict a Dark Void and send in a sleep absorber (usually carrying Sleep Talk, but this is not required). Then, switch to a Pokemon who can revenge kill Darkrai (such as Life Orb Mewtwo, Choice Scarf Palkia, Choice Specs Shaymin-S, etc.). Something to note is if a Choice Scarf Darkrai switches into Blissey, it is likely that it is carrying Trick, thus it is best to switch to a Choice Scarf user of your own or a Pokemon who does not mind being Tricked with a Choice Scarf.</p> <p>Mewtwo can also pose a problem for Blissey, due to Taunt and Substitute. Mewtwo can make 101 HP Substitutes and use Calm Mind to beat Blissey in a similar way Kyogre can. It also has the option of using Taunt and Recover to PP stall Blissey, thanks to Pressure. In a similar manner, Mew can Taunt Blissey and use the time to set up and Baton Pass to a powerful Pokemon such as Groudon. To stop Substitute Mewtwo and Baton Pass Mew, Scizor makes an excellent choice. Mewtwo can be hit hard by Pursuit even if it stays in, while Mew will get its Reflect and Light Screen broken by Brick Break and be OHKOed by U-turn. Choice Specs Kyogre also works well, as it can switch into a defensive Mewtwo with ease and threaten to OHKO with Water Spout, while Mew will take massive damage.</p> <p>Another problem for Blissey is Giratina as it can easily outstall Blissey due to its Pressure ability and Ghost-typing. Giratina can also use a combination of Sleep Talk, Rest, and Calm Mind to set up on Blissey. Although it's very rare, Latias and Latios can beat Blissey in a similar manner with Calm Mind, Recover, and either Refresh or Safeguard. Generally, the best answer to Giratina is Bulk Up Dialga. Dialga can easily set up Bulk Up as Giratina uses Will-O-Wisp and then use Rest to restore its health. After three uses of Bulk Up, Dialga will always OHKO Giratina with Outrage. For Calm Mind Giratina, Tyranitar can switch in and cause a serious amount of damage with a Choice Banded Crunch. For Latias and Latios, Tyranitar, Scizor, and Metagross can penetrate them with Pursuit or their powerful STAB attacks.</p> <p>If Giratina-O switches in on any move but Thunder Wave or Toxic, it can pose a serious threat to not only Blissey, but also to the rest of the team. Blissey will have a difficult time breaking Giratina-O's Substitutes with Ice Beam. If it uses Calm Mind, Blissey will no longer be able to break Giratina-O's Substitute, meaning that Giratina-O can continue to set up Calm Mind. After four uses of Calm Mind, Giratina-O is able to 2HKO Blissey with Dragon Pulse, and then threaten to sweep the rest of your team. To solve this issue, it is advisable to use a Careful Forretress with Light Screen and Payback. Forretress can switch into Giratina-O, use Light Screen to minimize the damage it takes, and then 4HKO Giratina-O with Payback. It is also a huge help to Blissey, due to Toxic Spikes. When Forretress sets up two layers of Toxic Spikes, several big threats to Blissey, such as Darkrai, Choice Specs Kyogre, and Substitute Mewtwo, will become much easier to handle due to the constant damage from poison. If Forretress does not fit on your team, it is best to use Tyranitar, whose combination of Crunch and Sand Stream will make Giratina-O's life short.</p> <p>If Shaymin-S is using a Modest nature and Choice Specs, it can 2HKO Blissey with Seed Flare if it gets a Special Defense drop. Choice Scarf Dialga, Choice Scarf Heatran, Choice Scarf Jirachi, and Choice Scarf Metagross are capable of switching into a Choice Specs Seed Flare, and can OHKO Shaymin-S with Draco Meteor (Dialga), Fire Blast (Dialga and Heatran), or Ice Punch (Jirachi and Metagross). Be warned, Choice Scarf Jirachi and Choice Scarf Metagross will still take a significant amount of damage from repeated switch-ins to Seed Flare, despite their resistance. Skarmory can take a Seed Flare due to its 4x resistance, and Whirlwind Shaymin-S away. Choice Band Scizor can also switch into Seed Flare, and threaten to 2HKO it with Bullet Punch. Latias and Lugia can survive two Seed Flares (although it will do a severe amount of damage to both if it gets a Special Defense drop), and threaten to OHKO Shaymin-S with Dragon Pulse and Ice Beam respectively after taking Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>While Leftovers is generally the preferred option, Shed Shell is a very viable alternative in Ubers because of Wobbuffet. Wobbuffet can switch into Blissey, trap it, and use a combination of Tickle and Encore several times. After Wobbuffet is done Tickling Blissey, the opponent can switch to Scizor or Tyranitar to eliminate Blissey with Pursuit. Due to Wobbuffet's ability, Shadow Tag, this is completely unavoidable without the use of Shed Shell. Blissey can also become set up bait for Wobbuffet, which is very undesirable with the powerful sweepers roaming around in the Uber tier.</p> "

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>With a few adjustments, Calm Mind Blissey can work very well in Ubers. Once again, Blissey should use a Calm Nature with an EV spread of 252 Def / 84 SpA / 172 SpD to OHKO Rayquaza with Ice Beam after it switches into Stealth Rock. Thunder should also be used in place of Thunderbolt, mainly due to its use with the rain support Kyogre gives Blissey, making Thunder 100% accurate, and a powerful attack that has a 30% chance to induce paralysis. While Serene Grace is most certainly a worthy option (especially with a 60% chance of paralysis with Thunder), Natural Cure is usually preferred because without it, Blissey will be crippled by Toxic.</p> <p>One of the biggest selling points of Calm Mind Blissey in Ubers is the ability to beat certain threats that Wish Blissey and Aromatherapy Blissey would normally lose to. For example, Calm Mind Blissey can boost against Giratina-O and eventually destroy it with Ice Beam. Another good example is Choice Specs Kyogre. If Kyogre switches on Blissey as it uses Calm Mind, Kyogre will be 2HKOed by Thunder after Stealth Rock. Thus, Kyogre will no longer pose a threat to Blissey with its weakened Water Spout. It will also beat Calm Mind and Substitute Kyogre by Calm Minding along with it, while Blissey being able to easily recover its health and beat Kyogre with Thunder. Giratina that lack Calm Mind are also beaten by Calm Mind Blissey, because Giratina's Dragon Claw will only do 31% max to Blissey (even Outrage only does 46% maximum). However, Blissey requires three Calm Minds to 2HKO a 248 HP / 8 SpD Giratina. If Manaphy switches in on Blissey it will also lose. This is because Blissey can use Calm Mind as Manaphy sets up Tail Glow. Even a +6 Manaphy will be unable to 2HKO Blissey with Surf in the rain after Blissey has used Calm Mind three times. Meanwhile, a +3 Blissey will be able to OHKO Manaphy with Thunder. Substitute Mewtwo with Calm Mind and Latias or Latios with Calm Mind and Refresh or Safeguard will lose to Blissey in a way like Calm Mind Kyogre.</p> <p>Calm Mind Blissey will struggle with mono-attacking Kyogre and Giratina, as they will be able to outstall Blissey unless it gets a critical hit. Additionally, any Pokemon who has Roar or Whirlwind along with Calm Mind can phaze Blissey away, and threaten to sweep. The best example of this is Calm Mind Lugia. To foil Kyogre's plans, once again Latias is easily the best answer, as Kyogre will do little damage to Latias with Surf, while Latias has no problems setting up Calm Mind on it. For Calm Mind Giratina, Bulk Up Dialga can switch in. While a +4 Dragon Pulse will do massive damage to Dialga, a +3 Outrage will always OHKO Giratina. Choice Band Dialga can also beat it with Outrage. Choice Band Tyranitar will also receive minimal damage thanks to the Special Defense boost Sand Stream grants it, and can inflict large amounts of damage to Giratina with a Choice Banded Crunch. Tyranitar can also Taunt both Lugia and Giratina and threaten to set up a sweep with Dragon Dance. Support Dialga can also take care of Calm Mind Lugia by crippling it with Toxic. Finally, Mewtwo that have Taunt and Calm Mind can easily set up on Blissey. Metagross and Scizor can usually deal with this variant of Mewtwo, as they often lack Fire attacks.</p> <p>Psych Up can go over Calm Mind and has several pros and cons. With Psych Up, Blissey can copy stat boosts from Kyogre or Latias that have gotten a large amount of Calm Minds and stop their sweep. However, this comes at the cost of losing to Choice Specs Kyogre, Giratina, and Tail Glow Manaphy in the rain. To beat Kyogre and Manaphy, Latias is once again the best choice, while Bulk Up Dialga or Choice Specs Dialga will annihilate Giratina. As always, Shed Shell is a very viable option as it allows Blissey to escape death by Wobbuffet.</p> "

  "Lugia": {
    "overview": "<p>Lugia is undoubtedly one of the sturdiest physical walls in the game, but is actually numerically stronger special defensively even with the standard spread. This results in a very evenly rounded wall that can take almost any attack; it's extremely difficult to OHKO something with a 106/130/154 defensive layout. Lugia's good 110 base Speed is also higher than that of many Ubers, including Rayquaza, Ho-Oh, Palkia, Groudon, and Kyogre without Choice Scarf.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rest + Sleep Talk is a potential replacement for Roost, because Roost leaves Lugia open to Toxic; overall, though, it is far less efficient, and with Rest and Sleep Talk, Lugia loses to Groudon. Safeguard and Substitute protect Lugia from status altogether and could be nice on the special attacking set. Aeroblast is a very powerful STAB attack, but won't hurt that much from Lugia's inferior (by Uber standards) 90 base Special Attack, and has very low PP, which is wasted further by Pressure from various Ubers. A gimmicky Choice Band set could work, with the main attacks being Punishment and Avalanche, but Lugia's superior defensive stats indicate that walling threats is generally more common, and at the very least, you should stick to special attacks, which can be boosted by Calm Mind. Thunder Wave deserves mention on Lugia's sets, as it works well with Lugia's high base 110 Speed, so it can cripple many offensive threats, almost destroying any chance of a sweep. However, it is not always the best option, as some of the more common threats for Lugia to handle include Garchomp and Groudon, both of whom are immune to Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Earth Power can also find a place on the Trick set to better handle Dialga, Tyranitar, and Metagross. However, you are often better off just crippling Tyranitar and Metagross by burdening them with a Choice Specs via Trick. Aeroblast can work as a filler option in the final slot of the Trick set as well. However, because of the low PP and the fact it doesn't hit any of the Uber metagame for super effective damage means you'll often be disappointed. Weather Ball allows Lugia to OHKO Forretress in sunlight, and deal a decent amount to it in rain.</p> <p>Since Lugia falls prey to Wobbuffet quite easily, it is viable to use Shed Shell with it. Wobbuffet can abuse Lugia's slightly lower Special Attack by using Encore on a weaker attack, or Encoring a set up/status move to start a potentially devastating sweep. It can also use Tickle to lower Lugia's Defense, making it bait for Pursuit-users like Tyranitar and Scizor. Thus, a way to escape Wobbuffet's grasp should be considered when possible. The drawback of course is that Lugia loses its passive Leftovers recovery, which not only slows its recovery, but also tips your opponent off that Lugia is using something abnormal.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Lugia can't do anything against Pokemon with Taunt, as its attacks aren't very powerful without any boosts. Calm Mind Mewtwo rips Lugia to shreds, while Mew can set up and Baton Pass away. Darkrai can even put Lugia to sleep and smash it with Nasty Plot boosted STAB super effective Dark Pulses. Toxic is also very debilitating against Lugia without Rest, so a stalling Dialga will beat it.</p> <p>Calm Mind Kyogre beats Calm Mind Lugia when Lugia is without Thunder through attrition; a six-stage boosted Ice Beam will only do 32% at maximum to a Kyogre, even without HP or Special Defense EV investment.</p> <p>Tyranitar is one of the very few Pokemon who can conquer Lugia completely, by using sheer force. A Choice Band boosted maximum Attack Stone Edge has an 86% chance of OHKOing the standard Lugia, with Sandstorm in effect, while Pursuit chases down fleeing Lugia, reducing its health to the extent that any reasonable attack will kill it. However, using Stone Edge may be risky, as Roost negates the Rock-type weakness and Pressure eats away at Stone Edge's low PP. Even if it has a Reflect up, Lugia can't take repeated Crunches, because Tyranitar will eventually inflict enough Defense drops to knock Lugia out. However, if those Defense drops do not come in quickly enough, Tyranitar may succumb to repeated Toxic damage.</p> ",

        "name": "Great Wall",
        "description": "<p>Lugia has been and still is one of the most reliable walls in the Uber metagame. While Giratina gives it competition, it does sport several advantages, which it should utilize as much as possible. First and most importantly, it receives an immediate recovery move in Roost and therefore isn't forced to use the less efficient Rest and Sleep Talk. It also doesn't have a weakness to Dragon-type attacks, allowing it to pseudo-haze Latias, Latios, and occasionally Rayquaza, without too many problems. Additionally, it is much faster and can use Ice Beam, which is generally a very effective move in Ubers.</p> <p>Lugia is, above all else, a counter for physical Pokemon such as Groudon and Metagross; both Roost and Reflect aid its mission, with Roost as the critical recovery move and Reflect slicing physical damage in half. Whirlwind is another move geared towards stopping physical attackers. While Lugia is sturdy enough to take 72%-85% from even a Choice Band Groudon's Stone Edge, it can't keep up with a Choice Band Metagross's Meteor Mash or Life Orb Rayquaza's Outrage that is boosted multiple times. Therefore, it needs to remove the boosts by forcing the offending Pokemon to switch out. If used after one's own Forretress has set down Spikes or Stealth Rock, Whirlwind also works to inflict some residual damage upon the opponent.</p> <p>As is often the case, the fourth slot involves a more complicated decision. For Lugia, viable options there include Toxic, Light Screen, and Ice Beam. Toxic is Lugia's best opportunity for any significant damage to Pokemon not weak to Ice-type moves, such as Darkrai and Mewtwo, and is usually the best of the three options; it is also excellent to ravage some of Lugia's targets, such as Rayquaza and Groudon. However, Toxic is utterly ineffective against Metagross and leaves Lugia with no offensive moves, leaving it a facile target for Taunt from Darkrai, Mewtwo, and others; also, all of Lugia's exertions may be rendered useless by a timely Blissey Aromatherapy. Considering Toxic's foibles and the fact that Toxic Spikes is quite popular on Uber teams, one may choose the next option, Light Screen. Although Lugia is predominantly a physical wall, it does have excellent base 154 Special Defense, and Light Screen capitalizes on that by essentially neutralizing its common weaknesses of Electric-, Ice-, Ghost-, and Dark-type attacks, and protecting it from Water- and Dragon-type attacks. Light Screen has the same issue as Toxic in that it leaves Lugia vulnerable to Taunt, though, and makes Lugia thoroughly incapable of inflicting any damage without field effects in place. Ice Beam is a proactive solution that will not deter Metagross, but hits super effectively on Groudon and Rayquaza. Unfortunately, the damage it inflicts is lackluster on anything else, and only has a 2.6% chance of OHKOing the standard Rayquaza even after one round of Life Orb damage.</p> <p>Lugia may sometimes drop Whirlwind so that it may use both Ice Beam and Toxic. This allows it to deal quick damage to both Groudon and Rayquaza, while being able to inflict status on Mewtwo and Darkrai that think they can switch in believing that Lugia has Ice Beam and not Toxic. Toxic can act as a semi-phazing move as the opponent will not want to stay in to face the increasing poison damage, and unlike Whirlwind it can permanently cripple a Pokemon. However, without Whirlwind, Lugia does not have a quick answer to stat boosters and Baton Passers such as Ninjask.</p> <p>A Timid nature with 192 Speed EVs is recommended for most walling Lugia, which translates into 334 Speed. This outruns all Pokemon up to the base 102 Speed bracket that have a Speed boosting nature, an incredibly important feat in Ubers; this is because Groudon, Garchomp, Rayquaza, Palkia, Kyogre, and Dialga, all frighteningly powerful attackers, exist at that level. However, Timid Lugia is OHKOed by a Dragon Danced, Life Orb boosted Outrage from Rayquaza after Stealth Rock damage. One also has the option to ignore Lugia's Speed stat in favor of its Defense and switch the nature from Timid to Bold, should he or she find the boosted Speed not helpful to the team as a whole. With it, a Dragon Danced, Life Orbed Outrage from Jolly Rayquaza maxes out at 72%, allowing Lugia to survive and deal a fatal blow with Ice Beam. The boosted Defense also allows it to wall Ho-Oh much more effectively.</p> <p>Although Lugia has a phenomenal base 154 Special Defense, its main purpose is to wall physical attacks, and it is EVed as such, and thus it cannot compete with the massively powerful special attacks that are thrown about in Ubers territory. Lugia's Flying-type, while giving it many opportunities to switch into Ground-type attacks, causes it to attract loads of Electric- and Ice-type attacks, both of which are extremely common in the Ubers metagame, further destroying its chance of taking special hits. Therefore, it is best for you to pair Lugia with a Pokemon who has good Special Defense with which to take the Ice- and Electric-type attacks directed at Lugia. Blissey can take any of these attacks, but can't do much back to the perpetrator, barring status or Seismic Toss. Kyogre can take Ice Beams from any target. However, it is worth warning that Kyogre's Drizzle invites various Pokemon to unleash Thunder against Lugia once it switches back in.</p> <p>Along with its massive base Special Defense, Lugia's base 110 Speed stat is often overlooked. This high base Speed stat allows it to outspeed certain threats, such as Rayquaza, Groudon, and non-Choice Scarf Garchomp, and hit them with a super effective Ice Beam before they can do more damage. As a result, inflicting Lugia with paralysis severely hampers its ability to wall normally. Pokemon like Blissey, Jirachi, and even some Groudon, such as support sets and the Paradancer set, can mitigate Lugia's walling abilities. A Groudon of your own can switch into Thunder Wave, as it is immune to the Electric-type status. It can also take a boosted Stone Edge directed at Lugia that usually accompany a ParaDancing Groudon.</p> <p>Another massive threat to Lugia is Tyranitar, regardless of what set it chooses to run. Choice Band sets can severely damage Lugia with STAB Pursuit, should Lugia switch out, and it also has Crunch and Stone Edge should Lugia stay in. A Tyranitar with a combination of Taunt and Dragon Dance will completely shut down Lugia. Tyranitar can come in on one of your teammates and Dragon Dance as you switch to Lugia. With Taunt, it can prevent Lugia from Roosting or throwing up a Reflect, and then can wipe you out with its STAB moves, both of which are super effective against Lugia. Also, because of the sandstorm that Tyranitar sets up, its Special Defense is boosted, making Lugia's Ice Beams very ineffective against it. Lucario can accompany Lugia, as it has 4x resistances to both of Tyranitar's STAB attacks, and hits it for massive damage with STAB Close Combat, while Tyranitar can do little in return, barring a Fire Punch. Groudon, can also prove a useful partner, as it can take any attack Tyranitar can unleash upon it. Furthermore, its Drought ability diminishes the accuracy of Thunder, which can be extremely helpful, as Thunder-users are other threats to Lugia. Forretress can threaten Lugia, not because of its damage output, but rather because of the damage it can do to your team. While Forretress cannot do much to Lugia, Lugia cannot do much back, meaning Forretress can set up Spikes, Stealth Rock, or even Toxic Spikes with ease, all of which are annoying and difficult to deal with. Groudon with Fire Punch can deal with Forretress, as it brings the sun into play, boosting its Fire-type move. Also, a Forretress of your own can Spin away entry hazards.</p> <p>Wobbuffet is another annoyance to Lugia, as it can turn it into utter set-up bait. However, sadly Wobbuffet has no counter, as you cannot switch out due to its ability, Shadow Tag. Lugia can use Whirlwind to scout potential Wobbuffet switch-ins, forcing it out, letting Lugia itself leave the battlefield before Wobbuffet comes back in. Lugia can also Whirlwind while Wobbuffet is in, but due to Whirlwind's negative priority, Wobbuffet's Encore will outspeed it and force Lugia to use its most recently used move (which could be Whirlwind). Wobbuffet can also be dealt with by using Toxic. While you are still trapped and potentially Encored, it will permanently cripple Wobbuffet, or even put it in KO range.</p> "

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Lugia's talents can extend to special sweeping after boosting with Calm Mind. While Latias may appear to run the bulky Calm Mind course more effectively due to a better special movepool, lack of an Electric-type weakness, and far superior Special Attack, Lugia can boast that it isn't locked in and annihilated by Metagross Pursuit and doesn't care about Normal Arceus with Extreme Speed. The general idea of this set is to Calm Mind against Pokemon such as Groudon that wouldn't be capable of hurting it and attack with Ice Beam. Whirlwind blows away anything that tries to match Lugia, especially Calm Mind Kyogre. However, Thunder is a viable option over Whirlwind to hit Kyogre directly; it also serves to hit Metagross more effectively. The EV spread given for this set lets Lugia Calm Mind ahead of a Palkia Thunder without fear. Also, it can outspeed any non-Choice Scarf Garchomp, allowing it to faint the beast with an Ice Beam before it can do too much damage to Lugia. Lugia also keeps a lot of its physical durability, for example, a Choice Band Groudon Stone Edge only does 85.58% at maximum, so Lugia will be able to stall out its effectively 4 PP (after Pressure slices its original 8) assuming there aren't too many critical hits or the random numbers remain medium or low. However, make sure you have spun away Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Unlike Kyogre, Lugia does not have access to any move as strong as Kyogre's Water Spout, and thus, even with many Calm Mind boosts, it falls victim to being walled by Blissey. Psych Up or Calm Mind versions can match Lugia's boosts, making it nearly impossible to break Blissey, barring a critical hit or freeze from Ice Beam. By using Whirlwind, you can phaze Blissey out, but she can still come back in to wall Lugia to her heart's desire. For this reason, it is highly recommended that you have a physical or mixed attacker to accompany Lugia by taking out Blissey, and, for versions without Thunder, Kyogre as well, as it will resist Ice Beam and start setting up Calm Minds, or just deal immediate damage to Lugia with Thunder.</p> <p>Sets with Whirlwind benefit greatly from entry hazards. Moves like Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes can cause lots of passive damage that Lugia can utilize by shuffling your opponent's team with Whirlwind, in order to wear down his or her team for Lugia's sweep. After many switch-ins, Pokemon without dedicated recovery moves, such as Groudon and Tyranitar, will not be able to stand up to Lugia's boosted attacks, even if they are normally sound counters, in Tyranitar's case. For entry hazard support, it is beneficial to pair Lugia with Pokemon like Deoxys-S, Forretress, Skarmory, or Groudon, can all set up one or more of the three types of passive damage.</p> <p>If you decide to run Thunder on Lugia, it is very important to have weather support on your team in the form of Kyogre to set up rain. Although Ice-type attacks are very effective in Ubers with the high amount of Dragon- and Flying-types around, Thunder helps greatly by hitting the also ubiquitous Steel-types for neutral damage. Also, it is incredibly useful for hitting Kyogre, who otherwise takes very little damage for your Ice Beams.</p> "

        "name": "Trick",
        "description": "<p>This particular Lugia is designed to cripple, or at least hamper, many of its common switch-ins while still serving the role of a defensive counter. However, beware that \"normal\" Lugia sets will almost always use Leftovers, making the lack of Leftovers recovery give away that fact that you are holding Choice Specs.</p> <p>Trick is the main feature of this set and allows Lugia to disable more defensive switch-ins such as Blissey and Latias. For example, if the standard Latias (Timid, 112 HP / 204 SpA / 0 SpD) is Tricked on the switch-in and loses its Soul Dew in exchange for Lugia's Choice Specs, Lugia will beat it 1 on 1 with Ice Beam (assuming that Latias does not get multiple critical hits or that you are without Roost). If Latias chooses to lock itself into Recover or Roost, Lugia can easily PP stall it out. Trick will also allow Lugia to disable Pokemon like Calm Mind Mewtwo as they switch in. By investing a small amount in Special Attack when aided with Choice Specs Lugia can cripple its more offensive switch-ins such as Kyogre. Although Aeroblast appears to be an oddball in this set, it provides general coverage, and is surprisingly powerful when powered up by Choice Specs. If you are having problems predicting between Ice Beam or Thunder while Choice Specs is still held by Lugia, you can't go wrong with Aeroblast.</p> <p>The EV spread is designed to accomplish a few specific goals. A Timid nature with 192 Speed EVs gives Lugia 334 Speed, enough to outrun Jolly Garchomp. 116 Special Attack EVs guarantees a 2HKO on 240 HP / 0 SpD Kyogre with Thunder as well as on opposing Lugia if Stealth Rock is in play. They also guarantee an OHKO against 4 HP / 0 SpD Rayquaza and a 2HKO on 252 HP / 60 SpD Adamant Groudon with Ice Beam. The 200 HP EVs also serve a specific purpose. They assure that a once Dragon Danced Jolly Rayquaza's Life Orb Outrage will never OHKO and an Adamant one will not OHKO on average. Additionally, a Swords Danced Adamant Rayquaza's Life Orb Extreme Speed will never OHKO and if said Rayquaza is Jolly, Lugia has a slight chance to not be 2HKOed. Lugia will also still be able to effectively counter most Groudon with the given EVs or at a minimum cripple them with Trick or Ice Beam. If you opt to use Aeroblast, 64 HP / 252 SpA / 192 Spe is a better EV spread. Lugia's Aeroblast does 52.8%-62.7% to max HP / max SpD Careful Forretress and 50.6%-60% to 4 HP / no SpD Palkia. Lugia will still survive a Swords Danced Extreme Speed from Adamant Rayquaza holding a Life Orb after taking Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Any Pokemon who can resist or abuse Lugia's initial strategy of Tricking is an immediate threat to this set. Pokemon who would fall into this category are Pokemon with specially oriented offensive stats and a Choice item of their own, and Giratina-O.</p> <p>Any Pokemon who uses special attacks and has Choice Specs or even Choice Scarf can pose an instant threat to this Lugia. Lugia's main strategy is to Trick right away, so therefore it will catch its counter switching in, which will forced to carry Choice Specs. Since Lugia's normal counters include physical Pokemon, such as Tyranitar, and support Pokemon, such as Blissey and Wobbuffet, giving them a Choice Specs will severely hamper their ability to deal with Lugia. However, the aforementioned Choiced special Pokemon, such as Palkia, Dialga, or Kyogre can all take Lugia's Choice Specs, giving Lugia back their own Choice item. Lugia is then locked into Trick, and is forced to switch out, giving your opponent a free turn to smack your switch-in with a high-powered Draco Meteor or Water Spout. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you have a Pokemon with high Special Defense to deal with these threats. Blissey can take any attack, barring Aura Sphere, from Dialga or Palkia, while Latias can deal with a Choice Specs Water Spout from Kyogre, making them both ideal partners for this set.</p> <p>Giratina-O is kept in its Origin forme with its special item, the Griseous Orb, and thus it cannot be Tricked your pair of Choice Specs. Then, taking advantage of the fact that you are locked into the ineffective Trick, it can set up for a potentially dangerous sweep. Therefore, pairing this with a Tyranitar is beneficial, since Giratina-O cannot kill it before it reciprocates with a super effective Crunch or Pursuit, unless it carries Aura Sphere. Tyranitar's Sand Stream trait will also help drain the health of not only Giratina-O, but also the Pokemon who has received Lugia's Choice Specs (so long as it is not a Ground-, Rock- or Steel-type). Wobbuffet can also work well to deal with versions without Shadow Ball, as it can Encore a set-up move or Mirror Coat back an offensive move.</p> <p>Regardless of what Pokemon switches in to acquire Lugia's Choice Specs, Wobbuffet makes a fantastic partner for picking off the crippled Pokemon. With Wobbuffet in, you can trap the newly Choiced Pokemon with Shadow Tag, locking it into an attacking move, which you can then Mirror Coat or Counter back for heavy damage. Wobbuffet can also deal with Pokemon who hold Choice items prior to Lugia using Trick who are trying to lock Lugia into that move.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>This set takes a radically different approach from the other Lugia sets, focusing on Lugia's offensive capabilities instead of its defensive prowess. While Lugia's low base 90 Special Attack may seem unappealing, its bulk, Speed, and powerful Aeroblast more than make up for this setback.</p> <p>Aeroblast is the crux of this set, being more powerful than a Life Orb-boosted Ice Beam from Mewtwo. With Stealth Rock, +1 Aeroblast 2HKOes Wobbuffet and nearly OHKOes Mewtwo, Lugia's most common counters. It can also 2HKO common threats, such as Giratina-O, Latios, Groudon, Scizor, and Forretress, as well as OHKOing Darkrai and Rayquaza after SR. In addition, it has a chance to 2HKO max HP Kyogre after Stealth Rock, though Calm Mind variants with Rest / Sleep Talk can cause trouble.</p> <p>Roost is a vital move for this set, as it allows Lugia to set up multiple Calm Minds against specially offensive foes, such as Palkia and Dialga. You should choose the last move depending on what your team can handle. Earth Power in general hits Pokemon who resist Aeroblast, such as Steel- or Electric-type Pokemon. Earth Power specifically helps deal with Dialga and Heatran, both of whom may attempt to wall Lugia. Thunder easily defeats Kyogre, opposing Lugia, and Skarmory. It also hits Ho-Oh, though be careful, as sun reduces Thunder's accuracy to 50% and allows Ho-Oh to OHKO Lugia with Sacred Fire. Hidden Power Fighting is a viable option, as it allows Lugia to 2HKO specially defensive Tyranitar after a boost, and OHKO minimum HP Tyranitar after Stealth Rock. While you will no longer 2HKO specially defensive Dialga (thus meaning that Lugia will lose to Bulk Up Dialga), Lugia will still be able to 2HKO max HP Dialga with a boosted Hidden Power Fighting. However, Hidden Power Fighting Lugia will have issues getting past Jirachi and Metagross. Finally, if Steel-types are not a problem, Ice Beam is a possibility to get a quick OHKO on Rayquaza and Garchomp while still 2HKOing opposing Lugia after you gain a boost. Ice Beam will also deal a massive amount of damage to Giratina-O.</p> <p>Here are some damage calculations to show the power of this set. All of these damage calculations assume that Lugia is Timid and has set up one Calm Mind.</p> <ul> <li>Aeroblast vs 28/252+ Wobbuffet: 46.78% - 55.3% <li>Aeroblast vs 4/0 Mewtwo: 76.55% - 90.11%</li> <li>Aeroblast vs 4/0 Kyogre: 54.39% - 64.04%</li> <li>Aeroblast vs 252/0 Kyogre: 46.04% - 54.21%</li> <li>Aeroblast vs 4/0 Palkia: 65.73% - 77.88%</li> <li>Aeroblast vs 252/60 Groudon: 63.12% - 74.26%</li> <li>Aeroblast vs 248/200 Scizor: 69.1% - 81.63%</li> <li>Aeroblast vs 252/252+ Forretress: 68.93% - 81.36%</li> <li>Aeroblast vs 4/0 Darkrai: 96.1% - 113.12%</li> <li>Aeroblast vs 0/4 Rayquaza: 76.35% - 90.03%</li> <li>Aeroblast vs 0/0- Giratina-O: 62.59% - 73.7%</li> <li> <ul> <li>Aeroblast vs 86/96 Giratina-O: 48.92% - 57.79%</li> </ul> </li> <li>Aeroblast vs 4/0 Latios: 50.66% - 59.6%</li> <li>Earth Power vs 4/0 Dialga and Jirachi: 86.55% - 102.34%</li> <li>Earth Power vs 252/0 Metagross: 89.56% - 105.49%</li> <li>Earth Power vs 252/216+ Tyranitar: 36.63% - 43.56%</li> <li>Earth Power vs 4/0 Tyranitar: 58.48% - 69.01%</li> </ul> <p>As you can seen from these damage calculations, this Lugia will greatly appreciate Stealth Rock, as it relies on that to defeat Wobbuffet and max HP Kyogre. Additional, Spikes are also fairly helpful due to them allowing Lugia to OHKO Mewtwo with a boosted Aeroblast.</p> <p>An important thing to note about this Lugia is that due to its offensive nature, it has a radically different playstyle when compared to the defensive Lugia sets. Because of the lack of HP EVs, this Lugia will not be able to tank hits as well as the defensive sets. For example, an unboosted Outrage from Garchomp will 2HKO this Lugia after Stealth Rock damage. Offensive Lugia will often find time to set up after an opponent has KOed one of your Pokemon. For example, after Choice Scarf Palkia gets a kill with Spacial Rend, Lugia can set up. Lugia will also be able to set up on Choice Scarf Dialga's Dragon Pulses. Wobbuffet can be a very helpful teammate for Lugia, as it can Encore support moves and Earthquakes for Lugia to set up on.</p> <p>There are several Pokemon who will be troublesome when attempting to sweep with Lugia. Blissey is by far the biggest problem, as she walls Lugia's entire moveset and can cripple it with status. Tyranitar is another serious issue. Lugia will have trouble even 2HKOing some Tyranitar with a boosted Earth Power, while Choice Band Tyranitar will usually OHKO Lugia with Crunch. Even worse, Tyranitar can actually trap Lugia with Pursuit. Without Thunder, Lugia will never 2HKO Ho-Oh without Stealth Rock, while Life Orb Ho-Oh will OHKO Lugia with Sacred Fire after Stealth Rock damage. While a +1 Aeroblast with Stealth Rock can 2HKO Latias, she can use Calm Mind and Recover to defeat Lugia in a Calm Mind war. In a similar manner, Rest + Sleep Talk Calm Mind users, such as Kyogre and Giratina, will be able to outstall Lugia. Without Thunder, Skarmory and opposing Lugia will have no problems phazing Lugia away with Whirlwind, or crippling it with Toxic. If you use Thunder over Earth Power, Dialga will wall Lugia.</p> <p>Because of these issues, offensive Lugia works very well with the Tickle Wobbuffet + Pursuit strategy. Wobbuffet can use Tickle several times on Blissey, Lugia, and Calm Mind Giratina, and then let them fall prey to Pursuit users, such as Scizor, Metagross, and Tyranitar. You can also use Dugtrio with Wobbuffet to defeat Blissey after you have Encored her. Additionally, Pursuit users keep Latias at bay (provided that she doesn't have Hidden Power Fire in Scizor's case). Scizor can switch into Tyranitar's Crunch and threaten to do a massive amount of damage with Bullet Punch or U-turn. Ho-Oh unfortunately lacks any true counters; however, Kyogre can check it. Kyogre can also use Thunder Wave or Toxic to cripple Latias switch-ins, or even Waterfall to 2HKO Blissey (with Life Orb or Mystic Water). Groudon can easily force Tyranitar and Dialga out with Earthquake, and can make a great Skarmory lure with Overheat. Calm Mind Latias and Latios can defeat Kyogre, OHKO Skarmory with Thunder, and do a massive amount of damage to Tyranitar switch-ins with a boosted Grass Knot. Choice Scarf Palkia can lure in Tyranitar expecting Spacial Rend (only to 2HKO them with Surf), and can revenge kill Latias with Outrage. Mixed attackers, such as Dialga and Palkia, work well in dealing a massive amount of damage to Blissey. Dialga in particular can use Bulk Up on its mixed sets to lure in Skarmory. Bulk Up Dialga itself is also a great teammate, as it can set up on Blissey, Tyranitar, and Calm Mind Kyogre.</p> "

  "Ho-Oh": {
    "overview": "<p>With its monstrously high Special Defense combined with the excellent Sacred Fire and Brave Bird STAB combination and that impressive Attack stat, switching into Ho-Oh is a daunting prospect. Ho-Oh's amazing bulk and lack of weaknesses to common attack types in Ubers make it a defensive behemoth. Thanks to Ho-Oh's new toy in Brave Bird, most of its old counters no longer work as well, meaning that Ho-Oh is now a top-tier threat that can literally devastate teams. However, Stealth Rock is a large pain in Ho-Oh's side, as it is set up by many common Pokemon in Ubers such as Groudon, Forretress, and Deoxys-S, and Ho-Oh will hate losing 50% of its health every time it switches in. Nevertheless, the rainbow phoenix is still an enormous threat, and is something that every team needs to have a plan for.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>When configuring Ho-Oh's EVs, first make sure that Ho-Oh's HP is always an odd number. This lets it switch into Stealth Rock twice and survive, whereas an even numbered HP stat would mean two hits of Stealth Rock will kill it off. 192 HP and 76 Special Defense EVs will allow Ho-Oh to always survive a Life Orbed Dark Pulse from Timid Darkrai after it has used Nasty Plot twice at full HP, making Ho-Oh one of the best Darkrai checks around.</p> <p>Always max Attack on the Choice Band set. Like many other Ubers in the same base 90 Speed group as Ho-Oh, setting Speed is a tricky decision. Max Speed with an Adamant nature doesn't really guarantee it will outspeed anything of note; it just allows for a tie with Kyogre, Groudon, Dialga, and other Ho-Oh. If you don't want to take your chances in the coin toss against those four, you can focus more on Ho-Oh's HP, to allow it to take more hits. Allocate 24 EVs to Speed to beat Adamant Tyranitar, and then place the remaining EVs in HP. 84 Speed EVs can also allow Ho-Oh to outpace most Jirachi, allowing you to roast it before Jirachi can Paralyze Ho-Oh. 140 Speed EVs allows Ho-Oh to outrun most Rock Polish Groudon before a boost, should you want to (hopefully) Burn it with Sacred Fire before it hits you with Stone Edge. Jolly nature will outrun most Rayquaza, so that's certainly a worthy consideration. You only need 290 to achieve this, but max is again an option if you fancy your chances in a tie against the other base 90s.</p> <p>Ho-Oh also has several other moves it can employ. Thunder Wave can cripple a counter with paralysis; thankfully, the only Uber immune to it is Groudon, who is unlikely to risk switching into Ho-Oh, as Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire can severely cripple it. Reflect is available for support purposes, although Sacred Fire burns are enough to ward off physical attackers. Whirlwind allows Ho-Oh to function as a phazer, which it does reasonably well against special attackers if they lack an Electric attack. Safeguard gives Ho-Oh and its teammates some protection against status. Due to Ho-Oh's massive base 154 Special Defense, 106 base HP, and some fairly useful resistances, Rest + Sleep Talk are viable options for a team that lacks a status absorber. Ho-Oh can also use Choice Specs or Calm Mind to take advantage of its base 110 Special Attack stat and its good special movepool, but generally there are a lot more Pokemon who are better special sweepers, such as Kyogre, Mewtwo, Latias, Latios, and Palkia. Also, Ho-Oh's physical sets are generally more threatening.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ho-Oh does not have a true counter as nothing in Ubers can really stand up to its monstrously powerful attacks. However, as was mentioned several times in the analysis, Kyogre can be a massive pain in the tail feathers for Ho-Oh. Kyogre resists Ho-Oh's Fire-type moves, gets rid of the sunlight thanks to Drizzle, and will OHKO Ho-Oh with Surf. However, even the bulkiest of Kyogre are 2HKOed at worst by Ho-Oh's Life Orb Brave Bird after Stealth Rock, with more offensive variants being OHKOed, so Kyogre must be careful about switching in. Palkia has a higher base Speed stat than Ho-Oh and can destroy it with Water-type moves of its own. However, special attacking Palkia risk actually being walled by Ho-Oh in the sunlight if they lack a Rock-type move such as Power Gem, while physical variants risk being crippled by a burn from Sacred Fire. Rayquaza is also faster than Ho-Oh and can easily obliterate Ho-Oh with Outrage, but Rayquaza can only come in on Earthquake. Giratina can wall most of Ho-Oh's attacks, but it is 3HKOed by Brave Bird, meaning that if Giratina lacks Toxic or Stone Edge, Ho-Oh will beat Giratina due to Rest's two-turn sleep side effect. (Brave Bird will KO Giratina before it wakes up.) Latios and Latias can outspeed Ho-Oh and destroy it with Thunder, but the sunlight will cripple the move's accuracy and neither of them can take a Brave Bird, making them very risky options.</p> <p>Using something faster than Ho-Oh with a Rock-type attack will make a good check for it. Choice Scarf Tyranitar is probably the best choice since it resists both of Ho-Oh's STAB attacks, will always outspeed non-Choice Scarf sets, and will always OHKO with Stone Edge. Garchomp and fast variants of Groudon and Giratina-O can also work provided they are equipped with Stone Edge. It should be noted, however, that all of these Pokemon need to be wary of switching into Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire, lest they be crippled for the rest of the match with a burn.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<p>By using Life Orb, Ho-Oh can ramp up its Attack, but can also make use of the versatility that comes with it. Sacred Fire, Ho-Oh's main STAB option, should be used primarily. Its 8 PP is the only flaw, one made even worse with Pressure being the most common ability in Ubers.</p> <p>Ho-Oh's high Attack and excellent type coverage allow it to be a very intimidating threat, even when in the face of its potential counters. Sacred Fire, as said before, is Ho-Oh's main attack, and deals massive damage to anything that does not resist it. Groudon's sun boosts its power even further. Furthermore, Sacred Fire's whopping 50% chance of burning can also cripple any physical attacker that is daring enough to switch into it. Brave Bird is also an amazingly powerful attack to use if the weather is not in Ho-Oh's favor. It gets surprisingly good neutral coverage with this set, as Dialga is the only Uber that resists Flying-type attacks in Ubers, and only Aerodactyl, Solrock, and Lunatone resist the combination of Fire-, Flying-, and Ground-type attacks, and none of them are ever used in Ubers. The recoil damage can also be mitigated with Roost. Furthermore, Brave Bird will always OHKO Palkia, Latias, Latios, Rayquaza, and minimum HP / minimum Defense Kyogre after Stealth Rock damage with a Life Orb boost. Maximum HP Kyogre is also OHKOed after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes has been laid down, while the standard defensive Calm Mind Kyogre is always outsped and 2HKOed. Giratina is also 3HKOed by Brave Bird, meaning that Ho-Oh will KO Giratina before it will awake from Rest's forced two-turn sleep. (However, Ho-Oh will take a lot of damage in the process from recoil, and if Giratina's Sleep Talk move selects an attacking move, then Ho-Oh will probably die alongside Giratina, so attempting this can be risky.) Therefore, all of Ho-Oh's previous counters can now be dealt with, making this set all the more deadly. Earthquake rounds out the coverage, allowing Ho-Oh to hit Tyranitar, Heatran, and Dialga in the rain for super effective damage, who would otherwise resist Ho-Oh's STAB combination.</p> <p>Substitute and Roost make fantastic additions to this set. Although you may feel that Life Orb recoil plus Substitute damage and recoil damage from Brave Bird will add up to too much passive damage, Roost can keep Ho-Oh healthy for a very long time, thanks to its great defenses. Substitute works very well with Ho-Oh, as its large base 154 Special Defense allows the Substitutes to stand up to many of the powerful special attacks in Ubers. Furthermore, the high chance of burning associated with Sacred Fire cuts many physical sweepers' attacks, making it even harder to break Ho-Oh's Substitutes. By using Substitutes, it eases prediction, and Ho-Oh can do severe damage to opponents who threaten it before switching out, such as Kyogre, which will help weaken the power of moves such as Water Spout. Whirlwind works very well on this set too if Ho-Oh has a lot of entry hazard support. Ho-Oh is bulky enough to shuffle the opponent's team effectively, thus spreading tons of entry hazard damage. Ho-Oh can also actually counter Giratina with Whirlwind, provided you have a lot of entry hazards up, as it will not be able to withstand so much passive damage.</p> <p>Leftovers can also be used over Life Orb on this set. Ho-Oh will not be as powerful and will lose a few OHKOes, but it will be able to live for a much longer time. Leftovers is best used in conjunction with Substitute or Whirlwind, and is a good choice if Ho-Oh is being used on a more stall-oriented team. It can also help Ho-Oh take more attacks from threats such as Darkrai or Mewtwo more effectively, should Ho-Oh be used for that purpose.</p> <p>Max Attack is highly recommended to take advantage of Ho-Oh's high Attack stat. 24 Speed EVs allow Ho-Oh to outpace Adamant Tyranitar. The remaining EVs are placed into HP to help maintain Ho-Oh's bulk, giving it 411 HP, enough to switch into Stealth Rock twice without dying. If using Leftovers, the preferred spread for this set is 192 HP / 216 Atk / 76 SpD / 24 Spe, with the same nature. This EV spread allows Ho-Oh decent power while also enabling it to always survive a Life Orbed Dark Pulse from Timid Darkrai that after it has used Nasty Plot twice. This can be crucial, as Darkrai is a major threat to the defensive teams you would probably see Leftovers Ho-Oh being used on.</p> <p>Ho-Oh needs to watch out for Pokemon who can hit it before it can put up a Substitute or those that do not mind being burned by Sacred Fire. Such Pokemon include Choice Scarf Kyogre or speedy Palkia. Special versions of Rayquaza also fall into this category, as they resist Sacred Fire and are immune to Earthquake, and the same goes for Latias and Latios. Kyogre is best defeated by either a Latias with Grass Knot / Thunder and Recover or a Choice Scarf Palkia with Thunder. Both Latias and Palkia resist Water Spout and can retaliate with a strong attack, or, in Latias' or Latios' case, Recover off any damage taken. Choice Scarf Palkia can be trapped and killed with Wobbuffet, or revenge killed by Garchomp, who can also revenge kill Latias, Latios, and Rayquaza. In return, Ho-Oh can take many Ice Beams that are normally destined for the land shark. Blissey can deal with special attackers, such as Palkia, Latias, and Latios, and can cripple them with either Thunder Wave or Toxic, unless Latias has Safeguard or Refresh, but it cannot stand up to the powerful Water-type moves of Kyogre. Latias and Latios can also be dealt with by Metagross or Scizor, both of whom can trap them with Pursuit or hit them with a powerful Meteor Mash or U-turn should they stay in, respectively, while taking little damage from Dragon Pulse. It should be noted, however, that none of the above threats to Ho-Oh will want to switch into a Brave Bird.</p> <p>Ho-Oh also dislikes faster Pokemon who carry Rock-type attacks. Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Garchomp, and speedy variants or Groudon and Giratina-O fall into this category. Groudon can easily handle any Rock-type attack thrown at Ho-Oh and will wall Garchomp and Tyranitar without a problem. Groudon can also cripple Giratina-O with Thunder Wave. Opposing Groudon can easily be stopped by Latias, who can usually handle a Stone Edge, OHKO Groudon with Grass Knot, and recover off the damage later. Latias can also check Giratina-O very well, as she is faster than the ghostly dragon and will easily pummel it with her STAB Dragon-type attacks. Payback Forretress can also stop Giratina-O, as long as it lacks Hidden Power Fire.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>While the Physical Attacker set is more versatile, the Choice Band set hits very hard right off the bat. Sacred Fire is an excellent attack, and with its 50% burn rate and Ho-Oh's high Attack stat, you can expect to cause some serious problems for your opponent. Brave Bird will always OHKO Kyogre (provided it has no HP or Defense EVs), Palkia, Latias, Latios, and Rayquaza without any prior damage, although the recoil damage is a bit more detrimental since this set lacks recovery. Earthquake does more damage to Dialga than Sacred Fire if the weather isn't on your side, in addition to hitting any Tyranitar or Heatran that may come your way. It also 2HKOes Kyogre and Palkia, should Brave Bird's recoil be undesirable to you. Punishment is quite an interesting attack and is well suited for use against the stat boosting Psychic-types that are common in Uber battles. Although it starts at a paltry 60 Base Power, it gains an extra 20 for each stat boost the opponent has. For example, against an opponent with one Calm Mind, Punishment will have 100 Base Power. Punishment is good for hitting Latios (who will often fall to a single hit), Latias, and Giratina. However, Brave Bird will do more damage unless they have Calm Mind boosts.</p> <p>This set has some problems with Scarf Kyogre as it will replace the sunlight with rain, which boosts Kyogre's Water attacks and weakens Ho-oh's Sacred Fire. Scarf Kyogre will then proceed to OHKO Ho-Oh with Surf. Giratina is also a bit more of a threat since it can wall Ho-Oh easier due to this set's lack of Roost and ability to switch attacks. Latias is the all-purpose Kyogre counter, as it can take the boosted Water Spouts and Surfs, while hurting Kyogre with Grass Knot or Thunder, and replenishing its health with Recover or Roost. Palkia can also check certain versions (Choice Scarf Kyogre can be difficult, however, unless your Palkia has one too) with its 4x resistance to Water-type moves and access to Thunder. Latias and Palkia are also great answers to Giratina as well. Groudon should also be used in tandem with one or both of the two to restore the sun after Kyogre has been eliminated.</p> <p>Rayquaza can set up a potentially destructive sweep if Ho-Oh is not locked into Sacred Fire or Brave Bird. Rayquaza is immune to Earthquake and is not hurt too badly by Punishment, and outspeeds and KOes Ho-Oh after either a Dragon Dance or a Swords Dance, by hitting Ho-Oh in its weaker Defense. Choice Scarf Garchomp can revenge kill Dragon Dance Rayquaza, because of its odd base 102 Speed stat. Swords Dance Rayquaza is checked by Choice Scarf Dialga or Gengar (The latter also checks Dragon Dance Rayquaza quite well.), as they are resistant or immune to Extreme Speed, respectively, and can KO Rayquaza with Dragon Pulse or Hidden Power Ice, respectively. A defensive Groudon can also take on most Rayquaza, as it can cripple Rayquaza with Thunder Wave and then proceed to 2HKO it with Dragon Claw. Choice Scarf Jirachi can also check any Rayquaza variant thanks to its high Base Speed stat, Steel-typing granting it key resistances to Extreme Speed and Outrage, and access to Ice Punch.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>At first glance, this may seem identical to the Choice Band set, but this Ho-Oh plays more as a revenge killer and a fast sweeper. With Choice Scarf making up for Ho-Oh's below average Speed, it can surprise many opponents to become an unexpected speedy threat.</p> <p>Sacred Fire is your main attack as it is on the previous sets. Brave Bird allows Ho-Oh to 2HKO most Kyogre, Latios, Latias, Palkia, and Rayquaza, although one must be wary of the recoil damage. Punishment is a unique move that allows you to take down some threats that your team may have allowed to set up. Calm Mind Mewtwo and Calm Mind Latias are completely destroyed by this move. After just one Calm Mind, Punishment is up to 100 Base Power. After one more, it reaches a deadly 140 Base Power. Earthquake is your strongest attack against Tyranitar and Dialga and can be used against any Heatran who enter expecting you to use Sacred Fire.</p> <p>This set has a lot of trouble with defensive Kyogre and faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Garchomp, Palkia, Darkrai, and Dialga (any Pokemon with a Choice Scarf and has 90+ base Speed can at least force a Speed tie, but these are the most seen). Ho-Oh also fears paralysis a lot, as it will render the extra Speed granted by Choice Scarf utterly useless. Choice Scarf Garchomp, Palkia, and Dialga are all handled quite easily by Wobbuffet, who can trap them with Shadow Tag, and then kill them with either Counter or Mirror Coat, as, due to their Choice item, you know what move they are locked into. Darkrai cannot be countered like this, unless it is locked into Focus Blast, because it is immune to Wobbuffet's Mirror Coat. Scizor works quite well as a Darkrai counter, provided Scizor is not put to sleep, as it resists Darkrai's Dark-type STAB and can hit it with Superpower or U-turn for super effective damage, or Bullet Punch to bypass its Choice Scarf. Wish support would work well with Wobbuffet, as it has no recovery move of its own, and even Wobbuffet can't take multiple beatings from Choice Scarf users. Both Jirachi and Blissey can fulfill this role very well, the former due to paralysis support in Body Slam, and the latter from her high Special Defense and Hit Point stats. Blissey can also free Ho-Oh from paralysis by using Aromatherapy. Latias, as mentioned before, can easily take Kyogre down with Grass Knot or Thunder. If you really fear Ho-Oh getting paralyzed, Groudon and Garchomp are immune to Thunder Wave, the most common paralyzing move, and they can destroy common users of said move, most notably Jirachi and Blissey.</p> <p>Ho-Oh's lack of Attack-boosting item (such as Life Orb or Choice Band) or Attack-boosting move makes Ho-Oh weaker, and it cannot beat some of the Pokemon it usually scares. Many Pokemon can now switch into Ho-Oh's attacks when they resist it or have high defenses, as they will not take nearly as much damage, such as Groudon into Punishment. Bulk Up Dialga is particularly threatening, as it can switch into any move, even Earthquake, as Ho-Oh only has a 3.81% of 2HKOing Dialga, even after Leftovers and Stealth Rock, and start boosting its Defense and Attack to massive levels. Soon, not even Earthquake will be able to take it down, and it can Rest off Sacred Fire's burn and faint Ho-Oh with a boosted Outrage or Dragon Claw. Groudon can take Outrages from Dialga, provided that they are not boosted too many times, and can severely hurt Dialga back with Earthquake. Heatran can also come in, as it resists Dialga's Dragon-type moves, and can hit it on its Special Defense, which is not boosted. A Choice Specs Overheat from Heatran with a Special Attack-boosting nature in the sun (from Groudon) will OHKO even Bulk Up Dialga, which invests heavily in both HP and Special Defense.</p> "

You will still want Light Screen to take Surfs from Palkia and Kyogre and other hits from the many special based monsters that inhabit the Uber metagame. Toxic your foes and use Light Screen, Recover or Roost, and Pressure to stall out your opponent. Any physical threats can be handled with the burn from Sacred Fire, which had the added advantage of destroying any Metagross who is foolhardy enough to switch in. Make sure to hit the likes of Kyogre, Palkia, Mewtwo, Latias, and Latios on the switch with Toxic. The latter two may use Taunt or Safeguard to shut down your strategy.</p> <p>Using either Recover or Roost depends on what you want Ho-Oh to do. Roost removes Ho-Oh's weakness to Electric, gives it an Ice-type resistance, and makes Rock-type attacks only do double damage against Ho-Oh instead of quadruple damage. However, using Roost can make trying to beat non-Stone Edge Groudon difficult, due to Ho-Oh gaining an unfortunate Ground-type weakness on the turn it Roosts, meaning that if said Groudon uses Earthquake on the turn you Roost, Ho-Oh will likely not survive. If you feel that this is a concern, you can use Recover over Roost so Ho-Oh will keep its immunity to Ground-type attacks at all times.</p> <p>The beauty of this set is that Steel-types, who can normally switch into Ho-Oh's Toxic with their immunity, are instead met with a powerful Sacred Fire, which deals immense damage when the sun is up. However, you must still watch out for Heatran, who is immune to both Sacred Fire and Toxic, making Ho-Oh's strategy useless against it. Garchomp can come in on any of Heatran's attacks, barring Dragon Pulse, and destroy it with a STAB Earthquake, or use the turn when Heatran may switch out to stat up, should you be using a Swords Dance or SubSalac version. Another Pokemon to watch out for is Rest + Sleep Talk Kyogre, who not only gets rid of the sun, but can also take a Sacred Fire with ease, and can Rest off Toxic and any damage Ho-Oh can deal to it. In return, Kyogre can severely hurt Ho-Oh with a boosted Surf, which will deal tremendous damage in the rain, even through Light Screen. Latias can deal with Rest + Sleep Talk Kyogre fairly easily, as it resists Kyogre's Water-type STAB, can Recover off the damage, and then take out Kyogre with Grass Knot or Thunder.</p> "

In addition, its access to Leech Seed and Rain Dish makes it a massive pain to take down if rain is up and Ludicolo finds a turn to safely use Leech Seed. In conjunction with Substitute, Ludicolo is capable of stalling the foe with Substitute + Leech Seed + Protect for long periods of time. In a pinch, Ludicolo can even attempt to check Pokemon such as Palkia and support Groudon. However, Ludicolo is extremely physically frail, so even neutral attacks such as Giratina-O's Dragon Claw are capable of inflicting severe damage. Ludicolo also lacks many resistances, which limits the pool of Pokemon it can check, although the Water and Ground resistances are useful.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic is an option if you cannot fit a Toxic Spikes user onto your team, but Ludicolo really doesn't have room for it. Giga Drain might look attractive at first to grant Ludicolo extra recovery, but it is very weak (60 Base Power is underwhelming in Ubers) and Ludicolo does not need the extra recovery. Focus Blast garners a super effective hit on Dialga but is inaccurate and cannot even 3HKO specially defensive Dialga variants. Finally, Ludicolo can attempt to run a Swift Swim set, with Grass-type STAB moves and access to Focus Blast setting it apart from other swift swim users. However, Ludicolo's underwhelming base 90 Special Attack and inability to outrun fast Choice Scarf users such as Palkia and Garchomp significantly hinder its performance in this role. Kabutops, Kingdra, and Omastar are almost always better choices if you want to use a Swift Swim user. Never use Swords Dance Ludicolo; it is far too weak to accomplish anything of note. Overall, it is generally best to stick with the listed set, as Ludicolo functions worse if one of its main moves is replaced.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>RestTalk Dialga with Bulk Up can easily set up on Ludicolo and PP stall it with Pressure, and even the rare Focus Blast Ludicolo cannot break through it. Opposing Substitute users that have an immunity to Toxic Spikes are a massive hassle for Ludicolo, unless its coverage move can break their Substitute. Ho-Oh, Heatran, and Giratina-O are all extremely threatening to Ludicolo and its team if they set up a Substitute on Ludicolo that it cannot break. Taunt users such as Mewtwo and Heatran can also stop Ludicolo from landing a Leech Seed, although the latter fears Surf if rain is up. Toxic Spikes dramatically impacts Ludicolo's ability to last very long, especially if two layers are up by the time Ludicolo enters the field of play. Ludicolo should generally switch out of entry hazard setters, as it will surrender multiple layers to them before finally knocking them out. Forretress is of particular concern, as Rapid Spin can remove both Ludicolo's Leech Seed and entry hazards from its own side of the field. Specially defensive Skarmory and Deoxys-D can set up Spikes while using Recover to stay healthy. Shaymin-S is immune to Leech Seed, resists both of Ludicolo's STAB moves, and can threaten Ludicolo back with its STAB Air Slash, but it must make sure Ludicolo does not carry Ice coverage before attempting to switch in. Calm Mind Latias and Latios dislike Icy Wind and Leech Seed but can set up Calm Minds on Ludicolo fairly easily. Changing the weather will not completely shut down Ludicolo, but that can at least cut off its Rain Dish recovery. Finally, if all else fails, Ludicolo is very physically frail and takes solid damage from even resisted attacks; powerful neutral attacks such as Life Orb Rayquaza's Outrage will take down Ludicolo in one hit.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Leech Seed grants Ludicolo significant recovery in conjunction with Rain Dish and Leftovers while slowly wearing down the foe. Substitute is useful on Ludicolo to shield it from status while it sets up a Leech Seed cycle; because Ludicolo can restore approximately 25% of its health per turn so long as the foe is seeded, it can continue to use Substitute indefinitely until the opponent's Pokemon either faints or switches out. Protect increases Ludicolo's ability to stall and allows it to last longer. It also allows Ludicolo to scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Palkia. The last moveslot is dedicated to an attack of your choice. Ice Beam is probably Ludicolo's best option, as it OHKOes Rayquaza after Stealth Rock and always breaks Giratina-O's Substitute. On more offensive teams, Icy Wind can be used over Ice Beam to slow down the opponent's Pokemon to assist its teammates. Surf is a STAB option that has the added benefit of being boosted by rain. It is Ludicolo's only move that can break Ho-Oh's Substitute, and it can also chip away at Pokemon like Taunt Mewtwo, Skarmory, Forretress, and Scizor. Grass Knot is a reliable and strong move that can be used to, at worst, 3HKO all Kyogre variants while also hitting Groudon and Tyranitar hard. However, it has rather poor coverage and is generally inferior to the other moves listed.</p> <p>Try to keep Ludicolo hidden in the early parts of the game, as the element of surprise is critical to getting a free Substitute against a Pokemon such as Kyogre or Choice Scarf Palkia; your opponent is more likely to lock themselves into Water-type moves if they are not aware that you are using a Ludicolo. Ludicolo greatly appreciates Toxic Spikes support, as it allows Ludicolo to wear down the opposing team with passive damage much more quickly. Forretress is a good option as a Toxic Spikes user due to its access to Rapid Spin, which is greatly appreciated because Ludicolo despises Toxic Spikes itself. Kyogre is a mandatory teammate to allow Ludicolo to take advantage of Rain Dish, which dramatically increases Ludicolo's potency as a wall. Surprisingly, Groudon is also a good teammate due to its ability to handle Pokemon that threaten Ludicolo, such as Taunt Heatran and Bulk Up Dialga. Do note that while Ludicolo is not completely useless outside of rain, the sun Groudon provides is obviously a downside to using it as a teammate. Another good partner is Roar Heatran, which can deal with Substitute users such as Ho-Oh and Shaymin-S lacking Ground-type coverage. Heatran also provides excellent defensive synergy with Ludicolo in general due to its immunity to Poison, resistance to Flying, and quadruple resistance to Bug. In return, Ludicolo resists common Water- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Heatran.</p> "

Its access to Nasty Plot, Swords Dance, STAB on both Grass-type and Dark-type moves, and blistering Speed in the sun make it a good choice on Drought-abusing teams. However, Shiftry is quite literally a fair-weather friend: if rain, sandstorm, or a Pokemon with Air Lock is on the field, expect a speedy demise for Shiftry. Even in the sun, Shiftry can be countered and walled, so do not overestimate what you can do with it. Nonetheless, if you give Shiftry the support it needs, you will be pleasantly surprised at what the Chlorophyll abuser can do.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Unless you are running a mixed set, there's little reason to deviate from the standard EVs. Using a positive Speed nature will let you outpace Scarfed Shaymin-S and Gengar in the sun, but they are rare enough to make the point almost moot.</p> <p>There are not many other moves that wouldn't be considered rather situational. Focus Blast is viable to score an OHKO on Dialga after a Nasty Plot, but the accuracy can be disappointing, and Shiftry will often find that it cannot afford to miss. Hidden Power Fire can OHKO Scizor, Forretress, and the rare Skarmory, but has very little use outside of that. A SubSeed set is theoretically viable, but Jumpluff is a superior choice for this role because of its access to Encore and Sleep Powder.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Countering Shiftry in the sun is surprisingly difficult. If you have to defeat Shiftry in its favored weather, Scizor and Dialga make great choices, as they both laugh at Shiftry's attacks and OHKO in return. Blissey walls the Nasty Plot set, while Giratina defeats the Swords Dance one, but be wary of switching into the wrong set. If you can remove the sun, Shiftry becomes a sitting duck, and Kyogre and Rayquaza can both revenge kill Shiftry fairly easily.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<p>At first glance, using Shiftry in Ubers seems to be a foolish endeavor. However, very few Ubers learn Nasty Plot, and in the sun, Shiftry is able to reach 518 Speed with a neutral nature, easily outpacing threats such as Choice Scarf Garchomp, Rock Polish Groudon, and even Deoxys-S, and OHKOing each aforementioned Pokemon with the proper move.</p> <p>Dark Pulse is an excellent move to use against Pokemon such as Giratina-O, Giratina, Latias, and other Psychic-types, OHKOing all of them after a Nasty Plot. However, if you know your opponent is packing a Kyogre, you may wish to use Grass Knot first for a surprise attack, as Kyogre, who summons rain, outspeeds Shiftry outside of the sun and can end its sweep if it uses Nasty Plot. With a Life Orb, Shiftry OHKOes a 252/0 Kyogre 46.15% of the time with Stealth Rock damage (a guaranteed OHKO on any other variant). If a defensive Kyogre is not OHKOed, Shiftry can strike again with a Grass Knot, as it outpaces such a Kyogre. It's worth noting that Solar Beam is not recommended, because Grass Knot hits most Ubers for the same Base Power anyway, and if Shiftry gets stuck charging against an incoming Kyogre or Rayquaza, you will lose Shiftry.</p> <p>The final slot has two potential options. Hidden Power Ice is useful if you predict a Rayquaza switch-in. Otherwise, Explosion can be employed to get past Blissey and open the door for another special attacker to sweep (use Rash over Modest if you use Explosion). Focus Blast is great against Dialga, Darkrai, and Heatran, but the inaccuracy can really be detrimental to Shiftry's sweeping chances. Substitute can help in easing prediction, and with it this set can be employed as a lure for Rayquaza with Hidden Power Ice over one of the first three moves. Hidden Power Fire can be used to surprise incoming Metagross and Scizor, OHKOing the former in the sun after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes.</p> <p>What makes this set unique is that it is not only a sweeper, but also a check to threats. Specifically, this Shiftry outpaces a standard +2 Groudon and ends its sweep with Grass Knot. Also, Shiftry doesn't fear Wobbuffet due to its Dark-typing, which grants it immunity to Mirror Coat. However, this set requires quite a bit of support to work well. First of all, Groudon is a requirement to use alongside this set: without the sun, Shiftry is dead weight on your team. Other than that, the use of Stealth Rock, and possibly Spikes, is highly recommended. Deoxys-S does an excellent job of setting up both, which can make it quite a bit easier to OHKO threats such as the aforementioned Kyogre. Shiftry is quite frail and difficult to switch in, and it is even more difficult to find the time to use Nasty Plot to ensure a sweep. Therefore, the use of Wobbuffet is recommended to get Shiftry safely on the field and ensure that you get a free turn to use Nasty Plot via Encoring a non-attacking move.</p> <p>Scizor is a nightmare for this set, resisting both of Shiftry's STAB moves and OHKOing with Bullet Punch or U-turn, or even striking your switch-in and going to a counter, thus giving your opponent control of the match. Fortunately, setting up Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes and going to Groudon can make it difficult for Scizor to repeatedly do this. Other than that, defensively oriented Calm Mind users such as Giratina-O and Kyogre are a problem, and you will need to be lucky with Dark Pulse's 20% flinch chance (or its intrinsic critical hit chance) to have a shot at defeating them. Therefore, the use of Encore and Mirror Coat on Wobbuffet is once again recommended. To ensure that you are not placing too much on the blue blob's plate, you can consider using a Palkia, who can defeat Giratina-O with Outrage and Kyogre with Thunder.</p> <p>Blissey walls this set without the use of Explosion, so you will need a way to get past her. Fortunately, a mixed Palkia with Outrage can 2HKO Blissey. Otherwise, you should consider the use of a mixed Dialga with Brick Break or a Scizor alongside a Tickle Wobbuffet. Finally, Rayquaza can defeat and set up on Shiftry, so make sure that you have a check for it. A defensive Groudon can defeat the Dragon Dance variant, while Swords Dance variants can be revenge killed by a Choice Scarf Dialga. Lugia and Scarf Jirachi can also handle most Rayquaza if necessary. As a last resort, Scizor can use Bullet Punch, but it will not OHKO without prior damage.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While Shiftry primarily runs a special set, it also has access to Swords Dance to hit hard from the physical side. This set plays fairly similarly to the Nasty Plot variant, though it handles Blissey and Dialga better at the cost of overall power and a worse match-up against Giratina and Rayquaza.</p> <p>Shiftry's options for STAB attacks aren't stellar, but they get the job done. After a Swords Dance, Seed Bomb OHKOes Groudon, Palkia, Blissey, and Kyogre (among others). Speaking of Kyogre, this set's strategy of dealing with it is similar to that of the Nasty Plot: use Seed Bomb on the first turn. Offensive Kyogre are OHKOed, while defensive sets are outsped and 2HKOed. Your other main attack is Feint Attack, which, after a Swords Dance, OHKOes Lugia, Mewtwo, Latias, Wobbuffet, and Giratina-O. Unfortunately, it only 2HKOes Giratina, who can use Will-O-Wisp and stall Shiftry out. Finally, Low Kick is your best option against Dialga, Heatran, and Darkrai, all of whom are OHKOed after one turn of setup. Explosion is usable alongside Sucker Punch simply due to the power, but note that it hits many of the same targets as Feint Attack, so using both is redundant.</p> <p>Sucker Punch, though it takes prediction to use successfully, is a viable option over Feint Attack. It is mainly useful against faster opponents and in unfavorable weather, scoring an OHKO on Palkia and offensive Kyogre. Due to the ubiquity of those two Pokemon, Sucker Punch is a solid choice. However, Feint Attack remains the superior option because it deals more consistent damage to threats who aren't guaranteed to attack you, like the aforementioned Mewtwo, Latias, Wobbuffet, and Giratina-O.</p> <p>While Shiftry is a demigod in the sun, it is decidedly average outside of the sun. Kyogre can enter after a KO, cutting Shiftry's Speed in half with the rain and thus ending a possibility of a sweep. It goes without saying that your team should possess a strong Kyogre check, such as Latias or Palkia. In fact, you may even choose to consider a Kyogre lure, such as Ho-Oh with Brave Bird or Heatran with Hidden Power Grass, since Kyogre is such a threat to Drought-abusing teams. Rayquaza is also a potent threat to Shiftry (if you don't have Sucker Punch) since Air Lock nullifies the sun, but fortunately Groudon is a decent check to it. If you have additional concerns about Swords Dance or Dragon Dance Rayquaza, you should consider a Scarfed Dialga or Palkia, respectively. Finally, to defeat Steel-types such as Scizor and Metagross, you can consider a Latias or Latios with Hidden Power Fire as a lure.</p> <p>Other than that, the partners for this set generally mirror those of the last set. Stealth Rock and Spikes support are recommended to neuter Scizor, who still counters this Shiftry. Deoxys-S, Froslass, and Forretress do a good job of setting up the aforementioned entry hazards, but keep in mind that Forretress has little offensive presence, and may get set up on. Groudon support is a necessity to provide the sun, and Wobbuffet is recommended to help you set up.</p> "

This bug is able to pass Speed (and maybe even Attack) boosts to sweepers such as Dialga and Rayquaza far more easily than it can in OU for a number of reasons. For one, all Ubers Taunt users, being Psychic- or Dark-type, are 2HKOed by X-Scissor, meaning that Taunting Ninjask is risky. For another, there are only 3 commonly seen phazers in Ubers: Groudon, Latias, and Lugia. Latias is 2HKOed by X-Scissor, and the others are easy to set up on by Taunt users of your own.</p> <p>The first move you should use is Substitute, unless facing a Deoxys-S or Mew lead; use X-Scissor instead on their expected Taunt. The only move that is up for debate is the move in the second slot. Swords Dance can be used if a switch or a support move is predicted, and it can potentially result in a sweep. Finally, Protect can be used to help you outpace and defeat TrickScarf Darkrai leads by setting up a Substitute, and gain Leftovers recovery.</p> <p>Liechi Berry guarantees that you will pass at least one Attack boost to a sweeper, while Leftovers is a reliable choice to help you set up more Substitutes and pass off more Speed. The EVs for this set are very carefully chosen. 108 Defense EVs ensures that an Extreme Speed from Lead Rayquaza and Deoxys-A max out at 74.90%, meaning that you can put up a Substitute and Baton Pass away +1 Attack and +1 Speed (and give your sweeper a crucial free switch-in), more if you have Protect. 176 Speed lets you outspeed Deoxys-A leads, and 226 Attack EVs ensure that every Taunt user is 2HKOed by X-Scissor.</p> <p>Ninjask works very well on support-oriented \"Baton Pass\" teams, which are often filled with Taunt users to cover for Ninjask's weaknesses against Groudon and Lugia. Good support Pokemon to use alongside Ninjask include the blisteringly fast Dual Screen Mewtwo and a Pure Baton Pass Mew, both of whom can work well to set up a sweep later. Deoxys-S remains an excellent choice to set up entry hazards, as does Forretress, who can also Rapid Spin. The primary recipients of Ninjask's boosts should be sweepers capable of running through the Ubers tier, such as Dialga, Rayquaza, and Groudon. Dialga is recommended due to its excellent typing, and Rayquaza due to its fantastic offensive power. Groudon is another solid choice, but is often overshadowed by the former two.</p> "

Once they're trapped, Wynaut can then appropriately use Counter or Mirror Coat to KO the opponent, and if all goes accordingly, leave itself with low enough HP for Custap Berry to activate the next turn. This will allow Wynaut to go first the next turn and take the next Pokemon down with Destiny Bond unless they use a priority move. Wynaut can also Encore a support move from a wall and give a sweeper on your team a free turn, much like Wobbuffet.</p> <p>The EVs give Wynaut maximum overall bulk, with some bias towards the special side.

Wynaut will also survive an Outrage from Choice Scarf Garchomp, regardless of whether Stealth Rock is up or not.</p> <p>Since Wynaut's main attraction is his ability to trap and remove revenge killers, Pokemon that can take advantage of this are obvious teammates. Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Salamence can sweep without fear of being revenge killed once Choice Scarf Garchomp or Palkia are out of the way, as is the case for Swords Dance Lucario and Rayquaza with Choice Scarf Dialga is removed. Mewtwo and Darkrai can sweep more easily should Choice Band Scizor be eliminated, though Wynaut would be wise not to come in on a U-turn, and Rock Polish Groudon can plow through opposing teams should Choice Scarf Shaymin-S be removed. Note that Wynaut has problems taking out Choice Scarf Kyogre when it is locked into a Water-type move, so a Pokemon such as Latias or Palkia is useful to deal with it.</p> <p>Since priority moves can take out Wynaut even after its Custap Berry has activated, Pokemon can stand up to common priority moves are ideal teammates. Dialga, Salamence, Manaphy, and Kyogre can all set up on Scizor's Bullet Punch, while Darkrai and Tyranitar can easily put pressure on a Giratina-O looking to use Shadow Sneak. Strong Steel-types, such as Jirachi and Metagross, are also useful to take on Rayquaza and Deoxys-A, common users of Extreme Speed. Wynaut is also stopped cold by Taunt. Common users of Taunt in the Uber tier are Deoxys-S and Mewtwo. Scizor is a good choice to take on the both of them, as it can use U-turn to put them in a checkmate position, dealing massive damage to them if they stay in, and scouting out the switch-in if they switch out. Rapid Spin and dedicated anti-leads can also stop the setup of entry hazards which will whittle down Wynaut's health. Forretress is the premier Rapid Spinner in the Uber tier, while leads like Deoxys-S, Shaymin-S, and Darkrai can all prevent the opponent getting up entry hazards reliably.</p> <p>An interesting option would be to use Wobbuffet and Wynaut together on the same team. You can use Wynaut to take out revenge killers, while Wobbuffet can provide free turns for your own sweeper to set up. However, this is a team slot that could've been used for a more powerful sweeper, tank, or supporter.</p> "

  "Salamence": {
    "overview": "<p>Salamence has one big selling point in the Ubers metagame: pairing it with Rayquaza forms an effective offensive partnership that is almost impossible to counter! This strategy is not without its drawbacks though - since Salamence and Rayquaza have the same typing, this means that your team will have at least two Rock-, Ice- and Dragon-type weaknesses. Due to this fact, Salamence cannot just be thrown in any team, it should be paired with Rayquaza and have a team centered around covering their drawbacks.</p> <p>Even though Salamence is mostly outclassed by Rayquaza, do not let this fool you into thinking that it is not a threat. Salamence is still very capable of tearing its opponents to shreds in the Ubers metagame, whether it's with its Dragon Dance set or its mixed set. Overall, Salamence is an unorthodox yet deadly Pokemon in Ubers.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Salamence has access to one move that sets it apart from Rayquaza: Roost. Roost can be used on a mixed Salamence set to restore its health on Pokemon it may force out, or on Pokemon who do little harm to it (such as Forretress without Explosion or Skarmory). This can be especially useful against stall teams, who sometimes rely on Stealth Rock damage to wear down Salamence. There are two main issues with Roost though. First of all, Roost can be hard to find time to use, as Salamence must often predict a switch to use it. Secondly, Roost does not pair well with Outrage. When Salamence uses Outrage, it will often be revenge killed before it can find time to use Roost. It's possible to use Brick Break over Outrage for this purpose (to 2HKO Blissey), but this leaves Salamence walled by Ho-Oh.</p> <p>Salamence has several alternative attacks at its disposal. Stone Edge can be a good option on Dragon Dance Salamence, as a +1 Stone Edge OHKOes Timid Lugia around 87% of the time after it takes Stealth Rock damage and Leftovers recovery. Dragon Claw can be used on the Dragon Dance set to OHKO most Dragon-types without being force to lock Salamence into Outrage. If using Dragon Claw over Fire Blast or Flamethrower, Magnezone or Magneton support is recommended for eliminating most Steel-types. In a similar manner, Crunch can be used to OHKO Mewtwo after a Dragon Dance. Hydro Pump can be used on mixed Salamence to 2HKO Skarmory, Forretress, Scizor and Metagross in the rain if you must have Kyogre on your team. Hydro Pump will also OHKO Heatran in the rain.</p> <p>If your team has problems with stall, Dragon Fang can be a reasonable option on mixed Salamence, though it will lose out on a few KOs. Both Yache Berry and Haban Berry are reasonable items to use on Salamence, but Rayquaza is often better off using them, as Salamence prefers the added power of Life Orb.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Salamence's counters are extremely similar to Rayquaza's. In other words, there aren't actually many Salamence counters at all! Salamence only has two hard counters in Ubers. Cresselia is able to survive any of Salamence's attacks, and can then OHKO Salamence with Ice Beam after Stealth Rock. Timid Lugia works in a similar fashion, but it must avoid Stone Edge after a boost. Bold Lugia can defeat Dragon Dance Salamence, but it has a chance of being defeated by mixed Salamence after it takes Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Generally, the best way to deal with Salamence is to force it to use Outrage, and then switch to a Steel-type Pokemon. Scizor is one of the best choices for this, as it can 2HKO Salamence with a Choice Band-boosted Bullet Punch. Metagross and Jirachi are also reasonable choices due to Ice Punch. Skarmory is particularly notable because it will usually wall Salamence in the rainy weather. Although not a Steel-type, defensive Groudon is notable for its ability to survive a +1 Outrage from Salamence. Groudon can then choose to hit it with Stone Edge or cripple it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Like Rayquaza, it's often easier to revenge kill Salamence than try and counter it. Choice Scarf Garchomp is a particularly good choice, as it outspeeds Salamence even after it uses a Dragon Dance and will OHKO Salamence with Outrage. In a similar manner, Choice Scarf users with a base Speed of over 100 and an Ice-type attack are good revenge killers. Good examples of this are Mewtwo, Darkrai, Shaymin-S and Gengar. Weavile and Mamoswine are notable for their ability to revenge kill Salamence without the use of Choice Scarf, thanks to their STAB Ice Shard.</p> ",

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>As a Dragon Dance sweeper, Salamence is normally outclassed by Rayquaza. However, when used alongside Rayquaza, Dragon Dance Salamence can be a powerful asset in the Uber metagame. Dragon Dance Salamence's main advantage over Garchomp as a Rayquaza partner lies in the Speed boost that Dragon Dance gives it. Unlike Garchomp, Salamence will outspeed and OHKO Pokemon such as Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Choice Scarf Kyogre after one turn of set-up.</p> <p>Although Salamence may not be as powerful as Rayquaza, Outrage will still do an insane amount of damage to any Pokemon who doesn't resist it. After one Dragon Dance, Salamence with Life Orb will always OHKO Shaymin-S, Darkrai, offensive Mewtwo and max HP Kyogre with Outrage. A +1 Outrage will also deal 79.13% - 93.5% to 112 HP Groudon, and 54.95% - 64.85% to an Impish Groudon with max HP and max Defense. Even the standard max HP / 64 Defense Timid Lugia, which normally gives Salamence trouble, suffers 71.4% - 84.4% from a boosted Outrage (approximately a 20% chance to KO after Stealth Rock damage and Leftovers recovery)! Earthquake's main purpose is to hit grounded Steel-types, such as Dialga and Metagross, harder than Outrage would. A boosted Earthquake will always OHKO max HP Metagross and min HP Dialga, after Stealth Rock damage; however, a max HP Dialga will be OHKOed by a +1 Earthquake around 92% of the time after it takes Stealth Rock damage. The final moveslot is a choice between Fire Blast and Flamethrower. Even with a Special Attack reducing nature, Fire Blast will deal 88.02% - 104.19% to a specially defensive Skarmory in the sun. If you only wish to OHKO Scizor and Forretress in the sun (or 2HKO them in the rain), then Flamethrower is a fine choice for its perfect accuracy.</p> <p>As mentioned before, the most important part of Salamence is to use it with Rayquaza. Rayquaza and Salamence are very similar Pokemon, both being nearly uncounterable Dragon-types that can defeat or greatly weaken each other's checks and thus open up sweeps for the other. A great Rayquaza set to use with Dragon Dance Salamence is mixed Rayquaza. Rayquaza will often lure in defensive Groudon and Lugia, both potential problems for Dragon Dance Salamence. Defensive Groudon, while 2HKOed by a +1 Outrage, is able to cripple Salamence with Thunder Wave. Meanwhile, Lugia OHKOs Salamence with Ice Beam after it takes Stealth Rock damage. Mixed Rayquaza will deal such a massive amount of damage to Groudon with Draco Meteor that if Groudon lives, it will no longer be able to survive against a boosted Salamence. Meanwhile, Rayquaza will 2HKO slower Lugia with Draco Meteor after it takes damage from Stealth Rock. You can also make Rayquaza use Fire Blast to crisp Steel-type Pokemon as they switch in. With the removal of Lugia and/or Groudon, Dragon Dance Salamence is much harder to stop. Swords Dance / Dragon Dance Rayquaza can also be a good teammate for Dragon Dance Salamence, simply because many teams have a hard time handling two, powerful Dragon-type sweepers. There is another type of Rayquaza that has not been mentioned but is still a great teammate for Salamence: Haban Berry Rayquaza. After the use of a Dragon Dance, opponents will often attempt to revenge kill it with Choice Scarf Palkia or Choice Scarf Garchomp. Thanks to Haban Berry, Rayquaza will live through any of their attacks (bar a Draco Meteor from Palkia after Stealth Rock damage), and then OHKO both of them. With Choice Scarf Palkia and Choice Scarf Garchomp out of the way, Salamence will have a much easier time sweeping.</p> <p>Something to note about Dragon Dance Salamence is that, unlike Rayquaza, Salamence will Speed tie with Choice Scarf Palkia after a Dragon Dance. This is significant because if Choice Scarf Palkia loses the Speed tie, then not only will Salamence have a good chance of sweeping, but it can also open up a sweep for its teammates. A great example of this is Dragon Dance Rayquaza, who is often only checked by Choice Scarf Palkia on most teams. Dragon Dance Rayquaza can also help out Salamence due to its chance of OHKOing Lugia with a boosted Stone Edge (or Outrage if Rayquaza is Adamant) after it takes damage from Stealth Rock. Darkrai, Choice Specs Kyogre, and mixed Palkia can also take advantage of Dragon Dance Salamence defeating Choice Scarf Palkia. Salamence is also capable of pulling off the same trick against Choice Scarf Jirachi. With Choice Scarf Jirachi out of the way, Rayquaza will have a much easier time sweeping.</p> <p>In addition to having the aforementioned problems with Lugia and defensive Groudon, Dragon Dance Salamence will also have problems with Choice Scarf Garchomp. Thanks to Choice Scarf and Garchomp's superior Speed stat, it will outspeed Salamence, even after a Dragon Dance, and OHKO with Outrage. Choice Scarf Mewtwo, Gengar, Shaymin-S, and Darkrai will outspeed Salamence after a Dragon Dance as well and OHKO it with an Ice-type attack. The most common way of defeating Dragon Dance Salamence in Ubers is to switch to a Steel-type as Salamence uses Outrage. Scizor and Skarmory can especially be problematic; in the rain, Skarmory will wall Salamence's entire moveset with ease and Whirlwind it away while on the other hand, Scizor is 2HKOed by a boosted Outrage, but it will 2HKO Salamence with a Choice Band boosted Bullet Punch (and will even have a chance to OHKO Salamence after Salamence takes Life Orb and Stealth Rock damage).</p> <p>Wobbuffet is heavily recommended as a Salamence partner because of these problems, and for other reasons. Wobbuffet is able to revenge kill Choice Scarf Garchomp, Choice Scarf Gengar, Choice Scarf Shaymin-S, and Choice Scarf Mewtwo thanks to Counter, Mirror Coat, and Shadow Tag, and can also defeat Choice Band Scizor that are locked into Bullet Punch. Tickle Wobbuffet can be paired with a Pursuit user (such as Scizor or Metagross) to effectively defeat Lugia. Finally, Wobbuffet can set up both Salamence and Rayquaza by Encoring a weak attack or support move. This is particularly notable against a weakened Groudon, which Wobbuffet can take advantage of by Encoring Earthquake, giving Salamence the perfect opportunity to set up. Scizor, Metagross, and other offensive Steel-types will work well with Salamence due to their ability to deal a heavy amount of damage to Garchomp that is locked into Outrage, and for their ability to take Scizor's Bullet Punch. Scizor is especially notable for being able to Pursuit Mewtwo, Gengar and Shaymin-S that are locked into an Ice-type attack that was aimed at Salamence, and for its ability to defeat Choice Scarf Darkrai. Metagross and Tyranitar are also capable of dealing with Choice Scarf Gengar and Choice Scarf Mewtwo with Pursuit. Dialga not only sports a helpful resistance to Bullet Punch, but can also use a mixed set with Bulk Up to lure in Groudon and Skarmory, only to crush them with Draco Meteor and a sun-boosted Fire Blast respectively. Groudon's 140 base Defense stat allows it to take Scizor's Bullet Punch with ease, and is also capable of OHKOing Skarmory switch-ins with Overheat. Kyogre can take on both Lugia's Ice Beams and Scizor's Bullet Punches, and threaten blast them with its rain-boosted STAB Surfs. Kyogre will also have no problem switching into Choiced Ice-type attacks from Darkrai, Mewtwo and Shaymin-S. Finally, Mewtwo is not only capable of setting up on Lugia via Taunt and Calm Mind, but can also act as a good Scizor lure with Flamethrower or Fire Blast.</p> "

        "name": "Wallbreaker",
        "description": "<p>Unlike the last set, this set puts Salamence in the role of helping Rayquaza sweep. Salamence may seem outclassed as a mixed attacking partner for Rayquaza when compared to more powerful wallbreakers, such as Dialga and Palkia, but Salamence sports two key advantages over them. First, since Dialga and Palkia's most common sets are either pure special attackers or Choiced sets, Pokemon such as Wobbuffet and Blissey - who give Rayquaza no problems - may switch in. On the other hand, Salamence is treated similarly to Rayquaza, which allows it to badly damage Rayquaza's counters. Unlike Garchomp, Salamence is capable of harming Rayquaza's checks without a turn of set up. The other big selling point of mixed Salamence as a Rayquaza partner is Dragon Dance, which can allow Salamence to sweep a weakened team later in the match.</p> <p>While Salamence's base 110 Special Attack may seem meager when compared to the more powerful Dragon-types of Ubers, Draco Meteor still does a huge amount of damage to any Pokemon who doesn't resist it (with the exception of Blissey). For example, max HP Groudon (a common Salamence switch-in) will take 71.29% - 84.16% from Draco Meteor, allowing Rayquaza to possibly sweep due to Groudon either being 2HKOed by Salamence, or being put into the KO range of Rayquaza's attacks. Draco Meteor will also OHKO several common Choice Scarfed switch-ins that expect Salamence to use Dragon Dance, such as Darkrai, Garchomp and Shaymin-S (around 87% of the time without Stealth Rock). Finally, Draco Meteor will have around a 53% chance to OHKO 4 HP Mewtwo after it takes Stealth Rock damage. Fire Blast is Salamence's main move against the Steel-types that resist Draco Meteor - in the rain, only the most specially defensive Scizor will survive Fire Blast while Forretress will take 83.62% - 99.44%. In the sunny weather, Fire Blast will OHKO Scizor, Forretress, Metagross, Skarmory, and even 2HKO Groudon.</p> <p>Outrage is Salamence's physical move of choice, as it will still do a large amount of damage despite the minimal Attack investment. Outrage is Salamence's best move against Blissey, dealing 66.41% - 78.22%. Outrage is also important for its ability to KO many important Pokemon after they take damage from Draco Meteor. For example, the standard Bold Max HP Lugia with 52 Defense EVs is KOed by a combination of Draco Meteor and Outrage around 98% of the time after factoring in Stealth Rock damage and Leftovers recovery. Additionally, Ho-Oh, maximum HP Kyogre, minimum Special Defense Dialga and Calm Wobbuffet (after Stealth Rock damage) are KOed by Outrage after switching into Draco Meteor. Be warned though, Draco Meteor plus Outrage will only have around a 58% chance and 57% chance to KO specially defensive Dialga and Bold Lugia with maximum HP and maximum Defense respectively after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Although this Salamence has little investment in its Attack, it is still capable of sweeping weakened teams if necessary. After one Dragon Dance, Salamence's Outrage will still always OHKO offensive Mewtwo, minimum HP Kyogre, Shaymin-S and Darkrai. Salamence's boosted Outrage will also always OHKO max HP Kyogre after it takes Stealth Rock damage. Note that it is best to Dragon Dance when your opponent's team is already weakened, as Salamence's Outrage isn't as powerful as it is on the pure Dragon Dance Salamence. Because of this, Dragon Dance's main purpose is to allow Salamence to smash through weakened teams, not to focus on sweeping right away.</p> <p>When using this Salamence, the best Rayquaza to use with it is Swords Dance Rayquaza. This is because Salamence can defeat slower Lugia and defensive Groudon if they switch into Draco Meteor. When either of these Pokemon are eliminated, Swords Dance Rayquaza will have a much easier time sweeping. Dragon Dance Rayquaza will also appreciate Salamence's ability to remove defensive Groudon from play.</p> <p>This Salamence set will have serious issues with Timid Lugia and Heatran. Timid Lugia will not be OHKOed by any of Salamence's attacks and can then outspeed and OHKO Salamence with Ice Beam. Heatran resists this Salamence's entire moveset and can then deal a lot of damage with Dragon Pulse or Roar Salamence away. Kyogre makes a very good teammate for Salamence in this case, as it can not only counter Heatran in most cases (as long as it avoids Toxic or Explosion), but can also crush Lugia with Thunder. Be warned though, the rain will make Salamence's Fire Blast weaker. Wobbuffet is, once again, a helpful partner for its ability to help Salamence set up; if Wobbuffet has Tickle, it can be paired with a user of Pursuit to defeat Lugia. Like the last set, Mewtwo and Darkrai can help defeat Lugia by setting up on it with Taunt and Dark Void respectively.</p> "

  "Latias": {
    "overview": "<p>With Soul Dew attached, Latias is one of the most useful and versatile Pokemon in the Ubers tier, being able to check a huge number of dangerous threats, most notably Kyogre, while threatening to sweep at a moment's notice. Latias is also a brilliant support Pokemon, being able to pass Wish to teammates or set up screens to assist in a sweep. There is a place for Latias on any Ubers team and she will always perform her job well. She may not carry as much raw firepower as her brother Latios, but what she lacks in strength, she more than makes up for in bulk.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Roar allows Latias to phaze other Calm Minders trying to set up on her, such as Blissey and Arceus. Psycho Shift allows Latias to transfer status inflicted on her to the opponent, but as an anti-status move, it pales in comparison to Refresh and Safeguard. Hidden Power Fire and Dragon Pulse are unresisted by anything but Heatran, and will help Latias fend off those nasty Steels such as Metagross, Scizor and Forretress. However, Latias will lose the ability to beat Calm Mind / Rest Kyogre one on one. Psychic allows Latias to hurt Arceus-Fighting. Don't bother with Ice Beam--it fails to OHKO Groudon so one might as well use Dragon Pulse for the better coverage in the Uber metagame.</p> <p>Latias is fairly adept at setting up a Light Screen with her massive Special Defense, allowing her to take special attacks like they're banana peels flung at her. Reflect is also an option, but her significantly lower Defense does not help with that. Lugia sets up Reflect better thanks to its much higher Defense. Healing Wish is quite gimmicky, as most of the time, sacrificing Latias is not worth it. Finally, Latias learns Charm, but Reflect is generally superior to it because the opponent could switch out of Charm, and the fact that Charm fails to touch Metagross thanks to Clear Body.</p> <p>Trick is viable, allowing Latias to become a revenge killer of sorts with Choice Scarf, which is especially helpful against common threats like Dragon Dance Rayquaza. Blissey will detest Choice Scarf, which could well open a sweep for the likes of Kyogre easier. However, Latias won't like being without Soul Dew, and often enough Latios is slightly better at drawing in Blissey.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>If Blissey has Toxic, she will always beat Latias without Safeguard, Refresh, or Psycho Shift. Even if she has Safeguard, Icy Wind can allow Blissey to get in a Toxic before Latias can refresh the Safeguard after it expires the first time. Thunder Wave Blissey can be annoying, as being fully paralyzed can spell your doom if they also have Seismic Toss. Tyranitar and its massive Special Defense will allow it to easily switch into Latias and beat her down with a Choice Banded Crunch. Even a Soul Dew boosted Grass Knot is incapable of 2HKOing Tyranitar (assuming that he is carrying Special Defense EVs). If Latias is not packing Thunder or Hidden Power Fire, Scizor can switch in and deal massive damage with U-turn, or punish a fleeing Latias with Pursuit.</p> <p>Metagross is a great check thanks to resistance to Dragon Pulse, Grass Knot, and Ice Beam, meaning it really only has to worry about Thunder and Hidden Power Fire. It has a chance to OHKO Latias with a Choice Band Meteor Mash (guaranteed after Stealth Rock damage), and a Choice Band Pursuit will do even more on the switch. Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Bug can Calm Mind alongside Latias and eventually beat her down with a super effective Judgment. Arceus-Ghost takes less than 50% from an unboosted Dragon Pulse and 2HKOs back with Shadow Claw. Arceus-Steel will resist a lot of Latias's attacks, much in the same way Metagross does. Registeel's massive Special Defense allows it to take anything but Thunder and Hidden Power Fire (unless the weather is favorable for Registeel), and beat Latias with Ice Punch.</p> <p>As for the revenge killing, Deoxys-A and its high Attack will OHKO Latias with Choice Band Ice Punch. Additionally, Choice Scarf Heracross can Megahorn Latias before she does anything. The move Knock Off really hurts Latias, as Soul Dew is her key to success. However, it should be not much of a worry, as the only notable user of Knock Off is Deoxys-D, who is quite uncommon.</p> ",

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>Latias steps forth from ADV into the treacherous grounds of the DPP Ubers. In the faces of Kyogre and Palkia, she stands in their way from completely ripping apart an Uber team. With her incredible hold item, Soul Dew, Palkia's Life Orb-boosted Spacial Rend also fails to OHKO. Using her Speed, she can threaten an OHKO on Palkia with Dragon Pulse before Palkia delivers a finishing blow (watch out for Choice Scarf variants). Draco Meteor can be used to better handle foes like support Dialga, Haban Berry Garchomp, and healthy Darkrai. As for Kyogre, she stands without fear as its Ice Beam only does approximately 48% maximum, allowing Latias to Calm Mind and then Thunder Kyogre into oblivion. With the help of Recover or Roost, Latias restores her health back into usability, and thus shines again in the battlefield, ready to take something else down. If the user is satisfied with only one offensive move, Refresh rids her of annoying status conditions like Toxic that malevolent beasts such as Arceus-Fighting and Blissey enjoy inflicting on Latias, and the paralysis she might face when trying to switch into Kyogre's or Palkia's Thunder. Although Safeguard cannot stop any status she switches in on, it supports her team and keeps her safe for five turns so it is a decent alternative to Refresh. Latias can also make decent use of Substitute, although these variants of Latias are rare, and generally you will want to run the other suggested moves.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is not mentioned anywhere in this set for a reason: Thunder does better. Yes, sunlight can appear to ruin Thunder's accuracy, but one should know that the main reason Thunder is used is for Kyogre, Metagross, and the 30% paralysis chance. All Thunderbolt does is 2HKO Metagross after a Calm Mind, which isn't enough to prevent a Choice Banded Meteor Mash from crashing down on Latias.</p> <p>Without Refresh or Safeguard, Latias goes down fast to Toxic and other statuses. Blissey carrying Aromatherapy solves this problem and is well worth considering. Although Thunder can deal with Metagross, Steel-types (mainly Scizor, as the others are relatively rare) are perennially problematic for her and can be trapped and obliterated by Magnezone, which also can come in on Dark, Dragon, Bug, Ice, and Ghost attacks, all of which Latias is weak to and are seen regularly enough in Ubers. It can also lure in Blissey and Explode her into oblivion. Tyranitar, Blissey, and Metagross make Latias's life much harder, and in Ubers, she also struggles against Dialga. Choice Band Adamant Dugtrio ensnares these with Arena Trap and takes every single one out, although it generally has to revenge kill. Neither Wobbuffet nor Latias like Scizor, but Wobbuffet can often grab a free turn for Latias once Scizor's gone.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Dual Screens",
        "description": "<p>With her massive Special Defense, Latias can set up both Reflect and Light Screen with little trouble against many Pokemon in the Ubers environment. After setup, she can then sacrifice herself to pass this long-lasting protection to a much more dangerous threat such as Rock Polish Groudon, Rayquaza, Swords Dance Lucario, and Dragon Dance Salamence, to name a few. This Latias is usually best used mid- to late-game, when the recipient has already done significant damage to the opposing team but is unable to continue. Healing Wish gives it a \"second chance\" at sweeping, allowing the recipient to re-enter the battle at full health and free of any status ailment that it might have received during its first sweep attempt.</p> <p>Reflect, Light Screen, and Healing Wish are obviously the crux of the set. The last slot is up to the user. Dragon Pulse allows Latias to deal damage and not be completely crippled by Taunt. Wish can be used if one wants to give the recipient a relatively safe switch in without sacrificing Latias in the process. Recover allows Latias to heal herself, allowing her to switch in repeatedly and set up screens throughout the game.</p> <p>Light Clay is preferred to extend the duration of Light Screen and Reflect. However, Soul Dew is also acceptable since it allows Latias to serve as an emergency check to Palkia, allowing her to survive a Spacial Rend and OHKO with Dragon Pulse after Stealth Rock damage. It also prevents Latias from being 2HKOed by Choice Scarf Kyogre's Water Spout, allowing Latias to set up screens in its face. The loss of turns for Reflect and Light Screen are not overly detrimental either, since most Ubers do not require much time to set up and sweep anyway. The EVs are there to make Latias as fast as possible. The Special Attack EVs allow Latias to OHKO Palkia after Stealth Rock damage, provided that Soul Dew is equipped. The rest are placed in HP to give Latias the optimum amount of bulk.</p> <p>When they're behind the protection of dual screens, the many absurdly deadly sweepers of the Uber tier become a whole lot more threatening. Rock Polish + Swords Dance Groudon is possibly the best recipient of dual screens support. If Groudon can set up both Rock Polish and Swords Dance (which becomes a lot easier behind dual screens), it is pretty much checkmate for the opponent. Latias can switch into Kyogre and Giratina that threaten to end Groudon's sweep and scare them out, and then proceed to set up Dual Screens. Rayquaza, Dragon Dance Salamence, Swords Dance Lucario, and Darkrai are all extremely deadly sweepers that benefit from dual screens support, as they have more chances to set up as well as becoming harder to revenge kill. Mew is also a great Pokemon to run alongside Dual Screens Latias. Should the opponent somehow stop Mew's first Baton Pass recipient, Mew would generally find it difficult to pass a set of boosts to a second one, due to the fact that it would have been heavily damaged. However, with dual screens and Healing Wish support, Mew can easily pass boosts a second time, since Healing Wish allows it to come back at full health to perform its role again, which almost always results in a win.</p> <p>Pokemon that carry Taunt are always annoyances to Latias and her team. Common Taunt users in the Uber tier are Mewtwo, Mew, and Heatran. Kyogre can take on all three with relative ease, dousing them all with its overpowered Water-type attacks. Tyranitar can also defeat all three, being able to survive a non-Life Orb Mewtwo's Aura Sphere after a Calm Mind, and defeat it with Crunch. Pokemon that provide entry hazards for dual screens recipients are also appreciated. Deoxys-S is the most efficient entry hazard user in the Uber tier, being able to set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes with blistering Speed. Groudon can set up Stealth Rock while stopping Tyranitar and Scizor that often cause Latias problems. Forretress can set up all three kinds of entry hazards while resisting all of Latias's weaknesses.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Latios is one of the strongest sweepers in the entire Ubers tier. His signature item, Soul Dew, boosts his already great Special Attack to stupendous amounts, allowing him to OHKO or 2HKO near anything with the correct move. Soul Dew also grants him a special defense boost, meaning that he can easily switch in to non-super effective special hits (as well as the ubiquitous Earthquake courtesy of Levitate) to easily set up or just KO something with his astonishingly powerful Draco Meteor attack. Latios also outspeeds a huge portion of the Uber metagame, which just makes him even more of a threat.</p> <p>Despite his great power, Latios is not perfect. His typing afflicts him with weaknesses to common Uber attacking types such as Ghost-, Dark-, Dragon-, and Ice-type attacks. That Dark-type weakness makes him vulnerable to Pursuit, meaning that he is easily removed by trappers such as Scizor and Tyranitar. He also won't be getting past Blissey anytime soon either. Furthermore, he has to compete with Latias often for a team slot, as his sister is usually easier to fit in a team thanks to her superior bulk. Despite these flaws, Latios is still a great Pokemon to consider using in any Ubers team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>In the manner of EVs, usually Latios is going to want max Speed with a Speed-boosting nature, as it needs to be as fast as possible to sweep effectively. However, you can run less Speed if you want. There really is no Latios that should be used with lower than 307 Speed. In fact, Latios generally shouldn't be used with lower than 330 Speed. However, if the user feels that Palkia is no threat at all, and would like to conserve Latios' EVs and nature for something else, he/she may want to go with 307 Speed, which requires 204 EVs if Latios has a neutral Speed nature. Next is max Speed with a neutral nature (319 Speed, 252 EVs). This allows Latios to outrun maximum Speed Jolly Rayquaza and tie with other max Speed neutral Speed natured Latios and Latias. After that, one might as well go to 330 Speed, which requires 176 Speed EVs with Timid nature to outspeed a max Speed Hasty or Timid Palkia. 320 Speed does absolutely nothing but outspeed an opposing neutral nature Latias or Latios. Next is 334 Speed, which requires 192 Speed EVs with a positive nature, if one is paranoid of Garchomp in Ubers. This Speed also allows Latios to outrun a max Speed Adamant Choice Scarf Tyranitar.</p> <p>Roar could work on a Calm Mind or Psych Up set, but Latias is better for that, thanks to her higher Special Defense. Heal Block looks interesting on a set with Toxic to kill Blissey, but only use this with Aromatherapy or Safeguard to keep your opponent from killing you with a Toxic of their own. Heal Block can also be used with a set that just uses brute force against the opponent (like the all-out attacker set) to keep Blissey from walling you for long. Refresh can be used on the Calm Mind set to guard Latios against status. However, when using Refresh, Latias is usually better due to her superior bulk and ability to switch into more threats.</p> <p>Trick is possible with Choice Scarf, allowing Latios to become a revenge killer of sorts, especially helpful against common threats like Dragon Dance Rayquaza. Blissey will detest Choice Scarf, which could well open a sweep for the likes of Kyogre easier. However, Latios won't like being without Soul Dew.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>If Blissey has Toxic, she will always beat a Latios without Safeguard, Refresh, or Psycho Shift. Even if he has Safeguard, Icy Wind can allow Blissey to get in a Toxic before Latios can refresh the Safeguard after it expires the first time. Thunder Wave Blissey can be annoying, as being fully paralyzed can spell your doom if Blissey also has Seismic Toss. Psych Up / Calm Mind Blissey with Ice Beam has a high probability of beating Latios as well.</p> <p>Metagross is a great counter, thanks to its resistance to Dragon Pulse, Grass Knot, and Ice Beam, meaning that it really only has to worry about Thunder and Hidden Power Fire. It will OHKO Latios with a Choice Band Meteor Mash or a Choice Band Pursuit on the switch. Scizor works in much the same way as Metagross, though it is more vulnerable to Hidden Power Fire. Forretress can set up entry hazards against Latios if he lacks Hidden Power Fire. Bronzong can set up Light Screen to lessen the power of Latios' attacks and it can wear the Eon Pokemon down with Payback. Tyranitar's Special Defense is boosted thanks to Sand Stream, and it OHKOes Latios with Crunch.</p> <p>Deoxys-A, although incapable of switching into any offensive attack, can come in on Recover, Calm Mind, or any other non-damaging move, and OHKO with a Choice Band or Life Orb Ice Punch. Knock Off and Trick in general really hurt Latios, as Soul Dew is a major part of his success. Deoxys-D commonly carries Knock Off, and Mewtwo and Darkrai are common users of Trick.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>Latios is an amazingly powerful sweeper in the Uber environment. After a single Calm Mind, Latios reaches a jaw-dropping 808 Special Attack stat, and is capable of OHKOing or 2HKOing most of the commonly seen Uber Pokemon. This combined with a base 110 Speed stat gives you one frightening sweeper.</p> <p>Dragon Pulse is a crushingly powerful attack, 2HKOing literally any Pokemon who is not Blissey or a Steel-type. Grass Knot's Base Power climbs to 120 against Kyogre and Groudon, easily OHKOing them both. Grass Knot also 2HKOes Tyranitar, a popular counter to this set. Thunder is also an excellent option over Grass Knot, if one does not fear Tyranitar. Thunder allows Latios to OHKO Lugia and most Scizor, Ho-Oh, and Forretress after Stealth Rock damage and one Calm Mind. You also have the ability to 2HKO Metagross and Heatran without any boosts at all. Most Groudon are OHKOed by Dragon Pulse after one Calm Mind as well. Recover is the preferred option in the last slot so Latios can heal himself while setting up Calm Minds. If one would prefer to OHKO Scizor in the sunlight, one may use Hidden Power Fire over Recover. However, Latios may not get as many chances to set up without Recover to help it stay alive, and the drop in its Speed IV will make it slower than other Latios lacking Hidden Power Fire. If one does not fear Kyogre or Lugia, one may use Hidden Power Fire over Grass Knot or Thunder as well.</p> <p>Latios will run into roadblocks against most Steel-types, such as Scizor, Forretress, Bronzong, and Metagross; however, all of these Steel-types hate boosted Thunders. All of them have a super effective attack with which they can hit Latios with, but Latios needs to watch out for Scizor and Metagross in particular because of Pursuit, which will assuredly KO him if he tries to switch out. Specially Defensive Tyranitar can switch in and OHKO Latios with Crunch, and has the defenses to take one boosted Grass Knot at full HP. Blissey walls Latios thanks to her huge HP and Special Defense stats and can wear him down with Toxic or cripple him with Thunder Wave. Darkrai won't like switching into an attack, but can come in on anything else, send Latios to sleep with Dark Void, and then set up for a sweep using Nasty Plot. Deoxys-D can hamper Latios' ability to sweep and take hits by Knocking Off his Soul Dew and inflicting him with Toxic status. Mewtwo and Darkrai commonly carry Trick, which will take away Latios' Soul Dew and cripple his ability to sweep effectively. Finally, Choice Scarf users, such as Garchomp, Dialga, and Palkia, can easily revenge kill Latios with their powerful STAB Dragon-type strikes. Kyogre is a good teammate for Latios because it can easily check most Steel-types, thanks to it resisting their STAB moves, and being able to smash them with powerful STAB Surfs. Kyogre can also destroy Tyranitar quite easily with Surf, and a Rest + Sleep Talk set with Calm Mind is able to set up on Blissey and Deoxys-D, take status attacks aimed at Latios, and can absorb Darkrai's sleep and do fatal damage back with Surf. Kyogre also provides rain support should Latios want to use Thunder. Scizor is also a good answer to Darkrai, OHKOing it with U-turn (Just be careful because Scizor can't stand up to a +2 Focus Blast). Furthermore, since Scizor usually carries a Choice item itself, it can come in on a predicted Trick Darkrai and Mewtwo and can force them out, also while dealing good damage with Pursuit (This is not always worth it, however, because losing your Choice Band hampers your attacking power). Scizor can also come in on any of Latios' weaknesses, and is capable of dealing with Tyranitar via Bullet Punch and Blissey via Superpower. Wobbuffet can revenge kill any Choice Scarfer, sans Darkrai, by trapping them with his Shadow Tag ability and sending their attacks back at them with Mirror Coat and/or Counter. Wobbuffet can also use Encore to help create an opportunity for Latios to come in and set up. Should Latios get KOed by Pursuit, Lucario can switch in and set up for practically free, due to its 4x resistance to Dark-type attacks.</p> "

        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This set eschews Calm Mind in lieu of being capable of posing an offensive threat right from the start. Draco Meteor is a ridiculously strong attack, as it severely hurts any Pokemon who does not resist it besides Blissey, and it is capable of OHKOing Mewtwo without any prior damage. Grass Knot easily OHKOes Groudon and most Kyogre while also doing significant damage to Tyranitar. Thunder covers Lugia, Ho-Oh, and Manaphy, and also 2HKOes most of the Steel-types in Ubers. Recover allows Latios to live longer to deal more damage. Hidden Power Fire is also a usable option, as it easily OHKOes Scizor and Forretress while giving Latios a way to reliably hurt Steel-types in the sun; however you must watch out, as the drop in Speed will make you lose to other Latios. Dragon Pulse may also used if you want a STAB attack that deals consistent damage, making Latios more usable as a late-game sweeper.</p> <p>This set is very, very hard to switch into due to Latios' sheer power and excellent type coverage. Unfortunately, Blissey can still switch into this set with impunity and throw a debilitating Toxic or Thunder Wave at Latios. Tyranitar can come into any attack, except Grass Knot, and OHKO Latios with Crunch, or it can use Pursuit to KO Latios should it flee from the field of battle. Without Hidden Power Fire, Scizor can come in and 2HKO Latios with a Choice Band Bullet Punch or OHKO with U-turn while not being OHKOed in return by Thunder (Scizor can't switch in on Thunder however, as it is 2HKOed). Scizor has Pursuit with which to chase down Latios as well. After using Draco Meteor once, Wobbuffet can hop in and trap Latios with Shadow Tag, rendering Latios trapped and easy pickings for Mirror Coat. Lucario is an excellent counter to Blissey, as it takes little damage from most of her attacks and is immune to Toxic, and can set up on Blissey using Swords Dance. Lucario can also switch in on Tyranitar's Dark-type attacks, thanks to its 4x resistance, and drop it with one Close Combat (Keep in mind that Lucario is pretty frail). Groudon is an excellent answer to Blissey, Tyranitar, and Scizor, fearing nothing at all from them, thanks to its great defenses and it can destroy all three of them with a powerful STAB Earthquake. Wobbuffet is uncounterable thanks to its Shadow Tag ability, which stops your Pokemon from switching out. However, a mixed Expert Belt Dialga or Lustrous Orb Palkia can help you out, as they are able to bluff a Choice item, which will preserve the unpredictability of whether you will use a physical or special move, allowing you to wipe out Wobbuffet.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Dual Screens + Memento",
        "description": "<p>This set, contrary to the other Latios sets, is not based on sweeping; instead, it is based on Latios's ability to set up another Pokemon for a sweep. This set works exactly how you would think: you bring in Latios and then set up both Reflect and Light Screen. With Light Clay the two moves will each last 8 turns, including the turn in which you used it. After Reflect and Light Screen are up you have the option to use Memento, which causes your Latios to faint, but also lowers your opponent's Attack and Special Attack by two stages each. After your opponent's Pokemon is completely crippled, you're free to bring in a brand new Pokemon. In most cases, bringing in a sweeper or a Baton Pass Pokemon to set up a sweep is a good strategy.</p> <p>The EVs and nature should be fairly straightforward. Timid with 252 EVs in Speed will make sure that you're fast enough to set up on most Pokemon, while the 252 HP EVs give Latios the bulk he needs to run this set. Light Clay is the best option for an item, as it greatly extends the duration of the two screens. An attacking move is used in the last slot so that Latios isn't rendered useless by a faster Taunt-user. Even with no Special Attack investment, Latios' Draco Meteor off its impressive base Special Attack stat will dent most Pokemon who don't resist it. The Special Attack drop is not too worrying as this Latios set likes to switch in and out a lot anyway. If you prefer more consistent damage, Dragon Pulse is also another STAB move that you can use, if you don't want to lower your Special Attack. Similarly, if you would like to lure in and remove Scizor, Hidden Power Fire is a usable option as well. Safeguard is also a viable option to prevent your switch-in from being hit with a status infliction.</p> <p>This set works best on an offensive team with powerful, hard to stop sweepers who take advantage of the added protection of the dual screens. Mew is an excellent teammate for this Latios. With the added protection of Latios' screens and the attack-lowering effects of Memento, Mew can easily boost it stats with Rock Polish and Swords Dance/Nasty Plot, and then pass them to a deadly sweeper, such as Groudon or Dialga, turning them into nigh impossible-to-stop offensive juggernauts; Mew can also find excellent boost recipients in Substitute users, such as Mewtwo and Giratina-O, who only need one turn to pose an enormous threat to your opponent. Pokemon such as Rayquaza, Lucario, or Darkrai will work excellently alongside this set, as the added protection of Reflect and Light Screen allows them more opportunities to stat up as well as making them tougher to revenge kill.</p> <p>This set tends to force a lot of switches, so having entry hazard support alongside this Latios is a great idea. Stealth Rock can be provided by Groudon (who can also stop Scizor and Tyranitar that may want to Pursuit you). Deoxys-S is a great lead for a team with this set that provides Stealth Rock and Spikes. Forretress can provide all three of the entry hazards and also resists all of Latios' weaknesses.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>Using Dragon Dance on something like Latios may seem silly at first, considering that Latios only has a modest base 90 Attack stat, but Latios can actually use Dragon Dance's Speed boost to deadly effect. After one Dragon Dance, Latios hits 525 Speed, allowing him to outspeed and KO all of his normal revenge killers--Darkrai, Mewtwo, common Choice Scarf users such as Dialga, Palkia, Kyogre, and Garchomp, and the standard Kingdra in the rain--before going on to smash through the rest of the opponent's team. With Latios's great bulk, resistances to Grass-, Water-, Fire-, Electric-, and Fighting-type attacks, and an immunity to Ground-type attacks, he isn't short on opportunities to switch in and grab a boost.</p> <p>Dragon Pulse, backed by STAB and Soul Dew, will score an OHKO or a 2HKO on anything that isn't Blissey or a Steel-type. Thunder OHKOes Kyogre, Lugia, Ho-Oh, and Manaphy after they have taken Stealth Rock damage. It also 2HKOes most Steel-types, including Scizor, Metagross, Heatran, and Forretress. Hidden Power Fire allows Latios to fry Scizor and Forretress, while 2HKOing any Steel-type not named Heatran or specially defensive Jirachi in the sunlight. Grass Knot is also a viable option over Thunder, as with it, Latios will OHKO Groudon and Kyogre after Stealth Rock damage. It also 2HKOes any Tyranitar variant. However, using Grass Knot means that you lose coverage against Steel-types in the rain, so only use it if your team is centered around sunlight.</p> <p>There are several other somewhat viable moves that Latios can run on this set. Recover allows Latios to live longer, and after a second Dragon Dance, Latios will outspeed everything in the game aside from Choice Scarf Deoxys-S. However, since Latios is not using Calm Mind to boost his Special Attack, he needs the type coverage provided by using three attacks. Surf can be used over Hidden Power Fire if using a rain-centric team. Heatran is always OHKOed by Surf, while Tyranitar and most other Steel-types will be 2HKOed. Dropping Hidden Power Fire also means that Latios does not have to lower his Speed IV. Thunder will usually do enough damage to Steel-types, though, and running Hidden Power Fire means that Latios will not lose coverage on Steel-type Pokemon in the sunlight. Draco Meteor can be used to muscle past Pokemon that Dragon Pulse may not fell in one shot, such as Dialga and defensive Groudon, but the Special Attack drop will force Latios to switch out. Outrage can also be used to 2HKO Blissey after a Dragon Dance, assuming Stealth Rock is up. If you do opt for Outrage, it should be used alongside a Hasty nature. Latios becomes vulnerable to being revenge killed after locking himself into Outrage, so it should only be used as an absolute last resort to KO the fat pink blob.</p> <p>This set works best with entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock and Spikes to achieve important KOs. Stealth Rock and Spikes can both be set up by Deoxys and Forretress. Froslass is also a good user of Spikes, while Dialga and Groudon can set up Stealth Rock reliably.</p> <p>Latios has a hard time with Blissey, who can take all of Latios's special attacks with ease and cripple him with Toxic or Thunder Wave. Tyranitar hates Grass Knot and Surf, but can come in on anything else and eat Latios with his STAB Crunch. Defensive Jirachi can survive Hidden Power Fire in the sunlight and paralyze Latios with Thunder Wave. Defensive Dialga is a slight issue as well, as Latios cannot OHKO it with Dragon Pulse, despite the fact that he can't be OHKOed back. Wobbuffet can handle a Dragon Pulse and KO Latios with Mirror Coat. Finally, Scarf Mewtwo and Darkrai pose problems for Latios. Although neither can OHKO him, they both outspeed Latios after a Dragon Dance boost and steal his Soul Dew with Trick, thus neutering his offensive power. Scizor is a great partner for this Latios set as a response to Blissey, Tyranitar, and Choice Scarf Mewtwo and Darkrai. Scizor also lures in Fire-type attacks that Latios can easily set up on. Tickle Wobbuffet can trap Blissey and proceed to Tickle away her Defense stat, enabling a follow-up Pursuit OHKO. Groudon is the epitome of a Tyranitar counter thanks to its huge Defense stat and STAB Earthquake. It can also switch in on defensive Jirachi with impunity and provide the sunlight that Latios's Hidden Power Fire so desperately needs. Mixed attackers are great to pair with Latios as they make great lures for his counters. Dialga, in particular, fills this role admirably by using an Expert Belt to feign a Choice item. Latios also covers both of Dialga's weaknesses, meaning that he can come in and Dragon Dance once Dialga has removed Latios's primary counter.</p> "

  "Kyogre": {
    "overview": "<p>Kyogre has gotten upgraded in this generation. With Choice Scarf, it makes an excellent revenge killer. With Choice Specs, it strikes fear into its nemesis, Blissey, and also can 2HKO almost every Pokemon in the game. With its massive Special Attack and rain, Kyogre is truly one of the most fearsome sweepers in the Uber tier. Despite the lack of movepool, the sheer power of its moves compensates for that loss. Every Uber team must have a strategy against Kyogre, or it will easily plow through them. The fact that a Pokemon like Quagsire is viable for the sole purpose of beating Kyogre shows how much of a powerful force Kyogre is in the Uber metagame!</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Despite being a huge threat with many sets, Kyogre does not have much of a movepool when compared to other Ubers; thus there really are not any other options for moves. It can use Safeguard and Roar, although these options are almost never seen due to being outclassed. Safeguard allows Kyogre and the rest of the team to block status moves without being forced to use Substitute. It also protects the team from Toxic Spikes. Roar allows Kyogre to phaze away other Calm Minders as they try Calm Minding along with it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Psych Up / Calm Mind Blissey, Latias, specially defensive Dialga (particularly the Bulk Up set), and Latios are checks for all the sets. These are really the only reliable Kyogre switch-ins; Kyogre's special stats are just too high for anything else to threaten Kyogre without too much risk to itself after Kyogre gets a Calm Mind in, or switch into Choice Specs Kyogre's extremely powerful assaults. Shedinja gets a comedy mention as well; it completely walls Kyogre unless it carries Hidden Power specifically to hit it, or Toxic. Similarly, Quagsire takes on Kyogre without Ice Beam, and can hit hard with Choice Band Earthquake, again for a 2HKO, or it, too, can predict a switch and Ice Punch something. Quagsire can also use Encore to foil any attempts to set up on Kyogre's part. Dugtrio gets a special mention just because of the popularity of Choice Scarf / Choice Specs Kyogre, because if Dugtrio catches Kyogre locked into Thunder, it's a guaranteed KO.</p> <p>Palkia easily switches in to a Choice Scarf Water Spout with its 4x resistance. In the process, Kyogre wasted 2 PP due to Pressure. Note that if Kyogre gets in a Calm Mind on the switch, it 2HKOs Palkia with Thunder, but Palkia cannot 2HKO back with a Thunder of its own, unless that Palkia carries Choice Specs. Palkia, however, can switch into Kyogre's STAB Water moves with relative ease. A specially defensive Ludicolo with Rain Dish can take any of Kyogre's attacks with ease, and can use Leech Seed and Protect to stall if needed. Ludicolo can also use Grass Knot to quickly whittle down Kyogre's HP. Ludicolo will not beat the Rest+Sleep Talk Calm Mind Kyogre though, as Ludicolo will eventually run out of PP. If Kyogre does not pack Ice Beam, Rayquaza will be troublesome, cutting down the rain to neutralize Kyogre's Water powers and Thunder's accuracy.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Kyogre is absurdly deadly; a Timid Water Spout deals 54-64% to 252 SpD Calm Blissey, a guaranteed 2HKO, something that most special attackers cannot boast about. With Choice Specs, Ice Beam deals massive damage to Latias and Latios, and Thunder becomes capable of OHKOing an opposing Kyogre. Palkia will actually hesitate to switch in to this, since a Thunder from a Timid Choice Specs Kyogre does 58% minimum to a 4 HP / 0 SpD Palkia, and the paralysis chance is always threatening.</p> <p>The choice of nature depends on your preference. Timid lets Kyogre outspeed other Kyogre, Groudon, most Dialga, some Palkia, and Lugia. Modest will always 2HKO Blissey with Water Spout, and it lets you OHKO Lugia a bit more often, too. It can also 2HKO the standard Latias, who is one of Kyogre's only true counters, with Stealth Rock in play.</p> <p>If you are running a Modest nature, it is advised to use an alternate EV spread of 240 HP / 244 Special Attack / 24 Speed. Kyogre is one of the slowest Ubers (not counting Wobbuffet), and Speed does not help it much. 24 Speed here allows it to outrun Tyranitar and possibly some other base 90 Speed Ubers (Groudon, Kyogre, Dialga, Giratina, Deoxys-D, Ho-Oh) that don't pump their Speed.</p> <p>When using Choice Specs Kyogre, it is often a good idea to use Ice Beam before any other attack if you do not know the opponent's whole team. This is because the two most common Kyogre switch-ins, Palkia and Latias, are both 2HKOed by Ice Beam if they have taken damage from Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Choice Specs Kyogre will have problems sweeping with Water Spout if Palkia and Latias are still around, and additionally, Quagsire can wall it thanks to Water Absorb and its Ground typing. Finally, a specially defensive Ludicolo is arguably the only true Choice Specs Kyogre counter, as it can stall out Thunders thanks to Protect, Rain Dish, and Leech Seed. Choice Band Tyranitar with 56 Attack EVs can easily take care of Latias, as Pursuit will 2HKO it if it doesn't switch out, and Crunch will easily OHKO Latias. Be warned that if Latias is carrying Grass Knot, the standard Careful 252 HP / 200 SpD Tyranitar has a 80% chance of being 2HKOed after taking damage from Stealth Rock. Scizor can work in a similar manner if Latias lacks Thunder, thanks to a Pursuit of its own and STAB U-turn. A specially defensive Scizor also has the bonus ability to switch into a defensive Ludicolo's Grass Knot and threaten it with U-turn. Quagsire poses no threat to Scizor as well. Finally, Palkia can be dealt with by switching Garchomp into its Thunder. Be careful, as some Palkia may opt to use a Dragon move instead, which will OHKO Garchomp. A defensive Dialga can work in a similar manner, and Dialga will survive Palkia's Dragon-type assaults (unless Palkia has Choice Specs). Thanks to Blissey's massive Special Defense and HP, she can work well with Choice Specs Kyogre, as she can switch into Latias's and Palkia's powerful special attacks and wall them (be careful with Palkia, however, as some of them are mixed). Giratina-O complements Choice Specs Kyogre very well offensively and defensively. When facing most stall teams, their only hope against Giratina-O is Latias. If Giratina-O has set up one Calm Mind, it can OHKO Latias after it switches into Stealth Rock, while Latias will be unable to KO Giratina-O. With Latias down, Choice Specs Kyogre can devastate the stall team, as Latias is often their only hope against Choice Specs Kyogre. Giratina-O also sports a resistance to Electric and Grass moves, and thus can set up on these moves if they are Choiced.</p> <p>Although Groudon most certainly cannot switch into Choice Specs Kyogre's powerful Water- and Ice-type attacks, it can switch into Kyogre's Thunder, use Rock Polish on the switch, and attempt to sweep. Because of this, Choice Scarf Shaymin-S makes an excellent offensive teammate for Kyogre, as it can outspeed an Adamant Groudon after it has used Rock Polish once and will OHKO it with a STAB Seed Flare. Garchomp can utilize a similar tactic when switching into Thunders, but dealing with Garchomp can be much trickier, as Garchomp commonly holds Choice items of its own, allowing it to often hurt your switch-in badly. Skarmory can be used as a way to ward off Garchomp, as it is immune to Garchomp's Earthquake, resists Outrage, and will be able to withstand Fire attacks more easily thanks to Kyogre's rain. Bronzong also works in a similar manner. Both Skarmory and Bronzong can beat Groudon that lack Fire Punch, as they can set up entry hazards, and Bronzong can 3HKO Groudon with Grass Knot. Something important to note is that once Kyogre is at 75% of its health, specially defensive Dialga can survive and outstall Kyogre's Water Spouts via Pressure and Rest (though Dialga is still 3HKOed by Surf). Because of this, a Groudon can be a useful teammate for Kyogre, as most specially defensive Dialga will have Bulk Up; thus they will have trouble beating Support Groudon while Groudon will inflict severe damage on Dialga with STAB Earthquakes.</p> "

With Choice Scarf boosting its mediocre Speed, and the rain boosting Water Spout's already gargantuan Base Power, Kyogre becomes a deadly revenge killer. Water Spout is pure power; it can easily destroy Mewtwo and Darkrai in one hit assuming Kyogre is at full health. When one wants to conserve the abysmal PP of Water Spout, or if Kyogre's HP is too low to abuse Water Spout, it can fall back onto Surf or Hydro Pump for STAB. Surf is more reliable, but Hydro Pump OHKOes Mewtwo and Metagross. The other two attacks are used to cover what the Water attacks don't. Thunder 3HKOes Palkia and will 2HKO opposing Kyogre, while Ice Beam OHKOes Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Shaymin-S.</p> <p>Be careful not to constantly switch Kyogre into attacks, as even the smallest shots can decrease Water Spout's power. Sadly, however, there is no way to avoid taking damage from Stealth Rock, Spikes, or Toxic Spikes, unless you use a Rapid Spinner, which may not even get to Spin due to the presence of Giratina. Kyogre needs to be at 80% health or higher to keep Water Spout more powerful than Hydro Pump, or 64%+ health to keep it stronger than Surf.</p> <p>Waterfall and Aqua Tail are options on this set to severely dent Blissey. Kyogre needs 180 Attack EVs with either a Mild or Rash nature to guarantee a 2HKO on Blissey with Aqua Tail. Waterfall won't 2HKO, but its chance of flinch will keep Blissey away from it.</p> <p>You have two options for the nature here (assuming you don't use a physical Water move): Modest or Timid. Modest gives Kyogre extra power, but Timid is often the better choice because it allows Kyogre to outrun Naive / Hasty Deoxys-A, Adamant Dragon Danced Rayquaza, and other Modest Choice Scarf Kyogre. It all depends on what you desire for the team.</p> <p>In addition to the problems Choice Specs Kyogre has with Palkia, Latias, and Ludicolo, Choice Scarf Kyogre has issues with Blissey, Giratina, and specially defensive Dialga. Scizor can easily deal with Latias without Thunder and Ludicolo without Surf. Bulk Up Dialga is an excellent teammate for Choice Scarf Kyogre. This is because Bulk Up Dialga can easily set up on both Blissey and Giratina. Defensive Groudon can usually handle specially defensive Dialga, as many are Bulk Up variants. If you are worried about defensive Dialga with special attacks, a Blissey of your own can withstand its attacks.</p> "

In addition to boosting Kyogre's Special Attack, Calm Mind also boosts Kyogre's titanic 140 base Special Defense, making Kyogre much tougher to revenge kill. For example, Palkia cannot 2HKO a +1 Kyogre with Thunder without Life Orb, while Kyogre 2HKOes most Palkia with Thunder. Even a Life Orb Shaymin-S can only do 84% maximum to a +1 Kyogre with Seed Flare, while Kyogre will easily OHKO with Ice Beam.</p> <p>Despite being one of the slowest Ubers, Kyogre gets good usage out of a Timid nature, letting it tie at worst with Groudon and other non-Choice Scarf Kyogre and outspeed the vast majority of Dialga and Rayquaza. It can also outrun Lugia that invest more EVs into their defenses than Speed and 2HKO it with +1 Thunder. If Speed is not as important as power, Modest is an acceptable nature. When using Modest, Kyogre's EV spread should be 124 HP / 252 SpA / 132 Spe. The Speed allows Kyogre to outspeed most Adamant Rock Polish Groudon before they boost their Speed.</p> <p>Despite Calm Mind Kyogre's power, Kyogre will have a difficult time getting past Blissey, Latias, and Latios. Blissey can use Toxic, Protect, and Wish to eventually stall Kyogre to death. Because of this, Wobbuffet can be a very effective teammate for Calm Mind Kyogre. Wobbuffet can trap Blissey and use Tickle to lower its Defense. After being Tickled two times, a fleeing Blissey will be OHKOed by a Pursuit coming from a neutral-natured Choice Band Tyranitar with 56 Attack EVs. After being Tickled four times, a fleeing Blissey will OHKOed by a Pursuit coming from an Adamant Life Orbed Scizor with 100 Attack EVs. With Blissey out of the way, Kyogre will often have a much easier time sweeping. Wobbuffet is also able to help set up Kyogre thanks to Encore and Shadow Tag. A Careful Tyranitar with 252 HP EVs and 200 Special Defense EVs is capable of switching into any of Latias's or Latios's special attacks bar Grass Knot and either OHKO them with Crunch or OHKO them with Pursuit as they switch out. Scizor can also switch into Latias without Thunder and threaten to OHKO them with U-turn.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This set destroys anyone depending on a non-Psych Up, non-Calm Mind Blissey to counter Kyogre. 101 HP Substitutes mean that Blissey can't break them with Seismic Toss, and Kyogre's massive Special Defense ensures that they will become unbreakable with Thunder after the second Calm Mind, and the first if Blissey doesn't carry maximum Special Attack. It can also wear down many things your opponent may use to attempt to counter Kyogre and allows it to set up a Substitute and start Calm Minding against whatever their next answer is after their first gets worn down or fainted.</p> <p>If you opt for Ice Beam in the last slot, Kyogre will be unable to break through opposing Kyogre. Because of this, Latias can be a good teammate for Substitute Kyogre. Latias can easily switch into an opposing Kyogre's Thunder, and either force it out with the threat of Grass Knot or Thunder, or use Calm Mind to set up on Kyogre. In a similar manner, a specially defensive Bulk Up Dialga can switch into a Choiced Kyogre's Thunder and set up on it. If Substitute Kyogre uses Thunder over Ice Beam, Kyogre will have even more trouble with Latias and Latios then usual, so Choice Band Tyranitar and Choice Band Scizor with heavy Special Defense investment make good partners. Like the last set, Kyogre will greatly benefit from Wobbuffet's support, as Wobbuffet can use Encore to help Kyogre set up a Substitute.</p> "

Calm Mind boosts its already titanic special stats even further, and as it sets up, Surf washes almost everything ashore. RestTalk keeps Kyogre alive and healthy and free from status. With this set, Kyogre will easily beat any Blissey without Psych Up + Thunder.</p> <p>This set runs into major problems against Latias and Latios, who resist Surf and are capable of Calm Minding alongside Kyogre. As usual, Scizor or Tyranitar can be used to beat most Latias or Latios. Rayquaza is a problem as well: with a Water resistance and Air Lock to nullify rain, it easily sets up a Dragon Dance or Swords Dance. Choice Specs Kyogre can also use Thunder to do some serious damage as well. Because of this, Choice Scarf Garchomp is a very good teammate with Boosting Tank Kyogre. Garchomp can switch into Rayquaza as it attempts to set up, and either force it to switch out or OHKO it with STAB super effective Dragon moves. Thanks to Garchomp's Ground typing, it can also absorb Thunders from Choiced Pokemon such as Kyogre and force them to switch out. Finally, Choice Scarf Garchomp is also able to outspeed and KO opposing Latias and Latios with Outrage.</p> "

        "name": "Thunder Wave Lead",
        "description": "<p>Kyogre in a lead position is often helpful to set the tone for the entire battle; not only will it set up rain that you can take advantage of with your other team members, it will also cripple opposing leads such as Darkrai and Groudon. Choice Scarf Mewtwo is easily Thunder Waved and picked off by Surf, as it can only muster a 4-3HKO (27.7% - 32.6%) with its strongest non-Self-Destruct attack, Focus Blast. 176 HP / 176 SpD Scizor has a small chance of getting OHKOed by Surf, and a 252 HP / 4 SpD Scizor is always OHKOed. The common 240 HP / 184 SpD Tyranitar lead is 2HKOed (54.1% - 63.8%) with sandstorm up by Surf as well.</p> <p>Lum Berry on this set is important for two reasons. Firstly, if Darkrai tries to use Dark Void, your status will remain intact and you can subsequently OHKO with Surf. Second, the lack of Leftovers recovery when using a Berry means that you can bluff a Choice Scarf, and as such, you won't need to fear getting tricked a Choice Scarf by opposing Trick Choice Scarf Darkrai. It will also help with taking on Groudon's Thunder Waves, and after that, you can OHKO with a rain-boosted Surf.</p> <p>The EVs here are quite simple, yet important. It is critical you have absolutely no Speed EVs and a 30 Speed IV on this Kyogre, as it will let it get the rain up when faced against Groudon. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack to do as much damage as possible.</p> <p>Note that this set can be used as a mid-game sweeper, not only as a lead. Thunder Wave is incredibly helpful in taking down some counters. It's normally outclassed by the Calm Mind set in terms of sweeping, though, as that set can build up damage over time. If you do decide to go this route, though, run Expert Belt over Lum Berry, as it can still bluff a Choice item.</p> <p>The main selling point of Thunder Wave Kyogre is its ability to help slower sweepers who have problems with Latias and Palkia by paralyzing them, as both are common switch-ins to Kyogre. A good teammate for this lead is a mixed Palkia, as it benefits from both the paralysis and the fact Kyogre and Palkia have similar counters means that if you immobilize a Latias or opposing Choice Scarf Palkia, it is easier for Palkia to sweep. Another Pokemon who benefits from this is Swords Dance Garchomp. If Kyogre is able to paralyze either Latias or Choice Scarf Palkia, Garchomp will have a significantly easier time sweeping. Dragon Dance Rayquaza also greatly benefits from this particular Kyogre, as Choice Scarf Palkia will no longer be able to stop a sweep from Rayquaza when paralyzed. Finally, Giratina-O is particularly useful with Thunder Wave Kyogre, because Palkia and Latias will be hard pressed to stop its sweeps if they are paralyzed.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Although this seems similar to the Mono-Attacker set, this set packs some notable advantages. Instead of setting up Calm Minds over time, this set focuses on getting as many Calm Minds as possible and then Resting. Thanks to Chesto Berry, Kyogre will immediately wake up at full HP, ready to drown anything in its path with STAB Surf. Without the need for Sleep Talk, this Kyogre can afford to run a second attacking move. Ice Beam is generally the best option as it allows Kyogre to stop Rayquaza, Giratina-O, Palkia, and Shaymin-S cold. Thunder can also be used to allow Kyogre to defeat some opposing Calm Mind Kyogre, Manaphy, and Lugia, while also dealing more damage to Palkia than Ice Beam.</p> <p>This Kyogre appreciates Toxic Spikes support, as well as teammates to prevent Latias and Latios from using Calm Mind alongside Kyogre and consequently beating it with Thunder or Grass Knot. With Toxic Spikes, Kyogre can focus on gaining more Calm Minds against things like Blissey and Palkia while the poison withers them away into nothingness. Forretress sets up Toxic Spikes very easily thanks to its many resistances and draws Fire-type attacks that Kyogre can switch into. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can easily come in on Latias and Latios who lack Grass Knot and Pursuit as they switch or KO them with a fast Crunch. Scizor and Metagross are also solid Pursuit users to consider for the job.</p> <p>Most boosted Electric-type attacks, such as Choice Specs Thunder from the likes of Dialga, Palkia, and enemy Kyogre will 2HKO this Kyogre even after a Calm Mind boost. Furthermore, physical variants of Dialga and Palkia can 2HKO Kyogre before it can even set up. Garchomp boasts an immunity to Electric-type attacks and can use his powerful STAB Outrage and Earthquake to destroy the aforementioned Pokemon. Garchomp also baits Ice-type attacks that Kyogre can set up on. Physical Dialga and Palkia can be handled easily by Groudon, who can also take Electric-type attacks aimed at Kyogre. Lugia can work as well by setting up Reflect to help Kyogre take physical attacks as it sets up. Both Groudon and Lugia can provide paralysis support to make up for Kyogre's middling Speed, but it's not recommended with Toxic Spikes on the same team.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Although this set may seem more offensive at first glance, its primary role is to support, focusing on luring Kyogre's common counters as opposed to blasting everything in sight. Its main selling point is the ability to 2HKO Blissey with Waterfall, which helps immensely to facilitate a sweep for another special sweeper. However, Kyogre's usefulness doesn't end there, as it can also cripple its two primary counters, Latias and Palkia, with Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Even with virtually no investment in Attack, a simple Life Orb ensures that Waterfall will 2HKO Blissey. Life Orb has the added benefit of boosting both Surf and Thunder as well, which can be helpful when facing physically defensive foes such as Groudon. Thunder is usually given the nod over Ice Beam because it hits opposing Kyogre and does more damage to Lugia, but Ice Beam is an option if Dragon-types trouble you. Life Orb is meant to be used with a Hasty nature to give Kyogre power without sacrificing Speed, but Sea Incense is a worthy alternative if the recoil turns you off. When using Sea Incense, it's recommended to use a Mild nature with a spread of 192 HP / 60 Atk / 252 SpA to ensure a 2HKO on Blissey with Waterfall.</p> <p>There are a number of Pokemon that benefit from Kyogre's ability to remove Blissey and cripple Latias and Palkia. Taunt + Calm Mind Mewtwo is an excellent example; not only can it sweep with greater ease with Blissey out of the picture, it also doesn't have to worry about being revenge killed by Palkia if Palkia is paralyzed. A Calm Mind Latias of your own is another great partner, especially if you run Ice Beam on Kyogre, as it can counter opposing Kyogre and sweep once Blissey is eliminated. Although this set struggles against typical Kyogre counters such as Palkia, Latias, and Ludicolo, the use of Thunder Wave can help mitigate this weakness. However, Quagsire deserves mention because it completely walls all of Kyogre's attacks outside of Ice Beam. Scizor is a good partner to beat Quagsire, and it also serves as a great Palkia and Latias check if Kyogre is unable to paralyze them.</p> "

  "Groudon": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Groudon may seem out of place in a tier flooded by vicious special attackers, it has a very valuable and specific niche in Ubers. With a monstrous Attack stat and access to Rock Polish and Swords Dance, Groudon is one of the most prominent physical sweepers in the tier, capable of threatening both stall and offensive teams. Moreover, Groudon can play the role of a fantastic physical wall, and is one of the few Pokemon that can reliably counter Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Lucario thanks to its great Defense. Groudon also has access to Stealth Rock, a very valuable move that many Pokemon in the Uber metagame lack. Overall, Groudon is an extremely unpredictable Pokemon, and its ability to both sweep and support makes it a valuable asset to almost any team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Salac Berry set with Substitute and Swords Dance is certainly viable, and with Wobbuffet's Encore support and potentially paralysis support, it can be very difficult to stop. However, Groudon will be very susceptible to almost all priority attacks. A Swords Dance set with three attacks is also a usable option, although it's mostly outclassed by the ParaDancer due to Groudon's middling Speed. A set with Thunder Wave and three attacks is viable, although it is again slightly inferior to the ParaDancer, as Groudon will have a hard time sweeping without Swords Dance. It does still make a solid supporter despite the absence of Stealth Rock. Groudon has the option of using a Rest + Sleep Talk set, which can be helpful for stall teams. Safeguard will stop Giratina that don't carry Roar from burning Groudon. Fling while Groudon is holding an Iron Ball will OHKO Lugia after a Swords Dance, provided Lugia doesn't set up the precautionary Reflect before it attempts to Whirlwind Groudon and its boosts away. Don't even consider using any special moves aside from Overheat, because Groudon's noticeably inferior Special Attack and the general surplus of Pokemon with high Special Defense in Ubers will prevent them from doing much damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Despite its rarity in Ubers, Cresselia is probably the best counter for any Groudon that exists. Its high HP and Defense can quite easily take the best that Groudon can throw at it, along with a Moonlight that is boosted in sunlight to roughly 67% of healing. It can even set up a Reflect to stay alive longer. While Groudon struggles to destroy it, Cresselia can use Grass Knot or Ice Beam for good amounts of direct damage or Toxic to whittle Groudon down slowly. However, Cresselia isn't particularly useful in Ubers aside from a few very specific tasks and is often substituted for by others.</p> <p>Groudon will run into problems against three common Ubers walls: Lugia, Giratina, and Skarmory. Lugia works similarly to Cresselia in countering Groudon, as it can also use Reflect to reduce damage from Groudon's attacks. While the weakness to Stone Edge may sound disheartening, Lugia's Pressure ability will cut Stone Edge's already meager 8 PP in half, and its Roost will allow it to dump the Rock weakness for a turn assuming it is EVed to outspeed Groudon. Additionally, if Groudon decides to use Swords Dance, Whirlwind will blow away its plans easily. In any situation, Ice Beam is always helpful to land a solid hit. Although Giratina has no reliable recovery outside of Rest and it must rely on Will-O-Wisp's sketchy 75% accuracy to stop it, its immense defenses will usually let it win a bout against Groudon. Skarmory can switch into any Groudon that lacks a Fire-type move, and set up Spikes or use Whirlwind to phaze Groudon.</p> <p>Due to Groudon's terrible Special Defense and middling Speed, it can easily be exploited in a metagame driven by special attackers. Thus, if the likes of Latios, Latias, Shaymin-S or Mewtwo come in safely, they'll do huge damage to Groudon, potentially OHKOing it.</p> ",

        "name": "Rock Polish",
        "description": "<p>Groudon's modest Speed and massive Attack stats make it a fantastic user of Rock Polish. This set is best used as a late-game sweeper as you will still need residual damage splashed upon the more bulky Pokemon that are neutral against its attacks. After using Rock Polish, Groudon hits a Speed stat of 500, enough to outrun Choice Scarf Garchomp with a Jolly nature. You can then pick one of Groudon's many options to tear up the field with. STAB Earthquake is mandatory and destroys Dialga, Metagross, and any Pokemon that does not resist Ground yet dares to switch in. Stone Edge complements Earthquake for all-around coverage as well as devastating Lugia, Rayquaza, and most Flying-type foes. If you already have a way to deal with Lugia, Overheat is another option because it OHKOes Skarmory, which would otherwise wall this set.</p> <p>Dragon Claw is the best option in the last slot, as it allows Groudon to destroy Latias, Latios, Giratina-O, and Rayquaza. Swords Dance, on the other hand, is extremely useful if you can create two turns of setup for Groudon. After both a Rock Polish and a Swords Dance, your opponent will more than likely have to rely on Stone Edge missing if they hope to stop Groudon's rampage. In addition, Swords Dance gives Groudon a reliable way of defeating Wobbuffet barring an untimely Encore, as a +2 Earthquake will always OHKO.</p> <p>The HP EVs allow the maximum number of Life Orb uses and give enough defenses on both sides to take hits if needed. As previously mentioned, the Speed EVs allow Groudon to reach a Speed stat of 500, while the remaining 8 EVs are placed in Defense slightly more bulk. However, another EV spread to consider is 42 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe with a Jolly nature. This will allow Groudon to outspeed even a Choice Scarf Mewtwo, which also means that Choice Scarf Shaymin-S and Darkrai can no longer stop Groudon's sweep. Unfortunately, this results in a power loss, meaning Groudon has a far lower chance of obtaining vital OHKOs on Pokemon such as Palkia. This becomes a non-issue when using Swords Dance though, as almost every single Pokemon in the game will be OHKOed regardless of the nature. In fact, the only common Pokemon in Ubers that don't have to rely on Stone Edge's accuracy to beat this Groudon are Skarmory and Giratina.</p> <p>There are three main walls in Ubers that will give Groudon trouble: Skarmory (if Groudon lacks Overheat), Lugia (if Groudon lacks Stone Edge), and Giratina. Even when Groudon uses Stone Edge, its shaky accuracy can give Lugia the advantage if it misses. In addition, there are still a few Pokemon capable of revenge killing it: Choice Scarf Darkrai, Choice Scarf Mewtwo, Choice Scarf Shaymin-S, and Wobbuffet. A Timid Darkrai can KO Groudon with Dark Pulse if Groudon is below 40% health, but the threat of sleep is what makes Darkrai truly problematic, as Dark Void gives it a very reliable way of crippling Groudon. Similarly, Timid Mewtwo can do 85% - 100% to Groudon with Grass Knot. Choice Scarf Shaymin-S is a particularly large problem, because not only can it switch into Earthquake, but it can also OHKO Groudon with Seed Flare. Finally, if Wobbuffet switches into Groudon, Groudon will eventually be forced to attack Wobbuffet, and will thus be KOed by Counter.</p> <p>Scizor is a fantastic partner for Rock Polish Groudon. It can easily take Dark Pulses and Grass Knots from Darkrai and Mewtwo, respectively, and can shrug off Shaymin-S's Seed Flare like nothing. Scizor can then threaten to OHKO both Darkrai and Mewtwo with U-turn, and do a serious amount of damage to Shaymin-S. It can also use Pursuit to do a heavy amount of damage to Mewtwo and Shaymin-S as they switch out. Pairing Scizor with Wobbuffet can also spell doom for Giratina and Lugia. Wobbuffet can Encore a support move and use multiple Tickles to allow Scizor to come in and Pursuit the fleeing Pokemon. Kyogre is also a great teammate for Groudon, as its gargantuan Special Defense will easily allow it to take attacks from Mewtwo and Darkrai and use the time to set up Calm Minds or to launch off powerful Water-type attacks. It also has very little to fear from Skarmory, Lugia, and Giratina, and can use them as setup fodder or unleash its powerful attacks on them. Spikes should always be considered in conjunction with Stealth Rock support when using Rock Polish Groudon. With Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, Palkia will always be OHKOed by Dragon Claw, while 4 HP / 0 Def Mewtwo and Kyogre will also be KOed by Earthquake. Garchomp will have a 92.3% chance of being OHKOed by Groudon's Dragon Claw after Stealth Rock and Spikes, a much more favorable position than the meager 7% chance with only Stealth Rock. Deoxys-S is a good choice for laying down Spikes and Stealth Rock, and makes a good lead for many offensive teams. If Deoxys-S is not a suitable option for your team, Forretress makes another excellent choice as a teammate. Forretress can easily set up Spikes and Stealth Rock on Lugia and Skarmory, both of whom are common switch-ins to Groudon.</p> "

        "name": "Support",
        "description": "<p>Groudon, while commonly seen as a dominating physical sweeper, can also play a supporting role, hindering the walls that usually stop it and halting monstrous physical threats in their tracks. With access to fantastic utility moves such as Stealth Rock and Toxic and sturdy defenses Groudon can survive a wide variety of hits while setting up.</p> <p>The premise of this set is threefold. Firstly, Groudon plays the role of a wonderful physical wall, countering the likes of Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Lucario while dispatching them with either Earthquake or Stone Edge. Dragon Claw is an option for a more reliable way to hit Rayquaza, and gives Groudon a slightly stronger method of dealing with Palkia and Groudon. However, Stone Edge is largely the superior option thanks to its greater coverage and the ability to OHKO Ho-Oh. Secondly, Groudon is one of the most reliable users of Stealth Rock in Ubers, easily finding time to set up the entry hazard to support its fellow teammates. Finally, this Groudon is meant to spread around either paralysis or poison. Support Groudon is fantastic at luring walls like Lugia and shutting them down with Toxic, as Lugia can only stave off Toxic damage so many times before falling. Groudon can also choose to run Thunder Wave to cripple common switch-ins, which greatly helps slower sweepers wreak havoc. Roar is an option to phaze and scout an opponent's team, constantly whittling down the opposition in the process if Stealth Rock is up.</p> <p>With an Impish nature and max Hit Points and Defense, Groudon is one of the few Pokemon that can survive a bout with Swords Dance Rayquaza, Garchomp, or Lucario. It will never be OHKOed by Rayquaza's +2 Dragon Claw, Garchomp's +2 Outrage, or Lucario's +2 Close Combat, which are among the most powerful physical attacks in Ubers. In turn, Groudon can score a clean OHKO on Lucario with Earthquake and take Rayquaza out with one Stone Edge provided it has taken one turn of Life Orb recoil. Although Groudon can only 2HKO Garchomp, Groudon will leave Garchomp at such a low health that it can be revenge killed by virtually any attack. If physical walling is not a priority, then there is another EV spread to consider. With a Careful nature and a spread of 252 HP / 32 Def / 224 SpD, Palkia will be unable to 2HKO Groudon with an unboosted Spacial Rend, while Groudon will 2HKO it with Earthquake. The standard 204 SpA Latias will do 77% maximum with Grass Knot, which means that Groudon can cripple it with Toxic or Thunder Wave before switching out. The 32 Defense EVs are here to survive a +1 Outrage from a Jolly Rayquaza.</p> <p>This Groudon set can work well as a lead with some small adjustments. When using a lead Groudon, it's best to use the same EV spread as the Careful Groudon, but with a Sassy nature and a Speed IV of 0. Lead Groudon should also be using Thunder Wave over Toxic and hold a Chesto Berry. The reason that Groudon is using minimum Speed is because when facing a Kyogre lead, Groudon's Drought will cancel out Kyogre's rain (unless it is a Speed tie, which means that Kyogre is using a Speed-reducing nature and 0 Speed IVs as well). Thanks to Groudon's heavy investment in Special Defense, Groudon will live through an Ice Beam and be able to use Stealth Rock. However, an Impish nature is fully acceptable if Kyogre isn't an issue and your team requires physical walling throughout the course of the game. When facing a Darkrai lead, Groudon should use Thunder Wave. The Chesto Berry not only guards Groudon from Dark Void, but it also keeps Darkrai paralyzed even if it uses Trick, unlike the Lum Berry. When facing Deoxys-A, it is often best to hit it with Earthquake, and then switch to a faster Pokemon who can take Deoxys-A's next attack (such as switching Choice Scarf Dialga into a Grass Knot). Unfortunately, Deoxys-S is always going to be able to get Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes up. Because of this, it is recommended to have either Forretress on the team to Rapid Spin the entry hazards away, or to have a team that Stealth Rock and Spikes do not harm too much.</p> <p>This set still has trouble dealing with Giratina, as it can simply remove its Toxic status by using Rest, while simultaneously threatening a burn with Will-O-Wisp if it runs Sleep Talk. Supporting Groudon, as the name implies, is not meant to sweep, even after the opponent's walls have been brought down. It is best used alongside physical sweepers like Bulk Up Dialga or Dragon Dance Rayquaza, as the pair can beat Giratina one on one. They will also help against powerful special threats like Kyogre whom Groudon cannot handle. On the surface, this set does not look like your typical wallbreaker. However, Supporting Groudon can force pressure on Lugia, Ubers' foremost physical wall. With Lugia crippled by Stealth Rock and afflicted by Toxic, teammates such as Swords Dance or Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Bulk Up Dialga can step in and run through a team unhindered by Reflect or Whirlwind. Choice Band Garchomp can also perform well, as Jolly Outrage will 2HKO a slower Lugia after Stealth Rock and two turns of Toxic damage.</p> "

        "name": "Thunder Wave + Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>This set looks unusual at first but it is effective when used properly. The main idea is to figure out what Pokemon switches into Groudon. Lugia is the prime example as it attempts to stall Groudon out with Reflect and Roost, leaving it useless. This set proposes a different idea than the normal 'hit and run' or 'cripple everything in sight' strategy. Instead, it meshes the ideas together to create quite the posing threat. It's best to Thunder Wave early in the game when almost every Pokemon is faster than Groudon. Most Pokemon that switch in to take Groudon's attacks aren't usually of the Ground-type, which makes the strategy even more appealing. After crippling some Pokemon, use Swords Dance while the opponent switches, or on Pokemon that don't pose an immediate threat to Groudon. After that, Groudon can tear apart every Pokemon with STAB Earthquake and a boosted Stone Edge. Keep in mind that Stealth Rock is necessary on this set to help generate necessary OHKOs and 2HKOs after a Swords Dance. Without Stealth Rock, Groudon will have a harder time beating down its usual counters even with paralysis on its side.</p> <p>Paralysis is the crux of this set for many reasons. First off, Lugia has a more difficult time blocking Stone Edges as Roost will not remove the Rock-type weakness. Then, the 25% chance of being fully paralyzed is also a benefit and allows free Swords Dances or even more spamming of Groudon's attacks. Finally, having a Pokemon slower than Groudon is always a benefit for you and trouble for your opponent.</p> <p>The EVs here seem somewhat complicated but they actually work well together. 200 HP EVs grant 391 HP, effectively minimizing damage taken by poison, burn, and Spikes while retaining a medium amount of Leftovers recovery. The Attack EVs guarantee that Lugia is taken down after a Swords Danced Stone Edge. The rest is thrown into Defense for durability, although 84 EVs can be taken out of Attack and placed in Speed to generate 237 Speed, which is just enough to outpace neutral base 100s with no Speed.</p> <p>ParaDance Groudon's focus on paralysis not only helps itself sweep, but is also extremely helpful to the many powerful but slow Pokemon of the Uber environment. A great example of this kind of partner is Choice Specs Kyogre. Some people will be tempted to predict an Earthquake, and switch in either Latias or Shaymin-S. With Shaymin-S crippled by paralysis, it will no longer be able to revenge kill Kyogre. Latias will also be unable to use Recover in time before two Ice Beams from Choice Specs Kyogre finishes it off. Giratina-O benefits in a similar way, as a paralyzed Latias has no chance of stopping a Calm Mind Giratina-O from sweeping. If Lugia is paralyzed, then Swords Dance Rayquaza can outspeed Lugia and OHKO it with a +2 Outrage. Most offensive Dialga of any kind will greatly appreciate the paralysis support, especially mixed Dialga. Mixed Dialga can also destroy both Skarmory and Giratina with almost no problems, which means that Groudon itself will have a much easier time sweeping. Additionally, Wobbuffet can benefit from the paralysis. If Groudon paralyzes a Pokemon such as Lugia, it may attempt to use Reflect. However, if you switch Wobbuffet in, it can use Encore before Lugia moves due to the paralysis Speed drop, and thus easily set up a Pokemon such as Darkrai to sweep.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Groudon is commonly used to hit and run, setting up the sunlight while it's at it. With Choice Band boosting its already massive Attack stat, it can easily exploit the generally lower physical defensive Pokemon found in Ubers. With this set, Groudon is capable of striking many Ubers very hard. Earthquake is a general STAB attack that leaves a huge dent in any Pokemon not immune or resistant to it. The other three attacks cover every type that Earthquake does not. Stone Edge damages Lugia badly and easily KOs Ho-Oh, while Dragon Claw destroys Latias and Latios, and also provides some extra power against Giratina and Palkia. Fire Punch wrecks Skarmory, Forretress, and Bronzong and receives what is tantamount to a STAB boost thanks to Drought. While Overheat is an option to OHKO Skarmory, Fire Punch works off Groudon's enormous Attack, doesn't carry an annoying side effect such as a Special Attack drop, and helps in situations where prediction is required, such as between Skarmory and Blissey. Fire Punch will still take down Skarmory in two hits however.</p> <p>The EVs given for this set allow for a combination of durability and power. The combination of HP and Defense EVs allows this Groudon to survive a Rayquaza Outrage that is boosted by both a Life Orb and a Dragon Dance. Meanwhile, the small amount in Speed helps it outrun fellow Ubers that rarely invest in Speed, such as Giratina and Dialga.</p> <p>What stops Choice Band Groudon from dominating the physically frail Uber metagame is its less than staggering Speed. As such, a team that can provide paralysis support will greatly aid Groudon's sweep. Pokemon such as Lugia, which usually lure in special attackers such as Darkrai, Kyogre, and Palkia, can neutralize all such threats with a Thunder Wave on the switch. Similarly, a Kyogre of your own can help lure in Palkia, Latias, and Latios, while also utilizing an uncommon move in Thunder Wave.</p> <p>While Stealth Rock is a great addition to any sweeper, it presents a pseudo Rock / Ground coverage, a two-type combination that hits hard. For example, Lugia, Shaymin-S, and Rayquaza can switch in to an Earthquake with impunity; however, with Stealth Rock in place, the three will lose 25% of their hit points when switching in. Dialga makes a good candidate for setting up Stealth Rock as it is also capable of slowing down various threats with Thunder Wave. It can also lure in Lugia and cripple it with Toxic. Moreover, there are ways to take advantage of these switch-ins as well. In Lugia's case, Taunt Mewtwo can switch in and use Lugia as setup time as long as it avoids Toxic. In a similar manner, Darkrai can switch in, put Lugia to sleep, and set up on it. For Rayquaza, Choice Scarf Dialga can put an end to Swords Dance Rayquaza, while Dragon Dance Rayquaza will be beaten by Choice Scarf Palkia. Choice Scarf Gengar has the ability to beat both Dragon Dance and Swords Dance Rayquaza. Mixed Rayquaza is far more difficult to deal with -- the best bet against it is a Bold Lugia with 248 Speed EVs. Finally, Shaymin-S's plans are foiled by Choice Scarf Dialga, which sports a 4x resistance to Seed Flare and can OHKO with Draco Meteor. Offensively, Groudon pairs well with mixed Rayquaza, which can switch in on Grass- and Water-type attacks reasonably well, lure in standard physical walls such as opposing Bulky Groudon or Lugia, and batter them down with Draco Meteor. Likewise, the unpredictable mixed Dialga sets work well at luring in physical walls, then smacking them hard. Wobbuffet with Tickle, alongside a Pursuit user, can also effectively break Lugia and/or Giratina.</p> "

        "name": "Bulky Rock Polish",
        "description": "<p>People often assume Groudon is running a defensive set when their powerful attackers fail to KO it and its Leftovers recovery activates. This set capitalizes on that preconception; it maintains the support set's ability to check dangerous physical threats such as Garchomp, Rayquaza, and Lucario, while also providing a strong offensive presence with Rock Polish and Swords Dance. Due to assumptions that people are apt to make, this Groudon set can capitalize on the checks to a standard support set by setting up for a devastating sweep in their face. Thanks to its greater bulk, Groudon also manages far more opportunities to set up than a more offensive variant, and is also harder to revenge kill with priority.</p> <p>Earthquake is the obvious STAB move of choice for any Ground-type, while the final moveslot goes to a coverage move. Dragon Claw is Groudon's most reliable option for coverage, with perfect accuracy, a decent 80 Base Power, and super effective hits on Pokemon such as Giratina-O and Latios. Stone Edge, on the other hand, is the more powerful move in general and has equally impressive coverage alongside Earthquake. Most notably, Stone Edge allows Groudon to OHKO Rayquaza after Stealth Rock and one round of Life Orb recoil, whereas Dragon Claw does not. Ho-Oh is also OHKOed by Stone Edge, and Lugia and Skarmory will find it much harder to wall Groudon when it is with Stone Edge.</p> <p>The EV spread is almost completely geared to the defensive side, with 56 EVs invested into Speed so Groudon can beat Timid Choice Scarf Kyogre, as well as other base 90 Speed Pokemon at +1, after a Rock Polish. Further investment in Speed can be useful, but it detracts from the main draw of the set, which is bulk. Not to mention, the less bulk Groudon has, the likelier it is your opponent will figure out it's not running a purely defensive set. Still, investing 124 EVs in Speed will allow Groudon to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon with a Choice Scarf; most notably Palkia, who could otherwise 2HKO with Draco Meteor; which can be useful.</p> <p>This Groudon is not the kind of Pokemon you should base your team around. In fact, it plays almost identically to a support set besides the potential boosting. If anything, though, Groudon appreciates entry hazard support, particularly Toxic Spikes, so that it may better deal with opposing Groudon and Kyogre. This does not mean that you need to go out of your way to set it up though; many Pokemon enjoy entry hazard support. Forretress is generally the best Toxic Spikes user in Ubers; it can also set up the other entry hazards too or spin them away from your own side of the field as needed. Skarmory, Lugia, and Giratina are troublesome for Groudon to deal with; a combination of Tickle Wobbuffet and Pursuit Scizor can handle the latter two, while Skarmory can be dealt with by a powerful special attacker like Heatran. The aforementioned Wobbuffet is also useful for eliminating Choice Scarf revenge killers such as Shaymin-S and Palkia, among others.</p> "

  "Rayquaza": {
    "overview": "<p>Rayquaza is one of the most threatening forces in the Uber metagame, and as such should always be considered when making a team. With one Dragon Dance, it is capable of sweeping half a team until Outrage confuses it or Life Orb recoil destroys it. With Swords Dance, Rayquaza becomes a hellish priority sweeper that can force teams to use Choice Scarf Steel-types or Garchomp. Rayquaza even has the ability to be a deadly mixed attacker that rips through its most common switch-ins. More often than not, the disadvantageous Pokemon who faces Rayquaza will have to stay in; otherwise one Dragon Dance or Swords Dance on their switch will lead to their demise, and it's better to hit it hard before it does that.</p> <p>Rayquaza does have a flaw though: it is not an easy Pokemon to switch in. The combination of an environment full of extremely powerful offensive Pokemon, its average defenses (by Uber standards anyway), and its weakness to Stealth Rock means that Rayquaza will have a hard time switching into neutral attacks without taking a large amount of damage. In general, Rayquaza's main switch-ins are done by using its resistances and the opponent's Choice items. Despite having a hard time switching in, Rayquaza is still a fearsome threat that can rip unprepared teams apart.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>All EVs are included within their respective sets. Coincidentally, 216 Speed EVs give Rayquaza 280 on the neutral Speed (outspeeding neutral base 90s), and 308 on the +Speed ones (outspeeding +Speed Groudon / Kyogre). For the Dragon Dance set, you can run max Speed if you want to try to outrun other Rayquaza, and you feel the HP is unnecessary due to Life Orb Recoil. The remaining 4 EVs should go to anything else besides HP; with odd HP, Rayquaza can switch into Stealth Rock four times, and gets maximum amount of attacks with Life Orb. For the Swords Dance set, an alternate EV spread can be used if you don't mind losing Speed ties with other Rayquaza: 112 HP / 252 Atk / 144 Spe. The EV spread hits a good HP number that rounds down Life Orb and Stealth Rock while also outspeeding minimum Lugia.</p> <p>A Choice Specs set is a viable option on Rayquaza, as it can surprise its usual switch ins. Generally, Dialga and Palkia are better choices for this, as Rayquaza can destroy Lugia with its Mixquaza set just as easily, in addition to Palkia and Dialga lacking Rayquaza's weakness to Stealth Rock. Thunder Wave can cripple Pokemon like Choice Scarf Dialga switching into you, but you shouldn't really be focusing on this and you should focus more on setting Rayquaza up. Ice Beam is pretty useless with Draco Meteor, but you can knock down Groudon without suffering a Special Attack drop. Rayquaza is capable of producing 101 HP Substitutes if you want to block any attempts to Seismic Toss or status you. Beware, however, because Blissey / Deoxys-D may carry Ice Beam just for this, or just for Rayquaza in general. Bulk Up is rather novelty but you can use this move to survive a Choice Banded Stone Edge from Groudon and OHKO back with Outrage if you're holding a Life Orb. Toxic can poison Lugia and Cresselia on the switch, making them useless at tanking, but once again you should be more focused on the sweeping part. Sleep Talking an Outrage doesn't get you locked, so it's worth a shot. Rest can be used for defensive purposes, but it is rather novelty because Rayquaza dies very quickly. Crunch is a reasonable option on the Dragon Dance set, as it can hit the Psychic-type Ubers hard without resorting to Outrage.</p> <p>Focus Sash lets Rayquaza survive a powerful hit, and then pull off a Dragon Dance and Outrage to almost guarantee at least one KO on the opponent. It makes a good lead because it destroys both Mewtwo and Kyogre, and does not fear sandstorm thanks to Air Lock. However, you should watch out for Metagross switching into you when you try and Outrage these leads. Haban Berry is a reasonable choice for both Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Swords Dance Rayquaza if you have Rapid Spin support, as this will allow Rayquaza to survive attacks from common Choice Scarf revenge killers such as Garchomp, Dialga and Palkia. Rayquaza can then OHKO them with a boosted super effective attack in return.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Cresselia can survive Outrage with its high HP / Defense and OHKO with Ice Beam when Life Orb damage is taken into account, but is severely dented by the mixed set. Skarmory can come in on Rayquaza without Overheat / Fire Blast and laugh at it. Lugia can also switch in and OHKO with Ice Beam, but it will need a lot of HP and Defense to survive a hit from Dragon Dance Rayquaza, and Stone Edge will hurt Lugia. Also, Stealth Rock will severely hinder Lugia's ability to wall you. Thankfully, Lugia can easily outspeed Swords Dance Rayquaza. Lugia must be careful about switching into Rayquaza though, as Hasty mixed Rayquaza can outspeed and 2HKO it with Draco Meteor if Stealth Rock is out. Metagross can switch in on Outrage / Draco Meteor and KO back with Ice Punch or maybe Meteor Mash.</p> <p>If you're running Adamant, a Hasty Deoxys-A will outspeed you and KO you, even if you Dragon Danced, with Ice Beam. Pokemon with a base Speed above 95 can carry a Choice Scarf to revenge kill Dragon Dance Rayquaza. The prime examples are Mewtwo, Palkia, and Darkrai. Steel-types with Choice Scarf and a super effective move can revenge kill Swords Dance Rayquaza. The best examples of these Pokemon are Dialga, Metagross, and Heatran (with Hidden Power Ice). Gengar has the interesting ability to revenge kill both Swords Dance and Dragon Dance Rayquaza (as long as Gengar has a Choice Scarf), thanks to Gengar's 110 base Speed and the Normal immunity granted by Gengar's Ghost-typing. The same goes for Choice Scarf Garchomp as well, as it will not only outspeed Rayquaza after a Dragon Dance, it will also only have a 7% chance of getting KOed by an Adamant Rayquaza's +2 Extreme Speed with Life Orb. Weavile is able to OHKO Rayquaza with STAB Ice Shard; the only Rayquaza that can handle it is a Dragon Dance Rayquaza with Extreme Speed. Extremely defensive Groudon can survive Outrage and KO back with Stone Edge.</p> ",

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>This set is a huge threat once it sets up. After a Dragon Dance, Jolly Rayquaza outspeeds every non-Scarfed Pokemon except Deoxys-S. Outrage is extremely powerful, OHKOing almost every Pokemon who doesn't resist it. Before using Outrage, it is best to scout the opponent's team. This is because early in the game, your opponent may have Pokemon like Forretress to take the Outrage and explode. For this very reason, Overheat is included to OHKO it. Overheat also has the additional use of OHKOing Skarmory, who would otherwise wall the entire moveset. Earthquake is here to KO Metagross and Dialga (although Dialga needs a heavy defensive investment to live through Outrage).</p> <p>While Jolly is often the preferred nature, Adamant is still a viable nature that has some advantages over Jolly for Dragon Dance Rayquaza. The reason Jolly Rayquaza is normally the better choice is because it will always outspeed and OHKO Timid Choice Scarf Dialga after one Dragon Dance. This is important because Choice Scarf Dialga will often switch into Rayquaza, expecting the Swords Dance set. When using Jolly, it is important to note that a +1 Outrage only has around a 66% chance of OHKOing the standard Bold 252 HP / 52 Defense Lugia after it takes damage from Stealth Rock. This makes Stone Edge a viable alternative to either Earthquake or Overheat when using Jolly Rayquaza, as a +1 Stone Edge guarantees an OHKO on Lugia after it takes damage from Stealth Rock. Adamant Rayquaza has the advantage of not needing to use Stone Edge to have a 100% chance of KOing Lugia, as it has a 100% chance of KOing Lugia with Outrage providing Stealth Rock is in play. Adamant Rayquaza will unfortunately be outsped by Deoxys-A, even after a Dragon Dance. Because of this, Extreme Speed is recommended over Earthquake or Overheat to OHKO Deoxys-A. When using Extreme Speed with either nature, it is best to use maximum Speed, so Rayquaza will have a chance of revenge killing an opposing Swords Dance Rayquaza.</p> <p>Rayquaza has issues with unusually bulky Lugia and Scarf users with over 95 base Speed, such as Palkia, Darkrai, Mewtwo, and Garchomp. Wobbuffet makes an excellent partner for Rayquaza, as it can switch into all of these Choiced attacks (except Darkrai's Dark Pulse) as they attempt to revenge kill Rayquaza. Wobbuffet can then KO them with Mirror Coat or Counter. It can also clear the path for setting up by Encoring a support or Ground-type move. If you would rather have a separate answer to Lugia, after five Tickles from Wobbuffet, a 100+ Attack Adamant Life Orb Scizor KOs it with Pursuit as it switches out. Scizor also complements Rayquaza well, switching into Choice Scarf Dragon and Ice attacks and threatening them with STAB U-turn or Pursuit. Scizor can also take on two rare but deadly Pokemon who cause Rayquaza problems: Choice Scarf Gengar attempting to use Hidden Power Ice, and any Weavile. Lastly, Thunder Wave Kyogre lures out and cripples the common Dragon Dance Rayquaza revenge killer, Choice Scarf Palkia.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance is often used to compensate for Rayquaza's below average Speed, boosting its Attack along the way. However, Swords Dancing will let Rayquaza boast a massive Attack score of 876; unfortunately, it has no way of boosting its mediocre Speed. However, this set is a monstrously powerful physical sweeper thanks to Rayquaza's priority move, Extreme Speed. Extreme Speed always OHKOes Darkrai, and with help from Stealth Rock, a +2 Life Orb Extreme Speed has around a 87% chance of OHKOing 4 HP / 0 Defense Timid Palkia and a 79% chance of OHKOing 4 HP / 0 Defense Mewtwo, all of which are significant KOs.</p> <p>Dragon Claw or Waterfall are the best options for the next slot. Dragon Claw is a good STAB attack for Rayquaza that allows it to OHKO Giratina after a Swords Dance, while being able to do severe damage to other slower Pokemon. While it may seem harsh to forget STAB on any Pokemon, Waterfall can be a good choice over Dragon Claw to hit Groudon much harder (don't worry about the weather, as Air Lock negates this). It also comes with a handy 20% flinch rate, should one find oneself in a tight spot. In the last moveslot, Earthquake or Overheat are the best choices for the last slot. Earthquake is best for taking out Steel-types that would ruin your sweep, such as Metagross. Overheat can easily OHKO Forretress, Skarmory (who walls you otherwise) and Scizor.</p> <p>Rayquaza should usually be using an Adamant nature, since Extreme Speed will be its most commonly used attack. If one is paranoid of an opposing Rayquaza's Extreme Speed, Jolly could be used over Adamant. Jolly should also be used if Rayquaza finds itself with Swords Dance and Outrage on the same set. However, Outrage is not recommended as it makes Rayquaza a very easy Pokemon to revenge kill, especially in Ubers. It does have the benefit of OHKOing both Groudon and Lugia after an Swords Dance. The main problem with using Jolly Swords Dance Rayquaza is that Extreme Speed has a much lower chance of KOing Mewtwo and Palkia after Stealth Rock. Only use Jolly Swords Dance Rayquaza if your team has no other way to beat Lugia.</p> <p>Swords Dance Rayquaza is very vulnerable to Lugia, due to having no way of boosting its Speed and the lack of Outrage. Because of this, Wobbuffet is highly recommended as a partner for Swords Dance Rayquaza for a number of reasons. Wobbuffet can use Tickle on a trapped Lugia; after four, Choice Band Scizor can OHKO Lugia as it flees with Pursuit. With Lugia out of the picture, Rayquaza can easily sweep a team. Additionally, Choice Band Scizor can OHKO Gengar with either Bullet Punch or Pursuit, as well as OHKOing Weavile with Bullet Punch. Another way many teams deal with Swords Dance Rayquaza is to use Steel-types with Choice Scarf and super effective moves to revenge kill it. The most common Pokemon who does this is Choice Scarf Dialga, but other Steel-type Pokemon who can be seen using Choice Scarf are Metagross and Heatran. Wobbuffet can switch into these threats as they try to KO Rayquaza, and use either Counter or Mirror Coat to KO them. Wobbuffet can also help set up Rayquaza if it encores a Ground-type attack or support move. Garchomp can be a bit trickier to deal with than usual, because while Wobbuffet can beat the Choice Scarfer, Choice Band Garchomp will 2HKO both Wobbuffet and Scizor. Garchomp does not need Choice Scarf to revenge kill Rayquaza, and Rayquaza only has a 7% chance of KOing Garchomp with Extreme Speed after Garchomp takes damage from Stealth Rock. Choice Scarf Metagross can be a good way to beat Garchomp that lack a Choice Scarf, because Metagross resists the Dragon attacks aimed at Rayquaza, and will OHKO Garchomp with Ice Punch 100% of the time after it takes damage from Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Entry hazards are key to Swords Dance Rayquaza's success, as they are required to gain KOs on important Pokemon such as Palkia and Mewtwo. Deoxys-S can be an excellent lead, as it can not only lay down Stealth Rock, but it can also use Spikes. With Stealth Rock and Spikes, not only will Mewtwo and Palkia be OHKOed 100% of the time by a +2 Extreme Speed, but Garchomp will have a 92% chance of being KOed by the same move as well! If Deoxys-S is not a good option for your team, then a support Groudon and Forretress should be considered. Groudon not only lays down Stealth Rock, but also lures Lugia in. Once a Lugia switches in, Groudon can cripple it with Toxic. Forretress can switch in on Ice Beams used by Pokemon like Lugia and set up Spikes. Forretress also has the ability to use Rapid Spin, which can give Rayquaza a much easier time switching in and out of battle.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "MixQuaza (Mixed Attacker)",
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Rayquaza's often overlooked base 150 Special Attack in order to cripple the standard Rayquaza switch-ins. Draco Meteor is obviously your main form of attack and is what you should be leading off with most of the time. Your opponent will be shocked when their Rayquaza counter is met with a Draco Meteor off of 518 Special Attack. Rayquaza's main counters, Groudon and Lugia, are both maimed by this set. Only the most defensive of Groudon will survive the first hit while standard Lugia will always be 2HKOed with Stealth Rock on the field.</p> <p>Fire Blast takes care of the common specially defensive Steel-types, such as Metagross and Jirachi, that attempt to wall Draco Meteor after you reveal it. Fire Blast is listed over Flamethrower since the set relies on sheer power to avoid taking any damage so while missing 15% of the time might be a negative, the extra power is almost a must. Extreme Speed lets you clean up weakened Pokemon who threaten to ruin your fun. However the main reason for using Extreme Speed is for the OHKO on Deoxys-A (though watch out for Focus Sash if it hasn't taken any damage yet).</p> <p>The best two options for the last slot are Outrage and Brick Break. Outrage is still a very powerful attack, even with only 40 Attack EVs. For example, it can still 2HKO Kyogre. Brick Break can 2HKO Blissey, and break Light Screen and Reflect. This is very useful because if Rayquaza has Brick Break, it has a chance at beating Baton Pass Mew. After breaking Reflect and Light Screen, Rayquaza can KO Mew with a combination of Draco Meteor followed by Extreme Speed.</p> <p>216 Speed EVs with a positive nature outspeeds all base 90 Speed Ubers and Lugia who sit at 307 in order to do the same. However, it's perfectly fine to move those Attack EVs into Speed in order to attempt a Speed tie with other max Speed Rayquaza or if you are simply paranoid that Lugia may be running a few extra Speed EVs. Also if you decide to run both Extreme Speed and Outrage, you could move some Special Attack EVs into Attack in order to hit harder from the physical side.</p> <p>In addition to being a great wallbreaker, MixQuaza can also function as a very effective attacking lead that beats some of the most common leads in the metagame. Leads such as Deoxys, Deoxys-S, and Mew are only able to set up one layer of Spikes or Stealth Rock before being picked off by Extreme Speed. This puts you in an excellent position, with one of the opponent's Pokemon KOed and you having a high HP MixQuaza. Groudon and Dialga leads are risky match-ups, but they either forfeit the ability to set up Stealth Rock to KO Rayquaza or they set it up and faint. Choice Scarf Shaymin-S leads will attempt to use Air Slash or Hidden Power Ice against Rayquaza, so switching to a teammate that can sponge these attacks, such as a Steel-type or Blissey, is recommended. Kyogre and Darkrai are huge problems for lead Rayquaza and need special care. Darkrai can put Rayquaza to sleep while suffering only an Extreme Speed in return. Having a Sleep Talker on your team can remedy this situation substantially. Kyogre, on the other hand, possesses two common lead sets that both need different responses. Standard Thunder Wave Kyogre will take substantial damage before going down, but Choice Scarf Kyogre will take Rayquaza out without trouble.</p> <p>Some other options are worth considering when using MixQuaza in the lead slot. The most common deviation is running Focus Sash over Life Orb. By doing so, Rayquaza is able to beat Dialga, Groudon, Leftovers Kyogre, and opposing lead Life Orb MixQuaza 100% of the time in exchange for less overall power. Lum Berry can also be used to take status from Darkrai, Thunder Wave Kyogre, Groudon, and Dialga.</p> <p>Mixquaza's best teammates are the ones that benefit from the removal of Groudon and Lugia. A prime example of this is Lucario. Lucario often has problems sweeping when Lugia is around. If Rayquaza eliminates Lugia, Lucario will often have a much easier time sweeping with its Swords Dance set. Rayquaza also resists all of Lucario's weaknesses. For example, if the opponent switches in Choice Band Garchomp to KO Lucario, you can switch Rayquaza in on the Earthquake and launch off more powerful assaults. Another Pokemon who will appreciate Lugia's absence is SubSalac Groudon with Swords Dance. Thanks to Groudon's Substitute, Giratina will have a hard time with Groudon unless it has Roar. Without Lugia, stall teams can crumble to SubSalac Groudon. If Rayquaza KOs Groudon, Bulk Up Dialga is a great teammate. This is because many teams' (especially stall teams) only hope of beating Bulk Up Dialga is Groudon. With Groudon out of the picture, Dialga has the potential to sweep. Finally, Jirachi is a useful teammate for mixed Rayquaza, as Groudon's absence enables it to pass Wish more effectively. Body Slam Jirachi is useful as well, as some offensive teams resort to sending out fast sweepers like Garchomp to remove it; if Jirachi paralyzes them with Body Slam, Rayquaza can take them out later. Finally, Dragon Dance Tyranitar can easily destroy a whole team with Scizor and Groudon gone, as most teams lack any other reliable Dragon Dance Tyranitar checks aside from Garchomp. All the problems that Swords Dance Rayquaza and Dragon Dance Rayquaza face are similar here; Scizor is still a useful switch-in against Choice Scarf Palkia, and Wobbuffet takes care of most Scarfed opponents</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Rayquaza is an extremely powerful threat, capable of 2HKOing the majority of the metagame with a Choice Band equipped. Although it may seem inferior to Choice Band Garchomp at first glance, who has STAB on its Earthquake, higher base Speed, and immunity to Thunder Wave and other Electric-type attacks, this is not the case. Rayquaza does have several key advantages over Garchomp, namely higher Attack, a priority move in Extreme Speed, and an immunity to Ground-type attacks.</p> <p>Dragon Claw is the main attack of the set, 2HKOing anything that does not resist it or is not a physical wall such as Groudon. Earthquake OHKOes Metagross and Jirachi and 2HKOes Scizor, Forretress, and even the bulkiest of Dialga. Extreme Speed gives Rayquaza strong priority for picking off faster Pokemon such as Darkrai and Mewtwo. Unlike Garchomp, Rayquaza's priority allows it to become a capable revenge killer as well as a powerful sweeper. Outrage from this set is so powerful it can 2HKO even defensive Groudon as well as Lugia after Stealth Rock damage. However, Outrage leaves Rayquaza open to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon and Steel-type, so use it with caution. It is usually best to use Dragon Claw first to scout for Steel-types. Overheat is also an option to OHKO Skarmory, as otherwise it will wall this set with little effort.</p> <p>The choice between an Adamant or Jolly nature is really personal preference. Jolly allows Rayquaza to always outspeed Pokemon who lie in the base 90 Speed group as well as Adamant Rayquaza, but Adamant allows for a stronger Extreme Speed if you really need Rayquaza for revenge killing purposes.</p> <p>Paralysis support is extremely recommended if using this set as a late-game sweeper, as it makes Rayquaza much more difficult to revenge kill and it lets it power through Lugia much more easily. Groudon, Dialga, Kyogre, and Jirachi are all sturdy Pokemon who can provide paralysis support for Rayquaza. Groudon in particular is a good choice as it can lay down Stealth Rock and lure in Lugia, making it much that much easier to cripple it. Jirachi is also an excellent choice as it and Rayquaza resist each other's weaknesses, allowing for plenty of safe switchins. Jirachi also provides Wish support to keep Rayquaza alive, so it can keep coming back in again and again to cause even more mayhem. Aside from this, the best teammates for Choice Band Rayquaza mirror the ones for the Swords Dance set.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Jirachi's wide movepool provides it with many other moves. Fire Punch allows it to take down the common Forretress, Scizor, and Skarmory switch-ins but cannot be used in the rain effectively. Thunder can deal reasonable damage to Kyogre and has a 60% paralysis rate thanks to Serene Grace. Toxic can cripple common switch-ins to Jirachi, such as Groudon, Kyogre, and Lugia; while Jirachi still cannot deal anything back, it will be able to quickly wear them down. Jirachi can also run a dual screen set which can aid in sweeping or to add extra defenses to the team.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Jirachi has many counters; Kyogre won't take much damage from any of its attacks, save for Thunder, and can retaliate with Surf which will at least 2HKO it. Groudon is immune to Thunder Wave and will easily KO Jirachi with Earthquake. Any Steel-type can easily switch into Jirachi's attacks and completely wall it, unless it runs Fire Punch. Any Pokemon faster than Jirachi with Taunt or Substitute can easily set up on it while Jirachi does little damage back; this is especially true for Mewtwo. Bulkier Pokemon and those who resist Jirachi's STAB can easily switch in and take minimal damage, then proceed to attack or cripple it with status; examples include Giratina, Ho-Oh, Palkia, Dialga, Garchomp, and Manaphy, the last one is also immune to status in the rain. Jirachi also hates to be burned as Iron Head will be severely weakened and will only deal around 14% damage to Pokemon such as Latias. Jirachi also hates paralysis as it ruins its attempt to combine its own paralysis and Iron Head.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Jirachi can fill the role of a great supporter for any team; its excellent typing allows it to take powerful Dragon-type attacks, and its great support movepool becomes an asset to Jirachi's teammates. The combination of Wish and Protect serves as Jirachi's means of recovery, along with Leftovers, and Wish can be passed to heal its teammates as well. Jirachi may also support its team with paralysis. Thunder Wave is guaranteed to paralyze anything that isn't a Ground-type, while Body Slam has a nifty 60% paralysis rate due to Serene Grace, and hits everything but Ghost-types; the ability to somewhat-reliably paralyze Ground-types is one not many Pokemon have. U-turn allows Jirachi to scout the opponent's team, and is an effective way to provide recovery to a teammate with Wish. Stealth Rock is another support option if your team lacks a designated Stealth Rock user.</p> <p>The choice between Protect and Iron Head should be determined on whether you want Jirachi to survive the next turn for certain, or whether you want to have a reliable STAB move with a 60% chance of flinching the opposing Pokemon. Iron Head can make it very difficult for the opponent to move if they get paralyzed; while immobilized, Jirachi can simply chip away at the opposing Pokemon's health to eventually take it down. This works especially well on foes such as Latias, Giratina-O, Latios, Rayquaza, Mewtwo, and Darkrai, Pokemon that are usually fast, but not as bulky.</p> <p>Kyogre, Groudon, Palkia, Dialga, Giratina, and Garchomp are all solid counters and checks to Jirachi as it lacks the raw power to deal significant damage to them. These Pokemon can easily wait for a turn when they're not fully paralyzed or flinched, as they take minimal damage from Iron Head, then proceed to KO Jirachi. Groudon and Garchomp are immune to Thunder Wave and can KO Jirachi with Earthquake, but they must be wary of Body Slam.</p> <p>Latias is a good teammate to switch into Kyogre and Groudon, and she can 2HKO either with Grass Knot. Latias can also switch into Palkia's Surf and Garchomp's Earthquake, outspeed and OHKO them with Dragon Pulse, or force them to switch if they are Scarfed. Be wary of Dragon-type attacks though. Specially defensive Groudon may be used to take an attack from Dialga, then maim it with Earthquake.</p> <p>Toxic can be used to cripple bulky switch-ins, particularly Groudon and Lugia. Jirachi can also run Light Screen and Reflect in the last two slots in order to support a frail sweeper. Jirachi may also run extra Speed to outrun offensive variants of Pokemon, such as Groudon and Kyogre, but it doesn't gain much by doing this. Ice Punch may also be used to deal heavy damage to Rayquaza and Garchomp, and Fire Punch to deal heavy damage to Forretress and Scizor. Finally, Jirachi can also utilize Thunder with rain support for a powerful attack and a 60% chance to paralyze the opponent, thanks to Serene Grace.</p> "

        "description": "<p>When it comes to revenge killing, Jirachi is often overlooked in favor of more powerful Pokemon such as Garchomp, Palkia, or Dialga. Even though Jirachi lacks the raw power that they have, it does boast many qualities that they can only wish for; Jirachi's long list of resistances, most notably to Dragon-type moves, allow it to switch into the likes of Latios, Latias, and Rayquaza easily. Due to Jirachi's resistance to Extreme Speed and greater base 100 Speed, Jirachi is one of the few Pokemon that can revenge kill both Swords Dance and Dragon Dance Rayquaza, something only Choice Scarf Gengar and Garchomp can do otherwise. Finally, unlike other Choice Scarfers, Jirachi is remarkably difficult to trap with Wobbuffet as Jirachi can cripple it with Trick, escape its shadowy clutches via U-turn, or simply get lucky and flinch it to death with Iron Head.</p> <p>Iron Head is the bread-and-butter of this set, as with the Speed boost from Choice Scarf, Jirachi will have an extremely easy time outspeeding most Pokemon you are likely to encounter, greatly increasing the number of Pokemon it can repeatedly flinch with Iron Head. It is also Jirachi's strongest reliable physical attack - that said, don't expect it to hit too hard coming off Jirachi's only decent offensive stats. Fortunately, this is more than offset by its incredibly high chance to flinch; Jirachi is capable of chaining a few flinches now and then to actually inflict a great deal of damage. U-turn is a great move for maintaining the momentum on your side of the battle, and it allows Jirachi to scout for potential switch-ins as well as leaving quite a dent on the likes of Mewtwo, Latias, and Latios. Ice Punch is the preferred option on the third moveslot as it can easily dispatch Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Shaymin-S, though the former two require a bit of residual damage to be knocked out by it. Fire Punch can be used to cook Forretress, Scizor, and Lucario, as all three can otherwise wall the set. Finally, Trick is great for crippling targets after Jirachi's job is done; however, be warned that Tricking too early in the match forfeits Jirachi's role as a revenge killer, and furthermore, it will completely fail to work against Giratina-O and does essentially nothing against other Choice Scarfers, so use it with extreme care.</p> <p>The EVs are relatively simple; maximizing Attack allows Jirachi to deal as much damage as possible—this is particularly important as its offensive prowess is rather lackluster—and maximum Speed allows Jirachi to speed tie with Dragon Dance Salamence. Even with no investment, Jirachi's natural bulk, coupled with its resistances, allows it to absorb most resisted hits with ease.</p> <p>Jirachi is best fitted on a team that requires the use of all of its qualities, which are revenge killing both Swords Dance and Dragon Dance Rayquaza, Nasty Plot Darkrai, Calm Mind Mewtwo, and most variants of Latias and Latios. Jirachi should not have a team built around it, but it will appreciate the partnership of several Pokemon. Stealth Rock support is almost required so that it can land a clean OHKO on Rayquaza with Ice Punch, as well as 2HKO Darkrai with Iron Head. Groudon, Tyranitar, and Deoxys-S are all excellent choices for that role. Spikes support is highly appreciated as well, and it works extremely well in tandem with U-turn; Deoxys-S, Forretress, and Skarmory can provide this. The last two examples are great Dragon resists in their own right, as this Jirachi set lacks recovery and power, and thus cannot be entirely relied on to take more powerful blows.</p> <p>As Jirachi fulfills the role of a revenge killer, as well as a Steel-type, it makes Latias and Latios easier to fit on your team. Either of these Pokemon covers up all of Jirachi's weaknesses, while Jirachi resists their Dragon- and Ice- type weaknesses. Giratina-O is in a similar boat; Choice Scarf Jirachi can often land a U-turn on the likes of Mewtwo, Latias, and Latios as they fire attacks that threaten it, only to have Giratina-O absorb the ineffective hit instead. Giratina-O can then finish off the remains of their HP with Shadow Sneak. For this tactic to have the most success, however, entry hazards are a necessity, and Giratina-O can conveniently preserve them thanks to its immunity to Rapid Spin. You will have to run Hidden Power Fire on it though, or it will do little to the bagworm.</p> <p>As mentioned before, Choice Scarf Jirachi lacks recovery and power, and repeated Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Dialga and Palkia will quickly wear it down. Furthermore, Jirachi's weakness to Fire-type attacks means it can be OHKOed if your opponent predicts the switch-in. A backup Steel-type Pokemon is appreciated due to this. Heatran in particular gets a nod as it can absorb Fire-type attacks that are aimed at Jirachi. Skarmory will have troubles with Mewtwo, Latias, and Latios, which Jirachi can cover to an extent, while Skarmory's immunity to Earthquake allows it to handle Garchomp and Groudon. Although Tyranitar is not a Steel-type, its resistance to Fire-type attacks and boosted Special Defense grants it the ability to take on specially offensive Dragon-type attacks with moderate ease.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Jirachi's infamous set of OU happens to have great potential in Ubers. Its excellent typing allows it to take on many special threats such as Latias, Latios, Giratina-O, Mewtwo, and Darkrai. Jirachi can also take a range of Dragon-type attacks from Choiced Pokemon such as Palkia, Dialga, Garchomp, and Rayquaza due to its Steel typing. Keep in mind, though, that if they aren't Choiced, they will usually be carrying a move capable of doing major damage to Jirachi. After taking the attack, Jirachi may proceed to use either Substitute to scout the switch and protect it from status, or use Thunder Wave on the opposing Pokemon. Due to the largely Speed-oriented metagame, Thunder Wave can cripple many fast sweepers. Jirachi can then begin the infuriating Para-Flinch strategy with Iron Head. This strategy is very useful for taking hits from frail but fast sweepers, crippling them, then taking them down.</p> <p>The EVs allow Jirachi to make 101 HP Substitutes, which means it takes two of Blissey's Seismic Toss to break. The Special Defense EVs provide Jirachi with some extra bulk, allowing it to take powerful special attacks more easily; the rest of the EVs are dumped into Attack to deal more damage. With Serene Grace, Iron Head provides a reliable STAB move with a 60% flinch rate. Combined with paralysis, there is only a 30% chance for the opponent to attack while Jirachi chips away at their health with Iron Head. Jirachi's last move depends on its team, as well as a matter of personal preference. Ice Punch can be used to finish off Pokemon such as Giratina-O, Latias, and Lugia to avoid having to risk another turn of banking on a flinch. Body Slam allows Jirachi to deal cheap damage as well as having a 60% chance of paralysis. Body Slam can also paralyze Groudon and Garchomp, which Thunder Wave cannot. Body Slam may also be used to deal with frail Substitute users so that they either lose 25% of their HP each turn or face a 60% chance to get paralyzed. This is also effective against Taunt users, most notably Mewtwo. Fire Punch is effective to surprise Steel-types such as Scizor and Forretress. Keep in mind though that Fire Punch will not be of much use if Kyogre is on your team, as Fire Punch's power would be halved.</p> <p>Wish may be used for self recovery, which, when combined with Iron Head, provides a degree of invincibility. Thunder also has a 60% paralysis rate with Serene Grace, but can only really be used in the rain for its higher accuracy. U-turn is a great scouting move, especially when Groudon and Kyogre switch in; it also deals decent damage to Psychic-types while switching out.</p> "

However, Deoxys can still be an asset in the lead position with a little adjustment in the EVs. There are plenty of EV investments you can play around with to benefit from its defensive stats (even if they're rather miserable). It's important to note that outside of the lead position, it is completely useless, outside of the odd revenge kill with Extreme Speed (watch out for Stealth Rock chipping away at the remainder of its health though), so you're better off setting up Spikes as much as you can before it dies. Overall, Deoxys is not entirely outclassed by its other form; it is an asset on any team that requires a reliable lead.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Focus Sash + Calm Mind is very useful to get two potential Calm Minds -- one on the switch, another on the attack -- before you sweep. Ice Beam helps special Deoxys hit Dragon- and Flying-type Pokemon for super effective damage. For the Choice Band version, there's also Rock Slide for the Flying-types -- especially Ho-Oh. Pursuit is an option for the Choice Bander. If you can get in on the Latias or Latios (after death or support move not called Thunder Wave/Substitute), you can KO them with this if they run off predicting Ice Punch. Deoxys can try using Trick on the Choice sets; however, you are usually just better off using that turn to attack.</p> <p>A set that runs Focus Sash in conjunction with Counter or Mirror Coat is available. It can nab a couple of surprise KOs, however, the abundance of Stealth Rock and Spikes in the Uber tier means that this set will be really difficult to execute. This is better for starting matches, so entry hazards don't hinder you, but you're better off using the Lead set provided.</p> <p>One remarkable option is a \"SubPetaya\" set, which uses Substitute and Petaya Berry, and allows you to take advantage by blocking status and priority moves. Unfortunately, this kind of tactic is better off being used by Deoxys-A, who is more effective at offense than Deoxys.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Deoxys must be beaten by prediction and combinations of Pokemon to switch in and resist its attacks. Some Pokemon deserve special mention: Latias wags her finger at Grass Knot, Superpower and Thunder, OHKOes it with Dragon Pulse, and Recovers off the residual damage. If Latias sacrifices Speed EVs in favor of HP and more Special Defense, it can easily survive two Shadow Balls from Deoxys. Forretress takes Superpower, Shadow Ball and Grass Knot like a real man, but it always gets 2HKOed by Thunder or Thunderbolt. Rayquaza resists Superpower and Grass Knot, but is 2HKOed by Shadow Ball, Thunder (which is 70% accurate against Rayquaza, though) or Thunderbolt. Rayquaza also has to watch out for Ice Beam, Ice Punch and Rock Slide. However, by Rayquaza's very presence, Deoxys trembles; Rayquaza is extremely capable of OHKOing with Extreme Speed. Ho-Oh's Defense makes Deoxys' Superpower underpowered against the great phoenix, and its great Special Defense can make Deoxys not so special if Deoxys doesn't have an Electric-type move. Spiritomb is immune to Superpower and Psycho Boost, and takes little from Grass Knot. It can then Pursuit or Sucker Punch the Deoxys away.</p> <p>Dugtrio, while its chances of safely switching in successfully are abysmal, traps Deoxys and OHKOes Deoxys with Sucker Punch, provided the Deoxys attacks; however, you must be warned that Extreme Speed has the same priority as Sucker Punch, so Deoxys will move first with its higher Speed stat. Metagross Pursuits Deoxys to death if Deoxys doesn't 2HKO it first. Switching in Metagross is less dangerous than switching in Dugtrio, though, thanks to resisting Grass Knot and Psycho Boost. The Choice Band version is walled by a combination of Lugia and Forretress, who together resist all of its attacks and are never OHKOed single-handedly by one. Cresselia also works in conjunction, neutral or resistant to everything. A Pursuit Deoxys-S is faster than Deoxys and will survive anything this machine throws at it except for boosted Thunder and Shadow Ball, and forces Deoxys to die unless it has Focus Sash.</p> ",

At first glance, this may seem outclassed by Deoxys-S, but surprisingly, this set is capable of handling other leads. Despite having miserable Defense, a couple of EVs invested into Defense can give Deoxys enough bulk to take hits from opposing leads. Shadow Ball is your main attacking option, which can deal with opposing Deoxys-S leads. With the EVs invested, it is capable of scoring a 2HKO with a Shadow Ball followed by Extreme Speed. If Deoxys-S uses Taunt, use Shadow Ball and follow it up with Extreme Speed to score an OHKO, preventing it from laying down any entry hazards. If Deoxys-S decides to go for the kill, Deoxys is capable of surviving 2 Extreme Speeds. Deoxys has a higher chance than Deoxys-S in defeating opposing Deoxys-S leads who invest 252 HP EVs. The last two slots provide entry hazards for the entire team, and works great on hyper offense teams that enjoy entry hazards being deployed early.</p> <p>Darkrai will always win this match-up, so Scizor can make a great teammate to combat Nasty Plot versions. Make sure something reliable takes Dark Void before sending it in, however, and beware of a +2 Focus Blast, as it will OHKO Scizor. Kyogre makes an excellent RestTalk user thanks to its high Special Defense stat. Ho-Oh could do this as well if Stealth Rock is not present on the field. You will never take down Groudon; your best bet is to deploy hazards and switch out to Kyogre who can nullify Drought and bring in Drizzle. Opposing Kyogre leads are also troublesome. In a similar fashion to Groudon, set up your entry hazards and bring in something appropriate. Most Kyogre leads are Choiced, so bring in Latias or Palkia to take Water Spout and hopefully scare it away with Grass Knot or Thunder, respectively. If Kyogre is running a support set in the lead slot, Blissey makes a reliable switch into it.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Fast, frail, and ferocious are all very appropriate words to define Deoxys-A. With its incredible offenses and blistering Speed, Deoxys-A is a top-tier lead in Ubers, able to defeat virtually all other common leads in the tier. In addition, with access to Stealth Rock, Deoxys-A can take a more supportive role in the lead position by setting up this crucial entry hazard to aid its fellow teammates. Its ability to easily defeat Deoxys-S, who is by far the most common lead in Ubers, is a testament to how well Deoxys-A thrives in this position. Not only this, but Deoxys-A is also a monster of a sweeper; virtually everything in the game is OHKOed or 2HKOed by its attacks. Although it has paper-thin defenses, its sheer power more than makes up for this setback, making Deoxys-A a ferocious threat every team should prepare for.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Other than a Fire-type attack in the form of Hidden Power Fire or Fire Punch, there are only a few other usable options for Deoxys-A to consider. Choice Specs or Choice Band can be used to deal huge damage to switch-ins, but offensive Deoxys-A's strong suit is its ability to deal super effective damage by switching attacks, which is why Life Orb is ideal. Giving Deoxys-A a Choice Scarf to outpace virtually anything may seem like a fun idea, but it is already fast enough, and it is still easily bypassed by priority moves. A Substitute and Petaya Berry set with Ice Beam, Thunder, and Superpower is an option, although it requires there be no entry hazards and that damaging weather conditions--that is, sandstorm and hail--are not present. While Deoxys-A has access to Calm Mind, it can't take full advantage of the move due to its poor defenses and will be hard-pressed to find a chance to set up in the first place.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Deoxys-A must be beaten by prediction and smart switch-ins into resistances, as it is impossible to hard counter; everything is OHKOed or 2HKOed by its attacks. Certain things deserve mention, though, for being able to handle themselves well. In the sun, Ho-Oh is probably the best Deoxys-A check. Thunder only has a 50% chance of hitting when the sun is present, and Ho-Oh's stellar Special Defense stat lets it shrug off nearly anything Deoxys-A can throw at it. Any Deoxys-A lacking a Fire-type move is immediately threatened by Scizor, who can use either Pursuit or Bullet Punch to end Deoxys-A's life. Forretress is also quite problematic if Deoxys-A does not have Hidden Power Fire or Fire Punch. However, both are 2HKOed by a Life Orb Thunder, so hastily switching them in is not advised. Other bulky Steel-types like Metagross and Jirachi can deal with Deoxys-A by coming in on a resisted attack and then threatening an OHKO with Meteor Mash and Iron Head, respectively. Due to Deoxys-A's high Speed and poor defenses, priority moves are excellent ways of dealing with it. In addition to Scizor, common priority users include Rayquaza, who often packs Extreme Speed, and Giratina-O, who usually runs Shadow Sneak.</p> ",

        "name": "Attacking Lead",
        "description": "<p>Although it's often rejected for the speedier Deoxys-S, Deoxys-A's rare combination of pace and power make it one of the most threatening attacking leads in the Uber tier. The beauty of this set is that it has the ability to deal with both bulky and suicide leads, a quality most other leads would die for. With immense attacking stats across the board as well as priority in the form of Extreme Speed, Deoxys-A can come out on top against common leads including, but not limited to, Deoxys-S, Groudon, Kyogre, Mew, and Dialga.</p> <p>One of Deoxys-A's most alluring attributes is its ability to swiftly eliminate opposing Deoxys-S leads, as Shadow Ball followed by Extreme Speed will always net the KO against 252 HP variants. Thanks to Extreme Speed's priority, Deoxys-S will only be able to set up one layer of entry hazards, or none if it chooses to attack or Taunt instead. Grass Knot is Deoxys-A's preferred third attack, as it will 2HKO both Groudon and Kyogre, two of the most common bulky leads in Ubers. However, if lead Rayquaza is a concern, Ice Beam is a worthwhile alternative. Keep in mind that although utilizing Ice Beam maintains the 2HKO on Groudon, Deoxys-A will have no means of threatening Kyogre. Superpower takes advantage of Deoxys-A's balanced offensive stats, keeping lead Dialga at bay, as well as nailing any Blissey bold enough to switch in. The listed attacks give Deoxys-A the best combination of moves to deal with common leads, but opting for a Fire-type move is worth consideration. Either Fire Punch or Hidden Power Fire is a great way of dealing with the omnipresent Steel-types in Ubers, especially Forretress and Scizor. If Hidden Power Fire is used, especially over Superpower, a Rash nature and 252 Special Attack EVs are recommended, as Hidden Power Fire's imperfect Speed IV makes running max Speed unnecessary.</p> <p>Although the EVs may look strange on paper, they are tailored to ensure that Deoxys-A achieves important OHKOs and 2HKOs. Max Speed is necessary to force the speed-tie with opposing Deoxys-A leads and to outpace any non-Scarf Pokemon besides Deoxys-S. The reason for the focus on Attack is that even with the minute Special Attack investment, Deoxys-A still gets all the KOs it needs. Lead Groudon and Kyogre are both 2HKOed by Grass Knot, while Mew and Giratina-O are also on average 2HKOed by Shadow Ball. The Attack EVs ensure that 4 HP / 252 Def Calm Blissey, the standard in Ubers, is always OHKOed by Superpower. While it may seem excessive, keep in mind that this allows Deoxys-A to perform its wall-breaking duties, and that Blissey is often hasty when switching into Deoxys-A. In addition, not only does Superpower OHKO Darkrai, but it always 2HKOes Dialga even after factoring in the Attack drop.</p> <p>Despite Deoxys-A's attacking prowess, there are still numerous leads and other Pokemon who give it trouble. Forretress and Scizor are among the biggest threats, as they take little damage from anything Deoxys-A throws at them besides the rare Fire-type move. In return, Forretress can freely set up entry hazards, while Scizor can threaten Deoxys-A with an array of powerful attacks. Although Giratina-O is 2HKOed by Shadow Ball, it is immune to Extreme Speed, meaning it can 2HKO Deoxys-A first with Shadow Sneak. Lead Giratina falls into a similar category, although it's even more threatening since it is only 3HKOed by Shadow Ball. If Deoxys-A is not using Ice Beam, Rayquaza will become a large threat, and conversely, any Deoxys-A lacking Grass Knot is walled by Kyogre. Focus Sash Tyranitar will emerge victorious as long as it attacks on the first turn, as sandstorm will negate Deoxys-A's Focus Sash while keeping Tyranitar's intact.</p> <p>A support Dialga is a fantastic partner for Deoxys-A; it resists all common priority moves in Ubers, while also being able to set up Stealth Rock. It also roasts Forretress and Scizor with Flamethrower, while nailing Giratina-O and Giratina with Draco Meteor. Although risky, Dialga can survive a Life Orb Rayquaza's Draco Meteor and OHKO it in the process. It can also fare nicely against Kyogre thanks to its handy resistance to Surf and can dispatch of the enormous whale with the appropriate attack. Although slapping a Choice Scarf on Dialga is a valid option to deal with lead Rayquaza, it would only be able to do so through revenge killing, and would also not be able to set up Stealth Rock adequately. Support Groudon is a decent option to pair with Deoxys-A, especially if Scarf Dialga is chosen for your team. Groudon can set up Stealth Rock to help other sweepers, while being able to paralyze or attack Pokemon who are problematic for Deoxys-A. Since Deoxys-A excels at eliminating Deoxys-S, the premier Spikes user in the tier, Pokemon who benefit from limited entry hazards make good partners. Kyogre, especially Water Spout variants, deserve special mention, as continually switching into Spikes quickly weakens its power. Other Choiced Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf Palkia and Choice Band Scizor, also make good partners since they have no form of recovery and tend to switch around often.</p> "

Deoxys-A is the second fastest Stealth Rock user in Uber behind Deoxys-S, but unlike its slightly speedier counterpart, Deoxys-A can actually eliminate other leads thanks to its stellar offensive stats. Like the other lead set, opposing Deoxys-S, Groudon, Kyogre, and Mew are easily dealt with, and thanks to its ability to lay down Stealth Rock swiftly, Deoxys-A is an excellent choice for teams that want to set the offensive tempo early.</p> <p>This Deoxys-A plays very similarly to the Attacking Lead. Once again, the ubiquitous Deoxys-S leads are defeated by the combination of Signal Beam and Extremespeed. Signal Beam is chosen over Shadow Ball here to OHKO Darkrai, who doesn't take much damage from anything else on this set due to the lack of Superpower. Signal Beam still nails Deoxys-S and Mew leads, and it's actually stronger than the Attacking Lead's Shadow Ball. The slight confusion rate can also be useful in a pinch, and may save you from the odd Deoxys-S's Extreme Speed. Grass Knot is now much more powerful, OHKOing most Groudon leads and always 2HKOing Kyogre, no matter the variant. Once again, Ice Beam is an option in order to hit Rayquaza instead of Kyogre.</p> <p>With the absence of Superpower, more Pokemon can switch in on Deoxys-A with near impunity, although Deoxys-A will almost always succeed in laying down Stealth Rock. Dialga resists all attacks bar Ice Beam, and even that fails to do substantial damage. In return, Dialga can set up its own Stealth Rock and easily eliminate Deoxys-A. Blissey can also switch in with nothing to fear thanks to the absence of Superpower. Once again, Scizor and Forretress are problematic, while Giratina-O becomes even more of an issue without Shadow Ball. Depending on Deoxys-A's final attack, either Kyogre or Rayquaza will counter it. Choice Scarf Dialga is a fantastic teammate due to its ability to switch into and OHKO Scizor, Forretress, Giratina-O, and Rayquaza, as long as it doesn't come in on a STAB Dragon-type attack. As an offensively oriented Pokemon, Dialga also loves having Stealth Rock set up. Rock Polish Groudon and Nasty Plot Darkrai are excellent partners, as Stealth Rock helps wear down their counters and both can easily set up and eliminate Blissey and Dialga. Kyogre can greatly benefit from being paired up with this version of Deoxys-A. Not only does it dispatch Deoxys-S with Signal Beam and Extreme Speed to prevent Spikes from being set up, but Stealth Rock also ensures the 2HKO on Blissey from its Timid Choice Specs Water Spout, even after factoring in Leftovers.</p> "

Life Orb is an item seemingly made for Deoxys-A; it greatly appreciates the extra power, but it's the freedom to switch attacks that makes Deoxys-A such a frightening foe to face. Although Deoxys-A will require quite a bit of team support to successfully sweep, it can wreak absolute havoc if said support is successful in enabling Deoxys-A's sweep.</p> <p>Along with the power and freedom to switch attacks, the coverage provided by the listed attacks makes Deoxys-A extremely difficult to switch into. Ice Beam scores super effective damage on a huge portion of the Ubers metagame, while Thunder provides great coverage in conjunction with Ice Beam, hitting everything for neutral damage bar the extremely rare Lanturn, Magnezone, and Shedinja. Even with virtually no Attack investment, Superpower is still immensely powerful, OHKOing standard Blissey thanks to the Life Orb boost. It also provides fantastic coverage alongside Ice Beam and Thunder, nailing many bulky Pokemon such as Dialga for super effective damage. The last attack is very much up to you, but Shadow Ball is preferred for the ability to OHKO Mewtwo after Stealth Rock damage, while also nailing Mew and other Deoxys formes. Hidden Power Fire is a worthwhile option for Scizor, Forretress, and Jirachi, although they will already take huge damage from Life Orb Thunders. In addition, Hidden Power Fire can be an impediment because it requires an imperfect Speed IV as well as sun to be effective.</p> <p>There are two worthwhile EV spreads for this set. The first is the one listed, and is arguably the most effective. A Naive nature with 252 Speed EVs places Deoxys-A in an elite speed tier, outpacing everything up to and including +1 Adamant Rayquaza. It also, at worst, ties with opposing Deoxys and Deoxys-A, which could be the difference between getting KOed or pulling off a successful sweep. Despite the focus on Speed, Deoxys-A still achieves most of the KOs it requires. However, a worthwhile alternative, especially when using Hidden Power Fire, is a Rash nature with a spread of 16 Atk / 252 SpA / 240 Spe. This allows Deoxys-A to hit 395 Speed, beating Timid Mewtwo by one point even when factoring in the drop due to Hidden Power Fire's Speed IV. This leaves Deoxys-A at a very respectable Speed stat, while also granting far more power on the special side.</p> <p>Life Orb Deoxys-A needs a lot of support in order to function successfully, but given the right teammates, it can devastate teams. Due to its immense strength, there is no true counter to Deoxys-A. However, there are two types of Pokemon who do generally give Deoxys-A a hard time: Choice Scarf users and bulky Steel-types. The former can outpace and OHKO Deoxys-A with virtually anything due to its terrible defenses, while the latter can usually take a hit from anything other than Hidden Power Fire and KO Deoxys-A afterwards. As such, Wobbuffet is an excellent support teammate for Deoxys-A. Wobbuffet can come in and KO almost any Choice Scarf user with either Counter or Mirror Coat; it can also Encore a support move to give Deoxys-A a free switch in. Choice Scarf Magnezone with Hidden Power Fire can be a worthwhile partner for Deoxys-A to ensure that Steels are not a problem. Thanks to Magnet Pull, Steel-types like Forretress and Scizor will be unable to switch, making them sitting ducks for Magnezone. On top of this, fewer Pokemon in Ubers run Shed Shell since Magnezone is far less common than in standard play, making it both an effective and surprising tactic. Since most Pokemon are outpaced and 2HKOed at worst, smart switching and priority are two other effective means of beating Deoxys-A. Bringing in a counter that is normally 2HKOed by Deoxys-A on a resisted attack gives the counter an opportunity to survive the subsequent attack and retaliate. Common priority users like Scizor, Rayquaza, and Giratina-O can survive any non-super effective attack and use their respective priority attacks to KO Deoxys-A. As such, mixed or specially-based Dialga pairs well with Life Orb Deoxys-A, as it can come in on resisted priority moves and deal with the problematic Pokemon. In addition, if Deoxys-A is able to lure and KO Blissey beforehand, it will make it much easier for Dialga to sweep.</p> "

  "Deoxys-Defense": {
    "overview": "<p>Deoxys-D is an often overlooked Pokemon, and for good reason. While it has great defensive stats, its HP is lacking, and it simply can't stand up to the powerhouses that rampage through the Uber tier. It also receives competition from its sibling formes, most of which can play the support role better. Despite its tragic shortcomings, Deoxys-D can still help a team out with its fairly vast support movepool. However, it will need some assistance itself; do not expect to be able to just throw it onto a team and have it work for you. It may not be the first Pokemon you consider for your team, nor should it be, but it can certainly perform its roles well when given a chance.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Deoxys-D has a few other options not mentioned in the above sets, though most are gimmicky. A lead set is possible, but it is inferior to Deoxys-S in nearly every way. Calm Mind can be used to attempt to create a bulky setup sweeper, but its Special Attack is so low that it barely even scratches the majority of Ubers with its feeble assaults. A CounterCoat set is usable, but is unreliable and Deoxys-D has such low HP that it won't be bouncing much damage back anyway. Cosmic Power is an interesting choice to raise both of Deoxys-D's great defenses, but Deoxys-D is still vulnerable to Taunt and every Steel-type in Ubers. Using Light Clay with Reflect and Light Screen is plausible, but this set is severely outclassed by other dual screens users. Finally, Psycho Shift and Rest are both interesting options to rid Deoxys-D of status, but it usually has better things to do.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Heracross can switch into anything Deoxys-D throws at it, especially Toxic thanks to Guts, and proceed to Megahorn Deoxys-D into oblivion. If Deoxys-D doesn't have an Agility boost under its belt, fast Taunt users like Mewtwo and Darkrai beat it and set up with ease. Tyranitar doesn't really care what Deoxys-D does and can do massive damage with STAB Dark-type attacks, notably Pursuit if Deoxys-D tries to switch out.</p> <p>Deoxys-D cannot stand up to the likes of Choice Specs Dialga or Choice Specs Kyogre. Most Steel-types also wall Deoxys-D, as it has poor attacking stats and relies on Toxic for damage. Scizor can switch in and hit Deoxys-D with a powerful U-turn. Jirachi can paralyze Deoxys-D even when Taunted, thanks to Body Slam, and proceed to flinch it to death with Iron Head. Heatran has a 4x resistance to Ice Beam, the only attack that Deoxys-D ever carries and can torch Deoxys-D with sun-boosted Fire-type attacks. If Deoxys-D lacks Taunt, it can easily be Toxic stalled by Blissey with Aromatherapy. Even without Aromatherapy, Blissey can just heal itself of poison with Natural Cure.</p> ",

        "name": "Spikes",
        "description": "<p>While it may not be the best choice for setting up Spikes, Deoxys-D can certainly pull its weight. Though it has great Special Defense and Defense stats, they are unfortunately let down by a rather poor HP stat. The first slot goes to Spikes, allowing Deoxys-D to support the team by limiting the amount of switches the opponent can perform. Deoxys-D faces tough competition from Forretress, Skarmory, and Deoxys-S for a team slot, since all of them are also very competent at setting up Spikes; however, Deoxys-D has some advantages over the other Spikers. Deoxys-D boasts far higher Special Defense than Skarmory, but doesn't have the handy Steel typing that Skarmory does. Forretress is often used over Deoxys-D because it can also learn Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spin, but Deoxys-D has Recover, so it isn't completely outclassed by Forretress either. Finally, Deoxys-S is mainly used as a suicide lead, whereas Deoxys-D's superior bulk allows it to function well throughout the game.</p> <p>To keep Deoxys-D in tip-top condition, Recover is the preferred move in the second slot. Toxic works great in conjunction with Recover as it allows Deoxys-D to effectively stall out many threats with its decent bulk. The last slot is a bit of a toss-up. Ice Beam is useful to give Deoxys-D some form of offense, and has the ability to hit the multitude of Dragon-type Pokemon in Ubers for a hefty amount of damage. On the other hand, Taunt can be used to prevent Pokemon such as Forretress from setting up on Deoxys-D.</p> <p>Deoxys-D has a few more viable EV spreads to choose from. A spread of 252 HP / 176 Def / 82 SpD allows it to always survive a +1 Life Orb Outrage from Jolly Rayquaza; if you choose this spread, Ice Beam is obviously recommended over Taunt for the final slot. It is entirely possible to create an EV spread of your own to better fit your team, but it is crucial to remember to always max out Deoxys-D's HP first; since its defenses are so much higher than its HP, investing in HP increases its bulk exponentially more than investing in Special Defense or Defense. Investing more into Speed is also an option, as Deoxys-D has the same base Speed as a large number of Uber Pokemon.</p> <p>Deoxys-D also has a few other choices in terms of moves. Knock Off can be annoying for opponents, as oftentimes Pokemon will not be able to break through Deoxys-D's defenses without a boost from their item. If you would rather paralyze Pokemon instead of poisoning them, Thunder Wave can be used over Toxic. This comes with the drawback of Deoxys-D inflicting little to no damage to many Pokemon, however. The last move worth considering is Stealth Rock. Deoxys-D is strapped for move slots as it is, but Stealth Rock can be useful in place of another move to help Deoxys-D further support the team.</p> <p>Deoxys-D easily falls to many of the powerhouses--Choice Specs Dialga and Choice Specs Kyogre are a few that come to mind--that roam the Uber tier, so it is a good idea to use Deoxys-D on a defensively based team where teammates can pick up the slack. Blissey and Lugia are both great options to take powerful special and physical attacks that Deoxys-D can't handle, respectively. Groudon is also a useful partner thanks to its ability to lay down Stealth Rock and handle many physical attackers such as Tyranitar. Forretress can function as a great supporter too, lay down Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock and Rapid Spinning away hazards on your own side. On top of all this, a spinblocker is a crucial teammate for Deoxys-D to prevent it and its teammates' entry hazards from being spun away. Giratina-O and Giratina both fit the bill and can take Bug-type attacks from the likes of Heracross and Scizor that ravage Deoxys-D. Finally, phazers, such as Lugia and Groudon, can successfully capitalize on the entry hazards Deoxys-D sets down.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Toxic Stall",
        "description": "<p>While it may seem silly on paper, this set can be quite effective and aggravating to an opponent when used correctly. This set functions quite similarly to Mewtwo's Toxic Stalling set, although Mewtwo performs a little bit better due to its superior Speed, which enables it to forgo Agility for either Reflect or Light Screen. Mewtwo also has access to Will-O-Wisp, which it often uses over Toxic and alongside one of the aforementioned screens to shut out attackers of all types. Make no mistake, however, that while this set may be outclassed, Deoxys-D can still hold its own.</p> <p>Agility is the most important move on this set as, with the given EVs, it allows Deoxys-D to outspeed max Speed Deoxys-S, enabling Deoxys-D to Taunt Deoxys-S before it receives a Taunt in return. Agility also gives Deoxys-D enough Speed to outspeed Choice Scarf Garchomp, the fastest commonly used Choice Scarf user in Ubers. Deoxys-D has extremely poor attacking stats, so Toxic is used to allow Deoxys-D to stall out everything but Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon, the latter of which is almost never seen in Ubers. Taunt protects Deoxys-D from status and prevents opposing walls from recovering health or healing status. It also saves Deoxys-D from being Taunted, as Deoxys-D outspeeds every non-Choice Scarfed Pokemon--and therefore every Taunt user--after an Agility. Recover allows Deoxys-D to constantly heal while the opponents' Pokemon slowly die to poison damage.</p> <p>It is crucial to maximize Deoxys-D's HP stat when distributing EVs, but beyond that, it is up to you. It's perfectly feasible to use a Bold nature with some or all of the Special Defense EVs shifted to Defense. You can also lessen the investment in Speed to just hit key benchmarks and distribute the leftover EVs into Special Defense and Defense as you see fit. With no investment in Speed and a neutral nature, Deoxys-D will always outspeed Mewtwo after an Agility, but will be in turn outsped by nearly every common Choice Scarf user in Ubers. With 56 EVs invested in Speed, Deoxys-D will always outspeed all Pokemon with base 90 Speed wielding a Choice Scarf, so this benchmark is usable if your team has other ways of dealing with base 100 Speed Choice Scarf Pokemon. Finally, 136 Speed EVs allow Deoxys-D to outspeed Choice Scarf Garchomp, but at that point you may as well just bump it up to 148 EVs to allow Deoxys-D to outspeed Deoxys-S.</p> <p>As mentioned earlier, Steel-types have a field day with this set as Deoxys-D can't touch them, meaning it has to resort to either PP stalling (which is plausible with Pressure) or switching out. The latter is usually the best response to the situation, so Deoxys-D needs good teammates to switch into Steel-types, and other Pokemon that threaten it. Giratina makes a decent partner for Deoxys-D as it can Will-O-Wisp all Steel-types, bar Heatran, and proceed to stall them out. Giratina is also a good spinblocker, which is useful as Deoxys-D does best with the opponent's field layered with hazards. Forretress is a great option to set up entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, as it can easily set up on most Steel-types. It may seem odd to use Toxic Spikes in conjunction with Toxic, but Deoxys-D will often face the dilemma of using either Recover, Toxic, or Taunt, and having Toxic Spikes doing half the work for it will lessen the prediction needed. Giratina-O is also a good choice for a spinblocker if you are using a more offensively oriented team, as Giratina can slow down many teams. The two aforementioned spinblockers also counter Heracross well, which is a major threat to Deoxys-D, as it can easily crush Deoxys-D with Megahorn. Heatran is also a decent teammate that can eliminate annoying Steel-types with its powerful Fire-type attacks; it also can use Roar to abuse any entry hazards its teammates have laid down. Magnezone, while not often seen in Ubers, can be a great partner to Deoxys-D thanks to its ability, Magnet Pull, which allows it to trap and kill Steel-types.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Deoxys-D's overall defenses are still only slightly above average, meaning it struggles with powerful attacks from the likes of Kyogre and Dialga. This means that dedicated walls can be great teammates for Deoxys-D. Blissey can easily take almost every special attack thrown at it, making it an ideal partner for Deoxys-D. Lugia is a good choice for taking powerful physical attacks with its access to Roost and Reflect, although it is slightly hampered by its weakness to Stealth Rock. Skarmory can also take most physical attacks extremely well, walls quite a few Steel-types, possesses instant recovery in the form of Roost, can use Whirlwind to abuse entry hazards, and has the ability to set up Spikes to boot. Finally, Groudon can also take physical blows well, and has the ability to use Roar and set up Stealth Rock to further support the team. Groudon also keeps Tyranitar in check, who can cause headaches for Deoxys-D with its STAB Dark-type attacks.</p> "

With a Choice Scarf, Garchomp is an excellent revenge killer that can stop sweeps from both Swords Dance and Dragon Dance Rayquaza. With a Choice Band, Garchomp is a fast physical powerhouse that requires no set up. Given that chance though, Garchomp can use Swords Dance to become a sweeper that can bring even Bold Lugia to its knees, single-handedly crumpling the Uber metagame with its mighty STAB Outrage. Give Garchomp the chance to sweep, and it will respond quickly with devastation, leaving only dust in its wake.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Garchomp's movepool isn't massive compared to other Uber Pokemon. The moves listed are best choices for Garchomp in most scenarios.</p> <p>On the Choice Band or Choice Scarf sets, Crunch is a reasonable option over Stone Edge. Crunch can still 2HKO Lugia on the Choice Band set, while giving Garchomp a safer alternative against the omnipresent Psychic-types in Ubers. Given that Garchomp has better overall defenses than Swampert, running a defensive set that utilizes RestTalk or Stealth Rock may seem like a viable option, but Dialga is generally the better choice for this, as Dialga has no 4x weaknesses and has better defenses than Garchomp.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Timid Lugia is the best check for Garchomp. It can live by using Reflect, Roosting off the damage, and scaring Garchomp off with Ice Beam. However, Timid Lugia needs to watch out for Choice Scarf Garchomp's Stone Edge, as it will be 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. Groudon must invest heavily in HP and Defense in order to be a buffer against Garchomp. Unfortunately, Groudon is still at risk of being 2HKOed from a Swords Danced Outrage, while Thunder Wave will not paralyze Garchomp, thanks to its Ground-typing. Cresselia can easily switch into Garchomp that lack Swords Dance and retaliate with Ice Beam. Moonlight's recovery is boosted by Groudon's Drought, allowing Cresselia to more efficiently take hits from Garchomp. Skarmory and Bronzong can switch into Garchomp, especially because the vast majority of Garchomp lack Fire Fang or Fire Blast. Metagross can switch into a locked Outrage and KO Garchomp with Ice Punch.</p> <p>Many Pokemon can rely on their high Speed in order to revenge kill Garchomp. Keep in mind that the Choice Scarf set is an exception. Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Deoxys-A carry moves that threaten to OHKO Garchomp. Mewtwo commonly has Ice Beam to dispose of Garchomp quickly and also access to Will-O-Wisp and Reflect. A combination of Darkrai's STAB Dark Pulse, Dark Void, and Bad Dreams will usually force Garchomp to switch out. Deoxys-A can easily scare Garchomp off with Ice Beam, but cannot switch into Garchomp at all. Deoxys-S can always outpace Garchomp, with enough Speed investment, and bring it down with Ice Beam. For the non Choice Scarf sets, Latios, Latias, and Choice Scarf Dragon Pokemon can revenge kill Garchomp. This can be risky though, because Haban Berry Garchomp will survive any of the faster Dragon-type attacks, bar a Draco Meteor from Soul Dew Latios or Latias. For any user of Ice Beam, 269 Special Attack minimum is required in order to OHKO Garchomp.</p> <p>Sand Veil makes countering Garchomp difficult. Because Sand Veil reduces Ice Beam's accuracy to 80%, it may sometimes miss, resulting in Garchomp gaining a KO. Dark Void suffers an accuracy cut from 80% to 64%. Thankfully, Rayquaza's Air Lock prevents Sand Veil from screwing up Extreme Speed's accuracy.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Garchomp is an excellent revenge killer and cleaner in the Uber environment. Thanks to its base 102 Speed, Garchomp can easily outrun and revenge kill almost every other Dragon-type used in Ubers. Choice Scarf Garchomp is also one of the few things that can revenge kill both Dragon Dance and Swords Dance Rayquaza, thanks to its good defenses and higher Speed. Note that if Garchomp is a team's main method of dealing with Swords Dance Rayquaza, it is advisable to try keeping Garchomp at near full health until it has KOed it, as a Swords Danced, Life Orb Adamant Rayquaza deals 80%-94% to Garchomp with Extreme Speed and may KO it if it has previously taken any residual damage.</p> <p>Outrage is important for this set, because Garchomp does not have the power of Choice Band to boost its attacks, Outrage's STAB and 120 Base Power help make up for the lack of a boost. STAB Earthquake is also important for coverage, taking out Steel-types such as Dialga, and Metagross. Dragon Claw is weaker than Outrage; however, it retains Garchomp's freedom to switch out of battle if the need be. Stone Edge is the best option for the final moveslot, as it is capable of OHKOing Ho-Oh and, with Stealth Rock damage, has a chance of 2HKOing Timid Lugia. A Fire-typed move can also be used in the last slot (either Fire Blast or Fire Fang) if you are bringing sun support, to do a severe amount of damage to Forretress and Scizor. Toxic can also be used in place of Stone Edge to cripple Lugia and Groudon.</p> <p>If using Dragon Claw on this set, Stealth Rock support is very important. Without Stealth Rock, Garchomp's Dragon Claw cannot OHKO Palkia or Rayquaza. Steel-types such as Forretress and Scizor, can easily switch into Garchomp's Dragon-type attacks and set up entry hazards or attack, while Lugia and Deoxys-D can also switch into any attack and wall Garchomp. Because of these checks, support Dialga can be a fantastic teammate for Choice Scarf Garchomp, resisting most of the Steel-type Pokemon's attacks, and with the ability to either OHKO them with Fire Blast or set up Stealth Rock. Dialga can also cripple Lugia and Deoxys-D with Toxic. Choice Specs Kyogre can be a very useful teammate as well. Not only does Choice Specs Kyogre easily OHKO most of Garchomp's checks with its STAB, but Choice Scarf Garchomp can also revenge kill Palkia and Latias, or switch into Thunders aimed at Kyogre in return. Finally, Wobbuffet can easily switch into any of Garchomp's attacks, bar Outrage (which only has a 22% chance of 2HKOing 28 HP / 228 Def neutral natured Wobbuffet with Leftovers, even after switching into Stealth Rock), and KO with Counter. There isn't much that can be done to solve this, beyond predicting a Wobbuffet switch-in, because Garchomp will be trapped, due to Wobbuffet's Shadow Tag ability. Darkrai and Taunt Mewtwo can use Wobbuffet as set up bait, so using them alongside Garchomp is not a bad idea.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Garchomp's main advantage over Rayquaza as a Swords Dance sweeper is its Speed. Seven base points may not seem like much, but outspeeding Hasty Palkia is invaluable. It also gives Garchomp a chance of decimating most Latias who don't invest heavily in Speed. The lack of Extreme Speed is rather unfortunate for Garchomp, but with its bulk, typing, and ability, it's still very viable. Immunity to Thunder also allows Garchomp to potentially switch into Choice Specs Kyogre and obtain a free Swords Dance while Kyogre switches out.</p> <p>After a Swords Dance, and with the power boost of Life Orb, Garchomp is nearly unstoppable offensively; being able to outspeed a large portion of the Uber metagame and outright OHKO even Support Groudon, one of the most physically defensive Pokemon in the tier, after 3 layers of Spikes and Stealth Rock. This, added to a STAB Earthquake with which to wreck grounded Steel-types, such as Dialga and Metagross, that are able to take a boosted Outrage, and you'll realize that there are very few Pokemon left that can be relied on to defeat Garchomp.</p> <p>Some other item options that also work well when using Swords Dance Garchomp are Haban and Yache Berry; the former allows Garchomp survive any Dragon-type move from a faster Dragon-type Pokemon, bar Draco Meteors from Soul Dew Latias and Latios, and KO them, while the latter works in a similar manner, but with Ice-type attacks. It is worth noting that Garchomp is still OHKOed by a Choice Specs Kyogre's Ice Beam even with a Yache Berry. Also note that OHKOs on Groudon and Lugia are lost if you use any other item besides Life Orb, and will require entry hazard support to be reattained.</p> <p>Dragon Claw is a useful option over Outrage if being locked into one move is a problem for you. The Base Power is an issue, however, and it can lose some important KOs; for example, Giratina is only 2HKOed by Dragon Claw after a Swords Dance, but an Outrage with the same boosts easily OHKOes it. If you are using Life Orb, this will become less of an issue, because it will often resecure such KOs with Stealth Rock support. Fire Fang is an option over Stone Edge if your team has ways of dealing with Lugia, as Fire Fang can OHKO Forretress and Scizor, as well as Skarmory with Stealth Rock, if it is not raining.</p> <p>Wobbuffet is an excellent teammate for Swords Dance Garchomp for a number of reasons. Thanks to Shadow Tag, Wobbuffet can trap and KO Choice Scarfed Dragon-types with either Mirror Coat or Counter, eliminating one of the main barriers to Garchomp's sweep. Wobbuffet can also help Garchomp set up a Swords Dance with Encore. Additionally, Wobbuffet can use Tickle to lower Lugia's Defense. After two Tickles, Choice Band Tyranitar can OHKO Lugia with Pursuit as it switches. With Lugia gone, Garchomp will have a much easier time sweeping, and can more comfortably opt to run Fire Fang. Scizor is a helpful partner that can beat offensive Mewtwo who lack Fire-type moves. Choice Scarf Heracross and Sleep Talk Kyogre can switch into the faster Darkrai's Dark Void. Even with Garchomp's 102 base Speed, many Ubers still can outspeed and OHKO it. Therefore, paralysis support can be helpful for stopping faster foes from disrupting its sweep. This is especially true when Garchomp is not running a type-resist Berry. Lugia is a good choice for paralysis support, as it often lures in Mewtwo and Darkrai, and can promptly cripple them with Thunder Wave. Thunder Wave Kyogre is another good choice, because it can lure in Choice Scarf Palkia and Latias.</p> "

Earthquake will also OHKO most Dialga (unless it has used Bulk Up once) and any other grounded Steel-type in Ubers. Outrage is an excellent clean-up attack to use once the main threats to Garchomp have been eliminated, and can even 2HKO Support Groudon after Stealth Rock. Outrage should always be used with extreme caution though, because once it is used, Garchomp cannot switch out and is forced to use it repeatedly.</p> <p>Stone Edge is Garchomp's best move against Lugia, and although Garchomp should not square off against Timid Lugia, Bold Lugia will be 2HKOed by Stone Edge after Stealth Rock. As with the Choice Scarf set, Dragon Claw is useful for finishing off weakened Pokemon without any of the issues of the other moves.</p> <p>This set has issues with faster Pokemon with super effective moves; specifically Mewtwo, Darkrai, Latias, Latios, and any Dragon-type with a Choice Scarf. The Uber Trapper Scizor is a good Pokemon to use to deal with these threats, as it is able to switch into any Choiced Dragon-type move, and then Roost away the damage, predict a switch and use Pursuit, or use U-turn to scout the next switch-in. Scizor can also beat Darkrai if Sleep Clause is in effect, in addition to checking offensive Mewtwo and Latias that lack a Fire-type move or Thunder. Heracross is another viable teammate for Choice Band Garchomp, because Heracross can absorb Darkrai's Dark Void and also switch into a defensive Mewtwo's Will-O-Wisp, thanks to its ability, Guts. Finally, Choice Band Tyranitar can easily defeat both Latias and Latios, thanks to the Special Defense boost granted by Sand Stream. The sandstorm it brings also makes Choice Band Garchomp harder to beat, thanks to the evasion boost that Sand Veil grants it.</p> "

Because Garchomp will be at low HP after the Salac Berry activates, Outrage is worth considering due to its higher Base Power over Dragon Claw. Even with a Swords Dance, there are a number of Pokemon Garchomp will still be unable to KO with either of its other attacking moves. Outrage offers the strongest alternative possible, at the risk of being walled after using it. Whichever Dragon-type attack you choose, Earthquake is the best move to pair with it, offering the most additional coverage and STAB. Stone Edge isn't worth considering on this set; you lose the guaranteed OHKO on Lugia, but Dragon and Ground offer far superior coverage than any other combination, and you still maintain a slim chance of OHKOing Lugia with Outrage after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Much like the Swords Dance set, SubSalac Garchomp has a much easier time sweeping with Wobbuffet as a teammate. Bold Lugia can use his combination of Reflect, Roost, and Ice Beam to defeat Garchomp, since Garchomp is no longer using Stone Edge. Choice Band Tyranitar will easily KO a fleeing Lugia after Wobbuffet Tickles it twice, providing Garchomp with a much easier opportunity at sweeping. Wobbuffet can also use Encore to help Garchomp set up, while Tyranitar's Sand Stream will boost its evasion, making it even more difficult to take down.</p> <p>Due to Garchomp using Substitute to lower its HP for a Speed boost, users of priority moves can be a problem after Garchomp's Substitute is broken. The main users of priority moves in Ubers are Rayquaza, the Deoxys formes, Scizor, and Lucario. It is best that these threats are KOed before you try and set up SubSalac Garchomp. Choice Scarf Magnezone can be a useful teammate because of this, as it can revenge kill Rayquaza who lacks a Speed boost and trap Lucario and Scizor. However, Groudon can easily set up on Magnezone locked into Thunder. When using Magnezone, rain or sun support are welcome additions to boost Thunder and Hidden Power Fire respectively. Gengar is a great teammate for Garchomp as well. Gengar can easily lure in Scizor and OHKO it with Hidden Power Fire. Gengar also has the option of using Hidden Power Ice to OHKO Rayquaza. With Stealth Rock support, Rayquaza will be OHKOed by Life Orb Gengar's Icy Wind as well, allowing the use of Hidden Power Fire with it.</p> "

  "Lucario": {
    "overview": "<p>Do not be fooled by Lucario's seemingly underwhelming base 110 Attack (by Uber standards). Thanks to access to moves such as Swords Dance and Close Combat, Lucario is fully capable of smashing through Uber teams. Additionally, Lucario has a superb defensive typing that gives it a Dragon-type resistance, a 4x resistance to Dark-type attacks and Stealth Rock, as well as an immunity to Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>Lucario's potent offenses, however, is offset by middling Speed and rather meager defenses, which are rendered even weaker in the immensely threatening Uber environment. Extreme Speed largely compensates for the former. The latter, however, can be worked around only by playing to Lucario's resistances or by placing a Wobbuffet on your team to provide support. Furthermore, in order to assure that the sweeping sets are not taken down prematurely, Lucario should either weaken its counters early with Close Combat or be provided with sufficient entry hazard support. Follow these guidelines, and Lucario can certainly crush teams with its mighty Close Combat!</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With a Choice Band, Lucario's Close Combats are so powerful that they can OHKO Palkia and minimum HP Kyogre after Stealth Rock damage. However, Choice Band Lucario can easily be picked off by Wobbuffet if it is locked into Close Combat and generally does better with a Life Orb. Choice Specs Lucario is notable for its ability to 2HKO Groudon with Aura Sphere but is otherwise unremarkable by Uber standards. At first glance, a Calm Mind set with Life Orb may seem appealing due to its ability to 2HKO Blissey, but its generally outclassed by Swords Dance Lucario. Metal Sound allows Lucario to OHKO Groudon with Aura Sphere, but Lucario's lackluster defenses make it difficult to constantly use Metal Sound. Lucario is fully capable of using Substitute and Salac Berry on a Swords Dance set to defeat Giratina that lack Roar although it will greatly miss the added damage from Life Orb. In a similar manner, Agility Lucario can use Substitute and a Liechi Berry. A Reversal set may seem appealing as well with Substitute or Endure; priority attacks, however, ruin its effectiveness.</p> <p>If you are wary about the defense drops of Close Combat, Lucario can opt to use Low Kick, as many Ubers are heavy enough to be hit by the full 120 Base Power of the move, but it comes with the drawback that many lightweight Pokemon such as Jirachi and Manaphy will take piddling damage from it. Blaze Kick is a decent move on non-Swords Dance Lucario if you're desperate to OHKO Scizor and Forretress and 2HKO Skarmory, but those KOs come only in the sun and the move does little else. Lucario can run Magnet Rise to try setting up on some Groudon but must give up Extreme Speed or Crunch, and Groudon will still win if it has Thunder Wave, Roar, or a Fire-type attack. Reversal is a reasonable option over Close Combat on the lead set, since Lucario is often left at 1 HP but will only outperform Close Combat if Lucario is left with less than 9% of its maximum HP. Copycat is very situational but can be useful on the lead set. It may allow you to set up Stealth Rock and/or Spikes on Skarmory, Forretress (though it may Rapid Spin), and Deoxys-S (until it Taunts you).</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Generally, Lucario's biggest counters in Ubers are very physically bulky Pokemon that can either OHKO, cripple, or phaze it. Defensive Groudon is the premier example as it is never OHKOed by a +2 Close Combat while it easily OHKOes in response with Earthquake. Lugia outspeeds, puts a Reflect up, and can Whirlwind Lucario away before it does much damage, and Giratina can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Garchomp defeats the Swords Dance set so long as it doesn't switch into Close Combat, but will falter against Agility Lucario with Ice Punch. Mewtwo is bulky enough to survive a +2 Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock and Spikes most of the time, and then OHKO Lucario with Aura Sphere. Rayquaza, while KOed by a +2 Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil, can sacrifice itself to defeat Lucario. Salamence, although uncommon, has an easier time handling Swords Dance Lucario than Rayquaza thanks to Intimidate. Choice Scarf users that resist Extreme Speed such as Dialga, Tyranitar, Metagross, and Heatran can revenge kill Swords Dance Lucario without any difficulty, but struggle if they switch into Close Combat or face Agility Lucario. Gengar in particular can switch into both Close Combat and Extreme Speed and threaten to OHKO Lucario with Focus Blast or Hidden Power Fire in the sun.</p> <p>As for Agility Lucario, healthy Wobbuffet (&gt;50% max HP), Groudon, and Giratina-O can easily revenge kill the Agility set, and Skarmory can attempt to outstall it with Roost. Extremely fast Choice Scarf users such as Darkrai, Shaymin-S, and Mewtwo will outspeed and OHKO it even after the Agility.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Notorious for its sweeping capabilities in OU, Swords Dance Lucario is capable of being a potent late-game sweeper in the Uber metagame as well. While at first glance Lucario may look like an inferior Rayquaza, Lucario's access to Close Combat and excellent typing ensure that it's not outclassed.</p> <p>After one Swords Dance, Close Combat will deal an obscene amount of damage; even the most defensive of Kyogre will almost always be OHKOed after Stealth Rock damage, while Jolly Lucario has a high chance of OHKOing the less bulky offensive Groudon after Stealth Rock damage. While Lucario's Extreme Speed is much weaker than Rayquaza's, it's still very useful for its ability to allow Lucario to sweep through weakened teams, and can allow Lucario to revenge kill in emergencies. Finally, Crunch is necessary for Swords Dance Lucario due to its ability to OHKO minimum HP Giratina-O after Stealth Rock damage, and deal a huge amount of damage to Wobbuffet.</p> <p>The decision between Jolly or Adamant on Swords Dance Lucario can be difficult. The main reason to run Jolly is to always outspeed Naive Giratina-O that use Hidden Power Fire, so it is unable to stop Lucario's sweep unless it is in the KO range of Shadow Sneak. On the other hand, Adamant clinches several important KOs over Jolly. To help you decide on the nature, a table comparing damage calculations is included below. All calculations assume that Lucario has used Swords Dance once.</p> <ul> <li>Jolly Close Combat vs. 112/8 Groudon: 91.3% - 107.6% <li>Jolly Close Combat vs. 252/252+ Impish Groudon: 63.4% - 75%</li> <li>Jolly Extreme Speed vs. 4/0 Darkrai: 78.3% - 92.2%</li> <li>Jolly Extreme Speed vs. 4/0 Mewtwo: 62.4% - 73.4%</li> <li>Jolly Extreme Speed vs. 4/0 Palkia: 62.4% - 73.6%</li> <li>Jolly Extreme Speed vs. 4/0- Palkia: 70.1% - 82.6%</li> <li>Jolly Extreme Speed vs. 4/0 Kyogre: 64.6% - 76%</li> <li>Jolly Extreme Speed vs. 0/4 Rayquaza: 62.4% - 73.5%</li> <li>Jolly Extreme Speed vs. 4/0 Shaymin-S: 74.6% - 88%</li> <li>Jolly Extreme Speed vs. 4/0 Latios: 80.7% - 95%</li> <li>Jolly Extreme Speed vs. 112/0 Latias: 67.2% - 79%</li> <li>Jolly Crunch vs. 28/252+ Wobbuffet: 76.1% - 89.8%</li> <li>Jolly Crunch vs. 0/0 Giratina-O: 91.2% - 107.5%</li> <li>Jolly Crunch vs. 96/0 Giratina-O: 87% - 102.6%</li> <li>Adamant Close Combat vs. 112/8 Groudon: 99.5% - 117.3%</li> <li>Adamant Close Combat vs. 252/252+ Impish Groudon: 69.8% - 82.4%</li> <li>Adamant Extreme Speed vs. 4/0 Darkrai: 85.4% - 100.7%</li> <li>Adamant Extreme Speed vs. 4/0 Mewtwo: 68.1% - 80.2%</li> <li>Adamant Extreme Speed vs. 4/0 Palkia: 68.6% - 81.1%</li> <li>Adamant Extreme Speed vs. 4/0- Palkia: 76.3% - 90%</li> <li>Adamant Extreme Speed vs. 4/0 Kyogre: 70.5% - 83%</li> <li>Adamant Extreme Speed vs. 0/4 Rayquaza: 68.4% - 80.6%</li> <li>Adamant Extreme Speed vs. 4/0 Shaymin-S: 81.9% - 96.5%</li> <li>Adamant Extreme Speed vs. 4/0 Latios: 88.4% - 104.3%</li> <li>Adamant Extreme Speed vs. 112/0 Latias: 73.3% - 86.3%</li> <li>Adamant Crunch vs. 28/252+ Wobbuffet: 83.7% - 98.9%</li> <li>Adamant Crunch vs. 0/0 Giratina-O: 100.2% - 118.4%</li> <li>Adamant Crunch vs. 96/0 Giratina-O: 95.7% - 113%</li> </ul> <p>Unlike Rayquaza, Lucario can be used early in the game thanks to its 4x resistance to Stealth Rock (making switching in and out far less punishing). Generally, the best way to play Lucario early in the game is to use Close Combat without boosting, as this will wear down many of Lucario's checks. For example, if a Palkia switches into Close Combat, it will take such a massive amount of damage that it will be in the KO range of Extreme Speed! In a similar manner, Garchomp, Rayquaza, Latias, Latios, and most Mewtwo will no longer be able to take a +2 Extreme Speed after switching into Close Combat once. With entry hazard support, Close Combat will often put defensive Groudon into the KO range of a +2 Close Combat. Finally, Lucario will OHKO any Choice Scarf Dialga that dares to switch in. If Giratina-O is a concern, usually due to choosing Adamant, using Crunch on the switch can also be acceptable.</p> <p>This particular set has several problems. If it is at full health, Garchomp (and Palkia to a lesser extent) will be able to switch in on a Swords Dance and threaten to OHKO it. Choice Scarf users such as Dialga, Heatran, Tyranitar, and Metagross can also switch into Lucario as it uses Swords Dance, and OHKO Lucario with Fire-type or Ground-type attacks. Finally, if Rayquaza switches in at full health, it will usually be able to barely survive a boosted Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock damage (though Life Orb recoil will usually KO it in return) and OHKO Lucario with Earthquake or Fire Blast.</p> <p>Wobbuffet makes a superb partner for Lucario, as it can revenge kill most of the Choice Scarf users that give Lucario trouble. Thunder Wave Kyogre is an excellent Palkia and Latias lure, can defeat Heatran, and otherwise provide useful paralysis support that can improve Lucario's chances to successfully sweep. Latias and Latios can switch into the Fire-, Water-, Electric-, and Ground-type attacks that are aimed at Lucario and either set-up or attack. In a similar manner, Garchomp can switch into the Fire-type attacks that Heatran, Rayquaza, Palkia, and Dialga may aim at Lucario and threaten to KO in response.</p> "

        "name": "Agility",
        "description": "<p>This set plays very similarly to Rock Polish Groudon. While Lucario's Close Combats are just a bit less powerful than Groudon's Earthquakes, Lucario's brilliant typing once again ensures that Lucario is not outclassed. The most notable advantages are Ice- and Dragon-type resistances and immunity to Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>After one use of Agility, Lucario will reach a Speed stat of 558, allowing it to outspeed neutral-natured Choice Scarf Mewtwo. Close Combat is once again Lucario's sweeping move of choice as it easily OHKOs Dialga and Darkrai, and OHKOs Hasty Palkia 87% of the time after Stealth Rock damage. If you have Stealth Rock and Spikes support, Lucario's Close Combat will even be able to OHKO Timid Palkia and minimum HP Kyogre! Crunch is your main tool against the many Psychic-types that infest the Uber metagame. Latios is always OHKOed by Crunch after Stealth Rock damage, while most variants of Latias, Mewtwo, Wobbuffet, and Giratina-O are 2HKOed (very defensive Mewtwo, Bold 28 / 228 Wobbuffet, and defensive Giratina-o may survive). Ice Punch is usually the best choice in the last slot as it allows Lucario to OHKO Shaymin-S, Rayquaza, and Garchomp. If your team has few problems with Garchomp, you can use Stone Edge which will still OHKO Rayquaza and Shaymin-S after Stealth Rock damage and will OHKO Ho-Oh, who will be a problem when using Ice Punch.</p> <p>This Lucario will have serious problems sweeping if Wobbuffet is alive. While Crunch will 2HKO Wobbuffet, it can use Counter to revenge kill Lucario. In a similar manner, Giratina-O will always survive one Crunch and can weaken Lucario with Draco Meteor and Shadow Sneak or even KO with Hidden Power Fire (in the sun) followed by Shadow Sneak. Maximum HP Kyogre can survive a Close Combat at full health (although it will have a 33% chance of being OHKOed if Stealth Rock and Spikes are on the battlefield), and then threaten to OHKO Lucario with Surf. While Specially Defensive Skarmory is 2HKOed by Close Combat, it is able to stall out Close Combat's PP due to Roost. As mentioned before, without Stone Edge, Lucario will never 2HKO Ho-Oh while it can easily OHKO Lucario with Sacred Fire. Positive-natured Choice Scarf users such as Darkrai, Shaymin-S, and Mewtwo can outspeed Lucario even after an Agility and OHKO it. Finally, unlike Swords Dance Lucario, every type of Groudon will give this set problems.</p> <p>Wobbuffet is unfortunately impossible to counter. A good way of knocking it into Lucario's KO range is to lure in Wobbuffet with mixed attackers that commonly carry Choice Scarf (such as Palkia and Dialga). Offensive Lugia can also be used to lure in and 2HKO Wobbuffet with a Calm Mind-boosted Aeroblast. You can also bluff a Haban Garchomp as a Choice Scarf Garchomp and use Swords Dance as Wobbuffet attempts to Counter. A Wobbuffet of your own can defeat Choice Scarf Shaymin-S and Choice Scarf Mewtwo and can help Lucario find time to set up. Ho-Oh is almost impossible to counter; thus it's best to simply team up Lucario with users of Stone Edge to deal with Ho-Oh. Latias and Latios can usually handle Kyogre, take Choice Scarf Darkrai's Focus Blasts, and switch into Groudon's Earthquakes. Mixed Bulk Up Dialga makes a superb Skarmory and Groudon lure by baiting them with Bulk Up, and then smashing them with Fire Blast and Draco Meteor respectively. Dialga is also capable of defeating Giratina-O if it uses a Hasty nature.</p> "

        "name": "Attacking Lead",
        "description": "<p>When equipped with a Focus Sash, Lucario can defeat several prominent leads in the Uber metagame. While Payback may seem like a strange choice, it's a very important move in this set because it allows Lucario to defeat Deoxys-S leads. Payback will put even maximum HP Deoxys-S into the KO range of Extreme Speed, limiting it to setting up only one entry hazard. Close Combat is once again Lucario's most powerful option. It always 2HKOes lead Kyogre and Dialga, neither of whom can OHKO thanks to Focus Sash. Due to Lucario's immunity to sandstorm, it will defeat any kind of Tyranitar lead with ease. When up against Deoxys-A, Lucario will usually lose to a combination of Superpower and Extreme Speed but will at least be able to break its Focus Sash. If Deoxys-A lacks Superpower or uses Stealth Rock on the first turn, Lucario will usually be able to defeat it with two Extreme Speeds.</p> <p>Several appealing options are available for Lucario's last move. Ice Punch is one of the best options, as Shaymin-S will be unable to flinch you thanks to Inner Focus while Lucario can OHKO in response. Ice Punch will also defeat Rayquaza leads that lack Focus Sash. Swords Dance can be useful if you predict a switch from your opponent, and it often allows Lucario to deal a massive amount of damage to at least one Pokemon on the team. Swords Dance is also useful in case the opponent's team is ever weak enough to be swept. Finally, if you predict that a Groudon lead will use Stealth Rock, Swords Dance allows you to 2HKO Groudon with Close Combat. If you are confident in your prediction skills, Counter can be used to gain a surprise kill on enemy Groudon.</p> <p>Depending on your choice, Lucario will face different problems. Without Ice Punch, Shaymin-S and Rayquaza will defeat you. Regardless of what moves you choose, lead Giratina-O will always defeat you since Ice Punch cannot 2HKO it (although it will deal a significant amount of damage). Against Groudon, unless Lucario uses Swords Dance and Groudon uses Stealth Rock, Lucario has no chance of KOing it without a critical hit.</p> <p>Latias makes a superb teammate for lead Lucario, it can take all of Shaymin-S's attacks as long as Air Slash does not flinch too many times and deal a massive amount of damage with Dragon Pulse. Latias is also capable of switching into Rayquaza's and Giratina-O's Fire-type attacks and can OHKO both of them with Dragon Pulse (be warned though, as some lead Rayquaza have Focus Sash). Although they share weaknesses, Heatran is the best check to most lead Giratina-O. Heatran can also handle lead Rayquaza that lack Brick Break. Tyranitar checks Giratina-O well and can Pursuit it if it tries to escape. RestTalk Kyogre can defeat Darkrai leads and, with some defensive investment, can also defeat most Groudon leads. In a similar manner, Bulk Up Dialga can absorb Darkrai's Dark Void and can also defeat Giratina-O one-on-one. Levitate Bronzong can be a good partner due to its immunity to Shaymin-S's and Groudon's Ground-type attacks and its ability to set up Stealth Rock.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Mamoswine is a Pokemon with many great traits, and many serious flaws; starting with the flaws, he has 5 weaknesses: Fire, Water, Grass, Steel, and Fighting, most of which are easily exploitable. This, combined with one useless resistance to Poison, one immunity to Electric that is difficult to take advantage of, and subpar Speed and defenses, greatly hamper Mamoswine's potential.</p> <p>However, it's in the lead position, where these flaws are less significant, that his traits truly stand out. Stealth Rock, a fairly powerful STAB Earthquake, STAB priority that destroys Shaymin-S, a demon to most suicide leads, and the ability to retain his Focus Sash in both sandstorm and hail, combine together to make Mamoswine a surprisingly effective suicide lead.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Avalanche is an option over Endeavor to deal more damage than Earthquake if Mamoswine takes a hit. It almost always OHKOes Giratina-O (it has a small chance to survive if it isn't running a Defense reducing nature). Even if it does survive, Ice Shard will finish it off before it can Shadow Sneak unless it has invested heavily in Speed. Avalanche + Ice Shard usually beats Careful Groudon, unfortunately, this nature is not always used, and this combination will fail against an Impish Groudon.</p> <p>Mamoswine can be used outside the lead role for a more offensive approach, wielding a Choice Band or Life Orb, but Mamoswine lacks the Speed to be an effective sweeper or wallbreaker, and its only high-powered STAB without a drawbrack, Earthquake, doesn't affect many of the Ubers. Also, being locked into a move which something like Rayquaza can come into and get a free turn of set up is not a good idea. STAB Ice Shard generally does not compensate for Mamoswine's faults. The former is very predictable, and the only foe who fears it and who Mamoswine can reliably switch into is Garchomp, whom Mamoswine can only switch into once, as Mamoswine gets 2HKOed by Earthquake. Rayquaza, Latias, and Latios can all OHKO Mamoswine on the switch-in with the right attack, even Latias's Dragon Pulse can OHKO him with Stealth Rock support. Otherwise Ice Shard usually doesn't deal enough damage to Pokemon that aren't weak to it. Avalanche may initially be more appealing on such a set, but Mamoswine cannot afford to move last; his common weaknesses and poor Defenses mean many attacks in Ubers will OHKO him.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Darkrai puts Mamoswine to sleep with Dark Void while simultaneously removing his Focus Sash with Bad Dreams. Mamoswine only removes, on average, less than a third of Darkrai's HP with Ice Shard. Deoxys-A can set up Stealth Rock, bring Mamoswine down to 1 HP, and then finish him off with Extreme Speed before he can do the same with Ice Shard. Lead Rayquaza holding a Focus Sash will either let Mamoswine set up Stealth Rock while it remains at full HP, or Mamoswine will break its Sash and be KOed in the process, all the while not being able to set up Stealth Rock due to Rayquaza's Extreme Speed. Forretress removes Stealth Rock and Mamoswine's Focus Sash with Rapid Spin whilst setting up its own entry hazards and only being 3HKOed or 4HKOed by Earthquake depending on the damage rolls.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Mamoswine can set Stealth Rock up against every common lead bar Darkrai. Earthquake is his main STAB, whilst Ice Shard finishes off weakened foes, particularly ones who survive on 1 HP thanks to Focus Sash, and destroys Shaymin-S, who troubles most other suicide leads. After setting up Stealth Rock, Mamoswine should use Endeavour against slower leads, like Dialga and Kyogre, to bring their HP down, often to 1 HP thanks to Mamoswine's subpar Special Defense and exploitable weaknesses. These foes can then be easily finished off by a teammate.</p> <p>Adamant is the preferred nature; even without a Speed-boosting nature, Mamoswine outruns the many base 90 Speed Uber leads, such as Groudon, Dialga, and non-Choiced Kyogre, as they rarely choose to invest in their own Speed. However, Uber Pokemon who invest in Speed will usually use 252 EVs, bar some Speed creep, and therefore outspeed even Jolly Mamoswine. There aren't any significant Pokemon a Jolly nature will outspeed. The extra power provided by Adamant outweighs getting the Speed jump on Pokemon rarely seen in Ubers, such as Adamant Heracross and positive natured Heatran.</p> <p>A Defense reducing nature and 0 IVs in HP and both Defenses is an option, but they don't help against the common Uber leads, and the extra durability is generally more useful.</p> <p>A sleep absorber is needed to take Darkrai's Dark Void; otherwise, you risk having a Pokemon put out of commission for the entire match. Sleep Talk Kyogre and Heracross, and Choice Scarf Primeape can switch into Dark Void and threaten to OHKO Darkrai.</p> <p>Deoxys-A can set up Stealth Rock, take Mamoswine down to 1 HP, and finish it off with a priority move. Mamoswine can do the same to it, but Deoxys-A wins the match--up thanks to its superior Speed. Lead Rayquaza will keep its Focus Sash should you decide to set up Stealth Rock, KOing Mamoswine with the combination of Draco Meteor or Fire Blast followed by Extreme Speed. Tyranitar is a great teammate; after removing Deoxys-A's Focus Sash with one of Mamoswine's moves, Tyranitar can easily switch into the incoming Extreme Speed, shrug it off, and finish it off with sandstorm's residual damage. As a plus, Mamoswine won't lose its Focus Sash to sandstorm, unlike most other Uber leads. Scizor or Choice Scarf Dialga can replace Tyranitar, though they'll have to take two Extreme Speeds. Abomasnow can activate Mamoswine's Snow Cloak ability whilst finishing off Deoxys-A's Focus Sash thanks to hail, but it can't take Extreme Speed nearly as well as Tyranitar, and usually can't just be thrown onto a team without support. Opposing Forretress can remove Stealth Rock and Mamoswine's Focus Sash with Rapid Spin whilst setting up its own entry hazards. Forretress is only 3HKOed or 4HKOed by Earthquake depending on the damage rolls, thanks to Leftovers recovery. Any Pokemon with a Fire-type attack will fry the bagworm. Groudon with Overheat gets a special mention, because Drought removes the rain that would otherwise patch up Forretress's one weakness.</p> "

Unlike Deoxys, Froslass blocks Rapid Spin by virtue of its Ghost typing, meaning that its Spikes will not be removed so easily. Froslass can also use Destiny Bond to KO the opponent's Pokemon after setting up Spikes, making her more of a threat than Deoxys. Forretress is also often a bad choice for offensive teams due to its low Speed and vulnerability to being set up on. Froslass's spinblocking combined with her great Speed stat and ability to take down Deoxys and Rayquaza leads with ease make her an excellent choice as a Spikes lead for offensive teams that would normally struggle against those leads. Froslass's only downfalls are that she is frail and her attacks are weak, but the ice queen is meant to support rather than sweep.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Froslass does not have many other viable options in Ubers. Ice Shard allows Froslass to 2HKO Choice Scarf Shaymin-S leads, bypassing its great Speed stat and thus leaving Froslass at no risk of being flinched. Ice Shard will also always 2HKO Rayquaza leads (provided one round of Life Orb recoil damage has been taken). However, Shadow Ball + Ice Shard will never OHKO max HP Deoxys-S. Trick can be used to cripple bulky set-up leads like Dialga and Groudon, but it is usually better to KO them with Destiny Bond. In addition, Froslass will often not get to do anything else after Tricking her item away if attacked, due to her pathetic defenses. You may be tempted to use Froslass as a sweeper with Life Orb or Choice Specs; however, Gengar outclasses her completely in that role due to his much higher Special Attack, access to Explosion, and greater ease switching in. Unlike Froslass, Gengar is not weak to Stealth Rock and is immune to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Ground-type attacks.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Lead Darkrai is Froslass's biggest nightmare, since Dark Void will stop her from setting up completely. Shaymin-S is faster than Froslass as well and can potentially flinch Froslass with Air Slash, leaving her unable to set up Spikes. Tyranitar will OHKO Froslass with Crunch due to the sandstorm removing her Focus Sash. Scizor can use Bullet Punch to circumvent Froslass's great Speed and KO her. Forretress can spin away Froslass's Spikes and only fears Froslass with Hidden Power Fire. Any lead that stops Froslass from setting up more than one layer of Spikes is a nuisance, but she can always switch out to set up Spikes later in the match.</p> ",

        "name": "Spikes Lead",
        "description": "<p>Froslass is an ideal choice as a lead for offensive teams, as she is able to set up Spikes quickly and efficiently while beating some other leads that most offensive teams have a hard time fighting off, such as Rayquaza and Deoxys. Although Deoxys is faster than Froslass and can set up Stealth Rock as well as Spikes, Froslass has no fear of her Spikes being removed by Rapid Spin, courtesy of her Ghost typing.</p> <p>Icy Wind OHKOes lead Rayquaza about 50% of the time; Froslass will not lose to lead Rayquaza even if it has Focus Sash thanks to her higher Speed and immunity to Extreme Speed. It also allows Froslass to beat Deoxys leads reliably. After one use of Icy Wind, Deoxys will be slower than Froslass and will put it into KO range for Shadow Ball. (Maximum HP Deoxys has about a 50% chance to survive a Shadow Ball after an Icy Wind, however, so watch out.) Shadow Ball also 2HKOes lead Mew. If against a slower lead such as Groudon, Kyogre, or Dialga, you have different options to take. You can either set up two layers of Spikes (Focus Sash guarantees Froslass will survive at least one attack) or set up one layer of Spikes and use Destiny Bond as the opposing lead attacks for a quick KO. If the enemy lead chooses to use a support move such as Stealth Rock before attacking, Froslass will get an extra layer of Spikes set-up. Hidden Power Fire can be used over Destiny Bond to 2HKO lead Forretress. It also gives Froslass a way to threaten said Forretress if you switch her in later to block Rapid Spin. (Be wary of Payback.) Taunt is also a good option to stop leads such as Groudon and Dialga from using Stealth Rock.</p> <p>The EVs are very basic. Maximum Special Attack is required to always get the KOes on the specified leads mentioned previously. Maximum Speed with a Timid nature allows Froslass to Speed tie with other positive natured Pokemon in the base 110 Speed stat group, such as Latios, and possibly revenge-kill them with Destiny Bond if needed; however, if Froslass has Hidden Power Fire, she will fail to outpace them due to the drop in the Speed IV.</p> <p>Since Froslass is primarily going to be used on offensive teams, any sweeper will love having Spikes support to help weaken their respective counters. Rock Polish Groudon, Swords Dance Lucario, Rayquaza, Latios, and Kyogre are just a few examples. The main support Froslass will need is teammates that help take care of the leads that can shut her down. Choice Scarf Darkrai is Froslass's worst nemesis, as Dark Void will prevent Froslass from doing anything. Tyranitar can also KO Froslass with Crunch and sandstorm damage, meaning that she will only be able to set up one layer of Spikes if she stays in. Since the sandstorm will KO Froslass, Tyranitar cannot be forced out with the threat of Destiny Bond. Scizor can also bypass Froslass's good Speed with Bullet Punch, meaning that she must only set up one layer or switch out. Although Shaymin-S is OHKOed by Icy Wind, the 60% flinch chance of Air Slash (factoring in Serene Grace) means that Froslass may not even be able to do anything against it. Finally, if Froslass lacks Hidden Power Fire, Forretress can simply KO Froslass with Payback and then Rapid Spin away the Spikes she has set up. Mixed Dialga can easily come in on lead Scizor, Forretress, Tyranitar, and Shaymin-S thanks to its resistances to Steel-, Dark-, and Flying-type attacks, and destroy them all with Fire Blast (in Tyranitar's case, Brick Break). It can also set up Stealth Rock to further weaken your opponent's team. Groudon can easily switch in on Tyranitar and Scizor leads to set up for a sweep with Rock Polish or to use Stealth Rock to help support the team. A Pokemon with Sleep Talk, such as Kyogre or Heracross, can easily switch in on Darkrai's Dark Void without being completely crippled. If you're feeling daring, you can switch Wobbuffet in on Choice Scarf Darkrai's Dark Void. You can then just sit there and do nothing until Darkrai runs out of PP and is forced to KO itself via Struggle. However, if Darkrai decides instead to use Dark Pulse or is not a Choice Scarf variant, Wobbuffet and likely another chunk of your team will probably receive a death sentence.</p> <p>Most of Froslass's teammates are mentioned in the set description, but there are a few other Pokemon that work especially well with her. Having another Ghost-type Pokemon is helpful to pair with Froslass if you decide not to run Hidden Power Fire, so Forretress can't easily spin away your entry hazards. Giratina-O is a great teammate since it is bulky enough to take a Payback or two if it accidentally switches in on one, and it can use Hidden Power Fire to roast Forretress. Stealth Rock support is also recommended, since Spikes cannot hurt Flying-types or Pokemon with Levitate. Dialga and Groudon are probably the best choices to set up Stealth Rock, as they work well on the offensive teams that Froslass will most likely be used on, and they also help beat the leads the ice queen can't, such as Scizor, Forretress, and Tyranitar. Using Forretress lures such as Hidden Power Fire Latias or Flamethrower Mewtwo is also a handy way to dispose of the little shell before he can cause trouble by removing all of your entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Latias is notable since it can lure in and KO Scizor with Hidden Power Fire, which gives Froslass a little more breathing room to come in and set up Spikes. Magnezone can also trap and KO Pokemon such as Forretress and Scizor who might hinder Froslass's ability to set up. It can also take Shaymin-S's Air Slashes with little trouble.</p> "

  "Uxie": {
    "overview": "<p>When looking at Uxie, it may seem like a poor choice in the Uber metagame, due to its walling capabilities being outclassed by Lugia and Cresselia. However, Uxie has access to one move that makes it a great Pokemon in the Uber metagame; Memento. Uxie is easily the most bulky user of Memento in the game, meaning that Uxie is certainly not outclassed by the other user of Memento in Ubers, Latios. Overall, never underestimate Uxie in Ubers, as its nearly unrivaled use of Memento can easily set up a deadly sweeper, or set off a nearly unstoppable Baton Pass Mew team!</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Uxie has a wide variety of other viable options for its last move slot. Ice Punch can be used to 2HKO Rayquaza and Garchomp, and also have around a 2% chance of OHKOing Shaymin-S after Stealth Rock damage. Fire Punch can be used to 2HKO both Forretress and Scizor in the sun if needed. Uxie has the option of using Grass Knot to 3HKO Groudon in case it is a serious problem for the rest of the team. Knock Off is a useful support move that can often remove attack boosting items from foes such as Garchomp, allowing Uxie to have an easier time setting up Reflect and Light Screen. Thunder Wave is a great option on Uxie, because it will often cripple common Uxie switch-ins such as Darkrai, Mewtwo, and Mew. Heal Bell can be a useful move to remove status from your team. Although risky, Uxie can use Magic Coat to possibly put Darkrai to sleep with its own Dark Void. Finally, Uxie is a very capable user of Trick Room.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Like most users of Memento, Uxie can be difficult to stop. Generally, the best counter to Uxie in Ubers is any faster user of Taunt. Mewtwo and Mew are particularly good users of Taunt. Darkrai not only has access to Taunt to shut down Uxie, but can also put Uxie to sleep with Dark Void. If Uxie does not invest in enough Speed, Jolly Tyranitar will also be able to stop it cold with Taunt. Metagross not only has access to Brick Break to destroy Uxie's Reflect and Light Screen, but also has the ability, Clear Body, which means that Metagross is not affected by Memento.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Memento",
        "description": "<p>Uxie may seem like a silly choice for a slot on an Uber team, but Uxie has access to one key move that makes it very viable: Memento. Uxie has several key advantages over the most common user of Memento in Ubers, Latios. Uxie's defenses are far superior to Latios's defenses, meaning that Uxie will often have an easier time setting up. Unlike Latios, Uxie is also neutral to the many Dragon-type attacks of the Uber metagame, meaning that common Choice Scarfed Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Dialga, and Palkia will not be able to stop Uxie's setup like they could with Latios. Additionally, Uxie's access to Memento sets it apart from Mewtwo and Bronzong, allowing Pokemon such as Groudon and Mew to set up on the weakened Pokemon. Memento also allows Uxie to take advantage of Brick Break Scizor, as Brick Break will not shatter Uxie's screens the turn it sacrifices itself. With good defenses, Light Screen and Reflect (both lasting 8 turns due to Light Clay), and Memento, Uxie is very capable of helping a teammate set up a sweep.</p> <p>The last move slot is often best occupied by U-turn for numerous reasons. U-turn allows Uxie to escape from Taunt users, such as Mewtwo and Tyranitar, that attempt to stop its set up, in addition to scouting out the opponent's reaction to Uxie. U-turn will also allow Uxie to escape from Wobbuffet without sacrificing itself. Yawn is another good option, as its ability to scare opponents into switching or induce sleep the following turn can give Uxie a free turn to set up. Finally, Uxie is capable of setting up Stealth Rock if needed.</p> <p>Deciding Uxie's nature is crucial, as it determines what Pokemon Uxie can set up on. A Careful nature with max HP and Special Defense will ensure that several extremely powerful special attackers will be unable to switch in and stop Uxie's set up after a use of Light Screen. For example, not even a Timid Choice Specs Palkia will be able to 2HKO a Careful Uxie with a rain boosted, STAB Surf under a Light Screen. With an Impish nature and max HP and Defense, Uxie is more capable of setting up on several prominent physical attackers. For example, an Impish Uxie will never be 3HKOed by a Jolly Choice Scarf Garchomp's Dragon Claw, meaning that Uxie can easily set up on it. An Impish nature will also allow Uxie to have an easier time setting up on Groudon, who will be unable to 2HKO Uxie with even an Adamant Choice Banded Stone Edge after Uxie takes Stealth Rock damage. Finally, using Jolly with max HP and max Speed is very viable due to Uxie's 95 base Speed allowing it to outspeed and set up on prominent, base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Kyogre, Groudon, and Dialga. A Jolly Uxie has the bonus of possibly blocking Modest Choice Specs Kyogre's chances of KOing Uxie if it uses Light Screen as Kyogre switches in, as a full powered Water Spout will only have around a 7% chance of OHKOing a Light Screened Uxie after it takes Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>In order to use Uxie to its fullest potential, it's best to lure out the Pokemon it easily sets up on. Defensive Pokemon who lack phazing moves (such as Blissey, Forretress, and some Giratina) have almost no chance of stopping Uxie. Thanks to Levitate, Uxie can switch into Groudon's Earthquakes, and set up as most Groudon struggle to defeat Uxie (especially when Uxie is Impish or facing defensive Groudon). Uxie can also use Levitate to set up on any Choiced Garchomp that locks itself into Earthquake and can even set up on a Choice Scarf Garchomp's Dragon Claw if Uxie is using an Impish nature. There are several Pokemon who, while Uxie can not directly switch into, can set up on if Uxie is able to find a way to switch into these Pokemon unharmed. For example: Latias, Choice Scarf Dialga, and Choice Scarf Palkia can be set up on by Uxie if it gets in on them unharmed. Scizor makes an excellent partner with Uxie, because it will often attract Pokemon such as Forretress, Giratina, Choice Scarf Palkia (expecting a Bullet Punch) and Groudon to takes its attacks. Scizor can use U-turn as these threats switch in, allowing Uxie to easily set up on them. Jolly Uxie works particularly well with Scizor, because Scizor will also attract base 90 Speed Ubers such as Kyogre, meaning that Uxie can come in via Scizor's U-turn, and set up on them due to Uxie's superior Speed. Dialga will often lure in Groudon and Garchomp after a kill, giving Uxie the perfect opportunity to switch into an Earthquake, and start setting up (unless Garchomp has a Life Orb). Other Steel-types such as Metagross and Jirachi (who has access to U-turn) will also attract Forretress, Giratina, and Ground-type attacks for Uxie to switch in on. Deoxys-A makes a great lead for teams featuring Uxie. This is because after Deoxys-A either defeats or forces the opponents lead to switch, the opponent will sometimes attempt to deal with Deoxys-A by revenge killing it with common users of Choice Scarf such as Dialga and Palkia, thus giving Uxie the free time to set up after Deoxys-A is KOed. Although risky, you can use the strategy of double switching to put Uxie in a favorable situation. For example, if you are using Darkrai, you can predict the switch to Choice Scarf Palkia or Choice Scarf Dialga, and switch in Uxie, thus allowing Uxie to set up on either of them.</p> "

  "Azelf": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Azelf may appear to be an odd Pokemon to use in Ubers, being outclassed by both Mewtwo and Darkrai in virtually all roles. However, its access to U-turn and Explosion, coupled with high Attack and Speed stats, give it a unique niche in the Ubers metagame and allow it to serve as a nimble anti-lead. When played correctly, Azelf can give headaches to many Ubers teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Azelf can run a rather decent Choice Band set with U-turn, Explosion, and a combination of Ice Punch, Fire Punch, or Trick. Azelf has the second fastest Explosion in the game after Electrode (who is not usable in Ubers), and an Explosion off its 523 Attack will utterly maim, if not KO, anything that is not immune to it. A Nasty Plot set is also usable with Azelf's decent movepool, but it is heavily outclassed by Darkrai, and to a certain extent, Mewtwo. Finally, Azelf also has a range of other moves it can use, like Fire Blast, Thunder, Shadow Ball, and Grass Knot, but oftentimes they are too situational and not worth the moveslot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Giratina-O and Arceus-Ghost, are, without a doubt, the best counters to Azelf in the Ubers metagame. They are immune to both Trick and Explosion, and both resist U-turn. Giratina-O's great defenses also allow it to tank a potential Ice Punch. Scizor also counters Azelf very well, as it can Pursuit Azelf as it U-turns, potentially KOing it, although it needs to watch out for a potential Fire Punch. Choice Scarf Darkrai outspeeds Azelf and can OHKO it with Dark Pulse. Giratina leads can also defeat Azelf without much trouble, although it won't enjoy Trick.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf Lead",
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf equipped, Azelf reaches 541 Speed, enough to outspeed most of the Ubers metagame, allowing it to serve as a decent anti-lead. With its fast U-turn, Azelf can corner faster and frailer leads such as Deoxys-S and Darkrai, while Trick can mess up bulkier leads such as Groudon and Dialga. Though it may appear that Mew is a better choice for such a role, Azelf's additional power makes all the difference. Azelf's U-turn, when coupled with standard Ubers Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch, guarantees a 2HKO on max HP Deoxys-S, limiting it to one layer of entry hazards at best. Standard lead Mew does not guarantee the 2HKO, meaning Deoxys-S may be able to put up an extra layer, which can make a huge difference in the long run. Against a lead who can run different sets, like Kyogre, it is usually better for Azelf to U-turn away and use the damage done by U-turn to try and scout its set. After Azelf has taken out the opposing lead, it can set up Stealth Rock of its own, or do huge damage to the current victim with Explosion. It should be noted that having a fast Explosion is very useful mid-game, as Azelf can outspeed many sweepers and blow up on them as an emergency countermeasure; due to this utility, it is usually a good idea to preserve Azelf if possible.</p> <p>Ice Punch can be used over Stealth Rock, or even Trick, to allow Azelf to take down Rayquaza leads and do reasonable damage to Giratina-O. Similarly, Azelf can use Fire Punch to take out Forretress and Scizor leads.</p> <p>Since U-turn is only used to break opposing Focus Sashes, a priority abuser is necessary to dispose of Deoxys-S and Deoxys-A to stop them from setting up more than one layer of entry hazards. Scizor is the ideal partner for Azelf, as it can finish off max HP Deoxys-S with Bullet Punch after Azelf has hurt it with U-turn. Scizor can also play mind games with a powerful U-turn of its own. Rayquaza is another good priority abuser who can immediately pressure the opponent with Extreme Speed or a by possibly setting up.</p> <p>Giratina-O is virtually impervious to Azelf's attempts to dismantle it, as it resists U-turn, is immune to both Trick and Explosion, and is able to severely damage Azelf with Shadow Sneak before Azelf is able to achieve anything. Scizor leads also cause a lot of trouble since it can use Pursuit to put the hurt on Azelf as it U-turns. Choice Scarf Darkrai outspeeds and can either OHKO Azelf with Dark Pulse or put it to sleep with Dark Void. Dialga, Kyogre, and Ho-Oh are good switch-ins to Scizor, although it is usually better to set up Stealth Rock with Azelf and sacrifice it in the process, seeing as Scizor will KO Azelf with Pursuit anyway. Tyranitar, Dialga, and Lugia are good switches into Giratina-O, while a good sleep absorber like Kyogre or RestTalk Dialga is a good switch-in for Darkrai. Choice Scarf Darkrai can still threaten these switch-ins with Trick, so tread carefully when switching into it.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Dialga's unique typing and well-distributed stats make it both an excellent offensive and defensive Pokemon. Offensively, Dialga has a stunning base 120 Attack and base 150 Special Attack that's backed by the ever-dominant Dragon-type STAB. Dialga's vast offensive movepool allows it to pick off a variety of Pokemon. Defensively, Dialga's typing offers it a whopping total of nine resistances and an immunity, as well as neutrality to Ice- and Dragon-type attacks, something other Dragon-type Pokemon would kill for. With its stellar base defenses combined with the aforementioned resistances, Dialga is a difficult Pokemon to take down unless you target its weaknesses. Dialga is also revered as an excellent utility Pokemon thanks to its equally-vast support movepool. With its plethora of options, Dialga is, in a word, unpredictable.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dialga has loads of other options that can work as potential support moves. Psych Up can be useful on Dialga, allowing it to copy the stat boosts that Calm Mind Kyogre may have netted. Dialga is a great user of Trick Room in Ubers too, having brilliant all-around stats bar Speed. Flash Cannon is an auxiliary STAB attack, but Steel is a poor offensive type. Ice Beam with Choice Specs allows Dialga to OHKO Groudon without resorting to Draco Meteor or Overheat, but is otherwise generally a poor choice. Iron Tail should be avoided, because as already noted, Steel is a poor offensive type, and its 75% accuracy leaves much to be desired.</p> <p>Magnet Rise can be a good option on some Dialga sets, as it can foil Dialga's arch enemy, Groudon. If you opt for Bulk Up with Magnet Rise, then use the EV spread of 116 HP / 252 Atk / 140 Spe. This allows Dialga to Bulk Up as Groudon switches in, use Magnet Rise before most Groudon can move, and then either hit the next switch-in hard with Outrage or Earthquake, or use Bulk Up again.</p> <p>Roar of Time sounds and looks cool, but is in fact a terrible move to use, as is the rest of the Hyper Beam suite; Draco Meteor and even Dragon Pulse out-damages it over the course of two turns, and the unavoidable second turn recharge is a perfect opportunity for something threatening to set up. As for items, Choice Scarf can be used with physical moves if so desired, but without the extra power of Choice Band, the attacks will be too weak to be useful.</p> <p>252 HP / 116 SpD with a neutral nature allow Dialga to never be 2HKOed by Kyogre's Choice Scarf Water Spout, provided Dialga holds Leftovers. 252 HP / 44 Def, again with a neutral nature, will allow Dialga to never be 2HKOed by Mewtwo's Life Orb Brick Break, or OHKOed by its Focus Punch.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Simply put, Dialga is hard to counter. How it can be countered depends a lot on the weather conditions and the moveset it is using. In general, Ho-Oh and Heatran can counter Dialga while under sunny conditions. The biggest thing to note is that Thunder's accuracy is cut to 50% under the sun, which means a 15% chance that Ho-Oh and Heatran will be hit by Thunder followed by paralysis. Meanwhile, Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire has a 50% chance to inflict a burn on Dialga, which hampers the Mixed and Choice Band sets. With Ho-Oh's access to recovery, Pressure, and a high Special Defense stat, Dialga is in trouble when it only has Stone Edge to kill Ho-Oh. Heatran can shut down the Bulk Up set with a simple use of Taunt, while fearing only Earthquake or Aura Sphere at worst from Dialga. If rain is present, then a more cautious approach to countering Dialga is necessary, as a 30% chance of paralysis from Thunder is nothing to scoff at. Scizor comes relatively close as a counter since Fire Blast is weakened in the rain, while Scizor can fire off Superpower at Dialga for super effective damage. Metagross can step into the scene and fire off Earthquake at Dialga, or use Trick on sets such as Bulk Up or Support to cripple Dialga. It also does well at countering the Choice Band set, though beware of stepping into either Earthquake or Overheat in the sun.</p> <p>Groudon is a good counter since it threatens Dialga with STAB Earthquake, and has access to Roar to nullify the Bulk Up set. Offensive Groudon has an easier time KOing Dialga since many opponents opt to use a -Def nature on Dialga's mixed set. Blissey can take on both the Specs set and the Scarf set, though beware that the Scarf set can carry Outrage to try to 2HKO Blissey. Skarmory does well at countering the physical Dialga sets, especially the Bulk Up set which has no answer against Skarmory, except if Skarmory and Dialga are the last Pokemon standing. Lugia has to avoid switching into Stone Edge and Thunder at all costs, but it is otherwise a great counter to Dialga while the sun is out. It can set up Reflect to deter the Choice Band set, while Whirlwind deals with the Bulk Up set. Tyranitar, especially those that invest in Special Defense, can be a great Dialga check when Tyranitar is at full health. Wobbuffet can be an annoying Pokemon for Dialga to deal with, since Dialga lacks Taunt or a powerful enough move to OHKO Wobbuffet on the spot. It has to beware of the Mixed set when Draco Meteor is at full power though.</p> <p>Since Dialga is a slow Pokemon, you can use faster Pokemon to revenge kill it. This strategy fails when Dialga carries a Choice Scarf, but it is still the safest way of dealing with most Dialga sets. Latios using Dragon Pulse does 48.5% - 57.4% on Support Dialga, which means Latios 2HKOes non-Bulk Up Dialga without relying on Draco Meteor 93% of the time. Latias can switch in safely after Dialga has expended a Draco Meteor and start setting up Calm Minds. Life Orb Mewtwo's Aura Sphere can OHKO min HP / min SpD Dialga 43% of the time while Specs Aura Sphere will always OHKO. Deoxys-A has access to Superpower to obliterate Dialga on the spot, as it does around the same damage as Mewtwo's Choice Specs Aura Sphere. Garchomp has access to STAB Earthquake to make sure Dialga doesn't stay in comfortably. Darkrai can use Dark Void to nullify every set barring the Bulk Up set, while OHKOing Dialga with a Nasty Plot-boosted Focus Blast.</p> ",

        "name": "Mixed",
        "description": "<p>STAB Draco Meteor bolstered by 438 Special Attack, or 399 if Dialga opts to use a Hasty nature, is frightening for any opponent. Only Steel-type Pokemon and Blissey can take Draco Meteor without the risk of being 2HKOed in the process, though some frailer Steel-types such as Lucario take major damage anyway (66.2% - 77.9% if Dialga is Mild). Brick Break, with the given Attack EVs, will 2HKO most Uber Blissey with Stealth Rock in play. Fire Blast is the best attack for taking down the vast majority of Steel-types in the Uber metagame, but it comes with the downside of being weakened by the near-omnipresent rain. This can be resolved by partnering Dialga with Groudon or Tyranitar. The final slot should generally be Thunder due to its perfect accuracy in the rain; with its 30% chance of paralysis, most opponents will think twice before they switch in, since many Dialga checks or counters rely on their Speed. Outrage is an excellent attack to use with or without Bulk Up. Without Bulk Up, Dialga can use Outrage with a Life Orb to 2HKO most Kyogre and Blissey. Bulk Up is a great lure move since it draws in Groudon, which is in turn shut down by STAB Draco Meteor. With Bulk Up, Dialga should be able to even surge through Wish Blissey.</p> <p>To maximize Dialga's potential, there are many options in regards to natures and EVs. The suggested EV spread and nature allows Dialga's Draco Meteor to hit with maximum power and outspeed Adamant Scizor. 144 Atk EVs grant Dialga the ability to 2HKO most Blissey, barring max HP / max Def variants. If you opt for Mild, you should use Expert Belt, since it provides enough power to obtain the same KOs as Life Orb while conserving Dialga's HP. Hasty, with 64 Atk / 252 SpA / 192 Spe EVs, allows Dialga to outspeed Adamant Rayquaza and Adamant Lucario. Hasty with 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe also works. Outspeeding Adamant Rayquaza means that Dialga's team is less susceptible to a Swords Dance Rayquaza sweep, though keep in mind that most Dragon Dance and Mixed Rayquaza sets use a positive Speed nature. With a Hasty nature, Dialga will need a Life Orb in order to stay competitive offensively. Because Dialga can survive Choice Scarf Garchomp's Earthquake and even Life Orb Aura Sphere from Mewtwo, Dialga can effectively utilize a spread of 120 HP / 136 Atk / 252 SpA with a Quiet nature in order to survive one of those assaults. Expert Belt is preferable for Quiet Dialga since the main goal is to make sure that Dialga is as healthy as possible in case it needs to take these extreme hits. Life Orb can be used, however, since Dialga can even OHKO Support Groudon with Draco Meteor 100% of the time with a Quiet nature, which is slightly reduced to 87% with Hasty; Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes assures the KO. Life Orb Outrage also 2HKOes max HP / min Def Kyogre, which means Dialga can be effective at taking out Mono-Attacker Kyogre. Brick Break, with Stealth Rock in play, can also be used to easily 2HKO Heatran, since max HP / min Def variants takes 43-50.8%.</p> <p>A couple of move options were left out of the set because they only offer niche results, but are nevertheless effective choices if Dialga needs them. Earth Power means Dialga will never fall to a Heatran switch-in. Stealth Rock is also an option since Dialga forces many switches. Finally, Stone Edge can be used if Dialga's team has issues with Ho-Oh. While Draco Meteor and Outrage do sufficient damage by themselves, Draco Meteor has the nasty drawback of -2 SpA while Pressure takes away 2 PP in the process. Outrage is risky since Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire has a 50% chance of a burn behind it, and usually has boosted power thanks to most Ho-Oh being used in conjunction with sunlight. These moves can replace either Thunder or Fire Blast. For items, Leftovers and Adamant Orb are viable. Leftovers offer Dialga recovery and works well with the Quiet spread, while Adamant Orb helps bluff Choice Specs.</p> <p>While Dialga is an intimidating Pokemon, it does require support from its teammates. As shown with just a few damage calculations, Dialga appreciates entry hazards to help it net its KOs. Leads such as Deoxys-S or Deoxys-A are great choices for teammates since they have a high chance of getting Stealth Rock and at least one layer of Spikes up. Forretress is also a great partner as it has the added benefit of removing entry hazards on your side of the field thanks to Rapid Spin. Giratina-O can also be a staple provided that you're using entry hazards. It has the added benefit of being able to handle Groudon well thanks to its Earthquake immunity and moderate base defensive stats. Since Thunder is reliant on rain, Kyogre is an excellent partner, as not only does its ability boost Thunder's accuracy to 100%, but it also nullifies Heatran as a threat while making Ho-Oh less effective, thanks to Dialga resisting Brave Bird. Sadly, Groudon doesn't bring as many benefits to the table as Kyogre does, though Support Groudon is an excellent teammate as it can slow Dialga's counters down with Thunder Wave while being able to set up Stealth Rock. Since Dialga is great at breaking through defensive teams in general, offensive Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Swords Dance Garchomp appreciate having Dialga as their partner.</p> <p>Dialga's other issues involve its lack of Speed, which leaves it susceptible to being revenge killed by Pokemon such as Mewtwo and Latios. Scarf Garchomp is a great partner since it outspeeds Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Scarf Palkia. Another great Scarf user is Shaymin-S, which can target both Kyogre and Groudon with STAB Seed Flare while outspeeding Rock Polish Groudon. Scarf Tyranitar is rather slow; however, its natural bulk and SpD boost from the sandstorm allows it to be effective at revenge killing non-Dragon Dance Rayquaza, Latias, Latios, Swords Dance Lucario, Heatran, and Ho-Oh. While Wobbuffet is slower than Choice Scarfers, it has the advantage of being able to cushion at least one hit from a Scarf Pokemon before biting the dust. Finally, Heatran does very well at stopping a Mixed Dialga sweep cold, so teammates are needed to handle this situation. Calm Mind Latias is great at switching into Heatran's attacks due to its great special bulk and resistance to Fire. It only fears Taunt and Explosion, the latter being rare on bulkier Heatran to begin with. Rayquaza's Air Lock nullifies the sunlight's boost, and it can switch into Earth Power freely, though it has to be careful with Dragon Pulse variants.</p> "

        "name": "Defensive Bulk Up",
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Dialga's numerous resistances, well-distributed defensive stats, access to a STAB attack that only has one resistance, and Bulk Up. Bulk Up boosts Dialga's Attack and Defense stats, which helps power up its Dragon-type attack of choice, as well as increase its chances of survival against physical attacking Pokemon. For example, after a Bulk Up, Dialga can survive Choice Band Garchomp's Earthquake. Once Dialga finds an ideal time to do so, simply Rest off the damage, all the while using Sleep Talk to keep Dialga threatening to the opponent. This set is excellent for absorbing Dark Void from Darkrai since Dialga isn't deterred by falling asleep. Outrage versus Dragon Claw is a matter of preference between power and reliability. Since Dialga will be boosting its Defense via Bulk Up, max Special Defense is necessary to help Dialga cushion special attacks.</p> <p>Skarmory, Lugia, Groudon, Heatran, and Lucario to some extent will cause issues for this set. The best way to address these threats is to have offensively oriented teammates for Dialga. While it will need Aura Sphere to deal with Heatran, Giratina-O stops most Groudon sets cold thanks to STAB Draco Meteor and its immunity to Earthquake. Mixed Rayquaza is also an excellent teammate, since it lures in and takes out many of Dialga's checks, and doesn't require any setup time to do so. Rayquaza needs to be aware of its surroundings, however, since switching into any of Dialga's counters will leave your Rayquaza crippled or likely fainted. While Mixed Dialga could check many of its slower enemies with the help of some Speed EV investment or even a Hasty nature, this set has many problems with Pokemon that are faster than it. Some of the recommended Scarf Pokemon mentioned in the Mixed set (Shaymin-S and Garchomp for example) are great assets since Groudon likely outspeeds Dialga.</p> <p>Sadly, some of the problematic Pokemon that Dialga faces cannot be exactly \"countered\" per se, but they should definitely be brought to attention while you plan out Dialga's setup. Wobbuffet can cause some issues with this set in particular. It can easily Encore a move and not take damage three-fourths of the time, or two-thirds of the time if Dialga is asleep and locked onto Sleep Talk. Assuming Stealth Rock, Dialga would need three Bulk Ups to nearly KO Wobbuffet with Outrage (80.7% - 95.1%). With Dragon Claw, Dialga needs three Bulk Ups in order to 2HKO Wobbuffet. Since there is no real way of countering Wobbuffet, the best that can be said is \"Watch out\". Haban Berry Garchomp cannot always win against this set, but it can either severely damage Dialga or scare it off. Even after a Bulk Up, a Swords Dance-boosted Earthquake from Garchomp will OHKO Dialga 87% of the time. Taunt is uncommon, but it is a relevant threat since it allows Pokemon such as Mewtwo to set up freely when Dialga is asleep. Finally, watch out for Trick; since many Pokemon in the Uber metagame are part Psychic-type, it is a common move to have on Choice sets.</p> "

        "name": "Support",
        "description": "<p>Dialga is unique amongst its Dragon-type cousins because it can play a supporting role effectively. Stealth Rock requires no real explanation, though keep in mind that Dialga should lay down Stealth Rock as soon as possible to prevent Ho-Oh from switching into Dialga freely. The next move is dependent on the type of team that Dialga is supporting. An offensive team appreciates Thunder Wave more than Toxic since the paralysis of threats such as Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Choice Scarf Pokemon is a significant advantage. On the other hand, defensive teams require Toxic to make sure that the opponent's team won't out-stall Dialga's team, since Lugia, Giratina-O, Latias, and the rare Cresselia are all unaffected by Toxic Spikes. Draco Meteor can be used to limit the number of times Groudon can switch freely into this set, while Dragon Pulse offers consistency that keeps Dialga on the field without being a detriment offensively. Flamethrower helps keep Forretress and other Steel-types, barring Dialga and Heatran, from switching into Toxic freely. Thunder works best alongside Kyogre as its Drizzle ability remedies Thunder's poor accuracy. Thanks to the 30% chance of paralysis, Dialga can operate as a pseudo-double status spreader, since it is free to use Toxic instead of Thunder Wave. Though not mentioned on the set, Roar can be used over the second or fourth moveslot. The reason that Roar can replace a status move is that, assuming Dialga is on a stall team, Toxic Spikes will be already taken care of by one of Dialga's teammates. Since Lugia and Cresselia are the only general threats against Dialga that are immune from Toxic Spikes, Roar can be used to prevent these Pokemon from taking advantage of Dialga. Furthermore, there are likely better teammates that can handle Lugia and Cresselia such as Tyranitar.</p> <p>The given EVs ensure that an unboosted Timid Kyogre's Water Spout will not 2HKO Dialga. This allows Dialga to Thunder Wave, Stealth Rock, and then switch to the appropriate counter. The Special Attack EVs and Modest nature allow Dialga to always OHKO Darkrai with Draco Meteor, and to always OHKO Palkia with Dragon Pulse after it switches into Stealth Rock once.</p> <p>This set can also be used as a lead. The only change needed is Lum Berry as the item and Thunder Wave as the status move. Lum Berry is used to prevent Dialga from being put to sleep by Darkrai leads, allowing Dialga to severely cripple them with Thunder Wave. Dialga is, however, unable to prevent Deoxys-S and Deoxys-A from setting up Stealth Rock and possibly a layer of Spikes.</p> <p>Dialga, on a stall team, appreciates the residual damage from Spikes and/or Toxic Spikes. Forretress is the best Pokemon for laying down Toxic Spikes in the Uber metagame. This lessens the need for Toxic since the only Pokemon that Toxic Spikes will miss are Levitating and Flying-type Pokemon, and some of them can be removed by Dialga's Draco Meteor or Dragon Pulse. Forretress can also lay down Spikes, but relying on it to lay down all three layers of Spikes and two layers of Toxic Spikes puts Forretress under a lot of stress. As a lead, Deoxys-S can set up Spikes, since it can forgo Stealth Rock if Dialga opts to use it. Skarmory is an excellent Pokemon in this situation, since it completely walls Groudon barring the rare Overheat, can set up Spikes, has access to a recovery move, and can use Whirlwind to force switches. With entry hazards taken into account, Dialga needs a teammate that can block Rapid Spin. Giratina-O is the best Pokemon for the job.</p> <p>Offensive teams appreciate Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave or Toxic support. Rayquaza, for example, has an easier time crushing teams if most of the opponent's Pokemon is slower than it. With Toxic crippling defensive Pokemon, Swords Dance Lucario has an easier time sweeping the opponent. Offensive Groudon loves Support Dialga since many of its checks can be battered by Dialga. Swords Dance Groudon climbs in effectiveness with Thunder Wave support, while Rock Polish Groudon is solid with Toxic support.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Dialga's lackluster Speed can be fixed with the item Choice Scarf at the cost of locking Dialga onto one attack. Dialga reaches 459 Speed with Choice Scarf, which is enough to outspeed Deoxys-A. Draco Meteor is the primary attack; with Stealth Rock in play Draco Meteor easily OHKOes Darkrai, and has a 33% chance of OHKOing Mewtwo. Thunder is used to 2HKO Lugia after Stealth Rock, and for inflicting severe damage onto Kyogre. Fire Blast can be used to prevent Steel-types from switching in freely, but it relies more on the team having dual weather to support both it and Thunder. Aura Sphere can help reduce the chances of a Lucario and Dialga sweep, while nailing Heatran and Tyranitar for super effective damage. For the fourth moveslot, Dragon Pulse gives Dialga a move that is consistent damage-wise. On the other hand, Outrage, with a Hasty nature, can be used to take down Calm Mind Kyogre; it may also get the 2HKO on Blissey.</p> <p>Dialga can use a Modest or Mild nature if you want more power behind Dialga's attacks. The advantage of outspeeding Dragon Dance Rayquaza may be lost with this change, since many of them opt to run a Jolly nature. With Modest, Dialga OHKOes Mewtwo after Stealth Rock 87% of the time.</p> <p>Scarf Dialga can handle some walls with careful prediction, but above all else Dialga wants some weather to help it take advantage of Thunder and possibly Fire Blast. Offensive Kyogre and Groudon both appreciate faster Pokemon being picked off by Dialga. Scarf Dialga may be quick, but it does lose to Scarf Palkia, Scarf Garchomp, and Scarf Darkrai in Speed. Groudon can handle Scarf Garchomp and Scarf Palkia most of the time, though beware that continuously taking damage will eventually wear out Groudon due to its lack of recovery. Scarf Darkrai's only threatening attacks are Dark Void and Focus Blast, the latter having only 70% accuracy. Scizor can switch into Scarf Darkrai safely and OHKO it with U-turn. It can at least take out a weakened Darkrai with Bullet Punch if necessary (54.4% - 64.4%). Finally, be very cautious of Wobbuffet as it can revenge kill Dialga easily thanks to the Choice lock.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>If you thought Dialga's meteor showers were already painful enough, then just wait until you see what happens when they are boosted by Choice Specs! Not only does Draco Meteor OHKO Groudon, barring those that heavily invest in Special Defense, but it has enough power to OHKO Lucario. Even max HP Metagross has an 87% chance of being 2HKOed by Draco Meteor. Thunder helps Dialga a lot since the paralysis caters to Dialga's low Speed. After Stealth Rock, Thunder also OHKOes max HP Kyogre. Fire Blast is used to prevent wasting Draco Meteor's PP on Steel-type Pokemon, while decreasing the chances of Groudon safely switching into Dialga. Since Heatran can cause trouble with its resistance to Dialga's Dragon-type attacks, Aura Sphere can be used instead. Aura Sphere is also an option over Thunder since Draco Meteor hits hard enough to OHKO min HP Kyogre anyway.</p> <p>The given EVs allow Dialga to outspeed max Speed Adamant Tyranitar. They also keep Dialga very bulky so it can keep threatening the opponent. If you want Dialga to be faster, you can use 112 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Scizor, or max Speed to outspeed the vast majority of bulky 90 base Speed Pokemon, while tying with those that attempt to be agile. Timid is also a good nature since it allows Dialga to outspeed Adamant Rayquaza, while tying with max Speed Jolly Lucario. Dialga can use 192 Speed EVs with a Timid nature to outspeed said Adamant Rayquaza and place the rest of the EVs toward HP.</p> <p>Dialga's biggest issues with this set can all be in fact resolved, but with varying degrees of difficulty. Blissey becomes the biggest counter to this set, since Dialga lacks any way of KOing Blissey reliably unless Blissey is under a third of its health. Because Dialga is great for knocking down the physical walls of Ubers, it appreciates physical attackers as its teammates. Swords Dance Garchomp enjoys Groudon and Lugia being cleared out of the way, and doesn't falter to Thunder Wave from Blissey. Granted, Garchomp still has to fear Ice Beam, but Blissey oftentimes opts to use Seismic Toss to better handle Dialga, Kyogre, and Palkia. Swords Dance Garchomp with a Haban Berry is sufficient for the job, though Choice Band climbs in effectiveness thanks to many of the Levitating Pokemon being shut down by Draco Meteor or Thunder. Once again, weather is fairly important for this set to work effectively. Much like the Choice Scarf set, beware of Wobbuffet; it poses less of a threat since it is 2HKOed by Dragon Pulse, but it still only takes 40% max from -2 SpA Draco Meteor, which is unimpressive.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Trick Room",
        "description": "<p>Although it may seem strange to use Trick Room on a Pokemon with Base 90 Speed, Dialga is relatively slow by Ubers standards, which can actually let Dialga sweep if it sets up. With a Quiet nature and the listed IVs, Dialga reaches 166 Speed, which allows it to outpace virtually every common threat in Ubers when Trick Room is active. Since Dialga has no use for Speed EVs, it can maximize both its Attack and Special Attack, allowing it to abuse two powerful STAB attacks: Draco Meteor and Outrage. With a Life Orb boost, Dialga functions as a powerful wallbreaker, as it can simultaneously nail both physical walls and special sponges such as Groudon and Blissey, respectively. The final slot is dedicated to hitting Steel-types that resist Dialga's powerful Dragon-type attacks. Fire Blast will roast most Steels in the sun, but Earthquake is a suitable alternative if you want to be able to effectively damage Steel-types in the rain, while also allowing Dialga to easily KO Heatran. Earthquake also isn't weakened if Draco Meteor has been previously used.</p> <p>When using Fire Blast, it is recommended to set Dialga to level 99. This is because the standard Ubers Scizor hits 166 Speed, which means it ties with minimum Speed Dialga when it's at level 100. At level 99, Dialga will outpace Scizor after it sets up Trick Room and can OHKO the steel bug with Fire Blast. However, if you choose to use Earthquake, Dialga should remain at level 100 since it won't be able to beat Scizor regardless. Another option to consider is Shuca Berry instead of Life Orb. While Life Orb is generally superior to boost Dialga's already powerful attacks, Shuca Berry will allow Dialga to survive a Life Orb-boosted Earthquake from Groudon and set up Trick Room.</p> <p>Not many Pokemon have the bulk to survive Dialga's onslaught, since it can hit on both the special and physical side extremely hard. Lugia is a counter that comes to mind because it can outstall Dialga with Roost as Life Orb recoil accumulates. Wobbuffet can't be OHKOed by any of Dialga's attacks, and can take out Dialga in one shot with either Mirror Coat or Counter. If Dialga isn't set to level 99 or doesn't pack a Fire-type move, Scizor will gladly switch in and OHKO Dialga with Superpower. By the same token, any Dialga without Fire Blast will be hard-pressed to hurt Skarmory and Forretress. Without Earthquake, Heatran will completely wall Dialga, while Jirachi and Metagross can do the same in the rain. When Trick Room is not up, Dialga must be careful against Groudon if it doesn't have a Shuca Berry, as it will OHKO Dialga with a powerful Earthquake.</p> <p>Dialga makes a great \"selfish\" user of Trick Room thanks to its blistering offenses, but there are still several Pokemon you should consider pairing it with. Swords Dance Groudon is a wonderful partner for Dialga, since it can take advantage of Trick Room to outpace and OHKO Lugia after Stealth Rock. With Swords Dance, Groudon also fares well against most Steel-types that wall Dialga, as even Skarmory can't keep up with boosted Stone Edges or Fire Punches. Wobbuffet has great synergy with Dialga because it can use Encore to give Dialga a chance to set up Trick Room, and in turn can use Dialga's Trick Room to outpace virtually everything in the metagame. Other Pokemon that can set up Trick Room are worthwhile partners for Dialga. For example, Bronzong can wall Groudon and further help Dialga by setting up Trick Room, while Palkia can take a more offensive approach and still maintain the ability to set up Trick Room. If you aren't using Dialga in a full Trick Room team, you might want to invest in fast sweepers like Mewtwo and Darkrai that can help clear a path for Dialga to sweep late-game.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Finally, a set other than Bulk Up that doesn't call for the spamming of Draco Meteor! With this set, Dialga forgoes special attacks in order to catch many of its switch-ins off-guard. Don't assume that Groudon has the upper hand against this set; unless Groudon invests heavily in its Defense stat, it is 2HKOed by Outrage. Earthquake complements Outrage by giving Dialga a wide amount of coverage against the Uber metagame; it prevents most Steel-types, especially Heatran, from switching in safely. Dragon Claw should be your third move as Outrage lock puts Dialga in grave danger if you're not aware of the rest of the opponent's Pokemon. The fourth move depends on whether you prefer shutting down the majority of Steel-types, notably Skarmory, or annihilating Ho-Oh and keeping Lugia away from Dialga.</p> <p>The EV structure is very similar to the Choice Specs set, with the only difference being not recommending a positive Speed nature. Outspeeding Adamant Tyranitar is the minimum amount of Speed Dialga should use. You can opt to use 116 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Scizor, or max Speed to tie with Adamant Lucario or Modest Kyogre at worst. Jolly nature with max Speed and max Attack allows Dialga to get the upper hand on Adamant Rayquaza at the cost of sheer attacking power.</p> <p>Choice Band Dialga has the exact opposite problems that Choice Specs has. Outrage is a powerful attack, but it prevents Dialga from switching out from a troublesome position. Dialga trades being able to handle Heatran and Ho-Oh (unless it has Stone Edge) for having issues with Lugia, Impish Groudon, and Skarmory (unless it has Overheat). While Lucario can't take much of a beating, it can switch into Stone Edge and freely set up Swords Dance followed by quickly KOing Dialga with Close Combat. Powerful special attackers and mixed attackers are recommended for this reason. Mixed Rayquaza can outspeed and annihilate most of these Pokemon when they switch in. Mewtwo is pretty effective here since Taunt completely shuts down Lugia and Skarmory, allowing Mewtwo to set up Calm Mind freely. Its only fear is Blissey that carry Seismic Toss, which Dialga can at least handle to an extent. As a partner, Wobbuffet can set up Encore + Tickle, then follow up with a Pokemon that knows Pursuit to kill off the opposing physical wall. Beware that Impish Groudon sometimes carry Toxic, which will harm Wobbuffet's effectiveness.</p> "

  "Palkia": {
    "overview": "<p>Palkia is an absolute menace in the Uber environment. Its dual STABs have great coverage with its excellent Special Attack, Attack, and Speed stats backing them up. To further elaborate, Palkia's Speed stat is unique in Ubers as max Speed Palkia outpaces many threats in the metagame, such as Groudon, Kyogre, Ho-Oh, Dialga, Giratina-O, Rayquaza, and the standard Lugia. Palkia is a type of Pokemon who works in both rain and sunshine, and that alone makes handling Palkia difficult. Defensively, Palkia is one of the very few Pokemon who can take a Choice Specs Water Spout from Kyogre, which is proclaimed as the most powerful special attack in Ubers. The typing gives Palkia resistances to Water-, Fire-, and Steel-type moves, while leaving Dragon-type moves as its lone weakness. Overall, Palkia is a powerful Pokemon in the Uber environment, and it's difficult to say that it even has counters, as it easily 2HKOes most Pokemon who attempt to switch into it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>For Palkia, it is best to just use the EVs listed in the sets. The Mixed Sweeper should have 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Hasty nature to produce 277 Attack / 399 SpA / 328 Spe. The Physical Mixed set should always have Max Attack and Speed with 4 EVs thrown into Special Attack. With a Hasty nature, Palkia outpaces non-Scarf Kyogre, Groudon, and most Lugia. The same EVs and nature should be applied on the Choice sets, although you can also use a Timid or Jolly nature where appropriate. All physical sweeping sets should use 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe and a Jolly nature. Any set with Substitute and a pinch Berry should use a 30 HP IV to have an HP stat divisible by 4.</p> <p>Palkia's movepool is huge and there are a lot of other things it can do or utilize. RestTalk makes Palkia a good status absorber. Its typing, Bulk Up, and useful STABs make it a good mono-attacker. In comparison, Dialga has better defenses and isn't weak to Dragon-type attacks, which are abundant in the Uber metagame. Palkia can use Roar, however this is limited in use to dealing with Pokemon like Calm Mind Kyogre. Speaking of solutions to Calm Mind Kyogre, Psych Up is another option for Palkia, as it can copy Kyogre's boosts and use them to do its own sweeping.</p> <p>Ice Beam is Palkia's best weapon against Celebi and Groudon (barring Draco Meteor); however, the coverage overlaps with Surf and Spacial Rend most of the time. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast with its better accuracy, but the loss in power is easily noticed. Aura Sphere is an acceptable Special Attack if Palkia lacks sunlight. It is the best attack against Bulk Up Dialga. Power Gem allows Palkia to reliably revenge kill Ho-Oh, as in the sun, Palkia has no other options against the phoenix.</p> <p>Haban Berry works well with Palkia's sole weakness: Dragon-type attacks. It lowers the damage done by Dragon-type attacks, allowing Palkia to finish the unsuspecting Pokemon off. Chilan Berry can allow Palkia to revenge kill Swords Dance Rayquaza and Lucario, but otherwise has little use. Finally, Substitute and a Salac Berry can be applied on either a mixed sweeper or a pure special sweeper.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Palkia does not have a true counter, therefore, you must find out which set it is running first, and then have the right combinations of resistances to beat it.</p> <p>Latias is the closest thing to a true counter for Palkia. It survives most of Palkia's attacks, is faster, and OHKOes with Dragon Pulse. Latias needs to watch out for Choice Scarf variants, however. Choice Scarf Garchomp outspeeds all versions of Palkia and destroys it with Dragon Claw or Outrage. Blissey can take every special attack Palkia aims at her, but Outrage, rain-boosted Aqua Tail, and Focus Punch make Blissey think twice before receiving the impact. Lugia can switch into Palkia and threaten it off with Roost, Reflect, or Toxic and can survive even Thunder with Light Screen. Physical Palkia and Stealth Rock make Lugia's life miserable, however. Support Dialga and Groudon can take most special attacks, cripple Palkia with Thunder Wave, or destroy it with Dragon Pulse. Scizor and Jirachi can come in on Choiced Dragon-type attacks and threaten Palkia with U-turn and Toxic, respectively.</p> <p>Entry hazards such as Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes will seriously hamper Palkia's staying power, weakening it so that once you know its set, Palkia will become much easier to take down.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Palkia makes an excellent Choice Scarf candidate. With a devastating 150 base Special Attack, Palkia can do huge amounts of damage even without a boosting item. With a Choice Scarf, Palkia reaches an impressive 492 Speed, a Speed that Rayquaza cannot match even after a Dragon Dance. In fact, Deoxys-S is the only Pokemon who can reach this Speed without a Choice Scarf of its own.</p> <p>The choice between Draco Meteor and Spacial Rend comes down to raw power versus consistency. Draco Meteor allows Palkia to OHKO max HP / min SpD Giratina with Stealth Rock, but Spacial Rend is generally preferred in that slot because of greater reliability. Draco Meteor also gives Palkia the ability to OHKO Minimum HP / Minimum SpD Darkrai 92% of the time. Surf is generally Palkia's most reliable attack. In the rain, it is a 2HKO on Wobbuffet, who normally eats Choice Pokemon for breakfast. It also OHKOes the omnipresent Darkrai, who otherwise beats Palkia with Dark Void. Thunder may seem situational, but it is necessary to keep Kyogre at bay, and also is your best option against Lugia.</p> <p>The last slot simply depends on which Pokemon threaten you the most. With Stealth Rock, Outrage can 2HKO min HP / max Def Blissey 87% of the time, and also OHKOes Latias (Spacial Rend only 2HKOes it). Putting Draco Meteor in this slot gives Palkia a powerful attack without losing the reliability of Spacial Rend. When combined with Surf, Fire Blast gives Palkia more dependability, as it allows Palkia to sweep well in any weather.</p> <p>Roost Ho-Oh in the sun is the number one best check against Choice Scarf Palkia. Ho-Oh only fears Thunder, and with only 50% accuracy, it is far from reliable. During a sandstorm, Tyranitar also makes a decent check, but without an instant recovery move it is troubled by repeated attacks, particularly Spacial Rend and Surf. Wobbuffet will almost always beat Palkia one-on-one, as only a rain-boosted Surf is strong enough to 2HKO Wobbuffet. Similarly, Palkia needs Outrage to beat Blissey, who otherwise can wall it all day, and wear it down with Seismic Toss or Toxic. Dialga is only 2HKOed by Spacial Rend or a sun-boosted Fire Blast, and laughs at just about anything else Palkia has to offer. As with most Choice sets, there are many Pokemon who can beat Palkia, as long as your opponent guesses correctly, or first scouts your attack with Protect. Latias only fears Dragon-typed attacks, while those same attacks will not even faze Steel-types, such as Scizor and Metagross.</p> <p>A supportive Groudon is a great teammate for Palkia. STAB Earthquake scares off Blissey, Dialga, and most Steel-types. Toxic cripples Wobbuffet, Lugia, Latias, and opposing Groudon, and a Dragon Claw quickly dispatches a Choice Scarfed Garchomp. Kyogre can use Sleep Talk to beat Darkrai, bypassing the threat of Dark Void, and hopefully KOing Darkrai with Surf. Kyogre also does well against other Palkia threats, such as Groudon, Scizor, and Metagross. The powerful Brave Bird makes Ho-Oh difficult to switch into, so your best bet is to use something faster than Ho-Oh with Stone Edge, such as faster versions of Groudon or Garchomp. Scizor can take any Dragon-type attack thrown at Palkia, and can destroy many of Palkia's other checks, such as Wobbuffet and Blissey, with U-turn and Superpower, respectively.</p> "

Outrage also works here, as it isn't reliant on weather and hits many Pokemon in Ubers for either neutral or super effective damage. Thunder severely damages Kyogre and Lugia, and also has a 30% chance of paralyzing them.

Super effective damage, however, is not necessary. In the rain, even Pokemon who take neutral damage from Water-type attacks are at the very least 2HKOed by Surf or Aqua Tail.

On the other hand, Haban Berry is useable to remove Palkia's lone weakness to Dragon-type attacks. Timid is an acceptable nature if you have Aqua Tail, as it will still 2HKO Blissey 37% of the time with Stealth Rock and Leftovers factored in, assuming rain is active. However, Hasty is usually superior to get the guaranteed 2HKO on Blissey.</p> <p>While the greater power and ability to switch attacks can make this set even deadlier then the Choice Scarf set, this Palkia still has trouble with Latias, who can come into anything but Outrage, and OHKO the always-slower Palkia with Dragon Pulse. Thanks to Drought, Specially Defensive Groudon can take all of Palkia's attacks, and threaten it back with Dragon Claw. Timid Lugia can use Light Screen or Toxic and potentially outstall Palkia, however, it risks getting paralyzed by Thunder.</p> <p>Palkia is more vulnerable to being revenged killed by Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Dialga, opposing Choice Scarf Palkia, Garchomp (who doesn't need a Choice Scarf this time because Garchomp is naturally faster than Palkia), and Darkrai. Scizor is once again a good teammate, because it can take any Dragon-type attack thrown at Palkia and smack Dialga and Palkia with Superpower, Garchomp with Bullet Punch, and Latias and Darkrai with U-turn. Kyogre's name is also gets a second mention, as it annihilates Lugia and Groudon with Thunder and Surf, respectively. It is worth noting, however, that Kyogre has to switch into Groudon, not the other way around, to ensure favorable weather conditions.</p> <p>This Palkia set has a tendency to lure out and KO, Blissey, and Steel-type Pokemon who will be expecting the more common Choice Scarf set. Therefore you want to pair it with a Pokemon who will thrive once Blissey and Steel-types are out of the picture. Choice Specs Dialga is a great example of this, since it can bulldoze through teams with its powerful Draco Meteor. Calm Mind Mewtwo and Nasty Plot Darkrai also make great partners, since they can easily set-up and sweep once Pokemon such as Blissey and Scizor are in the graveyard.</p> "

        "description": "<p>At a quick glance this set may appear to be similar to the other Mixed Palkia set; however, this set instead focuses on Palkia's overlooked Attack stat. With the given EVs, Palkia will do 75.9% - 89.4% to a standard Wish Blissey with Aqua Tail if rain is active, meaning that it can OHKO with Stealth Rock up (guaranteed with Spikes); it is only a 2HKO without rain, however. Aqua Tail can also 2HKO a Tyranitar even in sandstorm, a feat that Palkia cannot accomplish with Surf. Outrage can be an answer to Kyogre, dealing 50% damage on even the bulkiest of Kyogre. Lustrous Orb means Spacial Rend is doing just as much damage as with the Choice Scarf set. Fire Blast will scare off Steel-types, but Surf is more consistent in general. Thunder is also an option for Lugia and \"sun-screened\" Ho-Oh.</p> <p>Lustrous Orb is a must on this specific set, since it raises Palkia's Dragon- and Water-type moves by 20% with no limiting effects. With it, Palkia can \"bluff\" the item it is holding, creating the illusion of a Choice Scarf (because there is no recoil and the damage output of special attacks is about the same). Hasty is the best choice of nature here, since it doesn't lower either of the attack stats, maintaining the opportunity for crucial KOs. Also, the ability to absorb special attacks, such as Water Spout, is important, so a Naive nature is not used.</p> <p>This set still has a lot of the same problems from the previous Mixed set, who are Latias, Ho-Oh, Timid Lugia with Screens, extremely defensive Groudon, and revenge killers, so any of the partners with the previous set will work just as well with this one. This Palkia also needs to be wary of physically defensive variants of Mewtwo, who can outspeed Palkia and completely shatter its Attack with Will-O-Wisp, ruining its ability to break past Blissey. Kyogre can easily decimate both Mewtwo and Ho-Oh with its powerful rain-boosted Water-type attacks, and it doesn't mind taking a burn.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs makes Palkia's already excellent Special Attack swell to enormous heights, and it is then able to 2HKO many of the Uber Pokemon with just its two STAB moves alone. Even Steel-types will take hefty damage from resisted attacks, leaving Blissey as the only reliable switch in for this monster. Choice Specs Palkia is usually pushed aside in favor of Choice Specs Dialga who has more numerous resistances to switch in on and a Toxic Spikes immunity. However, Palkia has better offensive type-coverage, and a slightly higher Speed stat, which lets it outpace base 90 and 95 Speed Pokemon, such as Dialga, Groudon, Giratina-O, Ho-Oh, Kyogre, and Rayquaza.</p> <p>Draco Meteor is going to be Palkia's main attack, absolutely smashing every Pokemon who doesn't resist it. Surf provides very good neutral coverage with Draco Meteor, hitting every Pokemon in the game for neutral damage, except Shedinja and Empoleon, neither of whom is seen in Ubers that much, if at all. In the rain, Surf is just as dangerous as Draco Meteor, severely damaging most of the Steel-types used in Ubers. Hydro Pump has less accuracy, but much more power than Surf. With Hydro Pump, you stand a much better chance of winning against Blissey. Thunder fries Kyogre, Lugia, and Manaphy. Fire Blast can be used in its place, if you want more power against pesky Steel-types. It can also be used in place of Surf, but only if you have sun support from Groudon. Fire Blast also 2HKOes most Groudon variants and OHKOes most Steel-types in the sun.</p> <p>Few Pokemon can switch into the sheer power of Choice Specs Palkia. Scizor barely manages to outstall Draco Meteor with Roost, and loses to pretty much any other attack. Jirachi works pretty much the same way with Wish and Protect, but it does a much better job of taking Palkia's other attacks, and can use Toxic to whittle down Palkia's HP. Lugia needs to be faster in order to win against Palkia, otherwise it will be outsped and KOed next turn.</p> <p>Blissey is the only 100% safe switch in for this set, as she will shrug off any hit thanks to her high Hit Point and Special Defense stats. Tickle Wobbuffet, paired with a Pursuit user, such as Scizor or Tyranitar, is an almost assured way to get rid of Blissey and Lugia, allowing Palkia to rip apart the opposing team without much trouble. Groudon can poison Lugia with Toxic, and smash Blissey, Scizor, and Jirachi with Earthquake. Rest + Sleep Talk Kyogre with Calm Mind can also set up on any of the aforementioned threats.</p> <p>Palkia must be careful of Pokemon who may come in to revenge kill it or set up on it after a KO. Groudon can come in after a Draco Meteor or Thunder and use Rock Polish to set up for a sweep. Garchomp can come in on Thunder or Fire Blast and either KO Palkia with Outrage or set up Swords Dance and start sweeping. Lucario can also swap in after a Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor and use Swords Dance, although Lucario will still take well around 50% damage from a -2 Draco Meteor. Kyogre can switch in on anything but Thunder or a full power Draco Meteor and destroy Palkia with a Choice Specs-boosted Thunder or set up on it with Calm Mind. Lastly, Wobbuffet can switch into anything but the initial Draco Meteor, or a rain-boosted Water-type attack, and can then trap Palkia and KO it with Mirror Coat. Lugia can handle Groudon, Garchomp, and Lucario as long as it has Reflect, and Latias is a nice answer to Kyogre, being able to Calm Mind up alongside it and destroy it with Grass Knot. There is not much you can do about Wobbuffet trapping you, but before you bring Palkia out, you can try to lure in and weaken Wobbuffet with a mixed attacker who may usually run a Choice item, such as Expert Belt Mixed Dialga. Wobbuffet is then unable to score revenge kill once its health is at 40% or lower.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With status-inflicting moves everywhere, Palkia has plenty of chances to use Substitute. Furthermore, the combination of Substitute and Focus Punch help Palkia beat some of its counters, including the number one threat: Blissey. With Expert Belt and the given EVs, Focus Punch always OHKOes 651 HP / 119 Def Blissey. On top of that, Focus Punch is a 2HKO on most Dialga and Kyogre. Thunder works best in slot four to prevent Kyogre from setting up on Palkia, but with weather support, Surf and Fire Blast are also viable options.</p> <p>Expert Belt is preferred for guaranteeing an OHKO on Blissey with Focus Punch. Leftovers help Palkia recover health, thus allowing more uses of Substitute. With Stealth Rock, Focus Punch followed by Spacial Rend OHKOes Blissey most of the time.</p> <p>Despite the protection from Substitute, this Palkia still has trouble with Latias and specially defensive Groudon. Without Fire Blast, Forretress in the sun can also be a pain, as Thunder's 50% accuracy gives the steel bug plenty of time to set up entry hazards that could potentially ruin the rest of your team. Encore Wobbuffet also poses a huge problem, as it can then either KO Palkia or allow another sweeper to set up. Specially defensive Scizor can also break the Substitute with U-turn, allowing a Pokemon who is faster than Palkia to come in and revenge kill it.</p> <p>Groudon is once again a good teammate, as it can smack Latias and opposing Groudon with Toxic, and Forretress and Scizor will be roasted by Fire-type attack. Wobbuffet is also not going to like Toxic either. Speaking of Wobbuffet, it too makes a good teammate for Palkia, because it can use a combination of Encore, Shadow Tag, and Safeguard to turn many walls into set up bait. It can also revenge kill Latias, Groudon, and Scizor (be wary of U-turn) quite easily.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>This set's effectiveness stems from the fact that many of Palkia's counters invest heavily in their Special Defense stats, often neglecting their Defense. This, when combined with Palkia's underestimated 120 Attack stat, makes for a very effective surprise. Aqua Tail and Outrage make Palkia difficult for the opponent to handle. An effective \"Double STAB\" in the rain allows Aqua Tail to 2HKO any unsuspecting Lugia while decimating anything else that attempts to switch in. Outrage gives Palkia the ability to hit Aqua Tail-resistant Pokemon for a 2HKO. Earthquake shuts down Metagross and Dialga, however one should be extremely careful: with so many Flying-types and Levitators, avoid using Earthquake until you are sure they don't have a Pokemon who is immune to Ground-type moves, like Rayquaza, waiting in the wings. Stone Edge enables Palkia to 2HKO Lugia should the rain be absent. It also prevents Shedinja from safely switching into Palkia and burning it with Will-O-Wisp. Dragon Claw gives Palkia a consistent STAB that doesn't lock it into Outrage early in the game.</p> <p>Choice Scarf is also an acceptable item on this set. Palkia misses the boost in power, however it is able to outspeed and revenge kill many more Pokemon, which can prove advantageous on certain teams.</p> <p>Choice Band Palkia has issues with Timid Lugia, as it can survive almost anything and Roost off the damage, and then set up Reflect and wear away at Palkia's HP with Toxic. Latias and Giratina can take anything but Outrage and will decimate Palkia with their STAB Dragon-type moves. Impish Groudon can turn off the rain with Drought, allowing it to take even Aqua Tail, and will shred Palkia with Dragon Claw. Skarmory, Forretress, and Bronzong can all survive any of Palkia's attacks barring rain boosted Aqua Tails, and can either pick away at it with Toxic or use the turn to set up entry hazards. Finally, like most of the other Palkia sets, this set is vulnerable to being revenge killed by Choice Scarfers, such as Dialga, Palkia, and Garchomp.</p> <p>Kyogre is an excellent teammate because it can easily drown Groudon, Skarmory, Bronzong, and Forretress with Surf; blast Lugia and Giratina with Ice Beam; and can lure in and cripple Latias, Choice Scarf Dialga, and opposing Choice Scarf Palkia with Thunder Wave. Magnezone can trap and destroy Steel-types with Thunder, allowing Palkia to use Outrage with impunity. Magnezone can also take Dragon-type attacks from Dialga, Palkia, and Garchomp and can respond with Thunder or Hidden Power Ice. Furthermore, Lugia is also completely walled by Magnezone, and cannot do anything while the steel magnet roasts it with Thunder. As always, Scizor is a good partner, since it can trap and KO Latias with Pursuit, and can also switch in on the Dragon-type attacks coming Palkia's way. Mixed Dialga can also lure in Groudon and Lugia and can destroy them with Draco Meteor and Thunder, respectively. It can also melt Steel-types with Fire Blast, rip Latias to shreds with Dragon Claw, and use the previously mentioned Draco Meteor to crush Giratina.</p> "

        "name": "Bulk Up",
        "description": "<p>Palkia's higher Speed stat and STAB Aqua Tail are major differences that set it apart from Bulk Up Dialga. Kyogre support is highly recommended for this set because sunlight ruins the use of Palkia's primary attack: Aqua Tail. After a Bulk Up, Palkia's Attack and Defense stats become 508 and 354 respectively. Outrage is the secondary attack for this set. With Lustrous Orb and one Bulk Up, Outrage will inflict massive damage to almost anything that switches in, regardless of weather. Even Groudon will be 2HKOed by Outrage, unless it is extremely defensive. Aqua Tail boosted by rain is devastating for the opponent to handle. With Stealth Rock and Lustrous Orb, Lugia is 2HKOed if it attempts to switch in. Before Reflect, a +1 Aqua Tail in the rain does 62% minimum to the standard Bold 252 HP / 52 Def Lugia, and 31% minimum after Reflect is set up; thus the standard Lugia will often be defeated. Earthquake is mostly filler, but it always at least 2HKOes Metagross and Dialga after a Bulk Up, allowing a little more freedom for using Outrage. Dragon Claw is a fine option over Earthquake so that you can avoid untimely Outrages and maintain the ability to switch out.</p> <p>Lustrous Orb boosts Palkia's main STAB attacks by 20%, making it the ideal item for this set. Life Orb can also be used for a stronger Earthquake, however, Lustrous Orb is usually the preferred item due to the lack of recoil.</p> <p>While Bulk Up Palkia may be able to get past Bold Lugia, Timid Lugia can use its superior Speed stat to set up Reflect before Palkia hits it with a boosted Aqua Tail. Under Reflect, Timid Lugia can then use Roost to heal its self, and then Whirlwind Palkia away. Because this Palkia set focuses on setting a sweep with Bulk Up, Latias, Latios, and Choice Scarf Dialga will be more of an issue than usual, as they will now have the potential to switch in unharmed, and then OHKO Palkia with a STAB Dragon-type attack. Although they are not commonly switched in, Choice Scarf Palkia and Garchomp can revenge kill Bulk Up Palkia with ease.</p> <p>Wobbuffet makes a great partner to this set for several reasons. Wobbuffet can use its combination of Shadow Tag and either Counter or Mirror Coat to trap and revenge kill Choice Scarfed Dragon-types, such as Dialga, Palkia, and Garchomp. Wobbuffet can also Encore a support move or an attack that does little damage to Palkia (usually Water-type or Fire-type attacks), thus giving Palkia a free turn to set up. Finally, Wobbuffet has the option of using Tickle paired with a Pursuit user, such as Tyranitar or Scizor, to defeat Lugia. Even on their own, Pursuit users are great teammates for Bulk Up Palkia, due to their ability to trap and destroy Latias and Latios. Scizor is a particularly great user of Pursuit to pair with Palkia, because it can use its resistance to Dragon-type attacks to switch into not only Latias and Latios, but also into the assaults of Choice Scarfed Dragon-type Pokemon. Finally, Mewtwo can use Taunt and Calm Mind to easily set up on Lugia, while Darkrai can use Dark Void to put Lugia to sleep, and thus threaten to set up a sweep with Nasty Plot.</p> "

        "name": "Trick Room (Specially Based)",
        "description": "<p>Palkia is one of the few viable Pokemon in Ubers that has access to Trick Room, and despite its relatively high Speed stat, Palkia can use Trick Room quite effectively to become a nasty sweeper. Palkia separates itself from other Trick Room users with its unique typing, as this gives it ample opportunities to set up Trick Room, especially in a tier with Choiced Water Spouts and Bullet Punches flying around.</p> <p>Spacial Rend and Surf are two very powerful attacks when backed up by STAB and a Lustrous Orb boost, and they allow Palkia to nail virtually the entire Ubers metagame for at least neutral damage. Palkia is especially devastating in the rain, as a boosted Surf will always OHKO Mewtwo and Darkrai, and it will also take out Scizor in one shot after Stealth Rock. The last move is a bit tricky, but generally Outrage is given the nod for its ability to 2HKO Blissey. However, Fire Blast is an option if you aren't using Drizzle support and want to hit bulky Steel-types like Jirachi, while Thunder is a good choice if you find yourself needing a way to eliminate Lugia in one shot after Stealth Rock damage. Lustrous Orb should generally be the item of choice because it further boosts Palkia's powerful STABs, but Haban Berry is a decent alternative in order for Palkia to survive any unboosted Dragon-type attack and set up Trick Room.</p> <p>Palkia is extremely dependent on Drizzle support from Kyogre, as various Pokemon will give Palkia headaches in the sun. Jirachi and Scizor can eat Surfs all day as long as sun is up, while Lugia can outstall Trick Room with Roost as long as it isn't raining. Other problematic Pokemon arise depending on what Palkia opts for a third attack. Without Outrage, Blissey will wall Palkia with impunity, and Latias will also become an issue since it can survive a Spacial Rend and nail Palkia with a Soul Dew boosted Dragon Pulse. Wobbuffet is a unique threat, but it is a legitimate problem for Palkia, because it can switch in as Palkia uses Trick Room and Encore Palkia first since it will be faster as long as Trick Room is active.</p> <p>When choosing partners for Palkia, Kyogre is undoubtably the first Pokemon you should consider, as it provides Palkia with infinite rain to sweep under. Kyogre can also be given minimum Speed to sweep when Trick Room is active. Wobbuffet is another great partner for Palkia, especially if Palkia isn't using Haban Berry, since it can trap and OHKO faster Dragon-types attempting to revenge kill it. In addition, Wobbuffet can use Encore to help Palkia set up. When paired with a Pursuit user, Wobbuffet can effectively use Tickle to eliminate Blissey and Lugia, both of which give Palkia its fair share of problems. Scizor is the best choice to do this, as it resists Dragon-type attacks aimed at Palkia, while its low Speed means it can utilize Trick Room effectively. Bronzong makes a solid partner for Palkia thanks to its great synergy, while it can also use Trick Room and Explosion to allow Palkia to come in without having to waste a turn setting up. Although this set is quite offensive in nature, Palkia still stands erect as a premier Kyogre counter, and can therefore be added to teams that find themselves susceptible to the enormous whale.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While Palkia's monstrous Base 150 Special Attack means that its Spacial Rends and Surfs are among the most powerful attacks in Ubers, it also has a very useable Base 120 Attack, allowing it to use a physical Trick Room set effectively. Not only does this set lure Palkia's common counters, most notably Blissey, but it can also surprise a wide variety of Pokemon in Ubers, as most walls focus on sponging special attacks. Even though this set works nicely as a lure, it is still a powerful stand-alone sweeper, since Palkia can muscle its way past speedy foes like Mewtwo, Shaymin-S, and Darkrai after it sets up a Trick Room.</p> <p>Palkia's famed Dragon- and Water-type STABs are once again put on display with this set. Outrage and Aqua Tail are extremely powerful when boosted by Lustrous Orb, and Aqua Tail gains an additional boost from Kyogre's eternal rain. Aqua Tail is what really makes this set deadly, as it punishes most of the prominent counters to Palkia's special Trick Room set. Blissey, who laughs at Palkia's special attacks, takes upwards of 80% from Aqua Tail, while other walls like Lugia and Wobbuffet are 2HKOed as well. Outrage complements Aqua Tail by smacking around Pokemon that resist Water, namely opposing Dragon-types. Kyogre and Dialga are both 2HKOed by Outrage, while Latias, Latios, and other Palkia stand no chance. Draco Meteor is mainly to hit Groudon, but it's also useful if you need to use a Dragon-type attack but don't want yourself to be locked into Outrage. Fire Blast is an option because it still dents Groudon, and it also gives you an attack to roast Steel-types in the sun. Finally, Haban Berry can be used as Palkia's item if you find your team weak to Dragon-type Pokemon, and it will allow Palkia to set up a Trick Room against the likes of Latias, Latios, and Giratina-O.</p> <p>As always, Palkia runs into trouble against Steel-types when it isn't raining. Scizor, Jirachi, and Skarmory are the main culprits, as they can take Aqua Tails fairly well in the sun and will outstall Trick Room with their recovery moves. Forretress may not be able to do much back to Palkia, but it'll laugh at Aqua Tail in the sun, allowing it to set up entry hazards with ease. While they're both 2HKOed by Aqua Tail in the rain, Lugia and Wobbuffet pose quite a few problems. If Lugia switches into Palkia as it uses Trick Room, it can stall Palkia with Roost until Trick Room's effect subsides, and then hit it with a debilitating Toxic. Wobbuffet can come in on Trick Room and Encore Palkia before it can attack since Wobbuffet will be slower once Trick Room is active.</p> <p>Palkia absolutely needs Kyogre's Drizzle support to work effectively, as it lets Palkia use Aqua Tail to defeat Steel-types that would otherwise wall it. Palkia can actually support Kyogre as well, since it will often lure and KO Blissey, allowing Kyogre to sweep with much greater ease. Wobbuffet and Scizor can be used in tandem to eliminate Lugia, as Wobbuffet's Tickle and Scizor's Pursuit will put the giant bird out of commission very quickly. Wobbuffet is also a great individual teammate to Palkia because it can trap and KO troublesome Dragon-types, and can utilize Encore to give Palkia a free turn to set up Trick Room. Other Trick Room sweepers make good partners to Palkia. Dialga gets particular mention since it can use a mixed set to easily rid the field of pesky Steel-types.</p> "

  "Giratina": {
    "overview": "<p>The fact that it is a Ghost-type Uber with an insane physical walling ability makes Giratina a staple on Uber stall teams. Due to Giratina's Ghost typing, it blocks Rapid Spin; meaning Toxic Spikes, Spikes and Stealth Rock will not be removed easily. Giratina's immunity to Explosion means that it cannot be swiftly brought down. While its weaknesses are commonly used attacking types in the Uber metagame, one should not overlook its two immunities and six resistances. Giratina's massive defenses on both sides make it difficult to KO (even a Modest Kyogre's Ice Beam fails to 2HKO a Giratina with no SpD EVs). On the physical side, there are no unboosted physical attacks that will OHKO Giratina. In fact, Giratina's Defense is so high that it is possible for it to survive an Outrage from an Adamant Choice Band Rayquaza. Giratina is often noted as one of the few counters to the \"Extreme Killer\" Arceus.</p> <p>However, Giratina does lack a reliable recovery move. For a winged lizard, it shamefully does not get Roost. However, it does not truly need such a move, as Rest, Sleep Talk, and colossal defenses are enough to make up for that loss.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The best EVs to use for Giratina are listed in every set. Dumping the EVs into Special Defense instead of Defense is an option. However, since Giratina's weaknesses are more often special than physical, it isn't recommended. 24 EVs in Speed allows Giratina to outrun a max Speed Tyranitar and no Speed Groudon and Dialga.</p> <p>Giratina has a lot of other attacks it can use, but there is not much that is actually more useful than what is mentioned above. Toxic and Roar are usable options on the Rest/Talking set, but that means you can't touch Steel-types. Losing Will-O-Wisp means you lose part of Giratina's ability to wall things physically. Of course, one cannot forget its signature move, Shadow Force. While it does have base 120 power, it is incapable of hitting Normal-types such as Blissey and Arceus, who may attempt to switch in on the charging turn. In addition, Steel-types like Skarmory and Forretress can take it without much trouble.</p> <p>One should not underestimate Giratina's offensive capabilities. It has a large offensive movepool and two of the best STAB in Ubers, so it can make use of a Choice Band or a Choice Specs set to hit hard and surprise its counters. However, Giratina is rather slow. While Base 100 offenses aren't bad, they are slightly below average for Uber play. Furthermore, its cousin, Giratina-O, generally outclasses Giratina in the way of offense.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>For the standard Great Wall set, Arceus-Dark will easily Calm Mind and launch a super effective Judgment against Giratina. The same applies for Arceus-Ghost and Arceus-Ice. Arceus-Dragon can do the same too, but Dragon Claw will dent it. Blissey can Calm Mind and eventually beat Giratina with Ice Beam. Dialga can switch into anything Giratina throws at it and OHKO with Draco Meteor (most variants also 2HKO with Dragon Pulse) or Bulk Up and eventually defeat it with Outrage. Dialga can also use Rest to remove burn. Darkrai can come in on Rest, Taunt Giratina, and then Calm Mind or Nasty Plot and wipe Giratina off the battleground with Dark Pulse. With Giratina self-resting to remove the damages dealt to it, Darkrai is now able to put another member to sleep with Dark Void, since Sleep Clause is not active. Mewtwo is capable of doing the same, minus the Dark Void. Mew can Taunt Giratina and then Nasty Plot and Baton Pass away to a dangerous recipient, such as Palkia or Arceus.</p> <p>The Calm Mind set is harder to counter. Your best bet is a Arceus-Dark with Substitute to laugh at any status attack it throws at you, but beware of Roar. Latios and Latias can easily Calm Mind alongside Giratina, Recovering any Dragon Pulse damage it throws at any of them. They must, however, be aware of Toxic or Roar if they decide to Calm Mind alongside Giratina. While Giratina Rests, physical attackers, such as Arceus-Ghost, are able to take advantage of the situation and set up, following up with a dangerous Shadow Claw. Tyranitar has a safe switch in on Calm Mind, Dragon Pulse or Rest due to the Special Defense boost from sandstorm, but must be wary of Toxic and Will-O-Wisp. If those are absent, Tyranitar can easily inflict serious injury with Crunch.</p> ",

Sleep Talk enables Giratina to absorb status and ensures that it isn't set up bait for Rayquaza and Arceus, seeing as Sleep Talk may pick Will-O-Wisp and ruin their fun. Roar also allows Giratina to act as a good phazer and can be used over Will-O-Wisp if your team relies heavily on Toxic Spikes, because then Giratina could not burn as many opponents. Giratina also has a distinction as the only common spinblocker, aside from its counterpart Giratina-O, that can phaze. Dragon Claw enables Giratina to severely damage other Dragon-types, OHKO Deoxys-A, and deal a respectable amount of damage to Ho-Oh and Darkrai; whereas Dragon Pulse carries a dash more power against Groudon. Outrage will do more damage than Dragon Claw, and Giratina will not be locked in to Outrage if it is selected via Sleep Talk. However, use it sparingly when awake, as Giratina will then be vulnerable to being revenge killed.</p> <p>Many of the powerful special attackers in Ubers will quickly decimate Giratina with their powerful strikes. It doesn't help that Giratina possesses weaknesses to Dragon-, Ice-, Ghost-, and Dark-type attacks, all of which are commonly used attack types in the tier. Mewtwo and Darkrai can both make Giratina useless with Taunt and then proceed to set up quickly and wipe Giratina away with powerful super effective special attacks. Many of the powerful Dragon-typed special attackers, such as Dialga, Palkia, Latios, Latias, and Giratina-O, will easily steamroll Giratina with STAB Dragon-type moves; though the latter three will not want to eat Giratina's STAB Dragon Claw. Kyogre can easily pick off Giratina with Ice Beam or sometimes Water Spout, should Giratina be weakened, or set up on it with Calm Mind. Finally, there a few physical sweepers that will easily KO Giratina, such as Rayquaza (after it sets up), Choice Band Garchomp, and Bulk Up Dialga; although the former two will hate Will-O-Wisp. Steel-types make great teammates for Giratina, as they resist all of Giratina's weaknesses, and can beat many of its common counters.</p> <p>Specially Defensive Scizor is a superb example of a good teammate. It can easily switch in on Mewtwo (beware of Flamethrower), Darkrai (watch out for +2 Focus Blast), Latias, and Latios (watch for Hidden Power Fire), and OHKO them all with U-turn, trap them with Pursuit, or pick them off with Bullet Punch. Thanks to Scizor's Dragon-type resistance, it can easily switch on Dialga's, Palkia's, Giratina-O's, Garchomp, and Rayquaza's Dragon-type attacks as well, provided they aren't holding a Choice item that boosts attack power. (If they're not holding a Choice item or locked into Outrage, do not switch into them or you will likely get roasted.) Another good partner for Giratina is Jirachi, since it can take any Dragon- or Ice-type attacks aimed at Giratina and can cripple threats such as Calm Mind Mewtwo, Calm Mind Kyogre, Latias, and Latios with Toxic, hampering their ability to set up on Giratina effectively. It can also stall out non-Choice Specs Kyogre and Palkia with a combination of Wish, Protect, and Toxic, and, like Scizor, Jirachi can revenge kill Garchomp and Rayquaza locked into Outrage. Jirachi can also enhance Giratina's ability to take hits with Wish, Reflect, and / or Light Screen.</p> <p>Blissey can take any special attack thrown at Giratina and use Wish to help ease Giratina switching in to battle or Aromatherapy to cure Giratina's self-induced Sleep status. Forretress also resists all of Giratina's weaknesses and can easily switch to set up entry hazards, which will greatly hinder the opposing team. Giratina also blocks Rapid Spin, so you will not lose your entry hazards. A supporting Dialga can deal with non-Choice Specs Kyogre and can cripple Mewtwo, Latias, Latios, and other special attackers by using Thunder Wave. Additionally, a Calm Mind Latias of your own, despite sharing Giratina's weaknesses, can take on most Kyogre variants, Giratina-O if it does not have Stealth Rock damage, mixed Dialga, and Palkia. Be careful though, as Latias is 2HKOed by Choice Specs Kyogre's Ice Beam. Groudon also gets a mention, as it can deal with the physical attackers that Giratina cannot, thanks to its high Defense, lack of a Dragon weakness, and Dragon Claw as well as access to Thunder Wave to cripple fast sweepers.</p> <p>Giratina walls physical attackers, such as Groudon, Scizor, Metagross, Heracross, some Tyranitar, and physical versions of Ho-Oh almost effortlessly, so sweepers who normally have trouble with these threats make good offensive teammates for Giratina. Pokemon such as Mewtwo, Darkrai, Latios, Latias, Shaymin-S, and Deoxys-A all benefit from having Giratina around to incapacitate these threats, as they can all block sweeping attempts made by any of these Pokemon. Rayquaza is also an excellent complement, as Groudon (watch out for Thunder Wave), Scizor, and Metagross can no longer stop Rayquaza from sweeping once they have their Attack cut by Will-O-Wisp. Garchomp works the same way as Rayquaza.</p> "

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>Giratina can also utilize Calm Mind in order to boost its stats on the special side without having many problems with taking physical assaults, thanks to its high Defense. To keep Giratina alive, it must Rest so it can continue to set up more Calm Minds and eventually unleash a powerful Dragon Pulse. To further aid its set-up, it can use Sleep Talk to use moves while it sleeps. It is the preferred option so Giratina does not become set-up bait for opposing sweepers. It can then use its sleeping turns to further stat up or dent your opponent with Dragon Pulse. Will-O-Wisp lowers the opponent's Attack, allowing it to take hits on the physical side with greater ease. Roar keeps opposing Calm Mind users from setting up on Giratina. Shadow Ball lets it hit Psychic-type Ubers such as Mewtwo and Deoxys-D while still doing a decent amount of damage to Metagross. You must be aware, however, that most of Giratina's weaknesses lay on the special side, which may hamper its ability to set up, unless it already has a few Calm Minds under its belt.</p> <p>Even though Giratina will be boosting its Special Defense with Calm Mind, it still has problems with all of the Pokemon listed above in the previous set, so any of the teammates from that set will work just as well with this Giratina. However, there are a few more Pokemon with whom this Giratina will have a tough time. The first is Tyranitar because it can 2HKO Giratina with a Choice Band boosted Crunch, and will laugh at even a boosted Dragon Pulse , especially since the sandstorm will boost its Special Defense. Tyranitar can also employ Taunt and Dragon Dance to set up on Giratina, as it can Taunt Giratina to prevent it from setting up, then Dragon Dance while it tries to hurt Tyranitar with Dragon Pulse. This, however, cannot be done if you are using Will-O-Wisp on the switch. Swords Dance Lucario can also switch in on Rest, use Swords Dance, and 2HKO you with Crunch, while a +1 Dragon Pulse won't even 2HKO Lucario. Lastly, this set greatly fears phazers because they can Roar or Whirlwind away Giratina's boosts. It certainly doesn't help that the most common phazers, Groudon, Lugia, and Skarmory, can all survive a Dragon Pulse without much of problem. Forretress helps Giratina immensely, because it can switch into Tyranitar's Choice Banded Crunches and defeat it with Gyro Ball. Forretress can also lay down the dreaded Toxic Spikes, which means Blissey can no longer stall you, and it also helps weaken Giratina's opponents to make its sweep easier. Giratina also has the advantage of blocking Rapid Spin, thanks to its Ghost-typing, and since there are no Poison-typed Ubers and neither Roserade nor Tentacruel are used, Toxic Spikes can't be removed as long as Giratina is in play. Kyogre is an excellent way to deal with the above phazers, severely hurting them all with its powerful Surf or Thunder attack. Choice Scarf Dialga works in much the same way, but it provides resistances to Ghost- and Dark-type moves, and is a much more reliable check for Lucario, thanks to its resistance to Extreme Speed</p> "

        "name": "Attacking Lead",
        "description": "<p>Although Giratina is usually seen as a nearly impenetrable physical wall or sturdy Calm Mind booster, this set allows it to effectiely fill the role of an attacking lead. The combination of powerful attacks, strong priority, and Haban Berry makes Giratina one of the most reliable ways to defeat common leads such as Deoxys-S, Deoxys-A, Groudon, Mew, Rayquaza, Giratina-O, and Tyranitar.</p> <p>Draco Meteor followed by Shadow Sneak is a guaranteed KO on 252 HP / 4 Def Deoxys-S, limiting it to a maximum of one layer of entry hazards. Deoxys-A is defeated by the same combination of attacks, while Groudon and Mew will struggle to do any meaningful damage as Giratina hacks away at their health with its attacks. Will-O-Wisp is useful for burning Groudon, but Hidden Power Fire is also an option to defeat Forretress and Scizor provided that rain isn't present. Unlike Giratina-O, this Giratina also has the ability to defeat Rayquaza, and by extention, Giratina-O leads, thanks to Haban Berry. Finally, Aura Sphere 2HKOes 252 HP / 0 SpD Tyranitar, and gives Giratina a reliable way of damaging Dialga and Heatran.</p> <p>Despite its role, this Giratina also has a great deal of late-game potential. If Haban Berry isn't used up against your opponent's lead, it can be used in a pinch later on against the many Dragon-types of the Uber tier. For instance, Giratina takes less than 50% from Timid Lustrous Orb Palkia's Spacial Rend thanks to Haban Berry, allowing it to easily OHKO back with Draco Meteor. Shadow Sneak makes Giratina a great revenge killer, hitting speedy threats, like Mewtwo and Latios, for super effective damage. Despite a Hasty nature, Giratina still possesses excellent bulk, and thank to Will-O-Wisp, it can still play the part of a physical tank if needed during the later stages of a match.</p> <p>Most bulky leads that are not hit super effectively by Giratina's attacks will be problematic. Kyogre is the worst match-up, as it can take repeated Draco Meteors and will KO Giratina with Ice Beam. Barring Hidden Power Fire, Forretress doesn't take much from anything Giratina can do, Will-O-Wisp included, allowing it to comfortably set up Spikes. Darkrai is also very threatening, as it can either put Giratina to sleep with Dark Void or deal massive damage with Dark Pulse. Although almost never seen as a lead, Blissey fears none of Giratina's attacks, and can wither Giratina's HP down since Giratina has no form of recovery. Pairing Giratina with Choice Scarf Palkia gives it a reliable check for Kyogre, as well as a way of OHKOing Forretress and Darkrai. Palkia also appreciates Giratina's ability to reduce the number of entry hazards that Deoxys-S sets up, as Spikes quickly wears Palkia down. A mono-attacking Kyogre with Calm Mind will not only force Forretress out, but can absorb Darkrai's Dark Void and set up against and defeat Blissey. Additionally, Kyogre's typing synergizes well with Giratina. Speaking of synergy, Scizor perfectly covers Giratina's weaknesses and can take Dragon-type attacks well once Giratina's Haban Berry is used up.</p> "

  "Manaphy": {
    "overview": "<p>Manaphy is often left in the dust in lieu of its fellow Uber Water-types Kyogre and Palkia. Manaphy absolutely needs rain support from Kyogre to do anything in Ubers, and both Kyogre and Palkia have much better offensive stats as well as movepools. Furthermore, Manaphy also has to compete with fellow rain abusers Kingdra and Kabutops, who both get Swift Swim to boost their Speed stats to astronomical levels. (Kingdra even gets Dragon-type STAB like Palkia.) Faced with these competitors, one may think that there is no reason to use Manaphy at all.</p> <p>However, Manaphy does have a few tricks up its sleeve. Hydration, when used with Rest and rain support, allows Manaphy to instantly heal itself and remove any status condition, which no other Pokemon in Ubers can do. It may not be as immediately threatening as either Kyogre or Palkia, but its access to Tail Glow means it can power up faster than either of them. Manaphy is also much bulkier than Kingdra and Kabutops.</p> <p>Its movepool is somewhat limited compared to its fellow Ubers and rain abusers, but what it has is just enough to make it a decent threat.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>For EVs in the use in sweeping sets, you'll want Timid with at least 308 Speed (Timid, 176 EVs) to beat Kyogre, Groudon, and Ho-Oh. You can aim for 319 (Timid, 216 EVs) to get ahead of max Speed Rayquaza. Max Speed is only useful if you wish to tie with Timid Palkia. Max out Special Attack afterwards, with anything left placed in HP.</p> <p>You can use a bulkier spread if you want Manaphy to take hits while setting up Tail Glow. 172 HP EVs allows Manaphy to survive a Choice Scarf Thunder from Kyogre, although you'll have to sacrifice Speed or Special Attack.</p> <p>For the Toxic stalling set, you'll want lots of HP and some Special Defense. You can aim for 277 Special Attack if you wish to guarantee an OHKO on minimum HP Rayquaza, although even without any EV investment, you still have a small chance of scoring an OHKO. Otherwise, simply max out Special Defense, which will give you a good chance of surviving a Choice Specs Thunder from Modest Kyogre, and will always survive a hit from Timid versions.</p> <p>Manaphy also has several other moves at its disposal. Heart Swap is Manaphy's signature move and can be used to steal stat boosts from opponents. Calm Mind can go over Tail Glow for a more defensive minded set-up. Energy Ball can replace Grass Knot if you're concerned about other Manaphy, but otherwise, Grass Knot is the better choice against other Ubers. Shadow Ball is a surprisingly poor option, since rain-boosted Surfs do more to the likes of Mewtwo and Deoxys, while Ice Beam does more to Dragon-types, such as Giratina, Latias, and Latios. Substitute is a decent option on sweeper sets, ordinarily over Rest, and can also work with Calm Mind. After a few Calm Minds your Substitute will be increasingly hard to break, especially with the popularity of special attacks in the Ubers metagame. Manaphy also learns Reflect and Light Screen, which it can use to assist it and its teammates in taking the brutal assaults of Ubers play. Manaphy can also run a Choice Specs set if you want power without having to set up. While it does have U-turn and the ability to shrug off status thanks to Hydration, it is largely outclassed in the offensive department by other Choice Specs users, such as Kyogre and Palkia, should you go that route.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Calm Mind Blissey makes a fine counter and can stat up alongside Manaphy before finishing it off with Thunder. Dialga can wall its attacks quite effectively and Roar it out or hit back with Thunder. Latias' massive Special Defense stat prevents Ice Beam from hurting her and her superior Speed, backed up with Recover, allows her to set up Calm Minds on Manaphy, eventually firing a powerful Dragon Pulse or Thunder, that would ultimately annihilate it. Her Speed also means that Manaphy won't be fast enough to Heart Swap Latias' Calm Minds before being KOed. Palkia's 4x resistance to Surf and a very good base 120 Special Defense allows it to land a Choice Specs Thunder on Manaphy, easily OHKOing it. If Manaphy does not pack Grass Knot, Kyogre can switch into Manaphy with impunity and throw a very powerful Thunder at it.</p> <p>Beware of Rayquaza, Groudon, or Tyranitar switching in on Rest, as their ability to change the weather means Manaphy will be stuck sleeping for two turns, giving them ample time to set up for a sweep.</p> ",

        "name": "Tail Glow Sweeper",
        "description": "<p>This is Manaphy's best sweeping set, allowing it to easily increase its Special Attack to astronomical levels with Tail Glow, Rest off the damage, wake up instantly thanks to Hydration, and sweep. Make sure you are packing rain support when using this set, as that is what makes Manaphy truly shine.</p> <p>Ice Beam is generally the better option in the last slot, giving Manaphy an easy OHKO on Rayquaza, who can negate rain's side-effects with Air Lock, making Hydration useless. It also helps against the other Dragon-types, like Giratina, Latias, and Latios. Grass Knot ensures an OHKO on Kyogre, hits Palkia harder than Ice Beam, and can hit Groudon and Tyranitar who may come in to stop the rain. Neither option leaves you entirely helpless against certain foes, however. For example, if you go with Ice Beam, you can still 2HKO Kyogre with Surf, thanks to boosts from Tail Glow, Life Orb, and Drizzle. If you opt for Grass Knot, then you can still 2HKO Rayquaza with a Life Orb Surf after a Tail Glow boost. Latios can also be 2HKOed by boosted Surfs in the rain, even accounting for Soul Dew (his more defensive sister will usually survive two hits though).</p> <p>The choice of item depends on your personal preference. Leftovers makes for a sturdier Manaphy and can ease set-up. Life Orb gives it some extra kick, and the 10% recoil can be made up for with Rest, especially with Hydration.</p> <p>The EVs are fairly straightforward. Max Special Attack is necessary to inflict as much damage as possible. The Speed EVs allow Manaphy to outrun all base 90s who do not hold a Choice Scarf, including Kyogre, Groudon, and Dialga, while also letting Manaphy beat max Speed Adamant Rayquaza. The HP EVs give Manaphy decent bulk to assist in setting up, while also minimizing Life Orb recoil. One could also elect to pull EVs from HP to increase Manaphy's Speed to 319 (Timid, 216 EVs), if you are paranoid about Jolly Rayquaza.</p> <p>Manaphy needs to mainly watch out for powerful attackers who are faster than it and resist Surf. Palkia has a 4x resistance to Water-type attacks, is not particularly weak to Ice Beam and Grass Knot, and will fry Manaphy with Thunder. Latios and Latias also defeat Manaphy in a similar fashion, but must watch out for Ice Beam. Dialga is not weak to any of Manaphy's assaults, and it also has Thunder to hit Manaphy. Kyogre will also make mincemeat out of those Manaphy running Ice Beam over Grass Knot and can even set up on poor Manaphy with Calm Mind. Manaphy will be unable to get past Blissey if it has Calm Mind. While they can't switch in on a boosted attack, Rayquaza, Groudon, and Tyranitar can come in on the turn Manaphy uses Rest, forcing it to sleep for two turns, while all of them can employ their own stat-boosting moves to prepare for a sweep of their own. Finally, Manaphy is also vulnerable to being revenge killed from Pokemon such as Garchomp, Mewtwo, Shaymin-S, and Darkrai. Blissey can take any special attack thrown at Manaphy and respond with debilitating status, such as Toxic or Thunder Wave. A Choice Scarf Palkia makes a good check to all of these threats (except opposing Choice Scarf Palkia), destroying them all with its powerful Dragon-type attacks. Wobbuffet can trap and KO all of these threats, sans Choice Specs Kyogre or Darkrai, or employ Encore and Safeguard to turn these Pokemon into set-up bait for Manaphy. A specially defensive Dialga provides resists to Manaphy's Grass and Electric weaknesses and can cripple the above threats with Thunder Wave, making them less of a threat for Manaphy. Thunder Wave Kyogre, while sharing weaknesses with Manaphy, acts as a great lure for Manaphy's counters, so it can render them useless by paralyzing them. A Latias of your own is also a great partner, as it is capable of taking down Kyogre and most Palkia with relative ease, although it cannot switch in directly for the fear of Spacial Rend or Outrage, while also being able to take any Electric- or Grass-type moves thrown at Manaphy. Choice Scarf Garchomp can also provide Manaphy with an Electric-type immunity and will outspeed and KO all of these threats with its powerful Earthquake or Outrage. Scizor is also a good teammate to deal with Mewtwo, Darkrai, Shaymin-S, Latios, and Latias, all of whom may try to revenge kill Manaphy, with Bullet Punch or U-turn. Scizor can also take on Choice Scarf Garchomp locked into Outrage.</p> "

        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<p>This set is designed to abuse Toxic and Rest. Poison your foes and stall them out with Rest, while they slowly die from the intensifying damage. Ice Beam is present to kill off Rayquaza, lest he spoil your fun with Air Lock. Grass Knot will hit Kyogre and also takes a big chunk out of Groudon. Light Screen and Reflect are options in the final two slots for more stalling potential and team support. Heart Swap could also be used here to prevent foes from setting up on you.</p> <p>Since this is a defensive set, the EVs should reflect it. You'll want this Manaphy to be slow so it can take hits, as even Thunder from Choice Scarf Kyogre fails to OHKO, barring a critical hit. The Special Attack EVs ensure you will always OHKO minimum HP Rayquaza and can then Rest up to full health. Because Manaphy still has a slight chance to OHKO Rayquaza even with minimum Special Attack, it is possible, although not recommended, to switch the Special Attack EVs to either of the defensive stats. You can also opt to simply max out HP and Special Defense. This gives you a chance to survive Thunder from Modest Choice Specs Kyogre, as Manaphy will always survive a hit from Timid versions.</p> <p>This Manaphy, while being able to outstall some of its common counters with Toxic, still needs to watch out for some of the above threats, more specifically Choice Specs Kyogre, Calm Mind Latias and Latios, and Dialga (especially Bulk Up variants), as they can set up on you now that Dialga does not have to fear boosted Ice Beams and is immune to Toxic. Rest + Sleep Talk Kyogre with Calm Mind can set up on Manaphy without Grass Knot and can Rest off Toxic. Choice Scarf Garchomp is, once again, a great partner, as it is able to switch in on Thunder aimed at Manaphy, outrun all of these threats, and KO them with strong Dragon- and Ground-type strikes. Latias can Calm Mind alongside Kyogre and defeat it with Grass Knot.</p> <p>Again, this set fears opposing weather changers, such as Groudon, Tyranitar, and Rayquaza, from coming in on Rest and setting up a sweep that could spell doom for your team. Choice Scarf Palkia is a nice check for these threats, able to severely hurt or KO them all with a powerful Draco Meteor (or Aura Sphere for Tyranitar). You can also use Choice Scarf Dialga, who makes a better check to Swords Dance Rayquaza, but will be outsped by Jolly variants of Rayquaza after a single Dragon Dance, meaning you will be unable to revenge kill it. Make sure to use Kyogre to replace the rain after these threats are eliminated.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Bulky Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>This set aims to utilize Manaphy's decent bulk to pull off a slow sweep. The idea is to switch into a Pokemon who can't really threaten Manaphy and set up a Calm Mind. From there, Calm Mind up and Rest off damage when Manaphy's HP gets low. Even after just one Calm Mind, Manaphy manages to survive many attacks with plenty of HP to spare, allowing it to continue to use Calm Mind and Rest until it is powerful enough to sweep. Manaphy is also able to take physical hits reasonably well. For instance, it can survive an unboosted Garchomp's Outrage and KO back with Ice Beam. Surf is Manaphy's STAB move, being bolstered by the rain that Kyogre provides. The last move is for coverage. Ice Beam KOes Rayquaza who can nullify the weather, and hence remove Manaphy's ability to Rest. Ice Beam also hits Dragon-type Pokemon like Garchomp, Giratina, Latias, and Latios for super effective damage while allowing Manaphy to hit Dialga and Palkia for neutral damage. Grass Knot is for Kyogre switch-ins. Here are a few damage calculations to demonstrate Manaphy's ability to take hits:</p> <ul> <li>Neutral 252 SpA Kyogre, Palkia, Dialga Thunder vs +1 Manaphy: 48.02% - 56.93% <li>Neutral 204 SpA Latias Thunder vs +1 Manaphy: 55.45% - 65.35%</li> <li>Neutral 252 SpA Latios Thunder vs +1 Manaphy: 64.85% - 76.73%</li> </ul> <p>As shown above, after a Calm Mind, Manaphy can take on quite a lot of special attacks and Rest off the damage while continuing to build up Calm Minds. It should be noted, however, that Latias and Latios can Calm Mind alongside Manaphy, and Shaymin-S can easily remove the Special Defense boosts gained through Calm Mind with Seed Flare.</p> <p>The EVs are relatively simple; max Speed allows Manaphy to tie with Palkia and Salamence. Max HP is used for bulk, while the rest go into Special Attack. Like all Manaphy sets, this set requires rain support from Kyogre. Hydration coupled with Rest is what makes Manaphy so deadly, and without it, Manaphy is rather weak and lacks recovery. A bulky Kyogre with Thunder Wave is best for Calm Mind Manaphy, as Kyogre being able to survive most of a match is critical. Thunder Wave Kyogre can also lure out and cripple many of Manaphy's counters, like Latias and Palkia. The hard-hitting Choice Specs Kyogre also fit alongside Manaphy, with Kyogre breaking down special walls with its insanely powerful attacks so Manaphy can clean up later. It should be noted that Kyogre and Manaphy have the same typing, and therefore, the same weaknesses. Swords Dance Garchomp, Latias, and Dialga are great Pokemon to switch into Electric-type attacks with their ability to set up on them.</p> <p>Automatic weather-inducers (Groudon, Tyranitar, and to an extent Rayquaza) will obviously cause problems for Manaphy, especially if they switch in while Manaphy Rests. Groudon can be lured using Mixed Bulk Up Dialga, who can draw in Groudon and proceed to KO it with Draco Meteor. Garchomp can check any Tyranitar without Ice Beam. Rayquaza is only dangerous should it catch Manaphy Resting, so a Choice Scarf Garchomp or Palkia is sufficient to check it. Manaphy will also has issues with other Pokemon who can Calm Mind alongside it. Kyogre, Latias, Latios, and Giratina can Calm Mind alongside Manaphy and eventually strike it down. Teammates who can defeat such opponents will greatly help Manaphy set up and sweep. Calm Mind Latias can switch into Calm Mind Kyogre and Calm Mind alongside it. Latias and Latios are best defeated by Pursuit users. Tyranitar is generally not a good idea, as its Sand Stream ability will kill the rain that Manaphy desperately needs. Scizor and Metagross are probably the best Pursuit users to use alongside Manaphy, as they resist the Dragon-type STAB moves from Latias and Latios and can Pursuit them to death. Beware, however, that Thunder from either of them can 2HKO both Scizor and Metagross.</p> "

  "Darkrai": {
    "overview": "<p>With its incredible 125 base Speed—outsped by only a handful of Pokemon regularly seen in the Uber tier—and respectable 135 base Special Attack, this terror of twilight induces nighttime horrors throughout the land it travels. With Dark Void capturing opponents in its enveloping slumber 80% of the time and Nasty Plot raising an already impressive Special Attack, Darkrai is one of the most successful boosting sweepers in the Uber metagame. Darkrai's ability, Bad Dreams, deals damage to any sleeping Pokemon, allowing it to render opponents' Focus Sashes useless. On top of this, Darkrai's Dark typing grants it an immunity to Mirror Coat, allowing Darkrai to take on Wobbuffet extremely well.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Calm Mind can be used over Nasty Plot in order to boost both Special Attack and Special Defense, but this is discouraged. Besides access to Dark Void to help it set up, as a Calm Mind sweeper Darkrai is completely outclassed by Mewtwo, who has higher HP, Special Attack, and Speed along with identical defenses. It is also outclassed by Arceus-Dark, who has better HP and defenses in exchange for a lack of Dark Void and less Speed. Arceus-Dark also has Judgment, which is a stronger STAB move than Dark Pulse.</p> <p>Taunt can be used over Focus Blast in order to counter Sleep Talkers. This removes one of Darkrai's biggest weaknesses, giving it at least one more turn to use Nasty Plot. While it does allow Darkrai to cripple Sleep Talkers switching in on Dark Void, Taunt also takes up a valuable move slot that Darkrai often cannot handle parting with. If using Taunt over Focus Blast, Darkrai becomes vulnerable to other Darkrai, Dialga, Scizor, as well as Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Steel, all of whom can take a boosted Dark Pulse with relative ease.</p> <p>Lum Berry can be used for Nasty Plot Darkrai instead of any of the listed items. Lum Berry allows a lead Darkrai to take sleep from opposing Darkrai or Pokemon that try to cripple it with Thunder Wave. Lum Berry can also be used in conjunction with Substitute to better prevent status. This helps most against Trick or Treat lead Darkrai who will be locked into Dark Void and will be forced to switch out once the Substitute is set up.</p> <p>A Swords Dance set can be used if you are looking for a physical sweeper as well as a surprise. When using Swords Dance it is recommended that Darkrai have an Adamant nature with 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe EVs, along with Life Orb as Darkrai's held item. This optimizes Darkrai's Attack, while still giving it enough Speed to tie with max Speed Hidden Power Fire Latios and Latias. The moves are very similar to those of the Nasty Plot set, swapping out Nasty Plot, Dark Pulse, and Focus Blast for Swords Dance, Sucker Punch, and Brick Break. Sucker Punch allows Darkrai to make up for its lower Speed stat with its priority and STAB, while Brick Break is used for coverage. While the damage calculations look impressive and the set has a definite surprise factor, relying on Sucker Punch as Darkrai's main move will often disappoint.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Darkrai's only true counters are sleep absorbers who can switch into Dark Void and stop Darkrai from setting up. Sleep Talkers are the most common sleep absorbers, and the best one to take on Darkrai is Kyogre. Kyogre can switch in and absorb the sleep and fails to be 3HKOed without Stealth Rock. Kyogre is then able to either set up with Calm Mind or do 92.2% - 108.9% to Darkrai with Surf, leaving Darkrai able to only attack once because of Life Orb recoil. Sleep Talk Heracross can also absorb Dark Void, and not only still able to attack through Sleep Talk, but gains the Guts boost through the sleep status. Heracross also resists both of Darkrai's attacks while both of its Fighting- and Bug-type STAB are super effective against Darkrai. Other Sleep Talkers such as Giratina and Dialga are not as effective as they are afraid of taking a Dark Pulse or Focus Blast respectively. Other Pokemon that are immune to sleep, such as Primeape and Manaphy in the rain, can switch in on Darkrai's Dark Void. Choice Scarf Primeape can switch in and hit Darkrai with either a U-turn or STAB Close Combat, which will both hurt Darkrai significantly, but has no other real uses in the Uber metagame. Manaphy is also immune to sleep, but still takes Darkrai's hits relatively hard. Both bulky and offensive Calm Mind Manaphy fail to OHKO Darkrai with Surf in the rain, while Darkrai can 3HKO bulky and 2HKO offensive Manaphy with an unboosted Dark Pulse.</p> <p>Darkrai is difficult to handle before Sleep Clause has taken effect. Once activated, however, Arceus-Fighting becomes the closest thing to a true counter to Darkrai that exists. It is only 3HKOed by +2 Dark Pulse and can take a +2 Focus Blast, and can OHKO Darkrai with a super effective Judgment. Darkrai's only chance to win outside of critical hits is to Nasty Plot on the switch and use Dark Pulse first, hoping for a flinch, followed by a Focus Blast. However, without the ability to sleep opposing Pokemon, Darkrai can be revenge-killed by any hard-hitting Pokemon that is faster than it. This includes Deoxys-A, Mewtwo, Palkia / Dialga holding a Choice Scarf, and Pokemon with strong priority attacks, such as Scizor, Arceus, and Rayquaza. Ho-Oh also checks Darkrai well if it doesn't have to worry about Dark Void. Thanks to Ho-Oh's massive Special Defense, it does not fear a boosted Dark Pulse from Darkrai as much as other Pokemon and can retaliate with a powerful Brave Bird that can OHKO.</p> ",

        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Darkrai's Speed and Dark Void's excellent accuracy (for a sleep-inducing move), it is often easy for Darkrai to set up at least one Nasty Plot. This skyrockets Darkrai's fair (by Uber standards) Special Attack to a frightening 738 in one turn. Using both Dark Pulse and Focus Blast gives Darkrai excellent neutral coverage resisted only by Heracross and Toxicroak. Even with only neutral damage, Darkrai hits hard with +2 Dark Pulse or Focus Blast. STAB Dark Pulse is the main attack, doing heavy damage with the possibility of flinching the opponent. While Focus Blast's accuracy is sometimes unnerving, it allows Darkrai to better handle Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon that resist Dark Pulse, including Tyranitar, Heatran, Dialga, and opposing Darkrai.</p> <p>This Darkrai set can function superbly as either a lead or a late-game sweeper. When in the lead position, it is recommended that Darkrai has Focus Sash as its item, allowing it to survive attacks when an opponent's Lum Berry wakes it up. This will usually guarantee that a Pokemon is put to sleep. After this, Bad Dreams allows Darkrai to break the Focus Sash of Deoxys-A, Deoxys-S, and Froslass and then OHKO them with Dark Pulse. When using Darkrai as a late-game sweeper, Life Orb is recommended due to the increase in power and the lower chance of encountering Lum Berry. This will greatly increase Darkrai's damage output, while the recoil isn't devastating as long as you watch out for Choice Scarf and priority users.</p> <p>Substitute can be used over Focus Blast for a mono-attacking Darkrai. While this does reduce Darkrai's coverage significantly, Substitute makes it easier for Darkrai to set up, as well as covering its weakness to faster Pokemon and priority attacks. Substitute also protects Darkrai from being crippled by Thunder Wave and serves as a bulwark against opposing Darkrai. Leftovers is the suggested item in conjunction with Substitute. Substitute and Focus Sash have no use together, and Substitute and Life Orb will wear away at Darkrai's HP too quickly for Darkrai to truly be effective.</p> <p>Leftovers can be used instead of Life Orb for a late-game sweeper. Using Leftovers allows for Darkrai to restore HP and raise its survivability at the cost of some power. Leftovers helps one of Darkrai's most common problems: being revenge killed. This can be very crucial if you expect to frequently switch Darkrai in and out while trying to set up Nasty Plot throughout the game. Leftovers, as stated above, also works well with Substitute, helping Darkrai regain the HP it loses from creating Substitutes.</p> <p>This set relies somewhat heavily on its ability to sleep opposing Pokemon, which means that Darkrai really does not like Sleep Talkers, such as Kyogre and Heracross. Because of these threats, Giratina-O and Calm Mind Giratina make good partners, since it is able to check and set up on Sleep Talk variants of both Heracross and Kyogre by resisting their standard attacks, as well as being able to counter the occasional Primeape that will try and ruin Darkrai's fun with its immunity to sleep. Teamwise, Giratina walls Heracross and Primeape, while Giratina-O can set up on either one locked into Close Combat and then proceed to sweep. Latias walls and sets up on any Sleep Talking Kyogre.</p> <p>Darkrai is most vulnerable after Sleep Clause has been activated. Choice Scarf Palkia and Dialga can switch into Darkrai and OHKO with Draco Meteor. Choice Scarf Kyogre and Darkrai do the same with Surf and Focus Blast respectively. Life Orb Shaymin-S OHKOes Darkrai with Seed Flare after Stealth Rock damage. Although Mewtwo cannot switch into Dark Pulse or Substitute, it can revenge kill Darkrai by outspeeding it and has an 87% chance to OHKO Darkrai with Aura Sphere after Stealth Rock damage (guaranteed with Life Orb). Finally, Life Orb Scizor 2HKOes Darkrai with Bullet Punch, or OHKOes with U-turn, but keep in mind that a +2 Life Orb Focus Blast OHKOes Scizor after Stealth Rock damage. A Scizor of your own can switch into Choice Scarf Dialga and Palkia's Draco Meteors and any offensive Mewtwo without Fire Blast, and either Roost or U-turn (or Pursuit in Mewtwo's case). Wobbuffet destroys Choice Scarf Dialga and Palkia with Mirror Coat, while Encore can help Darkrai set up. Choice Scarf Dialga counters Shaymin-S with its quadruple Grass resistance, and it can switch into any of Scizor's attacks except Superpower and OHKO with Fire Blast. Latias handles Kyogre and can switch into a Choiced Darkrai's Focus Blast.</p> "

        "name": "Trick or Treat",
        "description": "<p>Trick Darkrai is truly a nasty surprise for its opposition, taking out one of Darkrai's biggest weaknesses, Sleep Talkers, while still giving it the potential to sweep. After crippling a Sleep Talker with Trick, Darkrai is free to put it to sleep with Dark Void. As Sleep Talk malfunctions with Choice Scarf, most of the time, Darkrai is capable of setting up a Nasty Plot or two assuming that the opponent is still slower than it after getting Tricked the Choice Scarf. STAB Dark Pulse is obvious and packs fairly decent coverage since no Pokemon is immune to it.</p> <p>While Trick holds incredible potential, one must use it wisely, as misplaying Trick can make it easy for opponents to outplay Darkrai. Tricking an opposing Choice user will only lock Darkrai into Trick and keep it from setting up, as well as possibly giving Darkrai a worse Choice item (for its purposes), such as Choice Band. All forms of Arceus are immune to Trick and will lock Darkrai into Trick, giving Arceus a free turn to set up. It is important to note that Giratina-O, another popular Trick absorber in Ubers, cannot switch into Darkrai safely due to STAB Dark Pulse.</p> <p>Trick Darkrai is an amazing lead; its Speed allows it to outpace Deoxys-S and Deoxys-A leads, either sleeping them with Dark Void, hitting them with Dark Pulse, or Tricking them so that they're stuck on one move, making them easy pickings for a Pokemon with Pursuit such as Scizor or Tyranitar. Yet despite these amazing qualities as a lead, Darkrai can still be used in late-game, where it holds more of a surprise. When used late-game, this Darkrai can use Dark Void to counter such things as Adamant Rock Polish Groudon and opposing Choice Scarf users that can often be extremely troublesome.</p> <p>Focus Blast can be used over Nasty Plot, which allows for Darkrai to be more offensive and preserve its ability to Trick Choice Scarf onto a Pokemon for later in the game. Focus Blast can also help Darkrai deal with Choice Scarf Dialga and opposing Darkrai. While Focus Blast does give Darkrai better coverage, Nasty Plot is still recommended due to the fact that Darkrai is not as powerful without the aid of Life Orb or Nasty Plot. In addition, Darkrai is sometimes hard to switch in and as long as it still holds the Choice Scarf, Darkrai will be forced to switch in and out frequently in order to be truly useful.</p> <p>A more offensive Choice Scarf Darkrai can be used with Ice Beam or Spacial Rend over Trick and Focus Blast instead of Nasty Plot. While offensive Choice Scarf Darkrai is often outclassed by Choice Scarf Mewtwo, it does have two things that Mewtwo doesn't: a fast Dark Void to sleep the opponent's Pokemon with, and the ability to beat Wobbuffet because of Darkrai's immunity to Mirror Coat.</p> <p>When leading with Trick Darkrai, there are several leads who can give it problems. Choice Scarf Mewtwo will outspeed and OHKO Darkrai with Focus Blast, while other variants of Mewtwo will still be able to live through a Dark Pulse. Choice Scarf Shaymin-S can 2HKO Darkrai with Air Slash, which is particularly troublesome because of the flinch chance. Scarf Darkrai's biggest problem is the various leads that rely on Lum Berry or Chesto Berry to absorb Dark Void. A specially defensive Tyranitar with Lum Berry can live through Focus Blast and OHKO Darkrai with Superpower. In a similar vein, a lead Scizor with Lum Berry can OHKO Darkrai with U-turn, and a lead Kyogre with Lum Berry can also OHKO Darkrai with Surf. Both Dialga and Groudon often carry a combination of Lum Berry and Thunder Wave when leading to cripple Darkrai. Support Dialga can be a very useful Pokemon to use with Trick Darkrai, because Dialga resists both Shaymin-S's Air Slash and Scizor's U-turn. Dialga can also help set up Stealth Rock, which will help the rest of team in sweeping. A Bulk Up Dialga can also switch into Kyogre's Surf and set up. Support Groudon is another excellent choice as a teammate, as it not only absorbs Thunder Wave from opposing leads, but it also destroys Tyranitar. Wobbuffet can switch into a Choice Scarf Mewtwo's Focus Blast and 2HKO it with Mirror Coat. Scizor can also survive a Focus Blast from Mewtwo and OHKO Mewtwo with U-turn. Scizor also has the benefit of being able to do a serious amount of damage to lead Tyranitar as long as Scizor avoids a Fire-type attack. Finally, Blissey can easily switch into lead Kyogre and wall its entire moveset.</p> "

        "name": "SubSalac",
        "description": "<p>Since Nasty Plot Darkrai is a huge threat in the Uber metagame, people often deal with it by revenge killing it with faster Pokemon such as Mewtwo and Choice Scarf Palkia / Dialga. By making use of Substitute and Salac Berry, Darkrai has a better chance to avoid this. Simply Substitute when you need to until the Salac Berry activates. When you have the chance, Darkrai can safely Nasty Plot while behind a Substitute. As well as helping Darkrai achieve the Salac Berry boost, Substitute also protects Darkrai from Choice Scarf and priority users that often switch in to revenge kill it. After the boost from Salac Berry, Darkrai will outrun just about everything except Choice Scarf Shaymin-S, Mewtwo, and Deoxys-S, while still retaining the ability to switch moves. With STAB Dark Pulse and Focus Blast, you'll still find it to be a quite fearsome sweeper.</p> <p>The 30 HP IVs makes Darkrai's HP stat divisible by 4. This allows Salac Berry to activate after 3 Substitutes and still gives Darkrai 70 HP to hold on with, which is useful for surviving a Shadow Sneak from Giratina-O.</p> <p>Focus Blast can also be replaced with Dark Void to sleep potential counters that Focus Blast would normally cover, such as Scizor and Dialga, and allow for more free turns to set up while your opponent is sleeping. Without Dark Void, Darkrai will have serious issues with Choice Band Scizor. If Darkrai lacks Focus Blast, specially defensive Tyranitar will give Darkrai serious issues after Sleep Clause has been activated, as even a +6 Dark Pulse will only do 39% maximum to Careful 252 HP / 200 SpD Tyranitar. Meanwhile, the same Tyranitar with 56 Attack EVs and a Choice Band will easily break Darkrai's Substitutes with either Stone Edge or Earthquake. Finally, Sand Stream will make Darkrai's life even shorter, chipping away 6.25% of its HP per turn. Because of these issues, Support Groudon is an excellent teammate for this Darkrai. Groudon will be able to demolish Tyranitar with its STAB super effective Earthquakes, and will do serious damage to Scizor.</p> <p>After Darkrai's Substitute is broken, it is even more susceptible to priority or extremely fast Choice Scarf users. After taking Stealth Rock damage and getting one Substitute broken, Darkrai is in the KO range of Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch. Scizor also has the capability of stopping Darkrai's sweep with Bullet Punch after its Salac Berry has been activated and its Substitute broken. Deoxys-A, Rayquaza, and Lucario can also stop Darkrai's sweep in the same manner with Extreme Speed. Giratina-O makes an excellent teammate as it is able to take Bullet Punches aimed at Darkrai pretty well and is immune to Extreme Speed. The mixed attacking spinblocker set is able to take Bullet Punches from Scizor and outspeed Adamant Lucario, while dealing heavy damage with either Hidden Power Fire or Earthquake. It can also outspeed Adamant Rayquaza and OHKO with either Draco Meteor or Outrage, and can OHKO Deoxys-A with Shadow Sneak. Both Choice Scarf Mewtwo and Choice Scarf Shaymin-S have the potential to end Darkrai's sweep after it has used Salac Berry and had its Substitute broken, thanks to their higher Speed. Metagross can take care of Choice Scarf Shaymin-S for Darkrai, thanks to its resistance to both of its STAB attacks and Clear Body; Metagross can then slam it with Meteor Mash. Choice Scarf Mewtwo is easily dealt with by Wobbuffet, who can switch into the Choiced Fighting-type move and beat Mewtwo with Mirror Coat. Wobbuffet also has the bonus of being able to set up Darkrai thanks to its move combination of Encore and Shadow Tag.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Shaymin-S's brilliant traits, such as a STAB move that crushes both Kyogre and Groudon and a base Speed that beats even Darkrai's, make it a powerful threat in Ubers. It is also very capable of abusing the significant impact of luck in Ubers with its infamous Serene Grace ability combined with its dreaded STABs Seed Flare and Air Slash, often turning the tables upon the opponent even in the direst of situations. Unfortunately, it is fairly frail by Uber standards, being only slightly bulkier than Darkrai. It's also weak to Stealth Rock and forced out by many common Pokemon like Dialga and Scizor. Nevertheless, Shaymin-S is an excellent choice for almost any offensive Uber team because of the significant impact that it can make on the opponent in a relatively short time.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance is an alternative, but Shaymin-S has a poor physical movepool and is completely walled by Lugia, Giratina, Giratina-O, and almost any Steel-type Pokemon. Hidden Power Rock OHKOs Ho-Oh and 2HKOs Rayquaza and Shaymin-S after Stealth Rock damage, but otherwise, it's outclassed by Hidden Power Ice. Quick Attack has priority, but its low power is off-putting even against Deoxys-A. Secret Power is another option that can paralyze the opponent 60% of the time.</p> <p>As an alternate STAB, Grass Knot has 100% accuracy, four times the PP of Seed Flare, and 120 Base Power against most Pokemon in Ubers. However, it only hits Wobbuffet for 60 Base Power and Mew and Manaphy for 20 Base Power. Grass Knot also lacks Seed Flare's chance of lowering the opponent's Special Defense by two stages, one of Shaymin-S's best selling points. Energy Ball is another 100% accurate Grass-type attack that still hits Manaphy for a large amount of damage with a 40% chance of dropping the foes Special Attack, but the power loss generally makes it an inferior option.</p> <p>Type-resisting Berries, such as Yache Berry, could be considered, but Mewtwo and Kyogre will still OHKO Shaymin-S through a Yache Berry. Both Petaya Berry and Salac Berry are viable options for an offensively oriented Substitute set. Finally, Wide Lens will allow Shaymin-S to have a more accurate Seed Flare and Air Slash.</p> <p>Psych Up can be used to steal the foe's stat ups, but it is far less reliable than Growth and Swords Dance are. Shaymin-S has Safeguard and Aromatherapy for status protection, but it's generally too frail to use them effectively. Worry Seed can stop Giratina and Dialga from using their main method of recovery, Rest, but it's generally not worth the moveslot. Toxic cripples both Lugia and Latias if they attempt to switch into Shaymin-S. Synthesis is Shaymin-S's only recovery move beyond Rest, and it can be used to extend Life Orb Shaymin-S's life span when paired with Groudon's eternal sunlight. Finally, Shaymin-S is arguably the best user of Healing Wish due to its 127 base Speed stat. Healing Wish can restore a weakened sweeper to full health, giving it another chance to sweep when its counter is most likely weakened.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Blissey is often the most reliable counter to Shaymin-S. She can absorb most of its attacks with ease and either cripple Shaymin-S with Thunder Wave or Toxic, or simply OHKO Shaymin-S with Ice Beam with Stealth Rock support. However, she loses against the SubSeed variant, and she may be 2HKOed by a Modest Choice Specs Seed Flare if Blissey's Special Defense is halved. Specially defensive Skarmory can take Shaymin-S's assaults, except for Hidden Power Fire, and simply Whirlwind Shaymin-S away (causing it to take more damage from Stealth Rock) or OHKO Shaymin-S with Brave Bird with Stealth Rock in play. Although Lugia and Latias risk falling to Air Slash flinches after a Seed Flare Special Defense drop, they can take most of Shaymin-S's assaults and OHKO it with Ice Beam and Dragon Pulse, respectively, after Stealth Rock damage. Lugia can also use Whirlwind to stop Shaymin-S from stalling with Leech Seed.</p> <p>Ho-Oh can switch into any of Shaymin-S's attacks and OHKO with Sacred Fire. Scizor can easily switch into Seed Flare and threaten any Shaymin-S without Hidden Power Fire. Scizor 2HKOs Shaymin-S with Bullet Punch and can U-turn for heavy damage as well as scout possible switch-ins. Choice Band Scizor can even use Pursuit to put Shaymin-S into the KO range of Stealth Rock on its next switch-in (provided that Shaymin-S has already taken Stealth Rock damage.) However, a Choice Specs boosted Air Slash will 2HKO Scizor. Choice Scarf Dialga and Heatran can easily switch into Seed Flare and Air Slash. They can also OHKO Shaymin-S with Fire Blast (or Draco Meteor in Dialga's case). Choice Scarf Jirachi and Metagross resist Seed Flare and Air Slash and can OHKO Shaymin-S with Ice Punch. However, Dialga, Heatran, Metagross, and Jirachi are 2HKOed Earth Power (Heatran is OHKOed). Faster Pokemon like Mewtwo, Deoxys-A and Choice Scarf Garchomp, Palkia, Darkrai, and Kyogre can revenge kill non-Choice Scarf Shaymin-S with Ice Beam or STAB Dragon-type attacks. However, Choice Scarf Mewtwo can outspeed even Choice Scarf Shaymin-S.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>A Choice Scarf enables Shaymin-S to become both a great revenge killer and a decent lead. It's also arguably the best offensive answer to Rock Polish Groudon, as it is immune to Earthquake, and it can outrun most Groudon even after a Rock Polish and OHKO it with its powerful STAB Seed Flare. As a lead, it should try for an Air Slash flinch against Deoxys-A and Deoxys-S leads, which will usually prevent them from setting up entry hazards, and it easily beats Groudon leads who don't invest heavily in Special Defense.</p> <p>Both of Shaymin-S's STABs allow it to get out of many tough situations thanks to Seed Flare's 68% overall Special Defense drop rate, as well as Air Slash's 57% overall flinch rate and neutrality against most Pokemon in the Uber environment. Earth Power 2HKOes most Steel-type switch-ins, though specially defensive Dialga will survive two Earth Powers, usually even after a Special Defense drop. Hidden Power Ice allows Shaymin-S to revenge kill Garchomp, opposing Shaymin-S, and Dragon Dance Rayquaza lacking Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Non-lead Shaymin-S should have a Modest nature to guarantee Seed Flare's OHKO on faster variants of Kyogre with Stealth Rock damage. The only somewhat common Pokemon in Ubers who will outspeed Modest Shaymin-S are Timid Choice Scarf Darkrai, opposing Shaymin-S, and Mewtwo. When used as a lead, Shaymin-S should be Timid so that it can outspeed the aforementioned Darkrai, another common lead.</p> <p>Leaf Storm is an option to use in place of Seed Flare with a Modest nature, which OHKOes both max HP Kyogre and 4 HP / 0 SpD Darkrai after Stealth Rock damage. However, this leaves Shaymin-S vulnerable to Calm Mind users like Latias and Mewtwo, and Leaf Storm lacks the Special Defense lowering effect of Seed Flare. Thus, it should only be used if Shaymin-S's team really needs the KOs that Leaf Storm provides. Don't use Leaf Storm with a Timid nature, as the only benefit to doing so is gaining an OHKO on 4 HP / 0 SpD Kyogre after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Generally, Choice Scarf Shaymin-S's biggest foes resist its STABs or have extremely high special bulk. Scizor and Dialga can heavily dent Shaymin-S with most of their attacks, with Choice Band Scizor dealing at least 53% with Pursuit, which is potentially fatal with Stealth Rock in play, while Dialga can set up on Shaymin-S with Bulk Up. Lugia, opposing Shaymin-S, Rayquaza, Ho-Oh, Latios, and Latias can switch into Seed Flare and Earth Power and either threaten Shaymin-S immediately or set up. The massive defensive stats of Giratina, specially defensive Skarmory, and Blissey allow them to shrug off Shaymin-S's assaults to cripple it in various ways (e.g. status, phazing, PP stalling), as long as Seed Flare doesn't net too many Special Defense drops. Giratina-O is a more offensive check that can pick off a weakened Shaymin-S with Shadow Sneak. Finally, Wobbuffet can easily trap and revenge kill Choice Scarf Shaymin-S with Mirror Coat.</p> <p>In terms of teammates, mixed variants of Dialga, Palkia, and Rayquaza can lure in most of Shaymin-S's defensive checks. For a more threatening approach, Darkrai and Calm Mind Mewtwo can set up on and crush Shaymin-S's checks quite well. Alternatively, Wobbuffet can trap and KO many of Shaymin-S's checks. For Mixed Dialga, it's best to revenge kill it via Pokemon like Garchomp and Lucario. Good defensive partners include Kyogre, Groudon, Jirachi, and Blissey.</p> <p>Something to note about leading with Choice Scarf Shaymin-S is that it often relies on Air Slash's flinch rate to beat other leads such as Darkrai, so having a Sleep Talker waiting in the wings such as Kyogre is advisable. Hidden Power Fire is a viable option on this set to destroy Scizor leads and Forretress or Skarmory switch-ins. However, it requires Shaymin-S to lower its Speed IV to 30, meaning that opposing Choice Scarf Shaymin-S will beat it.</p> <p>There are also several leads that almost always beat Shaymin-S: Choice Scarf Mewtwo outspeeds Shaymin-S and OHKOs with Ice Beam, while 252 HP Kyogre, Dialga, and Tyranitar can survive one of Shaymin-S's attacks and OHKO in retaliation. Scizor leads trouble Shaymin-S that lack Hidden Power Fire, 3HKOing with Bullet Punch. An allied Blissey can easily wall lead Kyogre, Dialga, and Mewtwo, while Groudon can switch into Tyranitar and Scizor and severely damage or OHKO them with Earthquake or a Fire-type attack. Although Draco Meteor will do a huge amount of damage to Groudon, STAB Earthquake will often scare Dialga off as well. While Palkia and Latias can destroy Kyogre, several lead Kyogre carry Thunder Wave to take advantage of these switch-ins. A Dialga of your own can switch into Mewtwo, Kyogre, and Scizor, and threaten them with Draco Meteor, Thunder, and Fire Blast respectively.</p> "

        "name": "SubSeed",
        "description": "<p>The main idea of the SubSeed strategy is to switch into Pokemon who Shaymin-S can scare out, set up Substitute as they switch, and then either attack the next switch-in or use Leech Seed. Substitute is a great scouting tool for both Shaymin-S and partners looking to answer some of its checks. Shaymin-S is the fastest Leech Seed user outside of the sun, and it can pose an offensive threat with its base 120 Special Attack and Seed Flare Special Defense drops. Leech Seeding common switch-ins such as Blissey and Giratina allows Shaymin-S to restore huge amounts of health per turn, even making up for the Substitute HP loss in the former case. Eventually, Blissey will run out of Seismic Toss PP, and Shaymin-S can then pound Blissey with Seed Flare until her battered special bulk can take no more.</p> <p>Seed Flare can cause a lot of switches, due to its high chance of halving the opponent's Special Defense, forcing the opponent's Pokemon to take more damage from entry hazards and Leech Seed. For the last moveslot, Air Slash is generally the best choice due to its flinches wasting Leech Seed turns. Air Slash is also super effective on two other Leech Seeders seen in Ubers, Jumpluff and Ludicolo. However, Air Slash can leave Shaymin-S open to huge threats like Bulk Up Dialga and Scizor, the latter whom has Bullet Punch's priority and U-turn to break Shaymin-S's Substitute and switch out simultaneously. Because of this, Hidden Power Fire is viable to OHKO Scizor and 2HKO Metagross and Skarmory in the sun. Alternatively, Earth Power 3HKOs the standard Bulk Up Dialga, preventing it from Rest stalling Shaymin-S. Earth Power also 2HKOes Metagross and offensive Dialga. Finally, Hidden Power Ice can OHKO Rayquaza, Garchomp, and opposing Shaymin-S; Rayquaza may attempt to set up on Shaymin-S otherwise.</p> <p>Investing in defenses is not beneficial, as Shaymin-S's Substitutes will still be broken from most of the attacks thrown at it. Just maxing out Speed and Special Attack is recommended. This set can use 252 HP EVs to make Shaymin-S's Substitutes unbreakable by Blissey's Seismic Toss, but the power loss is often not worth it.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is particularly crucial to this set's success, punishing the opponent for the many switches that this set causes. Wobbuffet support is also highly recommended, as many players rely on Choice Scarf holders like Palkia, Dialga, and Garchomp to defeat most Shaymin-S sets. Shaymin-S is thus an effective scout for almost all of these Pokemon with Substitute, and in turn allows Wobbuffet to revenge kill them more easily later in the match. Wobbuffet can also help Shaymin-S to find time to set up with Encore. Tickle Wobbuffet in particular can be paired with a Pursuit user, such as Tyranitar or Scizor, to eliminate Lugia.</p> <p>SubSeed Shaymin-S's problems are largely dependent on the last move, as mentioned earlier. In general, though, Ho-Oh, Lugia, Giratina, and Giratina-O can all stall Shaymin-S out. Tyranitar is one of the most reliable counters to Giratina-O, and can use Taunt + Dragon Dance to set up on Lugia, Skarmory, and Giratina. When using Hidden Power Fire, make sure you use Groudon with Shaymin-S, as the sun is required for the KOs on every one of these Pokemon, except of Scizor.</p> "

        "name": "Life Orb",
        "description": "<p>Shaymin-S has great offensive stats to pull off a simple Life Orb set, netting many important OHKOs with its STABs and Earth Power that it cannot normally obtain on Darkrai, Kyogre, Shaymin-S, Heatran, and most Groudon, as well as 2HKOs on Garchomp, Palkia, Rayquaza, Metagross, most Dialga, most Jirachi, and Scizor assuming Stealth Rock damage. A Special Defense drop from Seed Flare can even put Lugia, Latias, Giratina, Giratina-O, and Skarmory within 2HKO range from Air Slash, though in Skarmory's case, the probability is very small. Hidden Power Ice will turn some of these 2HKOs into OHKOs, while Hidden Power Fire easily OHKOs Scizor and 2HKOs Skarmory in the sun.</p> <p>Alternatively, Growth can be used in the last slot, which enables Shaymin-S to net even more KOs that it would otherwise miss, turning 2HKOs on Garchomp, Palkia, and Dialga into OHKOs. In particular, +1 Earth Power OHKOes max HP Dialga 66% of the time after Stealth Rock damage. When using Growth, Leftovers becomes a viable item option, as it lets Shaymin-S survive in battle longer and a Growth boost provides more power than a Life Orb does.</p> <p>The Life Orb recoil compounds Shaymin-S's frailty, sometimes not even getting a chance to KO Scizor before it goes down to Bullet Punch. Scizor is best dealt with using Dialga, Palkia, or Mewtwo lures before attempting to sweep with Shaymin-S. The IVs can be reduced to 29 to reduce Stealth Rock and Life Orb damage by 1, but it will take two turns of Life Orb recoil to make up for the lost HP.</p> <p>There are four particular Choice Scarf holders that outspeed Shaymin-S and resist both Seed Flare and Air Slash; Dialga, Metagross, Jirachi, and Heatran. Wobbuffet and defensive Groudon are helpful against them. Kyogre and Heatran can easily switch into Jirachi's and Metagross's Ice Punches and Heatran's Fire Blast, whilst retaliating with powerful STABs.

Air Slash almost always 2HKOes 252 HP / 168 SpD Careful Scizor, and always 2HKOes Rayquaza, Darkrai, Garchomp, and Palkia after Stealth Rock damage. Earth Power 2HKOes Dialga, Metagross, and Jirachi, while Hidden Power Ice almost always 2HKOes Lugia with a Modest nature. With a Timid nature, it still OHKOes Garchomp and Rayquaza and after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKOes 86 HP / 96 SpD Giratina-O 90% of the time. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire roasts Scizor and Skarmory.</p> <p>Timid is the preferred nature to outspeed Darkrai, but Modest is reasonable if you have Spikes support for the very real possibility of 2HKOing Blissey, Palkia, and Rayquaza, and OHKOing Garchomp and Mewtwo with Seed Flare.</p> <p>The few Pokemon who can take Choice Specs Shaymin-S's Seed Flares are generally Shaymin-S's biggest threats. These include Blissey, Skarmory, Latias, Lugia, Choice Scarf Dialga, Heatran, opposing Shaymin-S, and Scizor, all of whom can immediately retaliate against Shaymin-S. Rayquaza is another check, though it will lose if Seed Flare gets a Special Defense drop. If running Modest, it is wise to have a Sleep Talker like Kyogre to deal with Darkrai. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Heracross can switch into most of Darkrai's moves and can OHKO with its STABs. Choice Scarf Dialga, Palkia, and Mewtwo are all excellent revenge killers of Darkrai.</p> "
