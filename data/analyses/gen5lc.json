  "Bulbasaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite its poor attacking movepool, Bulbasaur can make for an effective revenge killer with its good Special Attack and just enough Speed to outpace all unboosted Pokemon when carrying a Choice Scarf. It seems as if it would make a good support Pokemon as well, but sadly it is outclassed by Foongus in that position. Luckily, Bulbasaur has its small niche, and can be used on a team to help deal with fast sweepers.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Bulbasaur has quite a few other moves that could be considered, but most are inferior to the moveset listed in the analysis. Substitute could work with Leech Seed to drain health, though Cottonee and Snover do that much better. Toxic or Stun Spore could work as a second status option alongside Sleep Powder, but that would require a dedicated support set--something better left for Foongus. On a support set, Knock Off is an option to remove an important item such as Eviolite, and Synthesis can provide a healing option for Bulbasaur. If Bulbasaur is running Toxic, then Venoshock could be used as a powerful attacking option as well.</p> <p>Bulbasaur can use a few moves to set up as well. Growth can raise its Attack and Special Attack; however, Bulbasaur rarely has the time to set up with it. Swords Dance is similar, and Curse could be used on a bulkier set, though it would have major problems with Snover and Fire-types. Power Whip, Nature Power, and Return are physical attacking options to consider if using an Attack-boosting move. Giga Drain can heal and work as a reliable STAB move, making it a viable option. Petal Dance is much stronger, but being locked into it can be quite dangerous due to the many Pokemon that resist Grass-type moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best way to handle Bulbasaur is to switch in on a resisted move once a team member has been put to sleep, activating Sleep Clause. Gastly resists every move Bulbasaur can use other than a random Hidden Power, making it a very good check. Stunky works the same way, as only the rare move Nature Power presents a problem to it while switching in. Faster Choice Scarf users such as Darumaka work as checks as well, as long as they carry a super effective move to hit Bulbasaur with. Fire-types such as Ponyta and Houndour work if they avoid Sludge Bomb, and can either set up or attack the switch-in, respectively. Finally, Dratini resists Leaf Storm and Hidden Power Fire, and Shed Skin can wake Dratini up early if it switches into Sleep Powder.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Bulbasaur reaches 21 Speed and 17 Special Attack with a Choice Scarf and a Modest nature, making it an effective revenge killer. Sleep Powder is a nice move to have, allowing Bulbasaur to quickly put something to sleep, though it requires Bulbasaur to switch out after use. Leaf Storm is the most powerful move Bulbasaur gets, but it does lower Bulbasaur's Special Attack, making Bulbasaur more vulnerable after each successive use. Sludge Bomb is much weaker, but it is a more reliable STAB move that hits many Pokemon that resist Grass hard. Hidden Power Fire is the final move, hitting Steel-types and Dry Skin Croagunk super effectively.</p> <p>Timid is an option, allowing Bulbasaur to outrun Pokemon sitting right at 21 Speed, which is a common benchmark for Choice Scarf users to aim for. The loss in power is undesirable, however. Steel-types can switch in on any move other than Hidden Power Fire, making them good checks. For this reason, Magnemite and Diglett are good partners as they can trap and KO most Steel-types, allowing Bulbasaur to use its STAB attacks more safely. Gastly switches in easily to every move Bulbasaur can use other than Sleep Powder. Pawniard and Munchlax can trap Gastly with Pursuit, making them good teammates for Bulbasaur as well. Faster Pokemon with set-up moves to boost Speed are also issues. These include Mantyke, Shellder, Clamperl, and any Houndour and Ponyta that use Flame Charge. Chinchou is therefore a good teammate, dealing with Mantyke, Houndour, and Ponyta nicely. Ferroseed can work well against Shellder and Clamperl, making it a useful teammate as well. Lastly, a priority user such as Timburr can be used as a backup revenge killer for faster Pokemon.</p> "

  "Charmander": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite appearances, Charmander is quite flawed in Little Cup, with lower attacking stats than more frequently used Fire-types such as Ponyta and Houndour. Being a Fire-type in itself hurts as well, as this means that Charmander is weak to Stealth Rock as well as common Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type moves. However, Charmander has a few things that differentiate itself from other Fire-types. Dragon Dance is the main move that sets Charmander apart, as no other Fire-type receives the move. Charmander also has a much wider physical movepool than other Fire-types, giving it ways to deal with the many Pokemon that resist Fire-type attacks. Overall, Charmander ends up as a usable but not great Pokemon in Little Cup, and can be considered for your team if you want to be a little different.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Charmander has a multitude of other options to consider, which can make it quite unpredictable. Crunch could be used to hit Frillish quite hard but Thunder Punch is just slightly weaker against it and has better overall coverage. Dragon Claw could be used to hit Dratini super effectively as well as for neutral coverage with Flare Blitz, but because Flare Blitz is already so powerful, Charmander would be better off aiming for as much super effective coverage as possible. Dig is a gimmicky move to hit Chinchou with and it is much too easily countered to be an option. Fire Punch is a recoil-free physical Fire-type move, but it is not worth a look as it's much weaker than the powerful Flare Blitz. Swords Dance could be used to boost Charmander's Attack quicker, but Dragon Dance's Speed boosts make Swords Dance inferior. Belly Drum could even be used to skyrocket Charmander's Attack stat, but it is much too risky with all of the priority moves around. Flame Charge could be used to boost Speed, but with Dragon Dance there already there's little point.</p> <p>Charmander's special movepool consists of various Fire-type moves, Dragon Pulse, Ancient Power, and Hidden Power, which is far inferior to its physical movepool. Dragon Pulse and Ancient Power would be the only reasons to use it over Houndour, which isn't nearly enough to be worth it. Hone Claws could be used on a gimmicky set with Inferno and Dynamic Punch, which, with some luck, could give opponents major problems. Substitute and Focus Punch could be used together to an interesting effect as well, but losing HP from Substitute as well as Flare Blitz would probably be too much for Charmander to handle. Will-O-Wisp is an option to burn a switch-in, but bulkier Pokemon would be better suited for the role. Counter could get a surprise KO on something, which is always nice, although Charmander would have trouble doing anything afterward. Lastly, Toxic could help chip away at the HP of bulky Water- and Ground-types that usually switch into Charmander.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Wooper and Chinchou resist Flare Blitz and Thunder Punch, and take pitiful damage from Charmander's other coverage options, making them good checks. Dratini works well if Charmander lacks Dragon Claw, which is uncommon anyway. Ponyta and Darumaka can work if Charmander is not carrying Rock Slide, while Munchlax is good against all sets lacking Brick Break. Each can deal heavy damage to Charmander or just force it out. Hippopotas can take a Flare Blitz and hit back with Earthquake, and can put down Stealth Rock to wear Charmander down on repeated switches very quickly. If Charmander is attempting to sweep, Timburr can stop that with its priority moves.</p> ",

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance is Charmander's best move for setting up a sweep, which makes it an obvious choice to base a moveset around. Flare Blitz is Charmander's main attacking move, being its most powerful STAB move by far. Thunder Punch complements Flare Blitz quite well, doing a good amount of damage to most Water-types. In the last slot, two options can be considered. Brick Break is the main option, as it pummels Flash Fire Houndour and Thick Fat Munchlax, two Pokemon that this set can otherwise have problems with. Rock Slide is a viable alternative, however, as it still hits Houndour as well as other Fire-types; keep in mind that it has similar power but lower accuracy, meaning it falls just short of the reliability that Brick Break provides.</p> <p>A 21 IV in HP is used to lower Charmander's HP to 19, which in turn lowers Life Orb recoil. As for potential threats, Chinchou and Wooper resist Flare Blitz and are immune to Thunder Punch, making them major problems to this set. Dratini can set up Dragon Dances on Charmander as it resists Flare Blitz. It also has Extreme Speed to revenge kill it if needed. Snover is a good teammate for Charmander, as it can deal serious damage to all three aforementioned Pokemon. Ferroseed can also be used if the residual damage from hail is unwanted. Ponyta and Darumaka work well against Charmander that choose not to use Rock Slide, so Wooper can be a good teammate for checking them. In addition, Wooper attracts Grass-types that Charmander can set up on, providing good synergy. Munchlax can deal with Charmander sets lacking Brick Break, as Thick Fat provides a useful resistance to Fire-type moves. Timburr works well against Munchlax, making it a good teammate. Timburr itself also causes problems to Charmander with its priority moves, and Duskull can be a good switch-in to it.</p> "

Lastly, Rock Slide is a good option to hit opposing Fire-types. These four moves combine for great coverage, allowing Charmander to revenge kill a myriad of threats.</p> <p>Due to this Charmander's relative lack of power compared to the Dragon Dance set, bulky Pokemon such as Hippopotas and Wooper are problems.

  "Squirtle": {
    "overview": "<p>Squirtle comes into the fifth generation as a Pokemon that has been mostly left behind, being overshadowed by the many other Water-types in Little Cup. However, not all is bad for Squirtle, as it does have a few niches to fill. It is one of two Pokemon in the tier that has access to Fake Out and Aqua Jet, making it a good priority user. The only other Pokemon that has access to these two moves, Seel, has a much smaller movepool to work with, meaning Squirtle does this a bit better. Squirtle also learns Rapid Spin, and can take hits on both sides, unlike other Water-types who learn Rapid Spin, such as Tentacool and Shellder. Lastly, Squirtle is one of only a few Pokemon to learn Water Spout, and unlike Frillish, it is not weak to Pursuit. As long as you take advantage of what it has over other Water-types, Squirtle can be a useful member of a Little Cup team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Squirtle has a few other options to consider. Scald is an alternative STAB move and has a useful burn chance if not being used alongside another status move. Bite is a physical option, but it would only KO weakened Frillish switching in to absorb Squirtle's Water-type attacks. Zen Headbutt is an OHKO on Croagunk and hits Fighting-types harder than any other physical move that Squirtle has, making it a viable option as well.</p> <p>Squirtle has quite a few support options to consider as well. RestTalk limits Squirtle's move options but is the only option for reliable healing, making it usable. Counter and Mirror Coat could get a surprise KO, but Squirtle can't easily heal off the damage taken by doing so. Haze could work to get rid of stat changes, which could be used to stop something such as Dratini from trying to set up on the support set. Lastly, Squirtle can set up Rain Dance, and works well alongside a teammate such as Omanyte which can take advantage of the rain.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ferroseed easily takes on any Squirtle set lacking Hidden Power Fire or Brick Break, being able to either hit hard with Bullet Seed or just set up entry hazards. Iron Barbs means that Squirtle takes damage when trying to Rapid Spin the hazards away as well, making them useful. Chinchou only fears Hidden Power Grass, setting up an Agility easily and having the possibility to sweep Squirtle's team. Croagunk can take everything but the rare Zen Headbutt thanks to Dry Skin, and can set up as well with an immunity to Toxic. Frillish can burn the priority set easily, while it can come into a predicted Water Spout or Hydro Pump on the Choice Scarf set to heal itself. Clamperl and Shellder have Shell Smash, and can easily set one up if not faced with Hidden Power Grass, allowing them to begin a sweep. Snover beats sets without Brick Break or Hidden Power Fire easily.</p> ",

        "name": "Priority User",
        "description": "<p>Squirtle reaches a respectable 15 Attack, which is enough to make use of its priority on less bulky Pokemon trying to sweep. Fake Out is free damage when Squirtle comes in after a KO, making it a great asset. Aqua Jet isn't free, but is a priority move that gets STAB and can be used at any time, so it is a staple of this set as well. If a more powerful move is needed, or if the opposing Pokemon is slower than Squirtle's 13 Speed, Waterfall is a more powerful STAB move to use. In the last slot, Brick Break is usually desired for a super effective hit on Ferroseed, which has a resistance to Water-type moves. Ice Punch, however, hits other Grass- and Dragon-types, though these are much less common than the targets Brick Break hits, making it a lesser option.</p> <p>An IV of 0 is best for the HP stat, as Squirtle can get down to 19 HP, therefore taking the minimum amount of damage from Life Orb. Due to the lowered HP, Squirtle invests in Speed instead of defenses, which can help against slower Pokemon trying to set up. This allows it to use the more powerful Waterfall against more opponents, which makes a difference in some situations.</p> <p>Despite the priority, multiple Pokemon can still sweep through Squirtle. Chinchou, Clamperl, and Shellder can all survive Fake Out quite easily and resist Aqua Jet, meaning they can keep going despite Squirtle getting some free damage. Ferroseed can be a good teammate for Squirtle, as it is able to stop these Pokemon if they lack Hidden Power Fire. If Clamperl and Shellder decide against using Hidden Power Grass, a Chinchou of your own can stop them as well. Munchlax is a more reliable stop to Chinchou, as it can easily tank its special moves with high HP and Special Defense. Dragon Dance Dratini can also go through this set for similar reasons, and the aforementioned Ferroseed can switch in on Outrage and handle it. Snover is another Pokemon that wins if Squirtle lacks Brick Break, as it can use a multitude of Grass-type moves to overwhelm the turtle. Timburr with Mach Punch is a good teammate for Squirtle, as it can deal massive damage to Snover.</p> "

Surf lets Squirtle do decent damage with its high Base Power, and is used over Scald since Scald's burn chance would clash with Toxic and Yawn's effects, making the burns undesirable. Rapid Spin is one of Squirtle's best assets, as certain Pokemon work much more effectively without entry hazards. In the third slot, Toxic is the more desired option to hit other Water-types, which are common switch-ins to Squirtle. Another option is Yawn, which can work as a phazing or sleep-inducing move, depending on the opponent's reaction to it. In the last slot, Hidden Power Fire is used to get a super effective hit on Ferroseed, which easily handles every move on the moveset other than a possible Yawn.</p> <p>Due to the support that Rapid Spin provides, Squirtle pairs well with Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock. Houndour is one common example, as it survives much more easily without entry hazards taking their toll on its HP. Cyndaquil and Archen are used less often, but require being at high HP to be effective, meaning that they can benefit greatly from Squirtle's presence. Ghost-types can block Rapid Spin, meaning having a Pursuit user to KO them is a great help. Stunky is a good example of a Pursuit user, and it deals very well with the most common Ghost-type, Gastly.

In many situations this means it can use Water Spout before being attacked, resulting in an incredibly powerful hit. Hydro Pump becomes the better option when at 16 HP or lower due to Water Spout getting weakened, making it an important second move. Later on, Torrent can kick in, making Hydro Pump even more powerful than Water Spout is at full health, though being at high HP for reliability is better. Ice Beam hits Pokemon such as Cottonee and Dratini, making it a useful third option. There are two options for the last slot, both for hitting Pokemon that can take the first three moves. Hidden Power Grass is preferred for hitting the many Water-types in the tier, but Hidden Power Fire is viable to hit Ferroseed and Croagunk--which takes double damage from Fire due to Dry Skin--super effectively.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is extremely important for this set, as Squirtle works best when at full HP. Tentacool and Baltoy are examples of Rapid Spin users that pair well with Squirtle. Natu is another choice which can use Magic Bounce to help keep hazards off the field. Frillish can come in on Water Spout or Hydro Pump thanks to Water Absorb, making it a major issue to deal with. Chinchou shares a Grass-type weakness with Squirtle, but checks Frillish nicely, making it a useful option. Houndour can help with Grass-types as well, especially the common Ferroseed.

U-turn leads such as Meowth and Aipom can be problematic. Both Fake Out and U-turn can deal a lot of damage to Chikorita, and this really wears it down. Lead Houndour is a good counter to Chikorita as it is faster and easily OHKOes with Overheat.

Its Grass typing in tandem with Aromatherapy allows Chikorita to wall and defeat common offensive and defensive threats, namely Slowpoke, Staryu, Chinchou, Diglett, Drilbur, and Hippopotas. It can also spread status in the form of Toxic, which is beneficial for teams with a plethora of Fake Out and Protect users.</p> <p>Chikorita does have trouble with some Pokemon, however. Almost any Steel-type walls and sets up on Chikorita; Bronzor can set up Stealth Rock, Pawniard can set up Swords Dance, and Magnemite can set up Substitute. Ferroseed is especially tricky for Chikorita, as its Grass typing means Giga Drain will do abysmal damage. For this reason, using Hidden Power Fire instead of Toxic is an option if your team has trouble with Steel-types.

Steel- and Dragon-type set-up sweepers such as Dratini also benefit from having Chikorita on their team, as Dragon-types can switch in on Fire-type attacks directed at Chikorita, while Steel-types can switch into Ice-type attacks.

    "overview": "<p>Totodile is certainly an underrated threat in the Little Cup metagame. In addition to a high Attack stat, it also has access to both Dragon Dance and Swords Dance, which make it a great physical sweeper. Totodile has a decent movepool, highlighted by the likes of Waterfall, Aqua Jet, Ice Punch, and Return. Unfortunately, Totodile's defenses are horrendous, and it is easily taken down by any move it doesn't resist. All in all, Totodile is a very dangerous offensive threat, especially if it is given a chance to set up.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Totodile's poor defensive stats mean it should generally stick to offensive sets. It can utilize a Choice Band for immediate power, but the listed sets are much more effective. Rain Dance can boost Aqua Jet, but Totodile is too frail to set it up reliably. Eviolite can fix Totodile's terrible defenses to an extent, but it still won't be able to take many hits. A specially based Life Orb set is viable as Totodile has access to moves such as Hydro Pump, Surf, Ice Beam, and Hidden Power Electric, but other Water-types, such as Chinchou, can run the set more effectively as they have a higher Special Attack stat. Toxic can be used to cripple walls, but Totodile cannot dream of Toxic stalling its opponents. A Counter + Focus Sash set can take down physical attackers, but it can only be used once, and needs Rapid Spin support to be effective.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Totodile is not very hard to counter, mainly because it possesses horrible defenses and does not have the best defensive typing for the LC metagame. Ferroseed is arguably the best counter to Totodile; it resists Totodile's STAB moves and can OHKO Totodile with Bullet Seed, or simply stall out Totodile with a combination of Leech Seed and Protect. Mantyke can take a hit from Totodile and KO it with Hidden Power Flying or Hidden Power Electric. Chinchou can handle Totodile very well, even though it takes a lot of damage from +2 Return. Choice Scarf Chinchou can outspeed even +1 Totodile, resists Aqua Jet, and can OHKO Totodile with STAB Thunderbolt. Thanks to its ability Dry Skin, Croagunk is an excellent switch-in to Totodile. Croagunk can quickly eliminate Totodile with a combination of Fake Out and either Vacuum Wave or Sucker Punch, KOing it before it gets a chance to move. Choice Scarf Snover can switch into Totodile's STAB moves and KO it with Giga Drain, thus healing most of the damage it might have taken from Totodile. Both Eviolite and Choice Scarf Mienfoo can take a +2 Aqua Jet and OHKO Totodile with High Jump Kick. Choice Scarf Electric-types can outspeed Totodile and OHKO it with a STAB move, but they generally aren't good switch-ins to Totodile. Priority moves often easily take Totodile out due to its low defenses. Omanyte can take any resisted hit Totodile throws at it, even if it is at +2, and can OHKO Totodile with Hidden Power Rock. It should be noted that Omanyte can survive one Waterfall.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Totodile has all the tools required to pull off a sweep: good Attack, decent Speed, and access to a boosting move in Dragon Dance. After just one Dragon Dance, Totodile reaches 21 Speed and outspeeds every non-boosted Pokemon in the LC metagame. Dragon Dance also increases Totodile's damage output considerably. Waterfall is Totodile's best STAB move as it is both powerful and accurate. It has a 20% flinch chance as well, which can prove game-changing. Ice Punch is essential as it hits Grass-type Pokemon, such as Shroomish or Lileep, who would otherwise wall Totodile; it is also Totodile's strongest option against Ferroseed. Crunch hits Ghost-types, mainly Misdreavus and Frillish, who can threaten Totodile with Will-O-Wisp or a STAB Shadow Ball. Alternatively, Rock Slide can be used to hit Shelmet, Mantyke, and other bulky Flying-type Pokemon for super effective damage.</p> <p>The given nature and EV spread maximizes Totodile's Attack stat, and also enables it to hit 21 Speed after a Dragon Dance. Life Orb helps Totodile a lot by giving it extra power, but also reduces its longevity; therefore, a Lum Berry can be used to cure Totodile of any debilitating status and let it set up more easily. However, note that Life Orb recoil can help activate Torrent, and not many Pokemon will appreciate taking a Dragon Dance-, STAB-, and Torrent-boosted Waterfall. Totodile can utilize coverage moves such as Aerial Ace and Brick Break; the former OHKOes Croagunk, while the latter hits Steel-types--mainly Ferroseed--for super effective damage. Aqua Tail is a more powerful but less accurate STAB move that can be used over Waterfall to OHKO Mienfoo and Misdreavus at +2.</p> <p>Entry hazards are essential if you plan to pull off a sweep with Totodile; Choice Scarf Misdreavus and Magnemite are OHKOed by Aqua Jet at +2 after a Stealth Rock switch in. In addition to providing both Spikes and Stealth Rock support, Ferroseed resists the Electric- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Totodile. Totodile is extremely frail; therefore, dual screen support can help it better tank priority moves. Bronzor provides both Stealth Rock and dual screen support and resists Grass-type attacks. Totodile can be quickly worn down by Life Orb recoil, which means that Wish support is always helpful. Natu can provide Wish support, and can also bounce back Stealth Rock and Spikes. If Totodile isn't carrying a Lum Berry, cleric support from Misdreavus and Chinchou is very useful as it enables Totodile to sweep with greater ease. Lastly, as Totodile is affected by all forms of entry hazards, Rapid Spin users make good teammates. Drilbur and Staryu are two very effective spinners, but beware as both share weaknesses with Totodile.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This set is a more offensive one; its main goal is to set up Swords Dance and plow through the opposing team. With just one Swords Dance, Totodile's Attack stat reaches an immense 34, which enables it to hit very hard. Aqua Jet is a STAB priority move that allows Totodile to hit faster Pokemon such as Mienfoo and hopefully KO them. Ice Punch's targets are mainly Grass- and Dragon-types, such as Shroomish and Dratini, who resist Totodile's STAB moves, as well as Ferroseed, who is hit for neutral damage. Crunch hits Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Frillish, both of whom can cripple Totodile with Will-O-Wisp. Waterfall is a stronger STAB move that can be used alongside Aqua Jet to KO slower but bulkier Pokemon, such as Porygon and Omanyte. Waterfall also has a nifty chance to flinch the opponent's Pokemon, but this will not usually be of any use due to Totodile's low Speed stat.</p> <p>The EV spread is simple: maximize Attack and Speed to boost Totodile's overall offensive prowess. In particular, an Adamant nature allows Totodile to OHKO Mienfoo with +2 Ice Punch. A Jolly nature isn't necessary as Aqua Jet bypasses Totodile's low Speed. As this set needs all the power it can get, Life Orb is the preferred item. Life Orb recoil also helps activate Torrent, which enables Totodile's Aqua Jet to take out just about anything that doesn't resist it. A Lum Berry is viable to heal Totodile of burn or paralysis, both of which completely cripple it. Aerial Ace can be used over Ice Punch to hit Croagunk, whom Totodile loses to most of the time. Protect prevents Fake Out from Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Croagunk, and the like, while Substitute blocks status and is a good scouting move in general. Superpower and Brick Break are alternatives over Ice Punch; both KO Ferroseed at +2.</p> <p>This set requires a lot of support in order to pull off a sweep. Entry hazard support is vital as they help Totodile nab several important KOs. Ferroseed and Dwebble can provide both Spikes and Stealth Rock support; the former also has good defensive synergy with Totodile. As Totodile is quite slow and frail, it appreciates dual screens support; Bronzor can provide this, as well as set up Stealth Rock. As both paralysis and burn completely cripple Totodile, cleric support from the likes of Chinchou and Misdreavus is very useful. Life Orb and entry hazards wear Totodile down very quickly, and make Wish support almost a necessity. Natu can set up Wish and also bounce back entry hazards and status moves with Magic Bounce. Finally, Rapid Spin support provided by Staryu and Drilbur can prevent Totodile from taking damage upon every switch-in.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>While Cleffa is a weak Pokemon with low stats, not everything is terrible for it. It has an extremely wide movepool that makes it incredibly unpredictable, so it can catch something off-guard if played correctly. Cleffa also has an incredible ability in Magic Guard, which means weather and entry hazards are no problem. Despite the positives, Cleffa still isn't a very good Pokemon, as its stats are too low to do anything very effectively.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Cleffa has many other options to consider using. Psychic could hit Fighting-types and Gastly. Shadow Ball is good for Ghost- and Psychic-types which can cause Cleffa problems. Magical Leaf and Shock Wave are somewhat weak, but they can hit Water-types super effectively. Psyshock is Cleffa's best special option against Munchlax, but isn't great against many other Pokemon. Signal Beam can hit Dark- and Psychic-types at the same time, which could come in handy. Flamethrower and Fire Blast are usable to hit Steel-types. Fake Tears could force a switch, though it's unlikely that Cleffa would survive to actually threaten something with it. Work Up is there if Cleffa wants to try to set up, but it rarely has the time to do so. Cleffa actually learns Belly Drum, but it's just too weak to use it effectively. Its physical movepool includes Return, Zen Headbutt, Dig, and Iron Tail, none of which really do enough damage without a boost.</p> <p>Cleffa learns Soft-Boiled for instant healing, but it is sadly illegal with Cleffa's biggest selling point, Magic Guard. Aromatherapy would be great, but it's illegal with Wish or Soft-Boiled so it's better left off. Charm could weaken a physical attacker, but it's unlikely that Cleffa could survive even with the move. Sing has terrible accuracy, but a sleep-inducing move is always helpful. Sweet Kiss could cause some problems, but relies too much on luck to be worthwhile. Finally, Safeguard is another option for team support to consider.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gastly, Duskull, and Frillish are immune to Endeavor, so they counter that set. Sets without Endeavor have a completely separate pool of counters. Riolu, Timburr, and Mienfoo can take a hit, outspeed, and heal up while KOing with Drain Punch. Stunky walls most Cleffa, as it is immune to Toxic and Psychic. Dratini has Shed Skin, so it can usually set up on Cleffa safely. Pawniard with Brick Break can destroy any set with Reflect or Light Screen and will stop Cleffa from supporting its teammates.</p> ",

Cleffa should normally switch in after a KO on something that can usually KO it as well, and use Endeavor on the opposing threat to take it down to 1 HP. With Snover support for hail, Cleffa can usually manage to KO a Pokemon before fainting. Protect scouts for surprising moves that could break Cleffa's Focus Sash such as a random Fake Out. Encore can stop something from trying to set up on Cleffa, which is otherwise easy if Cleffa is at full HP. In the last slot, Thunder Wave or Toxic can be used to do something to Pokemon that are immune to either Endeavor or Hail, such as Gastly, Frillish, and Snover.</p> <p>The only EVs required on this Cleffa are Speed, which makes Cleffa as fast as possible. Any other EVs would be either wasted or counterproductive, as Cleffa has no attacking moves and would like to be at low defensive stats. Snover support for hail is required with this set, as it can deal the finishing blow to most Pokemon that are hit by Endeavor. Hippopotas could be used for the sand, but many more threats are immune to it. Priority from the likes of Timburr is nice, as it can KO opponents such as other Snover that are immune to hail. Stunky could help with the odd Solosis, which also carries Magic Guard. Dwebble, Ferroseed, and Shellder are all problems for Cleffa, as they commonly use moves that hit multiple times to break Cleffa's Focus Sash.</p> "

Using moves to lower the opponent's Speed such as Thunder Wave makes Snubbull a decent sweeper, as its raw power combined with the ability to strike first makes it hard to check. On the offensive, Snubbull has an excellent physical movepool, which means it can sweep effectively once its checks and counters have been dealt with. All-in-all, Snubbull is not to be taken lightly.</p> ",

Last Resort is an extremely powerful move with STAB, and Snubbull can use it alongside Thunder Wave or Protect. A Choice Band set with Return, Crunch, Close Combat, and a filler move can be used to mild success as long as the opponent's Fighting-type Pokemon are removed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Really any Fighting-type is a good check.

Wynaut can come in on Close Combat or Bulk Up and beat Snubbull with an assortment of moves.

This allows Snubbull to easily outpace anything in Little Cup, barring fast Pokemon such as Taillow and Ponyta at +3 Speed. Snubbull is best used on a paralysis team with teammates such as Ferroseed and Slowpoke to spread status. Because of this, Snubbull might not need to use Thunder Wave itself and can instead have Bulk Up to raise its Attack and Defense before it sweeps.</p> <p>Return is Snubbull's best attacking move; after STAB, it sits at 153 Base Power and has 100% accuracy. It also has good coverage in LC, only missing out on Ferroseed, Lileep, Gastly, Frillish, and very uncommon Pokemon. Crunch complements its coverage by hitting Ghost-type Pokemon that are immune to Return. Lastly, Snubbull is faced with the choice of Close Combat or Brick Break. The former works best with Thunder Wave, as it can KO Lileep and Ferroseed, while the latter is beneficial with Bulk Up, as it keeps Snubbull's defenses neutral and can even break through Reflect and Light Screen.</p> <p>Snubbull's hold item, nature, and EV spread maintain a good balance of both offense and bulk with a bit of Speed. If you wish to sacrifice Speed EVs to add to Snubbull's bulk, feel free. The Fairy Pokemon has access to the elemental punches, but none of them hit any harder than Snubbull's other moves. It gets Wild Charge to hit Slowpoke and Frillish harder, but it's not worth the recoil. Earthquake might prove useful against Poison-types. Snubbull's special movepool is almost as good as its physical movepool, but unfortunately it doesn't have the stat to back it up.</p> <p>Good teammates for any sweeper are Pokemon that can eliminate its counters. Mienfoo causes trouble for Snubbull, so Gastly is a good teammate to beat it. Magnemite is another problem; as it cannot get paralyzed, Mienfoo is ironically not only one of Snubbull's best checks, but greatest teammates. It can beat Magnemite and lure Ghost-types for Snubbull to set up on or OHKO. Stealth Rock and Spikes are useful for Snubbull to beat Ferroseed, Lileep, and Pawniard.</p> "

Facade used with Toxic Orb and Guts is an interesting option to hit opponents neutrally, but many others outclass Tyrogue in this regard.

A set of Swords Dance, Flame Charge, Return, and Baton Pass could be used as a bit of a hybrid between a sweeper and a Baton Passer, and works well alongside teammates such as Mienfoo that enjoy both boosts.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Pokemon with phazing moves such as Hippopotas are the biggest obstacles standing in Torchic's way, and will prevent it from passing boosts if Natu isn't used as a teammate. Water-types that aren't weak to Grass, such as Mantyke and Tentacool, wall Torchic, but they won't stop it from passing boosts around. Drilbur outspeeds Torchic even after an Agility if sandstorm is up, and it will KO Torchic easily. Cottonee can't take a Fire Blast, but if it predicts correctly, it can come in on Agility and Encore it, basically rendering Torchic useless.</p> ",

Agility is usually the most useful move to pass as well, as even slow Pokemon will end up outspeeding most threats with the boost to their Speed. Fire Blast hits quite hard and provides Torchic with a form of offense. Hidden Power Grass is used in the fourth slot to deal solid damage to Water-types such as Chinchou, but if extra protection is desired, Substitute can be used in its place.</p> <p>The listed IVs allow Torchic to reach 19 HP while still obtaining a full power Hidden Power Grass, which means that Torchic only takes 1 HP of recoil per attack. If a bulkier spread is desired, 156 HP / 36 Def / 40 SpA / 36 SpD / 236 Spe with a Timid nature with Eviolite is viable. The main use for a bulkier set would be for allowing Torchic to pass its boosts multiple times, which can be devastating to an opposing team. If using that EV spread, don't lower Torchic's HP IV, as Life Orb recoil is not an issue. Substitute is also the superior option there, as Hidden Power Grass doesn't hit hard enough without investment. Fire Blast won't hit quite as hard with those EVs, but it will still deal solid damage to many foes. Swords Dance, Hone Claws, and Curse can also be Baton Passed if desired, but these moves are more situational.</p> <p>Strong attackers that could use a boost to their Speed are great partners for this set. Cubone and Pawniard are good physical attackers, while Abra, Gastly, and Magnemite work well as special attackers. Baton Passers that are useful for a chain include Deerling, Buizel, and Mienfoo.</p> "

Body Slam can also be used, although the loss in power is usually a greater issue than the paralysis chance is worth, especially considering that, if Trick Room is still up, paralyzing an opponent can make them even more threatening, rather than cripple them. Support options are also generally far less useful than all-out attacking moves, but Azurill does have access to Sing, Charm, and Tickle, all of which can be used in gimmick sets if necessary.

Powerful priority hitters such as Houndour and Timburr can do a great deal of Azurill before it can even land a hit, thanks to Azurill's frailty.

Return is the primary STAB option, possessing enough power to knock out a huge portion of the metagame in one or two hits. Double-Edge can also be used for the boost in power, yet the recoil ensures Azurill will fall to nearly any reasonably strong priority move. Waterfall is used as a coverage option, allowing Azurill to hit Pokemon such as Duskull or Gastly for neutral damage. Encore allows Azurill to catch Pokemon such as Ferroseed, which might try to set up on it, giving Azurill either a free attack or a free switch. Toxic can be used as well in the third slot to cripple Frillish, which otherwise walls Azurill entirely. Substitute works to take advantage of the free turn offered by Encore, as most Pokemon cannot take two hits from Azurill and live to tell the tale. Because using up Trick Room turns on non-attacking moves can be largely a waste, Azurill may be better off just spamming attacks rather than predicting switches to use moves such as Toxic or Encore. Using Hidden Power Fire over either Encore or Toxic is a viable option, as it can ensure a 2HKO on Ferroseed if Azurill is behind a substitute.</p> <p>The EV spread for this set seeks to take advantage of the free EVs Azurill has access to, thanks to the fact it needs no investment in Speed. A Brave nature, in conjunction with the lack of investment in Speed, ensures Azurill will be outspeeding nearly every other Pokemon in Little Cup, even Slowpoke and Ferroseed. The rest of the EVs are put into Azurill's defenses, as without any investment, Azurill will go down to priority far too quickly.</p> <p>Two of the major counters to Azurill are Ferroseed and Frillish, as they resist Azurill's entire movepool and can set up for free on it. For this reason, running Misdreavus alongside Azurill is a good option, as it can reliably take out both of those threats with relative ease. Also, in order to function at all, Azurill must be run alongside a Pokemon capable of setting up Trick Room, such as Slowpoke or Bronzor. Another support option is Rain Dance, which can be set up by both Slowpoke and Bronzor as well. Under Rain Dance, Azurill becomes an even more fearsome foe with its boosted Waterfall, and can only reliably be walled by Pokemon with Water-type immunities, such as Frillish, which can be crippled by Toxic or used to set up on by Vullaby. Packing a Pokemon capable of setting up entry hazards is also very important when using Azurill, as the added residual damage from a few layers of Spikes or Stealth Rock can be vital in achieving key KOs. For this reason, Ferroseed, and Dwebble all make great teammates for Azurill. Also, Knock Off Tentacool can be a great partner for Azurill, as very little can take repeated hits from Azurill without Eviolite.</p> "

Shadow Sneak is also an option in the fourth moveslot to help Duskull deal good damage to frail attackers such as Gastly. In the same vein, Hidden Power Fighting allows Duskull to do an acceptable amount of damage to Pokemon such as Lickitung, which would otherwise wall it.

Heat Wave and Hidden Power Ground can be used to do some damage to troublesome Pokemon, including Bronzor, Ferroseed, and Magnemite, but Starly's Special Attack stat is too low for them to be viable. Starly can abuse Roost, but its defenses let it be KOed rather easily. Starly could also use a Life Orb or Choice Band set, but it lacks the Speed to do so effectively. Revenge is another option, but in this metagame, priority attacks are in abundance, making it useless. Finally, Starly can use Toxic if it is being walled by the likes of Slowpoke, or Feather Dance to lower the power of Ferroseed's Gyro Ball, as this will reduce their walling capabilities.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bronzor resists both of Starly's STAB attacks, while U-turn or Pursuit won't be doing much damage, either. Most Steel-types, in general, also fare very well against Starly, since they resist both Flying- and Normal-type attacks. In addition, most Choice Scarf users that can outspeed Starly usually pack a super effective attack and can KO with said move. Choice Scarf Gastly outspeeds and OHKOs Starly with a STAB Sludge Bomb or Thunderbolt. Magnemite resists all of Starly's attacks and it destroys Starly with STAB Thunderbolt. Also, Slowpoke's defense is too high for any of Starly's attacks to do much damage, and it can easily stall out Starly's STAB attacks by recovering with Slack Off.</p> ",

Pokemon that can beat Bronzor, such as Ponyta and Houndour, are also good partners for Starly.

SubSeed is another alternative, but Cottonee and Ferroseed are far superior options in this role, and that move combination is illegal with Mean Look due to breeding restrictions. Glare is an option on the dual screens set, but Toxic is more useful for killing bulky threats. Snivy can also use Pursuit on the dual screens set, but it does laughable damage even to opponents that switch out.

However, Cottonee outpaces Snivy with a Prankster Taunt, and Magic Bounce Natu fears nothing from Taunt, setting up dual screens of its own while shaking off Leaf Storm or Giga Drain. Brick Break users, such as Pawniard, can shatter dual screens, and faster threats, such as Houndour, can outspeed Snivy and strike it down if it hasn't set them up yet.

Endeavor could work as a last-ditch move for Tepig when used with Flame Charge, as Tepig loses HP quite quickly and can make good use of it.

        "description": "<p>Oshawott can really only run a Swords Dance set without being outclassed by something else. Priority in Aqua Jet is very useful, as Little Cup contains a variety of fast, frail Pokemon such as Houndour and Taillow. Aqua Jet will OHKO Houndour pre-boost and OHKO Taillow post-boost, meaning powerful threats in Little Cup will have a hard time OHKOing Oshawott before it can hit them. Waterfall is Oshawott's main STAB move and will OHKO most threats it hits neutrally, such as Choice Scarf Mienfoo. A combination of Waterfall and Aqua Jet after a Swords Dance will even OHKO Eviolite Mienfoo. Since Oshawott will attract Slowpoke and Lileep with its Water-type moves, it gets time to set up on the switch. It can then proceed to strike either of them with X-Scissor and wreak havoc. If your team has a way to defeat the aforementioned walls, such as the combination of Wynaut and Diglett, Hidden Power Fire is recommended over X-Scissor to hit Ferroseed and Snover harder.</p> <p>If you choose X-Scissor instead of Hidden Power Fire, use an Adamant nature. Otherwise, Naughty allows Oshawott to keep its decent Special Attack. Simply put, Adamant is for X-Scissor and Naughty is for Hidden Power. You can use Aqua Tail to OHKO Mienfoo after a Swords Dance, but it's not recommended, as 90 accuracy is always tricky, and Waterfall + Aqua Jet will 2HKO it on the switch. Lastly, Encore is useful to help Oshawott set up, but you lose either power or coverage, both things Oshawott really needs. If you're not using Hidden Power Fire, an EV spread of 236 Atk / 236 Spe will get you the same stats barring Special Attack, and may be used if you prefer a \"cleaner\" spread.</p> <p>Teammates depend on what move you run in the last slot. If you use X-Scissor, a Steel trapper such as Magnemite or Nosepass to defeat Ferroseed is a good idea. If you opt for Hidden Power Fire, a combination of Wynaut and Diglett to kill Slowpoke and Lileep is ideal. Switching in on Recover or Slack Off allows you to lock them in that move with Encore and use Tickle to lower their Defense. Then, switch to Diglett and boost its Attack with Hone Claws. Finally, use Earthquake to OHKO them. Diglett also provides a switch-in to Electric-types, namely Chinchou, who resists both Water and Fire.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Don't be fooled by how bare this set looks, as half of its options were left out to keep this concise. Cottonee's stat spread and movepool scream for an Eviolite set, which helps it support its team immensely. Regardless of what you are trying to use Cottonee for, Leech Seed is a must on all of its sets, since this is its only true source of reliable recovery and as such is required to keep Cottonee healthy. Stun Spore works very well on Cottonee and allows it to function as an excellent sand check by switching in on an Earthquake and paralyzing Drilbur. Stun Spore is very, very good, but it can be replaced with Toxic if you are desperate to inflict more damage than Leech Seed does.</p> <p>Cottonee's other two moveslots are much more customizable. The choice between Substitute and Protect is a big one, as it changes the way Cottonee is played. Substitute can net Cottonee a free turn easily, for example, on a predicted status move or switch, which can spell doom for its opponent. However, a misprediction will cost Cottonee a quarter of its health, which is significant when it has only Leech Seed to keep it healthy. Protect racks up Leech Seed damage on U-turns and helps scout out opposing Choice item users without wasting 25% of Cottonee's health. However, a wrongly-timed Protect can give your opponent a free turn or switch. Encore and Taunt are in the same boat as the first choice. Encore stops setup sweepers trying to set up on Cottonee, as very few of them have priority moves to KO Cottonee with before it can Encore them. Taunt is mainly used to alleviate Cottonee's weakness to hazard setters, especially Grass-types that Cottonee can't harm with Leech Seed, but this is a poor choice for stopping setup sweepers, as they can still attack Cottonee.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Cottonee's defenses while increasing the HP recovered via Leech Seed. Cottonee is most certainly not limited to just the moves above, and can combine almost any move in its support movepool to make an effective combination. Toxic gives Cottonee the potential to do a lot more damage, especially against Grass-types such as Lileep. Many players use Cottonee as a sand check over Snover due to the fact that it doesn't summon hail, which can harm teammates. Since Grass-types are such an issue, Larvesta pairs well with Cottonee. Its STAB combination hits every Grass-type in the tier for super effective damage, and it can also handle the Fighting-types that aren't fazed by Cottonee's antics, such as Mienfoo and Timburr. If you don't want to double up on the Flying weakness, Vullaby can dispatch most Grass-types. Pokemon with fast checks and counters, such as Pawniard, appreciate Cottonee's ability to paralyze threats that they don't want to face, such as Mienfoo and Misdreavus.</p> "

  "Gothita": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Gothita really does look useless. Unlike its evolutions in the grown-up tiers, it doesn't have access to Shadow Tag due to the generation's breeding mechanics. Its offensive typing is horrid and its stats are subpar. When one takes a deeper look at Gothita, however, one will find that it does have some appealing traits. Its Psychic typing is quite useful in this metagame full of Fighting-types, and having only one common weakness is something to be thankful for. Gothita's special movepool is also very good when compared to common special attackers such as Chinchou. While Shadow Tag isn't obtainable, having Frisk as an ability is a lot better than nothing, as it will allow Gothita to scout the opponent by revealing their item. All-in-all, Gothita may not be an excellent powerhouse, but it has a lot of things going for it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Gothita runs an okay Choice Scarf set, but its power isn't enough to distinguish it from other Psychic-types such as Abra. Choice Specs faces a similar problem, but lacks Speed instead. Gothita can set up dual screens with Light Clay or Eviolite, but other users such as Mareep, which has fewer weaknesses, and Chikorita, which is bulkier, do it better. Gothita also gets some cool status moves such as Thunder Wave and Flatter, but that is a little too reliant on luck to be effective. Trick Room is an option for Gothita to help its teammates out, though Gothita itself is usually not slow enough to take advantage of it. However, Solosis almost completely outclasses Gothita in this role, with greater power and lower Speed. Lastly, Taunt and Mirror Coat can be options for certain scenarios, but they're extremely situational and Gothita is outclassed by other users.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gastly can easily OHKO Gothita with Shadow Ball before a Calm Mind. Scraggy, and other Dark-type physical attackers can hit Gothita's weaker Defense stat with STAB Crunch or Pursuit. Dark-types are also immune to Gothita's Psychic-type STAB attacks and can easily switch into Shadow Ball or Dark Pulse. Houndour, Pawniard, and the rare Poochyena all learn Sucker Punch and Pursuit, which can easily take Gothita down one way or another. Dwebble has super effective Bug-type STAB and can take any hit due to Sturdy; it also has Rock Blast to break Substitutes. Ferroseed can set up on any Gothita that doesn't run Hidden Power Fire or Fighting.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Gothita's spectacular movepool by turning it into a special powerhouse. The objective of this set is to deal as much damage as possible before Gothita faints, and Life Orb helps it do just that. With a lucky base HP stat that allows it to lower its HP to 19, the magic Life Orb number, Gothita is capable of attacking 19 times before it faints, assuming no other damage is taken. The most unique thing about Gothita, however, is its stat distribution. Gothita possesses good Special Attack, Speed, and bulk, allowing it to switch into neutral hits and still hit hard. Unlike Abra, Solosis, and other frail Psychic-types, Gothita isn't afraid of most priority attacks, and it can even survive most super effective special hits. Typing and stats aren't all that makes Gothita a good attacker, however. While most Life Orb attackers have to be very wary of an opponent that is potentially threatening, Gothita's special trait, Frisk, allows it to scout the opponent's item. This can be crucial against opponents that may or may not be threatening depending on their item, such as Gastly and Chinchou.</p> <p>In the first slot, you have the choice of Psychic or Psyshock. Psychic is usually the superior choice due to its higher Base Power, but Psyshock's effect of hitting the opponent's Defense stat can be useful on specially defensive Pokemon such as Munchlax. Another tough choice is choosing between Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Fighting. Thunderbolt will be of more benefit in most situations, but Hidden Power Fighting allows Gothita to hit Dark-types such as Pawniard that lack Sucker Punch. Hidden Power Fighting also leaves Gothita with a secret weapon against Ferroseed, which will almost always try to set up on it. Substitute or Calm Mind is up to how you want to play Gothita. If you want to use Gothita more strategically to beat a certain Pokemon, Substitute is the way to go. If you just want to use it as a powerhouse, Calm Mind will help you more.</p> <p>Energy Ball hits a few things harder than Thunderbolt, namely Hippopotas, Wooper, and Chinchou. Thunderbolt does, however, have higher Base Power and will hit most Water-types harder, so it's a better choice in the second slot. Hidden Power Fire is another option in the second slot if you want to hit Ferroseed or Bronzor harder, but that's the sole advantage it offers over Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p>Gothita's Special Attack isn't high enough to net the many KOs that people would like, so entry hazards can be used to remedy this issue. Stealth Rock and Spikes are both prime choices for entry hazards. Toxic Spikes also helps, but won't really do anything unless Gothita runs Substitute to stall out its opponent's health. It may seem like a strange idea, but using a fast Grass-type such as Cottonee to provide Leech Seed support will help Gothita a lot. Life Orb recoil can be the difference between Gothita living or not, and Leech Seed will essentially negate the recoil, and then some.</p> "

Charge Beam is a much weaker alternative, but it has a good chance of raising Klink's Special Attack, which can be very useful if somehow it has the time to use it.

It is also quite slow, meaning it needs Trick Room support to work well. Despite the many drawbacks, Litwick still hits hard and has a good movepool, which allows it to work as a good sweeper under the effects of Trick Room.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Litwick has a few good other options in its movepool to consider. Calm Mind could be used to try to set up, but Litwick is better off hitting as hard as possible under the limited turns granted by Trick Room. Psychic is an option to hit Fighting-types, although Fire Blast hits them just as hard. Flamethrower is available as a reliable STAB move, but Fire Blast provides the power that Litwick badly needs. Overheat is a powerful move, although Litwick has to switch after using it and use up a valuable turn of Trick Room. Sunny Day support is an interesting option, as it boosts Fire Blast to incredible levels of power. Memento could be used as a last-ditch effort to do something when Litwick is about to faint and could give a teammate an opening to set up. If Toxic Spikes is being used, Hex is an option, as it is more powerful than Shadow Ball on a poisoned Pokemon. Lastly, Litwick has a large support movepool, with moves such as Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, Haze, Pain Split, Confuse Ray, Taunt, Acid Armor, and Clear Smog, but Litwick is much too frail to take advantage of these normally useful moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Munchlax can easily take any move that Litwick carries and can trap with Pursuit or just KO with Earthquake, making it Litwick's best counter. Stunky is a good check with Sucker Punch and Pursuit, which means Litwick has to play a guessing game to survive the encounter. Houndour can do a similar job with Flash Fire, but takes major damage from Hidden Power Ground, which makes it a bit more shaky. Bulky Staryu and Chinchou take heavy damage from Energy Ball but easily KO Litwick with their Water-type attacks. Deino resists both of its STAB moves and possesses a powerful Crunch, which easily deals with Litwick. Trapinch can trap and KO Litwick in Trick Room, and Diglett does the same outside of it.

Hidden Power Ground is used in the third moveslot, since it allows Litwick to hit Chinchou and Houndour for super effective damage. In the last slot, Energy Ball is the best option if Litwick's teammates are providing Trick Room, as it hits Water-types, most of which can take a Shadow Ball. Trick Room could be set up by Litwick itself if it can come in on something threatened such as Ferroseed, though it is very unreliable because of Litwick's frailty.</p> <p>Stunky is a huge problem for Litwick, being able to use Sucker Punch or Pursuit to put Litwick into a checkmate situation. Trapinch can trap Stunky in Trick Room, and while Cubone can't trap it, it forces Stunky's team to think long and hard about what to switch in due to its incredible power. Slowpoke, Porygon, and Bronzor make good teammates for Litwick to set up Trick Room, freeing Litwick to use four attacks instead of having to set the effect up by itself. Ferroseed's low Speed lets it work well in Trick Room; it also has amazing synergy with Litwick, allowing it to be a solid defensive teammate. It also works well with Slowpoke as a makeshift defensive core for a Trick Room team. Solosis can sweep alongside Litwick, as the two can weaken each other's counters.

Its movepool, while not large, is big enough for it to pose an offensive threat to any team. Rufflet also has the defensive stats to take the odd hit or two while scouting or setting up. Unfortunately, Rufflet's Flying typing gives it undesirable weaknesses to common Electric-, Rock-, and Ice-type attacks, as well as Stealth Rock, which limit its offensive capabilities. Its Speed, although decent, leaves it outsped by threats such as Chinchou and Archen, who can bring down Rufflet in a flash with their STAB attacks. Rufflet might also have a hard time dealing major damage to the opponent because of its lack of strong, reliable STAB moves. Despite these flaws, Rufflet isn't to be underestimated, as with the right support, it can run through entire teams with ease.</p> ",

A Life Orb set might look viable on paper, as Rufflet likes having the freedom to switch moves while maintaining its decent coverage.

Rufflet also has access to Work Up and special attacks such as Air Slash and Heat Wave, but its terrible base 37 Special Attack stat makes this a bad idea.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Rufflet is not at all hard to counter because of its poor coverage options. Bronzor is the bane of Rufflet's existence, as it laughs at all of Rufflet's attacks, including Superpower, and can retaliate with a powerful STAB Gyro Ball. Similarly, Rock-types such as Roggenrola and Onix can sponge choice-locked Rufflet's attacks with ease and OHKO it with their STAB Rock-type attacks. Faster Choice Scarf users such as Gastly, Abra, and Chinchou can outspeed and dispose of Rufflet easily with their STAB attacks. Although uncommon, Archen only dislikes taking a Rock Slide, and can outspeed and OHKO Rufflet with its own Rock Slide. Cottonee can render the Bulk Up set useless with Encore if it switches in safely.

STAB Pluck is also a boon in a metagame in which Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo see a lot of usage. Superpower is Rufflet's way of hitting Rock- and Steel-types that would easily wall the rest of its moves. Rock Slide can be used instead of Superpower to hit Flying-types harder than Rufflet's other moves, as it is boosted by Sheer Force. It also ensures that Archen, who otherwise walls Rufflet, doesn't pose a big threat. U-turn is a given for any Choice Scarf set, giving Rufflet the ability to scout your opponent's switch-in.</p> <p>The EV spread is very simple. 252 Attack EVs maximize Rufflet's Attack, while 236 Speed EVs along with a Jolly nature give Rufflet 16 Speed, allowing it to tie with other Choice Scarf users having 16 Speed. However, if these Pokemon can be dealt with by Rufflet's teammates, an Adamant nature can be used to boost Rufflet's Attack further. The ability slash is based on the move selected in the last slot. If using Superpower, no move is boosted by Sheer Force, so Keen Eye is better. If using Rock Slide, Sheer Force is definitely superior. Thrash might appear to be a good alternative option for a Normal-type STAB, since it now has 120 Base Power, but Rufflet won't be able to switch out, meaning it will be used as setup bait by Steel-types such as Ferroseed, or KOed by faster Choice Scarf users such as Chinchou.</p> <p>Even though Rufflet checks a large number of threats, it needs team support to function properly. Because this set switches frequently, Stealth Rock will hinder it greatly, making Rapid Spin support a necessity. Sandshrew is a great choice, as it packs Rapid Spin, a useful immunity to the Electric-type attacks Rufflet fears, and STAB Earthquake to deal with the Rock-types that resist Rufflet's STAB moves. It does, however, add to Rufflet's Ice-type weakness. Staryu also packs Rapid Spin and a resistance to Ice-type moves, and can deal with Rock- and Steel-types that wall Rufflet with Surf and Hidden Power Fire, respectively.</p> <p>As mentioned earlier, Steel-types such as Bronzor give Rufflet a lot of grief, as they take almost no damage from all of its attacks other than Superpower, which turns Rufflet into setup bait. Magnemite aids Rufflet immensely in this regard, forming a potent combination by trapping and KOing the Steel-types that Rufflet lures in with Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fire.

Roost lets Rufflet shrug off any damage it accumulates as it sets up, and lets Rufflet heal itself so it can continue to set up or attack. Substitute can also be used, as it makes it easier for Rufflet to set up, and protects it from nasty status as well as attacks that could otherwise KO it, meaning Rufflet won't be stopped by faster Pokemon. Return is Rufflet's main STAB attack, hitting anything that doesn't resist it very hard after a Bulk Up. Pluck is Rufflet's secondary STAB move, giving it some form of super effective coverage. It also allows Rufflet to cripple Pokemon that rely upon Oran Berry to avoid certain 2HKOs.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Rufflet's Speed and Special Defense, allowing it to set up more easily. The remaining EVs are invested in Attack, Defense, and HP to give Rufflet one more point in each of those stats. As Rufflet needs all the speed it can get to set up against the numerous Pokemon in its Speed tier, you should choose a Jolly nature. If Rufflet chooses to use Roost, it should carry an Eviolite, to provide it with a permanent boost in defenses that will help it sponge attacks as it sets up. If Rufflet chooses to run Substitute, an Oran Berry is the preferred option as it gives Rufflet a form of recovery, and ensures that its sweep won't be cut short by a critical hit. It goes without saying that Rufflet needs team support to pull off a sweep, as Steel- and Rock-types wall it completely. Magnemite can trap and KO most Steel-types with ease, and can exploit the low Special Defense of most Rock-types to check them as well. Choice Scarf Diglett, while unable to deal with Bronzor, can trap and eliminate Rock-types as well as other fast Choice Scarf users, such as Chinchou, that trouble Rufflet. Entry hazard support from Tentacool and Ferroseed also aids Rufflet enormously, as it loves having its checks weakened. The former can also remove Stealth Rock from the field with Rapid Spin, making it a great teammate.</p> "

An Eviolite can be used over a Life Orb to make Wingull a more durable sweeper, but the lack of power is evident. An Electric- or Grass-type Pokemon to soften up bulky Water-type Pokemon will ease Wingull's job of sweeping through the opponent's team.

Finally, Hidden Power Fire 3-4HKOes Bronzor with Life Orb, but Bronzor will be able to easily KO Roggenrola first with Flash Cannon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo and Ground-types such as Sandile and Drilbur resist Stone Edge, and OHKO Roggenrola with their STAB attacks. Bronzor and Baltoy resist both Stone Edge and Earthquake, and destroy Roggenrola with their STAB moves. Water- and Grass-types take heavy damage from Stone Edge, but OHKO Roggenrola with their STAB attacks. Priority attacks also screw up Roggenrola as it has none of its own, making Croagunk a great check. Finally, entry hazards break Sturdy and leave Roggenrola wide open to all attacks that can KO it.</p> ",

Earthquake hits a lot of Pokemon which resist Stone Edge for at least neutral damage, with the notable exception of Pokemon such as Bronzor.

Hippopotas automatically sets up sandstorm, giving Roggenrola an additional boost to its Special Defense and Rock- and Ground-type attacks. In addition, sandstorm will be able to break Focus Sashes. Good teammates to this set include Mantyke and Slowpoke because they resist Fighting-, Water-, and Steel-type attacks, and Roggenrola can take Electric-type attacks with a sandstorm boost. Grass-types such as Cottonee also make good partners because they can take Water-, Ground-, and Grass-type attacks, while Roggenrola resists Fire-, Poison-, and Flying-type attacks.

Explosion is Explosion, KOing Roggenrola while allowing it to severely hurt the opponent, but behind a Substitute, Stone Edge or Earthquake will usually be a better choice. Life Orb is the preferred item as Substitute breaks Sturdy anyway, but Oran Berry allows Roggenrola to last longer, which could be crucial.</p> <p>As a defensive Pokemon, Roggenrola appreciates sandstorm support even more, boosting its abysmal Special Defense to more acceptable levels.

Ice Shard can give Vanillite a useful priority move, but as mentioned, Vanillite's Attack stat is unimpressive. Vanillite can also run a Choice Specs set thanks to its high Special Attack and great special movepool, but its poor Speed makes it easy to revenge kill Vanillite. Focus Sash can go over Life Orb on the Autotomize set to prevent priority attacks such as Mach Punch from ruining Vanillite's fun, but the ubiquity of entry hazards and weather render it useless more often than not.

Water Pulse deals with Fire-types such as Houndour who pose a massive threat to Vanillite, making it harder for the mentioned threats to switch in safely. There are two options for the last moveslot.

Snover also sets up hail, allowing Vanillite to fire off accurate Blizzards and activating Ice Body. Chinchou can also deal with Water-types easily, making it a fine partner as well.

Hidden Power Grass decimates any Water-types switching in to sponge Ice Beam, and also smacks most Rock-types hard, while Hidden Power Fighting deals with the pesky Steel-types who laugh at Vanillite's other moves. There are two options for the final moveslot.

Deerling reaches 17 Speed and 16 Attack with an Adamant nature, more than enough to dent common Pokemon such as Staryu. Access to Baton Pass as well as Work Up, Agility, and Substitute make Deerling a potent user of Baton Pass, which is supplemented by its unique typing and surprising bulk. Sap Sipper is a cool ability for Deerling, as it allows it to switch in on Spore from Shroomish or Giga Drain from Lileep and get an Attack boost that it can immediately Baton Pass away or use for itself. Deerling also has a pretty good physical movepool, with coverage options such as Nature Power and Jump Kick, along with STAB Return and Seed Bomb. If Vulpix were not banned, Deerling would truly be a threat to be reckoned with, but as things stand now, Deerling is an average Pokemon with just enough of a niche to function in Little Cup.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Deerling has access to Chlorophyll, and can sweep quite effectively when the sun is blazing. Deerling lacks Swords Dance, which is a key part of what makes its evolution effective. Instead, Deerling has access to Work Up to boost its Attack to respectable levels, often enough to sweep. However, the lack of a Drought user in Little Cup means that a sweeper set would need a lot of support to work. Deerling can act as a cleric due to its access to Aromatherapy, but is generally poor at this due to its only average bulk. A SubSeed set can be used well, but Deerling's weaknesses to Fighting-type attacks, as well as the presence of Snover, generally means that it will not accomplish much. Deerling has a wide support movepool, with attacks such as Thunder Wave, Sunny Day, and Reflect at its disposal. However, a support Pokemon weak to Fighting-type attacks is terrible in Little Cup. Cottonee has a wider support movepool, higher defenses, as well as Prankster, effectively outclassing Deerling at any kind of defensive role. A bulky set that uses Thunder Wave alongside offensive attacks is viable, but generally outclassed by Grass-types that aren't weak to Fighting types such as Shroomish and Foongus. They also have access to Spore, which leaves Deerling's Speed as its only advantage. Deerling could possibly run a set utilizing Work Up and Synthesis, but will not pull off a sweep very often due to its recovery being gimped by Hippopotas and Snover, as well as the presence of Mienfoo and Timburr as cornerstones in the metagame.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Fighting-types are far and away the best counters to Deerling. Eviolite Mienfoo can tank any move that Deerling has and retaliate with Drain Punch, recovering HP in the process. Timburr can set up on Deerling with ease, as well as outright defeat it with Mach Punch. Croagunk must be wary of Nature Power, but can use the combination of Fake Out and Vacuum Wave to defeat Deerling. Fire-types such as Larvesta and Ponyta can threaten Deerling with Flare Blitz and Will-O-Wisp, though Ponyta must look out for Nature Power. The Baton Pass set is easily defeated by Pokemon with Taunt. Cottonee resists Seed Bomb and has Prankster Taunt to stop Deerling in its tracks. Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Drifloon can switch in with ease and retaliate with Hidden Power Fighting and Acrobatics, respectively. Their presence also makes Jump Kick a very risky move for Deerling to use.

A resistance to Water-type attacks allows Deerling to take on Chinchou and Staryu quite well, as it only fears the rare Ice Beam or Scald burn. Return is capable of 2HKOing Mienfoo and Axew, and is also a good attack to throw around if the opponent's Ghost-type is defeated. Double-Edge is a stronger alternative that is capable of OHKOing Choice Scarf Mienfoo on the switch. Seed Bomb is a reliable STAB move that can hit Water- and Ground-types super effectively, giving Deerling a way to hurt Staryu, Frillish, and Drilbur. Jump Kick allows Deerling to hit Houndour, Snover, and Ferroseed super effectively, as well as giving it an attack to hit other Normal-types hard. Nature Power is slightly more useful in the last moveslot in order to hit Croagunk super effectively, as well as Fire-types such as Ponyta and Houndour. Nature Power also has the unique ability of ignoring Sucker Punch, which allows Deerling to revenge kill boosted Pawniard easily. Wild Charge is also useful to hit Flying-types such as Vullaby and Drifloon super effectively.

Sap Sipper is the ability of choice because it gives Deerling an Attack boost if it switches into a Grass-type move, as well as immunity to them. Water-types make great teammates for Deerling as they can absorb Fire-type attacks from the likes of Larvesta and Ponyta. Chinchou and Staryu are arguably the best at this, as they can offer supplementary support in Heal Bell and Rapid Spin, respectively. Stealth Rock support from Dwebble allows Deerling to easily muscle its way past counters such as the previously mentioned Larvesta, as its it is easily defeated on the switch-in thanks to the rocks stripping half of its health. Frillish is also a great teammate because its unique typing allows it to take on both Fire- and Fighting-types, something most other Pokemon cannot accomplish.

Despite what would seem like a crippling weakness to Fighting-types, Deerling has enough bulk to survive three Mach Punches from Timburr, as well as Fake Out + Drain Punch from standard Mienfoo, allowing it to escape with ease. Seed Bomb is used in the last slot in order to get around Taunt, as well as hit Water-types. Substitute can be used if you want to focus purely on Baton Pass.</p> <p>Deerling can run more Attack and Speed to strengthen the power of Seed Bomb, as it can reach 20 Attack after a Work Up if running a Jolly nature. Strong, slow sweepers such as Cranidos, Cubone, and Pawniard enjoy the Speed boost from Agility in order to let them outspeed many of their counters. Fast Pokemon such as Elekid enjoy having a Work Up boost, as they are fast but often lack the power to threaten teams. Timburr is a huge threat to this set, as Drain Punch does major damage to Deerling. In order to combat it, Pokemon that take very little from Fighting-type attacks, such as Natu and Frillish, are recommended as partners.</p> "

Clear Smog distinguishes Koffing from other physical walls, as it enables Koffing to take away stat boosts from the likes of Misdreavus and Timburr, both of which are powerful boosting sweepers in Little Cup. Will-O-Wisp allows Koffing to cripple physical attackers such as Mienfoo, as well as causing prominent Koffing switch-ins such as Chinchou to take residual damage. Toxic is a viable option over Will-O-Wisp for crippling walls such as Chinchou, Lileep, and Hippopotas. Fire Blast rounds off the set by giving Koffing an option to hit Steel-types, such as Ferroseed and Bronzor, which would otherwise wall Koffing with ease.</p> <p>Levitate is what puts Koffing over the edge as a physically defensive wall; the ability to wall Fighting-types and the popular Drilbur is a niche that no other Pokemon in Little Cup can fill.

The EVs maximize Koffing's defenses; there is no need to lower its HP to maximize Pain Split recovery. Koffing can viably run several moves in the fourth moveslot. Flamethrower is a less powerful Fire Blast that does not KO Steel-types as effectively but has perfect accuracy. Thunderbolt is useful for taking down Staryu, a Water-type that is known to switch into Koffing, and is also useful for checking Vullaby. Finally, Shadow Ball can be used if your team needs a physical wall that checks Misdreavus too.</p> <p>As Koffing doesn't have great Special Defense even with the boost from Eviolite, Pokemon that can take on powerful special attackers are good teammates. Lileep can easily beat most special attackers, while Chinchou and Shroomish can deal with Water-types. In return, Koffing can take on Fighting-types for this trio. Porygon can also sponge special attacks and pairs well with Koffing, which can do the same with physical attacks.</p> "

Since then, lots of competition has been introduced, but our little bird friend still packs quite a punch, allowing it to fill a solid niche on almost any team. While Doduo, Starly, and Taillow are all superior to Pidgey, Pidgey can still be an effective Choice user. Pidgey reaches a Speed stat of 16 in Little Cup, which allows it to outspeed most of the Little Cup metagame. With a great STAB move in the form of Brave Bird, and a decent Attack stat of 14, Pidgey has enough speed and power to be a respectable member of any team.</p> ",

It does have a few interesting special attacks, but its abysmal Special Attack stat means it can't make much use of them. Pidgey also gets Feather Dance and Roost, but Pidgey's terrible defenses make it difficult to use these moves effectively as well.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Basically any Steel-type Pokemon walls Pidgey, such as Bronzor or Magnemite. Most Rock-type Pokemon, such as Onix or Geodude, can handle Pidgey, although they must beware of taking repeated Steel Wings, as this will wear them down.

Choice Scarf is the preferred option here, as it allows Pidgey to act as your team's revenge killer. After the boost, Pidgey hits a Speed stat of 24, meaning that it outruns every non-boosted Pokemon in Little Cup, as well as a number that are boosted. Brave Bird allows Pidgey to hit pretty hard, even with no Attack boost. U-turn is on the set as it helps to keep up the offensive momentum during the battle. Feint Attack is used to hit Ghost-type Pokemon hard without suffering recoil damage, although Brave Bird will still deal more damage to every Ghost-type in the tier. Return gives good neutral coverage while being a strong move without recoil.</p> <p>Pursuit is a suitable option over Feint Attack as it allows Pidgey to trap and KO fleeing Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon. Steel Wing can be used over Return to help with coverage a bit, but Pidgey loses out on the raw power of Return in exchange for minor coverage. Ferroseed makes a good partner to Pidgey as it can handle any super effective move aimed at Pidgey. Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mienfoo or Timburr that can deal with Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon will make it a lot easier for Pidgey to deal damage to the opponent's team.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Rattata has improved quite a bit in Black and White. Most notably it has received Hustle as a Dream World ability, along with several new moves such as Wild Charge and Retaliate. Though still hindered by its frailty, Rattata can now be considered a threat, which is a major step up from the last generation.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rattata's ability to run the FEAR set hasn't changed, and this is still as viable as in the previous generation. FEAR refers to the strategy in which Rattata runs Endeavor, a Focus Sash, and a priority move to finish the opponent off once it has been weakened by Endeavor. Rattata can also run Focus Sash and Counter, or Focus Sash and Reversal, enabling it to take down at least one opponent every match with correct prediction. Rattata has a massive special movepool, but the only special moves worth noting are Grass Knot and Ice Beam. Work Up is an option to boost Rattata's offenses, but Rattata's frailty can make it difficult to obtain a boost. A Life Orb set with Quick Attack being the main STAB attack can really pack a punch with Hustle, and can take out some otherwise threatening Pokemon. Aerial Ace can surprise the Fighting-types hoping to get rid of Rattata, and has perfect accuracy. Taunt can be used to block burns from Frillish and prevent Dwebble from setting up entry hazards. Rattata can also strip off half of the opponent's health in an instant with Super Fang, but its other attacks usually deal more damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Ground- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Hippopotas, Wooper, and Mienfoo are extremely good counters to Rattata. Hippopotas has Slack Off, which can null the effect of Rattata's attacks over time. Wooper has high HP and Defense stats, and it also has moves such as Stockpile and Recover that can help it deal with Rattata. Omanyte, Tirtouga, and Kabuto can switch into any attack from Rattata barring Wild Charge. Archen resists U-turn, Flame Wheel, and Return, and is an excellent check to the Choice Scarf set. Rattata is also weak to common priority moves, though its checks will need to watch out for a Guts-boosted Sucker Punch.</p> ",

Sucker Punch is a very handy move, as it not only gives Rattata good coverage, but also allows Rattata to attack first. Flame Wheel allows Rattata to hit Pokemon such as Ferroseed hard, while Protect can be used as to ensure the activation of the orb, activating Rattata's full power Facade. Wild Charge can damage several of Rattata's checks, for instance Kabuto, Tirtouga, and Omanyte, yet U-turn can also be extremely helpful to Rattata. If you do choose to run U-turn, carrying a Rapid Spin user also becomes important to get rid of entry hazards, which will limit Rattata.</p> <p>Instead of Sucker Punch, Rattata can use STAB Quick Attack as a priority move. Though Quick Attack is more reliable, it is less powerful and offers inferior coverage, and as such, it is not the primary option. Given Rattata's frailty, it will often have to switch out to avoid being KOed. Thus, to prevent Rattata from being worn down, a Rapid Spin user such as Squirtle is recommended. Aside from this, having Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Bronzor, Dwebble, and Ferroseed is helpful. Priority moves such as Fake Out, Extreme Speed, and Mach Punch can swiftly eliminate Rattata, so having a Ghost-type teammate can be very useful. Pokemon such as Diglett and Wynaut also make good teammates, as they can counter Croagunk, a major threat to Rattata.</p> "

STAB Return is Rattata's most powerful move, allowing it to dish out massive amounts of damage in conjunction with Hustle. U-turn is a useful move for scouting, and is particularly effective on Choice Scarf users, where prediction is crucial. Flame Wheel destroys Pokemon such as Ferroseed, whereas Wild Charge can damage Pokemon such as Tirtouga, Mantyke, Kabuto, Omanyte, and Archen along with other checks to Rattata. Crunch and Sucker Punch are present to hit Ghost-types super effectively. Both attacks have the same power, but Crunch is more consistent, as Sucker Punch only works when the opponent attacks. Sucker Punch does offer strong priority, however.</p> <p>STAB Retaliate deserves at least a mention as it doubles in power if Rattata is switching in after a teammate has been KOed. However, Return is better when Stealth Rock support can help Rattata in revenge killing.

Its Normal / Flying typing doesn't help it either, as it is both weak to Stealth Rock and has a neutrality to the common Fighting-type attacks. Taillow mostly outclasses Spearow with its high Speed and access to Guts. However, Spearow has the makings of a good scout thanks to base 70 Speed and access to U-turn, while base 60 Attack means hits from Spearow are going to hurt. It also has access to Pursuit, meaning it can be a great trapper. Overall, given the right conditions, Spearow can work great on your team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>It must be emphasized again that Spearow is really strapped for competitive options. You can run 3 attacks and Agility or Substitute, but Spearow lacks coverage as well as actual attacking power. Spearow has access to Whirlwind and Feather Dance, but it's very frail, meaning that Spearow will have a tough time pulling it off without dying. Lastly, Toxic can be used as a filler on the Choice Scarf set to catch some walls on the switch in.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is a great way to check Spearow, as it automatically puts a timer on how many times it can switch in and do damage. Chinchou and other fast Electric-types can easily knock out Spearow with a super effective STAB attack. Priority is another great way to deal with Spearow; it is hit neutrally or super effectively by all forms of priority, meaning it will be severely damaged or KOed. Anything that can take a hit from Spearow and hit back can also be called a check given Spearow's frailty. Lastly, Pursuit users often put Spearow in a checkmate position if they come in after a kill.</p> ",

Drill Peck is in the first moveslot, gaining STAB and hitting Fighting- and Grass-types extremely hard thanks to Spearow's good base 60 Attack. Return is Spearow's second STAB move, with excellent neutral coverage. Quick Attack is another option in the second slot, having priority but also being significantly weaker than Return. U-turn is a great move for scouting and keeping momentum. Pursuit is used in the final moveslot as a great tool for putting Ghost- and Psychic-types into a checkmate position.</p> <p>The given EVs maximize Spearow's Attack and Speed, with the rest being put in Spearow's defenses to increase its overall bulk. An Adamant nature is used over Jolly as Spearow already reaches 24 Speed with a Choice Scarf, and Spearow needs all the power it can get. Sniper is the preferred ability for Spearow, as not only can it be convenient at times, but it's the only ability Spearow can profit from competitively.</p> <p>Aside from the options given above, Spearow doesn't have much else to use on this set. It's possible to put some of Spearow's Special Defense EVs into its Special Attack and switch its nature to Naughty; you can then switch out one of the moves above with one from its special movepool. Options include Hidden Power, Heat Wave, and Ominous Wind. However, don't expect too much from Spearow and its Base 31 Special Attack. Spearow can also carry a Choice Band over a Choice Scarf and use a Jolly nature; Spearow will hit a lot harder but it will be much slower, which can be crucial in some cases.</p> <p>Rapid Spinners make excellent teammates for Spearow, as it will be switching in and out often, with the potential to rack up Stealth Rock damage very quickly. Fighting-types are also good teammates to get rid of Rock- and Steel-types, who wall Spearow with ease.

  "Ekans": {
    "overview": "<p>Say hello to Ekans, perhaps the most underrated threat in Little Cup. A good defensive typing allows it to tank hits from Fighting-type threats such as Mienfoo, while its amazing support movepool, including Substitute, Swagger, Disable, Protect, Switcheroo, and Glare, can be used to stall out the opponent until they're knocked out from residual damage or Ekans's variety of attacks. It even gets two great abilities in the form of Intimidate and Shed Skin. Unfortunately, Ekans has no other appeal, as offensively, it is outclassed by Croagunk and Grimer. It also must overcome the problem of horrible offensive typing with good team support; Poison-type moves hit only Grass-type Pokemon super effectively, while not doing any damage to Steel-types and being resisted by four other types. Ekans also suffers from subpar stats, which makes it hard to consider for a spot on a team. Ultimately, although it has a few problems, Ekans is a good Pokemon that poses a threat to many opponents.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ekans has access to Substitute and Disable, which work well because it only has two weaknesses. You can use an offensive Choice Scarf set, although Ekans doesn't have much of a movepool for it. Some other attacking moves it gets are Double-Edge, Pursuit, Aqua Tail, and Thief. Thief can be used without an item to act as a pseudo Knock Off. Additional support moves include Haze and Gastro Acid.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>On the Coil set, Choice Band Diglett beats Ekans even after Coil. Slowpoke can take any of Ekans's moves and hit it back with Psychic. Pawniard completely walls Ekans unless it runs Earthquake, and it has access to Psycho Cut to hurt Ekans badly. Any Psychic-type Pokemon with Substitute that predicts well might be able to outsmart Ekans.</p> <p>On the Annoyer set, Cottonee flat-out beats it due to priority Taunt. Lickitung has Own Tempo and can beat Ekans with Return or Earthquake. Any Pokemon with a Substitute up completely walls Ekans.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Coil",
        "description": "<p>Coil was given to Ekans this generation, and there is no reason not to use it. Coil is a boosting move that raises the user's Attack, Defense, and accuracy, which is perfect on Ekans, a physically-based Pokemon with low Defense and an inaccurate, powerful STAB move in Gunk Shot. Gunk Shot is recommended as Ekans's main STAB move due to its monstrous power and high accuracy when paired with Coil; after a single use of Coil, Gunk Shot's accuracy will be around 93%, easily making it reliable. Poison Jab is an alternative to Gunk Shot if you like the immediate higher accuracy and PP, but Ekans probably won't be around long enough to use Gunk Shot more than 8 times anyway, and if you're not using Coil then you're not achieving the goal of this set. Sucker Punch is used mostly for priority and the ability to beat Gastly. Gunk Shot will do at least 27% to Gastly, always breaking its Substitute. This means with good prediction, Ekans has no hard time with Gastly thanks to Sucker Punch, especially as it resists Sludge Bomb and has Shed Skin to render Hypnosis close to useless. Sucker Punch can also make Ekans a revenge killer in desperate measures or OHKO frail Psychic-types such as Abra before they can attack it.</p> <p>Rest and Earthquake are both useful moves for the last slot. Rest will heal Ekans, so it is usually the better choice, and Shed Skin works in harmony with Rest to wake Ekans up. If your team has Wish support, however, you may want to go with Earthquake. Earthquake allows Ekans to beat opposing Poison-types without Levitate, namely Croagunk, which resists Ekans's other two moves.</p> <p>You can use Poison Fang or another Poison-type move over Gunk Shot if you don't trust its accuracy even after the accuracy boost provided by Coil. Bulldoze is available in the last slot if you wish to lower your opponent's Speed; note that using Coil or Rest on a switch will almost always give better results, though. Ekans has access to some very obscure, situational moves such as Seed Bomb, Rock Slide, and even Wrap. These should almost never be used over the moves listed in the set, but if your team has more use for them, it's an exception.</p> <p>Good teammates for Ekans are Pokemon that can defeat Ground- and Psychic-types. Frillish is a perfect candidate; both of its STAB moves are super effective on Ekans's weaknesses. Frillish can also somewhat take care of Gastly so long as it is not behind a Substitute. It will, however, lose the majority of its health from a Shadow Ball, and Life Orb or Choice Specs variants will beat Frillish. Cottonee can come in on Ground-type moves and use Encore, and it can lock Gastly into Substitute to boot. On top of this, Ekans can take Poison-type moves aimed at Cottonee with ease. Leech Seed support will also be useful to constantly heal Ekans, especially if it isn't running Rest.</p> "

        "description": "<p>The basic strategy of this set is to switch into something that fears Ekans such as Mienfoo, scare it with Intimidate, hit the switch-in with Switcheroo, hit the next switch-in with Glare, and use Swagger on it. This is probably the most annoying set in Little Cup; every single obscure move Ekans can learn combine to make it impossible to hit. Switcheroo is to put Ekans's Choice Scarf on an opposing wall. Because Ekans lures walls such as Slowpoke and Ferroseed, Switcheroo is extremely useful for crippling them. Afterward, depending on the opponent, it's best to use either Glare or Swagger. If the opponent is a fast Pokemon that can't harm Ekans, Glare will hit any switch-in, even Ground-types, assuming it hits. If it is a slow Pokemon such as Ferroseed which will probably try to set up anyway, Swagger is the best choice to hinder their setup. If the victim will outspeed Ekans with a Choice Scarf and be able to damage it easily, however, switching to a check is the best idea.</p> <p>Intimidate is the preferred ability as it causes switches, which is Ekans's lighter fluid so to speak. Ekans, believe it or not, is a phenomenal Mienfoo check. With the EVs and nature above, Choice Scarf Ekans will outspeed Mienfoo, lower its Attack stat with Intimidate, and give it a Choice Scarf. It can then proceed to wreak havoc with Glare and Swagger on switch-ins.</p> <p>The last slot is reserved for an attacking move so that Ekans isn't complete Taunt bait. Acid Spray is a useful STAB move which will cause even more switches, as it harshly lowers the foe's Special Defense. Giga Drain is an option over Acid Spray, however, as it gives Ekans some health back, which it greatly desires. It also hits Ground-types on the switch.</p> <p>In the last slot, you may use Protect or Substitute to stall out damage from Swagger (or poison damage if your team has Toxic Spikes). You can remove the Defense and Special Defense EVs to put 36 into Ekans's Special Attack, which will then hit 11, but this set is meant to be bulky and not offensive, so it's not recommended. The nature should be swapped to Jolly if one desires to use a physical move. Attract is an option if your team has Toxic Spikes, but it's very situational.</p> <p>Users of entry hazards are the best teammates for Ekans. As it will usually cause three to four switches a game, you will want to have as many entry hazards as possible. Omanyte, which has decent synergy with Ekans, has access to every form of entry hazard. Pineco also has access to all 3 entry hazards as well as Rapid Spin. Dwebble can use Stealth Rock and Spikes, and it can beat Psychic-types with Bug-type attacks. Stunky can get rid of Psychic-types using Pursuit, and it also beats Gastly, especially Lum Berry Stunky. Wynaut can trap and kill most Ground-type Pokemon that threaten Ekans.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The sets listed above are Sandshrew's most viable options in Little Cup. An all-out Life Orb attacking set might seem effective, but it is better done by Drilbur; Eviolite takes better advantage of Sandshrew's nice Defense stat. In nearly all cases, Sandshrew should not be run without sand, and should not be run without Drilbur; Sandshrew's main niche in LC is its place on teams with Hippopotas and Drilbur. Sand Veil sets, perhaps even utilizing Bulldoze, have some potential due to Sandshrew's bulk and power, but are not as effective as ones running Sand Rush. Sandshrew also has other support options such as Knock Off and Super Fang, but it has difficulty finding moveslots with which to use them.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Scarf Snover checks all Sandshrew, removing the sand it relies on and OHKOing with Blizzard. Lileep can take a hit from boosted Sandshrew and Giga Drain to take advantage of Sandshrew's weaker Special Defense stat. Hippopotas can also withstand Sandshrew's attacks and Roar to reset its boosts. Bronzor is immune to Earthquake, resists Rock Slide, and is only 3HKOed by +2 Night Slash. However, Bronzor's unimpressive base 24 Special Attack prevents it from doing substantial damage to Sandshrew, rendering Bronzor unable to consistently defeat Swords Dance variants. Priority such as Snover's Ice Shard and Totodile's Aqua Jet can help to take down Sandshrew, but it needs to be weakened substantially first. Drilbur, a faster Sand Rush user, can also KO Sandshrew after it has taken some prior damage. Scarf Porygon Traces Sand Rush, outspeeds, and OHKOes with Ice Beam. Scarf Misdreavus Speed ties with Jolly Sandshrew but cannot OHKO Sandshrew cleanly and is KOed by even an unboosted Night Slash. Tirtouga can easily set up a Shell Smash against sand teams and OHKO Sandshrew with +2 Aqua Jet. Bulky Grass-types, such as Shroomish, Foongus, Chikorita, and Turtwig, are hard stops for Sandshrew. Cottonee can Encore Sandshrew's Swords Dance or Rapid Spin to allow another Pokemon to set up. Frillish stops Sandshrew from spinning away entry hazards and threatens to deal heavy damage with Scald. Finally, Focus Sash Abra checks Sandshrew, but can only KO after Sandshrew has been weakened.</p> ",

After a Swords Dance, Adamant and Jolly Sandshrew reach a monstrous 36 and 34 Attack, respectively. +2 Sandshrew can OHKO Misdreavus and, with minimal residual damage, Timburr and Mienfoo, as well as 2HKO Hippopotas, Ferroseed, and Lileep. Adamant Sandshrew can also OHKO Timburr with a boosted Earthquake after Stealth Rock, so even a slightly weakened team will be hard pressed to withstand Sandshrew's onslaught. This power means that Sandshrew can forgo Life Orb for Eviolite to increase its bulk and obtain more opportunities to set up. With its high Defense, Sandshrew can set up easily on all but the strongest physical attackers. Earthquake serves as Sandshrew's strong and reliable STAB, hitting most Pokemon in LC for solid damage and allowing Sandshrew to be extremely threatening after a Swords Dance. Rock Slide complements Earthquake's coverage by hitting the Flying-types that are immune to Ground-type attacks and the Bug-types that resist Earthquake hard; it OHKOes Taillow and Shelmet after Stealth Rock. Night Slash completes Sandshrew's coverage, OHKOing Misdreavus and Exeggcute and dealing neutral damage to Bronzor to help wear it down for Drilbur.</p> <p>Drilbur, after Hippopotas, is obviously the most important partner for Sandshrew, as Sandshrew's main niche is breaking down Drilbur's checks for Drilbur to clean up—or benefitting from Drilbur doing the same. Bronzor can check the pair with its typing and Levitate, but only 4HKOes Sandshrew with Flash Cannon, while Sandshrew's +2 Night Slash 3HKOes. A better check to Sandshrew and Drilbur—and a Pokemon that poses a severe threat to Sandstorm teams in general—is Snover. Choice Scarf Snover outspeeds both Sandshrew and Drilbur, removes the Sandstorm that feeds the Sand Rush duo's blazing Speed stats, and OHKOes them with Blizzard. Although already a threat to Sandstorm teams, Snover poses a particular threat to \"Double Rush\" due to the restrictions in synergy caused by running three Ground-types. Scarf Porygon is another check that is an issue for Sandshrew, as it uses Trace to take advantage of Sandshrew's Sand Rush to kill it with a super effective Ice Beam. Munchlax, despite its low usage, is actually an excellent choice to deal with Snover and Porygon, as its immense special bulk and Thick Fat ability allow it to take little from their attacks and either OHKO Snover and 2HKO Porygon with Return or deal heavy damage with Pursuit as they switch out. Munchlax also draws in weaker physical attackers that Sandshrew can easily set up on. Shell Smash Tirtouga is another issue for Sandshrew, as it can use Sturdy to get an opportunity to use Shell Smash and OHKO Sandshrew with +2 Aqua Jet. Lileep serves an excellent check to Tirtouga and the numerous other Water-types populating LC, contributing greatly to a sand team's synergy thanks to its immunity to Water-type moves. Croagunk is also an excellent teammate, countering Tirtouga, providing an immunity to Water-type attacks, and threatening opposing Snover, Porygon, and Lileep with STAB Fighting-type attacks. Most teams' final way of attempting to defeat Drilbur and Sandshrew lies in priority. Magnemite can still help against Flying-types should Sandshrew be weakened, and is also able to trap and KO Bronzor.</p> "

Sandshrew should be run with Hippopotas and Drilbur; Sandshrew needs sand support in order to be effective, and Drilbur is often the better choice for teams only wishing to run one Sand Rush user. Unlike the Swords Dance set, this set cannot muscle through Bronzor at all, so Magnemite makes a good teammate to trap and KO it. Magnemite also threatens Water-types and resists Snover's STAB attacks, providing further help for Sandstorm teams. Lileep and Ferroseed also counter unboosted Sandshrew, so Croagunk makes for a good partner, resisting their Grass-type attacks and destroying them with super effective Fighting-type moves while also serving as an excellent counter to many Water-types in LC. This set is more about supporting its teammates than receiving support, so Pokemon that enjoy having entry hazards consistently removed make for great teammates. Drifloon is one such Pokemon, being Stealth Rock weak and also having its weaknesses to Rock- and Electric-type attacks covered by Sandshrew. Sandshrew defeats the Steel- and Electric-type Pokemon that resist Drifloon's attacks, while Drifloon beats Grass-types like Shroomish that utterly wall Sandshrew. Drifloon is also able to threaten the only Pokemon that can consistently block Sandshrew's Rapid Spin: Frillish. Other Pokemon that can handle Frillish such as Lileep and Misdreavus have good synergy with Sandshrew and make naturally good partners.</p> "

  "Nidoran-M": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoran-M is the definition of \"unique\" in Little Cup thanks to a few uncommon characteristics. Firstly, it is one of the only Pokemon to get the ability Hustle, which allows it to fire off physical attacks with great power at the cost of a little accuracy. Secondly, Nidoran-M's access to useful obscure moves such as Thunderbolt allows it to pick off certain Pokemon who would normally be very threatening to it such as Slowpoke. Poison typing grants Nidoran-M the ability to switch into different Fighting-type moves and attack. This typing also means that it can absorb Toxic Spikes, which, while not very common, can be a pain for most offensive teams to deal with. While its stats are sub-par, Nidoran-M is definitely a threatening Pokemon and it should be treated as such.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Outside of \"use something better,\" Nidoran-M doesn't have many other options. It has access to Disable, and it can make a good annoyer with Substitute and Disable as a combo. Toxic Spikes is an option to set up with a defensive Eviolite set, but Nidoran-M's amount of natural bulk is far from enough to tank hits, so it is probably better off as a suicide lead with Focus Sash if it's setting up Toxic Spikes. Super Fang is another option to make Nidoran-M a good wallbreaker; however, it is illegal with Hustle, so it is probably better to just attack. Rivalry is an option to remedy this, but Hustle is really the only thing that makes Nidoran-M good, and giving it up would be unfortunate. Trick Room is another strategy, and while Nidoran-M isn't too slow, it is much slower than Mienfoo, Taillow, and company and can take advantage of that with its mixed attacker set. If you are using Trick Room, an EV spread of 68 HP / 224 Atk / 200 SpA with a Brave nature is ideal. Lastly, Head Smash is available, but its coverage isn't good and its recoil is too high.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Any Ghost-types with Substitute easily beat Nidoran-M. Wynaut, whose popularity has increased, can beat Nidoran-M using a combination of Encore, Counter, and Mirror Coat. While Nidoran-M has good coverage with its attacking moves, most Pokemon it can't hit super effectively such as Machop and Zorua will beat it one-on-one, so it must watch out for such threats. Timburr takes nothing from Nidoran-M and can set up Bulk Up on it, which instantly makes it a threat. Wooper can beat it despite any boosts from Hone Claws courtesy of Unaware, using Earthquake to OHKO it. Wooper can also use Recover to remove any damage Nidoran-M inflicts.</p> ",

        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>A high Attack stat thanks to Hustle with a stellar special movepool are obvious grounds for a mixed set. Using both physical and special moves means Nidoran-M can hit almost any Pokemon from their weaker side, allowing it to 2HKO almost anything in LC. Poison Jab is Nidoran-M's hardest hitting move, and its high chance to inflict poison status means it can be used to defeat stall, allowing Nidoran-M to act as a makeshift stallbreaker. Sucker Punch is a blessing for Nidoran-M to have as it grants both priority and a super effective attack to use against Gastly and other Ghost-types. In fact, offensive Gastly is always OHKOed by Sucker Punch without any residual damage. Thunderbolt is another blessing for Nidoran-M to hit bulky Water-types. While using obscure strategies such as Thunderbolt on a Poison-type Pokemon may seem less effective, this is an exception for a few reasons. Nidoran-M's Poison typing will easily lure Slowpoke in, which is where Thunderbolt comes into play; it does high amounts of damage to any Staryu, Slowpoke, and Frillish, no matter what EV spread and item. Hidden Power Fire takes a similar approach as Ferroseed will try to come in on Poison Jab, which is where you can use Hidden Power Fire to 2HKO it while not taking any hits.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Nidoran-M's Attack and Speed whilst boosting its Special Attack and Defense a little. Shadow Claw over Sucker Punch is an option for reliability rather than power and priority. While it doesn't let Nidoran-M defeat Gastly without taking any damage, it can hit it on the switch and OHKO it without any other damage. Substitute is another option over either Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fire because it allows Nidoran-M to scout opponent's attacks before acting. This is a great combination with Sucker Punch as it not only allows Nidoran-M to avoid status moves that Sucker Punch draws, but it also encourages the opponent to attack, giving Sucker Punch more reliability. Hone Claws is another option to remedy Hustle's accuracy drop and raise Nidoran-M's not-so-stellar Attack, but it's extremely hard to set up with such low Speed compared to Diglett, Gastly, and others.</p> <p>The best teammate for Nidoran-M is bulky Eviolite Staryu. It can easily defeat Diglett with Water- or Ice-type moves, and it beats Frillish and Slowpoke with Thunderbolt. If you're using Substitute or Hone Claws in place of Hidden Power Fire, Magnemite with Hidden Power Fire can defeat Ferroseed. Dwebble is able to set up Stealth Rock and Spikes to aid Nidoran-M's sweep while Staryu can remove them from your side of the field with Rapid Spin.</p> "

While there are several Flying-types that outclass it, this little guy has a high enough Attack stat that makes switching into its Brave Bird a tall task. Additionally, Zubat has a number of unique characteristics to its name, with its most useful attribute coming in the form of a 4x resistance to Fighting-type moves.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Zubat can pull off a Nasty Plot set with Air Slash, Hidden Power Fighting, and a filler move, but its dreadful Special Attack stat renders this a poor choice. It also has an astonishing pool of viable support moves for any team's benefits. Whirlwind can prove useful if you can use it at the right time; just make sure you have entry hazards on the field. Zubat has access to Hypnosis, and although Platinum and subsequent games have cut down Hypnosis's accuracy, it is by no means unusable in this metagame. Though gimmicky, Zubat can make use of many other support moves such as Confuse Ray, Attract, and Captivate. Haze too can be used to stop Pokemon that attempt to set up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Most Steel-types can give Zubat trouble, although there aren't many in this metagame. Magnemite isn't seen often, but it can switch into Brave Bird and threaten Zubat with its STAB Electric-type attacks. Chinchou and most other Electric-type Pokemon that resist Brave Bird can force it to switch out on most instances, increasing residual damage from Stealth Rock. Despite many Pokemon being able to switch in and threaten Zubat, nothing can safely switch into Super Fang except for Ghost-types, which are conveniently 2HKOed by Brave Bird. Choice Scarf Chinchou can switch in, but it is 2HKOed by Brave Bird or a Super Fang followed by Brave Bird.</p> ",

Steel Wing is mostly unused, but it helps to 2HKO the occasional Rock-type which switches into a predicted Brave Bird. The third slot provides more type coverage; Zubat can use a Dark-type move to damage opponents without resorting to Brave Bird. The last move is filler and should be chosen to best suit your team. Pursuit can still be used if you didn't choose it as your primary Dark-type move, although without Heat Wave, Steel-types wall this set cold. If you decide to run Heat Wave, a Naive or Hasty nature can be used. U-turn is also a great option to force offensive pressure on the opponent. If you don't mind the Brave Bird recoil, you can use it to hit Ghost-types for plenty of damage and forgo a Dark-type attack; this allows you to run both U-turn and Heat Wave.</p> <p>Double-Edge or Facade can be used in the final slot, but they're pretty lackluster compared to the other good options available. Zubat's 4x resistance to Fighting-type attacks makes it an excellent counter to Fighting-types in Little Cup, giving it an easy switch-in to start firing off STAB Brave Birds. Ferroseed is the main Steel-type seen in Little Cup, but is still hit neutrally by Brave Bird because of its Grass / Steel typing, making Heat Wave less important. Choice Scarf Zubat is also great check to Choice Scarf Mienfoo, a huge threat in Little Cup. Life Orb is also viable on this set, giving Zubat the freedom to switch moves.</p> "

Zubat thus makes a good candidate for teams troubled by stall, as it can run a very effective stallbreaking set. With an Eviolite, most slower defensive Pokemon are not going to outdamage Zubat's Roost, and Taunt also stops them from setting up or inflicting status. Super Fang bypasses defenses and swiftly deals 50% to the opposing Pokemon. Even when you're not playing against stall, this set still functions as a decent bulky Pokemon capable of checking many Fighting-types. Zubat can deal a hefty amount of damage with STAB Brave Bird, even without many Attack EVs. Toxic can be used over Taunt, but it is down to personal preference.</p> <p>With Taunt and Roost, Zubat can switch into and defeat boosted Timburr. Any Pokemon slower than it can be hit with Super Fang and usually knocked out by a follow-up Brave Bird. Zubat also renders Ferroseed useless; not only does it break stall, but it can also do a decent job of stalling itself between Taunt, Roost, and its respectable bulk.</p> "

It is, however, one of the slowest Chlorophyll users. Oddish's high Special Attack stat and powerful STAB Grass and Poison attacks are what makes it a top tier sun sweeper. Its immunity to Toxic is also very useful because many common defensive Pokemon in Little Cup do not like being poisoned. Because of this, Oddish and other Poison-type Pokemon have a nice niche in the metagame.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Oddish has a shallow movepool, and has but a few other options. Oddish could run a Swords Dance set, though its Attack is rather low and its physical movepool is quite shallow, consisting of only Seed Bomb and Double-Edge. A SubSeed set is somewhat viable with sun support, but Oddish is outclassed as a SubSeeder by Cottonee, who has Prankster and does not require sun support.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Snover is the number one counter to any sun sweeper. Snover can come in as you use Solar Beam, induce hail, and make you charge the move up. Oddish is then trapped, and Snover can OHKO it with 100% accuracy Blizzard thanks to hail. However, if you can predict a Snover switch-in, Oddish can OHKO Snover with Hidden Power Fire. Hippopotas can change the weather thanks to Sand Stream and halve Oddish's Speed. Oddish can put it to sleep with Sleep Powder, though. Lickitung and Munchlax sponge Oddish's powerful special attacks with their high Special Defense stats.

Solar Beam hits in one turn because of the sun, and thanks to STAB, it has a massive power of 180. This will hit any Pokemon that doesn't resist it extremely hard, except for a select few special sponges such as Lickitung and Munchlax. Hidden Power Fire is Oddish's secondary attack, and gets a 1.5x boost from the sun, giving it a power of 105. This is Oddish's only attack that hits Steel-type Pokemon super effectively, as they resist Solar Beam and are immune to Sludge Bomb. It is also useful against Grass-type Pokemon, as many of them have Poison as their secondary type, namely Bulbasaur, Bellsprout, Oddish, and Budew. Sludge Bomb is Oddish's second most powerful attack other than Solar Beam. Coverage-wise, it hits Fire- and Dragon-types, and it can be used outside of sun. Sleep Powder is a great alternative to Sludge Bomb, allowing Oddish to put a member of the opponent's team to sleep and then take free shots at them. Sleep Powder's prime use is to put the opponents sun counters to sleep, should they carry any.</p> <p>Attacking-wise, there isn't much else that Oddish can run on the set, as the moves listed are its best options. However, there are a few alternatives that you can run in the last slot. Stun Spore can be used to cut the Speed of faster Pokemon. Synthesis can be used for reliable recovery in the sun. When equipped with an Eviolite, Oddish takes on the role of a bulky sweeper. If you decide to run an Eviolite, an EV spread of 156 HP / 236 SpA / 116 Spe with a Modest nature is recommended. This spread gives Oddish added bulk while maximizing its Special Attack. You should also make use of Synthesis for recovery if you choose this spread.</p> <p>Stealth Rock support is appreciated to weaken Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon, giving Oddish an easier time sweeping against Pokemon such as Houndour. Stealth Rock is also useful for beating Snover, as it takes 25% every time it comes in to induce hail. Fighting-types, such as Mienfoo and Croagunk, are good partners because they can counter Munchlax and Lickitung, who would otherwise sponge Oddish's special attacks with ease. Wynaut makes a great teammate as well, since it has the ability to trap Snover, which is the biggest counter to sun sweepers.</p> "

With the changes in sleep mechanics that BW brought, Paras's ability to help other Pokemon and set itself up with little risk is not just unique, but also useful. Paras's good defenses and Attack, along with its excellent STAB and support moves, makes it a very good Pokemon in the Little Cup metagame. Its Dry Skin ability makes it immune to Water-type moves, giving it ample opportunity to switch in for free and set up.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Paras could a run a good special set, due to its wide movepool (including Energy Ball and Sludge Bomb) and decent Special Attack. However, this is usually better accomplished by Shroomish, which has better defenses. Psybeam can be used on both sets to OHKO Croagunk, a Pokemon which can cause problems for Paras.</p> <p>Paras can also utilize support moves such as Light Screen and Aromatherapy, which could allow it to pull off a defensive or support set. However, this is, once again, done better by other Pokemon. While Dry Skin is the preferred ability on Paras, Effect Spore could also be used to help spread status. This would be particularly effective with Paras's low Speed.</p> <p>Paras also has the potential to run both Swords Dance and Choice Band sets, with strong physical STAB moves and access to Pursuit and Spore. Similar to the Agility set, Paras would utilize Spore to set up multiple Swords Dance boosts and attempt a sweep. This would work best with recovery and Eviolite due to the fact that most of Paras's counters will be able to outspeed it. In terms of a Choice Band set, Paras could make use of Pursuit and its STAB moves to deal heavy damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Paras can be quite difficult to completely counter, due to its access to Spore. Most potential counters are easily incapacitated by sleep. This makes Pokemon who don't fear sleep moves and can KO in retaliation excellent counters. Doduo and Houndour are the prime examples, as Early Bird means sleep is less crippling to them. Houndour does have a better ability in Flash Fire, though. Additionally, thanks to its status Orb, Taillow is also a good counter. If Sleep Clause is active, most of Paras's counters will not have to fear Spore. Most Steel-types do not fear Paras's STAB attacks. However, with the exception of Aron, they cannot do much in return. Croagunk resists both of Paras's STABs and can use its strong priority moves to KO Paras in return, but needs to watch out for Spore.</p> <p>Fortunately, revenge killing Paras is easy. Any Fire-type with decent Speed, such as Magby, Ponyta, and Choice Scarf Houndour, can outspeed Paras and OHKO it with super effective Fire-type moves.

This set attempts to use all of Paras's strengths to its advantage: its good Attack and defenses, Spore, and its access to reliable recovery.</p> <p>This set can be used to take out troublesome Pokemon, as well as help set up other Pokemon due to the switching that it forces. Paras is the best user of Spore out of the small pool of Pokemon that learn it. Bug Bite is a good STAB option, since it allows Paras to heal itself using the opponent's Berry. Bullet Seed hits through Substitute, Focus Sash, and Sturdy, causing significant damage over several hits, whilst Synthesis is Paras's only reliable recovery move.</p> <p>Paras can attempt a double status set by using Stun Spore in the last slot. Stun Spore takes advantage of the switches that Spore causes, allowing Paras to either hit an incoming opponent hard using its STAB moves or cripple it with status, rendering it useless. Due to the fact that Paras resists most priority attacks, it can take advantage of the paralysis it spreads and outspeed Pokemon which it would normally have difficulty beating. X-Scissor is a stronger STAB option for the second moveslot if you feel that Paras does not need the added boost provided by Berries or you dislike using the prediction involved in getting the boosts.</p> <p>Oran Berry is the better item if you choose to run Stun Spore over Synthesis, as it gives Paras a form of recovery.

In fact, Meowth's niche in competitive Pokemon is not only small, but also outclassed by other Pokemon, making Meowth a rare sight in today's metagame. However, it does possess a few traits that make it stand out; most notably, its ability Technician, which boosts the power of its relatively weak attacks so that it can suffice as a physical attacker. Its above average Speed does give Meowth a leg up stat wise even when its other stats don't, letting it function as a hit and run attacker with Fake Out and U-turn. The transition into BW2 also gave Meowth Covet, which is a useful move that can be used to steal the Eviolite off of opponents and 'cripple' them for the rest of the match. However, Meowth is lacking or outclassed in almost every other regard. It is extremely frail, weak to priority, and its low Attack really isn't anything to bet on, even with the Technician boost. Even within its niche, Meowth faces tough competition—other Fake Out users such as Mienfoo or Croagunk possess greater power and bulk, making them more ideal hit and run pivots. The competition is especially tough with Aipom, which can Fake Out and U-turn relatively quickly with greater power as well, and only lacks Covet and Bite.

A Nasty Plot set with moves such as Swift or a 60 Base Power Hidden Power could also work, but would not work very well, as, again, Meowth's defenses are not solid enough for it to setup.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Because of Meowth's tendency to U-turn a lot, it could be hard to fully trap and take it down, but its weak attacks mean that it is relatively easy to wall. Steel-, Rock-, and bulky Ghost-types are Meowth's worst nightmare. None of them really care about Fake Out or Meowth's Normal-type STAB and can often hit it for a lot of damage due to Meowth's frailty. Ferroseed is a great counter to Meowth. Not only does it resist Meowth's Normal-type STAB, but it can also punish Meowth's attacks with Iron Barbs, as well as set up entry hazards to damage Meowth every time it switches in. Magnemite is a good check as well; it easily sponges Meowth's attacks and can hit it hard with powerful special attacks. It can also pivot in the face of a U-turn switch-in and grab momentum for its team. Bronzor is a good answer too, as it can hit Meowth hard with Gyro Ball, but it doesn't like getting its item taken away. Bulky Ghost-types such as Frillish or Misdreavus are good checks because they can sponge a Bite or two and reply by crippling Meowth, or just hitting it hard. Pokemon that are bulky and equally fast, such as Misdreavus and Ponyta, can tie with Meowth and possibly take it down before it U-turns. Finally, Pokemon with priority Fighting-type STAB, such as Timburr and Croagunk, can hit Meowth super effectively and take it down in one swift move.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Technician is what makes Meowth's low Attack usable by boosting the power of its attacks. Technician-boosted Fake Out is what makes this set shine, hitting a solid 135 Base Power when boosted by STAB, Technician, and Normal Gem, or a good 117 Base Power with Life Orb. U-turn comes next, letting Meowth pivot out after using its Fake Out. This embodies the hit-and-run strategy, as Meowth can often escape unscratched thanks to its high Speed. The next two moves are dependent on what Meowth is set out to do. Covet is the optimal choice for Meowth as it hits for a fair amount of damage and also steals the opponent's item after Fake Out burns Meowth's Normal Gem. It's also almost as powerful as Return, which is another attack Meowth can use in the second slot. Return doesn't have any secondary effects, but it's a lot more powerful than Covet, especially when boosted by Life Orb, which should be used if it is not necessary for Meowth to lose its item. Bite is used in the last slot to hit Ghost-types, and gets Technician-boosted to a Base Power of 90, which is enough to OHKO or 2HKO many Ghost- and Psychic-types found in LC, such as Misdreavus or Abra.</p> <p>The EVs are spread out to give Meowth as much offensive presence as possible. They first concentrate on Meowth's Speed, as Meowth needs to be able to outspeed as many opponents as possible so it can avoid attacks as it pivots with U-turn. Then, the EVs are invested in Attack to maximize Meowth's meager power. The remaining EVs go into Defense so Meowth can take weak hits when necessary.</p> <p>Taunt is another option for Meowth, as it can be used to prevent opposing Pokemon from setting up. Meowth's item depends on which moves it uses. If you choose to use Return, a Life Orb is recommended, as it provides Meowth with a sizable boost in power. If you do use a Life Orb, 0 HP IVs are also recommended because it lowers Life Orb recoil to only 1 HP. If you choose to use Covet, a Normal Gem should be used, as it lets Meowth \"get rid of\" its item so it can steal an opponent's with Covet while also boosting the power of its first Fake Out.</p> <p>Because of the hit-and-run playstyle, it enjoys the accompaniment of entry hazards and other more defensive pivots, as well as Pokemon that can take down Steel-, Rock-, and bulky Ghost-type walls. Magnemite gets a mention as it can form a VoltTurn core with Meowth and trap Steel-types that wall and are baited by Meowth. It can also hit Rock-types hard with Flash Cannon. Meowth in turn can steal the Eviolite of special walls to help Magnemite have an easier time getting past them. Larvesta is also a good partner, as it can sponge Fighting-type moves for Meowth, pivot with U-turn, and tackle Steel-types with Flare Blitz. Fighting-types are often great partners as well, as they can remove Steel- and Rock-types with their Fighting-type STAB. Mienfoo is especially good when paired with Meowth as it can sponge some Fighting-type moves, form a dual pivoting and Fake Out core to annoy the opponent, and take out the aforementioned Steel- and Rock-types that wall Meowth. Ground-types are also often great partners; Drilbur and Hippopotas can both set Stealth Rock and hit Rock- and Steel-types super effectively with Earthquake. Drilbur can also spin away entry hazards that annoy Meowth's pivoting process.</p> "

  "Psyduck": {
    "overview": "<p>Psyduck seems to be just a standard Water-type on the surface, but below that lies an interesting difference. Psyduck is one of the few Pokemon with the Cloud Nine ability, allowing safe revenge killing of threats such as Drilbur. Psyduck is fast enough to use a Choice Scarf as it reaches 14 Speed unboosted, and it has a good movepool to hit opponents with. Sadly, it's not all good news for Psyduck. Its stats are a bit lacking, and most of what it can do would be horribly outclassed if not for its situational ability. Overall, Psyduck is an interesting option, if only for the fact that it is a safe choice to KO the important Drilbur.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Psyduck has a large amount of other options to consider. Calm Mind could be used to set up, but it's not recommended, as Lickitung is the better bulky Cloud Nine user. Psychic or Psyshock are options to hit Croagunk, but it doesn't hit much else since Hydro Pump does the same amount of damage to Fighting-types otherwise. Hidden Power Electric is there if Mantyke is a major problem, but it misses out on hitting Chinchou, making it inferior. Psyduck learns Hone Claws and has a good physical movepool, including Waterfall, Ice Punch, Dig, Cross Chop, Brick Break, and Zen Headbutt. Other Pokemon are better at this, but it has the surprise factor at least. Scald could be used as a STAB move on a defensive set for the added burn chance, but is too weak for offensive sets. Rain Dance and Swift Swim could always be used, but there are plenty of better Pokemon for that.</p> <p>Psyduck also has plenty of defensive options to consider. Hypnosis could put a potential check to sleep, but has terrible accuracy, making it quite risky. Psych Up could be used against other Calm Mind users, but has little utility otherwise. Disable can stop weaker opponents that only have one move to hit Psyduck with, but is situational at best. Amnesia boosts Psyduck's Special Defense, but Calm Mind boosts Special Attack as well and is usually superior. Toxic could inflict poison on bulky Pokemon such as Slowpoke and Frillish. Psyduck could use Light Screen, but it doesn't learn Reflect so it's better off being used by another Pokemon. Yawn is more accurate than Hypnosis, but takes two turns to take effect; it is an interesting option to phaze, however. Confuse Ray could cause serious problems with some luck. Finally, Magic Coat is good on basically everything that learns it, and Psyduck is no exception.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Chinchou is a good check, as it can safely come in on anything but Hidden Power Grass or Mud Bomb and threaten Psyduck with STAB Electric-type moves. Ferroseed can't take Hidden Power Fire, but is safe coming in on any other move and can attack or just set up Spikes. Dratini is good against any move other than Ice Beam and can proceed to set up a Dragon Dance. Mantyke can stall Psyduck out barring Hidden Power Electric, which is rare. If none of these options are left, Psyduck is also weak to priority and can be revenged by faster Choice Scarf users as well.</p> ",

Hydro Pump is the preferred STAB move due to its power, but Surf is viable for its accuracy. Ice Beam hits Dragon- and Grass-types. In the third slot, Hidden Power Fire is preferred, as it deals with the important Ferroseed and Snover. Hidden Power Grass is an option, however, if the team has problems with Water-types. In the last slot, Signal Beam is used for extra coverage, hitting Slowpoke, which is useful if using Hidden Power Fire, and also hitting Snover, which is important if using Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p>Psyduck could use a Timid nature for the extra Speed, but the power drop is unwelcome. Mud Bomb could be used if running Hidden Power Fire for hitting Chinchou, but Psyduck loses a bit of coverage by doing so. If not using Mud Bomb or Hidden Power Grass, Chinchou can come in on any of Psyduck's moves and force it out. Ferroseed is a good teammate for Psyduck to beat Chinchou that lack Hidden Power Fire, while Dratini works against versions lacking Ice Beam. Mantyke also easily takes anything that Psyduck dishes out, meaning that a Chinchou of your own works well alongside Psyduck. Houndour and Ponyta are good options as well, having excellent synergy with Psyduck, especially when used with a Grass-type such as Ferroseed or Lileep, forming a Fire / Water / Grass core.</p> "

  "Mankey": {
    "overview": "<p>Mankey is a very uncommon, albeit underrated, threat in the LC metagame. This is rather surprising, as Mankey hits hard with an amazing base 80 Attack, and thanks to its high Speed stat, it is also able to Speed tie with many top-tier threats, including Chinchou and Mienfoo. Mankey also has decent abilities in Defiant and Vital Spirit, both of which help it sweep more efficiently when Mankey is matched up against Intimidate users, such as Growlithe, and sleep inducers, such as Shroomish. With these traits, Mankey becomes a powerful revenge killer when holding a Choice Scarf. Mankey can effectively run a Substitute + Encore set as well, thanks to its high Speed stat and Anger Point. Unfortunately, Mankey's defenses are absolutely terrible, meaning that almost any hit can easily take it down. The primary reason why Mankey is rarely seen is because it lives in the shadows of Mienfoo, which has much better bulk, a better ability in Regenerator, a more powerful STAB move in High Jump Kick, and a higher Attack. In fact, the only reasons to use Mankey over Mienfoo are its ability, Vital Spirit, and its access to decent support moves such as Encore.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mankey has quite a few other options to consider. An all-out offensive set with a Life Orb can be used, as Mankey boasts a high Speed stat and a decent movepool. Cross Chop is an alternative STAB move that Mankey can use over Close Combat if you are too worried about the latter's Defense and Special Defense drops. However, the power difference between Close Combat and Cross Chop is quite noticeable. Moreover, Cross Chop's low accuracy makes it a much less reliable alternative to Close Combat when it comes to revenge killing. A Flying Gem and Acrobatics can be used over Choice Scarf and Ice Punch to hit Grass-types harder than Mankey's other moves would, but other Pokemon, such as Drifloon, can run this type of set better. Earthquake is a powerful move that gives super effective coverage against Poison- and Electric-types, such as Croagunk and Chinchou. Seed Bomb is an interesting move that can hit Chinchou along with Staryu. Hone Claws and Bulk Up are two viable boosting moves: the former increases Mankey's Attack and accuracy, while the latter increases Mankey's Attack and Defense. However, Mankey is hard-pressed to set up reliably due to its low defenses. Retaliate is a strong option for a revenge killer, as its power doubles when used the turn after a teammate is KOed. A Substitute + Encore set can be used with an Oran Berry and an EV spread of 196 HP / 36 Atk / 76 Def / 196 Spe. This set's goal is to repeatedly set up Substitutes, hoping for a critical hit, so that Mankey's Attack boosts to +6 courtesy of Anger Point. Thanks to Encore, this set can also mess with Pokemon that think it's safe to set up on Mankey, such as Nasty Plot Misdreavus.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Because Mankey's defenses are very poor, countering it isn't a difficult task. Natu is arguably the best counter to Mankey, as it boasts a 4x resistance to Mankey's Fighting-type STAB, and thanks to its Flying typing, it can OHKO Mankey with a STAB Hidden Power Flying. Physical walls such as Slowpoke and Hippopotas are great checks to Mankey. Slowpoke's Psychic typing, coupled with its high Defense boosted by Eviolite, allows it to take Mankey's STAB move with ease and OHKO it with Psychic. Hippopotas, on the other hand, can take two Close Combats thanks to its high physical bulk; it can also KO Mankey with a STAB Earthquake once Mankey's defenses have been lowered by Close Combat. If Mankey chooses not to run Vital Spirit, Shroomish can cripple it with Spore and can also wear it down with STAB Giga Drain. Koffing can easily take on Mankey, as it resists Close Combat and is able to cripple Mankey with Will-O-Wisp. Larvesta can take any hit Mankey throws at it bar Rock Slide and OHKO it with Flare Blitz. Larvesta also has a decent chance of burning Mankey with Flame Body. Vullaby is bulky enough to take a few Close Combats and can OHKO Mankey with Air Slash. Bulky Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus, also trouble Mankey, as they are immune to Close Combat and can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Croagunk can wall Mankey for ages, as it resists most of Mankey's moves and is able to KO it with a combination of Drain Punch and Vacuum Wave.</p> <p>Although it cannot directly switch into any of Mankey's moves, Choice Scarf Taillow is a good check to Mankey, as it can outspeed and OHKO it with STAB Brave Bird. Similarly, other Choice Scarf users, such as Diglett, can take out Mankey quickly if they are able to outspeed it. Abra is a good counter to Mankey; it can switch into Close Combats, outspeed it, and subsequently OHKO it with STAB super effective Psychic. Drilbur in sandstorm can outspeed even Choice Scarf Mankey and OHKO it with Earthquake. As Drifloon is immune to Fighting-type moves, it can easily switch into Mankey and OHKO it with Acrobatics. It should be noted that Drifloon is able to outspeed Choice Scarf Mankey when Unburden is activated. Tirtouga can survive one of Mankey's hits thanks to Sturdy and can then either set up with Shell Smash or KO Mankey with Aqua Tail. Because Mankey is very frail, priority moves can severely hamper its sweep.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>This set is the only set Mankey can run without being outclassed by Mienfoo, which sports better offenses and defenses. With high Speed and Attack, Mankey can effectively run a Choice Scarf set. Close Combat is Mankey's most reliable STAB move and hits everything that doesn't resist it hard. Unfortunately, as Close Combat lowers Mankey's already terrible defenses, it is more prone to getting OHKOed by almost every move it does not resist. U-turn is a great scouting move that can instantly gain momentum for your team. Punishment hits Psychic- and Ghost-types that can switch into Close Combats with impunity, such as Natu and Misdreavus, for a good amount of damage. In fact, Punishment is the only move Mankey threatens Misdreavus with, and as Misdreavus is very common in the current LC metagame, Punishment is an important move to have. Final Gambit is a very gimmicky move that allows Mankey to score a quick KO on an opposing Pokemon. However, Final Gambit is only effective when Mankey is at or near full health. Alternatively, Ice Punch provides coverage against Flying- and Grass-types and also has a chance to freeze the opponent.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Mankey's Attack and Speed, which, in turn, maximizes its sweeping capabilities. A Jolly nature gives Mankey enough Speed to outrun Modest Choice Scarf Chinchou and Adamant Choice Scarf Mienfoo. An Adamant nature increases Mankey's Attack, allowing it to OHKO Omanyte and Munchlax with Close Combat after Stealth Rock damage. Mankey has three excellent abilities, all of which are viable. Vital Spirit is an amazing ability, as it prevents sleep inducers, such as Shroomish, from putting Mankey to sleep. Defiant is helpful against Intimidate users and Feather Dance Natu, as it gives Mankey a free Attack boost. However, there are not many Intimidate users in the LC metagame, so its use is situational. Anger Point boosts Mankey's Attack to +6 when hit by a critical hit, but most of the time, Mankey won't survive one. In terms of alternative moves, Rock Slide is an option over Final Gambit or Ice Punch for super effective coverage against Fire- and Bug-types, such as Shelmet and Larvesta. Because Beat Up is a multi-hit move, it can be used over Punishment to beat Pokemon that carry Substitute, such as Misdreavus.</p> <p>Mankey needs a lot of team support in order to be able to sweep. Dwebble and Ferroseed are excellent teammates, as they can set up Spikes and Stealth Rock, which give Mankey OHKOs on certain Pokemon. For example, Mankey is able to OHKO Ferroseed and Lileep with Close Combat after 3 layers of Spikes damage. Mankey can be paired with a Volt Switch user such as Chinchou to form the famous and effective VoltTurn combo, which helps keep offensive momentum, especially when entry hazards have been laid on the opposing side of the field. As Mankey is affected by all forms of entry hazards, Rapid Spin or Magic Bounce users, such as Drilbur, Staryu, and Natu, make for good teammates, as they can prevent entry hazards from being set up. Misdreavus is a huge threat to Mankey, so Pokemon that can take it on, such as Vullaby, are very helpful, as Misdreavus is extremely common in LC. Dual screens support from the likes of Natu is needed, as Mankey possesses terrible defenses. Bronzor with Hidden Power Ice is a great teammate, as it can set up dual screens and Stealth Rock and can also take on Vullaby.</p> "

Growlithe is a rather unappreciated Fire-type simply for the reason that it's outclassed by every other Fire-type available. Ponyta and Darumaka are better physical attackers, and Houndour is a better special attacker. Even as a wall, it still faces trouble due to Fire being a bad defensive typing. However, Growlithe is an excellent defensive check to physical attackers thanks to the combination of Intimidate and Will-o-Wisp, which provides a double Attack drop for threats that stay in. Don't underestimate Growlithe, because his bite is worse than his bark.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Growlithe can't really do much without being outclassed by another Fire-type. Flash Fire can help if you are weak to Fire-types, but it faces massive competition from Ponyta in that role. Flame Charge can also be used to increase Growlithe's Speed and attempt to sweep, but Growlithe's niche is defensive, not offensive. Sunny Day can also help to increase the power of Flare Blitz and improve Morning Sun's recovery, while possibly stopping opposing sand teams. Lastly, Flamethrower and Fire Blast are viable but weaker attacking options should you dislike Flare Blitz's recoil or wish to attack physically defensive threats more effectively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Growlithe isn't that hard to counter, as it is rather weak. There are several Water-types that can survive a Wild Charge and retaliate back with a super effective Water-type move. The Pokemon that stands out here is Chinchou, which is immune to Wild Charge and resistant to Flare Blitz. Growlithe also struggles against sand teams, as it is weak to Earthquake. Stone Edge Mienfoo may surprise Growlithe attempting to wall it. Lastly, Timburr can set up on Growlithe while gaining a boost from Will-O-Wisp thanks to Guts.</p> ",

The rest of the EVs are placed in Attack to damage the opponent as much as possible with Growlithe's STAB and coverage move. Growlithe is greatly troubled by Stealth Rock, making a spinner almost mandatory when including Growlithe on your team. Staryu works best here because it also helps Growlithe deal with Ground- and Rock-types. Growlithe is also rather weak to sand teams; as Snover hampers Growlithe's recovery, Shroomish instead works as an excellent partner to Growlithe to check sand teams without hampering its recovery.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Poliwag is a very strong little tadpole. He is one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, reaching a maximum 19 Speed. He can fit into many roles on a team from being a special attacker, to a Choice item Pokemon, to even being an effective Belly Drum user. Poliwag has a rather shallow offensive movepool, but his deep support movepool more than makes up for it. He may be relatively frail, but with his blistering Speed, Poliwag can be a force to be reckoned with.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>On the Belly Drum set, you could opt for Encore over Hypnosis to let Poliwag Encore a Water- or Ice-type attack and proceed to Belly Drum. With the new Encore mechanics, however, this can be less effective as Encore now does not last as long. It is also very risky compared to Hypnosis as Poliwag doesn't really want to take any damage before he sets up with Belly Drum. Poliwag also has a relatively deep support movepool with moves such as Toxic, Rain Dance, Haze, Hail, Endeavor, and Swagger. Poliwag also has the move Wake-Up Slap, which has a chance to KO sleeping Munchlax with maximum Attack EVs. Poliwag can run a Substitute + 3 attacks set, or a Substitute + Encore set, but he really doesn't have the bulk to take any hits behind a Substitute.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>There are a few counters to Poliwag. The best counter to the special attacker set is Ferroseed, which resists all of Poliwag's attacks, barring Ice Beam, which won't do much to it anyway; in return, it can OHKO Poliwag with Bullet Seed. Ferroseed is also a great counter to the BellyWag set considering it resists all of Poliwag's attacks. Frillish is also a hard counter to BellyWag because it, too, resists all of Poliwag's attacks. Choice Scarf Chinchou can switch in and OHKO Poliwag with its STAB Thunderbolt; however, it cannot survive a +6 Return, so it can only safely revenge kill outside of rain. The special attacker set has a lot of trouble breaking through most bulky Pokemon as Poliwag only has mediocre Special Attack; this lack of power will make Poliwag setup bait for the likes of Vullaby. The BellyWag set is also relatively weak to priority users, namely Croagunk and Timburr. Choice Scarf Snover is another check to this set because it can revenge kill with Giga Drain. Unaware Wooper bypasses the Belly Drum boost and can KO with Earthquake. Dratini resists Water-type attacks and can easily beat Poliwag with Extreme Speed or set up in his face with Dragon Dance.</p> ",

Though Poliwag might seem to be outclassed by other Water-types such as Staryu and Chinchou, he has something that the other's do not: Hypnosis. Hypnosis is extremely useful, as it can sleep slower threats that could potentially sweep your team. Hydro Pump is Poliwag's main STAB move and can dish out a lot of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Surf can be used over Hydro Pump if you prefer reliability to power, but in most cases, Poliwag really needs all the power he can get. Ice Beam is used to beat Grass-types and Dragon-types which resist Hydro Pump. Hidden Power Grass is there for Water-type threats such as Chinchou which resist both Hydro Pump and Ice Beam.</p> <p>Life Orb is the preferred item because Poliwag needs the extra damage output, but Eviolite can be used for some added bulk. The given EV spread maximizes Poliwag's Speed and Special Attack while giving him one point of bulk on Defense and Special Defense. If you opt to use Rain Dance in the last slot over Hypnosis, then change the ability to Swift Swim. Rain Dance is a viable option because it hugely boosts Poliwag's Water-type attacks, and also gives him a Speed stat of 36. Another option is using Choice Specs, which will give Poliwag a bigger boost in Special Attack than Life Orb does, but Poliwag doesn't get to switch moves and will be easier to predict.</p> <p>Ferroseed easily counters this set by resisting all of Poliwag's attacks barring Ice Beam and KOing him back with Bullet Seed. Hidden Power Fire is a decent alternative to Hidden Power Grass to KO Snover and Ferroseed, but doesn't see much use outside of that. Magnemite is a great partner for Poliwag because it can trap and beat Ferroseed with Hidden Power Fire.</p> "

Though this set is very risky, if you manage to pull it off, the reward will be tremendous. After a single Belly Drum, Poliwag gets +6 Attack, and coupled with his blistering 19 Speed, you have a real scary tadpole on your hands. The given moveset is only resisted by Ferroseed and Frillish, which should both be dealt with before attempting to set up. Waterfall is the main STAB move and has a 20% chance of causing a flinch, which is a nice bonus. Return is the best option for the second attack because it lets Poliwag hit the entire metagame neutrally except for Ferroseed and Frillish. Hypnosis is the best option for the last slot to let Poliwag sleep anything slower than him, allowing him to get a free Belly Drum up.</p> <p>Oran Berry is the best option for an item because it heals Poliwag when he reaches 50% of its health. This works especially well with Belly Drum because as he uses it, he loses 50% of his health, which activates Oran Berry. A Jolly nature is preferred because Poliwag needs all the Speed he can get if he wants to maximize his sweeping capabilities. The given EV spread is used to maximize Poliwag's Speed, as well as his Attack. The other EVs are used to give Poliwag another point in his Defense and Special Defense.</p> <p>Any Pokemon with priority will beat this set into the ground. As Poliwag is so frail, he won't be able to take any attacks before he can use Belly Drum. Ferroseed easily beats this set because it resists both the main attacks and can KO back with Bullet Seed. BellyWag really likes Stealth Rock support, as it can break Focus Sashes, so Poliwag can KO things without worrying about them. Rain Dance can be helpful because it activates Poliwag's Swift Swim, and gives Waterfall a nice power boost. Pretty much any Choice Scarf user that carries an Electric- or Grass-type attack can counter Poliwag; an example of this is Choice Scarf Chinchou, which outruns Poliwag and OHKOes with Thunderbolt. As Poliwag needs as much of his health as possible when he switches in, spinners such as Baltoy and Sandshrew are good teammates. Sandshrew can set up Stealth Rock to support Poliwag's sweep as well. Aside from laying Stealth Rock, Baltoy can also set up dual screens, which make it much easier for Poliwag to take a hit. Wynaut is a good teammate for BellyWag because it can trap priority users, most notably Timburr and Croagunk, and KO them with Counter or Mirror Coat. Dig is also a decent move to use on this set to hit Frillish and Ferroseed neutrally. Remember, Poliwag only gets one shot at this sweep, so make sure you pick a good time to use him.</p> "

  "Machop": {
    "overview": "<p>In a tier where competition in Mienfoo, Croagunk, and even Timburr is prominent and checks such as Misdreavus are common, it's hard for Machop to stand out. Machop doesn't have any outstanding stats other than its Attack, which still isn't all that high and is overshadowed by its relatively low Speed and Special Defense. However, its ability and movepool let it fill a unique niche that makes it both powerful and hard to take down. Its magnificent ability in No Guard and access to Dynamic Punch makes it a destructive offensive force—not only hitting much of the metagame for massive amounts of damage but also confusing the foe in the process. Also, despite its low Special Defense, Machop is still no defensive slouch—it has good Defense when compared to most other LC Pokemon, letting it tank a few hits if needed, boosting its longevity and the amount of overall damage it can inflict. It is lacking in the Speed department, but it is also in no way slow, hitting the magical 14 Speed which lets it outspeed every non-boosted opponent when equipped with a Choice Scarf. Despite its downsides and its competition, Machop is worth a slot on many offensive teams with its outstanding Attack, a unique and destructive niche, quite a lot of bulk, and just good enough Speed.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Machop can also run an effective Guts set, but this is outclassed by Timburr thanks to its superior bulk. A Bulk Up set could also work, but this too is outclassed by Timburr, which is bulkier, just as powerful, and has the ability to recover health with Drain Punch or hit hard with STAB priority. Machop can also use an effective SubPunch set, as Focus Punch is immensely powerful, making Machop an even scarier threat, while Substitute also lets Machop defeat faster Ghost and Psychic-types, giving it a free turn to hit them with Payback. Machop also gets Encore, which can give it opportunities to set up or force a switch and smack something hard with Dynamic Punch or Close Combat.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Dynamic Punch's power and side effect of confusion makes Machop quite hard to take down initially, as anything that switches in that is not immune to Dynamic Punch will find a sizeable portion of its HP taken off and become confused in process. Despite this, Machop's low Speed and Special Defense make it fairly easy to revenge kill. Also, Machop's reliance on its Fighting-type STAB to really hit hard makes it easy for Ghost-types and other Pokemon that resist Fighting to take Machop down. Ghost-types such as Misdreavus or Frillish excel at countering Machop for this reason. Misdreavus is a good counter to Machop because it doesn't have anything to fear from Dynamic Punch's confusion shenanigans, can 2HKO with Shadow Ball, and sponge one Payback if at high enough health. Frillish is another good counter as it moves after Machop, so it doesn't fear Payback and is immune to its Fighting-type STAB. As a plus, it can burn Machop with a perfectly accurate Will-O-Wisp due to No Guard. Psychic-types, such as Natu or Slowpoke, are great counters too. Natu is a notable one, as it can not only hit Machop's weaker Special Defense with Hidden Power Flying, but it can also use Feather Dance to lower Machop's Attack and make it too weak to deal any damage. Additionally, it can Roost off any damage sustained by Payback. Poison-types are also great counters, as they resist Machop's Fighting-type STAB and are usually not hit very hard by any of its other moves. Croagunk can wall Machop all day, but it has to watch out for Dynamic Punch confusion. Foongus also walls Machop, as it can recover off any confusion damage with Regenerator and put Machop to sleep with Spore. Bug-types are nice checks as well; Larvesta resists Machop's Fighting-type STAB and can hit Machop hard with Flare Blitz. Furthermore, it can burn Machop with Will-O-Wisp.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Machop doesn't lack power or bulk, although it does lack Speed. This can be made up for with a Choice Scarf, turning Machop into a quick, destructive attacker that is great at wallbreaking. Because it hits the coveted 14 Speed, Machop can outpace every non-boosted opponent and spam its powerful Dynamic Punch with relatively few drawbacks because of No Guard, which makes all of its moves hit with perfect accuracy. Machop's access to a perfectly accurate Dynamic Punch makes it hard to counter because it hits like a truck and confuses its opponents, making it tough for them to be able to hit back without taking a ton of damage in the process. Dynamic Punch is all Machop really needs to deal damage, so the rest of the moves are used for coverage purposes. Payback hits Ghost- and Psychic-types fairly hard, and even though its power is halved because Machop always goes first, Machop always gets two shots to hit its opponent anyway, so the end result is still the same. Ice Punch hits Flying-types such as Natu and Vullaby, Bug-types such as Joltik, and Grass-types such as Foongus harder than Payback. Rock Slide is used in the last slot to hit Bug- and Flying-type Pokemon, such as Larvesta and Shelmet, eliminating them as checks.</p> <p>The given EVs maximize Machop's Speed and Attack, giving it the tools it needs to do its job. Then, the EVs are split between HP and Defense to give Machop a fair amount of bulk so it can take the hits of opposing walls. Machop should always use No Guard because it lets Machop utilize the powerful Dynamic Punch to deal damage. Bullet Punch can also be used instead of a coverage move because it has priority and can hit even faster threats once they are weakened, but Bullet Punch is fairly weak as it is not boosted by STAB.</p> <p>In terms of teammates, Machop appreciates the removal of Ghost-, Flying-, Poison-, Bug-, and Psychic-types, as well as the removal of other physically bulky Pokemon. Vullaby is a solid teammate, as it can check Ghost-, Psychic-, and Bug-types with its Dark- and Flying-type coverage. It also hits Natu fairly hard as well. Houndour is another great partner, as it can Pursuit trap Ghost- and Psychic-types as well as roast Bug-types with its Fire-type STAB. Houndour also appreciates Machop's ability to easily defeat Rock-type Pokemon in return. Misdreavus is a good teammate as well, as it too can remove Ghost- and Psychic-types. Its powerful special attacks also let it muscle past physical walls that give Machop trouble. Machop, in return, can remove Normal- and Dark-type Pokemon that check Misdreavus. Chinchou also has some good synergy with Machop, as it can wall Flying-types and hit physical walls with special attacks. Its access to Volt Switch can also give Machop an opportunity to switch in. Another thing Machop appreciates is entry hazard support, as it forces so many switches with the threat of a powerful Dynamic Punch. Drilbur comes to mind, as it can set up Stealth Rock and also soft check Poison-, Bug-, and Flying-types with a combination of Earthquake and Rock Slide for coverage. Anorith is another great partner, as it can set up Stealth Rock, spin away entry hazards, and hit Flying-, Bug-, and Psychic-types hard with its Rock- and Bug-type STABs.</p> "

Its ability, Chlorophyll, doubles its Speed during sunshine. This allows it to outspeed any non-Choice Scarf user. The main thing that sets it apart from other sun sweepers is that it has a high Attack, which makes it the only physical sun sweeper, and also the only sun sweeper to effectively run a mixed set. On the other hand, it has lower defenses and therefore is easily KOed if it does not KO the opposing Pokemon first. Bellsprout is a strong addition to any sun team and is an unpredictable sweeper.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Obviously, Sunny Day is an alternative that should seriously be considered alongside Bellsprout's moves; if not, Munchlax is a crucial teammate that provides the bulk and Sunny Day that Bellsprout requires in a teammate. Among the list of things that help Bellsprout sweep, entry hazards are up there as they provide much needed support. Bellsprout is an effective late game sweeper when the enemy team and its counters are weakened, and can also act as a revenge killer by using Sucker Punch against weaker opponents. Bellsprout does learn Power Whip, but it is illegal with Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Bellsprout's Dream World ability, Gluttony, has been released, but Chlorophyll is still preferred due to Bellsprout's low Speed when not in the sun.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Hippopotas checks every set due to changing the weather to sandstorm, and it can also tank physical hits and threaten back with Earthquake as Bellsprout has weak defenses, making it an optimal counter for physically oriented sets. Snover can also check Bellsprout, changing the weather to hail and taking it out with an Ice move. Magnemite counters the physical set and any special set that does not have a Fire-type attack. If Bellsprout has 13 Speed and is in the sun, any Choice Scarf holder that has 18 Speed will reach 27 and outspeed it, whereas if Bellsprout has 14 Speed and is in the sun, Choice Scarf holders with 19 Speed will Speed tie at 28.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>There are two things to use on any sun team: Chlorophyll and Solar Beam. The most prevalent sun sweepers all have this in common, and Bellsprout is no exception. Chlorophyll doubles Bellsprout's low Speed, which only reaches 13 with a Modest nature. After the boost from Chlorophyll, Bellsprout reaches 26 Speed. Solar Beam is a beautiful 120 Base Power STAB attack that does not need the extra turn of charging up when the sun is strong. The best way for Bellsprout to deal with its counters is to put them to sleep; Sleep Powder works well despite shaky accuracy. The other slots go to rounding off coverage, because Solar Beam doesn't hit everything by itself. Sludge Bomb is a secondary STAB attack which hits many things for neutral damage. Weather Ball also gets a boost from sunlight, becoming a 100 Base Power Fire-type attack that hits Ferroseed and Magnemite which would otherwise wall the set. The best item to use is a Life Orb, which adds to the destructive power of Bellsprout. Sunny Day provides the support necessary for this set to work, as Chlorophyll, Solar Beam, and Weather Ball all depend on sunlight.</p> <p>A Sunny Day sweeper can only work when there is sun, so there are two possibilities. It can be used on Bellsprout on this set, or Munchlax can be used as a teammate. Munchlax is not only a good Pokemon to have in Little Cup, but also a useful Sunny Day user; its bulk and ability to take hits along with its access to Sunny Day make it the ideal partner. The choice of nature won't make a huge difference, but Modest is preferred because of the extra power. The extra Speed is only useful for outrunning Choice Scarf users, which can threaten Bellsprout due to its low defenses. The difference in the natures is minuscule: 17 Special Attack and 13 Speed with Modest nature, and 16 Special Attack and 14 Speed with a Timid nature. After the Chlorophyll boost, it reaches 26 or 28 Speed, the latter being a Timid nature. Growth raises Bellsprout's Special Attack further, hitting 25 after a single boost, or 34 with a Modest nature in sunlight! Hidden Power Fire can be used over Weather Ball for a Fire-type attack that will not change type when the weather switches. Hippopotas and Snover both cancel the sun out, and change the weather to sandstorm and hail respectively. Snover can be hit on the switch with Sludge Bomb, however. A Water- or Ice-type special attacker will alleviate Bellsprout of Hippopotas.</p> "

The presence of Sleep Powder gives Bellsprout the power to put a counter Pokemon to sleep. This is especially easy in Little Cup due to switching being particularly common.</p> <p>Sunny Day can be used on Bellsprout on this set to set up sunlight to activate Chlorophyll, or Munchlax can be used as a teammate.

A Jolly nature will add a point of Speed at the cost of one Attack. Its given EVs grant it maximum Attack while maintaining high levels of speed. The rest of the EVs are in Special Defense and HP. The lack of defensive power obviously means defensive support is necessary. Pokemon that can take hits from others, such as Slowpoke, will make good teammates to Bellsprout as it resists a majority of Bellsprout's weaknesses.

Its Attack and Special Attack stats are 17 and 14, respectively, before a Growth; 25 and 21 after a Growth without sunlight; and 34 and 28 after a Growth in sunlight, making it a hard hitting Pokemon.

Exeggcute is a useful Sunny Day lead as it can use Sunny Day followed by Explosion and not only take down the opponent's Pokemon, but also allow Bellsprout to come in.

It has Sucker Punch for Ghost-types, but many can predict around the move and either use Substitute or burn Geodude with Will-O-Wisp. Rock Blast hits Dwebble for super effective damage and breaks Sturdy and Substitute, but Stone Edge is a better move in almost every other case. Geodude has access to Rock Head and Double-Edge, but Sturdy is a better ability. It can use Flail alongside Sturdy, but Explosion does more damage, and Geodude's only priority attack is the unreliable Sucker Punch. It has Brick Break for dual screen users, but it doesn't get much, if any, additional coverage.

Bronzor is a decent check to Geodude as it is immune to Earthquake while resisting Stone Edge, but needs to watch for Fire Punch. Grass-types that resist Earthquake are usually good counters, as they can restore health from any damage by using Giga Drain, and Pokemon with Bullet Seed can usually KO Geodude through Sturdy. Shellder also works well with Icicle Spear, which breaks through Sturdy as well. Fighting-types threaten Geodude, as they resist Rock-type attacks and can KO with Drain Punch.</p> ",

Though at first it might seem that outclassed completely by Dwebble, it does have a couple of things that set it apart from its fellow Rock-type. The first thing is access to a STAB Earthquake, which provides Geodude with lethal coverage when used in tandem with Stone Edge. In addition, Geodude has higher overall Attack and Defense, which allow it to deal and take more damage before going down.

Stone Edge is an incredibly powerful STAB attack, giving Geodude excellent coverage and power, despite having poor accuracy. Fire Punch hits Grass-types more reliably than Stone Edge, as well as getting a super effective hit on both Ferroseed and Bronzor. Explosion allows Geodude to go out with a bang after it has completed its job, and will be Geodude's most powerful option for an attack despite the move's nerf. Sturdy is a very important ability, as it allows Geodude to almost always set up Rock Polish safely. For that reason, Oran Berry is the preferred item, as Life Orb would nullify Sturdy, one of the best reasons to use Geodude as a sweeper.</p> <p>Special sweepers are the best partners for this set as Geodude, if played correctly, can easily rip through unprepared teams. In addition, Pokemon that can remove Mienfoo are also good teammates, as it resists Stone Edge and can heal itself with Drain Punch, a 2HKO on Geodude. A Psychic-type is great for removing Fighting-types in general, and Abra is the fastest of all. Duskull is another good teammate as it's immune to two of Geodude's weaknesses and can spread burns with Will-O-Wisp. Pokemon with Aqua Jet beat this set without much trouble, and Seel and Squirtle have access to that move as well as Fake Out, allowing them to remove Sturdy and before finishing off Geodude with Aqua Jet. Adamant is the preferred nature, as it still allows Geodude to hit 22 Speed after a boost while getting more power, as Geodude should not be running Life Orb.

Poison Jab or Gunk Shot is the main STAB move on this set, being the classic \"accuracy vs. power\" dilemma. Gunk Shot can 2HKO even the bulkiest walls, such as Porygon and Lileep, with Stealth Rock and poison status, while every Fighting-type in the tier except Croagunk is 2HKOed without any residual damage. However, Poison Jab still nabs the 3HKO on all of the aforementioned threats, and has perfect accuracy to boot. Fire Punch hits Steel-types such as Pawniard, Bronzor, and Magnemite for good damage, while Shadow Sneak is a useful priority move, allowing Grimer to pick off Abra and weakened Misdreavus. Finally, Pain Split provides a form of recovery.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Grimer to maximize its Attack, while splitting the remaining EVs in its defenses, and an Impish nature allows Grimer to take physical hits better. Cranidos is a good partner, as Grimer can check the Fighting-types that can halt Cranidos' sweep. Grimer also forms a fine defensive core with Shroomish and Porygon, as it can take assaults from the Fighting-types that annoy this core, while Shroomish takes the Ground-type hits that would KO Grimer otherwise.</p> "

Thanks to its solid defenses and access to a reliable STAB in Poison Jab, Grimer can effectively sweep late-game; even defensive Misdreavus is 2HKOed at +6. Curse allows it to boost its Attack and Defense while lowering its already-abysmal Speed. Poison Jab is a reliable STAB, whose secondary effect of poisoning can always be useful. Rest and Sleep Talk provide Grimer with a semi-reliable form of recovery, allowing it to stay healthy while it sets up.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Grimer's HP and Special Defense; the remaining EVs are placed in Defense. A Careful nature allows Grimer to take special hits even better, as its Defense will be increased anyway by Curse. Magnemite is a great partner, as it can trap annoying Steel-types that prevent Grimer from sweeping thanks to their immunity to Poison.</p> <p>Powerful attackers such as  Life Orb Misdreavus and Drilbur can easily break through Grimer even after a boost; it is best to remove these threats before trying to set up. This set can also act as a pivot, switching into Fighting-types early-game and spreading poison, before using Curse and sweeping late-game.</p> "

With a massive Defense stat, great Speed, and a wide movepool, Onix can fulfill numerous roles on a team. It can act as a reliable Stealth Rock user with Sturdy, which allows Onix to survive a hit that would normally OHKO it at full health. A drawback to this rocky snake is that it sports mediocre HP and Special Defense stats, making it susceptible to special moves such as Surf. All in all, Onix can find a spot in nearly any team that is looking for anything from a good sweeper to a useful wall.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rock Blast can be used to break Substitutes. Onix has a reasonably high Speed, so a Choice Band set is viable, raising its low Attack stat to a decent level. With nearly equal Attack and Special Attack stats, a mixed Life Orb set would work well, allowing Onix to hit physical walls that expect to wall it with ease.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Onix didn't get the best typing, despite its great defenses. Not only does a Rock / Ground typing give Onix two 4x weaknesses to Water- and Grass-type attacks, it also makes Onix weak to common Fighting- and Ground-type attacks. Snover can easily switch in on anything Onix can use besides Stone Edge, and KO it with Blizzard or Giga Drain. Frillish can come in and Scald Onix for the KO. Timburr can easily revenge kill Onix with Mach Punch. Bronzor is immune to Ground-type attacks courtesy of Levitate, resists Rock-type attacks, and can easily take down Onix with Gyro Ball.</p> ",

In terms of other sets, Drowzee has the ability to fill many other roles besides that of a revenge killer, although it doesn't always perform up to snuff when given those roles. It can run a SubPunch or Substitute + 3 attacks set, but this is somewhat gimmicky on Drowzee. The same goes for any dual screens or status set. It can set up Trick Room thanks to its access to Hypnosis, but Bronzor greatly outclasses it in this regard. Drowzee has access to Nasty Plot, as well as a decent special movepool to use it with, but Croagunk has higher Special Attack and better coverage. Drowzee can also run an interesting set with Psych Up, Wish, Zen Headbutt, and Drain Punch, allowing it to set up alongside Pokemon such as Timburr; if pulled off correctly, Drowzee can become a major threat.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>In general, Dark-types can easily counter Drowzee, especially if they have Pursuit. The most important of these are generally Stunky and Houndour. Diglett also checkmates Drowzee with Sucker Punch. Vullaby can come in on a Psychic-type move and set up with Nasty Plot. The same scenario applies for almost anything that resists whatever move Drowzee is locked into. Pokemon with at least 22 Speed can also take out Drowzee if they carry the right move. Slowpoke can simply toy around with Drowzee if it's locked into anything but Thunder Punch. Wynaut can just spam Counter, while Drowzee can't do anything about it.</p> ",

The first moveslot is given to the STAB move of choice; Zen Headbutt has a chance to flinch, while Psycho Cut has slightly lower Base Power but a high chance to get a critical hit and perfect accuracy. Both moves easily take out weakened Pokemon, especially Ghost- and Fighting-types. The main targets for Ice Punch are Dragon-types, but it also hits Flying- and Grass-types as well. Thunder Punch hits Frillish and other Water-types hard, bar Chinchou, which has Volt Absorb. Drain Punch is used not only as a form of pseudo-recovery, but also as Drowzee's only way of hitting Steel-types super effectively, especially Ferroseed, which otherwise walls this set. A Jolly nature is required here, as it allows Drowzee to hit 21 Speed with a Choice Scarf.</p> <p>The given EVs maximize both Attack and Speed, with the remaining EVs placed into HP to increase Drowzee's overall bulk. Alternatively, you can place those HP EVs into either of its defenses to increase Drowzee's bulk on that side. In terms of moves, Brick Break can be used over Drain Punch to break screens, but Drain Punch's healing effect is generally superior in most situations. Trick can also be used, but Drowzee will be too slow to do much after it loses its Choice Scarf. Drowzee also will be missing out on key coverage if it uses Trick. Return is another option if you want broad neutral coverage, but it isn't the best move to use since Drowzee doesn't gain STAB on it.</p> <p>Pokemon that can get rid of Dark-types make good teammates, especially Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr.

This can prove to be dangerous for the opponent, since either will make Krabby extremely dangerous. STAB Crabhammer is a very useful tool to have, hitting many threats hard with good neutral coverage. Return has a high Base Power, and the combination of Water and Normal goes nearly unresisted in Little Cup. This set is useful as a late-game sweeper, taking out the opponent's weakened Pokemon.</p> <p>Oran Berry prevents Krabby from getting KOed by priority attacks and gives it more time to set up, though Life Orb boosts the power of Krabby's attacks and ensures a few crucial OHKOs that Krabby would otherwise miss out on. When using Life Orb, the 36 HP EVs should be shifted to Special Defense to minimize Life Orb recoil. Hyper Cutter is the better ability to use on this set, as it prevents Krabby's Attack from getting lowered, helping it in the long run. Brick Break or X-Scissor can be used over either boosting move to provide extra coverage, but they both decrease the flexibility of the set and can deprive you of the best stat-up move in certain scenarios. This set loves entry hazards support. Ferroseed is thus a good teammate, since it resists Krabby's weaknesses and can lay down Spikes and Stealth Rock. Vacuum Wave Croagunk can finish off Krabby with ease when it is weakened, making Pokemon such as Bronzor great teammates, as they also have great defensive synergy with Krabby.

Slowpoke and Ferroseed are no longer good counters to Krabby here, as they are decimated by X-Scissor and Superpower, respectively.

However, Speed EVs can be moved into HP, if desired. Shell Armor protects Krabby from critical hits, although Sheer Force can be used in conjunction with Rock Slide to hit some threats which Krabby cannot otherwise, but most of these Pokemon are faster than Krabby and will force it out anyway, making Sheer Force a bad choice. A Choice Band can also be used to grant Krabby a lot of power and the ability to KO max HP Ferroseed, but it generally appreciates the freedom to switch moves. Munchlax and Ferroseed make great teammates for Krabby, as they can check the fast special attackers that trouble it. Since Krabby can weaken a large range of threats, sweepers such as Misdreavus and Croagunk make great teammates for it. Ghost-types can also switch into three of Krabby's moves freely and KO it, making Dark-types such as Houndour and Vullaby excellent options for teammates.

An Adamant nature buffs up Krabby's Attack, and is preferred over Jolly because Krabby's Speed is still boosted by Choice Scarf. Krabby's inability to change attacks means that it will be forced to switch out often, making Rapid Spin support highly useful.

Hidden Power Ice covers a lot of holes in Voltorb's coverage, primarily against Ground-types. Explosion is handy for leaving a lasting dent in the opponent's team before taking your leave, and with Life Orb and the given EVs, Voltorb can generate quite a punch with it. Substitute helps Voltorb stay safe while on the attack, as well as easing prediction. Signal Beam is a bit of a redundant coverage filler, but you don't have much else to really put there, and it is a better move to hit Grass-types. Signal Beam also deals a little bit more damage to Psychic-types than Thunderbolt, along with being a reliable move to blast Snover with (if you followed the Hidden Power Ice path). The nature is a Speed boost preference, and it doesn't really matter which one you opt for. The given EVs maximize the values you need the most; Voltorb hits max Special Attack and with a Speed boosting nature and 200 Speed EVs Voltorb hits a value of 20, which outpaces basically every Pokemon lacking a Choice Scarf in the Little Cup tier. Leftover EVs give Voltorb an extra point in HP and a bit of extra strength in Explosion.</p> <p>Even with its insane Speed, Voltorb is still open to priority, and due to its mediocre defenses and the HP it loses from Life Orb, along with a good chance that sandstorm or hail are in play, a priority attack could mean a quick end to Voltorb's stay in the match. Any Pokemon with a Choice Scarf and a decently powerful attack can threaten Voltorb greatly. Hidden Power Fire is an option over Hidden Power Ice; while it does lose a lot of coverage, it hits Voltorb's possibly number one switch-in, Ferroseed, for huge amounts of damage. Magnemite can be an invaluable partner, as it can trap and kill the opponent's Steel-type Pokemon that can hinder Voltorb's sweep.

Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice form the attacking core and can deal a high amount of damage with even a single boost. Oran Berry allows Voltorb to retain an extra sum of HP for when you are playing around with Substitute, and keeps Voltorb's health at a reasonable level after it starts getting low the first time around.</p> <p>Again, a different Hidden Power of your choice is usable here, such as Hidden Power Fire for Ferroseed. Life Orb could be used over Oran Berry, but you may find Voltorb dying a lot faster than you're comfortable with.

With no form of permanent sunlight in Little Cup, Exeggcute can't sweep well enough to be usable. It is outclassed as a physical wall by almost everything out there, including Lileep and Ferroseed. This does, however, leave Exeggcute one set and a few roles it can play exceptionally well without being outclassed.</p> <p>This set can do quite a few things. First, if it is necessary to temporarily remove a threat from the game so one of Exeggcute's teammates can set up, Sleep Powder is close to the best thing there is. Leaf Storm is another way of doing this, as its sheer power is enough to OHKO some common offensive Pokemon such as Meowth, Chinchou, and Mienfoo. It also allows Exeggcute to counter Staryu, which is a huge threat to stall teams. Diverse Exeggcute works very well on such teams because of the combination of Sleep Powder's ability to cause switches and the egg Pokemon's ability to stall with Substitute, Oran Berry, and Harvest, which has a 50% chance of restoring a used berry. Furthermore, Exeggcute provides resistances crucial to stall teams, such as Fighting, Water, and Electric. Finally, Exeggcute uses Psychic as a STAB attack that doesn't lower its Special Attack, and to improve its coverage. It is also useful for Mienfoo that think they can come in and fire off a U-turn unharmed when Exeggcute has already used Leaf Storm.</p> <p>Once Exeggcute is in safely, it can do all it needs on its own, so teammates aren't as important as they are on other sets. Exeggcute works very well with entry hazards, as it causes many switches. Omanyte is a great teammate because it has nearly perfect synergy with Exeggcute and can set up all forms of entry hazards. Dual screens are useful, but Exeggcute is still successful without them. Because Exeggcute will be switching in and out a lot, removal of entry hazards will be very helpful; Pokemon that can use Rapid Spin, such as Staryu and Tentacool, which both have great synergy with Exeggcute, are good teammates. The latter can set up Toxic Spikes to aid Exeggcute's stall and check Mienfoo if Exeggcute isn't behind a Substitute, but be wary that Toxic Spikes might interfere with Sleep Powder.</p> <p>Pokemon that can lure in opponents checked by Exeggcute are good teammates, both offensively and defensively. Houndour is a great example, as it can lure in Croagunk, Timburr, and Staryu for Exeggcute to demolish. Likewise, it can OHKO Ferroseed and Levitate Bronzor with Fire Blast. Munchlax also lures in Croagunk and Timburr, and it can OHKO Gastly with Zen Headbutt or trap it with Pursuit. It also has Thick Fat to take the Fire- and Ice-type hits that Exeggcute are weak to.</p> "

It can almost heal itself fully with Synthesis in the sun, taking away the need for Rest. Other than that, Exeggcute also gets Giga Drain to heal itself. Leech Seed is good with Giga Drain, allowing Exeggcute to regenerate its health at a crazy rate. Hidden Power Fire hits Ferroseed, which would otherwise wall Exeggcute completely. Protect stalls for Leech Seed damage, and Toxic can be used with Hidden Power Fire to have another way of taking down the opponent's health.</p> <p>Obviously for this set, Pokemon with Sunny Day support, such as Cherubi, are great partners to bring sun. Chesto Berry and Harvest can be used outside of sun, but that somewhat defeats the purpose of having a fast wall. Houndour is another great partner for Exeggcute, as it is immune to Fire-type attacks, and Exeggcute can take most Water-type attacks that aren't from Clamperl. Munchlax is a great partner, especially if it has Sunny Day, as it can take Ice- and Fire-type attacks coming at Exeggcute, while Exeggcute can sponge the Fighting-type attacks that trouble Munchlax. The EV spread gives Exeggcute maximum physical bulk while allowing it to outspeed common Choice Scarf users, such as Magnemite. However, Choice Scarf Misdreavus is the best counter to this set, as it will outspeed Exeggcute and KO it with Shadow Ball.</p> "

Giga Drain is the preferred option because with Solar Beam, a weather changer such as Snover can switch in without difficulty, resulting in the move becoming highly ineffective. Psychic gives Exeggcute another strong STAB option to smack Pokemon that resist Grass-type attacks hard, while Hidden Power Fire hits the Steel-types that resist Exeggcute's other attacks. On the other hand, Hidden Power Fighting can be used to hit Houndour, which can otherwise destroy Exeggcute. Sleep Powder makes sure Exeggcute is not setup bait, while Synthesis gives Exeggcute more staying power.</p> <p>Again, Sunny Day support helps Exeggcute immensely for the aforementioned reasons. Energy Ball can be used sometimes, but compared to the instant health regeneration from Giga Drain, it's outclassed on the whole. Hidden Power Ground hits both Steel-types and Houndour, but Bronzor then has an easy time walling Exeggcute. Life Orb gives Exeggcute a lot of power, but Eviolite makes it very bulky with Synthesis. Heat Rock can be used to have an elongated sweep with Sunny Day, but that can be provided by team members. The EV spread makes sure that Exeggcute outspeeds +1 Magnemite, and the rest is put into HP.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Without a doubt, Cubone is valued almost entirely for a single trait: access to Thick Club. This unique item doubles its Attack stat with no penalty, making it an extremely dangerous force in the Little Cup metagame. In fact, with its signature item, Cubone can reach an Attack stat as high as 30, easily overpowering all Pokemon without a Choice Band. Cubone is not a one-trick pony either, as its phenomenal base Defense stat of 95 allows it to switch into physical attacks and even wall some attackers, although its typing isn't helping it much in that regard.</p> <p>Cubone also has some other attributes that make it a great choice, such as its very impressive movepool and good offensive typing. Cubone's Ground typing does, however, leave it with three common weaknesses and few resistances. Overall, Cubone is usually a huge asset to any team that it works well on despite its minor restrictions.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The Baton Pass set can be used in Trick Room too. An identical moveset with an EV spread of 196 HP / 196 Atk / 76 Def / 36 SpD and a Brave nature is ideal for a Trick Room sweep. Solosis and Bronzor are both sturdy and powerful teammates who can set up Trick Room for Cubone. An all-out attacker set with Earthquake, Fire Punch, Double-Edge, and Thunder Punch is viable. Bulldoze is also an option on any set if you want Cubone to outspeed the opponent without Speed boosts. Cubone's support arsenal is pretty wide as it has access to Stealth Rock, Knock Off, Perish Song, and some other helpful moves such as Toxic and Detect. 30 Defense with an Impish nature and Eviolite is possible, making Cubone actually play a good support role, although the lack of recovery makes this a bad choice. Additionally, you may use random filler options such as Substitute if you like their utility.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Cubone is obviously best in a Baton Pass chain, and users of Taunt can disrupt the use it. Since there isn't much to stop Taunt due to Natu, the only Pokemon in LC with Magic Bounce, being unable to use Baton Pass legally with it, it is important to have Taunt on your team to stop Baton Pass. While they are very obscure, Baton Pass chains can score some easy KOs on your team. Wooper is a great Cubone check as its ability, Unaware, ignores any boosts to Cubone's Attack. On top of this, it can hit it with super effective STAB Waterfall, which will 2HKO it. Unaware doesn't, however, ignore Thick Club's boost, so there is no full stop to Cubone.</p> <p>With a bit of prediction, you can switch in Staryu or Shellder into Cubone without any Speed boosts and easily OHKO it. This is usually the best way to defeat Cubone itself because the sheer force of its attacks will not have to be faced. Lastly, priority in the form of Ice Shard and Aqua Jet can defeat a weakened Cubone, although they are both physical.</p> ",

With an Agility or Rock Polish boost, Cubone will outspeed and defeat many common threats that would normally defeat it, such as Staryu and Choice Scarf Snover. Cubone's great bulk means it can receive boosts very well from common Baton Pass users such as Deerling and Venonat, both of which have good synergy with it. The aforementioned Pokemon also have unique traits which make them great for passing to Cubone, namely Sap Sipper and Sleep Powder, respectively.</p> <p>While Cubone's Attack is already very high, Swords Dance makes Cubone's life much easier. The best strategy is to pass to Cubone while facing a Pokemon which is easily scared by it. Fire- and Rock-type Pokemon are great examples, because it is almost guaranteed that they will switch to an opponent ready to take Earthquake, such as Gastly. Cubone can then use Swords Dance and sweep. With such high Attack and perfect coverage, nothing is stopping Cubone any time soon once it sets up.</p> <p>Earthquake is the crux of Cubone's sweep. Any Pokemon that is hit at least neutrally with Earthquake will probably die, and its coverage with Fire Punch is excellent, hitting all but Mantyke, Ducklett, and Wingull for neutral damage. Swords Dance comes into play to raise Cubone's Attack to high levels, which can go up to 60 after one use. Double-Edge is considered a filler, but it is the best filler Cubone can possibly have as it completes the coverage chart and does good damage to physically defensive Pokemon.</p> <p>Buizel, Deerling, and Venonat are all excellent choices for Baton Pass users. Buizel can pass Agility and Bulk Up to Cubone, aiding it in Attack and Speed, which are both necessary to sweep, as well as giving it a nice boost in Defense. While they share a Grass-type weakness, Buizel can Baton Pass to Cubone to avoid Electric-type attacks, and people won't aim Water- or Ice-type attacks at Buizel, so Cubone won't come in being hit by a super effective attack other than Grass-type moves. An option to avoid Grass-type attacks is to pass to Deerling. Deerling's unique ability, Sap Sipper, will generate an Attack boost when hit by Grass-type moves, and this boost can be passed to Cubone. Deerling can also pass Work Up, Swords Dance, and Agility to Cubone to aid a mixed or physical sweep, and it can set up Light Screen to make Cubone very sturdy. Venonat can come in on a Grass-type move and use Agility on the switch. Then, it can move first and put the opponent to sleep using Sleep Powder, and Baton Pass to Cubone or another Pokemon to create a chain that will end up with Cubone.</p> <p>Lastly, Thunder Punch can be used in the last slot if desired. It has the same minimum damage as Earthquake against Slowpoke, but its range is bigger than Earthquake's, meaning it can do more damage with a bit of luck.</p> "

Not only does Lickitung have fantastic bulk, it also has access to some great support moves such as Wish, Heal Bell, and Dragon Tail. Despite these great qualities, Lickitung possesses dreadful defensive typing in Normal, especially in a tier where Fighting-types run rampant. However, this should not rule Lickitung out if you're looking for a bulky support Pokemon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Lickitung has access to a wide variety of offensive moves that could be used to hit certain targets, although it does not have enough power or Speed to run a completely offensive set. Fire Blast can be useful to hit Ferroseed, who can otherwise wall Lickitung quite well. Power Whip is useful if you want to hit Water-, Ground-, or Rock-types for large amounts of damage. Shadow Ball can hit Misdreavus super effectively, but she is often bulky enough to shrug off the damage. Lickitung has access to the infamous BoltBeam combination, but is usually outclassed by Porygon who can utilize the coverage better. A Swords Dance set may be tempting, but it is usually nothing more than a gimmick as Lickitung's Speed lets it down severely. Finally, a SubPunch set could be used to nail Houndour or Ferroseed switch-ins but it is quite situational and outclassed by Munchlax.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Lickitung's Normal typing leaves it vulnerable to the Fighting-types in the tier. Mienfoo, Timburr, and Croagunk can all switch in on Lickitung and deal large amounts of damage with their Fighting-type STAB moves. Mienfoo and Croagunk also possess Knock Off, which can severely dent Lickitung's bulk. Other notable Knock Off users include Tentacool, defensive Tirtouga, and Bulbasaur. Taunt is another support move which Lickitung has to be wary of, allowing the opposing team to take it down before it has a chance to heal up. Status conditions, especially Toxic, will be a large hindrance to Lickitung if it is not running Rest or Heal Bell. Vullaby is a Pokemon that will often carry Knock Off, Taunt, and Toxic and therefore can cripple Lickitung greatly. Ferroseed can switch in on Lickitung and set up Spikes whilst taking very little damage from anything Lickitung has, bar the rare Fire Blast. Lickitung also hates the passive damage from Ferroseed's Iron Barbs. Lastly, entry hazards give Lickitung a much harder time switching into powerful moves such as Hydro Pump from Chinchou and Staryu.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Lickitung functions very similarly to how Blissey does in OU; it can wall many special attackers and support its team by passing large Wishes or healing status ailments with Heal Bell. Wish works in tandem with Lickitung's massive HP, and this is complemented by Protect, which guarantees Lickitung can reliably heal itself. What makes Lickitung stand out from many other walls is its access to Dragon Tail, which allows it to phaze anything that tries to set up on it whilst racking up entry hazard damage on the opponent's team.</p> <p>Whilst these three moves are necessary for Lickitung to be able to function properly, the last moveslot comes down to personal preference. Heal Bell is the preferred option as it prevents Lickitung from being crippled by Toxic and also aids the rest of the team. If, for whatever reason, Heal Bell isn't necessary, Toxic is the next best option, allowing Lickitung to stall out opponents with Wish and Protect. Finally, if you already have Toxic Spikes support, Return is a reliable STAB attack which Lickitung can make good use of.</p> <p>The EV spread is pretty self-explanatory; it maximizes special bulk and allows Lickitung to pass 14 HP wishes. Unfortunately, Cloud Nine is illegal with Wish and Heal Bell because Lickitung can only get these moves from previous generations, which is why Own Tempo is used. Other moves which could be used in the last slot include Body Slam, should the 30% paralysis rate appeal to you, and Fire Blast to hit Ferroseed, who would otherwise wall this set. If you are going to use Fire Blast in the last slot, be sure to change the nature from Careful to Calm.</p> <p>As for team support, entry hazards are extremely important to make Lickitung's Dragon Tail much more effective. Dwebble is the obvious candidate for this job as it can almost always get down at least Stealth Rock or one layer of Spikes. Bronzor and Ferroseed are also good entry hazard setters and they both appreciate Wish support from Lickitung. Unfortunately, neither have particularly good defensive synergy with it.</p> <p>Lickitung also struggles against Fighting-types, so Pokemon that can handle them are great partners. Koffing and Misdreavus are both good choices as they can switch in on most Fighting-types and love the Wish support that Lickitung offers them. Finally, Lickitung struggles to switch in repeatedly if entry hazards are on the field, so Natu and Tentacool are also good teammates to remove them with Magic Bounce and Rapid Spin, respectively. In addition, both of them resist Fighting-type attacks and Tentacool can set up Toxic Spikes.</p> "

It can then proceed to shuffle through the opponent's team with Dragon Tail, dealing serious damage in tandem with entry hazards. Dragon Tail can also prevent your opponent from setting up on you. Rest is used to keep Lickitung healthy and immune to status, while Sleep Talk allows it to continue setting up and phazing in its sleep.</p> <p>Perhaps one of the best things about this set is Cloud Nine, which means Lickitung won't take damage from Sandstorm or Hail. This is a fantastic ability for Lickitung, as passive damage wears it down quickly. The EVs maximize Lickitung's special bulk; as you are boosting your Defense stat anyway, Defense investment isn't as important.</p> <p>In the same vein as the Wish set, entry hazard support is a must. Dwebble and Ferroseed have access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes, so they make good partners, although it must be noted that Ferroseed shares a Fighting-type weakness with Lickitung. Additionally, Tentacool can set up Toxic Spikes, which will help Lickitung immensely in stalling out the opponent's team.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Lickitung can't set up on Fighting-types, so teammates that can defeat them make great partners. Great examples of these include Larvesta, Misdreavus, Shelmet, and Natu. Natu has the added advantage of bouncing back hazards with Magic Bounce, allowing Lickitung to switch in repeatedly. Tentacool and Staryu can also remove hazards with Rapid Spin to help Lickitung switch in more easily. Both work well with Lickitung, as Tentacool resists Fighting-type attacks and Staryu can use Psychic to hit Fighting-types super effectively.</p> "

Its typing isn't completely terrible, as it makes Rhyhorn one of the best switch-ins to common Flying-types. Rhyhorn might be notably similar to Geodude, but their movepools make them different from each other, meaning that neither is really outclassed by the other.

Crunch has little utility, but could be used as an accurate option to hit Gastly. Curse is an alternative boosting move, but Rhyhorn's many weaknesses and low Special Defense mean that it isn't very effective. Thunder Fang and Fire Fang can increase Rhyhorn's coverage a bit, but Geodude outclasses Rhyhorn here with its access to Thunder Punch and Fire Punch. Aqua Tail is worth some consideration, as it is Rhyhorn's best option against Ground-types. Ground-types aren't too common, however, so it is a lesser option than the listed moves. Rhyhorn learns Roar, Toxic, and Stealth Rock, but there are better Pokemon for supporting a team.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Water-types such as Staryu work well, as they can take a hit from Rhyhorn and easily KO back. Grass-types, especially special attackers such as Lileep, do the same. Fighting-types with Drain Punch are very useful to stop Rhyhorn, as they can recover much of the HP lost to Rhyhorn's attacks and will usually come out on top. Hippopotas with Roar is usually a good option, though if Rhyhorn already has a Swords Dance in, it will take a large amount of damage in the process.</p> ",

This outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon, as well as many Choice Scarf users, in Little Cup. Earthquake and Stone Edge are STAB moves that have amazing neutral coverage, so they are natural choices for moveslots. Rock Blast is an option over Stone Edge for the ability to break Substitutes, but isn't nearly as reliable, as it usually has lower power than Stone Edge. In the last slot, Swords Dance is a good choice, as Rhyhorn needs little extra coverage. Rhyhorn won't always have time to use the move, but it can be very helpful against slower opponents such as Hippopotas. The other option to consider is Megahorn, as it always 2HKOes Slowpoke when Rhyhorn holds a Life Orb, and it can even do so on average with Eviolite.</p> <p>Rhyhorn makes good use of both Life Orb and Eviolite, and both have their advantages and disadvantages when compared to the other. Life Orb guarantees the 2HKO on Mienfoo and Ferroseed with Earthquake, while Eviolite versions manage to gain the 2HKO only sometimes on Mienfoo and never against Ferroseed. Life Orb also provides a 2HKO on average on Slowpoke with Earthquake followed by Megahorn, but with Eviolite, that is rarely ever the case. On the other hand, Rhyhorn gains durability with Eviolite. It grants Rhyhorn the ability to always tank two hits from Ferroseed's Gyro Ball.</p> <p>Fire Blast is a lesser option in the last slot, with Rhyhorn's HP EVs shifted to Special Attack, as it will likely OHKO Ferroseed with one layer of Spikes if using Life Orb. If using Eviolite, two switches in will do the same. Rhyhorn needs help when facing quite a few common opponents, the most important of which are Water-types such as Staryu. Chinchou is a great teammate for Rhyhorn, as it beats most Water-types easily. Grass-types such as Lileep, Cottonee, and Ferroseed pose a massive threat to Rhyhorn, as do Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr. Gastly is a solid check to some Fighting-types and Cottonee, so it works well as a teammate.

Rock Blast is a good move to have due to its ability to hit multiple times, allowing Rhyhorn to deal damage to pesky Substitute users such as Misdreavus and Abra. Aqua Tail 2HKOes Hippopotas and OHKOes Drilbur, Numel, and other Rhyhorn, although these same Pokemon can be taken down by Earthquake as well. Aqua Tail also OHKOes Magnemite with the help of Stealth Rock, and is generally a better move than Earthquake as Magnemite might have Magnet Rise or an Air Balloon; alternatively, Fire Fang hits Bronzor hard. Lastly, Megahorn helps Rhyhorn deal with Bronzor and Slowpoke.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Attack, provide high amounts of bulk, and add an extra point in Speed. There is no real reason to give Rhyhorn extra Speed as it won't outrun anything of note; therefore, an Adamant nature is used instead of a Jolly one.

Bronzor, Hippopotas, and Dwebble make decent teammates due to their ability to set up Stealth Rock. Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Cottonee as well as Fighting-types such as Mienfoo wreck Rhyhorn.

Horsea also has higher Defense and Special Attack than Mantyke. Horsea's base 70 Special Attack allows it to reach 17 Special Attack with maximum EV investment and a Modest nature.

Modest is the preferred nature because Horsea needs the extra power to deal with walls such as Ferroseed carrying Eviolite. The first moveslot is the most important. In this slot, Horsea should use Rain Dance; with Rain Dance, Horsea's Speed is doubled and Hydro Pump is boosted. The second moveslot should carry Hydro Pump, Horsea's strongest attack. With a 120 Base Power STAB move boosted by Rain, Horsea can be very threatening to anything that doesn't resist Water-type attacks. Ice Beam is in the third moveslot to hit Pokemon that Hydro Pump can't hit neutrally, such as Dragon- and Grass-types. Finally, Hidden Power Grass is recommended to cover Water-type Pokemon that resist both Hydro Pump and Ice Beam. It can also hit Chinchou for super effective damage, which is a big plus as Chinchou is dangerous in the rain. The given EV spread maxes out Horsea's Special Attack and Speed while giving one more point to its Defense and Special Defense stats. Life Orb is the best option for an item on the set. It gives Horsea the extra attacking power needed to KO and 2HKO certain threats.</p> <p>A Timid nature may be considered over a Modest nature if you want Horsea to outspeed Scarf users with 20 Speed.

Hidden Power Electric can be used over Hidden Power Grass to hit Mantyke for 4x super effective damage. Other than that, Hidden Power Electric has no benefits over Hidden Power Grass with the moveset Horsea is using. Eviolite may also be considered over Life Orb to give Horsea more bulk. It is not a very good option though, because Horsea in the rain outspeeds the whole metagame, so it won't be taking many hits anyway.</p> "

However, thanks to its unique ability, Lightning Rod, Goldeen can serve as a solid counter to many Pokemon like Chinchou, Magnemite, and Ponyta that rely on Electric-type attacks to hit Water-types. Goldeen also benefits from good Attack and Speed as well as a solid movepool that includes Megahorn to hit Grass-types and Knock Off to support its team by removing opponents' Eviolites. Although Goldeen seems to be overshadowed by Chinchou as a Water-type immune to Electric-type attacks, Goldeen's greater hitting power, ability to heavily damage Grass-types, and access to Knock Off can give it an edge. Overall, Goldeen's combination of ability, typing, stats, and movepool allow it to have a niche in Little Cup even when Swift Swim is not a viable strategy.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Although a Rain Dance Life Orb Swift Swim set seems like a possibility for Goldeen to sweep, Swift Swim simply isn't good in this metagame with the high usage of Snover and Hippopotas, and there are better Swift Swim sweepers than Goldeen anyway. Goldeen has a decent special movepool, but it has terrible Special Attack. Toxic, Aqua Ring, and Protect are other support options, but Goldeen isn't bulky enough to stay in for that many turns. A defensive set with Scald, Toxic, and Knock Off can be used, but Goldeen's Special Attack is abysmal, leaving Goldeen highly open to being setup sweepers.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Foongus isn't 2HKOed by anything Goldeen can do, and it can Spore or Giga Drain in return. Snover can revenge kill Goldeen with Giga Drain, but it needs a Choice Scarf to avoid getting outsped and OHKOed by Megahorn. Frillish takes next to no damage from any of Goldeen's attacks, burns Goldeen with Will-O-Wisp, and Recovers off any damage taken, although Goldeen can at least use Knock Off to remove its Eviolite. Ferroseed takes any of Goldeen's attacks and hits back with Bullet Seed or sets up entry hazards. Croagunk can switch into most of Goldeen's attacks, but it is 2HKOed by Drill Run. In the end, Goldeen is neither especially powerful nor especially bulky, so Pokemon with decent physical bulk will probably be able to take its hits and 2HKO back—although Goldeen will remove their Eviolites with Knock Off in the process.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Goldeen can make use of its good Attack, Speed, and usable bulk combined with Lightning Rod to serve as a niche counter to some Pokemon while still being able to deal significant damage to the opposing team. Being a Water-type with an immunity to Electric-type attacks, Goldeen hard counters most Magnemite, Chinchou, and Return-less Ponyta, and is bulky enough to take a hit from most other physical attackers and respond with an attacking move or Knock Off. Aqua Tail is a strong physical STAB that can hit hard thanks to Goldeen's good base 67 Attack; it is used over Waterfall because its extra power gets some important OHKOs and 2HKOs against Pokemon such as Mienfoo. However, if you can provide enough entry hazard support and residual damage, Waterfall is a slightly more reliable option. Megahorn complements Aqua Tail well and allows Goldeen to hit Grass-types for heavy damage, OHKOing Snover and 2HKOing Lileep. Drill Run is the best coverage move for Goldeen, hitting the Pokemon Goldeen hard counters, such as Chinchou and Magnemite, super effectively. Knock Off allows Goldeen to provide valuable utility for its team in removing the Eviolites of bulky switch-ins. As Goldeen tends to lure different Pokemon in than Mienfoo—specifically Grass-types such as Ferroseed or Lileep—it can provide support to Pokemon that Mienfoo is less adept at helping. For example, by luring in Ferroseed, Lileep, Snover, and Porygon (Pokemon that would never switch into Mienfoo) and removing their Eviolites, Goldeen can weaken many of Vullaby's checks and allow it to clean up the opposing team.</p> <p>Goldeen works well with teammates that appreciate its ability to make Magnemite and offensive Chinchou near-useless. Vullaby appreciates Goldeen's ability to shut down some of its checks and soften others with Knock Off; in return, Vullaby can switch into Grass-type attacks and use Brave Bird to check Pokemon that set up on Goldeen. As Goldeen is excellent at luring in Grass-types such as Lileep and Foongus and removing their Eviolites with Knock Off, Pokemon that can break through Lileep and Foongus with this help make for excellent teammates. Tirtouga benefits from Goldeen's ability to switch into Chinchou, and after Goldeen has used Knock Off to remove Lileep and Foongus's Eviolites, Tirtouga can OHKO both Grass-types after a Shell Smash. Goldeen can help Tirtouga further by luring and 2HKOing Croagunk with Drill Run.</p> <p>Although Goldeen can OHKO Snover with Megahorn on the switch (or use Knock Off to remove its Choice Scarf or Eviolite and proceed to outspeed and OHKO with Megahorn), it is still vulnerable to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf Snover and thus appreciates teammates such as Vullaby and Ponyta that can switch into Grass-type attacks. Frillish and Mantyke hard-wall Goldeen, although they don't appreciate Knock Off; carrying a Lileep or even a Magnemite or Chinchou of your own can help deal with them. Goldeen cannot effectively stop setup sweepers such as Axew. Riolu counters Porygon, and can use Protect and Copycat to revenge kill Axew with its own Outrage. In order to get a lot of OHKOes and 2HKOes, Goldeen needs entry hazard support and residual damage. Ferroseed can provide Stealth Rock and/or Spikes, Snover can provide hail residual damage and check Drilbur, and Hippopotas can provide both Stealth Rock and sandstorm for residual damage—although Sandstorm teams may not appreciate stacking up on weaknesses to Grass-type moves with Goldeen.</p> "

Thanks to Adaptability, its STAB moves are doubled in power, making Eevee an excellent user of Choice Band with access to powerful priority in Quick Attack. However, with the advent of Eviolite, Eevee's power has become somewhat less impressive. Eevee can also work well as a mixed attacker, with Work Up allowing it to raise both attacking stats at once to make it a potent stall-breaker. Despite its poor movepool, Eevee can still sweep successfully with the correct support.</p> ",

Baton Pass can be used to pass on a Work Up boost, which could come in useful. Eevee can pass on its stat boosts when it is low on health and give another teammate an opportunity to sweep. Although gimmicky, a Curse set could work. With an Eviolite, and maximum HP and Special Defense, Eevee can take on the role of a tank. Quick Attack ignores the Speed drops, which is very useful, and Ghost-types with Hidden Power Fighting won't do much damage when Eevee has an Eviolite and maxed out Special Defense. Wish is an option to recover Eevee's health, if you are using a bulky variant; it can also provide useful Wish support for the entire team. Hidden Power Ground can be used on the mixed attacker set to hit Steel-types, most notably Aron.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ghost-type Pokemon generally check Eevee because they are immune to its powerful STAB attacks. Gastly can easily switch in on a Quick Attack or Return, and set up a Substitute without taking any damage. With some prediction, Eevee can beat Ghost-type Pokemon with Bite as they switch in, so they are not true counters.

While Bite has low Base Power, it is Eevee's only weapon against Ghost-types, which are immune to its powerful STAB Normal attacks. Baton Pass is used in the last slot for scouting purposes.</p> <p>The EV spread is very simple: 236 in Attack and Speed maximize Eevee's sweeping capabilities. A Jolly nature is encouraged to make Eevee as fast as possible. An Adamant nature can be used for maximum power. If you do not wish to run Baton Pass, Iron Tail is an option to hit Rock-types that resist Eevee's STAB attacks.</p> <p>Ghost-type and Steel-type Pokemon are a problem for this Eevee variant because they can come in, being immune or resistant to its Normal-type attacks, and proceed to set up while it is locked in on a useless move, making Pursuit users such as Pawniard and Munchlax good partners for their ability to trap and kill Ghost-type Pokemon.

It also has good coverage in just its two STAB moves, with the only common Pokemon that resist Kabuto's STAB moves being Croagunk and Ferroseed. Unfortunately, Kabuto is weak to priority as it bypasses the Swift Swim boost. This is worsened by the fact that Kabuto is weak to Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, two of the most common priority moves. Kabuto can use Aqua Jet to bypass other priority, though. Kabuto can also function as a good lead with access to Stealth Rock, STAB priority in Aqua Jet, and Rapid Spin, though leading is now harder due to Team Preview. Overall, Kabuto is a dangerous threat which can run through teams if given the slightest chance to do so.</p> ",

Screech can work in a similar fashion to Swords Dance, but it wears off when the opposing Pokemon switches out. Therefore, entry hazard support is very useful to rack up damage during switches. Hidden Power Fire can be helpful in dealing with Ferroseed and Croagunk, but it is weak in the rain.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Kabuto has its fair share of counters. Ferroseed resists both of Kabuto's STAB moves and OHKOes with Bullet Seed. Kabuto is very weak against Croagunk, which can OHKO with STAB Vacuum Wave and resists or is immune to its STAB attacks. Snover can stop Kabuto's rain and can KO with Giga Drain, but must be careful when switching in due to Kabuto carrying Rock Slide.

Waterfall is a reliable and strong STAB move, especially in the rain. Rock Slide gives Kabuto a strong secondary STAB, providing good coverage, and hits Snover and Mantyke for super effective damage, which are normally annoying for rain teams to take on. Both Rock Slide and Waterfall provide a nice flinch rate which could come in handy. STAB Aqua Jet gives Kabuto a valuable priority attack, allowing it to finish off weakened threats that have priority themselves. Rain Dance is used in case it stops raining or when Kabuto is being used as a standalone rain sweeper.</p> <p>Even with an Adamant nature, Kabuto hits 30 Speed in the rain, outspeeding almost everything in Little Cup. Life Orb boosts the power of Kabuto's attacks, making it harder to wall. On the other hand, Eviolite allows Kabuto to take hits from strong priority moves easily and when it's setting up. If using Eviolite, invest 36 EVs into HP to marginally increase bulk; otherwise, having 19 HP reduces Life Orb recoil to 1 HP per turn. Hone Claws is an option over Rain Dance, but you'll have to ensure that teammates can reliably set up rain. Aerial Ace can be used to deal with Grass-type Pokemon and Croagunk. Earth Power is also an option to deal with Chinchou, Croagunk, and Tentacool. Kabuto appreciates entry hazard support, as it breaks Focus Sash and Sturdy, and helps Kabuto KO more Pokemon without having to take that extra hit.

However, Dratini enjoys some exclusive features other Dragon-types can't even dream of having: Shed Skin, a great ability for a setup sweeper, permits Dratini to virtually ignore status, and Extreme Speed gives it a unique tool to pick off opposing threats. Despite not getting new tutor moves like Axew and the other Dragon-types, Dratini already has all it needs in a movepool almost the size of its big brother, Dragonite. In spite of Dratini's low base stats and hatred of getting locked into Outrage, it has many advantages that can earn it a spot on your team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A mixed Dratini set can be employed thanks to its decent offensive stats as well as its access to Extreme Speed. Another possibility is a defensive set that fully takes advantage of Dratini's excellent mono-Dragon typing. A parashuffling set is quite viable, seeing as Dratini has access to both Thunder Wave and Dragon Tail. Dratini can also make more use of its resistances on the offensive Dragon Dance set and run a bulkier EV spread instead.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to Outrage and Fire Blast's unresisted coverage, Dratini is very hard to counter. However, as with all Dragon-types, once it is locked into Outrage, any Steel-type with some bulk can easily take a hit and then take it out, with Bronzor being a great example of such. Along these lines, massively physically bulky Pokemon such as Hippopotas can also take a hit and then Whirlwind Dratini out or deal massive damage with a STAB move. Aron and Shieldon can shrug off any of Dratini's moves and hit back with Head Smash and Ice Beam respectively.</p> <p>Dratini has a few checks that are actually quite common. The most common of these is the standard pivot Mienfoo, which has enough bulk to survive a +1 Outrage and can use a combination of Fake Out and Drain Punch to take Dratini out. The other checks are generally bulkier Choice Scarf Pokemon that outspeed Dratini at +1, which is not a hard task, and that can take an Extreme Speed.

Extreme Speed is the move that sets Dratini apart from other Dragon-types, allowing it to pick off faster Choice Scarf users that either have been weakened or are frail. Shed Skin allows it to set up without fear of status conditions. Life Orb is the item of choice here to maximize Dratini's offensive potential. If the Life Orb makes it difficult to set up however, you can run Eviolite instead. The additional bulk gives Dratini more setup opportunities against various Grass-, Fire-, and Water-type attacks. However, this comes at the cost of lower damage output, which means Dratini needs more Dragon Dance boosts to sweep.</p> <p>Lonely is generally the preferable nature when holding a Life Orb because it still enables Dratini to attain 14 Speed before Dragon Dance, which means that at +1, it hits the special number, 21, needed to outspeed all unboosted Pokemon in the metagame. Hasty is always an option in order to outspeed Choice Scarf Pokemon that also aim to hit 21 Speed. However, Hasty is best when using Eviolite because Extreme Speed cannot KO Choice Scarf Snover without Life Orb and Lonely. Keep in mind that when using Life Orb, using 0 HP IVs is necessary in order to reduce Life Orb damage to 1 HP per hit instead of 2.</p> <p>As with most setup sweepers, Dratini greatly appreciates entry hazard support, so Pokemon such as Dwebble aid greatly in the sweeping process. When holding Life Orb, Dratini especially likes dual screen support in order to set up more often without worrying about being KOed. Knock Off is also very important because it removes the high defensive ability of certain threats by getting rid of Eviolite, letting Dratini make up for the KOs it lacks when using Eviolite itself due to not carrying Life Orb. Because Dratini uses Fire Blast as coverage and it is not boosted by Dragon Dance, it prefers having Steel-types weakened if they have the bulk to take a Fire Blast.</p> <p>Following this idea of weakening common answers to Dratini, wallbreaking support is also useful to enhance Dratini's sweeps. For example, the most common wallbreaker in the tier, the dreaded MixKrow, aids this set a lot by punching holes in common defensive cores and weakening them to the point where Dratini can just sweep at +1.</p> "

When using Rest, Marvel Scale sends Dratini's Defense sky-high, allowing it to shrug off many physical moves.

If Magnemite is not used, Knock Off is helpful to weaken Steel-types so they crumple in the face of +6 Outrages.

Sentret learns Baton Pass and can pass moves such as Amnesia, Defense Curl, Work Up, and Hone Claws, though other Pokemon are far more reliable for that role. Quick Attack is a priority move, but it is incredibly weak. Sentret also learns Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, which can be considered on the Choice Specs set, but they get much lesser coverage compared to the listed moves. A set with Endure and Reversal is an option as well, but it won't do enough damage to be worth using. Charm could weaken a physical attacker, though Sentret usually loses to those even with the move.

Psycho Shift could work, mainly as a way to rid status inflicted on Hoothoot. Toxic is an interesting choice over Hypnosis if used on a stall team, as Hoothoot can stall out many Pokemon with its high defenses and Reflect.

Hypnosis is the optimal move in the last slot, as sleep is a very potent status effect; it is also something else to set Hoothoot apart from Vullaby.

The aforementioned EV spread, however, does make Hoothoot a good check to Hypnosis Gastly that lack Thunderbolt, so it can be useful if your team is weak to it. Lileep is a great teammate for Hoothoot, as it beats most Chinchou, a good counter to this set, handily. Magnemite has a useful 4x resist to Air Slash, so it is also another solid counter. Wooper and Hippopotas can deal with Magnemite rather easily. Magnemite itself is also a fantastic teammate for Hoothoot, as it resists all of Hoothoot's weaknesses. In return, Hoothoot is immune to the Ground-type moves that Magnemite fears.</p> "

However, Ledyba is not completely useless, as its decent Special Defense and a good support move in Encore help it to be viable. If paired with a spinner, Ledyba can even wall a few top threats, including Mienfoo and Timburr.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ledyba has a few other options, although its low stats prevent it from using many of them efficiently. A full Baton Pass set is a plausible choice, allowing Ledyba to pass Agility or Swords Dance boosts to offensive threats such as Timburr, which might need a Speed boost, or fast Choice Scarf users, such as Taillow, that might need a power boost. Alternatively, a full Swords Dance set is possible using Swords Dance, Drain Punch, Bug Bite, and Roost, although Ledyba has a pitiful Attack stat.</p> <p>Other viable moves Ledyba has include Air Cutter, which allows it to hit Fighting-types harder than a resisted Bug Buzz. Supersonic could be used to confuse opponents, although the low accuracy is unappealing. Being a Bug-type gives Ledyba a STAB U-turn to scout the opponent; however, Ledyba has better moves to be using, such as Knock Off or Encore. Finally, Tailwind could be used as a last ditch effort to pull off a sweep.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The biggest issue for Ledyba is Stealth Rock, which instantly removes 50% of its health on the switch. Besides that, Pokemon that prey on Ledyba's multiple common weaknesses can defeat it with ease. Flying-types such as Doduo and Taillow can hit Ledyba hard with STAB Brave Birds, while Houndour and Ponyta can burn Ledyba to a crisp with their Fire-type attacks. Although Ferroseed cannot directly threaten Ledyba, it can use Ledyba as setup fodder, as Encore does not stop Ferroseed from laying down Spikes.</p> ",

Reflect allows Ledyba to patch up its weaker Defense stat, and after the boost, it will only take an average of 20% from a Riolu's Crunch at +2. Bug Buzz, while weak with no investment, allows Ledyba to bypass Taunt and do mild damage to opponents. It also allows Ledyba to beat Timburr one-on-one most of the time.</p> <p>If the team already uses dual screens, Knock Off is a suitable replacement for Reflect, allowing Ledyba to remove the Eviolite many bulky Pokemon in Little Cup rely on. When using Reflect, one can opt to use a different EV spread of 196 HP / 196 Def / 36 SpA / 36 SpD with a Calm nature, trading one point in Defense for a point in Special Attack.</p> <p>When running Ledyba, Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Staryu and Sandshrew is absolutely necessary to prevent Ledyba from losing 50% of its health when switching in. Hazard support from Pokemon such as Ferroseed is also useful due to the amount of switches Encore can cause. Other important teammates are useful to switch into Ledyba's common weaknesses. Steel-types such as Ferroseed can take the many Rock-, Flying-, and Ice-type attacks aimed at Ledyba, while Flash Fire Pokemon such as Houndour and Ponyta can take the multitude of Fire-type attacks aimed at it.</p> "

Swarm, Spinarak's ability, can be useful in some cases, but most of the time it will faint before it reaches the activation zone.

Psychic, Signal Beam, and Sludge Bomb are all very powerful special attacks, but Spinarak's Special Attack is too low, and it would not benefit from using such attacks. It does learn Toxic Spikes, but it wouldn't be able to use it twice because of its awful defenses. A Baton Pass set could be used, as Spinarak gets Agility and Hone Claws, meaning that whatever receives the boosts might be able to do some decent damage. Dig could be used to hit the Steel-types that counter Spinarak, but the opponent could easily switch out to a Pokemon that is immune to the move. Disable could work, but Spinarak generally wouldn't last long enough to get a chance to use it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Fire-types in general can easily OHKO Spinarak with one of their Fire-type attacks. Dwebble can set up on Spinarak, whether it be with entry hazards or the rare Shell Smash set. Aron and Cranidos can KO Spinarak with their STAB Head Smash. Stealth Rock can wear down Spinarak every time it switches in, causing it to lose 25% of its health. Ferroseed is immune to or resists all of Spinarak's moves except for Twineedle or Bug Bite, which will not do much damage because of Spinarak's average Attack stat. Frillish and Duskull can both take a hit from Night Slash and then burn Spinarak with Will-O-Wisp, making Spinarak take damage every turn and cutting Spinarak's Attack stat in half.</p> ",

Poison Jab or Cross Poison can be used in the fourth slot. Poison Jab deals more damage and has a chance of inflicting poison, and while Cross Poison has slightly less base power, it has a higher chance of getting a critical hit.

Spinarak could also use Sucker Punch, but it is a little less reliable when opposing Pokemon, such as Slowpoke, use a healing move such as Slack Off. Chinchou is a good partner, as it resists the Fire-type attacks that deal super effective damage to Spinarak, and can KO Fire-types with a STAB Hydro Pump. Staryu and Tentacool resist Fire-type attacks, and can effectively use Rapid Spin, making them good teammates for Spinarak too. Houndour also pairs well because it can absorb any Fire-type attacks aimed at Spinarak with its ability, Flash Fire, and can then deal huge damage with a boosted STAB Fire Blast.

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Pichu has a plethora of other options to use. Wish would be a great move to use for recovery, but with such low HP, Wish will hardly heal even half of your teammates' health; Pichu also would not be able to use the Wish itself, as it cannot take a hit. Pichu can also use Thunder Wave to cripple some fast opponents such as Gastly, but because Pichu is not bulky enough to use the move, this is better left to other Pokemon such as Chinchou or Ferroseed. Lastly, a set consisting of Substitute and Encore using an Oran Berry is viable, allowing Pichu to set up Substitute on something that cannot threaten Pichu, and using Encore after that Pokemon attacks.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>A lot of Pokemon can check or counter Pichu. Ground-types such as Hippopotas, Drilbur, and most importantly Diglett are the biggest counters, being immune to Pichu's STAB and easily OHKOing it back with Earthquake. Diglett gets a special mention for being able trap Pichu with Arena Trap, effectively completely removing Pichu from the game.

However, because of its recoil, Thunder Punch is a secondary STAB option, with a noticeable power drop in exchange for lack of recoil. Return is the best possible coverage option available from Pichu's pitiful movepool, hitting Ground-types who are immune to its Electric STAB neutrally. Iron Tail is mostly filler, but hits Lileep and Snover hard on the switch, while Toxic is useful for crippling an incoming Hippopotas.</p> <p>Lightning Rod is the preferred ability due to the immunity it provides, and Static will see little to no use on Pichu because it cannot take a hit. Entry hazard support is recommended to secure some OHKOs and 2HKOs, such as the OHKO on Slowpoke after Stealth Rock. Because Magnemite and Ferroseed completely wall this set, a Magnemite of your own is a useful counter, trapping both of them and hitting them with a super effective Hidden Power Fire.

Volt Tackle is an excellent STAB move to use with its high Base Power. Volt Switch is viable for scouting the opponents team, although this would put Pichu at the mercy of Ground-types such as Diglett and Drilbur. Due to that, Pichu can opt to run Light Screen, allowing it to help teammates take special hits more easily, as well as having use after Pichu dies, or Toxic, allowing it to cripple bulky walls such as Hippopotas.</p> <p>Lightning Rod is the preferred ability as the Special Attack boost it provides by switching into an Electric-type attack boosts the power of Volt Switch. The EV spread gives Pichu 19 HP, minimizing the amount of Life Orb recoil taken from every attack, while maxing out Speed and Attack. The use of Fake Out + Encore can cause many switches, making Spikes and Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Dwebble an excellent way to take advantage of this. The use of Encore + Volt Switch also helps Pokemon such as Misdreavus or Clamperl set up, which can immediately threaten the opponent's team.

Safeguard is another team support option that Mareep learns, and can be helpful to stop a teammate from being crippled while setting up.

Scald is an option, allowing Wooper to burn potential threats, but the burn rate is not very reliable, and it's not very strong either, due to it coming off of Wooper's low Special Attack stat. Finally, Curse and Stockpile in tangent with Counter are good options, allowing Wooper to boost its Defense to high levels and reflect any weak physical attack for double the damage. Curse should be used if Wooper is more offensively oriented, while Stockpile should be used if Wooper's main objective is to tank as many hits as possible.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Grass-type Pokemon can easily switch in on either of Wooper's STAB attacks, take little damage, and retaliate with a powerful STAB attack of their own. A great example is Ferroseed, who can take any hits with relative ease, is immune to Toxic, and can set up entry hazards before finishing Wooper off with Bullet Seed. Other Grass-type Pokemon perform similarly. However, unlike Ferroseed, most Grass-types are weak to Ice and when played correctly, an Ice Punch coming from Wooper can hurt. Bronzor is a great counter, also being immune to Toxic like Ferroseed, boasting great defenses, and easily switching in and tanking any hits Wooper throws at it. However, Bronzor cannot do much to Wooper either, unless Wooper does not carry Recover, or Bronzor has Toxic. Frillish does not take a lot of damage from Earthquake, can burn Wooper with Will-O-Wisp, and can replenish its health with Recover.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Wooper is a great utility counter to many Pokemon, being able to stall large threats out with a combination of its moves and stats. Earthquake offers STAB, and is a relatively powerful attack. Waterfall provides secondary STAB, and is useful against Pokemon who resist Ground-type attacks. Ice Punch offers great coverage alongside Earthquake, hitting Flying-type Pokemon for super effective damage, but cannot be used with Unaware. Encore allows Wooper to lock an opponent into a move, easing prediction, and often allowing a teammate to set up if the opponent does not switch on the same turn. Toxic is a great move, and can be used to stall opposing Pokemon out in tangent with Recover.</p> <p>Unaware is the preferred ability, and it is most useful for countering set-up sweepers. However, Water Absorb is also useful, as replenishing a quarter of Wooper's health whenever it switches into a Water-type move is really quite nifty. Note that Ice Punch is illegal with Unaware because Ice Punch is a 4th generation move tutor move, and Unaware can only be obtained via Dream World, meaning Wooper must use Waterfall if Unaware is used. With Eviolite, Wooper turns into a sturdy physical tank, though its Special Defense stat is rather ordinary even with the boost from Eviolite. Therefore, Wooper should try to stay away from special attacks as much as possible. An Impish nature allows Wooper to take as many physical hits as possible, and the EV spread maximizes Wooper's HP stat, increases its Attack by one point, and boosts its Defense stat by two points.</p> <p>Bronzor is the greatest teammate to Wooper, being able to set up Stealth Rock, as well as having great synergy with it. Opposing Bronzor are a nightmare for Wooper, being immune to Earthquake, Toxic, and resisting Ice Punch, while not taking much from even Waterfall. Therefore, Magnemite makes a great teammate; having access to Magnet Pull allows it to come in on Bronzor, trap it, and take it out with Thunderbolt in a most efficient manner. Magnemite is also relatively slow, so it can also function well under Trick Room. Pawniard does well against Grass-type Pokemon who cause Wooper trouble, as its Steel typing allows it to switch in on Grass-type attacks, and threaten them with its own powerful STAB attacks.</p> "

While Explosion's nerf makes it a less attractive option for Pineco, an improved Sturdy effectively gives Pineco a free Focus Sash and allows it to do its job more effectively.

Bulldoze can be used over Payback to damage Fire-type Pokemon and lower their Speed stat, but it needs to be used as they switch in, since they can threaten to KO Pineco with a super effective Fire-type attack. If it runs Bulldoze, Pineco is walled by Levitating Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gastly, which can set up and attempt to sweep. Pineco has access to Gravity, which could be used when combined with Spikes and Toxic Spikes to damage previously immune Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gastly and Frillish block Pineco's Rapid Spin, while also boasting a resistance to its STAB attack. Strong physical attackers such as Aron can dispose of Pineco with powerful moves such as Head Smash, but won't be able to prevent it from setting up Stealth Rock or using Rapid Spin, thanks to Sturdy. Pineco can be used as setup bait by Pokemon such as Riolu and Pawniard, as its attacks cannot damage them in the slightest. Cottonee, with its priority Taunt, can shut down Pineco, as it relies on setting up entry hazards. However, Cottonee cannot hope to go head-to-head against Pineco, as Pineco can attack Cottonee with a super effective Bug Bite and use Rapid Spin to get rid of Leech Seed. Natu can reflect Pineco's entry hazards back onto the user's side with its Magic Bounce ability; the best Pineco can do is to Rapid Spin those hazards away and switch to an appropriate counter.</p> ",

Pineco can easily switch in on a physical attack, and then proceed to set up entry hazards or spin them away. Stealth Rock is the primary choice of hazard because it strips common Rock-weak Pokemon, such as Snover and Ponyta, of 25% of their HP. Spikes can be used instead of Stealth Rock, as Stealth Rock is a common move and can probably be set up by another member of your team. Rapid Spin is a valuable asset to Pineco's movepool as it gets rid of entry hazards the opponent has set up, which is useful for supporting the aforementioned Rock-weak Pokemon should you carry them on your own team. Payback hits Ghost-type Pokemon, such as Gastly, for super effective damage, and prevents them from completely walling Pineco. Protect is an option for scouting the opponent's attacks, and can potentially thwart attempts to Trick it a Choice item. It is also useful for gaining an additional turn of damage from hail, sandstorm, or poison. However, be wary of Pokemon with access to setup moves, as they can take advantage of Protect. Finally, Bug Bite steals Oran Berries, which are commonly used in Little Cup; by doing so, Pineco can replenish its HP and continue to support the team. Keep in mind that with the advent of Eviolite, Oran Berries are not as common as they once were.</p> <p>Sturdy acts like a Focus Sash, and ensures that Pineco has at least one turn to set up entry hazards or use Rapid Spin. The EVs and Eviolite ensure that Pineco is as bulky as possible, and the remainder are invested in Attack to add some power. Toxic Spikes is an option that can poison all grounded Pokemon; it can be used in conjunction with Protect to increase the amount of poison damage that the opposing Pokemon takes.</p> <p>Sweepers who appreciate opponents weakened by entry hazards, such as Misdreavus, make good partners for Pineco. Fire-type Pokemon such as Ponyta, Litwick, and Houndour can absorb Fire-type attacks aimed at Pineco, and appreciate the Rapid Spin support that Pineco provides. Litwick can additionally act as a spinblocker for Pineco. Houndour, in addition to possessing Flash Fire, can also take out the Ghost-types that block Rapid Spin. However, it cannot switch in against Frillish due to the threat of Surf. Stunky is a good teammate as well because of its ability to trap and kill Ghost-types; its lack of weaknesses to Water and Fighting gives it distinct advantages over Houndour as a trapper. Pineco's rather poor Special Defense means that special walls such as Munchlax deserve a mention; they can take the special attacks aimed at Pineco, while Pineco can take the physical attacks aimed at them in return.</p> "

Teddiursa is a respectable sweeper in today's metagame; with 21 Speed after a Quick Feet boost, it becomes faster than all other unboosted Pokemon, and can easily run through teams after a Swords Dance. Although Teddiursa is not incredibly bulky thanks to the lack of Eviolite, as it must use Toxic Orb to abuse Quick Feet, it can still set up on a variety of special attackers and proceed to sweep teams with its STAB-boosted Facade. However, it is just not strong enough without Swords Dance, and will fail to sweep teams if it doesn't get its boost.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Teddiursa has coverage moves, such as Aerial Ace, Earthquake, and Rock Slide, however; all of them are weaker than STAB neutral Facade, even when they are super effective. Fire Punch is a viable move solely to hit Bronzor, but Close Combat at +2 easily 2HKOes Bronzor anyways. Bulk Up and Hone Claws are both boosting moves that can be used over Swords Dance, but Teddiursa does not have the bulk to use Bulk Up, and the accuracy boost from Hone Claws is negligible when you realize that every one of Teddiursa's attacks have perfect accuracy. Substitute can be used over Swords Dance or Protect, but many switch-ins to Teddiursa are faster than Teddiursa, making it more logical to just attack outright. Yawn can be used over one of the coverage moves in conjunction with Protect, but this would cause Teddiursa to lose valuable coverage for an unreliable sleep strategy. Body Slam or Return can technically be used over Facade, but they are almost always weaker. As Teddiursa outspeeds all unboosted Pokemon in the tier, it can run Rain Dance or Sunny Day to support the team, but there are generally better users of the moves, such as Chinchou and Mienfoo. Lastly, a Rest + Sleep Talk set with Eviolite can be used, but Teddiursa's Normal typing is horrible for a defensive set in a metagame infested with Fighting-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>There are only a few ways of dealing with Teddiursa. Bronzor and Slowpoke can both take a hit from Teddiursa even when it is at +2 Attack, but neither can do much back, as they cannot even status it. Stalling with Protect is incredibly effective against Teddiursa, as the increasing Toxic damage will eventually put a stop to its sweep. Outside of these methods, one must rely on either priority or outspeeding it in some way. Priority from Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Tirtouga, Timburr, Stunky, Snover, Dratini, and Croagunk is extremely threatening to Teddiursa; Fake Out from Croagunk or Mienfoo are especially so, thanks to Fake Out's effect of flinching, adding on to the already short timer Teddiursa has. Outspeeding Teddiursa is also a great way of dealing with it; Drilbur under sandstorm can easily outspeed and OHKO Teddiursa with its STAB Earthquake, while Choice Scarf users such as Mienfoo, Taillow, and Chinchou will always reliably outspeed and damage Teddiursa. Choice Scarf users who reach 21 Speed, such as Snover and Shellder, can also threaten Teddiursa, but risk losing the Speed tie and getting OHKOed.</p> ",

Protect is an alternative for Teddiursa, to ensure Toxic Orb activates, while also defending itself from random Fake Outs; however, it is generally outclassed by Swords Dance, which allows Teddiursa to sweep unprepared teams. Facade is the perfect STAB attack for Teddiursa--it has 210 Base Power after STAB--allowing it to completely destroy everything that doesn't resist it. Close Combat and Crunch both give great coverage, collectively hitting Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types for super effective damage. Teddiursa is also a great status absorber after Toxic Orb has been activated, and can easily capitalize on the many Pokemon who use status moves, such as Ferroseed and Shroomish. Thanks to its frailty, however, it might have some difficulty setting up, but Teddiursa can set up on a variety of special attackers such as Eviolite Misdreavus, Staryu, Porygon, and Lileep.</p> <p>The given EVs and nature are used to give Teddiursa 14 Speed, as much Attack as possible, and maximum special bulk; physical bulk is not invested in, as physical attacks are often too powerful for Teddiursa to take. Entry hazard support is generally not needed on any Teddiursa running Swords Dance, but if it runs Protect, the extra damage from Stealth Rock and Spikes are imperative for Teddiursa's success. Good teammates to Teddiursa include Pokemon who can take priority attacks or hits from Choice Scarf users; Pokemon such as Porygon, Bronzor, Ferroseed, Shelmet, Chinchou, Lileep, and Misdreavus are all marvelous at taking hits and supporting Teddiursa in some way. Both Wynaut and Misdreavus are both incredibly useful, as they can take hits from Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Timburr, both of whom are large threats to Teddiursa.</p> "

However, Remoraid is better left outright attacking than setting up due to its frailty. Remoraid has a wide movepool which it can use, including Signal Beam, Psychic, Bullet Seed, Charge Beam, and Rock Blast. However, it will have a tough time fitting any of these on a set due to the coverage Remoraid needs. Remoraid has the potential to run a set with 3 attacks and Substitute along with a Life Orb, though it doesn't have the bulk to pull it off effectively. Life Orb along with Thunder Wave is interesting as well, hitting anything switching in with paralysis and allowing Remoraid to outspeed the target.

Pokemon with a Water-type immunity and decent defenses will usually be the best counters to Remoraid, seeing as it will be using Water Spout most of the time. Lileep is an excellent example, carrying the ability Storm Drain, which nullifies Water-types attacks. Lileep can easily take out Remoraid with Giga Drain. Slowpoke, while lacking Water Absorb, is also a fine counter to Remoraid because it is only 4HKOed by Water Spout and 3HKOed by Hidden Power Grass. This allows it to use Slack Off and do whatever it pleases. Munchlax also works in this case, and though it is 3HKOed by Water Spout, it can KO Remoraid with Thunder Punch, and has Pursuit if the fish decides to switch. Ferroseed also gets a mention for resisting every move that the physical Choice set carries. If you don't carry a defensive option listed above, you can still take care of Remoraid. Priority moves are usually the way to go offensively, as they bypass Remoraid's Speed and take advantage of its frailty. Status moves can also cripple Remoraid, as they will often leave it either weak or slow, making it easy prey for revenge killers.

Water Absorb users are a threat as they can soak up a Water Spout, making Ferroseed and Munchlax nice teammates to get rid of them. Lastly, Ice Beam is an interesting option if you're having a problem with Dragon-types.</p> "

  "Houndour": {
    "overview": "<p>Houndour stands out as one of the hardest Pokemon to switch into in Little Cup, with outstanding offensive stats and a great typing. It can check several of the biggest threats in the metagame with Sucker Punch, and its base 80 Special Attack is among the highest in the tier. However, Houndour is exceptionally frail, having been cursed with meager 45 / 30 / 50 defenses. It also needs a Life Orb to function effectively and is susceptible to common priority attacks including Mach Punch and Fake Out, reducing its lifespan dramatically. Nevertheless, Houndour is an excellent utility Pokemon in Little Cup, so long as you keep it away from its own checks.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Foremost amongst Houndour's alternative options is a mostly special set; however, Sucker Punch is Houndour's main draw, and many other Pokemon in the metagame are far more effective at purely special attacking. An Eviolite can be used to boost Houndour's bulk, but would result in a heavy loss of power, stopping Houndour from reliably 2HKOing Staryu or OHKOing Mienfoo with the appropriate moves. A Nasty Plot set is very powerful, but Houndour is horrendously frail and the set lacks any priority attacks, causing it to be easily revenge killed by anything faster. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast or Protect, as you will be gambling less on a potential miss, but the drop in power or the loss of scouting ability are both very noticeable. Super Fang is another option for dealing 50% damage to Pokemon such as Munchlax and Tentacool that would otherwise shrug off Houndour's attacks. Rest is an option for Houndour as well; Early Bird provides a buffer against sleep, meaning that Rest will only make it vulnerable for one turn. However, Houndour is still incredibly frail and will often take an inordinate amount of damage in that one free turn.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Houndour has very few hard counters on account of its superlative offensive stats and high Base Power attacks. However, Porygon makes an excellent counter, as it can Trace Flash Fire to be immune to Fire Blast and is only 3HKOed 4% of the time by Crunch. Houndour can run Early Bird purely to get around Trace Porygon, however, so keep that in mind. Lileep is never 2HKOed by Houndour in sand and can KO back with Ancient Power or simply stall it out with Recover. Bad luck can ruin Houndour at the worst times, as missing a single Fire Blast will often get Houndour KOed.</p> <p>It is far easier to check and revenge kill Houndour than to counter it. Faster Pokemon resistant to Sucker Punch can KO Houndour, but can't usually switch into its attacks. Timburr, Mienfoo, and Croagunk can take a resisted hit from Houndour and KO in return with super effective Fighting-type attacks. Munchlax can switch in on Fire Blast and KO with Return or Earthquake, but can be 2HKOed by Crunch after Stealth Rock damage; Staryu, Tentacool, and Chinchou are in the same boat, being 2HKOed by Crunch and Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock damage. Flash Fire Ponyta gets a boost from Fire Blast and will always KO with Wild Charge after Stealth Rock and one turn of Life Orb recoil. Defensive Omanyte and Tirtouga are often 2HKOed after entry hazard damage, but they can swiftly KO back and can take a Fire Blast followed by Crunch. Drilbur and Sandshrew can take a Sucker Punch—just barely, in Drilbur's case—and KO with Earthquake. In a pinch, Hippopotas can take a Fire Blast and KO with Earthquake. Misdreavus can also beat Houndour with a little prediction to avoid Sucker Punch.</p> ",

        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This is by far Houndour's most effective set. STAB Sucker Punch is the key move, giving Houndour the ability to check top metagame threats such as Misdreavus, Abra, and Drilbur. Sucker Punch is tied with Extreme Speed as the most powerful priority in the game, and its useful Dark typing hits most major threats hard. Crunch is a much more reliable STAB attack, as it does not require the opponent to attack; Pokemon such as Staryu and Ponyta will often attempt to switch into Fire Blast only to be KOed by a Crunch and Sucker Punch in rapid succession. Fire Blast is Houndour's most powerful attack against physically bulky Pokemon, such as Hippopotas. Protect is a filler move, defending against Fake Out from Mienfoo and Croagunk as well as letting Houndour scout priority attacks. However, Substitute can also be useful, as it lets Houndour capitalize upon its ability to force switches.</p> <p>The EV spread looks odd for a Pokemon with base 80 Special Attack; however, Houndour's key attack is Sucker Punch, and so Attack is maximized. After investing EVs to hit 16 Speed, Houndour Speed ties with Modest Chinchou and Naughty Drifloon and outspeeds defensive Mienfoo, Pokemon it can 2HKO easily. With 0 HP IVs, Houndour has 19 HP, which reduces Life Orb recoil to 1 HP per turn, increasing Houndour's longevity overall. As for moves, Flame Charge can be used over Protect to boost Speed while dealing decent damage; however, the extra utility for blocking Fake Out and scouting priority is generally more useful. Pursuit is another option for the last slot to trap Misdreavus, but Houndour is OHKOed by Hidden Power Fighting after Stealth Rock damage and so requires an inordinate amount of prediction to succeed at this. Dark Pulse is an option over Crunch to provide a marginally more powerful STAB, but it doesn't hit anything harder than Crunch does and is weaker against Houndour's checks, such as Munchlax and Chinchou. The choice between Flash Fire and Early Bird can be tough; the former gives Houndour an immunity to Fire-type attacks and an occasional 50% boost in power to Fire Blast whereas the latter allows Houndour to counter Foongus and Shroomish incredibly well as well as not let Porygon Trace Flash Fire.</p> <p>Houndour is incredibly frail and can't take Fighting-type attacks from even defensive Croagunk. As such, Natu, Misdreavus, and Shelmet make excellent teammates to sponge these attacks and set up while forcing out the opponent; the latter in particular is a good teammate, as it can counter any Timburr set and set up Spikes. Ferroseed, Lileep, Hippopotas, and Chinchou have excellent defenses and can help sponge hits aimed at Houndour. Eviolite Drilbur and Sandshrew are not OHKOed by Sucker Punch and will KO with Earthquake in return; having something to check them is compulsory. Houndour is so frail that it can barely take a hit from anything; it is 2HKOed by Snover's Blizzard and is OHKOed by Ponyta's Wild Charge 75% of the time after Stealth Rock damage. Because of this, it should almost always only be sent in following a KO to revenge kill. Wish support from Lickitung is very beneficial; however, getting Houndour in to receive it is difficult, as they are both weak to Fighting-type attacks.</p> "

  "Phanpy": {
    "overview": "<p>Although often overlooked due to the influx of many powerful threats and walls, Phanpy can still support its team pretty well. Its wonderful base 90 HP and base 60 Defense, along with a usable base 60 Attack, allow it to both take physical hits and hit back strongly. Access to support moves such as Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Roar also makes Phanpy a nuisance to the opponent's physical set-up sweepers. Its offensive movepool is not to be ignored, either, as Phanpy can pose a threat with STAB Earthquake and useful priority in the form of Ice Shard. Sadly, despite its cuteness, Phanpy has its share of flaws. Phanpy's poor base 40 Special Defense will rarely allow it to survive strong special attacks. This is compounded by the fact that Phanpy is weak to common Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks. Phanpy also faces massive competition for a teamslot from Hippopotas, who can also support sandstorm teams in addition to making a great check to many physical attackers, thanks to its immense physical bulk and access to Slack Off. Still, Phanpy is a supportive teammate and should not be underestimated.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There are quite a few other interesting moves available to Phanpy. Like most physically bulky Pokemon, Phanpy can put a Counter set to good use. It also has access to physical moves such as Seed Bomb and Superpower, which can catch an unsuspecting counter off-guard on the switch. Phanpy's decent physical movepool and good base 60 Attack also make a Choice Band set an option, but it is outclassed by more powerful Pokemon. Gunk Shot hits Grass-types harder than Phanpy's other moves, but has little use otherwise and is also inaccurate. Head Smash can decimate the Flying-types who can switch in for free on Earthquake, but as with Gunk Shot, serves no other purpose.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Any bulky Water- or Grass-type can come in and pose an immediate threat to Phanpy, although they need to watch out for Toxic. Ghost-types immune to Earthquake, such as Gastly, can switch into Phanpy with ease and wreak havoc. Ferroseed can switch into Phanpy and proceed to set up without much worry due to its high defenses and immunity to Toxic. Bronzor laughs at all of Phanpy's moves, and can hurt it significantly with Psychic, making it a great check as well.</p> ",

STAB Earthquake is Phanpy's main form of offense, hitting anything that doesn't resist it pretty hard. Knock Off is the preferred item in the third slot due to the tier's massive dependence on Eviolite. However, Ice Shard complements Earthquake well, allowing Phanpy to pick off weakened Pokemon while also giving it decent coverage. Toxic and Roar are both good options in the last slot, and it's really up to the user. While Toxic allows Phanpy to cripple walls, Roar enables it to put a full stop to most physical set-up sweepers.</p> <p>The given EV spread, along with an Impish nature and an Eviolite, gives Phanpy excellent physical bulk while bringing its Special Defense to acceptable levels. A different EV spread of your choice can be used as well, but a physically defensive spread is more useful most of the time. Ferroseed works exceptionally well with Phanpy, as the two cover each other's weaknesses very well; Ferroseed can also set up Spikes to go with Stealth Rock. Tentacool has great defensive synergy with Phanpy too, can set up Toxic Spikes, and thanks to its wonderful special bulk and resistances, easily sponges the Water- and Ice-type special attacks that trouble Phanpy.</p> "

Larvitar is also immune to status anyway, courtesy of Flame Orb and Guts. Outrage provides good neutral coverage, but its secondary effect makes it a bad option. Superpower hits Bronzor the hardest out of all of Larvitar's moves, but the Attack drop is undesirable. Curse can be used along with Sandstorm support and an Eviolite, but Larvitar's common 4x weaknesses make it a bad choice.</p> <p>Larvitar can also run a Choice Scarf set, as it then outspeeds all unboosted Pokemon, hitting 21 Speed.

A Jolly nature is still an option, though, to at least tie with all Choice Scarf users with 19 Speed or less. Earthquake is Larvitar's most reliable STAB move and a staple on any set. Stone Edge is the main option in the third moveslot because of its high Base Power which is further boosted by STAB. Rock Slide can also be used instead of Stone Edge for the higher accuracy it provides, but it loses out on a lot of power.

With Life Orb draining its HP so quickly and no Eviolite to soften blows, it should be noted that Seedot usually faints in a few turns after being brought out. Nature Power (which turns into Earthquake in Wi-Fi battles) or Hidden Power Rock can also be used over Explosion to take down Fire- or Flying-type Pokemon more reliably, but Seedot will then lose one of its main niches: the use of Explosion. Alternatively, you could juice up Explosion by transferring a stat point from Special Attack or Speed to Attack to increase the power of Explosion, allowing Seedot to OHKO most Lickitung. However, doing so reduces the number of Pokemon which Seedot can outspeed or OHKO with Solar Beam. Obviously, Seedot also requires team support to have any chance of pulling off a sweep. Entry hazards will aid Seedot a lot, as they will weaken its counters and turn some crucial 2HKOs into OHKOs. Ferroseed comes to mind immediately, as it can set up Spikes with ease. It does compound Seedot's Fire-type weakness, however. Tentacool also pairs up well with Seedot, as it can sponge the Fire- and Ice-type attacks that blow Seedot away while setting up Toxic Spikes. Strong Fighting-types such as Timburr can destroy Lickitung, who can check Seedot to an extent, making them great teammates as well. Seedot also greatly appreciates partners who can set up Sunny Day for it, preferably while holding Heat Rock.</p> "

  "Taillow": {
    "overview": "<p>With its impressive Speed (hitting the second-highest Speed tier in all of Little Cup), usable Attack stat, and the ability Guts, Taillow can be a very fearsome threat after just a single turn. These attributes, in conjunction with powerful STAB moves in Brave Bird and Facade, make Taillow perfectly capable of netting KOs on some of the tier's bulkiest Pokemon. However, Taillow has an unfortunate Stealth Rock weakness, vulnerability to priority, and a tendency to kill itself with residual damage. Yet, with proper support from its team, Taillow can easily do great deals of damage to an unprepared team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>One of Taillow's major downfalls is its relatively small movepool, which offers little in the way of notable options. Yet, it possesses a small number of moves it can use to some success in select situations. Running Heat Wave is a viable option, as it allows Taillow to do a good deal to Bronzor, who otherwise walls it completely, and do greater damage to Ferroseed, as well as avoid the recoil from Brave Bird and Iron Barbs it would otherwise suffer. Even without a Special Attack investment, Heat Wave can help to remove those hard counters that would otherwise stop Taillow cold. Taillow can also abuse Counter when equipped with a Focus Sash, as the opponent will rarely sit quietly and leave Taillow to deal crushing damage to his team. Taillow's frailty also guarantees that if hit by almost any physical hit, it will take enough damage to KO in return with Counter and possibly cripple the opponent's next Pokemon with Endeavor. Pursuit is also viable, as Taillow's great Speed, in conjunction with its Guts-boosted Attack stat, forces many switches. Pursuit can also help to deal super effective damage to the Ghost-types that may switch in to absorb Facade and make Taillow accumulate Toxic damage. A set focused on Focus Sash, Endeavor, and Quick Attack could be viable thanks to Taillow's frailty, yet a Speed-hindering nature and no investment would have to be used, since Endeavor would require Taillow to be hit first. Taillow can also run Hidden Power Ground to deal with Magnemite that would resist all of its moves and threaten a KO.</p> <p>A set which abuses Choice Band is somewhat viable, but the ability to switch moves and Facade is more valuable than the relatively small decrease in residual damage. However, if it happens to switch in on a status move, it can become more powerful than the Toxic Orb set, with both a Guts and Choice Band boost. In the same vein, Flame Orb can be used, yet it is much worse than Toxic Orb, as Taillow will not be staying in for long to continually attack, meaning that the damage taken from burn will usually be significantly more than the damage it would have taken from poison.</p> <p>Taillow's secondary ability is Scrappy, and while it may seem beneficial to be able to hit Ghost-types with Facade, Quick Attack, or Return (if running a Choice set), Taillow's base Attack is not high enough to justify its use without a Guts boost, so Scrappy should not be used.</p> <p>In terms of non-attacking moves, Taillow has access to a number of interesting options, including Roost which, despite Taillow's frailty, can be used to offset residual damage taken from Stealth Rock, Toxic Orb, Brave Bird, or even Iron Barbs. This can help Taillow to stick around longer, as well as switch in and out repeatedly without dying to Stealth Rock damage. Agility is also a viable option, making Taillow one of the fastest sweepers in Little Cup, as it can outspeed almost any other Pokemon after just one turn of setup.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best and most common counters to Taillow are bulky Steel- and Rock-types who resist the majority of Taillow's offensive movepool, can stall it out with Toxic damage, and have access to moves that hit Taillow super effectively. The main examples of this are Ferroseed, Magnemite, and even Bronzor, who resist every one of Taillow's common options outside of Heat Wave and can set up entry hazards, Substitute, and screens, respectively, while Taillow is forced to switch out. Hippopotas and, to a lesser extent, even Misdreavus, can take a hit from Taillow and KO it with their super effective move of choice.</p> <p>Taillow's other hardest counters include strong priority users, such as Houndour, Timburr, or Snover, who can hit before Taillow and take advantage of its incredible frailty. At the same time, if Taillow chooses to run Quick Attack, it can hit all of these Pokemon for a great deal of damage before going down to their attacks. However, Pokemon that carry Fake Out or Extreme Speed, such as Meowth and Dratini, can bypass Quick Attack and deal heavy damage before Taillow can land a hit. Choice Scarf Magnemite can outspeed and KO Taillow with ease, and can take a Quick Attack very well on top of that.</p> <p>The most surefire way to prevent Taillow from dealing too much damage to your team is to use a Pokemon such as Hippopotas to set up Stealth Rock early on in the game and pack a Ghost-type such as Duskull or Misdreavus to block Rapid Spin. That way, half the job will be done before Taillow even starts attacking.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>After Toxic Orb's activation, Taillow's Attack stat rockets to a powerful 22, nearly reaching that of Meditite. Along with its high 19 Speed stat, Taillow becomes a very dangerous all-out attacker. Once the Pokemon that resist its moves have been knocked out, Taillow can deal heavy damage to an entire team with its boosted STAB Facade.</p> <p>Taillow's primary attacking option is its 140 Base Power Facade, which hits incredibly hard coming from its 22 Attack stat. Brave Bird gives Taillow an effective way to deal with Ferroseed, as well as Ghost-types such as Misdreavus on the switch. Yet, in general, Facade is the preferable option thanks to its higher power and lack of additional recoil. Pluck is also a viable alternative to Brave Bird by merit of its ability to steal Oran Berries from Pokemon such as Bronzor or Misdreavus, as well as avoid the recoil from Brave Bird. However, Taillow does lose the ability to hit Ferroseed nearly as hard as it could with Brave Bird, which puts it at risk of being stalled out by Leech Seed and Protect. Quick Attack, while far weaker than Facade, allows Taillow to outspeed most other priority users and damage them first, and deal good damage to, or even KO, set-up sweepers once they have been significantly weakened. For the final slot, both moves have significant upsides. A Taillow using U-turn can scout the opponent's team while doing good damage, despite U-turn having only 70 Base Power. However, with Protect, Taillow can easily find that one turn required to activate the Guts boost it so sorely needs to do any significant damage.</p> <p>To demonstrate the power a Guts Facade possesses, here are some damage calculations against some of the most common threats in Little Cup.</p> <ul> <li>Facade vs. 196 HP / 236 Def Bold +1 Slowpoke: 53.6-69.2% <li>Facade vs. 76 HP / 52 Def Chinchou: 124-148%</li> <li>Facade vs. 76 HP / 156 Def Eviolite Timburr: 72-84%</li> <li>Facade vs. 76 HP / 156 Def +1 Eviolite Timburr: 52-60%</li> </ul> <p>Taillow is heavily walled by Pokemon such as Ferroseed who, despite being hit neutrally by Brave Bird (or Pluck), can stall Taillow out with Leech Seed damage along with the recoil from Brave Bird, Iron Barbs, and Toxic Orb. For this reason, it is important to carry a strong Fighting- or Fire-type such as Timburr, Mienfoo, or Houndour alongside Taillow in order to consistently remove those bulky Steel-types from its path. Also, packing a Pokemon capable of taking care of Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus, Stunky, or Houndour, will allow Taillow to spam Facade without fear of a Ghost-type switching in for free and racking up Toxic damage. Running Magnemite alongside Taillow is also a good option, as Magnemite can trap and kill those pesky Steel-types Taillow struggles so much against, and resists all three of Taillow's weaknesses to boot. For the same reason, Diglett is also a good partner for Taillow, as it can trap and kill both Steel- and Rock-types, and absorb the Electric-type attacks aimed at Taillow. Other Ground-types, such as Wooper or Sandile, can also be used alongside Taillow. Partnering Taillow with Chinchou can be helpful, as Chinchou resists Ice- and Electric-type attacks and can scout alongside Taillow (who has U-turn) with Volt Switch. Pawniard's strong priority attack and useful resistances make it a viable partner as well, and it greatly appreciates Taillow's Ground-type immunity.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>In a metagame plagued with dangerous sweepers, such as Dragon Dance Dratini and Shell Smash Clamperl, Choice Scarf Taillow can act as a solid revenge killer. Even after both sweepers have used Dragon Dance or Shell Smash, respectively, using a combination of impressive Speed and a high-powered Brave Bird, Taillow can outpace and OHKO both Dratini and Clamperl. Unfortunately, Doduo gives Taillow stiff competition, because it can achieve the same results as Taillow using two more Attack points. However, Taillow possesses several traits giving it an advantage over the twin-headed bird. One of these is U-turn, which is not only a useful move to escape from Wynaut unharmed, but allows the team to retain offensive momentum, as well as easing the prediction required for Taillow to switch to another teammate. Taillow also boasts the choice of two superior abilities, when compared to Doduo, which are Guts and Scrappy. Guts allows Taillow to turn a Toxic or Burn status into the equivalent of a Choice Band boost, making it strong enough to 2HKO a Slowpoke with Brave Bird. While Scrappy isn't as useful as Guts, it could help you nab an OHKO on Gastly, should it think it can switch into your choice locked Return unharmed.</p> <p>When you can't afford to take recoil damage, or if you want to hit an Electric-type, Return is a reliable second STAB attack. Toxic is used to disrupt walls, such as Lileep and Slowpoke, who would otherwise recover off Taillow's Brave Birds and KO it back. Taillow can then switch out to another teammate that can stall out the Toxic damage or just KO them.</p> <p>Double-Edge can be used over Return, if you want to have a recoil party, but there generally isn't anything significant enough to warrant the extra risk. Pursuit is another option which can be used over Toxic, should you want to KO a fleeing Gastly and/or weakened Slowpoke, but its far more situational than Toxic. The EVs give Taillow the maximum amount of Attack and Speed for an Adamant nature and dumps the leftovers into HP to slightly alleviate Brave Bird recoil. It is recommended that you do not use a Jolly nature to outspeed other Choice Scarf users as it will keep you from revenging a full health Timburr with Brave Bird, along with missing out on several other important KOs.</p> <p>Because Taillow is a revenge killer with a Stealth Rock weakness and relies on a strong recoil move, it greatly appreciates a Rapid Spin user to help it not kill itself. Staryu is the top Rapid Spinner, being able to take hits from the likes of Dwebble and Shelmet, and threaten them back with a strong STAB Hydro Pump. However, Ferroseed is a problem for both of them so a strong Fighting-type, such as Mienfoo or Croagunk, couldn't hurt. Pokemon that benefit from Taillow's U-turn's safe switching, such as Wynaut, Diglett, and set-up sweepers, enjoy taking advantage of whatever specific Pokemon they are U-turned into. Lastly, like every other Choice item user, Taillow can be taken advantage of by Pokemon who are resistant or immune to whichever move it is locked into. Keeping this in mind, you should be aware of the opponent's team and carefully predict accordingly.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Without further ado, I present to you the only Bug / Water type Pokemon Surskit. With amazing Speed that gets even more amazing in the rain, this water strider can outpace almost anything in the LC metagame. Surskit's decent Special Attack can make it a great special sweeper, while it can also make a great baton passer with Agility. However, Surskit can only be at its best when in the rain, as its Speed rises to huge levels. Surskit's only real drawback is its terrible Defense, which makes it weak to almost everything. So when you encounter this tiny water strider, make sure you squash it before it squashes you.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Surskit is able to utilize a few other moves. On the Baton Pass set, Aqua Jet can be used for priority. This becomes rather redundant though, as once Surskit sets up an Agility it will be able to outspeed most threats anyway. Ice Beam can be used over Giga Drain in order to deal with Dragon-type Pokemon. Haze can be used to stop a Pokemon from sweeping, but it should never be used on the Baton Pass set. Surskit does have access to Rain Dance, which is a viable option. In most cases, Surskit will get easily OHKOed or 2HKOed because of its frailty, making teammates that can set up rain a much better option. Unfortunately, Surskit's movepool lacks Surf. This means that Surskit's only other usable special Water-type move is Scald. Hidden Power Electric can be used to hit Flying-type Pokemon such as Rufflet.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Flying-types with a Choice Scarf can easily outspeed Surskit outside of rain and can OHKO with a STAB move such as Brave Bird. Stealth Rock is also a problem for Surskit, as it takes 25% damage each time it switches in. Physical attackers that outspeed Surskit can be problematic as most of them will OHKO Surskit with a STAB move. Since Surskit is one of the more frail Pokemon, it can be easily revenge killed or OHKOed by priority. Mantyke can wall Surskit with ease and OHKO it with a Hidden Power Flying. Choice Scarf Snover is also a problem, as it can come in, induce hail, and possibly OHKO back with a STAB Grass-type move.</p> ",

This set's effectiveness rises greatly when used in the rain. Hydro Pump is a great STAB move that can hurt almost anything, while Signal Beam is another STAB move that has a chance to confuse the enemy. Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Fighting both counter Steel-types that might try to wall Surskit. If you plan on using Surskit in the rain, Hidden Power Fighting must be used. Last but not least, Giga Drain hits almost any Water-type hard.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Surskit's Special Attack and Speed, while slightly buffing Surskit's Defense and Special Defense. The IV spread makes Hidden Power Fire legal, and decreases the amount of Life Orb recoil taken, allowing Surskit to stay in battle longer. A second IV spread, 19 HP / 30 Atk / 30 SpA / 30 Spe, can be used for Hidden Power Fighting, decreasing Life Orb recoil taken as well. Speaking of Life Orb, Surskit's moves increase in power significantly, sometimes ensuring a kill. Faster Flying-type Pokemon can easily OHKO Surskit due to its bad defenses, making Nosepass a great partner. Pokemon that are also able to summon rain make good teammates, as they allow Surskit to become much faster due to its ability, Swift Swim.</p> "

Substitute is another move that Surskit can Baton Pass to another Pokemon, and can be used to block status. Since the first three moves can be prevented by Taunt, the move in the last moveslot is STAB Hydro Pump, which gives Surskit an attacking option. Hydro Pump hits opposing Ground-, Fire-, and Rock-type Pokemon hard, even without any Special Attack investment.</p> <p>In order to survive longer, the EV spread used buffs up Surskit's defenses. A Calm nature further increases Surskit's Special Defense to ensure better survivability against special attackers. Eviolite allows Surskit to survive one or two hits, while Oran Berry allows Surskit to recover and set up more Substitutes. This set works better in the rain because Surskit will become faster, forcing the opponent to make a switch. Once Surskit sets up Agility and Substitute, they can be Baton Passed to slower teammates such as Cubone, Litwick, and Solosis. As for teammates, Flying-type resists such as Aron can greatly help Surskit.</p> "

  "Shroomish": {
    "overview": "<p>Shroomish might just seem like another Grass-type, but it has many unique traits and abilities, allowing it to fulfill its own niche apart from that of the other Grass-types of the tier. In a metagame where almost every team needs a good answer to sand teams, Shroomish shines with its pure Grass typing, which allows it to wall most common sand sweepers. This gives it an advantage over its brethren Foongus and Lileep, which carry a secondary typing that makes both only neutral to Ground-type attacks. Shroomish's typing also helps it tank Water- and Electric-type attacks, letting it handle Pokemon like Chinchou or Tirtouga with relative ease. Spore also makes Shroomish stand out, allowing it to shut down any opposing Pokemon and buy itself or its teammates time to set up. Poison Heal is another great asset, as it grants Shroomish an immunity to Toxic as well as a quick way of recovery should it get poisoned. Shroomish has great balanced defenses and a moderate Special Attack stat, perfect for the role of a bulky tank for balanced teams. It has a plethora of great support moves such as Leech Seed, Toxic, or Stun Spore too. However, it still suffers from quite a few old counters. Pokemon with Taunt or Magic Bounce can thwart Shroomish's attempts of support and brush off its relatively weak attacks. Pokemon with Substitute and nice defenses can also wall Shroomish, as the Substitute prevents Shroomish's support moves from working. Despite all this, Shroomish still remains a top-tier sand counter in LC because of its great typing, defensive stats, and access to very rare and useful support moves, and all teams that want a sand counter should definitely consider Shroomish.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shroomish can also run an effective SubSeed set with Poison Heal, but it loses the Eviolite set's ability to tank hits and reply back with quick damage. It is also outclassed by Foongus and Cottonee, the former of which has a great resistance to Fighting-type attacks and the latter has priority and a better support movepool. Other than that, there is not very much else Shroomish can do. Focus Punch with Seed Bomb can be used, but Shroomish has a low Attack, so it's better off using support moves. A Choice Scarf can also be used to grab fast Spores, but again it is easily set up on afterwards, making it a very risky option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Virtually anything with Taunt can defeat Shroomish, as it relies heavily on its support moves in order to deal any real damage to opponents. Good examples are Misdreavus, which can hit Shroomish's weaker Special Defense, as well as Vullaby, which can KO with Brave Bird. Grass-types are also annoying as they resist Shroomish's STAB and are immune to Leech Seed. Cottonee, which also learns Taunt and can set up, or Foongus, which can KO with Sludge Bomb or Hidden Power Fire, are good examples. Ferroseed can also set up hazards, but it has to watch for Hidden Power Fire. Snover can come in and OHKO with Blizzard, but it too must watch out for Hidden Power Fire. Flying-types can also be trouble because many of them can hit Shroomish for a lot of damage with their STAB moves. In particular, Natu can reflect Shroomish's attacks and kill with Hidden Power Flying. Fire-types can also quickly become problems for Shroomish once Spore has been used. Houndour, Larvesta, and Ponyta resist all of Shroomish's attacks and can KO with the appropriate STAB super effective attack. Larvesta can also hit hard with U-turn as well as scout for switch-ins. Pokemon with Substitute can also counter Shroomish, as Substitute blocks Shroomish's status and Leech Seed. Gastly is a good Pokemon to do this because it also resists Giga Drain. Pokemon with Shed Skin can also defeat Shroomish; Dratini resists Shroomish's attacks and can set up. Finally, Pokemon with Sap Sipper are also extremely annoying, as they are immune to Leech Seed, Spore, and Giga Drain and can get a free Attack boost and then KO. Deerling is a great example, but it must watch out for Hidden Power Fire or Toxic.</p> ",

        "name": "Eviolite",
        "description": "<p>Shroomish's best set in LC lets it hold the spot as one of the best sand counters in the metagame. Its awesome resistances and balanced defenses when combined with an Eviolite let it sponge hits from common threats such as Drilbur, Tirtouga, Chinchou, and Hippopotas. With an Eviolite, it can shrug off two hits from +2 Adamant Drilbur's X-Scissor and KO back with Giga Drain, recovering off the lost HP in the process. It can also live a +2 Stone Edge from Shell Smash Tirtouga and OHKO back with Giga Drain or shut it down with Spore. Similarly, it can come in on Chinchou and Staryu and simply just sit and suck out their HP with Giga Drain as they fail to scratch Shroomish's bulky hide. Shroomish is a great tank because nearly anything that can't OHKO it can be shut down by Shroomish's Spore and then gradually KOed by Giga Drain. Using its decent Special Attack, Shroomish can quickly eliminate most of the opponents it commonly walls, as they are usually weak to Grass. Shroomish also has access to a recovery move in Synthesis, which heals it and lets it switch in repeatedly to sponge attacks. With Toxic or Stun Spore, Shroomish can be used to cripple defensive Pokemon or offensive Pokemon respectively, depending on which you want Shroomish to handle. Toxic quickly wears down opponents that lack recovery, especially when used in conjunction with residual damage, while Stun Spore can be used to further cripple opponents after Sleep Cause has been activated.</p> <p>Shroomish has quite a few other options it can use. Leech Seed is another great support move that can be used to stall the opponent as well as heal up Shroomish's HP. Hidden Power Fire is a nice way to beat opposing Grass- and Steel-types that give Shroomish trouble. If Shroomish does use Hidden Power Fire, it should have 40 EVs in Special Attack instead, as they are needed to bump Shroomish's Special Attack back up to 11. Both of Shroomish's abilities can be used to great effect. Poison Heal can be run to give Shroomish an immunity to Toxic as well as a way to heal itself gradually should it switch in on an opponent's Toxic. However, Poison Heal relies on support from the opponent, making it a situational yet still useful ability. Effect Spore can be used to potentially cripple physical attackers that Shroomish commonly walls, and can even put another opponent to sleep. The given EVs maximize Shroomish's HP and Defense, letting it wall sand teams and other physically attacking pokemon with ease. The EVs are then split to balance power and Special Defense, letting Shroomish dent things with its Giga Drain as well as tank the rare Ice Beam or two from bulky Water-types.</p> <p>In terms of teammates, Shroomish likes Pokemon that can get rid of opposing Grass-, Ice-, and Flying-types, which can all wall or KO it. Pokemon like Tirtouga or Chinchou that can beat Flying- and Fire-types pair well with Shroomish. Shroomish can help by tanking Grass- and Electric-type moves in return. Ponyta and Houndour are great partners too as they appreciate the removal of Ground- and Water-types and can eliminate Fire-, Grass- and Ice-types for Shroomish. Ponyta even sets up Sunny Day, which boosts Synthesis recovery. Natu can reflect status and Taunt, as well as defeat Grass-types with Hidden Power Flying.</p> "

Endeavor is an interesting option as a last-ditch move to weaken something. Work Up is Whismur's way to set up, but it is much too frail to try. A mixed set could work, as Whismur's Attack and Special Attack stats are the same. Extrasensory could hit Fighting-types slightly harder, but it has little utility otherwise. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast for the accuracy, though the power loss is undesirable. Toxic is an interesting option to deal with Munchlax and Lickitung, though Whismur still loses to versions with Rest. Roar and Circle Throw can phaze, but Whismur is too frail to do this effectively.

  "Makuhita": {
    "overview": "<p>Outclassed somewhat by more dangerous Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Makuhita will rarely be a popular choice for most Little Cup teams. It is reduced to being a bench warmer most of the time, since it cannot pose a major threat to the opponent without significant support. Still, Makuhita has access to Belly Drum, a move that no other Fighting-type has, making it quite unique. Belly Drum quadruples Makuhita's Attack stat, giving it the chance to pull off a sweep. This is easier said than done, however, as Makuhita's low Speed and flimsy defenses make it vulnerable to opposing priority. Still, Makuhita can be a pretty useful Pokemon if given the right support, and should always be given a thought when looking for a Fighting-type to use on your team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Makuhita's small movepool doesn't give it too many other options to work with. Fake Out can be used to render the opponent useless for a turn, and can be used over Bullet Punch or even with it, but Makuhita has trouble finding a moveslot for both. Counter can be used to net a surprise KO on physical attackers, but Makuhita just doesn't have the physical bulk to put it to good use.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Makuhita's low Speed and poor defenses make it very easy to check. Flying-types such as Taillow and Rufflet make an easy meal of Makuhita, OHKOing with their STAB attacks. The same goes for Psychic-types such as Abra, though if Trick Room is in effect, these checks will have to take at least one hit before going for the KO.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With Makuhita's feeble defenses and mediocre Speed, it isn't muscular enough to actually be a threat to anything without assistance, meaning it can just run a support set for helping a more potent teammate. STAB Force Palm does a decent amount of damage to most threats, and has a nifty chance of paralysis that can cripple the opponent. However, Toxic can serve as a replacement to Force Palm if the chance of paralysis which the former offers is not needed, chipping away at the opponent's health and crippling walls. Whirlwind enhances Makuhita's utility, foiling the attempts of sweepers to set up while also shuffling the opponent's team and stacking up residual damage. Knock Off is a great move to have considering the ubiquity of Eviolite, and thus makes a teammate's sweep easier. There are two options for the last slot. Bullet Punch provides useful priority and can pick off weakened opponents, but Brick Break provides a powerful STAB move that also shatters any screens in play.</p> <p>The EV spread ensures that Makuhita can withstand most attacks and dish out damage in return. Thick Fat grants Makuhita useful resistances to Fire- and Ice-type moves, allowing it to take on threats such as Houndour and Snover more easily. Since Makuhita functions best under Trick Room, a bulky Pokemon that can set up the field effect partners very well with it. Bronzor comes to mind immediately, as it can set up Trick Room with ease thanks to its great bulk, while also dealing with the Psychic- and Fighting-type threats which trouble Makuhita.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Though Makuhita can't sweep by itself without support, it does have access to Belly Drum, which sends its Attack stat skyrocketing from a measly 16 to a jaw-dropping 64! This kind of power is more than enough for Makuhita to sweep. Close Combat is a powerful STAB move that will destroy anything that doesn't resist it, and is Makuhita's most powerful attack. Cross Chop can be used if the drop in defenses resulting from each use of Close Combat is an issue, but bear in mind that it is inaccurate. Bullet Punch gives Makuhita the ability to muscle through faster threats once it has set up, dealing massive damage if not OHKOing most threats. Ice Punch rounds out Makuhita's coverage, eliminating Flying-types with ease.</p> <p>The EV spread is almost identical to the first set, with the only differences being the removal of the Speed EVs and usage of a 0 Speed IV to ensure that Makuhita outruns most other threats when Trick Room is in play. Guts ensures that a burn won't cut short Makuhita's sweep, and is thus preferred over Thick Fat. There are two options for an item. While Eviolite will give Makuhita the bulk to take priority attacks, Oran Berry will give it a form of recovery, and also activates when Belly Drum is used, forming a potent combo with the move. Again, Bronzor is an excellent partner for Makuhita, resisting all of Makuhita's weaknesses and setting up Trick Room.</p> "

Its niche in the ability to lure in Ferroseed and defeat it with a combination of Magnet Pull and Fire Punch is also very much appreciated, as it allows very powerful sweepers such as Clamperl and Agility Chinchou to clean up the opponent's team. However, Nosepass has to be wary of the omnipresent Mienfoo and Timburr; it is obvious setup bait for them, and can easily be 2HKOed by STAB Fighting-type moves. All in all, while Nosepass has its issues, it is an excellent Pokemon and should be treated as such.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A pure support set is usually outclassed by Ferroseed, so it isn't recommended. Nosepass does, however, get a valuable support move that Ferroseed doesn't: Taunt, which is useful for preventing opponents from setting up. It also gets Gravity, which can be useful on specialized teams. If your team has many physical attackers, you can consider a special set with Power Gem and Earth Power as main attacking moves. Thunderbolt is also a good move on such a set to hit Slowpoke on the switch. Alternatively, you can go out with a bang using Explosion; just be aware that your opponent can use that opportunity to send in a Rock-, Steel-, or Ghost-type Pokemon to take the attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Unless Nosepass is using obscure Electric-type moves such as Discharge and Thunderbolt, Slowpoke bests Nosepass. Slowpoke has to be cautious of Magic Coat, however, if it decides to use Toxic or Thunder Wave. Fighting-type Pokemon in general beat Nosepass one-on-one; Thick Fat Makuhita gets a special mention, as it completely walls Nosepass and can 2HKO with its super effective STAB Fighting-type moves. Water-types outside of sandstorm and Ground-types, namely Diglett (which has Arena Trap to prevent Nosepass from switching), defeat Nosepass.</p> ",

      {

        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Nosepass's power and bulk. Stone Edge is the recommended STAB move due to its high power; however, Rock Slide can be used instead if you prefer the accuracy. Because Nosepass is a Rock-type Pokemon, it will naturally lure Steel-type Pokemon, as they hit super effectively with their STAB and resist Rock-type moves. This latter fact especially invites Ferroseed to come in, and Bullet Seed will almost always 2HKO Nosepass.</p> <p>Thanks to a combination of Magnet Pull and Fire Punch, Nosepass will always beat Ferroseed by trapping it and 2HKOing it, easily surviving any attacks Ferroseed uses. The third and fourth moveslots are reserved for support moves; Thunder Wave is ideal for crippling Mienfoo and Riolu switch-ins, while Stealth Rock is useful in causing damage to the opponent's switches (though Nosepass isn't one to cause many switches). Lastly, Pain Split is a must on Nosepass if you are using sandstorm and Toxic Spikes, as it creates a whole new version of stall; if you are using Nosepass as a supporter, however, you may use Thunder Wave in the third slot and Stealth Rock in the last slot.</p> <p>Using Magic Coat to reflect status effects is an option, but simply having a cleric to keep your team healthy will be more effective. Earthquake is somewhat viable in one of the last two slots if you plan to use Nosepass offensively, but Onix utilizes the combination of Rock- and Ground-type moves more effectively due to its typing, receiving STAB Earthquake and Stone Edge. Toxic is another option to hit walls such as Lileep and Slowpoke on the switch, but switching to a proper counter usually works better than stalling them out.</p> <p>Despite sharing several weaknesses, Hippopotas is the best teammate for Nosepass since it sets up a permanent sandstorm. Lileep is also notable, as it can come in on Water-, Grass-, and Ground-type moves and wall or defeat the user, but they are both weak to Fighting-type moves. Natu has near-perfect synergy with Nosepass and can reflect status-inflicting moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave back at the opponent. Natu can also beat Fighting-type Pokemon who try to hit Nosepass with powerful STAB moves. Toxic Spikes support is greatly appreciated if Nosepass is using Pain Split to enhance its stall capabilities; Omanyte is a good candidate as it can also set up multiple entry hazards and take advantage of the sandstorm. Skorupi takes Fighting-type moves with ease and can act as a status absorber with its popular RestTalk set.</p> "

Superior Fake Out leads such as Mienfoo and Meowth outclass Skitty with their better stats and abilities.

It also sports an impressive nine resistances and one immunity, making it very easy to switch in and start wrecking havoc. Nonetheless, the tiny iron Pokemon is not without its flaws. The current metagame is crawling with Fighting-type Pokemon, all of which can quickly dispose of Aron. In addition to this, Aron's abysmal Speed stat means it will be easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon.</p> ",

Stealth Rock and Roar along with the ability Sturdy can be used to make a decent lead set, but Dwebble does a much better job as a lead because it also has access to Spikes, and it's faster. A Hone Claws set can be used to boost Aron's Attack, but Aron will find it hard to set up. Also, Aron will be much too slow to sweep without a Speed boost. A defensive set with Eviolite can be used, but Aron has too many common weaknesses to be an effective tank. Metal Burst and Sturdy is an option to bait Fighting-types and OHKO them, but after Aron succeeds at doing this it's basically death fodder for the rest of the match. Iron Tail can be used on any of the sets listed above for more power instead of Iron Head, but the 75% accuracy is very unappealing. Aron can also utilize Magnet Rise to avoid Ground-type attacks, but it's not worth the turn it takes to set up.

After a single Rock Polish, Aron hits 26 Speed assuming a Jolly nature, outspeeding all unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup while getting the jump on Choice Scarf users with up to 17 Speed. This turns Aron into a formidable late-game sweeper. Sadly, setting up a Rock Polish is not easily accomplished because of the plethora of Fighting-types running around. Thanks to Aron's many resistances, though, it is possible with the correct team support. Head Smash is what makes Aron so dangerous, as it seriously dents anything that doesn't resist it. Iron Head is used for secondary STAB and has decent neutral coverage with Head Smash. Earthquake rounds out the coverage nicely, hitting any Steel-types except Bronzor.</p> <p>Life Orb is needed to do as much damage as possible, as Aron has no way to boost its Attack on this set. The EV spread maxes out Attack and Speed, while the rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Defense. A Jolly nature is preferred over Adamant, so Aron can outspeed Choice Scarf users with up to 17 Speed, such as Chinchou. However, Adamant is an option as Aron will still be able to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame. Bulky walls such as Ferroseed take little damage from any of Aron's attacks, so they must be removed before Aron attempts to set up. Fighting-types are also very threatening to Aron, most notably Timburr, which has priority Mach Punch. Natu is a great partner for Aron because it can eliminate Fighting-types. Natu can also set up dual screens, helping Aron to set up more easily. Magnemite can get rid of many walls, including Bronzor, Ferroseed, and Slowpoke.

With good Speed when equipped with a Choice Scarf, a huge HP stat, and wonderful Water-type STAB, Wailmer is definitely a force to reckoned with. Wailmer can run a variety of different sets, thanks to a great movepool and well rounded stats. It has the ability to be a considerably strong offensive threat thanks to Water Spout, while it can also be great defensively thanks to Roar, which, in tandem with entry hazards, can make Wailmer very difficult to break down. However, Wailmer's stats may also be its downfall, as some may argue that they are too well rounded, meaning that it can never excel in other categories. It also faces large competition from other Water-types, such as Mantyke and Chinchou, meaning that it is often outclassed. Nonetheless, if Wailmer is played to its strengths, it can almost certainly be a great addition to any Little Cup team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>As Wailmer has a wide movepool, it can run many other options. Wailmer can easily run a tanking set with Roar, Scald, Toxic, and Rest, but without Sleep Talk, it will have no reliable recovery unless it wants to become dead weight for two turns. Wailmer can also utilize its Dream World ability Pressure to great effect, but being able to switch into a burn is the better choice for the more offensive Pokemon that Wailmer is. Wailmer can also run a pseudo-hazing set with Yawn and Protect, as opposing Pokemon will be forced to switch out unless they want to be put to sleep, though Roar is usually the better option. Finally, Self-Destruct is a rather beneficial option for Wailmer, but the drop in power means that it is relatively useless, and a Ghost-type can easily switch in to take the attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As Wailmer will often find itself spamming Water Spout, many Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks can easily counter Wailmer. Ferroseed is perhaps the best counter to our whale, as it can take Water Spouts with ease, while it can set up Spikes or Leech Seed, or even hit back with Bullet Seed. Snover is also an effective check, as it can hit Wailmer with Giga Drain for great damage, while hail causes Wailmer to take extra residual damage, meaning that Water Spout will be weakened further. Lileep with Storm Drain can easily come in on Water Spout, and it will not be 2HKOed by Ice Beam. Frillish is an excellent check as well, as it regains health from switching into Water Spout, and it doesn't mind Hidden Power Grass too much thanks to its excellent Special Defense stat. Wynaut can revenge kill Wailmer, thanks to Shadow Tag and Mirror Coat. Mantyke can beat Wailmer if it is without Hidden Power Electric, while Chinchou can beat Wailmer if it is without Hidden Power Grass. Finally, Wooper can beat a rare Curse set thanks to Unaware, Toxic, and Recover.</p> ",

        "name": "Tank",
        "description": "<p>Wailmer is often seen as an offensive Water Spout abuser, but with the second highest HP stat in all of Little Cup, it's no surprise that Wailmer makes an excellent defensive tank. Good typing gives Wailmer only two weaknesses, Grass- and Electric-type moves, both of which are rarely seen in Little Cup. On top of this, Black and White has given Wailmer three amazing gifts: Eviolite, Scald, and Pressure. With an HP stat of 30, boosting Wailmer's defenses increases its bulk exponentially, making Eviolite quite possibly the best thing that has happened to Wailmer. Scald is particularly handy as it burns opposing Pokemon, nullifying their Attack stat. It also has a reliable 80 Base Power, and enough PP to win a stall war. Wailmer's ability is another factor that makes it a great defensive staller; Pressure will increase the PP consumed by the opponent when using an attack to two, making some low PP attacks, such as Fire Blast and Hydro Pump, incredibly easy to stall out. Wailmer is able to act as a status absorber as well, using Rest to remove status. Barring Chinchou with Thunderbolt, Wailmer can safely switch into any Pokemon who commonly uses a status, such as Slowpoke and Gastly.</p> <p>The RestTalk combination, however, was not as lucky as Wailmer. Because the new sleep counter resets upon switching out, Wailmer must stay in if it is to be used effectively; in other words, Wailmer must have good team support. On the bright side, Wailmer's only solid check is Chinchou, who can be completely stopped by a handful of Pokemon.</p> <p>If you have Toxic Spikes on your team, you might prefer to use Surf instead of Scald due to the former's higher Base Power. Be aware, however, that the many common Little Cup threats that are immune to Toxic Spikes, such as Doduo and Ferroseed, would be utterly debilitated if they were burned. Entry hazards work very well with Wailmer because of the amount of switches it causes and its ability to phaze. Ferroseed has near perfect synergy with Wailmer and can set up Spikes, Stealth Rock, or even Leech Seed. Chinchou with Hidden Power Grass beats opposing Chinchou, and Heal Bell can wake Wailmer up if you switch out while it's asleep. Lileep can beat opposing Chinchou one-on-one, set up Stealth Rock, and take Grass- and Electric-type hits with ease. Mienfoo is a good teammate to check Lileep, Slowpoke, and others who threaten Wailmer.</p> <p>There really isn't much legroom when working with a moveset like this one. In terms of different options, Wailmer gets Amnesia, Aqua Ring, and Curse as boosting and healing moves. You can use Toxic over Roar if you don't have Toxic Spikes and would rather poison opponents than force them out. Outside of these moves, Wailmer has no successful options. You can run a Calm nature if the rest of your team is physically bulky, but it takes away Wailmer's high chance of surviving two High Jump Kicks from Mienfoo.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>When equipped with a Choice Scarf, Wailmer finds itself with a much needed boost to its Speed, bringing it up to a stat of 24. This allows Wailmer to fire off powerful Water Spouts while outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame with Choice Scarf, meaning it can hit other Pokemon before Water Spout is weakened. This set is useful in that it can easily rip holes into offensive teams, opening up a sweep for teammates. Hydro Pump is used on this set to provide a more consistently powerful option over Water Spout, as when Wailmer begins to lose HP, Water Spout becomes considerably weaker. Ice Beam is to provide coverage, and it does a number on Dragon- and Grass-types that will frequently switch in on Wailmer in an attempt to wall it. Finally, a Hidden Power of choice can be used to provide the final coverage. Both options hit Water-types that will set up on Wailmer. Hidden Power Grass allows Wailmer to hit Chinchou and Frillish, while Hidden Power Electric strikes Mantyke super effectively, all of which are common Pokemon. One must take into account, however, that Hidden Power sports only 70 Base Power, and this means that with Wailmer's only middling Special Attack stat, it will struggle to do lots of damage, which is why Hidden Power should only be used when absolutely necessary.</p> <p>There are a few changes that can be made with this set. Hydro Pump can easily be replaced with Surf for perfect accuracy at the cost of considerable power, although this choice is down to the user. Wailmer's nature can be changed to Modest for some extra strength behind Wailmer's attacks, making it a good choice. Under the circumstances, however, a Modest nature means that Choice Scarf Wailmer will no longer be able to outspeed Choice Scarf Magnemite, meaning that it can no longer outpace one of the strongest threats in the metagame. Water Veil is the ability of choice, as it allows Wailmer to switch into Will-O-Wisp, and it is more effective than Wailmer's other abilities. Finally, another option is Hidden Power Fire to beat Ferroseed and Snover, two of the best checks to Wailmer.</p> <p>As Wailmer will find itself frequently switching in and out, Rapid Spin support is a great boon to our favorite whale, as it wants to keep its Water Spout at maximum power. Sandshrew is perhaps the best option for providing Rapid Spin support, as it provides an excellent immunity to Electric-type attacks while also setting up Stealth Rock itself, allowing Wailmer to KO more Pokemon after the residual damage. However, Sandshrew does compound Wailmer's weakness to Grass-type attacks, so one must be wary of this when providing additional team support. Another useful teammate is Magnemite, as not only does it resist Grass-type moves, it can easily remove Ferroseed, perhaps the best check to Wailmer.</p> <p>Finally, rain support is a good thing to have when using Wailmer, as it boosts Water Spout's power to colossal levels, denting even Pokemon that resist the attack when Wailmer is at full health. Bronzor is a good teammate that can easily set up rain, and it can even provide Trick Room support if you choose to run Wailmer without a Choice Scarf for more power.</p> "

  "Numel": {
    "overview": "<p>On the surface, Numel seems like a subpar Pokemon due to its fairly low base stats; however, Numel has quite a few unique attributes that give it a niche in Little Cup. Its most significant niche lies in its ability, Simple, which when paired with moves such as Stockpile or Flame Charge, allows Numel to function as either a defensive or an offensive threat. Unfortunately, Numel has a crippling 4x weakness to Water-type attacks and struggles to get past the many Ground-types in Little Cup. So long as Numel is given the proper support, it can be a valuable asset, as either an impenetrable wall or a great sweeper.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Numel has quite a few other options to play around with. Firstly, a physical Life Orb set can be used with Flame Charge, Earthquake, and Rock Slide, but aside from that, Numel doesn't have a lot of physical attacking options. Thanks to Simple, Howl can boost Numel's Attack to +2, but Numel finds it very difficult to set up both Howl and Flame Charge. A bulky Eviolite set with Stealth Rock, Lava Plume, Earth Power, and Toxic is usable, but Numel's lack of reliable recovery makes it very easy to wear down. Amnesia and Curse are other boosting moves that Numel can take advantage of, but Stockpile is almost always the superior option. Finally, Numel has access to Will-O-Wisp and Yawn, but both of these moves are hard-pressed for a moveslot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to its crippling 4x weakness, it comes as no surprise that Water-types are the best counters to Numel. Mantyke only fears Hidden Power Electric from the Flame Charge set, but can take anything else Numel throws at it. Wooper, Staryu, and Slowpoke can typically survive a hit and KO back with their STAB attacks. Tirtouga and Chinchou can also beat Numel, but must be wary of switching into Earth Power. The two key members of sand teams, Hippopotas and Drilbur, give Numel a lot of trouble; Drilbur can outspeed a +2 Numel in the sand and can KO with Earthquake. Hippopotas can remove any boosts that Numel has acquired by phazing it out with Whirlwind or just hit it hard with Earthquake. Diglett is another Ground-type that can check Numel thanks to Arena Trap.</p> <p>Dragon-types typically make good counters to Numel thanks to their Fire-type resistance. RestTalk Dratini is perhaps the best example, as it can easily set up against the RestTalk set. Taunt users such as Misdreavus and Vullaby can completely shut down the first set, preventing Numel from using Rest or Stockpile. Lastly, many bulky Pokemon, including Porygon, Lickitung, Munchlax, Misdreavus, Vullaby, and Timburr, can survive a Life Orb-boosted Fire Blast and KO the Flame Charge set, as it is extremely frail without Eviolite.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "RestTalk",
        "description": "<p>Numel's unique Fire / Ground typing makes it a fantastic counter to many Steel-, Grass-, and Electric-types in Little Cup. This includes Magnemite, Pawniard, Foongus, Shroomish, Ferroseed, and many more. Unfortunately, Rest is the only recovery move Numel has access to, so Rest and Sleep Talk are mandatory. This allows it to sponge any status moves from the aforementioned Grass-types without fear. Lava Plume is the third move on this set, as it is Numel's most reliable STAB and can potentially cripple physical attackers with a burn. Due to Simple, Stockpile gives Numel a +2 boost to both defenses, allowing it to sweep late-game once all Water and Ground types have been removed. The defense boosts also allow Numel to become a situational check to many threats such as Timburr, which could otherwise set up on Numel. If Stockpile is deemed unnecessary for your team, Earth Power is also a good option in the final slot. This makes Numel a good counter to Fire-types and can also surprise Chinchou or Tirtouga that may try to switch in.</p> <p>The EVs, nature, and item for this set are fairly standard and maximize Numel's defensive potential. Curse is another option in the final slot in conjunction with a physical move instead of Lava Plume, but Numel's Special Defense isn't good enough to pull off a sweep. The only other notable move for this set is Toxic, which could help Numel stall out threats. If you're feeling particularly gutsy, you can drop Sleep Talk in favor of another move, but running Rest without Sleep Talk usually isn't a good idea.</p> <p>Numel appreciates teammates that can take on Water- or Ground-types. Lileep is a fantastic partner, as it is immune to any Water-type attacks aimed at Numel whilst Numel can take on the Steel-types that Lileep hates. Other Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Shroomish also make good partners for the same reasons. Heal Bell support is useful when using Numel, allowing it to Rest and switch out without the worry of being worn down. Chinchou makes a great partner for this reason and in return, Numel can take on the Grass-types that Chinchou struggles against. Tentacool is another good choice for a teammate thanks to its access to Toxic Spikes, which can help Numel stall out opponents with Stockpile and Rest. Finally, Numel is a good choice for sand teams, as it helps against Grass-types and can use the residual damage from the sandstorm to stall out opponents; however, Numel compounds the Water-type weakness that many sand teams already have.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Flame Charge",
        "description": "<p>The idea of this set is fairly straightforward. Numel can use Flame Charge to finish off a weakened opponent and then use the +2 Speed boost to attempt to sweep the opposing team. After a single Flame Charge, Numel reaches 26 Speed, which is enough to outspeed 17 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Mienfoo or Chinchou. When boosted by a Life Orb, Fire Blast is a very powerful move that can deal serious damage to most Pokemon, with a chance to OHKO Eviolite Mienfoo and Sandshrew. Earth Power is a much more reliable STAB move in terms of accuracy and can be used to hit Chinchou and Tentacool super effectively. In the last slot, Hidden Power Electric is the best option, as it is Numel's best way of getting past Staryu, Mantyke, and Archen.</p> <p>Life Orb is the only item that can be used on this set, as otherwise, Numel is far too weak. The nature can be changed to Timid if you want to outspeed 18 Speed Choice Scarf users and Adamant Sandshrew, but Numel needs all the power it can get. Numel's movepool is rather shallow, so it doesn't have a lot of other options, but Ancient Power is an interesting choice over Hidden Power Electric. It can hit Flying-types such as Archen and potentially give Numel a +2 stat boost in every stat, which would give the opponent a tough challenge in taking it down. Hidden Power Grass can be used over Hidden Power Electric if you're particularly worried about Wooper, but in general, Hidden Power Electric is the better choice.</p> <p>Numel needs a lot of support to be able to sweep with this set. Firstly, entry hazard support is very useful to allow Numel to net some extra KOs. For example, Stealth Rock allows Numel to OHKO RestTalk Chinchou 93% of the time, a layer of Spikes and Stealth Rock allow it to OHKO Staryu 93% of the time, and two layers of Spikes and Stealth Rock allow it to OHKO Tentacool 100% of the time. Ferroseed and Lileep are both strong candidates for this role, as their Grass-typing helps deal with Water- and Ground-types. Water-types such as Staryu make for good teammates, as they often lure in Pokemon that Numel can set up on, such as Magnemite and Ferroseed. Knock Off support is useful, as Numel finds it difficult to break through more bulky Pokemon. Mienfoo is a good candidate for this role, as it can help to wear down Porygon, Lickitung and Lileep, which could otherwise take a hit from Numel. Finally, wallbreakers, such as Life Orb Misdreavus, can really help in weakening the opposing team for Numel to sweep.</p> "

While at first glance it may seem outclassed by Abra, with lower Special Attack and Speed, Spoink has much higher Special Defense and HP, allowing it to take a few hits, unlike its more powerful rival. Spoink still has a good Special Attack stat and decent Speed, along with a wide movepool. It can also support its team by setting up dual screens. Despite its slight inferiority to Abra, Spoink is a solid choice for a Little Cup team.</p> ",

Psyshock is an alternative STAB move to hit specially defensive threats such as Munchlax harder, but it's a bit weaker than Psychic and therefore inferior otherwise. Signal Beam is a good option to hit Dark- and Psychic-types at the same time. Charge Beam could be used but Spoink has Calm Mind to boost its Special Attack anyway. Shock Wave would be better for a plain Electric-type move, but really only hits Slowpoke and Vullaby, meaning it usually isn't worth it. Power Gem is yet another special attack it gets but its only advantage would be to hit Houndour and Vullaby at the same time. Don't even bother with Grass Knot, as most Pokemon in Little Cup are much too light for it to do enough damage.</p> <p>Spoink has an incredible support movepool as well. Magic Coat is good on everything that learns it, and Spoink is no exception. Toxic is a decent option to hit bulky Pokemon and is probably Spoink's best option against Vullaby. Taunt can be good on the dual screening set to deal with slower Pokemon also running Taunt. Confuse Ray is unreliable but can really ruin an opponent with some luck. Spoink could set up Trick Room, but the move is better left to slower Pokemon such as Bronzor and Solosis. Mirror Coat could work with Spoink's high Special Defense, as it could take a special attack and land a surprise KO. Whirlwind could be used as a phazing move, but Spoink is too physically frail to use it well. Recycle and Oran Berry could work together as a gimmicky way to heal, but isn't the best option. Spoink learns Heal Bell, but there are much better users of the move to consider. Lastly, Amnesia could be used to make Spoink almost impenetrable from the special side but doesn't patch up its vulnerable Defense stat.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Pawniard can Pursuit Spoink for a KO and only fears a possible Hidden Power Fighting, making it a very solid check. Munchlax is very specially bulky and also runs Pursuit, meaning that it can work similarly to Pawniard. Vullaby can easily switch in and Whirlwind any boosting set and just wall any other set, but it needs to watch out for Trick. Wynaut could Encore any setup moves and revenge kill Spoink that use a Choice Scarf.</p> ",

Thunder Wave is the best option for the fourth slot, as paralysis support can allow a slower teammate to set up and sweep. Light Clay is preferred for the extra turns it provides on the screens Spoink sets up, but Eviolite is an option to give Spoink some extra bulk. Some Pokemon don't need the extra turns to set up safely and sweep, meaning that Eviolite is often the better option.</p> <p>Pawniard is the biggest obstacle in Spoink's way, as it can both use Pursuit to KO Spoink and Brick Break to get rid of any screens that were set up. Houndour and Vullaby can both set up while resisting Dark- and Ghost-type attacks aimed at Spoink, allowing them to be great teammates.

Growth can be used over Swords Dance to turn Cacnea into a mixed sweeper of sorts, though the Swords Dance set is normally better regardless. Seed Bomb is an acceptable alternative to Bullet Seed if you want a more stable STAB attack, but Bullet Seed does comparable or better damage 66% of the time, making it the more superior option in general.

Not only does this help to beat weather teams, but it reliably beats a number of set-up Pokemon. Pluck gets STAB and is a handy utility move to have, and Cotton Guard is an exceptional defensive buff to have while stalling.</p> <p>An alternate EV spread of 236 HP / 32 Def / 240 SpD with an Impish nature can be used as well. This set benefits from Toxic Spikes, as an additional turn of set up as opposed to using Toxic is welcome.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, Toxic Spikes will aid Swablu's stalling ability. A Pokemon such as Tentacool can be used to set them up. Timburr and Riolu can set up on Ferroseed, who is one of the most common switch-ins to Swablu, while Magnemite can trap the opponent's Ferroseed, along with any other Steel-types that can render Swablu ineffective. In general, most Pokemon benefit from entry hazards, and Swablu is no exception. A user of Rapid Spin or Pokemon who can prevent Stealth Rock is effective in ensuring Swablu can enter the battle unscathed.</p> "

Being one of the few Pokemon in Little Cup with access to Dragon Dance, in addition to two great STABs in Water and Ground, Barboach can inflict a lot of damage with only a single boost. However, that's where the list of proficiencies ends for Barboach. Unfortunately for Barboach, it can be taken down pretty easily by most Choice Scarf Pokemon as well as dedicated physical walls. In addition, Barboach's only viable item is Eviolite, as its defenses are quite low. This makes it harder for Barboach to sweep because it can't run Life Orb.</p> ",

A Choice Scarf can be used to hit 24 Speed, but with only 14 Attack, Barboach's attacks will be quite weak. Toxic can be used against Lileep, but Fighting-type teammates are preferred. Hydration could be combined with Rain Dance and Rest, but the predominance of Hippopotas and Snover make it a poor choice. It could run a special attacking set with Hydro Pump, Earth Power, Ice Beam, and Hidden Power Fire, but it doesn't have the power to do much damage with those attacks. It has Aqua Tail, but the drop in accuracy, and the inability to potentially flinch, makes Waterfall the better choice. Finally, Spark kills Mantyke but is illegal with Dragon Dance.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ferroseed and Lileep take neutral damage from Bounce, and easily tank Barboach's Earthquakes while KOing back with their STAB Grass-type attacks. Slowpoke and Frillish can also fend off hits and burn Barboach with Scald or Will-O-Wisp, respectively. A Choice Scarf Snover can KO Barboach with Giga Drain if Barboach hasn't boosted its Speed with Dragon Dance, while Wooper with Unaware can take anything Barboach can dish out and ignore any Dragon Dance boosts. Finally, Cottonee can Encore Dragon Dance and tank attacks courtesy of Cotton Guard, as well as paralyzing it with Stun Spore or sapping its health with Leech Seed.</p> ",

Earthquake and Waterfall are great STAB attacks for Barboach, providing great coverage against the whole tier. Bounce is effective against most Grass-types that decide to stay in against Barboach, while Return provides more immediate damage and smacks Mantyke for a lot of damage.

Anticipation is a reliable ability as it allows Barboach to see if the opponent has a super effective Grass-type attack, such as Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is suggested because it will provide Barboach with more immediate power, while an Impish nature allows Barboach to tank hits better while setting up. Furthermore, it gives Barboach more staying power versus priority users, most notably Croagunk.

Dwebble, Bronzor, and Ferroseed are all great examples of teammates, as all but the former resist Barboach's only weakness. A teammate who can stop Grass-types is also important, such as Ponyta and Houndour. Dual screen support is nice, as it will cushion damage from attacks while Barboach sets up.</p> "

After the Adaptability boost, Crabhammer has a Base Power equal to that of Hydro Pump, a truly astonishing fact. Although Corphish does not have the greatest Speed, it reaches an acceptable Speed stat of 14, which is a major jump point for any Speed-booster.

Swords Dance can be used over Dragon Dance, but then it is outclassed by Krabby, and Corphish will be too slow to sweep. In the same vein, a Choice set with either a Choice Scarf or a Choice Band can be used, but sweeping with Dragon Dance is usually much more effective. Lastly, Body Slam or Double-Edge can be used over Return, but Body Slam does not hit hard enough for a set-up sweeper such as Corphish, while Double-Edge has unwanted recoil and puts Corphish's great bulk to waste.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Slowpoke and Frillish are, hands down, the best checks to Corphish. They both either resist or are immune to Corphish's common attacks, and can even tank a +1 Crunch. Croagunk is immune to Waterfall and laughs at Superpower while being able to KO Corphish with its STAB Fighting-type attacks, but it cannot take repeated Returns, especially when boosted by Dragon Dance. Bulky Water-types such as Staryu and Chinchou can also easily check Corphish, but with enough residual damage, they can be defeated. Most Choice Scarf users can easily check Corphish as well, as the latter is slow, reaching only 21 Speed, even after a boost.</p> ",

Waterfall is the STAB move of choice for its perfect accuracy and chance to flinch; however, Crabhammer is also a great option because of its higher Base Power and high critical hit rate, though it is slightly less accurate. Superpower is an odd option on a set-up sweeper, but it allows Corphish to OHKO Ferroseed and Lileep, which is something Brick Break fails to do. Brick Break is still an option, however, as it will deal quite a bit of damage to said threats, and doesn't lower Corphish's stats.

Baltoy can also utilize Trick Room decently with its relatively low Speed and respectable offenses. With Baltoy's decent base 55 Speed, it could run a Choice Scarf set. Baltoy hits a pretty fast 22 Speed with a Choice Scarf. However, Baltoy lacks the strong offenses that are needed to score significant KOs.

However, it needs to be wary of Earth Power, which will do massive damage, or possibly even OHKO it. Fast Water-types such as Chinchou and Staryu can outspeed and OHKO Baltoy with their STAB attacks. Snover also makes a fine check, as it can OHKO Baltoy with either Giga Drain or Blizzard.

Toxic can severely cripple common spinblockers such as Frillish, as well as putting sweepers on a timer, but Psychic is also an option for nailing Gastly, which is immune to the move.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Baltoy's HP and weaker defense, making it a good mixed wall, especially when combined with a Bold nature. The remaining EVs are invested in Baltoy's Special Attack and Special Defense, granting one more point to each of those stats. Eviolite is the best choice for an item, as it allows Baltoy to tank hits with ease, thus making it easier to support its team very well.

It also has access to Rapid Spin and Knock Off, allowing it to support its teammates, in addition to being an excellent user of Stealth Rock. Unfortunately, the little Bug-type has some cons. Its defenses are only average, meaning it can't take a lot of hits, and this problem is compounded even further by the fact that it lacks reliable recovery. Its typing only resists Poison- and Normal-type moves and is neutral to Ground-, Flying-, and Fire-type moves, so it takes a lot of damage from high-powered moves such as Brave Bird, Blizzard, and Earthquake. Another problem is Anorith's lack of coverage, making it unable to hit Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Croagunk super effectively. All in all, Anorith is a Pokemon that definitely has some downsides, but can be really good if you manage to use it correctly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A standalone Swords Dance set is a viable option, as it boosts Anorith's attack to a whopping 38. However, it's easily revenge killed, and is still walled to hell and back by Mienfoo. Brick Break can be used to hit Steel-types, but it's rather weak, and most of them are hit neutrally by X-Scissor already, examples being Ferroseed and Bronzor. A Rock Polish set seems like a good idea on paper, but Anorith is way too weak and is easily revenge killed. Toxic could be used to cripple Porygon, but Knock Off is usually better. Aerial Ace could be used against Fighting-types, but it doesn't hit much outside of them and is really weak. Curse is a decent setup move, but one of Anorith's main perks is its Speed, so Curse cripples it more than anything else.

Mienfoo is the best one of the lot, having access to Drain Punch to 3HKO Anorith and Regenerator to recover any health lost in the process. However, it should watch out for Knock Off. Steel-types such as Magnemite don't fear Anorith's attacks and can KO it with their STAB moves; however, they should be careful, in case Anorith knows Brick Break. Misdreavus can easily set up on Anorith if the latter doesn't have Rock Blast, especially if the former carries Substitute. Staryu can easily switch into Anorith, OHKO with Hydro Pump, and spin away Stealth Rock.

Anorith is one of its better users, mainly due to the fact that it can outspeed and 2HKO Drilbur with X-Scissor while threatening Lileep without a boost, a rare feat in the tier. Speaking of X-Scissor, it's one of Anorith's best moves, and is its most powerful STAB move (excluding four- and five-hit Rock Blast). Stealth Rock is always good to have, and makes defeating Pokemon such as Larvesta and Vullaby easier. Knock Off is the preferred option in the last moveslot, as it can potentially remove an Eviolite from one of the opponent's Pokemon: this is particularly useful to use against Fighting-types such as Mienfoo or Croagunk, as they like to switch in Anorith.

Trick can be used with a Choice Scarf to cripple an opponent, but Shuppet is generally too slow and frail, not to mention Trick is easy to predict most of the time. Shuppet can use a Calm Mind set with Thunderbolt, Shadow Ball, and Hidden Power Fighting, but unfortunately, Shuppet is slow and gets revenge killed easily. Knock Off is probably Shuppet's most viable remaining option, as it can remove Choice items and Eviolite, rendering a variety of Pokemon useless. Pursuit can hit fleeing Ghost- and Psychic-types that switch out of Sucker Punch or Shadow Sneak, but its low Base Power and lack of STAB means it won't deal a lot of damage otherwise. Rain Dance can be used alongside Thunder and Hidden Power Water, but Shuppet's Special Attack is nothing to write home about, and there are many Pokemon in the tier that do a much better job with Rain Dance. Substitute can be used to avoid status and provide some extra protection from attacks, but it should only be used on a switch because Shuppet is frail, and has low Speed. Finally, Payback can be used to hit other Ghost-types, and because Shuppet will usually be moving last, its Base Power will generally be doubled.</p> <p>Shuppet gets Cursed Body as its Dream World ability. This can be useful to beat Choice users locked onto a weak attack, and it can also be used to beat Pokemon that lack coverage. Frisk is usually the better ability, as knowing the opponent's item can prove beneficial to defeating it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Generally, Dark-types can break through Shuppet with no problems at all. Houndour, Scrafty, and Stunky take little damage from all of Shuppet's attacks and have powerful STAB moves to quickly dispose of it. Normal-types such as Munchlax are good choices as well. Munchlax is immune to Ghost-type moves and has access to a powerful Pursuit to KO Shuppet on the switch. Shuppet can't touch Steel-types outside of Will-O-Wisp, so Pokemon such as Magnemite and Bronzor are good checks. In addition, Magnemite doesn't mind being burned that much, as it is normally specially based, and Bronzor can still set up Stealth Rock or dual screens even if statused.

Destiny Bond can be used following Trick Room and has the potential to ensure at least one KO before Shuppet goes down. Taunt is listed as it blocks any opponent's attempt to set up on Shuppet and forces the opponent to attack, which in turn, guarantees a KO with Destiny Bond. In the final slot, Shadow Sneak is used for STAB, but Sucker Punch has a higher Base Power. The main benefit to using Shadow Sneak over Sucker Punch is that it still hits even if the opponent doesn't attack Shuppet. It should be noted, however, that, if Shadow Sneak is used, Shuppet is completely walled by Normal-types.</p> <p>This set only needs to invest in Attack because Shuppet is designed to be as frail as possible. If you decide you don't want to use Shuppet as a lead, you can invest in HP and use Eviolite instead of Focus Sash for survivability. If you're looking for a defensive Trick Room user though, Yamask is generally a better choice. Will-O-Wisp can be used over Taunt if you wish to cripple physical attackers, though this carries the risk of allowing Pokemon such as Dwebble to setup on Shuppet.</p> <p>Pokemon that can take advantage of Trick Room are ideal partners, especially those with high offensive stats. Trapinch is an excellent example, as it has base 100 Attack, powerful STAB moves, and Arena Trap, which means the opponent is forced to take a hit. Omanyte and Solosis are specially based sweepers, and both of them have decent defensive stats and good type coverage. Other examples of good partners include Cranidos, Darumaka, and Magnemite.</p> <p>Due to Shuppet's frailty, most priority moves will KO it prematurely. Sucker Punch, Ice Shard, and Aqua Jet are the most troublesome, as they are common on powerful attackers such as Croagunk, Snorunt, and Buizel. A Steel-type such as Bronzor makes an excellent teammate, as it can switch into most common priority moves with ease and use this time to set up entry hazards, stat boosts, or even dual screens. Magnemite is a more offensive option if you require more attacking power, but the added support is always beneficial. Finally, Dark- and Fighting-types can get rid of opposing Ghost- and Dark-types.

Common Choice-locked Pokemon which are often trapped by Wynaut might opt to run a set using an Expert Belt or Oran Berry to trick Wynaut into using a reflecting move while they boost up and then KO it. However, this is a very specialized approach which will rarely see use otherwise. Also, as Wynaut's only way of doing damage is reflecting an attack, specially attacking Dark-types and physical Ghost-types, such as Houndour and Duskull respectively, are immune to Wynaut's attacks. Other specific Pokemon who threaten Wynaut are Gastly and Misdreavus. Taunt is an absolute killer to Wynaut, since once Taunted it can only use Counter and Mirror Coat. Lastly, anything with Volt Switch, U-turn, or a Shed Shell will avoid capture, effectively countering Wynaut as it can't do its job. Be warned, however, that if Wynaut uses Mirror Coat on Volt Switch or Counter on U-turn, the Pokemon that switches in will take damage.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Wynaut retains the same niche it had last generation, as its impressive ability to dispose of Choice-locked attackers is invaluable to many Pokemon. There are also many strong attackers which can blast holes through teams that Wynaut traps and KOes, such as Snover. It also has the ability to get rid of slower attackers and Encore set-up Pokemon, meaning Wynaut will almost always be of use in every game.</p> <p>Wynaut's movepool, while only consisting of eight moves, is perfectly suited for its job. Shadow Tag lets it trap opposing Pokemon so that they can't switch out. If the Pokemon is locked into a physical attack, Counter will dispose of it, unless Wynaut is KOed, which is unlikely considering its massive HP stat and respectable defenses. Mirror Coat bounces back special attacks. However, the crux of Wynaut's viability lies in the move Encore. Encore lets it force attackers to repeat a move, meaning you can either switch in a Pokemon that takes little damage from the attack and set up, or just KO it with Counter or Mirror Coat. If your opponent tries to set up on Wynaut, Encore lets you switch in a Pokemon to set up on it while your opponent is locked into a move for three turns.</p> <p>While only three moves are sufficient for Wynaut to complete its job, it has several options to fill the last slot. Safeguard lets it Encore a status move such as Thunder Wave, use Safeguard, and allow a Pokemon like Dratini to switch in and set up Dragon Dance without worry. On the other hand, Tickle can be used to weaken a wall so far that it will be killed by a Pursuit user easily. Destiny Bond is another option for the last slot, though Wynaut's low Speed stat without any investment makes it rather useless against most attackers.</p> <p>The EVs are rather self-explanatory. Wynaut reaches an HP stat of 27 with these EVs, along with 14 in each defensive stat. When boosted by the Eviolite, Wynaut will almost never be OHKOed. The 12 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed minimum Speed Bronzor, letting it Encore a move such as Stealth Rock before it can switch moves. A Bold nature is used instead of an Impish one to minimize confusion damage when switching into a Choice Machop's Dynamic Punch. It is also recommended you make its Attack IV 0.</p> <p>The choice between Oran Berry and Eviolite is hard to make. While the Eviolite makes Wynaut almost impenetrable, it reduces the damage done by Counter and Mirror Coat greatly. Oran Berry allows both moves to hit at a higher power and allows Wynaut to recover off damage. However, Wynaut can be OHKOed by powerful attackers such as Misdreavus.</p> <p>Wynaut's job is to remove Choice Scarf Pokemon and to allow set-up Pokemon to do their jobs easily. As such, Pokemon who enjoy this luxury are clearly good teammates. Aron is a perfect partner to Wynaut, as it can come in on one of its numerous resistances and set up a Rock Polish. Mantyke and Shellder are in a similar boat, with their sky-high defensive stats letting them set up Rain Dance or Shell Smash on many weak or resisted attacks. Wynaut makes a great addition to any sand-based team, as it can trap and KO Snover and ensure sand stays in effect.</p> "

  "Snorunt": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Snorunt doesn't seem worth using, especially when compared to all of the other Little Cup Pokemon. However, Snorunt does have some things going for it, such as its ability, Ice Body, which lets it recover health when in hail. Though its movepool is limited, it has just enough decent moves to be effective. Snorunt unfortunately possesses many disadvantages, especially in its Base Stats, which are all 50. Another flaw is its weakness to Fighting-type attacks, since Croagunk and Mienfoo are on nearly every team and love to throw around their powerful STAB moves. Despite these downsides, Snorunt is not a bad Pokemon, and should actually be seriously considered for your team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Snorunt can use Water Pulse to hit unsuspecting Fire-types, but it won't offer much more coverage. Snorunt could use Fake Tears when a Pokemon switches in and then deal major damage with a STAB Ice Beam or Blizzard, but chances are most Pokemon will outpace Snorunt's 15 Speed. It could also run a Rest + Sleep Talk set, but its defenses aren't good enough, and its poor attacking stats would make it a liability while using Sleep Talk. A Focus Sash + Avalanche set would be viable if Snorunt's Attack stat was a little higher. Protect is a good move to have so that Snorunt can heal from the hail with Ice Body.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Any Pokemon that can outpace Snorunt and deal damage with a neutral attack can probably OHKO it because of its poor defenses. Fighting-types in general, such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Riolu, easily OHKO Snorunt with a STAB Drain Punch or High Jump Kick. Houndour and other Fire-types check Snorunt with their super effective STAB attacks. Munchlax doesn't even take 20% from Crunch without Eviolite, and it won't be taking much from Ice Beam either, so it's a good counter. Hippopotas's ability to change the weather to sandstorm affects Snorunt's usefulness. Bulky waters, such as Chinchou and Frillish, wall Snorunt, but Frillish must watch out for Crunch or Shadow Ball.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>The first priority of this set is to set up as many layers of Spikes as possible, allowing a sweeper to obtain additional KOs. Snorunt has less-than-average stats all-around, though, which means it may struggle to survive one hit so that it can set up Spikes. This problem is compounded by Snorunt's weakness to types that are now very common, such as Fighting and Fire. In any case, Ice Beam is a decent STAB attack that will make Taillow think twice before switching into it. Hidden Power Ground is used to hit Fire- and Steel-types, such as Houndour and Magnemite, that would otherwise counter this set. Ice Shard gives Snorunt a STAB priority attack that proves very useful when an opposing Pokemon is low on HP.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Snorunt's Special Attack and Speed stats, and the rest are put into HP, Attack, and Defense. Ice Body should be used only if Snover is a teammate; otherwise, Inner Focus is preferred to prevent Snorunt from flinching. Partner-wise, Snover is perhaps the best, as it provides everlasting hail for Ice Body recovery and grants 100% accuracy to Blizzard for Snorunt to abuse instead of Ice Beam. A sweeper, such as Vullaby, would make a great partner, as it would benefit from the damage that Spikes cause to opposing grounded Pokemon. Frillish is a good partner because it blocks Rapid Spin and checks Hippopotas, who removes favorable weather for Snorunt. If Snover is KOed, Hippopotas becomes a bigger problem since it changes the weather from hail to sandstorm, which damages rather than heals Snorunt.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Disable",
        "description": "<p>Disable is a great move to use right after switching in Snorunt, as it will prevent the opposing Pokemon from using the last move they used for 4-7 turns, which could easily let Snorunt wall a sweeper. Ice Beam is used so that Snorunt can check Dratini and Taillow; it will OHKO both of them without requiring prior damage. Crunch hits Gastly for a good amount of damage, and hits Munchlax stronger than Ice Beam does. Unfortunately, Crunch still does very little damage, especially if Munchlax is running Eviolite. Shadow Ball provides similar coverage but isn't able to hit Munchlax and other Normal-types. Ice Shard, again, is a decent STAB priority attack that Snorunt can use to revenge kill most Pokemon at low health.</p> <p>The given EV spread is the same as the one in the Spiker set, which is the best one that Snorunt can use. Again, Ice Body should only be used if running Snover; otherwise, Inner Focus would be the better option. Besides Snover, Frillish is a good partner, as it resists all types that are super effective against Snorunt except for Rock, which is not very common anyway. Dwebble is good too, as it can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes to wear down opponents and make them easier for Snorunt to KO. Disabling one of a sweeper's moves is pretty vital for this set, as it may cause a switch out, letting you gain the upper hand.</p> "

  "Spheal": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Spheal looks like a pretty bulky tank. Its relatively high HP and average defenses, coupled with its good support movepool, stick out to make this baby walrus appealing. Similar to last generation, Spheal can pull off a stall set with the help of Ice Body healing it in the hail, but there are things holding Spheal back. New Fighting-type Pokemon such as Timburr, Mienfoo, and Croagunk represent a huge hindrance to Spheal's stalling attempts. It also sports a really bad defensive typing, with four weaknesses and only two resistances, including a weakness to Stealth Rock. Overall, Spheal is rather mediocre this generation, and should only be used on a hail-based team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hail may be useful if your team lacks Snover or as a back up in case Snover faints and hail is gone. However, if Aqua Ring is not used, then Spheal only heals a small amount of health each turn. A different EV spread can be used to be more bulky in one defensive stat, but makes it more vulnerable in its other stat. Thick Fat can be used if Spheal is not used on a hail team. With Thick Fat, it can switch in to any Ice-type attack with impunity, and take Fire-type attacks well. Encore can be used to lock an opponent into a move, either forcing it to switch out or allow you to take advantage of it by sending in a set-up sweeper. Yawn can be used to phaze opponents, but is generally inferior unless you're running entry hazards.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>First of all, any Pokemon who can change the weather immediately becomes a counter because Spheal hates any weather other than hail. Hippopotas can change the weather by switching in, making it much easier to deal with Spheal. Other than weather changers, most Pokemon who don't get hurt by hail can be called a counter. Solosis does not get hurt by hail thanks to Magic Guard and can set up Calm Mind, rendering Spheal's special attacks useless. Likewise, Abra is a threat if Blizzard or Surf is not present. Finally, other Ice-type Pokemon can deal with Spheal, especially if it runs Blizzard, as Ice-types resist Blizzard.</p> ",

        "name": "Stall",
        "description": "<p>Spheal performs much like Walrein does in the upper tiers, using Substitute and Protect to stall out many threats. With hail falling, Spheal's Ice Body will activate, which when used in tangent with Leftovers, heals most of the health lost from Substitute. Aqua Ring allows it to heal all the health loss over two turns, making this set work even more effectively. Super Fang is a great move in the last slot, as it takes out half of the opponent's health, making it much easier for hail to knock the opponent out. Blizzard and Surf are both reliable STAB options. Blizzard has better coverage and is also more powerful, while Surf has more PP and can be used to hit Rock-type Pokemon hard, who would otherwise pose a threat to Spheal. Finally, Toxic is also a viable option, allowing it to slowly whittle away at the opponent's health.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes support is greatly appreciated if Spheal lacks Toxic as it makes stalling opposing Pokemon much easier. Tentacool is a great teammate, being able to set up Toxic Spikes, as well as Rapid Spin, alleviating Spheal of its Stealth Rock fears. Tentacool also has access to Blizzard, which is a benefit since it is being used on a hail team. Ice Beam and Frost Breath are options over Blizzard, but the extra power that Blizzard has can be helpful in certain cases. The choice of nature is mainly up to preference. If Spheal is meant to tank better from the physical side, a Bold nature should be used, while a Calm nature is the preferred option if Spheal is meant to take special attacks. Spheal can run maximum Speed in order to tie with Croagunk and Timid Clamperl, but the loss in bulk greatly hurts its ability to stall. Encore is also an option to give Spheal an easier time setting up.</p> <p>Snover is a necessary teammate as its able to set up permanent hail, which is critical to Spheal's success. Litwick pairs up well with Spheal, being resistant to Grass-type attacks, immune to Fighting-type attacks, and able to knock out Pokemon who can defeat Spheal such as Magic Guard Solosis. Note that both Pokemon are weak to Rock-type attacks.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>When it comes to underrated Pokemon in the Little Cup metagame, Bagon is one Pokemon that instantly comes to mind. While it is a Dragon-type Pokemon, which is a rarity in the tier (there are only five legal Dragon-type Pokemon in Little Cup), Bagon is by far the most overlooked. While most Dragon-type Pokemon tend to be Dragon Dancers or just powerful physical attacking Pokemon in general, this isn't the case for Bagon. While it does have a decent base Attack stat of 75, offensively, Bagon is outclassed. This is because its two main competitors, Dratini and Axew, have better coverage and a much higher Attack stat, respectively. Nevertheless, Bagon has a niche over its Dragon-type counterparts by gaining access to a move many Little Cup Pokemon wish they had, Wish. Thanks to Wish, Bagon becomes a durable Pokemon capable of tanking the hardest of physical attacks in the LC tier. However, it isn't all great for Bagon. Because Dragon-type Pokemon sport resistances to a lot of usually specially orientated attacks, such as Water and Fire, its low base Special Defense doesn't help when trying to tank attacks from the special side. Nevertheless, Bagon is a good Pokemon if you need something to heal your team and tank hard physical hits, but don't expect it to do too much.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While it has other offensive options, Bagon is usually better off not using them. Part of this is because by using offensive sets, it takes away from Bagon's usable bulk. Nevertheless, if you choose to use Bagon offensively, Dragon Dance or Hone Claws with Dragon Rush can work. However, Dratini and Axew make better Dragon Dancers. A Choice Band set can also work with Outrage, Dragon Claw, Fire Blast, and another coverage move, though Axew makes the better Choice Band user due to better Attack and Mold Breaker.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While Bagon is good at tanking physical attacks, without Roar, it can't stop Pokemon from setting up on it. Scarggy can set up for days unless Bagon has Brick Break. Shellder and Clamperl can set up a Shell Smash on it and begin to cause problems. In general, anything that can tank an attack from Bagon can set up on it pretty easily. Misdreavus can just burn it with Will-O-Wisp, making its physical attacks useless, while Hippopotas can easily Roar Bagon out, which screws up the Pokemon that Bagon passes its Wishes too. Ice Beam Staryu can take hits and also Rapid Spin away entry hazards, which Bagon hates.</p> ",

While it doesn't have the biggest HP stat to pass Wishes with, its typing gives it useful resistances to common offensive types such as Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric, which gives it its niche. Dragon Claw is used for damage purposes, as well as to prevent Bagon from becoming Taunt bait. Fire Blast hits Steels, mainly Magnemite and Ferroseed, that will try to use Bagon as setup bait. Protect is used to ensure Bagon gets the recovery from Wish, and it also works with Toxic Spikes as it stalls out poison as well. However, if you aren't concerned about getting guaranteed recovery from Wish, Toxic can be used over Protect, as it breaks down Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Hippopotas, and others.</p> <p>With maximum HP investment plus the maximum investment Bagon can have with a Relaxed nature, Bagon has as much physical bulk as possible. Bagon can 2HKO Magnemite and it even has the chance to OHKO Ferroseed with 36 Special Attack EVs. After the aforementioned 36 SpA EVs are used to deal with Magnemite and Ferroseed, the remaining EVs go into SpD, as that is the only place where those EVs have any use. Using an Eviolite on this defensive set makes sense, as it boosts both Bagon's Defense and Special Defense.</p> <p>Roar can be used in the last slot as it works like Dragon Tail: phazes out Pokemon and racks up entry hazard damage. Other attacks such as Zen Headbutt, Crunch, Rock Slide, and Brick Break can be used over Fire Blast for a Wish passer that can deal with certain threats. Zen Headbutt can deal with Mienfoo and Croagunk, Crunch with Misdreavus and other Ghost- and Psychic-types, Rock Slide handles Larvesta, and Brick Break hits Pawniard and Ferroseed. If you decide to use one of those attacks over Fire Blast, make sure to move those Special Attack EVs into Attack.</p> <p>Teammates for Bagon should do two things: provide entry hazards to spread damage or status, and enjoy the Wish support Bagon can provide. Pokemon such as Omanyte, Dwebble, Ferroseed, and Pineco all love Bagon, as they can set up Spikes, and Pineco can even Rapid Spin, which is extra helpful. Dewbble, Omanyte, Pineco, and Lileep can all set up Stealth Rock as well, while Omanyte, Trubbish, and Tentacool all set up Toxic Spikes. Pokemon that can keep those hazards on the field are useful partners as well. Misdreavus is a great example, as it can block Rapid Spin, and loves the Wishes. Magnemite is another great teammate, as it traps Steel-types if Bagon isn't running Fire Blast.</p> <p>While you might still have doubts about Bagon's ability to tank common physical attacks in the LC metagame, below are calculations that show just how sturdy Bagon is:</p> <ul> <li>236 Atk+ Drilbur Earthquake vs. 236/196+ Bagon 54.54 - 68.18% <li>236 Atk+ Mienfoo High Jump Kick vs. 236/196+ Bagon 54.54 - 68.18%</li> <li>156 Atk Mienfoo High Jump Kick vs. 236/196+ Bagon 45.45 - 59.09%</li> <li>20 Atk Hippopotas Earthquake vs. 236/196+ Bagon 31.81 - 40.9%</li> <li>212 Atk+Tirtouga Stone Edge vs. 236/196+ Bagon 40.9 - 54.54%</li> </ul> "

However, it's not all good news. Bidoof is unfortunately cursed with a Normal typing in a tier where every team has a Fighting-type. Likewise, its low defenses give it difficulty setting up. Nonetheless, Bidoof can prove to be a very valuable member of your team, provided you give it the proper support.</p> ",

Charge Beam gives Bidoof a 70% chance of obtaining a +2 boost to Special Attack, making its Special Attack stat somewhat viable. Likewise, it can use its other ability, Unaware, to ignore stat boosters. Unfortunately, as the most common stat booster is Misdreavus, Unaware isn't a very useful ability on Bidoof. Its other moves also allow it to threaten specific Pokemon. Superpower hits Pawniard hard, and Shadow Ball hits Gastly and Frillish for super effective damage. Hidden Power Fire can be used for Ferroseed. Unfortunately, the lack of Water / Normal coverage when using any of these moves hurts. Likewise, Bidoof has an excellent support movepool. With access to Yawn and Thunder Wave, it can support the team by inflicting status on opponents. Bidoof also has the ability to lay Stealth Rock. As amusing as that is, it's generally an option best left for another teammate.

Likewise, Fighting-type Pokemon give Bidoof a hard time, as their attacks will do a lot of damage, even after a Curse. Bulky Pokemon such as Slowpoke give Bidoof without Charge Beam problems, as their sheer physical bulk lets them tank hits all day.

Bidoof has access to STAB Quick Attack, though, mitigating the Speed drops somewhat.</p> <p>The given EVs maximize Bidoof's HP, so when combined with Eviolite, it will be able to take hits. The rest maximize Attack and give it a boost in Defense, allowing it to reach an impressive 28 Attack and 22 Defense after a single Curse. This set appreciates entry hazard support, as it wears down the opponent's team and makes it significantly easier to acquire boosts. Likewise, because of the popularity of Fighting-type Pokemon, it is recommended to run dual screen support. That way, Bidoof will have a much easier time setting up.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it is rather hard to set up with Curse when Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Riolu, Croagunk, and Timburr are so common.

Special Snover, with Blizzard, Giga Drain, and Hidden Power Fire, is also able to take out these Pokemon. Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Croagunk make good partners as well, as they can check Ferroseed, Lileep, and opposing Fighting-type Pokemon that give Bidoof a difficult time. Choice Scarf Flying-type Pokemon such as Taillow threaten Fighting-type Pokemon with Brave Bird. Gastly and Abra make good partners for the same reason. Gastly can also take care of Slowpoke, which doesn't take much from this set due to its high Defense. Special attackers that are immune to or resist Quick Attack, such as Gastly and Drifloon, also give this set problems, as they can outspeed and kill Bidoof. Partners, such as Stunky, that can take care of Ghost-type Pokemon are helpful to deal with these threats.</p> "

Thunder Wave is an option along with Intimidate on a defensive set, but there are much better options for defensive purposes than Shinx. Protect is a good option, as it allows Shinx to safely activate its chosen status. Howl is a possibility, as after a Guts boost and one use of Howl, Shinx hits incredibly hard. Thunder Fang and Spark could be used as recoil-free alternatives to Wild Charge, though the power drop is unwelcome.

Dwebble is also a good choice to pair with Shinx, as it can set up entry hazards to allow Shinx to obtain more KOs. Bronzor can come in on Ground-type attacks aimed at Shinx and can set up Stealth Rock. The main theats to Shinx are faster Pokemon that can deal heavy damage, so Choice Scarf users in general are good teammates.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Cranidos, quite frankly, hits about as hard as the comet that killed off its dinosaur brethren. Sporting an absolutely monstrous base 125 Attack equal to that of Gyarados all the way in OU, as well as a powerful STAB move in Head Smash, Cranidos is an offensive juggernaut to say the least. It also sports great coverage moves as well and an amazing ability in Mold Breaker. Combine this with good HP and decent Speed, and Cranidos has the potential to flatten unprepared teams.</p> <p>However, not everything is peachy for Cranidos. Its Speed is only average, allowing faster Pokemon to prey on its mediocre defenses and take it out. Priority is also a thorn in Cranidos's side; most of the widely seen priority moves in Little Cup hit Cranidos super effectively, meaning that priority abusers probably need to be eliminated before Cranidos can be used effectively. Once most or all of the threats to Cranidos are gone, it can do what it does best: hit everything in sight as hard as possible.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Cranidos has that massive Attack, which should always be used, it has a respectable special movepool. However, its Special Attack isn't anywhere near as great as its Attack. The only special attacks that should possibly be considered are Ice Beam to hit Ground-types harder, and Fire Blast to hit Grass-types and Ferroseed. Superpower is an option to hit Porygon very hard, though unfortunately it doesn't OHKO Eviolite variants. Thunder Punch is a nice option to hit Water-types.</p> <p>Cranidos can run a Swords Dance set or a set with two boosting moves in Swords Dance and Rock Polish, but it is fairly slow and needs as much coverage as it can get. Choice Band Cranidos hits like an 18-wheeler, but once again Cranidos isn't quite fast enough to abuse it. Paralysis support is recommended if you use Choice Band Cranidos. It also has access to Whirlwind and Stealth Rock, but Cranidos is frail and as such is not exactly the best user of either move. A Substitute + 3 attacks set seems interesting on paper, though Cranidos has trouble setting up due to its frailty.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Switching into Cranidos comes with the problem of taking a hit from something with base 125 Attack, as well as a 150 Base Power STAB move to back it up. Perhaps the best Pokemon for the job are bulky Ground-types such as Hippopotas and Phanpy, which take little damage from Head Smash and most of Cranidos's other moves. They also threaten Cranidos with STAB Earthquake, OHKOing more often than not. Steel-types are the next best option, as they can switch in on anything but Earthquake with relative ease. If you don't have to switch in on an attack from Cranidos, the list of checks increases dramatically. Faster Pokemon and users of priority can take out Cranidos with ease thanks to its only average defenses. Fighting-types with and without priority can maim Cranidos with their super effective STAB moves.</p> ",

Cranidos hits 22 Speed with an Adamant nature and Choice Scarf, allowing it to get the jump on all unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup as well as many Choice Scarf users that sit at 21 Speed. Head Smash hits extremely hard, scoring 2HKOs on most Pokemon in the metagame. However, when Head Smash's recoil starts to get Cranidos's health down to dangerously low levels, it's advised that you use Stone Edge, which doesn't hit quite as hard but lacks recoil, making it a great choice. Earthquake provides great coverage alongside Rock-type moves, and has the added bonus of hitting Pokemon with Levitate thanks to Mold Breaker. Lastly, Zen Headbutt hits common Fighting-types very hard on the switch, while Fire Punch knocks out Ferroseed, which otherwise walls Cranidos nicely.</p> <p>With maximum investment in Cranidos's Attack and an Adamant nature, our dinosaur hits a monstrous 24 Attack. 212 Speed EVs is just enough to hit 22 Speed with a Choice Scarf, outspeeding most unboosted Pokemon and a plethora of Choice Scarf users sitting at 21 Speed. The remaining EVs are put into HP not just to increase Cranidos's overall bulk, but to help it soak up recoil from Head Smash. There are also some other moves you can use on this set. Crunch is a decent option to hit Psychic-types and Ghost-types, but even then it is usually weaker than Head Smash and only slightly more powerful than Stone Edge. Pursuit is a decent move for putting Pokemon in a checkmate position, though Cranidos is strapped for moveslots as it is.</p> <p>Teammates that can take out bulky Ground-types such as Hippopotas are a huge help to Cranidos, as they are its top counters, taking minimal damage from Head Smash. Staryu fits this bill nicely, sporting nice bulk as well as amazing Speed and Special Attack to blow its opponents out of the water. However, Staryu itself and other fast Water-types are nice checks to Cranidos, so Chinchou or Croagunk can be used to take these out easily. Mantyke is also a nice teammate not just because of its Water typing, but because it can easily soak up most of the priority moves being thrown at Cranidos. It also easily takes the Fighting-type moves which can destroy Cranidos. Other teammates must remove the faster Choice Scarf users that can outspeed and eliminate Cranidos; walls such as Ferroseed and Munchlax fit this role to a tee.</p> "

Rock Polish is a given on this set, boosting Cranidos to 30 Speed, enough to outpace all of the unboosted metagame and most boosted Pokemon as well. Stone Edge is used on this set instead of Head Smash, as Cranidos can't afford to take more recoil than it already does from Life Orb, and it is still very powerful. Earthquake is a great coverage move, getting wonderful neutral coverage when combined with Stone Edge. Thanks to Mold Breaker, it also hits Pokemon with Levitate, which is a huge plus. Zen Headbutt allows Cranidos to hit Fighting-type Pokemon very hard on the switch, while Crunch allows Cranidos to hit Ghost-types incredibly hard. Life Orb is the preferred item, allowing Cranidos to switch attacks and giving it a nice power boost. However, Oran Berry is an option to allow Cranidos to stay on the field longer.</p> <p>The EVs for Rock Polish Cranidos are the same as before; maximize Attack for as much firepower as possible, with 212 Speed EVs to hit 15 Speed unboosted and 30 Speed after one Rock Polish. The rest is put into HP to increase Cranidos's overall bulk. This Cranidos greatly appreciates dual screens support to help it set up. Bulky users such as Bronzor are good for this type of business. Bronzor can also set up Stealth Rock, aiding Cranidos in its sweep.</p> <p>Rock Polish Cranidos, like Choice Scarf Cranidos, appreciates Pokemon taking out its counters before it has to come out on the field. Bulky Ground-types can easily be taken out by powerful Water-types such as Mantyke, which also readily takes on Fighting-type attacks and priority for Cranidos. Walls that can stop faster Pokemon from getting the jump on Cranidos are also a help.</p> "

His typing also gives him three common weaknesses, two of which are 4x weaknesses. Even with sky high defenses, these shortcomings severely limit Shieldon's usefulness, making him almost completely incapable of performing any offensive role. Not all is lost for this poor dinosaur, though, as he was blessed with a great ability in Sturdy, which almost always allows him to set up Stealth Rock. With ten resistances and access to Metal Burst, Shieldon can be quite formidable if used correctly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Even though Shieldon's offensive stats are laughably horrible, his exceptional offensive movepool can still contribute to his supporting role. Rock Slide and Stone Edge are powerful STAB moves that hit Dwebble that can be used over Earthquake, but it is often better to have the coverage against other Ground-types. Rock Blast breaks through Substitutes, but similar to the aforementioned STAB moves, it has less merit than Ice Beam. Flamethrower is more reliable than Fire Blast, but Shieldon really needs the extra power to dent Cottonee and Magnemite. Shieldon can also make use of Thunder or Thunderbolt against bulky waters, but he will usually either lose to them anyway or take them down with Metal Burst.</p> <p>Shieldon's other support moves are mostly inferior to Stealth Rock and Metal Burst, but do have their uses. Shieldon's most useful support moves outside the aforementioned Stone Edge and Thunderbolt are Toxic, Roar, and Torment. Toxic stops bulky Water-types like Slowpoke while Roar helps Shieldon abuse Stealth Rock damage. However, aside from these choices, Shieldon's other moves have little to offer. Rock Polish and Curse are not very reliable due to Shieldon's low offenses and common weaknesses. Counter works well against most Fighting-types such as Timburr, but Metal Burst is more useful because it gives Shieldon a way to defeat specially based Pokemon. Magnet Rise helps Shieldon avoid Ground-type moves, but his low Speed and the prevalence of Fighting-types make it difficult for him to set up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>There are few opponents that can stand up against a Metal Burst from Shieldon at full health, but there are a number that Shieldon must be wary of. Magnemite can outspeed Shieldon and revenge kill him with Thunderbolt. Priority, such as Fake Out, and Hail from Snover render Sturdy useless. Fighting-types and bulky Water-types such as Slowpoke can easily take Shieldon out, but must be wary of Metal Burst. Dwebble and other Sturdy users can survive a Metal Burst and rip through Shieldon with an unboosted Earthquake.</p> ",

An Oran Berry helps prevent residual damage from rendering Sturdy useless.</p> <p>It's important to note that the Oran Berry will never get Shieldon back to Sturdy range once he has taken an attack, but it is still an asset to get around residual damage from hail or entry hazards. An Eviolite can give Shieldon more bulk, but with the abundance of Fighting-type priority from Croagunk and Timburr, Shieldon usually won't be lasting very long anyway. Taunt is another option in the second or fourth slot, but due to Shieldon's low Speed, it should only be used for opponents that are switching in or for Trick Room users. 0 Speed IVs and a Sassy nature make Shieldon's Speed as low as possible, which is necessary due to Metal Burst's lack of negative priority.</p> <p>Natu is a good teammate as it can reflect opposing entry hazards and status that could break Shieldon's Sturdy ability on the switch in. Hippopotas gets rid of Snover's hail, but be aware that he cannot take a Blizzard or Giga Drain. Diglett is another great partner, as he gets rid of Magnemite and Nosepass, who can trap Shieldon with Magnet Pull.</p> "

While Storm Drain is the preferred ability on Shellos due to the immunity to Water-type moves and the possible Special Attack boost it brings, Sticky Hold can be used if you don't want your Eviolite taken away due to Trick. Sticky Hold also prevents users of Knock Off from taking your Eviolite, which can be handy in certain situations. Although viable, it is still more situational than Storm Drain.

Even when no EVs are invested, Buneary still hits 22 Speed with a Choice Scarf, outrunning all unboosted LC Pokemon as well as many of the Choice Scarf users which usually have only 21 Speed. While Switcheroo is a great move with Choice Scarf, Buneary often finds itself outclassed in LC as a simple Choice Scarf user.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Buneary has below average defensive stats and an unfortunate weakness to common Fighting-type attacks, thus making Drain Punch users such as Mienfoo great checks. Priority users of Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave are a nuisance, ignoring Buneary's great Speed and destroying the fragile bunny with super effective damage. Gastly is a good check, as it is immune to Normal-type moves and can retaliate with Hidden Power Fighting, though it must be wary as the majority of its sets will be severely disabled by a Choice Scarf or Choice Band via Switcheroo. Pawniard is a good counter, resisting Normal-type attacks and having the potential to set up a Swords Dance. It must watch out for either Flame Orb or Choice Scarf. Cottonee is also a counter to Buneary, as it has access to priority Encore and Substitute, which can force Buneary to switch out often. However, it must watch out for a Choice Scarf set, which can outspeed and KO it.</p> ",

Switcheroo is a good move to carry as it can cripple many Pokemon. Flame Orb burns the opponent, cutting its Attack stat and dealing damage over time. Choice Scarf's ability to lock opponents into one attack can be truly debilitating to many enemies, especially defensive Pokemon that rely on Eviolite. Return is Buneary's primary STAB move. It has a high Base Power and good neutral coverage, but has issues with Ghost-type Pokemon that are immune to it. Encore is useful for locking the opponent into a move--it is intended to be used with Flame Orb, as its function is rather repetitive alongside Choice Scarf Switcheroo. Locking the opponent into a move can give teammates such as Riolu opportunities to set up. Thunder Punch provides neutral coverage against all Ghost-types excluding Golett, which is very rare.</p> <p>The given EVs and nature enable Buneary to achieve the high Speed stat of 18, which allows it to outspeed most Pokemon. An Adamant nature works well to increase power in exchange for Speed, but Buneary must watch out for Ghost-types such as Golett and Frillish, as they will shut it down if it's not running Ice Punch or Thunder Punch. Gastly is a useful teammate, hitting Ghost-types hard with Shadow Ball along with being immune to Fighting-type moves, while in return Buneary is immune to Ghost-type moves and can cripple many bulky Pokemon that may stand in Gastly's way.

Return is the STAB move of choice, dealing heavy damage to all but the bulkiest foes which lack a resistance. Carrying Thunder Punch allows Buneary to hit Ghost-types neutrally, which it wouldn't be able to do otherwise. Switcheroo is useful if Buneary can swap over its Choice Band to the right Pokemon, potentially crippling it; Pokemon such as Gastly are severely hindered by Choice Band. Drain Punch or Jump Kick is useful for hitting Rock- and Steel-types that resist Buneary's STAB. Drain Punch has the benefit of replenishing some of Buneary's health, while Jump Kick has a higher Base Power but unfortunately also has only 95 accuracy and deals recoil damage to Buneary when it misses.</p> <p>Choice Band and Buneary's variety of powerful attacks allow it to hit a wide range of Pokemon very hard. Buneary's high Speed stat allows it to outspeed a large percentage of the Little Cup metagame.

Using Encore with Circle Throw is a great combination when set up correctly. Encore has a lot of potential to force switches, which can be extremely frustrating when Circle Throw is used against the switch-ins to further scout the opposing team. When used in conjunction with entry hazards, this set can actually break through stall. When Buneary gets down to low HP, it can use Healing Wish to sacrifice itself to fully heal one of its crippled or weak teammates. Heal Bell is a useful move, as it will rid your team of all status problems.

With the given EVs, Buneary hits 18 Defense and Special Defense. Running an Adamant nature increases Buneary's damage output and goes along well with its already high Speed stat. Entry hazards such as Stealth Rock or Spikes are integral to bring out this set's full potential. Due to most Little Cup Pokemon having low HP stats, they won't take as much damage, but hazards are still very effective to cut away at their HP, making them easy to KO later on. When using a set such as this, one should keep in mind Buneary's meager defenses, and consider its advantages against Pokemon such as Togepi. Gastly is a good teammate to Buneary.

The main goal of this set is to set up an Agility or two and pass it the boosts on to a slower sweeper, such as Cranidos and Solosis, to help them perform a sweep. Encore can cripple walls, while Substitute can help Buneary Baton Pass, as it blocks status and allows Buneary to survive hits it otherwise could not. Buneary can also Baton Pass a 6 HP Substitute with the listed EV spread. Return is a strong STAB move that can be used if you feel the need to use an attacking move.</p> <p>The EV spread used maximizes Buneary's Speed and HP stats, allowing it to outspeed various threats and take hits better. Buneary can run a more offensive spread of 236 Atk / 4 Def / 236 Spe with Focus Sash. This will allow Buneary to hit harder with its STAB Return. Dizzy Punch can be used over Return for its nifty chance of confusing opponents. Work Up can also be used in conjunction with Baton Pass. Switcheroo + Trick can be used on this set to cripple Pokemon that may feel safe switching into Buneary. As for teammates, slower sweepers such as Cranidos, Litwick, Karrablast, and Solosis are good options, as they are decent Baton Pass receivers. If using a Focus Sash with a more offensive spread, Rapid Spinners can prove to be quite helpful. Also, because faster Taunt users completely shut this set down if Buneary is not carrying an offensive move, Natu makes an excellent partner. Lastly, Shelmet is a good wall that can take Fighting-type moves directed at Buneary. Shelmet can also contribute to a possible Baton Pass chain with Acid Armor.</p> "

Snatch can be fun against an opponent trying to set up a Substitute, but it is quite unreliable. Charm and Toxic are using on a stalling set, but Glameow should really just be attacking due to its low defenses.

Heal Bell is a cool utility move that not many Pokemon get, so if your team has status trouble, stick it on. Chingling gets Curse and Last Resort, so you could run them on the same set and hit foes with a 140 Base Power off a +1 Attack. Having a base Attack stat of 30 makes this dubious at best, however. Charge Beam would be a pretty decent move except that Chingling probably isn't bulky enough to make it worthwhile. If you have faith in it taking a couple of hits, then Charge Beam can work. Disable is typically a not very useful move, but is notable in the fact that Drilbur with Rock Slide and Earthquake can only hit it with one move. A Choice Specs set is usable, but there are better Pokemon for the role. The same goes for a Calm Mind set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Steel-types laugh heartily at Chingling's offense. Both Dark- and Bug-types can wipe out Chingling in one hit with a STAB-boosted move, especially Pokemon such as Sucker Punch Pawniard and Megahorn Karrablast.

The key factor is to make good use of your time while you have the dual screens up.

Bonsly's pure Rock typing, however, leaves it less vulnerable to the many weaknesses given by Geodude's Rock / Ground typing. Bonsly's Attack is high enough to attempt a sweep, and its even higher Defense gives it opportunities to set up, traits other pure Rock-type Pokemon such as Nosepass and Roggenrola lack.

Stealth Rock is a good support move, but Ferroseed and Lileep outclass Bonsly in terms of support.

Furthermore, the popularity of Choice Scarf Flying-type Pokemon means Bonsly can set up with ease, while only receiving minor injuries.</p> <p>Believe it or not, because Bonsly lacks Stone Edge, Double-Edge is its best attacking move; its 120 base power trumps Rock Slide's power of 112 after STAB. Due to Bonsly's ability, Rock Head, the recoil from Double-Edge will be suppressed, allowing the Bonsai Pokemon to sweep effectively without losing too much HP. Rock Slide is a secondary attacking move used for its coverage and high 30% flinch rate. Outside of these two moves, Bonsly doesn't have any other powerful options, barring Explosion and Self-Destruct, so Brick Break is used for coverage. With an Adamant nature, Brick Break has a 99.41% chance of 2HKOing standard Ferroseed, so switch-ins are doomed if you predict well. With an Adamant nature, however, a +2 Bonsly is outsped by Snover and Magnemite holding Choice Scarf, two opponents that Bonsly otherwise beats by outspeeding. Because of this, a Jolly nature is an option if your team has trouble with the aforementioned threats. With Jolly, Bonsly has a minuscule chance (less than 3%) of 2HKOing Ferroseed with Brick Break, but it will always outspeed Snover, and it will at least tie with Timid Choice Scarf Magnemite.</p> <p>If your team has a Steel trapper, you can use Sucker Punch with an Adamant nature in the last slot. This is good for both revenge killing and beating Choice Scarf Gastly before it can use Hidden Power Fighting. Explosion is an option to go out with a bang.</p> <p>Eviolite is an option to improve Bonsly's already impressive Defense stat and make its Special Defense usable, but your team will need lots of entry hazards to make up for the lost power. Bonsly has access to Dig, which can be useful to hit both Poison- and Steel-types, but it is very easy to work around. Fortunately, Bonsly beats any Flying-type Pokemon not named Mantyke, Wingull, or Ducklett, so it isn't too much of a loss.</p> <p>Slowpoke is a good teammate to wall Fighting-type Pokemon. Cottonee is another good teammate; it has excellent synergy with Bonsly and can give it time to set up with Encore. Entry hazards, namely Spikes to hit Steel-type Pokemon harder, are good support options, especially if Bonsly has a Jolly nature, as they make a 2HKO on Ferroseed guaranteed.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>As previously mentioned, Munchlax has a ton of cool options. Stockpile is an interesting option, but in a fast-paced metagame like Little Cup, it's hard for a Normal-type to make full use of the move. Whirlwind is useful on more defensive teams, as Munchlax forces switches with ease. Toxic can be used to cripple bulky Water-types, especially Frillish, but Munchlax 2HKOes most of them anyway so stick to Return. Munchlax also has access to Sunny Day and Rain Dance; these moves should be utilized on weather teams looking for the right weather supporter.</p> <p>Munchlax also has some cool sets it can run. A Substitute and Focus Punch set is a decent option for putting huge dents into nearly anything that switches into Munchlax, namely Lileep, one of Munchlax's best checks. A RestTalk set can be used, but a fast-paced metagame like Little Cup doesn't make such a passive strategy incredibly viable. A Curse set is feasible for boosting Munchlax's mediocre Defense and incredible Attack stats, and gives Munchlax greater sweeping potential. Finally, an Oran Berry and Recycle set gives Munchlax great longevity, but remember that Munchlax won't be taking hits incredibly well without Eviolite.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Like all Normal-types in Little Cup, Munchlax fears Fighting-types. Mienfoo can take a Return from Munchlax, OHKO it with High Jump Kick, get rid of Munchlax's Eviolite with Knock Off, or maintain momentum by forcing a switch with U-turn. Then, Mienfoo can gain HP back simply by switching out thanks to Regenerator. the switch, or simply take Munchlax out with High Jump Kick. Timburr can set up with Bulk Up and take down Munchlax with Drain Punch, while recovering any HP lost. Lileep is one of the best defensive counters to Munchlax as it has access to reliable recovery and great defenses. Similarly, Slowpoke and Frillish can take on Munchlax if it lacks the rare Seed Bomb.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Say hello to Munchlax's most dangerous set. With maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature, Return does serious damage to most Pokemon that don't resist it. Fire Punch hits Steel-types super effectively and is capable of OHKOing Ferroseed and 2HKOing Bronzor. Earthquake hits Chinchou and Ponyta incredibly hard, as it is able to 2HKO or OHKO the aforementioned Pokemon, depending on what EV spread they run. The final moveslot should be tailored towards your team's needs. Pursuit can be used for a likely OHKO on Misdreavus if it's switching out and has taken Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>The given EV spread takes full advantage of Munchlax's stat distribution. An Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment are necessary to ensure that Munchlax 2HKOes most Pokemon with the appropriate coverage move. 236 Special Defense EVs ensure that Munchlax retains excellent special bulk in order to hard counter Snover, Misdreavus, and even Gastly. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Defense to ensure that Munchlax is able to take some physical attacks. Speaking of physical attacks, Munchlax's ability, Thick Fat, allows it to check Larvesta and Ponyta despite Munchlax's mediocre Defense stat. Eviolite is needed to ensure that Munchlax can take hits throughout the course of the battle.</p> <p>As a Normal-type in a tier plagued with Fighting-types, Munchlax certainly needs partners that can defeat the likes of Mienfoo, Timburr, and other powerful Fighting-types. Misdreavus makes for an excellent Mienfoo switch-in, as it is capable of burning the aforementioned Fighting-type with Will-O-Wisp and setting up Nasty Plot, while fearing only the rare Payback. Otherwise, it can just take Mienfoo out with Shadow Ball. Larvesta resists Fighting-type moves, can burn Fighting-types with Flame Body, and does hefty damage with a STAB Flare Blitz. More defensive partners include Shelmet, who defeats all Fighting-types lacking Stone Edge and also setup Spikes, Tentacool, who can set up Toxic Spikes, and Hippopotas, who can shuffle with Yawn, set up Stealth Rock, and support your team with a permanent sandstorm.</p> <p>Munchlax is a Pokemon with a huge movepool; consequently it has some other viable options Body Slam is a weaker alternative to Return, but it has a big upside: a 30% chance of paralyzing the opponent. Seed Bomb is useful for taking down Tirtouga, one of the only Pokemon that has nothing to fear from Munchlax; it is also useful for hitting Frillish. Finally, Rock Slide hits Larvesta super effectively.</p> "

This set makes Skorupi a bit more useful, providing it with recovery in the form of Rest, and \"offenses\" in the form of Sleep Talk. Acupressure randomly raises one of Skorupi's stats by two levels, and it works fantastically in tandem with Sleep Talk to potentially transform Skorupi into a powerful yet bulky mono-attacker. X-Scissor gives Skorupi an attacking move so it can actually do damage to opposing Pokemon. Skorupi is essentially unbeatable if it can get two boosts in its Defense and Special Defense stats, especially since its ability, Battle Armor, stops opposing Pokemon from landing an otherwise devastating critical hit.</p> <p>The given EVs maximize Skorupi's defenses and raise its Attack to sponge hits more easily and do slightly more damage. The remaining EVs are put into HP, so Skorupi can switch into Stealth Rock with a lot more flexibility. A Careful nature increases Skorupi's Special Defense. A good partner for Skorupi is a Pokemon that can set up dual screens such as Bronzor. This allows it to take less damage from super effective attacks such as Fire Blast and Brave Bird. Ferroseed is another good partner, as it can set up entry hazards to weaken Fire- and Flying-types that threaten Skorupi. Doduo checks Skorupi unless it has a Defense boost from Acupressure, as the scorpion's only attacking move, X-Scissor, is ineffective against the two-headed bird who, in turn, can KO with Brave Bird.</p> "

X-Scissor hits harder than Bug Bite, which means it would almost always be the better move to use. However, Bug Bite can steal the opponent's Berry, which is the only reason you would use it over X-Scissor.

Ferroseed is also a good partner, as it can set up both Spikes and Stealth Rock, which will soften up opposing Pokemon for Skorupi. It also allows you to have every entry hazard on just two Pokemon, which is a useful trait in a Little Cup team, as it will deal the maximum amount of damage to any Pokemon switching in, which is always useful. Magnemite poses a threat to Skorupi, so a Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Mienfoo or Timburr, is useful to send it running.

  "Croagunk": {
    "overview": "<p>One of the many Fighting-types in Little Cup, Croagunk is the preeminent utility Pokemon. It has an amazing typing and ability, giving it an immunity to Water and resistances to key attacking types in Fighting and Rock. That Fighting resistance lets it check the dominant Fighting-types in the metagame, such as Mienfoo, Riolu, and Timburr, and hard counter Tirtouga. Croagunk can also beat many common Pokemon on balanced teams, including Chinchou, Lileep, and most Staryu. With its huge movepool, it can act as a solid revenge killer, a general utility check, and even as a bulky setup sweeper, potentially all in one set. However, Croagunk's weakness to Flying is a huge drawback with Murkrow as the best Pokemon in the metagame. It also does poorly against Ghost-types like Drifloon and bulky Ground-types, such as Hippopotas and Sandshrew. Additionally, its attacking stats aren't overly impressive so it can lack some power. Overall, Croagunk excels as the glue for a team, filling gaps and acting as a fail-safe, but can not carry the team on its own.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Croagunk has one of the widest effective movepools in Little Cup. First and foremost, Croagunk can run a Nasty Plot set with Vacuum Wave, Shadow Ball, and Sludge Bomb, using Focus Blast over Sludge Bomb if preferred. Ice Punch is always a solid choice to hit Murkrow, Foongus, and Shroomish effectively at the cost of flexibility. Rock Slide is again handy to hit Murkrow, but it also hits Larvesta and Ponyta meaning Croagunk needs to rely less on a bulky Water-type teammate to handle them. Earthquake can be used for its neutral coverage but it's redundant alongside Croagunk's Fighting STAB and you'd be losing a lot of utility. Pursuit is hilariously weak but it can checkmate highly weakened Misdreavus. Taunt can be a decent option to attempt to prevent setup, but with such low Speed, the opponent is almost always guaranteed at least one turn of setup. Focus Punch can be used with Substitute as a very powerful STAB attack but running it has a huge opportunity cost. Finally, Croagunk's Poison-type STAB in the form of Poison Jab and Gunk Shot can be used, as they're pretty powerful, but they have mediocre-at-best coverage and Gunk Shot is depressingly inaccurate.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ironically, Croagunk's best counter is itself (unless it's running Hidden Power Psychic), resisting its own STAB. Psychic-type attacks are its bane. Abra in particular almost always runs Protect to block Fake Out and will easily KO with Psychic. Shadow Ball will deal a great deal of damage to Abra, however, and some Croagunk run Sucker Punch, so Abra users must be cautious. Staryu with Psychic makes an excellent lure for Croagunk. Flying-types including Murkrow, Drifloon, Vullaby, and Mantyke will deal huge damage with their STAB attacks and take a pittance from Drain Punch. Misdreavus and Drifloon are immune to Drain Punch and can burn Croagunk or KO with Acrobatics, respectively, but must beware of Shadow Ball, Payback, and Sucker Punch. Frillish can burn it and just heal repeatedly with Recover.</p> <p>Larvesta is an excellent counter to Croagunk as it resists Fighting, takes a puny amount of damage from Sucker Punch, and threatens to retaliate with Will-O-Wisp or Flare Blitz. Ponyta can't switch in as easily nor stay in as easily, but again can burn it or smack it with a powerful attack. Ground-types, such as Hippopotas, Drilbur, and Sandshrew, threaten Croagunk immensely with Earthquake and are quite bulky. Bulk Up Timburr can set up on and beat Croagunk lacking Bulk Up or Hidden Power Psychic. Residual damage will wear down Croagunk, and switching in on powerful attacks such as Snover's Blizzard cuts down its lifespan greatly.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Croagunk makes for a fantastic check to Fighting- and Water-types, most importantly to Fighting-types, whose STAB moves Croagunk resists. Drain Punch is a reliable STAB attack, has reasonable power behind it, and provides some healing. Vacuum Wave is a secondary Fighting STAB and is exceptionally useful; it allows Croagunk to reliably revenge kill Snover, Tirtouga, Omanyte, Shellder, and Pawniard. Sucker Punch is a decent option here to hit Misdreavus more powerfully, but it is unreliable and Misdreavus can use Will-O-Wisp or Substitute, switch out, or even just take the hit, as it almost always does only 45%. Shadow Ball gives perfect coverage along with Croagunk's Fighting STAB and lets it hit Ghost- and Psychic-types hard on the switch. It's also handy in mirror matches against other Croagunk with its chance to drop Special Defense. Dark Pulse has a handy flinch chance, but Croagunk is so slow that it will rarely outspeed anything it wants to flinch. Knock Off is the primary move in the last slot, as it is the premier support move in Little Cup, where removing an Eviolite or a Choice Scarf is very often the difference between a win and a loss. However, Fake Out is also viable, assisting Croagunk in revenge killing, but it is quite weak and quite predictable.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Croagunk's bulk while giving Special Attack a nice boost and dumping the rest into Attack. Dry Skin is by far the best ability to use, making Croagunk immune to Water and making Pokemon such as RestTalk Chinchou a source of healing, but Poison Touch is somewhat viable as Dry Skin is often assumed to be its ability and opponents are wary of spamming Water-type moves. The last slot is really open to preference. Hidden Power Psychic (remember to adjust EVs by 4 to make up for the IV reductions) is very viable as it can rarely OHKO opposing Croagunk, always 2HKO Mienfoo and Riolu, and do 40% minimum to Careful Timburr. Ice Punch is also a good option here, as it can deal a hefty amount to Shroomish, Foongus, and Murkrow on the switch. Rock Slide can also be used to hit Larvesta, Murkrow, and Ponyta hard.</p> <p>Croagunk is scared to death of Murkrow so Porygon and Archen make great teammates. Porygon also serves to deal with Misdreavus, Drifloon, and other Ghost-types which can check Croagunk, although Shadow Ball often serves to deter them from switching in with impunity. Abra threatens Croagunk with its Psychic STAB; Murkrow can switch in on Abra, force it out, and set up a Substitute or simply fire off a powerful Brave Bird. Croagunk really isn't too hard to fit onto a team as glue, but make sure it's used in its niches; otherwise, a Pokemon such as Mienfoo is probably better.</p> "

        "name": "Bulk Up",
        "description": "<p>With a Bulk Up set, Croagunk can function as a setup sweeper, and this set highlights many of Croagunk's draws in Little Cup, including the ability to set up on the ubiquitous Fighting- and Water-types. It even beats Bulk Up Timburr without resorting to a low-utility move like Hidden Power Psychic. Bulk Up is required to increase Croagunk's Attack and Defense, letting it serve as a threat after a boost or two. Drain Punch gives good healing to a slow setup Pokemon. It's a pretty powerful STAB with an excellent offensive typing. Sucker Punch gives Croagunk a priority attack and with Drain Punch, gives neutral coverage on everything but opposing Croagunk. It has high power for a priority attack and prevents Croagunk from being revenge killed by frail Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Snover and Drifloon. Payback is a solid option in the last slot for hitting Ghosts using status moves, like Substitute Misdreavus, or Ghosts switching in. Knock Off can be used over Payback purely for its incredible utility, but should only be used if you have a way to deal with Misdreavus with Taunt or Substitute. Vacuum Wave is very much in the same boat as Knock Off, but isn't all that powerful without significant investment, so it should only be used if absolutely required.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Croagunk's bulk while dumping leftover EVs into Attack and Speed. A considerably more offensive spread can be used but will make Croagunk far harder to set up. If using Vacuum Wave, a Brave nature can be used, with Speed EVs moved to Special Attack if desired. Poison Touch is unviable on a Bulk Up set, as being able to be burned by Scald is unacceptable on a Pokemon that sets up on Water-types. Sucker Punch is much less able than a heavily invested Vacuum Wave to revenge kill many threats Croagunk could otherwise check, so keep that in mind. It sets up best on Pokemon that can do little-to-nothing in return, such as Lileep, Chinchou, and Tirtouga. Just remember it's sometimes better mid-game to soften up checks with Drain Punch a little first than to immediately set up. Bulk Up Croagunk can be used as both a mid-game utility Pokemon that beats Chinchou so as to allow MixKrow to wreak havoc or as a late-game sweeper once Misdreavus and Murkrow are removed.</p> <p>Using Substitute in the last slot helps to scout counters and essentially force them to attack next turn, making Sucker Punch that much more effective. Ice Punch is also usable to hit Grass-types and Murkrow harder. Without Ice Punch, Murkrow can easily switch in on Croagunk and force it out with the threat of Brave Bird, making Archen and Porygon excellent teammates. Burn is particularly crippling for Bulk Up Croagunk, making checking Misdreavus a top priority. Porygon again handles it very well. Foongus and Larvesta resist Croagunk's Fighting-type STAB. Insomnia Murkrow and Early Bird Houndour deal with the former with ease while Larvesta is best beaten with Stealth Rock support and a bulky Water-type such as Chinchou.</p> "

It has access to a decent physical and special movepool, as well as a cool ability in Storm Drain, which was buffed since DPP, as it now provides a Special Attack boost whenever it's hit by a Water-type attack. Its other ability, Swift Swim, also makes Finneon a capable user of Rain Dance. Unfortunately, it is mostly outclassed by Chinchou, which has a STAB Volt Switch to work with. All in all, Finneon is an average offensive Pokemon that would've liked a way to stand apart from Chinchou.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Finneon has quite a lot of other support moves; Safeguard is a nice move that prevents the other team from inflicting status for five turns, which is good for offensive teams that despise burn and paralysis. Aqua Ring gives Finneon a way to recover health outside of Oran Berry and Leftovers, but it isn't bulky enough to use the move efficiently. Scald is another option, offering a neat chance of inflicting a burn on other Pokemon, while still getting STAB. Icy Wind is a good option to lower an opponent's Speed, potentially ruining the sweep of a Pokemon such as Elekid, which relies on its Speed. Agility is another option for Finneon to boost its Speed, and it can still run Hidden Power Fire for Ferroseed. The combination of Soak and Toxic is good for finding another way to cripple Ferroseed.</p> <p>Finneon also has quite a few other attacking options as well. Bounce offers a nice 30% paralysis chance, although Ice Beam is a stronger move, and Bounce can be played around without difficulty. Payback is an option for Ghost-types, and is great for Frillish, which is immune to Water- and Normal-type attacks. Hidden Power Ground is an option for hitting Chinchou and Croagunk, but Hidden Power Grass is generally a better attack than Hidden Power Ground.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Finneon is actually quite difficult to beat because it can switch out with U-turn. However, there are a lot of Pokemon that can get an OHKO on it. Chinchou resists Water-type attacks and can KO with Thunderbolt. The Choice Scarf set is easily beaten by Wynaut unless Finneon uses U-turn, but if it doesn't, getting a KO is elementary. The Rain Dance set loses to Choice Scarf Snover with Giga Drain, while Ferroseed beats it with Seed Bomb or Bullet Seed.</p> ",

Surf is Finneon's best option for a STAB attack, as it is very reliable and is backed up by a good amount of power. U-turn is what makes this set stand out, though, as it is one of the two Water-type Pokemon in Little Cup with access to the move--the other being Wingull. Ice Beam hits Grass-types for massive damage, and will most likely do more than U-turn. The last moveslot is dedicated to Hidden Power. Many options are available, depending on what is the most threatening to the rest of the team. Hidden Power Electric allows Finneon to attain BoltBeam coverage, which is resisted by only a handful of Pokemon in Little Cup. Hidden Power Grass hits Chinchou for solid damage, as well as most other Water-types. Finally, Hidden Power Fire allows Finneon to get a super effective hit on Ferroseed and Snover. Choice Scarf allows Finneon to hit 24 Speed, which ties with Choice Scarf Chinchou. Storm Drain is another trait that Finneon can boast to help it stand out from other Water-types, as it can boost its Special Attack without having to waste a move, as well giving it a great immunity to Water-type attacks.</p> <p>The EVs are designed to maximize Special Attack and Speed, while adding another point to Attack and Special Defense. However, it should be noted that the EVs in Special Defense should be moved to Attack, Special Attack, and Speed in order to account for the drop in IVs if using Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Fire. Good partners for this set are Pokemon which can easily take out Chinchou, which can take most of Finneon's attacks with ease. Examples of Pokemon that are good at sponging Chinchou's attacks are Munchlax and Lileep, as well as Wynaut--a Pokemon which can guarantee a KO with Mirror Coat, given Chinchou doesn't have Volt Switch. Pokemon that can easily KO Munchlax are also helpful, and Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo are two of the finest examples. A Grass-type, if Finneon does not have Hidden Power Grass, is also important to take out the uncommon Wooper, which ignores Special Attack boosts thanks to Unaware.</p> "

Aqua Tail is a good physical STAB attack that inflicts a decent amount of damage on most threats, but Waterfall is a more accurate option, at the cost of a little attack power. Hidden Power Grass is for other Water-types, namely Chinchou, while Ice Beam hits Grass-types super effectively. Return is a good move to use alongside Water-type attacks, as the combination only loses to Frillish, but U-turn is a valid option in order to switch to another Rain Dance sweeper.

Don't let this steer you away from using Mantyke, though, as it does have a few more things going for it. It has the best Special Defense in Little Cup by far and it possesses two great abilities, allowing it to be both a defensive and offensive threat.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Unfortunately, Mantyke's movepool is very shallow, so it doesn't have many other options available to it. An Agility set can be used, but this is generally outclassed by the Swift Swim as it lacks the power of rain-boosted Hydro Pump. However, it does have some advantages such as Snover switch-ins not taking away Mantyke's Speed boost, the ability to run Water Absorb as the ability, and the ability to hit Ferroseed with Hidden Power Fire. Mantyke could utilize Haze, which can help against boosting sweepers like Misdreavus and Timburr, but it is hard pushed for a moveslot. A bulky set with Aqua Ring is an option, but the recovery is generally not large enough and it will be beaten by status moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Chinchou is undoubtedly the best Mantyke counter in the tier. It can take anything Mantyke throws at it, only worrying about the rare Life Orb-boosted Hidden Power Grass. It resists every other common attack, uses Rest to prevent Mantyke from defeating it with Toxic, and can KO Mantyke with any of its Electric STAB moves. Other Electric-types or Pokemon that use Electric moves give Mantyke a lot of trouble. Good examples are Magnemite and Staryu, who can both force it out rather easily with Thunderbolt. Ferroseed and Lileep are also troublesome to face. Ferroseed takes very little from any of Mantyke's moves and can set up entry hazards or use Leech Seed to slowly drain Mantyke's health. Lileep only fears Toxic or a Life Orb-boosted Ice Beam, but if you're not carrying those moves, it will take on Mantyke with ease. Both of these Pokemon can set up Stealth Rock which wears Mantyke down and discourages it from switching in too often. Many other bulky Pokemon such as Porygon or Frillish can also wear Mantyke down if it is not carrying Toxic.</p> <p>A good way to deal with Mantyke is to hit it on its weaker Defense stat. Pawniard will damage Mantyke severely with Sucker Punch if it is not running Substitute. Tirtouga can survive a hit with Sturdy and proceed to KO back with Stone Edge. If Mantyke hasn't had the chance to set up Rain Dance, Drilbur and Sandshrew can both outspeed and KO with Rock Slide. Although it is primarily a special attacker, Snover deserves a mention as it can switch into Hydro Pump from the Rain Dance set, remove rain thanks to Snow Warning, and 2HKO with Blizzard. It must be wary of Air Slash, however.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its great defenses, Mantyke is a good candidate for a RestTalk set. With the given EVs and an Eviolite, Mantyke reaches a Special Defense stat of 30, allowing it to take on many special attackers such as Snover and Misdreavus. Thanks to the Defense investment and its secondary Flying typing, it can also take on many Fighting-types such as Timburr, Croagunk, and Mienfoo, although it must watch out for the occasional Stone Edge from the latter. The various Grass-types of the tier, such as Shroomish and Foongus, also fear this set since Mantyke shrugs off the status moves that they commonly carry with Rest.</p> <p>Rest and Sleep Talk are the mandatory moves; Rest is Mantyke's only form of recovery and it removes status such as Toxic, which would otherwise cripple it severely, whilst Sleep Talk stops Mantyke from being dead weight after it has used Rest. Air Slash is Mantyke's most reliable STAB move, and it allows it to take on the aforementioned Fighting- and Grass-types. The last moveslot is a toss-up between Scald and Toxic. Scald is a decent secondary STAB and it deals a large amount of damage to Rock-, Ground-, and Fire-types. The 30% burn chance is also appreciated which can help against physical attackers. However, Toxic is great for crippling bulky Pokemon like Lileep, Porygon, and Frillish, which would otherwise shrug off Mantyke's weak attacks. Toxic and Scald can be used in conjunction, but this is generally not recommended as Mantyke will then be walled by Croagunk, Shroomish, and Foongus.</p> <p>156 HP EVs give Mantyke an HP stat of 23, which is a Stealth Rock number, allowing Mantyke to take 5 HP damage instead 6 HP upon switching in. Maxed out Defense and a Bold nature are also chosen to boost Mantyke's lower defensive stat as much as possible. The remaining EVs are put into Special Defense and Special Attack. Water Absorb is the ability of choice, but do not expect it to see too much use, as many Water-types carry moves that hit Mantyke super effectively, such as Electric-type moves from Staryu and Chinchou, or Rock-type moves from Tirtouga. There is a not a lot of other options to use in the final slot. Hidden Power Fire could be used to hit Ferroseed, but this is far too situational as Air Slash and Scald are superior in almost all other situations.</p> <p>Due to Mantyke's Stealth Rock weakness, it needs to be paired with a Rapid Spin user. Drilbur can spin and also absorb Electric-type attacks aimed at Mantyke. Staryu is another option for a spinner, but it adds to Mantyke's Electric-type weakness. Mantyke appreciates a partner that can take on Electric-types such as Chinchou and Magnemite. A Chinchou of your own is a great choice to wall these Pokemon, whilst Mantyke can beat Grass-types that counter it. Lileep and Porygon are also good Pokemon that can beat Chinchou, and Mantyke can handle the Fighting-types that threaten them. Finally, Croagunk can take on many of Mantyke's counters such as Chinchou, Magnemite, Lileep, and Ferroseed.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Mantyke can also take a more offensive approach with a Rain Dance set. Under rain, it gets a boost to its STAB Water-type moves as well as doubled Speed thanks to Swift Swim. With the prevalence of sand teams in the metagame, Mantyke has a great niche in disrupting the weather. The idea of this set is simple: Mantyke should set up Rain Dance against something that can do little to it, such as Hippopotas or Croagunk, and proceed to tear through the opposing team with its powerful Hydro Pump. Ice Beam is the main coverage move of choice as it can 2HKO Lileep with a Life Orb, allowing Mantyke to break through one of its would-be counters. Air Slash is a good secondary STAB move, hitting Snover and Croagunk for super effective damage. Substitute is another option which can be used over Air Slash or Ice Beam. This helps Mantyke avoid a Sucker Punch from Pawniard, but Croagunk will be an issue if it goes over Air Slash, and Lileep will wall Mantyke if it goes over Ice Beam.</p> <p>The choice between Eviolite and Life Orb is a tough one. While the power difference is noticeable if you don't have a Life Orb, Eviolite will give Mantyke a much easier time setting up. If Life Orb is your item of choice, make sure you change the HP IVs to 0, which will give Mantyke only 1 HP recoil. Timid is an alternative option for the nature, which avoids the Speed tie with Choice Scarf Misdreavus, but this situation is rare, so Modest is the recommended ability. As for possible changes to the moveset, Hidden Power Grass can be used to 2HKO the standard RestTalk Chinchou on the switch in with a Life Orb.</p> <p>Mantyke appreciates certain Pokemon removed before it sweeps, particularly Chinchou, Staryu, Lileep, and Ferroseed. Croagunk has the ability to beat all of these Pokemon and also lures out Hippopotas and Bronzor which Mantyke can set up on. Croagunk's ability Dry Skin also benefits from the rain. Diglett can switch in on a predicted Electric-type move and proceed to trap and kill Chinchou, but it must be wary of switching into Hydro Pump or Scald. Lileep beats Chinchou and Staryu, and can also set up Stealth Rock which can help Mantyke get some KOs. In fact, most Grass-types can handle Chinchou and Staryu, making them great partners for Mantyke.</p> "

Overall, Patrat is a weak Pokemon that has a very small niche in Little Cup and should rarely be considered for use on a team.</p> ",

Patrat learns Dig, Iron Tail, Pursuit, and Revenge, but it lacks the Attack stat to do any sweeping with these moves.

Toxic could be used to cripple bulky Pokemon, but Patrat is usually better off trying to attack. Endure and Flail could be used, but priority, Hail, and Sandstorm all ruin the strategy. A mixed or physically offensive set with Eviolite is an option, but other Pokemon are much better at it than Patrat is.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ghost-types are great if Patrat lacks Crunch thanks to their immunity to Normal-type moves. Vullaby and Hippopotas can phaze Patrat away easily and can heal off any damage taken later in the battle. Fighting-types can KO Patrat quite easily, making them very solid checks.

Pawniard and Houndour are good teammates for Patrat because they can both KO Gastly and benefit from the stat boosts Patrat provides. Faster Fighting-types such as Mienfoo can easily get in a super effective Drain Punch. Duskull can handle those Fighting-types, meaning that it can be an excellent teammate.

Reversal can be used on the set; however, it is both risky and somewhat redundant. Yawn, Thunder Wave, Roar, and Toxic can be used as fillers or as the main moves of their own set, though other Pokemon run these moves better and Lillipup just doesn't have the space on a moveset for it. Lillipup also has a fairly extensive special movepool, though it unfortunately really can't use it due to its terrible base 25 Special Attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Fighting-types can lay down the hurt on Lillipup, though most will take a number from Return if they come in on it. Anything that is faster than Lillipup and takes little damage from one of its moves can be called checks if they can dispose of it easily.

Fire Fang allows Lillipup to hit Steel-types hard, the most important of which is Ferroseed, which completely walls this set otherwise. Lastly, Crunch allows Lillipup to hit Ghost-types, including the aforementioned Frillish. Ice Fang is another coverage option that enables Lillipup to hit Dragon-types for huge damage.</p> <p>This set uses maximum investment in Attack and Speed to maximize the damage that Lillipup can cause.

Moves such as Dig and Aerial Ace can be used if your team needs it, but they really don't need to be used over any of the moves listed as Lillipup will lose coverage on important Pokemon if it chooses to forgo Crunch. Lillipup can also be a good user of Choice Scarf, hitting 22 Speed with an Adamant nature, meaning that it has power as well as Speed.

Sadly, Purrloin is easily checked by many Fighting-types and sweepers abundant in the metagame.

With 17 Speed, Purrloin can be played offensively with Swagger and Foul Play or as a supporter with Thunder Wave and Knock Off. Thunder Wave cripples threats, such as Mienfoo, that frequently switch out with U-turn.

However, attacking is best left to dedicated Trick Room sweepers since no EVs are invested in Munna's Special Attack, and you wouldn't want to waste precious turns dishing out inadequate damage.

Eviolite adds to Munna's bulk, allowing it to reliably take a hit and set up Trick Room.</p> <p>A Relaxed nature is always used over a Modest or Quiet nature because Munna's bulk is one of two reasons to use it over Solosis to set up Trick Room.

    "overview": "<p>Tympole doesn't seem like much at first glance: it doesn't have a large movepool, and its base stats are all pretty poor. However, it becomes a dangerous offensive threat in the rain, reaching over 30 Speed—one of the few Pokemon in Little Cup to hit over 30 Speed in the rain even with a neutral nature, setting it apart from other similar sweepers. Despite the fact that it doesn't have typical moves for a Water-type (such as Ice Beam), it gets others that easily make up for them. Overall, Tympole isn't to be underestimated, as it can make unprepared teams pay heavily.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tympole has few other options it can use, as its movepool is small. Hyper Voice can be used for its high Base Power, but it lacks the coverage offered by Tympole's other moves. Tympole can also utilize Hydration by running a support set in the rain with options such as Toxic, Rest, and Aqua Ring, with either Leftovers or Eviolite as the item, but rain is not permanent in Little Cup. Muddy Water can be used to lower the foe's accuracy and has the same Base Power as Surf, but its accuracy is imperfect, making it a poor option. Tympole also gets Confuse Ray, but confusion is a very unreliable status condition. Tympole also has a decent base 50 Attack stat, but it has no physical options to work with.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Munchlax takes all of Tympole's attacks with ease thanks to its huge Special Defense, and can severely weaken it with Return. Ferroseed doesn't take much from Earth Power and laughs at Tympole's other moves, and can set up entry hazards or KO Tympole with Bullet Seed or Seed Bomb. Choice Scarf Snover takes away the rain that Tympole relies on and can KO it with Giga Drain, but Snover must be wary of Sludge Wave as it switches in. Chinchou can revenge kill Tympole with Thunderbolt, but can't switch in directly, as it will be KOed by Earth Power. Due to its weak defensive stats, Tympole will also take a large amount of damage from priority attacks, meaning that users of those attacks, such as Croagunk, can finish off Tympole with ease.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Tympole's decent coverage, giving it the best chance of pulling off a sweep. Hydro Pump is its strongest STAB attack and has an incredible amount of power in the rain, enabling Tympole to hit a wide range of threats very heavily. However, Surf is an alternative if accuracy is an issue. Sludge Wave smacks the Grass-types that resist Hydro Pump, and easily OHKOes Snover—something not every Swift Swim sweeper can boast—as it switches in to end the rain. Earth Power gives Tympole more coverage, allowing it to easily KO both Croagunk and Chinchou, two threats to rain teams. There are two options for the last moveslot. Hidden Power Electric is Tympole's most powerful option against other Water-types, destroying Mantyke for instance, which can take its other attacks with ease. On the other hand, Rain Dance allows Tympole to sweep on its own instead of relying upon team support, and also helps it maintain its Speed boost even as weather changers, such as Snover, switch in.</p> <p>Since Tympole already reaches more than 30 Speed in the rain, a Timid nature won't be of much use. As such, due to Tympole's weak offensive stats, a Modest nature and a Life Orb are used to maximize the power of Tympole's attacks. Tympole needs Rain Dance support from its teammates to sweep most of the time, as it will otherwise have trouble outspeeding faster threats. Bronzor makes a great choice, as its bulk allows it to set up both Rain Dance and Stealth Rock with ease. Voltorb, although frail, can set up Rain Dance reliably with its high Speed, and allow Tympole to switch in safely with Explosion. Other Rain Dance sweepers, such as Kabuto and Omanyte, can weaken the opponent's team and clear the way for Tympole to sweep, but both share its weaknesses.</p> "

It has relatively low attacking stats and mediocre Speed, but its movepool is deep enough for it to pull off a sweep. It also has a decent ability in Chlorophyll, which helps remedy its poor Speed. Even so, it misses out on a lot of great moves that other Chlorophyll users do have, such as Growth, Sleep Powder, and Weather Ball. Its defenses are fairly high, but it doesn't have the typing or support movepool in order for it to take hits effectively. Sewaddle also has quite the long list of weaknesses. Being weak to Fire-, Rock-, and Ice-type attacks, Sewaddle won't be hanging around for long. Even so, Sewaddle should be considered for a teamslot on any Sunny Day team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A bulky set might seem viable, but Sewaddle's support movepool is limited to only Toxic and Swagger. Sewaddle also has access to Endure and Flail, but it is vulnerable to priority attacks, which are common in Little Cup. Sewaddle also gets Baton Pass, but the only reliable boosts that it can get are from Calm Mind and Agility, and Sewaddle will be hard-pressed to find a good time to set up due to its weakness to Stealth Rock. Despite its higher Attack stat, Sewaddle doesn't get many physical attacks worth mentioning, so it can't run an effective physical set. Sewaddle also has Air Slash, but the move doesn't get great coverage along with the rest of its attacks. Sewaddle can use Swarm as an ability, using Agility, Substitute, and Bug Bite to take advantage of the boost that Swarm gives to hit harder, but it is still quite vulnerable to priority.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Anything that outspeeds Sewaddle and has a super effective attack is probably going to be at least a check to it. If Snover avoids Bug Buzz or Hidden Power Fire on the switch, it can OHKO with Blizzard if Sewaddle didn't get a Calm Mind boost first. Fire-type attacks absolutely destroy it, and even the lightest singe will probably be enough to knock Sewaddle out--especially if Sunny Day is up. Sewaddle's weakness to every entry hazard limits the amount of switch-ins it has, so Pokemon that can set them up are good. Any Flying-type attack will also KO Sewaddle with ease because of its 4x weakness. Sewaddle is also very vulnerable to priority attacks in Fake Out, Extreme Speed, and Sucker Punch. Finally, Munchlax and Lickitung take next to nothing from its attacks and can easily OHKO back with Fire Punch.</p> ",

Although it lacks Growth, an absolutely amazing move for any Chlorophyll sweeper to have, it does gets Calm Mind, a noticeably weaker but still decent boosting move. Sewaddle's decent defenses allow it to absorb a hit and get off a Calm Mind, and with the given EV spread, Sewaddle will be sitting at 28 Speed while Sunny Day is up, which is enough to outpace the unboosted metagame, as well as most Choice Scarf users. Solar Beam is Sewaddle's strongest STAB attack and gets great coverage in tandem with Hidden Power Fire. However, Hidden Power Ice can be used to cover Dragon- and Flying-types. Bug Buzz is Sewaddle's most reliable STAB attack, netting an OHKO on Choice Scarf Snover on the switch, taking out a prime threat to any Sunny Day team. Timid is the best nature because it allows Sewaddle to beat most Choice Scarf users, as well as most other (since Sewaddle abuses sun itself and all) Chlorophyll abusers, although a Modest nature can be used if a lack of power is an issue. Life Orb is the preferred item because Sewaddle is going to need all the power it can get.</p> <p>Sewaddle can set up Sunny Day itself, but it would be hard to get off both a Sunny Day and a Calm Mind without taking substantial damage or getting KOed. Energy Ball is an option over Solar Beam for increased reliability, but the difference in power is incredibly noticeable. Sunny Day supporters are the best options for teammates so that Sewaddle can get the boost to its mediocre Speed, the best of those being Munchlax. Pokemon with Flash Fire, such as Houndour, are the only Pokemon that will enjoy taking Fire-type attacks in Sunny Day, so they are always appreciated. Finally, other Chlorophyll sweepers such as Oddish and Bellsprout are also good for picking teams apart alongside Sewaddle.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Petilil is one of the newly introduced Pokemon this generation. It possesses a great Special Attack stat, a good movepool, and when used in the sun, Chlorophyll grants it an amazing Speed stat. Petilil's typing also gives it a useful resistance to common Water- and Ground-type moves. Furthermore, it is one of the very few Pokemon in the LC metagame that have access to a sleep-inducing move. Alas, Petilil's only downfall is its bad defenses. Overall, Petilil is a lethal sweeper and certainly deserves a slot on any Sunny Day team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Although it's a little gimmicky, Petilil can run Synthesis to heal 2/3 of its health in the sun. Stun Spore provides additional team support by paralyzing an opponent, but Sleep Powder is generally better. Leaf Storm is Petilil's most powerful STAB move, and it hits Hippopotas that switch into a predicted Solar Beam. Petilil can also run Healing Wish to heal a teammate at the cost of its life. Energy Ball is a stronger STAB alternative to Giga Drain. Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit troublesome Dragon-types such as Dratini. Lastly, Petilil can run a SubSeed set, but other Grass-types, such as Oddish, generally outclass it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Snover is the best counter to Petilil. It can come in, change the weather to hail, outpace Petilil, and OHKO it with Blizzard. Although they have to be wary of Sleep Powder, Fire-types, such as Houndour, are good counters as they resist both of Petilil's common attacking moves and can hit back with a super effective STAB move. Dratini is another check to Petilil as it resists both of Petilil's offensive moves and doesn't care about Sleep Powder, thanks to Shed Skin. If Petilil isn't carrying Hidden Power Fire, Ferroseed becomes a solid counter. Ferroseed takes very little damage from any of Petilil's moves, and uses Petilil as setup fodder. Lastly, Hippopotas can be a problem if you decide to use Solar Beam over Giga Drain on Petilil.</p> ",

Petilil hits 26 Speed with Chlorophyll, which allows it to beat every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame and a handful of Choice Scarf users, such as Cranidos and Growlithe. Solar Beam and Giga Drain are powerful STAB options: Solar Beam is a very powerful STAB move that should only be used in the sun, while Giga Drain is a weaker move that can be used in any weather condition to recover some HP. Hidden Power Fire benefits from Sunny Day and provides great coverage along with Petilil's Grass-type STAB. The fourth slot is a choice between utility and power. Sleep Powder puts the opponent to sleep, whereas Growth boosts Petilil's Special Attack stat by two stages in sunlight.</p> <p>Eviolite improves Petilil's bulk, and even though Petilil has bad defenses, its Grass typing makes up for it. Life Orb can be used to grant Petilil more power, but it loses out on a significant amount of bulk.

Hidden Power Rock can be used over Hidden Power Fire to hit Flying-types, such as Taillow.</p> <p>If you opt to use Hidden Power Rock, Petilil cannot do anything to Steel-types, such as Ferroseed, making Fire-types, such as Houndour, good teammates.

It can pose a threat to even bulky walls such as Munchlax, Frillish, and Bronzor, use Pursuit to trap Misdreavus and Abra, or even throw in Hone Claws to make it a decent set-up sweeper.

While Darumaka is undoubtedly the strongest physical attacker in Little Cup, there are a few reasons why the blazing critter has not centralized the metagame. While Flare Blitz is certainly powerful, it comes with a heavy price in 1/3 recoil, a price that decidedly limits Darumaka's sweeping abilities despite a good HP stat. Not only does Darumaka suffer from recoil, but it is exposed to all forms of residual damage, most notably being weak to Stealth Rock. Despite its limitations, Darumaka is an interesting Pokemon that will burn holes in the opponent's team easily.</p> ",

A set of Belly Drum, Encore, Fire Punch, and Brick Break can easily set up and abuse Belly Drum. Ideally, you would want to pass some Speed boosts to Darumaka. Darumaka has other means of boosting its stats, notably Flame Charge and Work Up, which can be used with Fire Punch, Brick Break, and Rock Slide.</p> <p>Darumaka gets some nice movepool combinations, such as SubPunch with Encore. The point of this set is to switch in on something that tries to set up or use a weak move such as Porygon using Recover or Ice Beam, and use Encore. The opponent will be forced to switch out while you can set up Substitute and attack with a cushion. This also allows Darumaka to use Focus Punch without losing its focus. Lastly, Darumaka gets some cool alternative moves such as Flame Wheel, Fire Fang, Hammer Arm, and Roar that can be used in place of more destructive moves. It also has the choice of Life Orb, but the added residual damage really inhibits Darumaka.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ponyta, Houndour, and Growlithe all have Flash Fire and can switch into Darumaka's STAB moves while boosting their own.

The best way to defeat Darumaka is with residual damage; Stealth Rock and Spikes, especially the former, will do a lot of damage to Darumaka. Munchlax with Thick Fat can switch into Flare Blitz and cause Darumaka to take a lot of recoil damage due to Munchlax's high HP stat. Sandstorm and hail can also be used to wear Darumaka down very well. In the rain, Water-types can easily switch into Flare Blitz and OHKO Darumaka with just about any Water-type attack.

Choice Band and Choice Scarf play differently, but Darumaka excels at using both items.</p> <p>Choice Scarf is usually the item of choice for a few reasons. With Hustle, Darumaka already hits an Attack stat of 27, which is higher than even Cranidos's Attack stat, effectively making Darumaka the strongest physical attacker in the tier. Holding a Choice Scarf allows Darumaka to outpace all unboosted Pokemon in the tier, as well as a fair share of opponents that commonly hold a Choice Scarf, including Magnemite and Snover. Darumaka's powerful Flare Blitz will OHKO just about any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, and Darumaka will probably outspeed them as well. This means that this fiery blob will probably take out a few members of the opponent's team before succumbing to priority and recoil.</p> <p>By contrast, with a Choice Band around Darumaka's wrist, its Attack skyrockets to a jaw dropping stat of 40. With 40 Attack, it is safe to say that anything lacking Flash Fire will fall to a Flare Blitz with Stealth Rock or Spikes. Even attacks that aren't boosted by STAB, such as Superpower and Rock Slide, will do tremendous damage and OHKO anything that they hit super effectively. Overall, 40 Attack is truly scary and makes Choice Band Darumaka the true threat that it is.</p> <p>If you're among the select few who prefer reliability over power on Choice sets, Brick Break is a viable alternative to Superpower. If the opponent's Frillish and Slowpoke are eliminated, Brick Break is a better option over Superpower, having the potential to run through the opposing team. Return has attractive power, accuracy, and decent coverage that could make it usable over Rock Slide or U-turn. Beware, however, of the many Pokemon that take little damage from Return.</p> <p>Darumaka has trouble with Slowpoke and Fire-types carrying Flash Fire, both very common in Little Cup. Prime examples of Pokemon that can get rid of them include Chinchou and Staryu. Chinchou has perfect offensive synergy with Darumaka, and they do not have bad defensive synergy, either. Chinchou can make a great partner with Darumaka using the combination of U-turn and Volt Change to perplex your opponent. Defensive variants can cripple faster opponents with Thunder Wave so that Choice Band Darumaka can plow through the opponent's teams. Staryu can do the same and also has Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock, but it doesn't get STAB Electric-type moves like Chinchou does.

The move in the second slot depends on your team; if it has trouble with physical attackers, you can use Will-O-Wisp to cripple them. Otherwise, you can use Yawn to force switches or put a foe to sleep. Yawn's ability to force switches is especially great when lots of entry hazards are present. Using it in tandem with U-turn, Darumaka can play mind games with the opponent to cause even more switches and rack up the damage with hazards and U-turn. U-turn also allows Darumaka to make advantageous switches against opposing switch-ins trying to take advantage of Encore or Yawn. Additionally, it can net a few KOs here and there against frail Pokemon that take super effective damage from it, such as Zorua.</p> <p>Fire Punch is the best STAB move Darumaka has for this set in terms of power and consistency.

A Rapid Spin user, Taunt lead, or Magic Mirror user can help keep hazards, especially Stealth Rock, off the field. Some good examples are Staryu and Natu, respectively representing the three categories. Darumaka wants hazards on the other side of the field too; Ferroseed can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes, and resists the Water- and Rock-type attacks that Darumaka fears. Darumaka also gets Taunt, which can be used in the second moveslot if the other moves don't appeal to you.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Due to its great defenses and usable Special Attack, Yamask can effectively set up Trick Room in order to sweep the opposition while still supporting your team. Yamask's pure Ghost typing means that its only weaknesses are Dark- and Ghost-type attacks, providing it with ample opportunities to set up Trick Room repeatedly throughout a match. Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting provide perfect coverage, allowing Yamask to sweep without fear of being resisted. Once Trick Room is set up, switch out to your dedicated Trick Room sweeper or have Yamask start boosting its Special Attack with Nasty Plot. After a single boost, Yamask reaches 30 Special Attack, which is capable of denting even the strongest of walls, such as Munchlax. Oran Berry helps restore a significant amount of health once Yamask is weakened, giving it more chances to set up Trick Room and sweep.</p> <p>The Special Defense and HP EVs complement Yamask's naturally high Defense stat, making it fairly bulky. The rest of the EVs are placed into Special Attack to boost its offensive capabilities.</p> <p>Since Yamask is likely to set up Trick Room, Trick Room sweepers are obligatory partners. Sweepers such as Porygon, Aron, and Wailmer can plow through the opponent's team under Trick Room. If you're using Yamask on a dedicated Trick Room team, then another Trick Room supporter such as Bronzor or Slowpoke is mandatory. Other slow, powerful Pokemon such as Munchlax and Cubone will find Yamask's Trick Room a blessing as well, as they can now outspeed most foes and put their attacking prowess to good use.</p> "

After just two Calm Minds, Yamask reaches 24 Special Attack and 30 Special Defense, making it quite bulky and threatening at the same time. Thanks to its typing and its ability, Mummy, the opponent will switch out more often than not when faced with Yamask, allowing it to net that extra Calm Mind boost. Will-O-Wisp and Hex is a combination that can cause havoc upon your foe. Will-O-Wisp drains the opponent's health, reduces their Attack, and doubles the Base Power of Hex, making it the ideal status move for Yamask's arsenal. Hidden Power Fighting provides flawless coverage alongside Hex by hitting Dark- and Steel-types for super effective damage. Oran Berry is there to restore a good chunk of health and hopefully give Yamask another chance at sweeping.</p> <p>The HP, Defense, and Special Defense EVs are designed to take advantage of Yamask's natural bulk, boosting its ability to set up Calm Mind in the face of attacks, which helps Yamask fulfill its ultimate goal of sweeping. The remaining EVs are placed in Speed in an attempt to boost Yamask's meager base Speed and allow it to outspeed defensive threats such as Bronzor and Duskull.</p> <p>This set can easily be checked by faster Ghost-types such as Gastly, which can KO Yamask before it has a chance to set up. For this reason, pairing Yamask up with other bulky attackers is not a bad idea. Munchlax is a great candidate as it is immune to Ghost-type attacks and has Pursuit to remove the mentioned threats. With Will-O-Wisp and Mummy, Yamask can help other members of your team, such as Pawniard, sweep easier as well. Encore users such as Cottonee are another major threat to this set, since Yamask's sweep will be ruined if one of its non-damaging moves gets Encored. As such, it is best to switch out to a heavy-damage dealer such as Aron to smash them. In the case of Cottonee, Paras is a suitable partner as it not only has X-Scissor to slice the cotton ball, but is also immune to Leech Seed.</p> "

With base 80 Special Attack, base 65 Speed, and subpar defenses, Zorua appears to be a canine similar to Houndour without the STAB Fire Blast and Flash Fire to worry about, making it seem underwhelming in comparison. However, looks can be very deceiving thanks to Zorua's signature ability, Illusion, which allows it to masquerade as a teammate in the user's party. Sadly, with Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo running around with strong Fighting-type priority moves, Zorua must also tread carefully to not make a fatal mistake. Despite its weaknesses, opponents must still be on their guard with this mischievous little fox now running around the ranks of Little Cup.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Zorua has access to Swords Dance and Agility, but is hindered by a shallow physical movepool and low defenses. A set utilizing Work Up could be passable, but it would be inferior to the mixed set. Its movepool also includes Taunt, Torment, Memento, and Substitute, but Zorua is better off attacking.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Anything that can deal heavy damage with a priority move is a problem for Zorua, especially Timburr and Croagunk, which have a good chance of OHKOing Zorua with Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, respectively. Mienfoo can tank Extrasensory and hit back even harder with Drain Punch while restoring health. Faster enemies, specifically Diglett and Choice Scarf Mienfoo, have an easy time revenge killing Zorua after its Illusion is exposed, or even before if the opponent is not fooled. Special tanks such as Munchlax and Mantyke that have offensive power can also take advantage of Zorua's mediocre defenses and rip through the fox with a powerful STAB move.</p> ",

        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>With the element of surprise on its side, Zorua is easily capable of taking out an unsuspecting opponent or tricking them into switching out. Dark Pulse is Zorua's second strongest STAB move on the special side next to Night Daze, but the former should be used for its flinch rate and higher accuracy. Priority in the form of STAB Sucker Punch hits like a truck against anything that does not resist it. Hidden Power Fighting hits everything that Dark Pulse does not for at least neutral damage, bar Croagunk, who is OHKOed by Extrasensory.</p> <p>The choice of Zorua's disguise should be something that shares at least one move with this set. Croagunk is generally one of the best choices because it lures Psychic-type attacks, resists Fighting and Bug, and has shared access to Dark Pulse. A 2 HP IV is the lowest possible to maximize Hidden Power Fighting's Base Power while getting Zorua to 19 HP for minimized Life Orb recoil. Night Daze has a higher Base Power than Dark Pulse, but is Zorua's signature move, so using it will automatically give away its disguise. Pursuit and U-turn can be useful on this set, but Zorua can't afford to give up a slot for them.</p> <p>Fighting-types tend to be the most problematic for Zorua, especially those with access to Mach Punch, such as Timburr. Residual damage also really hurts Zorua mostly because it has a chance to expose its disguise. When your opponent sees a Croagunk becoming poisoned by Toxic Spikes, chances are that they will become suspicious of Zorua's Illusion. For this problem, Magic Bounce Natu makes a great partner, sporting a 4x resistance to Fighting and being capable of setting up dual screens to increase Zorua's chances of survival. Ghost-types such as Gastly can switch into Bug-type and Fighting-type attacks aimed at Zorua. Wynaut counters Choice Scarf users, which can revenge kill Zorua provided that they are aware of Zorua's Illusion. Entry hazards of your own are also greatly appreciated, so Ferroseed and Bronzor are great partners to lay them down for Zorua.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Zorua is also capable of utilizing a Choice Scarf to be an effective revenge killer. Dark Pulse is used in the first slot primarily for the flinch rate, but Night Daze is still another choice for the chance to lower accuracy. Hidden Power Fighting in conjunction with Zorua's STAB Dark-type move gives him near perfect neutral coverage against everything in Little Cup that isn't named Croagunk. U-turn is used for scouting and allows Zorua to make a quick escape if the opponent switches to a potential counter. The last slot is mainly filler, but Pursuit is generally recommended to cripple fleeing Psychic-types.</p> <p>A Naive or Hasty nature is used here to avoid decreasing the power of U-turn and Pursuit. Since Zorua will be locked into one move anyway, fooling the opponent is not as important, but the element of surprise is still valuable on the switch in. However, to make it more effective of a revenge killer, its disguise should make the opponent oblivious to its role as a revenge killer. In this case, a slow and bulky teammate such as Yamask can work to trick the opponent into staying in or switching to a potential counter, thinking they can set up. Hidden Power Fire can also be used if you want to hit Ferroseed and Bronzor for super effective damage, but Zorua's role for this set is more inclined towards revenge killing weakened sweepers. Extrasensory can also fit in the last slot to deal more damage to Fighting-types with Illusion still intact, but being locked into a Psychic-type move makes room for Dark-types such as Vullaby to switch in.</p> <p>Like the mixed set, this set appreciates a lack of entry hazards on your side of the field to preserve the element of surprise upon switching in. Choice Scarf Zorua also switches in and out more often, so to keep Zorua alive, it is best to have a teammate that can prevent entry hazards, such as Magic Bounce Natu. Rapid Spin users such as Staryu can also help remove entry hazards for Zorua. Again, Wynaut works well here to kill faster Choice Scarf users, but it must be cautious around opponents with strong STAB Dark moves such as Houndour and Sandile.</p> "

Sucker Punch is another option to consider in place of Extrasensory to hit specially defensive attackers on their weaker defense stat if you do not fear Croagunk. In this case, a Naive nature should be used to keep Sucker Punch from losing power.</p> <p>There are many choices for Zorua's disguise, but for the best results on this set, it should appear as a teammate that discourages the opponent from hitting Zorua with priority or a super effective attack, such as a slow Ghost-type such as Yamask or Flying-type such as Swablu. This type of Zorua generally has a harder time setting up as even one extra turn given to the opponent can be a turn when Zorua's disguise is at risk. Like the previous sets, partners such as Natu can function to prevent entry hazards and Wynaut defeats Scarf users that threaten Zorua. Physical attackers such as Timburr and Mienfoo are also appreciated to deal with special tanks such as Munchlax and Mantyke. Dual screen support is also an option to give Zorua more room to set up.

  "Minccino": {
    "overview": "<p>For a long time, Minccino wasn't a very useful Pokemon in Little Cup, and there are a few reasons as to why. For instance, the only notable thing about Minccino is its base 75 Speed. It also goes down quickly to basically anything, including priority moves. However, the most painful thing of all is its Normal typing. In a metagame filled to the brim with offensive Fighting-types who almost always have a super effective priority attack, Minccino's appearance is hardly a threat. In fact, you don't even need to use a Fighting-type to beat Minccino; anything with a decent Attack stat can easily destroy it, while Minccino fails to even come close to scraping anything.</p> <p>With so many disadvantages, you would wonder why anyone would even consider using Minccino in the first place. However, there is one thing that really gives Minccino a step-up from its former position: Skill Link; this gracious ability gives Minccino a very deadly move in Tail Slap, as the guarantee to always hit five times is threatening. Skill Link allows Minccino to break Substitutes, Focus Sashes, and even 2HKO anything that switches in and can't outspeed it, bar resistances and immunities. Minccino has asserted its authority as one of the most dangerous offensive Normal-types ever in Little Cup, and if you let it take advantage of your Pokemon, you're in for a rough ride.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Minccino's movepool is very large, so it does have a few alternatives. Gunk Shot can be used; however, it provides little coverage. Encore and Thunder Wave are both options, but because Minccino is so frail you're better off letting another Pokemon do this job. Wide Lens can be used to help increase Tail Slap's accuracy, while King's Rock gives it a 41% chance to cause a flinch, which makes 2HKOing the opponent easier. However, Life Orb, Eviolite, and Choice Scarf all have much more utility than Wide Lens and King's Rock is a bit too inconsistent. Protect is also an option to block Fake Out if you're willing to give up a moveslot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Minccino dies swiftly to priority moves. The most notable one is Sucker Punch, which is always a guaranteed hit against Minccino because all of its moves activate it. Ghost-types such as Misdreavus, Drifloon, and even the occasional Gastly can all switch into a Tail Slap and either set up on or KO Minccino. Bronzor and Ferroseed resist all of Minccino's moves bar U-turn and can set up entry hazards without fear. Ferroseed is probably the best Steel-type counter, as its Iron Barbs ability carves away a large chunk of Minccino's HP every time Tail Slap hits. Lileep can come in on Aqua Tail and get a Storm Drain boost, but it must watch out for U-turn. Tirtouga and Omanyte, although rare, can also take an Aqua Tail but must watch for Seed Bomb variants. Abra, if brought out correctly, can use Hidden Power Fighting and OHKO non-Choice Scarf Minccino, although it's a 2HKO if Eviolite is used. Slowpoke can take a Tail Slap and easily spread status. Anything with above 18 Speed also defeats non-Choice Scarf Minccino with relative ease.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Tail Slap and Skill Link come together to form a very effective combination. Add Life Orb to the mix, and the opposing Pokemon should be terrified. Despite having 85% accuracy, Tail Slap is going to cause major damage if it hits your opponent. It should be stressed that Tail Slap should almost always be the attack Minccino uses, unless you know a more accurate attack will KO, or the opponent resists Tail Slap. Even a super effective Aqua Tail or Seed Bomb is less powerful than a neutral Tail Slap, so don't get greedy for that super effective message. The choice between an Adamant and a Jolly nature isn't a tough one; nothing really dangerous sits at the base 17 Speed tier, and Adamant is good because it gives Minccino as much power as possible. However, if you really want to outspeed almost anything, a Jolly nature can be used. If Minccino's longevity is unappealing, Eviolite can be used as it gives Minccino 14 / 15 defenses, which means it can take hits a bit better than it can with Life Orb. If you do this, however, the power drop is definitely noticeable. Aqua Tail hits the Rock-types who resist Tail Slap for super effective damage, and it hits Ground-types hard too. U-turn is useful to get out of tough situations and to bring out another sweeper. Knock Off is used to stop defensive Pokemon that rely on Eviolite, such as Misdreavus, by getting rid of their Eviolite, making them easier to beat. However, if bulky Water-types such as Tirtouga and Omanyte get you down, Seed Bomb can be used to deal good damage to them.</p> <p>The EV spread is simple; give Minccino enough Speed to outpace the lower half of the tier, and then give it enough power to really hurt something. Entry hazards make Minccino's job easier and can help put its foes in its KO range, so Pokemon such as Dwebble pair with it nicely. A switch-in for Fighting-types is also helpful, as they can easily OHKO Minccino with any super effective move; Misdreavus fills this role nicely, and so does Shelmet, who can provide the aforementioned entry hazards. Minccino also has the ability to KO potential threats to setup sweepers or bring them in with U-turn, so Pokemon such as Misdreavus love to have Minccino on their team.</p> "

With this major Speed boost, Adamant is the recommended nature as Minccino doesn't need any more Speed than it already has. Despite this, it's not very different from the Life Orb set. Tail Slap and Skill Link are kept because it dishes out major damage, and it means that Minccino will have an easier time 2HKOing set-up sweepers with its improved Speed. Aqua Tail and U-turn are still there to hit Rock- and Ground-types and scout, respectively. Seed Bomb is used to hit bulky Water-types.</p> <p>The same EV spread from the Life Orb set is used; it lets Minccino outspeed any non-Scarfed Pokemon, and even some that are. This gives setup sweepers a much harder time, as they'll wish that they had attacked instead of powering up as they're torn apart by a Tail Slap. Sadly, Minccino doesn't have a large plethora of options for this set. Wake-Up Slap can be used to hit Steel-types, but it's so weak that you're better off having a more effective Pokemon deal with them. Magnemite does this job very well, as it can trap Steel-types with Magnet Pull and KO them with Hidden Power Fire.

Its ability, Magic Guard, prevents residual damage, whether is it from weather, entry hazards, or Life Orb. It has a really low base 20 Speed, which can be used to its advantage with Trick Room. However, the little blob does have some cons: it has abysmal defenses with Life Orb, making it very hard for it to set up Trick Room. It also boasts a terrible defensive typing, being weak to some of the most common attacking types in Ghost, Dark and Bug, and is weak to the most common priority move in the tier: Sucker Punch. Overall, Solosis is a good Pokemon that can prove useful if you provide it the right team support.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Solosis' movepool is quite shallow, but it has a few other options to use. Psyshock is a viable move on the Trick Room set, allowing it to beat specially defensive Pokemon such as Munchlax that don't take much from any of its moves. It's a weaker alternative than Psychic, though. A gimmicky Calm Mind set with Calm Mind/Acid Armor/Recover/Psychic and maximum investment in HP and Defense can be used as a late-game sweeper, but it's easily beaten by Misdreavus before it gets a chance to set up Calm Mind. The set can also use Flash Cannon or Hidden Power Dragon if you're afraid of Dark-types, but you lose a lot of power. An Endeavor set can possibly work, thanks to Magic Guard, but the sheer number of priority moves and recovery in LC makes it unviable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>It should be noted before considering any check or counter that Solosis can't be worn down by residual damage, thanks to its ability. Vullaby and Pawniard are the main counters to Solosis, as they wield a powerful priority Sucker Punch to hit Solosis for an OHKO before it even moves. However, they're both OHKOed by Thunder and Hidden Power Fighting, respectively. Ironically enough, Mienfoo can threaten Solosis outside of Trick Room with U-turn and stall Trick Room turns with Fake Out. Priority users are the bane of Solosis, as they bypass Trick Room and hit it through its frail defenses. Basically, anything that can tank a Life Orb-boosted Psychic can KO Solosis at the end of the turn, such as Porygon, Eviolite Offensive Chinchou, and Larvesta. Lileep under sandstorm can easily wall Solosis and slowly whittle it down with Giga Drain. Munchlax gets a special mention for being one of the few things that can outslow Solosis in Trick Room, tank any of its hits easily thanks to its high HP and Special Defense stats, and easily OHKO it with Return. It can be heavily damaged if it gets hit on the switch by Psyshock, though.</p> ",

Psychic is a reliable STAB, allowing Solosis to hit most Pokemon in the tier for a 2HKO, if not outright OHKOing them. Hidden Power Fighting hits most Steel-types for good damage, 2HKOing most of them. Thunder is the best option for the fourth moveslot, as despite its terrible accuracy, it allows Solosis to hit a few key threats, namely Frillish and Vullaby, OHKOing them after Stealth Rock damage. Shadow Ball is a good alternative, hitting Misdreavus harder than any other move, but it's not OHKOing it anytime soon.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Solosis to maximize its bulk and Special Attack; a Quiet nature is used to lower its Speed and increase its Special Attack, allowing it to move before most Pokemon under Trick Room. Solosis needs priority users to be KOed before attempting to sweep; Magnemite is a good partner, eliminating Snover, Shellder, and Tirtouga in a pinch. Magnemite can also trap Steel-types that aren't weak to Hidden Power Fighting, such as Bronzor; it's also really useful because it lures in Pokemon such as Timburr and Croagunk for Solosis to set up against. Porygon is a viable partner too, luring in and removing Fighting-types. Hazard setters, such as Drilbur and Dwebble, are excellent partners for Solosis, as Stealth Rock helps Solosis get a few important OHKOs, including KOs against Frillish and Vullaby.</p> "

However, it does have some key traits that distinguish it from its other Flying- or Water-types. One of these is its good typing, which gives it some helpful resistances to Fighting, Ground, and Bug. Its typing also grants it an uncommon neutrality to Ice and Grass, making it a decent check to the ever present Snover. It also has a fair support movepool and usable stats, letting it support its team as either a bulky physical tank or an anti-weather support Pokemon. Additionally, it boasts access to the coveted Roost, a recovery move other walls only wish they had. Still, it has a crippling 4x weakness to Electric and 2x weakness to Stealth Rock, making it tough for Ducklett to switch in and support its team with Feather Dance or Rain Dance when needed. It's also fairly slow, weak, and not outstandingly bulky, so it cannot stand up to some of the tier's stronger attackers. Its niche is very specific--unless your team desperately needs a weather counter or a good Fighting-type check, Ducklett may be outclassed. However, it does fill a few specific niches, and it fills them well.</p> ",

Chinchou is probably the best answer to Ducklett, as it resists both of Ducklett's STABs and can OHKO with Volt Switch. Magnemite is another great Electric-type check, as it can also OHKO with Volt Switch and has the bulk to take a Scald even in the rain. Rock-types can come in on anything but Surf and OHKO with their STAB moves as well. Bulky Eviolite Lileep is a great example, as it is immune to Scald and only takes around 27% from Hurricane, Ducklett's strongest attack. Pokemon with Taunt or Encore annoy Ducklett, as it relies on support moves and rain in order to function effectively.

Feather Dance is what makes this set successful, stopping all physical attackers that can't hit it super effectively by halving the damage of their attacks. It can then stall its opponent with Toxic, all the while effortlessly sponging its opponents' weakened attacks. Should Ducklett's health fall too low, it can recover with Roost. Roost also lets Ducklett shrug off Stealth Rock and residual damage and in general makes it last much longer. The last slot is reserved for an attacking move. Surf hits Drilbur and Hippopotas hard, nailing the former for an OHKO and the latter for a 2HKO. Air Slash, on the other hand, is used for Snover, OHKOing after a bit of residual damage.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Ducklett's bulk, giving it nice mixed defenses. Max HP and Special Defense are used so that Ducklett can take hits that it cannot weaken with Feather Dance. 4 Special Attack EVs are all it needs to raise its Special Attack by a point, letting Ducklett OHKO Drilbur and 2HKO Hippopotas with Surf. The little boost in power also lets Ducklett OHKO Snover after some residual damage, such as Stealth Rock or Spikes. The rest is all stashed into defenses to give Ducklett good defensive bulk so that it can tank the physical moves it will be handling. In terms of ability, this set should use Big Pecks, which allows Ducklett to escape Defense drops from Houndour's Crunch. Hydration is quite useless, as rain is very rare in Little Cup. Extra Special Attack can be invested to give Ducklett some extra power, but the only notable difference is that Snover is OHKOed more reliably, and the cost is a lot of extra bulk.</p> <p>Because Ducklett needs to be able to switch in repeatedly, it appreciates Rapid Spin support to keep Stealth Rock off the field, as it makes it susceptible to some common 2HKOs. Drilbur gets a mention here as it is also immune to Electric-type moves and can take Rock-type attacks fairly well. Chinchou is another great partner as it is immune to Electric and enjoys the weakening of opposing physical sweepers. It also has access to Heal Bell, which Ducklett really appreciates to help it erase any status it is inflicted with. Ferroseed is another awesome partner that has perfect synergy with Ducklett.

It is not a \"sitting duck\"--although its Special Attack stat is not high, it is enough to nab some crucial KOs with a rain-boosted Surf against Pokemon such as Snover, Mienfoo, Drilbur, and Hippopotas. Surf and Hurricane have decent coverage together, and the confusion chance can definitely aid Ducklett and its team members. Hurricane nets the OHKO on Snover as well as Mienfoo after some prior damage and hits Grass- and Water-types that resist Surf. Air Slash can also be used instead of Hurricane for more accuracy outside of Rain, but there is a notable difference in power, and it does miss out on the OHKO against Mienfoo and Snover. Rest should be used on the last slot for instant, reliable recovery with no drawbacks under rain, as Hydration heals off the sleep by the end of the turn. Roost is another option for the last slot for reliable recovery outside of rain should Ducklett not want to rely on rain too much.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Ducklett's HP and Defense, and 116 Special Defense EVs along with a Calm nature give Ducklett good special bulk and balanced defenses. The Eviolite gives Ducklett even more bulk, and Hydration lets Ducklett become immune to status in the rain. The 4 Special Attack EVs allow Ducklett to OHKO Drilbur and 2HKO Hippopotas with Surf, while powering up Hurricane. Ducklett can use Scald instead of Surf on the second slot for the burn chance, but it loses the ability to reliably take out Hippopotas and Drilbur outside of rain. A Damp Rock can also be used to make the rain last longer, but this sacrifices a lot of bulk.</p> <p>In terms of partners, Ducklett likes to be paired with spinners and/or hazard setters, as it forces switches but suffers because of Stealth Rock. Drilbur is a nice partner, as it resists Rock and is immune to Electric and can KO Magnemite and Chinchou, two Pokemon that can OHKO and wall Ducklett. Grass-types are also effective partners. Ferroseed is a great partner because it has perfect synergy with Ducklett and can set up entry hazards. It also appreciates the rain, as it helps weaken Fire-type moves. Pokemon that can take advantage of the rain can also be great partners. For example, Anorith can grab a Speed boost in the rain, as well as spin away Stealth Rock. Chinchou is another great partner as it is immune to Electric-type moves and can wall Magnemite and Chinchou. It also receives a nice power boost from rain.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Karrablast is an atypical physical sweeper in every regard. It has a good Attack stat backed up by the incredibly deadly Megahorn and a powerful boosting move in Swords Dance, but it is let down by its shallow movepool and unimpressive Speed stat. Although its moves offer poor coverage against Steel-types, the most notable ones, Ferroseed, Bronzor, and Pawniard, are all hit neutrally by Megahorn, so Rock-types are the real threats to Karrablast. Its ability, Shed Skin, though passively helpful, is usually better than the situational Swarm. Overall, Karrablast can be a helpful addition to your team if you are aware of and cover its weaknesses while building on its strengths.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Counter can be used for a surprise KO, but is unreliable. X-Scissor is a more accurate option over Megahorn, but hits for less damage on average. Pursuit can be used for hitting Ghost-types, as well as Psychic-types afraid of staying in and eating a Megahorn. Finally, a utility set with Eviolite, Shed Skin, and Knock Off might seem decent, but Karrablast has pretty mediocre defenses, making it a bad choice.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Defensively, many Steel- and Rock-types can easily take Karrablast's moves.

Return hits many Pokemon who resist Megahorn hard, though Double-Edge can be used for more power. The choice between Life Orb and Oran Berry really depends on what you're using Karrablast for: a suicidal death machine or a powerful Pokemon that can take a hit. Keep in mind that with a maximum Speed of 16, Karrablast cannot outrun some of the quicker LC Pokemon. Feint Attack is a useful move in that it allows Karrablast to hit Gastly, which 4x resists Megahorn, whereas Aerial Ace can hit Fighting-type Pokemon harder than Double-Edge, without the drop in health due to recoil.</p> <p>Life Orb can be used for maximum power after a Swords Dance, but an Oran Berry will allow Karrablast to set up Swords Dance more easily. An Adamant nature can be used over Jolly if you want pure power instead of the extra Speed. Double-Edge and Return are interchangeable; again, this depends on what you're using Karrablast for.</p> <p>Unorthodox Steel-types such as Aron and Magnemite can exploit Karrablast's lack of coverage, and anything fairly quick can make short work of Karrablast with its mediocre Speed.</p> "

A Jolly nature is recommended for the Choice Band set, while an Adamant nature works best with the Choice Scarf set.</p> "

  "Joltik": {
    "overview": "<p>As the smallest Pokemon in existence, Joltik is often overlooked in favor of bigger, tougher-looking choices such as Magnemite, Chinchou, and Larvesta. As a matter of fact, Joltik is sometimes outclassed by them as an offensive threat, as it doesn't have the same offensive presence or durability. Although, Joltik does have three key redeeming qualities: its typing, movepool, and awesome cuteness. Bug / Electric typing is a blessing in the current metagame. Like Magnemite, Joltik can threaten Water- and Flying-type opponents. However, unlike Magnemite, it sports a valuable resistance to Fighting-type moves. Joltik can also single-handedly defeat almost all Grass-type threats in the tier, such as Foongus and Shroomish—Pokemon that Chinchou struggles with. Larvesta, meanwhile, can only dream of having the Speed and movepool Joltik does.</p> <p>However, Joltik still struggles to find a place in many teams, as it's not powerful enough to sweep teams on its own and its near-useless abilities give it a difficult time shining. While it doesn't have a crippling quadruple weakness to Stealth Rock like Larvesta, it still should have a Rapid Spin user as a teammate, as its frailness and reliance on offensive items won't let it last long enough. Joltik's ability to hit almost all of the tier neutrally gives it an incredibly useful niche on hyper offensive teams. All in all, with Joltik's attractive qualities, it shouldn't be treated as just a cute bug.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Joltik has a wide movepool, allowing it to run many different sets. A set with Substitute and three attacks coupled with Swarm and a pinch Berry can theoretically be devastating, but it is hard to pull off, as Joltik's Speed is not enough against common threats such as Misdreavus and Murkrow that won't switch out from it. A set running Substitute and Disable is very useful, as most Pokemon carry only one super effective move to hit Joltik with. However, Gastly outclasses it in this role, sporting superior Speed and two useful immunities to make better use of a set like this one. As surprising as it can be, Joltik, unlike most Electric-types, has a wide physical movepool, including X-Scissor, Wild Charge, Sucker Punch, and other coverage options, but Joltik should make use of its superior Special Attack, as it won't hit hard enough even with a fairly powerful priority attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is the most prominent obstacle for any Bug-type, and Joltik is no exception as it will take heavy damage each time it switches in with them on the field. If Stealth Rock is not present, the best counter for Joltik is Magnemite due to its resistances to all of its common attacks and can hit Joltik back with Hidden Power Fire for super effective damage. Speaking of the Fire-type, any Fire-type can deal with Joltik, but most of them are frail and can't comfortably take a Modest Life Orb-boosted Thunderbolt. However, Numel won't mind any of Joltik's attacks and can use it as setup bait. Rock-types under Sandstorm can survive Giga Drain and send Joltik packing. Lileep is hit hard by Bug Buzz, but it does survive and can retaliate with Toxic or an attacking move. A Fighting-type that run a Rock-type coverage move can decimate Joltik and score a surprise KO on it while Joltik is trying to check it.</p> <p>Oddly enough, Joltik can't defeat Murkrow, as it will either be heavily damaged by Brave Bird or outright KOed by Heat Wave, meaning it loses no matter what the scenario. Choice Scarf Murkrow stands out, being able to outspeed the standard Choice Scarf set and carrying Heat Wave. In fact, every Choice Scarf user that hits at least 17 Speed, such as Gastly, can outspeed and defeat the Choice Scarf set, as it is very frail. However, this set is the most difficult to counter because it can survive most priority attacks and will usually switch out after scoring a KO. If those counters are down, Misdreavus is bulky enough to survive any hit and can wear Joltik down until it's defeated. Along those lines, common special walls, such as Porygon, Lickitung, and Munchlax, don't mind any of Joltik's attacks and can stall out Life Orb damage or set up on it. Phazers and Clear Smog users can remove its Agility boosts, as most of them are bulky enough to survive its attacks. If you are not running any of those, paralysis is generally the best way to handle it, with Prankster Murkrow and Cottonee being able to bypass its heightened Speed and proceed to paralyze it, though they are unable to switch into Joltik easily. If all else fails, Joltik's frailty and lack of recovery mean it will inevitably fall at some point in the battle.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Joltik can use its great typing, access to Volt Switch, and decent Speed to fulfill a classic scout role. STAB Volt Switch is the main attacking option, as it will hit hard while keeping momentum on your side. Thunderbolt is a more powerful option, hitting many threats harder while having a chance of paralysis. Although, in most cases, Bug Buzz is a more reliable STAB move as nothing is immune to it and hits Grass-types trying to tank Joltik's Electric attacks for super effective damage. Giga Drain is the main selling point of Joltik, as it lets it hit Pokemon immune to Electric-type moves, such as Ground-types and Chinchou, for super effective damage. It even gives Joltik some nice recovery, which it appreciates because of its frailness.</p> <p>With the listed EV spread, Joltik can also work as an effective revenge killer, as it hits 16 Speed, which, when coupled with a Choice Scarf, lets it outspeed the whole unboosted metagame and common Pokemon at +1 such as Scraggy, Snover, Dratini, and Axew. It also maximizes damage output when running a Modest nature. The small investment in Defense lets Joltik better handle most common priority attacks, such as Murkrow's Sucker Punch and Tirtouga's Aqua Jet. The only specially-based priority move, Vacuum Wave, deals little damage thanks to Joltik's Bug typing. Joltik can run a Timid nature to avoid Speed ties against common Choice Scarf users, such as Adamant Mienfoo, Modest Chinchou, Cranidos, and Larvesta; however, the loss of power is very noticeable and Joltik has trouble against all of them either way.</p> <p>Swarm is the ability of choice, as without HP investment switching into Stealth Rock four times will give Bug Buzz a much-needed boost. Although it could be seen as contradictory when running Giga Drain, the other abilities are less useful. Unnerve could be used, but Oran Berry is rare and Joltik shouldn't be staying in against Dwebble, the most common user of it. Compoundeyes is even more situational, as all of the listed moves have perfect accuracy, so it would only be helpful against Sand Veil and Snow Cloak users, but neither ability is used enough to warrant Compoundeyes.</p> <p>Rapid Spin users are the best teammates for Joltik, as entry hazards heavily limit its switch-ins. Drilbur is the best choice, boasting the ability to set up Stealth Rock on the opponent's side as well, allowing Joltik to take better advantage of the numerous switches it forces. As this set is intended to support the team and not the other way around, it can fit into most teams. Unlike most other Electric-types, however, Joltik cannot defeat Murkrow without team support, so Roost Archen and Tirtouga make excellent partners. Archen can also form a VoltTurn core with Joltik; just note that the stacked Rock-type weaknesses make a Rapid Spin user mandatory. Mienfoo can also form a VoltTurn core with Joltik due to its great defensive synergy, resisting Rock-type attacks. Defensive Pokemon such as Porygon, Munchlax, and Lickitung can tank most hits and recover their health. Magnemite, the only Pokemon in the tier that resists every attack on this set, can also switch into Joltik without fear. Additionally, Fighting-type attackers, such as Timburr and Mienfoo, can defeat all of the Pokemon mentioned above. Bulky Misdreavus only resists Bug Buzz, but it won't be bothered by Joltik's other attacks, so a Pokemon that can handle Ghost-types, such as Stunky, Houndour, or Vullaby is appreciated. Payback Timburr and bulky Croagunk can also defeat Misdreavus while retaining the ability to hit defensive walls, so they make great Joltik partners.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Joltik's speed and access to Agility make it a formidable late-game cleaner. Hyper offensive teams will appreciate this ability to clean up weakened teams. This set aims to boost up with Agility when the opponent switches to a Ground-type or Chinchou in an attempt to absorb a Volt Switch. With a boost under its belt, Joltik can attack with Bug Buzz, Thunderbolt, or Giga Drain. Bug Buzz will be the most-used STAB, as nothing is immune to it and it has a handy Special Defense drop chance, which can turn the tides of a tight match. Thunderbolt is the strongest STAB in Joltik's movepool and hits Fighting- and Flying-type opponents, which resist Bug Buzz, hard. Giga Drain allows Joltik to defeat all Ground-types except for Numel and gives it a little recovery so it can last longer.</p> <p>The EV spread and nature aim to maximize damage output. Defense EVs are useful to defend Joltik from priority. It's possible to move those EVs to HP, but they won't make any difference in survivability because of such recoil. A Life Orb is needed for this set, as it adds power to all of Joltik's attacks. Eviolite, however, is another option to help Joltik boost up in front of threats it can't scare out, but the damage output won't be enough to secure many OHKOs, such as the ones on non-Eviolite Mienfoo, Pawniard, Houndour, and Dwebble. A Timid nature should also be dismissed even though it allows Joltik to outspeed Adamant Drilbur in the sand and Naughty Drifloon after a boost. Drifloon will easily defeat non-boosted Joltik if Unburden has been activated; if it isn't, it has to be wary of Joltik's Thunderbolt. Drilbur, on the other hand, has to take a major risk switching in due to Joltik's Life Orb-boosted Giga Drain, which can potentially OHKO it, making Timid an inferior option. Unnerve is the ability of choice, as Compoundeyes is nearly useless, and Joltik's frailty in addition to Life Orb recoil means that Swarm will give a one-time boost to Bug Buzz and then Joltik will die, making it an inferior option. Unnerve, however, will prevent the odd Oran Berry user, such as Dwebble or Recycle Bronzor, from stalling out Joltik.</p> <p>Rapid Spin users are good partners. Drilbur, Staryu, and Tentacool are excellent choices, having good defensive synergy with Joltik. Entry hazard setters are also a great option because they allow Joltik to secure OHKOs on threats such as Eviolite Drilbur, bulky Houndour, Murkrow, Vullaby, and Slowpoke. Dwebble and Ferroseed are also solid partners, as they can lay both Stealth Rock and Spikes. Dwebble can act as a suicide lead on hyper offensive teams, while Ferroseed can defeat opposing Rapid Spin users. Bulky Ghost-type partners, such as Misdreavus, can also help in keeping entry hazards up. Golett can set up Stealth Rock and defeat common Joltik counters, most notably Magnemite and Numel; Joltik, in turn, can easily beat the Water- and Grass-types that can stop Golett. It can also defeat Natu so that Golett won't have to worry about its Stealth Rock being bounced back. Creating setup opportunities is needed for Joltik to succeed, as it is very frail. Memento Diglett can provide such opportunities and wear down special walls and Rock-types under sand with its own Life Orb-boosted attacks. Joltik's coverage and Speed make it a good Nasty Plot recipient through Baton Pass. Mime Jr. can use Encore on a weak attack, use Nasty Plot, and then Baton Pass the boost allowing Joltik to more easily sweep through the opposing team.</p> <p>Hard-hitting offensive partners can overwhelm the opposing team so Joltik can clean up afterwards. Bulky Chinchou can form a devastating offensive core with it, as it attracts Joltik's counters and can weaken them enough for Joltik to defeat them. Houndour is also a nice option, being able to take out Bronzor and Magnemite; it can also take advantage of the Fire-type attacks Joltik lures with Flash Fire. Ponyta can defeat Magnemite and cripple physical priority users with Flame Body. Roost Archen is also a very good offensive partner, as it has a high Attack stat and can thus obliterate walls. Heavy hitters such as Nasty Plot Misdreavus, Dragon Dance Scraggy, and Life Orb Murkrow can also weaken teams enough so Joltik can switch in, boost up, and sweep through the opposing team. Joltik can also switch roles with many of these Pokemon by weakening walls so the other can finish them off.</p> <p>Electro Ball is a decent option over Thunderbolt, as it can reach 150 Base Power against slow threats such as Slowpoke and Munchlax. However, it isn't useful against Joltik's common counters, as they are not OHKOed. Energy Ball is a similar case because it always OHKOes Life Orb Drilbur, something Giga Drain fails to do sometimes.</p> "

        "name": "Eviolite",
        "description": "<p>Joltik's typing leaves it with only two weaknesses—Fire and Rock—that are both fairly uncommon. This coupled with its good resistances to Fighting and Grass makes Joltik a viable user of a bulky set. With its decent offensive coverage, Joltik plays an important role on balanced teams. Thunderbolt and Bug Buzz are reliable STABs that have useful secondary effects. Discharge is a good option over Thunderbolt, as this set is meant to slowly wear down the opposing team, and Discharge can spread paralysis on fast threats, such as Misdreavus and Murkrow. Giga Drain rounds off Joltik's coverage and provides much-needed recovery. In the last slot, Thunder Wave can be used to guarantee paralysis on opponents that aren't Ground-type. Volt Switch, however, provides a scouting move and works well if Discharge is used.</p> <p>The EV spread gives Joltik a high and odd-numbered HP to minimize damage from Stealth Rock. The defensive spread with a Bold Nature is useful for switch into Fighting-type attacks. It also gives Joltik a chance to survive two Brave Birds from Murkrow and retaliate with an Electric-type attack. Special Defense investment provides Joltik the ability to switching into Grass-type attacks, while the Special Attack EVs boost its offensive presence. Modest is an option to deal more damage, as is Calm to balance its defenses, but those natures won't make any notable difference in damage dealt or given, while the listed Bold nature will significantly help in taking physical attacks. Either of the two listed abilities can be used, as both are equally situational. Oran Berry users are uncommon, so Unnerve won't be helping too much, and getting into Swarm range would only slightly boost Bug Buzz, which won't be enough because this set lacks power. This set has many other possible move choices, such as Disable and Sucker Punch, but paralysis and scouting are usually superior to situational extra threat coverage.</p> <p>Having a Rapid Spin user is mandatory. Drilbur can set up Stealth Rock, while Staryu's Speed and offenses enable it to revenge kill threats weakened by Joltik. Tentacool has high Special Defense, allowing it to tank special attacks aimed at Joltik; can spread Toxic to wear down special walls, such as Lileep and Porygon; and use Knock Off to get rid of Eviolite. Water- and Ground-type Pokemon in general can help Joltik defeat Numel and Magnemite, two common Joltik counters. Chinchou and Golett can defeat said counters one-on-one, so they are the top choices for teammates. Knock Off users can help Joltik into wearing the opponent down and benefit from the paralysis spread by Joltik, as they are slow and durable. Mienfoo can threaten special walls with its Fighting-type STAB, while Vullaby can carry Taunt to stop recovery moves which greatly adds entry hazard damage set by other teammates. As this set causes a lot of switches, entry hazard setters are good partners: Dwebble can defeat Fire-type Pokemon and set up Stealth Rock and Spikes at the same time. Defensive Steel-types are difficult to handle for Joltik, so bulky Magnemite makes for a very good partner. As Joltik can switch into Fighting-types and deal heavy damage to them, Pokemon that benefit from seeing them gone or weakened are good partners. Swords Dance Pawniard, Curse Lickitung, Rock Polish Cranidos, and Nasty Plot Zorua are some decent examples of such Pokemon.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Straight out of Area 51 or some thriller alien movie, you'd better pray that this little green man comes in peace; with base 85 Special Attack and Analytic boosting its attacks, Elgyem isn't something you want to get on the bad side of. Normally such a low Speed stat on an offensive Pokemon would be awful, but Elgyem somehow manages to make it work through the use of Analytic, above average 55 / 55 / 55 defenses, and Recover. Its Psychic typing even manages to make itself useful, giving Elgyem a nice resistance to Fighting-type attacks that allows it to switch in on most Fighting-types without much worry. Analytic really is what makes Elgyem so impressive though; its Speed is so low that it will almost always be slower than its opponent, so Elgyem consistently has the equivalent of a free Life Orb boost without the added recoil. Because of the sheer power that Analytic provides, Elgyem is easily the best bulky attacking Psychic-type in LC and one of the best bulky attackers in the tier.</p> <p>Although Elgyem might have superior technology, impressive firepower, and adorable looks (it even has a little tail!), it's not without flaws. Once Elgyem has taken down a Pokemon, it's usually in range to be revenge killed. This issue is further compounded by Elgyem's weakness to two of the best offensive Pokemon in LC: Pawniard and Misdreavus. Even though Elgyem can actually survive their attacks at full health, it will almost always have taken a hit or two before KOing a Pokemon and thus will very rarely be at full health against these three. Elgyem also takes quite a bit of skill to use effectively. The opponent will often switch out against Elgyem, and it can take good prediction to nail whatever is coming in... unless you can get Elgyem's mind probing devices working, that is.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Most Psychic-types have a myriad of disruptive and supporting moves, and Elgyem is no exception. These options include (but are not limited to): Calm Mind, Nasty Plot, Reflect, Light Screen, Thunder Wave, Trick Room, and a Choice Specs set. They all seem alright on paper, but most of the time other Pokemon pull off that particular option better or the set just isn't as viable as it seems. For instance, Elgyem doesn't have the Speed to effectively pull off a stat boosting set, with the possible exception of Calm Mind. If you're running a dual screens set, you should use the much faster Abra, or even Natu. Both Thunder Wave and Trick Room nullify Analytic (which is Elgyem's best attribute), and Elgyem is just not bulky enough for Choice Specs considering it has to take a hit or two before attacking. Elgyem has a solid niche, but it's not any of these.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Common Dark- and Ghost-types in the tier, notably Pawniard, Vullaby, and Misdreavus, notably threaten Elgyem. Each of these Pokemon has slight difficulty getting in due to Elgyem's ridiculous firepower, but, if they come in safely, they will either force Elgyem out or KO it if it's even slightly weakened. Other Dark-types, such as Stunky, Houndour, Vullaby, and even Pawniard can do the same. Stunky, Houndour, and Pawniard in particular possess Pursuit (and commonly run it), and Stunky is also not weak to any of Elgyem's attacks. Can't you just imagine a malicious Stunky or Houndour chasing down and knocking out a helpless Elgyem with Pursuit? That scenario just seems awful and scary, and I would probably cry if I saw that happen.</p> <p>Elgyem's problems don't stop there however. Other Pokemon with super effective attacks and decent bulk can also be threatening to face. Larvesta has a powerful U-turn that will take a massive chunk out of Elgyem, and even if Elgyem switches out, the opponent will still have the upper hand. Even a Pokemon such as Dwebble could be potentially disastrous to face should it somehow come in safely. Bulky Pokemon that Elgyem can't 2HKO will also be a nuisance. Lileep is the most prolific example, as, even outside of sand, it can avoid a 2HKO in almost all circumstances and stall out Elgyem with Toxic and Recover. Similarly, Munchlax can tank attacks from Elgyem and hit back with Pursuit or a STAB move.</p> <p>Elgyem's biggest problem is that its presence on the battlefield is limited due to its low Speed. While it isn't OHKOed by much, after it beats a Pokemon it'll probably be in range to be revenge killed by another powerful attacker. The trick to playing around Elgyem is to exploit this fact and accept that you might lose a Pokemon to it. Once it KOes something, any powerful Pokemon—such as Drilbur, Snover, Magnemite, or any of the offensive Pokemon listed above—will usually be able to revenge kill it, or at least force it out and make sure it can't easily come back in.</p> ",

Elgyem is bulky enough to come in on weaker Pokemon, such as Bronzor, Foongus, and Natu, as well as Fighting-types such as Timburr, and safely spam its high powered, Analytic-boosted attacks. Speaking of Analytic, it is Elgyem's most defining attribute and what sets it apart from other Psychic-types, especially in tandem with its base 85 Special Attack. There aren't many Pokemon in LC that can avoid a 2HKO from Elgyem, provided Elgyem uses the right combination of attacks. This of course means that when you're using Elgyem, prediction is key. However, if you can land the correct attacks, Elgyem becomes a beast. Psychic is an odd move to spam in a tier where Pawniard, Bronzor, and Ferroseed are ubiquitous, but it is Elgyem's most powerful attack against most Pokemon. Thunderbolt or Hidden Power will hit the aforementioned Pokemon hard though, so they usually aren't a problem with decent prediction. With Recover, Elgyem can stay in the game for the long haul against teams where it is able to switch in multiple times.</p> <p>For a Pokemon that is meant to utilize Analytic to its full effect, running a Modest nature with Speed EVs might seem strange at first; with the given spread, Elgyem will hit a Speed of 11. This allows Elgyem to outspeed many slower walls, so it can hit them with an Analytic-boosted attack while they switch in and then finish them off before they can move. This Speed investment also gives Elgyem an easier time against specific Fighting-types, mainly Croagunk (and to an extent Timburr). With its Special Attack maxed out, Elgyem hits 19 Special Attack, and with what is essentially a free Life Orb boost to most of its attacks, Elgyem is one of the hardest hitting Pokemon in LC. Even with just 76 HP EVs, Elgyem will have the bulk to not only come in on weaker Pokemon but also take some STAB super effective moves at full health in a pinch.</p> <p>The above combination of moves is usually the best, but Elgyem does have a couple of other options. Shadow Ball is Elgyem's strongest attack against Misdreavus and opposing Psychic-types, and although it won't OHKO Misdreavus, it comes fairly close. Calm Mind can also be used over Thunderbolt or Hidden Power. This lets Elgyem set up on many weaker Pokemon and beat bulkier Pokemon it would otherwise not be able to, such as Lileep. Alternatively, Elgyem can run Charge Beam instead of Thunderbolt, allowing it to attack and set up simultaneously. However, without the Special Defense boosts Calm Mind provides, Elgyem will be even easier to revenge kill, and the initial drop in power is noticeable. If the EV spread irks you, a bulkier spread of 236 HP / 240 SpA with a Quiet nature is an option. This spread allows Elgyem to survive almost any attack if it's close to full health, such as Sucker Punch from Eviolite Pawniard or Shadow Ball from Misdreavus. If this spread is chosen, make sure to set the Speed IV to 2, which minimizes Elgyem's Speed for Analytic while still keeping Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p>This little alien requires a bit of support to bring out its true potential. Like every Pokemon, Elgyem greatly appreciates entry hazard support, as in many instances it's the difference between nabbing or missing an OHKO or 2HKO. Thus, Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Lileep, and Tirtouga are good partners, as they can set up Spikes and Stealth Rock respectively. Elgyem works well with these Pokemon in particular as Ferroseed and Lileep cover the Water-types that Elgyem has a neutral match-up with, at best, while Tirtouga is a very solid Vullaby check. Additionally, Elgyem helps to cover some of the Fighting-types that threaten these Pokemon.</p> <p>Elgyem will often come in on bulky Pokemon that carry status moves, so a cleric is much appreciated. Chinchou is the obvious choice, and also helps against Vullaby to boot. Lickitung is an option as well, and can use Knock Off to make Elgyem hit even harder by removing Eviolites. Pokemon that lure in the bulky Pokemon that Elgyem can come in on are almost mandatory. Chinchou helps out in this regard, drawing in weaker Pokemon such as Foongus and Ferroseed. Ferroseed is again a great partner for this reason, as it is bait for Natu and Fighting-types.</p> <p>Because three of Elgyem's biggest checks—Pawniard, Vullaby, and Misdreavus—are all top threats themselves, it's important to include teammates that can deal with them, especially because some other helpful teammates will surely aggravate these weaknesses. The aforementioned Chinchou, Tirtouga, and Ferroseed all work well (Chinchou and Tirtouga for Vullaby, Ferroseed for Misdreavus), as well as helping out Elgyem in other ways. Some other helpful teammates include Mienfoo, which can check Porygon and use either U-turn to get Elgyem in safely or Knock Off to remove Eviolite from opposing Pokemon, and Archen, which can check Vullaby and either set up Stealth Rock or provide U-turn support.</p> "

  "Axew": {
    "overview": "<p>One glance at its fearsome tusks and red irises will tell you that Axew is one vicious little dragon. There was once a time when Axew was outclassed by other Dragon Dance users such as Dratini, but that time is long in the past, as Black and White 2 bestowed upon it gifts from the move tutors: Aqua Tail and Superpower. This means that coverage issues can no longer restrain this majestic beast. Base 87 Attack is what makes Axew truly formidable, as it is able to reach dizzying power levels when paired with Dragon Dance, which also boosts its less impressive base 57 Speed to respectable levels.</p> <p>Alas, even mighty warriors like Axew have weaknesses. 46 / 60 / 40 defenses are far from impressive, though Eviolite can mitigate this somewhat. Its typing, though a blessing offensively, leaves it vulnerable to Ice-type attacks and the dreaded priority Ice Shard. Furthermore, despite the new toys it received from the move tutors, Axew finds itself walled by some Steel-types, especially if it lacks Superpower. Bulky Fighting-types also lurk in the shadows with the potential to ruin Axew's day with their ability to take hits and retaliate with powerful attacks. Its flaws, however, can be covered by its fantastic sweeping capabilities; with the right support, it can ravage unprepared teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Axew has a few other options up its sleeve that have similar functions to its already existing sets. Night Slash scores a super effective hit on Misdreavus and other bulky Ghost-types that can give Axew trouble, though a STAB Outrage will often do similar damage and Night Slash has poor coverage alongside Axew's Dragon-type STAB. A more bulky Dragon Dance set could be used to accumulate more than one boost, but this is somewhat outclassed by Dratini, which can use Rest for recovery to less detrimental effect due to Shed Skin. Life Orb or Choice Band give Axew more immediate power, but the bulk provided by Eviolite is normally a superior option, as it gives Axew an easier time setting up and allows it to take priority easier once it has done so. Swords Dance seems like a good option at first, but Axew's slightly disappointing Speed and lack of priority means that Axew will hardly ever sweep. A double dance set with could be used to help Axew overcome some normal counters, though it will not usually find the time to set up twice. Rivalry is an interesting option, as many Pokemon that Axew could not break through before could be beaten if that Pokemon is the same gender. However, this could also work conversely, meaning Axew will often just miss out on a kill that it would otherwise achieve, and thus it is usually not worth the risk. Unnerve would have been good in Generation 4, but Generation 5 introduced Eviolite, so Oran Berry, a previous staple on Little Cup teams, has been shunned somewhat.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bronzor is the best counter to Axew, as it resists its Dragon-type STAB and has a neutrality to Superpower, thanks to its secondary Psychic typing. A +1 Aqua Tail only does 32-40%, while Bronzor can use Toxic and then stall with Protect and Rest, putting a timer on Axew's sweep. Other Steel-types such as Magnemite and Pawniard can wall Axew that are locked into Outrage or that lack Superpower and retaliate with powerful STABs, or, in the case of the latter, set up Swords Dance to become a very dangerous threat. Some Fighting-types like bulky Mienfoo and Riolu act as decent checks, as they can both just about take a +1 Outrage. Mienfoo can Fake Out and then Drain Punch, scoring good damage on Axew, then switch out to recover some of the damage done. If Axew last used Outrage, Riolu can use Copycat, which, due to Prankster, allows it to move before Axew and hit it for 72-90%, picking it off if it has taken some prior damage. Timburr can also take a +1 Outrage and heavily damage Axew with a combination of Drain Punch and then priority Mach Punch. Other priority users can really hinder Axew, despite the defense boost provided by Eviolite. In particular, an Ice Shard from Choice Scarf Snover does 36-54%, so it has the potential to KO Axew if it has been weakened. Finally, faster users of Choice Scarf, such as Mienfoo and Abra, can outspeed Axew and crush it with their powerful STAB attacks.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance is a move that Axew utilizes superbly. The goal of this set is simple: switch in after a teammate has been felled or on a resisted attack, then Dragon Dance to turn Axew into a killing machine. After a Dragon Dance, Axew reaches a bone-crushing Attack of 27, and its Speed reaches a relatively nimble 24, meaning it can outspeed the entirety of the unboosted metagame and even some slower Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Snover. Once boosted, there is little that can face up to the wrath of Axew; it is both faster and more powerful, stat-wise, than Dratini.</p> <p>Outrage serves as the obligatory Dragon-type STAB. It boasts a monstrous 120 Base Power, meaning it will demolish enemies that do not resist it even before a boost. Aqua Tail provides fantastic coverage for Axew, hitting threats like Hippopotas for super effective damage and allowing Axew to attack without locking itself into Outrage. The move used in the last slot can vary depending on user preference. Dragon Claw is to negate the side effect of Outrage in exchange for less power. Superpower can be used to scout a potential switch-in, paving the way for Axew to ravage the opponent's team later in the game. However, the subsequent Attack drop can often be detrimental to Axew's sweep, and, to a lesser extent, so can the fall in Defense.</p> <p>Eviolite is the preferred item for Axew, as it provides a much needed buff to bulk to ease setup and take priority hits with more conviction once it has done so. However, Life Orb could also be used if one wants to obliterate foes with even more power, though Life Orb Axew often finds its sweeps cut short by priority. The EV spread provides maximum Speed and power while the rest is invested into HP to improve bulk. Jolly is used so Axew can get the jump on Magnemite and Dratini, two threats that have the potential to prevent Axew's sweep before it has even begun. Other options for the last slot include Taunt and Protect. Taunt provides a setup opportunity and a means to avoid getting blighted by status, something Axew must avoid. Protect is to fend off the omnipresent Fake Out.</p> <p>However mighty Axew seems, it is always helpful to have team support backing its sweep. Entry hazards from Dwebble or Omanyte can turn many 2HKOs into OHKOs, which Axew greatly appreciates. If it lacks Superpower, Axew finds itself walled by Steel-types, so Magnemite makes a great partner, as not only can it trap Steel-types and eliminate them with a swift Hidden Power Fire, but it can also take Ice- and Dragon-type attacks aimed at Axew, as well as bait Fire-type attacks that Axew can set up on. Bronzor is in a similar boat to Magnemite, but can also set up Stealth Rock and screens to aid Axew's sweep. Another Dragon Dance user that can capitalize on the holes that Axew punches in the opponent's team and vice versa is also good idea as a teammate. Mienfoo in particular has the ability to clean up the mess that Axew leaves behind, as it can defeat the Steel-types that have the bulk to survive Axew's Outrage. This set hates Toxic Spikes, so a Rapid Spin user or grounded Poison-type is appreciated. Tentacool fits both of these roles quite well, while also providing decent synergy with Axew and the ability to set up Toxic Spikes of its own.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf turns Axew from a deadly sweeper into a just-as-deadly revenge killer, able to come in after a teammate has perished and avenge its fallen ally. A Speed stat of 24 when equipped with a Choice Scarf is nothing to scoff at, and along with Axew's Attack stat of 18, picking off weakened foes becomes child's play. Dragon Claw is the preference of STAB this time, as a Choice set likes being locked into Outrage even less than the Dragon Dance variant. Superpower allows Axew to deal with many Pokemon that would otherwise give it trouble, such as Lileep and Ferroseed, scoring a nice super effective hit on them. Aqua Tail hits Hippopotas slightly harder than its Dragon-type STAB attacks, as well as scoring a super effective hit on the many Fire-types that plague the tier such as Houndour and Larvesta. Outrage, Axew's most powerful option, can be used when there is nothing left on the opponent's team to take a hit or outspeed Axew, allowing it to also function as a competent late-game cleaner or to smash a bulky check as it comes in so that Axew can pave the way for a sweep for a teammate.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Speed and power with the rest put into HP to provide a buffer for some weaker hits. Jolly is favorable over Adamant, as it means Axew can outspeed Choice Scarf Magnemite and other boosted threats. It should be noted that this Axew is much more frail than its Dragon Dancing counterpart, as it does not have Eviolite to increase its bulk. This Axew relies on hitting fast and hard to avoid taking hits. X-Scissor could be used to get a super effective hit on Lileep without the negative side effect of Superpower, as well as getting a super effective hit on other Grass-types like Shroomish, but it is generally an inferior option, as the coverage or power provided by the other moves on the set make better choices. Dual Chop has some advantages over Dragon Claw, as it enables Axew to break Substitutes and then continue to follow up with damage. It can also break the Focus Sash of Pokemon like Abra, but the 10% accuracy drop can lead to Axew's demise, so use this move with caution.</p> <p>Teammates that can take hits for Axew are appreciated. Magnemite and Bronzor are notable for their bulk and resistances to both of Axew's weaknesses. The former is great at trapping and removing Axew's counters, while the latter is particularly helpful for its ability to set up Stealth Rock. This Axew also appreciates Rapid Spin support, as it will be switching in and out more often than the Dragon Dance set. Staryu is a notable spinner, as Axew synergizes with Staryu quite well, resisting both of its weaknesses. Tentacool is in a similar boat, but is also able to set up Toxic Spikes, which can help break down some bulkier walls for Axew to smash through.</p> "

  "Shelmet": {
    "overview": "<p>Unlike most other Bug-types in LC, Shelmet happens to actually have decent base stats. It also has access to an important ability in Shell Armor, which pairs rather well with its boosting move Acid Armor and its nifty resistance to the common Fighting-type moves. This resistance in tandem with generally good bulk allows for Shelmet to regularly find opportunities to get up Spikes. Reliable recovery pairs well with these traits, allowing Shelmet to reliably counter Timburr and Riolu despite having a weakness to Stealth Rock. However, Shelmet's Special Attack leaves much to be desired, as does the coverage of a Bug-type STAB, culminating in a rather passive yet fairly sturdy answer to Timburr and Riolu.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shelmet's other options are few and far between. Shelmet can occasionally fit Toxic on its set, which is nice to wear down opposing walls and its common counters. However, Toxic Spikes support obtains the same goal and is normally a much easier to fit on a team than Toxic is on Shelmet. On the other hand, Baton Pass can be used over either Bug Buzz or Spikes, giving it the chance to make certain sweepers super threatening with multiple Defense boosts. However, dropping any attack from Shelmet's set in favor of Baton Pass is hard to do and most often is not worth it. Encore can theoretically be used to prevent Shelmet from being setup fodder and generally act to force switches and rack up Spikes damage, but Shelmet can hardly fit it onto its moveset. Similarly, Yawn can be used to force switches and prevent Shelmet from being setup fodder, but Shelmet will very rarely have room for this option. However, Shelmet can fit Struggle Bug rather easily onto its moveset but seldom chooses to due to the move's low Base Power and circumstantially useful secondary effect.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Shelmet has quite a few checks and counters due to its passive nature. Misdreavus is able to switch into Shelmet with impunity, thanks to its immunity to Spikes, great natural bulk, and resistance to Bug Buzz. Misdreavus is also able to use Shelmet's passive nature to set up a Nasty Plot and become incredibly threatening. The uncommon Fire-types all wall Shelmet hard too and can use their STAB attacks to send Shelmet packing. Similarly, Vullaby is a pain in Shelmet's side, due to its reliably recovery, phazing options, and ability to set up a Nasty Plot on Shelmet. Moreover, landing a Toxic on Shelmet causes it to be severely less effective, and if coupled with hazard support, Shelmet is forced to Recover every time it switches in. Additionally, Encore users such as Cottonee can stifle Shelmet's effectiveness and force it out every time. Similarly, Whirlwind and Roar users such as Hippopotas will often come out on top against Shelmet due to its minimal offenses and weakness to entry hazards.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Shelmet is a one-trick pony whose main draw is its ability to counter Timburr and offensive Riolu while also being able to get up Spikes to support the team. Recover allows Shelmet to continually handle Timburr and Riolu, especially considering its Stealth Rock weakness. Likewise, Acid Armor allows Shelmet to handle Timburr and Riolu even after they boost their own Attack to sky-high levels and generally serves to somewhat compensate for Shelmet's minimal offensive presence. Shelmet does have some flexibility with its last move; Bug Buzz is the first choice due to being Shelmet's strongest STAB move and therefore being mildly powerful. However, Bug is not a great offensive typing, leaving Shelmet easily handled by much of the metagame, and Hidden Power Flying can be run instead to give Shelmet the ability to substantially damage Fighting-type Pokemon without much of a loss. Either are important options to prevent Shelmet from being rendered useless by Taunt.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Shelmet's physical bulk, allowing it to reach an impressive 18 Defense with a Bold nature. Shelmet forgoes fully investing into HP in order to hit an odd HP number, giving it another switch into Stealth Rock. The extra EVs are invested into Special Defense because investments in Speed and Special Attack would be overall less impactful than giving Shelmet the ability to better sponge the odd special attack thrown its way. However, if Hidden Power Flying is used instead, an EV spread of 120 HP / 160 Def / 40 SpA / 80 SpD should be used instead; this spread also maximizes Shelmet's physical bulk. However, since 16 Special Defense cannot be reached due to lowered IVs, Shelmet invests to reach the next highest benchmark: 14 Special Defense. The remaining EVs are invested into Special Attack to allow Shelmet to always 2HKO fast Mienfoo, always 3HKO slow Mienfoo, have a chance to 3HKO Timburr, and always 3HKO Riolu. The ability Shell Armor complements Shelmet's defensive nature, making it impossible to critical hit and consequently overwhelm it.</p> <p>Shelmet is best suited to teams that have a substantial issue aptly handling Timburr and Riolu. This means that the likes of Misdreavus and Bronzor are some of Shelmet's best teammates, as not only do they provide Shelmet with a Rapid Spin immunity and a Drilbur counter, respectively, but they also can be preyed on by the two boosting Fighting-types. And while Fire-types are rare, both Bronzor and Shelmet are free switch-ins for them, and the duo also has issues with Misdreavus; both of these weaknesses can be covered fairly well with the addition of Munchlax. Munchlax makes an especially nice Shelmet partner, as its weakness to Fighting-types mandates a solid answer to Timburr and Riolu, while Shelmet's passiveness is largely made up for by Munchlax's walling abilities. Munchlax also has the plus of being able to phaze switch-ins with Whirlwind to rack up sizable damage with Shelmet's Spikes. Similarly, Hippopotas and Vullaby can also shuffle around the opponent's team to wear down their counters. Vullaby can also go on the offensive to wallbreak the opposing team, using Shelmet's Spikes to handle its few reliable counters. Shelmet's weakness to Stealth Rock and vulnerability to Spikes often require Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Drilbur and Staryu.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>After spending all of Black and White in the deepest shadows of Little Cup, Golett takes a bold step on to the scene as one of the most reliable Stealth Rock setters around. While Golett might not boast the sheer bulk and sturdiness of Hippopotas and Lileep or the Speed of Dwebble and Drilbur, it makes up for this with an excellent movepool and typing, allowing it to switch in quite easily during a match, get Stealth Rock up, and start breaking down walls. Despite still lacking a second STAB move (Shadow Punch was not released with the Black and White 2 tutors and so remains illegal), underestimate this little automaton at your own peril, because this cutie means business.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Golett has quite a few other options, but most of them leave Golett outclassed or are just poor options in comparison with its usual moves. Thunder Punch can be used over Ice Punch if you want to hit Slowpoke harder, but running it means you can't hit Hippopotas as hard or, more importantly, 2HKO Foongus and Shroomish. Fire Punch, likewise, can be used to hit Bronzor hard, but otherwise provides inferior coverage. Thief can be an amusing option and allows Golett to deal with even Knock Off variants of Mienfoo with no issue while also providing a nasty surprise for any Misdreavus switching in, but this is highly reliant on the popularity of Knock Off on Mienfoo. Rock Slide can be used to approximate the EdgeQuake combination, but it misses out on the Iron Fist boost and doesn't really offer you anything in the way of coverage other than hitting the odd Wingull or Mantyke harder. Rock Polish is usable, but extremely outclassed by Pokemon such as Drilbur and even Larvitar. Dynamic Punch and Focus Punch might look like attractive options, but they are both illegal at level 5. Finally, Shadow Ball can be used if you are desperate for a way to hit Misdreavus.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Misdreavus is the best counter to Golett because of Shadow Punch's legality issues. It can easily switch in and immediately threaten Golett with a powerful Shadow Ball or use it as setup fodder, only fearing the odd Toxic (or Thief if you're playing a really gutsy player). Slowpoke is also a very good choice, as its immense bulk shields it from being 2HKOed by Thunder Punch. Vullaby is also quite a good choice, though be careful if Stealth Rock is up, as it can be 2HKOed if it doesn't outspeed. Hippopotas likewise can't be 2HKOed, but it can't do all that much back and hates Toxic. Vullaby works as a check—just be aware that Ice Punch will deal a lot to it and it also dislikes Toxic. Natu can also work and even reflects Toxic and Stealth Rock, but Golett is too powerful to be stalled out with Roost. Other good choices include offensive Porygon and Frillish, both which can take a hit and strike back hard before Golett gets the chance to finish them off. The best way to deal with Golett is just to not let it switch in for free and hit its common weaknesses, but failing that, sacrificing a weakened Pokemon to it can make it much easier to deal with.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This is Golett's best and only set. Golett makes an excellent choice for teams that are looking for an offensive entry hazard setter, with several useful resistances, that can maintain offensive pressure. Thanks to its great typing, Golett has little trouble setting up Stealth Rock on many common Pokemon in Little Cup, including Dwebble, Mienfoo, and Porygon (try not to switch into a Shadow Ball or Ice Beam from the latter). After setting up, Golett also doesn't become dead weight. Thanks to its handy ability and very solid movepool, it can be an extremely potent wallbreaker. Common walls such as Lileep, Porygon, and Foongus all face a scary 88% chance of being 2HKOed by the appropriate super effective move after Stealth Rock. Earthquake and Stealth Rock are two obvious choices, being two of the best moves in the game. Drain Punch is a very useful coverage move and hits rather hard when fired off of a mighty 18 Attack and with an Iron Fist boost. It also provides a semi-reliable source of recovery, giving Golett a tool against Ferroseed and Porygon. Ice Punch rounds off Golett's coverage nicely, hitting Grass- and Flying-types for super effective damage.</p> <p>The EV spread is fairly straightforward. Max Attack with an Adamant nature is necessary to grab those important 2HKOs mentioned earlier. The EV investment allows Golett to hit 11 Speed, just enough to outspeed minimum Speed Magnemite and Porygon. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Golett's decent bulk, giving Golett reasonable 23/19/16 defenses with Eviolite. As for good teammates, offensive Pokemon that appreciate entry hazard support and the resistances Golett provides are generally the way to go. Cranidos is a very good choice, as it enjoys Stealth Rock on the field as well as being paired with a strong switch-in to Mienfoo. Vullaby also is a good choice, as it too appreciates entry hazards as well as partners with resistances to its Electric- and Rock-type weaknesses. Foongus is a good defensive partner, dealing with the Grass- and Water-types that commonly switch into Golett with little issue.</p> "

It doesn't really have much going for it when compared to other Dragon-types, as it lacks the setup moves that make other Dragon-types so dangerous. Deino's offensive stats are also average; it's somewhat slow; and its weakness to common Ice-, Bug-, and Fighting-type attacks make it relatively easy to take down. Additionally, it's an unreliable attacker because its ability, Hustle, lowers the accuracy of all of its moves down to 80% or lower. Deino does have a good movepool, however, and with Hustle, it gets a useful Attack boost to help overcome its low base stats, turning it into a frightening sweeper when equipped with a Choice Scarf to help its average Speed stat. Perfect coverage with Outrage and Superpower as well as a power boost from Hustle makes Deino quite hard to wall. Its Speed is also just enough to hit the benchmark of 14 Speed, letting Deino outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame when equipped with a Choice Scarf. It also has a unique typing and good mixed bulk that lets it tank some common Water-, Fire-, Psychic-, Ghost-, Grass-, and Electric-type moves. Deino is definitely the odd Dragon out, but that certainly doesn't mean it doesn't have a niche in this metagame.</p> ",

Deino has a very wide special movepool, with moves such as Draco Meteor, Dragon Pulse, Earth Power, Dark Pulse, and Hyper Voice. However, its Special Attack is quite low, making it an unreliable gimmick. Deino also has some other physical options it can use on its Choice Scarf set, such as Fire Fang and Ice Fang, but they don't hit anything useful and are rather weak. A bulky phazing set with Eviolite and Thunder Wave and Dragon Tail is an option, but Deino's weakness to common Fighting-types makes this a risky idea as well.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Deino relies on a Choice Scarf to work effectively, so predicting what move it is going to use and then picking a counter is the best way to deal with it. Steel-types are often the best counters to Deino. They do have to watch up for Superpower, but they can easily tank Outrage and Crunch. Bronzor gets a special mention here, as it's not even hit very hard by Superpower due to its Psychic typing. Physically defensive Pokemon also do a nice job at countering Deino. Hippopotas can sponge Crunch and Outrage and recover with Slack Off, plus hit hard with Earthquake. Fighting-types are also great checks. Mienfoo can take a hit and then OHKO with Drain Punch or High Jump Kick, and with a Choice Scarf, it can easily outspeed and OHKO. Croagunk and Timburr have priority, which lets them finish off Deino after some prior damage, such as Stealth Rock. Faster Choice Scarf users such as Chinchou with powerful STAB moves are also good counters. Drilbur in sand is a good check, as it can outspeed and KO with Earthquake.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Deino has just enough Speed to be able to run an effective Choice Scarf set, and with Hustle to boost its Attack to frightening levels, it can pose as a frightening sweeper. Outrage and Crunch are two powerful, reliable STAB moves that can easily tear down unprepared teams or teams that have their Steel-types removed. Outrage hits an astonishing 270 Base Power factoring in STAB and Hustle, and is perfect for cutting through offensive teams. Deino's wide movepool gives it many other options as coverage, and they can be used according to what you want Deino to hit. Here are some calculations that display Deino's power:</p> <ul> <li>Outrage vs. 156/196+ Eviolite Mienfoo: 65.21-78.26%</li> <li>Outrage vs. 132/212+ Eviolite Hippopotas: 48-60%</li> <li>Outrage vs. 0/36 Drilbur: 122.72-150%</li> <li>Crunch vs. 0/0 Eviolite Misdreavus: 109.09-136.36%</li> <li>Head Smash vs. 116/156+ Eviolite Shelmet: 86.95-104.34%</li> </ul> <p>Superpower is suggested for the third slot, as it smacks Steel-types for a lot of damage. The last slot is for super effective coverage. Head Smash is a really powerful coverage move that smashes Fire-, Ice-, and Bug-types, but has nasty recoil. Zen Headbutt can be used to hit incoming Fighting-types for a lot of damage, and it hits Croagunk especially hard. It should be noted that Deino should be played with caution, because Hustle decreases the accuracy of all of its moves, making it an unreliable attacker.</p> <p>The EVs and Jolly nature give Deino enough Speed to outspeed every unboosted opponent when it holds a Choice Scarf. Then, they are invested in Attack to make Deino as powerful as possible. The rest of the EVs are then split between HP and Defense to give Deino some bulk. Because Deino likes to come in and immediately start smashing things, it appreciates the removal of Steel-types, which prevent it from spamming Outrage. Magnemite can reliably trap Bronzor and also resists the Bug- and Ice-type attacks that Deino is weak to. Fire-types such as Larvesta or Ponyta also make good partners because of their ability to tackle Steel-types. They also resist Ice- and Bug-type attacks, and the former even resists Fighting-type attacks and can pivot with U-turn to bring Deino in safely. Fighting-types such as Mienfoo or Croagunk can work as teammates as well. Mienfoo can hit Steel-types hard with Fighting-type STAB and Knock Off Eviolites from the physical walls it baits in. Croagunk can do the same, and it can check most Fighting-types that give Deino trouble. Entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed or Dwebble make good partners too. They can lay Spikes and Stealth Rock, which damage incoming walls and brings many Pokemon into OHKO or 2HKO range. Psychic-types are great partners, as they can hit physical walls hard with their special attacks and can hit Fighting-types super effectively, removing Deino's checks. Deino, in turn, can remove Ghost- and Dark-types that give Psychic-types trouble.</p> "
