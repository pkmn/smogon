    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Clefable can run Unaware over Magic Guard to counter a variety of setup sweepers such as Necturna, Dragonite, Garchomp, Weavile, and Cawmodore. However, it is usually outclassed by Arghonaut, which has phazing and better physical bulk, in this regard. Additionally, the Toxic and entry hazards immunity that Magic Guard provides is usually worth more than running Unaware. Clefable can run Calm Mind on its utility set if its team needs both Stealth Rock and a secondary win condition, but this set compromises on both sweeping power and utility. Also on its utility set, Clefable can run Sticky Barb along with Trick to cripple Heatran, Toxapex, Equilibra, and Corviknight. However, Trick lacks the consistency of Knock Off and can sometimes neuter Clefable if it receives an unwanted item, such as an Assault Vest from Galarian Slowking. Encore can be run on the utility set to reduce Clefable's tendency of being setup fodder while allowing it to essentially win against any opposing Calm Mind Clefable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types such as Melmetal, Scizor, Equilibra, and Ferrothorn are all good answers to Clefable, as they take little to no damage from Moonblast and force Clefable out with strong Steel-type STAB moves. Kartana does the same, but takes far more from Moonblast. None of these Pokemon enjoy switching into Flamethrower, however.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Heatran, Astrolotl, Volcanion, Victini, and Volcarona all can come in on Clefable's Moonblast and force it out. Heatran can trap, taunt, and KO Clefable before it gets the chance to setup; Astrolotl can spam Fire Lash until Clefable is forced to switch and is very difficult to wear down; Victini and Volcanion force Clefable out with their nuclear STAB options; and Volcarona can setup alongside Clefable and beat it one-on-one. However, all of these Pokemon must beware Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Urshifu-R, Weavile, Tapu Lele, and Rillaboom can overwhelm Clefable and not allow it to switch in due to their immense offensive strength. Rillaboom in particular is a threat, forcing Clefable out with a roll to OHKO with Wood Hammer.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Poison-types such as Toxapex, Venomicon, Venomicon-E, and Galarian Slowking take little from any of Clefable's options and can force it out. It should be noted that Galarian Slowking and Venomicon must be wary of Knock Off, and Galarian Slowking cannot beat Calm Mind Clefable in a one-on-one. Moreover, the former three must be careful of getting hit by Thunder from Calm Mind sets.</p> ",

Clefable is a great user of Stealth Rock, as it can take advantage of free turns versus passive Pokemon like Blissey, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn. Knock Off is the best option for the final slot to cripple Moonblast switch-ins such as Venomicon and Heatran, but Thunder Wave is an alternative choice to paralyze Pokemon less bothered by Knock Off like Venomicon-E, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn. The given EV spread allows Clefable to survive a +2 Earthquake from Garchomp, with the rest invested in Special Defense to better answer Dragapult. Alternatively, if Dragapult is already checked on a team, Clefable can run maximum investment in HP and Defense in order to check threats like Weavile and Pajantom better.</p> <p>Corviknight and Toxapex are excellent teammates for Clefable, as they can switch in on the physical wallbreakers that Clefable cannot handle such as Weavile, Melmetal, and Urshifu-R. Along those lines, Astrolotl, Venomicon, and Earthquake Galarian Slowking make great teammates, as they can consistently switch in on defensive Heatran and force it out, though Astrolotl must be wary of Toxic. Pokemon such as Equilibra and Venomicon-E can take advantage of Clefable's passivity, so teammates like Slowbro and Zapdos are appreciated for being able to check these Pokemon. Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Equilibra, and Garchomp are helpful for threatening Heatran, weakening opposing Equilibra, and for pressuring defensive Poison-types such as Toxapex and Galarian Slowking; moreover, the former two Ground-types form reliable hazard cores with Clefable by providing Defog and Rapid Spin, respectively. Finally, if Clefable is running Thunder Wave, Hex Dragapult is an excellent teammate, capable of punishing the special walls that otherwise answer Clefable such as Toxapex and Heatran.</p> "

The final moveslot depends on the team. Flamethrower is used for hitting Equilibra, Melmetal, and Ferrothorn super effectively, while Thunder is mainly for Toxapex, which can otherwise use Haze, and Heatran. Knock Off can be run over a coverage move to cripple Pokemon like Heatran, Equilibra, and Galarian Slowking for itself and its teammates, though this decreases Clefable's sweeping potential. Similarly, Trick in conjunction with Sticky Barb can be used to further maim one of Clefable's checks, though this lacks the consistency of Knock Off. Life Orb is the preferred item, as it enables Clefable to be a strong late-game sweeper, but Leftovers is an option that allows Clefable to be a more effective wall before it sets up. 60 Speed EVs let Clefable outspeed uninvested Corviknight and slower Pokemon like Venomicon and Equilibra, however, one can put those EVs into Defense instead to be a sturdier defensive pivot.</p> <p>Clefable appreciates teammates such as Astrolotl and Garchomp that can take care of Heatran, which otherwise hard walls sets running Flamethrower. It additionally needs teammates that can switch in on Venomicon-E's Gunk Shot and Melmetal's Double Iron Bash, which Ferrothorn and Zapdos do well. Clefable pairs nicely with Heatran, Equilibra, and Corviknight, which can come in on opposing Equilibra's Doom Desire. In return, Clefable is a solid answer to Zeraora. Heatran deserves special mention for being able to trap and KO Toxapex, which otherwise can Haze stall Clefable if it lacks Thunder. Furthermore, Heatran pairs well with Knock Off Clefable, as it will be able to remove Toxapex's Shed Shell. Finally, Clefable should be paired with a special wall like Assault Vest Tornadus-T or Colossoil to take on special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Blacephalon that threaten it before it sets up.</p> "

Wide Lens sets can mitigate the unpredictability of Triple Axel, giving it near-perfect accuracy. Unfortunately, its lack of longevity and boosting power to the crippling level which Life Orb does pose more issues.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Due to its defensive typing, willingness to absorb Knock Off, access to reliable recovery, and its ability in Unaware, Arghonaut is the perfect check to Weavile, being able to easily take any hit it throws out and OHKOing it with Circle Throw or taking the opportunity to set Spikes. Buzzwole is a more offensive check that, if kept healthy, is very valuable versus Weavile. Urshifu-R can take a hit from Weavile and OHKO it back.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Tapu Fini's bulk and defensive typing lets it heavily threaten Weavile, with Choice Scarf variants in particular being especially valuable, as they can outspeed and OHKO Weavile while still having ample opportunities to switch in to. However, it must be wary of having its item removed via Knock Off, and its lack of reliable recovery makes it a poor check for the long term. Physically defensive Toxapex, especially one that has had its item removed, is a good check to Weavile, being able to remove its Swords Dance boosts with Haze and pressure it with the threat of a Scald burn. Colbur Berry Slowbro with Body Press is a niche but viable option.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types: Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory all do not outright get KOed by Weavile and are able to OHKO it back with Body Press should they carry it, but they are prone to being chipped down through entry hazards and must be carefully preserved. These Pokemon can also punish Weavile's Triple Axel with either Rocky Helmet or Iron Barbs in the case of Ferrothorn. Heatran can survive any move at +2 but cannot safely switch directly in, (RC) and must rely on the unreliable Magma Storm to force Weavile out.

Very few Pokemon check it for the long term, as they often only need their item removed by Knock Off and minimal chip damage for Weavile to muscle past them. Weavile's biggest shortcoming is the unreliability of Triple Axel, as it has a large chance to do negligible damage, or even none at all. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Tornadus-T, Astrolotl, and Kerfluffle; however, if your team has adequate counterplay to these Pokemon, then an Adamant nature can be utilized to boost Weavile's damage output even further, giving it better chances at +2 to OHKO Clefable with Triple Axel and Dragapult and Choice Scarf Jumbao after Stealth Rock with Ice Shard.</p> <p>Due to Weavile's subpar bulk, it appreciates Pokemon which can pivot into it to allow it opportunities to set up or deal damage, such as Landorus-T and Corviknight. While it can wear down most of its common checks like Buzzwole and Corviknight in the long term, a teammate which can force progress versus these checks such as Tapu Koko or Magnezone is valued. The latter in particular is an excellent teammate for Weavile, as it can trap and eliminate Steel-types Weavile struggles against while providing a slow Volt Switch to give Weavile more opportunities to come in. Pokemon that can provide entry hazard support like Ferrothorn and Heatran are great teammates for Weavile, giving it the ability to soften its checks faster and apply more pressure.

Weavile comes in on and immediately threatens the aforementioned Ground-type checks, as well as Dragon-types that Heatran struggles against such as Dragonite and Pajantom.

Corviknight is a notable partner, as it forms a sturdy defensive pivot core with Landorus-T and appreciates its ability to check Tapu Koko. In return, Corviknight can switch into Pokemon attempting to Toxic Landorus-T and it can come in on Weavile and force it out with Body Press. Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Kartana that like being brought in via a slow U-turn make for good offensive partners to Landorus-T. Both matchup well into Water-types that threaten Landorus-T. Heatran complements Landorus-T well as a specially-defensive partner that can act as a soft Weavile check or as a powerful wallbreaker that enjoys Landorus-T's U-turn with its Air Balloon set, also forming a strong hazard core with its ability to set Stealth Rock. In return, Landorus-T can check Pokemon that bother it such as Garchomp and Encore Astrolotl.</p> "

Finally, the combination of Block + Spite can be used over Scald + Haze to trap and PP stall foes like Clefable and opposing Toxapex to enable Toxapex's own teammates; however, this set forgoes much of Toxapex's general utility and is inconsistent and niche.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types like Zeraora, Tapu Koko, Zapdos, Rotom-W, Krilowatt, Magnezone, and Arctozolt are some of the most common and effective methods of threatening Toxapex.

Bulk Up Zeraora can also operate as a wincon on more balanced offensive teams, where it appreciates teammates like Garchomp and Clefable, which excel at chipping foes into range of a Zeraora sweep.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon all wall Zeraora, block its Volt Switch, and force it out. These Pokemon also commonly run items such as Rocky Helmet, which forces chip damage on Zeraora, leaving it more vulnerable to being revenge killed. All of these Pokemon loathe getting hit with Toxic, however.</p> <p><strong>Contact Effects: Chip damage from Rocky Helmet users such as defensive Clefable or Iron Barbs from Ferrothorn can put Zeraora in range of being revenge killed and overall decrease its ability to pivot.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Pokemon with strong priority such as Rillaboom, Miasmaw, Weavile, and Urshifu-R all can force out Zeraora, not allowing it to pivot. Rillaboom and Miasmaw in particular are notable, as they have a chance to OHKO it, while Weavile and Urshifu-R require prior chip damage to properly pressure Zeraora. Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, Kartana, and Victini fulfill a similar role.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Bulky Grass-types such as Jumbao, Tapu Bulu, and Amoonguss resist Zeraora's Plasma Fists and Volt Switch, and they are hard for it to wear down thanks to consistent recovery. Because of Jumbao's Trace and Fairy typing, it either resists or is immune to all of Zeraora's attacking options bar Blaze Kick, including a very useful Volt Switch immunity, making it a particularly excellent check.</p> "

Bulk Up similarly helps Corviknight check physical setup sweepers while also giving it a stronger offensive presence; however, Corviknight sorely misses its ability to pivot. Iron Head can be run over U-turn to hit Fairy-types like Clefable harder. However, it is noticeably weaker than Brave Bird in most scenarios, and again, Corviknight sorely misses the ability to pivot. Taunt is an option that shuts down Ferrothorn and Melmetal seeking to use Leech Seed and Thunder Wave, respectively. 200 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Modest Magnezone to avoid being trapped; however, the loss of bulk is quite noticeable. Shed Shell is an option on stall teams that prevents Corviknight from being trapped by Magnezone.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Tapu Koko and Zapdos can freely switch into Corviknight and force it out with their strong Electric-type STAB moves. Zapdos in particular is an excellent check, as Corviknight cannot safely U-turn on it due to Static. Krilowatt and Zeraora are excellent checks but may find themselves worn down after repeatedly switching in. Arctozolt is highly effective against most teams relying on Corviknight as their bulky Steel-type; however, its weakness to Body Press means it can't safely switch in more than once. Magnezone, on the other hand, stands above all other options for its ability to trap Corviknight with Magnet Pull and either KO or significantly weaken it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Heatran, Blacephalon, Volcanion, Victini, and Astrolotl all threaten Corviknight out. The former four Pokemon offensively pressure Corviknight, while Astrolotl can use a combination of Fire Lash and Regenerator to quickly chip Corviknight's health and is one of the few entry hazard setters that Corviknight does not beat. Heatran must be wary of switching into multiple Body Presses, however.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage: Corviknight relies on being mostly healthy in order to operate as a defensive pivot; therefore, chip damage in the form of Knock Off or Stealth Rock from Rillaboom or Landorus-T can lead to Corviknight being overwhelmed by strong attackers like Tapu Lele, Dragapult, and Kartana.</p> ",

Brave Bird is an option to hit Rillaboom, Revenankh, Volcarona, Arghonaut, and Urshifu-R. Corviknight's access to Pressure lets it permanently keep entry hazards off the field against Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T and Clefable in the long run, as well as stall powerful attackers such as Revenankh and Melmetal.

Its ability in Mountaineer prevents Stealth Rock damage, so you can forgo Heavy-Duty Boots and dedicate your item slot to a damage boosting option like Choice Band. Earthquake is absolutely necessary for dealing with Pokemon like Toxapex, Melmetal, and Heatran that would otherwise stonewall Syclant. Ice Shard is valuable for picking off weakened Tornadus-T without risking a Speed tie and revenge killing faster threats like Dragapult, +1 Garchomp, and weakened Unburden-boosted Hawlucha, though one can opt to run Spikes instead to capitalize on the switches that Syclant forces. Triple Axel is an alternative option over Icicle Crash that offers a significant boost in damage; however, its inconsistency and its susceptibility to contact punishments like Rocky Helmet and Static mean that the tradeoff usually isn't worth it. Syclant can also choose to run Superpower over Earthquake to hit Equilibra and Ferrothorn super effectively, although Earthquake's coverage is still superior in most cases.</p> <p>Because Syclant is extremely frail and held back by many common bulky Water- and Steel-types, it relies immensely on its teammates to shore up its shortcomings as a wallbreaker.

Other common bulky Steel-types like Heatran can also give Syclant trouble if it's locked into an Ice-type move, so having partners like Slowking and Equilibra that can reliably answer them is greatly appreciated. Finally, Syclant benefits from having reliable pivots on its team because it can struggle to enter the game safely; Slowking, Landorus-T, and Zeraora are all good options that can also apply pressure to common Steel-types that are difficult for Syclant to break past by itself.

Slowking is an alternative bulky Nasty Plot Trick Room sweeper to Venomicon that can set up against Heatran, which commonly harasses Trick Room teams.

Earth Power is a more accurate but weaker way to handle certain Steel-types like Melmetal and importantly hits Toxapex and Galarian Slowking super effectively.</p> <p>Because Stratagem can only boost once in most games, it works best on offensive teams punching holes for its teammates or as a late-game cleaner. Teammates like Volcarona and Zeraora are great at overwhelming opposing bulky Ground-types in tandem with Stratagem. Nihilego and Necrozma form powerul Meteor Beam cores with Stratagem and enjoy its ability to weaken Steel-types and special walls, while Dragonite, Revenankh, Rillaboom, and Kartana benefit from Stratagem's good matchup into Flying-types like Zapdos. Rillaboom and Kartana also provide Knock Off utility to remove Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots from the opponent's Pokemon, both of which Stratagem greatly appreciates. On less offensive teams, Stratagem relies much more on pivots to enter safely due to its low defensive stats and weakness to common types. Pivots such as Landorus-T and Dragapult can get Stratagem in on advantageous matchups so it can pave the way for them to clean up later. Finally, Spikes setters like Astrolotl and Ferrothorn dissuade the opponent from switching around Stratagem and also help it break down walls more easily.</p> "

Trick is useful in potentially crippling one of the opponent's walls if Aurumoth's HP is not enough to net a KO. Healing Wish allows Aurumoth to completely heal a teammate at low HP so that it can attempt to sweep once more. Blizzard is the sole attack, 2HKOing the two most relevant Ghost-types in Dragapult and Pajantom. Choice Scarf is necessary to outspeed as much of the metagame as possible.

All of the above characteristics make it a strong option on CAP hyper-offense teams. Drain Punch is the preferred coverage option, as it allows Cawmodore to beat Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Heatran and increases its overall longevity.

That being said, given the right team support, Volkraken can turn into a relatively strong special breaker with the somewhat unique ability to pressure all three of Tomohawk, Equilibra, and Heatran at once. Furthermore, Volkraken's access to Analytic can make switching into it quite terrifying. Fire Blast and Hydro Pump is a near-unique STAB combination in the CAP metagame that can prove to be difficult for some teams to deal with, picking up 2HKOs on the common Tomohawk + Equilibra core. Scorching Sands is by far the best option for the third slot, as it 2HKOes Toxapex and is a roll to OHKO Krilowatt. U-turn is used over Flip Turn to avoid losing momentum against Storm Drain Gastrodon. U-turn additionally chunks Slowking more than Flip Turn. Another option for Volkraken is to run Choice Scarf, which can give it an easier time fitting on teams, though the drop in power is quite noticeable.</p> <p>Volkraken appreciates anything that can help it get in against a foe that is forced to switch out so as to activate Analytic. Accordingly, it enjoys pivots like Kerfluffle, Tapu Koko, and Rillaboom, which appreciate Volkraken's raw breaking power and ability to pivot itself. Rillaboom deserves special mention for consistently beating Volkraken's two biggest counters: Slowking and Gastrodon. Dragapult is another notable pivot that can break through Slowking and appreciates Volkraken pressuring Clefable. Volkraken's ability to wallbreak is further amplified under rain, with nothing in the metagame other than Slowking being able to tank two Hydro Pumps in rain. Therefore, Pelipper and Barraskewda make excellent teammates for Volkraken. Entry hazard removal is key for Volkraken to operate well as it foregoes Heavy-Duty Boots for the power of Choice Specs, so Pokemon such as Equilibra and pivot Tornadus-T are important. Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Zeraora, and Melmetal that need the Tomohawk + Equilibra core to be pressured appreciate Volkraken's ability to dish out heavy damage to teams using this defensive backbone. Miasmaw, particularly the Taunt set, deserves a special mention as a teammate for its unique ability to deny Slowking and Toxapex Regenerator recovery. Finally, setup sweepers like Garchomp and Kartana that require chip damage on Pokemon such as Toxapex and Equilibra to win appreciate Volkraken's ability to force heavy damage on the opponent's team.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Jumbao derives much of its value from being able to support early-game wallbreakers that have late-game cleaning potential with Healing Wish. It also has a good matchup against most weather teams thanks to Trace, letting it copy Speed-boosting abilities from the likes of Barraskewda, Excadrill, and Arctozolt and potentially revenge kill these foes, in addition to copying Regenerator from foes like Slowking and Slowbro. Jumbao can run Drought with Solar Beam to support teammates like Heatran, but the opportunity cost of not copying useful abilities like Slowbro's Regenerator and Heatran's Flash Fire is usually not worth it.</p> <p>Jumbao is straight walled by Galarian Slowking, so Ground-types like Colossoil, Landorus-T, and Garchomp help to deal with it. Garchomp in particular is fantastic because Healing Wish lets it break down its checks early-game so it can sweep late-game more easily. Similarly, Flying-types like Assault Vest Tornadus, Venomicon, and Venomicon-E are problematic, so Electric-type answers such as Zapdos and Zeraora are helpful to have. Fire-types like Heatran and Astrolotl can cause issues as well, so Water-types such as Slowking, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini are strong teammates. Slowbro can also safely bring Jumbao in against Fighting-types like Urshifu-R with Teleport and provide it Future Sight support, making it harder to defensively answer. Wallbreakers like Dragapult and Melmetal appreciate Jumbao's Healing Wish, as it lets them play more aggressively early-game.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb Jumbao is an incredibly powerful special attacker, using metagame staples like Slowbro and Zeraora as entry points to fire off its strong STAB attacks and coverage. Trace allows Jumbao to copy Slowbro’s Regenerator so it can stay healthy and constantly threaten Slowbro throughout a game. Trace also allows Jumbao to absorb Zeraora's STAB attacks and switch into most Heatran sets, both of which are useful to balance teams. Leaf Storm and Moonblast pair excellently, as the sheer power of Leaf Storm dissuades Moonblast switch-ins like Toxapex and Equilibra from coming in. Focus Blast is important coverage for Steel-types such as Corviknight, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal. Shore Up helps Jumbao stay healthy, as it is otherwise prone to entry hazard and Life Orb chip damage. A Modest nature allows Leaf Storm to guarantee a 2HKO on physically defensive Toxapex as it switches in, as well as letting Focus Blast 2HKO Corviknight after Stealth Rock. Timid may occasionally be preferred to outspeed the likes of Tapu Lele.</p> <p>Jumbao pairs well with Steel- and Water-types, which cover its weaknesses to the likes of Melmetal, Venomicon-E, and Volcarona. It pairs incredibly well with Heatran, each resisting every type the other is weak to. Additionally, Heatran can pressure Jumbao's Steel-type checks like Corviknight and Scizor and use Magma Storm to trap and remove some of Jumbao's checks such as Toxapex and Galarian-Slowking. Jumbao also pairs well with Slowbro, which has similar type synergy and can pivot Jumbao in safely with Teleport while additionally setting Future Sight, which makes Pokemon like Toxapex and Tornadus-T unable to switch into Jumbao’s attacks. Toxapex covers Jumbao’s weaknesses to Scizor, Astrolotl, and Weavile and benefits from Jumbao taking advantage of Slowbro and Zeraora. Tornadus-T greatly appreciates Jumbao's ability to stave off Zeraora and Heatran, and in return Tornadus-T can often weaken Jumbao's answers like Blissey and Galarian Slowking with Knock Off.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Much of Equilibra's strength as a team support option in the CAP metagame comes from its powerful Doom Desire and ability to compress multiple crucial roles into a single team slot, such as being a sturdy Ground immunity, Volt Switch blocker, and reliable form of hazard control. Doom Desire can force predictable and exploitable choices upon an opponent, and when used in tandem with wallbreakers like Dragapult and Rillaboom, it can often mean getting a guaranteed KO. Equilibra is also a stellar hazard remover with Rapid Spin due to its winning matchup against common Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T and Clefable. Flash Cannon is preferred for Equilibra's final moveslot as a means to beat Calm Mind Clefable, force out strong wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Kyurem, and immediately pressure Flying-types like Landorus-T and Tornadus-T. Alternatively, Pain Split lets it recover against common switch-ins such as Slowking and Blissey to better check strong wallbreakers like Dragapult and Tapu Lele in the long term. Aura Sphere is also an option for beating opposing Equilibra, forcing Corviknight and Skarmory to use Roost more often, and avoiding being trapped by Magnet Rise Magnezone as easily. Equilibra's EV spread is designed to outspeed Tyranitar, survive three Heat Waves from defensive Zapdos, and tank one Fire Fang from +2 Life Orb Garchomp, with the remaining EVs invested into Special Attack for stronger Doom Desires.</p> <p>Equilibra's plethora of valuable resistances and immunities combined with its ability to consistently remove entry hazards makes it very easy to find partners that appreciate its presence; Tomohawk in particular has exceptional defensive synergy as a physical wall that benefits from having Electric- and Fairy-types checked, while Equilibra enjoys Tomohawk's ability to deal with Fighting-types and strong physical wallbreakers like Rillaboom. Clefable is also relevant because it can soak up common Fighting-type coverage moves that bother Equilibra, while Equilibra in turn deals with the Poison- and Steel-types that threaten it such as Melmetal and Nidoking. Strong wallbreakers like Dragapult and Rillaboom as well as other offensive Pokemon like Zeraora appreciate Doom Desire's ability to invalidate many of their respective defensive answers. Pokemon weak to hazards such as Choice Specs Kyurem and Choice Band Weavile also enjoy Equilibra's consistency in spinning away Stealth Rock. Teams that rely on hazard stacking benefit from Equilibra's Rapid Spin not resetting their progress. Finally, it's advisable to have a reliable answer to many of the bulky Water-types that hold Equilibra back, especially Slowking; Rillaboom, Zapdos, and Jumbao are a few options that can keep the pressure up against many of these Pokemon.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Slowbro can either punish Astrolotl with Rocky Helmet or ignore its Spikes with Heavy Duty Boots and ultimately use it as bait to use Future Sight. Toxapex and Arghonaut are capable of removing Astrolotl's item and are only bothered by Stomping Tantrum after multiple Defense drops or somewhat by Will-O-Wisp in the latter's case. Tapu Fini has worse longevity overall but is still notable for preventing Astrolotl from burning it, being able to remove its Spikes with Defog and potentially crippling utility sets with Trick. Rotom-W and Swampert are also nice answers, being able to stay healthy with Pain Split and Rest, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Pajantom and Dragapult, as well as the rarer Cyclohm and Hydreigon, are all unbothered by Astrolotl's utility options. The most Astrolotl can do is hope to overwhelm them with chip damage in the long run, but it will still be forced out in any normal situation. However, Choice Scarf Astrolotl turns the tables and can revenge kill the above Dragon-types, though it can still be taken advantage of if locked into an undesirable move.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Toxic: Because Astrolotl often wants to stay in for multiple turns at once, Toxic damage can quickly add up and prevent it from accomplishing what it wants to do. Knock Off is also helpful in either mitigating the effectiveness of Regenerator on utility sets, or in the case of Choice Scarf sets, removing its ability to revenge kill a faster teammate. Though effective individually, Toxic and Knock Off combined can easily suffocate Astrolotl and prevent it from making any meaningful progress. Heatran and Magnezone are two Pokemon that can inflict Astrolotl with Toxic as it switches in, while Clefable, Toxapex, and Arghonaut can typically remove its item.</p> <p><strong>Tomohawk: While a much more niche pick, Tomohawk remains a sturdy check to any Astrolotl set. Bolstered by Intimidate, Tomohawk's physical bulk prevents Astrolotl from easily breaking through it, punishing Astrolotl's hits with Rocky Helmet in the process.

        "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Astrolotl's unique offensive profile combined with an attractive set of utility moves lets it perform as one of CAP's defining utility options. Regenerator not only enables Astrolotl to be a great scout against Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Magnezone, but it also lets it stay in and accrue chip damage on foes like Tapu Fini and Krilowatt before switching out scot-free, trivially healing off whatever health it lost. The combination of Fire Lash, Will-O-Wisp, and Spikes is perfect for the job; Astrolotl can repeatedly force foes out with the threat of Will-O-Wisp or after enough Defense drops from Fire Lash, further capitalizing on any forced switches with Spikes. Stomping Tantrum is required for Heatran and bulky Poison-types like Galarian Slowking and Toxapex, while Will-O-Wisp is useful for denying would-be checks like Landorus-T and Garchomp from freely staying or switching in. Alternatively, Encore can be used over Will-O-Wisp to disrupt setup sweepers like Tapu Fini and Venomicon. Astrolotl is a great Spikes setter for its positive matchup against common Defog users like Corviknight, simultaneously denying entry to Defog Landorus-T due to Will-O-Wisp. However, Astrolotl is just as good at using Defog itself; it can easily switch into Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Clefable and remove their hazards, while Ground-type Stealth Rock users can never switch in without being prepared to accept a burn. The given Speed investment allows Astrolotl to outspeed Kartana and Alolan Ninetales, with the remaining EVs maximizing special bulk to withstand weak special hits like Tapu Fini's Moonblast or Heatran's Earth Power.</p> <p>Wallbreakers like Urshifu-R, Venomicon-E, and Weavile greatly appreciate Astrolotl's Spikes wearing down opposing bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Steel-types like Ferrothorn. Additionally, Astrolotl is a nice soft check to faster Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zeraora that bother these Pokemon. Electric-types of your own are great partners as well, as Astrolotl can often burn the opponent's Ground-type and pave the way for a teammate like Bulk Up Zeraora or Calm Mind Tapu Koko to win. These teammates can also keep pressure up against opposing bulky Water-types for Astrolotl in return. Bulkier, slower Pokemon like Venomicon and Calm Mind Tapu Fini are massive benefactors of Astrolotl's Spikes support and its ability to often draw out longer games. Landorus-T is a particularly good partner, providing a Ground immunity, inflicting Toxic on some of Astrolotl's checks like Slowbro and Arghonaut, giving complementary support with either Stealth Rock or Defog, and being able to easily pivot Astrolotl into foes like Corviknight. Lastly, other Spikes setters like Ferrothorn and Skarmory can enable Astrolotl to more comfortably run Defog or even Encore or Thunder Wave in its last moveslot.</p> "

Flare Blitz is preferred over Fire Lash for more immediate pressure against foes like Landorus-T and the ability to always revenge kill Cawmodore from full health. Regenerator additionally mitigates recoil damage, making it a strong low-risk attacking option. Draco Meteor is crucial for OHKOing Dragapult, with additional use against Garchomp and opposing Astrolotl; alternatively, Outrage with a Jolly nature offers slightly increased damage with the tradeoff of being much easier to take advantage of. Stomping Tantrum denies Heatran from free entry and is useful as a recoil-free option against Electric-types, Toxapex, and Galarian Slowking. Finally, a fast Healing Wish is a major draw of this set, letting Astrolotl give setup sweepers like Revenankh or wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Venomicon-E a second chance at finishing off a game. If Healing Wish is not needed, though, other utility moves like Defog can be run. The given EVs let Astrolotl survive one Earth Power from Heatran after Stealth Rock damage while maximizing its Speed.</p> <p>Due to Astrolotl often getting its item removed or sacrificing itself with Healing Wish, supplementary fast options like Tapu Koko and Weavile are good teammates. Astrolotl can even help weaken their defensive checks, such as opposing Landorus-T and Tapu Fini, respectively. Setup sweepers like Revenankh, Weavile, Garchomp, and Kartana that are prone to getting worn down or inflicted with status are good partners; Healing Wish allows you to play more aggressively with these sweepers early-game and attempt to clean again late-game. Strong wallbreakers that tend to get worn down by chip damage like Melmetal, Urshifu-R, and Galarian Zapdos are effective teammates for the same reason. While Regenerator helps prevent Stealth Rock damage from overwhelming Astrolotl, good entry hazard removal options like Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, Corviknight, and Colossoil are nonetheless helpful partners, with Astrolotl being particularly strong on teams with double hazard removal.</p> "

First Impression also lets it act as a good revenge killer, especially against Pokemon susceptible to chip damage such as non-Heavy-Duty Boots Dragapult, Jumbao, Garchomp, and Rillaboom. Poison Jab is used to pressure opposing Fairy-types, and it can secure 2HKOs on Clefable and Tapu Fini while OHKOing Jumbao.
