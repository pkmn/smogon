With its nigh-unwallable coverage and solid Speed tier, Rotom-A can pressure nearly the entire tier and force opponents into unfavorable damage trades. Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball are powerful STAB attacks that combine to hit the entire tier for at least neutral damage, while a coverage move of choice can better threaten specific foes. Overheat OHKOes Steel-types such as Metagross and Bronzong, and Hydro Pump 2HKOes Heatran and all but the bulkiest Tyranitar, while Leaf Storm OHKOes Swampert. Trick can be used to cripple support Pokemon such as Togekiss or Bronzong, which frees up Rotom-A to make use of its coverage options. Rotom-A's unique set of immunities and resistances allow for solid longevity even on this very offensive set, allowing it to use its powerful attacks without worrying about Fake Out or strong Fighting- and Ground-type moves, such as Heracross's Close Combat or Metagross's Earthquake. Choice Specs Rotom-A acts mostly as a wallbreaker, and it is particularly effective as a lead. Lead Rotom-A leverages its good defensive typing and ability to immediately pressure either of the opposing Pokemon, with Trick giving the additional option to cripple support Pokemon. As a lead, its Ghost typing gives Rotom-A a crucial immunity to Fake Out from Hitmontop and Mew, allowing Rotom-A to throw out strong attacks without the threat of being flinched. Mew in particular doesn't want to stay in on a Shadow Ball. Rotom-A appreciates teammates that can deal with Tyranitar, as it can take most of Rotom-A's attacks well while threatening super effective damage or setting up a Dragon Dance. Metagross and Heracross are good partners that threaten Tyranitar, while Rotom-A checks their counters, such as Gyarados, in return. Rotom-A doesn't appreciate trading with Sucker Punch Hitmontop or Mew, so Intimidate users such as Gyarados and your own Hitmontop make for good teammates.</p>"

Rotom-Heat's Overheat matches up better against Metagross and Bronzong, but one can change formes and use different coverage options for better matchups against different threats, such as Tyranitar or Swampert. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Rotom-A can drop a coverage move for a support move such as Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp and play more of a supportive role, especially after it drops its Choice Scarf with Trick. Choice Scarf Rotom-A is less focused on wallbreaking compared to Choice Specs sets, mostly a more support-oriented Pokemon early- and mid-game or a late-game cleaner. As a cleaner, Rotom-A prefers to lock into either of its STAB moves if possible, as its coverage options are less reliable and harder to spam. Overheat's and Leaf Storm's Special Attack drops greatly reduce Rotom-A's offensive pressure, while Hydro Pump's lower accuracy makes it risky to rely on for consistent damage. If Rotom-A uses a status move instead of a coverage move, then its priority is to lose its Choice Scarf with Trick and follow up with status moves to disrupt the opponent's game plan. As a lead, Choice Scarf Rotom-A can leverage its great Speed tier to get the jump on Pokemon that would normally be faster, such as Latios or Mew. In general, Rotom-A matches up well against common leads such as Metagross and Mew, threatening them with super effective damage. Additionally, more passive lead options such as Bronzong or Hitmontop hate getting a Choice Scarf from Trick. Choice Scarf Rotom-A appreciates partners that threaten Tyranitar such as Gyarados, Metagross, and Heracross, but it is less reliant on them than other Rotom-A sets to create value, as the Choice Scarf set doesn't need to spread consistent damage.

Bulky Rotom-A can drop a status move for Protect to allow for better longevity and easier positioning. Thunder Wave is often more valuable than Will-O-Wisp, as it can take fast threats such as Latios out of the game almost entirely, while the damage reduction and chip damage from Will-O-Wisp may not provide enough value in fast-paced games. Special Defense investment is required to be able to take on Latios's Draco Meteor and opposing Rotom-A's Shadow Ball, letting Rotom-A threaten super effective damage with its own Shadow Ball—physical damage reduction is more readily available through Intimidate and your own Will-O-Wisp. Sitrus Berry is standard, as the burst healing allows Rotom-A to match up better against the tier's strong attackers, although Leftovers can be used to offset sand chip damage and synergize better with Protect. While Rotom-A is able to withstand the strongest attacks in the tier, it doesn't like to take unnecessary damage because it is often a team's defensive glue, so safely bringing Rotom-A onto the field is important. Bulky Rotom-A can be used as a lead, but once the opponent realizes it is a less aggressive set, they can take advantage of Rotom-A's low unboosted damage output. Bulky Rotom-A often trades health for the chance to status a major threat, such as Choice Specs Latios, Choice Scarf Heracross, or Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Rotom-A's low base HP makes it a great user of Pain Split, allowing for another avenue to whittle down foes while increasing longevity. Both mid-tier Speed and fast offensive Pokemon appreciate the speed control Rotom-A can provide. Pokemon such as Gyarados, Heatran, and Metagross love outspeeding threats such as Latios, Latias, or opposing Rotom-A, which would otherwise apply a lot of offensive pressure. Similarly, as teammates, these same fast threats appreciate Thunder Wave slowing down common Choice Scarf users such as Heracross, as well as allowing them to win potential mirror matches.</p>"

Bulky Rotom-A often trades health for the chance to status a major threat, such as Choice Specs Latios, Choice Scarf Heracross, or Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Rotom-A's low base HP makes it a great user of Pain Split, allowing for another avenue to whittle down foes while increasing longevity. Both mid-tier Speed and fast offensive Pokemon appreciate the speed control Rotom-A can provide. Pokemon such as Gyarados, Heatran, and Metagross love outspeeding threats such as Latios, Latias, or opposing Rotom-A, which would otherwise apply a lot of offensive pressure. Similarly, as teammates, these same fast threats appreciate Thunder Wave slowing down common Choice Scarf users such as Heracross, as well as allowing them to win potential mirror matches.</p>"

However, Hitmontop lacks firepower against the metagame's many Fighting-type resistances and can be forced off the field by foes with Intimidate and its own Close Combat stat drops. While Hitmontop can patch up a team's weaknesses with its appealing role compression, it often finds itself generating little pressure against some of the tier's most common Pokemon such as Metagross and Mew.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hitmontop has access to numerous utility moves that can patch up a team's specific weaknesses or enable different teammates. Helping Hand makes powerful attacks such as Latios's Draco Meteor and Heatran's Heat Wave even more fearsome and difficult to switch into. Rapid Spin removes Stealth Rock from the field so that Flying-types such as Gyarados can switch in more comfortably. Hitmontop is also a capable Rain Dance setter, enabling Swift Swim users Kingdra and Ludicolo. Lastly, Hitmontop can choose to patch up its own weaknesses with Bulk Up, which it can use in the face of the Protect it often forces with Fake Out. Bulk Up negates Close Combat's Defense drop and a boosted Sucker Punch is very fearsome in the late-game.</p> <p>Hitmontop can choose to invest 64 Speed EVs to outspeed uninvested Heatran and to have a faster Fake Out against opposing uninvested Hitmontop. It is better to reduce your Attack EVs over HP EVs, as Hitmontop is somewhat frail, and its offensive capabilities are less important to its functioning.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Latios, Mew, and Metagross can switch into Close Combat and easily threaten to damage or KO it outright. Metagross is especially fearsome, as it doesn't have to worry about Sucker Punch damage unlike the other two.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Hitmontop is severely weakened by foes with Intimidate such as Gyarados and other Hitmontop that both comfortably switch into Close Combat. At -1 Attack, Close Combat will fail to OHKO Heatran and Tyranitar holding a Chople Berry, allowing them to threaten a lot of damage back. Similarly, Gyarados can effortlessly Dragon Dance on any Hitmontop without Toxic.</p>",

Close Combat threatens Fighting-weak foes such as Tyranitar and Heatran and does significant damage to frail threats such as Raikou. Close Combat incurs stat drops after use and makes Hitmontop prone to being picked off by neutral attacks; as such, it commonly finds itself forced off the field, as it prefers to preserve its utility for late-game. Sucker Punch picks off weakened threats and 2HKOes Latios. Detect allows Hitmontop to shield itself from powerful attacks; however, using Toxic will improve its matchup against bulky Psychic-types that want to stay on the field for multiple turns, such as Latias and Cresselia, and bulky foes that Hitmontop's other moves fails to cover like Swampert and Gyarados.</p> <p>Hitmontop is a common bulky switch-in to physical attacks or Dragon Dance users due to Intimidate, while the subsequent Fake Out pressure frees up its partner to eliminate them. As such, Hitmontop is often preserved for late-game, where its utility is even more consequential, and where it can help pick off weakened threats with Sucker Punch. Hitmontop also finds itself as a fairly common lead, because its Fake Out allows a teammate to set up Stealth Rock or Trick Room, and it threatens Tyranitar with a Close Combat; however, it struggles against other common leads such as Mew, Metagross, Rotom-H, and Pokemon with a faster Fake Out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Every Pokemon appreciates Hitmontop's utility, with the greatest beneficiaries being those that want to use their own utility moves to generate more pressure in the long run. Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Gyarados are threats that appreciate the setup opportunities that Hitmontop creates with Fake Out and by weakening physical attackers. Trick Room users such as Bronzong and Cresselia also enjoy Hitmontop's presence, as very few individual special attackers can punch through their bulk. It must be noted that while Hitmontop's Speed is low enough to be functional in Trick Room, it is often too weak and risks generating too little offensive pressure, especially next to the aforementioned setters. Hitmontop also finds itself as a common partner next to Substitute users such as Heatran and Metagross.</p>"

Raikou can also choose to hide in the back and boost its offensive capabilities with Calm Mind.

Dual screens allow Raikou's offensively oriented teammates to switch in more comfortably and threaten significant damage in return while also enabling the likes of Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Calm Mind Latias to use their setup moves easier. Light Clay extends screens to last for 8 turns, which often accounts for the majority of turns in this fast-paced metagame.

Cresselia is very reliant on its partners to make up for its own poor offensive presence, but Helping Hand makes up for this by boosting its partners.</p> </li> <li> <p>Psychic significantly hits Fighting-types like Infernape and Hitmontop, which is useful when Cresselia is commonly paired with Fighting-weak Pokemon like Tyranitar, Rhyperior, and Heatran.</p> </li> <li> <p>Thunder Wave is Cresselia's most reliable form of speed control, allowing slow Pokemon like Tyranitar and Swampert to outspeed Choice Scarf Latias.</p> </li> <li> <p>Helping Hand allows Cresselia to make up for its middling offensive pressure by allowing powerful attackers like Metagross and Choice Specs Latios to KO bulky Tyranitar and chipped Cresselia. Spread move users like Heatran, Rhyperior, and Swampert also greatly appreciate the boost in order to do as much damage to opponents as quickly as possible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Trick Room enables slow, bulky attackers such as Tyranitar, Rhyperior, and Metagross, as it turns their low speed into an advantage against the tier's faster threats, especially with Cresselia's Helping Hand support. Icy Wind can be used on faster teams, where it is advantageous to slow down Choice Scarf users like Rotom-A and Latios as well as other fast attackers like Raikou and Infernape.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cresselia can fit a variety of other options such as dual screens to enable teammates to setup, Toxic to wear down other bulky foes, and Safeguard to help shield it and its teammates from opposing Thunder Wave.

Incidentally, Tyranitar pairs well with Cresselia, as it threatens Rotom-A and can go on a tear with Cresselia's Trick Room and Helping Hand support. Heatran and Infernape, along with other Fire-type coverage like Rotom-H's Overheat, are also useful for blasting Steel-types like Metagross, Bronzong, and Scizor, as Cresselia can't touch them. Cresselia works well early-game to spread Thunder Wave and great late-game to secure a vital Trick Room going up, but it should be especially careful of Trick from Choice Item Latios and Rotom-A if used as a lead.</p> </li> </ul>"

Even Fighting resistances such as Heracross and bulky threats such as Metagross and Jirachi risk being 2HKOed. Furthermore, thanks to Dynamic Punch's confusion, Machamp sometimes generates free turns where it would otherwise be threatened.</li> <li>Payback hits Psychic- and Ghost-types that resist or are immune to Dynamic Punch.

Its typing leaves Kingdra weak only to opposing Dragon-type attacks, often making it hard to OHKO Kingdra despite its mediocre bulk. Kingdra only succeeds with dedicated rain support, as outside of rain it is too frail, too weak, and too slow to exploit the lack of viable Water resistances in the tier.</li> <li>A rain-boosted Muddy Water is capable of 2HKOing most of the unresisted metagame, picking up 2HKOs on bulky foes such as Rotom-H, Mew, and Metagross. Kingdra is hard to switch into, and Muddy Water's chance of causing accuracy drops reduces counterplay even more, but Muddy Water's own accuracy will sometimes cause key misses, which foes can take advantage of.</li> <li>Draco Meteor is a secondary STAB attack with which Kingdra can nuke common Water-resistant foes such as Latios and Latias and 2HKO the likes of Gyarados. It's also useful for nearly OHKOing the tier's frailer foes such as Raikou and Heracross and remains a powerful option outside of rain also. The Special Attack drop incurred by Draco Meteor often forces Kingdra off the field, as all of its attacks are significantly less threatening at -2, which can sap momentum from these rain teams that only get limited turns of rain to work with.</li> <li>As there is no permanent rain setter in the tier and Tyranitar's Sand Stream is highly disruptive, Kingdra can run Rain Dance to sustain itself and other Swift Swim teammates with additional turns to work with. Kingdra is not the best rain setter, as it is rather frail, so if a team has sufficient ways of setting up rain, Kingdra can also use Hydro Pump for a single-target Water-type nuke that outright OHKOes Rotom-H, Metagross, and Hitmontop and 2HKOes Mew, Latios, and Cresselia in rain.</li> <li>Kingdra requires dedicated rain support to be a threatening sweeper. Fast Rain Dance users such as Gengar and Raikou synergize particularly well, as the former is immune to Fake Out, so it sets up easier, and the latter can Thunder Water-types such as Gyarados and Empoleon. Hitmontop is another capable rain setter with its own Fake Out support. As rain teams are a dedicated archetype, it pays to have an additional Swift Swim user such as Ludicolo on the team, which also has Fake Out to create setup opportunities for the Rain Dance users. Tyranitar is a particular nuisance to rain teams, so Steel- or Fighting-types that can switch in and threaten significant damage, such as Jirachi or Hitmontop, do well to check it. Kingdra also works with additional fast, powerful hitters such as Latios or Choice Scarf Heracross, as their respective STAB attacks can overwhelm teams with their sheer offensive pressure and clean up opposing teams once Kingdra has done its damage.</li> </ul>"

Tyranitar with Pursuit is also a formidable revenge killer, as it can trap Latios after Draco Meteor, Rotom-H after Overheat, and support-oriented Mew sets, as weakened special attackers pose little to no threat to Tyranitar in sand. Pursuit's power being conditional means locking into it leaves Tyranitar prone to bulky foes such as Metagross and Machamp, threatening to OHKO it, or setup attackers like Gyarados, which may Dragon Dance freely. Stone Edge is the more powerful STAB attack against neutral targets and Flying-types, dealing significant damage to Raikou, Gyarados, and Togekiss. The latter two are OHKOed by Choice Band Stone Edge, while Raikou is taken down by the Stone Edge and the additional sand damage. Rock Slide is a powerful alternative attack for its strong spread damage and, especially with a Choice Scarf, the added benefit of possible flinching. Tyranitar's last moveslot is Fighting-type coverage to hit the Steel-types that resist its STAB attacks.

Tyranitar can opt for Stone Edge, which does all of those things and is especially difficult to switch into at +1 for nearly all neutral targets, OHKOing Raikou and Heatran after Stealth Rock, but carries with it a great risk of missing. Lum Berry gives Tyranitar a one-time safeguard against status moves that would otherwise significantly hamper its sweeping abilities. Tyranitar can also use resistance berries to improve specific matchups, such as Chople Berry against Fighting-types like Hitmontop or Babiri Berry against Metagross; however, these are highly conditional and Tyranitar may still be KOed if it isn't at full health.</p> <p>This set is particularly effective at preying on special attackers and passive foes like Cresselia, while offering the power boost of Choice item sets and retaining flexibility, though at the cost of having to find setup opportunities. Tyranitar isn't very threatening before a Dragon Dance boost and can be hampered by common counterplay such as Hitmontop's Intimidate, Metagross's bulk and Meteor Mash, and faster attackers such as Heracross.</p>"

      "Bulky Lead": {
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Tyranitar's tremendous stats, immense Special Defense in sand, unique typing, and wide movepool allows it to function as a powerful bulky lead that matches up well against common lead Pokemon such as Mew and Rotom-H. Its bulk investment allows it to shrug off special attackers and weak hitters even better than offensively-oriented Tyranitar sets, which allows it to trade better and thus grant more opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Stealth Rock, in combination with sand damage, wears down foes without access to consistent recovery options, and bulky Tyranitar forces many switches against common special attackers such as Mew, Raikou, and Rotom-H, which can't threaten it. Boasting significant attack, Tyranitar will OHKO bulkless Dark-weak foes such as Latios and Rotom-H with Crunch and maims foes with the weaker Rock Slide. It can also run Stone Edge, as this will OHKO even bulky Gyarados and guarantee breaking Heatran's Substitute. Its last moveslot can be Superpower to punch through its common STAB resistances such as Heatran and Empoleon, but Pursuit can be used to more effectively trap common Dark-weak leads.</p> <p>While Tyranitar is very bulky, it is slow and must fear many common physical attackers such as Gyarados and Metagross and Fighting-types such as Heracross and Hitmontop. Chople Berry offsets these immediate threats, but it is still important to pair Tyranitar with an Intimidate user. Hitmontop makes for an especially good pairing, as it can Fake Out opposing leads that Tyranitar matches up poorly against, such as Metagross and Bronzong. Alternatively, Sitrus Berry restores health to extend Tyranitar's trading opportunities.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hitmontop is an excellent partner for Tyranitar, as its Fake Out creates opportunities for Tyranitar to set up Dragon Dance or Stealth Rock when used as a lead pair. Its Close Combat hits Steel-types such as Heatran and Empoleon, which Tyranitar's coverage misses out on, while also scaring off opposing Tyranitar with Intimidate and the threat of OHKOing it. Another Fake Out user that works well with Tyranitar is Mew, especially as it can whittle down Steel-types with Earth Power. Gyarados, especially with a Choice Band, is another excellent partner because of its Intimidate and ability to hit bulky Steel- and Ground-types such as Metagross, Bronzong, and Swampert with its own powerful Waterfall. Fire-types like Infernape and Heatran can also eliminate these Steel-types that Tyranitar commonly struggles with, and Rotom-H uses Overheat while being able to switch into the Fighting-type attacks that Tyranitar often draws to itself. Conversely, Metagross can check Fighting-type threats such as Heracross and Hitmontop with its own Zen Headbutt. Other Psychic-types such as Latios and Latias will also check these Fighting-types with their Psychic, with Choice Scarf Latios outspeeding Choice Scarf Heracross in particular. Raikou is a great partner for offensively-oriented Tyranitar sets, as it sets up dual screens to amplify Tyranitar's innate bulk more so, and it can cripple Swift Swim users with Thunder Wave and eliminate Gyarados with Thunderbolt.</p>"

  "Clamperl": {
    "overview": "<p>Clamperl may seem pitiful, but its signature item Deep Sea Tooth doubles its Special Attack and makes it a fearsome attacker with Trick Room support. Clamperl exploits the tier's lack of common Water-resistant foes and can sweep through unprepared teams with its powerful Muddy Water, especially in rain. However, none of Clamperl's other stats get boosted, which makes it the slowest viable Pokemon in the tier and threatened by nearly any attacker. Clamperl is powerful, but its frailty and chance to miss Muddy Water make it an inconsistent performer.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Clamperl can drop a coverage option for Brine, which can eliminate low-HP foes without risking a Muddy Water miss. Clamperl can also run Hidden Power Grass to OHKO Swampert; however, as it already takes significant damage from Muddy Water, it is more important to cover the Gyarados and Empoleon matchups.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-resistant foes</strong>: Common Water-resistant foes such as Latios, Latias, and Shaymin all threaten to OHKO Clamperl with their powerful STAB attacks. While Clamperl can deal a lot of damage with Ice Beam, this means that it's not using Muddy Water, which leaves it vulnerable to the other opposing Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Any Attack</strong>: Clamperl is so frail that common powerful attacks such as Latios's Psychic will effortlessly OHKO it, while other attacks such as Metagross's Zen Headbutt, Tyranitar's Stone Edge, and many more threaten to at least 2HKO it.</p>",

      "Rain Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Clamperl will mostly be using Muddy Water, as there are few Pokemon in the tier that can comfortably take one, especially in rain. Common Water-resistant foes such as Latios, Latias, and Shaymin all move after Clamperl in Trick Room and take significant damage from Ice Beam, while opposing Water-types such as Gyarados and Empoleon must fear Hidden Power Electric. Clamperl needs Protect to defend itself in situations that expose its terrible bulk, such as when foes use Fake Out and whenever Trick Room isn't up. Trick Room is essential to Clamperl's success, as it can clean up late-game or weaken teams throughout the mid-game for another Trick Room attacker to clean up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dusclops is the best Trick Room setter for Clamperl, as it underspeeds Clamperl, meaning it can set up Rain Dance before Clamperl moves in Trick Room. It provides additional support with Helping Hand and can break Focus Sash with its attacking move so Clamperl can pick up more KOs. Bronzong can also provide Trick Room and Rain Dance support.</p> <p>Fellow powerful Trick Room attackers such as Rhyperior and Machamp can also pick up KOs whenever Clamperl misses them. Rhyperior is an especially natural fit, as its Lightning Rod ability keeps Clamperl safe from Electric-type attacks from Raikou and Rotom-A.</p> <p>Raikou is an additional Rain Dance user, and its Electric-type STAB attacks can eliminate common Water-types such as Gyarados and Suicune. Other beneficiaries of rain are fast Swift Swim users such as Kingdra and Ludicolo, which can help weaken teams for Clamperl whenever Trick Room isn't up.</p>"

      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Rhyperior's sky-high Attack and excellent STAB coverage makes it a behemoth that hits nearly all of the tier for at least neutral damage, solidifying it as one of the tier's most powerful attackers. Its preference to use Earthquake synergizes nicely with Levitate Trick Room setters, such as Cresselia and Bronzong, and its immense physical bulk paired with Solid Rock also allows it to function outside of Trick Room as a bulky attacker. Rhyperior benefits greatly from speed control, as it wreaks havoc under Trick Room; outside of it, it becomes vulnerable because of its pitiful Special Defense and many common weaknesses. The likes of Latios can effortlessly eliminate it with Draco Meteor, while Mew 2HKOes it with Earth Power.</li> <li>Earthquake is a devastating STAB attack, which threatens Steel-types such as Metagross and Heatran. Though Sitrus Berry threatens to 2HKO Tyranitar and Heatran without fear of retaliation, Life Orb Rhyperior OHKOes bulkless Tyranitar, Raikou, and Shuca Berry Heatran after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Rock Slide hits nearly all Ground-resistant and immune foes for neutral damage, with Life Orb Rhyperior 2HKOing common Earthquake switch-ins such as Latios, Rotom-H, and Gyarados.</li> <li>Stone Edge is a nuke option that, especially with damage boosting items and Helping Hand support, effortlessly picks up KOs on nearly all neutral targets. Life Orb Rhyperior nearly always OHKOes Latios, OHKOes uninvested Rotom-H after Stealth Rock, and even 2HKOes bulky foes like Mew.</li> <li>Many foes will use Protect against Rhyperior's pressure, hoping to stall out Trick Room turns. Rhyperior can maximize the value of these turns it can't damage foes by using Swords Dance, putting them under extreme stress the next turn, as practically nothing can comfortably switch into a +2 Earthquake or Rock Slide. This can be a game-winning maneuver, so opponents must be careful not to give Rhyperior these opportunities. Rhyperior can also opt for Ice Punch, especially when using Life Orb, as it OHKOes Latios after minimal chip.</li> <li>Protect is necessary for Rhyperior to defend itself from the numerous super effective and special attacks that could harm it such as from Latios's Draco Meteor, Swampert's Hydro Pump, and Machamp's Dynamic Punch. While Rhyperior uses Protect, its teammates can set up Trick Room or eliminate an opposing threat so Rhyperior can continue to attack.</li> <li>As Solid Rock Rhyperior survives many attacks on a small margin, such as Heracross's Close Combat, Metagross's Meteor Mash, and Machamp's Dynamic Punch, it often prefers the extra survivability from Sitrus Berry. Life Orb is preferred if Rhyperior intends to deal as much damage as possible as quickly as it can, especially in full Trick Room teams, as it hits numerous offensive benchmarks that Stirus Berry misses out on such as OHKOing bulkless Tyranitar. Stone Plate is effective for boosting damage output without chipping away at Rhyperior's survivability, notably OHKOing Gyarados with Stone Edge at -1. Alternatively, Earth Plate boosts Earthquake so it can OHKO bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock, though boosting damage on its Rock-type attacks is often more important.</li> <li>Solid Rock is key to Rhyperior's immense bulk, as this ability allows it to live hits from Choice Band Machamp and Metagross that it wouldn't with Lightning Rod. However, Lightning Rod still has conditional value to redirect the common Thunder Wave and next to the commonly paired Gyarados, which is another partner freely enabling the use of Earthquake.</li> <li>On full Trick Room teams, Rhyperior runs 0 Speed IVs with a Brave nature to minimize its Speed, but on less committed Trick Room teams, Rhyperior should run Adamant with 31 Speed IVs to ensure it outspeeds paralyzed Choice Scarf Latios.</li> <li>Rhyperior greatly benefits from Trick Room, and the best partners for that are Levitate users Cresselia and Bronzong, which Rhyperior can freely use Earthquake with. Cresselia is especially potent, because it elevates Rhyperior's damage output to dizzying heights with Helping Hand, helping Life Orb Rhyperior secure KOs on Mew and Metagross with Stone Edge and Earthquake, respectively. Rhyperior requires teammates that can eliminate common special attackers that threaten massive damage on it; Choice Specs Rotom-H is a great partner, as it has Levitate, a low enough Speed tier for Trick Room teams, and the power to OHKO Latios, Mew, and Bronzong. Gyarados is a fantastic partner, as its Intimidate weakens common Fighting-type attackers such as Machamp, Heracross, and Hitmontop while being immune to Earthquake. It also checks Swampert, which has the physical bulk and coverage to pose a major threat to Rhyperior.</li> </ul>"
