    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Seeing as it's the #1 Pokemon in National Dex order, you might expect Bulbasaur to be the best Pokemon in the history of forever. Unfortunately, this is not so, and Bulbasaur would need a lot of work on its stats and movepool before it has a chance at the top. As it is though, Bulbasaur can still work very well under the right circumstances, and, at least in Little Cup, actually make good use of what it already has.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Bulbasaur can actually run a decent Curse set thanks to its access to Sleep Powder, a strong physical STAB in Power Whip, and an above-average Special Defense. A physical or mixed Choice set can also be viable. Growth could possibly make a decent option on Bulbasaur; however, it's very difficult to set up, and Bulbasaur just doesn't have enough Speed to make good use of it. Finally, thanks to Bulbasaur's above-average defenses and typing, it can potentially make a good SubSeeder.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Thanks to Bulbasaur's Sleep Powder, almost nothing can come in with no potential consequences if Sleep Clause has not yet been activated. Because of this, the best way to counter Choice Scarf Bulbasaur is through prediction. Try to switch Grass- and Fire-types in on Leaf Storms, and when you think a Sludge Bomb is coming, Water-, Ground-, and Steel-types are the best switch-ins. Factoring out Sleep Powder, Bronzor is Bulbasaur's best counter, being immune to Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Ground and resisting Leaf Storm.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>The purpose of this set is to function as an effective revenge killer and a good late-game sweeper. Sleep Powder may seem a bit odd on a Choice set since Bulbasaur has to switch out as soon as it uses it. However, with a Choice Scarf, Bulbasaur outspeeds all unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup, practically guaranteeing that it cripples an opposing Pokemon on a consistent basis. Sludge Bomb is a very strong and reliable STAB attack, and it is the preferred attacking option on this set. Leaf Storm is an even more powerful STAB, but it gets much weaker each time it's used, which can leave Bulbasaur open to being set up on. Together, Bulbasaur's STAB moves have less than ideal coverage, so Hidden Power is there to round out what Sludge Bomb and Leaf Storm can't hit. Hidden Power Ground is used to hit Steel-types, such as Aron and Magnemite, while Hidden Power Fire is almost exclusively for Bronzor. A Modest nature gives a bit of an extra pop to Bulbasaur's attacks, and this can be crucial in securing KOs in many different situations. Due to the abundance of Choice Scarf users in Little Cup, however, a Timid nature is fine to outpace a great deal of them.</p> <p>One Pokemon this set works excellently with is Houndour, thanks to the near perfect defensive and offensive synergy it shares with Bulbasaur. If you really don't like the Special Attack drop from Leaf Storm, then Energy Ball is usable; however, unless you are keeping Bulbasaur in for more than 3 turns, Leaf Storm is always the better option. Hidden Power can also be changed around to suit what threats your team needs to have covered. Keep in mind, however, that STAB neutral Sludge Bomb is just as powerful as a super effective Hidden Power, so make sure there is no overlapping coverage.</p> <p>Bulbasaur really isn't the kind of Pokemon to base a team around, but it appreciates the support of Water-types, such as Mantyke and Chinchou, as well as Fire-types, like Ponyta and Houndour, because they all share excellent defensive and offensive synergy. Bulbasaur generally enjoys entry hazard support to guarantee certain KOs it would not normally achieve. Good teammates to set up entry hazards include Bronzor, Sandshrew, and Cacnea.</p>"

    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>A Substitute + Dragon Dance set with a Liechi or Salac Berry can be used; however, even though the boosts gained through this combination are very useful, the sweep will often be ended before it can even start if the opponent has a Pokemon packing a priority move. Similarly, a Swords Dance set can be utilized, but due to Charmander's average Speed and lack of a priority move, it isn't very viable. Though it's not recommended, Charmander can opt for a Choice set, but this is largely outclassed by the likes of Ponyta and Houndour.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Any Pokemon who runs a priority attack can easily stop Charmander in its tracks and even if it runs Substitute, it is still very susceptible to being revenge killed by other Pokemon with a priority move or Choice Scarfed Pokemon. Aqua Jet gets a special mention here, as it will always eliminate Charmander (unless it has a Substitute up), due to super effective damage.</p>",

Brick Break allows Charmander to hit Pokemon who resist Flare Blitz, such as Houndour. Thunder Punch rounds off the set by providing Charmander with a reliable attack to strike Water-types with.</p> <p>Priority attacks are Charmander's bane, especially from Pokemon who have Aqua Jet, such as Carvanha, Totodile, Kabuto, Buizel, and Squirtle. Substitute can be used over Brick Break or Thunder Punch as a way to shield Charmander from priority attacks but if Charmander does run Substitute it won't be sweeping for long, as Life Orb, Flare Blitz recoil, and Substitute will quickly deplete all of Charmander's health.</p> <p>Wynaut can be a valuable partner to Charmander, as it is able to trap and remove many of the Choice item priority users who can end Charmander's sweep. Also, Wynaut can Encore a resisted attack or a support move, allowing for an easy set-up by Charmander. Dual screens courtesy of Bronzor can be very useful, as they also allow Charmander to set up much easier. Munchlax can switch into and defeat Chinchou, who completely walls Charmander. Also, Dratini can benefit from Charmander's presence on its team, as Charmander can heavily weaken Dratini's checks and counters, allowing it to have a much easier time sweeping.</p>"

Whereas Staryu focuses on Special Attack coverage and can spin as well, Squirtle can revenge kill and provide some different coverage. That being said, Squirtle's Speed is still middling and without investment it can only take so many attacks. Aqua Jet isn't really powerful enough to answer Ghost-types on its own, so Spinning can be troublesome. Squirtle is thus difficult to play to its full potential, but can be rewarding when played properly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Squirtle has a multitude of other options. With both Counter and Mirror Coat, Squirtle can attempt a scouting set for Choiced Pokemon with Protect and the two retaliation moves. They can also be used as a surprise, since Squirtle can usually survive unboosted attacks at full health. Squirtle can use Brick Break or Focus Punch to deal more damage to Munchlax and Magnemite on its sets, but Zen Headbutt and Ice attacks are usually better for addressing Dry Skin Pokemon like Croagunk (Zen Headbutt) and Grass-types (Ice Punch). Fighting and Water also overlap quite a bit in LC because of the few Steel types, and while Normal offers unresisted coverage, Fighting does not.</p> <p>Yawn can be used to force switches, but is difficult to fit on most sets. Squirtle can also utilize Foresight with Rapid Spin, but will usually only be able to pull the trick off once. Water Spout deserves some mention, but due to Squirtle's low base Speed stat you will rarely have a Water Spout at max damage. Using Trick Room can be an effective way to remedy this problem. Aqua Tail is available to provide more power, but its loss of flinch chance and lower accuracy are considerable drawbacks. Hydro Pump, Surf, and Blizzard can be used over Waterfall and Ice Beam. However, Squirtle's special movepool is very shallow and it doesn't really have the stats to split its offenses without sacrificing its otherwise notable bulk.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Turtwig has enough defenses to wall Squirtle well and can use the occasion to Stealth Rock if it forces a switch. Munchlax effectively walls sets without Brick Break, but runs the risk of being flinched with Waterfall. Snover can stall Squirtle easily, resists Aqua Jet, and has multiple threatening Grass-type attacks. Lotad 4x resists Water attacks and Squirtle has no effective means of dealing with it. Duskull and Gastly can switch in and burn Squirtle or, in Gastly's case, strike it with Thunderbolt. Croagunk can finish off a weakened Squirtle, but must avoid Zen Headbutt on the switch-in.</p>",

      "Priority Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Double Priority is not uncommon in Little Cup, but there are few users who can do it well offensively while retaining decent bulk. The 0 HP IV allows Squirtle to sit at 19 HP, so Life Orb only takes one HP for each attack instead of two. Fake Out and Aqua Jet make this a suitable lead for breaking the Focus Sash of a multitude of Stealth Rockers, many of whom are weak to Water. This set is also good for hit-and-run tactics and revenge killing. As long as Squirtle is not KOed, it can threaten a priority one-two punch at any time during a match. Aqua Jet even gets boosted at low HP, a useful trait in a clutch situation.</p> <p>Return offers coverage resisted by none in Little Cup, while Zen Headbutt allows Squirtle to OHKO Croagunk, who otherwise poses a formidable threat, with Dry Skin and, often, priority attacks of its own. Ice Punch can put a large dent in Grass-types but be warned that the superior defenses of the pure Grass-types mean Ice Punch will not OHKO (Zen Headbutt does more damage to Grass/Poison Pokemon).</p> <p>A bulkier alternative exists with Oran Berry that allows you to come in more often. The EVs for that build are 244 HP / 212 Atk / 4 SpD / 12 Spe.</p> <p>Bronzor is one of the few Stealth Rock leads this Squirtle cannot handle, and so it pairs well with a Magnet Rise Magnemite. Protect Leads can stop Fake Out and then usually set up their rocks, although they take quite a bit of damage and can be finished off with Aqua Jet. Lead Turtwig in particular causes problems, with a threatening Seed Bomb in addition to thwarting Fake Out. Ice Punch also fails to KO. Ghost-types are immune to Fake Out and often carry Electric-type moves. Munchlax is a fitting partner to deal with these threats, as it can also weaken opponents with its notable staying power Lickitung is also capable of this and provides Wish support.</p>"

Chikorita does, however, have the ability to set up dual screens and it has access to Aromatherapy, making it worth using.</p>",

Hidden Power Ground can be used to severely dent the likes of Houndour and Croagunk, two of the most common switch-ins, but it will not OHKO either. Aromatherapy is a viable option to pack on a bulky Pokemon like Chikorita, enabling it to heal itself and its teammates.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Since Chikorita is a supporter and is by no means a threat to any team directly, Poison-type Pokemon annihilate it, resisting Chikorita's STAB Leaf Storm and being immune to Toxic. There is nothing Chikorita can do apart from switch out, giving them a free turn to set up. Gligar can survive a Leaf Storm and Taunt Chikorita, rendering it useless, although it cannot Roost-stall, since upon Roosting it becomes weak to Grass-type attacks. Bronzor has nothing to fear and hence can switch in with comfort, and then set up entry hazards or dual screens of its own. Fire-types such as Growlithe and Houndour nail a solid KO on Chikorita with Flare Blitz and Fire Blast, respectively, and resist its primary STAB move, although avoiding Hidden Power Ground variants is advised. Pokemon such as Wynaut can wall Chikorita provided it is not carrying Worry Seed. In general, Pokemon with Taunt and sweepers that resist Chikorita's Leaf Storm make viable counters, as stopping Chikorita from setting up dual screens or using Worry Seed leaves it useless.</p>",

        "description": "<p>With a shallow offensive movepool to choose from, supporting the team is sadly the only role Chikorita plays well. This set utilizes its bulk and helps the rest of the team by setting up dual screens. Both Reflect and Light Screen are very useful tools in Little Cup, and with them set up, fellow team members will find sweeping much easier. The idea is to bring Chikorita into bulky Water- or Ground-types, such as Chinchou or Sandshrew, and set up. Alternatively, it can hit back with Leaf Storm, packing 140 Base Power, which is sure to make a huge dent or even KO frail Pokemon that don't resist it. Worry Seed definitely deserves to be on this set, helping Chikorita escape from Pokemon such as Diglett and Wynaut by changing their ability to Insomnia. Oran Berry is a real asset to Chikorita since it increases its longevity substantially, although Light Clay is an alternative that can give your team those vital extra turns of dual screens.</p> <p>Chikorita does not need to invest at all in its offensive stats, mainly because it lacks good coverage and should stick to its role as a team supporter. Synthesis can be used instead of Worry Seed if you feel the need to preserve Chikorita for longer periods of time, although very rarely does Chikorita get a safe switch in. When it does, setting up screens should be its primary goal. Toxic can put pressure on the opponent's team, limiting the amount of time they can stay on the battlefield, although it is worth noting that Chikorita's most common switch-ins, Bronzor and Croagunk, are both immune to Toxic.</p> <p>Pokemon that can take Fire- and Poison-type attacks aimed at Chikorita are of great use as teammates. An example of this is Houndour, which can absorb incoming Fire-type attacks for a Flash Fire boost and proceed to sweep, while Chikorita can easily switch into bulky Water-type Pokemon that threaten Houndour. Gligar can take a Poison Jab aimed at Chikorita from Croagunk and KO back with Earthquake. Choice Scarf sweepers such as Machop and Mankey make full use of the screens set up by Chikorita and can survive for longer, enabling them to fire off more attacks.</p>"

A physical Life Orb set can be used with Flare Blitz as the STAB move, but it is outclassed by Ponyta due to its significantly higher Attack and Speed.

Mantyke can easily switch into any of Cyndaquil's attacks bar Hidden Power Electric and threaten it with a STAB Hydro Pump or Surf. Chinchou is in the same boat as Mantyke, as it can switch into any attack excluding Hidden Power Grass. Houndour and Ponyta not only outclass Cyndaquil in many ways, but they can also switch into a Cyndaquil locked into a Fire-type move and begin setting up courtesy of Flash Fire.

Also, with the boost obtained from Choice Scarf, Cyndaquil reaches a Speed stat of 24, which is enough to outpace common Choice Scarf Pokemon who cap at only 21 Speed.</p> <p>The choice of which Hidden Power to use is based solely upon the battler's personal preference; Hidden Power Grass has the ability to hit most Water-types for super effective damage, while Hidden Power Electric can hit Mantyke hard. This is important, as Mantyke would otherwise wall this entire set. Double Kick must be used with some prediction, as after Stealth Rock damage it will OHKO Houndour, who will often switch in expecting to sponge a Fire-type move. Though it may seem odd to use two Fire-type moves on Cyndaquil, if Cyndaquil has taken too much residual damage, Eruption will become very weak while Fire Blast and Flamethrower will always do the same damage, regardless of how much damage Cyndaquil has taken. It is worth noting that the given EVs make up for the stat loss due to the use of Hidden Power.</p> <p>Munchlax is a huge roadblock for Cyndaquil due to its immense bulk and ability, Thick Fat, effectively giving it a resistance to Fire-type attacks. Gastly can be used to beat Munchlax, as it is capable of luring and KOing it. Entry hazards, preferably in the form of Stealth Rock, can be quite useful to Cyndaquil as they break the Focus Sash of Pokemon who choose to carry it. Also, Pokemon who benefit from Cyndaquil blowing holes in the opponent's team are the best teammates for it.

Still, you don't want to underestimate this little crocodile. The only word that can describe a Totodile sweep is \"Crikey!\"</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Totodile has a couple more physical options at its disposal. Aerial Ace can hit Croagunk and Grass-types; however, Grass-types are hit harder by Ice Punch. Superpower and Brick Break provide Totodile with the ability to take down Steel-, Dark-, and Normal-types, but the Attack drop from Superpower is unfavorable. Brick Break is a decent substitute for Crunch or Ice Punch, though. It can also take down Reflect, which can hamper Totodile's sweeping potential. Rock Slide is a decent option, and it comes with a nice flinch rate. Lastly, Totodile does have Double-Edge, but Double-Edge has a nasty recoil, and is illegal with Aqua Jet.</p> <p>Counter can score some surprise KOs, but is hardly worth a moveslot. Totodile also has access to some strong special moves, such as Hydro Pump and Ice Beam, but it doesn't have the Special Attack to abuse them effectively. Totodile can run a Choice set, but when you have access to the two best set up moves available to physical sweepers, forgoing Totodile's sweeping potential is usually not the best option.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Croagunk and Mantyke are the two biggest pains in Totodile's rear. Aside from Dragon Dance Totodile, they both outspeed Totodile and heal HP from its Aqua Jet. Croagunk can the use Fake Out and Vacuum Wave in tandem to bring down Totodile, and Mantyke can utilize Hidden Power Electric to fry it into oblivion. Chinchou is also great, who can take hits thanks to its large HP and OHKO back with a faster Thunderbolt. Staryu works in the same way, except it has a little more trouble switching in due to its lower HP. Paras and Shroomish can switch in on Aqua Jet or Waterfall and put Totodile to sleep with Spore, but they must be careful of Ice Punch. Duskull can burn Totodile with Will-O-Wisp, but Crunch utterly destroys it. Faster priority users can revenge kill Totodile with ease. Stunky, Taillow, and Dratini, are all good examples.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Totodile can be tough to take down if you let it set up. Choice Scarf Chinchou and Choice Scarf Elekid can stop it if it has only one Dragon Dance under its belt, but will have trouble if Totodile manages to get two. Dragon Dance Totodile does have one huge weakness, which can be easily taken advantage of: lack of priority. Croagunk and Duskull can work together to bring down Totodile. When Totodile is going to use Waterfall, switch to Croagunk. If Totodile uses Return, switch in Duskull. You can repeat this until you take down Totodile with Fake Out, Vacuum Wave, and Shadow Sneak. However, your opponent may catch on to this strategy, so be careful not to mispredict. Other than that, high power priority, such as a Choice Band-boosted Stunky's Sucker Punch or Doduo's Quick Attack can weaken Totodile greatly.</p>",

Crunch is great, as it allows Totodile to OHKO Duskull and Slowpoke. However, Ice Punch allows you to hit bulky Grass-types such as Shroomish and Paras harder, who would love to put Totodile to sleep. Ice Punch also hits Ground-types, in particular Gligar, harder than Aqua Jet does. Waterfall provides Totodile with a stronger STAB and hits anything that does not resist it for a lot of damage. A Jolly nature is recommended, but not only because of the added Speed; if you run an Adamant nature, you have to sacrifice one HP point in order to max out Speed, reducing Totodile's survivability. Additionally, an Adamant nature doesn't help you score any more valuable KOs on Pokemon such as Bronzor than Jolly does. Life Orb is the item of choice, as it provides Totodile the power to score most of the above OHKOs and 2HKOs.</p> <p>Like most sweepers, Totodile greatly benefits from Stealth Rock and dual screen support. Stealth Rock helps Totodile score an OHKO on defensive Gligar, who would otherwise never be OHKOed. Dual screens allow Totodile to set up easier and help it take hits more easily. Type-wise, Bronzor and Pineco are the best options, as Totodile can switch in on the Fire-type attacks they attract. Encore support also makes Totodile's job much easier. Choice Scarf Wynaut is the best at the job, as it outspeeds Pokemon such as Swords Dance Krabby and forces them to keep setting up until Wynaut leaves the battle. Totodile can then easily use Swords Dance as the opposing Pokemon switches out. Ledyba is another great option, as it can both use Encore and set up dual screens.</p> <p>Croagunk and Mantyke are Totodile's mortal enemies. They can both switch in on Aqua Jet and KO Totodile. Croagunk can be stopped by Choice Scarf Gligar, who easily shrugs off Vacuum Wave and Sucker Punch. Gastly and Drifloon also work well, despite being weak to Sucker Punch, because Gastly and Drifloon can set up Substitute, while Croagunk attempts to KO them with Sucker Punch. Mantyke can be easily stopped by Chinchou, as Chinchou resists everything Mantyke can throw at it, aside from the rare Hidden Power Grass. Chinchou can then proceed to OHKO Mantyke with Thunderbolt. Speaking of Chinchou, it is another Pokemon who causes Totodile trouble, as it resists Aqua Jet and has Thunderbolt to subdue to it. Choice Scarf Gligar can switch in on Thunderbolt and Earthquake Chinchou, but will have trouble if Chinchou uses Agility. Munchlax can handle most of Chinchou's attacks, and hit back hard with Earthquake. Staryu is also a pain, as it is faster and has Thunderbolt. Elekid and Choice Scarf Magnemite can handle Staryu as well, and other Water-types.</p>"

With this set, you can easily activate Torrent, which raises Aqua Jet to an impressive 90 Base Power (including STAB), and with a Swords Dance under its belt, Totodile is hitting like a ton of bricks. Flail, though, is the magic of this set. Since Fail's Base Power increases as the user's HP decreases, Totodile can Substitute down to one HP, making Flail reach a ridiculous 200 Base Power. Combine that with a Swords Dance or two, and Totodile can rip teams to shreds. However, this set comes with a huge risk when using it. Snover is becoming very common, and hail absolutely ruins Flail. Also, faster priority users, such as Elekid and Croagunk, can cause this set trouble. Despite these risks, this set can dish out heavy damage and is perfect for daring players, or players who just want to use something less common.</p> <p>Salac Berry helps Totodile with its Speed issue. With a Speed boost, Totodile reaches 21 Speed, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon such as Life Orb Elekid and Houndour, and beat their priority moves with Aqua Jet. Liechi Berry can be used as a safe and surefire way to get an Attack boost, if you are unable to Swords Dance. Unlike the standard Swords Dance Totodile, this set can make good use of an Adamant nature. Since investing in HP is actually bad for this set, Totodile can fully focus on maximizing both its Speed and Attack, while still getting an extra point in Defense. With this spread, Totodile reaches 14 Speed, which becomes a nice 21 Speed after Salac Berry is activated.</p> <p>This set is very vulnerable to priority and weather. Croagunk utterly destroys this set, so Choice Scarf Gligar and Drifloon make great team mates for Totodile. Without Salac Berry, this set is also weak to other priority users such as Elekid, Stunky, and Houndour. Diglett can trap all of these Pokemon, and hit them with a powerful super effective Earthquake, but must be wary of Sucker Punch. Weather is this set's biggest problem. Both hail and sandstorm ruin Flail, and thanks to Snow Warning and Sand Stream, they can be permanent. Due to this, a Rain Dance user such as Mantyke or Horsea is recommended, since it removes hail and sandstorm. Furthermore, rain boosts Aqua Jet's damage output even greater.

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Sadly, Aqua Jet and Dragon Dance is an illegal move combination on Totodile. However, this doesn't stop Dragon Dance Totodile from threatening teams. On the other hand, while Dragon Dance Totodile is still a powerful threat, Totodile has some competition with Barboach for the team slot. Barboach is faster and has STAB Earthquake, but Totodile has access to Ice Punch, which makes it easier to take down Grass-types, as well as having higher Attack. Waterfall and Return provide perfect coverage with each other. However, Aqua Tail can be used if you like more power, but the trade off for lower accuracy and not being able to flinch is rarely worth it. Crunch can be used over Ice Punch to hit Ghost-types, such as Duskull, harder, but you have to question why you aren't using Corphish, as it does a better job at this. Life Orb is recommended for the item, since it allows Totodile to hit much harder after a single boost; however, Oran Berry can help you secure that boost and make sure you aren't going to be finished off by priority as easily.</p> <p>You can choose between Jolly and Adamant nature, as both of them are effective. Jolly allows Totodile to outspeed Pokemon with 21 Speed using a Choice Scarf all over Little Cup. Adamant, on the other hand, gives Totodile an impressive 25 Attack to work with. The EVs are pretty standard. Maximium Attack and Speed mean Totodile will be sweeping at its maximum potential. The 4 EVs in Defense give it an extra point in the said stat.</p> <p>Priority hurts this set more than the other two, since Totodile can't use Aqua Jet to beat them. Thankfully, Totodile is pure Water-type, and isn't weak to any priority. It can still hinder Totodile's sweeping ability, though. Diglett and Choice Scarf Gligar are great teammates, as they finish off Croagunk, Elekid, Stunky, and Houndour with ease. While both Diglett and Gligar are weak to Aqua Jet and Ice Shard, you have to remember one thing: Totodile resists these moves. Thus, Totodile shouldn't have much trouble taking down other users of these. Having Chinchou in the wings also never hurts, as it can take down Mantyke, who can cause some problems. Just like the previous two sets, Totodile loves having dual screens and Stealth Rock up.</p>"

  "Togepi": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Togepi may seem to be terrible, but it has a few niches that allow it to avoid being severely outclassed. Although its stats are fairly terrible overall, it has decent defenses and a workable Special Attack. Its saving grace is its massive movepool. Togepi learns nearly every single support move there is. It can also use its nearly unique ability, Serene Grace, to great effect. While Togepi is certainly not a good Pokemon in Little Cup, it does have a few tricks up its sleeve.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>As previously stated, Togepi has many viable moves. Togepi is one of very few Pokemon that gets Nasty Plot and Baton Pass, but is mostly outclassed by Aipom in that respect. It gets many special attacking moves; the most viable is probably Psychic to catch Fighting-types off guard, but Fire Blast is usually better. Heal Bell can remove status from Togepi's team. Counter can be used in conjunction with Focus Sash for surprise OHKOs on most Fighting-types. Keep in mind though that Machop will confuse Togepi with Dynamic Punch. Yawn and Encore are options to make Togepi a lot less vulnerable to set-up sweepers. Finally, Magic Coat is a situational move that, if used properly, can reflect entry hazards or status moves back at your opponent.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Most Fighting-types, such as Machop and Mankey, will easily OHKO Togepi with their STAB moves; they just have to watch out for a stray Psychic. The Toxic Stall set can be set up on by most Pokemon, especially if they carry Substitute to negate Toxic. Substitute Houndour with Flash Fire completely walls the set. While the ParaFlinch set is extremely annoying, switching out after paralysis will force Togepi to take another hit while using Body Slam or Thunder Wave again. Limber Buneary is immune to paralysis, and although it doesn't have the best bulk, it will easily take Togepi's weak attacks and KO it with STAB Return.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "ParaFlinch": {
        "description": "<p>As the only Pokemon in Little Cup to get Serene Grace, (aside from Happiny, who has terrible stats), Togepi can effectively abuse its ability despite its low Attack and Speed. Body Slam has a nice 60% chance of paralysis, but Thunder Wave always paralyzes (except against Ground-types) and can paralyze Ghost-types as well. Headbutt is Togepi's best way of flinching opponents, because if the opponent is paralyzed, Headbutt will have a 70% chance of causing the opposing Pokemon to do nothing. Fire Blast takes out Steel-types that would otherwise wall this set. Soft-Boiled is Togepi's best form of recovery, and paralysis can give Togepi a free chance to use it. Zen Headbutt, however, has a 40% flinch chance even against Ghost-types and hits Gastly super effectively. If Togepi uses Zen Headbutt, Thunder Wave is recommended so Togepi can achieve a Headbutt-like effect with Zen Headbutt.</p> <p>The EVs and nature maximize Togepi's Attack while still making good use of Togepi's respectable bulk. At 8 Speed, Togepi outruns all unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup after paralysis. Keep in mind that some Choice Scarfers will still outspeed Togepi. A nature that does not lower Special Attack, such as Naughty, can be used to power up Fire Blast, but it detracts from Togepi's decent bulk.</p> <p>Despite carrying Fire Blast, Togepi still has a lot of trouble with Steel-types. Therefore, Fire- and Fighting-types are recommended to help take out Steel-types. Running a team around paralysis is also a good idea, as it removes the burden of taking a hit while paralyzing the opponent. If Togepi does not have Zen Headbutt, Pokemon such as Munchlax or Stunky are recommended to take out Ghost-types.</p>"

  "Cleffa": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Cleffa is one of the weakest Pokemon in Little Cup due to its generally mediocre stats. It's rather unfortunate, too, considering that Cleffa has an absolutely amazing movepool. Even a movepool as vast as Cleffa's can't overcome its many flaws, the most notable of which is the fact that it is KOed by just about every attack in Little Cup. Cleffa does have access to the exclusive Magic Guard ability, which makes Cleffa immune to all forms of indirect damage and gives Cleffa a certain niche: an annoying Endeavor user. In general, however, steer clear from Cleffa unless you want to try something daring but new.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Cleffa has a great amount of other options, but sadly it can't make good use of them due to its pathetic Speed. Trick can be used to steal the opponent's item after Focus Sash has been used, but Cleffa will usually die before pulling it off. Wish has the same problem, but it can be a rewarding option if there's time. With base 45 Special Attack, Cleffa could use special attacks such as Shadow Ball, Flamethrower, and Icy Wind, but it's better off destroying foes with Endeavor. Thunder Wave in conjunction with Swagger or Sweet Kiss can be annoying, and could even allow Cleffa to use Endeavor again. Lastly, if you're lucky enough, Sing can put a foe to sleep.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Ghost-types such as Gastly and Drifloon are the best counters to this set as they are not affected by Endeavor. They can also use Substitute to block Cleffa's status moves and then attack, but they must beware of Encore. Oran Berry users are also major problems for Cleffa as the item activates before hail's damage takes effect, which allows the users to KO Cleffa afterward. Other \"counters\" are generally less effective as they will have their HP lowered to 1, but otherwise it's a step forward to defeating Cleffa. Pokemon immune to hail, such as Snover and Swinub, are decent counters to Cleffa. Likewise, Pokemon immune to sandstorm can counter Cleffa, but to a lesser degree as most Cleffa users utilize Snover instead of Hippopotas. If you lack any of the mentioned counters, then the best option is to sacrifice your current Pokemon to take down Cleffa's Focus Sash and KO it with another Pokemon.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Endeavor": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Cleffa's poor base stats in order to take down at least one Pokemon with it. Cleffa's Magic Guard makes sure that it isn't affected by indirect damage from the likes of Stealth Rock, which allows Cleffa to keep its Focus Sash intact. Endeavor should be used on the first turn since with Cleffa's incredibly low Speed and defenses, it will likely be smashed down right off the bat. By then, Cleffa's Focus Sash will activate, and the opponent will be left with 1 HP, which is enough for it to be KOed by residual damage from hail or sandstorm. Protect allows Cleffa to scout for potential counters, such as Trick users, and also to anticipate what move the opponent is using when Cleffa has no use left after using Endeavor. Both Toxic and Thunder Wave are helpful for crippling Pokemon that are immune to Endeavor, hail, and/or sandstorm, such as Gastly, Swinub, and Diglett. Lastly, Encore can prevent opponents, such as Substitute and stat boosting users, from setting up on Cleffa. By doing this, Cleffa has another chance to KO the switch-in with Endeavor.</p> <p>Hail can be used over the third slot if your team doesn't utilize Snover, but finding time to use it is hard. It's better to just put Snover in your team and preserve its health throughout the match. This set not only works with Snover's hail, but also with Hippopotas's Sand Stream ability. Sadly, there are more Pokemon immune to sandstorm than hail, making it a worse option. The 8 Speed EVs allow Cleffa to outspeed and use Endeavor on Bronzor after Cleffa has taken down an opposing Pokemon.</p> <p>Snover is a key component to making this set work due to its ability to summon permanent hail. Hail helps pick off every Pokemon excluding Ice-types after they have been Endeavored. Snover is not the only viable team option, however, as Hippopotas's sandstorm is also a plausible tool. Any Pokemon with Pluck, such as Taillow, can be useful for countering Oran Berry users so that Cleffa's strategy doesn't get ruined. Due to this set only requiring specific weather support, it has no real necessary teammates besides the above weather-inducers.</p>"

Snubbull also has usable defenses; with Intimidate backing them up, he becomes quite the tank. Unfortunately, Snubbull was cursed with terrible Speed, though this can be remedied with Trick Room or Thunder Wave.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Snubbull has a wide movepool, and he also has the stats to abuse it. A SubPunch set can be used, though it won't be as powerful as other Pokemon in Little Cup since he lacks STAB. Superpower, Close Combat, and Low Kick are all good Fighting-type attacks which can be used over Earthquake or Fire Punch, but these moves either lower Snubbull's stats or depend upon the opponent's weight. Overheat may be used to blast Steel-types, as the Special Attack drop doesn't affect any of Snubbull's other moves. Taunt can be used to stop an opponent from setting up, Roar can phaze the opponent's team to rack up damage from entry hazards, and Reflect can be used to support Snubbull's teammates. Finally, Bulk Up can be used to raise Snubbull's Attack and Defense by one stage.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Bronzor is one of the biggest counters to Snubbull as it resists Return, is immune to Earthquake, and has enough Defense to survive Crunch; Fire Punch is the only move he has to worry about. Gligar is immune to Earthquake and has high Defense and Speed, though he needs to watch out for Ice Punch. Slowpoke can tank Snubbull all day and restore its health with Slack Off, though repeated hits from Crunch may cause problems. Duskull can burn Snubbull, is immune to Return, and has enough Defense to survive Crunch. All of Snubbull's counters have to be careful as he'll almost always have a move that can hit them super effectively. Priority users such as Croagunk can hit Snubbull before it has the chance to attack, and Pokemon who are slower than Snubbull in Trick Room are also good; Munchlax is a good example.</p>",

Return is Snubbull's most reliable STAB attack, Crunch is used to hit Ghost-types such as Duskull, and Earthquake is used to hit Steel-types such as Aron. In the final slot, the choice between Ice Punch or Fire Punch depends on which opponent you would like to hit harder; Ice Punch has the benefit of hitting Gligar super effectively, while also dealing huge damage to Grass-types, while Fire Punch can hit Levitate Bronzor, along with Grass- and Ice-types, super effectively. Intimidate is a great ability as it goes hand in hand with Snubbull's bulk and extra defensive EVs.</p> <p>The EVs are tailor-made to make Snubbull a powerful, yet defensive, sweeper. Max Attack ensures that Snubbull is dishing out a lot of damage, while max HP, along with extra Special Defense EVs, gives him extra bulk. The item choice is down to personal preference; Life Orb provides extra power, although the recoil damage is a turn off, while an Oran Berry can be used to restore some of Snubbull's HP. A Choice Band can be used for even more damage output, but it restricts Snubbull to a single move.</p> <p>Snubbull appreciates Stealth Rock on the field as it weakens the opponent's team, allowing Snubbull to sweep more easily. Phanpy and Bronzor are great options to set them up because of their high defenses and access to numerous support options. Of course, keeping them on the opponent's side of the field is important too; a Ghost-type who can block Rapid Spin is a great teammate. Duskull is great for this role because of his good defenses and access to other support moves.</p> <p>Pokemon who can set up Trick Room are helpful as well. Bronzor and Duskull are the best options as they have good defenses, along with access to other support moves such as Stealth Rock or Will-O-Wisp; Duskull can also switch into Fighting-type attacks aimed at Snubbull.

Quite frankly, there are always much better options than Tyrogue.</p>",

It has access to Fake Out, which would guarantee a safe status orb activation, but is too slow, frail, and weak to utilize it effectively. It also gets Rapid Spin and Foresight, but doesn't have the bulk to use them effectively at all. Vacuum Wave is a decent substitute for Bullet Punch, as Tyrogue does have equal Special Attack. Bulk Up raises Tyrogue's Attack and Defense, and Mach Punch and Bullet Punch make up for Tyrogue's dismal Speed.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>It's rather difficult to not be a counter to Tyrogue, as long as it's not weak to Fighting-type attacks. Pokemon not taking super effective damage from High Jump Kick can usually switch in with ease, and can, at the worst, 2HKO Tyrogue with a neutral STAB attack. Physical walls take little damage from its attacks, and most Pokemon should be able to take a neutral hit or two. Bronzor, Hippopotas, Gligar, and many others stop it cold, and revenge killing Tyrogue is very easy, especially if Trick Room is not in play.</p>",

With absolute minimum Speed investment and a hindering nature, Tyrogue hits 8 Speed, which allows it to outspeed many Pokemon under Trick Room, including Bronzor with 12 Speed EVs and a neutral nature. Although Tyrogue has low Attack, it is made usable with Guts and the powerful STAB High Jump Kick, which is a powerful STAB attack. Facade makes good use of Toxic Orb by hitting many Pokemon for neutral damage off of 140 Base Power. Rock Slide hits Flying-types that resist High Jump Kick, and finally, Bullet Punch gives Tyrogue priority, which is always good. Toxic Orb is preferred over Flame Orb because it costs Tyrogue less HP over two turns than Flame Orb, and Tyrogue generally won't be in longer than two turns anyways. The EVs maximize HP and Attack, giving Tyrogue as much power and bulk as possible.</p> <p>The best teammates for this set are Trick Room supporters. Bronzor, Duskull, and Slowpoke all have good defenses and can set up Trick Room with ease. Other good partners for Tyrogue are ones that can remove Gligar, a dangerous counter to Tyrogue, from the field. Bronzor once again receives a mention as it is immune to Earthquake, resists Stone Edge, and can easily OHKO Gligar with Hidden Power Ice. Bulky Waters like Mantyke also fare well against Gligar, and can easily OHKO it with their STAB attacks. Brick Break is a possible option over High Jump Kick, as it has higher accuracy, no potential recoil, and can break screens set up by the opponent.

The last move comes down to preference. Rock Slide is the preferred attack as it will do the most damage to Ghost-types, who are immune to both Fake Out and High Jump Kick. However, Facade hits all other Pokemon who resist High Jump Kick harder than Rock Slide in most cases. The EVs and an Adamant nature give Tyrogue maximum Attack and Speed, allowing it to outspeed a few Pokemon while increasing its damage output.</p> <p>The best teammates that can help Tyrogue sweep are Pokemon who can remove physical walls, especially bulky Ground-types such as Hippopotas and Gligar. Snover is the best teammate for this reason, as it can easily use Blizzard to dispose of the ones who don't switch out. Unfortunately, Snover's hail will cause Tyrogue to lose extra health per turn. Staryu can beat both Hippopotas and Gligar with a Water-type STAB move. Pursuit users, such as Munchlax and Stunky, are also good teammates, as a Pursuited Ghost-type means Tyrogue will no longer have to worry about losing health from an evaded High Jump Kick.</p>"

  "Treecko": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Treecko is one of those Pokemon that can do everything, but do it in only an average way - it is pretty difficult to predict what it is going to do next, but once you have it figured out, Treecko tends to die quickly. It is pretty quick, but it isn't enough to make it outstanding, it isn't overtly frail, but it isn't defensively competent either. Its movepool is where it excels, but it can only ever carry four moves at a time. It can beat almost any Pokemon in Little Cup given the right moveset, but it never seems to carry the right one at the right time.</p> <p>All in all, Treecko is a decent Pokemon with some promise, but don't expect him to outperform the more commonly used Pokemon anytime soon. You may well describe him as a small packet of Haribo - he is versatile in flavor, but lacking in substance.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Treecko's Choice Specs Leaf Storm is very powerful, though it's a shame that so many Pokemon resist it, as otherwise it could be quite the force. Treecko has a pretty good physical movepool, with access to Swords Dance, Seed Bomb, Quick Attack, Brick Break, Rock Slide, Aerial Ace, Thunder Punch, and Crunch, but Treecko's low Attack stat means that that sort of role is better delegated to other Pokemon. Treecko is perhaps the premier user of Endeavor + Counter sets in Little Cup, whereby it takes a physical hit, survives with Focus Sash, and KOes the opponent with Counter, or else uses Endeavor + Quick Attack if they are faster and likely to use a special move. Endeavor and Counter are, however, illegal with Grass Whistle and Leaf Storm. Also, with the influx of priority users in Little Cup, this strategy is not as effective as it may seem on paper. Lastly, Agility is a nice move which boosts Treecko's Speed, and can be used alongside Swords Dance, or Substitute and a Petaya Berry, which also takes advantage of Overgrow.</p> <p>Leech Seed can be used to stall out a slower opponent such as Bronzor or Munchlax, while shuffling them and hopefully racking up entry hazard damage as well. Hidden Power Ice is an alternative to Hidden Power Fire, hitting Dratini, Gligar, and Taillow rather than Bronzor, Snover, and Paras for super effective damage. Hidden Power Rock hits Taillow, Snover, Houndour, and Paras rather than Bronzor and Croagunk. Giga Drain can replenish lost health, albeit not by much. Protect can be used on the Lead set to block Meowth's Fake Out. If you are feeling confident, Treecko can use Synthesis to offset Life Orb or Substitute damage on a sweeping set. Lastly, Aerial Ace is an option to take down Croagunk and Machop with assurance, and is also useful against other Grass-types as well as Bug-types.</p> <p>Treecko has a decent Speed stat, which can be a real asset to overcome his less-than-impenetrable defensive stats, so max Speed is usually the best course of action on any set. Remember that if Treecko runs Hidden Power Fire, it will need 200 EVs to max it out due to having to run a 30 Speed IV -- without it it only needs 196 EVs. Next you should aim to max out the primary attacking stat, both of which max out with 236 EVs, or 240 EVs if it runs Hidden Power Fire. When going mixed it is recommended that you max out Treecko's better Special Attack anyway, as Treecko needs all the power it can get. This will leave you with 68 EVs left over, of which 36 EVs are sufficient to get an extra point in HP. If Treecko does not run Hidden Power Fire, you will have 76 EVs left over, which will give Treecko an extra point in any of Attack, Defense, or Special Defense. If Treecko holds Life Orb, it should run a 0 HP IV to minimize the recoil. Lastly, when using a set with Counter, you should aim to minimize Treecko's Defense stat in order to ensure the maximum possible damage done.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Treecko is rather versatile, and you should never underestimate its ability to surprise you. Although a total of seven different types resist its STAB, the number of moves it can potentially run can always catch you off-guard. Once you have figured out the moveset, Treecko is a lot easier to handle, if it isn't already dead.</p> <p>Fire-types such as Houndour and Magby are usually the best switch-ins, as they have useful resistances to both Grass- and Fire-type attacks, but you must be wary of a surprise Hidden Power Rock. In the same vein, Flying-types such as Taillow and Doduo also resist Grass and can attack back with their STAB attacks, though if they are weakened by enough residual damage, they may well find themselves either in Quick Attack range or dying after their attack. Gastly and Stunky both resist Grass - Stunky can be rid of Treecko either by Sucker Punch or Pursuit, while Gastly is faster and is immune to Quick Attack. Dratini is another Pokemon that resists both Grass and Fire, and can set up a Dragon Dance sweep if Treecko attempts to flee, or else beat Treecko with Extreme Speed.</p> <p>On the special side of things, Munchlax is probably the best check you can find. With enough Special Defense to take Energy Ball and a resistance to Hidden Power Fire and Ice with Thick Fat, as well as the ability to OHKO with Fire Punch or Return, it easily beats Treecko. Bronzor is weak to Hidden Power Fire, but resists nigh-on everything else Treecko has and has the defensive stats to take several attacks and KO back. Treecko is quite frail and is easily revenge killed, even factoring in Quick Attack - although Croagunk cannot take Hidden Power Fire, it can usually beat Treecko with Fake Out + Vacuum Wave, and can come in on any STAB attack with its Grass resistance. Treecko is not as fast as it would like to be either, and there are a number of Pokemon that can outrun and OHKO it, such as Elekid, Taillow, and Staryu, although these have to watch out for Agility variants of Treecko. Phanpy deserves a special mention as it can sometimes lure out Treecko and destroy it with Ice Shard.</p> <p>Remember that none of these checks are complete counters in any way - even granted a resistance they can be stopped on the switch by a surprise set, so always be on your guard.</p>",

      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>There are several ways that Treecko can be used in the lead spot, and this variant is perhaps the most useful, and almost certainly the most conventional of all of them. Leaf Storm is its basic STAB move, and due to Treecko's above average Speed and Special Attack, it is a good move for hit-and-run attacks against most Pokemon in Little Cup, especially if you can get Treecko into Overgrow range. It also happens to score super effective damage against a good number of common leads and even those that resist it cannot usually afford to switch in safely. Hidden Power Fire gives good coverage alongside Leaf Storm and also 2HKOs lead Bronzor, as well as OHKOing Snover. Grass Whistle is an interesting move that, while having a quite unreliable 55% accuracy, can be used to incapacitate a member of the opponent's team that Treecko cannot pass through, or to prevent a slower Pokemon such as Bronzor from setting up. Grass Whistle is also of particular note against Machop leads, against whom Grass Whistle is guaranteed to hit thanks to Machop's ability, No Guard.</p> <p>In the last slot, Quick Attack is a useful tool to finish off any slower Focus Sash leads, and is also useful later on in the game if revenge killing is required. Focus Punch, on the other hand, can be used alongside Grass Whistle to buy free turns in which to charge up a punch, and can be rewarding if Treecko happens to catch a Munchlax attempting to soak up a predicted Leaf Storm. Focus Sash will save Treecko if it happens to fall on the wrong end of an attack that would normally OHKO, which is helpful as it will simultaneously activate Overgrow, adding to the raw power of Leaf Storm. The given EV spread generates maximum Special Attack and Speed while also giving an extra point in HP. Because Hidden Power Fire necessitates an IV of 30 in both Speed and Special Attack, an extra 4 EVs are required in both stats to max them out -- if you do not run Hidden Power Fire for whatever reason, you can add 72 EVs to Attack instead to gain an extra point there -- something you cannot do if you run Hidden Power Fire. A Hasty nature is used so as not to spoil the power of either offensive stat, though Treecko's defensive prowess is not spectacular regardless.</p> <p>The basic idea behind this set is to attempt to put your opponent to sleep with Grass Whistle, disabling one of your opponent's Pokemon and leaving you free to cause havoc with Treecko's attacking moves. If Treecko faces a Pokemon it can hopefully beat one-on-one, such as Kabuto, Onix, or Phanpy, the threat of a Grass-type attack will usually force the opponent to switch out. With luck, your opponent's Treecko counter will be forced to take the sleep, or else a very powerful Leaf Storm, while Treecko has the assurance of surviving the next attack thanks to Focus Sash. As for other move options, Endeavor can be useful alongside Quick Attack to strike down faster offensive leads that resist Grass or Fire, but due to the prevalence of Oran Berry and Treecko's excellent coverage on most leads, it is usually not worth the effort. Counter is another option that can work well against threats such as Meowth, but it is a free invitation for Ghost-types to come in for free and is illegal with Grass Whistle.</p> <p>Treecko is neither slow nor catastrophically frail, but it still leans some way towards both, making it less effective against certain foes. Meowth is top on the list of foes Treecko cannot beat, as it can take out Treecko without suffering a single hit with a combination of Fake Out + U-turn. Meowth hates having to deal with Rock-types such as Aron, who can set up Rock Polish if Meowth doesn't carry Hypnosis, as they resist its STAB and can exploit Meowth's hasty retreat to their own advantage. Houndour is another lead that Treecko has trouble with, as it resists both Leaf Storm and Hidden Power Fire. It also takes little damage from Quick Attack, and there is little real hope of ever hitting it with a Focus Punch, although you can catch it out if it tries to Sucker Punch as Treecko uses Grass Whistle. A Water-type that can take a Sucker Punch, such as Krabby, is a good answer if Houndour lacks Hidden Power Grass. Krabby can also deal with Bronzor leads if they prove troublesome.</p>"

However, Torchic does have decent attacking stats; this, combined with powerful STAB options, means Torchic is not as useless as it looks. Overall, Torchic is outclassed by other Fire-types such as Houndour and Ponyta, but is still a neat little Pokemon to use.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Torchic has access to stat boosting moves in Swords Dance and Agility, as well Baton Pass, but it is too frail to pull this off, even when dual screens are set up. Gligar also completely outclasses it as a stat booster due to more bulk, immunities to Electric- and Ground-type attacks, and the lack of a Stealth Rock weakness. A physical attacking set may be tempting, but the lack of a physical STAB attack and coverage moves is a letdown. Torchic has access to Return, but priority is generally more important than the extra power Return provides. Finally, Torchic has Counter, Will-O-Wisp, and Toxic, but is too frail to make good use of them.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Mantyke is a great counter, being able to switch into Fire Blast or Hidden Power Grass without fear thanks to its high Special Defense. Other Water-type Pokemon also do well, but must beware of Hidden Power Grass. Examples include Staryu and Chinchou, who can both switch in on Fire Blast and defeat Torchic with Hydro Pump. Diglett can trap Torchic with Arena Trap, but can't switch in on any attack, as even a Rock Slide followed by Quick Attack will deal plenty of damage to it (if not KO it outright). Finally, any Pokemon who can outspeed Torchic will fare quite well, as the Chick Pokemon will fall to almost any powerful hit.</p>",

      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This is the only set Torchic can run without being completely outclassed by its Fire-type rivals. Fire Blast is its main STAB move, dealing significant damage to any Pokemon who does not resist it. Overheat is also an option due to its extra power and accuracy, but has the negative effect of sharply lowering Torchic's Special Attack. Hidden Power Grass has decent coverage with Fire Blast, hitting Water-types such as Chinchou on the switch; additionally, it hits Rock-type Pokemon for super effective damage, preventing them from switching in freely. Rock Slide hits Flying-types such as Mantyke as well as other Fire-type Pokemon for super effective damage. Quick Attack provides Torchic with a way of picking off weakened Pokemon, and priority is always useful in a fast paced metagame such as Little Cup.</p> <p>A positive Speed nature is used because Torchic needs to outrun as many Pokemon as possible, while a Hasty nature doesn't hurt either of its offensive stats. Torchic should never sacrifice Special Attack EVs, as it will always benefit from the extra power from Fire Blast. The set's EV spread maximizes Special Attack and Speed, with the remainder going into Torchic's Attack and Special Defense stats. Stealth Rock support is extremely helpful for Torchic, punishing switch-ins while allowing the Chick Pokemon to damage its foes more easily. Rapid Spin support is also necessary, as it can remove Stealth Rock from the field, allowing Torchic to switch in much more easily.</p> <p>Chinchou is the best teammate for Torchic, as its unique typing makes it extremely effective at taking on Torchic's biggest counter: Mantyke. With resistances to Hydro Pump, Hidden Power Flying, and Ice Beam, as well as its STAB Thunderbolt, Chinchou is the best way to deal with Torchic's top counter. Bronzor is another decent teammate, as it resists Torchic's Rock-type weakness and can help it nab certain 2HKOs and OHKOs thanks to Stealth Rock.</p>"

Mudkip has a small movepool, but it can still threaten several Pokemon. It has access to uncommon moves such as Mirror Coat, Counter, and Curse, all of which have their own uses and surprise factor. Due to Mudkip's mixed stats it can function as a bulky Pokemon, or even a fully offensive sweeper. The flexibility in its role makes Mudkip a useful Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>A CounterCoat set can be viable with Mudkip, and so can a set utilizing Toxic and Rest. Yawn is a useful move to have in its arsenal as it causes switches and racks up damage from entry hazards. A specially based Choice Scarf set is viable, using moves such as Surf, Ice Beam, Ancient Power, and Hidden Power Fire, but Mudkip's Special Attack is mediocre, which limits its effectiveness. Its only real merit would be that it is unexpected.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Water Absorb Pokemon will be good counters since they can take Waterfall and receive a health boost. Chinchou resists STAB Waterfall and can retaliate with its own STAB Thunderbolt. Similarly, Grass-type Pokemon resists Mudkip's STAB and can deal a lot of damage to Mudkip with their own STABs. Be warned that Grass-types will take a lot of damage from Ice Beam if Mudkip has the move.

Waterfall is the main STAB option; it has 80 Base Power and a 20% flinch rate, which is handy because Mudkip will outspeed many opponents. Waterfall hits several threats such as Gligar, usually doing anywhere between 70% to 100%. Note that this isn't completely reliable, however, as many Gligar also carry Choice Scarf and will thus outspeed Mudkip. Double-Edge is a strong move and gets neutral coverage on every Pokemon in LC, while Return serves a similar purpose without the recoil damage at the cost of a bit less power. Superpower provides good coverage and it is useful in revenge killing several Pokemon. Ice Beam is useful as it hits more physically defensive Pokemon such as Gligar harder than Waterfall, and will usually KO them with Stealth Rock support. Rock Slide hits Ice- and Flying-type Pokemon for super effective damage, which is helpful in a metagame where Pokemon like Snover are common.</p> <p>Aqua Tail lacks accuracy, but as a trade-off has more power. Torrent is useful in boosting Mudkip's STAB even further in several situations where Mudkip's HP is below one-third. A Jolly nature is required to hit 21 Speed, a benchmark to Choice Scarf users to outspeed most other Pokemon. The specified EVs help maximize its Speed and Attack stats, while the remaining EVs are placed into HP to help it take hits slightly better.</p>"

Finally, Ralts can use Will-O-Wisp, which could be used to potentially cripple Pokemon like Munchlax.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Taunt users will force Ralts to Struggle or switch out, so Taunting Ralts is an effective strategy to neuter it. Entry hazards will break Ralts's Focus Sash and allow it to be OHKOed by almost any attack in Little Cup. Priority users can kill Ralts before it can use Memento or Destiny Bond.

If you lead with this set, or if you are able to keep entry hazards off of the field, then Ralts is guaranteed to set up Trick Room thanks to its Focus Sash. From there, Ralts can use Memento, Destiny Bond, or Encore to great effect, as it outspeeds almost every Pokemon in Little Cup under Trick Room. Memento will allow you to set up a very powerful Trick Room sweeper. If the opponent attacks, Ralts can use Destiny Bond to take the opponent down with it, thus scoring a free switch in for your Trick Room sweeper. Encore is there to make your opponent avoid using a non-attacking move, as doing so will also give you a free switch in for your Trick Room sweeper of choice.</p> <p>Ralts really has nothing else going for it, so this is all it has. Reflect and Light Screen could be used to support your team, but good luck finding time to use them. The IVs, EVs, and nature are all geared toward using Trick Room to its fullest extent.</p> <p>Ralts cannot function effectively without its Focus Sash. Therefore, if you are not using Ralts as a lead, it is necessary to use a Rapid Spinner or Taunter to prevent your opponent from setting up entry hazards on the field. Trick Room sweepers are obviously necessary to take advantage of the Trick Room that Ralts sets up, as it cannot do damage effectively by itself. Some examples of these sweepers are Cubone, Munchlax, and Clamperl.

If you're tired of the old Trick Room sweepers and want to try something new, Azurill can hit everything hard with only minor amounts of prediction. Nothing in Little Cup can survive two hits from Azurill.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Body Slam is a decent option, but the substantial power loss outweighs the paralysis rate. Knock Off can get rid of an opponent's item while doing semi-decent damage, especially to Ghost-types. Special attacks are largely pointless, as Return and Waterfall together grant enough power and coverage to make Hidden Power redundant. Sing is an option, but its low accuracy is off-putting. Azurill can also set up Rain Dance itself. It has some notable stat-reducing moves in Charm and Tickle, but it is usually better off doing as much damage as possible.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Azurill is a Normal-type with powerful Water-type attacks. This makes countering it directly quite difficult because one of its two attacks will hit your switch-in like a truck. Your best bet is to send in a Ghost-type or a Pokemon with a Water-type immunity and hope for the best.</p> <p>Revenge killing Azurill is fairly simple, however; most priority attacks will keep it in check. Croagunk has Vacuum Wave, which can easily finish off Azurill after Life Orb recoil. Munchlax or Trapinch built around Trick Room will also be slower than Azurill, allowing them to outpace it. If rain is up, Aqua Jet works pretty well. If Trick Room isn't active, nearly anything with decent offensive power that outspeeds Azurill will do the job.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Azurill has two useful attacks, given its stats: Return (or Double-Edge) and Waterfall. Thankfully, these moves together provide perfect neutral coverage and operate off of Azurill's massive 24 Attack.</p> <p>The choice between Return and Double-Edge comes down mostly to preference. Double-Edge has massive power, but destroys any chance at all of Azurill surviving any attack, even weak hits. Return has less power, but lets you conserve more of Azurill's HP. Ghost- and Steel-types that resist Azurill's chosen Normal-type attack are hit by Waterfall for massive damage. Iron Tail OHKOes all Lileep after Stealth Rock if Azurill is running Life Orb. Encore allows Azurill to punish those that try to use setup moves, letting it fire off a powerful attack without fear of retaliation. Substitute is a great choice for the last slot; the switches that Encore can force allow Azurill to safely set up a Substitute and proceed to KO the opponent's Pokemon at no risk to itself.</p> <p>Azurill really needs support to function. Trick Room and Rain Dance are both solid support options; with both up at once, Azurill becomes a monstrous beast that makes the most of its short lifespan. If your opponent does not have a Dry Skin / Water Absorb Pokemon and a Ghost-type, it will be difficult for them to address Azurill because they can't run down Azurill's timer with prediction. Therefore, in addition to Pokemon that can set up Trick Room, choose teammates that can get rid of Croagunk, the most common Pokemon with a Water-type immunity. Diglett can trap and KO Croagunk, but has to watch out for priority attacks. You will also want Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock to break an opponent's Focus Sash.</p> <p>Azurill is generally EV'd to have more Special Defense than Defense so that Porygon with Download always gets an Attack boost rather than a Special Attack boost. Azurill's defenses are paper-thin anyway, so this maximizes its competitive usefulness. Azurill is so slow that only Trick Room and paralysis serve it well, so there's little use in maxing out Speed. Azurill will outspeed Munchlax and Trapinch outside of Trick Room with 8 Speed instead of 6, but that's it.</p>"

Thanks to its relatively unique attribute allocation and move pool, Turtwig manages to be a stand-out amongst the pure Grass types of Little Cup. When compared to its fellow Grass-types, it plays well in Trick Room, lacks any real status options, has a significant physical move pool, and has access to a few unique moves like Earth Power and Stealth Rock. Whether or not its strengths are enough to merit it a slot on your team, however, is up for debate. Turtwig is incredibly slow, boasts no priority, and is easily taken out with super effective attacks or worn down over time by repeated assaults. Using Turtwig to the best of its abilities can be problematic, although it often manages to be decent competitor regardless.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Turtwig's physical options are limited at best and everything usable has already been covered above. For special attacking options, Turtwig could use Hidden Power Ice, Electric, or Psychic over Hidden Power Fire, in order to deal 4x damage to Gligar, Mantyke, or Croagunk, respectively.</p> <p>Turtwig's supporting move pool is excellent. Outside of the several supporting moves above, Turtwig has notable access to Leech Seed and Synthesis. Unfortunately, neither of these are useful enough to warrant a move slot. Leech Seed is probably the best option of the two, as it improves Turtwig's stalling power and allows it to force switches. Turtwig, though sturdy, just isn't bulky enough to use Synthesis effectively in the exceedingly offensive Little Cup metagame.</p> <p>Turtwig has plenty of set-up moves to offer in Amnesia, Curse, Growth, Swords Dance, Rain Dance, and Sunny Day. Unfortunately, sets utilizing Amnesia and Curse are generally too easy to take down before they accomplish anything significant. Sets running Growth or Swords Dance would also run into a similar issue and could only reach 13 Speed at best, which is very slow. Turtwig is easily outclassed by other Pokemon who can set up weather.</p> <p>Unfortunately, for Turtwig, three of its base stats end in 5, which limits the number of EVs it is able to effectively distribute. However, Turtwig's 64 Defense does grant it a Defense point with an investment of only four EVs. Being so slow, Turtwig is best off investing in HP and defenses on the defensive sets, and HP and its chosen attacking stat on the offensive sets. Defensive sets can choose between being mostly physically defensive, slightly physically defensive, balanced, or slightly specially defensive; just configure the EVs and nature according to what types of attacks you want Turtwig to take. If you have some EVs left over, keep in mind that Turtwig can invest 28 EVs in Speed to gain a +1 bonus, which is better than nothing and could assist it in outrunning other slow, bulky Pokemon such as Aron, Nosepass, and Shieldon. Turtwig's inability to reach 19 HP means that Life Orb will always do 2 damage to it; keep this in mind if you're using Life Orb.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>With the right move from the right set Turtwig is capable of hurting just about anything in Little Cup. This, however, is common in Little Cup and as such, Turtwig is perfectly counterable by a number of Pokemon. Bronzor is Turtwig's best switch-in as it resists most of its attacking moves and can deal with Crunch. It fares particularly well against the physical sets, although it would be wise to watch out for Hidden Power Fire. Against the physical sets, Gligar is an outstanding switch-in unless Turtwig is running Hidden Power Ice, and Turtwig lacks anything with which to significantly hurt Gligar. Gligar can in turn threaten Turtwig with STAB Aerial Ace, but an Aqua Tail/Earthquake Gligar cannot do much against Turtwig. Other Grass types, if they avoid Hidden Power Fire, only have Crunch to contend with. Faster Grass/Poison types with Sludge Bomb can often switch in fine and threaten Turtwig with an OHKO.</p> <p>Taunt can shut down a support Turtwig, as it stops any non-attacking moves. Considering how slow Turtwig is, landing a faster Taunt is easy for just about anything who knows the move. Also due to its low Speed, Turtwig is incredibly easy to revenge kill by anything faster with a powerful super-effective attack. Turtwig can be quite the threat under Trick Room. Pokemon who are even slower than Turtwig, like Munchlax and Trapinch, can attempt to hold it at bay or KO it by getting the initiative. Protect stalling also works quite well when applicable. Priority attacks other than Aqua Jet can also be great against a Trick Room Turtwig, as it lacks any priority whatsoever. Ice Shard works particularly well.</p>",

Protect is almost required to deal with Fake Out users, to scout, and to work against Explosions from the likes of Voltorb and Gastly, who are both common leads. Seed Bomb is Turtwig's most powerful STAB attack and primary means of causing damage. The fourth move is up for grabs, as Turtwig's coverage will be flawed either way. Crunch nails Gastly and Drifloon and is great for consistent, neutral coverage, whereas Superpower can be a surprise blow against certain leads that attempt to set up on you. The EVs provide Turtwig with strong durability and a free Speed point. Oran Berry adds extra bulk for Turtwig to take an extra hit or two and greatly increases this set's worth.</p> <p>Against Taunting leads, Turtwig should generally attack on the predicted Taunt, and save the ability to Protect for later. If the lead is, say, a Voltorb, one may save Turtwig from dying to an Explosion with a well-timed Protect instead of simply losing him and his potential Stealth Rock altogether. Against other bulky leads, unless Turtwig is capable of directly hurting them, it should just lay down use Stealth Rock and allow for a more directly threatening teammate to come in afterward.</p> <p>Keep in mind that Turtwig is not Superman, and that certain problem leads, like Houndour, are out there. Houndour, of course, is a threat to lead Turtwig and may be remedied by using a Houndour of your own with Flash Fire, or a Fire-type resist to take the attack. Chimchar, though uncommon, can also cause problems for Turtwig by using its Fire-type STAB. This can also be remedied by a Fire-type resist or immunity. Meowth also causes some problems, but all it can really do to hurt you is a super effective U-turn.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Although slow, bulky Choice Banders are rarely ideal in the Little Cup metagame, Turtwig is a fine choice for one nonetheless. Turtwig's stats and moves make it perfect for the job of a wallbreaker. Turtwig is slow, sturdy, strong, and blessed with an outstanding physical move pool for a Grass-type. Although bulky, it is still easily revenge killed. As such, Turtwig is best utilized as a team's wallbreaker; it hits just about anything hard if you predict correctly, and then goes down fighting. Considering the great coverage that its movepool provides, it is very capable of doing this effectively.</p> <p>Seed Bomb is a strong, reliable STAB attack for Turtwig to use as its main attack to rip holes with. The other moves help with coverage. Superpower hits just as hard as STAB Seed Bomb on a neutral hit and provides valuable Fighting coverage against Steel-types, while Crunch cripples any Ghost-types you'll encounter. In the fourth slot, Normal-type attacks provide excellent neutral coverage and Double-Edge is the stronger choice, and plays well with Turtwig's aforementioned role as team \"wrecking ball.\" However, without STAB, the difference in power between Return and Double-Edge is rarely significant, but the recoil can be. The above EVs provide Turtwig with max Attack and HP, with the remaining EVs going into the only areas they can round out: Speed and Defense.</p> <p>As mentioned above, this Turtwig can be easily revenge killed due to its pitiful Speed and inability to change attacks. The revenge killer will usually resist your Turtwig's attacks and threaten with a super-effective attack of its own. All you can do is predict that attack and switch out to a Pokemon with resistances to Turtwig's weaknesses. One example of a Pokemon with these resistances includes Munchlax, which effectively resists Fire- and Ice- type attacks thanks to Thick Fat. Fire-types like Magby, Houndour, and Cyndaquil also have great synergy with Turtwig, since they cover each others' most glaring weaknesses. All of these Pokemon can switch in on an Ice-, Fire-, or Bug-type attack aimed at Turtwig and threaten your opponent. Bronzor also makes a good partner with Turtwig, with resistances to Ice and Flying and an immunity to Poison.</p>"

Crunch allows Turtwig to hit Ghosts for super effective damage and Bronzor for neutral damage if you already have something to set Stealth Rock up. The given EVs are the same as on the Lead set, and for the same reasons; bulk is essential, and little else is useful anyway.</p> <p>Turtwig's role here is to set up in order for other Pokemon to sweep. Mantyke makes excellent use of screens, notably Reflect, and is resistant to Fire and neutral to Ice. Drifloon greatly appreciates screens, as it allows them to set up Calm Minds for a sweep. Gligar also benefits from screens greatly, going from bulky to nearly impenetrable.

Life Orb is a must on this set in order for Turtwig to hit as hard as possible.</p> <p>Seed Bomb is a strong and reliable STAB and is Turtwig's main move on this set.

Crunch, in the final slot, hits Ghosts such as Drifloon, Shuppet, and Gastly and has excellent neutral coverage.</p> <p>Having a good Pokemon to set up Trick Room is essential for optimal use of this set. Without Trick Room, this set pales in comparison to the Choice Band set, as it hits softer, is even slower, and is frailer. Some Pokemon who can help Turtwig out immensely by setting up Trick Room include Slowpoke, who resists both Fire- and Ice-type attacks and Bronzor who resists every one of Turtwig's weaknesses but Fire.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Although Chimchar has poor base stats, it can still act as a reliable lead. This comes from its unique ability to use both Fake Out and Stealth Rock on one set. Unfortunately, that is the extent of Chimchar's abilities, as it suffers from poor Speed and a reliance on Overheat to score important KOs. As a result of these drawbacks, Chimchar can be both easily revenge killed and set up on. Nonetheless, Chimchar is a solid lead, and can be quite disruptive when used correctly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Chimchar has access to both Swords Dance and Nasty Plot, along with a big enough movepool to support the two, allowing it to gain some much-needed punch for its attacks. Unfortunately, its Speed does not allow Chimchar to take full advantage of these boosts, since it can be easily revenge killed. To make up for its poor Speed, Chimchar can use a Choice Scarf along with U-turn for some scouting. Unfortunately, Chimchar is still quite weak and is easily set up on.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Faster Fake Out leads, such as Meowth, Aipom, and Glameow can all negate Chimchar's Focus Sash and proceed to KO it with a STAB attack. Diglett is a problem since it can negate Fake Out with Protect and OHKO Chimchar with Earthquake.</p> <p>Once Chimchar has done its job, a large amount of sweepers can set up on it, especially with its Special Attack drop. In particular, Dratini, Mantyke, Chinchou, and Gligar can take advantage of Overheat's Special Attack drop and set up on Chimchar with ease, while all packing moves that can easily take it out. Munchlax can easily sponge Chimchar's attacks and OHKO it with Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Chimchar is one of the better leads in the Little Cup metagame, due to the major centralization around the 15 Speed mark. With a Hasty nature, Chimchar outpaces other leads running 15 Speed and KOes most of them with Fake Out followed by Overheat or Hidden Power Grass. Because of this, it can prevent Stealth Rock from being set up without having to sacrifice a moveslot for Taunt, something no other lead can do. This gives Chimchar room for its own Stealth Rock, which it often gets the chance to use either after it KOes the opposing lead or if the opposing lead switches out. While Chimchar doesn't beat every lead, it will rarely be at a big disadvantage. Against Diglett, for example, it can still get Stealth Rock up and possibly disable Diglett's Focus Sash.</p> <p>As mentioned above, Chimchar is generally troubled by Diglett. This makes both Gastly and Gligar great partners for Chimchar, as either one can come in on the revenge kill and set up, quickly taking the momentum from the opponent. Chimchar also has trouble with Meowth, since it is faster and can use Fake Out to break Chimchar's Focus Sash. However, Meowth, unlike Diglett, does not prevent Chimchar from switching out. Therefore, Rock-type Pokemon such as Geodude and Rhyhorn also make great teammates for Chimchar, since they can easily switch into Meowth and hit the switch-in with a STAB Earthquake or Stone Edge. On the offensive side, Chimchar is a good partner to Pokemon who can take full advantage of Stealth Rock not being set up, such as Taillow.</p>"

  "Piplup": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Piplup has always been in the shadow of other Water-type Pokemon, due to his lack of priority moves, an Electric immunity, or a Ground immunity. However, Piplup's bulk and pure Water-typing give him an advantage over his aquatic friends. He can easily survive a Diglett's Earthquake (unlike Kabuto and Chinchou), as well as weak Hidden Powers. Piplup may have some flaws, but he can be surprisingly useful; one just needs to take advantage of his strengths.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Piplup's movepool is shallow, so he has very few options apart from the ones already listed. Still, he can run a few gimmicky sets to surprise the opponent. An Agility set could be used, but Piplup is generally outclassed by Chinchou, Mantyke, and Horsea in that area. A physical set could be used with moves such as Waterfall, Pluck, Drill Peck, Brick Break, and Rock Tomb to lure Munchlax, though Munchlax can still come out on top. A Rain Dance set could be used for support, as well as a Toxic + Protect one. On the support set, Feather Dance can be useful to stop physical attackers, such as Mankey, who can switch in on Yawn with impunity. Piplup can use Substitute to ease prediction and scout for status. Also, a Choice Scarf or Specs set is usable with Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, and Hidden Power, but again, this role is generally performed better by other bulky Waters, such as Chinchou and Mantyke.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Chinchou, Snover, and Munchlax are probably Piplup's greatest enemies. The first two can take a Hydro Pump and retaliate with a powerful STAB attack. Munchlax can also take a Hydro Pump (although Torrent- and Choice Specs-boosted attacks might leave a mark) and strike back with Return for a 2HKO. Various bulky Grass-types, such as Lileep and Shroomish, can come in on a Water-type attack or Hidden Power (although they have to be wary of Ice Beam) and strike back with a strong Seed Bomb or Energy Ball. Pokemon who are immune to Water-type attacks, such as Mantyke and Paras, can cause Piplup some problems. Most notably, Croagunk can easily come in on any of Piplup's attacks except Specs-boosted Ice Beam and KO him. Porygon can take an unboosted Hydro Pump or Surf and OHKO with Thunderbolt back. Faster Pokemon with a super effective attack, such as Gastly, Drifloon, Staryu, and Voltorb, can revenge kill Piplup.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Piplup's bulk, great typing, and access to Stealth Rock make him a great candidate in the lead position. He easily defeats Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon, which gives him a multitude of occasions on which to set up Stealth Rock. Icy Wind is essential to this set. It allows Piplup to break the opponent's Focus Sash on turn one. Then, thanks to Icy Wind's secondary effect of lowering the opponent's Speed, Piplup can outrun the opposing lead and set up Stealth Rock or simply KO the opposing Pokemon. This move is invaluable against leads relying on their Speed to be effective, such as Meowth, Diglett, and Chimchar.</p> <p>The choice between Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Grass is a tough one. Hidden Power Fire gives Piplup the upper hand against Snover, who can otherwise cause some problems, but then leaves him completely helpless against other Water Pokemon, such as Chinchou, Squirtle, Buizel, and Horsea. Hidden Power Grass can also be used to assure the OHKO on Kabuto, Omanyte, and Barboach.</p> <p>Maximum Speed and a Timid nature may seem odd for a support-inclined lead set, but the 14 Speed mark Piplup achieves is absolutely necessary. The Speed EVs allow Piplup to outspeed every Pokemon in LC, bar Choice Scarf users, after a Speed drop from Icy Wind. Apart from those important EVs, the spread is rather simple. Special Attack is maximized to get as much power as possible, while the remaining EVs are allocated to HP and Defense to increase Piplup's survivability. The item choice depends on whether you want Piplup to have more survivability or a better match-up against faster leads who might OHKO Piplup. For example, Diglett will be able to 2HKO Piplup if he isn't holding an Oran Berry. The same goes for Gligar holding a Focus Sash. For these reasons, Oran Berry is the preferred option. With Focus Sash, however, Piplup will be able to survive attacks from faster leads, such as Voltorb and Gastly, giving him the chance to use Icy Wind or to simply use Hydro Pump right away for the KO.</p> <p>Piplup has problems with Snover unless he is running Hidden Power Fire and Snover is not holding a Focus Sash (which is an unlikely scenario). Therefore, it would be a great idea for you to have a good Snover counter. Fire-types, such as Ponyta and Magby, make great candidates for this role, as they can switch in on Snover's STAB attacks and retaliate with Overheat or Flare Blitz. Bronzor also comes to mind, as it can easily switch into Snover and threaten him with Gyro Ball.</p> <p>Since Munchlax is one of Piplup's greatest counters, Pokemon able to take him out quickly are very useful to the blue penguin. Diglett, Trapinch, and Wynaut are able to trap and KO him easily. Strong physical attackers, such as Mankey and Machop, can also defeat Munchlax with ease. Drifloon and Duskull have enough bulk to survive multiple Pursuits and can come in on a Return or Earthquake from Munchlax and burn him. Bulky Waters can also give Piplup trouble. The best example is Chinchou, who can easily come in on a Surf or Hydro Pump and threaten Piplup with Thunderbolt. Diglett can come in on a Thunderbolt and defeat Chinchou with Earthquake. Wynaut can trap opponents with his Shadow Tag ability and OHKO them with Mirror Coat.</p>"

      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Piplup has great bulk and a good defensive typing, which gives him a lot of opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. He also has a wide support movepool, making him a great choice for such a role in Little Cup. The primary advantage of having Piplup as a support Pokemon is that he is not only able to set up Stealth Rock, but also able to counter Rain Dance sweepers, a great threat in the Little Cup metagame. Mantyke without a Life Orb will be unable to OHKO Piplup with a rain-boosted Surf or super effective Hidden Power, and Buizel's Return will also fail to KO Piplup. Other Swift Swimmers, such as Surskit, non-Life Orb Horsea, Omanyte, Kabuto, and Goldeen, will be stopped cold by Piplup's incredible bulk. However, repeated assault from the aforementioned threats will wear Piplup down.</p> <p>Even though Stealth Rock isn't as important in Little Cup as it is in the OU metagame, it is still helpful in checking Little Cup's omnipresent Choice Scarf users. It reduces the lifespan of threats such as Mantyke and Snover, as well as negating the effects of Focus Sash. However, what makes Piplup such a good user of Stealth Rock is the ability to abuse it with Yawn. Yawn is extremely useful in the Little Cup metagame because it forces switches, racking up residual damage from Stealth Rock and scouting the opposing team. Surf is there for a consistent STAB attack, although its damage output is low due to the lack of Special Attack EVs on this set. In the second slot, Hidden Power Electric is preferable to handle Swift Swimmers who will otherwise easily defeat Piplup, but Ice Beam can handle Grass-types, such as Shroomish and Paras.</p> <p>The bulky EV spread maximizes Piplup's survivability. With the specified EVs, Piplup can survive two Rock Slides from Kabuto leads (three with an Oran Berry). The EVs also allow Piplup to easily survive unboosted super effective Hidden Powers from the likes of Mantyke, Horsea, and Surskit, as well as Omanyte's Ancient Power and Buizel's Return. Oran Berry is by far the preferable item to increase Piplup's lifespan. It also allows Piplup to transform many opponent's 2HKOs into 3HKOs, thus giving you a great advantage over the enemy.</p> <p>Pairing Piplup with Pokemon able to set up Spikes (Pineco and Omanyte come to mind) is a great idea to take advantage of the switches provoked by Yawn. Also, priority users, such as Croagunk, can easily take advantage of a team weakened by entry hazards. Setup sweepers, such as Dratini, Aron, and Totodile, are very useful when it is time to take advantage of a free turn provided by Yawn, and could easily spell death to the rest of the opponent's team. On a more defensive note, having a Pokemon who can easily switch into Electric and Grass attacks is really useful to Piplup. Shroomish is thus a great partner, because he complements Piplup defensively, and can set up on Electric- or Grass-type moves aimed at the miniature penguin.</p> <p>Grass-types, such as Bulbasaur, Lileep, Paras, Bellsprout, and Shroomish, all give Piplup a hard time. Doduo can switch in on a Sleep Powder (hoping to wake up quickly with Early Bird) or Grass-type attacks without fear and threaten with Brave Bird or Drill Peck, while Mankey can switch on sleep moves with impunity (thanks to his ability, Vital Spirit) and U-turn away to scout. As mentioned earlier, another threat to Piplup in the lead position is Snover. Without Hidden Power Fire, Piplup is helpless against him. Magnemite can abuse its resistances by taking a Blizzard or Energy Ball from Snover and retaliate with Flash Cannon. Speaking of resistances, Shieldon is a great way to stop Snover, taking little damage from almost anything the frozen tree can throw at him and striking back with Stone Edge and Iron Head. Various Fire-types, such as Magby and Houndour, can come in on his STAB attacks and retaliate with a Fire attack. Makuhita can also take a Blizzard if he runs Thick Fat and fight back with Brick Break or Cross Chop.</p>"

But what allows Starly to be of any use in a Little Cup battle is access to two powerful STAB moves, Brave Bird and Double-Edge, that makes Starly a reasonable threat if given the proper support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Starly's movepool doesn't contain many other options, though a set revolving around Agility can be used to remedy Starly's Speed; however, due to its meager defenses, this is not recommended. Similarly, a Tailwind or Feather Dance set can be adopted, though the chances of these sets succeeding are very low indeed. Also, a set using a Liechi or Salac Berry can be used, due to the recoil from Starly's STABs, but often Starly will be out of the skies before it can even start to sweep.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Like all other Flying-types, Stealth Rock is Starly's bane; Starly can usually only switch in twice when Stealth Rock is up, after factoring in recoil from its STABs. Bronzor, Geodude, and Aron among others are excellent counters, as they all resist Starly's STABs and can switch in and start to set up immediately. Naturally, Pokemon that outpace Starly are also great counters, as even their weakest attacks will inflict good damage against Starly's weak defenses.

The EVs given maximize Starly's Attack and Speed with a Naive nature, while the rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Attack to give Heat Wave a small power-up. Brave Bird and Double-Edge serve as Starly's STAB attacks, while Heat Wave and U-turn are used for coverage; the former hits Steel-types, and the latter is used for scouting. If you feel wary about the massive recoil Starly will take from its STABs, Pluck can be used instead of Brave Bird as a recoil-free alternative. Pluck also allows Starly to steal Oran Berries from opponents to recover HP lost from Double-Edge. Also, if you want to be able to trap Ghost- and Psychic-types, Pursuit can be used over Heat Wave; if this decision is made, it will be beneficial to change the EV spread and nature to ones that benefit exclusively the Attack stat.</p>"

In addition, it has a low Defense stat, and with priority moves such as Sucker Punch everywhere, Mime Jr. can be easily revenge killed.

Pokemon that can set up hazards such as Stealth Rock are helpful; a good Pokemon who can do this would be Sandshrew, who resists Rock, can fall back to Wingull for its Water-type weakness, and can also Rapid Spin away entry hazards such as Stealth Rock from your side of the field.</p>"

    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Burmy carries on Game Freak's legacy of impeccable Bug-types. However, Burmy introduced a few new things to this line of outstanding insects. Firstly, Burmy was the first Pokemon in this group to be given Bug Bite, while less appealing Bug-types, such as Weedle, Caterpie, and Wurmple, can't do anything original and had to copy Burmy. Secondly, Burmy is the definition of unique, with three alternate formes to differentiate itself from its fellow Bug-types while not at all changing its impressive battling tactics. Unlike other inferior Bugs, Burmy has access to Shed Skin, allowing it to wall and counter Pokemon such as Slowpoke and Baltoy who rely on Toxic to deal damage and are absolutely demolished by its ferocious Bug Bite. Despite having a relatively shallow movepool, Burmy has access to all it needs with Bug Bite, Hidden Power Ice, and Tackle hitting most of Little Cup for neutral damage. Burmy has, without a doubt, knocked Caterpie, Weedle, and Wurmple right off their pedestal and the usage statistics chart for good.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Burmy has access to Tackle which can be used over Bug Bite to conserve PP. This is important because Burmy's incredible stalling skills often force it to run out of PP and take nasty recoil from Struggle. Burmy also has three cool formes, so use whichever forme you think looks coolest!</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Nothing really outright counters Burmy, except maybe Weedle, Ledyba, and Pidgey. If you can get them in safely and avoid String Shot, they may have a chance to take down the tanking beast. Otherwise, good luck to you.</p>",

      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its phenomenal defenses, Burmy can tank hits from just about any Pokemon in LC. Its Bug typing leaves Burmy with only three weaknesses and useful resistances to common attacking types such as Grass. Bug Bite will be Burmy's main method of dealing damage, allowing it to always OHKO 0 HP / 0 Defense Abra. Burmy also has access to the mighty String Shot, allowing it to slow down any switch-in and eat it alive with Bug Bite. String Shot also makes Burmy a great team player, allowing it to slow down fast opponents so Burmy's slower teammates can come in and continue to wreak havoc. Protect is another excellent move and allows Burmy to scout opponent's movesets, particularly those of Taillow and Ponyta, while they fail to touch this defense fortress. Using Hidden Power Ice means Burmy is able to hit Gligar extremely hard; even with no Special Attack EVs, Burmy always 2HKOes 156 HP / 76 SpD Gligar with its powerful chill.</p> <p>To showcase Burmy's offensive prowess, take a look at the following damage calculations with the current EV spread and nature:</p> <ul> <li>Bug Bite vs. 0/0 Abra 105.2% - 136.8%</li> <li>Bug Bite vs. 0/0 Carvanha 95.2% - 128.2%</li> <li>Bug Bite vs. 36/236 Slowpoke 46.1% - 53.8%</li> <li>Bug Bite vs. 220/152+ Bronzor 24% - 28%</li> <li>Hidden Power Ice vs. 156/76 Gligar 64% - 80%</li> <li>Hidden Power Ice vs. 0/0 Taillow 50% - 70%</li> <li>Hidden Power Ice vs. 0/0 Dratini 50% - 60%</li> </ul> <p>As a natural tank and staller, Burmy benefits from Toxic Spikes support. Despite a lack of recovery, Burmy's Bug Bite will often heal it due to the plethora of Oran Berries in LC; however, having Wish support from a sturdy Pokemon such as Lickitung still helps Burmy stay in longer. Burmy also has access to Tackle, which hits Weedle harder, but Burmy will usually lose to Weedle either way due the fact that Weedle 4x resists Bug. If your team has problems with any certain Pokemon who Burmy can pick out and defeat, a custom type of Hidden Power can be used to crush them.</p> <p>Machop is a great teammate; without Psychic-types in the way, it can smash teams into bits. Burmy can slow down any Ghost-type with String Shot, allowing Machop to come in and demolish them with Payback. Diglett can easily remove Fire- and Steel-types in Burmy's way, and can set up Stealth Rock, which is a huge boon as Burmy causes many switches. Likewise, Spikes support will damage your opponent on every switch-in, aiding Burmy's sweep. Pineco, Burmy's fellow Bug friend, will be able to set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes as well spin away Stealth Rock which is usually a burden on our bag worm. Geodude and Rhyhorn resist all of Burmy's weaknesses and can set up Stealth Rock or demolish opposing teams with String Shot support.</p>"

    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>On one hand, Trapinch possesses impressive Attack and an excellent ability in Arena Trap; on the other hand, its Speed is abysmal and it's unable to take hits at all. Given all this, there's really only one way for Trapinch to shine: inside of Trick Room. Under its effects, Trapinch essentially becomes Diglett on steroids, trapping foes and easily KOing with its powerful attacks. Despite a fundamentally shallow movepool, this humble little termite can be a real force to be reckoned with under the right conditions, and makes an excellent offensive addition to any Trick Room team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Substitute is useful as an added buffer to extend Trapinch's sweep beyond the duration of Trick Room, but it can be difficult to set up since Arena Trap prevents the switches that would normally be Trapinch's opening to do so. Your only hope of getting a Substitute up is dependent upon your opponent using a non-attacking move (such as Protect, which your opponents can and will use to stall out your Trick Room turns if they have it available). Flail is an option that can be run on sets that don't use Life Orb, but it is illegal with Quick Attack, which you'll almost always want instead.</p> <p>Choice Band was not mentioned, but it shows some promise, since Arena Trap negates the need to predict switches. A Banded Trapinch can switch in on Choice-locked Electric-type attacks with impunity, and the Attack boost also makes Quick Attack that much more potent; it also makes Trapinch much more vulnerable to Gastly and Mantyke switch-ins, however, who will use the opening to set up a sweep and start pummeling Trapinch.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>The most significant threat to Trapinch's sweep is strong, super effective priority. Carvanha is particularly scary, packing one of the most powerful Aqua Jets in Little Cup, capable of OHKOing Trapinch. Totodile will also OHKO Trapinch, even with an unboosted Aqua Jet. Squirtle can tank Trapinch's hits and 2HKO with Aqua Jet easily. Snover's Ice Shard will fall just short of the OHKO, but Life Orb recoil from Quick Attack + Bug Bite or Rock Slide will ensure Trapinch's demise. Croagunk, Stunky, and Houndour, while weak to Earthquake, can easily pick off a weakened Trapinch with Sucker Punch outside of Trick Room. If Trapinch is ever going up against any of these Pokemon, it needs to have them in KO range of its Quick Attack while in Trick Room if it wants to come out on top.</p> <p>Other threats that Trapinch will have problems with are bulky Pokemon that it can't hit super effectively, namely Gligar and Bronzor. Even non-defensive Gligar aren't bothered by any of Trapinch's moves, except for Bug Bite, which only provides an annoyance to variants packing Oran Berry. In return, Gligar can easily wipe out Trapinch with Aqua Tail. Bronzor can be handled a bit more easily with Crunch and Bug Bite, but it never goes down easily and can usually deal some crippling damage if it packs offensive moves.</p> <p>Inside of Trick Room, Trapinch has some speed issues with a few key foes. Munchlax is a pretty serious threat; any variants that run a Speed-hindering nature will Speed tie with Trapinch, and said Munchlax with 0 Speed IVs will always outspeed Trapinch in Trick Room and can land a solid 2HKO with Return against a fully healthy Trapinch. Minimum Speed Slowpoke will also Speed tie with Trapinch, and can threaten it with STAB Surf or Aqua Tail. The only other Pokemon slow enough to Speed tie is minimum Speed Bonsly; though rarely seen, it still poses a threat with Sucker Punch and Explosion.</p>",

      "Trick Room Trapper": {
        "description": "<p>The only way to use Trapinch effectively is with the effects of Trick Room in play. The vital tools in Trapinch's arsenal are Earthquake, Crunch, and Quick Attack, giving it a strong STAB, a way to deal with Levitating Ghosts, and an answer to opposing priority, respectively. With the given moves and stat spread, Trapinch has a few key advantages over its rival Ground-type Trick Room sweeper, Cubone: the ability to keep opponents from switching with Arena Trap, a lower minimum Speed stat, allowing it to outspeed everything but Munchlax and tie with minimum-Speed Slowpoke, and access to a priority attack, making it harder to revenge-kill when Trick Room has expired.</p> <p>Trapinch's last moveslot comes down to a number of filler options. Bug Bite is probably the best of these, as it deprives the likes of Wynaut, Paras, Bronzor, and Munchlax of their Oran Berry while giving Trapinch a somewhat-reliable means of recovery. A combination of Bug Bite and Quick Attack also allows Trapinch to beat Oran Berry Snover one-on-one, something it cannot accomplish otherwise. On the other hand, Rock Slide complements Trapinch's Ground-type STAB very well, and allows Trapinch to beat common Flying-types, most notably Mantyke.</p> <p>The EVs listed max out Trapinch's Attack stat and give two extra points in each defense stat, while the IV spread minimizes Life Orb recoil and maximizes Trapinch's Speed under Trick Room. If you opt for an item other than Life Orb, an alternative EV spread of 156 HP / 196 Atk / 76 Def / 76 SpD with full HP IVs can be used.</p>"

    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Weedle boasts the prestigious \"Smallest Movepool in all of Little Cup\" award, trumping even Caterpie, Burmy, and the fearsome Magikarp with its minuteness. Utilizing its amazingly concise movepool, Weedle can act as an extreme nuisance to the other team, eating all Oran Berries in its path, poisoning unsuspecting victims who switch in thinking they can forge through a powerful Poison Sting, and crippling opposing sweepers with a tactical String Shot. Furthermore, Weedle has the highest Attack stat out of all the aforementioned limited-movepool behemoths, making it even more of a superior choice when considering one of the four for your team. However, it's not all rainbows and butterflies for Weedle (well, rainbows and bees I guess). Weedle is faced with fearsome competition, having to differentiate itself from hailed sweepers like Gligar, who is also able to learn Poison Sting, making it quite the rival for a team slot. When considering putting Weedle on your team, you must be sure to utilize its advantages over other Pokemon, mainly String Shot, Bug Bite, and Poison Sting. Although many other Pokemon learn these moves, I guarantee you that you will more than likely only see this potent combination on Weedle as they are the most effective moves he has.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>In terms of moves, Weedle has none, due to it only having three moves in its entire arsenal. Weedle can be used in a Trick Room team with the Speed EVs moved to Special Defense with a Brave nature, although it isn't recommended as it interferes with the String Shot strategy. Weedle can also run a Choice Band set consisting solely of Poison Sting and Bug Bite, but it generally enjoys the freedom of switching moves.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>There are very few Pokemon in the entire metagame that can boast being the perfect Weedle counter due to the side effects of Weedle's moves. Although almost every Pokemon in the metagame has the potential to do well against Weedle, they must be wary of losing their Berry, becoming crippled with poison, or being afflicted by the Speed-lowering effect of String Shot. Although Weedle boasts excellent defensive and offensive stats, it still has trouble dealing with Pokemon like Combee, who are simultaneously defensive bastions and offensive powerhouses in their own right; be careful, as they have the potential to brave through Weedle's destruction if they lack a consumable item or are immune to poison. A good example of such a fiendish adversary is Gligar, who resists both of Weedle's STAB attacks, outspeeds Weedle even after a String Shot, and has decent offensive stats to eliminate Weedle. Life Orb variants certainly don't mind Weedle's Bug Bite, but they still despise the extra passive poison damage. Fire-type Pokemon also do well against Weedle's onslaught, being able to switch in on a Bug Bite and OHKO Weedle with a STAB move; examples include Ponyta and Growlithe, who can defeat Weedle with Flare Blitz. Bronzor is the ultimate bane of Weedle's existence, being immune to poison and having access to Recycle, which can stop a Weedle sweep cold.</p>",

Weedle doesn't even need four moves, as it is able to pose an extremely moderate threat with this holy trinity of moves alone. Bug Bite is Weedle's strongest STAB attack, and will hurt most Pokemon more than any of its other attacks. Not even Pokemon that resist Bug Bite can switch in safely for fear of losing their precious Oran Berry. The fact that Weedle is fairly uncommon also helps, since opposing walls that switch in won't be aware of the potential loss of their Berry. It should be noted that Bug Bite can 6HKO Aron (5HKO with Choice Band), an impressive feat. Poison Sting is for secondary STAB, but is considerably weaker than Bug Bite. However there is one reason and one reason alone that warrants its use and that is poison. Just watch as your opponent winces in rage and cries in fear when their precious Weedle check becomes crippled with the bane that is regular poison, causing them to lose a full 12.5% of their health every single turn. Finally, String Shot allows Weedle to outspeed all Pokemon below 17 Speed after a single String Shot, allowing it to strike first or set up an essential sweep for a teammate (unless the opponent switches out of course).</p> <p>Life Orb allows Weedle to deal heavy damage to even foes that resist its attacks, dealing a solid 12% to defensive Gligar with Bug Bite; however Oran Berry is an option to prolong Weedle's rampage. Choice Band boosts Weedle's Attack, allowing it to really put the hurt on opponents. However, locking itself into String Shot is not a good idea. Adamant nature allows Weedle to destroy its enemies, while lowering its Special Attack which is merely a pittance in comparison to boosting Weedle's titanic base 35 Attack stat. The EV spread maximizes Weedle's HP and Attack, while increasing its Defense and Speed by one point. With the extra point in Speed, Weedle hits 12 Speed, allowing it to blaze past even more Pokemon before and after a String Shot.</p> <p>Weedle appreciates the company of Rapid Spinners that can get rid of entry hazards, which are hazardous to Weedle due to its vulnerability to Stealth Rock and Spikes. A good Rapid Spinning slave that Weedle can abuse is Sandshrew, who can Rapid Spin away any entry hazards, while also being able to set up its own in the form of Stealth Rock, which can also benefit Weedle. Sandshrew can also learn the fearsome Poison Sting, which can assist Weedle in spreading deadly regular poison throughout the opponent's team, while getting rid of Poison and Steel-type adversaries with powerful Earthquakes or Digs. Wynaut is arguably the best teammate, being able to Encore a move that Weedle resists, allowing Weedle to come in without being 2HKOed and start its assault. Wynaut can also eliminate the select Pokemon that Weedle has trouble with by using Counter or Mirror Coat.</p>"

It is a little energetic rat that made a name for itself as one of the most fun gimmicks of early DP, the F.E.A.R. set (which stands for Focus Sash, Endeavor, (Quick) Attack, Rattata). Since then it hasn't seen as much love, especially considering how much better the Clefairy line is at that set. However, this lack of love is unfounded as Rattata has some tricks up those little purple sleeves. Rattata has an excellent ability and some nice Egg moves, enabling it to help out teams that need a bit more fun, while still getting the job done.</p> <p>Sadly for Rattata, it is almost entirely outclassed in almost all areas by other Pokemon; however, in every case it has some quirk that makes sure it isn't totally left behind, sometimes even being a better choice than the more popular and well-known option. Taillow, Stunky, and Munchlax better move over, Rattata is in the building.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Most of Rattata's best options have already been mentioned. Rattata has a fairly extensive special movepool but for the most part Rattata's poor Special Attack stat of 25 is too low to be useful. Blizzard or Ice Beam is the only move with a possibility of being useful to hit Gligar switching in; however, that is a gimmick at best. On the physical side, Rattata can fill a offensive support role with Taunt and Super Fang to mess with walls, but again there are better Pokemon for the job in almost every case.</p> <p>You may wish to run either Pluck or Zen Headbutt. Both are situational but can prove useful. Pluck can steal the opponent's pinch or Oran Berries if you are lucky. Zen Headbutt is Rattata's strongest move against Koffing, and is also a good option to hit the common Fighting-type priority abuse Pokemon switching in, notably Croagunk, for larger amounts of damage. Rattata is infamous for its F.E.A.R. set in higher tiers and can attempt to pull off such a set in LC. Reliable priority in the form of Quick Attack makes such a set possible for the more ballsy battlers that play Little Cup. Another gimmick set it can run is one consisting of Substitute + Pinch Berry + Reversal. Another point to note is that any set you do decide to use can run Facade. A lot of teams run Will-O-Wisp, and abusing that fact with Guts is always a good way to make the best of a bad situation.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Rock-types have been mentioned as problems for Rattata. Good choices include Onix, Rhyhorn, Geodude, Omanyte, and even Nosepass. All of them have high Defense and are resistant to Rattata's STAB. Rattata has paper defenses so any strong attack from any one of them will ruin it. Other walls that give Rattata a hard time include Gligar, Koffing, and Shellder. Gligar can set up and sweep, Koffing can wall Rattata but needs to be careful not to give it a free Guts boost with Will-O-Wisp, and Shellder and easily take Rattata out with a Choice Scarf STAB move. Rattata also won't like taking Fighting-type priority attacks from the likes of Croagunk or Riolu either. Any strong and faster priority will suffice, as it is likely that Rattata will have taken previous damage through either recoil or status, making Elekid and Dratini good choices as well.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Rattata makes a decent revenge killer thanks to its access to STAB priority in addition to access to Sucker Punch. There are obviously other Pokemon that look better on paper, but none of them have the added ability to take on some Steel-types, which Rattata can do with Flame Wheel. This point in itself is enough reason to consider Rattata for a place on your team.</p> <p>The choice of moves depends on what you want Rattata to do. Pursuit is the best option to make the most of Rattata's typing and to give it something over some of the other revenge killers that may be vying for the spot. It is also the best counter around to Will-O-Wisp Gastly, or any Ghost-type that uses that move. For example, a Duskull takes 14 damage minimum from Pursuit even when it doesn't switch out after a Guts boost. U-turn is also a good choice as it can also help support the team. A fast U-turn is always useful to bring a teammate in for whatever your opponent chooses to switch into Rattata. Both of these moves make the most of an opponent's switching, so the choice is up to you.</p> <p>The last slot is mainly reserved for taking on slower, healthier threats. Slow and bulky Pokemon take a chunk of damage from a strong, STAB-boosted Return. Flame Wheel is also an option thanks to its ability to not leave Rattata completely helpless against Steel-types as well as taking out slow Grass-types. Of course, whichever move you don't use in the third slot can also go in this slot if that is what your team needs.</p> <p>Normal has good type coverage overall, being ineffective only against Steel-, Rock-, and Ghost-types. Coupled with Rattata's other moves, this means that the only type of Pokemon Rattata will have difficulty revenge killing are Rock-types. For this reason it is good to partner Rattata with a strong Fighting-type priority user like Croagunk who, alongside Rattata, can revenge kill most threats your team will come up against. Croagunk also has the added benefit of resisting Fighting-type moves aimed at Rattata.</p> <p>Another good partner to consider is Baltoy. Baltoy resists Fighting-type attacks, while Rattata is immune to Ghost-type attacks and can punish their STAB users with Pursuit. As a Pokemon that will be switching in and out a lot, Rattata really enjoys Rapid Spin support, which Baltoy can provide. Baltoy also has the quirk of being able to switch into entry hazards with little damage thanks to its Stealth Rock resistance and Spikes immunity.</p> <p>Rattata also has the ability to beat some of the deadly Choice Scarf users that other priority revenge killers have difficulties with, namely Gastly, thanks to Sucker Punch. Alternatively, if Gastly is locked into Shadow Ball, Rattata can take it out of the game with Pursuit. The same process works with other Ghost-types as Rattata is the only viable Pursuit user that benefits from the ever common Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

However, it has a higher Attack stat than Quick Feet Teddiursa after Guts, and also has a few quirks that give it the edge over the other Pokemon you might be considering to fill this role on your team.</p> <p>The Normal / Dark combination is a staple on many Normal-type Little Cup sweepers such as Munchlax and Eevee, and Rattata is no exception to the rule. With access to a very good STAB in the form of Facade, Sucker Punch, and extra coverage moves, Rattata is a Pokemon to fear.</p> <p>Toxic Orb is the item of choice for two reasons. Firstly, it is unrealistic to assume that there is a good chance of Rattata being statused spontaneously, due to the lower amount of status used in Little Cup than in most other tiers. Secondly, in the fast-paced metagame that is Little Cup, Rattata is unlikely to be alive for very long and Toxic Orb results in the least amount of health lost over the first three turns, which is about Rattata's lifespan in most situations.</p> <p>The choice between the last two moves determines how you will play Rattata. If you run Quick Attack, Rattata can then function as a back-up revenge killer, and it is always useful to have priority in Little Cup. Protect lets you bring Rattata in after one of your Pokemon has fainted and enables Rattata to activate Guts without any harm. U-turn lets Rattata work as a pseudo-scout and can be useful in letting your team trap Rock-types who your team can then use to set up on. Therefore if you are using U-turn it is useful to have a Pokemon that can set-up on Rock-types, such as dual screen Bronzor and even Rock Polish Aron. Crunch gives a more reliable option to hit slower Pokemon such as Bronzor and Duskull, who may try to stall you out until you die due to status. Flame Wheel is also a reasonable option to hit Steel-type switch-ins.</p>"

Overall, Spearow is a Pokemon that should not be underestimated, because with the given support, Spearow can really punch holes in the opponent's team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Sadly, Spearow does not have much other options that it can make good use of. Steel Wing is an option to hurt Rock-types but has poor utility otherwise. Pursuit can be used to guarantee a kill on a weakened Pokemon. Assurance pairs well with entry hazards, dealing double the damage to Pokemon that switch in. Rain Dance or Sunny Day can be used on Spearow thanks to its above-average 70 base Speed, as well as having U-turn to immediately switch to a sweeper. However, Spearow is better off just hitting as hard as it can. Lastly, Mirror Move is an option, as Spearow can switch into Aron or Rhyhorn on a predicted Earthquake, then use Mirror Move to knock them out, but is not recommended because of its unreliability.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Pokemon with decent priority moves can beat Spearow. Fake Out from the likes of Aipom, Meowth, and Croagunk, hurts Spearow quite a lot. Choice Band Eevee can almost always knock out Spearow with Quick Attack if it has switched into Stealth Rock once. However, Spearow may have Quick Attack to counter the opposing Pokemon if they are weakened. Ghost-types such as Gastly can switch in on a predicted Choice-locked Normal-type move, and set up a Substitute before proceeding to hit Spearow's team with powerful attacks. Aron walls Spearow completely, and Rock-types such as Onix, Geodude, and Rhyhorn take very little damage from Spearow's attacks, but all of these counters must beware of U-turn, because Spearow can use it to switch to an appropriate counter.</p>",

Heat Wave allows Spearow to hit Steel-types that resist Return and Drill Peck for decent damage, despite its low Special Attack.

Return gives Spearow a powerful STAB move to use, and Heat Wave allows Spearow to hit Steel-types that would otherwise wall this set.</p> <p>Like the Choice set, Spearow appreciates entry hazard support, since it often finds that it just does not have enough power to knock out walls. Phanpy, although weak to Ice-type attacks, resists Rock-type attacks and is immune to Electric-type attacks, meaning that Phanpy can easily switch in to set up Stealth Rock. Like the previous set, the EV spread allows Spearow to reach its maximum potential by maxing Attack and Speed. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense and Special Attack, increasing each stat by one point. No HP EVs are used, along with a 0 HP IV, so that Spearow reaches 19 HP in order for Life Orb's recoil to deal only one damage to Spearow</p>"

  "Ekans": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Life can be tough for Ekans. It has two amazing abilities, Intimidate and Shed Skin, and a great physical movepool. However, it has fairly poor stats that hold it back from being truly amazing. Despite this, if played to its strengths, Ekans can be a decent Pokemon. Intimidate can make almost any physical sweeper think about switching out, and Glare can guarantee they are going to be punished if they stay in as well. As a bonus, thanks to Intimidate and being Poison-type, Ekans can stop Choice Scarf Mankey and Machop in their tracks. Basically, play to these strengths, and Ekans can be an asset to any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Ekans has a number of decent options outside of those listed. Seed Bomb hits Rock/Ground- and Rock/Water-types hard, and is a viable choice over either Earthquake or Aqua Tail. Rock Slide has great coverage with Earthquake, and is a viable replacement for Bite on the Choice sets. It also creates the often annoying paraflinch combination on the Glare set. Beat Up is moderately effective, but Ekans has neither the Speed nor the Attack to take full advantage of it. Pursuit is an option to hit fleeing opponents, and can be used as a substitute for Bite. Double-Edge is an option because it hits as hard as super effective Bite and STAB Poison Jab. It does, however, come with recoil damage, which can greatly lower Ekans's survivability.</p> <p>Dark Pulse, Sludge Bomb, Giga Drain and Hidden Power allow Ekans to pull together a Choice Specs set, but with its low Special Attack, it's hardly worth it. Hidden Power Ice, however, can be used to hit Gligar for 4x super effective damage, which will inflict heavy damage regardless of investment.</p> <p>Rest is an option to complement Ekans's second ability, Shed Skin, but it is unreliable and Ekans's defenses are rather shaky. Speaking of Shed Skin, it is also a decent substitute for Intimidate on the Choice set, since it can remove crippling status that would otherwise make Ekans useless, such as paralysis. Stockpile can be used to bolster Ekans's defenses, but is very gimmicky and not recommended.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>For the Choice set, prediction is the best counter. Gligar can switch in on Poison Jab, Gunk Shot, or Earthquake, and hit back with a powerful STAB Earthquake. Bronzor can do the same, and takes less damage from Aqua Tail. It can also hit with super effective STAB Psychics or Earthquake as well. Croagunk can take Poison Jab and Payback well, and restores HP from Aqua Tail. It can then proceed to hit it with Earthquake or Hidden Power Psychic.</p> <p>The Glare set is tricky to switch into, because no Pokemon will like being paralyzed. If you have a Pokemon such as Taillow or Teddiursa who already is burned or poisoned, they can safely switch in on Glare and hit with STAB Facade for an OHKO. Glameow can switch in without fear thanks to Limber, and hit hard with Return. Other than that, your best bet is to hope Glare's shaky 75% accuracy causes it to miss.</p> <p>If Ekans does manage to score a KO, there are plenty of effective revenge killers. Choice Scarf Gligar is great, since it resists the purple snake's STAB, outruns Choice Scarf Ekans and OHKOes with Earthquake. Choice Scarf Cranidos is also great, and it doesn't have to worry about Pokemon with Levitate switching in on Earthquake, thanks to Mold Breaker. Choice Scarf Abra can also work, since Psychic tears Ekans to pieces. Choice Scarf Diglett is the best at the job, however, since it can trap Ekans and OHKOes it with Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Glare": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Intimidate and the paralysis-inducing move, Glare. Using this set is rather simple: Come in on a physical attacker to try and force a switch because of Intimidate, and use Glare on whatever comes in. Unlike Thunder Wave, Glare paralyzes any Pokemon, regardless of its type; however, Glare has a shaky 75% accuracy, which can prove fatal if you miss. Poison Jab and Gunk Shot are Ekans's two best STAB moves, the former being more accurate but less powerful.</p> <p>Earthquake is used to hit Rock-, Poison-, and Steel-types besides Bronzor for super effective damage. The last move is a choice between Bite and Aqua Tail. Bite can be used to hit Ghost-types and also has a chance to create the deadly paraflinch combination. Aqua Tail is used to hit Ground-types, the most notable being Gligar, who resists Ekans's STAB moves and is immune to Earthquake. It also hits Bronzor for more damage than Bite.</p> <p>The EVs Ekans invests in all have a specific purpose. The 76 HP EVs and 4 Defense EVs allow for 21 HP and 11 Defense, respectively. This allows Ekans to never be 3HKOed by Scarf Machop's Dynamic Punch, making it a great switch in. 196 Attack EVs allow Ekans to reach max Attack with an Adamant nature. With 14 Speed, Ekans can outrun specific Pokemon, such as Phanpy, Duskull and Aron, and proceed to attack it if Glare misses on the switch. The 4 EVs in Special Defense add an extra stat point.</p> <p>This set loves having entry hazards up, since Intimidate often forces switches. Pineco is a great teammate because of this, since it can switch in on Ground-type moves and can set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes. Omanyte can also set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes, but it shares Ekans's Ground-type weakness, so Pineco is almost always the superior choice. However, with this set, be sure to not set up Toxic Spikes, as it gets in the way of Glare, since it prevents the foe from being paralyzed.</p> <p>This set is not designed to obliterate the foe, but to cripple him, so it doesn't need much help offensively. This allows Ekans to be a great aid to sweepers, especially slow ones, thanks to its ability to paralyze opponents. Slowpoke, Stunky and Carvanha are both great examples of Pokemon who appreciate paralysis support. They can all switch in on Psychic-type moves easily and start sweeping without the fear of being slower than the opponent. Munchlax can also take advantage of paralysis support, and can do huge damage with it. Aron, especially the powerful Choice Band set, makes great use of paralysis support, as it makes up for its lackluster Speed. Defensively, you are probably going to want the same teammates as the Choice set. Bronzor and Houndour continue to be great and Bronzor also benefits from the paralysis support, due to its low Speed. Just be sure you aren't running Gyro Ball, since paralysis will lower its power.</p>"

Sandshrew can easily be classified as one of the most efficient, though overlooked Pokemon in the tier of Little Cup.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Outside of the above sets, Sandshrew unfortunately doesn't have many other options to choose from, as many of them are largely outclassed by other Pokemon. A RestTalk set can be utilized, but the stall-ish nature of said set isn't very suitable for the fast paced, offensively inclined Little Cup metagame. In terms of possible move changes, Sandshrew has a couple to choose from: X-Scissor, Brick Break, and Gyro Ball are all viable, but when compared to the sheer power and coverage that Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Night Slash give, they aren't smart choices.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Water-types spell doom for Sandshrew, as it's quite vulnerable on the special side. Mantyke, Chinchou, and Staryu can all easily dispose of Sandshrew with simple STAB attacks; even Totodile, who is usually physically inclined, can cause major problems for Sandshrew because it has a strong STAB that hits Sandshrew for super effective damage. Croagunk and Dratini are also troublesome if they pack strong, super effective moves, but both must beware of switching into boosted attacks. Also, both Bronzor and Baltoy are able to check the defensive set, but must beware of Night Slash from the Swords Dance variant, as Sandshrew will usually carry that move in its arsenal. Lastly, Gastly and Duskull are immune to Sandshrew's STAB attack and can easily dispatch of it with their STAB attacks or simply start to set up on it.</p>",

      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>With massive natural bulk and excellent utility, Sandshrew makes a fine supporting Pokemon. Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin are both staples on this set, as they are the best support options Sandshrew is able to muster from its movepool. Earthquake and Rock Slide are both advised on this set as they provide Sandshrew with attacking options coming off an impressive base 75 Attack stat, ensuring that Sandshrew is not completely vulnerable to Taunt users or set-up bait for sweepers; the two aforementioned moves also have great offensive coverage with each other, forming the infamous \"EdgeQuake\" combination.</p> <p>The given EV spread has been designed to maximize Sandshrew's defensive prowess by heavily investing in HP, Defense, and Special Defense while also making the mouse Pokemon slightly offensive through EV investments in Attack and Speed. An Impish nature further complements the EV spread by making Sandshrew more bulky and durable, allowing it to provide support during various points in a battle, such as when it switches into a resisted physical attack. Lastly, an Oran Berry is the recommended item as it allows Sandshrew to remain at a passable level of health throughout the course of a battle.</p>"

  "Nidoran-M": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Although Nidoran-M may have very mediocre stats, they are just good enough to let it function at an acceptable level. Nidoran-M does not have the most impressive defensive stats in Little Cup, so it should always be focusing on offense rather than defense. Poison is also a poor offensive type, meaning Nidoran-M doesn't get a good STAB move to reliably hurt the opponent. Access to Sucker Punch, one of the strongest priority attacks in the game, is a blessing for Nidoran-M, but sadly it isn't very powerful due to Nidoran-M's disappointing Attack stat. Despite its unsatisfactory stats overall, Nidoran-M has access to Rivalry, which gives it an Attack boost when it's against male Pokemon, and a fair movepool that prevents it from being completely outclassed by other Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>All of Nidoran-M's noteworthy moves have already been mentioned, but a lead set with Toxic Spikes, Super Fang, Poison Jab, and Counter could work; it's just that Croagunk and Stunky's abundance in Little Cup make Toxic Spikes not very useful. Rock Smash can be used over Double Kick to have a 50% chance of lowering the foe's Defense stat, allowing Nidoran-M to take it out easier, but its Base Power is thoroughly underwhelming.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Munchlax and Gligar can easily come in on any attack, except Ice Beam for Gligar, and OHKO Nidoran-M with Earthquake. If Nidoran-M is running the physical set, Gligar can even set up a Swords Dance before wreaking havoc. Due to Nidoran-M's frail defenses, it is not very hard to pick it off with priority moves if it has taken some prior damage. Bronzor can wall every set Nidoran-M can run due to its defensive stats and typing and then strike back with Psychic. Any Pokemon who has reasonable defensive stats will fare well against Nidoran-M because it doesn't hit very hard, and its poor defenses mean that it usually won't be able to take more than two hits.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Nidoran-M makes a decent mixed attacker with its respectable coverage. Sludge Bomb is Nidoran-M's main STAB move that is capable of dealing deadly damage to any Pokemon not immune or resistant to it. Sucker Punch allows Nidoran-M to pick off weakened and faster foes. Ice Beam destroys Flying-, Ground-, and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Gligar and Dratini, though keep in mind that Nidoran-M cannot reliably outspeed these two threats. Hidden Power Fire hits Bronzor and other Steel-type Pokemon that would otherwise wall this set. Thunderbolt can also be used over Hidden Power Fire to hit Mantyke hard while still retaining neutral coverage on Steel-types, but has little utility outside of this.</p> <p>Life Orb allows Nidoran-M to dish out as much damage as possible. The IVs minimize recoil damage, while still giving a 70 Base Power Hidden Power Fire. Rivalry further boosts Nidoran-M's power against male Pokemon, but Poison Point may be used instead if Rivalry seems too unreliable for you, as it does reduce damage done to female Pokemon. A Rash nature allows Nidoran-M to hit its hardest with its special attacks, but Naive is an option if Speed is more important, allowing Nidoran-M to outspeed all Pokemon with 14 Speed and below.</p> <p>Nidoran-M greatly benefits from the removal of Munchlax, because even Double Kick will only 3HKO when factoring in Oran Berry. Therefore, Choice Scarf Mankey makes a great teammate to Nidoran-M, as it is able to easily OHKO Munchlax with Close Combat, as well as scout the opposing team with U-turn. Nidoran-M also appreciates entry hazards support to weaken the more defensive Pokemon on the opposing team. Bronzor is a good choice for setting up Stealth Rock because it resists Nidoran-M's weaknesses, and can also set up dual screens to further support Nidoran-M. Gligar, a threat to Nidoran-M, is also checked well by Bronzor.</p>"

While Vulpix often faces fierce competition with its Fire-type brethren for team positions, it does possess some notable advantages, such as having access to Energy Ball and Hypnosis. Play with Vulpix's key points to their peak and you will surely have a frightening fox in your hands.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Quick Attack is an option to pick off weakened Pokemon. Hidden Power Electric and Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit Mantyke. Hidden Power Rock has the added bonus of hitting other Fire-types, but Hidden Power Electric hurts Mantyke much more. Pain Split can be used on the Substitute set to make it easier to beat walls, but you lose out on valuable coverage or a status-inflicting move. Choice Specs can be used instead of Choice Scarf to obtain more power, notably gaining a higher chance of OHKOing 0 HP / 0 SpD Chinchou at full health with Energy Ball.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Munchlax is a great counter to Vulpix, being able to take four Fire Blasts from the Life Orb set and hit back hard with Earthquake or STAB Return. Mantyke is a big problem unless Vulpix carries Hidden Power Electric or Hidden Power Rock, due to its high Special Defense stat. Gligar cannot come in directly on Vulpix, but can switch in after a teammate faints, and either U-turn to scout the switch, or outspeed Vulpix and use Earthquake to OHKO. Opposing Fire-types and Dragon-types counter Vulpix if it does not carry the appropriate Hidden Power. Dratini gets a special mention because it not only resists both Fire Blast and Energy Ball, but also has Shed Skin to heal itself from Hypnosis and Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Vulpix is an unexpected and powerful Pokemon. With a Choice Scarf, Vulpix reaches 25 Speed, outspeeding dangerous Pokemon such as Jolly Choice Scarf Cranidos and Machop. On the first moveslot, Fire Blast is the main option since it is powerful and at least somewhat reliable, but Overheat can be used instead to deal even more damage at the cost of -2 Special Attack, which is great for hit-and-run tactics. Energy Ball complements Vulpix's Fire-type STAB well, hitting Water-types that would otherwise wall this set super effectively. Hypnosis sets Vulpix apart from its Fire-type rivals, allowing it to sleep otherwise threatening Pokemon. Hidden Power Ground is the best option for the last moveslot, as it allows Vulpix to take out opposing Fire-types. However, Hidden Power Ice is a good alternative that can be used to deal with Dragon-types.</p> <p>Will-O-Wisp can be used to burn physical sweepers, rendering them useless for the rest of the match. Flamethrower is a viable option if you want more accuracy, although power is usually more important since Vulpix's Special Attack is unboosted. IVs of 30 Special Attack and Special Defense are needed for Hidden Power Ground, while IVs of 30 Attack and Defenseshould be used if Hidden Power Ice is chosen.</p> <p>Rapid Spin really helps Vulpix do its job better by removing Stealth Rock, allowing Vulpix to switch in more freely. Staryu can serve this purpose well thanks to its relatively high Speed stat. It can also help take on Water attacks aimed at Vulpix, while Vulpix can eliminate Grass-types for Staryu. Choice Scarf Mankey is a great teammate that is able to beat Vulpix's number one counter, Munchlax. Mankey can also use U-turn to gain momentum for the team. Pineco is a good teammate because of its ability to set up Spikes, which really help Vulpix sweep; it also tends to attract Fire-type attacks, which Vulpix can switch in on for a Flash Fire boost. Paras, like Pineco, sports a large Fire weakness, but is immune to Water thanks to Dry Skin and also resists Ground, making it another good partner for Vulpix.</p> <p>Pokemon with Aqua Jet, such as Carvanha and Totodile, can easily pick off Vulpix. Choice Scarf Gligar can also beat all types of Vulpix with Earthquake, outspeeding even Choice Scarf Vulpix and OHKOing with Earthquake. To remedy these problems, Pokemon such as Paras, Surskit, and Mantyke can be used to defend Vulpix from Water and Ground attacks and retaliate back with super effective moves.</p>"

Switch in on a Pokemon that does not threaten it, such as a weak Fire- or Grass-type, Substitute as the opponent switches, and proceed to either hit the switch-in hard or inflict status. Hypnosis is again used because it allows Vulpix to incapacitate its counters. Will-O-Wisp is a good alternative if you don't like Hypnosis's shaky accuracy, and helps a lot against physical sweepers. Behind a Substitute, Vulpix will usually get two shots at using Hypnosis, so it can usually put a Pokemon to sleep, and then do damage with Energy Ball or STAB Fire Blast.</p> <p>Life Orb is the best item choice, as it offers almost as much power as Choice Specs, but allows you to change moves. However, Wide Lens is also a usable item option; with Wide Lens, Fire Blast reaches 93.5% accuracy, Will-O-Wisp increases to 82.5%, and Hypnosis gets a slight boost to 66%. Wynaut can help Vulpix set up a Substitute through Encore, and can also take on some of Vulpix's counters with Counter and Mirror Coat.</p> <p>Substitute Vulpix is a great cleanup Pokemon, finishing off any Pokemon on the opponent's team late-game when most Pokemon are weakened. Flamethrower is again an alternative option because it is more reliable than Fire Blast, but if Vulpix is behind a Substitute, Fire Blast misses are more tolerable. Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Ground are also options for the fourth moveslot, as they provide greater coverage.</p>"

  "Zubat": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Zubat seems to be pretty terrible due to its poor stats across the board, limited coverage, and weakness to Stealth Rock. However, it does have some moves that most other Flying-type Pokemon would kill for, namely Nasty Plot, which can boost Zubat's Special Attack to decent levels. In addition, Zubat's Poison / Flying typing offers it useful quad resistances to Bug, Fighting, and Grass. Overall, while Zubat may be inferior to many of the other Flying-type Pokemon in LC, it does have some unique qualities to that prevent it from being completely outclassed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Surprisingly, Zubat has a couple of interesting other options to note. Quick Attack can be used to revenge kill easier, though it does poor damage overall without STAB. Super Fang can be used to slice the health of healthy walls such as Gligar and Aron in half, though it will only be effective early in the game when most Pokemon are at full health and the opponent's team hasn't been revealed. Fly is a viable STAB move, having more power than Pluck (unless it attacks a Pokemon holding Oran Berry), while not having recoil damage unlike Brave Bird. However, Pokemon that resist Fly can easily be easily switched in, making Fly a poor option. Zen Headbutt is an interesting option to strike Poison- and Fighting-type Pokemon without taking Brave Bird's recoil, but doesn't provide much use outside of that. Tailwind can allow Zubat to outspeed every Pokemon in the tier, while also doubling the Speed of its teammates. Unfortunately, Zubat is frail and better off dealing damage right off the bat; additionally, Tailwind only lasts for a mere three turns. Zubat has access to Nasty Plot as well as Heat Wave, Sludge Bomb, and Air Slash, but with a meager 30 base that would make even Bidoof laugh, Zubat won't be finding much use for it, even after a boost. Speaking of special attacks, Hidden Power Ground or Fighting can be used to deal with Rock-type Pokemon, which would otherwise easily counter Zubat. If a Hidden Power is used, Zubat should be using a Hasty nature. Finally, Zubat can run a weather support set, due to its access to Rain Dance, Sunny Day, and U-turn, which allows it to bring in a sweeper immediately.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>The single best counters are Rock-type Pokemon, since they completely wall Zubat and can retaliate with super effective STAB attacks. Aron is the best example of this, being able to Rock Polish without fear of being KOed by any of Zubat's moves and OHKO Zubat with Head Smash while continuing to wreak havoc. Likewise, Bronzor can take on a majority of Zubat's moves and OHKO back with Psychic. Electric-type Pokemon that outspeed Zubat are great counters; Elekid is a good example, as it can outspeed Zubat and take it out with Thunder Punch. Since Zubat is frail, priority moves greatly harm it, especially Ice Shard. Pokemon such as Snover and Swinub can check Zubat with Ice Shard without worrying about getting hit in return. Finally, Gligar is a great counter to Zubat due to its impressive physical bulk and access to Stone Edge.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>With 16 Speed, Zubat can effectively utilize a Choice Scarf set in order to scout and revenge kill the opponent. Brave Bird is Zubat's most powerful STAB attack, though the recoil damage may hurt. Pluck is a good alternative to Brave Bird since it allows Zubat to heal itself when attacking a Pokemon holding Oran Berry, though the power drop is significant. U-turn is a very useful attack, allowing Zubat to scout for counters that may want to switch in. Return provides good neutral coverage, and is its strongest attack without recoil. Finally, Pursuit allows Zubat to checkmate weakened Pokemon.</p> <p>Super Fang is a viable option to use instead of Return, and is much more effective early-game, when most Pokemon are at full health, as it will force all switch-ins (bar Ghost-types) to lose half of their health, and eases prediction for the player.</p> <p>Since holding a Choice Scarf will make Zubat switch a lot, a Rapid Spinner will pair up great with Zubat. Sandshrew is a prime choice for a spinner because it resists Rock-type attacks and is immune to Electric-type attacks, while Zubat quad-resists Grass-type attacks, though they do share a nasty Ice-type weakness. Sandshrew also has the bulk to set up Stealth Rock, making it the best choice. To take care of the Ice weakness, utilizing Pokemon such as Aron and Bronzor is ideal. Aron can switch in and weaken the foe with Head Smash, while Bronzor can tank several hits and retaliate back its coverage moves.</p>"

Taunt, coupled with 16 Speed, allow it to stop slow leads such as Hippopotas from setting up Stealth Rock. Brave Bird is a powerful STAB attack, being able to OHKO Oran Berry Machop, a common lead in today's metagame. Roost is also a helpful option, healing off the recoil damage dealt from Brave Bird, while also allowing Zubat to deal more damage. U-turn allows Zubat to scout for counters, and allows the team to gain momentum.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Zubat's Attack and Speed stats, while increasing its HP by one point, allowing it to take hits better.</p> <p>Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Kabuto will be troublesome, since they take little damage from any of Zubat's attacks, and can set up Stealth Rock. Like Kabuto, Bronzor also has an easy time dealing with Zubat, being able to set up Stealth Rock, before firing off STAB Psychic. As such, teammates that can deal with Kabuto and Bronzor are good to pair up with Zubat. Wooper is a great Kabuto counter, having Water Absorb to prevent it from being hurt by Kabuto's Water attacks, while it also resists Rock Slide thanks to its Ground typing. In return, Wooper can hit Kabuto hard with STAB Earthquake, and Recover off any lost health. Magnet Rise Magnemite is a great counter to Bronzor, being able to trap it and switch in on any move not named Earthquake. From there, Magnemite can use Magnet Rise while it attempts to Earthquake, before taking Bronzor out with repeated Thunderbolts.</p>"

Different Hidden Powers can also be used on this set; however, Hidden Power Fire is far and away the best choice.

Munchlax is probably Oddish's best counter, being able to take all of its attacks and OHKO with either Fire Punch or Return. Snover is able to switch in on a suspected Solar Beam, and either outspeed or just kill Oddish, now trapped because Solar Beam has to take a turn to charge, with Ice Shard. Revenge killing Oddish can be a bit easier thanks to priority attacks and fast Choice Scarf users. Croagunk is a good option to revenge kill Oddish, being able to KO it with Fake Out + Sucker Punch and stall Sunny Day turns in the meantime. However, Croagunk can be hurt a bit too, because Sunny Day damages Croagunk. 27+ Speed Choice Scarfers are good for revenge killing Oddish thanks to Oddish's low defenses and mere 26 Speed (in the sun). Examples of these would include Gastly, Gligar, Abra, or Ponyta.</p>",

      "Sunny Day Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>If you were to use Oddish as a regular sweeper without Sunny Day, you would undoubtedly be underwhelmed by its very low Speed (and low stats in general). However, with Sunny Day up, Oddish becomes a very dangerous threat. Chlorophyll makes up for Oddish's lack of Speed by doubling its Speed under Sunny Day; couple this with Oddish's high Special Attack, and you'll find a powerful sweeper. Backed by Life Orb, Oddish can fire off very powerful STAB attacks that not many Pokemon can take.</p> <p>Solar Beam should be the primary attacking move on this set, and with 120 Base Power behind it, opposing Pokemon will have a tough time switching in on Oddish. Sludge Bomb is also a great option thanks to its high Base Power and STAB. Hidden Power Fire is great on this set because all Fire-type moves are boosted by Sunny Day, not to mention that Hidden Power Fire rounds off nicely what would otherwise be poor coverage. Oddish has a shallow special movepool, so Sunny Day is the best option in the fourth slot, not only to support itself, but the rest of the team as well. Sleep Powder also works well because it lets Oddish incapacitate its counters and continue to sweep.</p> <p>A Pokemon that works well with this set is Houndour, thanks to its resistances to several of Oddish's weaknesses, particularly Fire-type moves. Houndour can switch in on Pokemon that threaten Oddish, like Snover or Ponyta, and force them out (possibly netting a Flash Fire boost in the process). This Oddish set works best on a team built around Sunny Day so that Oddish isn't forced to set up Sunny Day for itself, which can be difficult because of how fragile Oddish is. Good candidates to set up Sunny Day include, but are not limited to: Aipom, Bellsprout, Growlithe, Drifloon, Exeggcute, Koffing, and Duskull.</p> <p>The EVs on the set have been adjusted to account for Hidden Power Fire, so if you decide not to use it, you should adjust your EVs accordingly. The reason for the special IVs on this set are so that Oddish only takes 1 HP of Life Orb recoil, making it bulkier in the long run.</p>"

  "Paras": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Paras has seen quite a bit of use with the fast paced metagame, because Paras is easy to switch in with its 4x Ground-type resist, Water-type immunity, and Electric- and Fighting-type resistance. Once Paras gets in the battle, it can slow it down with its signature move, a move that completely renders a Pokemon useless for up to four turns, which is too long to wait out in this metagame. Paras is also bulky enough to live through almost any hit barring Fire- and Flying-type attacks, allowing it to reliably get a Spore off.</p> <p>Paras has a main weakness: its Speed. Paras's Speed is so low that other slow bulky Pokemon such as Geodude can go before it. Paras also needs a lot of prediction if your opponent has a Pokemon such as Shuppet or Mankey, who are immune to Spore. With Murkrow banned from standard play, Paras can usually Spore right off the bat, but it needs to be careful not to take any sort of Flying-type or Fire-type attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Paras could use a special set quite well, with a decent special movepool including Energy Ball and Sludge Bomb. However, Shroomish is more effective for special sets, given its better defenses and more effective stats for EVing. Any Paras set can use Psybeam as a secondary attack to OHKO Croagunk, but generally Paras pulls off physical moves better.</p> <p>A fully defensive set could work, but Paras can not survive for too long, as it is usually forced out by any Fire-type attack user. Shroomish outclasses Paras defensively, but it lacks support moves such as Light Screen that could be used on a defensive Paras. Paras has some other usable defensive moves, such as Counter and Aromatherapy. Dry Skin is generally preferred on Paras, but Effect Spore can help out quite a bit too with Paras's low Speed.</p> <p>A Choice Band or Swords Dance set could also be effective. With Spore, Paras can put the opponent to sleep and set up a Swords Dance and attempt a sweep. A Choice Band Pursuit is also quite deadly against something like Slowpoke, who is terrified of Paras' STAB attacks. Agility could be used with Life Orb to boost Paras' terrible Speed, but Paras doesn't quite hit hard enough to sweep effectively, and doesn't have the extra move slot for Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Paras is difficult to completely counter, because most Pokemon sent in will get taken out of combat with Spore. This being said, the best counter is Doduo, who resists both STAB attacks, and has Early Bird to get rid of its sleep. Doduo can easily OHKO Paras with a STAB Brave Bird or Pluck. Similarly, the odd Early Bird Houndour can do the same, but needs to watch out for Brick Break and even X-Scissor. Taillow can also switch in quite easily after its status orb is activated, making Taillow immune to Spore and able to OHKO with Brave Bird.</p> <p>Shuppet is a good Pokemon to switch in, but it may only work once as the Paras user may start Seed Bombing, which is a 2HKO on Shuppet, even while holding Oran Berry. Paras may also be carrying Choice Band and can Pursuit it into oblivion. The best bet for Shuppet is to carry Will-O-Wisp to render Paras nearly useless. Mankey is also usable, with Vital Spirit preventing sleep, and access to Ice Punch and U-turn. Bronzor can take an attack or two, but can't really touch Paras. Shieldon or Aron can take any STAB attacks from Paras, though they have to be wary of Brick Break. Croagunk resists Seed Bomb, Bug Bite, and Brick Break, while it can take out Paras with Ice Punch, which is a 2HKO, but it needs to watch out for Aerial Ace.</p> <p>Revenge killing Paras is a very easy task, due to Paras having pitiful Speed. Any Fire-type attacker with decent Speed, such as Magby, can revenge kill Paras with a quick Flamethrower or Flare Blitz. Also, any slightly fast Flying-type attacker, such as Natu, can revenge kill Paras with ease. Diglett also gets a special mention due to being able to trap and KO Paras with Aerial Ace.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Paras is quite a popular Pokemon in Little Cup, and for a good reason. Spore is one of the best moves in the game, being a 100% accurate sleep-inducing move. Taking a Pokemon out of combat is an excellent tool to have, especially in a metagame where every turn counts. This set uses all of Paras' strengths: its decent defenses, its above average Attack, and of course, Spore. This set comes with a couple of options, first being the second attacking move. Seed Bomb is a nice STAB move; however, while Aerial Ace is not very powerful, it hits other Paras and more importantly Croagunk. Bug Bite is a great move to use in Little Cup, with Oran Berry being the most common item in the metagame, even though X-Scissor will hit a little harder. With Paras' decent Attack stat, it can put the hurt on Pokemon switching in. Synthesis is recommended in the last move slot because of the many Pokemon who use Protect; Paras will likely get at least a couple chances to heal himself.</p> <p>Alternatively, Paras can use the double status approach by using Stun Spore in the last slot. The strategy is fairly simple, starting off with Spore. After the opponent is asleep, you can either predict their incoming switch and Stun Spore, or hit the sleeping Pokemon with a powerful STAB attack. Paras laughs at most priority attacks, so you don't need to worry about those outpacing you. This is the main reason Paras really benefits from using paralysis to outpace its opponent. This set does not need cover Croagunk, because Paras can generally take him out with paralysis and strong STAB attacks.</p> <p>With its monstrous Fire-type weakness, Paras will lure out Fire-type attackers, and as such, needs something to sponge those hits. Pokemon like Ponyta and Houndour work very well with Paras, as Paras' weakness reliably gets them Flash Fire boosts. Paras also has a huge weakness to Flying-type attacks, which will mainly come from Pokemon like Taillow, Gligar, and Doduo. These Pokemon are much easier to wall, because their STABs are all resisted by the same types. An example is Bronzor, who resists Normal-, Flying-, and Ground-type attacks. Paras has a terribly annoying Rock weakness, meaning it can only switch in a certain amount of times before it gets knocked out by Stealth Rock. Paras works best with Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Squirtle or Anorith, especially since, if your opponent uses Gastly (a common switch-in to Paras due to it resisting both STABs), their Ghost-type will likely get put to sleep or weakened by Paras. This gives Squirtle and Anorith a much better chance to rid the battlefield of Stealth Rock.</p> <p>If you opt for Stun Spore, many slow and powerful Pokemon benefit from paralysis support. Cubone is a great example; with its monstrous Attack and great coverage it will surely land a few KOs as long as it outspeeds the opponents. Substitute sweepers can also take advantage of paralysis, using Substitute until the foe is unable to attack, followed by either KOing that Pokemon or setting up. Paras also has a very unique ability that should be taken advantage of, especially with Stealth Rock being so common. Using Pokemon like Rhyhorn or Onix with Paras is an extremely good tactic for luring Water-type attacks that heal Paras up during the battle, allowing it to keep on taking the hits it needs to be taking for your team.</p>"

    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Venonat is not intended to be the star of the show or the centerpiece of a team. However, it is, with proper support, a very valuable niche Pokemon that can help a team immensely by providing paralysis, sleep support, or Speed boosts for its teammates. Venonat does have some useful resistances, most notably quadruple resistances to Fighting- and Grass-type attacks. If you manage to get Venonat in safely, the threat of Sleep Powder gives you the opportunity to swing the momentum back in your team's favor. Venonat may not have stellar stats, but it must be played around carefully since it can easily cripple multiple Pokemon with status.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Signal Beam can be used on attacking sets as a secondary STAB attack, but its Base Power is less than desired. An accurate Disable can stop Choice users in their tracks and force them to switch or Struggle; however, Venonat, bar Choice Scarf variants, is too slow to use it effectively. Toxic Spikes and Morning Sun could be used, but Venonat's poor defenses make the moves' usefulness questionable. Also, Venonat generally has better things to do than heal its HP. Zen Headbutt can replace Psychic if you decide to go down the physical route.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Shuppet and Mankey get in for free if Venonat uses Sleep Powder since they are immune to sleep. Aron, Bronzor, and Shieldon resist most of Venonat's attacking arsenal; however, they are slow and run the risk of being put to sleep. Munchlax also stops the sweeping version cold, and a RestTalk set shuts down every Venonat variant that there is. You can use a Pokemon with Roar to phaze Venonat away on the turn it uses Baton Pass, wasting its efforts. Focus Sash versions are picked off by priority users such as Bullet Punch Machop, Aqua Jet Squirtle and Kabuto, and Fake Out users. Venonat is rather slow and frail, so switching in a Fire- or Flying-type that is faster than Venonat before it uses Agility will scare it away. Taunt shuts down most of Venonat's support sets.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Venonat's main role on a team is to pass Speed boosts to a slower sweeper. Compound Eyes is a great asset for Venonat, giving its Sleep Powder an almost perfect accuracy of 97.5%. Putting an opponent to sleep allows it to get an Agility in for free and sometimes even get the recipient of the Speed boost in without harm. The final slot provides Venonat with a reliable attack in case it is hit by Taunt.</p> <p>With the given EVs, Venonat hits 30 Speed after an Agility, which is enough to outrun almost all of the metagame, at worst tying with max Speed Choice Scarf Voltorb. This enables Venonat to put any Pokemon that comes in to sleep without taking a hit, bar a priority move.</p> <p>The fourth move has many different options to choose from. Sludge Bomb gets STAB and allows Venonat to hit opposing targets relatively hard. Psychic hits the most popular sleep-immune Pokemon, Mankey, for super effective damage, as well as hitting opposing Poison-type Pokemon hard. Protect can be used if Venonat is leading so that Aipom and Meowth don't break its Focus Sash, but it will leave Venonat completely vulnerable to Taunt leads such as Gligar and Voltorb.</p> <p>Sweepers such as Cranidos, Cubone, Gligar, Machop, and Houndour and all work well after they receive a Speed boost from Venonat. Cranidos and Cubone are on the same boat; both of them are heavy hitters that unfortunately lack the Speed to threaten anything, so passing an Agility to them can really turn the tables. Machop and Gligar can both receive a boost and continue to stat up, or, alternatively, just take the boost and start sweeping with their good Attack stats. Lastly, Houndour is a good Pokemon to pair with Venonat because its Flash Fire ability allows it to freely switch into Fire-type attacks directed at Venonat while boosting its own Fire-type attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Venonat is not exactly an offensive powerhouse, but a Choice Scarf set is a viable alternative since it possesses the ability to stop sweepers with a fast Sleep Powder. This set can be used as a lead to give you an advantage from the get-go or to take care of a sweeper later in the game with Sleep Powder or Sludge Bomb. If you're using Venonat as a lead, Compound Eyes is the preferred ability in order to neutralize the opponent's Pokemon 97.5% of the time.</p> <p>Venonat's movepool isn't particularly broad, so the best special attacking options are used. Sludge Bomb is Venonat's main and strongest attack when factoring in STAB and Tinted Lens. Psychic hits Poison- and Fighting-types for super effective damage. The fourth move depends on what it needs to hit; Hidden Power Ice OHKOes Gligar, Taillow, and Diglett while Hidden Power Fire is Venonat's best bet against Bronzor, although Bronzor will shrug off Hidden Power Fire without too much trouble.</p> <p>The ability comes down to personal preference. Compound Eyes ensures that Venonat's Sleep Powder will hit most of the time, making it the desirable choice on the lead slot. Tinted Lens will give Venonat more power, since resistances still take the same amount of damage as they would if they were neutral.</p> <p>Having Stealth Rock is always a good idea, as Choice Scarf Venonat will cause a lot of switches. Stealth Rock helps by chipping away HP every time a Pokemon switches in. Also, having Pokemon able to stat up, especially behind a Substitute, is not a bad idea since the opponent's Pokemon will be asleep, allowing for a free switch to a sweeper. Magnemite and Machop are good partners to use with Venonat, since they can beat most Pokemon that commonly switch into Venonat, such as Bronzor and Munchlax, respectively.</p>"

      "Double Powder": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Compound Eyes, Venonat's Stun Spore's and Sleep Powder's accuracy skyrockets to 97.5%, making Venonat an ideal double powder user. Taking advantage of this, Venonat can attempt to cripple the opponent by using the successful double powder strategy: sleep one opponent and paralyze another when it switches in.</p> <p>Bug Bite can help Venonat steal Berries, most notably Oran Berry, from assorted foes. Venonat can use Baton Pass to scout whether the foe has an Insomnia user waiting in the wings, or to see what Pokemon the opponent is willing to sacrifice as a sleep absorber. Another option is Hidden Power Fire, which can hit both Bronzor and Croagunk relatively hard.</p> <p>Slow Pokemon such as Cranidos, Cubone, Houndour, Machop, and Wailmer all work exceptionally well with this set. Venonat can put a counter to sleep and start spreading paralysis to the other Pokemon, allowing slow, heavy hitters to have an easier time in the match. If Venonat runs Baton Pass, it makes switching in your Pokemon a lot easier; you don't have to run the risk of a double switch, and if the opponent decides to stay in, you can generally tell what he is going to do.</p>"

With its convenient ability to boost its moves' power, which is particularly notable on moves such as Fake Out, Meowth will usually have the upper hand against its opponent. Meowth also hits 19 Speed, allowing it to outpace a majority of the metagame. Even with the advent of leads running Protect to deal with Meowth, it is still extremely effective inside and outside the lead slot since priority moves are ever-so-important in LC. Meowth is usually left untouched until the end of the match since it can spam Fake Out and U-turn to escape from the opponent, causing widespread damage. Overall, Meowth is an extremely valuable asset and should be considered as a lead to set the tempo for the match.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>In the lead slot, Meowth can run a Feint set to break through typical Protect leads, and can follow up with Return for the 2HKO most of the time. Meowth can also run Substitute to block Duskull's Will-O-Wisp. With a number of Protect leads in the tier, getting Substitute down shouldn't be too difficult. A Protect set in conjunction with Focus Sash and Fake Out could help kill time for Meowth, which allows it to break down sweepers who value their time on field, such as Rain Dance teams, Taillow, and Teddiursa. Lastly, Meowth can run a Rain Dance set with Fake Out and U-turn. Unlike Voltorb, Meowth has Fake Out to remove Focus Sash from the opponent. U-turn also allows Meowth to successfully bring in your Rain Dance sweepers safely.</p> <p>Attack-wise, Meowth can run a lot of things. A Last Resort set could work with its high Speed stat and decent Attack stat. The set is almost guaranteed to lure in the omnipresent Ghost-types in the tier, turning Meowth into nice bait for Ghosts and allowing Stunky to trap them. For the most part though, Aipom can do it better since it has a higher Attack stat. The Nasty Plot set can add Fake Out into the mix to bluff and lure the opponent's physical walls in. However, Meowth doesn't have the respectable mixed offensive stats to pull this off successfully. Meowth can run a Choice Band set, but Aipom usually outclasses it since it has a higher Attack stat. Along with a Technician boost, Fury Swipes could also break a Substitute.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Steel-types are troublesome for the physical set, as Meowth lacks a Fighting-type move to hurt them. Bronzor, Aron, and Shieldon can come in on any hits and hit back with their respective moves. Rock-types, particularly Geodude, Rhyhorn, and Omanyte, can check it as well. For the Nasty Plot set, Munchlax is your best thanks to its high Special Defense stat; it can also swiftly KO Meowth with Return. Without Hidden Power Dark, bulky Ghost-types such as Duskull can deal with Meowth. Duskull can take any attack save Hidden Power Dark and hit back with Blizzard. If Meowth lacks Hidden Power Fire, Bronzor is your best against it (outside of Munchlax).</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Meowth is one of the few leads that will almost always give your team an instant advantage. Thanks to its ability, Technician, Meowth can deal respectable amounts of damage to the opponent with its low Base Power moves. Fake Out makes an excellent opening move as it breaks the opponent's Focus Sash while flinching them in the process, which usually allows Meowth to finish the opponent with a STAB Return. Seed Bomb surprises Kabuto leads by 2HKOing with the combination of Fake Out and Seed Bomb. Bite hits Ghost-types, U-turn makes a great scouting move, Hypnosis puts Machop to sleep (thanks to No Guard), and Taunt deals with set up leads.</p> <p>Fake Out is a powerful STAB move, allowing Meowth to inflict damage at any stage of the match. Seed Bomb could replace Return if you want to catch Kabuto off-guard, since it will usually stay in expecting Meowth to escape with U-turn. As an added bonus, Seed Bomb will strike Phanpy harder than Return, and with a Life Orb, has a slight chance of 2HKOing after Fake Out. Bite allows Meowth to combat Ghost-types who would otherwise wall its STAB moves. Bite always OHKOes Gastly and has a chance to OHKO Duskull. U-turn allows Meowth to scout the opponent's next switch-in; with the combination of Fake Out and U-turn, Meowth essentially scores free hits on the opponent. This allows Meowth to stick around for the entire match to periodically inflict damage upon the opponent. U-turn also allows Meowth to escape from a possible Aron set up.</p> <p>The final slot depends on what you want to do. Despite its low accuracy, Hypnosis receives 100% accuracy against Machop due to its ability, No Guard. It also neutralizes slower leads, especially Bronzor, allowing Meowth to use U-turn to something that might appreciate a free setup. With 19 Speed, Meowth can use Taunt over Hypnosis on slower set up leads such as Phanpy, Kabuto, and Bronzor, preventing them from using support moves such as Stealth Rock. All in all, if Hypnosis's accuracy is making you nervous, Taunt should be a safer alternative.</p> <p>Focus Sash helps Meowth survive for a long time in the match since due to Fake Out and U-turn, it is usually left untouched, while Taunt shuts down Stealth Rock users, preventing them from setting up entry hazards and stripping Meowth's item off that way. Both Life Orb and Silk Scarf add power to Meowth's physical attacks. Life Orb lets Meowth grab a possible 2HKO on Gligar and Phanpy with the combination of Fake Out and Return. Silk Scarf adds power to Fake Out and Return while bluffing a Focus Sash as an added bonus.</p> <p>With its fantastic typing and high Defense stat, Bronzor can take a hit from Meowth and counteract with Flash Cannon for the possible 2HKO. Fire-types such as Magby and Ponyta work well with Meowth, because they can keep Bronzor away for the entire match. Duskull also troubles Meowth since it can check it with Will-O-Wisp or damage it with Blizzard. Ponyta is usually your best bet against Duskull since it can switch in on Blizzard or eat Will-O-Wisp to boost Flare Blit z's power. Aron is another problem since it could possibly use Rock Polish on the switch out. Be sure to utilize a defensive Gligar or Phanpy to deal with Aron; otherwise, it will be extremely hard to deal with Aron's Head Smash. As for offensive partners, Elekid also works well since Meowth can cause considerable damage with the combination of Fake Out and U-turn, and Elekid sweeps at its best when everything is significantly weakened. Gastly and Gligar also work well since they both provide a much needed Fighting-type switch-in for Meowth, while they could use a free turn to set up.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Psyduck looks vastly inferior to the majority of usable Water-type Pokemon. Psyduck, however, has two things working for it that sets it apart: access to Cross Chop and its ability, Cloud Nine. Cross Chop allows Psyduck to threaten Snover, who walls most other Water-types easily. Cloud Nine, however, is the main reason that Psyduck is a viable option in Little Cup play. With Cloud Nine, Psyduck is able to stop weather-based teams cold. Furthermore, its respectable base 65 Special Attack and base 52 Attack stat allows Psyduck to retain general utility if the opposing team does not have a weather abuser.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Yawn can be used somewhat effectively on Psyduck, as it forces your opponent to make a decision between either switching out or KOing Psyduck at the expense of being put to sleep. Running Yawn leaves Psyduck vulnerable to Pokemon that it wants to beat consistently, however. Additionally, Encore can be used to surprise an opponent trying to set up on Psyduck, though it forces you to switch Psyduck out immediately. Psyduck can attempt to run a Life Orb set, but in general you're better off using a Pokemon with a higher attacking stat.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Psyduck may not look like it, but it can be a hard Pokemon to beat. Croagunk is the closest thing to a Psyduck counter with its immunity to Psyduck's STAB attack and resistance to Cross Chop and Hidden Power Grass. Croagunk can use a combination of Fake Out and either Vacuum Wave or Sucker Punch to whittle Psyduck's health down. Munchlax checks Psyduck pretty well, especially if Psyduck does not have Cross Chop. Even with Cross Chop, Munchlax is only 3HKOed, which allows it to switch into Psyduck without fear at least once. Chinchou and Mantyke counter Psyduck well depending on the Hidden Power that Psyduck knows; Chinchou will wall Hidden Power Electric variants all day long, while Mantyke shrugs aside attacks from Hidden Power Grass variants. Bronzor is bulky enough to switch into Psyduck, but it can't do much in return except for setting up screens.</p>",

      "Weather Counter": {
        "description": "<p>Psyduck's best chance of success in the Little Cup metagame is obtained by using a Choice Scarf. With a Choice Scarf and a Naive nature, Psyduck reaches a very good 24 Speed, which outspeeds all non-Choice Scarf users in addition to threats such as Dratini and Bagon after a Dragon Dance. Psyduck's deep movepool gives it superior type coverage and makes it a good Choice Scarf user. Additionally, Choice Scarf gives Psyduck great utility outside of the unique niche of being an end-all counter to weather-based teams.</p> <p>Hydro Pump is Psyduck's most powerful STAB move and allows Psyduck to hit as hard as possible. Surf can be used if you're afraid of Hydro Pump's shaky accuracy, but then Psyduck loses the ability to 2HKO Lileep. Ice Beam OHKOes Gligar, Cacnea, and Gible, all of whom lose their Sand Veil evasion boost because of Cloud Nine. Cross Chop will 2HKO Snover through its Oran Berry while providing general utility against Aron and Munchlax late game. Hidden Power Grass is the first option on this set since it gives Psyduck the ability to OHKO Kabuto and Omanyte, as well as hitting Chinchou for good damage. On the other hand, Hidden Power Electric OHKOes Mantyke 100% of the time with Stealth Rock up. Psychic is a decent option for Psyduck, as it allows it to OHKO Croagunk, a staple on Rain Dance teams, easily.</p> <p>Naive is the nature of choice because it allows Psyduck to be as fast as possible while also not lowering either of its attacking stats. The EVs are fairly straightforward. Psyduck needs its Special Attack maximized to score many of the OHKOs and 2HKOs that it needs to be effective, and running maximum Speed on Psyduck allows it to tie with threats such as Aron after a Rock Polish and Choice Scarf Mankey. The remaining EVs give Psyduck an extra point in Attack that boosts the power of Cross Chop.</p> <p>Obviously, Pokemon that benefit from the removal of weather starters work well alongside Psyduck. Gligar fears rain abusers and hail abusers alike, and it can switch in easily on Electric-type attacks aimed at Psyduck. Gligar is a magnet for Water- and Ice-type attacks as well, which Psyduck can switch in on easily. Dratini appreciates Psyduck's presence as well, since it likes to start attacking after a single Dragon Dance. Psyduck helps to remove any Chlorophyll and Swift Swim sweepers that trouble Dratini, such as Bellsprout or Mantyke. Generally, if a Pokemon hates any common weather-starters, they will appreciate Psyduck's help. Psyduck can also plug a hole on teams that lack a reliable revenge killer, as it has a respectable 24 Speed with its Choice Scarf and a variety of attacks to cover most types of Pokemon.</p>"

    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>While Growlithe doesn't have a particularly impressive movepool, Crunch can be used to OHKO Gastly and 2HKOes Duskull without having to deal with recoil, poor accuracy or a Special Attack drop. Any Hidden Power of your choice can work, including Hidden Power Rock or even Hidden Power Grass to hit Chinchou on the switch. Other than these few moves, there aren't many other viable ones in Growlithe's shallow movepool.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Growlithe's biggest counters are bulky Waters who can set up on him, such as Agility Chinchou and Mantyke. Practically any Water-type be able to defeat Growlithe, and can use the turn on which Growlithe switches out to set up or simply attack the switch-in. Houndour can freely switch in on every single one of Growlithe's moves, bar Reversal, and can proceed to damage your Pokemon with his powerful STAB Fire-type attacks. Faster Choice Scarf users, such as Gastly, can deliver a strong hit to Growlithe with their STAB moves. However, most of these Pokemon will struggle to switch in on Growlithe thanks to his powerful attacks.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This set's primary goal is to switch into a physical threat, weaken their attack with Intimidate, and hit hard with the appropriate move. Growlithe does an excellent job of forcing physical attackers out, as well as hitting extremely hard with his two high-powered STAB moves.</p> <p>Flare Blitz and Overheat are Growlithe's primary STAB moves, and hit almost everyone, bar Munchlax and Flash Fire Pokemon, extremely hard. The two coverage moves are for anything Growlithe's Fire-type moves can't hit hard. Hidden Power Ice is used primarily for Dragon-types. It helps Growlithe revenge kill Dragon Dance Dratini, Bagon, and Gible. Reversal, on the other hand, hits Munchlax and Houndour hard when Growlithe is at low health. While Reversal may not seem too viable, Growlithe will often find himself at low health due to Stealth Rock damage and Flare Blitz recoil. Return or Crunch could be used for neutral coverage or to hit Ghost-types, but Reversal and Hidden Power Ice are usually the better choices.</p> <p>This set has a lot of trouble with bulky Water-types, so pairing him with an Electric-type is a good idea. Elekid and Choice Scarf Chinchou make great partners. Chinchou can come in on any Water-type attack aimed at Growlithe, then proceed to set up an Agility. Elekid, on the other hand, can clean up with his Speed stat of 20 after Growlithe has broken down walls with his powerful STAB moves. Munchlax also makes a great teammate, as he can wall Choice Scarf Houndour, who loves to switch in on Growlithe's STAB moves. A status absorber is also nice, because being paralyzed almost completely nullifies Growlithe's effectiveness.</p>"

  "Poliwag": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Poliwag is an interesting Pokemon. On the one hand, it has a great Speed stat and a solid typing. It is also the fastest user of Hypnosis in LC, which is definitely a bonus. Its ability allows it to potentially restore one-quarter of its health when it switches in - never a bad thing, and it enjoys a wide array of interesting moves to work with. On the other hand, Poliwag suffers from a lot of downfalls. Its offensive stats aren't the greatest, and Poliwag is very frail. Though its support movepool is pretty darn impressive, its offensive movepool is awfully poor. All in all, Poliwag can be a destructive Pokemon, just be sure to use it to its strengths.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Poliwag actually has some interesting options in its arsenal of moves. It has Wake-Up Slap, which can be useful. With a Jolly nature and max Attack EVs, Poliwag has a 25% chance of OHKOing a sleeping Munchlax. Poliwag also gets Mud Shot and Icy Wind, two attacks that have a 100% chance of lowering the opponent's Speed by one stage. Poliwag has a few neat support moves. It gets Toxic and Swagger, but doesn't really have the bulk to use either move effectively. Body Slam is an interesting option over Return, as it has a 30% chance of inflicting paralysis. A physical moveset consisting of Hypnosis, Waterfall, Return or Body Slam, and Wake-Up Slap is also viable, as Poliwag's Attack stat is higher than its Special Attack, but the specially-based set is preferred because it gets better coverage. In addition, Poliwag can run a Substitute + Encore set, as it can trap an opponent into a weak or support move, then set up with Substitute. A Substitute + Hypnosis set may seem viable at first, but Pokemon like Gastly are better options for such a role. Finally, Mind Reader seems like a decent move to accompany Hypnosis, but Poliwag doesn't have the time nor bulk to pull it off.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Mankey is one of the best checks to Poliwag, as it cannot be put to sleep (courtesy of Vital Spirit) and can OHKO Poliwag with Close Combat. Other potential counters to Poliwag must contend with the incapacitating threat of Hypnosis, so it's best to send them in after Sleep Clause has been activated. Most Choice Scarf Pokemon fare well against Poliwag, especially Snover and Chinchou. Wooper is immune to Water and can threaten Poliwag with a STAB Earthquake. Munchlax can take all of Poliwag's special attacks and KO with Return or trap with Pursuit. Because of Poliwag's thin defenses, most neutral attacks will strip off more than half of its health. That, combined with Life Orb recoil and possible Sandstorm/Hail damage, will most likely spell Poliwag's doom.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>At first glance, this set seems like an inferior Staryu or Chinchou, but that is certainly not the case. Poliwag has access to Hypnosis, something most Water-types wish they could have, and is the fastest user of it in Little Cup (tied with Meowth). This allows Poliwag to have its own niche in the metagame, allowing it to stand out amongst the myriad other Water-types in LC. Hydro Pump is a great STAB for Poliwag to have, though its Special Attack is a bit lacking. Hidden Power Electric and Ice Beam pair well together, forming \"BoltBeam\" coverage. Unlike most special sweepers, this set is not directly countered by Munchlax. Even if Hypnosis misses as Munchlax switches in, Poliwag will get another chance to put the menacing blob to sleep. Life Orb is vital to the success of this set, as Poliwag needs to hit as hard as possible. The EVs maximize Poliwag's Special Attack and Speed, and the remaining EVs give Poliwag an extra point in both of its defenses. 200 Special Attack EVs are needed to make up for the IV loss when running Hidden Power Electric. Its HP IV is reduced to 3 so Poliwag only loses 1 HP from Life Orb recoil when it attacks.</p> <p>Though this set is Poliwag's best chance at success in the current metagame, it still has a lot of flaws. To begin with, Poliwag only hits 13 Special Attack, so a bunch of Pokemon will be able to switch in and take an attack or two with ease. In addition, it can be revenge killed by many Choice Scarf sweepers, especially if Poliwag has already put another Pokemon to sleep. Hidden Power Grass is an interesting option on this set, as it still hits most Water-types just as hard as Hidden Power Electric, and gets bonus coverage on Chinchou and Wooper, two surefire counters to this set. However, Poliwag would lose to Mantyke if it doesn't have HP Electric.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Snover resists Poliwag's STAB attack, and can easily OHKO Poliwag with a STAB super effective Energy Ball. For that reason, Munchlax is a great teammate for Poliwag. Its high Special Defense will allow it to switch into Snover with impunity and trap it with Pursuit, or simply go for the jugular with Fire Punch. Munchlax can also handle Chinchou, a Pokemon that counters most Poliwag quite easily. Since this set will also lose to Choice Scarf Mankey and its Vital Spirit, Duskull is a great partner for this set. It can come in on any of Mankey's attacks and threaten it with a Will-O-Wisp.</p>"
      },
      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<p>Though this set is highly risky, Poliwag can become a devastating sweeper given the right support and circumstances. Belly Drum quadruples Poliwag's Attack stat. Encore or Hypnosis are also vital so Poliwag can safely use Belly Drum. Hypnosis is arguably the better option, despite its shaky accuracy. However, Encore can be used to lock Poliwag's opponent into a Water-type attack or a setup move, giving Poliwag a free Belly Drum no matter what they do. Waterfall is a good STAB attack for Poliwag, since it has decent power and a 20% chance of flinching the opponent. In the final slot, Return is the best option, as it grants Poliwag perfect neutral coverage in Little Cup when used in tandem with Waterfall. An Oran Berry is absolutely necessary so Poliwag will be at full health after using Belly Drum. A Jolly nature and 196 Speed EVs are essential because Poliwag needs all the Speed it can get. Attack is also maximized, and the remaining EVs give Poliwag an extra point in both its defenses. Poliwag does not need to invest in HP because it already has 20 (a number divisible by 4) without any investment.</p> <p>Since Poliwag lacks any form of priority, Pokemon with priority can beat this set before Poliwag can set up. Because this set can only be used once per battle, it is imperative to remove priority users like Croagunk and Dratini. Bronzor is a great partner for this purpose, as it can OHKO Croagunk with Psychic and dent Dratini with Hidden Power Ice. Bronzor can also set up Stealth Rock, which effectively removes the Focus Sashes on any Pokemon trying to revenge kill Poliwag; it is a great user of dual screens, which makes Poliwag harder to revenge kill. Rain Dance supporters are also helpful partners, since they can end harmful weather effects and potentially give Poliwag's Waterfall a significant boost. In this case, Voltorb is the premier choice as a supporter, as it can set up Rain Dance and then Explode, allowing Poliwag to get a clean switch in. Gligar is another great choice as a partner, as it is immune to Electric-type attacks. In addition, it can Baton Pass Poliwag an Agility, meaning that Poliwag does not have to invest in Speed. Munchlax can take out special Choice Scarf sweepers with Return or trap them with Pursuit, since Poliwag doesn't have great defenses and can be revenge killed quite easily. Rapid Spinners like Pineco are also good teammates, since it is vital for Poliwag to be at full health when it switches in.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Because of Poliwag's blistering Speed and access to Encore and Hypnosis, it can also function as an efficient anti-lead. If facing a Fake Out user such as Meowth or Aipom, the best idea would be to take the attack, then lock it into the move the next turn with Encore. If facing a Stealth Rock lead like Bronzor, putting it to sleep via Hypnosis on the first turn is the better option. However, Poliwag should just attack if the opposing Pokemon is weak to Waterfall, such as Phanpy and Hippopotas. The Choice Scarf allows Poliwag to beat all Pokemon up to Choice Scarf 19 Speed Pokemon. In addition, this Poliwag set can also function as a defensive pivot mid-game. It can come in on Carvanha's Substitute or any of its Water-type attacks thanks to Water Absorb and Encore it, while it cannot do anything back to Poliwag. It can also come in on Staryu's or Mantyke's Hydro Pump and force them to switch out after Encore. The EVs maximize its Attack and Speed, with the remainder going to HP.</p> <p>Since Poliwag will likely be Encoring the opponent's Water-type attacks, it is imperative that a teammate can also take Water-type attacks well. Water Absorb Mantyke is a good candidate, and although it shares an Electric-type weakness with Poliwag, it can take out the opposing Water-type with Hidden Power Electric or set up on it with Agility. Other setup sweepers are also good options as teammates, since they will appreciate Encored Fake Outs, Substitutes, and Protects. Swords Dance or Rock Polish Gligar is a good teammate, since it is immune to Electric, neutral to Grass, and can increase its stats to crazy heights after just a single boost.</p>"

  "Abra": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Abra is one of Little Cup's most potent sweepers with a monstrous 105 base Special Attack that is matched by no other Pokemon in Little Cup. It also has a superb 90 base Speed, allowing it to outpace or tie with most of the metagame. Abra can also run an effective dual screen set thanks to its aforementioned Speed and access to Encore. Unfortunately, Abra does have its drawbacks, most notably its paper-thin Defense and low HP. It is also weak to common priority attacks, such as Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch, and has a shallow special movepool that prevents it from taking full advantage of its amazing offensive stats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Energy Ball can be used on either the Choice or Substitute sets if your team has a lot of trouble with Chinchou, but it is important to note that a super effective Energy Ball hits with only 25 more Base Power than a neutral Psychic. Energy Ball also provides inferior coverage compared to Signal Beam, so it is generally not advised. Abra also possesses Calm Mind, which gives it the equivalent of a Choice Specs boost, as well as a boost in Special Defense. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to set up and makes Abra vulnerable to revenge killing without a boost in Speed or a Substitute.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>The Substitute set has surprisingly few counters. One of the best would be Munchlax, who is able to shake off a couple of Abra's hits and kill it with any of its attacks. Mantyke also makes a decent counter with the highest Special Defense stat in the Little Cup metagame. However, the best way to stop the Substitute set from doing significant damage to your team is simply to not let it use Substitute. If Abra is not behind a Substitute, it has many more counters. The main one would be priority move users. Abra is very frail and thus cannot take many priority attacks aimed at it. Virtually any Pokemon faster than Abra when it is not behind a Substitute is a counter because most will be able to KO Abra. An example of this would be Elekid, who can outpace and OHKO with Thunder Punch.</p> <p>The only Pokemon that can actually counter the dual screen set are Pokemon that have a fast Taunt or can KO Abra behind Reflect or Light Screen. Even better counters would be Choice Scarf Pokemon that can KO Abra without letting it get one of the screens up. The only Taunt users that can match Abra in Speed are Voltorb, Gligar, Meowth, and Aipom. Voltorb will be the most troublesome as it will always outpace Abra, as opposed to the latter two, with whom Abra ties. Abra can be surprisingly bulky behind screens, so not many Pokemon can take it out in one hit. One example would be Carvanha, who can OHKO Abra with Crunch, even behind Reflect. Choice Scarf Houndour is one Pokemon that absolutely counters the dual screen set because it is able to outpace and OHKO Abra with Dark Pulse, not letting it set up either screen. However, other Choice Scarf-wielding Pokemon that can OHKO Abra are great counters such as Gligar, Cranidos, and Stunky.</p> <p>The Choice set has many more counters if Abra predicts incorrectly. One could switch in a Pokemon who resists or is immune to Abra's attack, forcing Abra to switch out. However, with good prediction the Choice set can be very difficult to beat. Houndour, Carvanha, and Munchlax are probably the set's best counters. The former two can switch in on Psychic thanks to their immunity and either Substitute, Pursuit Abra, or simply kill it. Munchlax can take any of Abra's attacks and KO back.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<p>The goal of this set is to use Abra's awesome power while attempting to get rid of its glaring weakness to priority. If Abra manages to get a Substitute up, it has a good chance of taking down Pokemon who rely on priority to take down Abra, such as Carvanha and Croagunk. Substitute can also be troublesome for slower Pokemon, as it turns potential OHKOs into 2HKOs. This can be helpful if, for example, a weakened Munchlax is trying to take down Abra. Munchlax could be relying on only taking one hit from Abra and instead has to waste a turn taking down Abra's Substitute. Psychic is Abra's main STAB attack, which will hit any Pokemon who isn't resistant or immune to it very hard. The exception to this is Munchlax, with its massive HP and Special Defense. Signal Beam provides excellent coverage alongside Psychic, hitting Dark- and Psychic-types for super effective damage. With the excellent coverage that these two attacks provide, there is hardly anything left to hit. Hidden Power Fire provides super effective coverage on Bronzor, while Hidden Power Ground is almost exclusively for Aron, though it also provides good coverage on Houndour and Magnemite. However, Magnemite is already hit hard by Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>Encore can be an interesting option on this set, as it can provide an excellent opportunity for one of your other sweepers to set up. For example, if Abra Encores a Gligar's Earthquake, it provides a Pokemon such as Mantyke with a free turn of setup. Encore can also aid Abra in setting up a Substitute if Abra manages to Encore a non-attacking move. Life Orb gives even more power to Abra's already powerful attacks, and due to Abra's 19 HP stat, Life Orb only takes 1 HP due to recoil. Inner Focus allows Abra to take Fake Out, a common attack in Little Cup, without flinching. Abra can then either use Substitute, or if it is running Encore, Encore a move that won't work the next turn.</p> <p>Timid is the best option for this set because it allows Abra to tie with the majority of non-Choice Scarf sweepers in Little Cup. The purpose of the EVs on this set is to maximize Abra's sweeping potential by maxing Special Attack and Speed. Due to the IV drop from either Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ground, Abra is forced to add an extra 4 EVs in each stat, making it so that Abra cannot gain a point in any other stat. If you choose to run Encore instead of a Hidden Power you want to run a spread of 76 Def / 236 SpA / 196 Spe. 76 EVs in Special Defense as opposed to Defense is also viable.</p> <p>Two partners who work well with this set are Choice Scarf Gligar and Choice Scarf Mankey. Both have access to U-turn to scout for Abra and both can dispose of Munchlax, a Pokemon who gives Abra a fair bit of trouble.</p> <p>One must be very careful when using this set, as an incorrect prediction can lead to a dead Abra. For example, if Abra attempts to use Substitute on a Choice Scarf Pokemon, anticipating the switch, but instead the Pokemon attacks, Abra will not have enough HP to do much else. It is also very difficult to get a Substitute up with Abra, as many Pokemon will choose to simply attack rather than switch due to Abra's frailty. Abra works better as an early-game sweeper because of this, as the opponent is much more likely to switch when there are more options to switch to. In the late-game, there is a greater chance the opponent will leave his or her Pokemon in, possibly because there is a lack of a better options.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Abra is the fastest user of dual screens in Little Cup. To go along with this, Abra is also tied for being the fastest user of Encore with Poliwag. On paper, Abra seems to be an inferior user due to its very low defenses, but its high Speed can make it very effective. Abra has the ability to very quickly set up screens, often before the opponent even attacks, giving Abra greater staying power and more time to execute its plan. A fast Encore is also very useful against leads with Stealth Rock, as Abra can set up a screen on the first turn, and if the opponent used Stealth Rock, Abra can Encore, forcing the opponent into a worthless move and allowing Abra to get up its second screen. This set functions very well as a lead if one is trying to set up screens as early as possible as well as there being common moves seen from the lead position that Abra can Encore, such as Stealth Rock and Fake Out.</p> <p>Psychic gives Abra an attack on this set, and can still hit very hard despite the lack of Special Attack EVs. Light Clay is chosen so that the screens last 8 turns instead of 5, which can make a very big difference thanks to the fast pace of Little Cup. Inner Focus is very useful particularly against Fake Out leads such as Meowth, as Abra won't flinch. This gives Abra an opportunity to either Encore the lead, making it so that Fake Out will fail next turn, or set up its screen of choice. Timid nature is chosen to help Abra reach the magical 19 Speed without hindering its defenses or Special Attack. The EVs given are to improve Abra's bulk while still keeping it at maximum Speed.</p> <p>This Abra functions best in the lead position, because in most cases, you will want to get up screens as soon as possible. The ability Inner Focus also helps out with Abra being in the lead position, as Fake Out leads are relatively common. Abra doesn't really need any support here; it will be the one supporting other teammates for a sweep. In general, bulky setup sweepers benefit the most from screens, letting them set up and sweep while taking relatively low damage. Good examples of this would be Totodile, Krabby, Dratini, and Bagon. All of them are fairly bulky and can be very difficult to take down behind screens.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Abra can function very well as a Choice user due to the excellent coverage provided by its attacks, and can effectively run Choice Scarf or Choice Specs due to its high Special Attack and Speed. Psychic is Abra's strongest STAB move, and its main attack on this set. Signal Beam provides good coverage alongside Psychic.</p> <p>Choice Scarf is generally the more reliable option with this set, due to the Little Cup metagame being very centralized around Speed. Choice Scarf boosts Abra's Speed to 28 with a Timid nature, matched only by positive natured 83-92 Base Speed Choice Scarf users, such as Gligar, and neutral-natured 93-100 Base Speed Choice Scarf users, such as Diglett, and surpassed only in Speed by 93-100 Speed Pokemon with a positive nature. However, Modest is also a very viable option due to Abra gaining 2 extra points in Special Attack, which can make the difference between winning and losing a battle. It is important to note, however, that you risk tying with 18 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Gastly. Hidden Power Ground is the superior option on this set due to Abra's ability to outpace a +2 Aron, even with a Modest nature. Trick is slightly less effective on this set, as many Pokemon in Little Cup will hardly mind the boost in Speed. However, it is still useful for Pokemon such as Wynaut who lose their effectiveness when locked into a move. Trick can also be useful for Pokemon who may try to set up on Abra, forcing them to switch out, and not allowing them to sweep as effectively.</p> <p>Choice Specs is a fun option with this set as Abra has good Speed, which allows it to run the set effectively, and its Special Attack gets boosted to astronomical levels with the Choice Specs boost. Timid is the only nature to use for this set, as it lets Abra tie with other 19 Speed Pokemon, such as Gligar and Staryu. Hidden Power Fire is generally the better option with Choice Specs, as Abra can hit Bronzor for massive damage, being able to OHKO max HP variants if they lack Special Defense EVs. Trick can be very effective on this set, as it can be a pain for physical attackers, who receive no boost in anything useful, and are forced to lock into an attack.</p> <p>This set demands a high degree of prediction as any Choice set does due to being locked into one attack before switching out. Dark-types are also immune to Abra's strongest attack, making it even more difficult to play with this set. Predicting incorrectly and using Psychic on a switch to Carvanha gives it a free Substitute, which can be a major pain to any team. Also, using Psychic on a Dark-type Pokemon who knows Pursuit, such as Houndour or Stunky, spells instant death for Abra, and Munchlax can also Pursuit Abra while taking low damage from all of Abra's attacks, particularly on sets with Choice Scarf. Because of this, Abra sweeps best if Dark-types and Munchlax are removed from play. The Choice Specs set also greatly appreciates the removal of Choice Scarf users, as they can outpace and potentially KO Abra. Croagunk works well with Abra because of this, as it is able to wear down Choice Scarf users with priority attacks.</p>"

It is an absolute beast with Sunny Day on the field, thanks to its ability Chlorophyll, and should be considered a premier choice as a Sunny Day sweeper. It also has a decent typing, but unfortunately suffers from poor defenses. Though its offensive movepool is poor, it gets just enough coverage for it to succeed. All in all, Bellsprout is a unique Pokemon that should be seen on every Sunny Day team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Energy Ball is a potential Solar Beam replacement on the Special Sunny Day sweeper set. Though Bellsprout would lose out on the potential 2HKO on Munchlax, it wouldn't be completely screwed over if Snover switches in. Bellsprout has access to Sunny Day, but doesn't have the room nor the bulk to use it effectively. This pretty much also goes for the rest of Bellsprout's support movepool - Encore, Reflect, Stun Spore, and Toxic are all great moves, but Bellsprout doesn't have enough bulk to use these moves well.</p> <p>Bellsprout can also run a decent mixed Sunny Day or Choice Scarf set, to act as a decent wallbreaker, but the pure physical/special set is usually going to be better for both. It can run a potential Double Powder set with Sleep Powder and Stun Spore, but again, doesn't have the bulk (or Speed) to use it well. Bellsprout also gets Giga Drain, but the extra power from Energy Ball is preferred.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>As far as counters go, Snover is probably one of the best. As long as it avoids Sludge Bomb on the switch, Snover can smack Bellsprout with a Blizzard. In addition, Snover ends Sunny Day and kicks up hail thanks to its Snow Warning ability, bringing Bellsprout's Speed back down to 14. Hippopotas also ends Sunny Day, but must switch out immediately if it switches into Solar Beam. Gastly beats the special sets if Sleep Powder misses, and even the physical set with some prediction. Mankey is immune to Sleep Powder, and OHKOes Bellsprout with Ice Punch. Choice Scarf Magby and Gligar can both Speed tie Bellsprout in the sun and KO (if they win the tie) with their STAB moves.</p> <p>The best way to beat the physical set is to allow one of your Pokemon to absorb Sleep Powder, and then send in a Bronzor. Aron is also a great answer to physical Bellsprout, as it can set up with Rock Polish and OHKO with Head Smash.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is the most dangerous set Bellsprout is capable of running. Thanks to its Chlorophyll ability, Bellsprout hits 28 Speed in sunlight, which allows it to tie with Timid Choice Scarf Abra. With all that Speed, Bellsprout will easily be able to put an opponent to sleep with Sleep Powder, enabling it to safely set up with Swords Dance. Not many Pokemon can withstand a +2 Seed Bomb, so most will attempt to take Bellsprout out with priority. However, Bellsprout still has a secret weapon at its disposal - Sucker Punch. Since there are essentially zero Pokemon with enough Speed to tie with Bellsprout that carry a priority attack, Bellsprout is extremely hard to revenge kill after a Swords Dance.</p> <p>Life Orb boosts the power of Bellsprout's attacks, which is rather vital because Bellsprout needs as much power as it can get. However, an Oran Berry can be used for longevity, though it is an inferior option. A Jolly nature with 196 Speed EVs is also important, so Bellsprout can hit an unboosted 14 Speed, or 28 with Sunny Day in effect. Attack is also maxed out, and the remainder is put into Special Defense for equal defenses. Since Bellsprout doesn't hit 19 HP, 36 EVs are also put into HP.</p> <p>Synthesis can be used over Sleep Powder, but the free Swords Dance is generally more important. Since this set will lose to Bronzor (although Bellsprout can cripple it with Sleep Powder), Magnemite support is great. Unfortunately, they share a glaring weakness to Fire, which is boosted in the sun. For that reason, a teammate with Flash Fire is important for the effectiveness of Bellsprout and the team. Sunny Day support is necessary, so Bellsprout can double its Speed. Diglett is a reliable lead that can set up Sunny Day. If another Sunny Day sweeper, such as Oddish, has access to Sleep Powder, Return can be used over Sleep Powder to hit Houndour, a Pokemon that beats this set.</p>"

      "Sun Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>While most players think of Bellsprout as primarily a physical sweeper, its Special Attack is also a very formidable weapon. With Sunny Day in play, Bellsprout reaches a ridiculous 28 Speed, easily outpacing the unboosted metagame and most of the +1 speed tier. Solar Beam gets STAB and fires off in one turn when Sunny Day is up, and any Pokemon that doesn't resist it will be taking heavy damage (Solar Beam even has a chance of 2HKOing Munchlax through Oran Berry if Stealth Rock is up). Sludge Bomb is a secondary STAB that pairs well with Solar Beam, as it hits Grass-type Pokemon for super effective damage. Weather Ball is preferred over Hidden Power Fire in the third slot because Weather Ball's Base Power is boosted to 100 with Sunny Day up. Weather Ball allows Bellsprout to beat Bronzor, while Hidden Power Ice hits Hippopotas on the switch for big damage. Finally, the last move boils down to personal preference. Sleep Powder is preferred as it allows Bellsprout to put Snover and other would-be checks to sleep, but Synthesis heals 2/3 of Bellsprout's health in Sunny Day, which is nice as a way to offset the damage from Life Orb and priority attacks. A Life Orb is highly recommended since Bellsprout needs to hit as hard as possible with its attacks. A Timid nature, with 196 EVs, allows Bellsprout to hit 14 Speed, or 28 in Sunny Day. Special Attack is also maximized, and the leftover EVs net you an extra point in both Defense and Special Defense.</p> <p>Since this set loses badly to Munchlax, Pokemon that can quickly dispose of it help greatly. Choice Scarf Mankey and Machop can do this with ease, though they don't really see much use on a Sunny Day team. Obviously, this set requires Sunny Day support in order for it to function properly. Exeggcute is a good Sunny Day lead as it can use Sunny Day followed by Explosion. This will not only hopefully dispose of a Pokemon on your opponent's team, but also give Bellsprout a free switch-in. Ponyta is a quick lead that can set up Sunny Day, and take advantage of it with its STAB sun-boosted Flare Blitz. Munchlax is another good supporter, and can remove Snover, a threat to Sunny Day, with little trouble. In addition, Bellsprout and Munchlax have decent synergy - Bellsprout resists Fighting-type moves, while Munchlax can remove pesky Ghost-types that resist Bellsprout's STAB moves.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Tentacool's stats suggest that it would be a premier special wall in Little Cup. Unfortunately, its weaknesses to Thunderbolt and Earth Power make that generalization not so. Still, Tentacool is one of the quickest users of Rapid Spin in LC, and it has access to Toxic Spikes. Its offensive movepool is no joke either, with access to moves such as Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, and Sludge Bomb. However, it is still underappreciated in Little Cup, as most teams focus on hyper offense, leaving supporting Tentacool to the wolves. But, if taking it slow and drawing out the battle is your cup of tea, definitely consider Tentacool for a team slot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Tentacool can also run a physical Choice Scarf set, but it gets less super effective coverage than the special set does. Tentacool also gets Swords Dance, but its weaknesses to Electric and Ground, two of the most common attacking types in LC, prevent it from being viable. Choice Scarfers would also rain on Swords Dance Tentacool's parade. Tentacool gets Screech, but it's nothing more than an inferior Swords Dance. Tentacool also has Mirror Coat, but it is usually KOed by super effective attacks and cannot trap other Pokemon like Wynaut can outside of using Wrap. Icy Wind can be used as a potential support move, but other support moves are better in most cases. Finally, Tentacool has Confuse Ray, but it is illegal in tandem with Rapid Spin.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Overall, Munchlax is the best check to Tentacool since it takes minimal damage from all of Tentacool's attack and can prey on Tentacool's weaker Defense. Gastly is immune to Rapid Spin and Hidden Power Ground, resists Sludge Bomb, and can beat Tentacool outright using Thunderbolt or its own Hidden Power Ground. That being said, Ghost-types in general fare well against Tentacool, since they all render it useless by blocking Rapid Spin. Bronzor is immune to Sludge Bomb and threatens Tentacool with Psychic and Earthquake - two potent super effective attacks. Finally, the Hidden Power decision is most likely one of the biggest factors when determining a counter to Tentacool - if it does not have Hidden Power Electric, Mantyke can easily set up on Tentacool, but it Tentacool doesn't have Hidden Power Ground, Croagunk will beat Tentacool easily.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Tentacool is one of the fastest users of Rapid Spin, and it has a nice defensive typing that leaves it with only three weaknesses. It is also one of the bulkiest Rapid Spinners in Little Cup, and can be considered to be Pineco's special counterpart. Tentacool also gets Toxic Spikes, and with its Speed and bulk, will most likely be able to get two layers down before it gets KOed. Surf is a powerful and reliable STAB attack that gets fair neutral coverage and does a decent amount of damage, even without maximum investment. The last move is very situational, and should be chosen by what the rest of the team would most appreciate. Sludge Bomb gives Tentacool a decent secondary STAB attack, which pairs well coverage-wise with Surf. However, Hidden Power Ground smacks Croagunk, a Pokemon that would easily wall this setfor super effective damage.</p> <p>Sweepers that enjoy having Stealth Rock removed do well alongside Tentacool. Houndour loves not losing HP on the switch, and Tentacool can take a Fighting-type attack or two for Houndour. Since Croagunk beats this set unless Hidden Power Ground is being run, Bronzor is a good teammate. Not only can Bronzor beat Croagunk without breaking a sweat, but it also can set up Stealth Rock. Gligar is one of the best teammates to pair with Tentacool, as it is immune to two of Tentacool's weaknesses (Electric and Ground). Spinblockers are also good teammates so Toxic Spikes can stay on the field for as long as possible. Duskull is a good candidate for the role and can spread burn via Will-O-Wisp to those immune to Toxic Spikes. Knock Off is another option that can remove an important item (like Munchlax's Oran Berry) and reduce the potency of those Pokemon. The Bold nature and EVs attempt to remedy Tentacool's lousy Defense. There is no investment in Tentacool's Special Defense since it's already naturally high.</p>"

    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Geodude is often in the shadows of its fellow Speed-boosting Rock-types Rhyhorn and Larvitar. The ultimate proof of Geodude's distinction from its counterparts is when it uses Explosion on the many physically defensive Pokemon that Rhyhorn and Larvitar can't touch. In addition to this, Geodude also has Sucker Punch in its arsenal to check faster threats such as Gastly. Overall, Geodude has a few advantages over the other Rock-types that give it a comfortable niche in the Little Cup metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Geodude has a couple of nifty moves it can use, such as Thunder Punch, Curse, and Counter. Thunder Punch can fit in on the Rock Polish set to damage Water-types on the switch. Curse could further boost its already-high Defense stat and its Attack stat, but it doesn't have the Special Defense stat to constantly take special hits although Curse with Sucker Punch is possible to bypass the lowered speed brought on by Curse. Counter can work well if Geodude can load up on its HP and Defensive stats to grab a surprise kill. Geodude can run a Choice Band set as well with Sucker Punch / Explosion / Earthquake / Stone Edge. If Geodude is looking to increase its physical defense by two points, it can go with the EV spread 196 Atk / 116 Def / 196 Spe.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Bronzor is the safest switch-in to Geodude for the most part with the one exception of when Geodude packs Life Orb. Bronzor resists every single hit except for Fire Punch, and can 2HKO back with Flash Cannon. Geodude will switch out for the most part, and this will allow Bronzor to take advantage of the extra turn to set up Stealth Rock or dual screens.</p> <p>Geodude's Speed is pretty discouraging and any faster Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-types can be considered counters (assuming Geodude has not set up Rock Polish yet). If Geodude lacks Explosion, bulky Ground-types like Phanpy, Hippopotas, and Gligar can check Geodude pretty well, and the former three can strike back with Earthquake for a possible OHKO. Mantyke and Chinchou can scare away Geodude with Surf, and can take advantage of the free turn to use Agility. Choice Scarf Mankey can outpace the Rock Polish set and threaten Geodude with Close Combat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Geodude is capable of running a utility set thanks to its high Defense stat. The basic premise of this set is to come in on something that can't touch Geodude, like physical Meowth (watch out for the rare Water Pulse!), and use Stealth Rock on the switch out. After setting up Stealth Rock, the next set of turns depends on which attack Geodude uses. Sucker Punch lets it combat faster threats, while Explosion gives it a powerful move to use against physically-defensive Pokemon like Phanpy, Gligar, and Hippopotas. Earthquake hits Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage.</p> <p>There are two moves that set Geodude apart from Rhyhorn: Sucker Punch and Explosion. Sucker Punch is an excellent move against frailer Pokemon who try to pick Geodude off at low health. Explosion makes a great finishing move after using Stealth Rock, that allows the next Pokemon to come in safely. Earthquake is Geodude's obligatory STAB move which allows it to hit Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage. This includes Cranidos, Aron, and Shieldon. Stone Edge can be an option over Earthquake, but this leaves Geodude helpless when facing Aron.</p> <p>Water-type threats such as Mantyke and Chinchou can threaten Geodude. A Chinchou of your own can handle these threats. As an added bonus, Chinchou's convenient resistances to Ice- and Water-type moves allow it to come in on hits directed toward Geodude. Duskull also works well alongside Geodude because it is immune to Ground- and Fighting-type hits. Duskull can cripple many physical threats like Gligar and Mankey with Will-O-Wisp.</p>"
      },
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>With its access to high-powered STAB moves, Explosion, and a high Defense stat to handle priority, Geodude can make for a dangerous Rock Polish sweeper that can plow through teams. While Geodude's Speed isn't remarkable to begin with, one Rock Polish brings it up to 22, which is enough to outrun every Pokemon who doesn't carry Choice Scarf. Geodude has multiple opportunities to use Rock Polish despite its middling Speed, as its typing and great defensive stats allow it to set up on many Pokemon. The moves are quite basic: Stone Edge and Earthquake are there for dual STAB and impressive coverage, while Explosion makes an excellent finishing move.</p> <p>Geodude is blessed with high-powered STAB moves to work with, as Rock- and Ground-type attacks provide near-perfect coverage, and are only resisted by Bronzor and Baltoy. Stone Edge deals huge amounts of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Earthquake complements Stone Edge, as it hits Steel-types for super effective damage. The final slot is given to Explosion. It is often said that Larvitar and Rhyhorn greatly outclass Geodude as a Rock Polish user; however, Geodude's niche is dealing huge amounts of damage with Explosion, which provides Geodude with a powerful move to OHKO physically-defensive Pokemon such as Gligar, Phanpy, and Hippopotas. Take note that Explosion will miss out on OHKOing Hippopotas and Phanpy on the spot, however.</p> <p>Oran Berry can be used over Life Orb to help Geodude set up much easier. However, 18 Attack without Life Orb will greatly hinder Geodude's sweeping capabilities. Chople Berry can be used over Life Orb to lure in Croagunk. The given EVs provide at least a single point in each stat, except for Special Attack.</p> <p>Bronzor is one of the best Geodude counters because it resists both of its STAB moves and can take Geodude down with Flash Cannon. It is advised that Geodude pair up with a strong Fire-type like Magby or Ponyta in order to keep Bronzor at bay as much as possible. Dratini does an excellent job as well because it can take away a huge portion of Bronzor's health with a boosted Waterfall or Fire Blast.</p> <p>The most common defensive Pokemon that switches in on Geodude is Gligar. Anyone who appreciates having Gligar removed from the match are considered excellent offensive partners to keep alongside Geodude, since it will usually lure and KO Gligar with Explosion. Most players rely on Gligar as a defensive backbone on their team, and once Gligar is removed, teams are usually open to threats like Choice Scarf Machop, Aron, and Croagunk. The former three make exceptional offensive partners as they take advantage of Gligar removed from the match.</p> <p>Super effective priority moves will trouble Geodude and can OHKO it or leave its HP depleted. Croagunk, Snover, and Carvanha threaten Geodude with their respective priority moves. Wynaut, Gligar, and Munchlax can handle these Pokemon well. Wynaut does a flawless job of checking Choice Scarf Carvanha and Snover, as Wynaut can trap and kill them with Counter or Mirror Coat.</p>"

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>This set is another testament as to why Geodude is not entirely outclassed by its Rock-type brethren. Despite its low Speed, Geodude can punch holes on many teams with its fantastic dual STAB moves, and utilize Sucker Punch to deal with faster foes. However, the tried-and-true strategy of this set is to lure in Bronzor, a common switch-in to Geodude. Bronzor will have to be extra cautious when switching in on Geodude, because a predicted Stone Edge followed up by Fire Punch will spell doom for it. Earthquake provides extra coverage and another STAB. Explosion can go over Earthquake if you'd prefer to guarantee yourself a free KO.</p> <p>The final slot ultimately depends on what benefits your team most. Earthquake smacks Steel- and Rock-types around for super effective damage, and provides optimal coverage alongside Stone Edge. However, Explosion is always a superb option over Earthquake to deal huge amounts of damage to bulkier Pokemon like Gligar, Hippopotas, and Phanpy on the switch thereby opening holes for fellow teammates to sweep. Including Explosion over Earthquake is not a significant loss, as Fire Punch alone provides decent coverage alongside Stone Edge.</p> <p>Geodude is one of the best Bronzor lures out there, and as such, anyone who values Bronzor's removal from the match are considered good offensive partners. Taillow, Dratini, Gible, Bagon, Eevee, and Doduo benefit from Bronzor's removal, as it makes their sweeps sufficiently easier.</p> <p>Gligar's high Defense stat and unique typing make it an ideal check to Geodude. Pairing Geodude with someone who can take Ground-type hits like Duskull and Gligar can be very accommodating for Geodude. Wynaut is also a possible partner who can dispatch Gligar from the match by trapping it. As an added bonus, Wynaut also covers a number of Fighting-type threats who also threaten Geodude. Water-types like Mantyke are a major threat to Geodude, and partnering it with Chinchou ensures they don't get out of hand.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Thanks in-part to its Defense, Own Tempo, and reliable recovery in Slack Off, Slowpoke has found itself a niche as the premier Machop counter in the game, and, with that, Slowpoke also functions as an effective tank. Slowpoke's main advantage as a Fighting-type counter over Ghost-types is that they do not have reliable recovery moves. It also has options to support the team as a whole, most notably Thunder Wave and Trick Room. With its poor Speed and the lack of viable Pokemon who can set up Trick Room, Slowpoke proves vital for the setup of the field effect. Unfortunately, with the advantages its Speed brings, it is also one of its biggest disadvantages when considering bulky Water-types for your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Unfortunately, Slowpoke does not have many other moves that are viable. It learns Yawn, which can be used with Slack Off or Thunder Wave to support its team. However, this is much less effective than the other move choices and gives it a case of the tragic \"four moveslot syndrome.\" Slowpoke can also utilize a Choice Band, though it is extremely easy to take advantage of this set due to its low Speed.</p> <p>Even though it has a weaker Special Attack, Slowpoke can make the change from physical to special without too many issues with Surf and Psychic as your attacking options. The benefit of doing this is simple; Slowpoke is much more reliable hitting from the special side. This reliability allows Slowpoke to be more solid in doing its job. Also, by hitting from the special side, Slowpoke is more able to take out Krabby and Gligar due to their lower Special Defense stats. Unfortunately, Slowpoke's Special Attack is a full three points lower than its Attack, meaning that it lacks the same punch as its physical moves have. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference when you chose what side to attack from. If you choose to attack specially, an EV spread of 36 HP / 236 Def / 196 SpA / 36 SpD and a Modest nature is the best choice for the Physical Tank, while the Trick Room set's EVs may stay the same.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Though one of Slowpoke's greatest assets, its Speed is one of its greatest problems. This Speed allows Slowpoke to be outsped by nearly the entire Little Cup metagame, making it extremely easy to revenge kill and take advantage of it. Any Ghost can take advantage of Slowpoke's typing in order to hit it with a super effective Shadow Ball, and in the case of Duskull, cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Elekid can abuse its Electric-typing to rid of Slowpoke with any of its STABs. Houndour can use either Crunch or Dark Pulse to OHKO Slowpoke while outspeeding it. Carvanha is a large problem for Slowpoke, as it not only resists its Water-typed STABs, but it is immune to Zen Headbutt. Paras can switch in on any Aqua Tail and with its ability, Dry Skin, use Spore or X-Scissor on the helpless Pokemon. Bronzor doesn't mind paralysis and can shrug off Slowpoke's attacks with ease. If Slowpoke is without Thunder Wave, Krabby poses a huge threat to Slowpoke and your entire team by easily being able to set up Swords Dance and Agility.</p>",

Zen Headbutt provides great coverage with Aqua Tail, and serves as another important move for this set's success by denting the common Choiced Fighting-types for super effective damage. Slack Off provides safe, reliable recovery for when your Oran Berry is finally disposed of. The choice between supporting team and yourself is up to personal preference. Thunder Wave cripples the opponent's switch-in and provides support to slower sweepers on your team; however, Protect is a valuable option for its ability to scout the opponent's team and a switch-in's attacks.</p> <p>Though it does its job very well, Slowpoke can be easily stopped by a Pokemon who can take advantage of its abysmal Speed.

To combat these two, a Scarfed Gligar is recommended to take care of these threats. Snover also causes problems for Slowpoke, though Bronzor and Munchlax can deal with it. Bronzor itself is a Pokemon Slowpoke has trouble dealing with, as it can easily set up anything it wants on Slowpoke without taking much damage.

Porygon is a great candidate for Trick Room, as it cannot only hit from the special side with a powerful STAB Tri Attack, but it can also go mixed using Return. Krabby makes a good candidate thanks to its powerful Crabhammer and ability to boost its Attack with Swords Dance.

Charge Beam can be used to attempt a sweep late game, but its downside is Magnemite's low Speed.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>The single best counter to Magnemite is Porygon. It can Trace Magnemite's Magnet Pull, thus preventing Magnemite from escaping, and then use a Recover/attack strategy to slowly destroy Magnemite. Porygon can also use Trick Room to turn Magnemite's Choice Scarf into a liability. However, Porygon must beware of the Attacker set because the damage output will bypass the health healed from Recover. Munchlax can also beat Magnemite due to its high Special Defense stat and access to Earthquake. Both Porygon and Munchlax must beware of Explosion, however.

This set, however, will take a battering from specially-offensive variants of Bronzor due to the reduction in Special Defense, even with its resistances. Thunderbolt is Magnemite's STAB move and provides good coverage. Flash Cannon is a secondary STAB attack, and is used to hit Gligar and Dratini as hard as possible. Hidden Power Ground can be used to do more damage to Electric-types, most notably Chinchou, while Hidden Power Grass allows Magnemite to hit Ground-types, such as Phanpy, harder. Lastly, Explosion is a great last resort move to defeat Pokemon that wall Magnemite, such as Munchlax.</p> <p>This set is a great counter to Dragon Dance Dratini, one of the biggest threats in the current Little Cup metagame; in addition to its resistance to Extreme Speed, Magnemite is able to outspeed Dratini even after a Dragon Dance and proceed to beat it with Flash Cannon or Hidden Power Ice.

Snover is also a helpful teammate, as it is quite good for dealing with Chinchou, another Pokemon that Magnemite must sacrifice itself in order to beat; it can Energy Ball for an OHKO while not taking much damage from any of Chinchou's attacks. If you predict a Gligar switch-in, Magnemite can eliminate it with Hidden Power Ice. As such, Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Gligar, such as Scarf Machop and Mankey, are good teammates; once Gligar is out, they can easily use Dynamic Punch and Close Combat respectively to sweep without repercussions. An alternative EV spread of 240 SpA / 240 Spe could be used if you want Magnemite to outrun more Pokemon, though the loss of bulk could prove problematic. With that EV spread, a Naive nature is recommended so that Magnemite reaches 15 Speed, thus outspeeding common threats that sit at 14 Speed.</p>"

  "Doduo": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Doduo can perform very well at what it does, being the proud owner of the standard combination of moves granted by both of its types, a useful priority move, and the ability to simply stomp its way through weakened teams with whatever it happens to be running. Sadly for Doduo, its usage is hampered slightly by the presence of Taillow, who can run almost identical movesets but has greater Speed (which in Little Cup can make or break a sweeper), as well as Guts and Facade to compensate for Doduo's slightly higher Attack. Despite the competition, Doduo is undeniably an excellent Pokemon in Little Cup, and is not overshadowed by any means; Doduo's higher Attack and slightly better overall defenses, the ability to use Liechi Berry, Flail, and Roost, as well as freedom from self-inflicted status damage, gives it advantages over Taillow in many situations. Underestimate it at your own peril.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Doduo can use Choice items fairly well, something Taillow cannot do, but more often than not getting locked into a Normal-type move is asking for disaster. As previously mentioned, Doduo has little in the way of alternative moves. Drill Peck is an option if you dislike Brave Bird's recoil and Pluck's low Base Power, but is quite average compared to them. Steel Wing allows Doduo to hit Rock-types, but its low power coupled with low damage output against common Rock-types means Doduo is usually better off using Hidden Power. Doduo also has Endeavor, which can be used alongside Quick Attack and Focus Sash for a gimmick combination. Lastly, Pursuit can be used to revenge kill Choice-locked Ghosts.</p> <p>All you really need to do for Doduo is max out its Attack and Speed, since both stats max out at 236 EVs, and none of its other stats gain a point with the leftover 36 EVs. If you are using Hidden Power Fighting, Doduo loses a point in Speed, so a Naive nature should be used to make up for it. Likewise, if you are using Hidden Power Grass, Doduo loses a point in Attack, so you may want to use a Naughty nature to retain its original Attack. A 29 HP IV allows Doduo to reach 19 HP, letting Doduo take minimum damage from Life Orb, though it does interfere with Hidden Power slightly. If you are using a Substitute + Flail set, 76 EVs in HP gives Doduo a HP stat of 21, allowing it to create four Substitutes with 1 HP remaining.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Far and away the best counters are Steel-types, which resist both of Doduo's STAB moves and usually have naturally high Defense. Bronzor comes to mind as a premier choice, especially considering that it is not bothered by Hidden Power Fighting. Beldum should also be noted as a check, if only for sake of completeness. Magnemite, too, can survive a Hidden Power and OHKO with STAB Thunderbolt. Aron and Shieldon take practically nothing from Doduo's STAB attacks and have their own STAB Rock-type attacks to kill Doduo with, but must be wary of Hidden Power Fighting, as it will OHKO both the majority of the time. Rock-types are next on the list, with naturally great Defense and super effective STAB, though they usually have less than impressive Special Defense stats and must watch out for Hidden Power. Faster Ghosts can come in on Return or Quick Attack and hit Doduo with Thunderbolt, though they need to watch out for Brave Bird or Pluck on the switch. Lastly, Doduo is quite frail and easily revenge killed, and even with Quick Attack taken for granted there are a number of Pokemon faster than it that easily revenge kill it, such as Elekid, Staryu, and Abra. Most Choice Scarf users also outrun it, and priority users such as Houndour and Machop can all come in on a weakened Doduo and revenge kill after it has made a kill, though they must watch out for Quick Attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>Doduo boasts decent Speed and Attack, useful STAB moves, and decent coverage, allowing it to function as a fast, physical sweeper. This variant of Doduo aims to sweep, clearing up weakened teams late-game with its powerful STAB moves, while relying on priority to prevent revenge kills by faster foes. Return is the standard Normal-type STAB move, and is a good one at that: with reasonable power, perfect accuracy, and no recoil effects, you will find Doduo using it more than any of its other moves, not only because it has a great deal of neutral coverage, but also because it is Doduo's most reliable attack. Double-Edge is a more powerful but also more risky alternative to Return; it can make the difference between an OHKO and a 2HKO, but lacks Return's long-term reliability. However, it is illegal alongside Brave Bird, and as Brave Bird does not have as reliable an alternative as Double-Edge has, it is usually the more worthwhile investment. For a secondary STAB option, Brave Bird is Doduo's most powerful choice, and as mentioned previously there are few worthwhile alternatives. Pluck is one, allowing you to steal Oran Berries from walls such as Bronzor and Gligar that come in to make your life difficult. While not as powerful as Brave Bird, it can make your life much easier should you happen to catch them on the switch, not only preventing them from healing, but also healing Doduo in the process.</p> <p>Quick Attack allows Doduo to escape the priority death trap from Pokemon such as Croagunk and Machop that may try to bait Doduo into using Brave Bird, and also allows for an assured end to weakened foes that may be carrying priority. STAB Quick Attack from Doduo can really hurt, and can allow Doduo to act as a fairly good revenge killer. Doduo shares the pain of many Normal / Flying Pokemon in that the Steel- and Rock-types that inhabit Little Cup really make its life a trial, since they resist both of its STAB moves while being naturally very defensive, and Doduo has barely anything to hit back at them with. However, given the low Special Defense of most of the Rock-types in Little Cup, Hidden Power Fighting, even off Doduo's pathetic Special Attack stat, does a lot of damage to many of them, most importantly Aron, who 4x resists both of Doduo's STAB moves. Aron is OHKOed and other Pokemon, such as Onix and offensive Rhyhorn, are 2HKOed. On the other hand, Hidden Power Grass OHKOes Onix and Rhydon, as well as almost always OHKOing Omanyte and Kabuto, though it does not do as much to Aron. Hidden Power Ice is also an option if you are worried about Gligar, OHKOing offensive variants and almost always doing the same to defensive ones.</p> <p>The EVs and nature are incredibly straightforward, with simple sweeper EVs for maximum effectiveness at its job, and a defense-lowering nature to avoid spoiling the power of Hidden Power Fighting. Naughty grants greater attacking power, but Naive grants greater Speed, which can make the difference between death and survival, though the choice is really up to personal preference. Ordinarily, 236 EVs would be sufficient to maximize both Attack and Speed on Doduo; however, due to the lowered IVs from using Hidden Power, 240 EVs are given in each stat to ensure that, whatever Hidden Power you decide to use, Doduo's Attack and Speed are always maximized.</p> <p>Stealth Rock, despite being resisted by most of Doduo's counters, is as useful as ever to break the common Focus Sashes seen around Little Cup. Doduo is frail even without a defense-lowering nature, and taking into account Stealth Rock damage, Life Orb damage, and Brave Bird recoil, Doduo will not be surviving for long against a team that can potentially hit back. Rapid Spin support can help salvage some bulk, allowing Doduo to come in unscathed, and thus giving it more of a lifeline to hang on should it be struck by a weaker attack or require extra turns of Life Orb recoil in which to do damage. This cannot disguise the fact that Doduo is very prone to revenge killing, particularly from Pokemon such as Scarf Gastly or Scarf Cranidos, both of whom do not mind Quick Attack. You should make sure that you can deal with these threats to Doduo, as being unable to do so is often fatal to both Doduo and your team. As for what Doduo cannot take down through sheer force, Pokemon that resist its STAB moves are the main culprits, in particular those Rock- and Steel-types that do not mind Hidden Power Fighting. Bronzor is the best check around, and Doduo does not like being on the receiving end of a Hidden Power Ice or Psychic. To deal with it, you should take advantage of its sole weakness, Fire-type moves; Houndour beats Bronzor that lack Earthquake. Krabby can take any of its attacks and reply in kind with STAB Crabhammer, as well as easily taking on the Rock-types that also plague Doduo. In the case of Magnemite, Diglett can trap and easily OHKO assuming it does not use Magnet Rise on the switch.</p>"
      },
      "3 Attacks + Roost": {
        "description": "<p>While Roost may seem like a waste of a moveslot on Doduo given its lack of bulk, running Roost comes with a lot of bonuses to Doduo that more than make up for the lost coverage. It is an extremely useful move in the right circumstances, as Doduo often accumulates a very large amount of residual damage thanks to Stealth Rock, Life Orb, and recoil from Brave Bird or Double-Edge. Furthermore, Roost removes Doduo's unfortunate weaknesses to Rock-, Electric-, and Ice-type moves, and provides it with a non-damaging move to avoid Sucker Punch. For the other three moves, Brave Bird and Double-Edge are very powerful and their recoil effect is negated by Roost, as previously mentioned, although since you can only use one of them as they are illegal together, Pluck and Return are still perfectly viable options.</p> <p>The EV spread is the standard max Attack and Speed. The choice of an Adamant or Jolly nature is entirely up to whether you feel the need for more Speed or more Attack. Lastly, if you decide to run a 29 HP IV, Doduo reaches 19 HP, which means that Life Orb will only deduct 1 HP per attack. However, this loss in HP can be critical against Bronzor that invest in Special Attack as well as for taking other neutral hits.</p> <p>The most obvious benefit of Roost is negating the residual damage built up on Doduo. While healing with Roost wastes a turn, it allows Doduo to remain a force for much longer in the battle. While it may seem optimistic to the point of foolishness to try to heal a weakened Doduo at any point, it should be noted that Doduo's presence will often force the opponent to switch, usually to a Pokemon such as Bronzor, whom Doduo can do very little against, and thus it is often a better policy to Roost on the switch. Aside from this, Roost can allow Doduo to beat its usual counters, most notably Bronzor, who has a good chance to fail to 2HKO with Gyro Ball, Psychic, or Hidden Power Ice, allowing Doduo to outstall it with Roost and slowly wear it down over time with repeated attacks. Another great advantage gained by using Roost is the ability to evade Sucker Punch, one of the most common forms of priority. While Doduo has priority of its own, it may not always be enough to avoid a revenge kill, especially with Pokemon such as Diglett. Lastly, although by using Roost you remove Doduo's Rock, Ice, and Electric weaknesses, enabling Doduo to occasionally heal on unSTABed attacks of these types from slower Pokemon, this is a rare occurrence and the users of these moves will often have enough power to cause serious injury to the frail Doduo even without a weakness to prey on.</p> <p>Stealth Rock support helps greatly to stop Focus Sash teams from interfering. The biggest difference between this Doduo and most others is the presence of Roost and the absence of a last coverage move. This fact makes Doduo a lot more vulnerable to Pokemon that resist its STAB moves, particularly Rock-type Pokemon such as Geodude and Onix. While these are not commonly seen, it may be wise to accompany Doduo with something that has little trouble against them, such as Staryu or Machop, both of whom can OHKO most Rock-types with their STAB moves.</p>"

With that said, it does have one unique perk that merits its usage: it is the only Pokemon in Little Cup that learns the combination of Aqua Jet, Ice Shard, and Fake Out. If you are going to use Seel, then do so only after looking at whether or not another Pokemon does the intended job better.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Seel, as a result of its natural sturdiness, can also attempt to fill a supporting role. There are many Pokemon with better defenses, but there are few that can reliably use Encore. With Encore, Seel can open the way for a very dangerous sweep for Pokemon like Gastly (when Encoring a Grass-type move) or Chinchou (when Encoring an Electric-type move) by allowing them to come in on a move that they are resistant or immune to.</p> <p>Seel's other ability, Hydration, isn't as useful in the fast paced metagame of Little Cup. If used on a Rain Dance team, it may be able to fit the role of a support Pokemon. If you would like to use Seel in this way, a set comprising of Encore / Rain Dance / Substitute / Waterfall can be annoying to your opponent and has the appeal of being able to potentially shut down Lileep.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Seel finds it difficult to lay serious damage on other Water-type Pokemon. Due to its unique typing, Chinchou gets a special mention for being able to resist Seel's STAB attacks and threaten with its own. Pokemon that are immune to Water-type attacks, such as Paras and Mantyke, can come in and force Seel out. Paras, however, has to be wary of Ice Shard. That said, any Pokemon that takes little damage from Water-type attacks should stand a good chance of countering Seel, especially if it happens to be carrying a move Seel is weak to. As most Seel don't run Hydration, Duskull is also a decent counter due to its ability to take Seel's attacks fairly well and burn it with a crippling Will-O-Wisp. On that note, any Ghost carrying Will-O-Wisp can counter Seel decently thanks to the free entry given by a predicted Fake Out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Priority Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Having a variety of different priority moves is an amazing niche for Seel. With Fake Out, Aqua Jet, and Ice Shard, Seel is able to get two hits for the price of one without the opposing Pokemon being able to touch it. Ice Shard differentiates Seel from other Aqua Jet users, allowing it to deal with threats such as Croagunk and Paras, which would normally wall Pokemon that rely solely on Aqua Jet for priority.</p> <p>The Speed EVs may seem wasteful, but with the given EVs, Seel is able to Speed tie with other priority move-using Pokemon in the 14 speed tier. An alternative EV spread of 236 Atk / 236 Def / 36 SpD, which is based more around bulk, is available and should be used if your team already has a way to deal with priority Croagunk. When using this set, keep in mind that Seel is in no way a priority sweeper, as it lacks the raw power that other priority sweepers have; it is instead only a revenge killer.</p> <p>As a revenge killer, Seel needs to be able to come in more than once; residual damage from entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes will gradually add up to cause Seel's death. Therefore, Pineco makes a good partner due to its resistance to Grass-type attacks and access to Rapid Spin. Baltoy may be weak to Grass-type attacks, but it has an immunity to Electric-type attacks and, like Pineco, the ability to Rapid Spin. Lastly, Croagunk makes a good partner in crime. It resists Seel's weakness Grass-type attacks and can help Seel finish off weakened opponents, as it has reliable priority moves as well. Croagunk is also immune to Water-type attacks, and Seel has difficulty hurting Water-types.</p>"

Shadow Sneak provides Grimer with priority, and allows it to pick off weakened Pokemon. Fire Punch aids Grimer in dealing with Steel-type Pokemon that wall the rest of the set, while Ice Punch lets Grimer nail Gligar on the switch. If Grimer has Poison Jab instead of Gunk Shot in the first slot, Ice Punch also provides a strong, reliable answer to Dratini, but otherwise it is unnecessary for that purpose, as a neutral Gunk Shot packs more power than a super effective Ice Punch.

It does have a pretty decent movepool, however, and can function as a good supporter because of its access to Rapid Spin.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Unfortunately, Shellder's movepool is quite small, which means there aren't many other options for it. It has Payback for Ghost-types, but it's liable to get OHKOed or 2HKOed by a Thunderbolt from Drifloon or Gastly, and has to watch for the Attack drop from a possible Will-O-Wisp. Icy Wind is an option to cut an opponent's Speed so Shellder can pull off a kill before it goes down; it also eases prediction to an extent.

Chinchou can switch into Surf all day long, but it must be wary of Rock Blast and a potential Explosion.

Electric-types in general are good checks, but they cannot switch in directly without a secondary typing that resists one of Shellder's attacks. Water-types such as Mantyke and Wailmer that are normally seen carrying Hidden Power Electric or Hidden Power Grass are also good checks to Shellder. Status is annoying because it hinders Shellder's ability to function properly; for example, a burn stops Rock Blast from doing good damage to most neutral threats.

With its sky-high Defense, Onix can laugh at the attacks Meowth and other Fake Out leads rely on to cause damage, while Onix sets up and starts firing off attacks. Onix can attack with either Earthquake or Stone Edge, as both receive the STAB boost and provide excellent coverage. In the final move slot, Explosion can get Onix a surprise kill once it has finished its job, while Taunt can stop every lead bar Diglett, Gligar, and Anorith from setting up entry hazards.</p> <p>While Onix is one of the more reliable leads in Little Cup, some common leads stop it cold. Snover deserves mention as it can OHKO Onix with Blizzard and negate Onix's Focus Sash due to hail damage. Munchlax is your best option against Snover, thanks to its Thick Fat ability and access to Fire Punch. Machop can use a combination of Dynamic Punch and Bullet Punch to halt Onix in its tracks. Unfortunately, Machop is much harder to deal with due to the confusion that Dynamic Punch brings, though Bronzor is a fairly safe bet with its STAB Psychic. Kabuto and Diglett are also problematic as they can set up and take Onix out with superior Speed or priority moves. Both will be left with 1 HP after Earthquake and the activation of Focus Sash, so any form of priority can deal with these two threats. Onix can use Protect over Explosion or Taunt in order to save itself against Aipom, but this allows Gligar to outclass Onix, as Onix's major advantage over Gligar is its access to Explosion.</p>"

  "Drowzee": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Of the Psychic-types in Little Cup, Drowzee stands out as a Pokemon who can fulfill many roles for a team, but not all at the same time, or as well as more dedicated Pokemon. While it doesn't have the sweeping capabilities of Abra, or the solid bulk of Slowpoke, Drowzee holds a niche in being a physically-inclined Psychic-type, and has an above-average movepool at its disposal.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Drowzee has a surprisingly wide movepool, but most of these options tend to be outclassed by other Pokemon. For example, it has access to Nasty Plot and a decent movepool it use it with, but Croagunk tends to perform this role better due to its high Special Attack and access to priority in Vacuum Wave. Drowzee can use both protective screens, but bulkier Pokemon such as Bronzor (who has better typing) are usually better. Drowzee's status options are also better done by other Pokemon such as Slowpoke.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Oddly enough, Drowzee is quite the tough nut to crack, even though it doesn't have much defense. Strong attacks in general will overcome the Hypnosis Pokemon as it lacks consistent recovery that walls such as Gligar can boast. In particular, Ghost-types such as Gastly and Drifloon cause problems with STAB super effective Ghost-type attacks and their access to Trick. Stunky can easily counter Drowzee with Sucker Punch, but must watch out if it has a Substitute. Taunt will cause problems for most Drowzee sets, nullifying its attempt to use support moves or set up a Substitute. Drowzee is quite weak offensively if not hitting with a super effective move, so Pokemon such as Stunky who are immune to Drowzee's STAB Zen Headbutt and take neutral damage from other attacks are good counters.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<p>What sets Drowzee apart from its Psychic counterparts is its plethora of physical moves, which its fellow Psychic-types such as Spoink and Slowpoke do not receive, or cannot use effectively. Substitute and Focus Punch are the most important moves on this set, with Drowzee finding opportunities to use Substitute against Choiced Fighting-type moves and many other attacks it can shrug off with its good defenses. Once safely behind a Substitute, the strategy is simple - pound most of the metagame into oblivion with Focus Punch, and defeat those who resist Focus Punch with the last two moves. Zen Headbutt is a surprisingly powerful move, OHKOing walls such as Koffing and annihilating Croagunk. Ice Punch 2HKOes Gligar, who will never OHKO Drowzee with Earthquake. Reflect is another option to further sponge physical hits, but generally type coverage gains more precedence.</p> <p>Drowzee's base 48 Attack isn't astounding, so using an Oran Berry is recommended to make Drowzee survive longer, as Muscle Band doesn't score any more KOs or 2HKOs. Although you could use a Muscle Band, Oran Berry is usually more reliable. Life Orb is another option, though it doesn't gain any significant KOs that Muscle Band does not. When using an Oran Berry, an Impish or Careful nature is also viable to further boost Drowzee's Defense and Special Defense respectively. The other elemental punches are possible replacements for Ice Punch, but should only be used if your team has particular problems with Mantyke or Paras (though Drowzee shouldn't really be staying in on the latter). Not many Pokemon use Psychic-type moves, and the only other is Bronzor, who doesn't resist Focus Punch.</p> <p>20 Speed EVs allow Drowzee to outrun Phanpy and 2HKO it with Ice Punch; the remaining EVs give Drowzee as much physical power as possible, while increasing its survivability with defensive EVs. This set in particular pairs well with Croagunk - Drowzee can switch into Psychic-type attacks aimed at the poison frog, while Croagunk can switch into Bug- and Dark-type attacks aimed at Drowzee. They also pair well strategically - Drowzee creates massive holes with Focus Punch, and priority-based Croagunk will mop up the rest with a combination of Fake Out, Vacuum Wave, or Sucker Punch.</p>"

        "description": "<p>This set uses Drowzee's low Speed to abuse Trick Room; when it's set up, not much can stop Drowzee in Trick Room, especially with its decent physical movepool and average Attack stat. Zen Headbutt is its strongest STAB attack, hitting Bellsprout hard, while Fire Punch hits Pokemon such as Bronzor super effectively. Thunder Punch can defeat common Water-types such as Mantyke and Buizel, and it also hits Flying-types super effectively.</p> <p>An Oran Berry allows Drowzee to survive longer, as it isn't the most bulky Pokemon. The defensive EVs help Drowzee withstand attacks from more defensive Pokemon who can take Drowzee's physical attacks. The 0 Speed IVs make Drowzee as slow as possible, making it faster in Trick Room.</p> <p>Instead of Fire Punch, Ice Punch can be used to OHKO Gligar with ease. Brick Break makes it much easier to defeat Munchlax. Bulky Pokemon that can set up Trick Room (Duskull, Bronzor) can also help this set out because Drowzee does not have the kind of defensive stats they do, which means it might not be able to set up Trick Room. Pokemon such as Shroomish greatly appreciate Trick Room because it can set up Spore before its opponent gets a turn to react.</p>"

In spite of his vulnerability to special attacks, proper team support can make Krabby a very formidable sweeper. If Krabby manages to get both a Swords Dance and an Agility boost, the opponent's only real hope is to chip away at Krabby with priority attacks. Krabby also has a great ability in Shell Armor, which means that a critical hit will never put an end to his sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Krabby does not have many other moves to work with. He learns Flail, which can be used with a Focus Sash to net a surprise KO. However, Krabby's subpar Speed stat makes it unlikely that you will score more than a single KO. Krabby could run a Choice Band set with the same moves as the Choice Scarf set, but his mediocre Speed remains an issue.</p> <p>Double-Edge is illegal with Agility but can be used over Return on the Choice Scarf set to add a bit more attacking power, though the recoil damage often outweighs the boost. Krabby learns Iron Defense to boost its already sky-high Defense stat, but his vulnerability to special attacks makes it gimmicky at best. He also learns Knock Off, which can be used to get rid of pesky Oran Berries, but Krabby is often better off trying to KO through them.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Any bulky special attacker can beat Krabby in most cases. Chinchou can switch in on either of Krabby's set-up moves and either outspeed him or survive an unboosted Return and OHKO with Thunderbolt. Mantyke is immune to Crabhammer and can threaten Krabby with a super effective Hidden Power. Croagunk is a great counter to Krabby, since he can come in on Crabhammer unscathed and inflict massive damage with Vacuum Wave.</p>",

Krabby attains perfect coverage through the use of two moves, Crabhammer and Return, so he can use the two remaining move slots to set up for a sweep. With an Adamant nature and after a Swords Dance, Krabby reaches an astronomical 44 Attack, which has a chance to OHKO every Pokemon in Little Cup, with the exception of Slowpoke. Krabby can also be effective without Swords Dance, however. X-Scissor is the recommended replacement, since, with a Life Orb, Krabby has a chance to OHKO Slowpoke if Stealth Rock is in play.</p> <p>The idea of this set is to come in on a Pokemon who cannot threaten Krabby, like Bronzor or a weak physical attacker, and Agility on the switch. With the boost, Krabby reaches 28 Speed, which is surpassed only by Choice Scarf variants of Elekid, Diglett, and Voltorb. Fortunately, these are very rare sights in Little Cup.</p> <p>Oran Berry is the recommended item so that Krabby can still get a boost off even if your opponent does not switch. Life Orb can also be an effective item, as it provides the extra oomph to turn some 2HKOs into OHKOs. If you go with Life Orb, dual screen support is recommended to preserve some of Krabby's durability. The EVs maximize Krabby's Attack and Speed while gaining a point in HP and Defense to help with his survivability.

The combination of Crabhammer and Return will hit every Pokemon in Little Cup for at least neutral damage, while the other moves provide for additional coverage.</p> <p>Crabhammer and Return are the primary attacks on this set, since they provide unresisted coverage.

Additionally, X-Scissor can be used if Grass- and Psychic-types give you trouble.</p> <p>The EVs are relatively simple, allowing Krabby to hit a sky-high 22 Attack and 21 Speed.

Voltorb is one of the three Pokemon in the tier that can reach 20 Speed, meaning it outspeeds all Pokemon that aren't holding a Choice Scarf. Combine that fact with a wide movepool and Voltorb can deal quite a lot of damage. Unfortunately, Voltorb is rather frail, and will lose a lot of health to relatively weak attacks. Overall, Voltorb is a Pokemon that can almost always accomplish its task, whether it is setting up weather or sweeping.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Both Choice Scarf and Choice Specs can be used, but there are several threatening and common Ground-types that would just love the free turn a Voltorb locked into Electric attacks provides. Choice Scarf Voltorb can outpace almost every Pokemon in Little Cup, but with Voltorb's merely average Special Attack, it lacks the raw power to threaten many Pokemon. Choice Specs brings a welcome boost to Special Attack, allowing Voltorb to hit hard immediately, as opposed to Charge Beam which takes a turn of setup; however, losing the ability to switch moves is a heavy price to pay.</p> <p>Magnet Rise and Thunder Wave are decent moves, but Voltorb will usually be better off attacking right off the bat. Magnet Rise helps against Ground-type leads since Voltorb can outspeed them all, and they will have trouble knocking it out without their super effective STAB attacks. Thunder Wave can be used to slow down incoming Pokemon, but Voltorb will rarely benefit from this itself as it is one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ice can be replaced by Hidden Power Grass or Ground to hit Pokemon such as Chinchou for super effective damage. Hidden Power Ground hits Magnemite, while Hidden Power Grass obliterates Pokemon such as Wooper, who is hit for an easy OHKO. On the Rain Dance set, Hidden Power Water is viable; it strikes most targets harder when rain is up, but loses the invaluable OHKO on Gligar.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Diglett can come in safely on Thunder Wave or a STAB attack and OHKO Voltorb with Earthquake, but has big problems with a super effective Hidden Power and Speed ties with Voltorb. Bronzor can sponge any of Voltorb's attacks and KO it with Earthquake. Priority attacks such as Houndour's Sucker Punch, Meowth's Fake Out, and Dratini's Extreme Speed can put a massive dent in Voltorb. Gligar is immune to Electric, doesn't mind being Taunted, and OHKOs Voltorb handily with STAB Earthquake, though it needs to watch out for Hidden Power Ice. Munchlax and Chinchou both counter Voltorb pretty well, but Voltorb can Explode on them. Rock- and Ground-types such as Rhyhorn and Geodude have high Defense, resist Explosion, and are immune to Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave, but can't take a super effective Hidden Power unless sandstorm is in effect. Magnemite can easily counter any Voltorb (bar Hidden Power Ground variants) because of its resistances to Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Ice and Grass, Explosion, and Sucker Punch. However Magnemite cannot really do much in return if it doesn't carry Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p>The best revenge killers are those that have a high offensive stat, are immune to Electric, and carry a Choice Scarf. Gible is one great example as it can easily outspeed Voltorb by one Speed point and KO it with STAB Earthquake. Likewise, Diglett can use a Choice Scarf to outspeed, trap, and KO Voltorb quite reliably, though it must beware of switching in on a Substitute.</p>",

      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>With its combination of high Speed, good coverage, and useful utility moves, Voltorb can succeed at disrupting and destroying popular leads. Defensively weak leads get hit by a STAB Thunderbolt from Voltorb's decent Special Attack stat. Hidden Power Ice is used for near perfect coverage alongside Thunderbolt, and gives Voltorb a chance against Gligar and Diglett leads (though in order to beat Diglett, Sucker Punch must be used), although Phanpy will barely be scratched by it. Taunt stops weather and Stealth Rock leads from fulfilling their objectives, but watch out as many Stealth Rock leads carry Earthquake. Protect and Sucker Punch beat the common Fake Out leads, such as Meowth and Chimchar, by avoiding their Fake Out or breaking their Focus Sash, respectively. Finally, when Voltorb's usefulness comes to an end, Explosion is devastatingly powerful even from only 10 Attack, often knocking a Pokemon out along with it.</p> <p>Protect may seem like the best option against Meowth as Fake Out will do far more damage than Voltorb's Sucker Punch. However, Thunderbolt will never OHKO Meowth, so with Protect, Meowth will get a chance to use one of its stronger attacks or U-turn. Sucker Punch will break Meowth's Focus Sash first turn and force Meowth to switch or get knocked out next turn. The same goes for Chimchar, although you have to watch out for a priority move of its own.</p> <p>Lead Voltorb functions best with Pokemon that can comfortably switch into Ground-type leads, which Voltorb has the most problems with. Aqua Tail Gligar can switch into Onix, Hippopotas, and, as a bonus, Choice Scarf Machop without much problem, though by switching, you give the Ground-type Pokemon a turn to set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Voltorb can usually do its task by itself, so it has relatively little need for team support. However, the ones that can support Voltorb will greatly help it. Flying-type Pokemon are great teammates, being able to switch in to Ground-type attacks, which Voltorb attracts. In return, Voltorb has access to a fast Taunt, which will prevent all leads bar Diglett from setting up Stealth Rock. Good choices for Flying-type teammates include Mantyke, which can wreak havoc without losing one-fourth of its health from switching in.</p>"
      },
      "Rain Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its high Speed, Voltorb can act as a great Rain Dance supporter. Even with Voltorb's frailness, it has decent enough bulk to avoid being OHKOed by most opponents. It has access to a powerful STAB Thunder, which is granted perfect accuracy in the rain. Thunder also has a 30% chance to paralyze that is useful for slowing down Choice Scarf users. The best part about Voltorb is its access to Explosion, which can deal with Pokemon that are too bulky and give a free switch-in to a Swift Swim sweeper. Taunt stops opponents that try to set up on the same turn as Voltorb, which is especially important against Trick Room teams as they give most rain teams trouble. Light Screen is an option to help your rain-abusing sweepers last longer, and gives Voltorb something useful to do when given free turns; for example, it is useful against Protect users that try to stall out the rain. Hidden Power Ice can be used over Taunt or Light Screen to hit Gligar and Diglett. However, a fast Taunt is almost too good to pass up because of how badly Rain Dance teams are countered by Trick Room teams. If your team has troubles with Snover, Hidden Power Fire is an option to eliminate the tree, but it doesn't have much use outside of that.</p> <p>As Rain Dance Voltorb is mostly a support Pokemon, it needs little support of its own. However, having Pokemon that can safely switch into Earthquake can be a benefit to Voltorb. Swift Swim Mantyke works especially well as it threatens them with STAB Water-type moves and can effectively abuse rain if Voltorb sets it up. Rain teams in general greatly benefit from the removal of Snover and Hippopotas, but an opponent who knows she is facing a rain team will do everything in her power to keep her weather setter alive. Wynaut traps both of them, can avoid being 2HKOed by most Snover and Hippopotas, and can use a combination of Encore, Mirror Coat, and Counter to knock them out. Swift Swim sweepers such as Omanyte, Buizel, and Kabuto are all great partners to Voltorb, all benefiting from Rain Dance. Voltorb will greatly benefit from Wynaut, which can trap Snover and Hippopotas, and dispose of them with the appropriate move. Wynaut can also defeat Choice Scarf users, and with them removed, Voltorb will be the fastest Pokemon, being able to easily sweep late-game.</p>"

It can make great use of its ability, Chlorophyll, to attempt a sweep, or it can play different supportive roles - it can easily set up dual screens, Trick Room, or act as a Sunny Day supporter. Exeggcute is no slouch on the offensive side, either. With access to moves such as Solar Beam, Psychic, Explosion, and a Hidden Power of choice, Exeggcute can make opponents rip their hair out when trying to counter this batch of eggs. However, that's not to say Exeggcute doesn't have any downfalls. With weaknesses to Fire-, Ice-, Bug-, Poison-, Flying-, Ghost-, and Dark-type attacks, most Pokemon will easily possess a super effective attack. Even so, Exeggcute's resistences to Psychic-, Grass-, Fighting-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks can somewhat mediate its weaknesses and efficiently allow it to accomplish any task given to it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Exeggcute can utilize a Wish + Protect set, but this isn't as viable a strategy in Little Cup as it is in standard play. Leaf Storm, though having a terrible secondary effect, can be used over Solar Beam for a much stronger STAB attack, but Exeggcute would lose a lot of power with its other attacks. A Swords Dance set in Sunny Day can work, but the lack of a Psychic-type STAB makes Bellsprout generally a better choice for such a role. Worry Seed effectively neutralizes a pesky ability, like Wynaut's Shadow Tag, but is counterintuitive if used with Sleep Powder. Synthesis could be used, but the coverage moves and other support moves would be more beneficial in most cases.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Snover is, in most cases, the best counter to Exeggcute. Upon switching in, it can eliminate Sunny Day thanks to Snow Warning, causing Exeggcute to charge up its Solar Beam; Snover can then outspeed and OHKO Exeggcute with Blizzard. Most Fire-types can greatly threaten it; Houndour is one of the better checks as it is immune to Psychic. Though Stunky isn't a Fire-type, it is part-Dark, and can easily OHKO Exeggcute with Sucker Punch or Crunch. If Exeggcute lacks Psychic, Gastly can set up a Substitute on it and then fire off super effective Sludge Bombs. Bronzor can beat Exeggcute if carrying Hidden Power Ice since it resists both of Exeggcute's STABs, but must always be wary of Sleep Powder.</p>",

        "description": "<p>With 28 Speed under Sunny Day courtesy of Chlorophyll, passable Special Attack, and access to Explosion, Exeggcute is one of the most dangerous Sunny Day sweepers in Little Cup. Solar Beam is a powerful STAB attack, though it is the second strongest behind the counterintuitive Leaf Storm. Psychic is also very strong, and is capable of hitting many Pokemon that don't resist it for big damage. In the third slot, Sleep Powder is the primary option, allowing Exeggcute to essentially remove pesky Sucker Punch users from play - namely, Croagunk, Houndour, and Stunky; all three resist Solar Beam, with the latter two sporting an immunity to Psychic to boot. However, Hidden Power Ground would smack all three of these Pokemon for super effective damage on the switch in (though Croagunk is OHKOed by Psychic anyways), while Hidden Power Ice allows Exeggcute to get a super effective attack on non-Poison Grass-types (since Poison is weak to Psychic-type attacks). Even if Exeggcute lacks Sleep Powder, not even Munchlax is a great check to this set, as Exeggcute can easily remove Munchlax from the battle via Explosion. Explosion will also allow Exeggcute to literally go out with a bang when Sunny Day nears its end.</p> <p>Exeggcute's EVs boost its Special Attack and Speed, with an extra 2 points going to HP. There is no investment in Attack because Exeggcute will still easily OHKO Munchlax with Explosion. The best partners for this set are obviously Sunny Day supporters, since Exeggcute loses a lot of strength and viability if it cannot outspeed most of the metagame. Munchlax, Koffing, and Ponyta all work well with Exeggcute, since they cover most of each other's weaknesses, in one way or another. Though Exeggcute has access to Sunny Day, it's best to have other Pokemon set it up, since it would rather have an extra attack or Sleep Powder for support tactics. Choice Scarf Fire-types, like Houndour, that can also take advantage of Sunny Day are good, since they can clean up Exeggcute's messes.</p>"

      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>With decent defenses, Exeggcute can run a good dual screen support set. Reflect and Light Screen are obvious choices for the first two slots. Light Clay will extend the duration of both of these moves by three turns. Sleep Powder is a great support move that can put a Pokemon that would normally counter Exeggcute, like Stunky, to sleep. If Exeggcute uses Explosion, it will allow a teammate to get 6 turns of one screen, and 5 of the other. However, Psychic is a decent option on this set if Substitute Gastly is troublesome. The EVs and nature emphasize Exeggcute's Special Defense, since its Defense is naturally higher. An extra point is given to Attack for Explosion, but it should be transferred to Special Attack if Psychic is being used instead.</p> <p>Setup sweepers work great with this set. Gligar is a great partner, since it has both Swords Dance and Rock Polish. Chinchou has Agility, and resists both Fire- and Flying-type attacks - two moves that easily wreck Exeggcute. Aron is another exemplary teammate, since it resists Bug, Dark, Ghost, Flying, and Ice - nearly all of Exeggcute's weaknesses - and can set up Rock Polish in order to threaten a sweep. Lum Berry Munchlax is another good partner, since it will not take much damage under dual screens and can beat Substitute Gastly - a Pokemon that would normally be a surefire stop to Exeggcute.</p>"

      "Trick Room Support": {

Trick Room allows it to go first in most cases, since it will have a minimal amount of Speed and can \"outspeed\" numerous threats in Trick Room. Sleep Powder is a great support move that allows slow setup sweepers to pull off a boosting move before the opponent wakes up. Psychic gets good neutral coverage and prevents Exeggcute from being helpless against Substitute Gastly and Drifloon. However, Leaf Storm is Exeggcute's strongest STAB attack and, even without any investment, can still do a good amount of damage, even with neutral damage. Explosion is a good pivot move, as it can remove an opposing threat most of the time, and can give a Trick Room sweeper a clean switch in. The EVs maximize Exeggcute's Defense, with the remainder going into Attack and Special Defense. A 0 IV in Speed is important so Exeggcute can outspeed more Pokemon under Trick Room.</p> <p>Trick Room sweepers are great partners for this Exeggcute. Thanks to its low Speed and access to powerful moves such as Dynamic Punch and Stone Edge, Machop can become a successful Trick Room partner. It is also great since it can KO Munchlax, a common switch-in to Exeggcute. Trapinch is in the same boat as Machop, but it shares an Ice-type weakness with Exeggcute. Still, Exeggcute can dispatch Munchlax with Explosion, but given Exeggcute's bulk, it can take up to three Fire Punches (factoring in Oran Berry). Also, Exeggcute should only use Explosion if it's low on health or if a naturally slower Pokemon like Paras switches in. In addition, it can take out a Taunt user with Explosion if it's being used in the lead slot. Finally, other Trick Room supporters, such as Slowpoke, Bronzor, and Duskull, also work well if Exeggcute goes down early in the match.</p>"

      "Sunny Day Support": {
        "description": "<p>With a bulky spread, Exeggcute can become a reliable user of Sunny Day. Solar Beam is its strongest STAB next to Leaf Storm and, unlike Leaf Storm, will not lower Exeggcute's Special Attack by two stages. Psychic is a good secondary STAB move, but Hidden Power Ground hits Fire-types, namely Houndour, while Hidden Power Ice hits Gligar and bulky Grass-types for super effective damage, though Psychic will still do a good amount of damage to all of the above. Sleep Powder can put a threat or check to sleep. However, Explosion can clear the way for a sweeper and give it a free switch in. Since this set is for support and not sweeping, a bulky EV spread with a Calm nature is used. Even with the lowering of Attack, Explosion will still OHKO Munchlax. Despite the lack of any Speed investment, Chlorophyll will allow Exeggcute to get the jump on many slower threats and put them to sleep via Sleep Powder or KO them with one of its attacks.</p> <p>Heat Rock is the primary option to extend Sunny Day, but an Oran Berry can be used over it for extra longevity. However, three immediate extra turns of Sunny Day would be more appreciated by the rest of the team. Chlorophyll sweepers are happier with Heat Rock, so Pokemon like Swords Dance Bellsprout will have more sweeping time and will have double Speed for three extra turns. Choice Scarf Fire-type sweepers, such as Houndour and Ponyta, can make good use of the 1.5x bonus that Sunny Day will provide for their Fire-type STAB moves. They will also be able to beat Snover, a big threat to Sunny Day teams, one-on-one. Munchlax, which is another great Sunny Day supporter to consider, can also trap and KO Snover with Pursuit.</p>"

  "Cubone": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>If you like slow but powerful Pokemon, then Cubone is worth considering. It has a good physical movepool, and the Attack stat to back it up. It has one distinct advantage, Thick Club, which gives it 30 Attack, more than almost any Choice Band-equipped Pokemon, while retaining freedom to switch moves. Unfortunately, Cubone's low Speed prevents it from being able to sweep without some form of support, like Agility passing, Trick Room, or paralysis; however, it is a great partner for all three of those strategies. Its defenses are not exactly reliable (though it can take the odd physical hit or two), so switching it in directly is a risk you may not wish to take. However, once in the battle, Cubone can be very useful at clearing out certain key Pokemon to help your team win the match.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Cubone has quite a few options in terms of attacks: Iron Head, Iron Tail, Bonemerang, Focus Punch, Rock Slide, and Thunder Punch. Bonemerang could be useful for breaking Substitutes, but beyond that these moves are generally inferior to the ones listed in the above sets. Thunder Punch isn't terrible, but it doesn't hit anything important that Double-Edge or Fire Punch can't hit just as hard, if not harder, bar Mantyke. The only really special attacks to choose from are Blizzard and Ice Beam, which pose a huge threat to any Gligar that are switching in with hopes of ruining a potential sweep.</p> <p>Cubone also learns Belly Drum, but it's too slow to stat up and sweep with that method, and its Attack is already high enough to do significant damage. With its decent bulk, Cubone can be effectively used as a Stealth Rock lead, and Protect can also be used over Substitute for scouting purposes.</p> <p>196 HP / 196 Atk / 76 Def / 36 SpD is the standard EV spread for Cubone, giving the best combination of Attack and Defense. If you're running Ice Beam, move the Special Defense EVs into Special Attack for the increased power against Gligar. If you're planning on passing Cubone some Speed, 36 HP /196 Atk / 236 Spe is the preferred spread, possibly with Jolly to hit the magic number of 14, which allows Cubone to outpace all non-Choice Scarfed Pokemon after a +1 boost.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Cubone's absolutely massive power means that it's incredibly difficult to switch into. The only Pokemon that stand a chance at coming in are those that can avoid its incredibly powerful STAB Earthquake. This limits the counters to Pokemon that have the ability Levitate, and Flying-type Pokemon.</p> <p>Bronzor may seem like a good counter at first, but its incredibly low Speed combined with a weakness to Cubone's Fire Punch makes Bronzor ineffective at stopping Cubone. Gligar is also an unreliable counter, being OHKOed by Ice Beam after taking Stealth Rock damage, and being forced to hit Cubone with neutral attacks on Cubone's stronger physical defense. Mantyke can come in with its immunity to Earthquake and KO or scare off Cubone with a STAB Surf or Hydro Pump, but must beware of Double-Edge.</p> <p>That brings us to the best Cubone counters: Levitating Ghosts. Out of them Gastly is the least effective counter. The standard +SpA Energy Ball, its most effective attack against Cubone, only OHKOes 2.56% of the time, while Cubone's Fire Punch OHKOes 40% of the time. However, if Gastly is running a boosting item like Life Orb or Choice Specs, it can outpace and OHKO Cubone with little to no trouble. Duskull can survive Fire Punch (sometimes two of them), but its poor Speed lets Cubone easily outpace it and set up a Substitute, allowing Cubone to avoid a Will-O-Wisp. Finally, there is Drifloon, which loses automatically if Cubone is packing Rock Slide; however, if it's using Fire Punch, there's still a chance, since Fire Punch does not OHKO Drifloon even with Stealth Rock on the field. However, the damage Fire Punch does to Drifloon is just enough for Drifloon's Petaya Berry to activate, which ups its Special Attack to a level where it OHKOes 100% of the time.</p> <p>If Cubone successfully pulls off its Swords Dance and Agilipass combo, it can become extremely hard to stop. Squirtle can use a combination of Fake Out and Aqua Jet against it to deal a fair amount of damage. The remaining counters depend on Cubone's nature. Jolly +2 Cubone has 28 Speed, which can only be tied with at best by nearly all Choice Scarf Pokemon--anything less than 28 Speed is KOed, and anything more can only muster a revenge kill. Essentially, the only counters to a boosted Cubone are priority users, in addition to Pokemon that can kill it before it can manage to set up.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set is probably the most effective that Cubone can run, and is great if all you need is a physically bulky heavy-hitter on your team. With Cubone's massive Attack and reasonable defense, it can play like a standard bulky Choice Band user, except it gets the freedom to change attacks; all thanks to Thick Club, which doubles its Attack. Earthquake is obvious, being Cubone's basic STAB move; it will most likely OHKO anything that is not resistant or immune to it. Double-Edge is effective at hitting almost everything that Earthquake doesn't, barring Ghost-types with Levitate (and Drifloon). Pokemon that are immune to both Double-Edge and Earthquake are hit hard by Fire Punch. For example, here are some damage calculations:</p> <ul> <li>Cubone Fire Punch vs. 116 HP Gastly: 85.7% - 104.8% (40% chance of OHKO)</li> <li>Cubone Fire Punch vs. 196 HP / 36 Def Impish Duskull: 47.6% - 57.1% (3HKO through Oran, possible 2HKO if it gets a minimum damage roll followed by a maximum one)</li> <li>Cubone Fire Punch vs. 196 HP / 4 Def Drifloon: 60.7% - 71.4% (guaranteed 2HKO)</li> <li>Cubone Fire Punch vs. Max HP/ Max Def Impish Levitate Bronzor: 72% - 88% (2HKO through Oran)</li> </ul> <p>In addition, Fire Punch serves as Cubone's weapon-of-choice against Grass-type Pokemon and Bronzor. Substitute can help ease prediction somewhat, as Cubone's immense power tends to cause switches. Alternatively, Ice Beam can be used over Substitute for a more powerful hit against Gligar; just remember to transfer the 36 EVs from Special Defense to Special Attack; with 36 Special Attack EVs, Gligar is OHKOed by Ice Beam 77% of the time, and is OHKOed 100% with Stealth Rock in play.</p> <p>Being the slow, bulky sweeper that it is, Cubone absolutely loves Trick Room support. Gastly, Porygon, and Slowpoke are all effective at setting up Trick Room, which in turn allows Cubone to take advantage of his horrible Speed stat. Slowpoke is a notable Trick Room supporter because it can take any Water-type attack aimed at Cubone, while Cubone can come in on any Electric-type attack. Unfortunately, both Pokemon share a weakness to Grass, so it's good to have a Trick Room Bronzor waiting in the wings to sponge Grass-type hits.</p>"
      },
      "Baton Pass Receiver": {
        "description": "<p>This set focuses on Cubone's talent for sweeping after being Baton Passed Speed boosts. Swords Dance's purpose is obvious; after a Swords Dance, the attacks listed can OHKO almost any Pokemon in Little Cup. Just one Swords Dance gives Cubone a massive Attack stat of 56 or 60 (depending on Cubone's nature). Substitute, on the other hand, allows Cubone to take advantage of its ability to cause switches. Even without a Swords Dance boost, Cubone is still incredibly dangerous, and Substitute just compounds that by giving protection against revenge killers and as well as easing prediction. Substitute is the option for the cautious player; it might not seal the game, but it will help increase Cubone's survivability on the field. Swords Dance can effectively bring you automatic victory if it gets set up once certain Scarfers are taken out, but Cubone's relatively poor Special Defense means that an incorrect prediction could be spell instantaneous doom for Cubone.</p> <p>Choosing Cubone's nature is a matter of personal preference. Jolly is preferred here, as 14 Speed allows Cubone to outpace all non-Choice Scarfed Pokemon after a +1 Speed boost, while +2 Speed gives it enough Speed to outpace all Choice Scarfed Pokemon, except Voltorb, Elekid, and Diglett. An Adamant nature, however, is still a good option if you're likely to be able to take out faster scarfers before the pass, or if you need that little extra brute force.</p> <p>Aipom, Gligar, and Venonat all work well with this set. They can effectively pass an Agility or two to Cubone, giving it enough Speed to outpace all non-Choice Scarfed Pokemon, as well as many Scarfed Pokemon. Aipom and Venonat work the best out of the three, as they don't share any common weaknesses with Cubone, so there is less of a risk involved when it's time to pass.</p>"

  "Lickitung": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Lickitung has always been a balanced Pokemon. While it has excellent defenses and a good movepool, these assets are offset by low Speed and average attacking stats. Lickitung is also one of the few Pokemon who can make good use of Wish, especially when considering its excellent bulk and defensively neutral typing, something that most other Wish users lack. When you look into the diversity and unpredictability of Lickitung's sets, as well as its bulk, you will find that it is a difficult Pokemon to counter. If you play Lickitung to its strengths, it might just surprise you!</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Lickitung's movepool is absolutely massive and has many moves that have not been mentioned in any of its sets. Lickitung has access to Thunderbolt, but the reason it is not listed is because Power Whip is superior most of the time. Heal Bell can be used to heal status, but is generally bad in Little Cup since status effects are rare. Knock Off could work on the support set, but it's really difficult to find a place to put it. One of Lickitung's most interesting options is Belly Drum. A set consisting of Substitute, Belly Drum, Return, and Fire Punch with a Jolly Nature and 236 Speed EVs along with a Salac Berry would be very threatening, but of course, Croagunk and other strong priority users must be removed for this to work. Curse is a decent move for increasing its Attack and Defense, but in general, it is worse than Swords Dance. While Munchlax usually outclasses Lickitung as a Trick Room sweeper, Lickitung's better movepool and access to Swords Dance may prove more useful. Lickitung's final workable option is Earthquake, but it's pretty much in the same boat as Thunderbolt—outclassed by many of Lickitung's other moves.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>As listed many times in this analysis, Croagunk is a Lickitung check. A combination of Fake Out and Vacuum Wave will do severe damage to Lickitung, crippling its ability to sweep. Most Fighting-types in general will be able to lay the hurt on Lickitung, including but not limited to Machop, Mankey, and Makuhita. Immensely powerful STAB attacks such as Dratini's Outrage or Draco Meteor are also very harmful to Lickitung. Other than that, Lickitung is pretty hard to beat considering how diverse it is.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>Lickitung can break nearly every wall in Little Cup with this set. Gligar, along with other physically defensive Ground- or Rock-types, are disposed of with Ice Beam. Fire Blast deals with the various Steel-types in Little Cup, particularly Bronzor. Return offers you the most power, but Body Slam is the preferred option as the paralysis chance helps accommodate Lickitung's abysmal Speed and the power drop isn't too big. Power Whip is used to handle Water-types, such as Chinchou and Wooper, who will take a hefty amount of damage and may even be OHKOed. Munchlax is one of the few Pokemon who can deal with Lickitung, but even it doesn't last long against repeated STAB attacks.</p> <p>This Lickitung is best used to make openings in the opponent's team for other sweepers, such as Dratini and Staryu. Croagunk and the various other Fighting-types in Little Cup give Lickitung trouble, so pairing it with Gligar, a Pokemon who can soak up Fighting attacks and benefits from a fainted Bronzor, is a good idea.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes a much different approach than the Wall Breaker set. Instead of destroying walls, Lickitung sets up on them. After a Swords Dance, Lickitung reaches a destructive 32 Attack stat, making sure that nearly no one can survive its boosted attacks. Return and Fire Punch are Lickitung's main attacks. Return has great neutral coverage, while Fire Punch checks the Steel-types who would normally wall this set. Power Whip is chosen in the last slot to allow Lickitung to defeat bulky Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type Pokemon, such as Chinchou, Onix, and Kabuto. Another advantage this set has over the Wall Breaker set is the ability to invest heavily in bulk, whereas the other set has to invest in Special Attack.</p> <p>Swords Dance Lickitung appreciates Wynaut support so it can potentially come in for a free Swords Dance. Much like the last set, this set needs Croagunk to be killed before it can pull off a successful sweep. Wynaut once again comes to mind, as it can trap and pick off Croagunk, especially those without Dark Pulse. Swords Dance Lickitung doesn't like Gligar either, so Pokemon who can get rid of Gligar are also excellent to pair with this set. Snover is an excellent candidate for removing Gligar with its STAB Ice Shard and can also set up Swords Dance against a fleeing Gligar.</p>"

      "Special Wall": {
        "description": "<p>Munchlax has always been the premier special wall of Little Cup, sporting insane HP and Special Defense along with Thick Fat; however, it suffers from lack of recovery outside of the one-time Oran Berry. Lickitung can play a very similar set to Munchlax's Special Wall, but with a form of recovery in Wish. Wish and Protect is a very effective way of healing both Lickitung and its teammates, and provides more survivability than Munchlax in the long run . While Oran Berry might seem a tad strange on a set with self recovery, it prevents Pokemon like Modest Gastly with Hidden Power Fighting from 2HKOing Lickitung, while Lickitung fires back with Shadow Ball for the KO. Fire Blast can also be used in the last slot to hit Bronzor and the various Grass-types of Little Cup. However, Shadow Ball is the preferred option, as Ghosts are one of the main things this set is built to wall. Body Slam is chosen over Return on this set as the paralysis chance is extremely helpful considering Lickitung's pathetic Speed and the fact that Body Slam provides enough power to deal with frail threats.</p> <p>There are a few options that could go over Shadow Ball or Fire Blast in the fourth slot. Ice Beam is a perfectly viable option to be able to defeat the Grass-types Fire Blast hits along with Gligar, who laughs at this set outside of Body Slam's 30% paralysis chance. Most Pokemon who switch in will attempt to exploit Lickitung's lower Defense stat, so Counter could give them a run for their money. Heal Bell is a unique move, but should be considered a lesser option since status isn't widely used in Little Cup.</p>"

  "Rhyhorn": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Rhyhorn is a freight train of a Pokemon with an impressive movepool, excellent physical stats, and suitable answers to many would-be checks and counters. Its biggest weakness is the poor Speed that allows many Pokemon to revenge kill or set up after scaring it out. Luckily, Rock Polish gives it a tool that allows it to sweep in a metagame filled with quick Pokemon. Its greatest advantages over other Ground- and Rock-types is its ability to deal severe damage to what would ordinarily check it based on typing alone, Gligar being a prime example. It also has access to several 100+ Base Power moves, making every attack a functional wrecking ball. Played properly it can run roughshod even over prepared opponents with its sheer power.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Rhyhorn's abysmal Speed means it operates extremely well in Trick Room. Every set except Rock Polish can be converted into a functioning Trick Room set by selecting a Brave (or Relaxed for defensive) nature and 0 Speed IV. Place the Speed EVs into HP or Defense, because 236 doesn't split well between Rhyhorn's defensive stats. Rock Blast and Stone Edge each have their advantages and are somewhat interchangeable on each set. Be aware though that Rock Blast's unreliable Base Power can mitigate its Sub-and-Sash-crushing abilities.</p> <p>Rhyhorn has a massive physical movepool, but generally the options outlined in the sets are superior. Crunch, Payback, Superpower, Reversal, Thunder Fang, Dragon Rush, and Double-Edge (not legal with elemental Fangs or Dragon Rush) are all there for anyone who wants to try something different. Rhyhorn can also run Fire Blast, but its Special Attack is too low and Fire Fang has more synergy with all of its sets.</p> <p>Rhyhorn does have access to Swords Dance but is generally too slow to use it. In Trick Room, it is on a timer and thus usually impractical. If you could pass it Speed you might be able to pull it off, and good luck stopping Rhyhorn then. Phazing isn't especially valuable in Little Cup, but Rhyhorn can Roar out opponents if need be. Counter is viable given the number of low-powered super effective physical attacks Rhyhorn can be exposed to in Little Cup. However, Rhyhorn is generally powerful enough that attacking directly is superior to using Counter.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Gligar and Bronzor are the most immediate counters, assuming they do not switch in on an unresisted attack. Duskull can also perform admirably and is able to burn Rhyhorn with Will-O-Wisp or Disable its Rock attack. Cubone and Sandshrew resist Stone Edge and generally have enough Defense to retaliate with an Earthquake of their own. They usually stop Rock Polish in its tracks, but cannot survive multiple Choice Band-boosted Earthquakes. If Magnemite can Magnet Rise before an Earthquake, it effectively walls sets without Fire Fang or Superpower.</p> <p>Revenge killers to Rhyhorn are numerous, including most Water- and Grass-types and the aforementioned Gligar. Mankey and Machop can also KO it with their powerful Fighting moves. Generally speaking, if your attack is super effective and STAB, you can revenge kill Rhyhorn. Diglett is especially notable here, although without Choice Scarf or an unbroken Focus Sash it has no hope against a Rhyhorn that has already used Rock Polish.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>In Little Cup the difference between the Speeds of slow Pokemon and fast Pokemon is numerically insubstantial. Even dismally slow Pokemon like Rhyhorn can reach the upper ranks after a single stat-up. Combine this with Rhyhorn's massive innate strength and huge movepool and it is a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p>Not only do Earthquake and Stone Edge have nearly unresisted coverage in Little Cup, Rhyhorn has STAB on both of them. The two Pokemon who resist the combo are Baltoy and Bronzor. Megahorn easily dispatches Baltoy and hits Bronzor quite hard. However, Ice Fang is particularly effective against the omnipresent Gligar, who can survive a Stone Edge coming in. Megahorn is generally more useful because it hits the Grass-types resistant to Earthquake much harder than Ice Fang, but Gligar is a common encounter.</p> <p>Jolly is selected here because several threatening positive-natured Choice Scarf users rest on 25 Speed, most notably Mankey and Houndour, who can KO Rhyhorn with Close Combat and Hidden Power Grass, respectively. You also want to avoid speed ties with the numerous Pokemon with 24 Speed, such as Scarf Cranidos and Wailmer. For these reasons, Jolly is suggested, as its 26 Speed at +2 is often invaluable.</p> <p>Life Orb significantly increases damage, and with nearly unresisted STABs, it provides the power Rhyhorn needs to KO all but the sturdiest Pokemon who come in to face it. Oran Berry isn't really viable here because you need the extra damage. You could, however, use Chople or Shuca Berry as a surprise to survive one Fighting or Ground attack, respectively. It usually isn't worth it to halve damage from Water or Grass attacks, as few of them are physical and will still calculate at 2x damage.</p> <p>Rock Polish Rhyhorn is particularly weak to Aqua Jet, so Croagunk is an excellent partner to soak up Water attacks. Its further resistances to Vacuum Wave, Mach Punch, and Grass attacks are also welcome. Paras can be used to similar effect, but unfortunately shares a weakness to Ice Shard. In the case of Bronzor, your primary concern is Flash Cannon so Magnet Rise Magnemite can come in quite handy. Watch out for Earthquake, though.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>There is no such thing as a safe switch-in to Choice Band Rhyhorn. Its STAB moves complement each other near perfectly and its other options are essentially limitless. Switching in expecting one STAB and receiving the other is usually a death sentence, especially if you were relying on resistance or immunity to save your hide. Even though Stone Edge has shaky accuracy, the critical hit chance makes it difficult even for resistant Pokemon to come in without suffering tremendous damage. Aqua Tail always KOs standard Gligar variants with Stealth Rock down. Its KO chances without Stealth Rock are about 50% on 0/0 Gligar and 3% on 156/0 Gligar. The power of Choice Band combined with Aqua Tail's higher Base Power make it entirely superior to Ice Fang in this instance, and because it hits Max/Max Bronzor for about 40-45%, Bronzor is put in the difficult position of resting just above where Oran would activate. Assuming Oran is not activated in the meantime, Rhyhorn can KO it with Megahorn or Fire Fang from that HP level if Bronzor tries to switch in again. The final slot is between Megahorn and Fire Fang to address Bronzor. Fire Fang technically does more damage and guarantees a 2HKO on 252/252 Bronzor factoring in Oran Berry, but Megahorn provides a much harder hit to random switch-ins.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is what allows Rhyhorn to score so many useful KOs. Jolly misses out on too many potential KO's to be considered. The difference between 28 and 27 Attack is amazing for calculation purposes. If you for some reason want to pass Choice Band Rhyhorn Speed, a Jolly nature and 236 Speed EVs are better for reasons listed in the Rock Polish set, but such a strategy is risky and difficult to pull off.</p> <p>Because of its low Speed, partners that can paralyze or otherwise incapacitate opponents serve Rhyhorn well. Exeggcute is notable for being able to sleep and paralyze enemies, it can also boost Fire Fang's power with Sunny Day and become a powerful sweeper in its own right. Magnemite can address Water-types and also incapacitate with Thunder Wave. It notably also traps Bronzor. Venonat takes Grass attacks well and can also pass Rhyhorn an Agility for a late-game sweep. It is difficult to stop a rampaging STAB Earthquake when all the Flying-types and Levitate Pokemon have been removed (similarly, though with less consistent results, with Stone Edge).</p>"

Although it has many common weaknesses, its ability to switch into Normal, Flying, Fire, Electric, and Rock attacks serves it well.</p> <p>Substitute eases prediction a great deal, and can force opponents that would ordinarily stat-up to attack directly. This set plays much more conservatively than the others. You want to scout your opponent's team and determine the most likely switch-in, then use the attack most effective against them. Rock Blast is generally used over Stone Edge here to deal with Substitute abusing Ghost-types. Stone Edge does deal consistent damage however.</p> <p>Because Rhyhorn's Special Defense is still lackluster, Hippopotas is an excellent partner to bring on permanent sandstorm. Rhyhorn's defenses factoring the boost in are 27/18/15; not shabby at all. The same rules apply for many partners, Croagunk absorbing Water attacks, Magnemite trapping Bronzor, etc.</p> <p>Rhyhorn generally has better things to do than Stealth Rock, but it is an option if your other slots are full and you can use Rhyhorn's threat to set it up.

The Speed is the key factor that separates Mantyke and Horsea.

Croagunk only fears Horsea if it is using Hidden Power Ground. Mantyke is a good counter to Horsea if it is not using Hidden Power Electric.

Timid is the preferred nature on this set, since it reaches 32 Speed with Swift Swim, allowing it to outspeed all Choice Scarfers in LC. Life Orb is the best item on this set in order to help Horsea score OHKOs and 2HKOs on some Pokemon; however, Oran Berry can help recover HP from priority attacks that Horsea is vulnerable to.

Meowth, Croagunk, and Taillow are all capable of heavily damaging Horsea with their STAB priority moves. Bronzor handles these threats quite well, as it can switch in easily and set up Stealth Rock, or punish them with Earthquake or Psychic. It can also set up Rain Dance should it run out, allowing Horsea to resume its sweep. Snover shuts this set down easily by summoning hail, which removes Horsea's Swift Swim boost allows Snover to take it out with its STAB Grass-type attacks. Bronzor can stop all Snover sets barring the SubSeed set; there is nothing that can deal with the SubSeed set 100% of the time. It is best to attempt to switch in a powerful sweeper such as Houndour when Snover uses Protect and then continuously hit Snover hard with STAB moves. Chinchou or Mantyke will wall Horsea depending on the Hidden Power Horsea is using. Croagunk can check both of them by switching in on a Water-type move and then KO them with a combination of Fake Out and Sucker Punch. Wynaut is also a great choice for a partner to Horsea; it can trap Croagunk and kill it. It can also trap other Pokemon using support moves or attacks that Horsea resists, Encore them, and then let Horsea set up rain and sweep.</p>"

      "Agility": {
        "description": "<p>This set is similar to the Rain Dance sweeper, except this set uses Agility to alleviate the problems of the duration of rain. You still have the choice between Surf and Hydro Pump but you do not get the boost from rain. Using Hydro Pump over Surf is yet again up to preference. Hydro Pump will obviously hit harder than Surf can, but it has the chance to miss, possibly getting Horsea killed. Oran Berry is the preferred item on this set, because it allows Horsea to gain some health in the process of setting up Agility. You need to recover the much needed HP to help prevent your sweep being ended by priority attacks. The ability does not matter on this set, but having Swift Swim can be a nice way to counter opposing Rain Dance teams and Sniper is not really helpful at all.</p> <p>This set seems to be outclassed by Mantyke, but there are traits that make Horsea the better Agility user than Mantyke in certain cases. Horsea's Special Attack and Speed are both higher by one point and it is capable of reaching 32 Speed while Mantyke cannot. Horsea also resists Ice Shard and it is not weak to Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Priority attacks hurt Horsea's sweep badly. Having a Pokemon able to take the priority attacks is a must. Bronzor is a nice way of dealing with priority attacks. Paras can come in on Agility or Surf and put Horsea to sleep with Spore or attack with Seed Bomb, although it takes considerable damage from Ice Beam. Using Hoothoot is a great way to counter Paras, since it resists both of Paras's attacks and is immune to Spore because of its ability, Insomnia. Munchlax can take a couple of Surfs and hurt Horsea severely with Return. Bronzor is a good switch into Munchlax. Wynaut can trap Croagunk, kill it, and Encore other moves to let Horsea get an Agility off.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Goldeen is often overlooked because of its all-around average base stats. However, when Rain Dance is set up, Goldeen can become a very strong sweeper. With Megahorn exclusive to it among Rain Dance sweepers, Goldeen can kill Snover, one of Rain Dance's biggest nemeses. With its decent bulk, Goldeen can also set up Rain Dance for itself and its teammates. For these reasons, Goldeen is a valuable addition to any Rain Dance team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Goldeen has little utility outside of sweeping in rain. A Scarf set with Megahorn could be usable, reaching 17 Attack and 24 Speed. However, it lacks power without a rain-boosted Waterfall; Buizel generally does a better job. Agility could be used over Rain Dance, but Waterfall again lacks the power required to sweep. Finally, Aqua Tail could be used for the slight power boost over Waterfall, but the 90% accuracy could occasionally be a letdown.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Goldeen needs rain to sweep effectively. Therefore, with rain removed, Goldeen becomes much less of a threat. However, the two weather changers in Little Cup, Snover and Hippopotas, are threatened by Megahorn and Waterfall, respectively. With this taken into account, Snover and Hippopotas are not effective counters to Goldeen.</p> <p>Waterfall cannot OHKO Munchlax unless it switches into Stealth Rock and Goldeen rolls maximum damage with Life Orb under rain. Munchlax can then do massive damage back with Return. The same thing applies to Chinchou and Mantyke, who are only hit by Return and can OHKO or 2HKO back with Thunderbolt and Hidden Power, respectively. Finally, Croagunk can take down Goldeen with priority attacks. It must watch out for Psybeam, however.</p>",

      "Rain Dance Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set abuses Goldeen's ability, Swift Swim, as well as its advantages over other Rain Dance sweepers in Megahorn, Psybeam, and its greater bulk.</p> <p>Rain-boosted Waterfall hits like a truck, being able to OHKO common threats in Little Cup, such as Gligar and Gastly. Return provides perfect neutral coverage with Waterfall while hitting Water-type resisters, such as Mantyke. Megahorn is the crux of the set, OHKOing Snover, who normally stops Rain Dance teams cold with Snow Warning. It also OHKOes Carvanha and has a chance to OHKO Wynaut after Stealth Rock damage. Rain Dance allows Goldeen to set itself and its teammates up. Psybeam OHKOes Croagunk, another bane of Rain Dance teams. Be warned, however, that Croagunk's vast range of priority attacks will either cripple or outright KO Goldeen.</p> <p>Goldeen's item choice matters a lot to this set. With Life Orb, Goldeen guarantees the OHKO on Wynaut and has a chance to OHKO Munchlax in rain with Waterfall. However, with Oran Berry, Goldeen has a much easier time setting up Rain Dance. It also takes on Croagunk much better due to being able to heal off Croagunk's priority attacks.</p> <p>The EVs give Goldeen maximum Attack and Speed. The rest goes into Defense for an extra point. A 0 HP IV is to reach 19 HP, meaning Goldeen will only take one HP of damage from Life Orb. If Oran Berry is used, the HP IV should be left at 31.</p> <p>It is best for Goldeen to be on a Rain Dance team because Goldeen appreciates having Rain Dance set up before it comes in. The main candidates for Rain Dance setup are Voltorb and Bronzor. Voltorb usually occupies the lead spot, as it can throw off a fast Rain Dance and then use Explosion or hit hard with a STAB Thunder. Bronzor is one of Little Cup's bulkiest Pokemon and it sets up Rain Dance with incredible reliability. Having Rain Dance set up beforehand also means that Goldeen can use Psybeam to hit Croagunk. On the other hand, if Goldeen is setting up Rain Dance itself, it is helpful to support it with Reflect and Light Screen. These screens will increase Goldeen's above-average bulk to levels where it can set up and sweep easily. Bronzor, Abra, and even Slugma can set up screens behindwhich Goldeen can sweep.</p> <p>Goldeen has a huge weakness to Chinchou, only being able to hit it with Return while it OHKOes back with Thunderbolt. Therefore, a Chinchou counter is recommended. Diglett is one of the best Chinchou counters, especially on a rain team. Diglett can switch into Thunderbolt, trap, and OHKO Chinchou with Earthquake. Munchlax can hit Chinchou hard with Return or Earthquake while taking minimal damage from Chinchou's attacks. Munchlax has the added advantage of taking out Mantyke, who can survive Goldeen's attacks.</p>"

With the combination of Return and Quick Attack, not much can stand in Eevee's way other than Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types, who are the bane of its existence. Unfortunately, it has poor defenses and is quite slow, and thus is easily revenge killed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Eevee doesn't have a large movepool, but it still has a few moves worth noting. First, Eevee has access to Wish, but this is not very viable due to Eevee's bad defenses. Eevee may utilize a Flail set to push its power to the extreme; however, it is hard to set up correctly, and leaves Eevee easily revenge killed. Next, Yawn may be able to cause switches or create free turns of set-up. Eevee also has Baton Pass, but can only pass Curse and Substitute. Iron Tail can be used over Hidden Power to combat Rock-types, but with 75% accuracy, it is not very reliable. A Curse set can work with Eevee, increasing its Attack and Defense, while Quick Attack nullifies the Speed drops. Unfortunately, this set is very hard to set up, and has trouble with any physically bulky special attacker.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Eevee's best counters are Choice Scarfed Fighting-types such as Mankey, since at 26 Speed with its Choice Scarf, Eevee can't hope to outspeed them. While not as fast, Machop has more bulk than Mankey, and can hit Eevee with Dynamic Punch. Any Ghost-type can come in on a Normal-type attack, then wreak havoc by setting up or spreading status. Aron can easily set up on any Eevee without Hidden Power Ground and potentially sweep. Omanyte and Kabuto switch into against any set without Hidden Power Grass, though Choice Banded Return will do a fair amount. Bronzor walls Eevee, and can set up on it with impunity. Onix has a high Defense stat and a resistance to Eevee's STAB attacks, and has enough power to threaten it with a STAB. Choice Scarf Gastly can very easily revenge kill Eevee, while Duskull can usually wall it extremely well.</p>",

      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Due to Adaptability and STAB on both Return and Quick Attack, Eevee can function as both a revenge killer and a wallbreaker. Return is Eevee's strongest move on this set and, courtesy of Adaptability, hits with 204 Base Power, severely hurting anyone who doesn't resist it very hard. Quick Attack works well alongside Return, and allows Eevee to become a potent revenge killer. With Normal-type as its STAB, Ghost-types can be very threatening to Eevee; therefore, Bite is recommended in the third slot. In the final moveslot, Hidden Power Grass is generally the best choice as it OHKOes most Rock / Ground and Rock / Water Pokemon, but Hidden Power Ground is notable for its ability to beat down Aron, Shieldon, and Magnemite.</p> <p>Although Eevee is powerful there are several Pokemon who flat out wall it. Bronzor is a huge problem; it sports a resistance to three of Eevee's attacks, and can easily set up on it. As such, a Fire-type is recommended as a partner, hitting Bronzor and other Steel-types for super effective damage. Without Hidden Power Ground, other Steel-types, such as Aron, also pose a problem. Aron can easily set up on this set without it. A Choice Scarfed Fighting-type like Mankey can remedy this, as it can outspeed and OHKO all of the common Steel-types bar Bronzor. If Hidden Power Ground is used, the Attack EVs can be changed to 236 in order to allow another 36 EVs to go into the Defense stat.</p> <p>Fighting-types such as Mankey and Machop are serious threats to Eevee with their STAB Fighting-type attacks. Wynaut or a Ghost-type can take care of these threats, shrugging off Fighting-type attacks and hitting back with Counter or a STAB attack respectively. Ghost-types such as Drifloon and Gastly are immune to both of Eevee's STAB moves while outspeeding it and KOing with Hidden Power Fighting. Stunky works as a great counter to both Ghost-types thanks to its typing and access to both Pursuit and Sucker Punch.</p>"

With Choice Band's sheer power, Eevee is able to rip holes in the opposition's defense. On the other hand, Choice Scarf makes up for Eevee's lackluster Speed, and lets it function more as a revenge killer. Return is a strong and reliable STAB on Eevee, making it your first choice of attack. Quick Attack is a valuable priority move, allowing Eevee to pick off weakened foes. Bite allows Eevee to switch in on a Ghost-type move such as Shadow Ball, and hit the enemy Ghost-type for super effective damage. With Eevee's risk of being walled, Baton Pass allows Eevee to scout for potential threats, such as the Ghost-types that plague it, so that you can switch to an appropriate counter.</p> <p>Even with the power supplied by a Choice Band, Eevee fails to 2HKO Bronzor, even without taking Oran Berry into account. Bronzor can be easily beaten by Pokemon such as Houndour and Magby. Onix, with its gargantuan Defense stat and resistance to Normal-type attacks, can wall Eevee with impunity. A Water-type makes a good choice here, as it can abuse Onix's 4x weakness and dispatch of it. Once Eevee is locked into Return, any Ghost-type can come in and easily KO it or set up for a sweep. Stunky and Munchlax are both great choices to combat Ghost-types with their super effective attacks. After KOing an opposing Pokemon, a large number of threats can easily revenge kill Eevee.</p>"

Although Porygon can perform these roles well, Pokemon such as Munchlax have made the metagame revolve around Fighting-type attacks, making it hard for Porygon to set up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Porygon can make use of its secondary trait, Download, only rarely. This is because, due to its genderlessness, it cannot have its level-up moves because Download is a Gen 4 Ability while the Pomeg Glitch is Gen 3 only. Magic Coat can be of use against Paras, which is certain to use Spore against Porygon. If you want to go for a status move, Porygon can use Discharge or even Thunder Wave to cripple opposing Pokemon. Porygon also has access to Rain Dance, Thunder, and the aforementioned Recover, allowing it to set it up again and again. It can also set up sun and use Solar Beam and Hidden Power Fire. On a hail team, Porygon's good defenses combined with access to Recover, Blizzard, and Hail makes it an excellent choice.</p> <p>Porygon can also use Gravity in conjunction with its secondary trait, Download, along with 100% accurate Blizzard and Thunder, both of which are of equal Base Power to STAB Tri Attack (albeit with better coverage). It can also use Swift alongside Download, which can become stronger than Tri Attack if Porygon nets itself a Special Attack boost. Porygon's EVs vary greatly from set to set. On Agility sets, maximum Speed is necessary to hit any notable Speed value at all. Whether you max Special Attack or HP depends on whether or not you plan to be boosting your Porygon's Special Attack. For Trick Room sets, the EVs normally used for Speed can instead be allotted to Attack or HP, allowing Porygon to go mixed to beat Munchlax or to generally take more hits.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Porygon, despite its excellent attacking prowess, has a number of Pokemon that give it a bit of trouble. Magnemite stops Porygon cold if it doesn't have a super effective Hidden Power. Munchlax stops non-mixed Porygon with its mammoth HP and Special Defense stats. Scarf Gastly can easily switch in on Tri Attack and hammer Porygon with a STAB Sludge Bomb, outpacing Modest Agility variants if Gastly itself is Timid. Croagunk's Vacuum Wave is a 2HKO, as is Magby's Mach Punch, both doing roughly 70% damage to Porygon. Barring the use of Hidden Power Ground, Porygon cannot OHKO either, allowing them to easily revenge kill it. Houndour's Sucker Punch also works in a similar vein, though it is technically possible to stall it out of Sucker Punch PP and then kill it with Tri Attack.</p>",

Choice Scarf increases its mediocre Speed to the 21 threshold, allowing it to outpace all unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup. Trace enables it to switch into certain Pokemon's STAB moves for free, like those of Chinchou, Mantyke, and Houndour. From there, Porygon can either immediately threaten with any of its three attacks; Shadow Ball is usually a safe bet to hit the incoming Ghost and KO it easily. From there, Tri Attack and Shadow Ball will 2HKO anything that does not resist it, allowing Porygon to deal with virtually any threat. Porygon is also unique in that it can very easily cripple Wynaut by tricking it a Choice item and then switching out, as Trace allows it to copy Shadow Tag.</p> <p>Porygon does not need Speed when running Choice Specs, mainly due to its tremendous damage output and above-average bulk. It can easily revenge kill most Choice Scarf Pokemon, even ones that are at full health, as well as significantly dent most Pokemon that can't respond with Fighting-type moves. If running Choice Scarf, then it is required that one use a Timid nature and an EV spread of 76 HP / 236 SpA / 196 Spe. However, in this capacity Porygon serves as more of a revenge killer than a bulky attacker. Porygon can still utilize Trick to cripple incoming walls, however.</p> <p>Porygon's best bets for teammates are Ghost-types and Pokemon who resist Fighting-type moves. Drifloon enjoys the free switch into a Choiced Fighting-type attack which allows it to set up a free Substitute. Gligar does likewise, boosting its stats safely once its Substitute is up.</p>"

Mankey and Houndour cap at 25 and Machop caps at 21. The only Choice Scarf Pokemon that are faster than this are Gligar and Diglett, both of whom are typically used in other ways. Gastly can also outspeed with a Choice Scarf; though formerly its most common set, Scarf Gastly has become rare as of late, so it isn't a particularly noteworthy threat to this Porygon variant.</p> <p>Only Magnemite resists every move on this set, though it will not particularly enjoy getting hit repeatedly by any given move due to its poor Special Defense and abysmal HP stats. If Magnemite presents itself as a problem, Porygon can use Hidden Power Ground to deal with it more easily. Magby and Croagunk, both commonly-used revenge killers, are beaten easily by Hidden Power Ground as well. Hidden Power Ground also offers almost unresisted coverage (barring the Normal/Flying-types) when combined with Shadow Ball, while Tri Attack hits everything quite hard. Munchlax gives this set trouble as well, being the token special wall and able to hit back with a powerful Return.</p> <p>A powerful physical attacker complements this Porygon well. Fighting-types in particular are especially effective teammates thanks to their super effective STAB moves to hit Munchlax and Magnemite with. Machop, with its superb bulk, is able to come in and immediately force out or kill either aforementioned defensive threat.

It also serves as an excellent support move, letting other slow teammates manage a sweep. Tri Attack again is the staple offensive move of the set, letting Porygon walk all over Pokemon with poor Special Defense. Thunderbolt allows Porygon to handle Water-types with ease, while Shadow Ball lets it beat Ghosts. Alternatively, the aforementioned Recover can be used to help Porygon set up Trick Room more than once.</p> <p>Trick Room Porygon does best with Trick Room-abusing teammates, such as Cubone or Krabby. They both benefit greatly from Trick Room and are able to easily remove from play Munchlax and Magnemite, two Pokemon that Porygon hates to face.

The equally-revered Fighting/Ghost combination is also usable, albeit with a good deal less Base Power in exchange for totally unresisted coverage. If another coverage attack does not appeal to you, you can use Trick Room so that Porygon can start its own party.</p> <p>This Porygon is stopped by very few Pokemon.

Unfortunately, such Pokemon are limited in number. Bronzor is good for setting up Trick Room and can carry Earthquake to deal with Magnemite, though it can get into big trouble if Magnemite uses Magnet Rise, as Bronzor will be unable to switch out, thus wasting precious turns of Trick Room. Slow Fighting-types such as Machop and Makuhita make mincemeat out of Magnemite and Munchlax; slow Ground-types such as Cubone and Trapinch work just as well.</p>"

With a Modest nature and 200 Special Attack EVs, Omanyte reaches 19 Special Attack, while the 76 Speed EVs allow Omanyte to reach a stat of 22 under rain, making it outpace all non-Choice Scarf Pokemon. Oran Berry is the preferred item on the set because it restores Omanyte's health, although you can use Damp Rock to increase the duration of rain.</p> <p>Surf is the primary attacking move on the set. In the rain, Surf can dent most Pokemon who aren't immune or resistant to it. Earth Power can be used to hit Electric-types and Croagunk, while Ice Beam can hit Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Surf. Hidden Power Electric allows Omanyte to hit Water-types, especially Mantyke.</p> <p>This Omanyte set has troubles with Snover. Bronzor can switch in on Snover and threaten it out with STAB super effective Gyro Ball while also setting down Stealth Rock, limiting the number of times Snover can switch back in. Wynaut is also a great partner for Omanyte, as it can trap Croagunk (who can OHKO Omanyte with Vacuum Wave) and can also create a free turn for Omanyte to set up rain. Another threat is Munchlax, who is able to KO Omanyte before Omanyte can 3HKO it back, however, Bronzor, again, can handle Munchlax fine. If you run Ice Beam instead of Earth Power, Chinchou becomes a problem. You can use Croagunk to deal with it by using Fake Out and Sucker Punch. Using Earth Power leaves you open to Paras and Shroomish, though, so using a Fire-type to dispatch them easily is a good idea.</p>"

      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>Omanyte has access to Rock Polish which allows it to double its Speed stat, so Omanyte no longer has to worry about setting up rain to sweep. With the given EVs, Omanyte reaches 22 Speed which allows it to outpace all Pokemon who aren't equipped with a Choice Scarf. The spread gives Omanyte a decent amount of bulk, helping it set up Rock Polish much easier. Shell Armor is the preferred ability so you won't have to fear critical hits.</p> <p>Hydro Pump allows you to power your way through most Pokemon with its 120 Base Power. Ancient Power and Earth Power allow you to hit Paras and Croagunk respectively, who are immune to Water-type attacks. Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Electric can be used to hit Water-types but Hydro Pump does roughly the same amount of damage.</p> <p>Wynaut is a great partner for Omanyte since it can trap Croagunk that lack Dark Pulse or Shadow Ball. It also creates opportunities for Omanyte to use Rock Polish thanks to Encore. Gligar is also an effective partner for Omanyte. Gligar resists Fighting-type moves and is immune to Ground- and Electric-type attacks, all of which Omanyte is weak against. Another partner for Omanyte is Gastly, which is immune to Fighting- and Ground-type moves and can lure in Munchlax and burn it with Will-O-Wisp</p>"

      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Omanyte is one of the few very effective entry hazard supporters in the Little Cup metagame. Having access to all three forms of entry hazards (Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes), as well as boasting a high Defense stat, Omanyte won't have a hard time setting up multiple layers of two of the three of the aforementioned hazards. Also, Omanyte is basically the only Pokemon who can effectively set up Spikes or Toxic Spikes, as the other pokemon with access to these moves, such as Pineco, are not equipped to deal with the metagame. As for attacking options, Surf is the primary STAB move of choice, hitting for decent damage so Omanyte is not left helpless offensively. Ancient Power serves as a secondary STAB move, hitting Pokemon like Paras and Mantyke that take Surf with impunity. However, Ice Beam can be used to deal heavy damage against opposing Grass-types, as well as damaging Croagunk and Dratini. If you opt to use Toxic Spikes, Protect may be a worthwhile option give Omanyte a chance to stall the opponent for poison damage. Protect also helps Omanyte scout for dangerous attacks coming from the likes of Choice Scarf Mankey and Gligar.</p> <p>Pairing up Omanyte with Hippopotas is a great idea, as the sandstorm Hippopotas summons increases Omanyte's Special Defense by 1.5x, enhancing its durability on the special side. It's also recommended to use Pokemon who can cover Omanyte's weaknesses to Fighting, Electric, and Grass. This can be done by using Gligar, who resists Fighting and is immune to Electric, or Paras, who resists all of the three types.</p>"

  "Dratini": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Dratini has definitely found its place in the Little Cup metagame. Dratini will always have competition from Bagon thanks to its higher Attack, but Dratini often overshadows Bagon because of Extreme Speed. Gible, the other little Dragon, has a nice STAB Earthquake, but the lack of Dragon Dance, a respectable Special Attack, and priority means Dratini is often seen as the better choice.</p> <p>Thanks to its great movepool and all round passable stats Dratini is one of the more versatile Pokemon in Little Cup, and is capable of running a large number of quite different sets effectively. Because of this, Dratini is very difficult to predict, and in Little Cup, one wrong move could mean the end of the battle. With Dratini's powerful offensive options, impressive movepool, decent defensive stats, and excellent typing, Dratini is definitely worth considering for your team, and always something to prepare for.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Dratini has quite a diverse movepool, and some decent options have not been listed above. First off, Dratini can run a pretty threatening Agility set. With Agility, Outrage, Aqua Tail, and Fire Blast, Dratini can pose a major threat to Pokemon like Gastly who switch in, expecting a slower Dragon Dance Dratini, only to be met with an OHKO. While Agility is viable, it does have problems competing with physical Dragon Dance because Extreme Speed makes the extra Speed boost less important, and without the Attack boost from Dragon Dance, Dratini's damage output can be disappointing.</p> <p>Dratini can just about pull off a decent Choice Specs set, if only to lure and KO Bronzor. However, Dratini's Special Attack is too low to be an effective user of Choice Specs. A physical Choice Scarf set could be also be used, but Bagon pulls that set off better thanks to its higher Attack. It's also worth noting that Light Screen is illegal with Extreme Speed which reduces Dratini's usefulness significantly.</p> <p>Dratini has decent defenses, some good support moves, and great typing, so it can use a general support set. With Light Screen and Thunder Wave, Dratini could cause some annoyance to your opponent. However, Dratini is almost always better off attacking because of its vast offensive movepool and solid Attack and Special Attack.</p> <p>On the Dragon Dance set, a bulkier EV spread can be used. A simple spread of 28 HP / 164 Atk / 156 Def / 116 SpD / 36 Spe will go a long way, especially with Reflect and Light Screen support. This may allow Dratini to set up more than one Dragon Dance, increasing Dratini's chance of sweeping. The main setback is that Dratini essentially needs more than one Dragon Dance to sweep and it loses a bit of immediate power. The Speed is helpful for revenge killing Pokemon such as Croagunk who only reach 13 Speed most of the time.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Dratini is one of those rare Pokemon who has very few safe switch-ins, if any. Bronzor is probably your best bet, resisting Dratini's STAB Dragon-type attacks and Extreme Speed, while not taking much from Dratini's Water-type attacks, though Bronzor does need to avoid Fire Blast. Against the special attacking Dratini, Munchlax does a great job of walling it.</p> <p>After Dratini has a Dragon Dance under its belt, it is one of the hardest Pokemon to stop in Little Cup. Extreme Speed eliminates most of the options that rely on priority or use a Choice Scarf. The only possible revenge killers are really Choice Scarf Ghosts, Choice Scarf Magnemite, Choice Scarf Gligar, and certain Choice Scarf Rock-types. Every other Pokemon will probably be OHKOed by Extreme Speed or outpaced and destroyed by Outrage or Waterfall.</p> <p>The best way to reliably beat Dratini is to not let it set up. If you need to sacrifice a Pokemon to keep Dratini from setting up, you should probably do it. After that you can send something in that's faster than 14 Speed and bulky enough to take an Extreme Speed to take care of Dratini before it can set up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Dratini is one of the most dangerous Pokemon in Little Cup thanks to its excellent movepool, solid Attack, and good Speed after a boost. After a Dragon Dance, Dratini reaches a whopping 25 Attack and 21 Speed, making it faster than every Pokemon in the metagame not carrying a Choice Scarf. With 25 Attack, STAB Outrage is terrifying for all but the most physically bulky Pokemon, and those with a resistance to Dragon. Basically, the only Pokemon who can avoid being 2HKOed by Outrage are Bronzor, Shieldon, and Aron (to demonstrate Outrage's raw power, other than Steel types, only max HP / Def Onix with a nature boost and Oran Berry has any chance of surviving two +1 Life Orb boosted Outrages. And Onix won't last against Water attacks.). Waterfall is used to OHKO Aron and Shieldon after a Dragon Dance, and it also hits Bronzor for a solid 3HKO with Oran Berry factored in; however, Waterfall can 2HKO if it has a low damage roll followed by a high one since this avoids Oran Berry being activated. Without Life Orb, Dratini can't OHKO Aron with Waterfall. This means that if you opt for Oran Berry, Aqua Tail is the preferred option since it is able to OHKO Aron most of the time, and it's a guaranteed OHKO if Aron has switched into Stealth Rock once before.</p> <p>Dratini's true strength lies in its fourth move: Extreme Speed. Extreme Speed on a Pokemon with Dragon Dance is extremely difficult to stop, as the normal methods of revenge killing with priority or fast Choice Scarf users aren't as effective. Many of the most popular hard-hitting Choice Scarf users in Little Cup are vulnerable to being OHKOed by Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock. Also, priority is not an option to revenge kill Dratini since it's faster than every other common priority user, will hit first with Extreme Speed, and can OHKO some of the main priority users, such as Croagunk, Diglett, and Houndour, after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Adamant nature is recommended as the extra power comes into play more often than the boost from 21 Speed to 22 Speed. With Jolly, you have a significantly lower chance to OHKO Aron with a +1 Waterfall, and miss out on the chance to OHKO Gligar with a +1 Outrage without Stealth Rock. Oran Berry can be used over Life Orb, but Adamant should remain as Dratini needs all the firepower it can get.</p> <p>Dratini's biggest problem is finding the time to set up, even with its decent defenses and great defensive typing. What helps Dratini set up most are Pokemon like Wynaut and dual screen users such as Abra or Bronzor. After dual screens, many Pokemon are essentially turned into set-up bait, and Dratini can safely come in and set up on them. Wynaut is great at getting Pokemon free turns with Encore, and Dratini appreciates this more than most, since with just one free turn of set up, Dratini can plow through a team.</p> <p>Dratini has problems with Choice Scarf Pokemon who can take an Extreme Speed and are faster than 21 Speed. Choice Scarf Magnemite and Gastly are perfect Pokemon to stop a Dratini sweep. Neither can quite OHKO Dratini (barring Explosion), but Magnemite's Hidden Power Ice and Gastly's Sludge Bomb will both do well over 70% to Dratini, which is generally enough to stop a sweep. Munchlax helps Dratini against both of those Pokemon, taking little damage from either Pokemon, while Pursuit and Earthquake take care of Gastly and Magnemite respectively.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>This set focuses on Dratini's excellent coverage and utility with Extreme Speed. Due to Substitute, this set is much more versatile than the other sets that Dratini can use. For example, similar to the Dragon Dance set, it can take advantage of the opponent's switches. It also can lure in and destroy Pokemon like Bronzor in the same way as the mixed set. It also works as a decent revenge killer with Extreme Speed.</p> <p>The EVs given allow Dratini to outpace many of the Pokemon who don't invest in Speed due to being bulky or having priority while also retaining enough power to deal with Bronzor. Outrage takes out Pokemon such as Munchlax, and will most likely OHKO whatever comes in, unless they outpace Dratini. Draco Meteor is a decent alternative, however, because it doesn't lock Dratini into one move and avoids confusion.</p> <p>With a Substitute up Dratini is quite dangerous, meaning Pokemon who aid Dratini's set up are recommended. For example, this set works quite well with Wynaut because of its ability to get Dratini an easy Substitute with Encore and Tickle. Mantyke is another good example of a Pokemon who Dratini benefits from because it lures in Pokemon such as Chinchou who practically give Dratini a free turn.</p> <p>Since Dratini makes such a good Bronzor and Munchlax lure, Pokemon who are countered by these two defensive Pokemon greatly appreciate Dratini's presence. With Bronzor out of the way, Pokemon such as Bagon, Taillow, and Gligar will have a much easier time sweeping. Munchlax walls many special attackers such as Gastly, so they will have an easier time functioning with Munchlax gone.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Priority Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With three coverage moves and a powerful priority attack, Dratini can make an excellent mixed priority attacker. The basic strategy of the set is to pick off Steel-types and bulky Rock-types with Fire Blast and Surf, while hurting any Choice Scarfer that comes in. If you hit something relatively frail with Fire Blast or Surf, Dratini can usually finish them off with Extreme Speed. Once these Pokemon are out of the way, and your opponent has nothing that can take a powerful Dragon-type attack, use Outrage and watch your opponent's team crumble.</p> <p>The mixed priority sweeper uses purely offensive EVs, as it needs to do as much damage as possible. First, it maximizes Attack to do as much damage as possible with its two main attacks, Outrage and Extreme Speed. 116 Special Attack EVs guarantee that Fire Blast 2HKOes Bronzor, and as a bonus, Surf followed by Fire Blast (but not vice versa) always KOes as well, as it avoids activating Oran Berry.</p> <p>This Dratini works well as a wall breaking sweeper, making offensive support unnecessary; however, Dratini does need some serious defensive support. As Ghost-types like Drifloon and Gastly can switch into Extreme Speed, using a Pursuiter like Munchlax or Stunky is helpful as they can trap and KO Ghost-types with Pursuit. If a bulky Choice Scarfer who can survive an Extreme Speed comes in to revenge kill Dratini, having something to soak the hit will stop you from having to sacrifice. Machop is a very common bulky Choice Scarf Pokemon, and nothing stops Machop better than Slowpoke due to its ability, Own Tempo. Slowpoke's opportunities to spread paralysis helps Dratini in the long run.</p> <p>This set also makes a great Baton Pass recipient, benefiting from any Attack, Special Attack, and Speed boosts passed to it, while also having great coverage.</p>"
      },
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Dratini has the rare ability to 2HKO almost every Pokemon with a STAB move followed by a priority attack. Against the top leads, all Dratini needs to do is Protect versus Fake Out leads like Chimchar and Meowth, then use Draco Meteor followed by Extreme Speed. Surf 2HKOes Phanpy, meaning it needs to pick whether to set up Stealth Rock or KO Dratini with Ice Shard. Leads such as Kabuto and Gligar also find themselves in a similar situation with Aqua Jet and Quick Attack respectively. Hippopotas has a chance to OHKO Dratini with Earthquake and sandstorm damage, but Dratini 2HKOes with Surf meaning it will not be able to set up Stealth Rock if it attacks. Fire Blast hurts Bronzor and easily OHKOes lead Snover, but hail and its Blizzard will KO Dratini at the end of the turn.</p> <p>At first glance, Dratini may seem like an inferior Houndour, but its true strengths lie in Extreme Speed and its typing. Unlike Houndour, Dratini's priority attack doesn't rely on the opponent using an attack for it to work, so Pokemon like Diglett will have trouble with Dratini even though they have none with Houndour. Dratini is also fast enough to outpace lead Houndour and Phanpy.</p> <p>Once Dratini has KOed the opponent's lead with Draco Meteor, it is extremely vulnerable to Substitute sweepers, especially ones that resist or are immune to Extreme Speed. Drifloon is the most obvious example. If Drifloon uses Substitute until Dratini has very little Special Attack left, it will likely get to keep its Substitute after your second or third attack. Drifloon is definitely something you don't want behind a Substitute, so packing a Ghost-type switch-in like Stunky is a good choice. Keeping Wynaut around is a good idea because it can come in and Encore on a set up move from the many Pokemon who will try to set up against a -2 Special Attack Dratini.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Dratini packs an excellent special movepool, but only has a mediocre base 50 Special Attack stat to work with. However, Dratini still has enough power to OHKO many Pokemon with either a super effective attack or STAB Draco Meteor, allowing it to be an effective revenge killer. Draco Meteor severely damages almost anything that doesn't resist Dragon-type attacks, even from only 15 Special Attack, while Fire Blast will stop Bronzor and Magnemite from being comfortable switching in. Ice Beam takes care of Swords Dance Gligar in case it manages to set up, while Outrage fits into the last slot to hit specially bulky Pokemon hard. Surf can be used over Ice Beam if you want to always OHKO Aron; however, you miss the guaranteed OHKO on Gligar.</p> <p>This set uses a specially oriented EV spread, as the main attacks are special. After Special Attack and Speed are maximized with 196 EVs each, 84 EVs are put into Attack to give Outrage a little extra kick. The remaining EVs are put into HP to give Dratini better overall defenses.</p> <p>Offensively, this Dratini set really helps out Pokemon like Gligar who want Bronzor gone because of its ability to lure out and deal major damage to it with Fire Blast. It also helps Pokemon like Machop and Mankey who want Ghost-types removed from battle, because they will often switch into Dratini expecting a Dragon Dance, only to be met with a Draco Meteor. Drifloon might try to set up after the Special Attack drop, but with Choice Scarf it will be outsped and 2HKOed by Draco Meteor.</p> <p>Dratini will require a good amount of defensive support because of the downside of using Draco Meteor. The Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor allows many bulkier sweepers to come in and set up, meaning some counters are needed for these Pokemon. An example of a particularly threatening bulky sweeper is Gligar, who can set up Rock Polish on Dratini after the Special Attack drop. Gligar can be easily taken care of by Duskull, who can burn it and hit it with Ice Beam. Drifloon can come in and set up Substitute on Dratini, which can be very dangerous if you don't have a Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Houndour or Stunky to switch in and revenge kill it.</p>"

Sentret works best as a Trick Room sweeper; unfortunately, Sentret is outclassed by Whismur and Munchlax as a Trick Room sweeper due to their higher offensive stats. What sets Sentret apart is a powerful priority attack in Sucker Punch, allowing it to pick off weakened Pokemon even when Trick Room isn't in effect.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Sentret has Flamethrower and Fire Punch, which allow it to hit Bronzor harder than with any of its other moves. Super Fang can be used to hurt opposing Pokemon, bringing them down to half of their HP. However, many Pokemon carry Oran Berry, so they'll recover most, if not all, of that HP immediately. Quick Attack can be used as a weaker priority move that is guaranteed to hit. Lastly, U-turn can be used to scout the opponent's switch-in, but is not recommended due to Sentret's poor Speed. Aqua Tail is a good option to hurt bulky Pokemon such as Onix, while providing good coverage. Sentret can also use Trick with an Iron Ball to outspeed counters and render them useless. Assist is also an option, making Sentret's moves harder to predict.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>When not under Trick Room, almost every Pokemon can outspeed Sentret. Machop can use Dynamic Punch, Mankey can use Close Combat or U-turn, and Croagunk can use Fake Out and Vacuum Wave to ensure Sentret's demise. When under Trick Room, Bronzor is no doubt the best counter, walling Sentret completely unless it carries a Fire attack and sometimes even underspeeding it. Under Trick Room, Munchlax can switch in on Thunderbolt or Ice Beam and proceed to outspeed and OHKO Sentret with Return. Magnemite and Aron are also decent counters, not getting hurt by any attack except for Brick Break (which is not common on Sentret).</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Sentret has a terrible Speed stat, but under Trick Room, it can be one of the fastest Pokemon in Little Cup. Return is a very strong STAB move and is the move Sentret will be using most often. Brick Break can also be used to hurt Steel-type Pokemon, and offers more coverage. Sucker Punch is a very powerful move, and priority is always useful in a fast-paced metagame like Little Cup. It also acts as insurance when Trick Room isn't in effect. U-turn can also be used in place of Sucker Punch to scout for counters, and allows Sentret to escape from danger. A combination of Ice Beam and Thunderbolt provides very good coverage, forming the BoltBeam combination which hits all Pokemon in Little Cup at least neutrally, except for Magnemite.</p> <p>A Speed-reducing nature and 0 Speed IVs bring Sentret to a low 7 Speed stat, allowing it to outrun almost every single Pokemon in Trick Room. Bronzor completely walls this set, so a teammate who can effectively deal with Bronzor is helpful; Houndour and Magnemite do the job well. The former can set up a Substitute before hitting Bronzor hard with Fire Blast, while the latter can trap Bronzor with Magnet Pull and deal a lot of damage with Thunderbolt. While it has a large movepool, Sentret's offensive stats are still fairly poor, meaning unless it is hitting something frail for super effective damage, it will not deal a lot of damage. Gligar is helpful as it deals with Croagunk, who would otherwise defeat Sentret with a combination of Fake Out and Vacuum Wave. If needed, Gligar can even use U-turn to scout the opponent's team. However, most (if not all) teammates should be carrying a Speed-reducing nature along with 0 Speed IVs because Trick Room may be in effect. Bronzor is a good candidate for setting up Trick Room since it is also able to lay down Stealth Rock, making Sentret's job of damaging the opponent's Pokemon easier. Snubbull may seem to outclass this set, having Intimidate, a higher Attack stat, and pefect coverage, but what sets Sentret apart is a powerful priority move in Sucker Punch and the ability to scout the opponent's team with U-turn.</p>"

Its offensive stats aren't very good, while its low defenses mean that it can't surive very long in battle. The fact that it is weak to Stealth Rock makes Hoothoot even worse. However, with a decent movepool and an average Special Defense stat, Hoothoot can actually be viable. Overall, Hoothoot is one of those Pokemon who need a lot of support in order to function, but when given the right support, can accomplish its job well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Hoothoot has many other options it can choose from, but most are simply not worth it. Psycho Shift can be used in tandem with a Flame Orb to burn a physical sweeper, but Hoothoot is too frail, and is usually better off attacking anyway. Reflect is an option to prevent physical sweepers from running all over your team, but is usually better left to a bulkier Pokemon such as Bronzor. Feather Dance can also be utilized to soften the blows of physical attackers, but Hoothoot does not have enough bulk for it to work well. Roost allows Hoothoot to have more longevity, except that it gets OHKOed or 2HKOed by many moves, so much so that is it not worth it. Toxic can be used to cripple a bulkier Pokemon such as Munchlax. Whirlwind can be used to phaze Pokemon, and is best used with entry hazards, but again, Hoothoot is too frail to make good use out of it. Attract allows Hoothoot to incapacitate an opponent half the time, but if the opposing Pokemon has the same gender as Hoothoot, it will fail. Agility is an option over Choice Scarf to boost Hoothoot's mediocre Speed, but it loses out on coverage, which is quite important, as Hoothoot relies on super effective attacks to deal damage.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Most Pokemon who have decent bulk and relatively high offensive stats will usually defeat Hoothoot, because Hoothoot is not very powerful, and also quite frail. Good Pokemon who can take any of Hoothoot's special attacks include Munchlax and Mantyke, who have a high Special Defense stat, and good offensive stats to deal with Hoothoot. Powerful counters who can quickly knock out Hoothoot include Voltorb, Buizel, and priority users like Swinub. In most cases, any Pokemon who can take a hit or two from Hoothoot will fare well against it.</p>",

Heat Wave easily melts Steel- and Ice-types, who would otherwise pose a threat to Hoothoot. Finally, Shadow Ball helps Hoothoot dispatch Ghost- and Psychic-types.</p> <p>With a Choice Scarf attached, Hoothoot hits 22 Speed, outspeeding all non-Choice Scarf Pokemon.

A Rapid Spinner would also be appreciated so Hoothoot doesn't lose a chunk of HP every time it switches in. Hoothoot is also a great counter to Shroomish and Paras thanks to its ability, Insomnia, and it's able to OHKO the both of them with a STAB Air Slash.</p> <p>A great teammate for Hoothoot is Munchlax; its high Special Defense stat means it can take special Ice- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Hoothoot with little effort. Bronzor's high Defense and capability of setting up Stealth Rock also helps Hoothoot out, being able to switch into threats such as Aron. Machop's offensive strength can take out Rock- and Steel-types that Hoothoot might have trouble with. Magnemite can also be a helpful teammate as it resists all of Hoothoot's weaknesses, and Hoothoot can switch in on the Ground-type attacks that Magenemite often attracts.</p>"

Brick Break can be used if you don't like Mach Punch's Base Power. Return and Double-Edge are always decent options. Drain Punch and Giga Drain are interesting choices, but usually not good enough to make it onto a set.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Countering Baton Pass Ledyba is very difficult if it has a Substitute up. If you have something faster with Encore, like Abra, you can try to Encore it, but if it has used Agility, it probably won't be staying in. Ledyba doesn't run any priority on the Baton Pass set, so hitting it with moves like Ice Shard and Aqua Jet is a safe bet. In fact, just attacking is probably your best option. The dual screens set is stopped by Brick Break, but Ledyba can easily Encore it. Taunt users, like Stunky, do very well against these sets. Also, anything initially faster with Ledyba that isn't using a Choice item can do a fair job of scaring Ledyba off.</p> <p>Swords Dance Ledyba without Ice Punch is beaten by Phanpy easily. Chinchou also does well against it thanks to STAB Thunderbolt and its natural bulk. Slugma can threaten to burn Ledyba with Flame Body and hit it with a super effective Lava Plume. The Swarming Sweeper is very weak to priority, so anything with priority not named Mach Punch or Vacuum Wave can handle it. Munchlax and Mantyke can stop it thanks to their huge Special Defense.</p>",

      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>This set is very similar to Baton Pass Gligar. The only main difference is Ledyba can use Encore, which is a huge benefit. Come in on someone like Bronzor or Omanyte, and Encore Stealth Rock and Spikes respectively. Ledyba is also a good choice to come in on Paras, since it resists both of its STABs and Early Bird lets it absorb sleep. From there, you can either set up a Substitute, or you can immediately start using Agility or Swords Dance. Bug Buzz can be used as a way to make Wynaut much more wary about coming in and using Encore, although Ledyba can Baton Pass right out of there.</p> <p>Liechi Berry is useful if you are running Agility, since it allows Ledyba to Baton Pass Attack as well as Speed. Petaya Berry also works well with Agility. Salac Berry works best if you are passing Swords Dance, not only because you get to pass Speed, but because Ledyba isn't exactly lightning fast. All three items work best when combined with Substitute, though. If you are running Bug Buzz over Substitute, then Oran Berry can be used to increase Ledyba's chances of pulling off a successful Baton Pass.</p> <p>Ledyba can Baton Pass to just about anything in the metagame. Honestly, the only limit of Baton Pass receivers is your imagination. However, Numel and Bidoof get a special mention, since they have the Simple ability. This can turn them into extremely potent sweepers very quickly. Cubone with Thick Club also appreciates an Agility being passed to it. Elekid, who already has high Speed, appreciates a Swords Dance being passed to it. Ledyba is also a good choice for a Baton Pass Chain, thanks to Encore. Ledyba does appreciate having Rapid Spin support. Squirtle and Baltoy make excellent teammates for Ledyba because of this.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Ledyba is an excellent user of Light Screen and Reflect. Ledyba's main selling point as a dual screener is that it can use U-turn to escape from Wynaut's Shadow Tag. This alone gives Ledyba an edge over other dual screeners. Encore is useful against Pokemon like Bronzor and Omanyte using Stealth Rock, allowing Ledyba time to set up Light Screen and Reflect. Roost is helpful if you are running Light Clay, since it gives Ledyba a form of recovery. It is also great when you consider that Ledyba's 50% of its Hit Points upon each switch-in thanks to Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Oran Berry is almost always the way to go, considering Ledyba's weakness to Stealth Rock. However, Light Clay is certainly an option, giving your sweepers a better chance to set up. As expected, Ledyba really needs Rapid Spin support to shine. Squirtle and Baltoy are the best options, since Squirtle covers Ledyba's Ice- and Fire-type weaknesses, while Baltoy deals with its Electric- and Rock-type weaknesses. Kabuto can also work, considering Ledyba covers Kabuto's Fighting- and Ground-type weaknesses extremely well. A Ghost-type is also useful, since it can come in on Counter just in case Wynaut uses it when Ledyba U-turns.</p> <p>Setup sweepers are the teammates you want for this set. Nasty Plot Houndour is easily the best choice. Ledyba covers two of Houndour's weaknesses with ease, while Houndour can use Fire-type moves aimed at Ledyba as a way to activate Flash Fire. Dratini can come in on Electric- and Fire-type moves and use Dragon Dance. Larvitar and Aron can easily switch in on Rock-type moves and use Rock Polish. Agility Chinchou and Swords Dance Totodile also greatly appreciate dual screens, so they are great teammates as well. Swords Dance Anorith may share a Rock-type weakness with Ledyba, but the sheer power of it under screens makes it a good option. With Light Screen up, Rain Dance Mantyke shrugs off any non-Electric-type special move.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Even with Ledyba's pathetic base 20 Attack, Ledyba can be a decent Swords Dance sweeper with a movepool that is slightly better than the average Bug-type's. Bug Bite is going to be your main form of STAB. In Little Cup, Bug Bite is a fantastic move, since it allows you to heal using your opponents' Oran Berries. Mach Punch provides Ledyba with good coverage and a form of priority. The last moveslot is pretty much your preference. Aerial Ace gets STAB, and combined with Bug Bite and Mach Punch, hits everything in Little Cup for at least neutral damage. Ice Punch is useful against Flying- and Ground-types, especially Gligar. Thunder Punch hits Mantyke for an OHKO, and hits Water- and Flying-types hard. Baton Pass also gets small mention, since it allows Ledyba to get out of there when something like Phanpy comes in while passing the Swords Dance.</p> <p>Ledyba has poor Attack, so Life Orb is recommended above all other items. Oran Berry is still an option due to Ledyba's horrible Stealth Rock weakness. Jolly nature is suggested over Adamant since Ledyba has only average Speed, and Swords Dance boosts its Attack. Adamant is still a viable option, since Mach Punch does somewhat make up for Ledyba's Speed.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is an absolute must for this set if you are running Life Orb. Baltoy is your best option, since it can Rapid Spin as well as set up Stealth Rock, which all offensive Pokemon adore. Baltoy can also run dual screens, which makes setting up Swords Dance much easier for Ledyba. Squirtle is also a good partner for Ledyba, as is Kabuto. Kabuto also gets the benefit of being able to support Ledyba with Stealth Rock. Phanpy is a big problem for this set due to Ice Shard and its physical bulk. Bulky Water-types like Slowpoke and the previously mentioned Squirtle can be big assets to Ledyba.</p>"
      },
      "Agility": {
        "description": "<p>This is probably Ledyba's most famous set. It's a one-time use set, but Ledyba can rip holes through teams during that time. The magic of this set is Swarm, which raises Bug Buzz's Base Power to a fantastic 180 when Ledyba is at one-third of its HP.</p> <p>The best thing to do is switch Ledyba in on a Choice-locked Ground- or Fighting-type move. Ledyba will take little damage, or no damage thanks to its immunity to Ground, from these moves. Use this as a chance to use Agility. From there, just keep using Substitute until you activate Petaya Berry. Then, proceed to sweep. Bug Buzz is going to be Ledyba's main form of doing damage. Hidden Power Flying hits Fighting-types for super effective damage and gains STAB. It also hits Levitating Ghost-types. Hidden Power Ground hits Fire-, Electric-, Steel-, and Poison-types super effectively. Baton Pass can be used as a last ditch effort to pass Ledyba's boosts when you think Ledyba's time is done.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support isn't necessary for this set, but it is still recommended, so Squirtle and Baltoy are great teammates. However, Stealth Rock and dual screens support are a huge help. Lead Kabuto and Phanpy are two excellent Stealth Rock users to use on a team with Ledyba. Bronzor is also a fine choice, since it can support Ledyba with both Stealth Rock and dual screens. Heatproof Bronzor can actually prove useful with Ledyba, since it will lure in Ground-type moves for Ledyba to take advantages of. Dual screening Electric-types, like Mareep, are good teammates as well, since they draw in Electric-type moves like honey to ants. If you are running Baton Pass, having a special sweeper that can take advantage of the Petaya boost is always nice. Houndour and Gastly are two great examples.</p>"

    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Around 70% of people are arachnophobic, and when you look at cute little Spinarak, it's hard to understand why. Although Spinarak has a sizable movepool, it lacks many useful moves and its average stats usually make it fall behind its competition. However, Spinarak has some interesting quirks that can give it the edge over some of the other Pokemon in Little Cup.</p> <p>Spinarak is the only Pokemon in Little Cup that can Baton Pass a trapping move, something which can set up a match winning sweep. It is also one of the very few Pokemon with access to Toxic Spikes. Add in access to one of the better abilities in the game, Insomnia, and you have yourself a scary little creepy crawly ready to fight.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Spinarak has a quite good movepool, but it lacks the stats to use most of its other moves effectively. It could work on a Trick Room team with its priority moves and a moveset consisting of Bug Bite, Poison Jab, and Double-Edge. In most cases, however, Spinarak's mediocre Attack will let it down. Spinarak also gets some interesting options such as Body Slam, Poison Jab, Thief, and Swagger, but for the most part you will not get the chance to use them and there are more reliable Pokemon that can perform similar tasks with actual status moves.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Anything that can stop Spinarak from setting up make good counters; first off, Taunters shut down almost any set that Spinarak will be running. Almost any user of the move will work thanks to Spinarak's low Speed. Grounded Poison-types will ruin the Toxic Spikes set's efforts, as can Rapid Spinners. Staryu gets a special mention, as Natural Cure will remove its poison status after spinning the Toxic Spikes away. The previously mentioned Shellder will be able to force out any Spinarak set that leads. As for the Baton Pass set, you should concentrate more on beating Spinarak's target than stopping Spinarak itself. As it will most often be passing a Speed boost, your best bet is to use priority users or a Pokemon with Thunder Wave. Phanpy can take most unboosted physical attacks, while Ice Shard will hit recipients like Gligar for super effective damage. Croagunk is known for its amazing amount of priority options, even Seel does well as it can hit most of Spinarak's likely Baton Pass targets for super effective damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Spinarak holds the title as the only Pokemon in Little Cup that can trap pass, and this set is designed to make the most of it. Spider Web traps the opponent and allows Spinarak to Baton Pass to a counter who can set up on the victim, possibly resulting in a match winning sweep. This set can sometimes be hard to pull off, but is really quite rewarding when it works.</p> <p>In the other moveslots, moves aimed to help Spinarak get the trap pass off are used; Bug Bite is the preferred option in the third slot as it can help Spinarak steal the opponent's Berry, either an Oran Berry to restore health, or if you're lucky, a pinch Berry to give Spinarak an extra boost to pass on. Protect should be used over Bug Bite if you use this set as a lead, as it will keep your Focus Sash intact. The last slot is designed to make Spinarak's job easier; Agility is preferred as it lets you get enough Speed to outspeed your opponent, and gives you something useful to pass if you're threatened by the switch-in. Substitute gives Spinarak protection from status and something useful to pass, but nine times out of ten Agility will work better.</p> <p>The given EV spread optimizes Spinarak's chance of getting its Baton Pass off successfully. The extra Speed point puts Spinarak at 10 Speed, which is enough to outspeed almost every unboosted Pokemon after an Agility, and allows you to safely pass it. Spinarak has its defenses weighted towards the physical side because there is only one special priority move, Vacuum Wave, which Spinarak 4x resists. This spread also helps Spinarak set up on the ever present Fighting-types in Little Cup. With an Oran Berry attached, Spinarak is never 2HKOed by any move used by Fighting-types in Little Cup, bar two Machop Rock Slides with high damage rolls. Focus Sash should be used if you plan on leading with Spinarak.</p> <p>Spinarak doesn't get many other options; Endure may be used with a pinch Berry and Agility to Baton Pass +2 Speed and +1 in an attack stat simultaneously. If you choose to do so, Endure should be used in third slot. Be warned, however, that doing so will result in Spinarak being vulnerable to Taunt.</p> <p>This set has difficulties with any Pokemon that can KO Spinarak before it can pass its boost. Of these, Fire-types are generally the best bet as they can hit Spinarak super effectively as well as having a resistance to Spinarak's Bug Bite. Choice Scarf users are also a problem as they will outspeed Spinarak even after an Agility and can stop Spinarak from doing its job with Trick. For these reasons, Staryu makes a great partner to Spinarak; it can come in on both Fire-types and Trick without much worry and can even use Rapid Spin to get rid of the opponent's Stealth Rock. The prime candidate for a recipient is Gligar; Gligar resists the Fighting-type moves Spinarak will be setting up on, is neutral to Rock-type attacks, and can set up on trapped Pokemon with Swords Dance or even continue a Baton Pass chain.</p>"

      "Toxic Spikes Lead": {
        "description": "<p>There aren't many Pokemon in Little Cup that have access to Toxic Spikes, which gives Spinarak a niche. Almost every Toxic Spikes user is outclassed by Tentacool, which has significantly higher bulk and added access to Rapid Spin; however, Spinarak finds itself with some interesting options and quirks that set it apart from the jellyfish.</p> <p>The moves and EV spread given ensure that Spinarak will win as many lead matchups as possible. Toxic Spikes are a given, as otherwise there is little reason to use Spinarak. You will always get at least one layer down, as you can't be put to sleep, while Protect plus Focus Sash means you will never be OHKOed by anything short of a multi-hit move. The only common lead that threatens Spinarak is Shellder, due to its access to Rock Blast. Bug Bite shortens the lifespan of bulky leads, such as Phanpy and Hippopotas, by stealing their Oran Berries, and with the set's bulk, you should be able to get a layer of Toxic Spikes down too, unless they are carrying a Rock-type move. The last move can be used to take out Gastly who is always OHKOed (or 2HKOed by Shadow Sneak) and can't put you to sleep. Shadow Sneak should be used if you are worried about Substitute and want a more reliable move.</p> <p>The EVs are designed to make Spinarak's job easier; there is enough bulk so that Spinarak will never be 2HKOed by Lead Machop's Ice Punch, as well as enough Attack to sometimes OHKO lead Snover with Bug Bite, while always getting the knockout on Gastly. You will still be slower than Machop to avoid the stronger Payback, while still outspeeding Bronzor so you can put a layer of Toxic Spikes down before stealing its Berry.</p> <p>Spinarak's options are too sparse to try and do anything else with the set. It does get novelties in Bounce and Dig to increase Toxic stalling damage, but as a lead it won't be surviving long after its done its job. Its subpar defenses result in other options, such as Agility, from really helping more than the moves already on the set. Poison Jab can be used in the last slot to ensure a definite KO on Snover and attempt to spread more poison, but you will find yourself wanting the priority move more often than not.</p> <p>This set has a specific job of setting down a layer or two of Toxic Spikes. Not much can stop this, but some leads do give it trouble. The most notable of these is a Scarfed Shellder who can KO Spinarak through Focus Sash with its ability Skill Link. In addition, it won't be overly successful against Pokemon that will be setting up strong Substitutes. Bronzor and Phanpy get special mentions as great teammates for Spinarak as they can set up alternate hazards in the form of Stealth Rock, while taking little damage from Shellder and other common leads such as Gligar and Aipom.</p>"

Don't be fooled by all its cuteness, Pichu is a Pokemon that an opponent should think twice about before reacting.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Pichu doesn't have many other options, but a special set utilizing either Choice Specs or Nasty Plot could work. Unfortunately, Pichu would probably be knocked out by the opposing Pokemon before it even had a chance to Nasty Plot.

Common users are Dratini who carry Extreme Speed and Croagunk who carry Fake Out, Sucker Punch, and Vacuum Wave. Chinchou is another good counter, gaining health from Electric-type attacks thanks to Volt Absorb, taking pitiful damage from Pichu's other attacks, while being able to set up Agility before defeating Pichu. Finally, any Pokemon who outspeeds Pichu can be considered a counter, Pichu is so frail that most attacks will take a good chunk away from its health. Pichu relies on outspeeding opponents, so when Pichu is slower, it will almost always lose.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Pichu is not very powerful, but this set attempts to remedy this problem by boosting Pichu's Attack stat with Choice Band. Volt Tackle is Pichu's most powerful STAB attack, and should be used early in the game to hit opponents hard, though the recoil damage is a turn-off. Thunder Punch is a reliable STAB attack with no recoil damage, though it is fairly weak. Toxic can be used instead of Thunder Punch to cripple an incoming wall such as Gligar, who would otherwise completely wall Pichu. Return provides good neutral coverage, and hits Pokemon who resist Electric hard. Iron Tail allows Pichu to hurt bulky Rock-type Pokemon such as Onix, but does not have much utility outside of that.</p> <p>Pichu greatly appreciates the extra power gained from Choice Band, which turns 3HKOs into 2HKOs. Pichu can also hold a Choice Scarf, boosting its Speed to 24, meaning it can outspeed all un-Scarfed Pokemon, as well as Scarfed Pokemon who sit at 15 Speed. While an Adamant nature is tempting to use, Pichu will almost always benefit more from the extra Speed that Jolly provides, allowing it to outspeed and get the all-important first strike on certain Pokemon such as Mantyke. The EV spread maximizes Pichu's most important stats, Attack and Speed, while the remaining EVs are dumped into HP, allowing Pichu to take more recoil damage, as well as increasing its bulk slightly.</p> <p>Bronzor and Nosepass are good teammates who can greatly benefit Pichu, both being able to set up Stealth Rock, while the former is immune to Pichu's only weakness, and the latter can spread paralysis throughout the opposing team. Choice Scarf Gligar is also a good teammate, being able to comfortably switch into Earthquake, as well as scouting the opponent's switches with U-turn, thus gaining momentum for your team.</p>"

      "Life Orb": {"description": "<p>With Life Orb, Pichu still receives the boost in power, while also retaining the freedom to switch moves. Volt Tackle is Pichu's most powerful STAB attack, with a downside of recoil damage. Thunderbolt is used over Thunder Punch due to its higher Base Power, and hits most Pokemon harder. Return provides decent neutral coverage, and is relatively powerful. Finally, Hidden Power Ice hits Ground- and Grass-types for super effective damage, who would otherwise easily switch in and force Pichu out.</p> <p>Volt Tackle is Pichu's strongest attack, it is also a physical move, therefore most of Pichu's EVs are invested into Attack, to allow Pichu to hit as hard as possible. However, EVs can be shifted as you see fit from Attack to Special Attack so that Pichu can hit harder with Thunderbolt and Hidden Power. Maximum Speed with a Hasty nature should always be used to outspeed common Pokemon who sit at 15 Speed and below.</p>"},
      "Encore": {
        "description": "<p>Pichu is the only Electric-type in the tier who has access to Encore, and is one of the only support moves Pichu can make good use of. Encore allows Pichu to force switches and scout; Pichu can Encore a non-damaging move, then set up a Substitute as they switch, before hitting the switch-in with the correct move. Thunderbolt is Pichu's main attack, and will be hurting most Pokemon who don't resist it. Hidden Power Ice complements Thunderbolt well, forming the excellent BoltBeam combination, in which no Pokemon in the tier resists bar Magnemite and Chinchou.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Pichu's Special Attack and Speed stats, while increasing its HP by one point, allowing it to create four Substitutes. Pichu can utilize its Attack stat if you wish, opting for Thunder Punch and Return instead of Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice, though this is not recommended because it offers worse coverage and a weaker STAB attack. If a physical set is used, the EV spread should be 116 HP / 196 Atk / 196 Spe. Pichu greatly benefits from paralysis support, allowing it to come in on a non-damaging move from a Pokemon who would normally be faster than it and force them out. A good teammate is Nosepass, who has the bulk to spread paralysis throughout the opponent's team, while also being able to set up Stealth Rock, which is invaluable as Pichu will be forcing switches often. Note that both Pokemon are weak to Ground-type attacks, so a Pokemon such as Mantyke, who can switch in freely and fend off Ground-type Pokemon, will be helpful.</p>"

Believe it or not, Natu does bring some valuable resistances to the table despite its mediocre defenses; x4 resistance to Fighting-type moves and x2 resistance to Grass-type moves can come in handy. As an added bonus, it also has a Ground-type immunity. With these resistances, Natu has an ample amount of opportunity to support the team with the right prediction and support. Last but not least, U-turn gives it a slight advantage over Abra as it lessens the prediction needed to keep Munchlax and Stunky from potentially trapping it. Overall, Natu is definitely an interesting Pokemon and should not be overlooked.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Natu has a couple of sweet support moves: Trick Room, Thunder Wave, and Psycho Shift. Natu could set up Trick Room with ease, and then employ U-turn to safely bring in your attacker. Thunder Wave could cripple Natu's common switch-ins. A set with Psycho Shift / Baton Pass / Calm Mind / Psychic could work well in theory. Natu with Flame Orb can pass a burn to Stunky, Munchlax, and other Fighting-types, and Natu can set up Calm Mind in front of Stunky and Munchlax once their physical prowess have been drastically reduced. If you're looking to weather the physical hits that are dished at Natu, it can run an EV spread of 196 HP / 236 Def / 76 SpD.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>On the Choice (Special) set, Bronzor is the safest switch-in as it resists Psychic and it can use a free turn to set up Stealth Rock, or take Natu down with Flash Cannon. Munchlax and Stunky also switch in with impunity, although U-turn can bring about their demise if they are lured in, trapped and subsequently executed by Diglett. Munchlax can use Pursuit to take Natu down, while Stunky has a Psychic immunity, allowing it to safely come in and trap Natu, it also has STAB on Pursuit. Houndour can cause problems if it switches into Heat Wave.</p> <p>Gligar and Bronzor can handle the physical set quite well. Bronzor can take Heat Wave from Natu and strike back with Flash Cannon or set up Stealth Rock. Defensive Gligar works in a similar fashion to Bronzor, as it can shrug off any attack and strike back with Stone Edge or set up Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Natu can function as an effective Choice user with its good Speed and Special Attack stat. The choice between the items depends on what you're planning to do with Natu. Choice Specs allows Natu to hit as hard as possible, while Choice Scarf boosts its Speed to 25 - an excellent Speed benchmark to hit the Little Cup metagame. This ensures that Natu is not outpaced by the likes of Mankey and Houndour. Psychic and Heat Wave provide optimal coverage alongside each other, while Hidden Power Fighting deals with the pesky Munchlax. U-turn is the crux of the set, allowing Natu to escape from Stunky's grasp.</p> <p>Natu's STAB options are pretty mediocre to begin with, since there are a number of Pokemon that resist both Psychic- and Flying-type attacks. In the absence of a decent Flying-type option, Natu can only muster Psychic for its main STAB move, which allows it to strike Fighting-types for super effective damage, as well as Munchlax for a 3HKO. With Choice Specs equipped, Heat Wave will always 2HKO Bronzor on the switch -- a common switch-in to this set, with a 2.56% chance of OHKOing Bronzor with Stealth Rock down. Shadow Ball could be used over Heat Wave to hit Psychic-types for super effective damage, along with Bronzor for neutral damage. However, Bronzor and Steel-types in general are far more common than Psychic-types. Hidden Power Fighting is Natu's more reliable move against Stunky, as Heat Wave's accuracy is shaky. Hidden Power Fighting also smacks Munchlax much harder than Psychic would, as it deals 42.42% - 54.55% on standard Munchlax. The final slot is U-turn, and can used with both Choice Specs and Choice Scarf, as it allows Natu to escape from a possible Stunky trap.</p> <p>Natu pairs well with Substitute Diglett, as Natu can use U-turn on a predicted switch to Stunky or Munchlax and buy a free switch to Diglett, who can then use Earthquake to take them out. Substitute ensures Diglett won't die from Stunky's Sucker Punch. Natu also appreciates Stealth Rock support because it has a slim chance of OHKOing Bronzor with Heat Wave otherwise.</p>"

      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Natu's unique typing and access to dual screens allow it to become a valuable addition on any team that requires dual screens support. Despite its mediocre defensive stats, Natu boasts impressive resistances to Grass- and Fighting-type attacks, along with an immunity to Ground-type moves. This gives Natu an ample number of opportunities to set up dual screens on many Choiced Pokemon, with a particular emphasis on Fighting-types, in the metagame. Wish and U-turn make an excellent combo, as it allows Natu to Wish-pass with ease. Roost is optional if you prefer to heal yourself instantly.</p> <p>The basic idea of the set is to set up dual screens on a predicted switch-out by the likes of Mankey or Machop. After that, Natu can use U-turn to safely bring in a set-up Pokemon that appreciates dual screens support such as Dratini, Buizel, and Krabby. Natu also has Wish in its arsenal, and is one of the few Pokemon who can use Wish in conjunction with U-turn. With dual screens, Wish and U-turn, the next switch-in is almost bound to get at least a single boost in. If you're looking to focus on Wish alone, then Psychic could go over Light Screen or Reflect so Natu has a chance against Taunt users. Roost could go over Wish in order to heal off Natu's nasty weakness to Stealth Rock in one turn. Roost generally keeps Natu's health in mint condition and ensures Natu can set up dual screens once again in later stages of the match.</p> <p>Set-up Pokemon are the best offensive partners for Natu, as they can easily take advantage of eight turn dual screens on the field. Dratini is a prime example of a Pokemon who excels with dual screens support, as it can wreak havoc after getting two Dragon Dance boosts. Krabby gets a special mention as well because it can set up both Agility and Swords Dance with its already high Defense stat, in conjunction with Reflect and Light Screen support. Basically, any set-up Pokemon can fit in with this particular set because most set-up users benefit from dual screens support.</p>"

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>A Choice Band or a Life Orb helps Natu inflict damage from the physical side. While Natu's Attack stat isn't exactly superb, it does have a couple of physical moves to catch its typical counters off guard. For example, Stunky would suffer a 2HKO from Drill Peck while Munchlax will always fall under a 2HKO from Zen Headbutt. It's bittersweet that Natu doesn't even OHKO the two, but it still makes an excellent Stunky and Munchlax lure. U-turn allows it to scout the opponent.</p> <p>Zen Headbutt is the STAB of choice here, which can 2HKO Munchlax. The additional 20% flinch can come in handy at certain times. Sucker Punch is a nifty move to catch Gastly off guard. The third slot is a tough choice between Drill Peck and Pluck. Drill Peck is preferred on the Choice Band set if Natu is looking to grab the 2HKO on Stunky. However, Pluck is the better alternative with Life Orb. Pluck's special side effect allows it to steal the opponent's Berry. Natu could grab a possible Speed boost from Salac Berry, or restore some health with Oran Berry in the process. The final slot is for U-turn which helps Natu scout incoming switches. If you decide to run Life Orb over Choice Band, Heat Wave is the desirable choice over U-turn so Natu actually stands a chance against Bronzor. However, Natu would need a Naughty nature over Adamant in that case.</p> <p>Since Natu will lure in Munchlax and Stunky for the most part, Choice Scarf Gastly can take advantage of their removal from the match. Elekid makes a great partner as well due to its ability to sweep late game. Furthermore, Elekid can take advantage of Natu's ability to possibly steal Oran Berries, which makes Elekid's sweep significantly easier.</p> <p>Bronzor will always trouble this particular set even with Heat Wave, as Bronzor will eventually bypass Natu's mediocre defenses with Flash Cannon. Natu can't afford to waste its time trying to take down Bronzor with Heat Wave's unreliable accuracy, while Bronzor sets up. As such, Magby or Ponyta should be around to scare it off with their Fire-type moves. A defensive Gligar doesn't mind coming in on this set as well, and it can use a free turn to set up Stealth Rock or take Natu down with Stone Edge. Pair Natu with Wynaut in order to bring down Gligar with Counter or bring a Bronzor of your own to check Gligar.</p>"

It could be called the worst Electric-type in Little Cup and few people would raise an eyebrow. The Screening Sheep can be effective, but there are still better dual screeners, such as Bronzor and Magnemite. Unless you really like Mareep, want to have a bunch of fun playing Pokemon, or have a theme going, use something else.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Mareep has very few other options at its disposal. Heal Bell can be used so Mareep can act as a cleric, but has trouble finding a moveslot. Cotton Spore can be used to lower Speed two stages, but Thunder Wave is generally better, since the Speed drop is permanent and has the chance to incapacitate the foe. Offensively, Mareep could use Rain Dance and Thunder, and it is a fairly decent option for setting up rain. Lastly, Mareep can surprise Chinchou and Magnemite with Hidden Power Ground, and you get decent coverage with Power Gem. Substitute is always useful for getting a free turn. Mareep does hit 14 Speed, but it goes down fairly quickly without EVs in HP and Defense.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>The Screening Sheep set is extremely easy to counter. Anything part Ground destroys it, unless it has Hidden Power Grass or Ice. Diglett, Gible, Gligar and Barboach are just a few examples of Pokemon who stop this thing. However, Mareep typically has the Ground-type immune partner in the wings, so be careful about using Earthquake. If Mareep is running Hidden Power Grass, Magnemite can stop it. Taunt also shuts it down completely, so Taunt Voltorb or Gligar do well against it. The Choice Specs set is beaten by prediction, like most Choice sets. If it uses Discharge, switch in Gligar, Gible, or any other Ground-type. Munchlax can easily switch in on Hidden Power Ice and hit back with super effective Earthquake. Gible, Diglett, and Aron can switch in on Power Gem and hit back with Earthquake as well. Aron can also switch in on Signal Beam. Also, Magnemite resists all four of those moves, and Chinchou can switch in on Discharge and Hidden Power Ice.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mareep isn't the bulkiest thing alive, but it can take a hit or two. Using this set isn't hard, and can be pretty helpful to any team. All you do is switch in, set up Reflect and Light Screen, and switch to a setup sweeper. However, Mareep does have an extra trick up its...wool. Mareep can use Thunder Wave to stop sweepers in their tracks as long as they aren't named Glameow or have Ground-typing. This also helps compensate for Mareep's bad Speed. The problem is this set is countered by Ground-types, unless you are running Hidden Power Grass or Ice. That means Mareep is going to be luring in Ground-types like ants to honey, which hampers its ability to spread paralysis. Hidden Power Grass is great since it keeps Mareep from being walled by Ground-types and Chinchou. With Reflect and Hidden Power Ice, Mareep can lure in Gligar and take it out. Hidden Power Ice also gets excellent coverage with Discharge. Thunderbolt is the Mareep's main attacking option, although Mareep won't being doing much damage with its 13 Special Attack. Discharge works well with Hidden Power Grass due to the higher chance of paralyzing the opponent.</p> <p>Oran Berry is the item of choice. It gives Mareep much more survivability, especially with the screens up. However, Light Clay is an option if you want the screens to last much longer; which can help with some sweepers that need two or three boosts to sweep effectively. Both Bold and Calm nature are effective, and can be changed to fit your needs. If you fear Pokemon like Dratini and other physical sweepers, use Bold. If Mantyke and other special attackers give you the chills, then run Calm. The EVs are pretty straight forward. Max HP gives Mareep a decent 25 HP, the same HP stat as Bronzor. The EVs in the defenses mean Mareep will have 14 Defense and 12 Special Defense with Bold nature, or 13 in each stat with a Calm nature.</p> <p>Mareep has only one weakness: Ground. This means that Flying-types or Levitators are great teammates for Mareep. Setup sweepers are the best, since they can benefit the most from Reflect and Light Screen. Gligar, Drifloon, Mantyke, and Gastly are all great examples of Pokemon who can take advantage of Mareep's weakness. Rapid Spinners are also great teammates with Mareep, since it will be switching in a lot to set up screens. Squirtle is a great option, since Mareep can easily switch in on Electric-type attacks being used to take out the tiny turtle.</p>"

If Protect is used, Leftovers becomes a viable option, as in two turns, Hoppip will usually heal about 6 HP. U-turn can be an alternative on the Lead set to scout the opponent's team without having to sacrifice Hoppip, but Memento is usually the better option. Reflect can be used on the Support and Sunny Day sets to provide a Defense boost for Hoppip and its teammates.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Hoppip outspeeds almost every Pokemon in sunlight, and can stall against most of them. As such, Pokemon that can remove sunlight are great counters. Snover and Hippopotas can easily check it by changing the weather just by switching in, making Hoppip much less of a threat. The change in weather also means Hoppip's teammates cannot benefit from the sunlight either. Pokemon that have access to Ice Shard such as Snover, Swinub and Phanpy do great against Hoppip, knocking it out unless it has a Substitute up.

At this point, the opponent is most likely going to switch out again, so you have a choice of using either Leech Seed, to gain some health back, or using U-turn, to scout the switch-in and procure some offensive momentum.

This lets Hoppip stay useful mid-game, if it survives, after having put another Pokemon to sleep. Protect allows Hoppip to preserve its Focus Sash from the common Fake Out leads of Little Cup.</p> <p>Hoppip's goal is to incapacitate the opponent in numerous ways to help its teammates set up. Setup sweepers and Pokemon with U-turn make good teammates. Setup sweepers can generally set up without danger, while U-turn allows you to scout the opponent's switch-in, giving you the momentum to more easily switch Hoppip in. Substitute Houndour makes a great teammate, having good synergy, and being able to set up Substitute before firing off powerful STAB attacks. Swords Dance Gligar is quite bulky already, and with the help from Memento, it can set up a Swords Dance even more easily, allowing it to destroy many teams with its power. Agility Mantyke is also a good teammate, as it greatly benefits from Memento to help it set up and proceed to do tons of damage to the opponent.</p>"

Counter is also slightly viable, but you need to predict extremely well so that the opponent doesn't set up right in front of you. Curse is also a bad option since Wooper is so frail that by the time it sets up even one Curse, it will be KOed on the second turn.

Generally the most successful strategy is to switch Pineco into a resisted attack, such as a Choice-locked Earthquake, and spin away the opponent's entry hazards or set up its own. The moves on this set are quite simple. Spikes is the primary choice for entry hazards, because fewer Pokemon have access to it, but Stealth Rock can also be used if it benefits your team more. Rapid Spin is a valuable weapon in Pineco's arsenal, allowing your Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock, such as Mantyke and Houndour, to switch in without losing one-quarter (or more) of their health. Bug Bite eats Oran Berries commonly seen on defensive Pokemon, such as Munchlax and Bronzor, which allows Pineco to restore its HP and continue its job. The last moveslot is a matter of personal preference. Payback is the recommended attack in order to prevent Gastly and other Ghost-types from endlessly walling Pineco. Protect can be used to scout your opponent's attacks--namely Trick and Choiced attacks--and potentially rack up another turn of sandstorm or hail damage. Oran Berry is the recommended item for this moveset to increase Pineco's longevity.

Instead, it attempts to passively weaken the opponent with residual damage from Spikes, Stealth Rock, or sandstorm/hail damage in conjunction with Protect. Toxic Spikes can be used with Protect on this set, which allows it to stall and rack up residual poison damage. This puts an effective timer on sweepers that use set-up moves, such as Totodile and Chinchou.</p> <p>Good teammates for this set include Pokemon that have high Speed and enjoy having entry hazards weakening the opponent. For example, Choice Scarf sweepers such as Machop, Mankey, and Wailmer all enjoy having weakened opponents.

Oran Berry is essential to increase Pineco's staying power, so it can set up as many entry hazards as possible. The EVs, in conjunction with an Impish nature, maximize Pineco's physical bulk, while the extra point in Attack increases the power of Pineco's Explosion.</p> <p>Good teammates for this set are Pokemon that enjoy having weakened opponents, due to entry hazards turning 3HKOs into 2HKOs and 2HKOs into OHKOs.

  "Slugma": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Slugma comes off as an extremely poor Pokemon. Its only above-average stat is its base 70 Special Attack, and a horrid 20 Speed means it won't be outspeeding many Pokemon. Due to this, it is easy to see why many people think Slugma follows in its older sibling Magcargo's footsteps.</p> <p>However, if you look deeper, Slugma is actually one of the most underrated Pokemon in all of Little Cup, and in the right hands it can be devastating. It is one of the two Pokemon that possess both screens and Memento, making it a very potent screener. It also has access to two different recovery moves and the ability to spread status with Yawn and Will-O-Wisp. In terms of offense, Slugma's low Speed makes it great in Trick Room, with good coverage and the ability to blow up when done. While Fire-typing and average stats hold it back defensively, the lava slug makes up for this with the ability to support the team uniquely. When used under the right circumstances, Slugma can be a useful addition to most teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>If you are using Slugma as a lead, Protect can be used to stop Fake Out and scout. Pain Split is an option as a healing move over Recover, but it is only superior when facing an opponent with a high HP stat. Curse and Stockpile can be used as ways to bolster Slugma's defenses; however, it is tough to find a moveslot for them. Also, Slugma has trouble taking advantage of the Attack boost from Curse, since it lacks physical STAB. Overheat is an option, but Slugma will despise the Special Attack drop. Ancient Power has great coverage with Earth Power, but its low Base Power makes it unfavorable.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Tentacool is the single best counter to the Suicide Screener and Status Support sets. Not only does Tentacool have STAB Surf to severely damage Slugma, but it also has Clear Body, which prevents Memento from harming it. Tentacool also has a large Special Defense stat, which helps it sponge up Flamethrower and Lava Plume. Krabby and Gligar's Hyper Cutter and super effective STAB make them decent counters to Slugma, but both of them must watch out for Will-O-Wisp and Lava Plume. It should also be noted that anything with Taunt shuts down Slugma completely, aside from rare ones with Lava Plume or Self-Destruct.</p> <p>Munchlax outspeeds the Trick Room Sweeper in Trick Room and can OHKO Slugma with Earthquake. Its amazing Special Defense and HP allows it to come in on any attack aside from Self-Destruct easily. Trapinch can also outspeed Slugma in Trick Room, use Arena Trap to trap it, and finish it with Earthquake. Slugma also has trouble with Aqua Jet users, such as Totodile and Carvanha, due to its lack of priority.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dual Screen Memento": {
        "description": "<p>Slugma is a great example of a Pokemon with a movepool that doesn't match its typing. It has access to some of the best supportive options, but being a pure Fire-type with bad stats screws it up. However, with this set, Slugma can be a huge asset to any sweeper by making its setup easier. It can be hard to pull off, but if you do, it will be worth it.</p> <p>Setting up Light Screen and Reflect should be your first priority, since it benefits the whole team while also making up for Slugma's rather humble defenses. Memento is the move that makes this set so deadly, as it lowers both the foe's Attack and Special Attack two stages. That means with screens up, the opponent's attacks are only doing one-fourth of the damage they would normally be doing. When you use Memento, the user automatically faints, which is why it is always recommended that you set up screens before you use Memento. Self-Destruct is also an option if you want to bring down an opponent with Slugma. While most of the time Memento is the superior choice, it is still a fine option. Be aware that Self-Destruct is illegal with Recover and Memento, though. Slugma's last move slot is completely up to personal choice. Recover gives Slugma a viable way of healing and can be used if you want to keep Slugma alive for late assistance. Yawn is a great way to force switches, and it can also put the foe to sleep. Either way, it gives you time to set up screens while the foe switches or is asleep. Flamethrower keeps Slugma from being completely shut down by Taunt and packs decent power when coming off a base 70 Special Attack, even with no investment.</p> <p>The EVs and nature are designed for Slugma to get the most out of its mediocre defenses. With the given spread, Slugma reaches 23 HP, 13 Defense, and 13 Special Defense with a Careful nature, though screens make these defenses seem a lot better than they actually are. A Calm nature should be used if you are running Flamethrower. The choice between Light Clay and Oran Berry is a tough choice indeed. Light Clay allows screens to last eight turns, and this is great since Slugma probably won't be around to set them up again. Oran Berry provides a higher guarantee that you will be able to get your screens up and Memento, since Slugma can't take many hits.</p> <p>The good news is that Slugma doesn't need much support from its teammates, since it will be doing the supporting and typically won't be around for long. Slugma is weak to Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type moves, so setup sweepers that resist those types are its best teammates. Mantyke and Poliwag can easily switch in on Water moves thanks to Water Absorb and can then set up Agility and Belly Drum, respectively. Croagunk can switch in safely thanks to Dry Skin and use Nasty Plot. Krabby and Totodile are also great options, since they resist Water-type moves and absolutely adore screen support. Gligar, Drifloon, and the previously mentioned Mantyke can switch in on Ground-type moves without fear, since they are completely immune. Swords Dance Snover can switch in on Ground and Water moves without fear and threaten the users with Ice Shard and Wood Hammer. Barboach and Aron can shrug off Rock-type attacks with ease and set up Dragon Dance and Rock Polish, respectively. Larvitar can also switch in and set up either Dragon Dance or Rock Polish.</p> <p>While the aforementioned Pokemon are the best partners for Slugma, almost any setup sweeper works well. Dratini and Bagon greatly appreciate Slugma's support since it often allows them to get more than one Dragon Dance in. The rare, but extremely deadly Nasty Plot Houndour loves Memento support, as it allows it to set up safely, which is usually hard for it. Cacnea and Seedot can use Swords Dance, Nasty Plot, or Substitute safely behind screens. Rock Polish or Swords Dance Cranidos typically has trouble setting up, but not with Slugma's Memento support. While Belly Drum Magby may seem like a gimmick, it can be a huge threat with assistance from Slugma. The list can go on and on, but these are some of the best examples.</p> <p>If you are saving Slugma for mid- or late-game, Rapid Spin support can help. Squirtle is great option as a spinner, since it resists Water. Baltoy is another great spinner, since it can easily switch in on two of Slugma's weaknesses, and it resists Stealth Rock. Pineco can use Rapid Spin as well and lures Fire-type moves, thus providing Slugma with an easy switch-in. Lastly, Sandshrew deserves some mention, since it resists Rock, and is weak to Grass. STAB Grass-type moves are some of the best moves for Slugma to switch in on since most Grass-types will switch out of it, allowing the blazing slug to set up Reflect or Light Screen. Slugma has very low Speed, which means this set can function great in Trick Room. If you are using this set in Trick Room, be sure to change the nature to Sassy and give it 0 IVs in Speed to make it as slow as possible.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Slugma is really slow, making it a perfect candidate for Trick Room. With a meaty base 70 Special Attack, Slugma can certainly put a dent in most foes. While Slugma is nowhere near the power levels of Cubone and Azurill in Trick Room, it is still a strong option. Fire Blast is Slugma's main attacking move, since STAB Fire Blast coming off of base 70 Special Attack is going to be hitting anything that doesn't resist it hard. Flamethrower is a decent replacement, thanks to higher accuracy. Since Trick Room puts you on a timer, a miss from Fire Blast can be devastating. Hidden Power Electric hits Water-types for super effective damage, including the ever-so-common Mantyke. Slugma has access to Earth Power, which not only hits Chinchou for super effective, but Rock- and Fire-types as well. Self-Destruct is a powerful suicide move, which can be used when Trick Room is about to end as a safe switch to a Pokemon that can set up Trick Room, or if Slugma is low on health. It also does a ton of damage to Munchlax, who would otherwise wall this set.</p> <p>You are going to want to make Slugma as slow as possible, so a Quiet nature is a must. The IVs may seem odd, but 30 Special Attack IVs and 3 Speed IVs allow Slugma to be as slow as possible while achieving 70 Base Power Hidden Power Electric. With nature and IVs combined, Slugma reaches a sluggish 6 Speed. The 36 EVs in Attack, Defense and Special Defense give Slugma one extra point in each stat. Life Orb is the definite item to use, since it provides a boost in power as well as the ability to switch between moves, which is extremely important in Trick Room.</p> <p>Having someone to set up Trick Room is needed, because Slugma has little hope of sweeping without it. Slowpoke is a great option since Slugma can switch in on Grass-type moves aimed at Slowpoke. Furthermore, Slowpoke resists Water and can bring down Rock- and Ground-types with Aqua Tail. Baltoy is an even better option. Even though Baltoy is also weak to Water, it resists Rock and is immune to Ground. Most importantly, it can use Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock, which plagues Slugma. Bronzor can also switch in on Rock- and Ground-type attacks and set up Trick Room. Smoochum can also work well, since Slugma can shrug off Fire-type moves.</p> <p>Aside from Trick Room, Slugma benefits from the same things most sweepers do. Stealth Rock is always appreciated. Bronzor and Baltoy are good options for setting it up since they can set up Trick Room too. Bronzor can also set up screens to support Slugma. Turtwig is another good option since it can set up screens, and Slugma can switch in on the Fire- and Ice-type moves directed at Turtwig with ease. Turtwig is also slow enough to take advantage of Trick Room. Ledyba is also a fine screener to support Slugma, since it can use Encore.</p> <p>Even though this set can hit Dragon-types for neutral damage with Earth Power, they still cause Slugma trouble. Due to this, most Steel-types are a great partner for Slugma. Bronzor gets mentioned again, since it is immune to Ground and resists Rock. Aron also deserves attention, since it can switch into Outrage thanks to its high Defense. Magnemite can use Hidden Power Ice to subdue the dragons, especially Gible. It can also hit Water-types hard with STAB Thunderbolt. Shieldon can use Ice Beam to take down Dragon-types, and set up Stealth Rock. Most importantly, Shieldon is slow, meaning it can take full advantage of Trick Room.</p>"

  "Swinub": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Although Swinub is an uncommon sight in Little Cup, it can pack a serious punch in this fast-paced metagame. Its offensive stats are decent enough; its Speed allows it to outpace key threats while dishing out good damage thanks to its good Attack. Swinub is usually seen on hail teams because of its ability, Snow Cloak, which boosts its evasion in hail. The only problem Pokemon that Swinub usually runs into is Bronzor, which resists both of Swinub's STAB attacks. Even though Swinub is a decent Pokemon all around, its defenses are lacking and it does not resist any priority attacks. Swinub also doesn't have a reliable way of boosting its own stats outside of the risky Curse. Although many Pokemon can easily outspeed and bash Swinub, it can still succeed in this metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Swinub has quite a small, yet unique pool of other options that can be utilized to your advantage. As another set, you could opt to use an Endeavor set, with Endure, Ice Shard, and Earthquake, holding a Salac Berry. If needed, Rock Slide could be used instead of Superpower or Earthquake to KO those pesky Bug-types more easily than your Ice-type STAB attacks; unfortunately, Swinub doesn't get Stone Edge. Also, Swinub could use mixed set, as with Hidden Power Fire and a Life Orb, Swinub deals 40% - 56% damage to Bronzor and OHKOes Snover. This isn't recommended because it has little use outside of those Pokemon, and Superpower is just good enough to deal with both Pokemon anyway. You could opt to use Curse, as Swinub's Ice Shard can get rid of Curse's side effect, but Swinub will still be forced out easily. Dual screens sounds like a good idea, but Swinub's defensive stats just aren't good enough for it to be a substantial benefit.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Due to Swinub's mediocre defenses, and lack of resistances, it has a plethora of counters. One hit from any powerful super effective attack will always result in an OHKO on Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mankey and Machop can easily smash Swinub with their STAB attacks, though they must avoid switching in on Earthquake. Physical walls like Bronzor can take hits from Swinub with ease and deal damage back. Choice Scarf Houndour can OHKO Swinub with any Fire-type attack, but cannot switch in on Superpower or Earthquake. Almost any faster sweeper that isn't weak against Ice Shard, such as Staryu, Ponyta, and Choice Scarf Magnemite, can beat Swinub as long as they switch in on the right move. Because of Mantyke's Speed and Water-type STAB, it is another great counter to Swinub. Surskit receives a special mention because of its resistances to both of Swinub's STABs and access to Hydro Pump. Priority users, including Squirtle, Carvanha, and Croagunk, can all destroy Swinub once it has been weakened enough via residual damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>With a movepool just right for leading, Swinub can fend off most leads while setting up Stealth Rock. Protect prevents Fake Out leads such as Meowth and Aipom from breaking Swinub's Focus Sash. Ice Shard allows Swinub to pick off several Pokemon, most notably leads that have activated their Focus Sash. Stealth Rock should be set up as soon as possible so that it can take effect right off the bat. Earthquake is Swinub's primary STAB attack, which can deal immerse damage to most leads. Since the combination of Earthquake and Ice Shard KOes Meowth but not Aipom, Superpower can be used in Earthquake's place for the KO on Aipom; Superpower is also able to dent Bronzor. Focus Sash guarantees that you will set up Stealth Rock, as well as granting another turn to use Ice Shard. The given EVs maximize Swinub's Attack and Speed stats, while increasing Swinub's bulk.</p> <p>There are several leads that can easily take down Swinub, such as Machop and Drifloon. Machop can smack Swinub with a super effective Dynamic Punch, which also causes Swinub to only have a 50% chance of moving, due to the confusion effect. Drifloon can survive Ice Shard while denting Swinub back with Shadow Ball; it can then finish Swinub off with Sucker Punch, which out-prioritizes Ice Shard. Pokemon like Duskull, Slowpoke, and Munchlax can easily eliminate those leads. Duskull is immune to Fighting and can burn Machop with Will-O-Wisp, Slowpoke has a Fighting-type resistance and can OHKO Machop with Zen Headbutt, and Munchlax has great special bulk to take on Drifloon with and Pursuit to remove the balloon.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Remoraid is a tremendous offensive threat thanks to its phenomenal movepool and good offensive stats. It also has pretty decent Speed, allowing it to become a deadly Choice Scarf user. Although Remoraid suffers from paper-thin defenses and lacks a priority move, its overall offensive prowess makes up for it. All in all, Remoraid could fit on teams that require great offensive pressure on the opponent.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Remoraid's offensive movepool is incredibly broad, so it has many options. Flamethrower is a good option over any set that is using Fire Blast to provide more accuracy. Gunk Shot could provide a way to hit Grass-types, as it packs 120 Base Power, but is very inaccurate. Psychic is another option to OHKO Croagunk. Charge Beam can also work in order to boost Remoraid's Special Attack.</p> <p>Support-wise, Remoraid has Thunder Wave in its arsenal to cripple faster threats on the switch. This way, Remoraid can hold Life Orb instead of Choice Scarf to provide more flexibility. Lock On is also an interesting option in conjunction with Hustle to provide 100% accuracy on Remoraid's next hit.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>There really aren't any specific counters to Remoraid, but there are several checks to it. First and foremost, Water Absorbers, such as Paras, Mantyke, and Croagunk, can slow it down. Priority users, such as Dratini and Meowth, can OHKO Remoraid most of the time with Stealth Rock down. For the Special Scarf set, Munchlax can check it for the most part if it hasn't taken too much damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Remoraid is quite lucky because it's one of the few Pokemon who learn Water Spout—the strongest Water-type move in Little Cup at full health bar. Choice Scarf Remoraid Speed ties with other prominent Choice Scarf users who linger at the 25 Speed mark, such as Houndour and Mankey. Remoraid is often compared to its fellow Water Spout user Wailmer, who has more HP. However, Wailmer does not reach 25 Speed with a Choice Scarf boost, making Remoraid a great alternative if you want that extra Speed. In the remaining slots, Surf serves as a reliable STAB attack, Ice Beam strikes Grass-types, and Hidden Power provides coverage. Hidden Power Ground hits Chinchou and Croagunk, while Hidden Power Grass hits opposing Water-types.</p> <p>Water Spout is Remoraid's primary attack, as it hurts everything in Little Cup that isn't resistant or immune to it; when Remoraid is at full health, it has a whopping 150 Base Power. However, the Base Power of Water Spout depends on the percentage of Remoraid's HP remaining. Any form of damage, such as Stealth Rock, will weaken the power of Water Spout. As such, it's best to use Remoraid in the lead slot or bring it out early to keep its HP in mint condition.</p> <p>Surf acts as an emergency STAB attack in case Remoraid fails to keep its HP intact. Ice Beam hits Grass-types, such as Paras, for super effective damage and Croagunk, who would otherwise wall this set, for neutral damage. The choice for the final slot depends on what your team needs Remoraid to hit. Hidden Power Ground smashes Croagunk and Chinchou, who may attempt to come in on your STAB attack. On the other hand, Hidden Power Grass hits Wooper and opposing bulky Water-types for super effective damage.</p> <p>Remoraid, even if it has taken Stealth Rock damage, can 2HKO Munchlax with Stealth Rock down, dealing a maximum of 54.55% with Water Spout. As such, Gastly makes an excellent partner; Remoraid can potentially lure in and KO Munchlax, giving Gastly more freedom to sweep late-game. Elekid also functions as a great late-game cleaner once your opponent's team is significantly weakened. Defensively, a two-man core of Gligar and Munchlax, makes a good addition alongside Remoraid. Croagunk and Mantyke are common Pokemon immune to Water-type attacks; Gligar can check Croagunk to a good degree, while Munchlax can 2HKO Mantyke with Returns. Rain Dance teams work well with Remoraid, as Rain Dance negates possible hail and sandstorm damage, which strip Remoraid of its precious HP. Rain Dance also boosts Water Spout's damage output, making Remoraid even more destructive.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Remoraid has a great physical movepool, a respectable Attack stat, and the ability Hustle, which boosts its Attack by 50%. Take note that Hustle's side effect reduces Remoraid's accuracy by 20%, which means that normally 100% accurate moves are now 80% accurate. With Choice Band and Hustle, and Remoraid's Attack climbs to an outstanding 36, which is equivalent to Choice Band Cranidos's. With the right support, Remoraid makes an excellent physical sweeper, despite its lack of priority moves. Waterfall hits any Pokemon who doesn't resist it incredibly hard anything, Seed Bomb hits opposing Water-types, Return smacks Water Absorbers for neutral damage, and Water Spout bluffs a specially-based set.</p> <p>A boosted Waterfall is incredibly hard to switch into, because something is bound to lose a sizable chunk of its HP if your opponent is not packing a Water Absorber. Seed Bomb complements Waterfall, as it hits Water-types for super effective damage. Return rounds off the coverage, smashing Croagunk and Paras trying to gain HP with Dry Skin. The last slot depends on what item Remoraid is running. Water Spout works well with Choice Band or Choice Scarf, as it helps bluff a specially-based set. This attracts special walls like Munchlax the next time around, allowing Remoraid to OHKO them with Waterfall. If Remoraid is running Life Orb, Substitute is the preferred choice in order to block priority hits that would otherwise spell doom for Remoraid, due to its paper-thin defenses.</p> <p>There are plenty of options to choose from for the item slot, depending on what your team needs. Choice Band provides instant power to hurt almost anything on the switch. Choice Scarf boosts Remoraid's Speed, while still letting it hit hard with 24 Attack, thanks to Hustle. Lastly, Life Orb adds more freedom, but doesn't let Remoraid hit as hard as it would with Choice Band.</p> <p>Remoraid doesn't really have any sure-fire counters; your best bet is to try to eliminate things that hinder its sweep, such as priority users and Water Absorb Pokemon. Priority moves plague the Little Cup metagame, so it's generally hard to eliminate every priority user. Meowth, Croagunk, and Dratini, are common priority users; as such, defensive Gligar will work great alongside Remoraid to check these threats. In addition to this, Gligar also has Stealth Rock to help Remoraid sweep. Water Absorbers, like Mantyke, Croagunk, and Paras, will usually slow down Remoraid's sweep for the most part, because they prevent it from using its primary STAB move. As with the first set, Munchlax and Gligar can wall these Pokemon nicely, so be sure to pack them.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Remoraid can run a mixed set effectively because of its ability, Hustle. With the suggested EV spread, Remoraid reaches 21 Attack, 16 Special Attack, and 24 Speed - enough to deal a respectable amount of damage on both ends. This set has excellent coverage, thanks to Water Spout, Fire Blast and Seed Bomb, and can be an effective sweeper late-game. Waterfall is the crux of the set, as it smashes unprepared Munchlax, and other special walls that may be lured in by Remoraid's special attacks.</p> <p>Waterfall is Remoraid's main physical STAB move, while Water Spout is Remoraid's main special STAB move. Water Spout is excellent early in the game, when Remoraid's HP is in mint condition. The final two move slots provide great coverage along with its STAB moves. Seed Bomb allows Remoraid to hit Water-types for super effective damage, while Fire Blast hits Grass-types and Croagunk who attempt to absorb Remoraid's Water-type moves. However, if Dragon-types, such as Dratini, are more important, Ice Beam is another option.</p> <p>Bringing a defensive Gligar alongside Remoraid can help check many priority moves directed at Remoraid's poor Defense stat. Gligar can provide Stealth Rock as well, helping Remoraid sweep more efficiently. Munchlax can deal with a portion of the Water Absorbers, who can switch in freely on Remoraid's main moves. Offensively, Elekid works great as a late-game sweeper once the opponent's team has taken a great deal of damage.</p>"

The main advantages that Phanpy possesses are access to priority Ice Shard, Head Smash, and higher base HP. Also, unlike Gligar, Phanpy doesn't have a 4x weakness to Ice-type attacks. However, one problem with Phanpy is that it does not have a decent Speed stat, unlike Gligar, which makes Phanpy's battle time lower a chunk compared to Gligar's. Taking into account its advantages, Phanpy has an excellent role to play in this metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Phanpy has little else going for it in terms of other usable moves. Rock Slide may be used instead of Head Smash for its better accuracy and lack of recoil damage, but it only has half the Base Power. Knock Off may be used on the Lead set, but in the fast-paced metagame of Little Cup, you're much better off attacking. In terms of alternative sets, Phanpy can run an effective Choice Band set, though low Speed and the fact that so much of Little Cup is immune to Earthquake means that the risk outweighs the reward. Phanpy can also run a Choice Scarf set, as it reaches 14 Speed unboosted, which increases to 21 with a Choice Scarf, allowing Phanpy to outspeed every Pokemon without a boost; however, even though Phanpy does get Head Smash, it has a hard time differentiating from Sandshrew, who can run a similar set but with a greater Attack stat. Phanpy can run an Endeavor set, but it is not recommended because any Pokemon with a Choice Scarf or a priority move can easily take down Endeavor Phanpy.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Ghost-types such as Gastly and Drifloon can blast Phanpy with strong STAB Shadow Balls, although they must watch out for Head Smash. Bronzor takes little damage from Phanpy and can set up Stealth Rock or attack with Flash Cannon or Psychic. Paras can switch in on any attack but Head Smash and then threaten to Spore it or punish it with Seed Bomb. Almost any bulky Water-type can come in on Phanpy and scare it off. Mantyke is especially good, as it resists Superpower, is immune to Earthquake, and takes little damage from Ice Shard, although it must beware of switching into Head Smash.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>With its combination of good physical bulk and access to Stealth Rock, Phanpy can become one of the best leads in Little Cup. Phanpy's bulk allows it to take hits from common leads, such as Meowth, Aipom, and Diglett, and 2HKO back with a mixture of Earthquake and Ice Shard. For example, Phanpy usually ends up on top against Voltorb, who only has a 2% chance of 2HKOing Phanpy with Hidden Power Ice, and only a slight chance of OHKOing with Explosion. Setting up Stealth Rock from the start helps by gradually weakening your opponent over time, which lets your sweepers clean up more easily. Earthquake is Phanpy's primary STAB attack, and can deal major damage to the foe. Head Smash hits Flying- and Ghost-types immune to Phanpy's STAB Earthquake hard, while Ice Shard helps pick off weakened opponents.</p> <p>This set can also be used as a tank later in the game in order to set up Stealth Rock and fire off vicious attacks. By preserving Phanpy as a mid- to late-game tank, you also gain a counter to the dangerous Choice Scarf Cranidos. Cranidos's attacks do poorly against Phanpy; Stone Edge is resisted, Ice Beam never 2HKOes through Oran Berry, and Earthquake only has a 50% chance of 3HKOing. In return, Phanpy can OHKO Cranidos with Earthquake, and Focus Sash variants are finished off with Ice Shard, securing Phanpy's place as a solid Cranidos counter.</p> <p>Phanpy has trouble dealing with Water-types and Snover. Mantyke pairs up nicely with Phanpy here, as it can take multiple hits from Water-types such as Wailmer and Omanyte thanks to its massive Special Defense and Water Absorb, and then threaten to OHKO back with Hidden Power Grass or set up an Agility. Additionally, Mantyke can handle Lead Houndour, who is troublesome for Phanpy. Snover can be eliminated by Croagunk, thanks to its STAB priority move in Vacuum Wave. Croagunk can also be used over Mantyke to take on all of the aforementioned threats. However, this leaves Phanpy without a sturdy specially defensive tank to fall back on. Phanpy is also useless against Bronzor, so Magnet Rise Magnemite gets a mention for being able to take Bronzor out reliably while providing resistances to Ice- and Grass-type attacks.</p>"

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>Phanpy can be a great Life Orb sweeper, as it reaches a decent 16 Attack stat and has wide coverage. Its primary attack is STAB Earthquake, which can put a huge dent in any Pokemon not resistant to it. Ice Shard is a great priority move that makes Phanpy an excellent revenge killer; for example, Ice Shard 2HKOes most Gligar sets. Head Smash is an ideal choice for the third moveslot, hitting Flying- and Bug-types super effectively, especially Paras who can otherwise survive all of Phanpy's other attacks and put Phanpy to sleep with Spore. Seed Bomb strikes Water-types such as Staryu, Clamperl, and Buizel harder than any other of Phanpy's moves, whereas Superpower can deal decent damage to Bronzor as well as OHKO Munchlax. However, not only are the Attack and Defense drops not appreciated, but Ghost-types are granted an opportunity to freely switch in.</p> <p>Although Life Orb Phanpy deals a chunk of damage even to Pokemon who resist Earthquake, it is still walled by quite a few Pokemon. Bronzor is the main counter to Life Orb Phanpy, but can be taken out by Magnet Rise Magnemite easily. Stunky is a fine check for Ghosts who are immune to Earthquake. Munchlax is a good defensive partner for Phanpy, as it can shrug off Ice-type attacks thanks to Thick Fat and can also take most special attacks, while also being able to hit Ghosts with Pursuit and Bronzor with Fire Punch.</p> <p>Like most other sweepers, Life Orb Phanpy greatly appreciates both Stealth Rock and dual screens in play. Stealth Rock makes Flying-types think twice before switching into an Earthquake, and also breaks all Focus Sashes on the opponent's team, making switching frail and fast revenge killers in harder. Dual screens are greatly appreciated on this set, as they increase Phanpy's staying power, which allows it to stay on the offensive for longer.</p> <p>When paired with certain Pokemon, Phanpy forms a solid defensive core. Mantyke covers Phanpy's weaknesses quite well, sporting an immunity to one of the most common offensive types, Water, while using its massive base 120 Special Defense to sponge neutral special Grass- and Ice-type hits. In return, Phanpy is unfazed by Electric-type moves and shrugs off even the strongest of Rock-type attacks. When also used with Magnemite, these three form a great defensive core with every type in the game being resisted by one member or more in the trio. If Magnemite does not appeal to you, specially defensive Bronzor is a great replacement, especially when used provide dual screen support as well as a handy resistance to Ice- and Grass-type attacks. Generally, any Pokemon with a reasonable amount of Special Defense and HP is a good teammate for Phanpy, like Munchlax and Lileep under a sandstorm.</p>"

Terrible base stats (aside from a good Special Attack and decent Speed) along with two near-useless abilities make her an oft-overlooked Pokemon.

If priority users and a few walls are taken down, Smoochum can easily sweep entire teams with Blizzard coming off a maximum of 19 Special Attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Aside from a Choice Scarf set, Smoochum has few options. It can attempt to run a Nasty Plot set with Salac Berry or Speed-passing, but it is easily killed by priority. Smoochum has a plethora of other special attacks; however, they have redundant coverage with her main moves. Smoochum can set up Trick Room and sweep effectively under it, though priority hurts it just like any other Smoochum set. Finally, Smoochum learns Fake Out and can attempt to lead with it, but has almost nothing to favor it over other Fake Out leads.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Smoochum, being the fragile Pokemon that it is, has many counters. Munchlax and Bronzor utterly laugh at any attempts from Smoochum to hurt them besides Trick. Houndour walls Smoochum outside of Hidden Power Ground, and can use Sucker Punch to pick Smoochum off; Stunky and Croagunk can do the same. All three of them also learn Pursuit, which will easily KO Smoochum if it decides to run. Weather changers like Hippopotas or Rain Dance Mantyke will make Blizzard unreliable and render Smoochum essentially useless.

  "Magby": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Magby is often overlooked because of Elekid, which has fantastic coverage and slightly higher Speed. However, Magby has many advantages over Elekid. Its 120 Base Power STAB attacks easily out-muscle Elekid's much weaker base 75 and 95 attacks. Magby also has Mach Punch, which is far better than Elekid's Quick Attack due to its typing and ability to hit Houndour, a Pokemon who can switch into its STAB for free.</p> <p>Magby has one huge weakness however: its weakness to Stealth Rock. This makes Magby unable to switch in and out as it pleases, and gives it only 3-4 switch-ins before it bites the dust. Because of this, Magby needs to be played to its strengths, hitting hard and fast, knocking out the opponent before it gets knocked out. With so many Pokemon falling to Magby's powerful attacks, Magby should be considered for almost any offensive team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>In theory, Magby should be able to pull off an effective Belly Drum set due to its Speed and power. Setting up with Magby is difficult, but not impossible with support from Pokemon such as Wynaut with Encore. However, Belly Drum Magby is actually able to be beaten by some very common Pokemon, even after a Salac Berry (without a Salac Berry, Magby is easily outsped by Choice Scarf users). Since Mach Punch is illegal with Belly Drum, Magby will have extreme difficulty with most priority users. For these reasons, Magby is better off using mixed Life Orb or Choice Scarf sets than an extremely situational Belly Drum set.</p> <p>The special-oriented wallbreaker set can also be used with Substitute and Focus Punch, which eases prediction and gives Magby an easier time with Pokemon such as Lickitung. However, sacrificing either Grass- or Electric-type coverage is definitely not good, so the listed sets are generally better. Iron Tail is an option for the Choice Band set, 2HKOing Rock-types, but its 75% accuracy leaves something to be desired, and Cross Chop is often a more effective move.</p> <p>Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast if you are an accuracy freak. However, Fire Blast guarantees many OHKOs, most notably a KO on Gligar. Similarly, Brick Break can be used over Cross Chop for the sake of accuracy. A special Choice set can also be used, but 16 Special Attack will only get you so far. However, if you like the \"hit-and-run\" style of play, a Modest Magby's Overheat will deal loads of damage to incoming switch-ins or whatever is on the battlefield. This is made even better by its 27 Speed after Choice Scarf and its ability to carry Cross Chop for Munchlax.</p> <p>Focus Sash is usable on any set without Flare Blitz as well, giving Magby a chance to usually get at least two attacks on your opponent, and since Magby has such top-notch offensive stats, two attacks is usually enough to KO the average Pokemon.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Magby is one of the hardest Pokemon to switch into due to its excellent type coverage and power. In fact, not one Pokemon can safely switch into Magby without the risk of getting OHKOed or 2HKOed, largely due to a lack of Dragon- and Flying-types to absorb Fighting- and Fire-type attacks like there are in OU and UU. Now Mantyke could switch into any of the aforementioned attacks, but that's where Thunder Punch comes in. The best (or only) way to deal with the Life Orb mixed attacker set is to predict, and send something in that can take a Mach Punch on top of the attack that it switched into. This leaves few options, but the most reliable options are likely Choice Scarf Cyndaquil or Chinchou. Cyndaquil is not hit super effectively by any of Magby's attacks, and can KO with Hidden Power Ground. Chinchou is similar, and it can easily KO with a STAB Surf. Gligar also does well, as it resists both of Magby's non-STAB attacks and is not KOed by Flare Blitz. Overheat has a 2% chance to KO it without Stealth Rock, and a 100% chance to KO it with Stealth Rock, so watch out for a Life Orb-boosted Overheat. It also has a 50% chance of winning the Speed tie with Magby, thus allowing it to come out of the matchup largely unscathed.</p> <p>The best method to rid yourself of Magby is revenge killing. As long as a Choice Scarf user isn't weak to Mach Punch, you can safely KO Magby with its weak defenses. Aqua Jet users such as Buizel or Squirtle can also quickly douse Magby for the revenge kill. Diglett gets a mention for its ability to trap and OHKO Magby with Earthquake, and it can switch into Thunder Punch unscathed due to its Ground typing.</p>",

      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Magby has all of the right tools to be a top-notch sweeper in the Little Cup metagame, and this set takes advantage of all of them. Flare Blitz coming off of 17 Attack is especially potent, especially when it's also boosted by Life Orb. With Houndour being around, Magby can take advantage of its priority move, Mach Punch, which easily KOes Houndour while avoiding Sucker Punch. Priority is a godsend in Little Cup, because 40 Base Power is usually enough to finish off any fast and frail foe after taking only minor damage. Magby is also gifted with Thunder Punch, a great tool to rid the battle of Water-types who may switch in, especially Pokemon such as Mantyke, Slowpoke, and Kabuto, who will usually be your opponent's first line of defense against Fire-type attacks. With these attacks, Magby can OHKO a majority of the metagame, while being able to 2HKO even the most sturdy walls such as Munchlax (the Leftovers variant), who is 2HKOed by Flare Blitz as long as Stealth Rock is on the field. Beware of Flare Blitz recoil when you use this set, as it can be deadly for Magby after even two uses.</p> <p>The last slot is pretty flexible, but Overheat is recommended for its sheer power. With a solid 13 Special Attack stat, a STAB Overheat is still strong enough to OHKO major threats such as Gligar, who could otherwise survive any of Magby's physical attacks, even Flare Blitz. Brick Break is an option to hit Munchlax for the guaranteed OHKO, but leaves Magby open to Gligar. Hidden Power Grass is an option to OHKO Pokemon such as Geodude, Rhyhorn, and Kabuto who would otherwise cause some trouble for this set. However, they are quite uncommon. Overheat is still preferred for that reason, not to mention its ability to get the KO on most of the previously mentioned Rock-types after they switch into a Flare Blitz. Overheat also makes for a safe opening attack due to Flare Blitz recoil.</p> <p>This Magby set breaks down the opponent's team and finishes off weaker foes, giving a Pokemon holding the ever-common Choice Scarf a chance to sweep easily late game. Choice Scarf Bagon and Cranidos work very well with Magby offensively, as they have very little trouble with Oran Berry variants of Munchlax, but have a bit of trouble with Bronzor and faster Choice Scarf users, which Magby is built to take care of.</p> <p>While Magby is eventually going to be forced out, defensive support isn't needed as much because Magby can switch its attacks. In addition, it will only be able to switch in a couple times due to Flare Blitz recoil, Life Orb recoil, and Stealth Rock all chipping off Magby's HP. Speaking of Stealth Rock, this Magby set especially appreciates a fast lead who can stop Stealth Rock from being set up at all costs. Meowth, Voltorb, and any hard-hitting Choice Scarf lead can make sure Stealth Rock stays off the field, at least until Magby can get a couple switch-ins and do some damage. Staryu is also a good lead to use with Magby, as it also gets Rapid Spin.</p>"

      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>While this set looks similar to the above set, its playstyle is quite different. This set is purely made for beating the opponent's bulky Pokemon down with hard-hitting attacks. Fire Blast is Magby's main attack, giving Bronzor and any Pokemon who doesn't resist Fire-type attacks a one way ticket back to its Pokeball. Here is where the two sets differ; this set can use Cross Chop, Thunder Punch, and Hidden Power Grass in one move set, giving Magby potentially the best super effective coverage possible in Little Cup. Cross Chop is Magby's main tool for getting rid of Munchlax, who is KOed after switching into any other attack, and is OHKOed most of the time with just Stealth Rock in play. Hidden Power Grass takes care of Pokemon such as Geodude and Kabuto, who have the Defense needed to survive a Cross Chop. Thunder Punch takes care of Mantyke, and also gives Magby a reliable way to take out Drifloon.</p> <p>Magby is one of the best wallbreakers in Little Cup because of its ability to take down every defensive combo with the 4 attacks given. For this reason, Pokemon such as Machop, Mankey, and Gligar make great teammates, as they each appreciate Bronzor out of the way. Gastly, Mantyke, and basically any special sweepers benefit from Munchlax being taken out, as it makes their sweep much easier to pull off with the main special wall of the metagame gone.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Even with a base Speed stat of 83, Magby is still outsped by a select few unboosted Pokemon and Choice Scarf users. This makes Magby a great candidate for a Choice Scarf, with its respectable Attack stat and great coverage. With Magby's impressive Speed stat, it will outspeed the majority of Choice Scarf users, and even some Rock Polish users such as Rhyhorn. Flare Blitz is Magby's move of choice, dishing out plenty of damage to any foe that isn't resistant to it. Thunder Punch takes care of most Water-types switching in, with the exception of Chinchou. Hidden Power Ice is great in the last slot to revenge kill Gligar, and even hit some of the bulkier Rock-types. Brick Break can be used over Mach Punch with Choice Scarf to revenge kill most Aron (defensive variants can still survive), as Mach Punch won't OHKO. Flare Blitz is illegal with Cross Chop, so you are reduced to using Fire Punch as a main STAB move if you want the stronger Fighting-type attack than Brick Break. If you want the extra punch, Magby can use a Lonely nature as its Speed is already blistering fast.</p> <p>If you feel that a Choice Scarf is redundant with Magby's great Speed stat, then a Choice Band can also be used. A Choice Band-boosted Flare Blitz will incinerate a good portion of the metagame with ease, OHKOing even physically bulky Pokemon such as Gligar and Duskull. However, the recoil can be dangerous. Mach Punch is a force to be reckoned with as well, as a Choice Band-boosted priority move should never be overlooked.</p> <p>This set needs the most defensive support due to its inability to switch attacks, because even if you predict correctly and KO an opponent's Pokemon, they can switch in whatever Pokemon they have that resists said attack. Houndour and other Flash Fire users will be switching into Flare Blitz once in a while, so having a Flash Fire user of your own is definitely a good idea, as a boosted Fire Blast coming off of Houndour's excellent Special Attack will dent even Pokemon who resist Fire-type attacks. Magby will often be caught using the wrong attack, especially if you have KOed a Pokemon with that attack already. This means that Magby will need general defensive support, so Pokemon such as Munchlax and Bronzor pair quite nicely with Magby.</p>"

While many think of it to be in the shadow of other status abusers such as Taillow and Teddiursa, Larvitar can be a formidable physical sweeper with correct support. Although its weaknesses to common priority moves reduce its effectiveness, much like Tyranitar in OU, the little dinosaur can rip holes in unprepared teams with little difficulty.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Sadly, Larvitar does not have much of a movepool apart from what has been mentioned already. Outrage may be used for great neutral coverage, although the undesirable side effect discourages usage. Superpower hits Bronzor harder than any other move, but the Attack drop is usually not worth it. Larvitar can try and pull off a Curse set, but with the huge amount of weaknesses it possesses, Larvitar won't be staying around long enough to make full use of it.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Larvitar's only true counter is Bronzor. Resistance to its STAB attacks alongside the ability to OHKO Larvitar with Gyro Ball solidify its place as a Larvitar counter. Besides Bronzor, priority users such as Croagunk and Carvanha can also check Larvitar with ease. Effectively, anything with a super effective priority move can be considered a decent check to the little dinosaur.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Larvitar's claim to fame lies in its ability to boost both its Attack and Speed to phenomenal levels in just one turn. Rock Polish is the preferred option as it allows Larvitar to outspeed all Choice Scarf users who have 17 Speed or less while maintaining a respectable 25 Attack. Dragon Dance puts Larvitar at 21 Speed after one use, outrunning every non-boosted Pokemon in Little Cup, and also allows Larvitar to reach an astronomical Attack stat of 36. Earthquake, a very powerful move in Little Cup that also comes with STAB, makes an obvious choice on the moveset. However, choosing between Stone Edge and Rock Slide all depends on power and accuracy, though Stone Edge is generally the better option as Larvitar wants to deal as much damage as it can before getting KOed. Crunch makes for great filler, being able to hit the Ghost-types of Little Cup, while being your most effective move against Bronzor.</p> <p>Toxic Orb does less damage than Flame Orb over the first two turns, equal damage on the third turn, and starts to do more damage on each subsequent turn after that. As Larvitar tends to stay in and sweep for as long as it can, Toxic Orb is generally less useful than Flame Orb.</p> <p>Priority is the bane of Larvitar. Common priority users such as Croagunk, Carvanha, and Squirtle cut Larvitar's sweep short and should be dealt with before bringing Larvitar in. Mantyke in particular is extremely effective at removing the most common of the above, Croagunk, with Hidden Power Flying. Mantyke also has great synergy with Larvitar, possessing immunities to Water- and Ground-type attacks, while taking pitiful damage from most Grass-type attacks due to its impressive Special Defense. Mantyke can also punch holes in the opponent's physical walls, making Larvitar's sweep easier. A Croagunk of your own can also greatly help Larvitar in its sweep by absorbing Water- and Grass-type attacks, as well as finish off Pokemon who barely survive Larvitar's onslaught. Choice Scarf Magnemite can remove Bronzor from the game, who is never 2HKOed by Crunch through Oran Berry. Wynaut is a great teammate to Larvitar, as it provides the important set up turn with the help of Encore. Wynaut can also remove Choice Scarf users, which is helpful if you are using Dragon Dance instead of Rock Polish. Finally, dual screen support is appreciated, as it may allow Larvitar to set up two turns in a row, though finding time to set up may prove to be a challenge.</p>"

However, Poochyena has a rare ability in Quick Feet and hits 14 Speed, allowing it to outspeed all Pokemon who do not carry a Choice Scarf once Quick Feet is activated. Overall, Poochyena can be a dangerous threat when given the proper scenario.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Fire Fang can be used if you want Poochyena to hit Steel-type Pokemon, but the most common Steel-type, Bronzor, is only 3HKOed. A mixed set consisting of Dark Pulse, Hidden Power Ice, Sucker Punch, and Thunder Fang could work due to its power and decent coverage. However, a special set is not mentioned because Poochyena's pitiful special movepool is limited to Dark Pulse and Hidden Power. Rock Smash allows Poochyena to beat Aron, who would otherwise freely set up on Poochyena, as well as soften up switch-ins with its 50% chance of lowering the opponent's Defense. Lastly, Snatch can be used against Pokemon who try to counter Poochyena with Substitute, stealing their Substitutes if they don't attack, as Poochyena threatens to hit them hard with Sucker Punch if they do choose to attack.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Bronzor counters Poochyena rather well, as it is only afraid of Fire Fang, which only 3HKOes Bronzor at best; as such, Bronzor can comfortably switch in, set up Stealth Rock, and strike back with Gyro Ball. Choice Scarf Mankey and Machop are great checks to Poochyena, since both are able to OHKO it with Close Combat and do not fear taking a resisted Sucker Punch; Mankey is especially effective, as it can deal lots of damage with U-turn while scouting for a potential switch-in at the same time. Though not a counter, Gastly is immune to Facade and can set up a Substitute while Poochyena uses Sucker Punch, allowing Gastly to take out Poochyena the next turn with Sludge Bomb. Though not a particularly effective strategy, Poochyena's opponents can play mind games with it by using non-damaging moves when Poochyena uses Sucker Punch, making it waste precious turns while Toxic damage slowly accumulates. Poochyena is very frail, so any priority move that it does not resist will deal huge amounts of damage even if it does not outright KO.</p>",

With boosted Speed, Poochyena can then put some major dents in the opponent's team with the respective attacks. Poochyena has access to STAB Sucker Punch, one of the strongest priority moves in the game, which allows it to pick off weakened Pokemon. Once Toxic Orb activates, Facade's Base Power doubles to 140, making Poochyena an extremely tough Pokemon to counter. Ice Fang lets Poochyena hit Gligar, who would normally wall this set, for super effective damage. Protect allows Toxic Orb to be activated without Poochyena getting attacked, and is also useful for scouting. Crunch is a reliable STAB option in the last slot that can additionally lower the target's Defense 20% of the time. Howl is also an option, as it allows Poochyena to boost its Attack.</p> <p>Poochyena should be sent in on a weakened Pokemon who can be picked off with Sucker Punch. This allows Poochyena to activate Toxic Orb while KOing the opposing Pokemon with Sucker Punch. Moreover, Poochyena can forgo Protect in this case for Crunch or Howl. It should be noted that Facade, when Poochyena has a status affliction, deals more damage to a neutral target than STAB Sucker Punch. Ghost-types are immune to Facade, but cannot check Poochyena because they are threatened by Sucker Punch and Crunch. The EV spread gives Poochyena maximum Attack and Speed, while boosting its Special Defense by one point with the remaining EVs.</p> <p>Gligar is an excellent teammate, as it is able to eliminate bulky Steel-type Pokemon such as Aron with Earthquake. As a plus, Gligar has U-turn to scout the opponent's team, letting Poochyena's Toxic Orb activate for free by bringing Poochyena in after using U-turn on a predicted switch. Gligar also resists Fighting- and Bug-type attacks that Poochyena is weak to.

However, Lotad's low defenses doesn't allow it to set up often. Lotad can attempt to make use of Swords Dance , but lacks a physical Water-type STAB. Lotad also gets Synthesis, which helps it recover HP, but its effectiveness is hampered by rain.

Rain Dance is probably the most useful move in the last slot to both support the team and speed up Lotad itself. You can, however, run Hidden Power Rock as it allows you to hit Mantyke, who would otherwise wall your other attacks, for super effective damage. Hidden Power Rock can also rough up Snover on the switch, which is a pain for Rain Dance teams to face. Lowering the HP IV stat to 2 allows Lotad to reach 19 HP, which is a Life Orb number, and still maintain a 70 Base Power Hidden Power. The EVs are designed to max out Speed and Special Attack while the rest is dumped into Defense and Special Defense to add bulk.</p> <p>Lotad can potentially play two different roles on a team: late-game sweeper or wallbreaker. Lotad can damage many common Rain team counters like Croagunk, Munchlax, and Snover, but don't expect it to take retaliation well. Lotad can also easily sweep once a few walls are removed. Hidden Power Psychic is an option to hit Croagunk, who can damage Lotad severely, on the switch. Rain Dance can also be used in the last slot but Lotad is so slow and fragile that it will be KOed by most attacks before it can set up Rain Dance. Voltorb is the ideal lead to set up Rain Dance because of its excellent Speed. Bronzor is another Pokemon that can help set up rain for Lotad; it can also take on Snover, who is a pain for Lotad and Rain Dance teams in general.</p> <p>Bulky Pokemon, like Munchlax and Snover, and priority users, like Croagunk, cause Lotad pain. Chople Berry Kabuto helps to deal with these Pokemon. Kabuto hurts Munchlax badly with Waterfall in the rain and can crush Snover with Rock Slide. Kabuto also lures out Croagunk, survives a Vacuum Wave, and hit Croagunk back with Aerial Ace.</p>"

  "Seedot": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Seedot looks like a poor choice as a Pokemon. It has mediocre stats across the board, with its highest being a Defense stat of 50, something that it can't even effectively utilize. However, with Sunny Day up, Seedot's Speed doubles to an impressive 26. It also has access to Solar Beam and Explosion, two very powerful moves. Unfortunately, the rest of Seedot's movepool is very shallow, but it is still just enough for Seedot to succeed. Even so, it is still slightly outclassed as a sweeper by Exeggcute. All in all, though Seedot isn't a very impressive Pokemon, it should be at least considered for a team slot on a dedicated Sunny Day team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>There really aren't any other options for Seedot. Return is a potential option to smack Munchlax without having to sacrifice Seedot, but Explosion is still usually a better choice as Return does not even 3HKO Munchlax factoring in Oran Berry. Seedot has Swords Dance, but it won't be able to hit as hard (or get as good coverage) as it would with Nasty Plot. Seed Bomb can be used over Solar Beam, since it still hits Hippopotas hard and does not screw Seedot over when a Snover switches in. Seedot possesses Quick Attack for priority. It can also change its Hidden Power to hit specific threats.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>There aren't many holes in Seedot's coverage, despite its weak attacks. All Snover has to fear is Hidden Power Fire, and it also ends Sunny Day thanks to its ability, Snow Warning. Choice Scarf users with 27 or more Speed and a super effective attack also work well, since Seedot won't be taking many attacks with its thin defenses. Choice Scarf Ponyta and Gligar are both great checks, and the former even gets double STAB on its Fire-type attacks with the sun up. Scarf Staryu, if it can avoid a Solar Beam, can KO Seedot with Ice Beam. Another good way to stop Seedot is by using prediction - switching in a Ghost-type on Explosion is good, but you must watch for a counter-predicted Shadow Ball.</p>",

      "Sunny Day Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>This is probably the best set that Seedot is capable of running. Obviously, Sunny Day support is necessary in order for Seedot to attempt a sweep. Solar Beam is a very powerful STAB attack, and will not have to charge up under the sun. Hidden Power Fire gets good coverage alongside Solar Beam, and the coverage of the two is resisted only by Fire-types (which aren't very bulky to begin with), and pure Dragon-types (in Dratini and the uncommon Bagon). However, Hidden Power Ground can be used to hit said Fire-types, but loses overall coverage. Shadow Ball is a good coverage move, hitting Ghost-types that may try to come in on a predicted Explosion for super effective damage. Explosion should be used as a last resort, and it allows Seedot to easily OHKO Munchlax before going down, potentially clearing the way for another sweeper on your team. Life Orb boosts the power of all of Seedot's moves, and the EVs further boost them. Speed is also maximized, because Seedot will want and need to outspeed everything it can. The 3 HP IVs drop Seedot's Hit Points to 19, a Life Orb number.</p> <p>Sunny Day support is absolutely necessary for Seedot to work at all. Koffing, Ponyta, and Diglett are all decent supporters that can provide said weather support whilst having decent synergy with Seedot. Hidden Power Ice is an interesting option to use over the ones mentioned and gets a guaranteed OHKO on Gligar, but it isn't useful outside of that purpose. Other Sunny Day sweepers are also helpful in pulling off a sweep. Thanks to Explosion, Seedot can eliminate a problematic Pokemon, such as Munchlax, to open a sweep for a partner, such as Oddish. If the goal is to open a sweep for Oddish, Pokemon that can remove faster threats are highly recommended. Munchlax can remove Choice Scarf Gastly, while Koffing can beat Choice Scarf Gligar.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Though Seedot doesn't have the greatest Speed in the world, Nasty Plot is the only thing that sets it apart from Exeggcute. After a single Nasty Plot boost, Seedot hits a Special Attack stat of 26, easily tearing apart most of the metagame. Solar Beam is Seedot's strongest STAB attack and, after a Nasty Plot boost, has a high chance of OHKOing any Pokemon that doesn't resist it (excluding Munchlax, who is 2HKOed through Oran Berry). With Sunny Day in play, Hidden Power Fire gets a 1.5x increase, and pairs very well alongside Solar Beam. However, Hidden Power Ground can be used instead to hit Fire-types harder, though not very many can survive a +2 Solar Beam. Finally, Shadow Ball smacks Ghost-types for super effective damage, most notably Gastly, who can stave off a Solar Beam and can OHKO back with Sludge Bomb. The EVs maximize Special Attack and Speed, with an extra point going to Defense and Special Defense. If using Hidden Power Ground, add another 4 EVs to Special Defense to make up for the lost IVs.</p> <p>Sunny Day support is absolutely necessary for this set; Exeggcute, Diglett, and Koffing are all decent Pokemon that can set up Sunny Day. In addition, this set will lose to many (if not all) Choice Scarf sweepers with 27 Speed or more, namely Gligar, Gastly, and Staryu, all of which can OHKO with a super effective attack. Gastly and Staryu are easy targets for Munchlax, who can stop both of them with little trouble. Wynaut is also a good teammate, as it can Encore an opposing Pokemon into a support move or a weak attack that Seedot resists (like Aqua Jet). With the Encored Pokemon locked in completely, Seedot should be able to switch in and set up Nasty Plot fairly easily.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Surskit is a cute little pond skater, but sadly that is pretty much the highlight of its merits. It can Baton Pass Agility, but there are better options that can do that as well. Its attacking skills at times can also seem lacking. It can work in rain, but isn't nearly as strong as other Rain Dance abusers such as Omanyte. However, what it has over its fellow special Rain Dance sweepers is that it hits 32 Speed in the Rain, allowing it to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, including Scarfed Diglett, Elekid, and Voltorb. Its unique typing means that it resists many common attacking types, namely Fighting, Ground, and Water, giving it a distinctive niche in the metagame, allowing it to outclass Omanyte when it comes to resistances. Its ability to beat Croagunk and Gligar, two major threats in the metagame, with 4x super effective attacks is something Omanyte normally would not be able to do. Don't let this little guy fool you, because with the right support around him, Surskit can be a complete monster.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Surskit really doesn't have all too great a movepool, so its sets are rather limited. However, it still gets some good stuff. Bug Bite can be used on the Baton Pass set, possibly allowing it to eat an Oran Berry carried by a foe, and gain extra health to allow it to survive longer and pass on more boosts, and its Attack is only 2 points lower than its Special Attack. Shadow Ball can also be used to hit Ghosts harder than Psybeam, although Surskit does then lose coverage on Croagunk. Hidden Power Ground is viable, enabling it to hit both Croagunk and Chinchou, but an extra 4 SpD EVs are necessary. That's fine, because Surskit has plenty of EVs to spare. Unfortunately, Mantyke walls any set without Hidden Power Electric. A Choice Scarf looks appealing at first sight, but Surskit performs better in the rain. Ice Beam is a nice option, giving it \"BoltBeam\" coverage, only resisted by Magnemite. It is not mentioned on the Rainskit set, however, because Hydro Pump will be doing more damage to most Pokemon, except for pure Dragons such as Dratini and Bagon.</p> <p>Maxing out Special Attack and Speed are two of Surskit's main priorities. In order to get the most out of Surskit's remaining EVs the following EV spread should be used: 36 HP / 200 SpA / 236 Spe / 20 SpD. This spread allows you to get 1 extra point in your HP and Special Defense stats, while maxing out you Special Attack and Speed stats. If using HP Ground, add an extra 4 EVs into Surskit's Special Defense.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Munchlax is the best counter around for Surskit; its defensive stats allow it take whatever Surskit throws at it, then hit back with a Return for the OHKO. Chinchou can take Surskit's hits pretty well, has a STAB Thunderbolt to strike back at Surskit with, and only fears Hidden Power Ground. Mantyke and Croagunk absorb his Hydro Pump, but Surskit will almost always carry a 4x super effective move to hit them with in the form of Hidden Power Electric and Psybeam respectively. Doduo and Taillow can outspeed Surskit without rain and revenge kill it with Brave Bird. Snover puts an end to rain and can switch in on Surskit's Hydro Pump, but needs a Choice Scarf in order to outspeed Surskit, and can't switch in on a Signal Beam.</p>",

The general idea is that you bring Surskit in while it's raining, and proceed to hit as many things as possible. Hydro Pump is the main method of attack, mainly because Surskit needs power and doesn't learn Surf. Hidden Power Electric puts an end to Mantyke that think they can switch in, and STAB Hydro Pump in the rain hits Chinchou just as hard as a super effective Hidden Power Grass would. Psybeam is the weakest attack, and is mainly used as a coverage move against Croagunk, who is immune to Water and doesn't get hit very hard by Hidden Power Electric. Signal Beam is really just a filler move, but it can be useful as a secondary STAB. Quick Attack is a nice option to give Surskit a priority move in the rain. If getting another Pokemon to set up Rain Dance isn't an option, you can always drop Signal Beam and replace it with Rain Dance.</p> <p>Aipom, Bronzor, Mantyke, Meowth, and Voltorb all work extremely well alongside this Surskit. Aipom, Meowth, and Voltorb have the Speed needed in order to set up a quick Rain Dance, and the offensive ability to take something to the grave in the process. Bronzor and Mantyke are two rather bulky Pokemon, and said bulk allows them to take hits with ease, and still manage to set up Rain Dance.</p>"

      "Agilipass": {
        "description": "<p>You may think Surskit is a Pokemon who is only good in the rain, but that is not entirely the case. Surskit can effectively Baton Pass an Agility to your slower, heavy-hitting sweepers, and allow them to outpace everything but priority attacks. Hydro Pump is for powerful STAB, so you're not totally useless on your own. The final move and the item are up to personal preference. Endure can be combined with a Pinch Berry, such as a Petaya or Liechi Berry, to pass something other than just Speed. Substitute can do the same, but also allows you to pass a Substitute in order to ensure that the pass goes through. Ice Beam, although giving Surskit inferior coverage as opposed to Hidden Power Electric, prevents Dragon Dance Dratini and Bagon from setting up. Oran Berry can provide a little more bulk, though Surskit is hard-pressed to survive most attacks. Focus Sash can help ensure the pass, though Stealth Rock makes it harder to use unless Surskit is leading.</p> <p>Cubone and Porygon make two effective partners for this set. If Surskit decides to only pass a Speed boost, Cubone can make the most of the added Speed. If Surskit chooses to pass both Special Attack and Speed, then a Special Attacking tank such as Porygon would make the best option to pass to. You could even start a chain of Baton Passing, and pass to a Pokemon such as Gligar, who then can stat up on Attack and pass to a sweeper.</p>"

  "Shroomish": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>When used effectively, Shroomish can make your opponent rip their hair out in frustration. Despite its poor base stats and movepool, Shroomish can make use of its ability, Poison Heal, to be somewhat successful. Shroomish boasts one of the most annoying sets in all of Little Cup, and this is one of the few sets that can stall in Little Cup. After setting up, Shroomish is very difficult to revenge kill, as it sports useful resistances to Electric-, Water-, and Ground-type attacks. Poison Heal, in tandem with Toxic Orb, allows Shroomish to regain HP even without Leech Seed, though Leech Seed must be up to effectively stall out your opponent. Though it can pull off this one set with great success, it falters in many other areas. Its inability to hit the opponent hard is its biggest weakness, so it cannot be relied upon to break any walls with sheer force.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Unfortunately, Shroomish has a horrible movepool and does not have many options outside of the moves listed in the Shroom Stall set. Shroomish can attempt to use a moveset consisting of Spore and Wake-Up Slap in order to have a 120 Base Power move while the opponent is sleeping, but most sleeping opponents will switch out. You may also attempt to use Toxic on the Shroom Stall set instead of Spore to speed up the stalling process. Instead of using Spore, it is possible to chose to attack the opponent instead of putting it to sleep. Seed Bomb offers a reliable STAB move, while Facade could prove valuable once poisoned. Sludge bomb may be used if you would like to hit Grass-types, most notably Snover, for super effective damage.</p> <p>Shroomish can run a Choice Scarf set fairly well. With 236 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature it hits the magic Speed number of 14. This allows Shroomish to outrun any Pokemon without a Choice Scarf and put them to sleep with Spore. Unfortunately, with base 40 Attack and 40 Special Attack, Shroomish can't do much except for revenge kill weakened Pokemon.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Shroomish is countered by any heavy hitter who is faster than it, as they will likely KO Shroomish before it has a chance to set up. Since Shroomish has no way to defend itself with attacking options, any Pokemon running Substitute can avoid being stalled by Leech Seed. If you can predict when Shroomish will use Protect, you can then switch in a Pokemon to break its Substitute and hit it hard next turn. Meowth makes a great Shroomish counter, as it can break Shroomish's Substitute with Fake Out and then hit it with U-turn. Basically, destroying Shroomish's Substitute leaves it vulnerable to faster threats, so if Shroomish is not behind a Substitute, you should have no trouble dispatching it. Grass-types in particular have no trouble with Shroomish, as they aren't affected by Leech Seed. Dratini also poses huge problems for Shroomish, as its ability, Shed Skin, effectively combats the effect of Spore.</p>",

      "SubSeed": {
        "description": "<p>With a combination of good typing, a wonderful ability, and decent defenses, Shroomish is able to cause havoc easily with its SubSeed set. The main idea of the set is to switch in on a resisted attack and either Substitute or Spore the Pokemon coming in on the switch. From there, Shroomish uses a combination of the HP it receives from Poison Heal and Leech Seed to stall out the opposition. This is even easier to carry out thanks to the plethora of Pokemon abusing Choice items in Little Cup.</p> <p>With 25 HP, 16 Defense, and 14 Special Defense, Shroomish can run arguably the most effective SubSeeding set in all of Little Cup. This set achieves its goal by using a combination of Substitute and Protect to make sure that the opponent cannot touch you, while draining their health with Leech Seed and restoring your own. Spore allows Shroomish to put the opponent to sleep 100% of the time, allowing for easy setup.</p> <p>Shroomish's plethora of resistances to the common attacking types in Little Cup help it easily switch in and set up. Once in, Shroomish can safely put the opponent to sleep with Spore and begin the stalling cycle. Use Substitute on the switch and Leech Seed as the opponent breaks your Substitute. Then, simply alternate between Substitute and Protect to drain your opponent's HP until it is KOed.</p> <p>Despite Shroomish's resistances, its Grass typing gives it several weaknesses as well. Be wary of Ice-, Flying-, and Fire-type attacks when attempting to set up. Ghosts can cause huge problems if they haven't been hit by Leech Seed, as they can easily outpace and KO Shroomish with a STAB Shadow Ball. A dual screen user, such as Bronzor, can help Shroomish take hits better, and Munchlax makes a great partner for Shroomish thanks to its great bulk and ability to counter troublesome Ghosts with Pursuit. Shroomish also has trouble with Wynaut since it has Encore.</p>"

        "description": "<p>While giving a Choice Scarf to such a slow Pokemon may seem silly, the boost gives Shroomish the magic 21 Speed, which allows it to outspeed all unboosted Pokemon. This makes Shroomish a very effective anti-lead, allowing it to outrun and sleep any non-Scarfed Pokemon with its 100% accurate Spore. This set can prevent most leads from setting up Stealth Rock. It can immobilize many top leads, including Hippopotas, Meowth, and Snover, simply by using Spore on them. Neither Snover's Ice Shard nor Meowth's Fake Out will ever OHKO Shroomish, allowing it to safely incapacitate them with Spore. Energy Ball allows Shroomish to deal with leads such as Diglett, Hippopotas, Phanpy, Kabuto, and Omanyte. Sludge Bomb gives Shroomish some extra coverage while Stun Spore is convenient for paralyzing Pokemon like Gligar.</p> <p>Shroomish doesn't have a fantastic movepool, but it can run a physical moveset as well. Seed Bomb may be used over Energy Ball to hit specially defensive Pokemon harder while Return complements it for extra coverage. Wake-Up Slap can be used to hit Snover, Houndour, and Aron a bit harder. Hidden Power Ice can also be used to kill Gligar. Shroomish's main objective is to use Spore against the opponent; if it can't OHKO the opposing lead, it should Spore to prevent the opposing lead from setting up. If the lead switches to take the hit, it ends up being slept rather than taking minimal damage. Choice Scarf Shroomish faces some competition from Choice Scarf Venonat. However, Venonat has Sleep Powder which, after Compound Eyes, only has 97.5% accuracy as opposed to Shroomish's 100% accurate Spore. Venonat also lacks Energy Ball, which is very useful in the lead position for dealing with common Ground- and Water-type leads. After its use in the lead position, Shroomish can revenge kill certain Pokemon that are weak to Energy Ball or use Spore on another target if the other Pokemon has fainted. Toxic can be also used to cripple a Pokemon, but seeing as Little Cup is a very fast paced metagame, it would be of little use.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Shroomish pairs up well with Houndour, as Houndour can absorb the Fire-type attacks thrown at Shroomish with Flash Fire. Chinchou can switch into nearly all attacks that Shroomish is weak to and set up. Keep in mind that Shroomish cannot set up Stealth Rock, so if the team strongly benefits from a Stealth Rock user, something like Bronzor or Omanyte may be used.</p> <p>Any Choice Scarfed lead, such as Mankey and Gastly, will beat this set. Leads with Lum Berry can take Shroomish's Spore and and KO with any attack. Houndour that run Early Bird and Sucker Punch can also take Shroomish down. Leads with priority can significantly damage Shroomish, but generally cannot OHKO it due to its reasonable defenses.</p>"

A Choice Scarf set can be considered, but due to the fact that it is slow and weak, there are much better users of Choice Scarf. Sucker Punch is an interesting option to circumvent Slakoth's low Speed. Body Slam has a nice 30% chance of paralysis, which can actually allow Slakoth to outspeed other Pokemon. Finally, Yawn or Substitute can be used to try to preserve Slakoth during its Truant turn, but gives it no advantage once the opposing Pokemon switches or the Substitute is broken.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>The easiest way to deal with Slakoth is just to attack it, especially with strong special attacks. Slakoth has poor defenses, and will be OHKOed by the attacks of many sweepers. Protect or Substitute will completely shut down Slakoth, as it will be able to do nothing during the Truant turn. Bulky Ghost- or Steel-types, such as Duskull, can wall Slakoth and use Will-O-Wisp to cripple it.

Ice Punch will net Slakoth an OHKO on non-physically defensive Gligar, while Hammer Arm and Fire Punch are used as coverage moves. Keep in mind that Slakoth should usually be switched out after an attack to minimize the drawbacks of Truant. Truant is also the reason why Choice Band is used instead of Life Orb here, as Slakoth will usually not be alive long enough (without a switch) to use a second attack.</p> <p>The EVs are self-explanatory. Slakoth should not run Speed EVs, as it is so slow that even with maximum Speed and a Jolly nature, it cannot even outrun Machop. Double-Edge can be used over Return for additional power, but will diminish Slakoth's HP. Night Slash or Shadow Claw can be used over Pursuit to try to catch Ghost-types trying to switch in to take a Return, as Pursuit would hit the Pokemon switching out instead of the Ghost-type. As Slakoth needs to switch out after each attack, it requires a team with many immunities. A Ghost-type such as Gastly or Duskull is helpful to take the Fighting-type attacks aimed at Slakoth.</p>"

It also has a good movepool with plenty of options, but unfortunately suffers from a low Speed stat. Due to that low Speed, it can only thrive in one environment -- Trick Room. Thankfully, once Trick Room has been set up, Whismur becomes quite the wallbreaker.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Whismur doesn't have a lot of other moves, but it does have some stuff worth mentioning. It can run a pure special set consisting of Hyper Voice, Ice Beam, Flamethrower, and Hidden Power Electric, but then it would lose too quickly to Munchlax. Flamethrower may be used in lieu of Fire Blast for its better accuracy, but Whismur needs all the power it can get. Whismur has access to Rest, Sleep Talk, and a boosting move in Howl, but its weakness to Fighting and low defenses prevent those moves from being viable. It can also run Hidden Power Ground to take out Magnemite, Stunky, Houndour, and others.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>If Trick Room is not up, Fighting-types walk all over Whismur. If Whismur lacks Shadow Ball, Gastly beats it regardless if Trick Room is in play. If Whismur doesn't have Fire Blast, Steels laugh at its attacks. Magnemite would resist its entire moveset and can do a lot of damage in return with Thunderbolt. Duskull can take a Shadow Ball and burn Whismur before having to switch out. The best thing to do is to catch Whismur outside of Trick Room and hit it with powerful attacks since it won't be taking numerous hits any time soon.</p>",

      "Trick Room Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This is the best and probably only set that Whismur can run efficiently. Return is its strongest STAB attack, capable of dealing large amounts of damage to anything that doesn't resist or isn't immune to it. Thunder Punch and Ice Beam give Whismur \"BoltBeam\" coverage, resisted only by Magnemite and Chinchou in Little Cup. This combo is also effective because Thunder Punch hits Water-types on their typically lower Defense stat while Ice Beam hits Ground-types on their weaker Special Defense stat; this allows Whismur to become a powerful Trick Room wallbreaker. The final slot is purely a matter of preference: Shadow Ball smacks Duskull and other Ghost-types for super effective damage, while Fire Blast allows Whismur to beat Bronzor and Magnemite -- two Pokemon that can otherwise wall this set. Life Orb is necessary so Whismur can deal as much damage as possible while still having the ability to change attacks at will. Whismur's nature can vary - a Brave nature will boost its physical moves further, while a Quiet nature will enhance Whismur's special moves. The EVs maximize Attack and Special Attack, and the remainder adds two points to Defense, one to Special Defense, and the other to HP. Since Whismur can't get down to 19 HP, the extra HP might come in handy.</p> <p>The most obvious support for this Whismur will be from Trick Room. The best Trick Room supporters are Ghost-types -- Drifloon, Duskull, and even Gastly are good for this. Ghost-types are important because they have good defensive synergy with Whismur. Stealth Rock support is also nice, so less Pokemon will be inclined to switch around on Whismur, especially if they mispredict. Pineco resists Fighting-type attacks, can set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes, and use Explosion to possibly remove a wall before it goes down. If Whismur isn't using Fire Blast, Bronzor walks all over this set. Magnemite will help a lot in that case, but it shares a common weakness to Fighting with Whismur. Since Munchlax also gives this set some trouble, Fighting-type partners are very useful. A bulky Machop is great, since it can also take advantage of Trick Room with its low Speed.</p>"

With an ability in Thick Fat, Makuhita gains resistances to Fire- and Ice-type attacks, making threats such as Houndour easy to deal with. It was given a large physical movepool to complement its decent Attack stat, including all of the elemental punches. However, Makuhita has a tough time against physical walls, such as Gligar, whose stats and typing allow it to easily counter Makuhita (as long as it does not come in on an Ice Punch). Overall, Makuhita is a decent Pokemon with, like every other Pokemon, its own flaws.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Makuhita doesn't have too many other options due to its limited movepool. Fire Punch can be used to hit Bronzor and Bug-type Pokemon for super effective damage. Makuhita gets a couple of decent special attacks, but with such a terrible Special Attack stat, this is an inferior option. Earthquake is not used, simply because Makuhita's STAB Fighting-type attacks already hit most of the same opponents for more damage. Superpower is an option, but the drop to Makuhita's Attack and Defense stats can be severely dangerous.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Ghost-type Pokemon, such as Duskull, counter Makuhita very well, as they can switch into a Fighting-type move and cripple Makuhita with a status condition. Offensive Pokemon who outspeed Makuhita can be a major threat outside of Trick Room. Even Pokemon who don't outspeed Makuhita can severely damage it with priority moves. Koffing resists Makuhita's STAB attacks and can OHKO with STAB Sludge Bomb. Although it's a great partner, Bronzor can also be used to counter a Makuhita not running Fire Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>This is Makuhita's standard lead set. The main purpose is to use Fake Out on turn one, which will cause the opposing Pokemon to flinch. Makuhita can then proceed to do damage the opponent with either Close Combat or Rock Slide. Bullet Punch is helpful as it gives Makuhita a priority attack. Ice Punch is an option for hitting Gligar who would otherwise counter this set. Cross Chop can be used instead of Close Combat if the Defense and Special Defense drop is off-putting, but Makuhita's defensive stats are dangerously low to begin with. As for the item, Oran Berry lets Makuhita recover a good amount of health if it can last long enough for it to activate.</p> <p>The EVs may seem complicated, but they are used for a specific purpose. This spread gives Makuhita a Speed stat of 13 and an Attack stat of 15. The remaining EVs are invested in Makuhita's Defense and Special Defense stats for a bit of extra bulk. Rock Slide is the better move for this set, as it inflicts a good amount of damage and has a chance to make your opponent flinch if it can outspeed it. However, using Rock Slide means missing out on Ice Punch for Gligar, who can be a real problem. Toxic can be used if walls are proving problem, but it makes this set more of a supporter than an actual lead. Bronzor is a sturdy wall who takes care of Makuhita's weaknesses and can set up Stealth Rock. Any Pokemon who can set up entry hazards would be a good partner for Makuhita, as it can cause a lot of switches. Makuhita has trouble taking out Gligar and Pokemon who have decent attack stats, as its poor defensive stats would not stand a chance against them.</p>"

After using a Belly Drum, Makuhita reaches a staggering Attack stat of 64, allowing it to tear through almost any Pokemon. Oran Berry helps Makuhita recover most of the HP it loses after using Belly Drum, which is helpful. Bullet Punch is for hitting Pokemon who are slower than Makuhita, as they can outpace it if Trick Room is up. Close Combat and Cross Chop are both exceptional attacking options, but both have their flaws. Close Combat gives Makuhita a Defense and Special Defense drop every time it is used, while Cross Chop has shaky accuracy and less power. Ice Punch is the preferred option for the final slot for hitting Gligar, who would otherwise counter Makuhita. Fire Punch can be used as well to hit Bug-types and Bronzor, but has little use outside of that.</p> <p>The item chosen depends on the team being used. Life Orb can be used for the boost in power, but it greatly reduces Makuhita's longevity, as Belly Drum already depletes half of its health. Oran Berry is preferred, as it recovers 10 HP after using Belly Drum. Makuhita is better used with the help of a dual screener so as to reduce damage taken. Once again, Bronzor makes for a good teammate, as it is a decent wall and covers Makuhita's weaknesses.</p>"

However, it does have a fairly large support movepool, which it can use to cripple opposing Pokemon, as well as heal itself while simultaneously damaging the opponent. These qualities, along with its high defenses, mean that Nosepass can fare quite well in the LC metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>As far as support moves go, Nosepass doesn't have many other options. Block can be used to prevent Pokemon from switching out from you, allowing you to have an easier time taking out the opponent's Pokemon. Nosepass should not run offensive sets because its offensive stats are terrible. Magnet Rise can be used to avoid getting hit by Ground-type attacks such as Gligar's Earthquake. A Gravity set consisting of Gravity, Stone Edge, Dynamic Punch, and Zap Cannon could work, but again, Nosepass's offensive stats are too disappointing.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Pokemon who have two super effective moves against Nosepass will usually end up winning. Gligar is a great counter to Nosepass, being able to take advantage of the sand, set up a Substitute to avoid status, before hurting Nosepass with Earthquake or Aqua Tail. Speaking of Substitute, all Pokemon who have Substitute can comfortably wall Nosepass because Nosepass often has no moves that can break it. From there, the Substitute Pokemon can either set up or defeat Nosepass outright. Taunt also shuts Nosepass down, forcing it to either attack off its weak Attack stat or switch. Finally, Pokemon with Toxic can completely debilitate Nosepass; Nosepass may be able to heal with Pain Split, but the Toxic damage will build up and eventually take Nosepass out.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This set makes use of Nosepass's bulk in the sand, where it reaches 22 HP, 25 Defense, and 24 Special Defense, allowing it to tank both physical and special attacks with ease. Nosepass is great at setting up Stealth Rock because of its natural bulk. Thunder Wave allows Nosepass to cripple Pokemon who are faster than it, and gives Nosepass's teammates an easier time against them. Explosion allows Nosepass to knock out a Pokemon along with it, after Nosepass has accomplished what it needs to do. Stone Edge prevents Nosepass from being completely shut down by Taunt without needing to Explode, and is a good way to take out weakened Pokemon. Protect can be used to scout and stall for sandstorm damage, while Taunt is a good option to prevent Pokemon from setting up on Nosepass.</p> <p>Oran Berry allows Nosepass to have a longer lifespan. Its EV spread maximizes its HP and Defense, while boosting its Special Defense by one point. Hippopotas is a must on any team that utilizes Nosepass, as its Sand Stream ability will boost Nosepass's Special Defense to 24. Having Stealth Rock on Nosepass frees up a moveslot on Hippopotas, allowing it to either use Roar or a coverage move instead. Slow Pokemon who hit hard appreciate the paralysis that Nosepass can spread throughout the opposing team. Thanks to Nosepass's bulk, it can easily come in throughout the battle to paralyze opponents and just be a general nuisance. Since Nosepass will be putting up entry hazards on the opponent's field, a spinblocker is necessary to prevent your set-up from going to waste. Duskull makes a good spinblocker, having high defenses which makes it easy to switch in, and also access to Will-O-Wisp to prevent any Pursuit users from taking it out, and generally crippling physical threats that may hurt the team.</p>"

But if opposing Pokemon that resist or are immune to Normal-type attacks have been removed, Skitty can be quite difficult to stop. While Skitty is a fun Pokemon to use, for the most part it is outclassed by other priority users such as Croagunk, Aipom, Meowth, and Glameow, all of whom have better stats across the board. Basically, Skitty is just another fun Normal-type that is unlikely to see any real competitive use.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Skitty has some interesting options to support its team with. Heal Bell can be used over Baton Pass in the last moveslot to de-status your team, and Wish can be useful in healing and increasing the longevity of your team.

Other counters include Rock- or Steel-type Pokemon such as Aron, Bronzor, Onix, and Magnemite. If Skitty is not running Normalize, then treat it like you would with any other weak Normal-type.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Priority attacks are one of the most valuable resources in Little Cup, and Skitty is one of the only Pokemon in the game that has STAB on two: Fake Out and Sucker Punch. Fake Out is simply a great move for racking up free damage on the opponent while they can do nothing back, and Sucker Punch is very effective due to the offensive nature of Little Cup, very often giving Skitty the first hit on Pokemon trying to harm it. Not to mention that with STAB, Sucker Punch's Base Power is a massive 120.</p> <p>Return is Skitty's most powerful attack and should be used when a priority attack is either not needed (i.e. if the target is slower), or not strong enough (i.e. the target is still healthy). Baton Pass may seem odd at first glance simply because Skitty isn't boosting any of it stats, but it is invaluable in that it allows Skitty to scout for Pokemon that trouble it, and immediately switch out, giving good offensive momentum. Thunder Wave is a good option on Skitty because it is the only Pokemon that can paralyze Gligar with a 100% accurate move. It also lets Skitty cripple Rock- or Steel-type switch-ins; Rock Polish Aron, in particular, will have very little success sweeping when it is paralyzed.</p> <p>To illustrate the power of Skitty's attacks, here are some damage calculations:</p> <ul> <li>Life Orb Fake Out + Sucker Punch vs. 0/0 Gligar: 69.6% - 86.9%</li> <li>Life Orb Fake Out + Sucker Punch vs. 0/0 Houndour: 133.3% - 166.7%</li> <li>Life Orb Fake Out + Return vs. 236/36 Munchlax: 75.7% - 97%</li> <li>Life Orb Fake Out + Sucker Punch vs. 36/36 Machop: 95.9% - 120.9%</li> </ul> <p>Life Orb is the best option on this set simply because Skitty will not be living very long due to its poor defenses, so it should be trying to get as much damage in as possible. Silk Scarf is also a very viable option, as because all of Skitty's attacks are Normal-type, it gives them all a 1.2x boost, and doesn't inflict any recoil damage.</p> <p>Obviously, Skitty is one Pokemon that requires a lot of support to make it work due to its non-existant coverage. Pokemon with Pursuit help a great deal because they can trap and kill Ghost-types who are immune to Skitty's attacks. Good users of Pursuit include Munchlax, Stunky, and Houndour, all of which are great options. Steel- and Rock-types also pose a big threat to Skitty as they both resist Normal-type attacks. Diglett works pretty well thanks to its ability to trap and KO most of them with a fast, powerful STAB Earthquake. Magnemite can be utilized to deal with Levitate Bronzor.</p>"

Howl is another option on Electrike because it has decent Attack and above-average Speed, along with access to a physical priority move in Quick Attack and good coverage with the elemental fangs.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Chinchou is probably the best counter to Electrike because it can easily switch in on Electrike's two main moves, and Hidden Power Ground can be easily predicted and taken advantage of. Dragon-types, such as Dratini and Bagon, are also especially threatening to Electrike, as they also resist its two main attacks and can set up on Electrike by using Dragon Dance.</p>",

      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Electrike can be a potent Choice attacker with its good Special Attack and decent Speed. Thunderbolt is Electrike's best STAB move, and is the main attacking option on this set. Being locked into an Electric-type attack can be trouble, however, particularly if your opponent has a Pokemon that is immune to Ground, such as Gligar. Flamethrower is a good option on this set mainly because it can hit Bronzor, one of the best defensive Pokemon in the game, for super effective damage. It also provides decent neutral coverage on the Pokemon that Thunderbolt can't hit. When choosing between Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Ground, you need to consider which Pokemon are a greater threat to your team. Hidden Power Ice OHKOes Gligar and hits other Ground-types who would otherwise be able to beat Electrike, such as Hippopotas and Phanpy, hard. Hidden Power Ground hits Electric-types, such as Chinchou and other Electrike, who could otherwise switch in on a resisted Thunderbolt. Note that if you choose to use Hidden Power Ground, Electrike needs 240 to maximize its Special Attack, so you have to sacrifice the extra point in HP.</p> <p>Switcheroo is a fun move that can put the opponent in trouble if played correctly. If Electrike manages to switch items at the right time, it can give another Pokemon a free turn to possibly set up and sweep a team. An example of this would be if Electrike is about to take a Gligar's Earthquake, it could quickly Switheroo a Choice item onto it, locking it into Earthquake. This could give a free turn to your own Gligar to come in, use Agility, and sweep your opponent's team. Switcheroo is slightly less valuable with Choice Scarf because many Pokemon won't really mind; in fact, many Pokemon enjoy the boost in a Speed-centralized metagame such as Little Cup. However, it is possible to Switcheroo faster with Choice Scarf, which can be the difference between getting the Switcheroo off and not managing to do so. Switcherooing Choice Specs is nice because it can put physical attackers in a bad position, locking them into attacks while boosting their useless Special Attack.</p> <p>One of the best checks to special attackers in Little Cup is Munchlax. But with Switcheroo, Munchlax is no longer a safe switch-in to Electrike. This means it is one of the few special attackers in the game that can beat Munchlax, which sets it apart from other special attackers out there.</p> <p>Mantyke and Diglett used alongside Electrike can work very well. An Electrike spamming Thunderbolt is likely to draw out two types of Pokemon: Ground-types and Electric-types. Diglett does very well against the latter, trapping them and hitting them with STAB super effective Earthquake. Diglett can also trap and either kill or weaken Munchlax, who would stop a sweep by either Mantyke or Electrike. Once the Electric-type has been removed, this frees up either Mantyke or Electrike for a sweep. If a Ground-type is lured out, Mantyke can easily switch in and set up an Agility. If both Electric- and Ground-types have been removed, Electrike will have an easy time sweeping as well.</p> <p>One sweeper that also benefits greatly from Electrike is Agility Gligar. Electrike can take out two of Gligar's primary counters, Mantyke and Snover, with Thunderbolt and Flamethrower, respectively. Electrike also invites Ground-type attacks, which can let Gligar get in for free if you predict correctly. Likewise, Electrike can give Gligar a free turn of set up if it Switcheroos on a Ground-type attack or non-attacking move.</p>"

Every sweeper appreciates entry hazards, but they are almost a necessity for Gulpin because it is weak even with maximum Special Attack. Chimchar is a good choice, as it is able to not only set up Stealth Rock reliably as a lead but also hit Steel-types super effectively.

Additionally, it has access to STAB priority in Aqua Jet, which is a godsend in the Little Cup metagame. Although Carvanha is very powerful offensively, it is incredibly weak defensively. Carvanha's paper-thin defenses are usually its Achilles' heel, and Croagunk easily shuts down Carvanha's rampage.

    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Because Carvanha is so offensively versatile, there are quite a few changes for it, outside of the listed sets. It has access to Rain Dance, but it really isn't bulky enough to set it up. Payback might look like a decent option on the Subvanha set, having higher power than Crunch if Carvanha goes second. However, Carvanha likes going first so it can deal damage (and hopefully KO) before being touched. Screech is actually a viable option, as it can halve a switch-in's Defense. This effectively doubles Carvanha's Attack, meaning that Carvanha will be able to deal a lot more damage. Carvanha can also effectively run a Choice Band or Choice Specs set, but the Subvanha set is almost always better, since the freedom to switch attacks is incredibly vital for Carvanha. Finally, Carvanha can run an Agility set with Substitute, which allows Carvanha to beat Choice Scarf Gastly and Choice Scarf Gligar, two checks to most Carvanha. However, it would generally be inferior to the listed sets. A mixed set is very viable, as Carvanha can run a decent set with Hydro Pump, Aqua Jet, Ice Beam, and Crunch, but is generally inferior to the Subvanha set.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Despite Carvanha's offensive prowess, it has quite a few checks. One of the best checks to any of its sets is Snover, as it resists Water-type attacks and can KO or scare off Carvanha with Energy Ball. In addition, Snover summons a hailstorm as it enters the battle, which racks up the residual damage that Carvanha absolutely loathes. In fact, any Pokemon that resists Water and outspeeds Carvanha can be considered at least a decent check. Also, having entry hazards up works wonders when playing against it: as it is constantly switching in and out of the battle, having it lose health every time it switches in helps exponentially when playing against Carvanha. Choice Scarf Machop, with its decent bulk, can tank an Aqua Jet and threaten Carvanha directly with a super effective STAB Dynamic Punch, but only if Carvanha isn't behind a Substitute. If that's the case, Machop loses to a Zen Headbutt. Gligar, though weak to Water-type attacks, can revenge kill Carvanha with Earthquake, or can do a lot of damage with a Quick Attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<p>This is arguably Carvanha's most threatening set. Its ability to force switches makes it a perfect user of Substitute. The goal of this set is simple: come in on a Pokemon which will usually switch out of Carvanha, then put up a Substitute. With Carvanha's massive Attack stat, this shouldn't be much of a problem. Aqua Jet is STAB priority, and is a staple on this set. Crunch beats all Ghost-types that attempt to switch in; even the most bulky Duskull are easily KOed. When behind a Substitute, Carvanha beats any Croagunk thinking they can switch in for free with Zen Headbutt. However, if Croagunk is easily handled by the rest of the team, Waterfall can be used for a stronger Water-type STAB. An Adamant nature is vital, because Carvanha needs to hit as hard as possible. The EVs maximize Carvanha's Attack and Speed stats, and the remaining EVs are thrown into Defense and Special Defense. Carvanha can hit 19 HP with 0 HP IVs, and this is recommended in order to minimize Life Orb recoil.</p> <p>Pokemon that can take advantage of Carvanha's wallbreaking ability make great partners to this set. Wynaut is this moveset's number-one teammate, as it can use Encore to lock the opponent into a support move and then Tickle it. From there, Carvanha can put up \"free\" Substitutes. Wynaut can also effectively be used to remove a counter to Carvanha, such as the ever-annoying Croagunk. Elekid is another premier choice, because it can easily finish off teams weakened by Carvanha. Elekid has one of the highest Speed stats in the unboosted metagame, tied only by Voltorb and Diglett, and surpassed by none. Many Choice Scarf sweepers, such as Gligar, Gastly, and Mankey, can clean up teams nicely, and can easily pick off any Pokemon that Carvanha weakens. This Carvanha can also remove key threats on an opposing team, such as Croagunk, Ghost-types, and Hippopotas.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Carvanha, being the great sweeper it is, can also effectively run a Choice Scarf set. This makes Carvanha one of the best revenge killers in the game. The idea of this set is to come in when one of your teammates bites the dust, then pick the best move for the situation. Aqua Jet picks off faster, weakened threats, while Waterfall does a lot of damage to any Pokemon that does not resist it. Crunch is a secondary STAB move that KOes Gastly and Abra, and easily 2HKOes Choice Scarf Snover on the switch. With Stealth Rock, Carvanha has a 25% chance of OHKOing Snover on the switch. Also, Zen Headbutt picks off all Machop and, if Carvanha wins the Speed tie against Choice Scarf versions, Mankey. Additionally, Zen Headbutt OHKOes all Croagunk that expect a Water-type attack on the switch in. The Choice Scarf enables Carvanha to be a great revenge killer, and with a Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment, it hits 25 Speed, easily outpacing all non-Choice Scarf Pokemon as well as slower Choice Scarf users. The remaining EVs maximize Carvanha's Attack, and the rest are thrown into Carvanha's defenses.</p> <p>The best teammates this Carvanha can ask for are Pokemon that can effectively remove Croagunk from the opponent's team. Gligar and Bronzor are ideal options for completing this task, as they can both OHKO Croagunk with their super effective STAB attacks (Earthquake or Aerial Ace in the former's case, and Psychic in the latter's). Wynaut is another good response to Croagunk, as it can trap and kill it thanks to Shadow Tag. After Croagunk has been removed from the game, this Carvanha should have little trouble sweeping through teams.</p>"

  "Wailmer": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Wailmer fills two somewhat unique niches in Little Cup: the ability to use Water Spout and the ability to use Self-Destruct. Wailmer is one of three Pokemon who can use Water Spout in Little Cup, and its decent Speed with a Choice Scarf attached and its overall bulk makes it a good user of the move. Relying on Water Spout, however, means that Wailmer needs to be at full HP to be effective, so it cannot switch in very often. Self-Destruct can help remedy this problem, and with a Choice Scarf Wailmer usually has a chance to use it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Wailmer only has one viable set and that is the Choice Scarf set. Rest has potential with Wailmer's huge HP and can boost Water Spout back to full power, but relying on Sleep Talk and hoping not to take a hit while sleeping is a big risk. A Choice Specs set can have some merits, but Wailmer is too slow to pull it off well. Wailmer can try to bluff Choice Scarf or Choice Specs by holding Wise Glasses, but once your opponent figures it out, Wailmer is nearly useless. Wailmer can also attempt try to abuse its mediocre speed in a Trick Room team.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Croagunk, Wooper, and Paras all have an immunity to Water-type attacks, making them immune to half of the set. Other Choice Scarf Pokemon can really dent Wailmer by taking away its powerful Water Spout and forcing it to use its weaker Water-type attacks. Focus Sash, priority, and resistances are always a big problem for the whale, since it will be locked into one move. Snover resists Wailmer's most powerful attack and can fight back with STAB Grass-type moves. Wynaut can revenge kill Wailmer easily.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Wailmer is one of the few Pokemon in Little Cup who has access to Water Spout, which can be the strongest Water-type attack depending on Wailmer's remaining HP. But with Wailmer's mediocre Speed, Water Spout loses a lot of its usefulness, since Wailmer could very well be low on health by the time it uses it. Equipping a Choice Scarf on Wailmer is the easiest solution, allowing it to outspeed every Pokemon in Little Cup who do not have a Choice Scarf or have raised their Speed in some other manner.</p> <p>Water Spout can OHKO many of the fragile Pokemon in Little Cup, and will usually be the attack of choice for Wailmer. However, Stealth Rock, priority, and opponents attacking can really eat up a lot of Wailmer's HP. Surf or Hydro Pump is therefore used as the second attack, ensuring that Wailmer will continue to hit hard even after its HP is low. Hydro Pump has plenty of power, but also has an accuracy of 80%. In such a fast paced metagame, accuracy can make all the difference. If you choose Surf, you do lose a lot of power, but you have perfect accuracy; the choice comes down to preference. Ice Beam allows Wailmer to take out Paras (who boasts an immunity to Water-type attacks) but it can also hurt other Grass-types, such as Treecko. In the last slot, Hidden Power Electric can be used to hit Mantyke, who is immune to Water attacks, and other Water-types. Hidden Power Ground can be used to try and KO Croagunk, who also has an immunity to Water Spout, and Chinchou. However, Hidden Power Ground does leave Wailmer helpless against Gligar, who can take that opportunity to set up. Self-Destruct is a great way to finish off a Wailmer counter, especially if Wailmer has taken too much damage and can't effectively use Water Spout any longer. However, if you are going to run Self-Destruct, move the HP EVs into Attack and go with a Hasty nature.</p> <p>Pokemon who are holding a Focus Sash are a major concern for Wailmer as it will not be able to OHKO them with Water Spout, allowing them to hit back and take away some of Wailmer's health. Having Stealth Rock support in conjunction with Wailmer is the best solution to this problem, as Stealth Rock also weakens other Pokemon and puts them into OHKO range. Snover is also a problem for this set since it can switch into all of Wailmer's attacks. Bronzor can handle Snover and set up Stealth Rock. Paras and Croagunk, who are both immune to Water-type attacks, can prove to be very big problems for Wailmer. A Diglett with Earthquake, Aerial Ace, and Sucker Punch can be a great way to trap and eliminate these Pokemon. Wynaut can also trap and eliminate Croagunk. Porygon makes a fantastic partner for Wailmer, as it can Ice Beam or Thunderbolt any Water- or Grass-types who resist Wailmer's STAB attacks.</p>"

  "Numel": {

    "overview": "<p>Numel has decent offensive stats, which are just enough to allow it to function well as a mixed attacker. Thanks to a unique ability, Simple, it can also become quite the terrifying sweeper as the receiver in a Baton Pass chain. However, while Numel is no slouch offensively, it does have low defenses, meaning it is quite easy to knock out. It is also weak to Water- and Ground-type attacks, which are incredibly common in the LC tier. Nonetheless, Numel, when given the correct support, can be beneficial to your team.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Numel is not the fastest Pokemon around, but it reaches 14 Speed, meaning that with a Choice Scarf, it will outspeed every Pokemon in the tier who are not holding a Choice Scarf themselves. Overheat is its most powerful STAB attack, and it should be used early-game to hurt and scout your opponent's switch-ins, even those who resist it. Fire Blast provides consistency, and is very useful for sweeping late-game when most of the opposing Pokemon are at low health. Earth Power provides secondary STAB, and hits Rock-type Pokemon that resist Fire Blast super effectively. Finally, Hidden Power Electric allows Numel to hit Mantyke for super effective damage, and also provides good general coverage alongside the other moves.</p> <p>Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast which exchanges power for accuracy, though the power drop is very noticeable and can often be disastrous for Numel. Simple is not used in this set because Numel is not taking advantage of it with stat boosts, and it results in -4 Special Attack each time Overheat is used. The EV spread maximizes Numel's Special Attack and Speed, with an extra 4 EVs in Special Attack to counter Hidden Power Electric's imperfect IV for it. Bulky special walls such as Munchlax will enjoy switching into Numel, and either damage it hard with Pursuit, or hit its switch-in hard with a STAB Return. Therefore, a powerful Fighting-type would benefit Numel. A good example is Choice Scarf Mankey, being able to scout with U-turn, as well as OHKOing Munchlax with Close Combat.</p> <p>Mantyke is a good teammate and has great synergy with Numel; Mantyke absorbs any Ground- and Water-type attacks aimed at Numel, while Numel is immune to Electric-type attacks which may be aimed at Mantyke. Mantyke and Numel are also great offensive wallbreaking partners. Gligar is also a great teammate, thanks to its ability to set up Stealth Rock, as well as scout the opponent's team with U-turn. Finally, Wynaut allows Numel to come in easier as Encore will force the opponent to repeat moves that do not threaten Numel in the slightest.</p>"

      "Trick Room Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With a Quiet nature and 3 Speed IVs, Numel hits 7 Speed, outspeeding almost every Pokemon in the tier under Trick Room. Fire Blast is its main STAB attack, and will hurt any Pokemon who does not resist it or not named Munchlax. Overheat is an even more powerful and accurate option, and is useful if you don't plan on keeping Numel in for too long. Earthquake is another powerful STAB move, and it gets great coverage alongside Fire Blast, resisted only by Mantyke and Wingull in the tier, both of which are weak to Hidden Power Electric hits. Finally, Return offers good neutral coverage, and hits most Pokemon who resist Fire Blast.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Numel's Attack and Special Attack, with its HP and Defense stats increased by one extra point. Slowpoke has good synergy with Numel, and can also set up Trick Room, making it an ideal teammate. Slowpoke also has access to Slack Off, allowing it to set up Trick Room multiple times throughout the battle. Bronzor is also a good teammate, having the bulk to set up Trick Room as well as Stealth Rock. Eevee is a good sweeping partner, because after Numel has heavily weakened the opponent's core, Eevee will be able to come in and sweep with STAB Return or Quick Attack. Howl may be used instead of Hidden Power Electric, because once set up, Numel is very hard to stop, and the power boost can be very useful to ensure the KO on bulky threats, especially Munchlax.</p> <h5>Checks and Counters</h5> <p>Numel is quite frail, so any Pokemon with a somewhat decent offensive stat can take on Numel. Pokemon such as Chinchou and Mantyke can easily switch into anything but Earth Power or Hidden Power Electric respectively, and begin firing off powerful STAB Hydro Pump. Water-types with Aqua Jet can easily come in on a Fire-type attack and take out Numel before it can attack. Gligar can easily switch in on a Ground-type attack, outspeed Numel, and OHKO it with Earthquake.</p>"

However, Spoink does have a lot more bulk compared to Abra, though it still isn't much, as well as access to a good ability in Thick Fat, which allows it to switch in much easier than Abra. To sum it up, Spoink is slightly outclassed by Abra, but has better defenses to make up for its lower Special Attack and Speed stats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Spoink has many other options in its movepool, but most are not viable for good reasons. Mirror Coat allows Spoink to reflect any special attacks aimed at it, and thanks to Spoink's above average Special Defense, it can take a few hits and reflect them. However, without reliable recovery, Mirror Coat will usually end up being a one-time-use only move. Confuse Ray can be used to have a chance of preventing the opposing Pokemon from attacking, but Spoink's frail physical bulk is a problem. Spoink can make use of Charge Beam to boost its Special Attack, while also damaging the opposing Pokemon in the process. Heal Bell can be used to clear its entire team of status, but again, its poor Defense stat means it will not be able to constantly switch in and use it. Magic Coat and Taunt can be used to reflect and block any status moves, respectively, but in most cases, the opponent will be attacking Spoink right off the bat. Toxic can be used, as Spoink tends to lure in Munchlax and other special walls, and cripple them. However, Trick is a more effective way of crippling them. Spoink can make use of an anti-lead set consisting of Psychic, Trick, Magic Coat, and Taunt, along with a Choice Scarf, allowing Spoink to cripple bulky leads. Finally, Spoink can set up Trick Room, hitting 9 Speed with 0 Speed IVs and a Quiet nature. Unfortunately, Spoink is frail, and won't be able to use Trick Room many times before it gets knocked out.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Stunky is the biggest enemy to Spoink, being immune to Psychic, resisting Shadow Ball, and not being weak to any of Spoink's other attacks (bar Hidden Power Ground). In return, Stunky has a powerful Sucker Punch to knock out Spoink if it chooses to attack, while running the risk of getting KOed by Pursuit if it switches out. Houndour plays similar to Stunky, but has the risk of getting severely injured by Hidden Power Fighting. However, if Spoink runs Hidden Power Fire, Houndour can easily set up a Substitute before sending Spoink on its way. Munchlax can defeat the Calm Mind variant, switching in on a Calm Mind, and hitting it hard with STAB Return, while not getting 2HKOed by even Hidden Power Fighting when accounting for Oran Berry. Pokemon with U-turn can switch in on a move they resist, and either hurt Spoink badly, or gain momentum for your team. Common users of U-turn include Meowth and Choice Scarf Mankey.</p>",

While Abra has access to Encore, Spoink can cripple the opposing Pokemon with Thunder Wave. Reflect and Light Screen are self-explanatory, reducing any damage dealt onto Spoink and its teammates by half, allowing its teammates to easily set up without harm. Psychic is Spoink's only attack, gains STAB, and is its best option to hurt opposing Pokemon.</p> <p>A Timid nature with maximum Speed is used so that Spoink may be more likely to set up dual screens before its opponent attacks, allowing it to reap that much more from it. Then, Spoink's HP stat is maximized to ensure it can take more hits, and the remaining EVs are put into Special Defense, increasing it by two points. Light Clay is the only viable item on the set, because it provides the dual screens with more longevity, allowing for more setup from Spoink's teammates. Thick Fat is used to allow Spoink to absorb Ice- and Fire-type attacks easier.</p> <p>Setup sweepers greatly benefit from the dual screens that Spoink provides. Aron, Gligar, and Mantyke can all become deadly sweepers behind the dual screens, setting up with ease, and being able to plow through the opposing team with little effort. Gligar has the added benefit of having access to Baton Pass, which allows Gligar to pass Attack and Speed boosts to a Pokemon like Machop, that isn't able to boost its stats itself, in order to make it a deadly sweeper.</p>"

      "Choice": {

If Spoink holds Choice Specs, it boosts Spoink's Special Attack stat to 24, hitting much harder with all its attacks. Psychic is Spoink's main attack, gaining STAB, and hitting opponents who don't resist it quite hard. Shadow Ball hits opposing Psychic-types who resist Spoink's main attack. The next slot is completely up to preference. If Aron is troublesome to the team, Hidden Power Fighting should be used, while Hidden Power Fire should be used if Bronzor is causing problems. The last moveslot should be Trick, which allows Spoink to cripple switch-ins such as Munchlax, who would otherwise switch in with ease, and dispose of Spoink with Pursuit.</p> <p>The item choice depends on what your team needs. If your team is lacking a revenge killer, Spoink can fill the job with a Choice Scarf. If your team needs more hard hitters, Spoink can hold a Choice Specs, and devastate opponents with attacks that hit surprisingly hard. Thick Fat is used to allow Spoink to have more opportunities to switch in, as it is relatively frail without EV investment. A Timid nature allows Spoink to outspeed as many opponents as possible, while Modest can be used for more power. The EV spread maximizes Spoink's Special Attack and Speed stats, and increases it's HP stat by two. Thick Fat is especially important on this set, because Spoink will be switching in and out often, and being able to take less from certain attacks really helps it perform its job well.</p> <p>Since Dark-type Pokemon with Pursuit are common switch-ins to Spoink, a Pokemon who can set up on those Dark-types is helpful. Common switch-ins include Stunky, who can checkmate Spoink with Pursuit. A good teammate is Aron, who doesn't mind any of Stunky's attacks, and can proceed to set up Rock Polish. Other teammates include powerful Fighting-types such as Choice Scarf Mankey, who can switch in after Spoink, and either use Close Combat to knock out the Dark-type, or U-turn to gain momentum.</p>"

After just one Calm Mind boost, Spoink hits 24 Special Attack and 22 Special Defense, meaning it can hit quite hard, while also being able to withstand many special attacks with its above average Special Defense stat. Psychic is Spoink's main attack, gaining STAB, and hitting most opponents quite hard, especially after several Calm Mind boosts. The next slot is used to hit Steel-type Pokemon, who would otherwise wall this set, super effectively. Hidden Power Fighting has great neutral coverage with Psychic, hitting all Pokemon for at least neutral damage bar opposing Psychic-types, and OHKOes Aron, who could otherwise set up a Rock Polish before taking Spoink out with Head Smash. Hidden Power Fire is also an option to hit Steel-types, and hits Bronzor, who does not have much to fear from any of Spoink's other attacks, particularly hard. Finally, Shadow Ball allows Spoink to hit opposing Psychic-type Pokemon for super effective damage. Substitute is also an option instead of Shadow Ball, allowing Spoink to scout for opposing Pokemon, especially Pokemon faster than Spoink, who would otherwise be able to OHKO Spoink before it can switch out or attack.</p> <p>Spoink has a plethora of items it can run. Oran Berry gives Spoink more longevity, and often allows it to set up another Calm Mind before putting the hurt on its opponents. Life Orb trades longevity for power, making Spoink much easier to knock out, but also much harder to wall. If Substitute is opted for the last slot, Salac Berry becomes an option. With Substitute, Spoink can safely activate Salac Berry, and proceed to outspeed Pokemon who are usually faster than it, and KO them with the appropriate move. However, at 25% health, Spoink becomes very easy to knock out by priority attacks, which are rife in the metagame, and so it is not recommended. The EV spread maximizes Spoink's Special Attack and Speed stats, and increases its HP and Special Defense by one point each. A Timid nature allows Spoink to hit 16 Speed, which is slightly above average. A Modest nature can also be used, trading the ability to outrun certain threats for more power, but is usually not worth it given the extremely fast-paced nature of Little Cup. Thick Fat is again used because being able to take Fire- and Ice-type attacks better are very important for Spoink.</p> <p>If Spoink lacks Hidden Power Fire in its movepool, Bronzor will have an easy time against Spoink, so Magnemite then becomes a good teammate, thanks to Magnet Pull. Magnemite can trap Bronzor and take it out with a powerful STAB Thunderbolt. With Bronzor eliminated, Spoink will find it much easier to sweep. As an added bonus, Magnemite also resists all of Spoink's weaknesses. If Hidden Power Fire is absent, Aron will be able to set up a Rock Polish against Spoink, and eliminate it with a Head Smash. Therefore, a Bronzor of your own makes a fine teammate, resisting or being immune to any of Aron's attacks, and being able to dispose of Aron with Earthquake.</p>"

It's the only Pokemon in Little Cup that is immune to the effects of sandstorm that isn't a Rock-, Ground-, or Steel-type and isn't named Cleffa. Not only that, but Cacnea can become one of the most threatening Swords Dance sweepers in LC, as it boasts the strongest priority move in the game (tying with Extreme Speed), Sucker Punch, and has a solid movepool to back it up. Unfortunately, that's where the praise is cut short. Cacnea is really hindered by its low Speed and frail defenses. What really hurts it is not sharing a Dark-type to have a STAB Sucker Punch, unlike its evolution, Cacturne. Aside from this, its ability is only useful if it is used on the same team as Hippopotas, meaning you're forced to use up a team slot to take advantage of it.</p> <p>Through it all, Cacnea still comes out as a worthwhile Pokemon, and is a potent threat, with a good helping of prediction and a side of luck. Consider using it if you need a good Grass-type with priority and already have sleep support on a teammate, or if you are using Hippopotas. If you don't already have sleep support on a teammate, Cacnea's role is somewhat challenged by Bellsprout, who has slightly less power, but has access to the ever useful Sleep Powder. They do have separate abilities and typing that set them apart, however. All in all, Cacnea is a solid Grass-type Pokemon who can pull off a few interesting roles.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Cacnea can utilize Choice Band and Choice Specs to further boost its excellent offensive stats, allowing it to dish out an immense amount of damage to the majority of Pokemon. If you decide to run a Choice set, it comes down to power and coverage. Choice Band Cacnea has stronger attacks to work with then a Choice Specs set, as it can use physical attacking moves such as Brick Break, Sucker Punch, Return, and Seed Bomb to hit a variety of Pokemon for respectable damage. However, Choice Band Cacnea misses out on Hidden Power to broaden its range of attack types, and being locked into Sucker Punch gives the opponent a chance to set up. When using Choice Specs, Cacnea has access to moves such as Dark Pulse, Energy Ball, and a Hidden Power type of your choice. In general, it will be difficult to pull off a successful Choice Band or Specs set, since Cacnea's middling Speed and lackluster defenses will hinder its effectiveness greatly.</p> <p>A combination of Destiny Bond, Endure, and Salac Berry can be used to great effectiveness. Even though it may be difficult to pull off, it's still a very threatening combination that can easily down one of your opponent's Pokemon. By mastering this strategy, it's almost guaranteed that Cacnea will be able to KO one or sometimes two of the opponent's Pokemon.</p> <p>Cacnea can become a very potent special threat with Nasty Plot. It has access to strong moves such as Energy Ball and Dark Pulse, and it can definitely put the hurt on many Pokemon. However, Nasty Plot Cacnea is almost always going to be inferior to Swords Dance Cacnea. This is because Cacnea has much better physical attacks to abuse, including the ever so helpful Sucker Punch, while Cacnea only boasts Energy Ball, Dark Pulse, and Hidden Power for special attacks. That is not to say Cacnea can't use Nasty Plot though. With Substitute and sandstorm support, Cacnea can inflict heavy damage upon its foes.</p> <p>Another way Cacnea can utilize Nasty Plot is by using it with Sucker Punch. By using a mixed set with Nasty Plot, Energy Ball, Hidden Power Fire, and Sucker Punch, Cacnea can become a pretty dangerous sweeping force. Having access to an 80 Base Power priority move definitely helps against faster foes, while Energy Ball and Hidden Power Fire provide excellent coverage. The only reason this set is not seeing much usage is because Houndour and Croagunk generally outclass it with their own Nasty Plot mix sets, as they both have a STAB on their priority attacks and a better movepool to work with.</p> <p>Cacnea is one of the few Pokemon who can use Spikes in Little Cup. With Spikes, Cacnea can fit into a stall-oriented team, providing residual damage for the team. With Sand Veil and sandstorm in play, Cacnea can set up Spikes relatively well. Cacnea can also use Leech Seed to further frustrate your opponent, but bulkier Grass-types tend to do this better, such as Shroomish and Turtwig. Drain Punch can be used as Cacnea's Fighting-type move on the Mixed set or Mixed Scarf set. With Drain Punch, Cacnea loses power; however, it recovers HP equal to half of the damage Cacnea has dealt to the opponent's Pokemon. Lastly, with Counter and Focus Sash, Cacnea can make an effective Pokemon in the lead position, having a chance to knock out any lead that is physically based.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Without Hidden Power Ice, Gligar stops Cacnea in its tracks, as Gligar can withstand its common physical moves of Seed Bomb and Sucker Punch thanks to its naturally high Defense, respectable HP, and ability to heal off any damage taken with Roost. Gligar can then proceed to dispose of Cacnea with a STAB Aerial Ace. If Gligar lacks Aerial Ace, it fails to be such an immediate threat, but it can deal solid damage with Stone Edge and even Earthquake. Similarly, without Hidden Power Fire, Croagunk proves to be quite bothersome, as it resists the majority of moves Cacnea is seen using, such as Seed Bomb, Sucker Punch, and Brick Break. In addition, Croagunk can make quick work of Cacnea with Ice Punch, which strikes it super effectively.</p> <p>Houndour resists Sucker Punch and Seed Bomb and can threaten Cacnea with Fire Blast. However, Houndour must be wary of Brick Break and Focus Punch, both of which can OHKO Houndour. Snover is not exactly a counter, but it can get rid of the sandstorm that is usually paired up with Cacnea, thanks to its ability, Snow Warning, which summons a permanent hailstorm. In addition, Snover can threaten it with STAB Ice Shard if Cacnea is not behind its Substitute</p> <p>Duskull can stop Cacnea cold, especially if it lacks Seed Bomb. Duskull's excellent Defense, immunity to Focus Punch, and access to Will-O-Wisp to cripple Cacnea make it a great a Pokemon to combat it. Although Sucker Punch hits Duskull super effectively, it will only work if Duskull attempts to hit Cacnea with one of its damaging attacks. Duskull doesn't need to directly attack Cacnea as it can easily reduce Cacnea's power with Will-O-Wisp and proceed to stall out its Sucker Punch with relative ease. Drifloon can switch in on a Focus Punch thanks to its immunity to Fighting-type moves, and proceed to set up Substitute as Cacnea uses Sucker Punch. On a similar note, Duskull can also burn as Cacnea attempts to strike it with Sucker Punch; however, Duskull is not the best switch-in, as it does not resist Seed Bomb like Drifloon does.</p> <p>Pokemon who have a Choice Scarf (or are faster than Cacnea) and can work around Sucker Punch make decent checks to Cacnea. For example, Magby can use Mach Punch to avoid being hit by Sucker Punch and resists Seed Bomb, Stunky is resistant to both Sucker Punch and Seed Bomb and can hit Cacnea with a powerful Crunch, and Machop also resists Sucker Punch and can destroy Cacnea with Dynamic Punch. Do note, however, that all of the aforementioned checks will take heavy damage from Focus Punch, assuming Cacnea is behind its Substitute.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Cacnea is one of the most threatening Swords Dance sweepers in LC since it has access to Sucker Punch, the strongest priority move in the game. After one Swords Dance, Cacnea's already great Attack stat is boosted to a sky-high 38, allowing it to fire off deadly attacks that can OHKO many LC Pokemon.</p> <p>Sucker Punch should never to be underestimated even without the STAB boost; Cacnea has two other options to choose from for the third slot: Focus Punch and Seed Bomb. The choice of secondary attacking move is dependent on your final move. If you select Substitute then Focus Punch is the preferred move as it is more powerful and provides better coverage than Seed Bomb, and it gives Cacnea a shield to ensure Focus Punch hits. It's also very helpful should your opponent try to out-stall Cacnea's Sucker Punch PP, as it gives you the perfect opportunity to set up Substitute. On the other hand, if you select Encore, then Seed Bomb should be used. This is because Encore doesn't provide a shield like Substitute does, so Focus Punch tends to be a riskier option. Swords Dance, Encore, and Sucker Punch are also a ridiculously good trio. If your opponent even thinks about stalling out Sucker Punch's PP, they'll be hit with Encore, easily giving you a free Swords Dance boost as they are forced to switch out. If they attempt to avoid Encore by attacking, they will be hit by Sucker Punch. Either way, Cacnea is always going to be in a win-win situation with either Substitute or Encore, so it's really up to personal preference.</p> <p>The items listed are also going to be determined by your chosen moveset. If you opt to use Substitute, Oran Berry is the primary item as it lets Cacnea potentially set up without being at 1 HP afterwards or gives it more chances to fish for a miss due to Sand Veil (while a sandstorm is in effect), which gives it the chance to set up a Substitute. Focus Sash is suggested if you are using Encore, as Substitute renders your Focus Sash useless. If you do decide to use Focus Sash then it also guarantees Cacnea at least one Swords Dance boost, as long as entry hazards are not present. Even though Oran Berry and Focus Sash are the preferred items, Life Orb can also be useful. With Life Orb, Cacnea's attacks are powered up by 30%, making it a much larger offensive threat. This gives Sucker Punch that extra kick to OHKO Pokemon such as Porygon, Paras, and Wailmer, assuming Cacnea has used Swords Dance and Stealth Rock is on the field.</p> <p>Since Cacnea has the ability Sand Veil, Hippopotas' sandstorm can be used to take advantage of the evasion boost so it can Swords Dance or Substitute easier. When it comes to sweeping, Duskull can stop Cacnea cold if it lacks Seed Bomb. Duskull's amazing Defense, immunity to Focus Punch, and access to Will-O-Wisp will scare off Cacnea with ease. Sucker Punch will be useless against it, as Duskull generally won't bother to attack Cacnea. To deal with Duskull, Houndour is by far the most effective counter, absorbing Will-O-Wisp for added fire power and destroying it with Dark Pulse or Fire Blast. Speaking of Houndour, if Cacnea lacks Focus Punch, Houndour can easily switch into Sucker Punch, Seed Bomb, or Swords Dance and eliminate it. Munchlax is a great switch-in to Houndour, thanks to its Fire-type resistance due to Thick Fat, great overall bulk, and access to super effective Earthquake. Croagunk will always be a troublesome threat no matter which attack Cacnea decides to use, as it is resistant to all of them. It's best to pack a Pokemon who can dispose of Croagunk, or Cacnea will have a hard time sweeping. Diglett and Gligar are both excellent options, the former trapping it because of Arena Trap and finishing it off with Earthquake, while the latter switching into almost anything Croagunk uses (excluding Ice Punch) and destroying it with Earthquake.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>While Cacnea is typically seen either running Swords Dance or Substitute and Focus Punch, this set is an excellent alternative, allowing Cacnea to make use of its remarkable Attack and Special Attack stats to dish out respectable amounts of damage to a number of Pokemon.</p> <p>Sucker Punch is Cacnea's main attack, compensating for Cacnea's low base Speed and dealing a respectable amount of damage to most Pokemon. Brick Break provides excellent coverage alongside Sucker Punch, hitting Munchlax and Steel-types, such as Aron and Shieldon. The choice between Seed Bomb or Energy Ball depends if you'd rather hit physically weak Pokemon such as Mantyke, or specially weak Pokemon such as Gligar. If you have no preference, Energy Ball is the best choice as it has a 10% chance to lower the opponent's Special Defense by one stage. Hidden Power Ice is Cacnea's best way to dispose of Gligar, but Hidden Power Fire has better overall coverage and can strike Croagunk, who otherwise resists most of Cacnea's moves.</p> <p>Life Orb is the preferred item because its 30% power boost offers Cacnea the ability to OHKO many Pokemon it otherwise wouldn't be able to. The EV spread is rather simple. With 156 Attack and 76 Special Attack EVs, Cacnea reaches 17 Attack and 16 Special Attack, enough for it to have a shot at 2HKOing max HP/min Def Munchlax with Brick Break and score a 2HKO on Croagunk with Hidden Power Fire. With max Speed, Cacnea is capable of reaching a Speed stat of 14, just enough to tie with neutral nature Croagunk.</p> <p>With sandstorm support, Cacnea's evasion will increase by 20% and it will cause plenty of grief for your opponent. For this reason, Hippopotas pairs up well with Cacnea, as it summons permanent sandstorm with its ability Sand Stream. In addition, Hippopotas can provide Stealth Rock support, helping Cacnea sweep. When it comes to sweeping, Gligar can potentially stop Cacnea in its tracks if it lacks Hidden Power Ice, and dispose of Cacnea with Aerial Ace. If Cacnea lacks Hidden Power Fire, Croagunk will prove bothersome as it resists the majority of Cacnea's moveset, and can strike Cacnea with a super effective Ice Punch. Slowpoke can dispose of the aforementioned Gligar with a STAB Surf and Slowpoke also pairs up with Cacnea well, type-wise, since they both resist each other's weaknesses. To deal with Croagunk, pairing Cacnea with a Pokemon who can handle it, such as Duskull or Gligar, is recommended. Gligar threatens Croagunk with a super effective Earthquake, while Duskull can reduce Croagunk's Attack with Will-O-Wisp, making it much more manageable.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Cacnea's excellent offensive stats are often offset by its mediocre Speed. Luckily Cacnea can get 14 Speed, so with a Choice Scarf Cacnea becomes a potent revenge killer who can outpace all other non Choice Scarfed Pokemon.</p> <p>Unlike the other sets, Dark Pulse is chosen over Sucker Punch, as Cacnea can reliably dispose of Pokemon such as non-Choice Scarf Gastly thanks to the increase in Speed. Brick Break is vital on this set as it hits Pokemon like Houndour who would otherwise wall this set. Brick Break also allows Cacnea to strike the likes of Munchlax and Steel-types such as Aron and Shieldon for super effective damage. Cacnea has two options for a STAB move: Needle Arm and Seed Bomb. Although Needle Arm has 20 less Base Power than Seed Bomb, it has a handy 30% chance to flinch your opponent. Hidden Power Ice is preferred over Hidden Power Fire in the last slot, as it allows Cacnea to strike the ever so common Gligar, who would otherwise stop Cacnea cold. However, Hidden Power Fire has the benefit of hitting Croagunk and Bronzor for super effective damage, making it decent option over Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p>With sandstorm in play, Cacnea becomes very frustrating for your opponent to take down. Hippopotas makes a great teammate for Cacnea, as it provides it with sandstorm support, activating Cacnea's ability, Sand Veil. Hippopotas can also set up Stealth Rock, allowing Cacnea to turn some 2HKOes into OHKOes. Houndour is troublesome for this set, as it can come in on a locked Seed Bomb or Dark Pulse, and dispose of Cacnea with either Pursuit as it switches out, or a STAB Fire-type move if Cacnea stays in. Munchlax is a great switch-in against Houndour, as it resist Houndour's Fire-type moves thanks to Thick Fat, while threatening Houndour with a super effective Earthquake. If it's not using Hidden Power Ice, Gligar will prove troublesome, as it can shrug off Cacnea's attacks and can OHKO with Aerial Ace. For this reason, pairing up Cacnea with a Pokemon who can handle Gligar is recommended. Slowpoke is an excellent teammate, as it can handle Gligar with STAB Surf, and has good synergy type-wise with Cacnea. Without Hidden Power Fire, Cacnea is more vulnerable to Croagunk, meaning you should have a way to handle it. For this reason, pairing Cacnea up with a Pokemon such as Gligar or Duskull can help, as they both handle Croagunk well. Duskull can burn Croagunk with Will-O-Wisp to reduce its Attack, and can stall out Croagunk's Sucker Punch. Gligar can dispose of the aforementioned Croagunk with a STAB Earthquake, making it a good teammate alongside Cacnea.</p>"

  "Swablu": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>The bad news is that Swablu is another one of those Normal / Flying-types that are so common in the game we call Pokemon. The good news is that Swablu is different from its fellow Normal / Flying-types. Unlike Doduo, Taillow, and company, Swablu is focused more defensively than offensively. Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing is a matter of opinion, but it gives Swablu a nice little niche (although the little cotton bird still has nothing on Munchlax and Gligar when it comes to defense). Natural Cure should also be noted, as it allows Swablu to be one of the best status absorbers in Little Cup.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Heal Bell can be used to heal the status of team members, but Swablu itself hardly needs it since it has Natural Cure. Speaking of which, Rest can work well with Natural Cure, as Swablu will lose the sleep condition when it switches out, but Roost is usually superior. Haze can remove stat boosts from the opponent, and Substitute can protect Swablu from status. Perish Song is an interesting option, being able to put a Pokemon's sweep on a timer or force the opponent to switch, thus racking up entry hazard damage. Sing is horribly inaccurate, but can be used to put one of Swablu's counters out of play.</p> <p>If you are feeling bold, you can try running Swablu as a sweeper. Agility can boost its Speed, and Dragon Pulse gets great coverage with Heat Wave. Hidden Power Ground or Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit Chinchou for super effective damage, while Return can be used for Normal-type STAB. Lastly, if you are feeling more adventurous, you can use Power Swap to hopefully steal an opponent's stat boosts.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Aside from being an excellent teammate, Chinchou is an excellent counter, since it resists Pluck, Heat Wave, and Ice Beam. It can then use Thunderbolt or Ice Beam to devastate Swablu. Chinchou will hate getting hit with Toxic, however. Taillow and Teddiursa can take advantage of Toxic to activate Guts and Quick Feet respectively, and proceed to hit hard with Facade. Pure Poison-types in general fare well against Swablu due to their immunity to Toxic. Koffing is exceptionally good, since it can hit Swablu with Thunderbolt or Ice Beam.</p>",

      "King Cotton (Physically Defensive)": {
        "description": "<p>If you are using Swablu, this is the best set to run. It's also probably the only set you should ever run. Roost is the heart of this set as it gives Swablu a reliable form of recovery, and eliminates its Rock-, Electric-, and Ice-type weaknesses. Swablu is usually too slow to take advantage of this, however. Pluck is not only useful for STAB, but it also has the bonus effect of eating the opponents' Oran Berries, which can reduce their survivability as well as increasing your own. Protect works well with Toxic, allowing Swablu to inflict more poison damage over a period of time. This is especially useful considering Swablu has rather poor attacking stats. Of course, you can always run Toxic without Protect and try to stall your opponent with just Roost. Heat Wave hits Steel-types like Bronzor super effectively, while Ice Beam hits Rock- and Ground-types and OHKOs most Gligar.</p> <p>Oran Berry is useful for recovering a large amount of HP at one time. However, Leftovers works well with Protect and Roost, allowing Swablu to regain HP over a period of time. It also helps Swablu counteract sandstorm and hail's passive damage. A Relaxed nature should only be used over an Impish one if you are running Ice Beam or Heat Wave. If you want Swablu to take special hits better, you can run a Careful or Sassy nature to increase its Special Defense.</p> <p>Swablu loves having entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field and not having them on its side. This makes Pineco an extremely good teammate for Swablu, as it can set up Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, and can use Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock. Baltoy and Kabuto can also use both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin. Omanyte can use both Stealth Rock and Spikes, and Tentacool possesses both Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spin. Using Pokemon with two entry hazards or an entry hazard and Rapid Spin can be extremely helpful when trying to save space on a team. Chinchou makes an excellent partner for Swablu, since it can switch in on Electric- and Ice-type moves. It can even threaten Rock-types with STAB Hydro Pump or Surf, giving it offensive as well as defensive synergy.</p> <p>Swablu can also benefit from hail and sandstorm, since the residual damage from entry hazards, weather, and Toxic will stack up very quickly. Hippopotas and Snover deserve a mention as teammates because of this. Lileep resists Electric-type moves, and its bulk in sandstorm and Swablu's natural defenses make an annoying combination. Spheal can work in hail, but both Spheal and Swablu have a weakness to Rock- and Electric-type moves.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Barboach can be a very dangerous Pokemon in Little Cup with access to Dragon Dance, excellent STABs, very good defensive typing, and decent defensive stats. While its attacking stats are rather low compared to other sweepers in Little Cup, it can still sweep effectively with a very nice attacking movepool, over 21 Speed with Choice Scarf, and Dragon Dance.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>On the Physical Choice set, running a Jolly nature instead of an Adamant one is an option; however, in most cases Barboach prefers the boost in power to the boost in Speed. The same principle applies for the Special Choice set, which can run a Timid nature as opposed to a Modest one. On the Special Choice set, there are a variety of other Hidden Power types to use, such as Electric, which hits Mantyke harder than Ice Beam; Fire, which hits Snover 4x super effectively; and Rock, which hits both Mantyke and Snover super effectively at the cost less damage on one. For Barboach to be an effective Choice sweeper early-game, Choice Band and Choice Specs can be used on the Physical and Special Choice sets respectively as they provide much more power than Choice Scarf; however, in the Speed-centralized metagame that is Little Cup, Choice Scarf is nearly always the better option.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>There are few Pokemon that can counter all of Barboach's sets effectively. One that does a very good job would be Mantyke, as it is immune to Barboach's dual STABs and can hit it back hard with a STAB Hydro Pump. Other good counters are Choice Scarf users that are faster than a Barboach at +1 Speed, such as Mankey (who can OHKO Barboach with Close Combat), Gligar, and Gastly.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Despite Barboach's low Attack stat, it has a way of boosting it, along with its Speed, in what is arguably the best set-up move in the game: Dragon Dance. After a single Dragon Dance, Barboach's Attack is increased to a respectable 21, and its Speed is boosted to 22 with an Adamant nature or 24 with a Jolly nature, outpacing all unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup. Barboach has two great STAB moves in Earthquake and Waterfall, hitting most Pokemon in Little Cup for at least neutral damage, bar Grass-types and Mantyke. Return provides neutral coverage on all the Pokemon whom Waterfall and Earthquake can't hit. Oran Berry is the preferred item for this set, giving Barboach the bulk that it needs to set up consistently, without sacrificing too much HP in the process. However, Life Orb is also a viable option for the added power, particularly late-game with Wynaut support. When choosing between Adamant and Jolly nature, you must consider whether you prefer added power or higher survivability. While Adamant gives you one extra point in Attack, Jolly allows you to outspeed more Choice Scarf users after one Dragon Dance, such as Bagon and Krabby, and lets you outspeed or tie Choice Scarf Cranidos and Wailmer, depending on their natures.</p> <p>Barboach is definitely not the best Pokemon in the world to be switching into strong attacks due to its lack of resistances and merely decent defenses. Therefore, it is a good idea to avoid switching Barboach into strong attackers whenever possible. That being said, if Barboach is able to get into battle while taking little to no damage, such as after a KO or on an Electric- or Rock-typed attack, it can be very difficult to stop after setting up. This is largely because it has just one weakness, to the very uncommon Grass-type attacks. Barboach also has better defenses than many sweepers, such as Gastly and Houndour, and has comparable defenses to its fellow Dragon Dance sweeper, Dratini.</p> <p>Barboach greatly appreciates dual screens, which aid in its setup and allow it to sweep more easily. Because of this, Abra and Bronzor both make good partners to Barboach, as they can set up screens. Barboach also likes having Wynaut support, because if it can Encore the right move, such as an Electric-type attack or a non-attacking move, Barboach can get a free Dragon Dance.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Choice": {
        "description": "<p>This set's main selling point is that Barboach has excellent dual STAB moves, shared only by Wooper in Little Cup. Barboach's two main physical STAB attacks, Earthquake and Waterfall, provide near-flawless coverage in Little Cup and are good options on a Choice set. Return provides coverage on the Pokemon Earthquake and Waterfall miss out on, such as Mantyke and Snover. Double-Edge is an interesting option on this set, especially very late in the game, when it can nab some hard-to-get KOs. Keep in mind that if you opt to use Double-Edge, however, that Barboach must have the ability Oblivious. Spark hits most Water-types super effectively and has high chance of paralysis.</p> <p>This set requires a lot of prediction to use it effectively, as there are many common Pokemon in Little Cup that have immunity to Barboach's attacks. Levitators, such as Bronzor and Duskull, and Flying-types, such as Gligar and Mantyke, are all immune to Earthquake. Mantyke also has an added bonus of gaining 25% of its health from Waterfall due to Water Absorb, which means it is fully resistant to both of Barboach's STAB moves. Croagunk also sports an immunity to Waterfall, but is OHKOed by Earthquake. Ghosts, such as Gastly and Duskull, are immune to Return and Double-Edge. All of these immunities makes Barboach tricky to play with.</p> <p>Bronzor is one Pokemon that makes a good partner to this set as they cover each other's weaknesses. Bronzor can run an effective special set, which can provide good coverage with Barboach, who hits physically. Snover is another solid partner to this set, because it resists Grass, which is Barboach's only weakness. Barboach covers Snover's Fire-type, Poison-type, and Rock-type weaknesses as well.</p>"

Payback is outclassed by Crunch, as Corphish can't take a hit anyway. Protect is good for scouting, but has no place on Corphish's sets. Superpower is another option, but the Attack drops are unwelcome. A mixed sweeper set is also a viable option, since Corphish gets many good special attacks, such as Ice Beam, Sludge Bomb, and STAB Surf.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Croagunk is the best counter to Corphish, being able to switch in on Waterfall with impunity, and use Fake Out followed by Vacuum Wave to deal massive damage. However, it should be wary of switching into Return from the Dragon Dance and Swords Dance sets.</p> <p>The sets that need setup are stopped by Croagunk and Dratini, while the Choice Scarf set requires prediction, and can be taken advantage of when Corphish is locked in on the wrong move. Waterfall is an entry hole for Croagunk, Return allows Gastly in to set up a Substitute, while Crunch and Rock Slide are setup fodder for Rock Polish Aron.

Also, without a single Dragon Dance, Corphish can OHKO Duskull with Crunch, unlike Krabby, who can't with Crabhammer. After a single Dragon Dance, Corphish hits 25 Attack (backed by Life Orb) and 21 Speed. With this raw power, Corphish destroys a lot of the metagame with its assortment of attacks.

In terms of support, Pineco is a good choice to Rapid Spin away entry hazards. You will also want a Pokemon who can set up entry hazards of your own, as Corphish appreciates the support for breaking Focus Sash and chipping away at the opponent's HP.

Access to dual screens is another major bonus for Baltoy. Its resistances to common attacking types such as Fighting and Rock and great ability, Levitate, only further Baltoy's defensive credentials. Its offensive movepool is no joke either: Baltoy has access to Earthquake, Zen Headbutt, Explosion, Psychic, Earth Power, Shadow Ball, and Ice Beam, which, in tandem with its decent Speed stat, makes Baltoy quite a potent offensive threat. All in all, though Baltoy's stats are lacking, its phenomenal movepool more than compensates for this, making it a very viable Pokemon in Little Cup.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>There aren't a lot of other options for Baltoy, as almost all of the bases are covered by the listed sets. Baltoy can run a physical Choice set, but would lose to Bronzor and Ghost-types not named Gastly. Gravity is an interesting option, but Baltoy would then lose its coveted immunity to Ground-type attacks. Recycle can restore Baltoy's Oran Berry, and could be used in conjunction with Substitute and Calm Mind, but then Baltoy would lose to Munchlax way too quickly. Finally, Ancient Power can be used to hit Bug-, Ice-, and Flying-types for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Baltoy actually has a lot of counters. If Baltoy does not carry Explosion, Munchlax beats it with ease. Stunky can come in on any non-Ground-type move not named Explosion, and put Baltoy in a \"checkmate\" position with Sucker Punch and Pursuit. Bulky Water-types like Mantyke also fare well against Baltoy. Buizel also beats Baltoy, and Carvanha sports an immunity to Psychic-type attacks and can threaten Baltoy with Waterfall and Crunch. Grass-types also do a good job of stopping Baltoy. Choice Scarf Shroomish can take any attack except Explosion and either KO Baltoy with Seed Bomb or put it to sleep with Spore. Choice Scarf Paras works exactly the same way, except that it can also KO Baltoy with X-Scissor. Snover has Blizzard and Energy Ball, both of which do a nice job of taking out Baltoy.

The final move should be selected depending on what you want Baltoy to hit harder. Earth Power gets STAB and demolishes Croagunk and Stunky, two Pokemon that would normally threaten vulnerable Psychic-types like Baltoy with Sucker Punch or Pursuit, easily OHKOing Croagunk and potentially doing the same to Stunky. On the other hand, Explosion destroys Munchlax and Mantyke. Oran Berry will grant Baltoy extra longevity, giving it more time to support the team. A Bold nature is preferred in order to improve Baltoy's lower Defense stat. However, if Explosion is being used on this set, a Relaxed nature is preferred to prevent Baltoy from losing a point in Attack. The EVs maximize Baltoy's physical bulk, and the remaining EVs give an extra point apiece to Baltoy's Special Attack and Special Defense stats.</p> <p>Psychic would give Baltoy a secondary STAB outside of Earth Power, but Shadow Ball is generally the better option because it hits all Ghost-types, not just Gastly, for super effective damage. Reflect can be used in the last slot to reduce the damage taken from Pursuit users, but Earth Power and Explosion are preferred since they can remove said Pursuit users directly.</p> <p>Mantyke, Houndour, Snover, and Magnemite are all great partners for this set, as they also have good synergy with Baltoy. For example, Mantyke benefits greatly from Baltoy's talents, as Baltoy can clear Stealth Rock for Mantyke while also easily taking the Electric- and Rock-type attacks that threaten. Houndour can take Ice-, Ghost-, and Dark-type attacks aimed at Baltoy, while Baltoy is immune to the Ground-type attacks and resists the Fighting-type attacks that plague Houndour. Unfortunately, Baltoy and Houndour share a weakness to Water-type attacks. In Snover's case, Baltoy resists Snover's weaknesses to Fighting- and Rock-type attacks, while Snover resists Baltoy's weaknesses to Water- and Grass-type attacks. Magnemite is probably the best partner to Baltoy, as they have near-perfect synergy. Magnemite can take any Grass-, Ghost-, or Dark-type attack, while Baltoy resists Fighting-type attacks and is immune to Ground-type attacks. More importantly, Magnemite traps Bronzor, which beats this set with ease (assuming Bronzor carries Hidden Power Ice). Poison-types such as Croagunk and Stunky are also good teammates because they can take Grass-type attacks for Baltoy while Baltoy is immune to the Ground-type attacks that they fear. Finally, Normal-types such as Munchlax are immune to Ghost-type attacks, and Baltoy resists Fighting-type attacks.</p> <p>Pokemon that are adept at removing Ghost-types help Baltoy exponentially, as Ghost-types can block Rapid Spin and threaten Baltoy with their STAB moves. Stunky, Munchlax, and other Pursuit users can trap and KO most Ghost-types, which greatly increases Baltoy's usefulness.</p>"

      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Baltoy's decent bulk and fairly low Speed allow it to be a competent user of Trick Room. Earthquake and Zen Headbutt give Baltoy two very powerful STAB attacks, and Explosion allows Baltoy to go out with a bang whenever it chooses. However, Stealth Rock is preferred over Zen Headbutt because Baltoy doesn't really have the offensive capabilities to pull off a sweep by itself. Explosion is critical to this set because it can potentially remove a wall from the game, thus paving the way for a teammate to sweep. Muscle Band pumps up all of Baltoy's attacks, but Oran Berry can be used instead to increase Baltoy's survivability. A Relaxed nature is preferred, but, if the lack of power is an issue, a Brave nature can be used to net Baltoy an extra point in Attack.</p> <p>Pokemon with high Defense shut this moveset down. For example, Bronzor resists Zen Headbutt and Explosion, is immune to Earthquake, and threatens Baltoy with Hidden Power Ice. As a result, Magnemite is a good partner for this set; Magnemite can trap and kill Bronzor, as well as being able to make good use of Trick Room. Since the goal of this set is to set up Trick Room, Pokemon with low Speed and high attacking stats make decent teammates at the very least. Machop, Snover, Cubone, and the aforementioned Magnemite all have the potential to reach extremely low Speeds and have access to extremely powerful attacks.</p>"

      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Baltoy, with its nice typing and decent defenses, can run dual screens competently enough. This set aims to give setup sweepers the chances they need to raise their stats, as dual screens halve the damage that these sweepers would usually take. Reflect and Light Screen are naturally the core of this set, allowing your whole team to take only half damage from most attacks. Stealth Rock provides additional support, if needed. It should be noted that Stealth Rock should be used before either screen in order to maximize the number of turns that Baltoy and the rest of the team have under the screens' protection. Explosion is a nice option on Baltoy, allowing a sweeper to get a clean switch-in. An Impish nature is necessary to bolster Baltoy's middling Defense, while the EVs are used to maximize its HP and Attack. The remaining EVs are used to add an extra point to Baltoy's Defense and Special Defense.</p> <p>Setup sweepers are this Baltoy's best friends. They will absolutely love having 6 turns of one screen and 5 turns of the other (assuming Baltoy switches out or uses Explosion the turn after it uses the second screen). Chinchou, Krabby, and Houndour are great partners for this set. However, it should be noted that the first two share a Grass-type weakness with Baltoy. Pokemon that set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes are also good partners for this set, as they too can assist setup sweepers. Tentacool, Pineco, and even Budew are all great candidates for this role.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Baltoy has decent Speed, which, in combination with its great movepool, allows it to run a Choice Scarf set reasonably well. With a neutral nature and maximum investment, Baltoy hits 15 Speed; with a Choice Scarf equipped, it hits 22 Speed. Not only does Baltoy now outspeed all unboosted Pokemon, but it also beats all Pokemon that hit 21 Speed with a Choice Scarf. Earth Power is a great STAB move for Baltoy to have, as it has good power and a 10% chance of lowering its opponents' Special Defense. It also will make Stunky think twice before switching in. Psychic is Baltoy's secondary STAB, and is the Psychic-type equivalent of Earth Power. Psychic nets a quick KO on all Gastly that switch in thinking that Baltoy is going to use Earth Power or Explosion. Ice Beam hits Gligar and other Ground-types for super effective damage, and as Baltoy is immune to Ground-type attacks, it will be easy to switch in on these targets. However, as Shadow Ball hits all Ghost-types for super effective damage, it is also worth consideration. Finally, Explosion will dent any Munchlax that thinks it can come in and easily sponge a special attack. A Mild nature is preferred, so Baltoy gets an extra point in Special Attack, but a Hasty nature can be used for two more points in Speed. If you choose to give Baltoy a Speed-boosting nature, Baltoy can be considered a revenge killer for Dragon Dance Dratini. The EVs maximize Baltoy's Special Attack and Speed, and an extra point is thrown into Baltoy's HP and Attack.</p> <p>If Baltoy chooses the wrong move, it will lose badly to Pursuit users. If it chooses Psychic or Shadow Ball, Stunky can come in and kill Baltoy with Pursuit. If Baltoy doesn't choose Explosion, Munchlax can come in and KO with Pursuit. In addition, Gastly, in addition to other Levitating Ghost-types, can come in on Earth Power and set up. Good teammates to this set include Choice Scarf Fighting-types and Pursuit users of your own. Choice Scarf Mankey and Machop easily revenge kill Munchlax and Stunky, while Pursuit users beat most Ghost-types. An option on this set is to run Hidden Power Fire in the third slot, or Bronzor will wall this set all day long. However, this is inadvisable because Baltoy will lose coverage against both Ground-types and Ghost-types.</p>"

  "Lileep": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Lileep is a curious Pokemon in the Little Cup tier; in order to fully use its sweeping potential, you need to pair it with a certain Pokemon. The main component to any Lileep team is Hippopotas due to its ability to activate sandstorm, which raises Lileep's average Special Defense stat to one of the highest in the metagame. You also need a team that can soften up and remove problematic counters for Lileep so that it can safely stat up. Combine this with a decent HP stat, a strong Defense stat, a movepool that complements its natural bulk, and a helpful ability in Suction Cups, and you get a Pokemon that has the potential to sweep through unprepared teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Lileep has some other interesting options; Curse cuts down on setup time, but leaves Lileep more open to special attacks. However, the absence of Swords Dance frees up a slot for Lileep to run another attacking move, like Rock Slide, alongside Seed Bomb. Curse Lileep should run an EV spread of 228 HP / 220 SpD / 60 Def. Amnesia is another option which would allow you to get as many boosts as you wanted instead of the normal cap of three that Stockpile has. It is also possible to run a stall set that uses Toxic and Energy Ball instead of Swords Dance and Seed Bomb; however, you might as well set up Lileep if you can stall.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>The number one counter to Lileep is Snover; not only does it stop sandstorm and eliminate the Special Defense boost, but it can also OHKO Lileep with a STAB Blizzard. You will want to get rid of it and have sand presence before you set up Lileep, otherwise it will switch in all day and make Lileep's life miserable.</p> <p>Surprisingly, Dratini and Bagon are fairly decent counters to Lileep because of their ability to Dragon Dance in the face of Lileep while taking minimal damage even from a Swords Dance-boosted Seed Bomb. Smart Dratini users will usually Dragon Dance up until they know Lileep is in KO range for Outrage, but often, many will panic and immediately attack, in which case Lileep can just Recover off most of the damage and then wear them down. Anything that can poison Lileep with Toxic is also a pretty effective counter. The good news is that Toxic is fairly rare in Little Cup, along with the use of Toxic Spikes, so this is usually a minor threat; it is still possible, however. Lastly, critical hits are the bane of Lileep's existence. It may sound silly, but often if a Lileep gets set up with 3 Stockpiles and a Swords Dance, that 6% chance is all it takes to render all Lileep's hard work for nought.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stockpile + Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This is one of the most despised sets in Little Cup for its ability to turn a \"won\" match into a quick loss. This set is simple and fairly easy to set up; however, it will require permanent sandstorm to be in effect. Switch Lileep in near the end of a match, when most Pokemon are weakened, and begin to Stockpile up. With the bulky EV spread, Lileep reaches 26 HP, 18 Def, and 24 SpD under sandstorm conditions, even before any boosts. Stockpile and Recover as necessary to maintain maximum health (also remember that you have an Oran Berry, which is basically like a free Recover). All the while sandstorm should be whittling down the opposing Pokemon's health. In the end you are aiming to get 3 Stockpiles and at least one Swords Dance in before you starting attacking.</p> <p>Often you will find that unless the opposing Pokemon either has STAB Ice-, Fighting-, or Bug-type attacks, they aren't going to bring Lileep down. Their only hope is a lucky critical hit. After sufficient setup, sweep with Seed Bomb, which will be coming from 20 Attack after a Swords Dance. If you're feeling lucky, you can Swords Dance even more if you feel like you need the extra power.</p> <p>Hippopotas is a required teammate in order for this set to function properly. Outside of that, there are a few key teammates that can make Lileep's life much easier. A Pokemon to take Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Machop and Mankey is highly advised. Slowpoke fits this bill nicely, and as a bonus, Slowpoke also eats any Ice-type attacks thrown at Lileep. In return, Lileep walks all over any users of Electric- and Grass-type attacks, and can easily tank most users of Dark- and Ghost-type attacks. If a teammate has spread poison around the opposing team through the use of Toxic and Toxic Spikes, the amount of time that it takes Lileep to wear out the opponents is greatly diminished. Omanyte is a fantastic teammate to set up Toxic Spikes, while defensive Gligar is a great choice to spread around Toxic. Finally, if Lileep is afflicted with Toxic or Toxic Spikes, it's basically turned into dead weight. Therefore, including a Poison-type such as Croagunk, or Rapid Spinner such as Pineco or Sandshrew on your team will prove to be greatly beneficial.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Lileep makes a great lead due its ability to beat a lot of the common leads in Little Cup and its general bulk to take a lot of hits. Common leads in Little Cup include Kabuto, Omastar, Phanpy, Chimchar, Aipom, Meowth, and Houndour, many of whom Lileep can easily manage. Stealth Rock is a no-brainer move that is usually set up, barring Taunt leads like Aipom and Meowth. Energy Ball is a nice STAB move that hits Kabuto, Omastar, and Phanpy for significant damage. Earth Power hits Chimchar and Houndour for super effective damage and breaks their Focus Sashes. Ancient Power is a strong STAB move that hits Flying Pokemon like Mantyke for decent damage. The novelty in this set lies in the fact that nothing can really OHKO Lileep except for Snover's Blizzard. 228 HP and 220 Special Defense EVs allow it to survive an Overheat from Houndour and Chimchar with just enough health left to activate Oran Berry. The extra EVs are put into Special Attack to give Lileep a little extra power.</p> <p>Alternatively, Giga Drain can be used instead of Energy Ball for the ability to heal a little bit, though it sacrifices power; it still OHKOes Kabuto and Omastar, and takes a significant chunk from Phanpy. Hidden Power Rock is also another option that gives you 10 more Base Power than Ancient Power. However, Ancient Power's ability to boost all stats by one stage 10% of the time is usually more helpful than the power boost of Hidden Power Rock.</p> <p>As Lileep can't beat Snover, a Pokemon to tank its Blizzard is a highly recommended teammate. Mantyke can easily tank Blizzard and threaten to maim it back with Hidden Power Flying. Lileep also cannot prevent other leads from setting up Stealth Rock, so packing a Rapid Spinner on your team, such as Pineco or Sandshrew, is crucial.</p>"

  "Anorith": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Anorith has good stats, excellent dual STABs, and reliable offensive moves to back them up, but its prowess in Little Cup is slightly shaky. Its Rock typing gives it a weakness to two of the most popular priority attacks in the game, while its Bug typing gives it a weakness to Stealth Rock. On top of this, nearly all of the Pokemon who can beat it sit comfortably at the top of Little Cup and show no signs of being displaced. Despite all this, Anorith's merits cannot be denied. It is both fast and powerful, with access to boosting moves to stress both points. Although its typing is terrible defensively, it is undoubtedly a godsend offensively. All in all, Anorith has the potential to be one of the best sweepers or supporters in Little Cup, given the right teammates.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Anorith's Special Attack is not great, even by Little Cup standards, but it gets a couple of interesting special attacks. Earth Power is an intriguing option that has some utility over Brick Break (especially on the Rock Polish set). By diverting some EVs from Defense to Special Attack, Anorith can not only beat the original targets of Shieldon and Aron, but also OHKO Croagunk. Hidden Power Ice can be used to deal some damage to Gligar. Already mentioned in the set descriptions are Aerial Ace and Crush Claw--Aerial Ace hits the Fighting-types who wall Anorith's STAB moves, though its coverage and power beyond that is poor. Crush Claw has a nice chance of lowering the opponent's Defense as well as having great neutral coverage, but has low Base Power.</p> <p>On the Rock Polish set, you can lower Anorith's Speed EVs to increase defensive capability if you are sure that Anorith can pull off a Rock Polish boost--76 Speed allows Anorith to hit 30 Speed after the boost, which is still sufficient to outrun every Pokemon of note besides Choice Scarf Diglett. Doing this also allows Anorith to glean another precious point in one of its defensive stats. You should not add EVs to HP unless Life Orb isn't present, which is inadvisable. For the defensive stats, 36 Defense EVs give Anorith one extra point, and 116 gives it two, making either 236 Atk / 196 Def / 76 Spe usable for an extra point in Defense, or 236 Atk / 116 Def / 36 SpD / 76 Spe for an extra point in Special Defense. If you are using Earth Power or another special attack on Anorith, you should move the defensive EVs to Special Attack and use a Naughty or Lonely nature. If you run a Life Orb set, you can run 0 HP IVs to minimize the damage taken from Life Orb.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>It is very difficult to find a hard counter to the Swords Dance set, although bulky Choice Band Machop comes close. It is really much easier to revenge kill than to straight-out wall this set. Abra and Gastly can both outspeed Adamant versions and KO with their STAB attacks, while Croagunk resists every move it uses and has OHKO potential with one of its many priority moves. Machop and Mankey work in the same way, while Choice Scarf variants can outrun and OHKO with their STAB moves. Diglett can trap and revenge kill nearly any Anorith with Earthquake, Sucker Punch, or a super effective Rock Slide, besides the Choice Scarf and Rock Polish sets. Faster Water-types who can OHKO include Poliwag, Staryu, and Buizel, the latter of whom also has STAB Aqua Jet.</p> <p>The Rock Polish set is far easier to counter per se--it often does not have the power to beat some of the walls which the Swords Dance set can simply hammer through, despite being faster and thus harder to revenge kill. Bronzor can take an X-Scissor and survive with Oran Berry, and Gyro Ball versions can easily KO after Anorith uses Rock Polish. Gligar also easily survives Anorith's attacks, and can stall with Roost or crush Anorith with a super effective Aqua Tail. Hippopotas has Slack Off and STAB Earthquake, but the weather it brings with it can actually help Anorith by increasing its bulk against special attacks. Defensive Water-types with OHKO potential include Tentacool, Krabby, Squirtle, Omanyte, and Kabuto, although the latter two have to be wary of Brick Break if they are not under the rain. Of these, Tentacool resists Anorith's Bug STAB and can OHKO with STAB Surf, Krabby has its trademark Crabhammer available, and Kabuto can blast Anorith away with Aqua Jet. Bulky Fighting-types such as Machop also make fine counters to Rock Polish Anorith.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Anorith can run a Choice set reasonably effectively due to good Speed and Attack backed up by an excellent STAB combination. In general, an Adamant nature should be used with a Choice Scarf to promote attacking power, while a Jolly nature should be used with a Choice Band to salvage lost Speed. With a Jolly nature and a Choice Band, Anorith reaches 28 Attack and 18 Speed, while with an Adamant nature and a Choice Scarf, it has 20 Attack and 25 Speed. The Choice Band allows Anorith to become a force to be reckoned with in Little Cup, with very little being able to switch into it risk-free. On the other hand, the Choice Scarf set is usually played more as a late-game cleaner and makeshift revenge killer, taking down broken or weakened teams.</p> <p>X-Scissor is Anorith's main STAB attack and its most reliable form of late-game offense. Rock Slide is used as a secondary STAB move, as sadly Anorith does not get Stone Edge, though the flinch chance somewhat mitigates this loss in power. The remaining two moves are used for coverage purposes; Brick Break helps destroy Steel-types who resist Anorith's STAB moves, while the fourth slot covers the only other type that resists both Rock- and Bug-type attacks: Fighting. In general, the best way to damage Machop and Croagunk without locking Anorith into a weak move is to use a strong neutral attack, as Anorith's movepool is fairly shallow. Double-Edge is very powerful, but causes recoil damage, while Body Slam can allow Anorith to get some lucky paralysis on the opposing team, which can help out against potential revenge killers.</p> <p>Aerial Ace can also be used to weaken the Fighting-types who are typically the first to switch in on Anorith, therefore allowing a Pokemon such as Teddiursa to sweep more easily. However, Aerial Ace has few uses aside from this, not to mention that there are other Pokemon such as Gligar who are also liable to switch in. In general, Double-Edge and Body Slam have greater neutral coverage and less risk attached compared to Aerial Ace. Crush Claw is also worth consideration for the 50% chance of a Defense drop, though having a Choice item makes it difficult to capitalize on this.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is very useful for helping Anorith sweep because not only does it chip off HP from bulkier opponents such as Gligar, but it also breaks the Focus Sash of foes like Gastly. Additionally, Rapid Spin support is beneficial, as Anorith will survive at most four switches in with Stealth Rock on the field, and as this is a Choice set, Anorith is very likely to be switching often. By far the greatest threats to Choice Anorith are Fighting-types, and it is all too easy to allow a Pokemon like Croagunk to set up on Anorith's Choice-locked X-Scissor. In this situation, Gastly and Gligar are your best bets provided that Croagunk lacks the moves to deal with them.</p> <p>Essentially, the two biggest threats to Choice Anorith are Pokemon who resist the move Anorith is locked into and faster revenge killers. Diglett is more than capable of removing Anorith when it is locked into Rock Slide, while Machop and Croagunk can dispose of Anorith with Bullet Punch and Vacuum Wave, respectively. There are very few support options that deter revenge killing, though paralysis support can help. Choice Anorith is great at removing slower Pokemon who are weak to one of its moves, such as Slowpoke, Houndour, and Snover, while the Scarf variant is excellent at revenge killing weakened threats. These traits make Anorith a good partner to Pokemon such as Abra and Bellsprout, who may be hindered by the Pokemon whom Anorith can easily handle.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Anorith is one of five Pokemon in Little Cup who can learn the combination of Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, which combined with its decent Speed, offensive prowess, and resistance to Fake Out makes it a worthy choice for a lead. While more directly offensive than many other supporting leads, it has an excellent support movepool and is one of the most reliable Stealth Rock users in Little Cup. Despite a shorter lifespan than the more offensive Anorith sets, as well as being slightly overshadowed by Kabuto due to a lack of priority, a lead is certainly a viable choice for Anorith to take, and can be a great method of support for your team.</p> <p>Rapid Spin is the main attraction on this set, being able to remove entry hazards such as Spikes and Stealth Rock. Anorith can also set up its own Stealth Rock to help your team, breaking the opponent's Focus Sash and building up damage over time. One way to use this Anorith is to attack as the opponent sets up entry hazards, and if it has a Focus Sash, use Rapid Spin to not only dispose of it outright but also to remove the entry hazards it set up. X-Scissor is Anorith's main STAB attack, dealing a good amount of damage to most other leads, in particular the frailer leads such as Meowth and Diglett. It can also 3HKO Bronzor through its Oran Berry, something Kabuto cannot do. For the last slot, Brick Break is the best option to take down Pokemon who resist X-Scissor, such as Aron, deal more damage to Kabuto and Meowth, and break screens set up by leads such as Bronzor, although it does leave Anorith helpless against Gastly and Drifloon. Remember that Rock Slide is always available as an alternative secondary STAB for the popular Ghost- and Flying-types of Little Cup.</p> <p>The Pokemon who benefit most from Anorith's support are those who are most affected by entry hazards; for example, Houndour is weak to Stealth Rock and, as such, greatly benefits from its removal from the field, and Grass-types such as Bellsprout can more easily deal with Fire-, Flying-, Bug-, and Ice-types after they make a couple of switches into Stealth Rock. It is mostly sweepers who benefit from Anorith's particular brand of support, since Stealth Rock can weaken opponents and make them easier prey. Dragon Dance Dratini and Agility + Swords Dance Krabby are two examples of boosting sweepers who appreciate not being blocked by a random Focus Sash user.</p>"
      },
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>Anorith has two desirable stat-boosting moves for attempting a sweep: Swords Dance and Rock Polish. This set focuses on the latter move, which boosts Anorith's decent 16 Speed stat to an impressive 32, allowing it to outspeed and OHKO many threats who would otherwise be able to revenge kill it. While slightly better protected against most revenge killers due to its boosted Speed stat and extra Defense EVs, Anorith may often find that it lacks the ability to power through bulky walls such as Bronzor and Gligar. Not only that, but it is still as weak to priority attacks as ever, and has no particularly feasible way of beating Machop and other Fighting-types.</p> <p>Anorith's two STAB moves make up the core of this moveset once again, while Brick Break provides reasonable coverage against Steel-types. Life Orb is an option if you want to salvage Anorith's lost Attack stat, but it does detract from its ability to survive blows even with the added defensive investment--if you want to increase survivability in this regard, Oran Berry is preferable, but remember that Anorith will lose out on a lot of power. The EVs and nature allow for maximum attacking power while also granting Anorith 16 Speed. The remainder of the EVs grant Anorith two extra points when placed in either Defense or Special Defense, which helps it take hits better and may well be the difference between life and death. Placing them both into Defense is preferable as Anorith is usually better suited at taking physical hits.</p> <p>Setting Anorith's HP IV to 0 is an option if Life Orb is chosen, causing Life Orb damage to round down to 1 HP per move; while this may sound good on paper, it comes at the price of 2 extra hit points at the start, which limits Anorith's survivability. In the end, it comes down to your personal preference.</p> <p>In many ways, the Rock Polish set is very similar to the Swords Dance set, with the identical combination of moves and items, and the only real differences being the set-up move of choice, the nature, and a point in Defense in exchange for Speed. However, these two sets in battle are played far more differently than one would expect at first glance. The Swords Dance set needs only to power its way through a slow team, with little to stop it from OHKOing anything it walks into. Thus, the support required hinges deeply in building momentum against the opponent's team through entry hazards and paralysis support, allowing Anorith to channel its power as smoothly as possible for as long as possible. With the Rock Polish sweeper, however, it is critical that any Pokemon who can take a hit, such as Bronzor, Gligar, Hippopotas, and bulky Fighting-types such as Machop, are all gone, since if you are unable to do so, Anorith will not last long, and you would probably have been better off with a Choice set to help with offensive pressure.</p> <p>Bulky Fighting-types present the biggest problem for this set, because without Swords Dance, it can't just simply muscle its way past them. To deal with them, the best method is to almost always play with resistances, especially with stronger ones like Machop, and then weaken or revenge kill. Ghost-types such as Gastly and Drifloon can come into Choice-locked Fighting-types and set up, while Gligar can take a Fighting attack or two, attack with STAB Earthquake or Aerial Ace, and heal off the damage with Roost. Against Bronzor, Gligar, and Hippopotas, most Pokemon with strong, super effective attacks and decent bulk, such as Krabby, are capable of mauling the walls with ease. Bronzor can be dealt with through strong Fire attacks from Fire-types like Houndour and Ponyta, while Gligar and Hippopotas are crushed by most special Water and Ice attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>While Swords Dance Anorith does not provide the same support exhibited by the Choice sets, it makes up for it with raw power, achieving 40 Attack with an Adamant nature after a Swords Dance boost. Even with a Jolly nature, however, this Anorith suffers greatly from revenge killing, more so than the Choice Scarf and Rock Polish variants, and it is usually not bulky enough to survive neutral hits. Weaknesses to Bullet Punch and Aqua Jet does not help it, either. It is also slightly overlooked as a Swords Dance sweeper in favor of Gligar, who has greater bulk and a better movepool along with that essential 19 Speed, though Anorith has its own share of advantages as well.</p> <p>Swords Dance is the core of this set, allowing Anorith to boost its Attack stat sky-high, OHKO Croagunk with Life Orb Rock Slide, and occasionally take out bulky Machop with Brick Break with some prior damage. Rock Slide and X-Scissor are necessary STAB moves that complement each other quite nicely, and unlike the Choice sets, the opponent cannot simply switch Mantyke into X-Scissor due to the fear of Rock Slide. Only one slot is left for coverage: Brick Break is generally the best choice, since it easily disposes of Steel-types and can also hit bulky Fighting-types for decent damage.</p> <p>The choice of item is an important one. Life Orb gives the extra power needed to obtain certain important KOs, and is more useful if you are sure that Anorith can take down priority-wielding opposition, while Oran Berry is more defensively-inclined an item, providing a safeguard against weaker attacks and hopefully either allowing Anorith to get an extra Swords Dance boost or to survive an attempted revenge kill. As for the nature, Adamant is recommended because it gives Anorith a much-needed boost in power, while Jolly provides insurance against other Pokemon by ensuring that Anorith will beat Pokemon at 17 Speed and tie with those at 18 Speed. The EVs are fairly straightforward sweeping EVs, granting Anorith the best possible Attack and Speed, while the rest are given up to an extra point in Defense. Again, you can run 0 HP IVs if you let Anorith hold a Life Orb to minimize the damage taken.</p> <p>Entry hazards are very valuable since they break the opponent's Focus Sashes and cause residual damage. Rapid Spin support can also be useful, since Anorith is weak to Stealth Rock and having 5 HP spared can make the difference between life and death. Again, the biggest threats to this Anorith come from Fighting-types, particularly Machop, who can switch in, take little to no damage as Anorith sets up, and crush it with Scarf Dynamic Punch or Guts Bullet Punch. Nearly any Pokemon with 19 or more Speed, such as Timid Staryu and Jolly Buizel, can work as a revenge killer. A strong Pursuit user such as Scarf Houndour can remove Pokemon such as Choiced Abra and Gastly, and hopefully pick up a Flash Fire boost from Pokemon like Ponyta. Chinchou can take on Staryu and Buizel to a reasonable extent, resisting their STAB and most coverage moves and KOing with STAB Thunderbolt, while Croagunk can come in on their STAB attacks thanks to Dry Skin and KO with Fake Out and Sucker Punch. In Gligar's case, strong Water- or Ice-type attacks should fell it.</p>"

    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Although Shuppet has the best Attack stat out of all the Little Cup Ghost-types, it has an extremely shallow movepool; for example, its only STAB physical attack is Shadow Sneak. However, Shuppet's Special Attack is also above average, meaning that it can run mixed sets well. Although Shuppet also has an extremely nice supporting movepool, its defenses are mediocre, meaning most attacks will take a decent chunk of Shuppet's health. Its ability, Insomnia, allows Shuppet to act as a sleep absorber against opponents such as Shroomish and Venonat. All in all, Shuppet has the worst overall stats out of all the LC Ghosts, though it can definitely be an asset if given the right support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Natural Gift is pretty much Shuppet's only other option for a decent physical attack, which just goes to show how horrible Shuppet's movepool is. Grudge could be utilized with the Double Ghost strategy to eliminate Munchlax's Pursuit PP, but it's not too useful outside of that. Shuppet also gets Pursuit and Imprison, which is another way it could potentially counter Munchlax. Psychic can also be used if Fighting-types such as Mankey and Machop are troublesome to your team, but it has redundant coverage otherwise.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>A good counter to Shuppet is Houndour since its Dark Pulse is a guaranteed OHKO, and unless Shuppet has Hidden Power Fighting, it cannot do a whole lot to retaliate. Munchlax is Shuppet's ultimate counter, since it doesn't take a lot of damage from any of Shuppet's atacks, and can trap and KO it with Pursuit. Stunky is just like Houndour; it doesn't take a lot of damage from any of Shuppet's attacks besides Hidden Power Fighting, and can OHKO Shuppet with Crunch or Sucker Punch. Also, without Trick Room support or a defensive spread, Shuppet is a sitting duck in front of faster Pokemon due to its frailty and low Speed.</p>",

      "Trick Room Lead": {
        "description": "<p>The aim of this set is to set up Trick Room early on in the match, then to sacrifice Shuppet with Destiny Bond to provide a safe switch-in for one of your Trick Room sweepers. The third slot is dedicated to a priority move, and is your best bet for removing the Focus Sashes of leads such as Kabuto. Sucker Punch vs. Shadow Sneak is the age-old case of power vs. reliability. Thunderbolt is mainly meant for coverage, while Taunt can halt any opposing attempts at setup, and when used in tangent with Destiny Bond, will almost always guarantee a kill for Shuppet.</p> <p>Using minimum Speed allows Shuppet to outspeed virtually everything under Trick Room conditions, maximizing the number of leads Shuppet can drag down with it with Destiny Bond. Focus Sash is used to guarantee the set-up of Trick Room. Beware of Snover and Hippopotas though, as the damaging weather that they bring will put an immediate halt to Shuppet's Focus Sash + Destiny Bond strategy. Leads with priority moves can also avoid Destiny Bond dragging them down.</p> <p>Slow sweepers such as Wailmer and Cranidos are obvious candidates for partnering up with Shuppet, because are extremely slow, yet very powerful, making them ideal for Trick Room. Snubbull is another good teammate, having great synergy with Shuppet, a high Attack stat, andbeingvery slow, not to mention the powerful attacks it has in its arsenal, such as Return and Close Combat.</p>"

      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Shuppet has access to a great utility move in Will-O-Wisp, which allows it to check physical sweepers such as Mankey and Machop. Shadow Sneak acts as Shuppet's obligatory STAB move and is also an extremely useful priority move. Thunderbolt is partnered alongside Shadow Sneak to grant good coverage high Base Power. Destiny Bond is a last effort to take down a Pokemon from your opponent's team as Shuppet faints, but is not easy to use as Shuppet is very slow.</p> <p>Maximum HP and defense investments are used for bulk, allowing Shuppet to check physical sweepers who could otherwise threaten your team. One of the main threats to this set is Houndour, as it can get a Flash Fire boost from Shuppet's Will-O-Wisp, and proceed to use its boosted Fire-type attacks to destroy Shuppet and its teammates. Therefore, it is recommended that you have bulky Water-types such as Mantyke and Squirtle on your team, to act as a check to Houndour.</p> <p>Gastly and Drifloon are good partners if you want to run the Double Ghost strategy. Shuppet is able to cripple Munchlax or drag it down with Destiny Bond, allowing its other teammates to sweep. Munchlax is also a good partner as it is immune to Ghost attacks aimed at Shuppet, and can threaten all of Shuppet's counters, such as Houndour, with Return. Houndour makes a good teammate because it can handily checkmate enemy Ghost-types with a combination of Sucker Punch and Pursuit, and also beat Munchlax if it is running Crunch.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>This set abuses Shuppet's relatively low Speed and above average Attack. Trick Room is the bread and butter of this set, allowing Shuppet to outspeed opposing Pokemon and kill them with the approriate attack. Shadow Ball is Shuppet's main attack, being very powerful and also gaining STAB. Hidden Power Fighting provides better coverage alongside Shadow Ball than Thunderbolt, hitting all Pokemon in the tier for at least neutral damage, although it makes Shuppet lose a point in Special Attack and Special Defense. Sucker Punch is utilized to hit other priority users, and is also helpful to Shuppet for picking off weakened Pokemon, or just hitting first when Trick Room is not in effect.</p> <p>The EVs are doctored so that both offensive stats reach 17. Oran Berry is the best item to use as it allows Shuppet to reliably set up, and have enough bulk to hit the opponent a few times before getting knocked out, but Focus Sash can also be used if you are putting it in the lead position. Life Orb is an option, powering up Shuppet's offensive stats by trading off bulk; it is not recommended though, because it usually means that Shuppet will be knocked out even faster. If you are using Hidden Power Fighting, change the EV spread to 4 HP / 236 Atk / 76 Def / 176 SpA / 12 SpD.</p> <p>A good teammate for this set is Bronzor due to the fact that it can set up Trick Room easily, and can benefit from Trick Room as well. Another viable teammate for this set is Porygon, as it is immune to Ghost-type attacks and can set up Trick Room and benefit from it. Munchlax is considered a counter for this set because it outspeeds Shuppet under Trick Room conditions, doesn't get heavily damaged by Shuppet's attacks, and can trap it with Pursuit.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf Lead": {
        "description": "<p>This set has the ability to cripple a lot of common leads; Trick can be utilized to disable Stealth Rock leads, while it also allows you to take away the opponent's Focus Sash. Trick also cripples non-Stealth Rock leads who are reliant on using a variety of moves, such as Houndour, Meowth, and Aipom. Sucker Punch is Shuppet's best mono-attacking option. Thunder Wave allows Shuppet to spread paralysis and further cripple opposing leads as well as any switch-ins, while also making Destiny Bond easier to use. Destiny Bond is utilized in order to take down at least one Pokemon when Shuppet faints.</p> <p>An Adamant nature with Choice Scarf allows Shuppet to reach 21 Speed, while with Jolly it reaches 22 Speed, meaning that it outspeeds some Choice Scarf leads and all non-Choice Scarf leads. Max HP EVs are utilized for maximum bulk and the remaining 12 Special Defense EVs are used for extra bulk.</p> <p>The ability Frisk is viable on this set, since it will help you decide whether you should Trick Shuppet's Choice Scarf away, which is especially helpful against Gastly leads. Choice Scarf Mankey and Choice Scarf Snover don't mind Sucker Punch and Trick, while both outspeed Shuppet and threaten it with Payback or Punishment and Blizzard, respectively. Bronzor should therefore be used as a teammate as it can set up Stealth Rock on Snover and Mankey or retaliate with Gyro Ball. Gligar can come in on all of Mankey's attacks except for Ice Punch and can either set up Swords Dance or Agility or retaliate with Earthquake.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>This set abuses Shuppet's good offensive potential and allows it to hit extremely hard with both physical and special attacks. Substitute is utilized to ease prediction and offers protection from revenge killers and priority users. Shadow Sneak is utilized as a priority move and severely damages the opponent after the boosts from STAB and Life Orb. Shadow Ball is your primary STAB move, and Hidden Power Fighting is used on this set to maximize coverage.</p> <p>Maximum Attack and Special Attack EVs give Shuppet maximum power. 80 Speed EVs are used for an extra Speed point outspeeding other Pokemon with 45 base Speed. The leftover EVs are put into Defense to help Shuppet survive certain attacks. A viable alternative is to run 236 Speed EVs to outspeed Porygon, Snover, and neutral-natured Croagunk. Life Orb is a very handy item for this set and helps make some 2HKOs become OHKOs.</p> <p>This set tends to lure in Dark-types, especially Houndour, which Shuppet can then eliminate with Hidden Power Fighting; Grass and Ghost Pokemon who enjoy having Houndour removed would therefore make decent partners for Shuppet. Entry hazards on your side of the field can combine with Life Orb recoil and Substitute to wear Shuppet down very quickly, so having a reliable Rapid Spinner, such as Squirtle, is a very good idea.</p>"

  "Wynaut": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Wynaut is one of the most unique Pokemon in the Little Cup metagame. With Shadow Tag, Encore, Counter, and Mirror Coat at its disposal, Wynaut can become a very dangerous threat, especially to Pokemon holding a Choice Scarf or those who are slower than Wynaut, such as Bronzor. Shadow Tag and Encore in particular are Wynaut's most dangerous tools. With Shadow Tag keeping the opponent from switching, and Encore forcing them to use the same attack over and over, Wynaut can do one of many things. If the opponent uses a weak attack, Wynaut can either switch to a powerful Pokemon with a stat boosting move, or just simply Counter or Mirror Coat the Pokemon to death without any prediction. With the proper sweepers by its side, Wynaut can turn the tide of a battle with one turn. Why not use Wynaut on your team?</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Wynaut really doesn't have many options with a whopping eight moves. However, Wynaut can run a decent Choice Scarf set. With maximum Speed, Wynaut reaches 19 Speed, which outpaces a good portion of Little Cup and can use Encore before many Pokemon can switch moves. Choice Scarf Wynaut with Encore specifically helps against Pokemon such as Houndour who are using Sucker Punch or medium-paced Pokemon using Protect. Destiny Bond is also neat with 19 Speed. However, 19 Speed just isn't enough for something locked into an attack, especially when its useful attacks can only be used eight times.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Wynaut doesn't really have \"counters\", per se. It has Pokemon who can OHKO it via revenge kills, which are the closest things to counters that Wynaut has. Drifloon, Houndour, Gastly, and possibly Stunky can come in on Wynaut and OHKO it with their STAB moves. Houndour works especially well as it is immune to Mirror Coat, so even if Dark Pulse doesn't KO, Houndour is safe from harm.</p> <p>Mankey with U-turn makes a great lure if you use it with something like Stunky or Houndour with Pursuit as well. Diglett with Substitute makes a decent revenge killer as well (via Arena Trap). Diglett can use Substitute on Encore and eventually 3HKO Wynaut with Earthquake before Wynaut can do anything back to Diglett, besides Encore Earthquake. Be aware that Earthquake is not a very good move to have Encored though, because Drifloon and Gligar can both set up on it. Obviously Taunt works well against Wynaut, but be careful when attacking Wynaut after you Taunt it, because it can still use Counter and Mirror Coat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Wynaut specializes in revenge killing Choice Scarf Pokemon and getting your Pokemon a free turn of set up. With its ability, decent defensive stats, and the CounterCoat combo, Wynaut is almost guaranteed to KO a Choice Scarf Pokemon using a resisted or neutral attack. Additionally, if a Pokemon is using a weak attack or stat boosting move, Wynaut can Encore it and switch to a teammate to get a free turn of set up.</p> <p>Wynaut is one of the strangest yet most effective support Pokemon in Little Cup, due to its ability to trap almost any Pokemon with Shadow Tag. Using this set is very simple: First, you must send Wynaut in on an attack that it easily survives, or a non-damaging move such as Stealth Rock or a status move. You then use Encore on that move and proceed to do one of two things. Firstly, it can abuse Counter or Mirror Coat by simply using the correct attack to smack your opponent back for double the damage. This makes Wynaut a great revenge killer, and an excellent answer to dispose of Choice Scarf users; however, Wynaut's true strength comes in its second option. With the right move Encored, a Pokemon on Wynaut's team can potentially gain a free opportunity to set up. For example, if Wynaut Encores a Dragon Dance from Dratini, Wynaut can simply switch to a setup sweeper and attempt to wreak havoc. If it happens to Encore a move like Waterfall, a Pokemon such as Mantyke could come in and set up an Agility without taking any damage, and then proceed to sweep. Tickle is an excellent option in the last slot if you carry a Pursuit user on your team to take out specific threats, such as Bronzor. It also helps your other Pokemon take attacks while trying to set up. Safeguard or Destiny Bond are both good options in the last slot as well, depending if you would rather be able to be immune to the uncommon status effects, or attempt to take out the opposing Pokemon as they try to finish Wynaut off. Using Destiny Bond when you have low HP will start a mind game, allowing Wynaut to possibly Encore a non-damaging attack because your opponent may not want to KO their own Pokemon, but with Wynaut's pitiful Speed, this is not always going to happen.</p> <p>Wynaut is also excellent at trapping and killing Choice Scarf users like mentioned above, especially the ever common Fighting-type variants. Since most Choice Scarf users do not have the ability to KO Wynaut, and since it doesn't have to take the turn to Encore, Wynaut can simply use Counter or Mirror Coat and KO that Pokemon with ease.</p> <p>Wynaut needs to maximize its defensive capabilities, and can't use any attacks that rely on Attack or Special Attack, so bulky EVs are pretty much the only option. Before maximizing Wynaut's bulk, 12 EVs are put into Speed so that Wynaut can come in on Bronzor and use Encore before Bronzor can switch attacks. Wynaut gets 27 HP with 76 EVs and will obtain a total of 14 in both defenses after putting 212 EVs in Special Defense and 132 EVs in Defense with an Impish nature.</p> <p>First and foremost, Wynaut needs to be paired with a strong set of setup sweepers to take advantage of Encore. These Pokemon need to have pretty good defensive synergy as well, because it might be hard to set up if Wynaut Encores an attack like Earthquake and you have no Ground-type resist or immunity. This means Pokemon like Gligar and Aron work quite well together with Wynaut, as Gligar resists the Fighting-type attacks and is immune to the Ground-type attacks that would OHKO Aron. Similarly, Aron resists Ice-type attacks which Gligar wouldn't be able to set up on. Like Gligar, Dratini would work well with anything that resists Ice-type attacks, because it has such a high damage output after a single turn of setting up Dragon Dance. With Tickle, Wynaut works great with Pokemon such as Taillow and Zigzagoon who need Bronzor removed. For example, if you send Wynaut in on something like Bronzor using Stealth Rock, you can Encore it and start using Tickle. After Bronzor is at -6 Defense, you wait until the Encore runs out and use Encore again. Then you switch to a Pokemon such as Stunky or Houndour to Pursuit Bronzor and KO it. This leaves your opponent open for a Taillow or Zigzagoon sweep.</p> <p>Wynaut greatly appreciates healing in the form of Wish support. Wish support gives Wynaut the ability to take more hits, and thus KO more Pokemon with Counter and Mirror Coat. This makes Lickitung a great teammate for Wynaut, as not only does it carry Wish, it also is immune to Ghost-type attacks and lures in Fighting-type attacks for Wynaut to switch into.</p>"

It may not be the one to sweep the opponent's team, but it certainly has the tools to help others do so, whether it be by weakening the opponent's team, or laying Spikes down for some crucial passive damage.</p>",

Aside from that, however, the given sets pretty much cover everything that Snorunt can do effectively in Little Cup.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Fast Fire-types are the best checks to Snorunt, as they can swiftly dispose of it with their STAB attacks. Fighting-types can also deal with it easily, as Snorunt lacks a way of taking them down quickly. Bronzor walls Snorunt completely, and can bring down Snorunt with Gyro Ball.

Inner Focus renders Fake Out unable to flinch Snorunt, and the combination of Ice Beam and Ice Shard lands a 2HKO on many an opponent, most notably Hippopotas, Snover, and Voltorb, three prominent weather-inducing leads. Lead Diglett can also be defeated, but one must be wary of Sucker Punch after taking an Earthquake. Hidden Power Ground allows Snorunt to damage leads who resist its STAB, while Hidden Power Grass allows Snorunt to beat Omanyte, Kabuto, and Onix. Spikes is placed in the last slot for team support, and should be used to incite mind games against faster Sucker Punch users.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ground can damage lead Houndour, which is usually resistant to Snorunt's main STAB attacks. Aside from that, Hidden Power Ground also provides good coverage. On the other hand, Hidden Power Grass is useful in killing Pokemon such as Onix, Kabuto, and Omanyte. This set can also run Crunch or Protect. Though Protect does not provide the obvious benefits of the current moves, it can be used to scout the opponent's moves, especially those of Choice users. Bulky Water-types, such as Buizel and Clamperl, that can check Fire-types can be good teammates for Snorunt. Slowpoke can be a good teammate too, as it covers most of Snorunt's weaknesses and deals with lead Machop well.</p>"

With 15 Speed, Snorunt is much faster than Omanyte and Pineco, the other common users of Spikes, while retaining its decent bulk. Thus, Snorunt fits into offensive teams much more easily, since it can create many opportunities to set up Spikes. Snorunt's neutrality to most special moves, barring those of the Fire-type, means that it will only be 3HKOed at best with Oran Berry, enabling it to set up at least two layers of Spikes every time. Ice Shard and Crunch allow Snorunt to whittle down the opponent's HP once it has set up Spikes.</p> <p>Snorunt's Speed is its major asset over other users of Spikes. However, if bulk is what you are looking for, then Snorunt isn't the ideal choice, as there are other Spikes users that outclass it in that area. Protect allows Snorunt to scout the opponent's team and see what move a Choice user picks. As with pretty much any Pokemon that sets up entry hazards, a Ghost-type will make a great teammate for Snorunt, as they can prevent its hard work from getting spun away. Flash Fire users and Fighting-types carrying a Choice Scarf also make good offensive teammates to Snorunt. A Stealth Rock user such as Gligar is also a good choice for a teammate considering how Spikes only affect grounded Pokemon.</p>"

Though it doesn't have the same great stats or movepool, Spheal has just enough for it to succeed on a hail team. With hail and Toxic Spikes support, it can stall many a team in the fast-paced Little Cup metagame. Spheal may make you laugh at first glance, but it can turn quickly from adorable to menacing if you let it set up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>There really isn't anything else that Spheal can do well outside of stalling in a hailstorm, as its movepool is pretty subpar. A Choice Specs set may seem appealing, but Spheal's Special Attack stat isn't that great. Spheal fails to reach a Speed stat of 21 with a Choice Scarf, making it an ineffective Choice Scarf user as well. That being said, Spheal does get some other good options. One notable support move is Encore, which eases prediction when switching Spheal out.</p> <p>One can opt to tinker with Spheal's defenses to suit one's needs. Its normal spread is 36 HP / 196 Def / 76 SpA / 196 SpD with a Bold nature for equal defenses, but you can change the EVs to make Spheal specialized for taking either physical or special hits. The difference is pretty negligible, however. Adding more EVs into HP is fine only if Aqua Ring is being used, as Spheal will lose 2 HP per turn otherwise.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>By far, the best way to stop Spheal from stalling your team out is to prevent hail from being set up. The obvious method is to use Hippopotas, the only other auto-weather Pokemon in the metagame, but unfortunately, it is directly countered by Snover. Hippopotas, in tandem with one or two of Snover's checks (such as Bronzor, Growlithe, and Munchlax), would make a good core to stop Spheal cold. Skill Link Shellder also gets a mention, as it can damage Spheal through its Substitute with a super effective Rock Blast.

Super Fang should be used in the third moveslot so opposing Ice-types don't beat this set. In addition, Super Fang is a reliable method of dealing damage, as it halves the remaining health of any non-Ghost-type Pokemon. However, Blizzard is a great STAB for Spheal, as it will deal a good amount of damage even with minimal investment. The fourth move is a matter of personal preference. Aqua Ring is the more desirable move, as after one turn of setup, it will allow Spheal to recover more health than it would lose from using Substitute (over two turns). This is vital for Spheal's longevity, as it can now stall out teams for an indefinite amount of time. However, if there is no room on the team for a Toxic Spikes user, such as Tentacool or Pineco, then Toxic can be used to compensate. The EVs give Spheal 23 HP, so Spheal will only lose 1 HP per turn if not using Aqua Ring. The remaining EVs are used to maximize Spheal's defenses, and the rest go into Special Attack.</p> <p>This set desperately needs hail support in order for it to function properly. Thankfully, Snover can set up infinite hail with its Snow Warning ability. This set also enjoys having opposing Hippopotas removed so that hail may prevail. Fortunately, Snover handles Hippopotas with ease. Bronzor and Mantyke also beat Hippopotas with no problems whatsoever. Additionally, Toxic Spikes are vital to the set's success, making your opponent's health rapidly drain away as they struggle to damage Spheal. Leech Seed support is also helpful to Spheal; this way, Spheal can regenerate more health than it loses from Substitute, though it should be noted that Leech Seed is removed when the opponent switches out. Shroomish can provide Leech Seed support, and can use Spore to incapacitate an opponent as well.</p>"

Hidden Power Electric hits Mantyke, who can be an annoyance, especially with Water Absorb.</p> <p>Dragon-types usually can snag free Dragon Dances off Clamperl. Therefore, Ice Beam is viable to prevent them from setting up and even OHKO them in some cases. Another option to use in the final spot is Toxic. While it is best to provide Clamperl with Toxic Spikes support, Toxic can hit Flying-types, such as Mantyke, who do not care about Surf. It is also a good backup in case Toxic Spikes are never set up or are spun away.</p> <p>The EVs boost Clamperl's physical defense as much as possible so that it can take physical hits well. No Special Defense EVs are needed due to the incredible boost from Deep Sea Scale. The remaining EVs go into Speed and Special Attack to slightly boost Clamperl's offensive capabilities.</p>"

    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>As far as offensive Dragon-types go, Bagon faces serious competition for a team slot with Dratini, who has the crucial advantage of priority. Of course, Bagon has selling points of its own. Its higher Attack stat makes Bagon more effective than Dratini in the middle of the game. This means that Bagon is a more solid choice for roles which do not involve setting up and sweeping. For example, when using a Choice Scarf, Bagon becomes a solid sweeper late-game. Unfortunately, Bagon's lack of priority means it will be easily revenge killed, and this is why so often it is Dratini who is lauded as Little Cup's best Dragon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Bagon doesn't have much else in its physical movepool outside of what is listed in the above sets; however, it does have a wide special movepool, which can make a Choice Specs set appealing, but it would be largely outclassed by Dratini. With a minimum Speed of 9, Bagon can function effectively under Trick Room with a Choice Band.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>The easiest way to deal with Bagon is by revenge killing it with priority. Snover, Phanpy, and Swinub all have super effective priority attacks in Ice Shard, but other revenge killers who utilize priority attacks, such as Croagunk, can do the job equally well. Against Choice Bagon, the easiest thing to do is simply switch in a Pokemon that resists whatever attack Bagon is locked into. If Bagon is locked into Outrage, Steel-types are good responses thanks to their resistance to Bagon's STAB attacks. Bronzor in particular has high Defense and can use Hidden Power Ice to dispatch Bagon promptly.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf, Bagon outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame and thus acts as a solid sweeper late-game. Outrage is a very powerful STAB move and Bagon's primary attacking option, but due to its effect of locking Bagon into the move and preventing it from switching out, it should only be used to sweep. Fire Fang allows Bagon to hit the Steel-types who resist its STAB Dragon-type moves. Hydro Pump is useful against both Gligar and Aron, who can take Bagon's physical attacks with ease. Dragon Claw gives Bagon a reliable STAB move that's useful early-game, so it isn't forced to use Outrage to pose a threat. However, Brick Break is a solid option instead if you do not trust Hydro Pump's shaky accuracy against Aron.</p> <p>While the options listed above are almost always the superior choices, there are a couple of changes worth noting should you want to beat specific threats or change Bagon's playstyle slightly. With a Choice Band equipped, Bagon becomes a valuable wallbreaker, and that added power can make a world of difference. However, the loss in Speed makes Bagon much easier to revenge kill. Lastly, Hidden Power Ice is a viable option as it can OHKO Gligar after Stealth Rock damage, but doesn't do much else.</p> <p>While this set is effective on its own, with proper support Bagon truly becomes a force to be reckoned with. In order to give Bagon its best chance to sweep, Steel-types and Gligar need to be taken care of so that Bagon can unleash its Outrage. Houndour can easily take care of Steel-types, most notably Bronzor, while Snover is one of the best answers to Gligar in Little Cup. Stealth Rock support is also extremely helpful for Bagon due to the additional damage that can make the difference between a 2HKO and an OHKO.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>While not quite as effective as its evolution, Salamence, Bagon can use Dragon Dance in order to set up a sweep. Outrage is only resisted by Steel-types, and when backed by STAB, Dragon Dance, and Bagon's high Attack stat, it becomes a powerful sweeping tool capable of tearing apart weakened teams late-game. Fire Fang has great coverage alongside Bagon's Dragon-type STAB, since it hits the common Steel-types of Little Cup, such as Bronzor, for super effective damage. Dragon Claw allows Bagon to tear holes in the opposing team early in the game without being locked in as with Outrage, and is useful in its own right as a moderately powerful STAB move. On the other hand, Brick Break is a viable option if hitting Aron is a top priority, since it is not hit super effectively by Fire Fang.</p> <p>As Bagon is a sweeper, you will want to make sure that it is able to set up without taking much damage and to sweep successfully. Dual screen support from the likes of Bronzor or Magnemite is extremely helpful, allowing Bagon to set up Dragon Dance with little trouble and also giving it extra protection from priority attacks while rampaging. Both of these Pokemon are also useful teammates for other reasons, too; Bronzor can deal with Gligar using its natural bulk, immunity to Earthquake, and Hidden Power Ice, while Magnemite can trap and kill opposing Steel-types thanks to its Magnet Pull ability. Stealth Rock is also crucial to facilitate Bagon's sweep, increasing residual damage and breaking any Focus Sashes. For example, the extra damage allows Bagon to OHKO Munchlax with Dragon Claw after a Dragon Dance boost.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Beldum is one of the more interesting Pokemon in Little Cup; its unique dual typing, impressive defenses, and decent Attack makes you ask yourself: \"why isn't it more commonly used?\". Unfortunately for Beldum, the lack of any support moves (and a narrow movepool in general) to make use of its bulk leave it with little it can do. Despite the aforementioned drawbacks, Beldum's decent stats and access to two solid STAB attacks give it reason enough to be considered as a member of your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Due to its extremely narrow movepool consisting of only 5 moves, there are no other options for Beldum. Regarding other set options, it lacks any support moves to play as an effective supporter, or any stat boosting moves to function as a set-up sweeper.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Due to Beldum's shallow and predictable movepool, it is not too hard to counter. Magnemite comes out as the number one counter to Beldum, resisting all its attacks and having the ability to trap it with Magnet Pull. STAB Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fire can be used to finish Beldum off (depending on Magnemite's set). Bronzor also takes a negligible amount from Beldum's attacks, thanks to its great resistances and impressive bulk, and can hit back with Earthquake, or even use Beldum as fodder to set up entry hazards or dual screens. Fire-types can deal with Beldum provided they steer clear of Zen Headbutt. Houndour has a secondary Dark-typing in addition to its Fire-typing, granting it an immunity and resistance to both Zen Headbutt and Iron Head, respectively. Ponyta, Houndour, and Growlithe all outspeed Beldum and can easily nail it with STAB Fire Blast or Flare Blitz, so having a safe switch-in for these attacks is important.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This is the best set that Beldum can run. Iron Head is Beldum's primary STAB attack, though it has mediocre coverage alongside Zen Headbutt; the combination is resisted by a number of common LC Pokemon, such as Houndour and Bronzor. The move in the third slot depends on how much you value the extra power Take Down has over Headbutt. When making your choice, however, keep in mind that Take Down's accuracy is unreliable, and that Beldum must suffer recoil damage from using it. Headbutt can be useful at times due to its 30% flinch rate. Iron Defense is Beldum's only option for its 4th moveslot, and with +2 Defense, rest assured that Beldum can take any physical attack thrown at it regardless of power and effectiveness. Oran Berry is the primary item choice as it allows Beldum to regain roughly 50% of its health instantaneously. Life Orb is a good alternative, although it's worth noting that Beldum can take a hit or two, so the Life Orb recoil damage probably isn't worth the boost in power, not to mention Beldum's poor Speed.</p> <p>The given EVs maximize Beldum's Attack stat, as this is all Beldum has going for it. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense, adding to Beldum's already decent bulk, and Speed, allowing Beldum to outspeed other base 30 Pokemon. If you'd rather Beldum was able to take special attacks better, you could shift the Defense EVs into Special Defense.</p> <p>Diglett makes a great teammate for Beldum, being able to trap slower Fire- and Electric-types, and then dispose of them with its STAB Earthquake, thus allowing Beldum to navigate the battlefield more freely. Paralysis support is useful, as Beldum is significantly lacking in the Speed department; good teammates to provide this include Nosepass and Chingling. Entry hazards support is also a necessity, as most of Beldum's counters are weak to Stealth Rock, most notably Fire-types such as Houndour and Ponyta. Phanpy and Baltoy can both set up Stealth Rock, and are able to remove the opponent's entry hazards with Rapid Spin.</p>"

However, don't let this slave's ugly face fool you as it does have two very special abilities in Simple and Unaware, allowing it to set up twice as fast as other sweepers and hurt the opponent efficiently, or to easily counter stat uppers, respectively. These unusual gifts from Arceus are the only reasons Bidoof is not completely outclassed by other Normal-type Pokemon, so abuse them to their fullest.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Unfortunately, Bidoof's movepool is not very deep, meaning it does not have many other options to choose from. Shadow Ball can be used on the Special Attacker set to hit Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon, but does not have much utility otherwise. Thunder Wave allows Bidoof to cripple faster Pokemon, and Superpower can be used on the Unaware set to take out Steel-type Pokemon such as Aron. Rock Smash is an option over it that doesn't lower Bidoof's Attack and Defense, but keep in mind that Rock Smash has only 40 Base Power, which is not very strong, even after a boost.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Bronzor can somewhat counter Bidoof as it resists its STAB, is neutral to Aqua Tail, and is able to set up Stealth Rock to weaken Bidoof in the long run. Gastly can outspeed and defeat Bidoof with Sludge Bomb. Though not a true counter, Croagunk checks Bidoof very well. A combination of Fake Out and Vacuum Wave can easily knock out Bidoof. Croagunk also outspeeds every set but the Baton Pass Reciever, meaning that it can do these without fear of Quick Attack. Finally, Magnemite can come in on anything but a Fighting-type attack, and hit Bidoof hard with Thunderbolt.</p>",

With just one Curse, Bidoof gets to 30 Attack and 22 Defense, which are quite intimidating stats indeed. STAB Quick Attack is a must due to Curse lowering Bidoof's already-pitiful Speed, as its priority will remedy the Speed loss. While Return does not have priority, it is very strong after a Curse, and even Pokemon who resist it will be hit hard. The final slot should be Aqua Tail to hit Rock-type Pokemon for super effective damage and to strike Ghost-types neutrally; together, Normal- and Water-type moves also have perfect neutral coverage in Little Cup.</p> <p>The EVs maximize its HP and Attack, and the rest allow it to take physical hits a bit better. Bronzor can take some hits, even after a Curse, and possibly 2HKO Bidoof back with Psychic, so Magnemite is a good teammate for Bidoof to have as it can trap Bronzor and take it out with STAB Thunderbolt. Fast special attacking Ghost-types such as Gastly and Drifloon can be trouble for Bidoof with their Normal immunity, so having a Pursuit user such as Stunky can help trap and eliminate them for the rest of the match.</p>"

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set focuses on boosting Bidoof's Special Attack, and hitting the opponents hard with powerful moves that offer a wide range of coverage. Charge Beam has a 70% (63% when factoring in accuracy) chance of boosting Bidoof's Special Attack from 14 to 28, more than enough to allow it to wreak havoc from there. Thunderbolt hits Mantyke and other Water-type Pokemon for good damage, Ice Beam defeats Dragon-type Pokemon such as Dratini, and Hidden Power Fighting allows it to hit Steel-types such as Magnemite for super effective damage.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Bidoof's HP and Special Attack stat, while giving it one Defense point. Oran Berry is the only suggested item because of Charge Beam's shakiness as it may not boost Bidoof's Special Attack or it could miss completely. Oran Berry will allow Bidoof to have more chances to set up. Once Bidoof has a boost, nothing can wall it; even 236 SpD Munchlax takes 53.3% - 66.7% from a boosted Hidden Power Fighting.</p>"

      "Unaware": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Unaware, which bypasses an opponent's stat boosts, Bidoof can easily counter dangerous threats such as Swords Dance Gligar and Krabby, Dragon Dance Bagon and Dratini, and many others. Ice Beam covers Gligar and other Dragon-types, while Thunderbolt destroys Pokemon such as Agility Mantyke and Swords Dance Krabby. Quick Attack is useful to finish off Pokemon that can survive the first attack. Finally, Return gives Bidoof a strong STAB move to deal more damage to specially-defensive Pokemon.</p> <p>The EVs are all invested into bulk, because most stat-uppers take a ton of damage from Bidoof's attacks without investment anyway. For example, Thunderbolt deals 80% - 100% to 36 HP Krabby and 90.9% - 109.1% to 76 HP Mantyke; Ice Beam does 87% - 121.7% to 0 HP / 0 SpD Gligar, 57.1% - 76.2% to 28 HP / 36 SpD Dratini, and 66.7% - 85.7% to Bagon. In sum, a combination of Stealth Rock, super effective move, and Quick Attack will take all of those Pokemon out. Oran Berry allows Bidoof to replenish health and counter more threats, while a Relaxed nature allows it to take hits easier. Its EV spread maximizes HP and Defense, while boosting its Special Defense by one point.</p>"

      "Baton Pass Receiver": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Simple, Bidoof doubles all the stat boosts that it gets, including those Baton Passed to it, turning Bidoof into a terrifying Baton Pass receiver. Normal and Water get perfect neutral coverage, allowing Bidoof to hit every Pokemon extremely hard. Note that stat drops are doubled too, so Intimidate will lower Bidoof's Attack by two when Baton Passed. Therefore, Gligar is the perfect Baton Passer to Bidoof because of Hyper Cutter, which prevents Intimidate from taking effect, as well as having the bulk to set up. Gligar has access to both Swords Dance and Agility, and if each move if used once, Bidoof will have +4 Attack and +4 Speed upon receiving the Baton Pass, which allows it to easily sweep through many teams. Substitute allows Bidoof to scout for dangerous moves, and once it's behind a Substitute, Bidoof is almost impossible to take out. Return is a powerful STAB attack that can KO almost every Pokemon that does not resist or have an immunity to it. Quick Attack has priority, and allows Bidoof to finish off opposing priority users such as Croagunk, provided they've been weakened enough.</p> <p>Oran Berry is used so Bidoof has an easier time setting up a Substitute, and allows it to stay around longer. After one Swords Dance and Agility boost, Bidoof reaches 42 Attack and 39 Speed, and can easily demolish teams. The EV spread maximizes Attack and Speed, and boosts its HP and Defense stat by one point, allowing it to take hits more easily. Dual screen support is greatly appreciated, allowing Gligar to set up much more easily, while helping reduce the damage taken when Bidoof is sent in.</p>"

Mud Slap can be used in the place of Growl, but that means that Kricketot will be unable to perform the \"Reverse Dragon Dance\" strategy. Snore is handy if your team needs a sleep absorber, as it allows Kricketot to dish out damage even in its sleep. Lastly, Uproar can be used in a similar manner to Salamence's Outrage, devastating everything in its path. However, Kricketot can be used as setup bait for Ghost-type Pokemon should this be the case.

        "description": "<p>This set, in all honesty, is the best that Kricketot gets. The basic strategy is to use String Shot on the opposing Pokemon as it attacks and brings Kricketot down to its Focus Sash. Kricketot can now outspeed--or Speed tie if the Pokemon has 19 or 20 Speed--and bring the opposing Pokemon down to 1 HP with Endeavor. Bug Bite provides not very effective coverage against Ghost-type Pokemon, namely Gastly and Duskull, and will steal their Oran Berries (should they carry one). Growl rounds off the set, allowing Kricketot to lower the Attack of any Pokemon. This can be used in conjunction with String Shot to effectively give the opponent a reverse Dragon Dance, which can be useful due to the offensive nature of the Little Cup tier.</p> <p>The EVs are simple: Kricketot's Attack and Speed stats are maxed, with a Jolly nature to ensure maximum Speed. Maximum Attack means that Bug Bite will pack a punch while also stealing Oran Berries. The remaining EVs are used to increase Kricketot's Defense stat by one point, allowing it to stomach certain physical hits.</p> <p>Ghost-type Pokemon are a big problem for Kricketot, as they are immune to Endeavor, ruining its glorious strategy. However, it's not all doom and gloom. Kricketot can lower the Speed stats of the incoming Ghost-types with String Shot, then switch into a Dark-type Pokemon such as Stunky or Houndour, allowing them to easily trap and kill the helpless Ghost-type with Pursuit. This strategy can be very effective, making Stunky and Houndour great assets to Kricketot. Dual screens support from a defensive Pokemon such as Bronzor is recommended if Kricketot intends to imploy the \"Reverse Dragon Dance\" strategy. An alternative EV spread of 236 HP / 36 Def / 236 SpD is also encouraged when using this strategy. Rapid Spin support from the likes of Tentacool or Pineco can be very helpful for Kricketot, meaning it can switch in safely without breaking its Focus Sash.</p>"

Shinx has a mere 45 base Speed, which allows it to outpace many Pokemon when Trick Room is in play. In addition, Shinx has two great abilities in Rivalry and Intimidate, the former possibly boosting the power of Shinx's moves.</p> <p>However, Shinx does have a few glaring weaknesses. The first one is its weakness to Ground and its poor defenses, making it difficult for Shinx to switch in safely. Also, its strongest physical STAB attacks are Thunder Fang and Spark, both of which have an incredibly low 65 Base Power. In addition, Shinx's movepool is fairly limited and does not include much useful high Base Power physical attacks. All in all, Shinx is a decent Pokemon to use, but finds a hard time getting a team slot in Little Cup.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>There aren't very many viable other options for Shinx, as its movepool is extremely shallow. A mixed Trick Room set could be possible, since Shinx's Special Attack stat is usable and its special movepool consisting of Thunderbolt, Hidden Power, and Signal Beam isn't half-bad. Shinx hits 22 Speed with a boosting nature and maximum Speed EVs with a Choice Scarf, but would lose a lot of power that it desperately needs. Return can be used as Shinx's strongest physical attack, though it has no super effective coverage whatsoever. Howl is Shinx's only reliable boosting move and can work with Quick Attack; however, Shinx would still be too weak to sweep due to its poor Speed and low Base Power attacks. Lastly, Magnet Rise is available to elude Diglett and other Ground-types, but they can still smash Shinx hard with their other attacks.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Shinx has a lot of counters due to its weak attacks and frail defenses. Bulky Ground-types, like Hippopotas, fare well against Shinx, as they can stave off Ice Fang and KO back with Earthquake while also having an immunity to Electric. Bronzor can take several Fire Fangs and KO back with Earthquake. Chinchou is a great counter, as it takes minimal damage from all of Shinx's attacks, can heal health from any Electric attack, and KO back with Surf. If Trick Room is not up, then the number of Pokemon that can counter Shinx rises exponentially. Pokemon with strong attacks, like Machop, Cubone, and Gastly, can easily KO Shinx with their STAB attacks.</p>",

This allows it to \"outspeed\" most other Pokemon in Trick Room. Although Thunder Fang has only 65 Base Power, it is Shinx's strongest physical STAB outside of Spark. Ice Fang hits most Ground-types for super effective damage, and scores an easy OHKO on most Gligar. Fire Fang hits Grass-, Ice-, Bug-, and Steel-types hard, and Crunch mashes Ghost- and Psychic-types for heavy damage. Iron Tail, on the other hand, strikes Rock- and Ice-types, but Crunch gets better overall coverage.</p> <p>A Brave nature raises Shinx's Attack while lowering its Speed simultaneously, which benefits this Shinx variant greatly. Life Orb pumps up Shinx's power, and Rivalry, if Shinx is the same gender as its opponent, stacks additional power on top of Life Orb. While Intimidate is an equally effective ability, most players do not switch the genders of their Pokemon. It should be noted that this is for simulator play only, as it would not apply on Wi-Fi, since on Wi-Fi, genders aren't automatically set to male. Since the default is male, Shinx will be getting a Rivalry boost quite often. In addition, the only exclusively female Pokemon in Little Cup are Nidoran-F, Happiny, and Smoochum - all of which are very uncommon. Also, Shinx does not lose power when facing genderless Pokemon like Bronzor. The EVs max out Shinx's Attack, and the rest boost its defenses. A 0 IV in HP is vital so that Shinx's base HP rounds down to 19, so it will only lose 1 HP from Life Orb recoil.</p> <p>Shinx absolutely needs Trick Room support in order to attempt a sweep. Trick Room users with Explosion are even better, as such teammates can allow Shinx to switch in for free. Stealth Rock support is also nice, but not necessary. Spark can be used over Thunder Fang due to its perfect accuracy, but Thunder Fang has a lower chance of paralysis and a chance of flinching the opponent. Paralysis is not good because the opponent would outspeed Shinx in Trick Room, and with Shinx's low defenses, the opposing Pokemon will be able to KO Shinx.</p>"

Thunder Fang pairs well with Thunder Wave, as it has a chance of flinching the opponent. Ice Fang hits most Ground-types for super effective damage; additionally, Ice Fang allows Shinx to potentially KO Gligar on the switch. Crunch does big damage to Ghost- and Psychic-types, while Fire Fang hits most Steel-types. Finally, Quick Attack gives Shinx a priority attack which allows it to pick off a few faster threats. Attack and Speed are maximized, and the remaining EVs give Shinx an extra point in each of its defenses.</p> <p>Pokemon that enjoy having paralyzed opponents work well with this set. Krabby and Cubone are great partners for this reason, as they will now have an easier time setting up Swords Dance, and since paralyzed opponents remove the need for Speed, these teammates will have an simpler time ripping teams apart. In addition, Pokemon that can beat Hippopotas and Gligar, the two biggest checks to this set, are appreciated. Snover works very well, as it can dispatch both of them with STAB Blizzard. In addition, Snover has access to Swords Dance which complements Shinx's Thunder Wave support.

A Life Orb set with three attacks and Rest is an option, but Budew's frailty usually lets it down. Synthesis is an option over Rest on the Spikes set, but it is usually a bad idea since it only heals 25% of Budew's health in rain, which is fairly common in Little Cup. Although Budew also has access to Swords Dance, it lacks the Attack stat and the physical movepool to abuse it.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Although Budew is easily countered, it is still fairly hard to switch into due to its access to Stun Spore and Sleep Powder. However, if you can avoid the potential status ailments, Fire-types like Ponyta and Houndour can easily take care of Budew with their STAB attacks, despite taking a hefty amount of damage from Sludge Bomb. Gligar with Aerial Ace also counters Budew easily.</p> <p>Diglett is Budew's worst nightmare if it manages to switch in while Budew is using Rest. Due to its ability, Arena Trap, Diglett can prevent Budew from switching out, effectively making it a sitting duck. Munchlax doesn't mind paralysis and can easily tank most of Budew's attacks while KOing Budew with its STAB move of choice. Offensively oriented Water-types that pack Ice Beam also cause Budew trouble, but are hit super effectively by Budew's STAB and therefore are not notable threats. Strong Psychic-type attacks from the likes of Abra and friends utterly destroy Budew; however, most Psychic-type Pokemon abhor paralysis and are OHKOed or 2HKOed by either of Budew's STABs. Grimer and Croagunk resist both of Budew's STABs and can heavily damage it if they pack super effective coverage moves like Fire Punch and Ice Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>Budew is one of the select few Pokemon in Little Cup that can set up Spikes. Unlike some of the other Spikers in Little Cup, Budew possesses good typing and bulk, as well as decent Speed, which allows it to set up effectively. Budew's access to Natural Cure allows it to adopt a sort of Spike-and-run strategy; it does this by Spiking as much as it can, Resting off any damage, and then switching out, recovering from sleep automatically due to Natural Cure. However, Budew isn't limited solely to providing entry hazard support: it also has access to Stun Spore and sports resistances to common attacking types in Little Cup, such as Water and Fighting. Using these tools, Budew can easily spread paralysis throughout the opposing team and deal good damage with either of its STAB moves of choice.</p> <p>Both Energy Ball and Sludge Bomb are viable options for the second moveslot. Energy Ball provides Budew with a reliable STAB move that possesses decent super effective coverage on the many Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types that inhabit Little Cup. Sludge Bomb, on the other hand, provides better neutral coverage and has higher Base Power. Stun Spore allows Budew to cripple its counters and either KO them with its STAB move of choice or switch to an appropriate counter. Sleep Powder may be tempting to include in the set in Stun Spore's place, but it is illegal in conjunction with Spikes. Rest is the icing on the cake; Rest paired with Natural Cure provides Budew with a reliable recovery move that restores all of its health with no real drawbacks besides the necessity of switching out.</p> <p>This set can also work well as a lead. However, if Budew isn't in the lead position, then it can switch in and set up on a variety of Choiced Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mankey or Machop and Choice Band Remoraid. It can also set up on some variants of Chinchou that lack Ice Beam, as well as Croagunk that lack Ice Punch. Rest allows for a larger margin of error when using Budew, as you can fully heal Budew's health and switch out when it's badly hurt; however, Budew cannot endure attacks from hard-hitting Pokemon for long, so you must play cautiously in order to preserve it. Duskull makes for a great partner as it blocks Rapid Spin and is immune to Normal- and Ground-type assaults. It also deals with Gligar effectively, which would otherwise trouble Budew.</p> <p>Budew's Stun Spore allows it to cripple the fast sweepers that it lures, such as Houndour, Ponyta, Gligar, and Diglett. Slow, hard-hitting Pokemon such as Aron and Omanyte enjoy having these Pokemon paralyzed, and therefore make effective partners. Water-type Pokemon like Chinchou also pair well with Budew as they provide an answer to Fire-types. Chinchou, thanks to its strong STAB Thunderbolt, also has the bonus of being able to deal with opposing Water-types that sport Ice Beam.</p> <p>Although what is listed above is generally the most effective way to utilize Budew, there are a couple of other options. A Bold nature is advised on this set because it augments Budew's Defense stat, allowing Budew to switch in on physical Fighting-type moves more reliably; however, a Calm nature is a perfectly viable choice as it allows Budew to take special hits even better. Although Stun Spore is a great support move, it can be switched out for Sludge Bomb if you wish for Budew to have a reliable secondary STAB, Shadow Ball if you want Budew to be able to quickly deal with Ghost-types like Gastly, or Hidden Power Ice if you wish for Budew to deal with Gligar. An alternative EV spread of 196 HP / 36 SpA / 36 SpD / 236 Spe with a Calm or Bold nature can be used in lieu of the one above in order to capitalize on Budew's above-average Speed stat. Running 236 Speed EVs with a neutral nature gives Budew 15 Speed, allowing it to surpass the cluttered 14 Speed benchmark. If you wish to utilize Budew in the lead position, then this EV spread is usually a superior choice than the one displayed in the set.</p>"

  "Cranidos": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Cranidos must have inherited some of the power from the meteor that rendered other dinosaurs extinct, because he certainly hits like one. Cranidos's insane base 125 Attack is the highest in Little Cup, and with powerful moves like Earthquake, Stone Edge, and Head Smash backing it up, he is one of the hardest hitters in Little Cup. Cranidos's main problem is that he's weak to three of the most common priority moves in Little Cup: Vacuum Wave, Aqua Jet, and Bullet Punch. Those average defenses won't protect him from an onslaught of super effective priority moves, which is why it is best to either keep Cranidos hidden until your opponent has revealed their team, or to use a hit-and-run strategy instead.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Rock Slide can be used as Cranidos's main STAB move if you are worried about Stone Edge and Head Smash's accuracy. A normal Swords Dance or Swords Dance + Rock Polish set could have potential, but Swords Dance Cranidos is rather slow and it is tough finding time to set up both Swords Dance and Rock Polish. Fire Punch and Thunder Punch may look appealing, but STAB Stone Edge is as strong as a super effective Thunder Punch or Fire Punch. Pursuit has the merit of catching fleeing Pokemon, which is quite common since frail Pokemon will rarely want to stay in on Cranidos, especially Choice Scarf variants. Choice Band Cranidos is ridiculously strong, but its poor Speed makes it tough to use. The best way to use it would be to pay homage to RBY and try to paralyze the opponent's team. Due to Cranidos's frailty, Focus Sash is a great item to use if you can keep entry hazards and Hail away.</p> <p>Cranidos also has an excellent special movepool, but if you are using any special attack other than Ice Beam on Cranidos, you are using it incorrectly. Swagger could be used for an interesting Swaggersaurus set, but Swagger is a poor move in Little Cup. Lastly, Cranidos does get Stealth Rock, but there are better Rock-types for setting up Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Trying to counter Cranidos comes with the immediate problem of switching into someone with the same base Attack stat as Gyarados. Against Choice Scarf Cranidos, Bronzor can switch into Zen Headbutt or Stone Edge without taking much damage and threaten Cranidos with Flash Cannon or Earthquake. Gligar and other Flying-types can switch in on Earthquake without taking any damage and force Cranidos to switch. There are very few Pokemon, however, who can safely switch into Head Smash. Phanpy and Hippopotas are on the top of that short list, and can threaten Cranidos with Earthquake. Rock Polish Cranidos is pretty much only countered by bulky Ground-types, but even they have to watch out for Ice Beam. Machop can work if Cranidos isn't running Zen Headbutt. Trick Room Cranidos can be countered by Hippopotas and Phanpy, although they need to watch out for Ice Beam and Swords Dance-boosted Earthquakes.</p> <p>Revenge killing Cranidos is much easier than switching into him. Croagunk's Vacuum Wave does a number to Cranidos. Be careful if sandstorm is brewing, since Cranidos can survive and OHKO with Earthquake or Zen Headbutt. Magby can KO Cranidos with Mach Punch, and Machop can use Bullet Punch. Buizel, Totodile, Carvanha, and Kabuto can all OHKO Cranidos with Aqua Jet after Stealth Rock damage. Faster Choice Scarf users, like Mankey, can revenge kill the Choice Scarf set.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Cranidos is one of the most powerful revenge killers and hit-and-run attackers in the metagame thanks to his excellent ability, Mold Breaker.</p> <p>Head Smash is one of the most powerful physical attacks in Little Cup, capable of OHKOing defensive juggernauts such as maximum HP Gligar 74% of the time when Stealth Rock is in play. Head Smash's sheer power makes it your main STAB move, at least for a while--Cranidos will be racking up a lot of recoil damage from Head Smash. Stone Edge does not suffer from recoil and is generally the safer move to use for Cranidos when his health starts to drop. Earthquake provides great coverage alongside Cranidos's Rock-type STAB, and due to Mold Breaker, common Levitate users such as Bronzor and Gastly will find themselves unable to take advantage of Cranidos being locked into it. This allows Cranidos to abuse Earthquake near endlessly, only fearing a Flying-type switch-in, which is an unlikely situation given the threat of switching into Cranidos's STAB Rock-type attacks. Zen Headbutt rounds off the set, hitting Fighting-types such as Machop harder than the other moves.</p> <p>Another advantage of Cranidos is that he reaches 22 Speed with an Adamant nature, allowing him to outspeed a large number of Choice Scarf users who reach only 21 Speed. This further increases Cranidos's efficiency as a late-game sweeper, as common 21 Speed Choice Scarf users will be unable to end Cranidos's rampage, allowing him to turn into a formidable sweeper.</p> <p>A Choice Scarf Cranidos sweep can only be stopped by three things: priority, faster Choice Scarf users, and bulky Ground-types such as Phanpy. Common priority users such as Kabuto, Carvanha, and Croagunk should be removed before Cranidos sets foot in the arena. Kabuto and Carvanha can be eliminated with a Croagunk of your own, who can sponge the Water-type attacks threatening to end Cranidos's rampage, while Gligar can swiftly deal with opposing Croagunk. Gligar should watch out for a stray Ice Punch from Croagunk, however. Gligar is also a great teammate defensively, being immune to and resisting the Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, respectively, that Cranidos is weak to, although the shared Water-type weakness is not appreciated. Gligar can also set up Stealth Rock, which nullifies Focus Sash, aiding in Cranidos's sweep. Alternately, one may use Bronzor in order to set up Stealth Rock and dual screens, while walling Phanpy, who is the best Cranidos counter in the game. Some of the faster Choice Scarf users are Gligar, Mankey, Houndour, and Gastly, who can all OHKO Cranidos. Gligar and Mankey are again walled by Bronzor, whereas Houndour and Gastly can be removed by Munchlax. Mantyke is a good teammate in general with Cranidos since he resists Vacuum Wave, Aqua Jet, and Bullet Punch.</p>"
      },
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>While Choice Scarf is good for hit-and-run attacking and revenge killing, Rock Polish Cranidos is great late-game when Pokemon like Croagunk and Carvanha have been removed from play. With 15 Speed, Cranidos outspeeds every Choice Scarf user except for three - Elekid, Diglett, and Voltorb - all of whom Cranidos ties with after a Rock Polish.</p> <p>Rock Polish boosts Cranidos's Speed to the point where he can be can be an effective sweeper. Stone Edge is Cranidos's main STAB move, which does a large chunk of damage factoring in Cranidos's 24 Attack stat. Earthquake provides good coverage with Cranidos's Rock-type STAB moves, and with Mold Breaker, it can be used to OHKO Gastly, Koffing, and Bronzor. The last option is a toss-up. Zen Headbutt is great for hitting Machop super effectively. Ice Beam can be used for more reliable damage on Gligar, especially in sandstorm, where Sand Veil and unreliable accuracy make Stone Edge a poor choice. Crunch is used to hit Duskull for an OHKO, although a weakened Duskull can be KOed easily by Stone Edge.</p> <p>If you are running Ice Beam, a Naughty nature should be used so you don't lower Special Attack. Otherwise, Adamant is the nature of choice for Cranidos. Life Orb grants Cranidos even more power; however, Oran Berry is also a great option, allowing Cranidos to potentially take an extra neutral hit, which is valuable since it needs time to set up Rock Polish.</p> <p>Much like the Choice Scarf set, Rock Polish Cranidos should have Kabuto, Carvanha, Croagunk, and other Pokemon with priority moves eliminated before it attempts to sweep. Croagunk can sponge up Kabuto's and Carvanha's Aqua Jet and hit back with Vacuum Wave. He is also effective at taking out Buizel and Totodile. Gligar can help take down Machop and Croagunk with Earthquake or Aerial Ace. Mantyke makes a great teammate since he can switch in on Phanpy's Earthquake and OHKO with Hydro Pump. He also resists Vacuum Wave, Bullet Punch, and Aqua Jet, and with Hidden Power Flying, he can take down Croagunk as well. Ground-types are trouble for Rock Polish Cranidos, so a strong Water-type like the previously mentioned Mantyke and Buizel are great teammates. Rock Polish Cranidos appreciates dual screens and Stealth Rock even more than the Choice Scarf set since he needs to set up. Bronzor and Turtwig make good teammates because of this, since Cranidos can switch in on Fire-type moves often used to KO them.</p>"

      "Trick Room Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Cranidos isn't exactly \"slow\", but he reaches a low enough Speed to function well in Trick Room. Priority moves still go first in Trick Room, so Cranidos still has to worry about moves like Vacuum Wave and Bullet Punch.</p> <p>Stone Edge is your main STAB move. While it may not be as strong as Head Smash, Life Orb and Head Smash recoil add up very quickly, which makes it an inferior option. Earthquake gets the famous EdgeQuake coverage, and is the perfect choice for Cranidos's second moveslot. Zen Headbutt scores an OHKO on Machop, who can threaten Cranidos with Bullet Punch and Dynamic Punch. Many options can be used in the last moveslot. Ice Beam can be used to OHKO Gligar with Stealth Rock up. Head Smash can also OHKO defensive Gligar, and is a great move to use when Trick Room is ending so Cranidos can go kamikaze and KO himself and the opponent; with a double KO, you can switch to your next Pokemon to set up Trick Room without switching into an attack. Swords Dance is kind of a gamble, but the payoff is huge; every Pokemon in Little Cup is OHKOed by one of Cranidos's moves after a boost. However, Trick Room means you only have about 3 turns to attack with that boost before it wears off. Crunch OHKOes Duskull, who could otherwise threaten Cranidos with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>The EVs give Cranidos max HP and max Attack, with an additional point in Special Defense. With zero IVs and a Brave nature, Cranidos reaches a low Speed of 9. Life Orb is recommended over Oran Berry unless Cranidos is using Head Smash or Swords Dance. Oran Berry will help sponge up Head Smash recoil and hopefully provide Cranidos with some healing after it uses Swords Dance.</p> <p>Setting up Trick Room is the first order of business required for this set to work. Levitate Bronzor is the best option, since it can set up both Trick Room and Stealth Rock, both of which aid in Cranidos's sweep. Baltoy can also set up both Trick Room and Stealth Rock, but Cranidos and Baltoy share quite a few weaknesses, so that could be a problem. Shuppet and Smoochum are great leads to set up Trick Room for Cranidos. Slowpoke is a great Trick Room sweeper to use alongside Cranidos for a number of reasons. Slowpoke can set up Trick Room itself, but he can also use his bulk and typing to switch into Vacuum Wave, Mach Punch, Bullet Punch, and Aqua Jet, all of which threaten Cranidos's sweep greatly. Trapinch can trap Pokemon like Magby and Croagunk and hit them with a STAB Earthquake, so they can't threaten Cranidos with their priority moves. This makes Trapinch a good Pokemon to use alongside Cranidos inside a Trick Room.</p>"

Oftentimes, however, its mediocre Speed and offenses prevent it from taking on a truly threatening role on a team. But whoever said this was an entirely bad thing? Shieldon's defensive prowess and access to supporting moves such as Stealth Rock and Rain Dance make the little Shield Pokemon an excellent supporting player on most Little Cup teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Due to Shieldon's mediocre offenses and Speed, it doesn't have many options when it comes to its offensive capabilities in the tier, although it does have access to a couple of decent offensive stat-up moves. Rock Polish can help cure Shieldon of its mediocre Speed, but this is not recommended as Shieldon would still possess lackluster offenses. Similarly, a Metal Sound or Metal Burst set can be utilized, but again, when you factor in Shieldon's poor offenses, these options are lackluster. If you wish to include other forms of STAB in Shieldon's moveset, moves such as Iron Head and Flash Cannon can be used, but they offer redundant coverage. Other than providing Stealth Rock support, Shieldon can also provide Rain Dance support which can be a valuable asset to teams revolving around sweepers such as Horsea, Mantyke, and Omanyte.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Diglett, Magnemite, and even Wynaut are all effective counters to Shieldon as they can easily OHKO or 2HKO it with their STAB or super effective attacks, provided that they don't switch into a super effective attack themselves. In Wynaut's case, prediction is especially necessary to win. Chinchou is also a great counter, as not only is it immune to Thunderbolt, but it is also resistant to Ice Beam and Flamethrower so it can annihilate any Shieldon set foolish enough to not carry Earthquake. Similar to Chinchou, Munchlax can also wall Shieldon courtesy of its gargantuan HP and above-average defenses.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Shieldon's sturdy defenses and access to a great supporting move, Stealth Rock, allow it to effectively play the role of a supporter on most Little Cup teams. Shieldon can also check many strong and common threats of the Little Cup metagame, such as Dragon Dance Dratini, and this should definitely be taken into account when deciding whether or not to reserve a spot for Shieldon on your team.</p> <p>Although Stealth Rock is usually found as a staple on supporting variants of Shieldon, it should be noted that Stone Edge can be used over Stealth Rock if if you want Shieldon to do decent damage to Snover, who would otherwise wall the entire set. Flamethrower can be used for the same reason and possesses better accuracy, but it isn't boosted by STAB. Earthquake is used to easily KO even the bulkiest of Houndour, and the EVs guarantee that Shieldon will survive a combination of Crunch and Fire Blast from the standard MixDour set. Earthquake also takes down Magnemite, who will often switch into Shieldon, expecting an easy kill. Ice Beam allows Shieldon to take down offensive variants of Dratini and Thunderbolt is used to super effectively hit Water-types as well as forming the deadly BoltBeam combination with Ice Beam. It should be noted though that Magnet Rise is a viable option over Thunderbolt as it will allow dealing with Diglett much easier. Oran Berry is the recommended item, as it will help extend Shieldon's longevity, but a Shed Shell can be used if Shieldon fears being trapped by Diglett and Wynaut. Shed Shell can also help Shieldon evade Magnemite, although it is easily dealt with even without the use of Shed Shell.</p>"

  "Buizel": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Buizel can be one of the most devastating Pokemon in Little Cup for good reasons. With a positive Speed nature and maximum Speed EV investment, Buizel hits 19 Speed, easily outspeeding most of the metagame, as well as tying with many others. With the rain up, its Speed doubles, making it the fastest Pokemon at +2 in Little Cup. In addition, it can Baton Pass both Bulk Up and Agility, and its good defensive stats (factoring in defensive EVs and Bulk Up's Defense boost) and Speed allow it to perform this job pretty well.</p> <p>However, one cannot say that Buizel is without faults, because it most certainly does face some problems. Though Buizel has good offensive and Baton Pass support potential, it usually has to pick between offense and bulk, leaving it deficient in at least one. Despite these downfalls, Buizel can certainly be a great addition to your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Buizel's options are pretty much limited to the sets listed. It can run a decent special or mixed set, but they both are inferior options when compared to a pure physical set. A physical Choice set may seem viable, but the power difference between Choice Band and Life Orb in Little Cup is pretty negligible. An Agility set, in tandem with Substitute and a Liechi Berry, might sound interesting in theory, but Buizel would be easily beaten by priority.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Although Buizel has a lot of offensive potential, it does have some hard counters. For one, Croagunk stops the first set cold, as long as it can avoid a predicted Return as it switches in. Phazers, albeit rare, can shut the Baton Pass set down if they can avoid being KOed by Aqua Jet and Return. Chinchou can beat any Buizel one-on-one, as it isn't even 2HKOed by Return (factoring in its Oran Berry). Snover is a great check to Buizel, as it can easily take a Waterfall or Aqua Jet, and only fears a predicted Brick Break. In addition, Snover's ability kicks up a hailstorm, which ends Buizel's sweep in the rain. Most bulky Grass-types, including Exeggcute, also fare well against any Buizel not carrying Ice Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rain Dance Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This is Buizel's primary sweeping set. With only a bit of support, this set can cut through unprepared teams like a hot knife through butter. As the set name implies, this set best works in the rain. Waterfall is Buizel's main means of attacking, with decent Base Power, STAB, and perfect accuracy. Aqua Jet allows Buizel to also function as a revenge killer outside of rain, picking off faster, weakened threats before they can attack. Return pairs well with the previous moves, as the combination of Water and Normal is unresisted in this metagame. Finally, what goes into the last moveslot boils down to what you want Buizel to hit harder. Bulk Up is the primary option, as Buizel appreciates the extra boost in power, but Ice Punch is a decent substitute because it hits Dragon-types such as Dratini and Bagon harder in the rain, even OHKOing the former. Outside of rain, Ice Punch hits Gligar harder than Waterfall, though it will only OHKO the defensive variants 50% of the time. Finally, Brick Break guarantees an OHKO on Carvanha, and outside the rain, does more damage to Pokemon weak to Fighting, such as Aron and Munchlax. A Life Orb is essential on this set, giving Buizel the extra power that it needs to sweep efficiently. The EVs maximize Buizel's Attack and Speed, and the remainder is used to give Buizel an extra point in Special Defense.</p> <p>This set loves Rain Dance support, because Buizel needs the extra power on its Water-type attacks the Speed increase for sweeping. Six turns of sweeping is generally enough for Buizel to tear holes in the opponent's team. Great Rain Dance supporters include, but are definitely not limited to: Voltorb, Bronzor, and Drifloon. This set also greatly appreciates Stealth Rock support, as it can turn numerous 2HKOs into OHKOs. For example, Buizel can OHKO Carvanha with Return if Stealth Rock is up, so it no longer has to rely on Brick Break for the guaranteed KO, though it should be noted that Buizel would be switching into Carvanha, not the opposite. In addition, with Stealth Rock on the field, Buizel 2HKOes Swift Swim Mantyke with the combination of Aqua Jet and Return.</p> <p>Though this set has great offensive potential, it still has flaws and solid counters. For one, Snover simultaneously resists Water-type attacks and puts an end to Buizel's rain. As long as Snover does not switch into Brick Break, it can OHKO Buizel with STAB Energy Ball. Mantyke can revenge kill this set with Hidden Power Electric. Mixed Priority Abuser Croagunk absorbs all Water-type attacks aimed at it, and can KO Buizel with Fake Out and Sucker Punch, but only guarantees itself an OHKO if Buizel has switched into Stealth Rock and taken at least one turn of Life Orb recoil damage. Munchlax can take on Snover any day of the week, and can easily revenge kill Mantyke. Bronzor is a great teammate for Buizel if Croagunk is a problem - it can take any attack that Croagunk can dish out and OHKO back with Psychic.</p>"

      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>The purpose of this set is to support the rest of the team with stat boosts. However, Buizel is capable of sweeping by itself after netting a couple of boosts. The first slot is what Buizel wants to pass - if the intended recipient needs Attack, then choose Bulk Up. If Speed is needed, then go with Agility. Baton Pass is absolutely essential for this set to work. In addition, Buizel can \"dry pass\" to scout for its switch-in. The third slot should complement Buizel's first move. If Bulk Up was chosen, then Aqua Jet is the desired move, allowing Buizel to strike first with a powerful blow. If Agility is being used, then Waterfall should be paired up with it, because Buizel appreciates the extra power. Return pairs well with either attacking move. Oran Berry gives Buizel extra longevity, which allows it to possibly get in a few more boosts before having to Baton Pass. The nature and Speed EVs allow Buizel to still tie other Pokemon in the 19 speed tier, while the remaining EVs maximize its ability to take hits.</p> <p>Stealth Rock support is nice, but not really necessary. Sandshrew and Phanpy can set it up and also take Electric-type attacks aimed at Buizel, though both of them share a Grass-type weakness with Buizel. Hippopotas can also set up Stealth Rock, but Buizel doesn't enjoy the sandstorm Hippopotas summons. However, if the sandstorm isn't a concern, Hippopotas partners well with Buizel. Rapid Spin support is more important to this set, as Buizel will be constantly switching in and out, looking for an opportunity to successfully boost then pass. Sandshrew is a prime example of this, and also sports an immunity to Electric. However, Sandshrew, like Hippopotas, also shares a Grass-type weakness with Buizel. A good recipient for this set is Elekid. It doesn't take much damage from most Electric-type attacks, and appreciates the extra Attack or Speed.</p>"

Chlorophyll is probably the only reason to use Cherubi; when the sun is active, Cherubi becomes one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, and with its decent Special Attack, it can easily punch holes in the opponent's team. Outside of the sun, Cherubi isn't worth using. It's slow, frail, and doesn't have anything special to make up for these shortcomings. Things could be worse for Cherubi, however, it could have measly base 30 defenses like Bellsprout, or even poor stats all around like Seedot. Cherubi is a great Pokemon if you're playing for fun, but there are better choices for a competitive team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Cherubi's movepool is disappointing, to say the least. Aromatherapy can rid Cherubi and its teammates of status, but Cherubi is incredibly frail and unlikely to pull it off. Grass Whistle can be used to put an opponent to sleep, but its shaky 55% accuracy is a major turn off. A Swords Dance set with Seed Bomb and Return may be appealing, but it doesn't provide great coverage and isn't very powerful. A Life Orb can be used for more power, though it comes with recoil damage, and it decreases the sun to 5 turns. Finally, an Oran Berry can restore half of Cherubi's health, but it isn't very useful outside of restoring damage from entry hazards.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>The best way to counter Cherubi is to change the weather. Without active sun, Cherubi is essentially useless, and very slow. Snover activates permanent hail upon switching in, which damages Cherubi every turn. Fire-types such as Houndour and Ponyta resist Grass- and Fire-type moves, and they can KO Cherubi with their STAB moves. Dragon-types such as Dratini also resist Cherubi's STAB, and they can proceed to KO with their powerful moves, or simply set up with Dragon Dance. Mantyke and Drowzee have high Special Defense, and they can wall Cherubi all day. Finally, if worst comes to worst, just Taunt it. Cherubi won't be doing much without the sun, and it won't be able to recover or leech your health either.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sunny Day": {
        "description": "<p>The idea behind this set is to use Chlorophyll to boost Cherubi's Speed. When the sun is active, Cherubi reaches 26 Speed, which is enough to outrun Choice Scarf Mankey, as well as Carvanha and Houndour. Cherubi can either set up Sunny Day itself, or have a teammate do it. A Heat Rock prolongs the sun, giving Cherubi eight turns to decimate the opponent's team. Solar Beam is Cherubi's strongest attack, and has an amazing Base Power of 180 after STAB. Hidden Power Fire is boosted by the sun, and it deals a great amount of damage to Bronzor, Chikorita, and Snorunt. In the last slot, Growth can be used to raise Cherubi's Special Attack, while Synthesis is used for recovery.</p> <p>The EVs are fairly straightforward, maximizing Cherubi's Speed and Special Attack with the remaining 76 EVs in HP for an extra point. Grass Knot or Energy Ball can be used in the last slot if you want a reliable option when it isn't sunny, and Giga Drain gets the best of both worlds; it damages the opponent outside of the sun while restoring Cherubi's health. Leech Seed is another option in the last slot to weaken opponents and leech some health, which works well against opponents with high HP.</p> <p>Pokemon who can set up entry hazards make good teammates. Bronzor and Nosepass can set up Stealth Rock, Snorunt can set up Spikes, and Spinarak can set up Toxic Spikes. Pineco, while weak to Fire-type attacks, can set up all three, and can even provide Rapid Spin support. Gastly makes a good teammate as it can block any attempts to remove the entry hazards with Rapid Spin.</p> <p>Due to its frailty, Cherubi appreciates Pokemon who can set up the sun. Oddish, Hoppip, and Bronzor are all fine choices due to their bulk, typing, and in Hoppip's case, Speed. Fire-types, such as Ponyta and Houndour, are also good partners as they benefit from the sun boosting their STAB moves, and Flash Fire enables them to switch into the Fire-type moves aimed at Cherubi.</p>"

It doesn't have much of a movepool, but it has enough for it to pull through. One of its most obvious flaws is that it is outclassed by almost all other Water-types, and it doesn't get access to Hydro Pump. Its resistance to Water-type attacks shouldn't be underlooked either. Overall, this cute little slug can come in handy as a revenge killer due to its nice coverage and few weaknesses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Shellos gets Curse, but not Waterfall or Aqua Tail, or even a decent physical STAB. It can make use of Icy Wind if lowering the opponent's Speed is of priority. Amnesia is there, but not recommended as it does get Recover, which is better to tank hits with, which it might use if the correct amount of EVs are put in. Rain Dance is another option. To counter Mantyke, Ancient Power could be used because of its secondary effect, but Hidden Power Electric gets the job done better.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Munchlax is arguably the best counter to Shellos. It can hit Shellos with a STAB Return and sponge all of its attacks. Mantyke can come in on anything but a Hidden Power Electric, which hits for hard damage especially if Stealth Rock is up. Grass-types easily beat up Shellos if it is not locked into Ice Beam. Snover deserves special mention here for its neutrality to it, although it must watch out for the rare but possible Hidden Power Fire.</p>",

Its STAB Surf hits other Pokemon fairly hard, while the other attacks are for coverage. Ice Beam hits Flying- and Grass-types hard. Earth Power provides coverage against Electric-types such as Chinchou. Hidden Power Grass nails Water-type Pokemon, particularly Water / Ground-types such as Barboach. Hidden Power Electric can be used to hit Mantyke, but Hidden Power Grass is the recommended option. The given EVs are really just to increase Shellos's Speed and Special Attack stats as much as possible.</p> <p>This set needs Stealth Rock support so that less Pokemon will be inclined to switch into Shellos. Good partners for Shellos include those that can remove Munchlax, its number 1 counter. Fighting-types such as Mankey and Machop can carry out this task with relative ease. If Shellos isn't running Hidden Power Grass, it will lose to Water / Ground-type Pokemon badly. Both Snover and Shroomish can take care of all of the aforementioned Water / Ground-type Pokemon.</p>"

However, Drifloon's unique ability, Unburden, allows him to double his speed while gaining HP courtesy of Oran Berry or boosting his Special Attack courtesy of Petaya Berry. With a Speed boost under his belt, Drifloon can be a very threatening sweeper in Little Cup.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Aside from the listed options, Drifloon has few other notable moves. Charge Beam is an alternate option to boost Drifloon's Special Attack. Hidden Power Ground can be used to hit Stunky hard, but leaves Drifloon very weak to Munchlax. Baton Pass can be used to send Drifloon's boosts to other sweepers. Be aware that the Unburden boost cannot be Baton Passed, however. Thunder Wave can be used on a double status set with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Once Drifloon is set up, it is very hard to stop. Munchlax does a good job at stopping Drifloon, but can be shut down by a boosted Hidden Power Fighting or a Will-o-wisp. Stunky does the same and threatens Drifloon with Sucker Punch, but again loses to the SubWisp set. In general, Sucker Punch users greatly endanger Drifloon. If Drifloon does not have a Substitute or an Unburden boost, Drifloon can be easily outsped and KOed by Pokemon like Gastly and Staryu.</p> <p>Both lead sets have problems with Snover, as previously stated. The second lead set also is stopped by Buneary. In general, things that can avoid taking Destiny Bond with Toxic or Will-O-Wisp do a good job at countering the lead sets.</p>",

It allows Drifloon to reach a Special Attack stat of 24 after one boost and an astounding 32 after two. Drifloon can also set up on weak special attackers and Sucker Punch users with Calm Mind. Shadow Ball is Drifloon's best STAB attack and has perfect neutral coverage when combined with Hidden Power Fighting. In the final slot, Substitute gives Drifloon an easier setup by protecting him from attacks and status. It also eases prediction during Drifloon's sweep, especially against Sucker Punch users. Substitute is also useful for reliably activating Unburden. Thunderbolt can be used to hit Stunky for massive damage and also hits Water- and Flying-types hard.</p> <p>The EVs give Drifloon enough Speed to reach 30 Speed after Unburden, which lets Drifloon outrun all +1 Pokemon in Little Cup except for Diglett, Elekid, and Voltorb. The spread also maximizes Drifloon's low Special Attack while maintaining respectable bulk. Explosion or Destiny Bond can be used in the final spot to let Drifloon go out with a bang.</p> <p>Wynaut is a great partner because he can Encore attacks that Drifloon is resistant or immune to so that Drifloon can set up. Stunky is quite problematic for Drifloon, so using a Gligar is advisable to counter Stunky.</p>"

Shadow Ball is Drifloon's STAB attack of choice again. Will-O-Wisp is primarily for Munchlax and Stunky, neither of whom will enjoy a burn. Thunderbolt is the coverage move on this set because unboosted Hidden Power Fighting being very weak.</p> <p>The EVs on this set give Drifloon 28 HP so that Unburden can be activated in two Substitutes instead of three. The Speed EVs allow Drifloon to reach 30 Speed after Unburden, and the rest is dumped into Special Attack.</p> <p>Since this set does not have the power of the first set, it has different counters. Chinchou is a problem since Oran versions only suffer a 3HKO from Shadow Ball while OHKOing back with Thunderbolt. Munchlax comfortably walls Chinchou and can hit back with Earthquake or STAB Return.</p>"

      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<p>While this set does not have the bulk of the previous two sets, it has a much easier time setting up and sweeping in the end-game.</p> <p>Substitute allows Drifloon to reduce his health by 25% each time, eventually activating Petaya Berry and Unburden at the same time. With this Drifloon reaches 24 Special Attack and 28 Speed, outrunning and hitting hard most of the metagame. Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting provide perfect neutral coverage. Thunderbolt gives Drifloon better coverage, while Calm Mind can allow Drifloon to gain additional boosts if the opportunity arises.</p> <p>The EVs give Drifloon 28 HP, which allows him to activate Petaya Berry in three Substitutes instead of four. Due to the fact that this Drifloon needs to run 28 HP and the IV loss from Hidden Power Fighting, only 14 Speed is run. The only loss is tying with 19 Speed Choice Scarfers, who are rather rare. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack. Explosion or Destiny Bond can be used in the last slot if you have another sweeper that can greatly benefit from the removal of a troublesome Pokemon. Sucker Punch is also an option to thwart the attempts of opposing Sucker Punch users.</p> <p>Munchlax and Stunky create problems for this set. They can hit Drifloon hard with Pursuit or in the case of Munchlax, Ice Punch as well. A Lure Gastly can significantly help this set, being able to lure out Munchlax and Stunky and use Explosion on them.</p>"

      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>This uncommon lead set allows Drifloon to almost always get one kill, and sometimes even two or three. It uses a combination of Unburden and moves such as Destiny Bond, Explosion, and Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Being a Ghost-type, Drifloon is immune to the common Fake Out. In addition, the Focus Sash protects it from Meowth's Bite and Aipom's Shadow Claw. Drifloon can then Destiny Bond or Explode to take out the lead. Additionally, Drifloon can sometimes take out leads on its own using Shadow Ball, Sucker Punch, or Thunderbolt. An example is Kabuto, who is KOed by Thunderbolt followed by Sucker Punch. Drifloon can then get another kill using Unburden and Destiny Bond or Explosion.</p> <p>The EVs and IVs are used to get Drifloon down to his sash by minimizing his defenses. Maximum speed is run to outspeed Kabuto so that it cannot break Drifloon's sash unless he forgoes Stealth Rock. The rest is put into Special Attack to strengthen Shadow Ball and Thunderbolt.</p> <p>One of the troublesome leads for this set is Snover. Snover deals 72% - 96% to Drifloon with Ice Shard. This means that with Protect, hail damage, and Ice Shard, Snover can defeat Drifloon without taking damage except from Sucker Punch, which will not do much to Snover. Most lead Snover run Protect, meaning that Exploding on Snover is no easy task. For this reason, it is best to run a Fire-type such as Ponyta or Growlithe to destroy Snover.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf Lead": {
        "description": "<p>This set attempts to take out two or more Pokemon on the opposition's side by using Trick to cripple the lead and Destiny Bond or Explosion with Unburden to get a KO.</p> <p>Trick allows Drifloon to lock the opposing Pokemon into a move, hopefully a support move. Tricking also activates Unburden, giving Drifloon 30 Speed. With this high speed stat, Drifloon can take out a Pokemon with Destiny Bond or Explosion. Sucker Punch and Shadow Ball are there in case using Destiny Bond or Explosion is not necessary. Sucker Punch guards against the priority that is omnipresent in Little Cup.</p> <p>The EVs give Drifloon maximum bulk while retaining 16 Special Attack and 15 Speed before Unburden.</p> <p>Lead Kabuto causes this lead problems if he Rock Slides on turn one. Drifloon will survive, use the Focus Sash most lead Kabuto have and activate Unburden to Destiny Bond and cause a double KO. However, it will cost Drifloon's life. Kabuto is prevented from accomplishing his main goal, using Stealth Rock. Lead Buneary causes this lead trouble with Klutz and Encore, but is easily worked around by most Pokemon in Little Cup. Snover can cause problems with Protect, but Ice Shard cannot OHKO this Drifloon without a critical hit and Drifloon can use Trick to lock Snover into a move, allowing it to be easily killed by a teammate. However, Snover does appreciate the Choice Scarf and becomes quite a potent revenge killer. For this reason, it is good to run a Fire-type with this Drifloon.</p>"
      },
      "Rain Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Drifloon is one of the few Pokemon in LC who can set up Rain Dance, take advantage of the rain, and then explode. The EVs of the set are tailored for that purpose, maximizing Drifloon's offensive capabilities. 17 Speed allows Drifloon to outspeed all non-Scarf Snover and almost all non-Scarf Chinchou, two major hindrances to most dedicated rain teams; it can then proceed to OHKO them both with Explosion.</p> <p>While it would be better to not waste Rain Dance turns attacking with Drifloon, this set's attacks allow it to take advantage of the rain itself when you don't want Drifloon to explode right away. Weather Ball becomes a very powerful move in the rain, while Thunder provides decent coverage alongside it, especially with Explosion in the mix. Shadow Ball can be used instead of Thunder to hit Dratini, Paras, Chinchou, and all the other Pokemon that resist the combination of Weather Ball and Thunder a bit harder. It's also super effective against Gastly and opposing Drifloon, which may come in to absorb Drifloon's Explosion. Be wary, though; unless you hit it on the switch, most Gastly will outspeed and OHKO Drifloon first.</p> <p>A bulkier spread of 36 HP / 164 Def / 164 SpD / 116 Spe with a Bold nature can be run, allowing Drifloon to survive almost all attacks. This should allow Drifloon to set up Rain Dance multiple times during a match if necessary. With 15 Speed, it will still outspeed non-Scarf Snover, as well as most Dratini and Croagunk. Even with a Bold nature, Explosion will OHKO Munchlax and Chinchou, two big hinderances to rain teams.</p> <p>This set is meant to be used on a team dedicated to abusing Rain Dance. That said, good partners for Drifloon are obviously Pokemon that can also take advantage of the rain. Powerful Swift Swim Pokemon such as Mantyke, Omanyte, and Kabuto will appreciate the removal of Snover, Chinchou, Croagunk, or Munchlax (all of whom are big threats to Rain Dance teams) via Explosion so they can have an easier time sweeping. Other Pokemon that can set up Rain Dance also make good partners. Both Bronzor and Voltorb are able to use Rain Dance effectively, and have great type synergy with Drifloon, making them excellent partners.</p>"

  "Buneary": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Buneary is a cute little Pokemon whose ability, Klutz, makes it difficult to play against. With access to moves like Switcheroo, Fake Out, Baton Pass, and Encore, Buneary can run a multitude of sets that can cripple leads, sweepers, walls, or set your own sweeper up with ease. Buneary is not without faults, however; with no effective way to hit Ghost-types for super effective damage, Buneary must rely on Encore to counter stat-up moves or simply Baton Pass out. In the end, Buneary can run a vast variety of sets, ranging from Baton Passer to Fake Out lead, and can easily find its way onto any type of team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Buneary has a wide movepool, but almost everything it can do is already listed. Buneary has access to Jump Kick, which can be used over Fire Punch in a Choice set; while Fire Punch has better accuracy, Jump Kick deals more damage to Aron and Shieldon while still hitting Magnemite for super effective damage. Buneary also has Focus Punch, so a SubPunch set could work, but with Buneary's average Attack stat it won't do a whole lot. As for support, Buneary has Rain Dance, Toxic, Sunny Day, and Fake Tears, however it is not bulky enough to use any of these really effectively and so these roles are better left to other Pokemon. Most of the time Buneary should be running max Attack and Speed (228 Atk / 236 Spe) in its sets, while putting four EVs in Defense to make it a little more bulky. On an Agilipass set Buneary should be running 156 EVs in HP, making its HP stat 24 which will activate Liechi Berry after three Substitutes.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Fighting-type moves are Buneary's downfall. Magby can easily revenge kill Choice variants locked into anything but Quick Attack with Mach Punch, and can even survive a Jolly Choice Band Quick Attack after Stealth Rock and 2HKO back. Machop is fairly bulky and can survive any of Buneary's attacks, even a Jolly Choice Band Return fails to OHKO, provided Machop hasn't taken any previous damage, and it can OHKO back with Dynamic Punch. Buneary also hates opposing priority. Sucker Punch coming from a strong Dark-type can cause serious damage, provided the opponent is faster than Buneary. Bulky Pokemon such as Squirtle and Seel can use Aqua Jet to avoid a Thunder Punch and KO Buneary when it is weakened. Last but not least, Ghost-types can cause Buneary some serious problems. Even though a STAB Shadow Ball can't touch Buneary, HP Fighting certainly can, and Buneary doesn't have many options for dealing with opposing Ghosts.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Lead Buneary has both advantages and disadvantages when compared to other common Fake Out leads such as Aipom and Meowth. The biggest advantages are its access to Quick Attack and Endeavor. Disadvantages include lack of the ability Technician, which boosts moves with 60 or less Base Power, as well as it lacking a move that hits Ghost-type switch-ins for super effective damage. However, Buneary does have access to a few moves that neither Aipom nor Meowth have. With Endeavor, Quick Attack, and a Focus Sash, Buneary has the potential to KO one Pokemon and leave another at 1 HP, which is never a bad thing. Fake Out is the obvious first choice for this set, giving Buneary the essential first turn flinch while breaking the opponent's Focus Sash. Ice Punch hits lead Diglett and Gligar harder than Quick Attack can, scoring a nice KO after Fake Out breaks their Focus Sash, but its main purpose is to hit Ghost-types who are immune to Fake Out and Quick Attack. Fire Punch is a viable option to hit Steel-types who take minimal damage from STAB Normal-type attacks, but when dealing with the common leads, Ice Punch is the superior option. Protect can be used when running an Adamant nature so that you can avoid Fake Outs from the likes of Jolly Aipom, Glameow, and Meowth, then follow up with a 2HKO with Quick Attack. Encore is also a notable choice in the last slot because Buneary can use it to force foes into repeatedly using Protect or Stealth Rock, giving a team member a chance to set up.</p> <p>Because Buneary is unable to set up Stealth Rock, one of its teammates should be designated to set it up. Pokemon such as Omanyte and Anorith can both set up Stealth Rock, but they share a Fighting weakness with Buneary, so Gligar or Sandshrew would be better options. Another good partner for lead Buneary is one who can use a priority move to defeat any Pokemon who is left with 1 HP from Endeavor. A notable example is Shuppet, who can switch into Fighting-type attacks with impunity.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Slapping a Choice item on Buneary magnifies what it does best, either outrun the majority of the metagame or hit hard with great coverage. STAB priority is a blessing in the offensive Little Cup metagame, as it allows you to bypass Speed stats and strike your opponent first more often than not. With a decent 24 Attack stat when holding a Choice Band, Buneary can wreak havoc on any Pokemon who doesn't resist Normal-type attacks. Return can be used as the main form of STAB, but is not recommended, as Ghost-types in Little Cup are very common. Ice Punch and Thunder Punch combine to make the dreaded BoltBeam combo, hitting every Pokemon in Little Cup for at least neutral damage, except for Magnemite and Chinchou, and the latter of the two is hit neutrally by Normal-type attacks. In the last slot, you can choose to use Switcheroo, which will allow Buneary to swap items with your opponent, potentially giving their special setup sweeper a worthless, yet crippling, Choice Band; however, using Switcheroo is not a good option when Buneary has a Choice Scarf, as nearly every Pokemon in Little Cup will benefit from the Speed boost. Fire Punch is a notable option, scoring a super effective hit on Magnemite, the only Pokemon who resists the previous three attacks, whereas Return can also be used here as a solid STAB option when power is needed instead of priority.</p> <p>There are specific pairings that one should take note of, mainly between items and natures. When using a Choice Band, Jolly nature should be used to reach 19 Speed, which puts Buneary into the second highest non-boosted Speed tier, only behind Diglett, Elekid, and Voltorb. When using a Choice Scarf, either nature is acceptable, but because Jolly is only useful in catching other 19 Speed Choice Scarf users, Adamant is preferred as it boosts Buneary's mediocre Attack stat.</p> <p>If there's one thing Buneary hates, it's an Elekid using Quick Attack or a Magby using Mach Punch while it is locked in on a non-priority move. As Buneary doesn't have the best defenses, it is best to pair it up with a Ghost-type, such as Gastly or Drifloon, who can come in on these attacks with immunity and set up for a sweep. Another thing that a Buneary with a Choice item hates is when a Ghost-type comes in on Quick Attack or Return. A great partner would be one who can take care of Ghosts, especially STAB Pursuit users, such as Houndour and Stunky.</p>"
      },
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>The goal of this set is to pass Speed boosts to a slower sweeper. The best way to do this is by using Substitute until Liechi Berry activates, while using Agility whenever the foe fails to break your Substitute. The HP EVs put Buneary right at 24 HP, meaning that the Berry will activate after three uses of Substitute. After all this has been accomplished, Baton Pass the boosts to a Pokemon waiting in the wings. Endure can be used instead of Substitute if you want to get to the Berry boost immediately, but isn't recommended, as the chance to pass a Substitute is too good to miss out on. In the last slot, Quick Attack is a good choice so that Buneary isn't completely shut down by a Taunter, while Encore can be used to force a foe to switch or repeat a worthless attack, giving Buneary at least one free turn to set up. If you find yourself not being able to use Agility enough, you can swap the Liechi Berry for a Salac Berry, which means you will always be able to pass at least +1 Speed.</p> <p>There are several slow Pokemon in Little Cup who would enjoy being passed +2 Speed and +1 Attack; the best of these include Cranidos, Cubone, and Trapinch. Bagon also enjoys being passed some Speed, and can tear opponents apart with STAB Outrage. Munchlax is already a dominant force in the metagame, and with a few Speed boosts, it becomes even more threatening. However, because Munchlax needs at least +3 Speed before it becomes 'fast' by Little Cup standards, as well as the fact that it won't be able to come in on the Fighting-type attacks that plague Buneary, it is a rather poor choice.</p>"
      },
      "Switcheroo": {
        "description": "<p>This is Buneary's best attempt at supporting its team outside of Baton Pass, but it's still a viable strategy. Thanks to Buneary's unique ability, Klutz, it is not affected by items. That means that it can, for example, hold a Choice Band and still switch moves while not gaining the Attack boost. This makes it relatively easy to Switcheroo a harmful item onto an opponent. This set has the recurring choice between Quick Attack and Return, and the arguments are the same for both sides. The priority that Quick Attack offers is valuable, but Return's Base Power is more than 2.5x that of Quick Attack, which can be very beneficial. Your opponent will likely switch after they have been crippled with a Choice item, which Buneary can use to its advantage by spreading paralysis around their team with Thunder Wave. Using Encore on a worthless move will allow other teammates to come in and set up.</p> <p>The choice of item on this set is up to personal preference, and it should also affect move selection. As mentioned above, Choice Band or Choice Specs can be paired with Thunder Wave to ruin a sweeper. Other notable item options include Lagging Tail and Flame Orb. Lagging Tail is useful to give to the opponent because the Pokemon holding it will always move last, unless it is using a priority move. This gives slower, bulkier Pokemon a chance to come in and set up an Agility or Rock Polish. Giving the foe a Flame Orb makes an opposing physically-based sweeper worthless, turning it into setup fodder.</p> <p>Set-up sweepers will be given numerous opportunities to do so when this set is used correctly. Great partners would be Dragon Dance Bagon and Dratini, Rock Polish Cranidos and Gligar, or Swords Dance Cubone and Gligar. All of these can come in on a crippled foe and get off a boost that could ensure a sweep.</p>"

Glameow is helpless against Misdreavus when not running Shadow Claw, as Misdreavus can avoid Sucker Punch by using Substitute or burning Glameow with Will-O-Wisp. In reality, most Substitute users give Glameow trouble, forcing it to U-turn out. Choice Scarf Machop is also a solid check, shrugging off Quick Attack thanks to its bulk and OHKOing back with Dynamic Punch. Generally, anything faster than Glameow that can survive a priority attack can be used to counter Glameow. Choice Scarf Gligar, Choice Scarf Cranidos, and Choice Scarf Magnemite are Pokemon who can come in on Glameow easily and OHKO it with their STAB attacks. Faster priority users also give Glameow trouble as Sucker Punch fails against faster priority moves.</p>",

      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Nearly anything with a STAB-boosted Fake Out is a good candidate for a Fake Out lead set, and Glameow is no exception. When using a Life Orb, Glameow's Fake Out will be doing considerable damage to most leads, while stopping them from doing anything in return. Fake Out also works well with Sucker Punch, often allowing it to take out most leads with a one-two attack combination. U-turn makes Glameow a useful Fake-turner, allowing you to scout for counters and weaken them at the same time.</p> <p>The fourth move choice is a matter of preference. Quick Attack gives Glameow yet another priority move to abuse but, if Gastly and other Ghost-type Pokemon are ruining your day, using Shadow Claw can severely hurt them. However, to come out on top against such Ghost-type Pokemon like Gastly, you will have to predict perfectly and use Sucker Punch on their attack and Shadow Claw when they use Substitute. The choice between Life Orb and Focus Sash depends on whether you want more power behind your attacks or if you want to survive a powerful hit in the lead spot. If you are using a Life Orb, reduce your HP IV to 0 in order to reduce recoil to 1 HP per attack.</p> <p>Optimally, Glameow's teammates should be able to deal with troublesome opposing leads. Mantyke does this best, as it is capable of switching into Hippopotas and Phanpy easily (watch out for Head Smash), and can also switch into Snover in a pinch. Bronzor also switches into many troublesome leads easily, and can take advantage of them to set up Stealth Rock or screens. When not using Shadow Claw, Stunky can make for a useful midgame teammate, dispatching Ghost-types who can switch into Glameow for free.</p> <p>Glameow appreciates the removal of Steel- and Ghost-types such as Bronzor and Misdreavus. Magnemite, Stunky, and Choice Scarf Houndour do a good job at removing those two, allowing Glameow to wreak havoc. Since Glameow's main role is that of a priority revenge killer, it pairs well with powerful sweepers who lack priority to finish off their weakened targets. Gastly, Mantyke and Cranidos make good partners as they take down Glameow's counters with relative ease.</p> <p>Defensively, Glameow is more of a hit-and-run Pokemon, so having bulky Pokemon to switch into the battlefield is recommended. Glameow also benefits from having its side of the field clear of Stealth Rock and Spikes, as they drastically reduce Glameow's survivability, especially when Life Orb is factored in. As such, Glameow should be paired with Taunt leads such as Voltorb or Gligar, or Pokemon with Rapid Spin such as Staryu and Squirtle, when not used in the lead position.</p>"

    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Despite having a relatively varied support movepool, Chingling is often left in the shadow of its fellow Psychic-types. Bronzor, Slowpoke, and even Natu are better choices in the majority of cases due to their superior typing and bulk. Chingling's defenses and offenses alike leave a lot to be desired, and its Speed is also below average. Due to these shortfalls, a double status set is pretty much Chingling's only shot at getting onto a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Chingling has some interesting offensive options, but is outclassed offensively by Natu, who has better typing and coverage, and Abra, who dwarfs Chingling in power. The yellow bell also gets Trick Room, but has neither Slowpoke's bulk nor the suicide lead potential of Shuppet. Chingling has access to Calm Mind and Charge Beam, but is too slow and too frail to make use of the boosts.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Unfortunately, anything with a relatively strong attack can OHKO Chingling, or at least come very close to doing so. While the Double Status set can be a nuisance, one needs to worry more about Chingling's potential partners than about Chingling itself, Houndour and Dratini in particular. A combination of Scarf Mankey and Scarf Gligar can outmaneuver any of Chingling's statusing attempts, while also knocking seven bells out of it with U-turn. Most Pokemon are powerful and fast enough to outspeed Chingling and dispatch it with their most powerful attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Double Status": {
        "description": "<p>This set attempts to make Chingling as useful as it possibly can be, and in some ways, the set succeeds. With its passable defenses, Chingling can take hits and strike back with its array of support options. Hypnosis and Thunder Wave are the two status moves on this set. After hopefully surviving an attack, use Hypnosis to put the opposing Pokemon to sleep. The opponent will hopefully switch out to another Pokemon, which can then be paralyzed by Thunder Wave, unless it is immune to Electric-type moves, such as Chinchou and Ground-type Pokemon. With two Pokemon of the opposing team afflicted with status, Chingling's teammates should have an easier time setting up and sweeping.</p> <p>Heal Bell can remove any inconvenient status afflicting Chingling's teammates, whereas Substitute eases prediction on a switch—Chingling often only gets one chance to inflict status, so it would be unfortunate to have this chance rendered useless by Mankey or a Ground-type. It also helps Chingling avoid the ubiquitous Sucker Punch, allowing it one more shot at inflicting the opponent with status. Psychic ensures that Chingling does not become useless when Taunted, however unlikely an occurrence that may be. Knock Off is an option over Heal Bell if Scarfed Pokemon particularly threaten your team. However, Heal Bell is usually the superior support option.</p> <p>As Chingling's defenses are not particularly stellar, it should be switching in only on resistances or immunities. Thankfully, Ground is a relatively common attacking type. Any Choice-locked Ground-type attack provides a free switch-in to Chingling and an opportunity to inflict status upon the opponent. Switching in on Fighting-types is also an option, but some Fighting-types, such as Machop, are powerful enough to break through Chingling's defenses regardless of resistance. Additionally, some opponents possess other threatening options that can easily take down Chingling; one example is Croagunk with Dark Pulse.</p> <p>Houndour makes a fantastic partner to Chingling. Chingling is not only resistant or immune to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, two of Houndour's most common weaknesses, but it also benefits from Houndour's ability to severely damage the opponent. Carvanha works in a similar fashion, but does not lure the Ground-type attacks that Chingling craves. While not having the typing synergy that Houndour possesses, Dratini can run amok against statused teams, especially after a Dragon Dance.</p>"

Bonsly does not have an amazing movepool, but it gets just enough for a basic Rock Polish set. However, Bonsly's main problem is that Geodude gets every move Bonsly gets and more. Although Bonsly is slightly bulkier, this is not enough to differentiate it from Geodude and other Rock Polish users. Nonetheless, Bonsly has the tiniest of niches by being pure-Rock type. While that alone may not make it better than Geodude, it is not entirely outclassed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Aside from the listed moves, Bonsly has few other usable options. While Bonsly can set up Stealth Rock, there are much better users of the move. Dig can hit Steel-types, but the charge turn makes switching to a Flying-type or a Pokemon with Levitate easy. Low Kick too gains super effective coverage on Steel-types, but as most Pokemon in Little Cup are light, it has little utility. Bonsly gets Flail, which can be used with Rock Polish and Focus Sash for a powerful set. However, it is susceptible to priority and faster Choice Scarf users.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>The easiest way to deal with Bonsly is to simply not let it set up. Most super effective moves, especially from the special side, will easily OHKO Bonsly. If it does get a Rock Polish boost, it can be easily revenge killed by a faster Choice Scarf user, such as Mankey or Chinchou. Priority users, such as Croagunk, can also take out Bonsly regardless of its Speed. Ghost-types, while fearing Sucker Punch, can switch into Explosion to prevent your team from taking damage from the move. Many bulkier Pokemon, such as Gligar, can tank Bonsly's hits even without packing a resistance. Finally, Steel-types completely wall Bonsly outside of a stray Low Kick or Dig.</p>",

Rock Slide is Bonsly's best STAB attack, as it does not get Stone Edge. Sucker Punch is nearly unique to Bonsly among Rock-types, with Geodude being the only other viable user. Since Bonsly cannot outspeed many Choice Scarf users even after a Rock Polish, most notably Choice Scarf Gastly, Sucker Punch can help to take out these threats. With the Speed boost from Rock Polish, Bonsly can usually get an Explosion off. Explosion will OHKO most Pokemon that do not resist it, although Bonsly must be aware of switches to Ghost-types. Double-Edge is an alternative as it hits harder than Rock Slide, but it lacks the sheer power of Explosion.</p> <p>The EVs give Bonsly as much Attack and Speed as possible. A Jolly nature is required to hit 11 Speed, which means that Bonsly will outspeed all unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup after a Rock Polish. Life Orb gives Bonsly some much-needed power, but Oran Berry can make setting up a Rock Polish much easier.</p> <p>Since this set is walled by Steel-types, Magnemite is an amazing teammate, as it traps Steel-types with Magnet Pull and obliterates them with Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fire. Like all sweepers, Bonsly appreciates entry hazards. Chimchar not only sets up Stealth Rock, but also roasts Steel-types with its STAB Fire-type attacks. Wynaut creates opportunities for Bonsly to set up with Encore and also removes faster Choice Scarf users, such as Mankey. Lastly, Chinchou packs STAB Thunderbolt to remove Water-types such as Staryu which would otherwise threaten Bonsly.</p>"

Gible performs best paired with sandstorm, as it can help evade some hits from the opponent to make up for its terrible Defense and Special Defense. Gible displays an array of useful sets, all of which make it a welcome addition on any sandstorm team. Outside of sandstorm it is largely outclassed by Bagon and Dratini.</p>",

Gible has Scary Face to help patch up its pathetic Speed, but its generally a waste of moveslot and Gible is more effective when taking advantage of its excellent type coverage.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Preventing Gible from advancing its sweep is Snover, thanks to its ability Snow Warning and access to Ice Shard to outpace and OHKO a locked-in Gible. With Snow Warning, it cancels out its ability and in return Ice Shard will OHKO, even with Defense EVs. Snover can switch-in on Earthquake and force it to switch out for the most part.</p> <p>Bronzor can counter Gible pretty well for the most part, because Gible has to rely on scoring a 3HKO with the shaky accuracy of Fire Blast.

    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Gible packs quite a punch in Little Cup with Choice Band. It can usually 2HKO the most common walls in Little Cup. Although it may seem Gible is outclassed by its Dragon-type counterparts Dratini and Bagon, this is not the case. Gible has Sand Veil, granting it a 20% evasion increase in sandstorm, which compensates for Gible's mediocre defenses and potentially gives it additional attacks chances - a crucial element for this set. Furthermore, Gible is part Ground-type which gives it a free turn to come in on Electric-type attacks.</p> <p>Not much can switch in on Choice Band Gible's nearly unresisted Outrage off its impressive 25 Attack. The goal is to switch in Gible on someone who can't damage it effectively. Take maximum advantage of your Ground-typing and switch in on locked-in Rock-type moves from a Choice item. Another way to safely bring Gible in after your Pokemon faints and spam Outrage while hoping your opponent misses because of Sand Veil.</p> <p>To demonstrate Outrage's power, here are some relevant damage calculations:</p> <ul> <li>+1 Outrage vs 76 HP / min Def Munchlax - 100%</li> <li>+1 Outrage vs max HP / max Def Hippopotas - 69.23% - 84.62%</li> <li>+1 Outrage vs max HP / 148 Def Bronzor - 36.00% - 48.00%</li> <li>+1 Outrage vs max HP / max Def Duskull - 76.19% - 100.00%</li> </ul> <p>Unlike its fellow Dragon-types, Gible has access to STAB Earthquake which helps him OHKO defensive Omanyte and Kabuto, along with scoring an OHKO on Aron and the much rarer Shieldon. Dragon / Ground coverage is excellent in Little Cup, as only Bronzor resists this combo. Stone Edge is a great move when you want to hit Flying-types without getting locked into Outrage. The final slot depends on the player's personal preference. Fire Blast is a nice way of hitting Bronzor much harder than a boosted Outrage would, as Fire Blast can deal a maximum of 56.00% on max HP / 68 SpD Bronzor and has a high chance of taking it down in 3-4 hits (Oran Berry applied). Dragon Claw could replace Fire Blast on the final slot, if the thought of getting locked in on Outrage is making you nervous. Although hitting Bronzor is essential to this set.</p> <p>The EVs are rather simple and its to maximize Gible's Attack and its Defense. With the current EVs, Gible can 2HKO defensive Gligar with Outrage and take an Earthquake at the same time, which deals around 65% at most. The EVs also help to beat Bronzor, as Gible will come out on top most of the time because a 4 Atk Bronzor's Earthquake can only deal around 30% damage.</p> <p>Gible performs best with sandstorm in play to take advantage of its ability, Sand Veil. Hippopotas pairs well with Gible as it provides infinite sandstorm, and enables Gible to dodge a few hits. It is advised that Hippopotas is revealed in early stages of the match, preferably as a lead, so Gible can make an early switch-in and begin to wreak havoc. In addition to Hippopotas's ability, the little hippo has Stealth Rock in its arsenal, which will increase Gible's chances of getting certain 2HKOs and OHKOs.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>This is a slight variation from the Choice Band set. This patches up Gible's mediocre Speed with a Choice Scarf. Sporting 21 Speed, it can outpace every Pokemon without a Choice Scarf or Speed boost in Little Cup, and it basically helps by striking frail sweepers before they strike you. Choice Scarf Gible can be versatile, because it can function well as an effective lead or as a great revenge killer.</p> <p>Outrage is your primary move which can OHKO almost every frail Pokemon in Little Cup, while Earthquake allows Gible to hit Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage. Earthquake also acts as a secondary STAB move, if you don't want to get locked into Outrage. Fire Blast rounds off the Dragon / Ground / Fire coverage and generally helps put up a fight against Bronzor, as it deals a maximum of 48.00%, enough to 3-4HKO it even with Oran Berry.</p> <p>Since Gible can function as an effective lead, the plan is too overwhelm and outpace frail leads such as Meowth, Diglett, and Houndour. Thanks to Choice Scarf, it can get the drop on all of those Pokemon and 2HKO them with Earthquake - assuming they all have Focus Sash; otherwise Earthquake will OHKO. 96 HP EVs are allocated to help Gible cushion hits from opposing leads and, in return, Gible can strike them back with Earthquake. Diglett in particular will fail to OHKO with Earthquake, but Gible must watch out for a potential Sucker Punch, which will foil your plan to 2HKO it with Earthquake. Gible is sturdy enough to survive Dark Pulse from Houndour - even at Naive nature, and deals a maximum of 87.50%. Meowth is a dangerous lead, but Gible has a chance of surviving Fake Out followed up by Bite and can strike back with Earthquake. Bulky leads like Bronzor give Gible a fairly risk free set up of Stealth Rock. Gible is by no means a suicide lead, it can also be conserved and then come back to haunt opposing teams as a highly-effective revenge killer late game.</p> <p>If you are not using Gible as a lead, there are two options opened in the last slot and they both have different purposes. Stone Edge is a great move when you want to hit Flying-types for super effective damage without using Outrage and eventually get locked in. Hidden Power Ice adds a surprise value when you want to grab the OHKO on unsuspecting Gligar trying to come in on your beloved Earthquake or your Outrage. Dragon Claw is always another option if getting locked into Outrage is a big issue for you.</p> <p>When playing Gible as a lead, take note on what you're up against because Gible cannot handle all the leads in Little Cup. Snover and Phanpy in particular can defeat Gible because they have Ice Shard, can OHKO Gible and has priority over all Gible's attacks. As such, packing a Bronzor of your own can help handle these threats and can provide Stealth Rock support at the same time, which Gible doesn't mind when trying to sweep late-game. Squirtle can work exceptionally well alongside Gible, because it can take Ice Shard from Phanpy and counteract with Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock or threaten it with a STAB Water-type move. From an offensive standpoint, Gible partners with Magby quite well because it helps by clearing the field of Steel-types, allowing Gible to sweep late-game.</p>"

      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<p>Gible's excellent Dragon / Ground / Fire coverage, coupled with Substitute can be really irritating as this set can potentially trouble unprepared teams, thanks to its ability, Sand Veil. While sandstorm is constantly brewing, Sand Veil becomes extremely dangerous because it grants him a way to dodge hits behind a Substitute.</p> <p>The whole idea behind the set is to get behind Substitute and begin to dish out damage with your perfect type coverage. Despite Gible's terrible Defense- which makes it difficult to throw in a Substitute, there are several ways to slip this move. Gible can take advantage of its unique typing and switch in on locked in Fire- and Rock-type moves, or Gible can force a switch-out on Pokemon you outpace and advance by using Substitute. Another way is to predict status from the opponent, and using Substitute can easily block it off. The good thing about this set is that if your opponent decides to stay in and attempt to stop Gible from using Substitute, Sand Veil can kick in and the opponent can potentially miss. Thanks to Sand Veil, your opponent has roughly one out of five chances of missing which is enough tries to use Substitute and when your HP is reduced, Salac Berry kicks in and things can turn worse for the opponent. With Salac Berry's speed boost, Gible reaches 21 Speed, enough to outspeed any other non-speed boosted Pokemon in Little Cup.</p> <p>Gible has two options in the second slot: Outrage can dish out good damage on physical walls with the cost of getting locked in, while Dragon Claw serves as a safer STAB move but in exchange of missing out crucial 2HKOs on certain walls. Earthquake can hit Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage, so unlike the previous sets, Gible doesn't have to use prediction to hit incoming Rock- and Steel-types. Fire Blast scores a 3HKO on standard Bronzor even with Oran Berry activated.</p> <p>This set can be an effective mix set with max Attack, max Special Attack and 100 Speed, as it allows Gible to shred through walls with its impressive type coverage. For the set to function properly, Gible has to use Life Orb to get the OHKOs on Munchlax and Bronzor. Gible is, however, limited because it is very poor at taking attacks from special attackers like Misdreavus without any investment in Special Defense or HP. It is advised that you pack Munchlax to handle these special attackers and help Gible survive longer.</p> <p>Snover is a big threat to your strategy because it has Snow Warning and Ice Shard to foil Gible's sweep. Snover needs to be taken out early in the match because it takes a huge load off Gible's back. Packing Magby help scare it away and can attempt to destroy Bronzor, which gives Gible a pretty hard time if it isn't behind a Substitute. For defensive purposes, Bronzor pairs up nicely when you want to take Ice Shard from Snover and 2HKO it with Gyro Ball.</p>"

Riolu also has the advantage over other Agility sweepers, due to the fact that with only three moves he can hit nearly every common wall in Little Cup for super effective damage. With all that in mind, Riolu is a great choice for any team in need of a strong late-game cleaner.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Rock Slide, Blaze Kick, and Earthquake are all decent enough options on Riolu and allow him to easily KO Pokemon such as Mantyke, Pineco, and Croagunk. However, many of these moves have redundant coverage with Riolu's STAB options, and Rock Slide has low Base Power, meaning that a super effective Rock Slide will hit as hard as a neutral High Jump Kick, only with less cost should it miss. Force Palm or Brick Break may be used over High Jump Kick as they both have perfect accuracy as well as useful side effects. However, this is not recommended on the Swords Dance set due to missing out on the OHKO on Bronzor.</p> <p>Riolu may use a Jolly nature on any of the sets provided, allowing him to outspeed every single unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup after an Agility regardless of whether they are holding a Choice Scarf or not. This should be considered a lesser option to Adamant though because the lack of power will really be noticeable, and the only remotely common Pokemon that can tie with Riolu after an Agility is Scarf Elekid. Take note that Riolu will not always be able to 2HKO Bronzor with High Jump Kick, or Hippopotas and Phanpy with Ice Punch. Finally, Riolu can run a Choice Scarf set, but this is generally done better by Machop and Mankey.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Agility Riolu has huge problems with bulky Ghost-types with Will-O-Wisp, as well as Bronzor. Drifloon and Duskull are good examples of Pokemon who can safely counter Agility Riolu while holding Oran Berry. They can switch into any move Riolu uses, including Crunch due to Oran Berry, and then cripple Riolu with Will-O-Wisp. Bronzor can switch in and at worst 2HKO Riolu with Psychic even with no EV investment. While they may not be counters, Pokemon who can use strong priority attacks, such as Dratini with Extreme Speed and Totodile with Aqua Jet, are able to KO Riolu no matter how many times it has used Agility. Swords Dance Riolu is very easily revenge killed, and since it can be outrun, its frailty is even more of a problem. If for some reason Riolu is not using Ice Punch, bulky Ground-types, such as Phanpy, Hippopotas, and especially Gligar, can eliminate Riolu with powerful STAB Earthquakes. Riolu must be very careful of status, most prominently paralysis and burn, and therefore Pokemon with decent bulk who can spread paralysis, such as Chinchou, are very useful when countering Riolu.</p>",

      "Agility": {
        "description": "<p>This is one of Riolu's best sets in Little Cup, and plays in much the same fashion as his older brother Lucario in OU. After a single Agility Riolu reaches a Speed of 30, outspeeding almost every single Pokemon in Little Cup, whether they are holding a Choice Scarf or not. The only exceptions are Choice Scarf Diglett, Voltorb, and Elekid; the former two are never seen with Scarf and Elekid only very rarely. Agility allows Riolu to outrun many Pokemon who could usually KO Riolu before it has a chance to move. Crunch is used to hit the myriad of Ghost-types in LC for a swift 2HKO at the least. The only Ghosts who stand a chance of surviving a Crunch are Drifloon and Duskull, and even they need to invest heavily in Defense and HP to do so. Unfortunately, Close Combat is not available to Riolu and therefore it has to be content with High Jump Kick. However, High Jump Kick has all the power Riolu needs, doing a minimum of 52% to 220/228 Bronzor, who is often considered to be the best physical wall in Little Cup. Ice Punch hits Gligar for a clean OHKO and also helps against the likes of Phanpy, Hippopotas, Bulbasaur, Chikorita, and Dratini, among others. Thunder Punch may be used to hit Mantyke and Totodile, but it is generally an inferior option due to the lack of coverage against common Little Cup walls.</p> <p>The EVs allow Riolu to outspeed all Pokemon in Little Cup after an Agility, barring Scarfed Diglett, Voltorb, and Elekid. The next step is to max out the Attack stat as Riolu really needs the extra boost in power to achieve certain KOs. 36 EVs in both defensive stats gives Riolu an extra point in each, while the HP stat is dropped to 19 to reduce Life Orb recoil.</p> <p>Agility Riolu has a hard time sweeping early in the game, as most walls on the opponent's team will still be carrying Oran Berry, meaning that Riolu will only be able to 3HKO Pokemon he would usually be able to 2HKO. Riolu must also be wary of certain priority moves. While he will take relatively low damage from Sucker Punch, moves like Vacuum Wave and Quick Attack may put a premature end to Riolu's sweep if his HP has dropped low enough. Bulky Ghost-types can often switch in when Riolu uses Agility, avoid an OHKO from Crunch, and then proceed to cripple Riolu with Will-O-Wisp. Zen Headbutt may be used in the last slot to deal with Croagunk and deal more damage to Gastly than Crunch; the former is especially problematic for this set as it resists High Jump Kick and takes little damage from Crunch and Ice Punch. This is not a great option though, as Riolu really needs to be able to OHKO Gligar, on top of the many other Little Cup walls who are weak to Ice. Since Riolu is fragile, it will often have a hard time setting up.</p> <p>Pursuit users like Houndour, Stunky, and Munchlax can trap and eliminate problematic Ghost-type Pokemon, which assists Riolu in sweeping. Houndour has the added benefit of absorbing Will-O-Wisp thanks to Flash Fire. Wynaut can ease the process of setting up for Riolu, as it can grant a free turn thanks to Shadow Tag and Encore; it can also eliminate opposing Pokemon that may wall Riolu. Priority can stop Riolu in its tracks, and hence Pokemon that are immune or resistant to common priority moves can be of assistance. Gastly is immune to Fake Out, Quick Attack, Extreme Speed, Mach Punch, and Vacuum Wave, making it an ideal candidate. It can also act as Pursuit bait, giving Riolu an easy opportunity to set up.</p>"

Swords Dance is the core of the set, boosting Riolu's already decent Attack stat to monstrous levels. High Jump Kick has good power and decent enough accuracy, making it the primary choice for STAB on all Riolu sets. Crunch gives Riolu almost perfect coverage alongside High Jump Kick, OHKOing every Ghost-type in Little Cup regardless of Defense investment. The final slot is slightly more problematic however. Ice Punch nails any Gligar attempting to switch in, as well as netting KOs on many bulky Grass- and Ground-type Pokemon in Little Cup. It should be noted however that Ice Punch is useless against Gligar once it has switched in, as even without a boosting item or Attack EVs, Gligar will always outspeed and KO Riolu with Earthquake.</p> <p>The Swords Dance + priority combo is not one that is widely available in Little Cup, and Riolu is one its best users. Quick Attack nearly always 2HKOes Croagunk before it can KO back with Vacuum Wave. Bullet Punch is often the superior option, however, as no Pokemon is immune to it, and it hits Rock-types for super effective damage. Focus Sash is a great item on Riolu because it allows him to fare well against offense as well as stall; however, Life Orb can be used because it enables Riolu to always OHKO Bronzor after a Swords Dance.</p> <p>With the given EVs Riolu is able to dish out as much damage as possible, KOing anything that switches into the wrong move. 196 Speed EVs let Riolu hit 15 Speed, enabling it to outrun enemies like Croagunk, Totodile, and Machop. An Adamant nature is needed to always OHKO Bronzor with High Jump Kick and Hippopotas with Ice Punch after a Swords Dance. Again the HP stat is set to 19, reducing the amount of recoil damage from Life Orb by 1. When using Focus Sash, it is recommended to bump Riolu's HP EV up to 31 which allows him to take weak neutral and resisted attacks more easily.</p> <p>Although Swords Dance Riolu possesses enormous power and almost nothing in Little Cup can afford to switch in on the wrong move, it does have its fair share of problems with faster opponents, strong priority moves, and Focus Sashes, should the opponent switch in after a KO or on a predicted Swords Dance. Thunder Punch is a decent option in the last slot to KO Mantyke and other Water-types without having to resort to High Jump Kick, but it is generally worse than Ice Punch as you lose the ability to get past most bulky Grass- and Ground-types.</p> <p>Houndour, Stunky, and Munchlax can trap Ghost-type Pokemon with Pursuit, which gives Riolu an easier time sweeping. Houndour can freely switch into Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Duskull, giving it an advantage over other Pursuit users. Wynaut can use Shadow Tag and Encore to guarantee Riolu a free turn to set up. It can also eliminate other generally troublesome Pokemon, making it easier for Riolu to sweep. Because it is so fragile, Riolu will often be stopped by Pokemon with priority. Ghost-type Pokemon are immune to many common priority attacks such as Fake Out, Quick Attack, Extreme Speed, Vacuum Wave, and Mach Punch. Gastly in particular makes a good partner, because it is fast and powerful, and serves as Pursuit bait, which can help Riolu to set up.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>With Inner Focus granting it immunity to flinching, Riolu is capable of eliminating many common leads in Little Cup. A combination of High Jump Kick and Bullet Punch KOes Snover and Kabuto, whereas Crunch is there to hit Drifloon and Gastly. Counter is a great move on Riolu due to his low Defense stat. Most leads who Riolu cannot beat with only its attacking moves, such as Mankey and Gligar, are taken care of by Counter, as the incoming Close Combat and Earthquake will both leave Riolu on 1 HP.</p> <p>Putting 196 EVs in both Speed and Attack maximizes Riolu's offensive presence, and the EVs in Special Defense give Riolu an extra point. It is not necessary to lower Riolu's Defense any further as he will usually take over 50% from any neutral hit, meaning that Counter will almost always KO the attacking Pokemon. The most difficult lead for Riolu to face is Scarf Snover, as it will KO with a combination of Blizzard and hail damage, as well as most bulky special attackers. Munchlax can help Riolu by handling strong special attackers, thanks to its great Special Defense stat. Riolu also loses to other faster leads who sport priority, such as Diglett, although Diglett will be left at 1 HP and can easily be revenged afterwards. Riolu can run Quick Attack in place of Bullet Punch to hit Water-, Fire-, and Electric-type leads such as Chimchar and Chinchou harder, but these are few and far between, so it is generally a lesser option.</p>"

  "Hippopotas": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Hippopotas is the only Pokemon in Little Cup who can set up a permanent sandstorm. It usually finds its place on defensively oriented teams, aiding its team with sandstorm support which adds more residual damage to the opponent.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Hippopotas is not as effective as its big brother Hippowdon is in OU. Hippowdon can easily switch into various physical threats and constantly phaze them and successfully heal its HP via Slack Off. However, in a metagame filled with offense, Hippopotas struggles to wall effectively. Furthermore, low Speed and Special Defense stats really hinder its ability to stay in for long periods of time. Even with these shortcomings, Hippopotas is still a very dependable Pokemon. It can consistently set up both sandstorm and Stealth Rock, a claim no other Little Cup Pokemon can make.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Hippopotas does not have the greatest of movepools, but it has a few moves that can be useful in some situations. A Stockpile set can be used to some decent success, boosting Hippopotas's poor Special Defense to higher levels. With the abundant use of Ice- and Water-type moves, however, it may be difficult to pull it off. Curse can also be used, except that it has the same problems that Stockpile has, and it doesn't add any Special Defense boosts. Lastly, a Choice Band set with Earthquake, Crunch, Superpower, and Rock Slide might be useful, though Gligar would be better relegated to this task, due to its higher Attack and Speed.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Hippopotas's horrible Special Defense makes it vulnerable to powerful special attacks, so using strong special attackers is a good way to bring it down. Houndour and Gastly are good examples of powerful special attackers who can easily bring death upon Hippopotas with their respective STAB moves. Also, any Pokemon with super effective special attacks will instantly OHKO Hippopotas, such as Porygon's Ice Beam, Bulbasaur's Leaf Storm, and Mantyke's Hydro Pump.</p> <p>Since Hippopotas is quite weak offensively and almost any Pokemon can find it very easy to set up against it without taking much damage. Gligar, who is immune to Earthquake and takes pathetic damage from other moves Hippopotas uses, can easily set up Substitute, Swords Dance, or Rock Polish and threaten to sweep Hippopotas's entire team with death-inducing Earthquakes. Krabby can easily pull off several Swords Dance or Agility boosts because of its high Defense stat, allowing it to fire off powerful Crabhammers to the opponent. The only thing that needs to be watched out for is if Hippopotas carries Roar.</p> <p>Any weather changer can threaten Hippopotas with their super effective attacks and also remove the raging sandstorm. Snover, who sets up hail, Exeggcute, who sets up sun, and Mantyke, who sets up rain, can all OHKO Hippopotas with their super effective STAB attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Hippopotas plays a very important role in the Little Cup metagame; it is the only Pokemon who can set up a permanent sandstorm. This makes it a very effective Pokemon in the lead position, setting up Stealth Rock without much trouble and having a chance to disable the opponent's Focus Sash due to the sandstorm. With its great physical bulk it also makes a great switch-in to many physically-based threats who can be troublesome, such as Meowth, Aron, and Larvitar.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is a helpful move for both Hippopotas and its team, as many Pokemon who are immune or resistant to Hippopotas's Earthquake, such as Paras and Mantyke, take upwards of 25% damage from it. Earthquake offers Hippopotas a reliable STAB attack to use, dealing decent damage. Crunch and Rock Slide are two options that provide excellent coverage in conjunction with Earthquake. Crunch helps Hippopotas combat Gastly and Duskull, two common switch-ins, while Rock Slide deals heavy damage to Flying-types, such as Mantyke and Taillow. Deciding the final move is quite difficult. Slack Off allows Hippopotas to recover a lot of its health to keep on switching in and tanking; however, in a metagame filled with Pokemon OHKOing and 2HKOing other Pokemon, it may be hard to pull off. Another issue is that lot of Pokemon can set up against Hippopotas with impunity. Gligar can easily pull off Swords Dance and sweep with insanely strong Earthquakes, Dratini can set up Dragon Dance reasonably well and destroy Hippopotas with Waterfall, while Krabby can set up both Agility and Swords Dance and sweep with boosted Crabhammers. This is where Roar comes into play, stopping Pokemon from setting up against it. It really depends on what your team needs most: a reliable physical tank or phazer.</p> <p>The EV spread is straightforward. 212 HP and Defense EVs are all Hippopotas needs to max out its HP and Defense, reaching stats of 26 and 18, respectively. The remaining EVs are split into Attack and Special Defense to add one point to each. The item choice is up to personal preference. Oran Berry is the recommended item, leaving Hippopotas with healthy HP after using Stealth Rock, assuming it took heavy damage. Since Hippopotas has a reasonably high HP stat, it could make use of Leftovers, restoring bits of its HP every turn. If you do choose to use Leftovers, using Slack Off instead of Roar is recommended so Hippopotas restores more of its HP once it uses Slack Off.</p> <p>Defensive teams will generally appreciate Hippopotas's presence, as the sandstorm it provides increases the residual damage the opponent takes. Hippopotas is also a vital member on stall teams, even though stall is very hard to master in Little Cup. Munchlax and Omanyte are common members on defensive and stall teams, the former taking special attacks with ease (something Hippopotas does not like), while the latter receiving a 1.5x Special Defense boost due to the sandstorm and setting up several layers of Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Besides defensive teams, Hippopotas is also used on sandstorm teams. Pokemon with the Sand Veil ability or Rock typing will always benefit from the sandstorm. Gligar and Cacnea, for example, will have increased evasion, helping them set up easier to sweep. As for Pokemon who are or part Rock-type, Lileep and Larvitar are good examples who appreciate the Special Defense boost, helping them set up as well. Aside from using Pokemon who benefit from the sandstorm, weather changers can instantly cripple your sandstorm team. Snover is arguably the greatest threat to Hippopotas and its teammates, so it needs to be taken care of in order for Hippopotas to keep the sandstorm up. Houndour is a great Pokemon to dispose of Snover, as it resists both of Snover's STAB moves and can OHKO it with Fire Blast or trap it with Pursuit, which would put Snover at low enough health to be taken care of by Stealth Rock. Munchlax can also harm Snover greatly with Return, and it also boasts excellent Special Defense and HP to take the special attacks Hippopotas cannot.</p>"

  "Skorupi": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>To the experienced Little Cup battler, Skorupi seems like one of those Pokemon that is not particularly noteworthy, yet at the same time is not necessarily a bad Pokemon. Thanks to an excellent Defense stat, passable offensive stats, and most importantly, access to key stat-boosting moves such as Agility and Swords Dance, Skorupi is an excellent example of Little Cup's most overlooked and underestimated Pokemon. When it has been given the proper support, Skorupi can play a strong offensive role on any Little Cup team that is in need of such a Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Aside from what the sets suggest, Skorupi doesn't have many viable options. A Choice Scarf set could be used but isn't recommended due to Skorupi's mediocre Attack stat. Similarly, a Choice Band set could be used, but similar problems would arise due to Skorupi's mediocre Speed. To take advantage of Skorupi's bulk, you can run a defensive set, which is made more interesting by Skorupi's access to Toxic Spikes; Whirlwind is also an excellent option. Rain Dance and Sunny Day are also available, albeit limited, support options. In terms of other moves Skorupi can use, Bug Bite would definitely be a valid choice as it is not only boosted by STAB, but also eats the opponent's Berry, which is quite useful considering the prevalence of Oran Berry in Little Cup .</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Croagunk is probably one of the best counters to Skorupi, as it resists all of Skorupi's common moves bar Aerial Ace and can slowly chip away at its health while Skorupi can't do much back. Both Diglett and Gastly are also excellent counters as they can easily revenge kill Skorupi after it has taken some prior damage. Also, Fire-types like Houndour are able to KO even the bulkiest of Skorupi with their strong STABs; similarly, Flying-types like Taillow can also easily KO Skorupi with their STAB super effective attacks.</p>",

      "Agility": {
        "description": "<p>This set is probably Skorupi's best in terms of being able to pull off a late-game sweep. The use of Agility, along with its awesome ability, Sniper, helps remedy Skorupi's mediocre Speed stat and enables it to hit hard. Moves like Cross Poison and Night Slash, which greatly benefit from Skorupi's ability since they already have high critical hit ratios, maximize Skorupi's efficiency as a late-game cleaner.</p> <p>Agility is a staple on this set, since it boosts Skorupi's less than impressive Speed. The given attacking moves are of the utmost necessity, so as to maximize this set's effectiveness. The former two, Cross Poison and Night Slash, benefit immensely from Skorupi's ability, Sniper. Aqua Tail is used simply for coverage, as Cross Poison and Night Slash are quite redundant together in terms of coverage. Aqua Tail provides unresisted coverage in Little Cup, barring Croagunk, whose unique typing allows it to resist all three of Skorupi's attacks; to remedy the Croagunk problems, you can use Aerial Ace over Aqua Tail.</p> <p>The EVs given maximize Attack, so as to fully release Skorupi's potential; EV investments have also been made in HP and Defense so as to make Skorupi more durable, making sure that its sweep is not prematurely ended by priority attacks. An Adamant nature is advised, as Skorupi will scarcely need the Speed granted by a Jolly nature due to Agility; it basically needs all the firepower it can get its pincers on. Lastly, an Oran Berry is recommended as this will prolong Skorupi's sweep, although Scope Lens can be utilized if you wish to increase Skorupi's overall damage output.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Unlike the previous set , which focused on Skorupi's ability to clean up late-game through the use of its ability and specific moves, this set revolves around sheer power granted through the use of Swords Dance. Due to its great bulk, coupled with its passable offensive prowess and Speed, Skorupi can efficiently play the role of a sweeper, in any phase of a battle, as long as necessary support has been provided by its teammates.</p> <p>Just like the Agility set, this set utilizes a combination of moves that provides almost unresisted coverage in Little Cup, Croagunk being the only exception. However, unlike the previous set, this one does not emphasize Skorupi's ability, so instead of moves that benefit from Sniper, stronger alternatives are advised in this set. Crunch is recommended over Night Slash, and likewise Poison Jab over Cross Poison. In both cases, the higher Base Power is more lucrative than the increased critical hit chance. Finally, Aqua Tail was left on the set due to great coverage with the rest of Skorupi's moves in addition to its already good Base Power. Just like the previous set, Aerial Ace can be used over Aqua Tail if you want a way to deal with Croagunk.</p> <p>On this set, either an Adamant or Jolly nature can be utilized, with both having their merits. Although an Adamant nature greatly increases Skorupi's damage output, often the extra Speed granted by a Jolly nature is needed more. The EVs given are distributed to maximize Skorupi's offensive prowess while also investing in HP and defenses to prolong Skorupi's sweep in a battle. No Speed EVs have been suggested as there is nothing to boost Skorupi's mediocre Speed. Oran Berry is recommended once again in order to prolong Skorupi's sweep, but if you prefer the extra power given by a Life Orb, go for it. Lastly, the ability comes down to personal preference: usually, Battle Armor is the better choice on this set, although Sniper can be used if you like the elevated critical hit ratio. However, if you're going to use Sniper, it would probably be best to utilize Cross Poison and Night Slash, as they are the better moves in such a scenario.</p>"

  "Finneon": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Even by Little Cup standards, Finneon seems like a below-average Pokemon. However, it can fill a very useful role, thanks to a very useful move rare among Water-types, U-turn. While it does not have the same raw power that Gligar and others have, U-turn allows it to perform a bait on switch which often will lure in Water-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Unfortunately, Finneon doesn't have many other options. Its somewhat decent movepool is ultimately let down by Finneon's poor stats. Aqua Tail is a viable option over Waterfall if you really want that 10 extra Base Power. Psybeam can be used to hit Croagunk for 4x super effective damage. Charm can also be used to force switches, as can Sweet Kiss, but they are both essentially gimmick options. Finneon does get Rain Dance, and so can fit on a Rain Dance team, but there are better users of Rain Dance in Little Cup.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Any strong priority move can knock out Finneon before it has a chance to do damage. If you are running a Life Orb, most Choice Scarf users will outpace you and be able to take you out. Entry hazards will wear Finneon down quickly. Snover can take Finneon's STAB moves and brings with it hail to do more residual damage and further wear down Finneon. Wynaut can trap and remove Choice Scarf variants that are locked into a move other than U-turn.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Finneon is often overlooked in favor of other physical Water-types like Omanyte and Kabuto, but thanks to its access to U-turn, it is able to scout teams and help you gain an advantage early on or turn the tide late-game. The main goal of this set is to lure in Mantyke and Chinchou; once they come in, Finneon can act as a pivot to a counter like Elekid or Diglett. The moveset is fairly straightforward; much like Choice Band Scizor in OU, U-turn should be your primary move. Waterfall is a strong STAB move and Return offers pretty nice coverage alongside it. Surf or Ice Beam is the best move in the last slot, depending on your preference, as they fulfill different purposes. Ice Beam can take out opponents like Shroomish and will OHKO Gligar, but Surf is good for scoring bigger hits on more durable physical opponents and will do more to Bronzor.</p> <p>A Jolly nature will give Finneon 17 Speed without a Choice Scarf and 25 Speed with a Choice Scarf. The given EVs ensure an OHKO on Gligar with Ice Beam after Stealth Rock damage, provided Finneon is holding a Life Orb, as well as OHKOing Rock Polish Aron with Surf. Also, Waterfall will 2HKO standard Munchlax and U-turn will reach its maximum damage output. With the given EVs, U-turn will do around 50% to Shroomish with the given EVs.</p> <p>The choice between Life Orb and Choice Scarf is entirely up to the user, depending on how you wish to use Finneon. A Choice Scarf will allow you to outpace other common Choice Scarf users such as Mankey and Carvanha, as well as Rock Polish Aron after a boost. However, forgoing a Life Orb will mean Finneon misses out on some vital 2HKOs on Pokemon such as Shroomish.</p> <p>Obvious partners are for this set are Diglett and Elekid due to their ability to take out opposing Water-types. Other partners that pair well are Grass-types, particularly Shroomish for its ability to force out Water-types and start SubSeeding your opponent to death. Water-types on your team will also benefit from Finneon's ability to help lure and eliminate opposing Water-types, as do Fire-types. Wynaut can defeat this set with relative ease, assuming that Finneon is already locked in a move. Finneon is also rather frail, so most priority moves will take quite a chunk out of it. Faster Choice Scarf users are also a problem for Finneon since it has no form of priority to take them out.</p>"
