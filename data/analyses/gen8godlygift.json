Psyshock lets it slam Zeraora and specially defensive walls that would otherwise be a problem for Alolan Raichu, such as Gastrodon and Rotom-H. Focus Blast lets Alolan Raichu blast through two of its biggest counters in Tyranitar and Ferrothorn, while Surf lets it beat Landorus-T and more reliably damage Rotom-H. Grass Knot can be used to specifically OHKO Gastrodon, Groudon, and Seismitoad, although it does little else over Surf. Nasty Plot can be used on a forced switch to OHKO or 2HKO nearly everything in the tier, although it often prefers to just attack due to its sheer wallbreaking power. Life Orb lets Alolan Raichu boost its already amazing offensive power to the extreme at the cost of longevity, while Heavy-Duty Boots lets it ignore entry hazards and not rely on the Terrain-ending Defog.</p> <p>Tapu Koko is a necessary partner, as it provides Electric Terrain and dual screens support to facilitate setup. Gods like Rayquaza, Lunala, and Mewtwo are also extremely appreciated, as they dramatically increase Alolan Raichu's Special Attack stat. Since Alolan Raichu is able to break through common Pokemon like Rotom-W and Skarmory, cleaners like Kartana and Weavile pair well. In return, they help deal with Ground-types like Gastrodon and Hippowdon and Grass-types like Tangrowth and Ferrothorn. Airborne Pokemon and Flying-types not weak to Electric-type attacks like Zapdos and Rotom-H can pressure Alolan Raichu thanks to Rising Voltage not doubling in power, while Dragon-types like Dialga and Zekrom naturally resist it. Thus, answers like Weavile, Volcanion, and the aforementioned Tapu Koko significantly help Alolan Raichu. In return, Alolan Raichu can capitalize on the damage they've dealt to either finish the game off or KO targets for said partners. Alolan Raichu's crippling weakness to the two offensive Terrain setters in Rillaboom and Tapu Lele make answers like Corviknight, Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Slowking great defensive checks. Priority attackers like Yveltal, Urshifu-R, and Weavile also heavily threaten Alolan Raichu, so answers like Slowbro, Slowking, Clefable, and Skarmory are appreciated. Entry hazard setters like Skarmory, Clefable, and Landorus-T allow Alolan Raichu to make quick progress on its forced switches, while Toxic support lets Alolan Raichu have a much easier time breaking through bulkier answers like Rotom-H and Hippowdon.</p> "

Knock Off can displace items on the opposing team, notably on common switch-ins like Heatran, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh. Aromatherapy can be run to remove status conditions from its team members. Leftovers is the preferred item to run to get more passive recovery; however, Rocky Helmet can be run to chip physical attackers like Urshifu-R, Weavile, and Yveltal.</p> <p>Clefable is an amazing defensive staple on any team that can give it the required Defense stat.

Clefable's ability to annoy opposing walls with status, chip damage, and item removal makes it a great asset for offensive teammates. Thunder Wave variants pair up excellently with slower wallbreakers like Kyurem-W and Rillaboom, helping them break through faster checks. Aromatherapy is appreciated by teammates that stand to benefit from longer games, like Ho-Oh and Gastrodon. Psychic- and Fairy-types like Tapu Lele, Mewtwo, and Galarian Slowking appreciate it removing Leftovers and Assault Vest from Steel-types. Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon like Heatran, Galarian Slowking, and Necrozma-DM can pivot into and force out Clefable, so running answers to these Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Groudon is recommended.

Soft-Boiled gives Clefable a consistent form of recovery. Moonblast is a powerful STAB move that hits many targets for neutral and super effective damage, such as Rayquaza, Pheromosa, Landorus-T, Galarian Moltres, and Rotom-W.

The given EVs and nature are to maximize Clefable's physical bulk, but can be optimized depending on the god it is paired with.

Clefable struggles versus potent physical attackers such as opposing Necrozma-DM, Kartana, and Pangoro. Skarmory and physically defensive Landorus-T are partners that can check both of those and force them out with Whirlwind and Earthquake, respectively.

Parting Shot is a valuable pivoting move that makes it easier to bring in its teammates due to the attack drops provided. Toxic or Taunt can be used in the third slot depending on what your team values more. Toxic cripples common checks such as Tapu Koko and Buzzwole, while Taunt is useful in denying recovery from walls like Skarmory. This EV spread maximizes Alolan Persian's utility, with maximum Speed investment outspeeding key threats like Kartana, which it threatens with Foul Play.

Switcheroo lets Alolan Persian trade its Choice Scarf to its opponent, crippling an opposing wall or preventing a setup sweeper from ever setting up. Parting Shot rounds out its movepool, giving Alolan Persian a strong pivoting move that outspeed much of the relevant metagame, including Choice Scarf users like Kartana and Blacephalon.

Its high HP aIso means it can pass beefy Wish to teammates. Protect is mandatory to ensure Vaporeon can recover HP against switch-ins that threaten to KO it like Tapu Koko and Magnezone, as well as scout against Choice-item users, notably Rillaboom. Scald prevents Vaporeon from becoming complete Taunt bait and threatens a burn on potential switch-ins such as Kartana. In the last moveslot, Flip Turn provides a slow pivot option and turns Vaporeon into a good Wish passer. Toxic cripples bulky Water-types, in particular Gastrodon and Volcanion, that completely wall Vaporeon otherwise. Heal Bell is another option for teams that appreciate a cleric. Heavy-Duty Boots is usually the item of choice for more safety against hazard stack, but Leftovers is an option as it synergizes well with Protect. If Vaporeon runs Flip Turn, minimum Speed investment should be run to allow a teammate to get Wish safely.</p> <p>Vaporeon is usually seen on balance and bulky offense builds that appreciate its ability to heal teammates and pivot with Flip Turn while compensating for its momentum drain. Gods with high Defense like Dialga and Necrozma-DM make Vaporeon bulky enough to even handle strong physical threats, particularly Rayquaza, but even a lower donation from Kyurem-W or Ho-Oh is valuable. Weavile and Zygarde-10% can more comfortably trade damage with opposing walls with Vaporeon giving them a second wind, while Landorus-T and Dialga's lack of recovery is remedied. Grass-types in Rillaboom and Tangrowth handle Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zeraora which trouble Vaporeon. In return, Vaporeon answers Fire-types such as Ho-Oh and Choice Scarf Blacephalon for them. Grass-types themselves give Vaporeon problems, making Skarmory, Buzzwole, and the aforementioned Fire-types great partners as well, while Vaporeon can absorb Water-type attacks aimed at them. Vaporeon tends to invite special setup sweepers like Galarian Moltres and Galarian Slowking in due to its tendency to use Protect, so answers to them such as Tapu Koko and Necrozma-DM are necessary.</p> "

Discharge provides a consistent STAB attack that can spread paralysis on opponents; Volt Switch can be used instead and allows Zapdos to maintain momentum and pivot out of checks. Hurricane is a secondary STAB attack that crucially targets Electric-resistant foes such as Landorus-T and Rillaboom and carries a non-trivial confusion chance. Heat Wave is an option that deals less damage but can reliably beat Kartana and invalidate Ferrothorn as a check. Defog lets Zapdos control entry hazards for its team, helped by the fact that it can threaten the 2 most common Spikes users in Ferrothorn and Skarmory.

Zapdos's Defog means that it and Landorus-T can form a solid physically defensive Defogger core, with Landorus-T able to fit Toxic to wear down shared checks like Gastrodon. Having a secondary source of entry hazard removal also supports Zapdos after it loses its Heavy-Duty Boots to Knock Off Kartana. The threat of paralysis from Discharge and Static allows Zapdos to scare out many fast threats, such as Zamazenta-C and Kartana, so frail wallbreakers like Zygarde-10% and Weavile enjoy Zapdos's presence.

Fiery Wrath is a more consistent attack that lacks Hurricane's raw power, but provides crucial coverage against Necrozma-DM, Rotom-W, and Skarmory. Nasty Plot overwhelms bulkier teams and reduces the number of times Galarian Moltres needs to successfully hit Hurricane, and Agility lets Galarian Moltres outspeed revenge killers and all relevant Choice Scarf users, including Kartana. Thanks to its impressive bulk for a sweeper, Galarian Moltres can usually set up the boosting move of its choice, and with dual screens support or proper prediction, it can often get both. Heavy-Duty Boots helps preserve its HP to allow for easier setup. On teams with dual screens support, Galarian Moltres can use Weakness Policy instead of Heavy-Duty Boots. This, alongside its good bulk, lets it set up on a super effective attack and potentially boost its Special Attack and Speed in the same turn.</p> <p>Galarian Moltres fits best on hyper offense teams looking for a special attacking sweeper, although it fits on some balance teams as well.

Additionally, entry hazard support from teammates like Cloyster, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-T helps wear down opposing Tapu Koko and Gastrodon. Since Galarian Moltres lacks any form of recovery, it appreciates pivots like Tapu Koko to get it in safely. While its coverage is amazing, it does miss a few key threats, namely Tapu Koko and Tyranitar, so reliable answers to wear them down like Landorus-T and Kartana are appreciated.</p> "

Thanks to Regenerator, it can come in frequently to soften up teams in the early- to mid-game while still remaining healthy for a possible sweep. Nasty Plot augments its wallbreaking ability, especially since it can recover any health lost setting up with Regenerator. Sludge Bomb's poison chance can annoy otherwise good switch-ins like RegenVest Reuniclus while also scoring super effective damage against common walls like Clefable and Tangrowth. Psyshock provides mixed coverage for specially defensive foes like Ho-Oh and Gastrodon. Flamethrower consistently hits Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Skarmory; Focus Blast is an alternative that beats Heatran and the rare Tyranitar, but at the cost of accuracy and hitting Lunala and the occasional Aegislash.</p> <p>Galarian Slowking works best with a Speed donation from fast gods like Zamazenta-C, Mewtwo, and Pheromosa to force out as many offensive threats as possible, although it is still viable with slower gods like Yveltal and Kyurem-W thanks to the power of Regenerator. To get the most use out of its wallbreaking ability, Galarian Slowking appreciates pivoting from teammates like Tapu Koko, Rillaboom, and Slowbro. It also appreciates entry hazard removal from Landorus-T and Rotom-W. Despite its awesome coverage, it will have trouble beating a few key targets, namely specially defensive Corviknight and Necrozma-DM for Focus Blast variants and Heatran for Flamethrower sets; teammates like Slowbro can reliably switch into these threats. Speaking of Slowbro, Galarian Slowking can struggle to outdamage its specially defensive set's Regenerator, so teammates that take advantage of it like Tapu Koko are excellent partners. Galarian Slowking is often forced out by revenge killers, so a solid defensive backbone to fall back on like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory is helpful; they can also set entry hazards to wear down Galarian Slowking's checks like Necrozma-DM and RegenVest Reuniclus.</p> "

Encore deters setup sweepers from using Shuckle as setup bait and can lock foes into a move that allows teammates to switch in safely.

These high defensive stats can hyper-charge two Pokemon to cover almost the entire tier. Some example Defense receivers would be Calm Mind Clefable, Corviknight, and Galarian Slowking. Special Defense receivers are much more varied, with offensive Pokemon like Rillaboom and Kartana turning into potent setup sweepers, and physically defensive Pokemon like Slowbro and Hippowdon becoming blanket checks to both physical and special attackers. However, Shuckle teams are slightly restricted by needing Pokemon to receive its terrible Attack, Special Attack, and Speed. It's wise to pick Pokemon that are naturally good without receiving any boosted stats. Using strong special attackers in the Attack slot like Tapu Koko, Blacephalon, Gengar, and Heatran allows the team to keep offensive pressure, while strong physical attackers like Weavile, Landorus-T, Kartana, and Blaziken fit in the Special Attack slot well. For the Speed slot, Pokemon like Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Mandibuzz can still perform their roles with lowered Speed, provide slow pivoting to get wallbreakers in, and are helpful against Trick Room.</p> "

Full power Water Spout OHKOes or, more rarely, 2HKOes the vast majority of the metagame; its semi-reliable switch-ins are limited to Water Absorb or Storm Drain users and exceptionally bulky Pokemon that resist Water, like Slowbro and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Even gods that resist Water like Kyurem-W are at risk of getting OHKOed. Origin Pulse is a still-powerful backup option if Kyogre is low on health, but the drop in power and accuracy is noticeable. Thunder is useful for hitting Water-types, especially Volcanion and opposing Kyogre, and Ice Beam is its best option to hit the aforementioned bulky Grass-types, as well as Dragon-types like Giratina and Kommo-o. Toxic is another option to cripple Gastrodon on the switch. Since Kyogre is able to overwhelm most foes without resorting to coverage moves, Choice Specs is its best option to maximize damage. A Modest nature is preferred to improve damage rolls against targets like Kyurem-W, especially since Kyogre has a fairly poor Speed tier even with Timid, but Timid is an option to at worst Speed tie other base 90 Speed gods like Groudon and opposing Kyogre, as well as reliably outspeeding Excadrill.</p> <p>Choice Specs Kyogre is a pure wallbreaker and requires dedicated team support to make the most of its abilities. Especially since Water Spout decreases in power with every bit of chip damage, Kyogre strongly appreciates pivots like Tapu Koko and Landorus-T bringing it onto the field safely. Entry hazards also severely cut into its longevity and power, so reliable Defoggers like Tornadus-T and Corviknight make excellent teammates; they can pivot it in safely as well. Conversely, entry hazard support from teammates like Clefable and Ferrothorn helps put bulkier foes like Kyurem-W into KO range of Kyogre. While Kyogre's Water Spout can overwhelm even bulky threats that resist Water, it cannot touch Water Absorb and Storm Drain users; Gastrodon, in particular, is the bane of Kyogre's existence. Teammates that can overwhelm Gastrodon like Grass Knot Tapu Koko make excellent partners. Tapu Koko also helps overwhelm or wear down Tangrowth, another common Kyogre check. Tapu Koko and other fast cleaners can also finish up the opposing team once Kyogre has broken the defensive core.</p> "

Water Spout is far and away Kyogre's most powerful attack and can OHKO most offensive Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Zeraora, and it still threatens to 2HKO a wide range of defensive stalwarts like Clefable without a boosting item. Origin Pulse provides Kyogre with a still-powerful STAB move after it has taken chip damage, but the drop in power and accuracy is very noticeable. It is often Kyogre's best option for cleaning late-game after it has taken chip damage. Thunder hits Water-types such as Volcanion, Tapu Fini, and opposing Kyogre for super effective damage, while Ice Beam allows it to revenge kill Rayquaza and Kommo-o, as well as fast Grass-types like Speed receiver Dhelmise and weakened Kartana. Without a damage-boosting item, however, Kyogre's coverage options lack power by Godly Gift standards and can still fail to 2HKO bulkier targets like Assault Vest Tangrowth.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Kyogre is a good revenge killer and secondary wallbreaker for balance and bulky offense teams, as it outspeeds all common unboosted Pokemon bar Regieleki and still possesses tremendous STAB power. Since Kyogre donates a powerful base 150 Special Attack but a measly base 90 Speed, it is easy to pair with a powerful special wallbreaker like Galarian Moltres to overwhelm the opposing defensive core, with Kyogre serving as the revenge killer and cleaner. Since Kyogre abhors chip damage, it loves to be brought in via pivoting from teammates like Rotom-W and Landorus-T. Both of them are also able to provide crucial Defog support, preventing entry hazards from cutting into Water Spout's power. Foes with Water Absorb and Storm Drain prevent Kyogre from freely using Water Spout, so teammates like Grass Knot Tapu Koko and Nidoqueen make great choices to overwhelm these threats.

Several notable physical attackers are unable to break Kyogre's Substitute after a burn, like Garchomp and Weavile. Kyogre can also attempt to spread burns early in the game, as many teams won't be able to reliably 3HKO it if their primary physical attackers get burned. Calm Mind allows Kyogre to set up and overwhelm even the bulkiest of defensive cores, and after two boosts it is virtually impossible to 3HKO with special attacks. Rest is the primary option in the third moveslot to recover health and cure status, and it pairs excellently with Calm Mind's Special Defense boosts. Substitute is another option that blocks status in addition to Clear Smog, prevents phazing with Dragon Tail, and provides protection against critical hits, but it requires Kyogre to rely entirely on Leftovers for recovery. Ice Beam is Kyogre's best option for a secondary attack to hit Tangrowth and Gastrodon.</p> <p>Calm Mind Kyogre fits well on balance teams that want a bulky sweeper to overwhelm even the bulkiest of defensive cores. Unlike offensive Kyogre sets, Calm Mind Kyogre is able to boost past normal checks like Assault Vest Tangrowth lacking Power Whip and Gastrodon on its own, albeit at the cost of immediate power. Kyogre appreciates bulky teammates like Corviknight and Landorus-T that can switch into the Grass- and Electric-type attacks aimed at it, respectively. They both can also pivot Kyogre back onto the field to give it another chance to set up or fish for a burn. Kyogre is slow and also thus lacks a good Speed stat to donate, so strong revenge killers like Rillaboom are recommended; Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain also doubles Kyogre's passive recovery and aids in setup. Clerics like Clefable make great teammates, as they can either wake Kyogre after it uses Rest or remove an untimely Toxic that slipped in before Substitute.</p> "

Leftovers provides longevity as Garchomp sets up.</p> <p>Garchomp best fits on bulky offense teams as a late-game sweeper or hyper offense ones as a wallbreaker. A Speed donation from Zamazenta, Pheromosa, or Mewtwo helps it force more offensive Pokemon out such as Zygarde-10% and Noivern, allowing it to get a Swords Dance up more easily. Entry hazards, like Ferrothorn's Spikes and Heatran's Stealth Rock, compound damage throughout the game, putting Pokemon like Buzzwole and Slowking in Garchomp's KO range late-game. Magnezone can trap and eliminate Corviknight and Skarmory, making it a great partner. Special attackers that invite Heatran and Galarian Slowking in, especially those with a pivot move like Tapu Koko or Tornadus-T, are also great options. Pokemon such as Weavile and Kartana work with Garchomp to overwhelm shared checks, allowing one to sweep. The latter can also break past physically defensive Unaware walls like Clefable and Quagsire, which Garchomp can't get past. Dual screens support from the likes of Alolan Ninetales and Grimmsnarl helps Garchomp set up safely and remedies its Defense drop from Scale Shot. Scale Shot's inconsistency can make bulky Flying-type Pokemon, namely Ho-Oh and Landorus-T, troublesome, making teammates that can take advantage of them like Urshifu-R and Cloyster valuable. Psychic Surge from Tapu Lele can prevent priority attacks like Weavile's Ice Shard from exploiting Scale Shot's Defense drop.</p> "

Lava Plume is an option with better accuracy and PP that threatens a burn on potential switch-ins such as Rayquaza and Garchomp. Stealth Rock lets it support its teammates, and Heatran's ability to threaten common entry hazard removers allows it to keep it on the field frequently. Toxic cripples common switch-ins such as Gastrodon and Slowking and deals a lot of passive damage when stacked with Magma Storm. Earth Power is used to hit opposing Heatran, which otherwise wall it, as well as lessens the need to use Magma Storm's low PP against foes like Tapu Koko and Victini. Protect helps Heatran rack up passive damage as well as gain extra Leftovers recovery. It also scouts common Choice item Pokemon, like Zygarde-10% and Kyogre. Taunt is an option to prevent recovery moves and Teleport from defensive Pokemon, notably Clefable. Leftovers is the preferred item to give Heatran recovery, but Air Balloon is an aggressive option that lets it counter opposing Heatran, and also Dhelmise after it pops. If it is not in the Speed slot, 120 Speed EVs lets Heatran outspeed uninvested base 90 Pokemon, which are common thanks to powerful gods like Kyogre and Ho-Oh, in addition to Bold and Modest Magnezone. If Heatran does receive Speed, it can invest more fully in Special Defense.</p> <p>Specially Defensive Heatran thrives on bulky offense teams where it gets many opportunities to switch in. Many physically offensive Pokemon enjoy Stealth Rock to wear down their checks and counters, especially those with Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots like Weavile and Kartana. Moreover, Heatran threatens physical walls that they can't break though such as Skarmory and Ho-Oh. Special attackers like Kyurem-W and Tapu Koko can struggle against specially defensive cores, and Heatran can help soften these walls for them. Offensive and defensive pivots complement Stealth Rock well by racking up damage and give Heatran more opportunities to switch in. Examples of pivots include offensive Pokemon like Zeraora and Rillaboom and defensive Pokemon like Slowking and Corviknight. Rillaboom notably synergizes well with Heatran thanks to Grassy Terrain providing extra recovery and halving Earthquake damage. Heatran is unable to deal with some special wallbreakers, namely Kyogre and Volcanion, so Gastrodon can cover for Heatran well. Physical Ground- and Fighting-types dent Heatran, which Buzzwole, Tangrowth, and Landorus-T handle well.</p> "

Earth Power destroys opposing Heatran, which otherwise walls it completely. Toxic further increases its passive damage, helping against said foes and reducing the need to constantly waste Magma Storm's low PP. Taunt prevents the defensive Pokemon from using their recovery moves, pivoting out with Teleport, or phazing Heatran out with Roar and Whirlwind.

Rocky Helmet can be used to spread more chip damage by further punishing physical attackers like Urshifu-R, Victini, and Necrozma-DM, but Leftovers recovery is generally preferred to remedy reliance on Rest.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Taunt: Giratina usually relies solely on its status moves to make progress, so Taunt from Pokemon like Zeraora, Tapu Fini, Heatran, and Tornadus-T can shut it down easily.

Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers like Groudon, Garchomp, and Rillaboom and Steel-types like Necrozma-DM, Zamazenta-C, and Kartana that attempt to boost past Giratina. Rest and Leftovers give it much needed recovery; Rest also removes any status that tries to whittle it down and, in some situations, lets it come out on top against the foe by easily PP stalling them with Pressure. Toxic puts every non-immune foe like Galarian Moltres, Tapu Koko, and Volcarona on a timer and lets it beat opposing defensive Pokemon like Tangrowth and Rotom-W, while Roar prevents setup sweepers like ChestoResto Galarian Moltres, Calm Mind Clefable and Reuniclus, and Substitute users like Kyurem-B from taking advantage of Giratina's passivity to freely set up. In the last moveslot, Hex prevents it from being Taunt-bait and synergizes well with either of its status moves to highly damage the likes of Necrozma-DM and Mewtwo, while Defog allows Giratina to compress roles by providing the team with entry hazard removal; however, Giratina's reliance on Rest for recovery and poor matchup against entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Clefable mean it should only be run alongside another Defogger. Running no item is an option to let Giratina take on Knock Off and Poltergeist users like Kartana, Rillaboom, and Dhelmise more reliably. A physically defensive spread is preferred to check threats like Necrozma-DM, Zamazenta-C, and Victini better, as most special attackers in the metagame such as Yveltal, Galarian Moltres, and Tapu Lele still threaten it heavily regardless of its investment.</p> <p>Due to its immensely valuable defensive profile and very passive nature, Giratina is solely relegated to full stall teams.

Its deceivingly solid Speed stat can even be donated to slow Pokemon with already acceptable defenses like Tyranitar and Galarian Slowking. Setup wallbreakers such as Nasty Plot Mewtwo and Swords Dance Rayquaza and Weavile can easily break through Giratina; thus, teammates like Ditto, Unaware Clefable, and Haze Quagsire can help dissuade or completely ignore their boosts. Skarmory, Buzzwole, and specially defensive Tyranitar make great partners, as they can check Dark-type foes like Weavile, Choice Band Alolan Persian, and Yveltal, respectively. They also deal with threatening Ghost-types, with Skarmory and Buzzwole dealing with Dhelmise and Tyranitar with Blacepalon. Skarmory, Buzzwole, and Clefable can absorb Knock Off from foes like Kartana, Zeraora, and Tangrowth, respectively, which would significantly cut into Giratina's longevity if it's running Leftovers. Corviknight and Clear Smog Gastrodon can deal with Fairy-types like Choice Specs Tapu Lele and Calm Mind Clefable that either OHKO or set up on Giratina. Giratina gets extremely overwhelmed by entry hazards, especially in longer games, so it appreciates being paired with Defoggers like Corviknight, Tornadus-T, and Skarmory that can reliably remove them.</p> "

Swords Dance further boosts Excadrill's Attack, allowing it to break through sturdy physical walls such as Magic Guard Clefable and Ferrothorn.

Ferrothorn can also use Protect to get extra recovery from Leftovers and Leech Seed, or Toxic to debilitate switch-ins like Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Volcarona.

Ferrothorn deals with foes such as Nihilego and Tapu Koko for Ho-Oh, while Ho-Oh deals with Fighting- and Fire-types such as Volcarona, Heatran, and Pheromosa for Ferrothorn. Most wallbreakers in the tier appreciate Spikes, notably Weavile, Tapu Koko, and Zygarde-10%.

Slowbro is also a great teammate to take a lot of Fire- and Fighting-type attacks while keeping momentum with Future Sight and Teleport. Similarly, Landorus-T not only covers Fighting-types and can pivot, but also allows Ferrothorn to freely run Spikes with its Stealth Rock.

Icicle Spear is its best STAB move, doing super effective damage to common defensive Pokemon like Landorus-T, Tangrowth, and Giratina. Fusion Bolt has fantastic synergy with Icicle Spear, notably hitting Water-types like Slowking and Tapu Fini that would otherwise wall Kyurem-B. Roost lets it stay healthy throughout longer games and use its impressive bulk to set up multiple times. Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred item to avoid Stealth Rock chipping Kyurem-B down upon entering the field; however, other items like Life Orb and Lum Berry can also be used, the latter to set up on status-inducing foes. Jolly is the preferred nature to outspeed Pheromosa at +1. Adamant allows Kyurem-B to get more KOs, such as the OHKO against Landorus-T and 2HKO against Slowbro. These KO's can also be achieved by running a Jolly nature with Life Orb.</p> <p>Kyurem-B shines on offensive teams thanks to its good offensive donations. Mimikyu, Rillaboom, Victini, and Zygarde-10% become amazing wallbreakers with Kyurem-B's Attack donation, punching holes in opposing physical walls for Kyurem-B to sweep. Moderately strong special attackers like Tapu Fini, Tapu Koko, and Galarian Moltres make good use of its solid Special Attack; the former weakens Dragon-type moves and blocks status for Kyurem-B with Misty Terrain, while the latter two pressure Buzzwole and Necrozma-DM. It can also pass a decent HP stat onto bulky pivots like Rotom-W and Landorus-T, which fit onto the more offensive teams of Kyurem-B while dealing with its answers such as Necrozma-DM and Sand Rush Excadrill. Many teammates can take advantage of Kyurem-B's less-used stats to fill utility roles. For example, Heatran, Excadrill, and Clefable provide crucial Stealth Rock support. Before setup, Kyurem-B is vulnerable to faster Pokemon such as Zeraora and Zygarde-10%, which Tangrowth and Buzzwole can deal with. Faster Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Yveltal can force out Kyurem-B even at +1, so teammates that can switch into their attacks like Kartana, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Koko also make for good teammates. Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, Kartana, and the aforementioned Tapu Fini provide a crucial answer to fast Pokemon like Zamazenta, Pheromosa, and their Speed receivers, preventing them from outrunning common Kyurem-B team structures. Should Kyurem-B opt for another item, a Defogger like Tornadus-T or Volcanion is also appreciated. Dual screens support from Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl will also help it set up, but this really only fits on hyper offense teams.</p> "

Knock Off and Close Combat are the STAB moves of choice, dealing significant damage to common physical walls such as Skarmory, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W. Gunk Shot hits Fairy-types that resist Pangoro's STAB combination such as Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Tapu Koko and OHKOes them at +2.

Pangoro is weak to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users such as Blacephalon and Kartana, so defensive Landorus-T and Rotom-Wash pair well in that role on less offensive teams. Pangoro is good at wearing down common Unaware and physically defensive walls that normally stop hyper offense teams, so pairing it with other sweepers such as Scolipede, Kartana, and Shell Smash Cloyster maximizes its effectiveness.</p> "

Yveltal hits an overwhelming majority of the tier for at least neutral damage, chunking common walls like Rotom-W, Heatran, and Corviknight.

Heat Wave enables Yveltal to beat common Steel-types which can withstand its STAB moves, like Ferrothorn, Klefki, and Bisharp, and is its best option against Tapu Koko. Sucker Punch can also be used to give Yveltal the ability to revenge kill faster threats, like Dracozolt, Venusaur under weather, and Kartana. Sucker Punch should be run with a Mild nature.

Liquidation is its strongest attack thanks to Water Bubble, which notably hits neutral targets even harder than super effective coverage moves, reducing the need to predict. Leech Life is Araquanid's best option against Tangrowth, Slowking, and Pokemon immune to Water such as Gastrodon and Seismitoad. Crunch provides super effective damage against Giratina, which could otherwise stall Liquidation's PP. In its last moveslot, it can either go with Poison Jab, which also possesses a high poison chance, to deal more damage to Tapu Fini and Volcanion, or Toxic to cripple Vaporeon, which completely walls it. Choice Band is the preferred item to maximize its damage output, as it usually only needs to use Liquidation. While usually used in Trick Room teams, Araquanid can still be used without a dedicated team, as its defensive utility and Water Bubble's ability to prevent burn and halving Fire-type damage provide it a lot of opportunities to switch in against foes, namely Heatran and Clefable. In those cases, Araquanid should run Sticky Web over Crunch and opt for Heavy-Duty Boots to negate entry hazards. Minimal Speed is run if Araquanid is used in Trick Room teams; otherwise, it should run 31 Speed IVs, 148 Speed EVs, and Adamant nature to outpace uninvested Clefable.</p> <p>Araquanid best fits in Trick Room teams where it can take advantage of its low Speed. Calyrex-I and Necrozma-DM are mandatory partners to maximize Araquanid's damage output, and they can also set Trick Room. In return, Araquanid can wear down physical walls, in particular Skarmory and opposing Necrozma-DM, for them. Other bulky Trick Room setters, especially Porygon2 and Slowking, are also needed to take hits after Trick Room has ended; they also have Teleport, allowing Araquanid to come in without having to take damage. Hatterene has Magic Bounce, preventing entry hazards from limiting Araquanid's opportunities to switch in. Other offensive Trick Room attackers that can deal with Ferrothorn and physically bulky Pokemon immune to Water are needed, making Conkeldurr and Speed-received Kartana and Blacephalon great teammates. If Araquanid finds itself on teams without Trick Room, then it can take the leftover Attack slot from gods like Kyurem-W and Giratina-O. Entry hazard deterrents, including Ghost-types to spinblock such as Blacephalon and Defiant users in Bisharp and Galarian Zapdos, are recommended to prevent Sticky Web from being easily cleared.</p> "

Other wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Pangoro and Kartana can keep exerting offensive pressure against opposing team and overwhelm physical walls alongside Mimikyu; notably, they can cripple common defensive walls with Knock Off and threaten Unaware Quagsire and Clefable, with Kartana taking care of other physically bulky Water-types like Rotom-W and Vaporeon as well, which threaten to burn Mimikyu. Volcarona is a potent setup sweeper that can pressure Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Skarmory for Mimikyu, and, in return, Mimikyu threatens Dragon-types like Giratina, Garchomp, and Rayquaza for Volcarona to sweep easier.

Alolan Ninetales and Tyranitar can set hail and sand to negate it, respectively, while most walls can inflict poison or burn.

They can effectively force Lunala out with their own status.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit Moves: While not common, multi-hit moves only suffer the damage penalty from Shadow Shield on the first hit. Shell Smash Cloyster and Choice Band Urshifu-R have the power to break through Lunala, although the latter risks a Speed tie.

Roost helps keep Shadow Shield intact, with Lunala's Speed meaning it can often go before these wallbreakers should they stay in. Depending on team choices, Lunala can either opt for Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave. The former immediately deters dangerous physical attackers such as Necrozma-DM and Kyurem-B, while the latter facilitates slower teammates like Obstagoon, Urshifu-R, and its Speed receivers. Hex's higher PP and synergy with Lunala's status spreading are usually preferred over Moongeist Beam's initial power. Ice Beam OHKOes Rayquaza and Landorus-T, while Toxic annoys Gastrodon, Tangrowth, and specially defensive Tyranitar, which don't mind its other options. Defog is another alternative for role compression. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures entry hazards don't break Shadow Shield.</p> <p>With well-rounded stats, Lunala lends itself to bulky offense and balance teams. Common defensive Pokemon in Rotom-W, Tangrowth, Clefable, and Landorus-T all benefit from Lunala's defensive stat donations, and they bolster Lunala's Hex with their status moves. Tapu Koko, Tapu Fini, Celesteela, and Galarian Moltres make great use of its impressive Special Attack; its Speed donation, while not stellar, is enough to outpace Rayquaza and Kyurem-W, thus allowing slower teammates like Galarian Slowking and Dhelmise to pressure foes more easily. Dark-type teammates are necessary to cover for Lunala's weaknesses. Galarian Moltres and Bisharp check Dhelmise and benefit from Lunala spreading paralysis to make up for their middling Speed; defensive ones such as Mandibuzz and Alolan Persian also provide pivoting to make up for Lunala's predictability and momentum drain. Skarmory and Ferrothorn cover faster physical threats that can 2HKO it through Shadow Shield like Urshifu-R and Weavile. Lunala's middling Speed can be problematic against fast teams, making Choice Scarf Urshifu-R and Kartana great partners. Since Lunala can be overwhelmed due to its reliance on Roost and fear of chip damage, Clefable, Gastrodon, and Corviknight alleviate some pressure by dealing with foes such as Tyranitar, Zeraora, and Kartana. They can also absorb Knock Off and status effects that Lunala wants to avoid.</p> "

Blacephalon is also a serious threat to snowball the other team, as (in most cases) Beast Boost will raise its Special Attack after a KO, allowing it to blow through weakened teams. Shadow Ball is its primary attack, hitting most of the metagame at least neutrally. Fire Blast has high Base Power and can dent many Pokemon that can take Shadow Ball such as Tangrowth, Yveltal, and Zamazenta-C. Flamethrower is an alternative, trading raw power for more accuracy and PP. Trick allows Blacephalon to cripple specially defensive foes that it can't do much against otherwise, namely Gastrodon and Tyranitar. On the last moveslot, Knock Off disrupts the foe's item, and is particularly useful against Ho-Oh when Stealth Rock is up. Knock Off also comes in handy to remove Assault Vest from RegenVest Pokemon that might stomach its attacks and switch out with little HP lost otherwise, in particular Tangrowth and Galarian Slowbro. Toxic instead puts foes on a timer and forces them to use their recovery move more often. Overheat is an alternative that helps it revenge kill weakened offensive threats better. Choice Scarf is usually the go-to item to outspeed fast offensive threats like Tapu Koko and Mewtwo. If Blacephalon gets a Speed donation from Zamazenta or Pheromosa, Choice Specs is preferred, as Beast Boost will increase its Speed after a KO.</p> <p>Choice Item Blacephalon acts as a cleaner and revenge killer on offensive builds. A Speed donation from fast gods such as Mewtwo, Zamazenta-C, and Pheromosa helps it outpace fast offensive Pokemon such as Weavile and Kartana; however, a better Defense or HP stat can also help Blacephalon avoid a KO from priority moves such as Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. Groudon can provide sun, which further boosts Blacephalon's Fire attacks. Specially offensive Pokemon like Tapu Koko enjoy Blacephalon's ability to cripple special walls like Gastrodon and Ho-Oh without taking up the Special Attack slot. They can also weaken Blacephalon's checks and counters, allowing it to pick up a KO more easily and snowball. Physical threats such as Kartana and Zamazenta-C struggle against sturdy walls like Buzzwole and Skarmory, which Blacephalon can handle. Entry hazards greatly limit Blacephalon's ability to switch in multiple times, so teammates with entry hazard removal such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W are required. Blacephalon complements entry hazards well by removing Heavy-Duty Boots with Trick or Knock Off, which makes Ferrothorn and Landorus-T great additions. Priority attacks like Yveltal's Sucker Punch and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide force Blacephalon out, so partners that can take them like Tapu Koko and Tornadus-T are appreciated. A counter to Tyranitar like Urshifu-R or Buzzwole is also necessary.</p> "

Fire Blast can be used instead, however its lower PP and accuracy are concerns when Blacephalon is often required to use it multiple times.

It can also check two common priority users in Rillaboom and Yveltal. Pokemon who share checks with Blacephalon like Victini and Volcarona benefit from having opposing Ho-Oh and Gastrodon crippled. Bulky offensive threats such as Kyurem-W force it out, which makes it necessary to have a teammate that can handle their attacks like Tangrowth. Entry hazard support from Skarmory and Ferrothorn helps Blacephalon chip down opposing walls, especially with Knock Off to remove their Heavy-Duty Boots.

They have to be cautious of being put into KO range of Urshifu-R's Aqua Jet, however.</p> <p><strong>Contact Effects: If not running Protective Pads, all of Urshifu-R's attacks, especially the multi-hit nature of Surging Strikes, can be punished by common roadblocks like Iron Barbs Ferrothorn, Static Zapdos, and Rocky Helmet from the likes of Tangrowth and Buzzwole.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Urshifu-R is one of the best offensive pivots thanks to the combination of typing, high Base Power attacks with great coverage, and U-turn to generate momentum. Its dual STAB combination threatens to deal at least neutral damage to most Pokemon, with Close Combat also nailing foes like Zamazenta-C, Kyurem-B, and Ferrothorn, while Surging Strikes takes care of Ho-Oh, Landorus-T, and Victini. Its typing and natural bulk also lets it act as a team's emergency check to prominent threats like Necrozma-DM, Calyrex-I, Weavile, and Volcarona. Aqua Jet is used to pick off faster threats like Pheromosa, Tapu Koko, Sand Rush Excadrill, and a Speed-donated Heatran and Landorus-T, while Ice Punch can be used to OHKO Dragon-types like Rayquaza and Garchomp and is Urshifu-R's strongest attack to hit Giratina. Choice Band turns it into a wallbreaker, notably capable of OHKOing defensive Ho-Oh and 2HKOing Lunala and offensive Necrozma-DM, and is an especially great item with a Speed donation. Choice Scarf allows Urshifu-R to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Kartana, Zeraora, and Mewtwo and revenge kill a boosted Kyurem-B; it most often runs Choice Scarf when taking a dump stat. Protective Pads can be used to keep Urshifu-R healthy, letting it safely fire off attacks or pivot out of foes such as Iron Barbs Ferrothorn, Rough Skin Garchomp, Static Zapdos, and Rocky Helmet users like Tangrowth, Skarmory, and Buzzwole.</p> <p>Urshifu-R fits in on any offensive team archetype, ranging from bulky offense to hyper offense. It appreciates Attack donation from gods like Necrozma-DM and Rayquaza, but also loves the Speed donation from gods like Pheromosa, Mewtwo, and Zamazenta-C. However, Urshifu-R's reliability to perform well regardless of which stat it receives means it can easily be placed into less valuable teamslots like Rayquaza's Special Defense. Weavile is an incredible partner, as they can overwhelm a shared check in Tapu Fini together and it appreciates Urshifu-R's ability to bring it in on Slowking, Slowbro, and Giratina safely with U-turn. Tapu Koko forms a strong VoltTurn core with Urshifu-R, as it can bring the latter in safely on Ground-types like Landorus-T and Groudon, and, in return, Urshifu-R can bring Tapu Koko in on bulky Water-types like Slowking and Tapu Fini. Tapu Koko can also lure in Gastrodon and significantly damage it with Grass Knot, which opens up Urshifu-R to use its Water-type attacks freely. Due to its propensity of getting threatened by faster threats like Tapu Koko, Mewtwo, and Kartana, a solid defensive backbone consisting of teammates like Landorus-T, Heatran, and Tornadus-T, respectively, is needed; moreover, Landorus-T and Tornadus-T provide pivoting with U-turn, while Ferrothorn lays Spikes down to punish the foe's switches that Urshifu-R tend to force.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With a Speed donation, Glastrier is a fast, bulky, and powerful attacker that can snowball through the opposing team thanks to Chilling Neigh. Icicle Crash is its best STAB option, threatening the likes of Landorus-T and Yveltal and boasting excellent neutral coverage and a nifty flinch chance. Close Combat nails opposing Ice- and Steel-types such as Kyurem-W, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Crunch allows Glastrier to take on threats like Necrozma-DM, Blacephalon, and Lunala, while Megahorn is an alternative to nail Slowbro and Slowking while also hitting other Psychic-types such as Calyrex-I. High Horsepower in the 4th slot provides a safer choice over Close Combat against Steel-types like Heatran while also hitting Necrozma-DM and Blacephalon harder. It also nails Fire types such as Victini and Volcanion. The decision between Choice Scarf and Choice Band depends on its god; it prefers Choice Scarf when paired with slower gods like Yveltal, Lunala, and Ho-Oh, but it makes great use of Choice Band when receiving Speed from Zamazenta-C, Mewtwo, and Pheromosa.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Zygarde-10% and Galarian Moltres appreciate Glastrier's ability to clean up after they have punched holes in the opponent's defensive core. Gods such as Lunala and Yveltal give Glastrier the ability to augment its subpar Speed stat and in turn appreciate the bulk that Glastrier brings to the team; if opting for the Choice Band variant, it should be paired with faster Gods like Zamazenta-C and Mewtwo. Entry hazard support, particularly Spikes, from Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory helps Glastrier to wear down Steel-types that it tends to struggle with. Glastrier also struggles with entry hazards itself, so Defoggers such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W help ease Glastrier being worn down by them. While opposing bulky Water-types can give Glastrier trouble, they are still the best partners for it as they can handle opposing Fire-types such as Victini and Blacephalon with ease. Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Gastrodon are all excellent choices. Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Kartana appreciate Glastrier's ability to take out Flying-types such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos. Electric-types such as Zeraora and Tapu Koko appreciate Glastrier's ability to get rid of Ground-types such as Zygarde-10% and Landorus-T, allowing them to have an easier time sweeping. In return, they threaten bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Suicune, and Tapu Fini, which allows Glastrier to have an easier time sweeping.</p> "

Icicle Crash is the best STAB option Glastrier has, hitting Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Yveltal, and Rillaboom. Close Combat allows it to hit those pesky Steel-types and opposing Ice-types such as Heatran, Kyurem-B, and opposing Glastrier. Crunch is a safe option that nails opposing Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Blacephalon, Galarian Slowking, and Victini. Megahorn, however, provides Glastrier with a way to hit Slowbro and Slowking harder. Swords Dance is the star of this set, allowing Glastrier to boost up to take out an opposing Pokemon then snowball from there.</p> <p>Swords Dance Glastrier is normally found on hyper offense teams that can provide it with dual screens support; Alolan Ninetales and Tapu Koko are great dual screens leads. Glastrier requires a high Speed stat, meaning it should generally be paired with one of Mewtwo, Pheromosa, or Zamazenta-C. They also help Glastrier break down walls in the case of Zamazenta-C and Mewtwo or get a switch in from a fast U-turn in the case of Pheromosa. Entry hazard support from the likes of Garchomp and Skarmory is greatly appreciated here, as Glastrier can force a lot of switches and therefore help wear down the opposing team. Glastrier still struggles to muscle past bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Tapu Fini, so Pokemon like Rillaboom, Kartana, and Zeraora can help ease those matchups by wearing them down or taking them out completely. Choice Scarf Fire-types such as Blacephalon, Heatran, and Victini appreciate Glastrier's ability to break down walls for them to clean up afterwards.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Calyrex-I's stat spread, offensive movepool, and Swords Dance make it a great Trick Room attacker. Trick Room turns its low Speed into an advantage, which combined with Swords Dances allow it to easily break through opposing teams. Glacial Lance is Calyrex-I's STAB attack of choice and threatens massive damage on any non-resistant foe. High Horsepower is mandatory coverage to hit Steel-types like Zamazenta-C and Necrozma-DM super effectively, with Ground /Ice coverage being almost unresisted in the tier. Seed Bomb is an option on full Trick Room teams, where Calyrex-I can rely on teammates to set Trick Room for it, as it hits Calyrex-I's two biggest nemeses in Slowbro and Rotom-W super effectively. Heavy-Duty Boots fixes Calyrex-I's entry hazard weakness and preserves its bulk. Life Orb scales up its damage output and notably allows it to 2HKO Slowbro and Rotom-W with unboosted Seed Bomb, whereas Weakness Policy can bypass the need to spend turns boosting with Swords Dance.</p> <p>Trick Room Calyrex-I can fit on both balance and full Trick Room teams as their main sweeper. Good HP and amazing Defense transform defensive Pokemon like Rotom-W and Clefable, respectively, into excellent physical walls that can safely switch in should Trick Room expire. High Special Defense is useful on a variety of utility Pokemon like Landorus-T and Corviknight to help keep entry hazards clear and position Calyrex to deal damage, the former of which can also carry Toxic and Stealth Rock to whittle down opposing physical walls. Fast attackers benefit greatly from Calyrex-I's huge Attack, compounding wallbreaker and revenge killer into one slot for threats like Persian-A, Zygarde-10%, and Weavile. On Trick Room teams, Calyrex-I's bulk helps setters like Hatterene and Porygon2 safely switch in and set up Trick Room - in Porygon2's case, this also helps with safely getting a teammate in via Teleport. Marowak and Araquanid are Calyrex-I's greatest Attack beneficiaries thanks to Thick Club and Water Bubble, respectively, offering unmatched instant power that allows them to break past the majority of common physical checks. Calyrex-I's meager Speed can also be turned to its advantage by slowing allies such as Kartana and Blacephalon down, allowing them to underspeed more foes while Trick Room is active.</p> "

Trick lets Calyrex-I cripple physical walls such as Slowking and Rotom-H, making it much easier for Calyrex-I or its teammates to break through these Pokemon. Aromatherapy supports the team by removing status such as burn and toxic, notably allowing Calyrex-I to play more aggressively against common Water-types like Rotom-W and Slowbro. Seed Bomb can guarantee a 2HKO or better on these Water-types but comes with the cost of locking Calyrex-I into a relatively weak Grass-type move. Adamant provides maximum wallbreaking power whereas Jolly allows Calyrex-I to Speed tie uninvested Landorus-T and outspeed uninvested Rotom and Pokemon with base 90 Speed like Giratina and Ho-Oh.</p> <p>Calyrex-I best fits on balanced and bulky offense teams that can leverage its base stat donations and wallbreaking ability to beat opposing defensive cores.

Landorus-T also appreciates the donation as Toxic and Stealth Rock provide valuable chip damage, netting Calyrex-I more KOs and helping it snowball with As One, as well as helping it get in safely with U-turn. Attack donations are best used on fast sweepers and priority users like Zeraora, Rillaboom, and Weavile, as these can make good use of the damage Calyrex-I causes to clean weakened teams late-game. Defense and HP donations can be used by both bulky pivots, such as Rotom-W and Rotom-H (both of which provide valuable Fire and Steel resistances), or bulky set-up sweepers such as Volcarona and Calm Mind Clefable.</p> "
