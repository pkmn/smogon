        "description": "<p>Zamazenta-C donates excellent all-around stats to its teammates while also being a fearsome attacker that can use its combination of bulk, Speed, and power to clean late-game. Its combination of Behemoth Bash and Close Combat lets it hit many defensive staples like Heatran, Clefable, and Ferrothorn super effectively. It is also able to hit the vast majority of the meta for neutral damage, including Pokemon like Rotom-W, Tangrowth, and Gastrodon. Wild Charge is used to chunk bulky Water- and Flying-types like Slowbro, Slowking, and Ho-Oh that would otherwise give it trouble. Howl turns Zamazenta-C into a threat to sweep, especially as its natural bulk and Dauntless Shield often afford it the room to set up. 152 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow it to outspeed Zygarde-10% and Alolan Persian, while the leftover EVs are put into HP to give it more bulk.</p> <p>Since Zamazenta-C still donates Zamazenta-H's stats, it offers an excellent 138 Speed, very good 130 Attack, and solid 115 Defense and Special Defense, letting it support offensive and defensive receivers alike. Pokemon like Dhelmise and Volcanion can take advantage of this excellent Speed, transforming them into fast wallbreakers that outspeed Tapu Koko, Mewtwo, and most Speed receivers. In most cases, Zamazenta-C's Speed receiver will be the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the match, making it an exceedingly valuable donation. Pokemon like Zeraora and Victini appreciate the boosted Attack stat they receive and can create holes in the opposing team for Zamazenta-C to clean late-game hyphen, while defensive Pokemon like Tangrowth, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T enjoy their newfound bulk. Despite being primarily an offensive cleaner, Zamazenta-C can still help check dangerous attackers like Weavile and Rillaboom for its teammates. Even after a Howl boost, Zamazenta-C can still struggle to break through common defensive stalwarts like Skarmory and Slowbro, but teammates like Volcanion and Zeraora can help get past them. Zamazenta-C, despite its high natural bulk, can still struggle with Pokemon like Nidoking and Tapu Koko, so teammates like Gastrodon and Tangrowth can help patch up this weakness. Its lack of any recovery makes it susceptible to being chipped down by entry hazards, so it appreciates teammates like Landorus-T and Corviknight that can act as hazard removal as well as pivot support. Rillaboom synergizes well with Zamazenta-C thanks to its Grassy Terrain providing passive recovery and halving Earthquake's damage, allowing it to set up even against Earthquake users such as Landorus-T.</p>"

Psyshock lets it slam Zeraora and specially defensive walls that would otherwise be a problem for Alolan Raichu, such as Gastrodon and Rotom-H. Focus Blast lets Alolan Raichu blast through two of its biggest counters in Tyranitar and Ferrothorn, while Surf lets it beat Landorus-T and more reliably damage Rotom-H. Grass Knot can be used to specifically OHKO Gastrodon, Groudon, and Seismitoad, although it does little else over Surf. Nasty Plot can be used on a forced switch to OHKO or 2HKO nearly everything in the tier, although it often prefers to just attack due to its sheer wallbreaking power. Life Orb lets Alolan Raichu boost its already amazing offensive power to the extreme at the cost of longevity, while Heavy-Duty Boots lets it ignore entry hazards and not rely on the Terrain-ending Defog.</p> <p>Tapu Koko is a necessary partner, as it provides Electric Terrain and dual screens support to facilitate setup. Gods like Rayquaza, Lunala, and Mewtwo are also extremely appreciated, as they dramatically increase Alolan Raichu's Special Attack stat. Since Alolan Raichu is able to break through common Pokemon like Rotom-W and Skarmory, cleaners like Kartana and Weavile pair well. In return, they help deal with Ground-types like Gastrodon and Hippowdon and Grass-types like Tangrowth and Ferrothorn. Airborne Pokemon and Flying-types not weak to Electric-type attacks like Zapdos and Rotom-H can pressure Alolan Raichu thanks to Rising Voltage not doubling in power, while Dragon-types like Dialga and Zekrom naturally resist it. Thus, answers like Weavile, Volcanion, and the aforementioned Tapu Koko significantly help Alolan Raichu. In return, Alolan Raichu can capitalize on the damage they've dealt to either finish the game off or KO targets for said partners. Alolan Raichu's crippling weakness to the two offensive Terrain setters in Rillaboom and Tapu Lele make answers like Corviknight, Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Slowking great defensive checks. Priority attackers like Yveltal, Urshifu-R, and Weavile also heavily threaten Alolan Raichu, so answers like Slowbro, Slowking, Clefable, and Skarmory are appreciated. Entry hazard setters like Skarmory, Clefable, and Landorus-T allow Alolan Raichu to make quick progress on its forced switches, while Toxic support lets Alolan Raichu have a much easier time breaking through bulkier answers like Rotom-H and Hippowdon.</p>"

Magic Guard lets it ignore opposing entry hazards as well as absorb status moves for its teammates. Notably, it has an incredibly wide movepool featuring amazing utility moves like Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, and Aromatherapy. With a Defense donation and its fantastic defensive typing, it can switch into physical attackers like Zygarde-10%, Urshifu-R, and Zekrom. Thunder Wave cripples offensive threats like Galarian Slowking, Tapu Lele, and Mewtwo as they try to take advantage of Clefable and helps slow wallbreaking teammates get the jump on foes. Knock Off can displace items on the opposing team, notably on common switch-ins like Heatran, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh. Aromatherapy can be run to remove status conditions from its team members. Leftovers is the preferred item to run to get more passive recovery; however, Rocky Helmet can be run to chip physical attackers like Urshifu-R, Weavile, and Yveltal.</p> <p>Clefable is an amazing defensive staple on any team that can give it the required Defense stat. It pairs extremely well with high Defense gods like Necrozma-DM and Groudon; it can still make use of a lesser Defense donation like from Yveltal or Kyurem-W as well. Clefable's ability to annoy opposing walls with status, chip damage, and item removal makes it a great asset for offensive teammates. Thunder Wave variants pair up excellently with slower wallbreakers like Kyurem-W and Rillaboom, helping them break through faster checks. Aromatherapy is appreciated by teammates that stand to benefit from longer games, like Ho-Oh and Gastrodon. Psychic- and Fairy-types like Tapu Lele, Mewtwo, and Galarian Slowking appreciate it removing Leftovers and Assault Vest from Steel-types. Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon like Heatran, Galarian Slowking, and Necrozma-DM can pivot into and force out Clefable, so running answers to these Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Groudon is recommended. Special Walls like Assault Vest Tangrowth, Ho-Oh, and Slowbro are also good teammates to deal with special attackers.</p>"

Calm Mind lets it act as a wincon and offensively pressure the opposing team, while also letting it set up alongside and deal with special attackers like Yveltal and Volcarona. Utility options like Stealth Rock and Knock Off are viable alternatives to Calm Mind. Aromatherapy can be run to cure it and its teammates from status conditions, helping it outlast checks like Gastrodon and Ho-Oh that rely on Toxic to beat it. Flamethrower can be run to improve its sweeping potential and gives it a way to hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Corviknight; however, this means cleric support elsewhere on the team is needed. Heavy-Duty Boots should be ran to fix its vulnerability to entry hazards while allowing it to bluff Magic Guard. Leftovers can be run instead to help Clefable's role as a wincon. A specially defense spread can be utilized instead if Clefable receives a Special Defense donation.</p> <p>Clefable is a natural fit on stall and bulkier teams, especially when being paired up with gods that have a high Defense stat like Giratina, Necrozma-DM, and Shuckle. Defoggers like Corviknight, Ho-Oh, and Tornadus-T makes for good teammates, as entry hazards annoy Clefable if it gets its Heavy-Duty Boots knocked off. Steel-types like Necrozma-DM and Kartana could prove troublesome for Clefable, so teammates to help against these like Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Tornadus-T are greatly appreciated. Incredibly powerful special attackers like Mewtwo, Kyurem-W, and Galarian Moltres also prove troublesome for it, so specially defensive teammates like Gastrodon, Tyranitar, and Slowbro can help deal with these. Physical walls such as Buzzwole and Skarmory are mandatory alongside specially defensive variants.

The effective immunity to Toxic and Leech Seed granted by Magic Guard gives Clefable a niche over its Unaware counterpart, enabling it to avoid significant chip damage from Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Skarmory. Soft-Boiled gives Clefable a consistent form of recovery. Moonblast is a powerful STAB move that hits many targets for neutral and super effective damage, such as Rayquaza, Pheromosa, Landorus-T, Galarian Moltres, and Rotom-W. Encore can lock Pokemon such as Zamazenta-C, Galarian Moltres, and Ferrothorn into status moves, while Thunder Wave can effectively cripple the same targets. Aromatherapy fits better on stall teams that require a cleric to keep their teams healthy. Flamethrower is a final option that sacrifices extra utility for better offensive pressure against Steel-types like Necrozma-DM and Corviknight. The given EVs and nature are to maximize Clefable's physical bulk, but can be optimized depending on the god it is paired with. When paired with Shuckle, Clefable can go with maximum HP and Special Defense due to its already significantly high Defense stat. This set also works well in the Special Defense slot with Giratina and Shuckle as gods and maximum HP and Special Defense EVs to better take on Galarian Moltres and special Giratina-O.</p> <p>Magic Guard Calm Mind Clefable fits best on bulky offense and stall teams that appreciate its longevity and ability to pressure opposing teams with its setup moves. Zamazenta-C and Necrozma-DM are good pairings for bulky offense, as they appreciate Clefable's ability to spread paralysis with Thunder Wave and pressure otherwise annoying Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and opposing Clefable. Giratina and Shuckle are the best gods for stall teams, donating hefty defenses and benefiting from Clefable's cleric ability and its immunity to entry hazards. Clefable struggles versus potent physical attackers such as opposing Necrozma-DM, Kartana, and Pangoro. Skarmory and physically defensive Landorus-T are partners that can check both of those and force them out with Whirlwind and Earthquake, respectively. Clefable also struggles to handle opposing special setup sweepers such as Galarian Slowking, so a dedicated special wall such as Gastrodon should be paired with it to handle those attackers.</p>"

Adamant can be run on the Choice Band set but leaves it outsped but common foes such as Kartana.

Knock Off lets Alolan Persian take a more aggressive role, removing Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from common physical walls such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory and Heavy-Duty Boots from offensive Pokemon that might switch in like Tapu Koko. Parting Shot is a valuable pivoting move that makes it easier to bring in its teammates due to the attack drops provided. Toxic or Taunt can be used in the third slot depending on what your team values more. Toxic cripples common checks such as Tapu Koko and Buzzwole, while Taunt is useful in denying recovery from walls like Skarmory. This EV spread maximizes Alolan Persian's utility, with maximum Speed investment outspeeding key threats like Kartana, which it threatens with Foul Play. Heavy-Duty Boots is preferred over other items, as it maximizes Alolan Persian's role as a defensive pivot, letting it switch in as often as it can.</p> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots Alolan Persian fits best on balance and offensive teams that appreciate its role compression as a bulky fast pivot. Alolan Persian can take advantage of donations from various gods, with Fur Coat benefitting from any increase in Defense.

Good receivers to pair with it include other Tapu Koko checks such as Gastrodon, as well as defensive Fairy checks including Ferrothorn and Heatran. As Alolan Persian can't properly deal with Fighting-types like Buzzwole, teammates that can deal with them like Landorus-T and Tornadus-T are necessary. Consistent entry hazard removal, such as from the Rotom formes and Landorus-T, is helpful to pair with Alolan Persian, as it wants to check common Knock Off users such as Weavile and Bisharp. Rotom-W, in particular, is a good pairing as it also resists Fire and Steel, checking strong attackers such as Victini and Necrozma-DM.

Foul Play is Alolan Persian's primary attacking move, threatening to OHKO almost every physical sweeper at +1 or +2, while Knock Off gives it a less setup reliant way to make progress while also removing key items off of common switch-ins such as Clefable and Ferrothorn. Switcheroo lets Alolan Persian trade its Choice Scarf to its opponent, crippling an opposing wall or preventing a setup sweeper from ever setting up. Parting Shot rounds out its movepool, giving Alolan Persian a strong pivoting move that outspeed much of the relevant metagame, including Choice Scarf users like Kartana and Blacephalon. The EV spread reflects this, with maximum HP and Speed investment important to maintain Alolan Persian's role as a strong revenge killer while maximizing its bulk.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Alolan Persian fits best on offense and balance teams that appreciate its ability to emergency check the multitude of physical sweepers in the metagame; however, its lack of recovery makes it more suited to offensive teams. Because Alolan Persian is weak outside of Foul Play, it requires a team with strong wallbreakers to be effective. Kyogre and Rayquaza pair well with it due to their monstrous power and appreciation of Alolan Persian's pivoting ability. Alolan Persian cannot threaten many of the tier's special attackers such as Tapu Koko; pairing it with another Choice Scarf user such as Buzzwole can be helpful to maintain offensive pressure. Alolan Persian also cannot check many of the tier's Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R and Buzzwole, so pairing it with a switch-in for these Pokemon such as Clefable is a good idea.</p>"

Knock Off is a strong secondary STAB option if a few of Alolan Persian's teammates are KOed or statused, while Gunk Shot and Switcheroo compete for the third slot. Gunk Shot is an option to hit Clefable and other Fairy-types, while Switcheroo can be used to cripple potential switch-ins such as Mandibuzz and Clefable. Parting Shot gives Alolan Persian another option to avoid common switch-ins, maintaining momentum and bringing in a teammate to threaten the opponent. Black Glasses can be used if you value being able to change moves, while Choice Band boosts Alolan Persian's damage output even higher, including Gunk Shot.</p> <p>A strong Attack donation is required to break common physical walls, so it should be paired with gods such as Calyrex-I, Zekrom, and Kyurem-B. Due to Beat Up's unique Base Power mechanics, Technican Alolan Persian fits best on dedicated teams that seek to maximize its Base Power. This includes avoiding teammates with low Attack stats like Clefable and Slowking. If Alolan Persian is not using Gunk Shot, it should be paired with a strong Steel- or Poison-type to break common Fairy walls such as Tapu Fini and Clefable; Nihilego and Kartana all work well. To make Beat Up as potent as possible, Alolan Persian should be paired with multiple strong physical attackers, such as Rillaboom, Galarian Zapdos, and Buzzwole. Landorus-T is a very good match thanks to its ability to deal with Zamazenta-C and Zeraora, which outspeed and OHKO Alolan Persian with ease. Choice Scarf Kartana is another common partner, being able to clean up after opposing physical walls have been weakened and also serve as a switch-in to Tapu Koko. Pairing Alolan Persian with special attackers such as Tapu Koko, Blacephalon, and Volcanion is also needed to bypass possible walls such as Zamazenta-C and Iron Defense Skarmory. These special attackers also have a high Attack, boosting the power of Beat Up. Spikes and Stealth Rock are also useful to pair with this set to help it pick up more KOs, so setters such as Cloyster and Landorus-T make good partners.</p>"

Scald allows Slowbro to spread burns across the opposing team, possibly crippling physical attackers such as Rillaboom and Zeraora who could otherwise switch into Slowbro freely. Future Sight, mostly used in combination with Teleport, lets Slowbro support wallbreaking teammates, as it can force their checks to take Future Sight damage while trying to check them. Body Press is another option to deter possible switch-ins like Weavile, while Ice Beam nails Dragon-types like Garchomp. Slack Off keeps Slowbro healthy throughout the game, as Regenerator can often be out damaged due to Slowbro switching in repeatedly. For its item, Slowbro can choose between Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots, with Leftovers providing extra recovery while Heavy-Duty Boots allows Slowbro to dodge entry hazards while pivoting.</p> <p>Slowbro finds its home on balance and bulky offense teams where it can soft check a wide range of threats and provide safe entry to wallbreaking teammates. Slowbro pairs well with a wide variety of gods, but gods that can patch up its Special Defense like Zamazenta-C, Ho-Oh, and Necrozma-DM make especially great partners. Most wallbreakers like Zygarde-10% and Blacephalon make great teammates, as they appreciate Slowbro’s ability to help them safely switch into the field. Physical wallbreakers such as Zygarde-10% pair well with Slowbro, which can use Future Sight to threaten common checks to them like Buzzwole. Slowbro pairs well with Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM, as they resist the Grass-type moves that threaten Slowbro and provide the team with a solid physically defensive wall. Fighting-types such as Buzzwole are also good teammates, resisting Dark- and Bug-type attacks from Pokemon such as Weavile and Pheromosa that Slowbro can not switch into. Slowbro is not able to check every special attacker, as common Pokemon such as Tapu Koko commonly have an Electric-type move to hit Slowbro with, making switch-ins to these Pokemon such as Rotom-H necessary; they can also be checked with sufficient offensive pressure from teammates like Rillaboom and Dhelmise. Slowbro also has good physical defense and can be used as a soft check for certain physical attackers such as Urshifu-R and Necrozma-DM, but should not be confused with a physical wall.</p>"

Transformation copies donated stats, allowing Ditto to still outspeed Speed receivers and hit as hard as Attack receivers. Imposter's also useful against stall teams by effectively giving infinite PP and copying recovery moves. Ditto prefers having its Choice Scarf removed against stall teams to switch moves and maximize its PP stall capabilities. 252 HP EVs boost the only stat Ditto retains after Imposter activates, while 252 Special Attack EVs and a Quiet nature boost its Future Sight after transforming into a Pokemon like Slowking.</p> <p>Ditto almost exclusively finds its place on stall teams to handle offensive setup threats that its teammates struggle to handle. It struggles to switch in directly against most foes, so slow pivot moves make for great support. Examples include Teleport from Slowbro or Slowking and U-turn from Corviknight. Entry hazards prevent Ditto from switching in repeatedly, so teammates that can reliably remove them such as Mandibuzz and Ho-Oh are appreciated. Unaware users like Pyukumuku, Quagsire, and Clefable or Clear Smog users like Gastrodon and Amoonguss can handle bulky setup Pokemon with recovery, such as Calm Mind Galarian Slowking and Bulk Up Buzzwole, which outlast Ditto one-on-one. An ally with Regenerator, such as the aforementioned Slowbro or Ho-Oh, in tandem with Ditto can outstall defensive Regenerator Pokemon, effectively forcing them out. A defensive god with a high HP stat like Giratina theoretically complements Ditto well, but Ditto is able to go in any teamslot, especially the Attack and Special Attack slots, which stall teams don't benefit from much anyway. While the HP increase is beneficial, another bulky Pokemon can often take better advantage of it, usually Skarmory.</p>"

Protect is mandatory to ensure Vaporeon can recover HP against switch-ins that threaten to KO it like Tapu Koko and Magnezone, as well as scout against Choice-item users, notably Rillaboom. Scald prevents Vaporeon from becoming complete Taunt bait and threatens a burn on potential switch-ins such as Kartana. In the last moveslot, Flip Turn provides a slow pivot option and turns Vaporeon into a good Wish passer. Toxic cripples bulky Water-types, in particular Gastrodon and Volcanion, that completely wall Vaporeon otherwise. Heal Bell is another option for teams that appreciate a cleric. Heavy-Duty Boots is usually the item of choice for more safety against hazard stack, but Leftovers is an option as it synergizes well with Protect. If Vaporeon runs Flip Turn, minimum Speed investment should be run to allow a teammate to get Wish safely.</p> <p>Vaporeon is usually seen on balance and bulky offense builds that appreciate its ability to heal teammates and pivot with Flip Turn while compensating for its momentum drain. Gods with high Defense like Dialga and Necrozma-DM make Vaporeon bulky enough to even handle strong physical threats, particularly Rayquaza, but even a lower donation from Kyurem-W or Ho-Oh is valuable. Weavile and Zygarde-10% can more comfortably trade damage with opposing walls with Vaporeon giving them a second wind, while Landorus-T and Dialga's lack of recovery is remedied. Grass-types in Rillaboom and Tangrowth handle Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zeraora which trouble Vaporeon. In return, Vaporeon answers Fire-types such as Ho-Oh and Choice Scarf Blacephalon for them. Grass-types themselves give Vaporeon problems, making Skarmory, Buzzwole, and the aforementioned Fire-types great partners as well, while Vaporeon can absorb Water-type attacks aimed at them. Vaporeon tends to invite special setup sweepers like Galarian Moltres and Galarian Slowking in due to its tendency to use Protect, so answers to them such as Tapu Koko and Necrozma-DM are necessary.</p>"

Discharge provides a consistent STAB attack that can spread paralysis on opponents; Volt Switch can be used instead and allows Zapdos to maintain momentum and pivot out of checks. Hurricane is a secondary STAB attack that crucially targets Electric-resistant foes such as Landorus-T and Rillaboom and carries a non-trivial confusion chance. Heat Wave is an option that deals less damage but can reliably beat Kartana and invalidate Ferrothorn as a check. Defog lets Zapdos control entry hazards for its team, helped by the fact that it can threaten the 2 most common Spikes users in Ferrothorn and Skarmory. Static allows Zapdos to potentially paralyse users of common contact moves like Knock Off and U-turn such as Rillaboom and Tornadus-T. 136 Speed EVs are used to outspeed neutral natured Rillaboom.</p> <p>Zapdos's best fit is on balance teams that need help checking Grass- and Fighting-type attackers like Rillaboom, Kartana, and Urshifu-R.

Zapdos's Defog means that it and Landorus-T can form a solid physically defensive Defogger core, with Landorus-T able to fit Toxic to wear down shared checks like Gastrodon. Having a secondary source of entry hazard removal also supports Zapdos after it loses its Heavy-Duty Boots to Knock Off Kartana. The threat of paralysis from Discharge and Static allows Zapdos to scare out many fast threats, such as Zamazenta-C and Kartana, so frail wallbreakers like Zygarde-10% and Weavile enjoy Zapdos's presence. These wallbreakers enjoy Zapdos's ability to clear entry hazards and pressure setters like Ferrothorn and Skarmory as well.

Fiery Wrath is a more consistent attack that lacks Hurricane's raw power, but provides crucial coverage against Necrozma-DM, Rotom-W, and Skarmory. Nasty Plot overwhelms bulkier teams and reduces the number of times Galarian Moltres needs to successfully hit Hurricane, and Agility lets Galarian Moltres outspeed revenge killers and all relevant Choice Scarf users, including Kartana. Thanks to its impressive bulk for a sweeper, Galarian Moltres can usually set up the boosting move of its choice, and with dual screens support or proper prediction, it can often get both. Heavy-Duty Boots helps preserve its HP to allow for easier setup. On teams with dual screens support, Galarian Moltres can use Weakness Policy instead of Heavy-Duty Boots. This, alongside its good bulk, lets it set up on a super effective attack and potentially boost its Special Attack and Speed in the same turn.</p> <p>Galarian Moltres fits best on hyper offense teams looking for a special attacking sweeper, although it fits on some balance teams as well.

Additionally, entry hazard support from teammates like Cloyster, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-T helps wear down opposing Tapu Koko and Gastrodon. Since Galarian Moltres lacks any form of recovery, it appreciates pivots like Tapu Koko to get it in safely.

Scald is the preferred STAB move, as its burn chance can chip down defensive Pokemon like Tangrowth and Ferrothorn and cripple physical attackers like Zeraora, Rillaboom, and Weavile that may try to switch in. Future Sight can force many Pokemon out to disrupt an opponent's momentum and also deals significant chunks of damage to neutral targets if it lands. It also allows Slowking to aid physical wallbreaking teammates by setting up Future Sight, slow pivoting them onto the field safely, and forcing the opposing physical wall to take Future Sight damage the same turn it switches in. Slack Off is necessary to keep Slowking healthy, as Regenerator is often not enough to keep it fully healthy. Teleport is an excellent way to bring in frail teammates safely, as Slowking has good matchups versus common Pokemon like Necrozma-DM, Heatran, Ho-Oh, and Calyrex-I and can switch into them and stomach a hit before pivoting out. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Slowking pivot around more freely, but Leftovers can be run if reliable entry hazard removal is present. Regenerator allows Slowking to still recover HP while pivoting out. A Relaxed nature alongside minimum Speed IVs ensure that Slowking will move last as often as possible and speed tie with Slowbro and opposing Slowking when pivoting.</p> <p>Slowking should receive its Defense stat from bulky gods like Necrozma-DM, Zamazenta-C, and Calyrex-I. Frail Pokemon like Zeraora and Weavile, as well as setup sweepers like Necrozma-DM, Kartana, and Mimikyu, love to be brought in by Teleport. Those same Pokemon also love Slowking's ability to spread burns, chipping walls and crippling physical attackers. Slowking pairs especially well with physical wallbreakers, as their checks are more significantly pressured by Future Sight. Slowking can force out Fire-types like Heatran and Victini locked into V-create, which is appreciated by Steel-type teammates like Ferrothorn and Skarmory. Slowking is vulnerable to Electric-types like Zeraora and Tapu Koko, so Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp are good teammates. Slowking's Psychic typing makes it weak to Knock Off, teammates that resist Dark like Buzzwole, Clefable, and Tapu Fini are useful to have around. Slowking pairs well with other Regenerator users like Tornadus-T, Ho-Oh, and Tangrowth, as they can form infamous Regenerator cores and soft check a wide range of threats.</p>"

Galarian Slowking can also run defensive and RegenVest sets while receiving Defense or Special Defense from its god and leveraging its unique typing, but is usually outclassed by regular Slowking and Slowbro thanks to their Teleport. Galarian Slowking can also utilize Trick with Black Sludge or Choice Specs to cripple its few reliable switch-ins like Reuniclus.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Regenerator Psychic-types</strong>: Reuniclus, Slowbro, and Slowking receiving Special Defense or using Assault Vest can take any of Galarian Slowking's attacks with ease and retaliate with Knock Off or slow pivoting.

Thanks to Regenerator, it can come in frequently to soften up teams in the early- to mid-game while still remaining healthy for a possible sweep. Nasty Plot augments its wallbreaking ability, especially since it can recover any health lost setting up with Regenerator. Sludge Bomb's poison chance can annoy otherwise good switch-ins like RegenVest Reuniclus while also scoring super effective damage against common walls like Clefable and Tangrowth. Psyshock provides mixed coverage for specially defensive foes like Ho-Oh and Gastrodon. Flamethrower consistently hits Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Skarmory; Focus Blast is an alternative that beats Heatran and the rare Tyranitar, but at the cost of accuracy and hitting Lunala and the occasional Aegislash.</p> <p>Galarian Slowking works best with a Speed donation from fast gods like Zamazenta-C, Mewtwo, and Pheromosa to force out as many offensive threats as possible, although it is still viable with slower gods like Yveltal and Kyurem-W thanks to the power of Regenerator. To get the most use out of its wallbreaking ability, Galarian Slowking appreciates pivoting from teammates like Tapu Koko, Rillaboom, and Slowbro. It also appreciates entry hazard removal from Landorus-T and Rotom-W. Despite its awesome coverage, it will have trouble beating a few key targets, namely specially defensive Corviknight and Necrozma-DM for Focus Blast variants and Heatran for Flamethrower sets; teammates like Slowbro can reliably switch into these threats. Speaking of Slowbro, Galarian Slowking can struggle to outdamage its specially defensive set's Regenerator, so teammates that take advantage of it like Tapu Koko are excellent partners. Galarian Slowking is often forced out by revenge killers, so a solid defensive backbone to fall back on like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory is helpful; they can also set entry hazards to wear down Galarian Slowking's checks like Necrozma-DM and RegenVest Reuniclus.</p>"

Stealth Rock is significantly better on Shuckle god teams, which tend to be bulkier and not need Sticky Web support as much. Encore deters setup sweepers from using Shuckle as setup bait and can lock foes into a move that allows teammates to switch in safely. Infestation traps foes, dealing consistent chip damage to them, and pairs well with Encore to switch in teammates and gain momentum; Toxic is also an option to help spread status. Mental Herb prevents Shuckle from outright losing to Taunt users like Yveltal and Tapu Fini by guaranteeing it can set one entry hazard, which can be pivotal in certain matchups. Sturdy protects Shuckle from OHKOs against foes like Kartana and setup sweepers, while its EVs let Shuckle tank hits from special setup sweepers like Lunala and Galarian Moltres, both of which can be threatening for Shuckle teams.</p> <p>As a non-Uber Pokemon, Shuckle must be used in the HP slot in order to pass its stats. Luckily, its base 20 HP would be an albatross anyway. While Shuckle itself is a liability to most teams, it shines as a god due passing exceptional base 230 Defense and Special Defense. These high defensive stats can hyper-charge two Pokemon to cover almost the entire tier. Some example Defense receivers would be Calm Mind Clefable, Corviknight, and Galarian Slowking. Special Defense receivers are much more varied, with offensive Pokemon like Rillaboom and Kartana turning into potent setup sweepers, and physically defensive Pokemon like Slowbro and Hippowdon becoming blanket checks to both physical and special attackers. However, Shuckle teams are slightly restricted by needing Pokemon to receive its terrible Attack, Special Attack, and Speed. It's wise to pick Pokemon that are naturally good without receiving any boosted stats. Using strong special attackers in the Attack slot like Tapu Koko, Blacephalon, Gengar, and Heatran allows the team to keep offensive pressure, while strong physical attackers like Weavile, Landorus-T, Kartana, and Blaziken fit in the Special Attack slot well. For the Speed slot, Pokemon like Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Mandibuzz can still perform their roles with lowered Speed, provide slow pivoting to get wallbreakers in, and are helpful against Trick Room.</p>"

Encore prevents foes from taking advantage of Shuckle's passivity and potentially gives a teammate free setup opportunities against Pokemon locked into Rapid Spin or Defog. With an HP increase, Final Gambit can take out many offensive threats if Shuckle is at full HP and provide a teammate with a free switch in. Mental Herb guarantees at least one entry hazard, even against a Taunt user such as Tornadus-T or Heatran, while Red Card prevents Shuckle from being setup fodder. Sturdy prevents Shuckle from being OHKOed by powerful attacks from Pokemon such as Araquanid.</p> <p>Shuckle should only be used in hyper offense teams that can make full use of Sticky Web and Stealth Rock. Rayquaza, Pheromosa, and Mewtwo are the most common gods to pair with Shuckle and all significantly bolster its HP; In particular, Sticky Web can patch up the middling Speed of Rayquaza and its Speed receivers Pokemon that deter Rapid Spin and Defog are necessary, making Ghost-type spinblockers like Mimikyu and Polteageist as well as Defiant Pokemon like Bisharp and Galarian Zapdos great choices. Other powerful offensive threats such as Galarian Moltres, Victini, Galarian Slowking, and Weavile can keep up the pressure to overwhelm the opposing team; in particular, the former three take advantage of Sticky Web to outspeed foes.</p>"

Taunt is an option to prevent setup and Defog, but Skarmory's low Speed makes it an unreliable option.

Skarmory is able to comfortably wall most physical threats, including Dhelmise, Bisharp, Excadrill, and Weavile. Body Press works off of its high Defense stat and threatens many of the Pokemon it walls, like Excadrill, but Brave Bird is an option for better neutral coverage and the ability to hit Ghost-types, especially Dhelmise, at the cost of taking recoil. Spikes punishes switch-ins and takes advantage of the free turns Skarmory generates. Iron Defense allows Skarmory to check setup sweepers as well, boosting alongside them while also powering up Body Press; Whirlwind is another option in the last moveslot to phaze set-up foes that Skarmory cannot KO. Rocky Helmet lets Skarmory punish physical attackers even more heavily, especially pivots that can otherwise wear down Skarmory, while Leftovers provides extra recovery. Maximum Defense investment is required to check the high-powered attackers common in Godly Gift and has the nice side effect of also powering up Body Press.</p> <p>Skarmory is a good option for stall and balance teams looking for a catch-all physical wall. Since most Uber Pokemon have a high base HP, Skarmory can work with a wide range of Gods, but some of the best fits are Giratina, Yveltal, and Kyurem-W. Wallbreakers like Victini and Zeraora appreciate Skarmory's Spikes, which help wear down their checks, and its ability to switch into would-be revenge killers that force them out, such as Landorus-T. Since Skarmory's Special Defense is poor, it appreciates bulky teammates like RegenVest Tangrowth and Gastrodon to sponge special hits aimed at it. Due to its Electric and Fire weaknesses, Skarmory is unable to wall Victini, Zeraora, and Dracozolt; reliable switch-ins to these foes like Hippowdown and Quagsire make good partners, especially since Skarmory covers their Grass weaknesses.</p>"

Thunder Wave cripples offensive threats like Urshifu-R and is preferred on more offensive builds, while Toxic puts defensive Pokemon like Landorus-T on a timer and is a better fit on stall teams. Sand Stream augments Tyranitar's Special Defense further, making it even more formidable. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Tyranitar from being chipped by entry hazards, which is important because Tyranitar has no reliable recovery outside of Rest, while Leftovers gives it a modicum of recovery.

With an adequate Speed stat, even just base 90, Dragon Dance allows Tyranitar to outspeed most of the unboosted tier at +1. Ice Punch is the preferred fourth move to hit Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Zygarde-10%, but Tyranitar can also run Stealth Rock if the team lacks a setter.

Flare Blitz can be used over Sacred Fire if more PP is valued. Ho-Oh can remove entry hazards from the field thanks to Defog and can do so while threatening the most popular Spikers, Skarmory and Ferrothorn, making it especially good at denying Spikes stacking. Recover is an option if alternate entry hazard control is available, giving it even more sustainability on top of Regenerator; Recover is preferred over Roost to maintain its immunity to Ground moves against foes like Gastrodon. Earthquake gives Ho-Oh the ability to counter Heatran, hitting it 4x super effectively while also doing more damage to Victini and Zekrom. Whirlwind allows Ho-Oh to phaze setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Clefable, Nasty Plot Tornadus-T, and Quiver Dance Volcarona before they get too dangerous, though Brave Bird can be used over Whirlwind, as it can take Volcarona out of the game completely and can hit Pokemon that switch into Sacred Fire such as Kyogre much harder.

Ferrothorn especially goes great with Ho-Oh as it can pair Leech Seed and Spikes with Ho-Oh's status spreading to force heavy chip damage onto the opposing team.

It also pairs well with Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Gastrodon, as they can cover Ho-Oh's Electric weakness and like being donated a high Special Defense stat.

Earthquake rounds out Ho-Oh's coverage, hitting foes like Zekrom, Flash Fire Heatran, and Tyranitar that can stomach Ho-Oh's other attacks.

Ho-Oh is a reliable wallbreaker, especially given its favorable matchup with physically defensive stalwarts like Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and even Landorus-T, so fast cleaners like Zeraora and Kartana make fantastic partners. Ho-Oh cannot do meaningful damage to HP Rotom-W and Rotom-H, so teammates that can reliably threaten them like Zygarde-10% also make good partners. While Ho-Oh retains excellent bulk, it still prefers teammates like Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T taking hits for it and pivoting it in safely. Ho-Oh is also slow, so teammates that can spread paralysis like Ferrothorn or reliably revenge kill faster threats like Zeraora make great partners.</p>"

Toxic puts opposing walls, especially Gastrodon, on a timer and allows Kyogre to more easily stall them out. Thunder Wave cripples common offensive switch-ins like Rillaboom more consistently than Scald, and it can let Kyogre beat walls with recovery by fishing for a full paralysis. Protect is an option to maximize Leftovers recovery, force Choice-locked pivots to reveal what move they are locked into, and rack up Toxic damage against Gastrodon. Roar is an option to prevent slower phazers from forcing it out, and Sleep Talk allows Kyogre to be less passive while asleep. Kyogre can also run an offensive Calm Mind set with Scald, Ice Beam, and Thunder, but it is often an awkward mid-ground option between Choice Specs and defensive Calm Mind.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gastrodon</strong>: Gastrodon is able to reliably switch into all of Kyogre's attacks and has reliable recovery to outlast Choice item variants, but it can struggle to beat Calm Mind sets on its own. It also fears Toxic from Choice Specs Kyogre.</p> <p><strong>Assault Vest Grass-types</strong>: Assault Vest Tangrowth and Rillaboom are able to switch into Kyogre's Water Spout and force it out with their own STAB moves. However, they still have to watch out for Choice Specs-boosted Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Kyogre is very slow and can be forced out by powerful attacks from foes like Zeraora and Rillaboom. Even attacks that cannot OHKO it, like Zygarde-10%'s Thousand Arrows, are dangerous, as they severely cut into Water Spout's power.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Since Kyogre is heavily dependent on Water Spout for damage, any chip damage, especially from Stealth Rock and Spikes, reduces its power and makes it easier to wall.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Kyogre may have fairly mediocre stats as a donor, but it is a fierce wallbreaker that utilizes rain-boosted Water Spout to break opposing teams in two. Full power Water Spout OHKOes or, more rarely, 2HKOes the vast majority of the metagame; its semi-reliable switch-ins are limited to Water Absorb or Storm Drain users and exceptionally bulky Pokemon that resist Water, like Slowbro and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Even gods that resist Water like Kyurem-W are at risk of getting OHKOed. Origin Pulse is a still-powerful backup option if Kyogre is low on health, but the drop in power and accuracy is noticeable. Thunder is useful for hitting Water-types, especially Volcanion and opposing Kyogre, and Ice Beam is its best option to hit the aforementioned bulky Grass-types, as well as Dragon-types like Giratina and Kommo-o. Toxic is another option to cripple Gastrodon on the switch. Since Kyogre is able to overwhelm most foes without resorting to coverage moves, Choice Specs is its best option to maximize damage. A Modest nature is preferred to improve damage rolls against targets like Kyurem-W, especially since Kyogre has a fairly poor Speed tier even with Timid, but Timid is an option to at worst Speed tie other base 90 Speed gods like Groudon and opposing Kyogre, as well as reliably outspeeding Excadrill.</p> <p>Choice Specs Kyogre is a pure wallbreaker and requires dedicated team support to make the most of its abilities. Especially since Water Spout decreases in power with every bit of chip damage, Kyogre strongly appreciates pivots like Tapu Koko and Landorus-T bringing it onto the field safely. Entry hazards also severely cut into its longevity and power, so reliable Defoggers like Tornadus-T and Corviknight make excellent teammates; they can pivot it in safely as well. Conversely, entry hazard support from teammates like Clefable and Ferrothorn helps put bulkier foes like Kyurem-W into KO range of Kyogre. While Kyogre's Water Spout can overwhelm even bulky threats that resist Water, it cannot touch Water Absorb and Storm Drain users; Gastrodon, in particular, is the bane of Kyogre's existence. Teammates that can overwhelm Gastrodon like Grass Knot Tapu Koko make excellent partners. Tapu Koko also helps overwhelm or wear down Tangrowth, another common Kyogre check. Tapu Koko and other fast cleaners can also finish up the opposing team once Kyogre has broken the defensive core.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Kyogre still possesses tremendous power with rain-boosted Water Spout and can use its newfound Speed tier to force out or revenge kill most unboosted foes. Water Spout is far and away Kyogre's most powerful attack and can OHKO most offensive Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Zeraora, and it still threatens to 2HKO a wide range of defensive stalwarts like Clefable without a boosting item. Origin Pulse provides Kyogre with a still-powerful STAB move after it has taken chip damage, but the drop in power and accuracy is very noticeable. It is often Kyogre's best option for cleaning late-game after it has taken chip damage. Thunder hits Water-types such as Volcanion, Tapu Fini, and opposing Kyogre for super effective damage, while Ice Beam allows it to revenge kill Rayquaza and Kommo-o, as well as fast Grass-types like Speed receiver Dhelmise and weakened Kartana. Without a damage-boosting item, however, Kyogre's coverage options lack power by Godly Gift standards and can still fail to 2HKO bulkier targets like Assault Vest Tangrowth.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Kyogre is a good revenge killer and secondary wallbreaker for balance and bulky offense teams, as it outspeeds all common unboosted Pokemon bar Regieleki and still possesses tremendous STAB power. Since Kyogre donates a powerful base 150 Special Attack but a measly base 90 Speed, it is easy to pair with a powerful special wallbreaker like Galarian Moltres to overwhelm the opposing defensive core, with Kyogre serving as the revenge killer and cleaner. Since Kyogre abhors chip damage, it loves to be brought in via pivoting from teammates like Rotom-W and Landorus-T. Both of them are also able to provide crucial Defog support, preventing entry hazards from cutting into Water Spout's power. Foes with Water Absorb and Storm Drain prevent Kyogre from freely using Water Spout, so teammates like Grass Knot Tapu Koko and Nidoqueen make great choices to overwhelm these threats. Bulky Grass-types like Assault Vest Tangrowth and Rillaboom stomach Water Spout, so teammates like Corviknight that can easily switch into both are recommended.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Kyogre forgoes the immediate power of Water Spout and uses its titanic bulk to set up and overwhelm teams that cannot reliably threaten it, which includes many balance and stall teams. Scald is the STAB move of choice, as its excellent 30% burn chance deters would-be checks like Zeraora and Rillaboom from switching in. Several notable physical attackers are unable to break Kyogre's Substitute after a burn, like Garchomp and Weavile. Kyogre can also attempt to spread burns early in the game, as many teams won't be able to reliably 3HKO it if their primary physical attackers get burned. Calm Mind allows Kyogre to set up and overwhelm even the bulkiest of defensive cores, and after two boosts it is virtually impossible to 3HKO with special attacks. Rest is the primary option in the third moveslot to recover health and cure status, and it pairs excellently with Calm Mind's Special Defense boosts. Substitute is another option that blocks status in addition to Clear Smog, prevents phazing with Dragon Tail, and provides protection against critical hits, but it requires Kyogre to rely entirely on Leftovers for recovery. Ice Beam is Kyogre's best option for a secondary attack to hit Tangrowth and Gastrodon.</p> <p>Calm Mind Kyogre fits well on balance teams that want a bulky sweeper to overwhelm even the bulkiest of defensive cores. Unlike offensive Kyogre sets, Calm Mind Kyogre is able to boost past normal checks like Assault Vest Tangrowth lacking Power Whip and Gastrodon on its own, albeit at the cost of immediate power. Kyogre appreciates bulky teammates like Corviknight and Landorus-T that can switch into the Grass- and Electric-type attacks aimed at it, respectively. They both can also pivot Kyogre back onto the field to give it another chance to set up or fish for a burn. Kyogre is slow and also thus lacks a good Speed stat to donate, so strong revenge killers like Rillaboom are recommended; Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain also doubles Kyogre's passive recovery and aids in setup. Clerics like Clefable make great teammates, as they can either wake Kyogre after it uses Rest or remove an untimely Toxic that slipped in before Substitute.</p>"

Defensive Groudon can opt to spread other status effects with Thunder Wave or Lava Plume. However, no Toxic or Swords Dance means physically bulky walls like Slowking and Gastrodon can comfortably deal with it. Dragon Tail and Roar are also options to deal with dangerous setup sweepers such as Espeon and Clefable, respectively. A bulkier set with Bulk Up and Substitute can surprise foes such as Landorus-T that struggle to break Substitute as Groudon sets up. While Groudon can run a specially defensive set, its vulnerability to common special attackers like Kyurem-W, Galarian Moltres, and Volcanion makes it outclassed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Rillaboom, Kartana, and Dhelmise are strong enough to break through Groudon's sturdy Defense. Tangrowth can also beat defensive Groudon one-on-one thanks to its great physical bulk. However, none of them appreciate Heat Crash.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Physical Walls</strong>: Even with Swords Dance, Groudon struggles to break defensive stalwarts like Rotom-W and defensive Yveltal. Unaware Pokemon like Clefable, Quagsire, and Pyukumuku can even ignore its boosts altogether, with the former also usually having Aromatherapy to cure its Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Groudon relies solely on Leftovers for recovery. As such, repeated attacks from the likes of Rayquaza, Urshifu-R, and Zygarde-10% can eventually wear it down. In particular, Ice-types like Kyurem-W and Weavile can hit it super effectively, while Fire-types such as Blacephalon and opposing Victini can use Groudon's sun to their advantage.</p> <p><strong>Status Effects</strong>: Burn and poison negate Leftovers, with the former completely gutting Groudon's offensive capabilities, while the latter can cut its sweep short.

Groudon is a good Stealth Rock setter thanks to its ability to pressure and force out common Defoggers like Ho-Oh and Tornadus-T. Despite having lower accuracy than Earthquake, Precipice Blades is noticeably stronger, allowing Groudon to nab more KOs, such as an OHKO on Victini and Zygarde-10% at +0 and Necrozma-DM and Zamazenta-C at +2, all while avoiding damage reduction from Grassy Terrain. Stone Edge targets Flying-types like Yveltal, Rayquaza, and Ho-Oh, while Heat Crash more directly pressures Corviknight. Swords Dance helps Groudon force out defensive Pokemon that can comfortably take its hits or clear its Stealth Rock, most notably Landorus-T and Magic Guard Clefable. Alternatively, Toxic cripples Landorus-T and other switch-ins like Tangrowth. 16 Speed EVs help Groudon outpace neutral natured Magnezone without a Speed donation, as well as Victini at -1.</p> <p>Defensive Groudon is best used on bulky offense builds that can make use of sun. Fire-types are natural partners, thanks to Drought supercharging their attacks and their ability to cover for Groudon's Grass and Ice weaknesses. Victini is perhaps the best partner, using Groudon's sun and great Attack in combination with V-create to overwhelm even bulky Fire-resistant foes like Ho-Oh and Slowbro. Heatran is also notable thanks to its ability to take Fire-type attacks that Groudon teams tend to struggle against while also benefitting from Groudon's Speed donation and Stealth Rock to better act as a trapper. Defense receivers like Clefable, Alolan Persian, and Gastrodon act as secondary physical walls to make up for Groudon's lack of reliable recovery. The former two can provide pivoting and deal with physical threats that Groudon struggles against like Weavile, Kyurem-B, and Kartana, while Gastrodon can take on Kyurem-B and Choice Scarf Victini. Clefable and Gastrodon also absorb Scald and Knock Off that would cripple Groudon. Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Corviknight appreciate Groudon's defensive donations to help clear away entry hazards.

Stone Edge nails Flying-types like Ho-Oh, Rayquaza, and Tornadus-T and gives Groudon great neutral coverage. Boosted by sun, Heat Crash is the best option against Landorus-T, Skarmory, and Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Tangrowth. Alternatively, Rock Polish patches up Groudon's mediocre Speed and turns it into a late-game cleaner. Depending on the team, Groudon can choose between several items. Leftovers helps it utilize its defensive stats, while Life Orb increases its damage output, allowing Groudon to OHKO Clefable and Slowbro with +2 Precipice Blades. Lum Berry is also viable to set up against foes that threaten to burn Groudon, such as Rotom-W and Gastrodon.

V-create lets Rayquaza overpower Pokemon that resist Dragon Ascent such as Necrozma-DM, Corviknight, Skarmory, and Zamazenta-C. Extreme Speed allows Rayquaza to finish off chipped Pokemon like Weavile, Tapu Koko, and Alolan Raichu. Earthquake still dents Zamazenta-C and Excadrill without lowering Rayquaza's stats and also provides coverage against Tyranitar, Tapu Koko, and Heatran. However, Earthquake is significantly weaker and fails to 2HKO physically defensive Necrozma-DM. Scale Shot is another option that turns Rayquaza into a potential late-game cleaner thanks to its Speed boost and gives it a chance to break Lunala but it suffers from inconsistent damage; Outrage is an option for burst damage against bulkier threats like Giratina and Zekrom, but locking Rayquaza into it for two to three turns is a steep penalty if any Fairy-types remain on the opposing side.</p> <p>Choice Band Rayquaza fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that can get it in safely, often via pivoting, so teammates like Rotom-W, Tapu Koko, and Landorus-T are appreciated. Its passable defensive stats give it a notable role as a hyper offense god over Pheromosa, letting it support fast threats like Weavile as well as defensive setup threats like Clefable and Swords Dance Kartana. Rayquaza's high offenses make it a fantastic donor to fast, Speed-boosting, or priority-reliant teammates like Zygarde-10%, Galarian Moltres, Tapu Koko, and Rillaboom.

Similarly, an Adamant nature leaves it outsped by more offensive Pokemon post-donation, like Tapu Koko and Noivern, but is an option on Scale Shot sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Hippowdon, Buzzwole, Skarmory, Tangrowth, and Corviknight can switch in and sponge any attack from Garchomp if it hasn't set up. They can then disrupt its sweep attempt with Whirlwind, Toxic, Stun Spore, or setup of their own.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Walls</strong>: Pyukumuku, Clefable, and Quagsire have no trouble handling Garchomp thanks to ignoring its boosts and healing its damage.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Ice Beam from Tyranitar or Ice Punch from Buzzwole can surprise Garchomp and heavily damage it, if not outright OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users</strong>: Pokemon with Choice Scarf like Tapu Lele or a Speed-boosting ability like Arctozolt can outspeed and revenge kill Garchomp before Scale Shot, but only then. Alternatively, priority moves such as Ice Shard from Mamoswine and Weavile and Grassy Glide from Rillaboom can take advantage of the Defense drops from Scale Shot.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Garchomp struggles to do its job properly if it is statused. Burn cuts its damage in half, paralysis from Tangrowth or Amoonguss makes it far easier to outspeed and revenge kill, and poison puts its sweep on a timer.</p>",

Earthquake is strong and reliable, threatening common Pokemon such as Heatran and Galarian Slowking. Scale Shot allows Garchomp to attack while further raising its Speed, making it more difficult to revenge kill. Fire Fang targets Grass-type foes that can handle Earthquake like Tangrowth and Ferrothorn, as well as others like Skarmory and Corviknight, providing perfect neutral coverage alongside Earthquake and Scale Shot. Stone Edge can be used instead to heavily damage Yveltal, Mandibuzz, and Ho-Oh, with the former two heavily threatening Garchomp with Foul Play and the latter with a burn from Sacred Fire. Leftovers provides longevity as Garchomp sets up.</p> <p>Garchomp best fits on bulky offense teams as a late-game sweeper or hyper offense ones as a wallbreaker. A Speed donation from Zamazenta, Pheromosa, or Mewtwo helps it force more offensive Pokemon out such as Zygarde-10% and Noivern, allowing it to get a Swords Dance up more easily. Entry hazards, like Ferrothorn's Spikes and Heatran's Stealth Rock, compound damage throughout the game, putting Pokemon like Buzzwole and Slowking in Garchomp's KO range late-game. Magnezone can trap and eliminate Corviknight and Skarmory, making it a great partner. Special attackers that invite Heatran and Galarian Slowking in, especially those with a pivot move like Tapu Koko or Tornadus-T, are also great options. Pokemon such as Weavile and Kartana work with Garchomp to overwhelm shared checks, allowing one to sweep. The latter can also break past physically defensive Unaware walls like Clefable and Quagsire, which Garchomp can't get past. Dual screens support from the likes of Alolan Ninetales and Grimmsnarl helps Garchomp set up safely and remedies its Defense drop from Scale Shot. Scale Shot's inconsistency can make bulky Flying-type Pokemon, namely Ho-Oh and Landorus-T, troublesome, making teammates that can take advantage of them like Urshifu-R and Cloyster valuable. Psychic Surge from Tapu Lele can prevent priority attacks like Weavile's Ice Shard from exploiting Scale Shot's Defense drop.</p>"

Swords Dance capitalizes on the free turns Weavile generates by forcing out slower threats like Zygarde-10%, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T, giving it the raw power necessary to break through opposing walls. Triple Axel is Weavile's most powerful move and hits common defensive stalwarts like Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, Giratina, and Yveltal. Knock Off has great coverage with Triple Axel and removes items, weakening common walls like Skarmory and Rotom-W that can otherwise withstand its attacks. Ice Shard is able to pick off weakened faster threats like Dragon Dance Rayquaza, Speed receiver Landorus-T, Scale Shot Garchomp, and any heavily weakened foe. Weavile can also forgo priority to run extra coverage in Poison Jab, which can bypass Tapu Fini, or Low Kick, which is its best option against Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Weavile likes to receive Attack from gods like Necrozma-DM, Rayquaza, and Zekrom; however, thanks to its already good Attack and Speed, it can let a teammate take these in-demand stats and still perform well with its base offenses. Tapu Koko is a great partner for Weavile, as it lures in and pivots on Ground-types like Landorus-T, giving Weavile a great entry point. Tapu Koko also threatens Tapu Fini and Skarmory, two of Weavile's better checks. Many powerful wallbreakers like Zygarde-10%, Victini, and Swords Dance Necrozma-DM love Weavile's ability to finish off foes with priority and its excellent Speed tier. Weavile is quite frail, so it likes being pivoted in by Pokemon like Slowking, Slowbro, and Landorus-T.

Since it is exceedingly frail, it appreciates offensive pivots like Tapu Koko and Zeraora bringing it in safely. It also has additional synergy with Electric-type attackers, as it heavily pressures opposing Ground- and Grass-types that can otherwise stomach their attacks.

Weavile synergizes well with other fast wallbreakers like Nasty Plot Tornadus-T, Dragon Dance Zygarde-10%, and Tapu Koko who can finish off teams after Weavile has weakened them. Weavile is vulnerable to Stealth Rock, so it likes having Defog users like Corviknight, Tornadus-T, and Rotom-W around.

Body Press is Magnezone's best option against Ferrothorn and Excadrill, which don't fear Thunderbolt. When combined with Iron Defense, Magnezone can muscle through Necrozma-DM and easily shrug off most physical attacks from the Steel-types it traps. Thunderbolt is Magnezone's best attack when unboosted and heavily damages Skarmory and Corviknight, although the latter can take two hits with a high enough Special Defense donation. Magnet Rise alongside Air Balloon lets Magnezone trap even Excadrill and Necrozma-DM variants with Earthquake; however, Substitute can be used to avoid Leech Seed from Ferrothorn and potentially get an extra KO. Toxic is another option for Magnezone to avoid becoming deadweight against teams without a Steel-type, crippling common switch-ins such as Landorus-T and Tangrowth. If Magnezone chooses to forgo Air Balloon, Leftovers helps it use Substitute more often, while Expert Belt makes Corviknight more likely to be 2HKOed.

Giga Drain gives Tangrowth passive recovery, while Power Whip lets Tangrowth damage Calm Mind users like Tapu Fini, which would otherwise set up on it.

Flame Body over Flash Fire potentially punishes physical Pokemon, especially if they pivot out with U-turn, but this makes Heatran more vulnerable to Fire-types like Ho-Oh and Victini.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Unless Heatran has its Air Balloon intact, Ground-type moves will heavily damage if not OHKO it. Offensive Groudon and Excadrill can outspeed and OHKO the specially defensive variant, while Landorus-T and Zygarde-10% can take a hit and OHKO in return, with the latter also ignoring Air Balloon. However, none of these Pokemon can switch in safely. Earthquake from Ho-Oh and Tangrowth deters Heatran from switching in directly and trapping them.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Offensive Water-types like Kyogre and Urshifu-R threaten to OHKO Heatran with their powerful STAB attacks, and the latter also ignores Protect thanks to Unseen Fist. Defensive Water-type Pokemon like Gastrodon and Slowbro can muscle past or force mind game against Heatran. All of them still has to watch out for Toxic on the switch in though.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Since Heatran usually needs a pivot from teammate to safely get in, offensive pressure prevents its partners like Landorus-T Rillaboom from safely using U-turn. Examples of Pokemon that can force these Pokemon out or pivot against them include Tornadus-T and Yveltal.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its great typing and stats, Heatran is a good special tank that can check many Pokemon such as Volcarona and Kyurem-W without Earth Power. Magma Storm is a powerful Fire-type STAB move that also traps and deals chip damage, allowing Heatran to eliminate passive Pokemon like Clefable and Pyukumuku in conjunction with Taunt. Lava Plume is an option with better accuracy and PP that threatens a burn on potential switch-ins such as Rayquaza and Garchomp. Stealth Rock lets it support its teammates, and Heatran's ability to threaten common entry hazard removers allows it to keep it on the field frequently. Toxic cripples common switch-ins such as Gastrodon and Slowking and deals a lot of passive damage when stacked with Magma Storm. Earth Power is used to hit opposing Heatran, which otherwise wall it, as well as lessens the need to use Magma Storm's low PP against foes like Tapu Koko and Victini. Protect helps Heatran rack up passive damage as well as gain extra Leftovers recovery. It also scouts common Choice item Pokemon, like Zygarde-10% and Kyogre. Taunt is an option to prevent recovery moves and Teleport from defensive Pokemon, notably Clefable. Leftovers is the preferred item to give Heatran recovery, but Air Balloon is an aggressive option that lets it counter opposing Heatran, and also Dhelmise after it pops. If it is not in the Speed slot, 120 Speed EVs lets Heatran outspeed uninvested base 90 Pokemon, which are common thanks to powerful gods like Kyogre and Ho-Oh, in addition to Bold and Modest Magnezone. If Heatran does receive Speed, it can invest more fully in Special Defense.</p> <p>Specially Defensive Heatran thrives on bulky offense teams where it gets many opportunities to switch in. Many physically offensive Pokemon enjoy Stealth Rock to wear down their checks and counters, especially those with Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots like Weavile and Kartana. Moreover, Heatran threatens physical walls that they can't break though such as Skarmory and Ho-Oh. Special attackers like Kyurem-W and Tapu Koko can struggle against specially defensive cores, and Heatran can help soften these walls for them. Offensive and defensive pivots complement Stealth Rock well by racking up damage and give Heatran more opportunities to switch in. Examples of pivots include offensive Pokemon like Zeraora and Rillaboom and defensive Pokemon like Slowking and Corviknight. Rillaboom notably synergizes well with Heatran thanks to Grassy Terrain providing extra recovery and halving Earthquake damage. Heatran is unable to deal with some special wallbreakers, namely Kyogre and Volcanion, so Gastrodon can cover for Heatran well. Physical Ground- and Fighting-types dent Heatran, which Buzzwole, Tangrowth, and Landorus-T handle well.</p>"

Magma Storm is its main Fire-type STAB attack that deals residual damage in addition to its high Base Power, allowing it to beat even Pokemon that resist it such as Giratina and Ho-Oh without Earthquake. Earth Power destroys opposing Heatran, which otherwise walls it completely. Toxic further increases its passive damage, helping against said foes and reducing the need to constantly waste Magma Storm's low PP. Taunt prevents the defensive Pokemon from using their recovery moves, pivoting out with Teleport, or phazing Heatran out with Roar and Whirlwind. Leftovers's passive recovery allows Heatran to more comfortably take on the defensive Pokemon. If opposing Heatran is a concern, Air Balloon lets Heatran wall it, as well as Ho-Oh opting for Earthquake over Brave Bird.</p> <p>Offensive Heatran finds its home on balance and bulky offense teams as a way to make progress against bulkier builds. Heatran usually doesn't like switching in directly, so pivots like Slowbro and Landorus-T enable it to safely get a favorable matchup. Late game cleaners like Choice Scarf Kartana and Tapu Lele appreciate having opposing walls removed or weakened. Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Kyogre and Excadrill threaten an OHKO on Heatran, which Grass-types like Tangrowth and Ferrothorn can handle. Rillaboom threatens fast offensive Pokemon, as well as provides Grassy Terrain to give Heatran additional recovery and weaken Earthquake damage. Fighting-type coverage from the likes of Zeraora and Kartana can be dealt with by partners like Clefable.</p>"

Dragon Tail combines both Hex and Roar into one attacking slot, preventing it from being Taunt-bait and still phazing out setup sweepers, but its miss chance can be quite detrimental and still loses out on Substitute + Dragon Dance Kyurem-B and Calm Mind Clefable. Rocky Helmet can be used to spread more chip damage by further punishing physical attackers like Urshifu-R, Victini, and Necrozma-DM, but Leftovers recovery is generally preferred to remedy reliance on Rest.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Giratina usually relies solely on its status moves to make progress, so Taunt from Pokemon like Zeraora, Tapu Fini, Heatran, and Tornadus-T can shut it down easily. Notably, Heatran is also immune to both Giratina's status moves.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-Types</strong>: Choice Specs Tapu Lele can OHKO Giratina with Moonblast while Calm Mind Clefable can use Giratina as setup fodder thanks to Magic Guard. Aside from threatening it with their super effective STAB attacks as well, Tapu Fini and Tapu Koko can summon their respective terrains to stop Giratina from using Rest, with Misty Terrain also preventing Tapu Fini and its grounded teammates from getting crippled by Giratina's status moves.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Yveltal, Galarian Moltres, Weavile, and Choice Band Alolan Persian can dent Giratina with their Dark-type attacks. Knock Off can cut into its longevity by removing Leftovers, making even defensive Pokemon like Tangrowth and Ferrothorn annoying to face while Kartana, Zeraora, and Rillaboom can damage it significantly as well. However, none of them likes switching into the corresponding status move.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: If Giratina is not running Roar, Substitute + Dragon Dance Kyurem-B and Calm Mind Reuniclus can set up on it freely and threaten it out with their boosted attacks. Moreover, the former can bypass Unaware users that Giratina is usually paired with due to Teravolt while the latter can keep itself healthy with Recover and Magic Guard. However, if Reuniclus hasn't accumulated enough Calm Mind boosts, status-boosted Hex can overwhelm it easily.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Nasty Plot Mewtwo, Choice Specs Kyurem-W, and Choice Band Rayquaza can significantly damage and overwhelm Giratina with their strong attacks. However, Rayquaza has to risk getting PP stalled.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: As it solely relies on Leftovers and the unreliable Rest for recovery, Giratina can get chipped down quickly by entry hazards.

It can even drain low PP attacks like Sunsteel Strike, Behemoth Bash, Sacred Fire, and V-create easily with Pressure. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers like Groudon, Garchomp, and Rillaboom and Steel-types like Necrozma-DM, Zamazenta-C, and Kartana that attempt to boost past Giratina. Rest and Leftovers give it much needed recovery; Rest also removes any status that tries to whittle it down and, in some situations, lets it come out on top against the foe by easily PP stalling them with Pressure. Toxic puts every non-immune foe like Galarian Moltres, Tapu Koko, and Volcarona on a timer and lets it beat opposing defensive Pokemon like Tangrowth and Rotom-W, while Roar prevents setup sweepers like ChestoResto Galarian Moltres, Calm Mind Clefable and Reuniclus, and Substitute users like Kyurem-B from taking advantage of Giratina's passivity to freely set up. In the last moveslot, Hex prevents it from being Taunt-bait and synergizes well with either of its status moves to highly damage the likes of Necrozma-DM and Mewtwo, while Defog allows Giratina to compress roles by providing the team with entry hazard removal; however, Giratina's reliance on Rest for recovery and poor matchup against entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Clefable mean it should only be run alongside another Defogger. Running no item is an option to let Giratina take on Knock Off and Poltergeist users like Kartana, Rillaboom, and Dhelmise more reliably. A physically defensive spread is preferred to check threats like Necrozma-DM, Zamazenta-C, and Victini better, as most special attackers in the metagame such as Yveltal, Galarian Moltres, and Tapu Lele still threaten it heavily regardless of its investment.</p> <p>Due to its immensely valuable defensive profile and very passive nature, Giratina is solely relegated to full stall teams. Lots of defensive Pokemon appreciates the stat donation that Giratina can provide: Skarmory and Pyukumuku love the HP donation, Clefable and Quagsire appreciate the Defense donation, and Gastrodon and Corviknight enjoy the Special Defense donation. Its deceivingly solid Speed stat can even be donated to slow Pokemon with already acceptable defenses like Tyranitar and Galarian Slowking. Setup wallbreakers such as Nasty Plot Mewtwo and Swords Dance Rayquaza and Weavile can easily break through Giratina; thus, teammates like Ditto, Unaware Clefable, and Haze Quagsire can help dissuade or completely ignore their boosts. Skarmory, Buzzwole, and specially defensive Tyranitar make great partners, as they can check Dark-type foes like Weavile, Choice Band Alolan Persian, and Yveltal, respectively. They also deal with threatening Ghost-types, with Skarmory and Buzzwole dealing with Dhelmise and Tyranitar with Blacepalon. Skarmory, Buzzwole, and Clefable can absorb Knock Off from foes like Kartana, Zeraora, and Tangrowth, respectively, which would significantly cut into Giratina's longevity if it's running Leftovers. Corviknight and Clear Smog Gastrodon can deal with Fairy-types like Choice Specs Tapu Lele and Calm Mind Clefable that either OHKO or set up on Giratina. Giratina gets extremely overwhelmed by entry hazards, especially in longer games, so it appreciates being paired with Defoggers like Corviknight, Tornadus-T, and Skarmory that can reliably remove them.</p>"

V-create is a very strong STAB move that deals massive damage to all neutral targets. Zen Headbutt is a nice secondary STAB move that hits foes that resist Fire like Volcanion and has good neutral coverage with V-create, and also does not reduce Victini's stats. U-turn allows Victini to keep up momentum after scoring a KO or on a predicted switch to a check like physically defensive Landorus-T. Bolt Strike is a great coverage move to hit Pokemon that resist V-create such as Slowking and Ho-Oh. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Victini to switch in more easily without worry about Stealth Rock and have the freedom to switch moves, but Choice Band deals incredible damage. Speed receivers should run Jolly to make the most of their new Speed stat, and Attack Adamant or Jolly.</p> <p>Victini loves to receive donations from gods with high Attack stats like Necrozma-DM, Rayquaza, and Groudon.

Many setup sweepers appreciate Victini's ability to bring them in with U-turn, such as Rayquaza and Bulk Up Zeraora. Necrozma-DM and Victini synergize well, with Victini checking bulky Steel-types and making great use of Necrozma-DM's Attack stat, and Necrozma-DM switching into defensive Knock Off users that threaten Victini, activating its Weakness Policy and threatening to sweep. Victini is prone to being outsped after using V-create, so Landorus-T, which is immune to Earthquake from Garchomp and walls Zeraora, is a good teammate to handle faster threats. Victini is crippled by Knock Off, so bulky Pokemon that can switch into it like Buzzwole are appreciated. Choice Band sets require excellent entry hazard removal, so reliable Defog users such as Corviknight, Skarmory, Ho-Oh, and Tornadus-T are a necessity.

Earthquake is its main attack, OHKOing numerous offensive Pokemon such as Zeraora and Heatran. Rock Slide hits Pokemon that are immune to Ground, notably Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Swords Dance further boosts Excadrill's Attack, allowing it to break through sturdy physical walls such as Magic Guard Clefable and Ferrothorn. Iron Head is its secondary STAB option that hits some Pokemon like Kyurem and Landorus-T harder, and its flinch chance can be useful to take down foes Excadrill struggles with otherwise, like Landorus-T, Unaware Clefable, and Tangrowth. Rapid Spin instead gives it some utility by removing entry hazards while also giving it the potential to sweep outside of sand. Leftovers is the preferred item to increase Excadrill's longevity and utilize its great defensive typing; however, Life Orb can be used to increase its damage output at the cost of being more prone to getting worn down. Sand Rush lets Excadrill outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, even fast Choice Scarf users like Kartana. An Adamant nature maximizes its damage output, but Jolly is an option to outspeed Pheromosa and its Speed receiver outside of sand at +1 Speed.</p> <p>Excadrill's already great Attack and decent Speed make it flexible with what slot it can fit into. A sand setter is mandatory for Excadrill; Tyranitar is preferred, as it can act as a reliable switch-in to dangerous Pokemon like Yveltal, Kyurem-W, and Galarian Moltres once sand runs out, and it also provides Stealth Rock to chip Excadrill's checks and counters and can lure Landorus-T and KO it with Ice Beam. Dracozolt is another sand staple that can break physical walls that trouble Excadrill, especially Skarmory, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn. Together, they wear down Landorus-T for the other to break through. Magnezone can trap and eliminate these two Pokemon, which makes it a great teammate, although it does not provide much defensive utility. Sand cores are very susceptible to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, so the rest of the team should focus on shoring up these weaknesses. Ho-Oh is immune to Ground, checks Tangrowth, and also provides great Attack for Dracozolt, Defense or Special Defense for Excadrill, and Speed for Tyranitar. Similarly, Rotom-W can handle Ground-type Pokemon and check other weather setters that would otherwise be problematic. Tangrowth and Buzzwole deal with Zygarde-10%, which can bypass Ho-Oh and Rotom-W's Ground immunities with Thousand Arrows.

Earthquake is its primary STAB attack, hitting Alolan Raichu and Tapu Koko hard and can also discourage specially offensive Fire-types like Heatran and Volcanion from switching in. Rapid Spin removes entry hazards, and Excadrill's natural resistance to them means it can often switch in multiple times even without recovery. Toxic cripples switchins such as Tangrowth and Landorus-T. Stealth Rock complements Excadrill's ability to support its teammates and compress roles. Alternatively, if another teammate already has Stealth Rock, Excadrill can opt for Iron Head to better deal with Kyurem-W and Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Lele. Leftovers is Excadrill's only form of recovery, but Heavy-Duty Boots is also an option on more offensive teams if Spikes is a particular concern. Mold Breaker helps Excadrill threaten Rotom formes with Earthquake by bypassing Levitate and also eases prediction for Stealth Rock and Toxic by going through Magic Bounce. 32 Speed EVs allow it to outpace Modest Magnezone and Victini after V-Create.</p> <p>Specially defensive Excadrill fits best on offense teams as a utility Pokemon that serves as a Tapu Koko counter. It benefits from any Special Defense boost; however, gods with high Special Defense like Ho-Oh and Zamazenta ease its ability to take hits. Since Excadrill takes the Special Defense slot while still being weak to prominent special threats such as Volcanion, Slowking and Kyurem-W are helpful to shore up this weakness. Offensive threats enjoy Excadrill's ability to clear entry hazards and potentially land a Toxic on Landorus-T while still keeping entry hazards on the foe's side for them to more easily wallbreak. This is especially beneficial to those that tend to switch out repeatedly throughout a game like Victini and Rayquaza. Conversely, they threaten Skarmory, Ho-Oh, and Corviknight, which Excadrill struggles to take on.

Colbur Berry is an option to lure and swiftly remove the aforementioned Dark-types with Focus Blast; after the item is consumed, Reuniclus easily takes on Knock Off from foes like defensive Yveltal and Necrozma-DM and becomes immune to Poltergeist from Dhelmise.

Even with a Defense donation, Reuniclus can still be overwhelmed by strong physical wallbreakers like Zygarde-10%, Pheromosa, and Rayquaza; teammates like Tangrowth, Clefable, and Skarmory are good choices to cover them. Entry hazard support from Ferrothorn and Skarmory significantly chips foes like Necrozma-DM, Gastrodon, and Victini, either forcing them to use their recovery move PP in longer games or putting them into KO range of Reuniclus. Steel-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Zamazenta-C appreciate Reuniclus switching into Fighting-type attacks from opposing Zamazenta-C and Choice-locked Pheromosa, Urshifu-R, and Buzzwole. The likes of Rotom-W and Heatran can run Toxic to lure in and permanently cripple Gastrodon and Unaware Quagsire, which can stop Reuniclus from setting up with their Clear Smog and Haze, respectively.</p>"

Stealth Rock can still be run when Ferrothorn is the team's only entry hazard setter; however, in general Spikes is more valuable due to its limited access. Leech Seed is its main recovery option and weakens foes. Power Whip nails Water-types Ferrothorn is supposed to switch in on, like Tapu Fini and Gastrodon. Ferrothorn's last moveslot is flexible: Knock Off is a great option to threaten Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Victini, Thunder Wave supports its slower teammates while also dissuading setup, and Gyro Ball heavily damages fast offensive switch-ins like Mewtwo and Galarian Moltres. Ferrothorn can also use Protect to get extra recovery from Leftovers and Leech Seed, or Toxic to debilitate switch-ins like Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Volcarona. Leftovers is used to give Ferrothorn more longevity, especially since it lacks a reliable recovery move.

Most gods synergize well with Ferrothorn and substantially raise its HP, although Ho-Oh deserves a special mention. Ferrothorn deals with foes such as Nihilego and Tapu Koko for Ho-Oh, while Ho-Oh deals with Fighting- and Fire-types such as Volcarona, Heatran, and Pheromosa for Ferrothorn. Most wallbreakers in the tier appreciate Spikes, notably Weavile, Tapu Koko, and Zygarde-10%. Landorus-T and Clefable also make solid partners as both tank Fighting-type attacks and use Stealth Rock, allowing Ferrothorn to freely run Spikes. Clefable also doesn't mind taking Knock Off, which cuts into Ferrothorn's longevity.

It still switches into foes that specially defensive Ferrothorn can handle such as Tapu Koko, but less reliably. Its main appeal is using Spikes to chip down its teammates's checks. Stealth Rock is an option for Spikes-immune foes like Skarmory, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W, but only if no other teammate can fit it. Leech Seed chips down the foe and provides a way of recovery.

Knock Off can be used to bother the likes of Celesteela, Yveltal, Zapdos, and Rotom-H, making the latter three very susceptible to Stealth Rock. Iron Defense increases its already great physical bulk and also the damage output of Body Press, preventing dangerous Pokemon with setup, notably Necrozma-DM, from muscling through. Thunder Wave debilitates offensive switch-ins like Buzzwole, Kartana, and Galarian Moltres. Gyro Ball can also be used to heavily damage fast foes like Kyurem-W and Pheromosa. Protect can give Ferrothorn a free turn to recover some HP using Leech Seed and Leftovers and scout for Choice item users. Toxic damages switch-ins like Volcarona and Yveltal. Ferrothorn prefers Leftovers as its item due to lacking any sort of reliable recovery, but Rocky Helmet can be used to focus on punishing physical attackers in shorter games.

Slowbro is also a great teammate to take a lot of Fire- and Fighting-type attacks while keeping momentum with Future Sight and Teleport. Similarly, Landorus-T not only covers Fighting-types and can pivot, but also allows Ferrothorn to freely run Spikes with its Stealth Rock. Teammates with Defiant, most notably Galarian Zapdos, also like Spikes because they heavily punish Defog attempts. As Ferrothorn doesn't like losing its Leftovers, having a teammate that doesn't mind taking Knock Off like Tapu Koko or Clefable is a good idea.</p>"

Flamethrower is a consistent STAB move that lets it deal with common Steel- and Grass-types, notably Tangrowth and Skarmory, as Fire Blast's low PP and accuracy is not worth the extra power.

Nasty Plot further boosts its offensive capabilities and helps it break bulky special walls such as Reuniclus and Slowking. Focus Blast nails Steel- and Rock-types that can easily take Hurricane like Heatran, Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Tyranitar. Heat Wave gives it a more reliable attack that still deals with most Steel-type Pokemon, notably Necrozma-DM, but misses out on Heatran and Tyranitar. Knock Off helps Tornadus-T remove key items from foes, especially Assault Vest and Heavy-Duty Boots, to wear down its checks and counters like Clear Smog Gastrodon and Ho-Oh, which can also help other teammates break them. U-turn instead keeps offensive momentum and is better against walls without Regenerator like Rotom-W and Heatran when combined with entry hazards.

        "description": "<p>Kyurem-B is a solid god on offensive teams thanks to it donating all-around solid stats, notably an amazing base 170 Attack stat. Dragon Dance makes Kyurem-B a terrifying sweeper, outpacing most of the metagame at +1 Speed and raising its Attack even higher. Thanks to Teravolt, it can even break past Unaware Quagsire and Clefable. Icicle Spear is its best STAB move, doing super effective damage to common defensive Pokemon like Landorus-T, Tangrowth, and Giratina. Fusion Bolt has fantastic synergy with Icicle Spear, notably hitting Water-types like Slowking and Tapu Fini that would otherwise wall Kyurem-B. Roost lets it stay healthy throughout longer games and use its impressive bulk to set up multiple times. Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred item to avoid Stealth Rock chipping Kyurem-B down upon entering the field; however, other items like Life Orb and Lum Berry can also be used, the latter to set up on status-inducing foes. Jolly is the preferred nature to outspeed Pheromosa at +1. Adamant allows Kyurem-B to get more KOs, such as the OHKO against Landorus-T and 2HKO against Slowbro. These KO's can also be achieved by running a Jolly nature with Life Orb.</p> <p>Kyurem-B shines on offensive teams thanks to its good offensive donations. Mimikyu, Rillaboom, Victini, and Zygarde-10% become amazing wallbreakers with Kyurem-B's Attack donation, punching holes in opposing physical walls for Kyurem-B to sweep. Moderately strong special attackers like Tapu Fini, Tapu Koko, and Galarian Moltres make good use of its solid Special Attack; the former weakens Dragon-type moves and blocks status for Kyurem-B with Misty Terrain, while the latter two pressure Buzzwole and Necrozma-DM. It can also pass a decent HP stat onto bulky pivots like Rotom-W and Landorus-T, which fit onto the more offensive teams of Kyurem-B while dealing with its answers such as Necrozma-DM and Sand Rush Excadrill. Many teammates can take advantage of Kyurem-B's less-used stats to fill utility roles. For example, Heatran, Excadrill, and Clefable provide crucial Stealth Rock support. Before setup, Kyurem-B is vulnerable to faster Pokemon such as Zeraora and Zygarde-10%, which Tangrowth and Buzzwole can deal with. Faster Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Yveltal can force out Kyurem-B even at +1, so teammates that can switch into their attacks like Kartana, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Koko also make for good teammates. Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, Kartana, and the aforementioned Tapu Fini provide a crucial answer to fast Pokemon like Zamazenta, Pheromosa, and their Speed receivers, preventing them from outrunning common Kyurem-B team structures. Should Kyurem-B opt for another item, a Defogger like Tornadus-T or Volcanion is also appreciated. Dual screens support from Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl will also help it set up, but this really only fits on hyper offense teams.</p>"

Knock Off and Close Combat are the STAB moves of choice, dealing significant damage to common physical walls such as Skarmory, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W. Gunk Shot hits Fairy-types that resist Pangoro's STAB combination such as Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Tapu Koko and OHKOes them at +2.

Due to Pangoro's susceptibility to strong priority from Rayquaza, Zygarde-10%, and Weavile, Tapu Lele pairs well with it due to Psychic Surge.

Pangoro is weak to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users such as Blacephalon and Kartana, so defensive Landorus-T and Rotom-Wash pair well in that role on less offensive teams. Pangoro is good at wearing down common Unaware and physically defensive walls that normally stop hyper offense teams, so pairing it with other sweepers such as Scolipede, Kartana, and Shell Smash Cloyster maximizes its effectiveness.</p>"

Yveltal hits an overwhelming majority of the tier for at least neutral damage, chunking common walls like Rotom-W, Heatran, and Corviknight. Dark Pulse is one of the strongest Dark-type moves in the tier thanks to Dark Aura, and Oblivion Wing also provides much-welcome recovery to offset Life Orb recoil. Taunt lets Yvetal easily make progress against more defensive teams, shutting down Pokemon that rely on their status moves like Pyukumuku and Giratina, as well as denying the likes of Gastrodon, Vaporeon, and Corviknight recovery so that it can comfortably beat them. Roost can be used to provide reliable recovery. Heat Wave enables Yveltal to beat common Steel-types which can withstand its STAB moves, like Ferrothorn, Klefki, and Bisharp, and is its best option against Tapu Koko. Sucker Punch can also be used to give Yveltal the ability to revenge kill faster threats, like Dracozolt, Venusaur under weather, and Kartana. Sucker Punch should be run with a Mild nature.

Fire Blast hits Steel-type entry hazard setters like Skarmory and Necrozma-DM hard, as well as common Grass-types, namely Tangrowth and Rillaboom. Defog takes advantage of forced switches to clear entry hazards, and only a select few entry hazard setters, namely Seismitoad, can safely force Volcanion out.

Surf is used for consistency and conserving PP, trading power for accuracy. Ice Beam is an alternative that hits a few sturdy walls, notably Giratina, for significant damage. Since Araquanid usually only needs Hydro Pump, Choice Specs is the preferred item to maximize its damage output; resisted Hydro Pump is still stronger than neutral Bug Buzz and almost as strong as super effective Ice Beam. Minimum Speed is run to make Araquanid outspeed as many Pokemon as possible under Trick Room.</p> <p>Necrozma-DW is the best god to complement Araquanid, as it has access to Trick Room and sports impressive Special Attack stat; it also appreciates Araquanid's ability to beat or soften opposing special walls to clean up late-game. Other Trick Room users are also required for Araquanid to function. Slowking and Porygon2, in particular, also learn Teleport, allowing Araquanid to get in without having to take damage, and they are also bulky enough to take on revenge killers when Trick Room runs out. Hatterene supports Araquanid by providing Healing Wish support and also prevents opposing entry hazards with Magic Bounce. Even though Araquanid can 2HKO Ferrothorn and Tangrowth, they can annoy it with Knock Off or switch in to scout its attack, respectively; as such, teammates that take care of them such as Victini and Buzzwole are recommended.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Physical Araquanid is a threatening wallbreaker, especially under Trick Room, capable of punching holes through sturdy defensive stalwarts like Skarmory and Clefable thanks to an Attack donation. Liquidation is its strongest attack thanks to Water Bubble, which notably hits neutral targets even harder than super effective coverage moves, reducing the need to predict. Leech Life is Araquanid's best option against Tangrowth, Slowking, and Pokemon immune to Water such as Gastrodon and Seismitoad. Crunch provides super effective damage against Giratina, which could otherwise stall Liquidation's PP. In its last moveslot, it can either go with Poison Jab, which also possesses a high poison chance, to deal more damage to Tapu Fini and Volcanion, or Toxic to cripple Vaporeon, which completely walls it. Choice Band is the preferred item to maximize its damage output, as it usually only needs to use Liquidation. While usually used in Trick Room teams, Araquanid can still be used without a dedicated team, as its defensive utility and Water Bubble's ability to prevent burn and halving Fire-type damage provide it a lot of opportunities to switch in against foes, namely Heatran and Clefable. In those cases, Araquanid should run Sticky Web over Crunch and opt for Heavy-Duty Boots to negate entry hazards. Minimal Speed is run if Araquanid is used in Trick Room teams; otherwise, it should run 31 Speed IVs, 148 Speed EVs, and Adamant nature to outpace uninvested Clefable.</p> <p>Araquanid best fits in Trick Room teams where it can take advantage of its low Speed. Calyrex-I and Necrozma-DM are mandatory partners to maximize Araquanid's damage output, and they can also set Trick Room. In return, Araquanid can wear down physical walls, in particular Skarmory and opposing Necrozma-DM, for them. Other bulky Trick Room setters, especially Porygon2 and Slowking, are also needed to take hits after Trick Room has ended; they also have Teleport, allowing Araquanid to come in without having to take damage. Hatterene has Magic Bounce, preventing entry hazards from limiting Araquanid's opportunities to switch in. Other offensive Trick Room attackers that can deal with Ferrothorn and physically bulky Pokemon immune to Water are needed, making Conkeldurr and Speed-received Kartana and Blacephalon great teammates. If Araquanid finds itself on teams without Trick Room, then it can take the leftover Attack slot from gods like Kyurem-W and Giratina-O. Entry hazard deterrents, including Ghost-types to spinblock such as Blacephalon and Defiant users in Bisharp and Galarian Zapdos, are recommended to prevent Sticky Web from being easily cleared.</p>"

Lum Berry allows Mimikyu to set up against defensive Pokemon like Rotom-W, Giratina, and Lunala without being permanently crippled. Red Card gives it further insurance against opposing setup sweepers like Galarian Moltres, Tyranitar, and Espeon, which works exceptionally well with Disguise. However, losing out on a damage-boosting item is undesirable, especially with the low Base Power of its attacks. Taunt can be used to shut down its defensive checks in Skarmory and Clefable, but Mimikyu usually can't afford to drop any of its attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Skarmory, Quagsire, Clefable, and Vaporeon possess huge physical bulk to take on Mimikyu's boosted attacks and threaten to break its Disguise or worse, cripple it with a debilitating status, which significantly hampers its wallbreaking duties. Quagsire and Clefable, in particular, can ignore Mimikyu's Swords Dance boosts with Unaware.</p> <p><strong>Bypassing Disguise</strong>: Necrozma-DM, Excadrill, Choice Scarf Kyurem-W, and Pangoro can ignore Mimikyu's Disguise with either their attack or abilities, which let them revenge kill or prevent it from setting up in the first place. Multi-hit attacks such as Weavile's Triple Axel, Alolan Persian's Beat Up, Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes, and Cloyster's Icicle Spear can expend Disguise on the initial hit to possibly KO it. However, none of them can safely switch into Mimikyu.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: If Mimikyu's Disguise is broken, faster threats like Yveltal, Zamazenta-C, Garchomp, and Speed-donated Tyranitar can comfortably stomach a boosted Shadow Sneak and KO it back.

Shadow Claw hits Fairy-resistant Pokemon like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill, as as well as foes like Necrozma-DM, Galarian Slowking, and Slowbro super effectively. Aside from compensating for Life Orb recoil, Drain Punch is an alternative to either STAB move to dent the aforementioned Steel-types bar Necrozma-DM even harder. Shadow Sneak potentially turns Mimikyu into a late-game cleaner and can also be used to revenge kill faster threats like Mewtwo, Pheromosa, Blacephalon, and Victini after Disguise is broken. Life Orb grants the highest damage output and, after a Swords Dance boost, guarantees the OHKO on Dhelmise and Calyrex-I with Shadow Sneak and Shadow Claw, respectively. Disguise is its biggest selling point: it grants Mimikyu either a free turn to set up, especially against hard-hitters like Rayquaza, Mewtwo, Kartana, and Zygarde-10%, or an insurance to reliably revenge kill them, preventing its team from being overwhelmed by opposing offensive Pokemon. A Jolly nature is preferred to let Mimikyu outspeed threatening foes like Kyurem-B, Rayquaza, Zekrom, and Tapu Lele.</p> <p>Mimikyu's offensive prowess lets it fit nicely on offense and hyper offense teams.

Other wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Pangoro and Kartana can keep exerting offensive pressure against opposing team and overwhelm physical walls alongside Mimikyu; notably, they can cripple common defensive walls with Knock Off and threaten Unaware Quagsire and Clefable, with Kartana taking care of other physically bulky Water-types like Rotom-W and Vaporeon as well, which threaten to burn Mimikyu. Volcarona is a potent setup sweeper that can pressure Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Skarmory for Mimikyu, and, in return, Mimikyu threatens Dragon-types like Giratina, Garchomp, and Rayquaza for Volcarona to sweep easier. Dedicated leads like Shuckle and Excadrill can reliably set up Stealth Rock to chip down foes into Mimikyu's KO range, with the former also providing Sticky Web to let it outspeed faster foes like Alolan Persian and Garchomp; in return, Mimikyu can spinblock Pheromosa and Regieleki.

Switcheroo is useful for crippling passive walls that avoid being 2HKOed like HP Skarmory and Defense Clefable; it also helps against the rare itemless Giratina, which otherwise walls Dhelmise.

Additionally, Dhelmise can struggle to break through Skarmory, Clefable, and Buzzwole due to their titanic bulk, so powerful Attack receivers like Zygarde-10%, Victini, and Zeraora make fantastic partners, as they can beat or at least cripple all of them with status. It is critically important to remember that Dhelmise has terrible synergy with Knock Off, as it renders the foe immune to Poltergeist; be very careful to not pair Dhelmise with teammates that rely on Knock Off to make progress like Tangrowth and Landorus-T. Dhelmise is easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf users, so bulky teammates like Skarmory and Tangrowth are recommended. Since Dhelmise has no form of recovery and often likes to switch in multiple times, reliable entry hazard control like Corviknight or Rotom-W is recommended.</p>"

It's also prone to getting revenge killed by the likes of Pangoro and Kartana.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark- and Ghost-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Even with Shadow Shield up, Lunala is still preyed on by Yveltal, Dhelmise, and Alolan Persian. However, they all struggle to switch in safely against Lunala's attacks and status moves. Tyranitar shrugs off its attacks, deals heavy damage back, and can even use Rest to cure its status. Knock Off is extremely common on defensive and offensive Pokemon alike and also makes Lunala vulnerable to entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Lunala's ability to handle wallbreakers is severely limited without Shadow Shield. Alolan Ninetales and Tyranitar can set hail and sand to negate it, respectively, while most walls can inflict poison or burn. Many offensive threats can also pivot with U-turn or Volt Switch, punishing Lunala as it switches in without losing momentum.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Gastrodon, Tangrowth, and Ho-Oh have little to fear from Lunala outside of Toxic, although Ho-Oh has to watch out for the rare Meteor Beam. They can effectively force Lunala out with their own status.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit Moves</strong>: While not common, multi-hit moves only suffer the damage penalty from Shadow Shield on the first hit. Shell Smash Cloyster and Choice Band Urshifu-R have the power to break through Lunala, although the latter risks a Speed tie. Scale Shot users like Rayquaza also have a chance to 2HKO Lunala, but they are inconsistent.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Lunala sports good bulk, a great ability, and a neutrality to most attacks, letting it blanket check numerous threats such as Rayquaza and Kyurem-W. Roost helps keep Shadow Shield intact, with Lunala's Speed meaning it can often go before these wallbreakers should they stay in. Depending on team choices, Lunala can either opt for Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave. The former immediately deters dangerous physical attackers such as Necrozma-DM and Kyurem-B, while the latter facilitates slower teammates like Obstagoon, Urshifu-R, and its Speed receivers. Hex's higher PP and synergy with Lunala's status spreading are usually preferred over Moongeist Beam's initial power. Ice Beam OHKOes Rayquaza and Landorus-T, while Toxic annoys Gastrodon, Tangrowth, and specially defensive Tyranitar, which don't mind its other options. Defog is another alternative for role compression. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures entry hazards don't break Shadow Shield.</p> <p>With well-rounded stats, Lunala lends itself to bulky offense and balance teams. Common defensive Pokemon in Rotom-W, Tangrowth, Clefable, and Landorus-T all benefit from Lunala's defensive stat donations, and they bolster Lunala's Hex with their status moves. Tapu Koko, Tapu Fini, Celesteela, and Galarian Moltres make great use of its impressive Special Attack; its Speed donation, while not stellar, is enough to outpace Rayquaza and Kyurem-W, thus allowing slower teammates like Galarian Slowking and Dhelmise to pressure foes more easily. Dark-type teammates are necessary to cover for Lunala's weaknesses. Galarian Moltres and Bisharp check Dhelmise and benefit from Lunala spreading paralysis to make up for their middling Speed; defensive ones such as Mandibuzz and Alolan Persian also provide pivoting to make up for Lunala's predictability and momentum drain. Skarmory and Ferrothorn cover faster physical threats that can 2HKO it through Shadow Shield like Urshifu-R and Weavile. Lunala's middling Speed can be problematic against fast teams, making Choice Scarf Urshifu-R and Kartana great partners. Since Lunala can be overwhelmed due to its reliance on Roost and fear of chip damage, Clefable, Gastrodon, and Corviknight alleviate some pressure by dealing with foes such as Tyranitar, Zeraora, and Kartana. They can also absorb Knock Off and status effects that Lunala wants to avoid.</p>"

This helps Nihilego sweep offensive teams where it can get away with relying solely on Meteor Beam's Special Attack boost, but severely impacts its sweeping and wallbreaking ability against every other team style. A bulky utility set with Power Gem, Sludge Bomb, Stealth Rock, and Knock Off can be used as an entry hazard setter that also checks Tapu Koko; however, it faces heavy competition from Landorus-T and Tyranitar as an entry hazard setter and Rotom-H as a Tapu Koko check, all of which offer similar or better utility. Toxic Spikes is an option to harrass the opponent with poison, but hazard removal options being near-exclusively immune to them limit its effectiveness.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Common Steel-types like Necrozma-DM, Zamazenta-C, and Ferrothorn can completely prevent Nihilego from sweeping whilst also threatening heavy damage back, but the latter two lack reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type moves</strong>: Earthquake and Earth Power remove Nihilego instantly due to its 4x weakness. Faster threats like Zygarde-10%, Scolipede, and Choice Scarf users can exploit this.</p> <p><strong>Excadrill</strong>: Excadrill does not care for Nihilego's attacks, as it commonly receives Special Defense donations and is not very threatened by Grass Knot, so it can use Nihilego as setup fodder or clear the field of entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Without its Power Herb, Nihilego cannot safely use Meteor Beam and thus can struggle to get the initial power needed to successfully sweep.</p>",

A Defense donation allows Nihilego to shed its poor physical bulk, making it difficult to revenge kill even with a lower Defense donation from the likes of Rayquaza or Yveltal. Meteor Beam + Power Herb provides an instant boost to Special Attack, giving Nihilego the strength it needs to kick off a sweep or wallbreak. Power Gem is used to hit common defensive staples like Landorus-T and Ho-Oh for high damage. Stealth Rock allows Nihilego to use its good bulk to support its team while still threatening to sweep. Sludge Bomb is necessary to stop Nihilego from being stone-walled by Unaware Clefable and Assault Vest Tangrowth and potentially offer some mid-game utility by poisoning opponents. Grass Knot hits Ground-type targets, like Groudon, Gastrodon, and Quagsire, which can otherwise stop Nihilego's sweep. Alternatively, Thunderbolt maintains super effective coverage against Water-types and has stronger neutral coverage against Steel-types, such as Bisharp, which would otherwise halt a sweep.</p> <p>Nihilego's best fit is on offense teams which can give it the support it needs to sweep. Magnet Pull Magnezone and Fire-type teammates like Victini and Heatran are appreciated for their ability to pressure Steel-types, which prevent Nihilego from sweeping; Fire- and Fighting-type coverage from teammates like Mewtwo and Kartana can also contribute. Nihilego's defensive typing means it can check threats like Tapu Koko and Galarian Moltres and so it can form a strong defensive backbone with the likes of Clefable and Landorus-T until it can freely sweep. Nihilego also appreciates faster teammates like Tapu Koko and Weavile that can help pick off faster threats, as its base 103 Speed outruns most relevant gods and their receivers but isn't stellar by any means.</p>"

Taunt can shut down many defensive Pokemon but is similarly hard to fit. Offensive sets can opt to run a Life Orb to switch moves, but the loss in power compared to Choice Band, as well as the recoil, make it less than ideal.

Bulk Up allows Buzzwole to set up on passive threats like Body Press Corviknight, while Toxic can debilitate switch-ins like Slowking and opposing Buzzwole. Roost gives Buzzwole more staying power. Finally, Ice Punch hits Pokemon that resist Fighting like Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Zapdos, as does Thunder Punch, which targets Ho-Oh, Slowking, and Slowbro. Rocky Helmet takes advantage of Buzzwole's bulk to continuously chip foes, especially pivots like Landorus-T, but Leftovers is viable too.</p> <p>Buzzwole likes receiving a high Special Defense stat from gods like Ho-Oh and Necrozma-DM. Ho-Oh pairs particularly well with it, as it can switch into Fire-types like Heatran and Victini locked into V-create, as well as providing Defog. Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Rillaboom appreciate Buzzwole's ability to take out Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Kartana. Buzzwole is vulnerable to Flying-types like Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Tornadus-T, so Pokemon that threaten them like Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Weavile are appreciated.

Buzzwole also likes having entry hazard support from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Ferrothorn, as they chip down foes alongside Rocky Helmet and Toxic.

Earthquake allows Buzzwole to take out Heatran and hit other Fire-types like Blacephelon and Victini hard. Leech Life is a decent Bug-type STAB move that restores HP and lets Buzzwole stay healthy throughout the match, as well as 2HKOing potential checks in Slowking and Slowbro. Choice Band is preferred, but Choice Scarf can be used to outspeed opposing Speed receivers, or if receiving Speed from a slower god.</p> <p>Buzzwole demands a high—or at least solid—Speed stat from gods like Zamazenta and Mewtwo; it is important to note that with base 130 Speed or higher, Beast Boost will raise Speed on each KO. For slower gods like Yveltal and Lunala, it will boost Attack, which makes Buzzwole very hard to defend against. When paired with powerful wallbreakers like Tapu Koko, Weavile, and Galarian Moltres, Buzzwole can quickly tear apart defensive cores. Buzzwole can consistently take out Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran, which greatly helps Pokemon like Rillaboom and Tapu Koko. Buzzwole is weak to Flying-types, so Pokemon that can take them out like Tapu Koko and Zeraora, or check them like Heatran and Skarmory, are good to have around. Buzzwole needs to conserve its HP in order to sweep, so pivots like Slowking, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T are good to get it in safely.

U-turn gives Pheromosa an option to bring teammates in safely while also dealing significant chip damage. Triple Axel provides a strong option to hit Ground-types with, notably turning most variants of Landorus-T from a hard wall into a free KO. Close Combat is Pheromosa's primary STAB attack and allows it to wallbreak for its sweeping teammates. Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred item to safely clear entry hazards multiple times if necessary and dodge Sticky Web; Life Orb is an option to maximize its power, but has poor synergy with U-turn and Rapid Spin.</p> <p>Pheromosa's great offensive presence and meager defenses mean it is used almost exclusively on hyper offensive teams. Pheromosa's Speed receivers outspeed all common threats save Regieleki, supercharging powerful offensive threats with setup moves like Pangoro, Tapu Lele, and Galarian Slowking; Tapu Lele is especially notable, as it blocks priority attacks thanks to Psychic Surge. Attack and Special Attack donations are best used on Pokemon that are either fast or can boost their Speed, such as Galarian Moltres, Weavile, and Blaziken. Pheromosa's low defenses mean that donations will negatively impact many receivers, so placing Pheromosa in the Defense slot and using threats with low Special Defense, like Kartana and Cloyster, is common. Placing it in the Special Defense slot and using Pokemon like Nihilego and Polteageist works similarly. HP donations are more flexible, still managing to boost the HP of threats like Skarmory and Rotom-W, and is usually reserved for a dedicated dual screens or entry hazard lead.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Blacephalon is a fearsome late-game cleaner thanks to its high Special Attack and fantastic offensive typing. Blacephalon is also a serious threat to snowball the other team, as (in most cases) Beast Boost will raise its Special Attack after a KO, allowing it to blow through weakened teams. Shadow Ball is its primary attack, hitting most of the metagame at least neutrally. Fire Blast has high Base Power and can dent many Pokemon that can take Shadow Ball such as Tangrowth, Yveltal, and Zamazenta-C. Flamethrower is an alternative, trading raw power for more accuracy and PP. Trick allows Blacephalon to cripple specially defensive foes that it can't do much against otherwise, namely Gastrodon and Tyranitar. On the last moveslot, Knock Off disrupts the foe's item, and is particularly useful against Ho-Oh when Stealth Rock is up. Knock Off also comes in handy to remove Assault Vest from RegenVest Pokemon that might stomach its attacks and switch out with little HP lost otherwise, in particular Tangrowth and Galarian Slowbro. Toxic instead puts foes on a timer and forces them to use their recovery move more often. Overheat is an alternative that helps it revenge kill weakened offensive threats better. Choice Scarf is usually the go-to item to outspeed fast offensive threats like Tapu Koko and Mewtwo. If Blacephalon gets a Speed donation from Zamazenta or Pheromosa, Choice Specs is preferred, as Beast Boost will increase its Speed after a KO.</p> <p>Choice Item Blacephalon acts as a cleaner and revenge killer on offensive builds. A Speed donation from fast gods such as Mewtwo, Zamazenta-C, and Pheromosa helps it outpace fast offensive Pokemon such as Weavile and Kartana; however, a better Defense or HP stat can also help Blacephalon avoid a KO from priority moves such as Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. Groudon can provide sun, which further boosts Blacephalon's Fire attacks. Specially offensive Pokemon like Tapu Koko enjoy Blacephalon's ability to cripple special walls like Gastrodon and Ho-Oh without taking up the Special Attack slot. They can also weaken Blacephalon's checks and counters, allowing it to pick up a KO more easily and snowball. Physical threats such as Kartana and Zamazenta-C struggle against sturdy walls like Buzzwole and Skarmory, which Blacephalon can handle. Entry hazards greatly limit Blacephalon's ability to switch in multiple times, so teammates with entry hazard removal such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W are required. Blacephalon complements entry hazards well by removing Heavy-Duty Boots with Trick or Knock Off, which makes Ferrothorn and Landorus-T great additions. Priority attacks like Yveltal's Sucker Punch and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide force Blacephalon out, so partners that can take them like Tapu Koko and Tornadus-T are appreciated. A counter to Tyranitar like Urshifu-R or Buzzwole is also necessary.</p>"

Shadow Ball is a reliable Ghost STAB attack that hits most Pokemon at least neutrally. Flamethrower is its secondary STAB move, dealing decent damage to Yveltal and Tangrowth. Fire Blast can be used instead, however its lower PP and accuracy are concerns when Blacephalon is often required to use it multiple times. Knock Off removes key items from common switch-ins, in particular Heavy-Duty Boots, Assault Vest, and Leftovers, to make them more vulnerable to chip damage. Toxic cripples Ho-Oh, Gastrodon, and Tyranitar, which otherwise can take Blacephalon's attacks with ease. Taunt prevents Clefable, which doesn't mind Toxic and loss of item, from using Soft-Boiled. Heavy-Duty Boots negates entry hazard damage that would quickly wear Blacephalon down.</p> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots Blacephalon's low defensive utility and capability to wallbreak short term means it should be built around as a secondary wincon. Zamazenta-C gives Blacephalon a much better Speed tier to threaten more offensive Pokemon out and thus opportunities to cripple switch-ins. It can also check two common priority users in Rillaboom and Yveltal. Pokemon who share checks with Blacephalon like Victini and Volcarona benefit from having opposing Ho-Oh and Gastrodon crippled. Bulky offensive threats such as Kyurem-W force it out, which makes it necessary to have a teammate that can handle their attacks like Tangrowth. Entry hazard support from Skarmory and Ferrothorn helps Blacephalon chip down opposing walls, especially with Knock Off to remove their Heavy-Duty Boots.

It also hits most of the other common walls hard, breaking through Pokemon like Clefable and Heatran, as well as threatening to OHKO slower offensive Pokemon like Tapu Lele. Close Combat provides coverage for Pokemon that resist Plasma Fists like Ferrothorn and Excadrill, preventing them from switching in safely. Knock Off is an overall safe move that removes items from Zeraora’s switch-ins to limit their longevity, most notably Landorus-T and Rotom-H, who rely heavily on their items to consistently check it. Volt Switch creates momentum for the team and brings in a threat to Zeraora’s switch-ins.</p> <p>Zeraora fits best on fast-paced offensive teams with setup sweepers to take advantage of weakened defensive cores Zeraora creates. Most gods with high Attack like Rayquaza, Necrozma-DM, and Kyurem-B are great partners to donate Attack to Zeraora, allowing it to provide immediate wallbreaking power and setup opportunities for the gods. Other setup Pokemon like Garchomp and Weavile also appreciate the pressure Zeraora puts on bulky Water-types. Ground-types like Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Landorus-T give Zeraora a hard time creating momentum with Volt Switch and can easily take its coverage moves, so Water-types like Rotom-W and Tapu Fini pair well. Dragon-types like Dialga, Zekrom, and Dracozolt prevent Zeraora from constantly using Plasma Fists, so Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Landorus-T support it well.

Grassy Glide lets Rillaboom threaten out or revenge kill faster offensive threats like Urshifu-R and Tapu Koko. U-turn lets Rillaboom generate momentum and capitalize on the switches it forces, while Swords Dance is run on Life Orb variants to take advantage of the free turns that it can generate versus common defensive Pokemon like Rotom-W and Slowbro. Superpower allows Rillaboom to deal with Heatran and Ferrothorn which would otherwise be very difficult roadblocks, but is not always reliable due to its stat drops. High Horsepower is a weaker alternative with no drawback that still deals with Heatran. Knock Off is a great utility move that also helps with Steel-type checks that are not weak to Fighting, like Skarmory and Necrozma-DM, as well as removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Fire-types such as Ho-Oh and Volcarona, significantly crippling them, while Wood Hammer offers even greater damage against neutral targets like Clefable and Landorus-T.</p> <p>Rillaboom often makes its home on bulky offense teams where it breaks down walls for its teammates and also can have its own checks chipped down.

Volcanion makes a good offensive partner, thanks to Rillaboom's ability to force out Water-types like Gastrodon and Slowking that would annoy Volcanion. In return, Volcanion can handily deal with Steel-types that would give Rillaboom trouble. Speaking of Steel-types, Magnezone can straight up trap and eliminating them, paving the way for Rillaboom to sweep; both Pokemon can form an offensive VoltTurn core as well. Heatran and Tyranitar answer Fire-types that give Rillaboom problems, as well as provide Stealth Rock, which is complemented by Rillaboom's Knock Off to limit Ho-Oh and Volcarona from switching in.

Its dual STAB combination threatens to deal at least neutral damage to most Pokemon, with Close Combat also nailing foes like Zamazenta-C, Kyurem-B, and Ferrothorn, while Surging Strikes takes care of Ho-Oh, Landorus-T, and Victini. Its typing and natural bulk also lets it act as a team's emergency check to prominent threats like Necrozma-DM, Calyrex-I, Weavile, and Volcarona. Aqua Jet is used to pick off faster threats like Pheromosa, Tapu Koko, Sand Rush Excadrill, and a Speed-donated Heatran and Landorus-T, while Ice Punch can be used to OHKO Dragon-types like Rayquaza and Garchomp and is Urshifu-R's strongest attack to hit Giratina. Choice Band turns it into a wallbreaker, notably capable of OHKOing defensive Ho-Oh and 2HKOing Lunala and offensive Necrozma-DM, and is an especially great item with a Speed donation. Choice Scarf allows Urshifu-R to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Kartana, Zeraora, and Mewtwo and revenge kill a boosted Kyurem-B; it most often runs Choice Scarf when taking a dump stat. Protective Pads can be used to keep Urshifu-R healthy, letting it safely fire off attacks or pivot out of foes such as Iron Barbs Ferrothorn, Rough Skin Garchomp, Static Zapdos, and Rocky Helmet users like Tangrowth, Skarmory, and Buzzwole.</p> <p>Urshifu-R fits in on any offensive team archetype, ranging from bulky offense to hyper offense. It appreciates Attack donation from gods like Necrozma-DM and Rayquaza, but also loves the Speed donation from gods like Pheromosa, Mewtwo, and Zamazenta-C. However, Urshifu-R's reliability to perform well regardless of which stat it receives means it can easily be placed into less valuable teamslots like Rayquaza's Special Defense. Weavile is an incredible partner, as they can overwhelm a shared check in Tapu Fini together and it appreciates Urshifu-R's ability to bring it in on Slowking, Slowbro, and Giratina safely with U-turn. Tapu Koko forms a strong VoltTurn core with Urshifu-R, as it can bring the latter in safely on Ground-types like Landorus-T and Groudon, and, in return, Urshifu-R can bring Tapu Koko in on bulky Water-types like Slowking and Tapu Fini. Tapu Koko can also lure in Gastrodon and significantly damage it with Grass Knot, which opens up Urshifu-R to use its Water-type attacks freely. Due to its propensity of getting threatened by faster threats like Tapu Koko, Mewtwo, and Kartana, a solid defensive backbone consisting of teammates like Landorus-T, Heatran, and Tornadus-T, respectively, is needed; moreover, Landorus-T and Tornadus-T provide pivoting with U-turn, while Ferrothorn lays Spikes down to punish the foe's switches that Urshifu-R tend to force.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Glastrier can utilize Icicle Spear over Icicle Crash to have a 100% accurate STAB move while also breaking through Substitutes, but its inconsistent and often lower Base Power makes Icicle Crash the better choice most of the time. Substitute can be used to avoid status on the Swords Dance sets in lieu of coverage, but giving up Heavy Duty Boots to run Leftovers can be hard for Glastrier since it is weak to Stealth Rock and dislikes Sticky Web. Life Orb is usable on the Swords Dance set to better break through bulkier teams, but this cuts into Glastrier's longevity and makes its dependency on entry hazard removal worse.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Suicune can all not only tank Glastrier's STAB with ease, but can fire back with a Scald which has a good enough chance to neuter Glastrier with a burn.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Corviknight, Rotom-W, and Skarmory can all tank Glastrier's hits with ease before it sets up while either healing off the damage or crippling it with a burn or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Despite being put in the Speed slot, common Choice Scarf users like Kartana, Urshifu-Rapid Strike, and Blacephalon all outspeed non-Choice Scarf sets and even Choice Scarf sets depending on the Speed stat Glastier receives, and threaten it with one of their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Zamazenta-C</strong>: Zamazenta-C can take most attacks from Glastrier including Close Combat thanks to Dauntless Shield. It can also threaten Glastrier with both of its STAB moves and take it down despite how bulky Glastrier is.</p>",

        "description": "<p>With a Speed donation, Glastrier is a fast, bulky, and powerful attacker that can snowball through the opposing team thanks to Chilling Neigh. Icicle Crash is its best STAB option, threatening the likes of Landorus-T and Yveltal and boasting excellent neutral coverage and a nifty flinch chance. Close Combat nails opposing Ice- and Steel-types such as Kyurem-W, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Crunch allows Glastrier to take on threats like Necrozma-DM, Blacephalon, and Lunala, while Megahorn is an alternative to nail Slowbro and Slowking while also hitting other Psychic-types such as Calyrex-I. High Horsepower in the 4th slot provides a safer choice over Close Combat against Steel-types like Heatran while also hitting Necrozma-DM and Blacephalon harder. It also nails Fire types such as Victini and Volcanion. The decision between Choice Scarf and Choice Band depends on its god; it prefers Choice Scarf when paired with slower gods like Yveltal, Lunala, and Ho-Oh, but it makes great use of Choice Band when receiving Speed from Zamazenta-C, Mewtwo, and Pheromosa.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Zygarde-10% and Galarian Moltres appreciate Glastrier's ability to clean up after they have punched holes in the opponent's defensive core. Gods such as Lunala and Yveltal give Glastrier the ability to augment its subpar Speed stat and in turn appreciate the bulk that Glastrier brings to the team; if opting for the Choice Band variant, it should be paired with faster Gods like Zamazenta-C and Mewtwo. Entry hazard support, particularly Spikes, from Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory helps Glastrier to wear down Steel-types that it tends to struggle with. Glastrier also struggles with entry hazards itself, so Defoggers such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W help ease Glastrier being worn down by them. While opposing bulky Water-types can give Glastrier trouble, they are still the best partners for it as they can handle opposing Fire-types such as Victini and Blacephalon with ease. Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Gastrodon are all excellent choices. Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Kartana appreciate Glastrier's ability to take out Flying-types such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos. Electric-types such as Zeraora and Tapu Koko appreciate Glastrier's ability to get rid of Ground-types such as Zygarde-10% and Landorus-T, allowing them to have an easier time sweeping. In return, they threaten bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Suicune, and Tapu Fini, which allows Glastrier to have an easier time sweeping.</p>"

      "Swords Dance (Spe)": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance lets Glastrier take advantage of its decent enough coverage and good bulk to set up and sweep. Icicle Crash is the best STAB option Glastrier has, hitting Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Yveltal, and Rillaboom. Close Combat allows it to hit those pesky Steel-types and opposing Ice-types such as Heatran, Kyurem-B, and opposing Glastrier. Crunch is a safe option that nails opposing Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Blacephalon, Galarian Slowking, and Victini. Megahorn, however, provides Glastrier with a way to hit Slowbro and Slowking harder. Swords Dance is the star of this set, allowing Glastrier to boost up to take out an opposing Pokemon then snowball from there.</p> <p>Swords Dance Glastrier is normally found on hyper offense teams that can provide it with dual screens support; Alolan Ninetales and Tapu Koko are great dual screens leads. Glastrier requires a high Speed stat, meaning it should generally be paired with one of Mewtwo, Pheromosa, or Zamazenta-C. They also help Glastrier break down walls in the case of Zamazenta-C and Mewtwo or get a switch in from a fast U-turn in the case of Pheromosa. Entry hazard support from the likes of Garchomp and Skarmory is greatly appreciated here, as Glastrier can force a lot of switches and therefore help wear down the opposing team. Glastrier still struggles to muscle past bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Tapu Fini, so Pokemon like Rillaboom, Kartana, and Zeraora can help ease those matchups by wearing them down or taking them out completely. Choice Scarf Fire-types such as Blacephalon, Heatran, and Victini appreciate Glastrier's ability to break down walls for them to clean up afterwards.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Megahorn gives Calyrex-I a strong option to weaken Slowbro with, but isn't very useful outside of this due to its poor accuracy and low coverage. SubSeed sets allows Calyrex-I to fix its longevity issues, beat Water-types, and get free turns to boost or use Glacial Lance, but it struggles to safely use Substitute and deal significant damage due to its weakness-laden typing and reliance on Glacial Lance as its only attack, respectively. Double Dance sets with Agility and Swords Dance excel at cleaning up offensive teams but can struggle to find turns to safely set up with both moves, as well as failing to outspeed Pheromosa, Zamazenta-C, and their speed receivers at +2.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chip damage</strong>: Calyrex-I lacks recovery and wants to use its bulk to trade damage, so is prone to being worn down over time. Many Pokemon that Calyrex-I forces out, such as Tapu Koko and Landorus-T, also carry pivot moves to deal repeated chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Physically defensive Water-types like Slowbro, Slowking, Rotom-W, and Vaporeon easily withstand Glacial Lance, aren't afraid of High Horsepower, have recovery moves and can threaten Calyrex-I out with a burn. These all need to watch for Trick and Seed Bomb, however.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-H and Volcarona</strong>: Both of these resist Ice and aren't scared out by High Horsepower. Rotom-H can both threaten a KO and uses Calyrex-I as momentum thanks to Volt Switch, whereas Volcarona can punish High Horsepower with Flame Body and can use it as fodder to boost with Quiver Dance or heal with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM and Skarmory</strong>: Necrozma-DM easily withstands High Horsepower thanks to Prism Armor, and can use Calyrex-I as fodder to boost with Dragon Dance or heal with Morning Sun. Skarmory can spam Roost to drain Calyrex-I of Glacial Lance PP and matches Swords Dance with Iron Defense, however fears a 2HKO from Adamant Choice Band Calyrex-I.</p> <p><strong>Offensive pressure</strong>: Trick Room Calyrex-I requires 2 turns of setup to be truly threatening, so offensive threats like Kartana, Necrozma-DM, and Weavile can force Calyrex-I out before it can set itself up.</p>",

      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Calyrex-I's stat spread, offensive movepool, and Swords Dance make it a great Trick Room attacker. Trick Room turns its low Speed into an advantage, which combined with Swords Dances allow it to easily break through opposing teams. Glacial Lance is Calyrex-I's STAB attack of choice and threatens massive damage on any non-resistant foe. High Horsepower is mandatory coverage to hit Steel-types like Zamazenta-C and Necrozma-DM super effectively, with Ground /Ice coverage being almost unresisted in the tier. Seed Bomb is an option on full Trick Room teams, where Calyrex-I can rely on teammates to set Trick Room for it, as it hits Calyrex-I's two biggest nemeses in Slowbro and Rotom-W super effectively. Heavy-Duty Boots fixes Calyrex-I's entry hazard weakness and preserves its bulk. Life Orb scales up its damage output and notably allows it to 2HKO Slowbro and Rotom-W with unboosted Seed Bomb, whereas Weakness Policy can bypass the need to spend turns boosting with Swords Dance.</p> <p>Trick Room Calyrex-I can fit on both balance and full Trick Room teams as their main sweeper. Good HP and amazing Defense transform defensive Pokemon like Rotom-W and Clefable, respectively, into excellent physical walls that can safely switch in should Trick Room expire. High Special Defense is useful on a variety of utility Pokemon like Landorus-T and Corviknight to help keep entry hazards clear and position Calyrex to deal damage, the former of which can also carry Toxic and Stealth Rock to whittle down opposing physical walls. Fast attackers benefit greatly from Calyrex-I's huge Attack, compounding wallbreaker and revenge killer into one slot for threats like Persian-A, Zygarde-10%, and Weavile. On Trick Room teams, Calyrex-I's bulk helps setters like Hatterene and Porygon2 safely switch in and set up Trick Room - in Porygon2's case, this also helps with safely getting a teammate in via Teleport. Marowak and Araquanid are Calyrex-I's greatest Attack beneficiaries thanks to Thick Club and Water Bubble, respectively, offering unmatched instant power that allows them to break past the majority of common physical checks. Calyrex-I's meager Speed can also be turned to its advantage by slowing allies such as Kartana and Blacephalon down, allowing them to underspeed more foes while Trick Room is active.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band gives Calyrex-I great instant power, making it a potent wallbreaker that can 2HKO even durable physical walls like Skarmory and Clefable. Glacial Lance and High Horsepower are mandatory to maximize the amount of targets that Calyrex-I can threaten. Trick lets Calyrex-I cripple physical walls such as Slowking and Rotom-H, making it much easier for Calyrex-I or its teammates to break through these Pokemon. Aromatherapy supports the team by removing status such as burn and toxic, notably allowing Calyrex-I to play more aggressively against common Water-types like Rotom-W and Slowbro. Seed Bomb can guarantee a 2HKO or better on these Water-types but comes with the cost of locking Calyrex-I into a relatively weak Grass-type move. Adamant provides maximum wallbreaking power whereas Jolly allows Calyrex-I to Speed tie uninvested Landorus-T and outspeed uninvested Rotom and Pokemon with base 90 Speed like Giratina and Ho-Oh.</p> <p>Calyrex-I best fits on balanced and bulky offense teams that can leverage its base stat donations and wallbreaking ability to beat opposing defensive cores. Kartana is an excellent partner, as it appreciates Calyrex-I's Special Defense donations and can help against the Water-types that Calyrex-I struggles to break past. Landorus-T also appreciates the donation as Toxic and Stealth Rock provide valuable chip damage, netting Calyrex-I more KOs and helping it snowball with As One, as well as helping it get in safely with U-turn. Attack donations are best used on fast sweepers and priority users like Zeraora, Rillaboom, and Weavile, as these can make good use of the damage Calyrex-I causes to clean weakened teams late-game. Defense and HP donations can be used by both bulky pivots, such as Rotom-W and Rotom-H (both of which provide valuable Fire and Steel resistances), or bulky set-up sweepers such as Volcarona and Calm Mind Clefable.</p>"
