        "description": "<p>Arceus-Ground boasts amazing defensive capabilities, effectively checking wallbreakers such as Great Tusk and Raging Bolt, while also maintaining a formidable offensive presence. Ice Beam offers a valuable coverage option that deals significant damage to opposing Arceus-Ground, Great Tusk, and Dragonite. Alternatively, Power Gem can be employed to counter foes like Ho-Oh, which would otherwise force Arceus-Ground to switch out. Gravity may also be used to enable Arceus-Ground to neutralize common Latiasite users, such as Magearna, Garganacl, and Pecharunt, as well as Flying-types like Ho-Oh and Corviknight, rendering them vulnerable to Judgment. Calm Mind amplifies Arceus-Ground's potential as a setup sweeper, whereas Will-O-Wisp enhances its defensive utility by crippling physical attackers. It can also be employed as a Stealth Rock user, as most Sablenite foes such as Magearna, Garganacl, and Pecharunt find it really difficult to switch into. The Speed EVs allow Arceus-Ground to outspeed Hearthflame Mask Great Tusk. Arceus-Ground's versatility as both an offensive and defensive Pokemon makes it an excellent addition to all team archetypes. Pairing it with other defensive partners like Magearna, Corviknight, and Pecharunt creates a robust defensive core, allowing them to check each other's weaknesses, such as the former two being able to check Ice-types like Weavile and Baxcalibur, while Arceus-Ground switches into Fire-type foes. Arceus-Ground struggles to counter Water-type Pokemon such as Arceus-Water and Urshifu-R, making Pokemon like Raging Bolt, Eternatus, and Regieleki valuable partners, with the latter also providing entry hazard removal support.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Magearna is the cornerstone of defensive utility and a premier Spikes user, as it can reliably wield a variety of defensive Mega Stones while supporting its teammates through pivoting. It can fit on practically any playstyle, capable of dealing with metagame staples like Lunala and Raging Bolt while having a ton of role compression. Latiasite is the most common Mega Stone, as the Ground immunity gained by Levitate allows it to switch into Pokemon like Dragonite, Arceus-Ground, and Pinsirite Great Tusk and threaten them out. Sablenite is useful for not only granting amazing boosts in both defensive stats, allowing Magearna to take hits that it would normally run from, but also letting it bounce back entry hazards and status from Garganacl, defensive Arceus formes, and other Magearna. Manectite, in combination with a Bold nature, is used on more offensive teams, as with Intimidate, Magearna can weaken common physical attackers like Arceus and Regieleki. Ice Beam gives Magearna consistent damage against Pokemon that it checks like Arceus-Ground lacking Calm Mind and Eternatus, as well as threatening out Ground-types like Great Tusk and Hippowdon for non-Latiasite sets. Alternatively, Fleur Cannon hits harder against Pokemon that don't resist it and can OHKO Altarianite Dragonite and Regieleki but leaves Magearna fairly weak after use. Magearna is an amazing Spikes setter, as it fares well against common hazard removers such as Regieleki and Mandibuzz, as well as being capable of pivoting on hazard-blocking Magic Bounce users like Corviknight and Galarian Slowking and chipping down Pokemon like Hippowdon and Eternatus for teammates such as Regieleki and Urshifu-R. On the other hand, Encore can disrupt common setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Arceus formes and Dragonite. Frailer wallbreakers like Regieleki, Ceruledge, and Spectrier appreciate Magearna giving them slow pivoting, allowing them to consistently break the opposing team without worrying about switching in. Blue Orb Kilowattrel and Water-types like Urshifu-R and Arceus-Water can pressure Ground-types like Hippowdon and Arceus-Ground that threaten out non-Latiasite sets with ease and deal with Fire-types like Hisuian Arcanine and Hearthflame Mask Great Tusk in particular that give Magearna trouble. Due to Magearnaâ€™s constant switching, it can get easily worn down by Spikes chip damage without Latiasite, so hazard removers like Regieleki and Great Tusk are great partners.</p>"

With Sablenite, Garganacl's defenses are elevated even further while also granting it Magic Bounce, punishing attempts to set entry hazards except against Mold Breaker foes and allowing it to exploit common Pokemon such as Latiasite Magearna. Alternatively, Tyranitarite provides Garganacl with the Sand Stream ability, so it can increase its Special Defense even further and inflict additional chip damage through sand, which synergizes effectively with Salt Cure and hazards. Earthquake hits foes like Raging Bolt, Ceruledge, and non-Latiasite Magearna and Pecharunt, granting it somewhat of an offensive presence. Curse enhances Garganacl's ability to check physical attackers and can also be utilized to sweep opposing teams all while making it incredibly difficult to KO. Garganacl can even fulfill the role of a Stealth Rock setter by leveraging its ability to force switches and accumulate chip damage through Salt Cure. Garganacl thrives on balance teams and provides them with outstanding defensive utility; thus, pairing it with other bulky partners such as Magearna, Pecharunt, Arceus-Ground, and Ho-Oh creates a formidable core. Magearna has noteworthy synergy, as it also sets Spikes and capitalizes on Garganacl's ability to force switches through Salt Cure. Pokemon such as Arceus-Water, Urshifu-R, and Pinsirite Great Tusk as well as Latiasite users like Pecharunt and Magearna help Garganacl against troublesome Ground-type foes such as Arceus-Ground and Great Tusk. Offensive partners like Regieleki and Dragonite also form effective pairings with Garganacl, as they appreciate its capacity to wall threats like Eternatus, while in return, they can check foes such as Urshifu-R and Iron Boulder.</p>"

Lucarionite further amplifies its breaking power by granting it Adaptability and substantial stat boosts, whereas Diancite can be used to significantly raise its Speed stat, albeit at the cost of some firepower, and thus is only preferred when another better teammate has Lucarionite equipped, like Ceruledge or Kingambit. Timid nature helps Diancite Raging Bolt outspeed Great Tusk, Arceus formes, and Eternatus; a Modest nature allows Lucarionite Raging Bolt to reach feats like OHKOing offensive Arceus-Ground after minimal entry hazard chip damage. Raging Bolt utilizes Draco Meteor for its immense firepower and hit-and-run potential with Volt Switch. Thunderbolt and Discharge provide options for either dealing more damage or fishing for paralysis, respectively. Additionally, Thunderclap allows Raging Bolt to reverse kill Pokemon such as Urshifu-R and Basculegion formes, and Volt Switch enables it go function as a strong pivot. Raging Bolt may also utilize moves such as Calm Mind and Substitute to serve as a devastating progress maker at the cost of Volt Switch's utility or Thunderclap's priority. It synergizes exceptionally well with pivots like Urshifu-R, Magearna, and Pecharunt to form incredible VoltTurn cores; Urshifu-R and the Latiasite versions of the latter two also deal with Ground-types such as Arceus-Ground and Great Tusk, with the former being able to check Blissey as well. Offensive partners such as Spectrier, Calm Mind Arceus formes, and Zamazenta also aid in dismantling opposing defensive cores and thus synergize well with Raging Bolt. Pairing Raging Bolt with hazard setters such as Hearthflame Mask Great Tusk and Magearna helps it secure KOs more efficiently, especially against foes such as Arceus formes. It faces troubles against Pixilate Extreme Speed users such as Dragonite and Regieleki; thus, it is usually paired with Pokemon such as Pecharunt and Arceus-Ground to deal with them.</p>"

Mold Breaker further enhances Pecharunt's utility, granting it the capability to use Toxic against defensive Sablenite users, such as Garganacl and Milotic, and Parting Shot against Magic Bounce users. Malignant Chain can be used in place of Toxic to inflict decent damage to specific targets, including Altarianite Dragonite and Hisuian Arcanine, while also being able to poison common Taunt users such as Arceus and non-Substitute Arceus-Ghost, although the reduced chance of poisoning and the limited PP may render this choice suboptimal. Foul Play enables Pecharunt to deal significant damage to foes like Ceruledge and Lunala, while Parting Shot amplifies its utility as a pivot. Gyaradosite Pecharunt is a valuable addition to balance and bulky offense teams, forming an immaculate core with specially defensive Latiasite Magearna, as they cover each other's checks excluding Hearthflame Mask Great Tusk; Pecharunt is able to deal with Ceruledge, while Magearna provides a Ground immunity with Levitate as well as the ability to set up Spikes and establishes a formidable pivot core. Arceus formes such as Arceus-Ground also solidify the defensive backbone as well as provide an offensive presence to the team with Calm Mind. Entry Hazards can compromise Pecharunt's efficacy as a wall and may force it to use Recover more often, necessitating hazard removers in the team like Regieleki and Great Tusk. Pecharunt can be paired with offensive teammates such as Ceruledge, Raging Bolt, and Urshifu-R as it can easily provide them a safe switch.</p>"
