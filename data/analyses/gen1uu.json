  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Venusaur is generally considered unviable in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>For a while, Venusaur was close to obsolete in UU because Victreebel, which was an already fairly uncommon pick, largely outclassed it. However, Victreebel eventually exited the tier for OU, opening a power vacuum Venusaur was happy to occupy. Thanks to this and a few significant metagame shifts, Venusaur has become a permanent resident of RBY UU.</p> <p>Despite its humble origins, Venusaur is a powerful threat. Sleep is deadly in RBY and Venusaur boasts the second-fastest reliable sleep move in UU, behind only Venomoth. While Venusaur is much slower than tier staples like Tentacruel and Kadabra, its Speed tier is still a cut above several bulky Pokemon, like Hypno and Vaporeon, and happens to be shared with Dragonite. It is in these matchups where Venusaur most often thrives, as it can either use Sleep Powder uncontested or fire off its surprisingly powerful Razor Leaf. Venusaur is a threat that can bully Pokemon with Sleep Powder early-game and continue to exert some offensive pressure once a foe is asleep.</p> <p>Like Victreebel before it, Venusaur is notably restricted by its typing; while Poison does grant an immunity to Toxic, it isn't good for much else. It leaves Venusaur quite vulnerable to Psychic from common Pokemon like Hypno, Kadabra, and Electabuzz while making Earthquake deal neutral damage. Combine this with an Ice weakness and you get a Pokemon with numerous troublesome matchups and some difficulty switching in.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Venusaur has a few interesting moves available to it, though most are not especially useful. Hyper Beam is arguably its best alternative, being used over Toxic to hit a few targets for extra damage and finish off foes like Hypno a bit earlier. Rather impressively, it does well over 60% to Kadabra. Just note that dropping Toxic leaves Venusaur much more susceptible to partial-trapping.</p> <p>A Swords Dance set is possible, but it doesn't exactly take advantage of Venusaur's strengths, and other Pokemon like Tentacruel and Pinsir run the move with more consistency.</p> <p>Leech Seed is a possible alternative to Toxic to deal with partial-trapping while also giving Venusaur some health back; it gives roughly as much as Wrap takes away. The move does have higher accuracy than Toxic, but the effect isn't permanent, and it deals much less damage. Leech Seed also has the advantage of affecting Tentacruel, though it is unable to hit Tangela. The move can also be used in tandem with Toxic to continuously escalate Leech Seed's drained health, but setting this up in a real match is much easier said than done.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: If Venusaur has already used Sleep Powder on something else, Haunter is a pretty big issue. Venusaur's only option is Razor Leaf, which is 5HKO or worse. Haunter can 3HKO it if it's carrying Psychic or 4HKO with Night Shade.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Venusaur's Body Slam isn't particularly strong, so most Flying-type Pokemon can easily scare it away. Dragonite and Articuno take very little damage from any of Venusaur's moves and can 2HKO with Blizzard, though it is only guaranteed for the latter. Dodrio can set up Agility fairly freely in front of Venusaur, as Drill Peck is a 2HKO and Body Slam can't paralyze it. While rare, Moltres performs almost identically to Articuno against Venusaur.</p> <p><strong>Psychic Users</strong>: Kadabra is the scariest foe that can exploit Venusaur's weakness to Psychic, as it outpaces Venusaur and 2HKOes it. Due to the risk of a critical hit, Venusaur will almost always switch out, assuming Kadabra is healthy. Note that Hyper Beam is a legitimate threat to a paralyzed Kadabra, however. Hypno also 2HKOes but is slower, so it only really acts as a check if it is paralyzed or if one of its teammates is already asleep. Electabuzz is very likely to 3HKO Venusaur if it has Psychic, though Razor Leaf is also a 3HKO. Interestingly, the uncommon Venomoth is a premier Venusaur check. It effortlessly shrugs off Razor Leaf, outspeeds, carries Sleep Powder and Stun Spore, and 3HKOes with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves</strong>: Fortunately for Venusaur, it is faster than most users of Ice-type moves, so it is much less afraid of them than its rival Tangela. Nonetheless, there are a few Pokemon that can outspeed and threaten Venusaur. Tentacruel is the most prominent, as it can use Wrap and score a KO as early as 63.9%. Gyarados doesn't take Razor Leaf very well, but it barely outspeeds and threatens a likely 2HKO with Blizzard. If Venusaur is paralyzed, it becomes a lot more afraid of Pokemon like Vaporeon, Omastar, and especially Dewgong.</p>",

      "Sleeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Razor Leaf will virtually always land a critical hit, so it provides Venusaur with a reliable and powerful STAB move that gives it a key advantage over Tangela. Its base damage is higher than Raichu's Thunderbolt and even with Tentacruel's Surf. Razor Leaf will always OHKO Dugtrio and Omastar and deal well over 50% to Water-type Pokemon like Poliwrath and Dewgong. The move will also 2HKO Vaporeon 78.6% of the time, making Venusaur the only Pokemon in UU to do so reliably. Some neutral targets take hefty damage as well, with Kangaskhan and Kadabra dropping to two and three hits, respectively. Additionally, Razor Leaf's critical hits make it a very good move for taking out rare Amnesia users like Poliwrath and Golduck. Because Venusaur was unfortunately denied access to Stun Spore, it makes use of Body Slam to try to spread paralysis. This is helpful against common switch-ins like Dragonite, Tentacruel, Articuno, and Kadabra. The move is also Venusaur's best option for hitting some targets that resist Razor Leaf. Toxic prevents Dragonite from using Wrap effectively. It also happens to be Venusaur's best move against Tangela, notably shutting down variants that run Bind. Other, less common users of partial-trapping moves, like Pinsir and Moltres, also prefer to avoid Toxic, though they are more capable of fighting off Venusaur in general.</p> <p>Sleep Powder is Venusaur's most significant move. Working Venusaur into battle against slower foes so it can use Sleep Powder is essential to using it effectively. Most often, Venusaur will try to somehow get in against Hypno. Most simply, Venusaur can just switch in whenever the opponent is likely to switch in a healthy Hypno. Special attackers, especially Kadabra, are quite good at baiting in Hypno; note that this can be done as early as turn 1 by leading with Kadabra. Venusaur can also come in after Hypno, or really any Pokemon, has used Rest and use Sleep Powder to catch a switch-in or put the Rest user right back to sleep. While exploiting Hypno and resting Pokemon is Venusaur's main route to success, it isn't its only one. For example, it can switch well into Dugtrio despite not quite walling it, as it can threaten an OHKO with Razor Leaf in addition to sleep. Venusaur also punishes Substitute Dugtrio exceptionally well, as Sleep Powder breaches the Substitute. Venusaur is also pretty good against Electric-type Pokemon, especially Raichu, but the threat of paralysis makes the matchup a little less desirable. It is important not to paralyze many Pokemon before Venusaur has used Sleep Powder, as many Pokemon can easily wall it once they are paralyzed. Once Venusaur has used Sleep Powder, it will usually will transition right away to using Body Slam to try to paralyze a switch-in. After that, it can serve as an answer to sleeping Water-type Pokemon or an auxiliary check to Dugtrio in the endgame. Venusaur is also fairly common sleep fodder.</p> <p>Venusaur's traits make it a good teammate for several key Pokemon in the UU metagame. Leads like Kadabra and Electabuzz that goad Pokemon like Hypno and Dugtrio to switch in work very well with Venusaur, as they allow it to use Sleep Powder early on before paralysis is spread. Articuno is uniquely suited to partner with Venusaur. It appreciates Venusaur's ability to effortlessly thwart Water-type Pokemon as well as its Sleep Powder, which can make setting up Agility much easier. Articuno, in turn, does well against a lot of Pokemon that can scare or bully Venusaur, like Dragonite, Dodrio, and Tangela. Other wallbreakers and sweepers like Kangaskhan, Persian, Dodrio, and Dragonite appreciate Venusaur for similar reasons.</p>"

  "Charizard": {
    "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. Charizard is generally considered less viable in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Charizard is defined by Swords Dance in RBY UU, which, when combined with its near-unresisted coverage in Body Slam and Earthquake, lets it threaten a large portion of the tier once set up. Additionally, STAB Fire Blast lets it immediately threaten teams featuring Grass-types like Tangela and Venusaur, which normally perform admirably against teams using staple Normal-types like Persian and Kangaskhan. Plus, it can Speed tie tier-king Tentacruel while threatening significant damage with Earthquake or a burn with Fire Blast, the latter of which severely dampens its Wrap. Thus, Charizard is a fine pick on offensive teams that need a specialised wallbreaker that can spread burns.</p> <p>However, Charizard's typing is generally not suitable for UU, being weak to some of the most common offensive types in the tier, which makes it much frailer than it lets on. In addition, Charizard suffers greatly from Wrap; AgiliWrap Dragonite shuts it down and can set up on it very consistently, and slower Wrap users force it to choose between switching out and losing Swords Dance boosts or being worn down. In Tentacruel's case, Charizard can potentially win the Speed tie if it stays in, but Surf often causes it to lose if it hasn't set up prior. Because Charizard is reliant on its Speed to succeed, it is also ruined by paralysis, and the threat of this frequently forces it out before it can deal any significant damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Charizard has a very wide movepool. Replacing Fire Blast or its fourth moveslot is feasible, though it loses its near-unresisted coverage in the process. This can end up hurting Charizard's matchups against either Grass-types like Tangela and Venusaur or Gyarados and Dragonite, both of which are hard to work around.</p> <p>Charizard can use Fire Spin to pivot out against its checks, making it more versatile and supplementing its offense. This can improve its Dragonite matchup, letting it pivot out to a Pokemon with Toxic, such as Persian. However, the punishment for missing with Charizard can be paralysis, which it can't afford with its wallbreaking role. Worse still, Fire Spin often ends up inviting in checks like Tentacruel, Gyarados, and Vaporeon, which take minimal damage while forcing Charizard out. Other Pokemon tend to make better use of Fire Spin, most notably Moltres, which has higher Special, and Rapidash, which has higher Speed, notably outpacing Tentacruel. Both have access to Agility as well, letting them use the aggressive AgiliSpin combination.</p> <p>Counter is a fringe option for Persian, Kangaskhan, and Dodrio, all of which have powerful Normal-type STAB moves. Counter is useful if Charizard survives a Hyper Beam to fire back during the recharge turn, which indirectly gives Charizard a switch-in opportunity. Charizard can also use Hyper Beam itself, which is an incredibly strong finisher if one decides to use an even more aggressive set. In fact, Charizard can even 2HKO Vaporeon with +2 Earthquake followed by Hyper Beam. However, this further increases Charizard's reliance on Swords Dance and leaves it without a midground option. Mega Kick is also a valid option for 2HKOing Vaporeon half the time, though its utility outside of this is questionable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Charizard cannot deal with paralysis at all, often being forced out by the threat of it. Without its Speed, Charizard loses its valuable Speed tie against Tentacruel and can be chipped down by Wrap and dispatched with Surf. Kadabra and Electabuzz outspeed Charizard while threatening it with Thunder Wave,making them common switch-ins to Swords Dance attempts. Electabuzz is particularly notable for having STAB Thunderbolt, which 2HKOes Charizard. Thus, these Pokemon must be paralyzed—or ideally, removed—if Charizard is to attempt a sweep. Charizard can situationally win if they're paralyzed, as +2 Earthquake OHKOes Electabuzz and has a small chance to OHKO Kadabra. Furthermore, Body Slam paralyzing them on the switch can completely turn the tables on them. Tangela, while being 2HKOed by Fire Blast and disliking burns, can paralyze Charizard with Stun Spore, meaning it should be chipped into KO range. Body Slam users such as Dodrio, Kangaskhan, Gyarados, Dragonite, and Vaporeon are also minor ways for Charizard to be paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Without Toxic, Fire Spin, or a lucky Fire Blast burn, Charizard can't hinder AgiliWrap Dragonite, thus letting it switch in, set up, and take over the game from there. Furthermore, even non-AgiliWrap variants can threaten Charizard directly with a 2HKO from Blizzard or paralysis from Body Slam, as well as a 2HKO from Thunderbolt with minor chip damage prior.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Without switching in on a predicted Rest and setting up, Charizard fails to make an impact against the Water-types of the tier. Gyarados is notable for being immune to Earthquake, only being remotely threatened with a 3HKO from +2 Body Slam, and KOing Charizard with Hydro Pump if it's taken even minor damage. Vaporeon and Dewgong can survive a 2HKO from +2 Earthquake while threatening back with their STAB moves, dealing massive damage. Omastar can OHKO Charizard a quarter of the time with Hydro Pump but takes significant damage from +2 Earthquake. Tentacruel can shut Charizard down with Wrap and deals massive damage with Surf, but +2 Earthquake OHKOes it half the time, making this a matchup it can't really afford to play into due to its high value. Generally, if any Water-type uses Rest and Charizard switches in, it can make use of those free turns to win, but it must KO them by the turn they wake up to not lose momentum.</p> <p><strong>Aerodactyl</strong>: Aerodactyl is the only Pokemon in the entire game to resist the combination of Fire, Normal, and Ground, which makes it effective at revenge killing Charizard. While it can't afford to take a burn, Aerodactyl shrugs off any attack Charizard throws at it while threatening a 3HKO with two Double-Edge uses followed by Hyper Beam. Aerodactyl can also use Toxic on rare Fire Spin variants to cause Charizard to take more damage than Fire Spin deals.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Coverage</strong>: Dugtrio and Kangaskhan can't switch in on Fire Blast by threat of a burn, but both 2HKO Charizard with Rock Slide. Dugtrio is of particular note for excellently revenge killing Charizard, as it outspeeds it. However, Dugtrio cannot switch in on Body Slam, which may incapacitate it with paralysis. Additionally, if Dugtrio or Kangaskhan has taken damage, Charizard is likely to come out on top with Fire Blast, which has a strong probability to 2HKO both. Golem, while rare, can OHKO Charizard with Rock Slide, but it is threatened with a 2HKO from +2 Earthquake, and Fire Blast burns ruin its valuable Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: While outsped and 2HKOed by Fire Blast, Articuno can OHKO Charizard with Blizzard half the time, so Charizard can only really afford to fight Articuno if it has already taken damage. Articuno has ample opportunity to switch in on Earthquake as well, which forces Charizard to either gamble on a critical hit or switch out. In the event Charizard uses Fire Spin, it can chip Articuno down to Fire Blast range, but this will take around seven turns at minimum without critical hits, all of which risk a miss or low Fire Spin duration.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance is essential for Charizard to do any significant damage to many foes, as its Attack is initially quite mediocre. Fire Blast is very powerful, 2HKOing Articuno, Venusaur, and Tangela. The burn chance is also highly beneficial for incapacitating resistant Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Tentacruel, and some Dragonite and Gyarados variants. However, it arguably benefits Persian, which can no longer be paralyzed—and Slash bypasses the Attack drop. Earthquake is Charizard's best chance at beating Tentacruel during the Speed ties. At +2, it OHKOes Electabuzz, Raichu, and Haunter, as well as Tentacruel half the time; it also 2HKOes Omastar. Charizard's last moveslot is largely based on its team, but one of the two choices is crucial for providing near-unresisted coverage alongside Earthquake. Body Slam is a solid fourth move for its paralysis chance, giving Charizard a midground option and having much higher damage output when boosted with Swords Dance. On the other hand, Slash is a near-guaranteed critical hit, making it almost equal to Hyper Beam and thus giving Charizard immediate power; however, it ignores boosts and thus lacks synergy with Swords Dance.</p> <p>Charizard succeeds as a wallbreaker and is thus an effective punishment for Pokemon using Rest. Most notably, it can switch in on a predicted Rest from Hypno, set up Swords Dance, and threaten up to 51.2% damage with Earthquake. This forces Hypno to either attempt to Rest stall or switch out, both of which are less than ideal situations. Similarly, Pokemon like Omastar fail to wall Charizard if it switches in on their Rests. Despite this, Charizard should not set up without prior scouting, as the mere risk of it setting up often prompts an immediate switch-in from the opponent, which can be anything from a counter to a paralysis spreader, the latter of which makes it little more than death fodder. Charizard is very capable of sweeping late-game once such checks are removed.</p> <p>Charizard is best used on teams that struggle against those featuring Venusaur and Tangela, which often employ Articuno to set up against a sleeping Pokemon and sweep. Persian makes another excellent partner, being faster than Tentacruel while profiting heavily from the openings Charizard can provide against common defensive cores. Like many Pokemon, Charizard benefits significantly from Hypno, which grants it significant openings with its longevity, paralysis, and sleep. Teams using Charizard should account for its lack of defensive utility: the most it can offer is double switching into Earthquake. Bulky Water-types like Omastar and Dewgong cover its weaknesses very well, being resistant to Ice and Water at once; Omastar particularly benefits thanks to Charizard's immunity to Earthquake. Pokemon immune to Electric also very helpful, coming with the added bonus of limiting the spread of Thunder Wave paralysis. Dugtrio works particularly well, as its Speed and power ensure it keeps momentum after absorbing Thunder Wave. Charizard also tends to draw in Grass- or Water-types that try to check it, allowing Dugtrio to force damage onto them; however, other Pokemon like Aerodactyl and Gyarados can also perform this task admirably. Because Charizard cannot normally deal with Dragonite without a Fire Blast burn, Dragonite checks such as the ubiquitous Tentacruel, Gyarados, Articuno, and Toxic users such as Aerodactyl, Persian, Dugtrio, and Kangaskhan are all viable teammates.</p>"

Blastoise is generally considered unviable in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Blastoise, while having decent stats, is outclassed by the myriad of other Water-types in RBY UU. As a special attacker and tank, it is outclassed by Vaporeon, which has higher HP and Special. As a physical tank, it is outclassed by Poliwrath, which has access to Hypnosis and a powerful STAB Submission. However, Blastoise has higher Defense than Vaporeon and higher Special than Poliwrath, giving it some merit as a mixed tank. Access to Earthquake gives it a powerful coverage move to hit certain targets that most other Water-types cannot. However, Poliwrath also learns Earthquake, and it has a better Attack stat.

Hydro Pump can be run for extra power that notably allows Blastoise to OHKO Dugtrio, something Surf cannot achieve.

Blizzard hits many Water-resistant Pokemon hard, dealing huge damage to threats like Dragonite and Tangela. Earthquake gives Blastoise a way to beat Tentacruel, something many other Water-types lack, as well as hitting Electabuzz and Raichu for super effective damage. The final moveslot will normally be occupied by Rest, allowing Blastoise to stick around for much longer.

  "Raticate": {
    "overview": "<p>Raticate is a bit of a mixed bag. Its unique access to Super Fang allows it to weaken a Pokemon for threats like Dodrio to clean up later or outright KO foes itself with Hyper Beam. Not only that, Raticate also has an interesting special movepool that it can tap into akin to Persian, making it possible to fine-tune for a team. Raticate is also in a very unique Speed tier, being just above Haunter, and is immune to Body Slam paralysis thanks to being a Normal-type. Raticate's 18.97% critical hit rate adds significant volatility to many matchups as well, making it difficult to switch into when also considering Super Fang. These factors often let Raticate score at least one Super Fang before it goes down, which is more than enough for its teammates to break through and wreak havoc. All of these factors enable Raticate to fulfil a supportive role for its team while remaining a decent sweeper in its own right.</p> <p>However, Raticate faces some stiff competition from Kangaskhan and Persian, which possess much better stats, coverage, and general offensive potential. In addition, Raticate has poor special bulk, with attacks like Tentacruel's Surf being a guaranteed 2HKO. This makes it a nightmare to bring in without heavy support or one-for-one trades. Furthermore, Raticate relies heavily on its Speed to make progress, making paralysis a death sentence due to its fragility. Overall, this makes Raticate a high-risk, high-reward Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bubble Beam can replace Blizzard to 2HKO Golem or KO after a Super Fang on the switch. In addition, Bubble Beam's chance to lower Speed can let Raticate beat normally faster Pokemon that switch in expecting a Blizzard, such as Tentacruel. Without Blizzard, though, Raticate doesn't have a convincing way of stopping Dragonite from paralyzing it with Thunder Wave. Thunder can be used for a better matchup against Gyarados, possessing a guaranteed KO after Super Fang. It has little use outside of this, however, as Omastar and Vaporeon are only 2HKOed after Super Fang and will always win prolonged interactions. It is possible for Raticate to run two special moves at once—usually Blizzard and either Thunder or Bubble Beam—though this comes at the cost of Body Slam's consistency and potentially game-changing paralysis chance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Raticate can still halve Haunter's HP with Super Fang, but Blizzard does extremely poor damage. On the other hand, Haunter can 3HKO Raticate with Thunderbolt or put it to sleep with Hypnosis. Raticate will sometimes win one-on-one thanks to its Speed and Super Fang, but this is not consistent enough to recommend.</p> <p><strong>Omastar</strong>: Omastar resists Raticate's STAB moves, doesn't get OHKOed after a Super Fang, and easily 2HKOes Raticate with Hydro Pump. Omastar can switch in on a Hyper Beam, forcing Raticate out after it recharges and inflicting significant damage in the process. Raticate can use Thunder to try and get a better matchup, but Omastar takes no more than 36.1%, thus still winning one-on-one unless paralysis or critical hits are involved.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Raticate's best qualities are its Speed and access to Super Fang, which forces slower threats to take significant damage before they can land a hit. Ergo, paralysis is a massive threat to its success, and Raticate should avoid chipping threats that can paralyze it. Paralysis's Speed drop exposes Raticate's extreme fragility while further reducing the consistency of Super Fang, making it effectively dead weight in many situations. Threats like Hypno, Tangela, Dragonite, and Electabuzz that can paralyze Raticate force it out unless they're chipped already. Once Raticate has scored a KO, opponents often bring these Pokemon in, causing the Raticate user to lose a significant amount of momentum. It should be noted that Hypno and paralyzed Electabuzz can't switch into Raticate, as Super Fang + Hyper Beam has a favorable chance to KO them outright. Dragonite also can't switch into Raticate, as Blizzard will KO it after Super Fang.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Tentacruel and Vaporeon possess very effective ways to force out Raticate. Tentacruel can switch in on Super Fang if it isn't paralyzed and subsequently scare Raticate out with a 2HKO from Surf. However, Tentacruel is threatened with an outright KO from Super Fang + Hyper Beam. Vaporeon, on the other hand, survives Hyper Beam after a Super Fang and can still 2HKO Raticate with Surf.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: Golem's Rock typing lets it easily switch in on Raticate's Hyper Beam and 2HKO it with Earthquake. Should Raticate lack a super effective move against Golem, it is very likely to lose the matchup. However, after a Super Fang, Raticate has a 41% chance to KO Golem with Blizzard and KOes it outright with Bubble Beam.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Super Fang is the main reason you would use Raticate, as halving a foe's HP is extremely useful for supporting a team, and without it, Raticate is outclassed by Persian. Hyper Beam is used alongside Super Fang to KO Hypno most of the time, as well as take out threats like Tentacruel and Dodrio. It also allows Raticate to bring down a paralyzed team late-game. Body Slam reliably dents threats and spreads paralysis. Blizzard is used to 2HKO Dragonite or KO it after a Super Fang on the switch in.</p> <p>Raticate can be used early-game thanks to the sheer utility of Super Fang, dealing significant damage to a foe and likely putting it into KO range for Raticate's teammates. Raticate is best used mid- or late-game, though, where Super Fang is most likely to help its teammates. Raticate is best switched in on passive foes that won't damage it, such as those immobilized by Wrap or about to use Recover or Rest. Smart double switching is also a good way to bring it in. However, bringing in Raticate to revenge kill a threat isn't out of the question either, especially if that threat is a faster Pokemon that has been bogged down with paralysis. Raticate should be playing hit-and-run first and foremost, as not only is it frail, but landing a Super Fang is more than enough to leave foes open to exploitation by Raticate's teammates anyway.</p>"

  "Arbok": {
    "overview": "<p>Arbok has an extremely small and specific niche in the metagame thanks to its unique access to Glare and Wrap. This lands it a role as a paralysis spreader, pivot, and wincon on some Wrap teams. It's also notable for its Poison typing, which blocks Toxic, a move that cripples most Wrap users. This allows it safe entry against Pokemon like Persian that often carry Toxic. Its typing also allows it to check Grass-types such as Tangela and Venusaur. In addition, Arbok has fantastic coverage in Earthquake and Rock Slide, the combination of which is unresisted in the tier.</p> <p>However, the positives end there. Arbok's typing, while providing it a niche, also leaves it cripplingly weak to Psychic and Earthquake, two very common moves in the metagame. This gives it poor matchups against some of the tier's most notable Pokemon, such as Kadabra and Dugtrio. These weaknesses, along with its poor bulk, mean Arbok is doomed to struggle defensively. Arbok is also weak and lacks a good STAB move, so it can struggle to threaten in ways outside of paralysis spreading and Wrap. Arbok also has to compete with Tentacruel, an omnipresent Pokemon with a better matchup spread and more offensive presence.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Glare + Wrap": {
        "description": "<p>Glare lets Arbok cripple Pokemon that are normally difficult to paralyze, most notably Thunder Wave-immune Ground-types like Dugtrio. It's then able to outspeed them and pivot out with Wrap, allowing a teammate more suitable for the matchup to come in while they're immobilized. Earthquake lets Arbok threaten Pokemon that resist its Normal-type attacks, such as Haunter, Omastar, and Golem, as well as ensuring Tentacruel can't switch in for free. Hyper Beam is Arbok's strongest attack, notably KOing Kadabra at 65% and Dugtrio at 54%. This makes it an excellent move for finishing off foes that have been repeatedly chipped down by Arbok's Wrap. Alternatively, Rock Slide grants Arbok unresisted coverage alongside Earthquake, as well as giving it a much better matchup versus Flying-types such as Aerodactyl, Articuno, and Gyarados.</p> <p>Arbok has a very peculiar place on Wrap spam teams that feature additional Wrappers like Dragonite or Pinsir, as it's able to block Toxic from foes such as Persian and Aerodactyl, then threaten them with Glare thereafter. In general, Arbok and Dragonite pair well with each other, as Dragonite also checks Dugtrio, which threatens Arbok with its mighty STAB Earthquake. Arbok also appreciates a Pokemon that checks Psychic-types, so Kadabra and the ubiquitous Hypno pair with it well. Arbok is best used mid-game, spreading paralysis to support endgame sweeps and pivoting into its teammates as needed.</p> <p>Arbok does not have very many other options, as they generally sacrifice consistency and it doesn't have the stats to take advantage of them well. Body Slam allows Arbok to threaten both paralysis and damage at the same time, deterring switch-ins, but the damage is miniscule due to a lack of STAB and the paralysis chance is low compared to Glare. Acid is Arbok's best STAB move, doing more damage to Tangela than Earthquake or Rock Slide while having a high chance to drop Defense, which allows Arbok to deal further damage, encourage predictable switching, and reapply paralysis Speed drops.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/rby-ou-viability-rankings.3685861/post-10591542\">2025 RBY OU Viability Rankings Update</a>, the Partial Trapping ban, and the unbans of Lapras, Hypno, and Articuno from RBY UU. As a result, it may contain outdated information.</p> <hr /> <p>Raichu has a niche in UU as an Electric-type that can threaten Ground-types like Golem thanks to its access to Surf. The combination of Surf and STAB Thunderbolt gives it excellent coverage and sweeping potential that can be difficult for many teams to handle. In addition, Raichu's Speed allows it to tie with the ever-present Tentacruel, as well as Dodrio. On top of that, the 19.53% critical hit rate its base Speed provides makes it surprisingly powerful offensively. It can further increase this Speed while invalidating the Speed drop from paralysis thanks to Agility, which comes with the added bonus of outspeeding Dugtrio. Furthermore, Raichu is quite customizable, possessing a wide movepool with moves like Body Slam and Seismic Toss to make use of.</p> <p>However, Raichu is physically frail, taking significant damage from threats like Dodrio, Persian, and Kangaskhan. In fact, it's not uncommon to see Raichu get KOed by their STAB Hyper Beams from around 80%. This fragility notably comes into play against Dugtrio, which can KO it consistently with Earthquake if it's taken even a minute amount of damage. It's not stellar on the Special end either, with threats like Tentacruel, Vaporeon, Hypno, and Kadabra all claiming 3HKOs on it with their STAB attacks. This has a negative effect on its offenses as well, with its Thunderbolt only 3HKOing Vaporeon and occasionally missing the OHKO on Gyarados. Raichu also competes heavily with Electabuzz for a place on teams, which has higher Speed than tier-king Tentacruel without the need to boost.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Raichu's customizable nature gives it a fair amount of room to explore alternative options without much opportunity cost. However, Thunderbolt and Surf should never be dropped, as they are what allow it to perform well in the tier. If using Agility, Hyper Beam is quite desirable for closing out games against Pokemon like Hypno and Kadabra, which may come in to try and stop a sweep. It serves as Raichu's single best option against opposing Electric- and Grass-types, dealing surprisingly high damage to them and enabling it to break through. Seismic Toss is another appealing option, allowing Raichu to fight Grass-types like Tangela and Venusaur and Electric-types like Electabuzz and opposing Raichu. Surf tends to deal more damage to other Pokemon, though, making Seismic Toss a bit more specific in utility. Thunder has a significant enough damage difference to net Raichu near-guaranteed 2HKOs on Persian, Kangaskhan, Tentacruel, and Vaporeon and an OHKO against Dodrio, but the inconsistency makes it difficult to recommend, especially considering Raichu's fragility. Substitute can be used to give Raichu an opportunity to scout and spread paralysis without needing to predict. It has the added benefit of letting Raichu safely fish for critical hits and full paralysis. It also makes Raichu an even better Dugtrio lure, letting it fish for a critical hit from Surf to OHKO it or paralysis from Body Slam without taking massive damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Tangela is one of the few Pokemon in the tier that resists Raichu's Thunderbolt + Surf combination, and, as a result, Raichu can't do much to it. The only way for Raichu to win is through Seismic Toss, but even then, Tangela's Stun Spore will paralyze Raichu and put it into an awkward position. Tangela will usually use Raichu as setup fodder thereafter, picking up Growth boosts or using it to pivot out with Bind. While less common, Venusaur is also a large threat to Raichu's success, resisting everything thrown at it while threatening with Sleep Powder or a 3HKO with Razor Leaf. In addition, it's only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss, which is, unfortunately, Raichu's best bet at trying to win.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Raichu is extremely frail on the physical side, and there are threats in RBY UU that are well equipped to exploit this. Kangaskhan and Dodrio can KO Raichu from well above half HP with Hyper Beam, meaning all Raichu can do is threaten them with Thunder Wave if it's at full HP. Furthermore, Persian can revenge kill Raichu from half HP with Slash if it hasn't set up Agility. On the flip side, Raichu can fight back hard against all of these threats; none of them want to switch into Thunder Wave, Dodrio falls to Thunderbolt if it's taken any amount of damage, and Kangaskhan takes heavy damage from any special hit. As a result, while Raichu is very threatened by these Pokemon, they really don't want to switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite can shrug off Thunder Wave with its own Agility and KO Raichu with Hyper Beam from 68.7% onwards. This can be facilitated through Wrap, which gradually chips Raichu into KO range; at minimum, it takes five Wrap uses for Raichu to be placed in Hyper Beam range. Raichu can't deal much damage to Dragonite at all, with Thunderbolt dealing less than 30%. As a result, Raichu is forced out.</p> <p><strong>Hypno</strong>: Hypno can take Raichu's attacks quite well by virtue of its excellent special bulk. This, combined with Thunder Wave and the power of Psychic, enables it to check Raichu well. However, it can only check Raichu from full HP, as, otherwise, it's very possible for Raichu to break through with critical hits. Alternatively, Raichu can use Hypno as setup fodder for Agility if it has used Rest, especially if brought in on the turn Hypno uses it, but it needs multiple critical hits to break through in this scenario. Furthermore, it risks paralysis and heavy damage in the process.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raichu tends to struggle against opposing Electric-types, as they take mediocre damage from Surf while resisting Thunderbolt. Electabuzz tends to win one-on-one with Seismic Toss while being faster and threatening with paralysis. Opposing Raichu may also be equipped to win against your own depending on the set, with moves such as Seismic Toss and Hyper Beam further complicating matters for the electric rodent.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Raichu can't stomach Dugtrio's Earthquake if it's taken any amount of damage, and Dugtrio's 23.4% critical hit rate makes it an even more decisive matchup. However, if Raichu has set up Agility or if Dugtrio is switching in, Dugtrio has to risk getting hit with Surf, which 2HKOes it. This also means that Dugtrio has a lot of trouble beating Raichu if it's been paralyzed prior to the interaction. Body Slam is also a risk for Dugtrio, potentially paralyzing it and allowing Raichu to take it out if it's taken damage prior.</p>",

      "Agility Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunderbolt and Surf provide Raichu with nigh-unresisted coverage, making it challenging to counter once it's in safely. Thunder Wave gives Raichu ample opportunity to spread paralysis for its teammates, which can be helpful for forcing out faster threats like Persian and Tentacruel. Agility enables Raichu to double its Speed, making it difficult to revenge kill or pin down with Wrap. This is very important, as, in RBY, boosting Speed allows Raichu to ignore the Speed drop from paralysis. However, Body Slam can be used instead to paralyze threats like Dugtrio switching in and beat physically frail Pokemon like Kadabra.</p> <p>Raichu wants to set up Agility to sweep through weakened teams, and it should be kept healthy so Dugtrio cannot KO it after surviving Surf. As such, Raichu does best mid- or late-game. While setting up can be difficult in RBY UU at times, Raichu has a decent amount of freedom to set up Agility, as it can afford to take a hit if Dugtrio is absent or unable to survive Surf. Forcing out Pokemon like Omastar, which can't handle Raichu's coverage, can also allow Raichu to set up. Sleeping Pokemon can be fairly useful for Raichu to set up against; however, bulkier Pokemon like Hypno may be difficult if the sleep was induced by Rest, as Raichu can't KO it before it wakes up.</p> <p>Raichu tends to find points of entry through Wrap pivots like Tentacruel, ensuring safety from physical attacks. However, it can switch into weaker special attackers if necessary, as well as more passive Pokemon using recovery moves. Thanks to its Speed and coverage, it also makes a good revenge killer, especially after an Explosion, which usually softens up a threat for Raichu to consistently threaten the KO. On the flip side, Raichu's Speed can let it switch in on opposing Wrap, though with repeated switches it may take enough chip damage to enter KO range for strong physical attacks. This only gets worse if the Wrap user pivots out to a counter. Ergo, switching into Wrap even a few times severely limits Raichu's ability to take hits and check threats, so this risk should only be taken if heavy-hitting physical attackers like Dugtrio have been accounted for or removed, or if Raichu can reliably threaten to KO the Wrap user. Raichu finds itself on teams that benefit from its ability to check Rock- and Ground-types that threaten teammates like Dodrio and Persian, making them effective lures for said Rock- and Ground-types.</p>"

  "Nidoking": {
    "overview": "<p>One wouldn’t expect Nidoking to struggle so much in RBY UU. With its impeccable coverage, Electric immunity, and well-rounded stats, one would even question why it isn't dominating. Once the opposing team is weakened, Nidoking becomes very threatening, as it hits nearly everything for neutral damage and can be very difficult to switch into. Moreover, it can freely pivot into an incoming Toxic, as well as Electric-type attacks like Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt from Electabuzz and Haunter, giving it some decent defensive utility. With adequate paralysis support from Pokemon like Hypno and careful play, Nidoking can feasibly work.</p> <p>However, Nidoking comes with an egregious problem: its typing. Poison and Ground are among the worst possible defensive types in the game, making it weak to the many Water-, Ice-, Ground-, and Psychic-type attacks in the tier, and its Speed only worsens this situation. Therefore, despite its seemingly powerful offensive presence, it can hardly ever switch in because it struggles with so many metagame staples, namely Tentacruel, Hypno, Dragonite, Gyarados, and Articuno. Nidoking also struggles with damage output at many points, causing it to fail to even OHKO Dragonite with Blizzard. Ergo, on competitive RBY UU teams, Nidoking is often passed over in favor of better Ground-types, such as Dugtrio.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Thunderbolt allows for Nidoking to hit Water- and Flying-types such as Gyarados, Dewgong, and Articuno. Blizzard 2HKOes Aerodactyl, Dragonite, and Dugtrio, blending with Thunderbolt to give it unresisted coverage. Earthquake gives Nidoking very powerful physical STAB damage, allowing it to 2HKO tier-king Tentacruel and Kadabra, as well as OHKOing Haunter and KOing Electabuzz if it's taken even slight damage. Body Slam lets Nidoking scout for potential switch-ins, potentially paralyzing them and turning the tables.</p> <p>Nidoking's movepool makes it quite customizable, and, because Earthquake provides most of its necessary coverage, Thunderbolt is the most replaceable. Rock Slide can be used over Thunderbolt to deal up to 63.7% to Articuno while not sacrificing too much against Gyarados and Dewgong, but Nidoking will always lose to Articuno one-on-one if it can't KO it outright, as it's OHKOed by Blizzard. Alternatively, Submission can let Nidoking 2HKO Raticate, as well as 3HKO Persian and Kangaskhan.</p>"

As a result, it may contain outdated information.</p> <hr /> <p>Clefable succeeds in RBY UU as a strong early-game offensive threat with great unpredictability and versatility, possessing an incredible movepool with Thunder Wave, STAB Body Slam, Thunderbolt, Blizzard, Counter, Sing, and more. With respectable bulk in tow, Clefable will incapacitate many Pokemon in some form before it goes down; this bulk also helps it take Wrap decently well, letting it stay in and punish misses with Thunder Wave in a tight spot. Furthermore, Clefable has coverage for every Pokemon in the tier, letting it fine-tune itself for a team and punish switch-ins if they get paralyzed prior; still, it won't have the right move for every situation at once.</p> <p>However, because of its low Speed, Clefable often finds itself getting easily worn down by wrappers like Tentacruel and Dragonite. Additionally, it is near-effortless to revenge kill with strong attackers that aren't normally even fast enough to revenge kill, such as Hypno, and critical hits don't help. This is compounded by a lack of recovery and resistances, causing it to sometimes struggle as a defensive team piece. Because Clefable provides inconsistent defensive utility and not quite elite offensive pressure, it is often outcompeted by other early-game wallbreakers like Kangaskhan. Regardless of this, Clefable pairs well alongside many Pokemon in the tier—particularly other Normal-types, Kadabra, and Articuno—for its support movepool, which backs its offensive pressure extremely well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Clefable has among the most customizable movesets in the game. Generally, Clefable should always use Body Slam and usually Thunder Wave so it can incapacitate any one foe, but the rest of its moveset is fair game to alter.</p> <p>Counter is the most notable choice, as Clefable can easily switch in on Persian's Slash and force it out with the threat of Thunder Wave, thereby allowing Counter to massively damage the switch-in. This situation can similarly be applied to Body Slam uses from Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Dodrio. Additionally, switching in on a predicted Hyper Beam can allow Counter Clefable to deal massive damage. Counter is easily played around once revealed, but it only needs to succeed once for Clefable to do its job.</p> <p>Mega Kick deals more damage than Body Slam and doesn't require a recharge turn like Hyper Beam, allowing Clefable to 2HKO Tentacruel and Hypno, but the accuracy can lead to Clefable taking extra damage that it can't always afford. Sing is a fair surprise option that lets Clefable compress roles on a team, but repeated misses allow foes to wear it down quickly. Rest lets Clefable attempt to stay healthy throughout a game, and the abundance of Wrap can let it burn sleep turns. However, due to a complete lack of resistances, it is difficult to safely wake up against anything but Wrap, often making Clefable less consistent. Furthermore, a sleeping Clefable is ripe for exploitation from the likes of Tentacruel and Dugtrio. Reflect can be used to take minimal chip damage from Dragonite's Wrap, even PP stalling it when combined with Rest. It can also make Clefable more effective against the powerful Kangaskhan and Dodrio. However, it's ineffective against Pokemon that use Slash, such as Persian and Pinsir, and Tentacruel can 3HKO Clefable with Surf, so it can be difficult to fit into sets. Light Screen lets Thunderbolt Clefable muscle past Articuno, cutting off the monumental power of Articuno's Blizzard.</p> <p>Clefable has a surfeit of additional coverage options that can be situationally justified. Fire Blast 3HKOes Articuno and potentially incapacitates Kangaskhan and Dragonite switch-ins with burns. It can also 2HKO the rare Pinsir, which otherwise has an amazing matchup against Clefable. Thunder or Ice Beam can be used over Thunderbolt and Blizzard, but Thunder doesn't improve Clefable's KO ranges by much and Ice Beam's PP increase fails to make up for its damage output. Submission allows Clefable to 3HKO Persian and is its best option against opposing Clefable, but it has little use outside of this; Dewgong and Kangaskhan are damaged more by Thunderbolt and Blizzard, respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Partial Trapping</strong>: Wrappers like Dragonite, Tentacruel, and Pinsir wear Clefable down, exploiting its vulnerability to sustained offensive pressure, before switching to a Pokemon that can KO it like Kangaskhan. Dragonite is particularly effective, as its Wrap deals up to 5% per turn. If AgiliWrap Dragonite sets up prior to fighting Clefable, Clefable struggles mightily to stop it, as it fails to OHKO with Blizzard and usually has to resort to Thunder Wave. Tentacruel can gradually choke it out with Wrap before KOing it with Surf. However, Clefable's bulk increases the chance of an eventual miss—and taking crippling paralysis in return. On the other hand, Swords Dance or repeated critical hits can drastically quicken the process. While rare, Pinsir has Swords Dance + Bind, which lets it swiftly bring Clefable down and KO it from around 85% with +2 Hyper Beam; it can also use +2 Submission after even less damage. The similarly rare Moltres chips Clefable down quickly with Fire Spin while dealing massive damage with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Faster Sleepers</strong>: Clefable is slow and used early-game, so it often risks taking sleep. Common faster Pokemon like Venusaur, Haunter, and Hypnosis Hypno often force it to sacrifice itself or switch out. Clefable can't consistently trade with them either; Venusaur is not likely to be 2HKOed by Blizzard, Haunter is only remotely scared by Psychic, and Hypno has enough bulk and special attacking prowess to make the matchup inconsistent at best.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Articuno outspeeds and 3HKOes Clefable with its nuclear Blizzard, while Clefable needs Fire Blast or Light Screen to stand a realistic chance in a flat one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Omastar switches into Blizzard Clefable, while Golem handles Thunderbolt variants, and both deal heavy damage with STAB moves. While Aerodactyl is Rock-type and shrugs off Clefable without either move, it loses to Blizzard and Thunderbolt alike, making it a non-issue for most Clefable sets. All Rock-types are excellent Hyper Beam absorbers as well.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Vaporeon and Dewgong outspeed Clefable and threaten it with 3HKOs. However, both take massive damage from Thunderbolt in the process, and they become dicey answers if paralyzed. Notably, Dewgong is 3HKOed by Clefable's Thunderbolt itself, and Hyper Beam Clefable can KO Vaporeon after two Thunderbolt uses first. Poliwrath is faster and can put Clefable to sleep with Hypnosis; it also possesses Submission to 2HKO Clefable.</p> <p><strong>Counter Users</strong>: Because Clefable excels when it's using its Normal-type STAB moves, it can take mortal damage from the rare Counter. Pokemon such as Poliwrath, opposing Clefable, Kangaskhan, and Hypno are sometimes seen using the move. A notable way to trap Clefable is by switching one of these Pokemon in on Hyper Beam and using Counter as Clefable recharges.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set lets Clefable succeed as a strong early-game attacker, providing ample paralysis support while trading with common early-game Psychic-types like Kadabra and Hypno. Because of Clefable's bulk and Thunder Wave, it will typically incapacitate foes in a one-on-one fight. Staying in against repeated Wrap uses before crippling the opposing Pokemon with Thunder Wave is a viable—albeit risky—strategy, as its physical bulk makes it take minimal chip damage. STAB Body Slam deals sizable damage and threatens to paralyze any would-be switch-in. Hyper Beam is very powerful, KOing Pokemon like Tentacruel, Electabuzz, Persian, and even Hypno from around half HP; a critical hit Body Slam prior can often put these Pokemon in range for Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Clefable's special coverage move should be chosen based on what the team is lacking. Thunderbolt covers Water-types, 3HKOing Poliwrath, Dewgong, and Omastar as well as 2HKOing Gyarados. Blizzard 2HKOes Dodrio, Dragonite, Tangela, and Golem; it is also Clefable's best option for Kangaskhan and Venusaur. Psychic is the best against Haunter, 3HKOing it, though Special drops can improve this. Additionally, it can 3HKO Tentacruel with a Special drop, though Thunderbolt is comparably effective against it.</p> <p>Clefable can be a difficult Pokemon to bring in, primarily due to its low Speed causing it to get worn down quickly. It's best brought in through Wrap or double switching on Kadabra or Electabuzz, common sights for their Speed and special offense; Kadabra is a particularly big target, as Clefable 2HKOes it with Body Slam. Because they lack the firepower to break past Clefable and it threatens them with paralysis in return, it's easy for Clefable to gain momentum. These Pokemon can be easily drawn in through early-game use of Tentacruel; for instance, leading with Wrap Tentacruel regularly draws Kadabra in right away and gives Clefable a free switch. Clefable can heavily punish Pokemon by predicting Rest—particularly from Tentacruel and Hypno—as it can easily 3HKO both with Body Slam twice followed by Hyper Beam. In respect to Hypno, Clefable is very capable of switching in via Wrap pivoting and denting it enough to the point that it can be traded with. Kadabra, Tentacruel, and, to a lesser extent, Electabuzz are all extremely common early-game Pokemon that can be regularly lured in through your own Kadabra, Tentacruel, or Hypno; Kadabra and Hypno can force Tentacruel to use Rest through paralysis and super effective damage, while Hypno is forced in through prolonged mirror matches. Dugtrio is also a good opportunity for Clefable to come in, as it fails to 3HKO without critical hits and gets threatened with Body Slam paralysis or severe damage from Blizzard. Dugtrio regularly switches in on predicted Thunder Wave uses, so consider double switching to Clefable from a damaged Kadabra, Electabuzz, Dragonite, or Hypno.</p> <p>Clefable can be used as a lead, as it forces Tentacruel to pivot with Wrap by the threat of Thunder Wave, threatens non-Hypnosis Hypno, and shrugs off Kadabra's Thunder Wave. In the event the opponent is using a slower team, such as one featuring Tangela or multiple bulky Water-types like Omastar, lead Kadabra may even switch out. However, Clefable can often be more threatening outside of the lead slot because of its ability to pummel paralyzed Pokemon, and Pokemon like Tentacruel, Electabuzz, and Kadabra often perform more favorably as leads. Because of Clefable's low Speed, paralysis inducers such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, and the omnipresent Hypno are excellent partners for making it a late-game threat. They also become much more threatening once Clefable has beaten or traded with an opposing Psychic-type. Clefable also strongly benefits special attackers like Articuno, as it normally dents specially bulky Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Kadabra; Articuno can finish them off while taking out physically bulky Pokemon like Kangaskhan. Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Dragonite appreciate Clefable's paralysis support, which makes up for their lower Speed, while being able to wallbreak alongside it. Thunderbolt Clefable is also helpful for Dragonite in particular, as it hits the Water-types that frequently run Blizzard.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Generally, Dugtrio doesn't need any moves outside of its main set. Body Slam can be nice to paralyze checks such as the relatively uncommon Aerodactyl, but the only Pokemon you will commonly see that Dugtrio doesn't naturally outspeed is opposing Dugtrio. Even worse, Body Slam is only useful against opposing Dugtrio on the switch, as either Dugtrio can 2HKO the other with Earthquake one-on-one. Another severe downside of using Body Slam is its damage output in comparison to Slash: whereas Slash can do 30% to Gyarados, Body Slam does half that. Where Slash lets Dugtrio 4HKO Tangela and potentially catch it at half health while it switches in, Body Slam can't even reliably 6HKO Tangela. Sand Attack could be used to pray for misses in desperate scenarios, like when Dodrio is about to set up and run over your team or Dugtrio is your last Pokemon left and needs to land multiple critical hits. It can also stop Dragonite from setting up Agility and sweeping through your team with Wrap, but it's less reliable than Toxic and has its effect nullified by switching. It can technically be used to severely reduce Tentacruel's Wrap accuracy, though the only time Dugtrio should be facing Tentacruel is if it is in Earthquake KO range anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Dugtrio relies heavily on its Speed to stop foes from capitalizing on its weak defenses, which makes paralysis so deadly for it. Dugtrio is immune to Thunder Wave, but Stun Spore—used commonly by Tangela and the rare Venomoth—and Body Slam—from attackers like Kangaskhan, Gyarados, and opposing Dugtrio—can cripple Dugtrio for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attacks</strong>: In general, Dugtrio is unable to take more than one attack without fainting, so any strong attack—such as Kangaskhan's Body Slam and Hypno or Kadabra's Psychic—hitting it should enable any other Pokemon to pick it off. Even worse, many common special attacks, such as Articuno's Blizzard and Surf from Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar, are super effective and will OHKO Dugtrio.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types are most teams' main defensive answers to Dugtrio, as they can switch into its Earthquake and threaten it out with heavy damage, if not an outright OHKO. Dragonite is best at dealing with Dugtrio, as the threat Dragonite poses with Agility and Wrap is so significant that Dugtrio often has to stay in and use Toxic, which can come at the cost of Dugtrio taking a Blizzard and being put at 20% health or lower. Gyarados is similar in its ability to answer Dugtrio, and while it lacks the threat of Agility + Wrap to keep Dugtrio from switching out, it is much harder for Dugtrio's teammates to force out due to its superior defensive typing. Aerodactyl can switch in on Dugtrio's Earthquake with impunity and 2HKO it, but it struggles to switch in on Rock Slide. Dodrio and Articuno are the last two common Flying-types that teams use to check Dugtrio. While they are significantly frailer than Dragonite and Gyarados, respectively 3HKOed and 2HKOed by Rock Slide, they can both OHKO Dugtrio with their STAB attacks and threaten to run through its team after an Agility boost.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Poliwrath, and the rare Dewgong can take Earthquake multiple times while KOing Dugtrio with their STAB Surf and using Rest to remain healthy and answer Dugtrio over the course of a match. However, Dugtrio's critical hit rate can allow it to bypass these answers if they are below 75% health, and Dewgong can't repeatedly switch into Rock Slide without being forced to use Rest.</p> <p><strong>Tangela and Venusaur</strong>: Tangela is one of the best Dugtrio answers in RBY UU, taking almost no damage from Earthquake and threatening Dugtrio in return with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore. Tangela can also heal off any chip damage it sustains on the way in with Mega Drain, and it can potentially use Dugtrio as an opportunity to begin accumulating boosts with Growth. Venusaur is similar in this regard, coming in on Earthquake and threatening to put Dugtrio or a teammate to sleep with Sleep Powder or OHKO Dugtrio with Razor Leaf. However, Venusaur is worse at checking Dugtrio than Tangela due to its worse bulk and Ground neutrality.</p> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: If Kangaskhan is healthy, it can switch into Dugtrio's Earthquake and threaten to cripple or KO Dugtrio with its STAB Body Slam or Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Persian and Hypno</strong>: While they can't switch in, Hypno and Persian can win the one-on-one matchup with Dugtrio from full health if it doesn't land a critical hit.</p>",

      "Dugtrio": {
        "description": "<hr /> <h4>Outdated Analysis</h4> <h4>Overview</h4> <p>Dugtrio succeeds as RBY UU’s most influential revenge killer and sweeper. Dugtrio's fantastic speed tier, perfect coverage, and Thunder Wave immunity give it the perfect combination of traits to fulfill these roles extremely effectively. Regardless of its health, Dugtrio can very easily close games with its powerful STAB Earthquake, especially considering it boasts an enormous 23.44% critical hit rate. As such, keeping Pokemon out of range of Dugtrio is a key aspect of mastering RBY UU; even tier king Tentacruel must be cautious, as it can drop to an Earthquake as early as 79.3%. This offensive prowess forces the majority of competitive teams to include several checks to it.</p> <p>While Dugtrio is incredibly strong, it is not without its flaws. While its typing provides it with good utility, it also opens it up to numerous weaknesses to common attacks such as Surf, Blizzard, and Razor Leaf. This, combined with its extreme frailty, causes it to crumble when confronted with any sort of offensive pressure. In addition to this, several Pokemon are either immune or resistant to its Earthquake, most notably Dragonite, Gyarados, Aerodactyl, and Tangela. This culminates into Dugtrio having a much more polarized matchup spread than other notable revenge killers, such as Persian or Kadabra. Regardless, Dugtrio remains one of the common and potent threats in the tier for which every team must prepare.</p>"

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>STAB Earthquake is excellent given Tentacruel's prominence, both 2HKOing it and supporting your own Tentacruel by 2HKOing all of its counters save Persian. Many of these targets can be put in KO range with a small amount of chip damage or a critical hit. Dugtrio also outspeeds all threats to Tentacruel besides opposing Dugtrio, which lets it worry less about its frailty. Earthquake's high power combined with Dugtrio's high critical hit chance makes Dugtrio an effective wallbreaker and general attacker. Through Rock Slide, Dugtrio can hit all Flying-types for super effective damage, further limiting how often the opponent can let Dugtrio come on the field before they start losing Pokemon. The next move is commonly Slash, which stops Tangela from completely walling Dugtrio and can act as a safe midground option to avoid reading whether opponents will switch to a Flying-type or not. Substitute is another option for Dugtrio's third move to make it an even more effective late-game sweeper. Dugtrio can set up a Substitute while the opponent switches to sacrifice a team member at low health, and it can then close out the game against a weakened team that can't break the Substitute and force Dugtrio out. The last moveslot is dedicated to Toxic, as it prevents Dragonite from freely coming in on Earthquake and setting up Agility safely.</p> <p>Dugtrio acts as a late-game sweeper and a potent offensive threat. Using Dugtrio optimally is a delicate balancing act of making the most of its limited opportunities to come onto the field while also keeping it as healthy as possible, a balance that often separates novice players from veterans. Partial-trapping moves—most commonly Wrap—are one of the primary ways Dugtrio can be brought onto the field safely, since they both provide the chip damage needed to bring targets into OHKO range and allow Dugtrio to switch in while the opposing Pokemon is unable to attack. Therefore, Wrap users such as Dragonite and especially Tentacruel make for excellent Dugtrio partners. Tentacruel is the best Dugtrio partner in the game; not only does it provide Wrap support and benefit from Dugtrio KOing primary answers to it after minor chip damage, such as opposing Tentacruel, Kadabra, Electabuzz, and Raichu, but it takes very little damage from Blizzard and Surf aimed at Dugtrio. The opponent's Tentacruel using Wrap is another common way Dugtrio can get onto the battlefield safely, as Dugtrio takes relatively little chip damage from Wrap while outspeeding and KOing the opposing Tentacruel if it is sufficiently weakened. A teammate using Explosion or fainting is another common entrance point for Dugtrio, as its high Speed and damage output allow it to act as an effective revenge killer. Other good opportunities for Dugtrio to enter the battlefield include sleeping Pokemon, a predicted switch, a recovery move that doesn't let the foe escape Dugtrio's KO range, and Electric-type moves such as Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt. Frequently, Dugtrio will be able to clean up teams that have been weakened to the point where it can OHKO every remaining Pokemon; this is a relatively common win condition in RBY UU that should always be kept in mind over the course of the game. Learning to capitalize on opportunities to set up this endgame while simultaneously hindering an opponent carrying Dugtrio from doing the same is an important skill for UU players to learn.</p>"

As a result, it may contain outdated information.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Persian can utilize Body Slam over Toxic to assist teams poor at distributing paralysis. However, its damage is a far cry from Slash or Hyper Beam, relying heavily on Persian's innately high critical hit rate. However, Thunderbolt can be removed instead at the price of coverage should a team not require either of them. Screech can be used alongside Hyper Beam to KO sooner than Slash + Hyper Beam, though the foe can switch out to try and force a recharge, thus leaving Persian at risk of being paralyzed or even KOed. As a result, this option is very risky. Bubble Beam lets Persian fight Golem, and the Speed drop can allow it to knock out Dugtrio, but it doesn't help in many other matchups.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Haunter is the only viable RBY UU Pokemon that's immune to Slash, which makes it an excellent counter to Persian, preventing it from making any progress until Haunter is KOed. As such, it's best to keep Persian hidden until Haunter has been removed. Persian's Thunderbolt is only a possible 6HKO, while Haunter can 4HKO using its own Thunderbolt or threaten sleep from Hypnosis. So long as Haunter is active, focus on KOing it or baiting it into exploding.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis Inducers</strong>: Electabuzz, Kadabra, and Raichu all threaten to end Persian's run using Thunder Wave, which makes it noticeably less threatening overall. However, should they be in KO range, Persian is capable of shutting them down before they get the chance to do so. As a result, these are only checks if they are at full HP. Hypno is also notable for being among the only paralysis inducers not 2HKOed by Slash, though Hyper Beam can KO it from half health, and Persian is excellent at exploiting it as it uses Rest. Tangela can utilize Mega Drain to save itself from a Slash 3HKO and paralyze Persian with Stun Spore. Dragonite is also notable for its bulk, easily taking a Slash and paralyzing Persian in return. While Persian can use Toxic to outdamage Wrap from Dragonite, it's still problematic for the cat due to its significant damage aside from Wrap.</p> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Kangaskhan 2HKOes Persian with Body Slam + Hyper Beam. If Kangaskhan is already in a tight spot, such as in 2HKO range from Slash, it can still use Hyper Beam to deal at least 65% damage to Persian, putting it in range for Dugtrio to revenge kill it. In addition, Kangaskhan has access to Counter, which allows it to situationally hit Persian or a switch-in for massive damage. This makes it a fair absorber of Hyper Beam as well; the subsequent Counter outright OHKOes Persian if it hits a high damage roll.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Articuno can use Agility to outspeed Persian and 2HKO it with its nuclear Blizzard. This makes it a fine check. In addition, it's only 3HKOed by Persian's Slash 57.2% of the time, allowing the opponent to take risks if needed. However, a critical hit from Thunderbolt puts Articuno in range of Hyper Beam. Furthermore, consecutive critical hits from Thunderbolt can 2HKO it should Hyper Beam not be used.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Omastar resists Persian's Slash and can 2HKO it in return with Hydro Pump. Persian can try using Thunderbolt, but it's only a 4HKO, so a critical hit is needed to outdamage Rest's healing. Alternatively, Poliwrath makes a decent check, coming in on Slash to use STAB Submission and put Persian in KO range of a subsequent attack. However, Persian's Slash is still a very favorable 3HKO, so Poliwrath isn’t necessarily consistent.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: If Persian lacks Bubble Beam, Golem stonewalls it while possessing a very favorable 2HKO with Earthquake. Furthermore, Golem is an excellent counter to Hyper Beam sets, being able to comfortably absorb the hit and deal significant damage in return. Plus, it doesn't fear Bubble Beam from full health unless Persian lands a critical hit. However, Golem can't necessarily switch in on Persian if its moveset hasn't been revealed, as it risks losing half its health from Bubble Beam.</p>",

      "Persian": {
        "description": "<hr /> <h4>Overview</h4> <p>Persian's Speed and access to STAB Slash help make it a premier revenge killer and late-game sweeper in RBY UU. Outrunning every relevant Pokemon except Dugtrio, Persian can almost always make use of its high damage output from Slash. In addition, this high Speed makes Persian effective against Wrap users, most notably Tentacruel, allowing it to switch in and threaten to damage them with Slash or cripple them with Toxic. Persian will usually KO at least one Pokemon during a game thanks to the sheer power of Slash. Persian's bulk is also appealing, surpassing that of other fast threats like Kadabra and Dugtrio, allowing it to function much more effectively late-game. This bulk also makes it more viable to switch in on moves like Body Slam, which can't paralyze it thanks to Persian being Normal-type. All things considered, Persian is a UU staple.</p> <p>However, Persian's attacking stats are a bit middling, making Slash its main form of damage. To make matters worse, Persian is particularly lacking in physical coverage, with only Hyper Beam available as a second viable option. As a result, Persian relies on its middling special movepool to cover for Pokemon that resist Normal-type moves, making it relatively easy for Pokemon like Haunter to come in and threaten it. Persian is also crippled by paralysis in a big way, as it relies heavily on its Speed to sweep and threaten Wrap users, so it can be forced out by paralysis inducers if it can't KO them first.</p>"

      "Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Slash is the mandatory backbone of Persian's damage output, sporting a 99.6% critical hit rate. Thunderbolt allows Persian to hit bulky Water-types—especially Gyarados—for better damage with a paralysis chance as a bonus. Toxic most notably allows Persian to poison Dragonite using Agility, making a Dragonite Wrap sweep near impossible; however, Dragonite's offensive presence outside of this remains significant. Alternatively, Hyper Beam can be used over Toxic for a slight boost in power, which can be crucial when taking down Pokemon like Electabuzz and Kadabra, which threaten it with paralysis. The KO ranges for Hyper Beam aren't much larger than Slash, though, so it should only be used if you want Persian to be a sweeper.</p> <p>Persian's playstyle is fairly straightforward; it is a cleaner that revenge kills when possible. Generally, Persian should be used once Pokemon that can paralyze it or resist Slash have either been KOed or put into KO range. Persian can often switch into weakened Tentacruel attempting to use Wrap, as Persian forces it out by the threat of a KO. Persian's other likely point of entry is your own Tentacruel's Wrap, which gives Persian an excellent shot at KOing foes outright with little to no opposition. Persian is also excellent at coming in on Pokemon using Rest, 3HKOing even bulkier threats like Vaporeon and Hypno.</p>"

  "Golduck": {
    "overview": "<p>Golduck is the fastest Amnesia user in RBY UU, which gives it the potential to be a fairly terrifying sweeper given the chance. An Amnesia-boosted Golduck is not to be taken lightly: a +2 Blizzard OHKOes Dodrio, as well as Tangela 41% of the time. +2 Blizzard, along with Hydro Pump, will also 2HKO most neutral targets, though there are notable exceptions such as Articuno and Hypno. Amnesia also assists Golduck defensively, making it very difficult for conventional Water-types to KO and allowing it to PP stall them using Rest. Golduck's Speed is also fairly decent—tying it with Articuno and Pinsir—which lets it get the jump on Dragonite before it can set up Agility.</p> <p>However, Golduck has a myriad of issues that prevent it from seeing play. The main problem is that its good coverage falls flat in RBY UU due to the many bulky Water-types such as Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Dewgong, all of which stonewall Golduck. Furthermore, Tentacruel makes actually getting mileage out of Golduck a nightmare, outspeeding it to delay its setup and chip it down with Wrap until it's placed in KO range. Golduck is fairly vulnerable to physical attackers like Kangaskhan that love to punish its Rest, blowing past it with their STAB moves. As a result, while Golduck works on paper, it flounders in practice. Poliwrath is a far superior pick as an Amnesia user, possessing a wider movepool and better overall stats.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Amnesia": {
        "description": "<p>Amnesia enables Golduck to function as an offensive and defensive Pokemon, letting it shore up its special bulk to wall Water-types while becoming a very threatening sweeper should its checks be removed. The combination of Hydro Pump and Blizzard is only resisted by opposing Water-types and therefore serves as its best coverage. Hydro Pump will OHKO Dugtrio without a boost, and, at +2, it will OHKO Persian and Kangaskhan. Finally, Rest allows Golduck to remain healthy, continue picking up Amnesia boosts, and remove any paralysis it sustains in the process.</p> <p>Golduck has a few alternative options, though fitting them into its moveset is very difficult. Body Slam allows Golduck to make use of its nice Attack stat, chipping foes with poor Defense like Kadabra while spreading paralysis. Should a more defensive approach be desired, Ice Beam is a suitable alternative to Blizzard for trying to freeze an opponent's Water-type, like Vaporeon, with freeze having an 81.98% chance of occurring if all of Ice Beam's PP is used. Some think to use Confusion for fighting Tentacruel, but even at +2, it only has a 59.1% chance to 3HKO and is largely useless outside of this.</p>"

  "Arcanine": {
    "overview": "<p>Arcanine may be known as the Legendary Pokemon in-game, but in reality, it is largely underwhelming due to its abysmal Fire typing. RBY UU is chock full of bulky Water-types like Omastar and Vaporeon that can switch in and easily suppress Fire-type Pokemon. Tentacruel gets a special mention for being able to outspeed these Fire-types and either deal considerable damage with Surf, or predict a switch and pivot with Wrap. Even among Fire-types, however, it’s tough to justify using Arcanine over Moltres due to its inferior Special stat. Because of these flaws, Arcanine is not recommended for use on competitive RBY UU teams, and thus rarely sees play.</p> <p>While Arcanine lacks a real niche in the UU metagame, it has a few somewhat desirable traits. Its 95 base Speed and access to Agility lets Arcanine outpace some other Agility users, like Articuno and Dragonite, and it possesses a strong Body Slam to deter switch-ins. This sounds a lot like a weaker Dodrio at first, but what sets Arcanine apart is a powerful STAB Fire Blast and its 30% burn rate, not only threatening the likes of Kangaskhan and Persian, but also letting it deal considerable mixed damage.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Agility is a great boon to Arcanine due its removal of paralysis’s Speed debuff on top of providing a boost that lets it outpace even a boosted Articuno. The set’s idea is to set up an Agility and then take advantage of Arcanine’s acceptable mixed attacking power while potentially spreading status along the way. Body Slam threatens to paralyze non-Normal-types that would switch in on it and, along with Hyper Beam, makes use of Arcanine’s impressive base 110 Attack. These two moves make a nice one-two punch; if Dugtrio or Kadabra switched in on a Body Slam, then Hyper Beam can dispose of them on the following turn and, therefore, not require a recharge turn. Rounding out the set is STAB Fire Blast, which hits reasonably hard and has a relatively high chance of burning the opponent on hit, which can totally ruin an opposing Tentacruel, Dugtrio, or Kangaskhan.</p> <p>Arcanine is best mid- or late-game when it can outrun and thus sweep teams, but absolutely requires a team that can scout out and remove Water-types; examples of potential teammates include Venusaur and Electabuzz. Switching Arcanine in as a Pokemon like Hypno uses Rest is a great way to get a free Agility off. Overall, though, it is a very difficult Pokemon to use, and is just not very good in general.</p>"

  "Poliwrath": {
    "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. Poliwrath is generally considered less viable in the current metagame, but its most up to date moveset is the following.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Poliwrath has a genuinely massive movepool consisting of many interesting niche options. Psychic is somewhat useful on either set, as only Hypno and Kadabra resist it. It also happens to be Poliwrath’s strongest option against opposing Poliwrath and the rare Venomoth. However, Poliwrath’s relatively low Special stat makes the move underwhelming, even if it hits the target for super effective damage; Tentacruel is only 4HKOed. Surf can be used on the bulky sleeper set but suffers from the same problems as Psychic. The move fails to OHKO Dugtrio and is outclassed by Earthquake when hitting neutral targets like Hypno and Kadabra. It is mainly useful for hitting Persian and Kangaskhan, but Hydro Pump and Submission are typically stronger though less reliable options. Hyper Beam is a strong option for finishing off neutral targets, especially those with a low Defense stat. It is Poliwrath’s strongest move against Hypno, Kadabra, Articuno, Gyarados, and Vaporeon. Seismic Toss gives Poliwrath a consistent option for damage against every Pokemon, scoring a 4HKO or better against every major threat, aside from Vaporeon and Kangaskhan. It is seldom the strongest option for any Pokemon, but it reliably hits anything that could switch in. Counter is an interesting option for Persian, Kangaskhan, Vaporeon, and Omastar,which are quite likely to use a Normal-type move when facing Poliwrath, but it's difficult to fit into conventional sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Hypno and Kadabra</strong>: Hypno and Kadabra can easily 2HKO Poliwrath with Psychic. Aside from Hypnosis and Amnesia-boosted attacks, Poliwrath can only 4HKO or attempt to freeze Hypno. While Kadabra is much easier to KO, it outspeeds Poliwrath, which makes Poliwrath largely unable to threaten it. Kadabra’s high critical hit rate is also frightening for Poliwrath, as a critical hit Psychic will always OHKO, even after Amnesia boosts.</p> <p><strong>Gyarados</strong>: Unboosted Poliwrath lacks any tools to meaningfully threaten Gyarados outside of Hypnosis. Gyarados, meanwhile, outspeeds Poliwrath and will 2HKO it with Thunderbolt about one third of the time. Gyarados can even come in for free if it can correctly predict Earthquake. Additionally, Gyarados's impressive Attack allows it to pressure Poliwrath even after Amnesia.</p> <p><strong>Venusaur</strong>: Venusaur outspeeds Poliwrath and can deal massive damage with Razor Leaf. Thanks to the move's near-guaranteed critical hit, it will virtually always 2HKO Poliwrath even if it has used Amnesia. Additionally, Venusaur has a faster and more accurate sleep move than Poliwrath, giving it ample ability to pressure Poliwrath even at full health. Poliwrath can threaten Venusaur with a 3HKO from Blizzard, however.</p> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Users</strong>: Poliwrath's mediocre Special and Water typing leave it highly susceptible to Thunderbolt users. Electabuzz, Raichu, and Electrode are guaranteed to 2HKO Poliwrath and have high critical hit rates. Weaker and less common Thunderbolt users like Gyarados, Dragonite, Persian, Clefable, and Raticate also can deal pretty hefty damage to Poliwrath.</p> <p><strong>Dodrio</strong>: Dodrio's powerful Drill Peck is extremely likely to 2HKO Poliwrath. While Dodrio does fear Blizzard, it can potentially come in on Earthquake or Body Slam and still take out Poliwrath before Blizzard can KO it. Additionally, Dodrio can punish Rest very harshly, potentially setting up with Agility on top of getting the KO.</p> <p><strong>Partial-trapping Moves</strong>: Because Poliwrath has many exploitable weaknesses and is relatively slow, it is not overly difficult to whittle down with Wrap or Bind and pivot to a strong attacker that can finish it off. While Poliwrath has the potential to 2HKO all notable partial-trappers, Tentacruel, Dragonite, and Pinsir are still frequently used to handle Poliwrath. Additionally, if Dragonite hasn't sustained any damage, it is guaranteed to survive Blizzard, meaning it can set up with Agility unless Poliwrath happens to carry Toxic or land Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Water-type Pokemon, most notably Vaporeon, take little damage from all of Poliwrath's moves. Dewgong functions similarly, but is quite weak to Submission. Bulky Water-type Pokemon can't do too much in return outside of paralysis from Body Slam, however. Interestingly, Poliwrath is actually a solid check to itself once Sleep Clause is in effect, as no move aside from Psychic can 3HKO it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Poliwrath": {
        "description": "<hr /> <h4>Outdated Analysis</h4> <h4>Overview</h4> <p>Poliwrath has very steep competition as one of many significant Water-type Pokemon in RBY UU. It does not have the speed of Tentacruel, the bulk of Vaporeon, the typing of Omastar, or the powerful STAB Ice-type moves of Dewgong. What Poliwrath does have, though, is one of the most diverse and interesting movepools of any Pokemon in the tier. For starters, it's the only legal fully evolved Water-type Pokemon with a sleep-inducing move, that being Hypnosis. While Hypnosis has underwhelming accuracy, it is a unique tool that threatens slower foes such as Hypno and deters quicker foes such as Tentacruel from switching in. Offensively, Poliwrath has options such as Body Slam, Earthquake, Submission, and Psychic on top of the staples Surf and Blizzard. While it can’t run all of these moves, Poliwrath can be tricky to play around and require scouting. To make it even more dynamic, Poliwrath also has Amnesia as a niche option that improves its offensive prowess and longevity. On top of all these options, Poliwrath can still serve as a traditional bulky Water-type Pokemon, being a soft check to Articuno and physical attackers like Dugtrio.</p> <p>Despite its impressive advantages, Poliwrath is just short of truly being a staple in RBY UU. The most obvious weakness is its typing; while having a powered-up Submission and resisting Rock Slide are good traits, being weak to Psychic and Flying far outweighs the positives. Hypno and Kadabra are incredibly common and enormously threatening, giving Poliwrath a major disadvantage not faced by other slow Water-type Pokemon. While Dodrio is less common, it too can easily knock out Poliwrath. Aside from this, Poliwrath has truly mediocre stats, lacking even one base stat with three digits. Physically, Poliwrath shines a little bit, as it has marginally more bulk than Vaporeon and Dewgong and hits as hard as Articuno. However, it is still outdone defensively by Omastar and offensively by most dedicated physical attackers. Specially, Poliwrath is very exploitable, being less bulky than even Dewgong by a fairly large margin. Its offensive options are similarly underwhelming; notably, Poliwrath’s Blizzard will always fail to OHKO Dragonite without a critical hit, meaning it can't reliably prevent AgiliWrap like other Water-type Pokemon. Poliwrath is a niche option with several unfortunate shortcomings, fitting best on teams that need a bulky Water-type Pokemon and a sleeper in one Pokemon.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Sleeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hypnosis is Poliwrath’s biggest selling point over conventional Water-type Pokemon. The move can be used in a number of ways to get an advantage, especially early-game. If Poliwrath can get in against the slower Hypno, it's usually free to induce sleep. This can be accomplished by switching in as Hypno wakes up from Rest, or by using a Pokemon like Kadabra or Electabuzz to bait it in. Poliwrath also happens to be faster than Vaporeon and Omastar while Speed tying with Dewgong, meaning it can easily threaten them with Hypnosis as well. Unlike Hypno, these Pokemon struggle to punish Poliwrath if it misses. While it is typically used early-game, Hypnosis is a decent tool throughout the entire match, as it gives Poliwrath an option to stymie dangerous sweepers like Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Articuno. Blizzard hits many key targets in the metagame for respectable damage. Blizzard 2HKOes Dugtrio, Dragonite, and Aerodactyl and 3HKOes Tangela and Venusaur. The damage on Dragonite is especially important, as Poliwrath has limited tools to stop AgiliWrap, especially if it has already hit something with Hypnosis. Poliwrath will typically make use of a physical move, as its decent Attack allows it to deal solid damage to Water-type Pokemon, especially Tentacruel and Omastar. Earthquake is a common choice because it can 2HKO Tentacruel over half the time. Tentacruel is fairly hesitant to engage with Poliwrath, as Earthquake can deal immense damage on the switch or if Wrap misses. Earthquake is also notable for 2HKOing Haunter, Electabuzz, and Raichu and almost certainly 3HKOing Omastar.</p> <p>Poliwrath’s final moveslot is usually dedicated to additional coverage or Rest. Body Slam is much weaker than Earthquake, but the chance for paralysis is very helpful for stymieing partial-trappers like Dragonite and offensive checks like Gyarados, Kadabra, and Electric-type Pokemon. Submission is another strong option that applies a lot of pressure to Normal-type Pokemon while also giving Poliwrath more options for Rock- and Ice-type Pokemon. Submission always 2HKOes Persian and can 2HKO Kangaskhan, Clefable, and Dewgong. Despite these advantages, Submission is not an overly common choice due to its low accuracy and dreadful recoil, which limit a Pokemon that is already not very bulky. Hydro Pump is Poliwrath’s strongest move against neutral targets like Hypno. The move is guaranteed to OHKO Dugtrio and Golem. Additionally, Hydro Pump 4HKOes Hypno and is Poliwrath's best option for hitting Kangaskhan and Persian after Submission. Lastly, Rest helps extend Poliwrath’s usefulness throughout the game. The move is most useful when Poliwrath is expected to take a more defensive role, such as checking Dugtrio or Articuno. However, Poliwrath’s numerous weaknesses leave it very vulnerable while it is asleep.</p> <p>Poliwrath is best suited for teams that appreciate the offensive advantages of sleep and the defensive advantages of a bulky Water-type Pokemon. Because of its somewhat quick Hypnosis, Pokemon that can bait in Hypno, Tangela, and bulky Water-type Pokemon tend to be good partners. These include Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Kangaskhan. Wrappers like Tentacruel and Dragonite are also helpful for pivoting so Poliwrath can get in more safely. Poliwrath's ability to soft check Articuno and physical attackers like Dugtrio and Kangaskhan means it works quite well with Flying-, Ground-, and Electric-type Pokemon. Flying-type Pokemon are additionally good partners thanks to Poliwrath's resistance to Rock. This means Poliwrath can get in rather safely against Dugtrio if it needs to. Due to its Psychic weakness, Poliwrath typically requires the support of multiple Psychic-type Pokemon, making both Hypno and Kadabra standard partners. Pokemon like Tangela, Dragonite, Dugtrio, and Golem are also good for patching up weak spots that Poliwrath might bring to a team. Agility sweepers like Articuno, Dodrio, and Dragonite appreciate Hypnosis incapacitating a key Pokemon or providing them with an opportunity to set up.</p>"

      "Amnesia": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>After Hypnosis, Amnesia is the next most interesting option available to Poliwrath. Successfully setting up with Amnesia is fairly difficult in RBY UU, primarily due to the abundant use of Wrap. While Poliwrath doesn’t suffer a ton of damage from Wrap, it is not uncommon for a Pokemon such as Tentacruel to switch in as Poliwrath first uses Amnesia, use Wrap to chip it, and pivot out to something that can pick Poliwrath off. This issue is worsened by the fact that Amnesia does nothing for Poliwrath’s weakness to Drill Peck, meaning Dodrio can always knock out Poliwrath once its health drops below 50%. Additionally, Poliwrath competes with the already uncommon Golduck in this role, which has superior typing and Speed for an easier time when setting up. However, Amnesia still demands a lot of respect to deal with, meaning that it can drive very predictable switches that can be exploited. For example, if the opponent relies on Tentacruel to pressure Amnesia Poliwrath, mixing in Hypnosis or Earthquake can harshly punish the switch-in.</p> <p>If the opponent lacks strong options to finish off a weakened Poliwrath, like Kadabra or Dodrio, Amnesia becomes a lot more practical. Even if Wrap is still on the table, Poliwrath’s above-average physical bulk enables it to stomach a few hits as it waits for misses, during which it can boost, attack, or heal with Rest. If Wrap isn’t present, Poliwrath really only fears critical and being frozen, meaning it can set up in front of a surprisingly large number of Pokemon, most notably Articuno and bulky Water-type Pokemon. Surf is generally the special move of choice due to STAB and its high PP. At +4 Special, Surf will 2HKO every neutral target in the tier. At +6, Surf can 3HKO even the mighty Vaporeon, meaning nothing can Rest stall Poliwrath. Blizzard is often used alongside Surf for perfect coverage against everything but Water-type Pokemon. It also allows Poliwrath to threaten Dragonite, Venusaur, and Tangela without boosting. Earthquake and Hypnosis can alternatively be used to punish common switch-ins to Amnesia Poliwrath, most notably Tentacruel. Hypnosis can also potentially net Poliwrath a free turn to set up, which can be crucial for extra damage or bulk.</p> <p>Amnesia Poliwrath requires a lot of support to function properly, as a number of things can go wrong. Dodrio and Venusaur are entirely unfazed by Poliwrath’s boosting and can reliably KO it once it drops below 50%, so Pokemon that can handle them are quite helpful; these include Rock-, Ice-, and Flying-type Pokemon. Pokemon like Dugtrio, Kadabra, and Kangaskhan can pressure common Poliwrath switch-ins like Tentacruel, Electabuzz, Hypno, and Kadabra, which can often come in for free when the opponent expects Poliwrath to use Amnesia. This makes Pokemon like Dugtrio, Kanagaskhan, and Kadabra notable partners. If Poliwrath is not running Hypnosis, sleepers like Haunter, Venusaur, and Tangela are good choices, as they help it find free turns to set up or quickly dispatch a key threat. Paralysis spreaders make it hard for physical attackers like Persian and Kangaskhan to punish Poliwrath while it is asleep from Rest.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/rby-ou-viability-rankings.3685861/post-10591542\">2025 RBY OU Viability Rankings Update</a>, the Partial Trapping ban, and the unbans of Lapras, Hypno, and Articuno from RBY UU. As a result, it may contain outdated information.</p> <hr /> <p>Even though Kadabra isn't fully evolved, it is one of the premier choices in RBY UU due to its base 105 Speed and base 120 Special. These stats give it a high volatility factor, with a 20.5% critical hit rate combined with the 33.2% chance of a Special drop from an already powerful Psychic. It outspeeds many other Pokemon in the tier and can either hit them hard or cripple them with paralysis. This includes the ever-present Tentacruel, which is outsped and takes massive damage from the strongest Psychic in the tier or loses a lot of its effectiveness if paralyzed. This makes Kadabra an effective anti-lead choice, as Tentacruel is perhaps the most common lead in UU. Due to Kadabra's high Special stat, it can also switch in and tank special attacks surprisingly well.</p> <p>However, Kadabra is not quite in the conversation for being the best Pokemon in the tier. It is walled hard by Hypno, arguably the second-best Pokemon in RBY UU behind Tentacruel. It's almost a given that when your Kadabra is in, your opponent's Hypno will not be far behind, as Kadabra can only really chip it with Seismic Toss or fish for a Special drop with Psychic. In addition, Kadabra is pitifully frail on the physical side, with only base 40 HP and 30 Defense. It has to watch out for Persian especially, which outspeeds it and hits it hard with STAB Slash. Many other physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Dodrio can 2HKO or even OHKO Kadabra, meaning that you need to tread carefully, especially if Kadabra is paralyzed. That said, its positives as a strong and fast Psychic-type far outweigh its negatives, and it can find a place on most RBY UU teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If you're replacing any move, Seismic Toss is the one to replace. Counter can surprise physical attackers and net some surprise KOs, especially in the niche scenario where you use Explosion with Haunter or Golem and then bring Kadabra in and Counter your own Explosion. Counter can also force Hypno to have to use Rest sooner if it is spamming Seismic Toss. However, your own Seismic Toss is generally a better and more consistent damage dealer, especially to opposing Psychic-types. Reflect can be used to increase survivability, but even with this Defense boost, Kadabra is still pretty frail; it still takes over 50% on Hyper Beams from some of the stronger physical attackers in the tier, such as Kangaskhan and Dodrio. Again, Seismic Toss is almost always the better choice here.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Hypno</strong>: Hypno is easily the best check to Kadabra, as it's on the vast majority of RBY UU teams anyway and stonewalls everything that Kadabra tries to do. If you bring in Kadabra to attempt a revenge kill, you can be sure that your opponent will bring in Hypno to negate your plans with ease. Hypno can easily tank Psychic and is only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss, meaning that it can recover off any damage Kadabra deals and rid itself of Thunder Wave paralysis with Rest. Therefore, outside of getting lucky with Special drops from Psychic or full paralysis, you probably won't be KOing Hypno with Kadabra, and Kadabra will most likely need to use Recover and switch out. Worse still, Hypno can paralyze Kadabra with Thunder Wave, hampering its usefulness for the rest of the game, or even put it to sleep with Hypnosis, which is normally a death sentence in any RBY tier.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Kadabra</strong>: Kadabra also does a decent job at checking itself. If the opponent's Kadabra is already paralyzed, it can switch in to absorb a Thunder Wave from your Kadabra. From there, it can threaten with its own Thunder Wave. Most Kadabra versus Kadabra matchups start with them paralyzing each other, and then it becomes a battle of Seismic Toss and Recover until one switches out or faints.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio gets a special mention as a check because it can switch in on a Thunder Wave for free and threaten a KO on Kadabra if it is at 70% health or below. Dugtrio is one of the few Pokemon that can outspeed Kadabra and 2HKO it; unless Kadabra scores a critical hit with Psychic, Dugtrio wins the head-to-head matchup from full health. Furthermore, since Kadabra is the best Tentacruel check in the entire tier, it often comes in on Wrap to wait out the attack and then scare out Tentacruel once it ends, but since Wrap immobilizes Kadabra and does chip damage, Tentacruel can whittle Kadabra down just enough so that Dugtrio can switch in while Kadabra is unable to attack and is in the range of Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Due to Kadabra's low HP and Defense, many strong physical attackers threaten it. To start, Persian outspeeds Kadabra and easily 2HKOes with Slash, meaning, much like Dugtrio, it wins the one-on-one from full health unless Psychic lands a critical hit. Dodrio and Kangaskhan are both outsped by Kadabra and don't like being paralyzed, but they have a guaranteed OHKO on Kadabra with Hyper Beam, making them scary to face. Raticate also can OHKO Kadabra 74.4% of the time with Hyper Beam, putting it in a similar category to the aforementioned Normal-types. Other physical attackers that can OHKO Kadabra with Hyper Beam include Dragonite and Gyarados. Though these attackers have much lower chances to OHKO, they are still scary in their own right with Body Slam. Finally, Aerodactyl has proven its worth in RBY UU and can outspeed and KO Kadabra from 74.9-88.3% health with Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Articuno, though not as common of a selection as some previously mentioned Pokemon, is similar to Hypno as a check because it can sponge hits and heal off damage and paralysis with Rest. Both Psychic and Seismic Toss are only 4HKOs on Articuno, meaning that it should be able to survive most encounters. Articuno can also use Agility to shrug off the paralysis Speed drop and become akin to a Hustle sweeper in later generations with a 75% chance to move. What makes Articuno an especially good check, however, is that it can 2HKO Kadabra over 80% of the time with two Blizzards, or always 2HKO with Blizzard into Hyper Beam. Add in the threat of freeze with Blizzard or Ice Beam, and Articuno is a check that can send Kadabra running.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is the bread-and-butter set that you'll see virtually every Kadabra run, and for good reason. As mentioned before, Kadabra has the strongest Psychic in the tier and will hit pretty much everything except Hypno and opposing Kadabra for consistent damage. Thunder Wave is used to paralyze foes, most notably dangerous Wrap users like Tentacruel and Dragonite. After paralysis, Wrap only connects about 66% of the time, which severely hampers the Wrap user's effectiveness. Seismic Toss is Kadabra's go-to damage option against Hypno and opposing Kadabra, and Recover increases Kadabra's longevity, especially over the course of long games where you may need to PP stall opposing Psychic-types. For example, against Hypno that may opt for Hypnosis over Seismic Toss, Kadabra will have the upper hand.</p> <p>Using Kadabra is an exercise in how well you can spread damage with Psychic and paralysis with Thunder Wave while avoiding it taking physical attacks and paralysis yourself. This can mean having to predict your opponent's switches, which is not always an easy task. This is why Kadabra appreciates Wrap users like Tentacruel and Dragonite on its side to get a free switch-in. Once switched in, Kadabra's job is made a little easier because just by using Psychic, it can get good luck with its naturally high 20.5% critical hit rate and 33.2% chance to drop the other Pokemon's Special. That said, relying on that volatility can put Kadabra in a bad spot against Pokemon that can exploit its physical frailty. Clever switching or a Thunder Wave to catch and paralyze such an attacker may be what is needed to turn the tide of battle in your favor. Just keep in mind that your opponent could have Dugtrio lurking to absorb paralysis, and then your Kadabra could be in trouble, as Dugtrio outspeeds Kadabra and KOes it with Earthquake if it is at about 70% health.</p> <p>Kadabra is certainly not dead weight when it's paralyzed, as paralysis actually allows it to switch in against sleep users, such as Hypno and Haunter, with little fear. However, it does become harder to use and much easier to revenge kill. Thus, pairing it with a Ground-type that can absorb opposing Thunder Waves like Dugtrio or Golem is a good choice. Just be sure that your Ground-type has enough health to deal with the Thunder Wave user it is switching into. In addition, Flying-types such as Dragonite, Articuno, and Dodrio can help deal with the aforementioned Dugtrio problem by switching in for free on an Earthquake. Haunter is also a good partner for Kadabra given the prevalence of strong Normal-type moves in RBY. Haunter is immune to these moves that can KO Kadabra easily, as well as Wrap. Bulky Water-types such as Omastar and Vaporeon can also check these strong physical attackers. Haunter and Omastar notably form the strongest anti-Wrap core in RBY UU; this is a godsend for a physically frail Pokemon like Kadabra. They pair well with Kadabra because wasting sleep turns against Wrap users to wake Kadabra up is not ideal, as Kadabra takes 6-7% from Tentacruel and 9.1-10.9% from Dragonite on each hit.</p>"

  "Tentacruel": {
    "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/rby-ou-viability-rankings.3685861/post-10591542\">2025 RBY OU Viability Rankings Update</a>, the Partial Trapping ban, and the unbans of Lapras, Hypno, and Articuno from RBY UU. As a result, it may contain outdated information.</p> <hr /> <p>Tentacruel is unquestionably the defining threat of RBY UU, shaping every facet of the tier and dictating the viability of many Pokemon. Access to Wrap combined with its incredible base 100 Speed gives it nigh-unmatched utility in nearly every game. Tentacruel's Wrap shapes the identity of RBY UU, defining offensive and defensive play in the tier. Wrap wears down foes and gains momentum by pivoting while they're immobilized, and Tentacruel's many strengths accentuate these positives. Its high Speed and Wrap give it the advantage in most one-on-one interactions: against any slower foe, Tentacruel can just use Wrap and switch as the move expires, giving its team free chip damage and a free switch. This strategy has no good short-term counterplay: switching a faster Pokemon or Haunter into Wrap won't let it punish Tentacruel, making it very hard to punish and gain momentum against Tentacruel. Tentacruel also easily switches in on the tier's many Surfs and Blizzards from threats like Vaporeon, Dewgong, and Articuno. With all these switch-in chances, Tentacruel gets on the field often, and since most Pokemon are slower and thus completely shut down by Wrap, Tentacruel is hard to force out too. This longevity and pressure is made even more potent if Tentacruel chooses to run Rest to stick around even longer and avoid getting worn down. All this field presence, chip damage, momentum, and safe pivoting for offensive teammates lets Tentacruel immensely pressure defensive Pokemon. Finally, not only does Wrap prevent defensive Pokemon from healing during its duration, but Tentacruel can run Swords Dance to emphasize this pressure even more.</p> <p>Tentacruel's many positive attributes support its Wrap, but they also have their own critical applications. With its base 120 Special, which is tied for the second-highest in the tier, STAB Surf or Hydro Pump, and good coverage with Blizzard, Tentacruel is an offensive behemoth. Its STAB moves deal significant damage to Kangaskhan, Omastar, Haunter, and Kadabra, while Blizzard hits Dodrio, Dragonite, Venusaur, Victreebel, and Tangela hard, if it doesn't just OHKO them outright. This wide coverage with Tentacruel's high Speed allows it to act as a revenge killer, a sweeper, and a wallbreaker. If it chooses to run Swords Dance, Tentacruel becomes a nigh-unwallable late-game sweeper, demolishing slower teams with Wrap, Hyper Beam, and Surf with near impunity. Meanwhile, with Rest and the fantastic Water typing, Tentacruel becomes a key defensive piece. It checks Articuno, one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the tier, and answers the myriad of Surfs and Blizzards from the tier's many Water-types, such as Vaporeon, Gyarados, Omastar, Dewgong, and itself, giving it a defensive niche as well as an entry opportunity. Further, all the above niches and Wrap synergize with each other. Wrap chip damage bolsters Tentacruel's offensive pressure, and whenever Tentacruel comes in to exploit a positive offensive or defensive matchup, it gains another chance to use Wrap.</p> <p>Despite all these positives, Tentacruel does have some very notable flaws. Its Poison typing, while making it immune to Toxic, gives it a glaring weakness to Psychic and Earthquake. These weaknesses make it hard to switch Tentacruel into Pokemon like Hypno and Kangaskhan, and they prevent it from staying in against Kadabra and Dugtrio, both of which outspeed Tentacruel and heavily damage it with their STAB moves. Another notable weakness of Tentacruel is its physical frailty, which can allow threats such as Persian and Aerodactyl to force Tentacruel out as well. Tentacruel is also severely crippled by paralysis, as the Speed drop and chance for full paralysis mid-Wrap heavily impact its utility. Lastly, Tentacruel's reliance on Rest to heal itself can be heavily punished by Psychic-types such as Kadabra and Hypno, Electric-types such as Raichu and Electabuzz, and physical attackers such as Kangaskhan, Dodrio, Persian, and Dugtrio. However, even with these flaws, Tentacruel is the tier's apex predator, with its utility and power making it a mandatory pick for competitive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Tentacruel has a variety of other options, they are generally discouraged due to them either being very situational or making Tentacruel less consistent, which many team compositions cannot afford. Hydro Pump's increased power can be very appealing, as it achieves a guaranteed 3HKO on Hypno, a near-guaranteed 3HKO on Articuno, a guaranteed 2HKO on Persian, and a 2HKO against Kadabra 49.8% of the time; however, the worse accuracy and PP are very noticeable in prolonged games and make Tentacruel a much less consistent threat.</p> <p>Hyper Beam can be a nice option on the Wrap Pivot set, allowing Tentacruel to pick off opposing Kadabra switching into it at 60% health, as well as hitting opposing Tentacruel for around 33% and opposing Dewgong and Vaporeon for roughly 27%. All of the latter three can be tough for Tentacruel to break past on its own. However, outside of those damage rolls, Hyper Beam doesn’t do that much for Tentacruel, making it hard to justify running over one of its standard moves.</p> <p>Ice Beam grants Tentacruel more PP for freeze wars, increasing its chances of winning them. However, its drop in damage output from Blizzard is drastic, notably failing to OHKO Dragonite. Barrier can make Tentacruel take less damage from the wide array of physical moves, dodging the 2HKO from Kangaskhan's and Dugtrio's Earthquakes and allowing it to win those matchups; however, Barrier fails to assist it against Persian, which can ignore it with Slash and is one of the most popular physical attackers in the tier. Bubble Beam's 33.2% chance to drop Speed can come in handy against opposing Tentacruel and Persian, but in the vast majority of cases, Surf's higher damage is preferred. Mega Drain can be nice to hit Omastar or Golem with, as it allows Tentacruel to gain a significant amount of health back, but it otherwise has middling damage and hurts other matchups more than it helps.</p> <p>On the Swords Dance set, Tentacruel can opt to run Blizzard over Surf to guarantee an OHKO on Dragonite and deal more damage to Grass-types, but this comes at the cost of a guaranteed OHKO on Dugtrio and a probable 2HKO on Persian and Kangaskhan, damage rolls that are often too valuable for Swords Dance Tentacruel to pass up on.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fast Paralysis Inducers</strong>: Any paralysis inducer that outspeeds Tentacruel, such as Kadabra, Raichu, Electabuzz, or the rare Electrode, can be a very pressing issue for it. The chance of full paralysis leaves Tentacruel with a 63.57% chance to connect Wrap, sharply harming its pivoting and sweeping. The Speed drop further hinders its pivoting and leaves it vulnerable to slower threats like Hypno and Gyarados. Kadabra and Electabuzz, which avoid a 2HKO from Surf, can switch into Tentacruel directly and threaten it with Thunder Wave. They can create significant momentum if they switch into Tentacruel as Wrap misses. Even if Wrap hits, they can wait out the Wrap turns and threaten 2HKOs with their STAB moves. That being said, all these checks fear a critical hit Surf, which will deal at least 70%, letting another attack or a teammate KO them. Kadabra mitigates that risk with Recover, but using Recover lets its checks such as Hypno switch in. You can reduce the threat of Surf by switching a Water-resistant Pokemon into Tentacruel first, baiting it to lock into Wrap. This creates a switch-in opportunity for paralysis inducers, which can wait out the Wrap turns and threaten to cripple or break through Tentacruel.</p> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Haunter has enough bulk to avoid a 2HKO from Tentacruel's attacks and won't take chip damage from Wrap, although it is still immobilized. Due to its strong Thunderbolt, Haunter can force Tentacruel out and make it waste Wrap PP, usually winning the matchup when Tentacruel is below 73%, as Thunderbolt will 2HKO Tentacruel from there. However, if Haunter has already been damaged, it may be forced to use Explosion instead. It should be noted that a Thunderbolt and subsequent Explosion from Haunter usually, but not always, will KO Tentacruel from full health. Critical hits from Surf can deal severe damage to Haunter, in addition, likely forcing it to use Explosion regardless of Tentacruel's health.</p> <p><strong>Fast Physical Attackers</strong>: Fast physical attackers such as Dugtrio, Persian, and Dodrio are all reliable checks to Tentacruel, beating or matching its Speed and exploiting its mediocre physical bulk to KO it from very high health. Dugtrio can 2HKO Tentacruel with Earthquake, but its fragility makes Surf a guaranteed OHKO, so Dugtrio is limited to a revenge killing role. Tentacruel is pressured to stay at 80% HP or more, out of Earthquake's OHKO range, but this is a tall order in many situations. Dugtrio's Speed and strong Earthquake also let it halt the Wrap momentum of a chipped Tentacruel, coming in on Wrap and waiting it out before KOing the Tentacruel with Earthquake; however, this is usually a last resort option, as many common threats can heavily punish Dugtrio's frailty if they are reasonably healthy. Persian can threaten a reliable 2HKO with Slash against a Tentacruel at 90% or below. Unlike Dugtrio, however, Persian has enough bulk to survive a Surf—and fairly often two—making it more flexible than Dugtrio in threatening and/or chipping Tentacruel without getting KOed. While both Dodrio and Aerodactyl are reliably 2HKOed by Tentacruel's Surf and Blizzard, they both match or exceed Tentacruel’s Speed and can significantly damage it with Hyper Beam, allowing them to consistently threaten a KO against a a sufficiently weakened Tentacruel below 62% while at high health. Dodrio significantly improve the matchup if it manages to paralyze Tentacruel with a Body Slam or use Agility before Tentacruel comes onto the field, as a Body Slam followed by a Hyper Beam is guaranteed to KO Tentacruel.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Without Swords Dance, Tentacruel often struggles to break through opposing Water-types, such as Vaporeon, Gyarados, Dewgong, or opposing Tentacruel, on its own. It has to rely on landing multiple Wraps in a row to feasibly break through them or get a lucky freeze from Blizzard, which won't even work for Dewgong, all while risking getting paralyzed by Body Slam, frozen by Blizzard, or eating a strong Thunderbolt or Hyper Beam from Gyarados.</p> <p><strong>Tangela, Victreebel, and Dragonite</strong>: While neither switch into Tentacruel's Surf very well, when at high health, Tangela, Victreebel, and Dragonite, can be difficult for Tentacruel to break past with their good special bulk. Tentacruel has to land multiple Wraps in a row to break past these three, while they are able to cripple it immediately with Stun Spore or Thunder Wave if it misses. While Tentacruel outspeeds them and 2HKOes and OHKOes them with Blizzard, respectively, both of these Pokemon are very good at luring in Tentacruel and paralyzing it as it switches in, which can cripple Tentacruel for the rest of the game. In addition, because these two Pokemon are slower than Tentacruel, they can act after it wakes up from Rest, paralyzing it before it can retaliate and then pivoting to a more aggressive teammate with Bind or Wrap.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wrap Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is Tentacruel's defining set, capable of extracting nigh-unmatched amounts of value at every stage of the game. With its strong Blizzard and STAB Surf, Tentacruel is a consistent offensive threat, capable of 2HKOing Kangaskhan, Tangela, Venusaur, Dodrio, and Persian while OHKOing Aerodactyl, Dugtrio, and Dragonite. Even specially bulky targets like Hypno and Articuno lose roughly 30% of their health to Surf, possibly forcing an early Rest from Hypno—which a teammate like Kangaskhan, Dugtrio, Dodrio, Persian, or Dragonite can exploit—or chipping Articuno enough to stop it from sweeping. Tentacruel's fast Wrap accentuates this damage, allowing it to immobilize and chip away at slower targets, preventing them from retaliating or healing any damage they may have incurred. Additionally, Wrap allows even more offensively-threatening teammates, such as Dugtrio, Articuno, Persian, and Kangaskhan, a safe entry point to exploit the damage dealt by Tentacruel. Tentacruel's last move is Rest for two main reasons; firstly, Rest gives it general longevity in the face of damage and status, allowing it to remain an active presence throughout the game. Secondly, by running Rest, Tentacruel can better leverage its respectable special bulk and resistances to Water and Ice, switching into the likes of Articuno, Vaporeon, Omastar, and opposing Tentacruel throughout a game. The improved matchup against opposing Tentacruel is especially important in end-games, as a Tentacruel without Rest is typically at a significant disadvantage in the mirror matchup, as is the improved matchup against Articuno, since it can be very difficult to check Articuno if you do not have Rest on Tentacruel or a secondary Water-type that can handle Articuno, such as Dewgong, Omastar, or Vaporeon.</p> <p>Tentacruel is a very versatile and flexible Pokemon; it can be an offensive weapon and revenge killer with its Speed and consistent damage output, a defensive piece with its respectable special bulk, resistances, and Rest, and it can be a pivot with Wrap to bring in its teammates. Getting Tentacruel onto the field safely as often as possible is vital to making the most of it, as is properly identifying whether using Wrap to chip foes and pivot is worth risking a miss, or if Tentacruel should fire off strong Surfs and Blizzards to break down the opposing team's defensive core instead. However, you have to balance this pivoting and offense with keeping Tentacruel healthy as an answer to Articuno and Water-types such as Vaporeon, Dewgong, and opposing Tentacruel as well. Flying- and Grass-types switching in to answer Dugtrio are two great opportunities to bring Tentacruel into play, as Tentacruel threatens to OHKO or 2HKO many of them with Blizzard. Another good entry opportunity is while opposing slow wallbreakers, such as Kangaskhan and Articuno, switch into a Hypno or Vaporeon asleep from Rest, as Tentacruel can regain momentum with Wrap before they can retaliate. Tentacruel can also make good use of sleeping foes, such as Hypno and Omastar, attempting to burn sleep turns, as it can deal significant damage with Surf while they are asleep before starting Wrap as they wake up, preventing them from retaliating or healing off damage sustained during Rest.</p> <p>Given how versatile a threat Tentacruel is, it synergizes very well with many common threats in the tier. Sweepers and wallbreakers like Dugtrio, Kangaskhan, Gyarados, and Persian enjoy Tentacruel's Wrap allowing them to switch in safely, preserving their health and avoiding getting paralyzed by Thunder Wave, which in turn lets them come in later for another round of attacks. In return, they threaten to 2HKO common Tentacruel answers like Kadabra and Electabuzz. Dugtrio is particularly noteworthy, as it is immune to Thunder Wave intended to cripple Tentacruel, punishing the opposition heavily for trying with its STAB Earthquake, good coverage in Rock Slide and Slash, threat of Substitute catching a switch from the opponent, and high critical hit rate. One especially good place to pivot Dugtrio in with Wrap is against opposing Tentacruel, as it can KO Tentacruel extremely early with Earthquake. In return, Tentacruel outspeeds and threatens common Dugtrio answers like Tangela, Venusaur, Dragonite, and Kangaskhan, with Wrap immobilizing them and wearing them down into Surf or Blizzard range. Hypno is another fantastic teammate for Tentacruel, coming into common Tentacruel answers like Kadabra and Electabuzz and forcing them to switch out, lest they get paralyzed by Thunder Wave or put to sleep by Hypnosis. Either status makes them easy pickings for slower physical attackers like Kangaskhan, Gyarados, and Dragonite, as well as prevents them from checking Tentacruel thereafter. Hypno, when healthy, also can soft check other common Tentacruel answers like Persian and Aerodactyl with its strong Psychic and Thunder Wave. In exchange, Hypno benefits immensely from Tentacruel's ability to answer Pokemon that heavily punish a resting Hypno, such as Kangaskhan, Gyarados, Venusaur, Tangela, and Dragonite. Furthermore, Tentacruel's fast Wrap benefits Hypno immensely by baiting in Pokemon that Hypno checks, such as Electabuzz and Kadabra, before, crucially, letting Hypno switch into them without taking chip damage or paralysis on the way in.</p> <p>Bulky Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Gyarados, Vaporeon, Dragonite, and Dewgong also make for effective Tentacruel teammates. While healthy, they can switch into some of Tentacruel's common checks such as Persian and Dugtrio, ideally while they are immobilized by Tentacruel's Wrap, and threaten the opposing team with strong attacks and the threat of paralysis from either Body Slam or Thunder Wave in the case of Dragonite. They are also very adept at exploiting sleeping Rest users, such as Hypno, Vaporeon, Omastar, and Dewgong, that switch into Wrap to burn sleep turns while taking relatively little damage from Tentacruel's Wrap. Dewgong also grants the Tentacruel user an additional Articuno counter, as do Omastar and Vaporeon, which allows Tentacruel to play more aggressively without as much risk of Articuno getting out of hand. Dewgong further has a freeze immunity, which allows Tentacruel to avoid taking as many Blizzards from an opposing Tentacruel and reduces the chances that it gets frozen. Tangela, Victreebel, and Venusaur also make for very effective Tentacruel partners, as, while healthy, they answer Dugtrio, Persian, and Electabuzz, using the entry point to land a crippling Sleep Powder before providing additional value with their other utility moves. Meanwhile, Tentacruel acts as a decent answer to any Flying-types, such as Articuno, Dragonite, and Gyarados, that try to exploit Tangela, Victreebel, and Venusaur's lack of coverage moves.</p> <p>Lastly, Flying-type teammates such as the aforementioned Gyarados and Dragonite, but also Aerodactyl, Articuno, and Dodrio, can benefit Tentacruel by checking Dugtrio with their immunity to Earthquake and strong attacks. Gyarados and Dragonite can switch into Dugtrio's Rock Slide two times, barring an untimely critical hit, before Dugtrio can threaten to 2HKO them as they switch in. Aerodactyl and Dodrio are less sturdy answers to Dugtrio, only taking a single Rock Slide before Dugtrio can 2HKO them; however, they can threaten Kadabra fairly well when it is chipped. Aerodactyl's high Speed stat is particularly noteworthy because, excluding the uncommon Electrode, it is the only Pokemon that can reliably revenge kill an unparalyzed Dugtrio without taking an attack in the process. Its Normal resistance is also useful when facing Dugtrio, as Dugtrio commonly uses Slash as an early-game midground option when scouting its opponent's team, and Aerodactyl takes Slash very comfortably. Articuno is unable to switch into Dugtrio's Rock Slide safely at all, being 2HKOed from full health by it, but, when above 58% health, it can force Dugtrio to switch out with its Blizzard if it can come in safely—such as on an Earthquake or from Tentacruel's Wrap—and if Dugtrio is not behind a Substitute.</p> <p>Tentacruel’s good Speed tier and access to Wrap make it a common lead in RBY UU, outspeeding and locking down any slower lead, including Hypno, Haunter, and Venusaur. Wrap allows a safe pivot to a teammate to capitalize on the immobilized lead, or any teammates that the opposing player switches to, whenever the Tentacruel user dictates. For example, if your opponent switches to Clefable or Hypno and attempts to PP stall Wrap or fish for a miss to paralyze Tentacruel, you can pivot to a teammate such as Venusaur or Haunter and put a foe to sleep. As another example, if your opponent leads Haunter and stays in to fish for a Wrap miss and put Tentacruel to sleep with Hypnosis, you can go to Dugtrio and threaten to OHKO Haunter with Earthquake. This ability to pivot with Wrap puts the Tentacruel user at a significant advantage, as they have the initiative and control the pace of the game, which allows them to pick the best moment to switch while chipping down the opposing team. This advantage creates an intricate mind game. Opponents commonly respond to this advantage by switching to a Pokemon with paralysis that outspeeds or Speed ties Tentacruel such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, or Electrode. These paralysis users pressure Tentacruel to quickly switch to a teammate, usually Hypno but possibly Dugtrio, before Wrap ends and the foe regains the initiative by freely threatening Tentacruel. If it hasn't started Wrap yet, Tentacruel may even hard switch instead of Wrap pivoting to avoid the risk of a Wrap miss. If Tentacruel hard switches, though, the opponent may predict this and, instead of bringing in a paralysis user, bring in their own Tentacruel to handle the incoming Hypno or Dugtrio. With the other Tentacruel possibly in play, the above mind game starts again. The original Tentacruel user may predict the opponent bringing in their opposing Tentacruel, causing the original user to bring in their own paralysis inducer, but the opponent may respond with their own Hypno or Dugtrio to beat the paralysis user, and so on.</p> <p>When facing fast paralysis-inducing leads, such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Electrode, Tentacruel will be forced to switch to a teammate to avoid getting paralyzed, thereby giving the opposing player a chance to paralyze some Pokemon with Thunder Wave or predict the switch and bring in a sleep inducer such as Haunter or Venusaur. Note that the same pressure to switch and cede initiative occurs if Tentacruel misses a Wrap against the fast paralysis inducer as it switches in, or if Wrap connects but the Tentacruel doesn't switch out before it ends. Against opposing Tentacruel leads, Tentacruel can go for a freeze with Blizzard while dealing some minor chip damage, use Surf to maximize chip damage to more quickly bring the opposing Tentacruel into KO range for Dugtrio or Persian, or use Wrap and pivot into a fast paralysis-inducing teammate. While Tentacruel is likely to win the matchup against lead Dodrio by using Blizzard, it only wins while avoiding paralysis about half the time, and it is almost always significantly weakened from the interaction, which can be very costly given how valuable Tentacruel is. It is better to switch to another teammate that checks Dodrio, such as Omastar or Aerodactyl. The matchup against Persian is similar; Tentacruel is statistically more likely to win the one-on-one but will be significantly weakened in the process, which is undesirable in many circumstances. When leading with Tentacruel, it can be beneficial to have a second Water-type in the back, ensuring you can take opposing Water- and Ice-type attacks in case Tentacruel gets chipped or compromised by status early on.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance Tentacruel is a surprising and effective late-game sweeper that can effectively break past bulkier Pokemon that expect to comfortably check it. These include Vaporeon, Hypno, and opposing Tentacruel, with Swords Dance Tentacruel punishing them using Rest especially hard. This Tentacruel set also can be a mid-game pivot, but since it cannot afford to run Rest, a Wrap miss is often devastating, making mid-game pivoting risky. After one Swords Dance, Tentacruel's Wrap deals around 6% per turn to bulky targets such as Hypno, Gyarados, Kangaskhan, and Vaporeon, transforming from a pivoting move that deals chip damage to a potent wallbreaking tool that completely decimates paralyzed teams. Boosted Wrap quickly wears foes down into KO range of either Surf or Tentacruel's boosted Hyper Beam, which are reliable KO options against slower and bulkier Pokemon once they are slightly below half health, while leaving them unable to retaliate. This process normally forces the opponent to rely on Pokemon that outspeed Tentacruel to force it out, such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Persian. However, none of these Pokemon can reliably switch into Tentacruel, as Tentacruel's boosted Hyper Beam can KO all of them after only a small amount of chip damage, or, in the case of Kadabra, no chip damage at all. When using Swords Dance to attempt a sweep, ensure that Tentacruel sets up against targets that are unable to status it or significantly harm it, such as sleeping targets looking to burn some sleep turns against Wrap, slower Pokemon looking to use a recovery move, or opposing Tentacruel looking to get a lucky freeze with Blizzard;&amp;mdashthis mirror interaction is especially noteworthy in end-game positions, where Swords Dance Tentacruel dominates if it is reasonably healthy. It is important to recognize that these setup opportunities stem from opponents expecting Tentacruel to run its standard, less offensive set; take advantage whenever opponents make that wrong prediction and think they can tolerate being passive towards Tentacruel. Due to this set's increased vulnerability to status, it can be more difficult to bring in than the standard Wrap pivot set, often relying on resisted attacks, teammate Wrappers like Dragonite, and good double switching to come onto the field safely. Another notable, albeit uncommon, way of utilizing Swords Dance Tentacruel is as a mid-game wallbreaker, boosting its Attack against an opposing Tentacruel or Vaporeon that's burning Rest sleep turns to punch a large hole in the opposing team.</p> <p>Swords Dance Tentacruel can be a challenging sweeper to use, often relying on its teammates to force the opponent into positions where it can safely use Swords Dance, as well as needing them to paralyze or KO any Pokemon that could stop its sweep. As mentioned before, sleeping Pokemon looking to burn a turn or two of sleep make excellent setup fodder; hence, Swords Dance Tentacruel pairs well with sleep inducers such as Haunter, Hypno, Venusaur, Victreebel, and Tangela. These five Pokemon also have defensive utility against foes that may stop Tentacruel's sweep as well, with Haunter walling opposing Persian, Venusaur, Victreebel, Tangela checking opposing Dugtrio, Raichu, Electabuzz, and Persian, Hypno crippling Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Persian with Thunder Wave—allowing Tentacruel to sweep with Swords Dance-boosted Wrap unopposed. Seismic Toss Hypno is also an effective teammate for Swords Dance Tentacruel, as it can reliably force an opposing Hypno to use Rest, most commonly at around half health, which gifts Tentacruel an excellent opportunity to switch in and use Swords Dance. Dugtrio and Persian are two excellent teammates for Swords Dance Tentacruel, as they can exploit opposing Kadabra, Electabuzz, and Raichu attempting to stop Tentacruel's sweep, as well as clean up any remaining foes after Swords Dance Tentacruel's assault. Kangaskhan and Dragonite are two more solid partners for Swords Dance Tentacruel that can paralyze or KO Persian and Kadabra attempting to check Tentacruel. Another issue teams with this set often face is dealing with Articuno and opposing Tentacruel, as Swords Dance Tentacruel cannot reliably switch into them throughout the match due to its lack of Rest. Teammates such as Vaporeon, Omastar, and Dewgong can switch into Articuno and Tentacruel throughout the game.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/rby-ou-viability-rankings.3685861/post-10591542\">2025 RBY OU Viability Rankings Update</a>, the Partial Trapping ban, and the unbans of Lapras, Hypno, and Articuno from RBY UU. As a result, it may contain outdated information.</p> <hr /> <p>Though Golem is a less used Pokemon in the RBY UU metagame, it certainly has its merits as a wallbreaker for a few reasons, with the biggest being Explosion. An Explosion coming from Golem is actually the strongest attack in the tier, having the power to put a massive dent in defensive stalwart Vaporeon or even OHKO Hypno. A properly timed Explosion can turn the tide of battle in your favor, but that's not all Golem has to offer. With proper paralysis support and good prediction, it can punch holes in enemy teams using STAB moves Earthquake and Rock Slide. Golem can do all this while also having good defensive utility due to its Rock / Ground typing, which gives it a resistance to Normal-type moves and an immunity to Electric-type moves. Wrap is a defining element of RBY UU, and Golem can be a useful part of an anti-Wrap core due to its resistance to the move. In addition, it can switch in on Dodrio or on another Pokemon's predicted Hyper Beam and punish both with impunity. Finally, its Electric immunity makes it easier to switch in on a predicted Thunder Wave or Thunderbolt, especially when paired with one of UU's many strong Water-types, such as Tentacruel.</p> <p>Golem's most glaring weakness is its Speed. Golem is outsped by pretty much every Pokemon that sees play in UU, even Pokemon known for being slow like Omastar and Tangela. Not only does Golem have little special bulk, it also has a host of weaknesses. This means that it can be OHKOed by UU's aforementioned Water types, as well as by Pokemon like Articuno with Blizzard and even Raichu with Surf. Therefore, Golem is heavily reliant on support from its teammates and good predictions in order to make an impact.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Golem's most useful alternative move is Rest, which is used over Substitute or Body Slam as a way to keep Golem healthy. When Golem gets low on health, it can go for Rest as the opponent switches in a sleeping Pokemon to take the Explosion. As mentioned before, it can also burn off the sleep turns by coming in on Wrap and Hyper Beam, or on another sleeping Pokemon. Fire Blast is a possible offensive option that does more damage to Tangela than any of Golem's other moves. It also has the potential to burn foes, which is especially useful against partial-trappers like Dragonite. Finally, Counter can be used after switching into Hyper Beam and or Body Slam, either hitting the recharging foe or punishing an Explosion switch-in.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Due to Golem’s low Special, low Speed, and 4x weakness to Water, any Water-type can OHKO it. Vaporeon can tank anything Golem throws at it, even Explosion from full health. Gyarados can switch in on Earthquake for no damage and OHKO Golem, though it does need to watch out if Golem predicts the switch and uses Rock Slide. Omastar also outspeeds and OHKOes Golem, though Golem does over half of Omastar's health in damage with Earthquake. Tentacruel also takes huge damage from Earthquake and can even be OHKOed by Explosion, but it still maintains the upper hand, as it can OHKO Golem or halt its plans to use Explosion with Wrap. While Golem can be used with another Pokemon like Haunter or Omastar to form an anti-Wrap PP stalling core, it still needs to watch out for Tentacruel's Surf.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: The two notable Grass-types in the tier, Tangela and Venusaur, are both solid checks to Golem. Tangela’s high Defense, resistance to Earthquake, and access to STAB Mega Drain make it an excellent check to Golem. Note that Mega Drain does not OHKO until Tangela has a Growth under its belt, meaning Tangela is still susceptible to taking massive damage from Explosion. In addition, if the Golem player predicts a Tangela switch-in, they can opt for Rock Slide, which Tangela has a harder time shrugging off since it hits for neutral damage. Venusaur is a little worse at switching into Golem, as it does not resist Earthquake and is 3HKOed. However, it easily outspeeds Golem and OHKOes it with Razor Leaf, unlike Tangela, meaning the Golem player has fewer options. In either case, both Tangela and Venusaur force Golem to switch out, meaning they can spread status to Golem's teammates.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: As a Flying-type, Articuno is able to switch in on Earthquake and take out Golem easily with STAB Blizzard. However, good prediction on the Golem user’s end can spell disaster for Articuno, as it is OHKOed by Rock Slide. Articuno also will be sent running if Golem uses Substitute or paralyzes it with Body Slam on the switch. While it is a risky play, Golem can even switch into a paralyzed Articuno while it attempts to use Agility. If full paralysis triggers either turn, Golem wins the interaction with Rock Slide. Finally, if Articuno gets unlucky and Blizzard misses while Rock Slide does not, it is KOed.</p> <p><strong>Raichu</strong>: Raichu has a hard time switching into Golem's attacks due to Earthquake hitting for super effective damage and Body Slam potentially paralyzing it. However, if it switches in on Rock Slide, Golem is in trouble. Raichu outspeeds it and OHKOes with Surf, forcing Golem out.</p>",

      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Earthquake and Rock Slide are Golem's go-to moves early in the game, weaker than Explosion but packing a big punch coming off its base 110 Attack. Due to its powerful STAB moves and Explosion, Golem can be used effectively as a wallbreaker, especially for punishing Pokemon that have just used Rest. For its final moveslot, Substitute is used to help scout moves and Pokemon as well as providing a layer of defense so Golem can get off an Explosion without being KOed first. However, Body Slam can be used over Substitute to help hinder your opponent's team through paralysis, meaning Golem doesn't need to rely on its teammates for paralysis support as much.</p> <p>Explosion is used to deal extraordinary damage to every Pokemon in the tier, with a few exceptions such as Omastar and Haunter. Some notable calculations include a guaranteed OHKO on Persian and possible OHKOs on Tentacruel and Hypno. It is against your opponent's bulky Pokemon that Explosion really shines, taking out hard-to-KO team members or at least putting a huge dent in them so they can be revenge killed. A good example target is Kangaskhan, which Golem switches into and easily tanks a Body Slam from—barely minding potential paralysis due to its Speed—before dealing 72.8-85.7% damage with Explosion to set up a revenge kill. Deciding when to use Explosion can be hard, though, since your opponent can predict it and switch in a Pokemon that is already low on health or that resists it. Anticipate this counterplay and use a different move, such as a STAB move for instant damage, Substitute to scout, or Body Slam for a chance to spread paralysis. It is recommended to use Explosion when Golem is around half health or when you think you can catch Hypno on the switch, either OHKOing this top threat or priming it for a revenge killer like Dugtrio to follow up on.</p> <p>Despite its flaws, Golem still manages to find a few different points of entry into the game. For instance, bringing in Golem is a great way to stop a Dodrio sweep, as Rock Slide deals super effective damage and Golem hard walls Dodrio. It is especially adept at switching into Hyper Beam and punishing Dodrio and Articuno with Rock Slide or Kangaskhan and Persian with Explosion. Golem can also be used as sleep fodder, since its defensive typing means it can freely switch in often on Normal-, Electric-, and Rock-type moves, allowing for easy pivoting. It can even wake up from short sleeps if switched in on Wrap or Hyper Beam enough times.</p> <p>Golem can form an excellent immunity core with Gyarados, as it covers Gyarados's Electric weakness and Gyarados covers its Ground weakness, so both can be effective mid- or late-game by coming in freely on double switches. Pairing Golem with another effective anti-Wrap Pokemon such as Haunter or Omastar is also a valid strategy, as they can work together to PP stall Wrap without sustaining too much damage. Golem works especially well with either because Haunter's Thunderbolt handles its Water-type counters and Omastar's Blizzard dispatches its Grass-type counters. Especially if Golem doesn't run Body Slam, it appreciates paralysis-spreading teammates. A great example is Kadabra, which shrugs off special attacks surprisingly well for it with Recover, revenge kills threats to Golem, and appreciates it taking Normal-type attacks and the crippling Thunder Wave in return. Finally, Dugtrio takes advantage of Golem weakening or KOing an opponent's Ground-type checks to have a much easier time revenge killing or sweeping.</p>"

Its terribly slow Speed leaves it hard to switch in and susceptible to Wrappers such as Tentacruel, Dragonite, and Pinsir. Its coverage is atrocious, leaving it struggling versus Ground- and Grass-types like Dugtrio, Tangela, Venusaur, and the occasional Golem. While it can act as bait that creates opportunities for Pokemon like Tangela and Articuno, relying constantly on prediction leads to Magneton being inconsistent. Magneton also dislikes paralysis, as it loses its ability to outspeed slower and paralyzed foes. It competes with Electabuzz, which outclasses it in all areas but raw damage, and with Raichu and Electrode, both faster Pokemon with more distinguishing features like Surf or Explosion.</p>",

Thunder Wave gives Magneton a tool to cripple faster Wrappers such as Tentacruel and sweepers such as Persian and Electabuzz. Double-Edge is Magneton's best option for combatting Dugtrio and Grass-types, although its poor Attack stat makes the damage output low, with only a slim chance to 3HKO Dugtrio. Rest grants Magneton greater longevity, with the multitude of Wrappers in the tier granting it chances to burn sleep turns. However, a sleeping Magneton is setup fodder for Agility users, namely Dragonite, Articuno, and Dodrio. Alternatively, Toxic punishes Dugtrio, Tangela, and Golem, with Golem being forced to use Explosion much earlier and take chip damage if repeatedly switched in.</p> <p>Magneton's movepool is rather poor, so its customization options are minimal. Thunder turns many of Thunderbolt's possible KOs into guaranteed ones. However, its poor accuracy makes it inconsistent. Hyper Beam is Magneton's strongest attack versus Kadabra, Venusaur, and Dugtrio, but the recharge turns often leave Magneton in terrible situations. Rest and Toxic could be used together, granting Magneton longevity versus Wrappers. However, this forces you to either decrease the consistency of your paralysis spreading or make Magneton completely toothless versus Dugtrio.</p> <p>Magneton pairs especially well with Dugtrio checks, as it often baits Dugtrio into switching in. Tangela works well with this, taking minimal damage from Earthquake and Rock Slide and threatening back with status or Mega Drain. Pokemon like Dragonite and Articuno can also work well with this strategy. Dragonite can trade with Dugtrio by using Blizzard as Dugtrio uses Toxic to stop a possible AgiliWrap sweep, putting Dugtrio in KO range of Magneton's Double-Edge.

Dodrio can further boost its Speed and make up for Speed drops from paralysis through Agility, which has the added bonus of making it more difficult to pin down with Wrap.

As a result, getting Dodrio into the fray can be a difficult task without support from Wrap or smart double-switching.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dodrio's movepool doesn't leave much in the way of options. Substitute can allow Dodrio to take a bigger hit than it should, but it is limited in utility, as it doesn't block status in RBY.

In return, they 2HKO Dodrio with Rock Slide and Blizzard, respectively. For similar reasons, Dodrio struggles to offensively threaten Aerodactyl, though most Aerodactyl sets despise possible paralysis from Body Slam much more than Golem or Omastar.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Articuno's bulk tends to allow it to take enough hits from Dodrio before it OHKOes with Blizzard.

However, neither can switch in safely due to Body Slam's power and paralysis chance. Plus, even if they switch in on Drill Peck, Hyper Beam has a good chance to KO afterwards. Raichu tends to have even more trouble switching in than Electabuzz because it only Speed ties Dodrio, making the matchup very inconsistent.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite takes Body Slam and Drill Peck very well at full health, unless Dodrio lands a critical hit, and can then paralyze it with Thunder Wave.</p>",

Drill Peck complements this excellently, 2HKOing Haunter, Tangela, and Venusaur, though in Tangela's case Dodrio may have to take Stun Spore to KO it. Dodrio's Hyper Beam is extremely strong, KOing even bulkier threats like Tentacruel and Hypno after a Body Slam on the switch. Finally, Agility is put in the last slot to allow Dodrio to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Should it be forced to take paralysis, Dodrio can also use Agility to ignore the Speed drop from it.</p> <p>Dodrio, as mentioned before, is extremely frail and dislikes paralysis, so it shouldn't be brought into a game early except as a lead. Lead Dodrio can be used to threaten Tentacruel and Kadabra right out of the gate, usually putting them into range for Dugtrio to KO them after Dodrio goes down. This can be huge, as Pokemon like Tentacruel and Hypno otherwise put immense pressure on teams throughout a game. However, this often means sacrificing Dodrio, which may not be favorable in the long-term. Generally, outside of the lead slot, Dodrio should play a hit-and-run playstyle before cleaning up late-game. Dodrio's two main points of entry are opposing Earthquakes and revenge killing. Its Hyper Beam is notably likely to finish off threats dented by a teammate's Explosion. Dodrio's immunity to Earthquake is especially helpful for double-switching out to Electric-types, reducing risk, and maintaining momentum. This immunity can also be utilized alongside Haunter, with its immunity to Normal-type attacks forming a small immunity core. However, repeatedly switching between them can lead to an early KO with a good prediction from the opponent. Dodrio is also good for taking advantage of threats in a passive state, such as foes using Rest, where it can set up with Agility, outspeed every Pokemon in the tier, and tear the opposing team apart with its immediate offensive presence. Furthermore, Dodrio can set up against Dugtrio or weakened physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Persian, as it forces them out with its powerful offensive capabilities. On top of that, forcing these attackers out isn't even required, as Dodrio will gladly take a hit if it means KOing the opposing Pokemon and potentially ending the game outright.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/rby-ou-viability-rankings.3685861/post-10591542\">2025 RBY OU Viability Rankings Update</a>, the Partial Trapping ban, and the unbans of Lapras, Hypno, and Articuno from RBY UU. As a result, it may contain outdated information.</p> <hr /> <h3>Overview</h3> <p>Dewgong’s main role in RBY UU is being the third-best purely bulky Water-type Pokemon. In terms of raw bulk, Vaporeon is simply the strongest choice. The second most prominent purely bulky Water-type Pokemon is Omastar, which holds on to relevance thanks to a resistance to Normal-type moves. Additionally, other Water-types with more diverse movepools, like Tentacruel and Poliwrath, also give Dewgong some competition.</p> <p>The two main features that make Dewgong notable are its Ice typing and superior Speed relative to other Water-type Pokemon. Being an Ice-type gifts Dewgong an impressively strong STAB-boosted Blizzard. Despite Dewgong having lower Special than its closest competitors, its Blizzard tends to deal more damage than anything they can throw out. Just a few significant calculations include a possible 3HKO against Hypno, a very likely 3HKO against Gyarados, a 2HKO on Kangaskhan, and a guaranteed OHKO against Dodrio and Dragonite. The Ice type also improves some of Dewgong’s specific matchups. Most notably, Dewgong is the hardest Articuno counter available, as it is uniquely 4x resistant to Blizzard, cannot be frozen, and forces Articuno to take heavy recoil damage over time from using Double-Edge. Dewgong’s Speed is a relevant advantage primarily because Dewgong is able to outspeed and pressure Hypno, which other Water-type Pokemon may struggle with. The Speed and freeze immunity also help Dewgong when it faces other bulky Water-type Pokemon, namely Vaporeon.</p> <p>Despite these advantages, Dewgong is held back simply because its bulk is not as good as that of Vaporeon and Omastar. Poliwrath also largely surpasses it in physical bulk. Dewgong’s matchups against stronger attackers, both physical and special, simply do not compare to its competitors. As an example, Electabuzz will always 2HKO Dewgong with Thunderbolt but can only 3HKO Vaporeon. Dewgong does not have the longevity it needs; thus, it exists mainly as a niche pick, filling slots only on teams that truly demand its particular blend of strengths and can afford its shortcomings.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dewgong lacks significant other options. It has other physical options like Headbutt and Hyper Beam, the former of which may be useful on teams focused on spreading paralysis, but it lacks the offensive presence to take full advantage of these moves. Other Pokemon, like Poliwrath, have much better physical attacks at their disposal and the Attack stat to back them up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Thunderbolt</strong>: While every major Thunderbolt user in the tier is 3HKOed or better by Blizzard, Dewgong would prefer to avoid the interaction if it can. Electabuzz and Raichu claim 2HKOs with Thunderbolt and boast high critical hit ratios to make the move even scarier. Gyarados and Haunter can consistently 3HKO Dewgong, allowing them to easily revenge kill Dewgong or KO it while it is asleep. While it has no business switching in, Dragonite can also finish off a weakened Dewgong with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Rock- and Fighting-type Moves</strong>: Dewgong’s weakness to Rock-type moves is a small but noticeable disadvantage when comparing it to other Water-type Pokemon. While neither is likely to win a clean head-to-head interaction with Dewgong, Kangaskhan and Golem claim a possible 3HKO and guaranteed 2HKO, respectively, with Rock Slide. Dewgong also has more trouble switching into Dugtrio, as both Earthquake and Rock Slide deal significant damage. Fighting-type Pokemon and moves are very rare in RBY UU, but they still can give Dewgong some trouble when they appear. Poliwrath that carry Submission are the most notable threat, as they have an 87.1% chance to 2HKO Dewgong while taking very little from all of Dewgong’s moves.</p> <p><strong>Partial-trapping Damage</strong>: Due to its largely inferior bulk, Dewgong does not stomach chip damage, especially from Wrap, very well. Tentacruel and even Dragonite can use Wrap to gradually whittle down Dewgong’s health and quickly put it into range of most fast attackers. Dewgong is worse at taking Wrap and hoping for a miss than Vaporeon and especially Omastar. While Fire Spin is not particularly common, it is worth noting that Dewgong does not resist it and is thus not a reliable check to Fire-type Pokemon like Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Venusaur</strong>: Venusaur outspeeds Dewgong and can deal over 60% damage with Razor Leaf or put it to sleep with Sleep Powder. Blizzard is obviously a frightening prospect for Venusaur, but Venusaur is the best Dewgong revenge killer in the tier and can win one-on-one if necessary.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>STAB Blizzard is one of the main reasons to use Dewgong. It is Dewgong’s strongest attack and deals remarkable damage to most non-resistant targets. Surf can hit a small pool of Pokemon harder than Blizzard and has near-perfect accuracy, which makes it a wise choice to finish off weakened targets. Ice Beam may seem redundant with Blizzard, but it can be useful in matchups against other Water-type Pokemon, for it gives Dewgong the potential to freeze them without wasting precious Blizzard PP. Body Slam is used to help spread paralysis; paralyzing common switch-ins like Tentacruel and Vaporeon can be quite useful long-term. Thanks to Dewgong's slightly higher Attack, its Body Slam also does more damage than that of Vaporeon and Omastar. For reference, the move is likely to 3HKO Kadabra. Finally, Dewgong carries Rest to improve its longevity. While not quite as defensive as others, Dewgong can still attempt to use Rest and subsequently wake up in front of Water- and Ice-type Pokemon. Switching in amidst Wrap turns is another good option to potentially burn sleep turns.</p> <p>Dewgong’s primary role is as a defensive piece. It can work as a mixed wall in a similar fashion to Vaporeon, albeit a frailer one, that can slow down offensive momentum from strong attackers like Dodrio, Persian, Kangaskhan, and, of course, Articuno. Dewgong has some offensive prowess as well. Dewgong is surprisingly good at breaking Hypno, as it outspeeds and can 3HKO with Blizzard. Likewise, most major attackers simply do not want to take STAB Blizzard. Generally, Dewgong is most valuable mid- to late-game. This way, Dewgong’s best matchup can be identified and it can be deployed accordingly. For example, it may be useful to determine if your opponent has an Articuno before you let Dewgong take on a physical attacker or attempt to freeze an opposing Water-type Pokemon.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/rby-ou-viability-rankings.3685861/post-10591542\">2025 RBY OU Viability Rankings Update</a>, the Partial Trapping ban, and the unbans of Lapras, Hypno, and Articuno from RBY UU. As a result, it may contain outdated information.</p> <hr /> <p>Haunter is the sole viable Ghost-type in RBY UU and has some fairly unique traits that make it a solid threat in the tier. For starters, Haunter is the fastest sleep inducer in the tier, which lets it work as a lead or early-game threat and gives it ample opportunity to disable a threat for what could be the rest of the game. This Speed also allows it to outrun threats like Articuno and Gyarados while leaving sizable dents in their bulk. Its immunity to Normal-type attacks makes it a solid Persian check and decent counterplay to Wrap in the form of PP stall. PP stalling Wrap works especially well if Haunter is paired with Pokemon like Omastar and Golem, as they resist it. Haunter's Poison typing also comes into play here, as being immune to Toxic means it can't take poison damage during Wrap chains from threats like Dragonite. In addition to this, its Poison typing grants it a valuable role as a check to Venusaur and Tangela, being merely 5HKOed by Razor Leaf and taking minimal damage from Mega Drain. Haunter has a workable special movepool as well, with options such as Thunderbolt and Psychic making it fairly flexible. The prized Thunderbolt is of particular note, allowing Haunter to act as a pseudo-Electric-type for a team, breaking through the powerful bulky Water-types of the tier. Overall, Haunter works well as a defensive pivot but can go on the offense just fine as well.</p> <p>However, Haunter is extremely frail on the physical side, which can be heavily exploited through its weakness to Earthquake. Prominent physical attackers such as Dugtrio and Kangaskhan carry Earthquake frequently, which can make switching in significantly less safe. In addition, Haunter's Speed is a bit below what's desirable, leaving it slower than the ever-present Tentacruel. Haunter's Speed is further compromised by paralysis, which causes it to be outsped by threats like Kangaskhan and reduces its consistency with Hypnosis.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psychic is sometimes used for easing prediction and hitting other Poison-types like opposing Haunter. Outside of that, though, Night Shade and Thunderbolt cover the other threats it would hit. However, the Special drop can be useful for prolonged Tentacruel interactions. Should Thunderbolt's damage not be sufficient, Thunder will usually 2HKO Tentacruel and OHKO Gyarados. Mega Drain can be used to 2HKO Golem attempting to switch in on Explosion, and its recovery gives Haunter a significantly better Omastar matchup. Rest is another interesting option worth using, as it allows Haunter to work as a Dragonite check, burning sleep turns under Wrap and stalling even more Wrap PP.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio is faster than Haunter, immune to Thunderbolt, and OHKOes with Earthquake, making it a premier counter to Haunter. However, it can't switch into Night Shade repeatedly and greatly fears Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Kadabra is a serious threat to Haunter, especially in lead situations. While it's 3HKOed by Night Shade and even OHKOed by Explosion, Haunter is outsped by it and 2HKOed by its Psychic. Generally, the only way Haunter can win is by landing Hypnosis or Explosion. Hypno can 2HKO Haunter using Psychic while taking very little from any move Haunter can throw at it. The only way Haunter can KO Hypno is by using two Night Shades on the switch and then Explosion. It should be noted that Kadabra and Hypno always run Thunder Wave as well, which will cripple Haunter for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: Golem is immune to Thunderbolt, Haunter's main attacking move, and can very easily absorb its Explosion. To make matters worse, Golem's Earthquake is a clean OHKO. However, should Haunter choose to carry Mega Drain, it 2HKOes Golem on the switch while recovering over 70% of its HP.</p> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: While utilizing Haunter's Normal immunity to check Kangaskhan sounds enticing, Kangaskhan’s Earthquake is a 2HKO. Haunter can't win one-on-one, but Kangaskhan dislikes Hypnosis, critical hits, and repeated hits as it switches in, the latter two exploiting its mediocre special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Electabuzz</strong>: Electabuzz often carries Psychic, and, since it takes minimal damage from Thunderbolt, it can safely win the interaction. Should battling Haunter head-on be unfavorable, Electabuzz can paralyze it with Thunder Wave at minimum. However, Haunter can trade with Explosion.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sleeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hypnosis lets Haunter put foes to sleep right out of the gate, which can essentially be a KO should the right threat be hit. Night Shade 3HKOes Dugtrio, Kadabra, and opposing Haunter, which makes it a bit more difficult for them to switch in and check Haunter repeatedly. Thunderbolt 3HKOes common Water-types like Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar. Once Haunter has taken too much damage or has been paralyzed, it can use Explosion to try and take a Pokemon down with it, which notably OHKOes Kadabra and potentially Dugtrio.</p> <p>Haunter can work early-game, sleeping a threat and likely taking out another Pokemon with Thunderbolt or Explosion. Once Haunter has entered the game, it should put a foe to sleep as soon as possible, disabling a part of the opposing team for what could be the rest of the game. However, Haunter isn't strictly relegated to early-game duties, especially because it stops Persian and checks Tentacruel and Agility + Wrap Dragonite. Even though Haunter takes no damage from Wrap against Pokemon like Tentacruel and Dragonite, it is still immobilized. This gives the opponent an opportunity to switch into a strong physical attacker like Dugtrio, which forces Haunter to switch out or get KOed, putting a large amount of strain on the team's defensive integrity. Being immobilized by Wrap isn't inherently bad, though, as the foe loses PP, can't make concrete progress, and gives you an opportunity to predict their switch-in with one of your own. Pairing Haunter with Flying-types like Articuno can create a solid immunity core; Haunter can pivot into Normal-type attacks, and it can switch back to the Flying-type partner if it is threatened by Earthquake, keeping momentum. Once a threat is at around half HP, Explosion can usually take it out, which should be considered when Haunter is on its last sliver of health. Even if Explosion fails to KO, a heavy dent can let threats like Persian and Articuno push the advantage.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/rby-ou-viability-rankings.3685861/post-10591542\">2025 RBY OU Viability Rankings Update</a>, the Partial Trapping ban, and the unbans of Lapras, Hypno, and Articuno from RBY UU. As a result, it may contain outdated information.</p> <hr /> <p>Electrode holds a highly specific niche in the RBY UU metagame. As the game's fastest Pokemon, Electrode is nearly guaranteed to attack before fainting if it enters the battle safely, even if it doesn't have the most diverse attacks. This Speed most notably allows Electrode to pressure quick tier mainstays like Tentacruel and Dugtrio. Its high Speed also blesses it with a 27.3% critical hit chance, which can elevate its weak attacks to extreme heights; for example, a critical hit Explosion will always OHKO Hypno. Its Speed and Thunder Wave make it an above average switch into Wrap users as well. These attributes also enable Electrode to be used as a lead or even a sweeper in some cases.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Electrode’s flaws are abundant and quite detrimental. Outside of Explosion, Electrode has very few distinctive moves for an Electric-type Pokemon. Without Body Slam or Double-Edge, let alone any diverse coverage move, Electrode is forced to use moves like Take Down just to damage Ground-type Pokemon. Electrode's offenses are also inferior to those of its main competitors, Electabuzz and Raichu. These flaws culminate into Electrode being relatively easy to wall and KO. As such, using Electrode often boils down to attacking once or twice and then trying to get lucky with Explosion. It is a high-risk Pokemon that requires accurate predictions and a little bit of luck to reap a proportionate reward.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder is an option open to every Electric-type Pokemon so they can hit a little harder at the cost of some accuracy. Two notable benchmarks for Electrode's Thunder include a possible 2HKO against Vaporeon and a guaranteed 2HKO against Tentacruel, which Thunderbolt misses and only has a 5.4% chance to do, respectively.</p> <p>Electrode has a number of defensive options such as Light Screen and Rest. These can be used to improve a few particular matchups, such as against other Electric-types. Rest is notable for curing Electrode of paralysis, which is usually fatal for it. Overall, offensive options tend to be a lot more useful.</p> <p>Substitute can be helpful on such a prediction-reliant Pokemon. For example, it can serve as a nice midground play in situations like the Dugtrio matchup. If Dugtrio switches, Electrode can attack more freely on the next turn, and if Dugtrio attacks, Electrode will suffer a smaller penalty. However, like the defensive options, it is difficult to find a spot for Substitute.</p> <p>Flash can be somewhat useful at motivating the foe to switch and can hinder Wrap users. However, Screech and Thunder Wave tend to accomplish these goals better and have superior accuracy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon are pretty tricky for Electrode because they pressure it to use a weak Normal-type move or Explosion. Golem is Electrode’s worst nightmare because it takes roughly 20% from Explosion. Golem can switch into Electrode freely and repeatedly, and then fire off a free STAB attack or set up a Substitute. Electrode can threaten Dugtrio with Explosion, but Dugtrio can survive the attack two-thirds of the time and is relatively unafraid of a paralyzed Electrode.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis is a death sentence for Electrode. Electrode is incredibly reliant on its Speed, so taking that away exposes its middling defenses. Paralyzed Electrode can be easily KOed by wallbreakers and sweepers like Dugtrio, Kangaskhan, Persian, Articuno, and so on. Additionally, the 25% chance of full paralysis may also keep a weakened Electrode from using Explosion before it is KOed.</p> <p><strong>Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon</strong>: While not quite as bad as Ground-type Pokemon, Grass-type Pokemon also wall Electrode. Thunderbolt deals very little damage to Pokemon like Tangela and Venusaur, so they can goad it into using Explosion. Additionally, status moves like Sleep Powder and Stun Spore will hamper Electrode’s usefulness. Electric-type Pokemon similarly resist Thunderbolt and can paralyze Electrode. While neither really wants to take Thunder Wave, Electabuzz and Raichu have better coverage moves than Electrode, so they will generally win one-on-one or force Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Explosion</strong>: Aside from Golem, most common Rock- and Ghost-type Pokemon do not want to switch into Electrode. However, having them on a team can still make Electrode hesitate to use Explosion, into which they switch fairly comfortably.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Fast Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is pretty much Electrode's only reliable source of damage. Electrode isn't the strongest user of Thunderbolt, but it can still hit common Pokemon like Tentacruel, Dodrio, and bulky Water-type Pokemon for good damage, especially if it scores a critical hit. Assuming the opponent lacks a Ground-type Pokemon, Electrode can reliably paralyze any foe thanks to its high Speed. This is particularly useful for slowing down Agility sweepers like Articuno and Dragonite. Electrode's reliance on Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave encourages Ground-type Pokemon to switch in, so it is wise to run Pokemon that can capitalize on this, such as Gyarados, Poliwrath, and Tangela. Hypno is also likely to switch in against Electrode, making fast sleep users such as Venusaur good partners as well.</p> <p>Explosion is Electrode’s main selling point. While Electrode’s base Attack stat of 50 is underwhelming, Explosion is still quite strong, especially if it happens to be a critical hit. Explosion has many desirable targets, such as Dugtrio, Hypno, Tentacruel, and Kadabra, the last of which will always be KOed. However, there are also many Pokemon that Electrode doesn’t want to hit, such as Rock-type Pokemon, sleeping and frozen Pokemon, and, worst of all, Haunter. Electrode is thus a very prediction-heavy Pokemon. As an example, suppose Electrode is face-to-face with Dugtrio. Explosion can OHKO Dugtrio, especially if Dugtrio took a little chip damage. Dugtrio will deal a minimum of 73% to Electrode with Earthquake. This creates a 50/50 situation of whether Dugtrio will switch out in fear of Explosion or stay in and hope Electrode overpredicts by using something else. Electrode creates situations like this a lot, especially if it is played in the mid- or late-game. Using Electrode effectively often means making some bold (or lucky) predictions or spending a lot of effort so these predictions aren’t necessary. This volatility can help Electrode take down some important targets with little issue but also risks it fainting for naught. If Electrode does hit its desired target, it establishes a better position for its teammates. For example, blowing up on Tentacruel or Hypno might help Articuno sweep, while hitting Dugtrio should keep Pokemon like Kadabra and Raichu safe.</p> <p>Screech helps Electrode get the most out of its Explosion. While the move may suffer from an unimpressive accuracy of 84.4%, over half the Pokemon prominent in the RBY UU metagame may or will faint to Electrode's Explosion after Screech. Not only will key offensive Pokemon like Tentacruel, Dugtrio, and Persian be guaranteed to faint, but bulkier Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Vaporeon, and Gyarados have a chance as well. This threat incentivizes foes to switch without actually forcing Electrode to blow up, allowing it to potentially use Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave uncontested or bring in a teammate more safely. Screech is also remarkably useful in situations where the foe is unwilling or unable to switch, like after it has used a stat-boosting move or when it is the last Pokemon remaining. In these cases, Electrode can be more confident that it will be able to deal large amounts of damage to its desired target.</p> <p>Despite Screech's benefits, it is still viable to run an arbitrary Normal-type attack just so Electrode can hit Ground-type foes without KOing itself. Take Down can be fairly strong with a critical hit, but it is otherwise a painfully mediocre move with low accuracy as well as recoil, and Hyper Beam, while powerful, can leave Electrode susceptible to being paralyzed or KOed if it fails to KO the foe first.</p> <p>Finally, it is worth noting that Electrode can serve as a lead. This is partially because Electrode has much trouble switching into most Pokemon. While not as consistent as more traditional choices, Electrode can break a few holes earlier in the match and help its teammates arrange a sweep by mixing up options like fast Thunder Wave, STAB Thunderbolt, and powerful Explosion. Conversely, Electrode's high Speed makes it a decent late-game sweeper as well. However, its poor coverage tends to make Pokemon like Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Agility users superior options for the role.</p>"

As a result, it may contain outdated information.</p> <hr /> <h3>Overview</h3> <p>Upon first glance, it may be difficult to ascertain why any player would even consider using Tangela in a competitive match. It has very little offensive presence, a limited movepool, and a Speed lower than even Vaporeon. It is also quite vulnerable to Wrap users and Ice-type moves, both of which are rather common in the tier. It makes sense that Tangela was first perceived as little more than a gimmick.</p> <p>While Tangela is still far from a staple, it has begun to establish itself in the tier because it compresses a precise combination of desirable traits. For starters, the pure Grass typing makes Tangela a strong check to Earthquake users like Dugtrio and Golem without picking up a weakness to Rock Slide. It similarly prepares Tangela to check Electric-types like Electabuzz and Raichu. Sleep Powder is a blessing in a tier where the few other sleep inducers largely rely on the rather inaccurate Hypnosis, making Tangela more reliable and freeing up Hypnosis users to explore alternative sets and play more aggressively. Additionally, Tangela's access to Stun Spore lets it stymie opposing sweepers and Wrap users, such as Dugtrio and Tentacruel, while also enabling friendly sweepers and Wrap users. Stun Spore is also notable for being the only move that can paralyze Dugtrio behind a Substitute. Finally, while it is not on the level of defensive staples like Vaporeon and Omastar, Tangela can be a makeshift check to a lot of common sweepers when at full health. Normal-type Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Persian usually win the matchup but tend to fear paralysis. Tangela does not fit on every team by any means, but its unique combination of defensive and supportive traits can make it the perfect choice on a select few, rather potent teams.</p> <p>Even with all of these positives, Tangela still has many flaws and can be easily exploited by many Pokemon. Tangela's extremely low Speed makes it easy to chip down with Wrap and revenge kill. Its Grass typing also leaves it vulnerable to Ice-type moves from the likes of Articuno and the tier’s many Water-type Pokemon, as well as Dodrio’s Drill Peck. Poor offensive options also leave it nearly unable to touch some Pokemon, including Dragonite, Haunter, and other Grass-type Pokemon. Finally, Sleep Powder's and Stun Spore's imperfect accuracy can occasionally mean the difference between a win and a loss. Thus, Tangela should only be used when its unique role compression cannot be replicated by other team members.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>By far the most enticing option in Tangela’s toolkit is a Swords Dance set with Body Slam, Hyper Beam, or both. However, boosting is really difficult in RBY UU, especially when neither Speed nor a defensive stat is rising. Moreover, Tangela’s Attack stat and physical movepool are dismal, making such a set underwhelming even in ideal conditions.</p> <p>When experimenting with different sets for Tangela, generally refrain from removing Tangela's status moves, especially Sleep Powder. This keeps it from being outclassed by other defensive Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Once Tangela uses Stun Spore against Haunter, it is virtually incapable of further threatening it. Haunter resists or is immune to every single move Tangela can learn. Even if Tangela somehow maximizes its Special with Growth, Mega Drain can only sometimes score a 4HKO. Haunter, on the other hand, scores an easy 4HKO with Night Shade or a 5HKO or better with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: All of the tier’s prominent Flying-type Pokemon threaten Tangela. Much like Haunter, Dragonite is simply not afraid of any move that Tangela can throw at it. Dragonite can use its superior Speed to work Tangela’s health down with Wrap and easily put it away with Blizzard or any powerful physical attack, possibly even leaving the entire exchange unscathed. Articuno similarly fears none any of Tangela’s attacks, and its incredibly strong Blizzard boasts an impressive 51.3% chance to simply OHKO Tangela. The rare Moltres functions nearly identically and takes even less from Mega Drain. Dodrio does fear paralysis and doesn't have Wrap to avoid getting hit like Dragonite, but it can easily revenge kill Tangela, as Drill Peck is a clean 2HKO. Gyarados has the least desirable matchup of the Flying-type Pokemon but can still 2HKO with Blizzard provided Tangela doesn’t reclaim too much health with Mega Drain.</p> <p><strong>Grass-, Bug-, and Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: While these Pokemon are a fair deal less common than the Pokemon discussed above, they still check Tangela thoroughly. While it admittedly can’t do much in return, Venusaur shrugs off virtually any hit Tangela can throw at it. Venomoth likewise takes very little damage from Tangela and can threaten paralysis or possibly 5HKO with Psychic. Yet again, Pinsir is unafraid of Tangela’s moves and can pivot out with Bind, set up with Swords Dance, or 3HKO it outright with Slash. Fire-types, while exceedingly uncommon, will check Tangela and claim 2HKOs or OHKOs with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves</strong>: Outside of Articuno and Dragonite, Tangela can beat most users of Ice-type moves with status or Mega Drain. However, every major user of Blizzard or Ice Beam aside from Omastar is faster than Tangela and thus can pressure it, especially if it has taken a few hits or hasn't used Growth yet. So long as these Pokemon aren't paralyzed, they are capable of revenge killing Tangela or even winning one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel</strong>: While Tentacruel would prefer not to risk getting paralyzed, it is more than capable of handling Tangela. Like Dragonite, Tentacruel can easily whittle Tangela down with Wrap and finish it off with a powerful Blizzard.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set allows Tangela to function as a pivot. Sleep Powder and Stun Spore are more or less essential to any variant of Tangela. These two moves give it a significant amount of utility, allowing it to punish switch ins and enable its teammates to sweep. Even with Bind, Tangela is largely outclassed by other prominent Dugtrio checks like Dragonite and Gyarados if it chooses not to run both status moves. Bind functions just like Wrap, albeit with slightly lower accuracy, dealing chip damage and generating safe switches. Due to Tangela's low speed, Bind is most useful against paralyzed targets, though Tangela can usually afford to take a hit before using Bind if it must. Body Slam is very weak from Tangela, but it hits most targets neutrally and threatens paralysis. Mega Drain is similarly weak, but can hit a few targets for super effective damage and get Tangela a little health back in the process. Omastar and Golem are particularly fearful of Mega Drain, which is likely to 2HKO both. Rest serves to make Tangela a more complete wall but makes it even less offensively threatening. Due to Tangela having essentially no offensive presence with Rest, it may be worth running Body Slam or Mega Drain over Bind.</p>"

      "Defensive Growth": {"description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set is a slightly more offensive take on the traditionally defensive Pokemon. Growth slowly boosts both Tangela's offensive and defensive prowess. While some Pokemon like Dragonite and Haunter are still not fazed by Tangela’s offenses, this set can bully some defensive Pokemon. Examples include Hypno and Vaporeon, especially if they have been paralyzed; unless they can land a critical hit, Tangela is relatively free to boost with Growth while both dealing damage and regaining health with Mega Drain. The threat of Stun Spore crippling a teammate pressures these Pokemon from switching out. Sleep Powder is always a useful move and allows Tangela to accomplish something even when it can’t quite get going with Growth. Moreover, after successfully using Sleep Powder, Tangela can use Stun Spore to potentially punish a switch-in looking to keep Tangela from setting up with Growth.</p>"}

    "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/rby-ou-viability-rankings.3685861/post-10591542\">2025 RBY OU Viability Rankings Update</a>, the Partial Trapping ban, and the unbans of Lapras, Hypno, and Articuno from RBY UU. As a result, it may contain outdated information.</p> <hr /> <p>Kangaskhan is one of the strongest Normal-type attackers in RBY UU, featuring a wide arsenal of attacking options that help it excel as the tier's most terrifying wallbreaker. Fitting on many offensive teams, it can blow past any Pokemon with Hyper Beam from around 60% HP. It has great coverage too: even the dreaded Articuno, which it outspeeds, is 2HKOed by Rock Slide. The damage that Kangaskhan dishes out is enough to knock many Pokemon into KO range for revenge killers like Dugtrio—if it doesn't just KO them outright—making defensive threats like Vaporeon and Hypno very wary. It is an extremely difficult Pokemon to switch into, arguably having no counters. Not only that, Kangaskhan has incredible physical bulk, allowing it to take minimal damage from Wrap and serve as a minor check to Dugtrio. Kangaskhan is quite customizable for teams as well, possessing interesting options such as Counter.</p> <p>Despite these incredible positives, Kangaskhan isn't an automatic addition to teams. Its special bulk is simply horrific, leaving it at least possibly 2HKOed by many of the strong special attacks thrown around in the tier, such as Articuno's Blizzard and Tentacruel's Surf. Worse still, it falls short in Speed, being slower than tier-king Tentacruel; factoring in its special fragility, this leaves it easily revenge killed. These factors make Kangaskhan sweeping on its own quite rare, so it will often be reserved to exploiting slower, sleeping, or paralyzed Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute is notable, as Kangaskhan's 103 HP Substitutes can tank Night Shade from Haunter, as well as Seismic Toss from Hypno and Kadabra, while easing prediction. However, they will normally default to other moves, such as Thunder Wave or Hypnosis, making the option largely moot. Surf allows Kangaskhan to 2HKO Golem and 3HKO Aerodactyl but has no utility otherwise. Kangaskhan can amp up its damage output with Double-Edge to 3HKO Hypno—or even Mega Kick to 3HKO Vaporeon—but whatever move gets replaced will often be sorely missed; replacing Body Slam makes Kangaskhan far more reliant on paralysis support, and eschewing coverage is generally not advised.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis is the main obstacle to Kangaskhan's success, as it aims to take advantage of slower Pokemon like Vaporeon, as well as paralyzed Pokemon, and tear them down. Paralysis not only makes such interactions impossible but also exposes Kangaskhan's awful special bulk. Pokemon like Articuno, Gyarados, Omastar, Vaporeon, and Venusaur blow paralyzed Kangaskhan away with their strong STAB moves. As such, paralysis inducers such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, and Hypno are to be avoided unless Kangaskhan is in a position where it can KO them first. There will be many times where Kangaskhan will KO something mid-game and subsequently be forced out by one of these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel</strong>: Tentacruel outspeeds Kangaskhan and has an 82% chance to 2HKO it with Surf. Furthermore, Tentacruel is capable of chipping Kangaskhan into 2HKO range with just one Wrap use, which is what makes the Speed factor so dangerous; while Kangaskhan is absolutely capable of using Earthquake to 2HKO Tentacruel, it cannot do so quickly enough without Tentacruel being paralyzed first or happening to miss Wrap. Even then, Tentacruel may simply go for the Surf 2HKO, as the odds aren't terrible with even a little chip damage. It should be noted that Kangaskhan's Hyper Beam deals more damage than Earthquake, and can KO Tentacruel from 56.4% or less.</p> <p><strong>Tangela</strong>: Tangela isn't afraid of switching into Kangaskhan, not even fearing a critical hit Hyper Beam. Not only does it shrug off these generally nuclear blows, but it can also threaten with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore in return, both of which put an end to Kangaskhan's rampage. Furthermore, if Kangaskhan has been put to sleep, Tangela sets up Growth with impunity, making its Mega Drain noticeably more threatening. Finally, with Bind, Tangela can exploit paralyzed Kangaskhan relatively well, chipping it into KO range and pivoting to its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: If Kangaskhan lacks Rock Slide, Articuno is a very deadly threat to its success. Even Ice Beam from Articuno can 2HKO it, and Blizzard makes it impossible to switch Kangaskhan into anything later. If Kangaskhan does have Rock Slide, Articuno is threatened with a 2HKO, though Kangaskhan will be damaged heavily by Blizzard in the process. Without Rock Slide, Kangaskhan can only win with a critical hit Body Slam followed up by Hyper Beam. If Articuno has set up Agility and hasn't been damaged, even Rock Slide Kangaskhan cannot win without getting extremely lucky.</p> <p><strong>Counter Users</strong>: Kangaskhan's wallbreaking prowess comes back to bite it with Counter's existence. There will be many points where a Kangaskhan user has to check for Counter by using Earthquake to force it to fail. Pokemon like opposing Kangaskhan, Hypno, and Poliwrath are occasionally seen using the move. Should Kangaskhan trigger Counter, it will take significant damage. There is also the risk of a Pokemon switching in on Hyper Beam and countering the damage the next turn, which may deal fatal damage.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: While it fears Blizzard, Rock Slide, and Body Slam paralysis, Dragonite can switch into Kangaskhan's STAB moves comfortably. In return, it can threaten with Thunder Wave or a 3HKO from its own Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Aerodactyl</strong>: Aerodactyl is the only Pokemon in the game to resist the combination of Normal- and Ground-type coverage; if Kangaskhan's fourth move doesn't cover it, it becomes a serviceable check. Aerodactyl can use Fire Blast to attempt to burn Kangaskhan in this situation, which is a death sentence if it works. The damage isn't small either; it's a guaranteed 4HKO. However, if Kangaskhan does cover Aerodactyl with Blizzard or Rock Slide, it's generally fine. The risk of Body Slam paralysis is very large for Aerodactyl, which makes it very risky to check Kangaskhan with it.</p>",

      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>The combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam will KO Electabuzz, Persian, and Dugtrio. Furthermore, Hyper Beam alone will OHKO Kadabra, and it has a minute chance to OHKO Dugtrio. Body Slam is crucial for Kangaskhan's success outside of damage, as paralyzing a switch-in will often lead to Kangaskhan beating it outright. Earthquake covers Haunter and Omastar, which are 2HKOed and 3HKOed. It further covers Electric-types like Electabuzz and Raichu as well, which are also 2HKOed. Lastly, Earthquake makes it much easier for Kangaskhan to scout for Counter users like opposing Kangaskhan and Poliwrath, which can be the difference between winning or losing the game.</p> <p>Kangaskhan's fourth move is largely dependent on its team and what threats the player wants it to cover. No option is truly better than the other. Rock Slide will 3HKO Gyarados and Aerodactyl as well as 2HKO Articuno, the latter of which otherwise wins consistently due to its nuclear Blizzard. Counter enables Kangaskhan to use its high HP to check Normal-type attackers, heavily deterring the use of moves like Body Slam, Hyper Beam, and Slash. It also gives Kangaskhan some extra utility, as switching into Hyper Beam and countering during the recharge can be a very strong tactic. Blizzard acts as coverage for Dragonite, 2HKOing it; however, Kangaskhan should be wary of taking a Thunder Wave if attempting this. Blizzard also 3HKOes Aerodactyl, Tangela, and Golem, the latter of which takes more damage than it would from Earthquake. It should not be used against Venusaur or Victreebel, as they take more damage from Body Slam.</p> <p>Kangaskhan is a wallbreaker at heart and should mostly be kept to this role. Kangaskhan is one of the best ways to punish Rest in the tier, and taking advantage of this is often key to its success: it's capable of 3HKOing even Hypno with two Body Slam uses followed up by Hyper Beam. Alternatively, Body Slam can 3HKO it a third of the time anyway. Similarly, a paralyzed Kadabra attempting to use Recover provides Kangaskhan with the perfect opportunity to switch in for free and threaten to OHKO it with Hyper Beam. Switching in on Seismic Toss against paralyzed Hypno or Kadabra is also valid, as they're forced to take a heavy hit from Kangaskhan. Kangaskhan is excellent at punishing greedy setup as well, switching in on Pokemon like Dodrio as they use Agility to completely reverse the game's momentum. It can also punish players looking to use Hyper Beam to finish Pokemon off early; Kangaskhan's amazing physical bulk allows it to switch in and punish the recharge with massive damage, even if it lacks Counter. It's good to switch Kangaskhan in after having a partner use Rest too, as players attempting to exploit the Rest will often switch in Pokemon like Persian and Dugtrio, which Kangaskhan excels against. The damage Kangaskhan can deal to a team is immense, so determining when it's appropriate to glean value from it early- to mid-game while avoiding paralysis is an important fundamental for players to learn.</p> <p>Kangaskhan appreciates paralysis support, as well as a reliable sleeper, though neither of these is necessarily required. Consequently, paralysis inducers such as Hypno, Dragonite, Kadabra, and Electabuzz are good partners. Kangaskhan pairs well with other sweepers—particularly those that are stonewalled by a particular Pokemon, including Articuno, Dugtrio, Dodrio, and Persian. Kangaskhan is very capable of overwhelming Pokemon like Haunter, Omastar, and Vaporeon, which typically stand in the way of at least one of these examples. Always remember to fine-tune teams in response to Kangaskhan's fourth move; for example, pairing Counter Kangaskhan with users of Explosion, such as Golem and Haunter, lets you smash a KOed Pokemon's replacement by countering your own Explosion. Haunter particularly pairs well, as it and Kangaskhan together can minimize Wrap's damage to a team by PP stalling it. Haunter also provides the aforementioned sleep support to shut down a potential check, such as Hypno or Kadabra. It can also lure in Pokemon that really don't want to fight Kangaskhan, like Dugtrio. Tangela is a suitable partner for its ease of spreading paralysis, good Dugtrio matchup, and amazing bulk allowing Kangaskhan to be significantly more aggressive. This role compression often gives space for more powerful Kangaskhan partners, such as Articuno and Dugtrio. Venusaur can act similarly to Tangela while further appreciating Kangaskhan's presence, as double switching to Kangaskhan punishes its usual Psychic-type switch-ins hard.</p>"

As a result, it may contain outdated information.</p> <hr /> <p>Electabuzz is the premier Electric-type in RBY UU thanks to its base 105 Speed, which lets it outspeed tier-king Tentacruel and force it out with Thunder Wave. Its Speed also grants it an impressive 20.51% critical hit rate, making it difficult to consistently wall. Additionally, Electabuzz is blessed with good coverage in Psychic and Body Slam, which gives it a variety of ways to check threats like Dugtrio, Tangela, and Venusaur. Naturally, this also makes Electabuzz effective late-game, making Pokemon like Articuno and Dodrio think twice before going for a sweep. With its strong hit-and-run playstyle, proactive gameplay is key to being successful with Electabuzz.</p> <p>However, Electabuzz can be inconsistent, which makes it a bit difficult to use on teams. It struggles while paralyzed, so it cannot typically stay in against common Thunder Wave users such as Kadabra and Hypno and struggles against Body Slam users like Gyarados, Vaporeon, and Omastar that it otherwise matches well against. Its Special is unimpressive against neutral- or high-Special targets, with its Thunderbolt only 3HKOing Tentacruel and Vaporeon and dealing less damage than Seismic Toss on average against Hypno. Furthermore, Electabuzz lacks reliable recovery—unlike Kadabra, which operates similarly—while being 2HKOed and 3HKOed by most physical and special attackers, respectively, making it very easy to wear down. The massive presence of Dugtrio is very problematic for Electabuzz as well, with it constantly switching in on Thunderbolt and threatening a KO from Earthquake with minimal prior damage. Electabuzz also competes with Raichu, which has Surf, Agility, and higher Attack and Special; however, outrunning Tentacruel and having Psychic usually makes Electabuzz the better choice, especially as a lead.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Electabuzz has an incredible movepool, fine-tuning it is often a misguided attempt that makes it easier to counter than it should be. Changing its listed coverage can be very difficult to justify, as it covers every Pokemon in the tier. Mega Kick can replace Seismic Toss, as it 2HKOes Kadabra while doing more damage to Hypno and opposing Electabuzz. However, it does less damage to Tangela and has only 74.6% accuracy. Hyper Beam performs similarly and has higher accuracy, which may make it more enticing, but Raichu often runs it more effectively thanks to its superior Attack stat. Substitute can scout an attack or an opponent's switch-in without needing to predict, and Electabuzz can use it to fish for full paralysis and a free chance to attack. However, Electabuzz can only take advantage of Substitute late-game when Pokemon that spread status like Hypno and Kadabra are either KOed or able to be KOed with one attack. Submission may seem enticing to damage Normal-types and Golem, but Thunderbolt or Psychic, respectively, damages them more consistently as a result of better accuracy, making it difficult to recommend. Counter can sneak an OHKO on Persian using Slash, but in this situation, Electabuzz should be going for Thunder Wave paralysis.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types are immune to Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt while dealing massive damage back with STAB Earthquake. Dugtrio outspeeds Electabuzz and can OHKO with a critical hit Earthquake, and without a critical hit if Electabuzz has taken even slight damage. Alternatively, Dugtrio can predict Electabuzz switching out to set up a Substitute. However, Dugtrio fears Body Slam's paralysis and doesn't like taking chip damage, so it struggles to switch in. Meanwhile, Golem is only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss and Psychic, so it can come in fairly safely and force Electabuzz out. Golem then has the opportunity to set up a Substitute, use Explosion, scout with Body Slam, or just get off decent damage with a STAB move. However, it can't repeatedly switch in should Electabuzz predict correctly, which can force it to use Explosion noticeably earlier, and Special drops can make Psychic a 3HKO.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Electabuzz struggles to damage Grass-types and hates getting statused, making Tangela and Venusaur great checks. Tangela carries Stun Spore in addition to Sleep Powder and isn't weak to any of Electabuzz's attacks, making it generally a better check. However, Venusaur does have more offensive power—Razor Leaf is a clean 3HKO—and may do more for a team overall.</p> <p><strong>Hypno</strong>: Hypno is the best Electabuzz check that does not resist Thunderbolt. It can paralyze Electabuzz or put it to sleep while not worrying about Electabuzz's own Thunder Wave. Hypno sometimes even prefers being paralyzed so that it cannot be put to sleep later on. Hypno also has good bulk, only being 4HKOed by Seismic Toss and sometimes Thunderbolt. Meanwhile, it can 3HKO Electabuzz with Psychic, and any drop to Electabuzz's underwhelming Special is a very bad situation for it. However, if Hypno is caught using Rest, Electabuzz can be very dangerous, as a single critical hit can force Hypno to use Rest again; this opens it up for wallbreakers like Kangaskhan to switch in and finish the job.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Electabuzz relies on its Speed, so paralyzing it greatly cripples its effectiveness, exposing its decidedly mediocre bulk. Therefore, the mere possibility of getting paralyzed often forces it out, giving momentum to Thunder Wave and Body Slam users like Clefable, Kadabra, Hypno, Kangaskhan, and even some Dragonite variants. However, many Body Slam users, such as Vaporeon and Omastar, greatly fear Electabuzz's STAB Thunderbolt. In a pinch, though, they can fight back and hope for a Body Slam paralysis, especially in Vaporeon's case, since Thunderbolt only 3HKOes it. Non-Seismic Toss variants of Electabuzz will struggle to punish a Tangela switch-in, allowing it to get off Stun Spore with impunity.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: While Electabuzz has fantastic coverage, it tends to struggle with opposing Electric-types. Opposing Electabuzz, Raichu, and Electrode may trade Thunder Wave with it while resisting Thunderbolt. Raichu also notably outdamages Electabuzz, possessing a higher Special stat, Surf, and Hyper Beam. Electrode doesn't entirely mind paralysis, as possessing Explosion means it always has some kind of value; however, it may become forced to use Explosion against Electabuzz in some scenarios, which may not be a favorable trade, as there are vastly better targets like Hypno and Tentacruel. Overall, if Electabuzz needs to be slowed down, going for a paralysis trade with your own Electric-type is absolutely fine.</p>",

      "Offensive (old)": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>A fast Thunder Wave is Electabuzz's claim to fame and forms its main role in tandem with Thunderbolt: paralyzing fast Pokemon and breaking through bulky Water- and Flying-types such as Gyarados and Dodrio. This paves the way for sweepers like Dugtrio and Articuno while also making wrappers like Tentacruel and Dragonite more devastating, providing massive momentum in the long run and often choking the opponent out of options late-game. Electabuzz's Thunderbolt is quite threatening, being one of few moves to have a reasonable chance to OHKO Gyarados, 76.9%; it also 2HKOes Dodrio, Dewgong, and Omastar. Being faster than Tentacruel and having Thunder Wave also makes Electabuzz incredible at forcing the opponent into predictable switches, particularly to Dugtrio, Hypno, and Tangela; those switches are ripe for exploitation, making a well-played Electabuzz a massive late-game threat, especially when factoring in being faster than Tentacruel.</p> <p>Body Slam gives Electabuzz an effective midground option, notably letting it paralyze Dugtrio switching in. It also does decent damage to physically frail Pokemon like Kadabra, especially with Electabuzz's good critical hit rate. When one is unsure about using Thunder Wave, Body Slam is normally the best option. Psychic provides another midground option that covers Haunter and Tentacruel more effectively; getting a Special drop can make Thunderbolt significantly more threatening as well, giving a near-guaranteed KO on Tentacruel after Psychic damage. It's also helpful for hitting Venusaur and Haunter super effectively, which are common problems for most Electric-types. Another less appreciated boon is that if you use Electabuzz to trade paralysis, Psychic Special drops reapply the foe's paralysis Speed drop; this allows Electabuzz to muscle past with Thunderbolt thereafter. Seismic Toss can be used over either Body Slam or Psychic to deal more damage to Golem, Hypno, and Tangela on average.</p> <p>Electabuzz should ideally play hit-and-run because of its distaste for paralysis, but it can also trade paralysis if the team doesn't rely on its offensive prowess and speed control. However, a late-game sweep should never be counted out, as Electabuzz is excellent in simplified game states, gradually picking off limping Pokemon. It is ideal to bring Electabuzz in through a teammate's Wrap or on an opposing Pokemon using Rest, as it's frail and generally wants to stay healthy for late-game. Predicting an opponent's switch to Tentacruel or Gyarados can also be effective; Articuno and Dugtrio are good Pokemon to use for baiting these in. Electabuzz should generally use Thunder Wave whenever you are confident that a fast Pokemon, like Tentacruel or Persian, will stay in to attack. Finding these opportunities is important because Hypno often switches into Electabuzz, stealing momentum and using paralysis sustained from Thunder Wave to block further status.</p> <p>Electabuzz can be used as a lead; this is primarily for the common Tentacruel matchup. Because it outspeeds and paralyzes Tentacruel, Tentacruel is forced out immediately, giving Electabuzz an uncontested Thunder Wave, switch, or damage opportunity. In this situation, Body Slam is the most appropriate as a midground option, covering their switch while dealing decent damage with a chance of paralysis. Thunder Wave is also useful to status sleep leads like Haunter and Venusaur, as well as rarer leads like Dodrio. Lead Electabuzz tends to be less valuable, so sacrificing it to sleep is often the appropriate option, sparing more valuable common teammates like Tentacruel, Hypno, and Kadabra. On teams where Electabuzz is okay with being paralyzed, it can trade paralysis with Kadabra and attempt to break through it with Seismic Toss as well, though Electabuzz is at a disadvantage due to a lack of recovery, so switching to a paralysis absorber like Hypno or Vaporeon is recommended instead. Against Hypno, sacking Electabuzz for sleep or trading Thunder Wave is valid because, in the prior case, it can be woken up through Tentacruel's Wrap with relative ease later on, and for the latter case, it is capable of muscling past paralyzed Hypno through critical hits. However, while it may seem enticing to use Thunder Wave against Hypno right away, this often invites Dugtrio in, so using Body Slam is usually more reliable.</p> <p>Electabuzz is best used on teams that are already efficient at checking Dugtrio while having a strong offensive backbone. The best way to facilitate this situation is with Flying-types like Aerodactyl, Articuno, Dragonite, and Gyarados—and, to a lesser extent, Tangela—which check Dugtrio by forcing it to think twice before it uses Earthquake. These Pokemon also invite Tentacruel in, which Electabuzz feasts on. Articuno is particularly valuable, as Electabuzz breaking through Water- and Grass-types is instrumental in allowing it to sweep late-game, making the pair a strong offensive core. Wallbreakers such as Dodrio, Kangaskhan, and Persian take advantage of Hypno using Rest, a key part of gaining momentum in RBY UU, and Electabuzz spreads paralysis for them. Dodrio also has a great matchup against Grass-types like Venusaur and Tangela, as well as an immunity to Earthquake to set up on Dugtrio, making it among the best Normal-type Electabuzz partners. Kangaskhan is also helpful against Dugtrio thanks to its high physical bulk and appreciates Electabuzz paralyzing its checks for it to wallbreak later on. While used on almost every team, Tentacruel can bait opposing Tentacruel in very frequently, and its Wrap support is instrumental in allowing Electabuzz to enter the game safely, making it an especially perfect partner. While similar to Electabuzz, Kadabra is also a great partner, forming a strong special attacking core that can overwhelm common Hypno + Kadabra cores; trading Electabuzz with one of them lets Kadabra and Hypno teammates wreak havoc. Finally, Venusaur performs excellently alongside Electabuzz, being a fine Pokemon to double switch into when predicting the opponent will go to Hypno or Dugtrio, getting a free sleep move off as to enable Electabuzz to switch in later; this can be done as early as turn 1 one with lead Electabuzz.</p>"

  "Pinsir": {
    "overview": "<p>Pinsir has a unique place in RBY UU thanks to its access to Bind, decent Speed, and potentially massive damage output by virtue of Slash and Swords Dance. Its Bug typing provides it with a resistance to Earthquake; this makes it work well alongside Tentacruel and Electric-types like Electabuzz and Raichu, especially when checking Dugtrio for them. Pinsir's biggest selling point, however, is its sheer threat level should it boost with Swords Dance, which allows it to flatten paralyzed teams. Few Pokemon can switch into Pinsir's +2 Hyper Beam; some standout calculations include a 41% chance to OHKO Tentacruel and a 2.6% chance to OHKO Hypno. This makes Pinsir a particularly brutal punishment for Pokemon that are often forced to use Rest, such as Vaporeon and Hypno. While not perfect, Pinsir's Speed lets it outpace Dragonite and Hypno, which makes it great at revenge killing them. Further, having a partial trapping move faster than Dragonite can be crucial in many situations, allowing Pinsir to keep Dragonite from setting up with Agility and switch to a counter, such as Tentacruel, for free. Bind allows Pinsir to form a partial trapping core alongside Tentacruel and Dragonite as well, providing teams with significant momentum, especially if the opposing team is stricken with paralysis.</p> <p>As with almost any Bug-type in RBY, though, Pinsir is held back by some severe flaws. Pinsir has no STAB attacks to speak of and is forced to rely only on Normal- and Fighting-type moves. It thus competes with the Normal-type attackers of the metagame—Persian, Dodrio, and Kangaskhan—for a place on teams. Pinsir's Normal and Fighting reliance also makes it completely invalidated by Haunter, which forces it to switch or pivot out with Bind. It also struggles with Rock-types if it lacks Submission, and its weakness to Rock Slide doesn't help there. While Pinsir's Speed helps in some minor ways, it just isn't good enough: Pinsir is outpaced by common threats like Tentacruel, Dodrio and Kadabra, which are very capable of threatening it due to its mediocre typing or low Special. As a result, Pinsir relies heavily on teams that spread paralysis efficiently, making it somewhat dependent on the player's Hypno to function well. These flaws are only worsened by it being debilitated by paralysis and mandating setup, which can be very difficult to accomplish in the Wrap-infested format. Paralysis isn't the only status to give Pinsir trouble either, as Toxic—a substantially common way to deal with Dragonite—puts a firm cap on Pinsir's use of Bind, causing it to take more damage than it would normally deal, which is only made worse by Bind's inherent inconsistency. Overall, Pinsir has some very strong points in its favor, but it's a high-risk pick that necessitates a team built around it as well as a competent player.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam can allow Pinsir to be more self-sufficient in the paralysis department while denying switches in from faster threats. However, Slash's damage is sorely missed in this case, causing Pinsir to miss out on many potential KOs and become more reliant on Swords Dance. Seismic Toss can be utilized, as it's Pinsir's sole option to hit Haunter, but it does little to help the matchup; switching out or pivoting with Bind is really all Pinsir can do. Toxic can be helpful for dealing with Dragonite, which otherwise uses Pinsir as setup fodder. However, Pinsir doesn't necessarily need Toxic, as it can use Bind to safely bring in a counter, such as Tentacruel.</p> <p>Bind can be cut for moveslot flexibility, but this causes Pinsir to be a severe momentum sink mid-game. Should the opponent reveal Haunter or a Rock-type, Pinsir is forced out and has to have a teammate take a hit for it, which can let the opponent open holes. Switching out with Bind ensures momentum isn't lost, as foes are unable to move, even Haunter. However, with Bind cut, Pinsir becomes more consistent late-game, as it's less reliant on Bind's shaky accuracy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Pinsir can't touch Haunter at all without the largely undesirable Seismic Toss. To make matters worse, Haunter is faster and gets a near-guaranteed 3HKO with Thunderbolt. As such, Pinsir is normally forced to switch out through a manual switch or Bind. It should be noted that Bind still immobilizes Haunter, allowing Pinsir to safely bring in a counter like Dugtrio, so using Bind to catch Haunter switching in is viable counterplay.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: If Pinsir doesn't run Submission, it's forced out by Rock-types. However, if it does, it usually 2HKOes them at +2, albeit with significant recoil damage and questionable reliability. Golem is adept at coming in on Hyper Beam and outright 2HKOes Pinsir with Rock Slide, meaning it wins in this situation even if Pinsir has boosted. Omastar deals up to 72% with Hydro Pump, which can be followed up with Blizzard to dispatch Pinsir. In addition, considering Submission recoil, Omastar can easily 2HKO Pinsir with Surf. Aerodactyl is another particularly solid counter, only facing a near-guaranteed 4HKO from Submission while 2HKOing in return with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Pinsir's special bulk is very poor, so threats like Articuno and Kadabra 2HKO it with their STAB moves. However, these matchups are volatile if Pinsir is at full health. Pinsir Speed ties with Articuno and therefore can potentially win if it's boosted; Slash + Hyper Beam will 2HKO Articuno quite frequently. Against Kadabra, Pinsir can deal up to 91% with Slash alone, and +2 Hyper Beam will always OHKO it unless there's an unfortunate miss. As such, Kadabra is restricted to revenge killing Pinsir, which can be stifled by teammates like Hypno, though Pinsir being forced out isn't necessarily ideal. While they are very rare, Fire-type Pokemon like Moltres greatly threaten Pinsir with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel</strong>: Tentacruel is faster than Pinsir, can pivot out of bothersome situations through Wrap, and heals paralysis with Rest. It's very difficult for Pinsir to set up in games due to the existence of Tentacruel's Wrap, constantly delaying it while chipping Pinsir into KO range. On top of this, Tentacruel is near-guaranteed to 2HKO Pinsir with Surf. However, Pinsir is very capable of exploiting paralyzed Tentacruel, possessing a potential OHKO with +2 Hyper Beam. If Pinsir paralyzes Tentacruel with Body Slam on the switch, Tentacruel is liable to outright lose. Overall, though, this matchup is very unfavorable and using Pinsir against a healthy Tentacruel is strongly discouraged.</p> <p><strong>Dodrio</strong>: Dodrio can revenge kill Pinsir with Drill Peck, 2HKOing it. It can't switch in to save its life though, taking massive damage from Slash, which has a small but notable chance to 2HKO; alternatively, Slash + Hyper Beam is a guaranteed 2HKO. Furthermore, if Pinsir has boosted, it can OHKO Dodrio with Hyper Beam 89.7% of the time. Dodrio can't fight Pinsir at all if it's paralyzed.</p>",

      "Swords Dance Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The premise of the set is simple: set up with Swords Dance and put 'em away. Hyper Beam is Pinsir's claim to fame, KOing Pokemon from around half HP even without setup and becoming an OHKO machine if boosted. Slash gives Pinsir immediate and significant power, but Submission—albeit somewhat inconsistently—allows Pinsir to beat Rock-types that try to switch in on Hyper Beam, as well as deal massive damage to Persian and Kangaskhan. Finally, Bind allows Pinsir to provide its team with momentum while chipping threats into Hyper Beam KO range, which becomes near-effortless against paralyzed teams. When boosted by Swords Dance, Bind can be surprisingly powerful; for example, it can deal up to 10.4% to Hypno per hit, quickly bringing it into KO range.</p> <p>Pinsir can be a fairly unwieldy Pokemon to use, relying on a paralyzed team to sweep reliably. However, it has multiple points of entry, particularly Dugtrio, which it can beat outright, 2HKOing it with Slash and only being 3HKOed by Rock Slide 0.1% of the time. Outside of this, Pinsir can punish paralyzed Pokemon heavily, be it by revenge killing them or switching in on their physical attacks, which is made safer by the potential for full paralysis. Paralysis further benefits Pinsir's Bind, giving it a safety net for its more frequent misses than Wrap. Pinsir is capable of exploiting Pokemon using Rest quite well with Swords Dance, which can potentially mean an outright win depending on the game state. Pinsir fits on teams that appreciate its Ground resistance and physical attacking prowess. This particularly applies to those looking to get the most mileage out of Tentacruel and Electric-types, so long as the team is capable of providing extensive paralysis support in return.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/rby-ou-viability-rankings.3685861/post-10591542\">2025 RBY OU Viability Rankings Update</a>, the Partial Trapping ban, and the unbans of Lapras, Hypno, and Articuno from RBY UU. As a result, it may contain outdated information.</p> <hr /> <p>Gyarados is among the strongest tanks and wallbreakers in RBY UU. Thanks to an impressive base stat total and deep movepool, Gyarados can comfortably stomach powerful attacks and threaten just about the entire tier with a super effective special move or strong physical move. It is equipped to handle many premier defensive and support Pokemon; Blizzard 2HKOes Venusaur and Tangela and can potentially OHKO Dragonite, Thunderbolt puts pressure on Water-type Pokemon like Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar, and the combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam is more than enough to break through Kadabra and Hypno. Gyarados is no slouch against offensive Pokemon as well, boasting a Hydro Pump that can OHKO Dugtrio and 2HKO Kangaskhan and Persian. It is thus a highly customizable Pokemon that can fit on a wide variety of teams.</p> <p>Gyarados is also one of the strongest checks to Dugtrio in the tier. With an immunity to Earthquake and several moves that can OHKO or 2HKO it, Gyarados can switch in against Dugtrio and quickly force it out, sometimes several times in the same game. A healthy Gyarados can confidently prevent a Dugtrio sweep and heavily punish switch-ins with strong moves like Body Slam. Gyarados is also the only Dugtrio check that isn’t weak to Ice, meaning it doesn’t exacerbate a team's weakness to Pokemon like Articuno and Tentacruel nearly as much as other options like Dragonite, Aerodactyl, and Tangela. Versus its closest competitor, Dragonite, Gyarados has an additional point of Speed and STAB Water-type moves. Gyarados can thus reliably revenge kill Dragonite and Venusaur and deal more damage to Pokemon such as Kangaskhan and Haunter.</p> <p>While Gyarados may be able to shake off Blizzard, Thunderbolt absolutely terrifies it. Electabuzz and Raichu are very likely to OHKO Gyarados with the move and Persian, even with its underwhelming Special stat, scores a clean 2HKO. Gyarados’s weakness to Rock can be similarly exploited; while Gyarados is a strong answer to Dugtrio, Rock Slide can deal some hefty damage, especially with a critical hit. Finally, while Gyarados is rather bulky, it lacks any form of reliable recovery, and it isn’t particularly quick. This means that it can be worn down over the course of a match when used too liberally.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Gyarados will most often run Body Slam and Blizzard, it can potentially drop one to run all of Hyper Beam, Thunderbolt, and Hydro Pump. Body Slam is tough to drop because it is a very consistent midground option, but the additional coverage may be desirable if, for example, Gyarados is being used as more of a revenge killer than a defensive piece. Dropping Blizzard leaves Gyarados unequipped to handle Dragonite, as well as Grass-type Pokemon like Venusaur and Tangela.</p> <p>Fire Blast is Gyarados’s strongest move against Articuno, scoring a guaranteed 3HKO. It lacks the same coverage as Blizzard, failing to handle Dragonite and Dugtrio, but it reliably handles Grass-type Pokemon and the occasional Bug-type Pokemon like Pinsir or Venomoth. The move also carries a dangerous burn chance, which can severely cripple wrappers like Tentacruel and Dragonite and physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Dodrio. Thunder is another potential special attack, notably scoring an OHKO on opposing Gyarados, possible 2HKO on Omastar and Dewgong, and a guaranteed 3HKO on Vaporeon and Articuno. However, its poor accuracy keeps it from being commonplace.</p> <p>Because of its bulk and array of strong matchups, Gyarados can run Rest to improve its longevity. The move can make Gyarados a more persistent check to Pokemon like Dugtrio, Dragonite, and bulky Water-type Pokemon. Gyarados can potentially burn sleep turns in front of these Pokemon or during Tentacruel’s Wrap. Rest remains a fairly niche option, however, as many Pokemon can switch in and OHKO or 2HKO Gyarados and it costs Gyarados a valuable coverage move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-type Moves</strong>: Electabuzz, Raichu, and the rare Electrode all outspeed Gyarados and have a chance to OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Unless they are paralyzed, these Pokemon will virtually always KO Gyarados or force it to switch. Haunter is another dangerous Pokemon as, in addition to outspeeding and 2HKOing Gyarados with Thunderbolt, it can come in for free on Body Slam and Hyper Beam. Haunter’s high Special also guarantees that it will survive two Hydro Pumps. Persian also outspeeds and 2HKOes Gyarados, but it is more afraid of its special moves. Clefable is also guaranteed to 2HKO Gyarados and Raticate has good odds to do so as well. Persian, Clefable, and Raticate also have the benefit of being immune to Body Slam paralysis, meaning they can switch in more confidently than most Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Gyarados's Thunderbolt has a 47.1% chance to 3HKO Articuno, and Fire Blast and Thunder guarantee the 3HKO. Articuno, on the other hand, outspeeds Gyarados and 3HKOes with Blizzard. Outside of a Body Slam paralysis or critical hit, Gyarados generally cannot pressure Articuno, meaning Articuno is often free to take it out or set up with Agility and sweep. Without a super effective move, Gyarados struggles to even 3HKO.</p> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Kangaskhan outpaces Gyarados and can potentially 3HKO it with either two Body Slams and a Hyper Beam or three Rock Slides. This means Kangaskhan will reliably defeat Gyarados unless it is carrying Hydro Pump; even with Hydro Pump, the matchup is inconsistent due to its mediocre accuracy and the risk of paralysis from Body Slam. Kangaskhan can even potentially switch in against Gyarados, as it can't be paralyzed by Body Slam and has a chance to survive two Blizzards afterward.</p> <p><strong>Rock Slide</strong>: While Gyarados switches into Dugtrio's Earthquake without fear, it must be cautious of Rock Slide. Repeated chip damage from Rock Slide makes Gyarados much less effective as a tank. Moreover, if Dugtrio lands a critical hit, Rock Slide will cost Gyarados over half of its health. Likewise, Golem has little business staying in against Gyarados, but if it predicts the switch or is behind a Substitute, it can hit with Rock Slide and take away over half of Gyarados’s health.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: While Gyarados handles status effects better than other Dugtrio checks like Dragonite and Tangela, it still prefers to avoid them. Being poisoned greatly reduces Gyarados's ability to repeatedly switch in and makes it easier to KO; for example, Dugtrio can 3HKO a poisoned Gyarados with Rock Slide. Moreover, Gyarados becomes incapable of stalling partial-trapping moves like Tentacruel's Wrap and Pinsir's Bind. While Fire Blast is not otherwise threatening to Gyarados, being burned similarly reduces its defensive utility and ability to hit and run. Moreover, it cripples Gyarados's offensive presence; a burned Gyarados can't even 2HKO Kadabra. Lastly, paralysis shortens the list of Pokemon that Gyarados can reliably threaten. Pokemon that Gyarados often preys on, like Hypno, Vaporeon, Omastar, and paralyzed Kadabra, handle Gyarados much better when it is paralyzed. Additionally, most of Gyarados's moves have imperfect accuracy, meaning it may have trouble dealing damage when paralyzed. Hydro Pump, for example, has a dismal 59.8% chance to hit if Gyarados is paralyzed. Dugtrio in particular exploits this accuracy problem, as it often carries Substitute and can thus fish for misses or full paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Tentacruel is the strongest Water-type check, as it can outspeed and immobilize Gyarados with Wrap; considering Gyarados doesn’t handle chip damage very well, this will usually force it to switch. Without Thunderbolt, Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Omastar, and Dewgong can be tricky, as they can repeatedly use Rest and gradually chip down Gyarados with Body Slam or Blizzard. Opposing Gyarados also become an issue, as Thunderbolt is a clean 2HKO. With Thunderbolt, these matchups are decidedly favorable, but they may result in Gyarados losing some health or being paralyzed, which may inhibit its ability to check Dugtrio.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Body Slam is Gyarados’s primary attack and a great way to spread paralysis; many Pokemon that look to switch into Gyarados, like Electabuzz and Tentacruel, loathe getting paralyzed. This makes it a great option when it comes face to face with Dugtrio and other Pokemon that are likely to switch out. The move is also just generally quite strong thanks to Gyarados’s base 125 Attack stat, which ties Pinsir for the third-highest in the tier. Blizzard is a great deterrent when facing Dragonite that also helps against Pokemon like Venusaur, Tangela, Dodrio, and Aerodactyl. If Gyarados isn’t running Hydro Pump, Blizzard is its best option against Pokemon with poor Special like Dugtrio and Kangaskhan. Hyper Beam is extremely strong and can eliminate many prominent threats pretty early. Tentacruel and Hypno drop to the move when they are just below 50% health and Kadabra can even be OHKOed by it, though it is unlikely. The move is thus a very strong tool for revenge killing, especially against paralyzed targets. Hyper Beam is also great for taking out common switch-ins when they are at low health or as a last-ditch hit. Thunderbolt is a powerful tool against the many bulky Water-type Pokemon in UU, 3HKOing Omastar and Dewgong while 4HKOing Vaporeon. While these Pokemon somewhat threaten Gyarados, especially via Body Slam paralysis, Gyarados can reliably break through them if needed. This is a key advantage Gyarados holds over every other notable Dugtrio check. Funnily enough, Thunderbolt also prevents Gyarados from being walled by opposing Gyarados. Lastly, Hydro Pump is Gyarados’s strongest move, narrowly beating out Hyper Beam. Hydro Pump makes quick work of most weak and neutral targets, notably OHKOing Dugtrio, Golem, and Aerodactyl, 2HKOing Persian and Kangaskhan, and 3HKOing Kadabra, Haunter, and sometimes Hypno. It is also a decent option against Articuno and Omastar if Gyarados isn’t packing Thunderbolt. Selecting Gyarados’s last two moves often comes down to team composition.</p> <p>Using Gyarados successfully often comes down to getting it in safely, letting it deal as much damage as possible, without worrying too much about its middling speed and lack of recovery. Keeping Gyarados healthy is essential for consistently checking Dugtrio; after taking a mere 16%, Rock Slide will always 3HKO, meaning Gyarados may lose to Dugtrio on the switch if it can't OHKO it. Encouraging Pokemon like Dugtrio, Golem, and Kangaskhan to use Earthquake is a very good way to get Gyarados in, as it will take no damage and force out the first two Pokemon rather consistently. Gyarados can pressure Kangaskhan, especially if it has Hydro Pump, but Kangaskhan may choose to stay in as it can win the matchup with two Body Slams and a Hyper Beam or three Rock Slides. Once Gyarados is revealed, it becomes a very strong deterrent to using Earthquake; for example, Dugtrio is very likely to use Slash or Rock Slide instead, which makes it much easier to manage.</p> <p>Gyarados is typically reserved for checking Dugtrio before anything else. However, if Dugtrio dealt with or absent from the opponent’s team, Gyarados becomes a lot more flexible. It is quite good at breaking through many common defensive Pokemon and shrugging off their hits; it effortlessly comes in against Surf, which helps it bully Water-type Pokemon like Vaporeon and Omastar late-game. It can also withstand a few Wrap hits from Tentacruel and wait for a miss if it must. Gyarados can prevent every Water-type Pokemon from repeatedly using Rest without really fearing any of their moves. It also comes in quite comfortably against offensively weaker Pokemon like Tangela and Aerodactyl, especially if it can come in on Mega Drain and Fire Blast, respectively. Gyarados also works well as a revenge killer thanks to the power of Hyper Beam and Hydro Pump. It can reasonably KO most slower Pokemon after some damage, but Hypno and paralyzed Kadabra are two particularly common targets, as Gyarados can switch in when they use their recovery moves.</p> <p>Gyarados partners best with Pokemon that appreciate a reliable switch-in for Dugtrio, like Tentacruel, Haunter, Electabuzz, and Raichu. They are also all quite good at baiting Dugtrio to use Earthquake, which helps Gyarados get in safely and repeatedly. Electabuzz and Raichu are also good switch-ins against opposing Electric-type Pokemon, with which Gyarados struggles. Persian is another good partner, as Gyarados matches up fairly well against most of its checks and answers: Dugtrio, Omastar, Golem, and Aerodactyl. Aside from Dugtrio, these Pokemon are quite likely to switch into Persian, giving Gyarados an opportunity to come in on a double switch. Articuno, Dragonite, and Dodrio appreciate Gyarados as is a solid answer for the bulky Water-type Pokemon that wall them. These Pokemon also help Gyarados check Dugtrio, allowing it to play more flexibly. Grass-type Pokemon like Venusaur and Tangela switch in comfortably against the Thunderbolts that often target Gyarados, and they too take some pressure off of Gyarados as a dedicated Dugtrio check. Fast sweepers like Dugtrio and Aerodactyl are really good at cleaning up teams after Gyarados has mounted a lot of chip damage by pivoting in against opposing Dugtrio and other Pokemon it threatens. Dugtrio also does a good job at punishing Electric-type Pokemon, Haunter, and Persian, which can threaten Gyarados.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/rby-ou-viability-rankings.3685861/post-10591542\">2025 RBY OU Viability Rankings Update</a>, the Partial Trapping ban, and the unbans of Lapras, Hypno, and Articuno from RBY UU. As a result, it may contain outdated information.</p> <hr /> <h3>Overview</h3> <p>Vaporeon stands out as the best among the many bulky Water-types in RBY UU, providing teams with a backbone against offensive behemoths like Tentacruel and Articuno. It often takes multiple Pokemon to KO Vaporeon, and because of its monstrous Special stat, they will also have to take very strong STAB Surfs in the process. Even many super effective attacks, such as Electabuzz's Thunderbolt, will fail to 2HKO it. Vaporeon is capable of dueling and checking mighty physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Dugtrio as well. Vaporeon isn't too concerned about paralysis either, making it one of the best absorbers of the status in the tier. Checking Normal-types, Articuno, Dugtrio, and even Tentacruel all in one, Vaporeon blends offense and defense perfectly, making it a very appreciated addition to many successful RBY UU teams.</p> <p>Still, though, Vaporeon is very slow, which can leave it vulnerable to Wrap from Dragonite or Tentacruel. Worse still, if Vaporeon is low on HP, this Wrap use will deny it from healing off damage with Rest. Vaporeon's reliance on Rest will also let heavy-hitting Pokemon like Persian, Kangaskhan, and Dugtrio safely switch in on the turn Rest is used, putting Vaporeon in a very precarious position. Being outrun by every sleeper in the tier, bar Tangela, can also make Vaporeon easy to put to sleep again after Rest if Sleep Clause isn't active. Finally, Vaporeon lacks coverage for opposing Water-types, though its higher damage output does tend to let it win prolonged interactions.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hydro Pump is an immensely strong option that allows Vaporeon to 2HKO almost any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, with some standout calculations being 2HKOs on Electabuzz, Persian, and Kangaskhan. However, its accuracy and PP leave much to be desired, making what should be the team's anchor very inconsistent. This also makes it easier for opposing Rest users to PP stall Vaporeon. Acid Armor lets Vaporeon wall physical attackers like Dodrio and Kangaskhan as well as take much less chip damage from Wrap, which can define late-game scenarios when its checks are removed. However, since it doesn't help against Persian or special attackers, which are just as common, it's difficult to justify.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gyarados</strong>: Gyarados resists Surf and takes 27.7% maximum from Blizzard, all while possessing coverage in Thunderbolt to 4HKO Vaporeon, which can be turned into a 3HKO with Hyper Beam. Vaporeon simply can't risk contending with a healthy Gyarados and will be forced out by it frequently. Furthermore, the best counterplay to Vaporeon is to switch in on a predicted Rest to give it what for, and Gyarados is among the best punishes to a resting Vaporeon in the tier thanks to its offensive prowess.</p> <p><strong>Venusaur</strong>: Venusaur outspeeds Vaporeon and threatens it with either an uncontested Sleep Powder or a 2HKO from Razor Leaf. Venusaur is a particularly heavy punish to a resting Vaporeon as a result. The punish especially hurts if it's running Swords Dance, allowing it to set up and still get the 2HKO before Vaporeon can act. However, Venusaur really doesn't want to switch into Blizzard, which deals up to 60%, adding a degree of risk to the prediction game.</p> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Haunter is capable of switching in on Vaporeon's Body Slam and can 3HKO with Thunderbolt about half the time. Additionally, if necessary, Explosion KOes Vaporeon from half HP. Since it's faster, Haunter can also threaten Vaporeon with Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Normal-type Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers, like the tier's resident Normal-types, are great at switching in on and punishing Vaporeon's Rest. Persian is the most reliable method of dispatching Vaporeon, 3HKOing it with Slash. While less consistent overall, Dodrio and Kangaskhan can KO Vaporeon after two Body Slams followed by Hyper Beam. However, none of these Pokemon want to contest Vaporeon's nuclear attacks, especially if it runs Hydro Pump, which 2HKOes all of them. Even without Hydro Pump, Surf and Blizzard alike have odds to 2HKO them as well.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electabuzz, Raichu, and the rare Electrode can switch in on Rest and 3HKO Vaporeon with STAB Thunderbolt. Plus, thanks to their high Speed stats, a critical hit from any of them is reasonably likely and can be difficult for Vaporeon to recover from later. In a tight spot, Electrode also guarantees a 2HKO using Thunderbolt + Explosion. However, they all take significant damage from Surf, which they can't afford in the long run. In fact, if they switch in on Surf, they're liable to lose the one-on-one, making them deceptively shaky checks.</p> <p><strong>Swords Dance Tentacruel</strong>: If using a Swords Dance set, Tentacruel can swiftly chip Vaporeon down through Wrap damage and KO it from half HP with a +2 Hyper Beam. However, Tentacruel can't afford to switch into Body Slam, lest it gets forced into Rest much earlier than usual, and the Swords Dance set rarely runs Rest anyway. If Tentacruel doesn't have Swords Dance, however, Vaporeon can absolutely fish for a Wrap miss to either try for Body Slam paralysis or use Rest to PP stall. Ergo, standard Tentacruel sets should not be considered reliable Vaporeon checks.</p> <p><strong>Dewgong</strong>: If using Ice Beam, Dewgong can engage in a freeze war with Vaporeon which, given it exhausts all its PP, has an 81.98% chance of succeeding. Since its Ice typing makes it immune to being frozen itself, and its Water typing lets it resist Vaporeon's STAB moves, Dewgong is a serviceable answer to Vaporeon. However, Dewgong is less bulky than Vaporeon, making it more difficult to wake up from Rest in the long run. This also causes it to fail to outdamage Vaporeon in prolonged interactions.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The combination of Surf and Blizzard is resisted only by Water-types and allows Vaporeon to deal significant damage to teams thanks to its incredible Special. STAB Surf is very powerful, 3HKOing Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Kadabra, and Persian. Crucially, it also lets Vaporeon consistently OHKO Dugtrio, making it a very important check. Blizzard 2HKOes Venusaur and Dodrio, as well as possibly OHKOing Dragonite. Body Slam enables Vaporeon to hit Water-types and thus the entire tier for neutral damage and scout for switch-ins, critically Tentacruel, which can flip the situation on its head if they get paralyzed. Tentacruel becomes much more manageable if it gets paralyzed, because it has to use Rest much earlier, so Body Slam denies it free entry. Rest gives Vaporeon significant longevity while removing the paralysis it will likely absorb early-game. Vaporeon's combined great offensive pressure and bulk warps the opponent's offensive play as well; this should be exploited to force out their key offensive Pokemon while getting free turns to scout with Body Slam.</p> <p>Vaporeon fits on a variety of teams. Pairing Vaporeon with almost any Flying-type Pokemon, like Dodrio or Aerodactyl, is a good choice thanks to its Ice resistance allowing it to check Articuno for them. Dragonite works particularly well, providing Vaporeon with an Electric neutrality and Grass resistance to fall back on. The two also offer each other essential paralysis support, as Vaporeon can use Body Slam against targets such as Tentacruel and Kadabra, while Dragonite can use Thunder Wave against offensive Normal-type Pokemon. Moreover, Vaporeon paired with any Flying-type Pokemon is a particularly good way to keep Dugtrio wavering between Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Slash. Oftentimes, Dugtrio is forced to use Slash, which is far easier to play around, at least compared to its nuclear Earthquake. Other Ice-weak Pokemon, such as Venusaur and Dugtrio, also appreciate Vaporeon's presence for similar reasons. Vaporeon makes a particularly potent defensive core alongside the ubiquitous Hypno as well; Vaporeon handles Dugtrio and Normal-types, while Hypno handles Electric-types and Venusaur.</p> <p>Teams that struggle against Wrap, particularly those with frailer Pokemon like Kadabra, will also benefit greatly from Vaporeon's presence, since it can take a massive amount of chip damage before it's in KO range for anything. Vaporeon can also be used alongside other bulky Water-types, such as Tentacruel, Gyarados, and Omastar, to make teams even more resilient to Wrap and offensive pressure. During Rest, remember that being trapped by Wrap still depletes sleep turns, which makes Vaporeon deceptively easy to wake up and therefore very effective for these types of teams. Vaporeon's HP must be carefully managed when against Wrap users, however.</p>"

  "Porygon": {
    "overview": "<p><strong>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. Porygon is generally considered unviable in the current metagame.</strong></p> <p>Porygon may be the most enigmatic Pokemon in RBY. While it has genuinely awful base stats, it has a wide Special movepool, an immunity to Body Slam paralysis, and two excellent moves in Thunder Wave and Recover. These traits allow it to muster a niche in OU and play a big role in NU. In UU, however, Porygon struggles to find a purpose and has no influence. It is only notable for its ability to bully Pokemon that are unable to either outspeed and 2HKO it or paralyze it, repeatedly using Recover and slowly chipping away at their health. This makes it a decent answer to paralyzed Normal-type attackers, like Kangaskhan, and bulky Water-type Pokemon, like Vaporeon and Omastar. Porygon is only a shaky check, however, as critical hits from Normal-type Pokemon can quickly put it into range of a Hyper Beam and Blizzards from Water-type Pokemon can potentially freeze it. Additionally, some teams simply do not use any of these Pokemon, leaving Porygon entirely without a purpose. Wrappers like Tentacruel, Dragonite, and even Tangela outspeed it, quickly whittle it down with Wrap or Bind, and can pivot out freely to a strong attacker to finish it off. Likewise, paralysis is a surefire way to shut down Porygon, as it will be unable to stall effectively with Recover and will drop quickly if it is fully paralyzed. Because other Pokemon perform Porygon's jobs more consistently while carrying a greater offensive presence, like Clefable, Electabuzz, Venusaur, Gyarados, and most bulky Water-type Pokemon, it is generally not seen in RBY UU.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Staller": {
        "description": "<p>Because Porygon enjoys facing bulky Water-type Pokemon, Thunderbolt is mandatory so it can actually apply some pressure to them. Thunderbolt has a good chance to 3HKO Omastar and Dewgong and will 4HKO Vaporeon. This means Porygon can usually force these Pokemon to switch or use Rest, thus helping its teammates switch in more comfortably. Additionally, Thunderbolt will 2HKO Gyarados, 3HKO Aerodactyl, and 4HKO Tentacruel, making them somewhat hesitant to switch in. Both Ice Beam and Psychic help Porygon match up better against Pokemon that can’t threaten it with paralysis. Ice Beam allows Porygon to potentially beat Dugtrio and Dragonite that aren't carrying Thunder Wave. Ice Beam can also be used in desperate situations to potentially freeze something before it is paralyzed or KOed. Psychic covers Haunter and can more easily pressure Normal-type Pokemon, Tentacruel, and Vaporeon if it happens to get a Special drop. Special drops also reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, which can make paralyzed Porygon somewhat more useful. Both moves also help Porygon against Venusaur. Thunder Wave is a necessity because of Porygon’s downright horrendous Speed. If Porygon is going to stall any Pokemon at all, the Pokemon absolutely needs to be paralyzed, as Porygon must be faster to use Recover successfully and requires free turns from full paralysis to chip it down. Thunder Wave can also potentially catch switch-ins like Tentacruel, Hypno, Kadabra, and Electabuzz. Recover allows Porygon to be a nuisance throughout the entire game. Because of its pitiful defenses, Porygon needs to be at full health to reliably switch into the majority of attacks, meaning it will be using Recover a lot, especially if it plans on switching out soon. Porygon has a few other interesting moves, like Tri Attack, Sharpen, and Agility, but it struggles to make room for or get use out of any of them.</p> <p>Porygon is nearly incapable of making any offensive progress against most teams. If a Pokemon is unable to break through Porygon, it is quite likely to switch to something that can quickly scare it out. Porygon is virtually useless once it is paralyzed, so Pokemon like Hypno are quite likely to switch in. The only Pokemon that pair well with Porygon are those that appreciate its ability to force switches, spread paralysis, and force Water-type Pokemon to use Rest. Thus, possible partners include Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, Kangaskhan, and Articuno.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aside from its Rock typing, Seismic Toss is pretty much Omastar's only unique advantage over Vaporeon. It can be fairly useful for its consistent damage against any target. However, most Pokemon are simply hit harder by Omastar’s other moves or more threatened by the chance of paralysis from Body Slam, so the move isn’t overly common or useful. It is strongly advised to stick to the suggested set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Omastar’s archrival Vaporeon is also one of its most consistent checks. Vaporeon takes very little from all of Omastar’s moves and is relatively unfazed by paralysis. Vaporeon also uses Omastar’s Rock typing against it by scoring a 4HKO with Surf or a 3HKO with Hydro Pump. Poliwrath is in a similar boat, as it shrugs off Omastar’s attacks quite easily and can retaliate with a super effective move like Earthquake or Submission. Finally, while it fears paralysis, Tentacruel easily emerges victorious against Omastar thanks to its access to the strongest unboosted Surf in the tier.</p> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Users</strong>: Electabuzz and Raichu are two of the scariest Pokemon for Omastar to face. While Hydro Pump does quite a lot to both, both dispatch Omastar with relatively uncontested 2HKOs. While it lacks STAB on the move, Gyarados is also more than capable of winning the matchup, even if it switches in. Other users such as Haunter and Persian can't reliably switch in, but they can use their superior Speed to threaten Omastar in a pinch, especially if Omastar has taken a few hits or is asleep.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake Users</strong>: While Omastar is well-equipped to handle Normal- and Flying-type moves, its Rock typing leaves it exposed to Earthquake. Omastar is capable of beating every Earthquake user aside from Poliwrath one-on-one, but the move limits Omastar’s ability to switch in. Earthquake users can also revenge kill Omastar without much damage or paralysis support due to its low Speed. A sleeping Omastar can be exploited rather easily for this same reason. The wrong situation can make Pokemon that Omastar usually matches up well against, like Kangaskhan, Dugtrio, and Golem, suddenly threatening.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: While rare, Grass-type Pokemon truly threaten Omastar. Venusaur is especially scary, for it outspeeds and claims a clean OHKO with Razor Leaf. Tangela that choose to use Mega Drain can easily 2HKO Omastar while recovering enough health to not be too fearful of Omastar’s Blizzard. Additionally, its Mega Drain begins to enter OHKO territory after just two uses of Growth.</p>",

        "description": "<hr /> <h4>Outdated Analysis</h4> <h4>Overview</h4> <p>Omastar first appeared on the RBY UU stage because it was thought to be a strong counter to the then recently-released legendary birds, Articuno and Moltres, as well as the Wrap-happy Dragonite to a lesser extent. However, as the metagame progressed, other significant Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Vaporeon proved more than capable of keeping the birds at bay. As Articuno became less potent and Moltres fell into obscurity, Omastar began to find itself somewhat unemployed. As such, Omastar dwells near the bottom of the RBY UU metagame. It competes quite closely with Vaporeon, which is widely regarded as the tier’s premier bulky Water-type. Despite stiff competition, Omastar has a few attributes that set it apart from Vaporeon and other defensively-oriented Pokemon.</p> <p>Omastar’s most notable trait is its Rock typing, which makes it a much more specialized defensive unit compared to Vaporeon and the like. It matches up well against Pokemon that rely primarily or exclusively on Normal-, Flying-, or Fire-type moves such as Persian, Dodrio, and Moltres. Omastar is also rivaled only by Haunter and Golem at handling Wrap damage and Explosion. On the negative side, Omastar shares many of the same weaknesses held by other defensive Water-types, such as against Electric-type moves, while acquiring some additional ones. These include a new weakness to Ground-type moves, a worsened weakness to Grass-type moves, and the inability to resist the many Water-type attacks in the tier. Finally, Omastar is remarkably slow, being outpaced by every major Pokemon in the tier aside from Golem. This renders it highly susceptible to being revenge killed.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is the main set you can expect to see Omastar run. It strongly resembles the set most often employed by Vaporeon and seeks to accomplish many of the same goals. Surf or Hydro Pump is its all-purpose STAB move. Both moves hit neutral and weak targets quite effectively thanks to Omastar’s rather high Special stat. Hydro Pump's extra damage is notable for a few targets, such as scoring a 3HKO against Hypno and a guaranteed 2HKO against Kangaskhan and Persian. Surf misses some benchmarks but has higher accuracy and PP. Blizzard grants Omastar coverage resisted only by Water-types. It is also notable for being extremely likely to OHKO Dragonite. It also outperforms Surf and Hydro Pump against a few targets such as Dodrio, Gyarados, and the handful of Grass-types that lurk in the tier. Body Slam is mainly for hitting opposing Water-types. Its most notable target is Tentacruel; should Body Slam paralyze it, it will likely be forced to use Rest and thus become much easier to exploit. Rest is, of course, to keep Omastar healthy, especially against less offensive teams. Successfully using Rest and waking up is quite difficult in the RBY UU environment, but Omastar can occasionally use Rest in front of the Pokemon it can wall and attempt to wake up amidst the many turns of Wrap likely to occur as the match continues.</p> <p>Omastar is quite good at slowing down your opponent’s offensive momentum. Its Rock typing can be very helpful for pivoting into the many Normal-type moves thrown around in the tier. Omastar can come in rather freely against Persian and Kangaskhan, provided they are using a Normal-type move, and threaten a 2HKO in return. Omastar becomes especially potent if switched in against a Hyper Beam, as it essentially has a free turn to use a powerful special attack. It should be noted that a revealed Omastar is a fairly good deterrent to reckless use of Hyper Beam and Explosion. Additionally, Omastar completely walls Dodrio and Articuno, only fearing the latter freezing it. While it is hardly worth mentioning in the modern metagame because they are so uncommon, Omastar is exceptional at walling Fire-type Pokemon.</p> <p>Omastar also has interesting interactions with Wrap. It resists the attack, so it is quite good at either PP stalling the attacker or simply taking the hits and hoping to punish a miss. When paired with other Pokemon that take little or no damage from Wrap, like Haunter and Golem, Omastar can feasibly force Tentacruel or Dragonite to exhaust all of their Wrap PP by simply switching in and out with the other Pokemon. Such a strategy can still be exploited by many potential Omastar switch-ins, such as Dugtrio, Electabuzz, and Raichu. This can be overcome with proper prediction; you can pivot into a Pokemon that matches up well against common switch-ins to Omastar. And in end-games where many of these attackers are KOed, Omastar can help secure victories against Pokemon that are dependent on Wrap for damage, such as some variants of Dragonite.</p> <p>As the tier’s premier Articuno check, Omastar is quite useful on teams that struggle with the legendary bird. Teammates such as Dugtrio, Tangela, and Venusaur most appreciate Omastar's combination of attributes. These three Pokemon also happen to handle Electric-type Pokemon quite well, which threaten Omastar. Flying-type Pokemon like Gyarados, Dragonite, and Dodrio similarly appreciate Omastar’s resistance to Ice while also switching into the Earthquakes that Omastar frequently baits in; these Earthquakes can also help Dodrio safely set up with Agility. While Omastar is a decidedly defensive Pokemon, it is quite good at enabling its offensive teammates, either by giving them a partner into which they can pivot or by spreading paralysis via Body Slam.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Kabutops is a powerful Swords Dance user that 2HKOes some of the tier's main defensive Pokemon, like Hypno, Vaporeon, and Tentacruel, with +2 Hyper Beam. It also has access to Slash, which gives it a powerful unboosted attack. Additionally, Kabutops resists Normal- and Ice-type attacks, thereby allowing it to be used in conjunction with Haunter to use against Wrap users like Dragonite. It can also switch into Hyper Beam for a free setup opportunity.</p> <p>However, even with a fearsome Hyper Beam, Kabutops is not very good in the RBY UU metagame due to the existence of Omastar, which is better defensively, in addition to it being weak to Thunderbolt from Gyarados, Persian, Haunter, and Electabuzz, as well as a weakness to Earthquake and Grass-type attacks. Not to mention, it is outsped by half the metagame. Finally, it has a mediocre Special stat, thus weakening special attacks, and has no Rock-type STAB moves. Due to these flaws, you likely will not be seeing Kabutops running around in RBY UU.</p>",

        "description": "<p>If you decide to run Swords Dance, you should look for an opening to set up and try to sweep or wallbreak. While Hyper Beam does more damage, Body Slam mitigates the fear of a recharge turn, and it can paralyze. Slash can work when Kabutops has no boost, but Body Slam can also work with Hyper Beam, as Slash is unaffected by Swords Dance, but it can work well regardless of if Kabutops is unboosted or not running Swords Dance. On the other hand, while Body Slam does less damage, the chance to paralyze can do much more. Blizzard is used to 2HKO Dragonite, Tangela, and Dodrio.</p> <p>Alternatively, Kabutops can go for a hit-and-run playstyle with a Rest set, taking advantage of its resistances to Normal- and Ice-type moves. When using Rest, Slash is Kabutops's go-to attacking option, hitting most Pokemon neutrally while doing good damage. You could feasibly use Kabutops to resist Wrap and possibly either use Haunter in the same team to PP stall the Wrap user or Body Slam, Hyper Beam and Blizzard to break out. It is recommended to use Wrap to burn off sleep turns, but this can also be done with other Normal-type moves, especially Hyper Beam, or Blizzard.</p> <p>Submission is a possible option that works with Swords Dance to hit Kangaskhan, Persian, and Omastar. Mega Kick can be used as a weaker version of Hyper Beam that has no recharge. However, due to the fact that it is weaker than Hyper Beam, it can end up being the difference between a sweep or not. Not to mention it can't OHKO Electabuzz or Raichu after a Swords Dance, whereas Hyper Beam can.</p>"

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Aerodactyl is able to find a niche on anti-Wrap cores thanks to its exceptionally high Speed, which allows it to check and revenge kill even some of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, like Dugtrio and Persian. This Speed gives it an incredible 25.39% critical hit rate while also making it difficult to pin down with Wrap. Aerodactyl also has an amazing defensive typing that provides it with immunity to Earthquake and resistance to Normal-type attacks, granting it great synergy with physically frail Pokemon like Electabuzz and Raichu. Finally, Aerodactyl's Normal resistance allows it to PP stall Wrap, dissuade Explosion, and force recharges from Hyper Beam.</p> <p>However, Aerodactyl comes with a slew of problems. It's hindered severely by a lack of STAB options, with its sole semi-functional one being the mediocre Sky Attack. This extends to the rest of its offensive movepool, often leading Aerodactyl to use Fire Blast. Overall, these movepool issues limit Aerodactyl's damage output by quite a bit. Furthermore, its reliance on Double-Edge forces it to take heavy recoil and leaves it susceptible to knocking itself into KO range, severely limiting its defensive use throughout a game. Defensively, Aerodactyl is very frail specially, taking massive damage from Surf and Blizzard, both very common attacks in the tier. As a result, it will struggle against threats like its extinct brethren Omastar and often get forced out. Aerodactyl is extremely reliant on its Speed as well, making paralysis a near-death sentence, once again forcing it out if it can't KO the user before it gets paralyzed. This is further amplified by the risk of Body Slam paralyzing it, which makes what would otherwise be a switch-in opportunity a dangerous game to play.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Aerodactyl's fourth move slot is the most expendable, and while its movepool is very limited, this isn't to say there aren't options. Rest is the most relevant option, allowing Aerodactyl to serve a more defensive role while removing paralysis, ensuring it can maintain a defensive presence throughout a game. Considering Wrap deducts sleep turns, Rest plays well into Aerodactyl's playstyle. However, Rest also makes it easy setup fodder for Dragonite. Alternatively, Sky Attack can be used to hit Haunter and OHKO Kadabra, which isn't unfeasible if it's charged during a Recover turn in Kadabra's case, but its two-turn nature and shaky accuracy make it unreliable and specific.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Aerodactyl can't scratch Rock-types at all—especially Omastar and Golem—and is weak to almost every attack they commonly use. As a result, Aerodactyl invites these threats in just by existing and will be subsequently forced out.</p> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Haunter is immune to Aerodactyl's main attacking options and takes minimal damage from Fire Blast. As if this weren't enough, it 2HKOes Aerodactyl with Thunderbolt. The best Aerodactyl can offer against it is a potential burn, which makes its Explosion pitifully weak. However, Haunter must be wary of Sky Attack.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Aerodactyl takes heavy damage from any viable Water-type's STAB Surf. While it can survive Surf from Vaporeon at full HP, Double-Edge's recoil means it will almost never be in a situation where it can make use of it. This also makes Tentacruel's 28.2% chance to OHKO Aerodactyl with Surf much more imposing. Gyarados can 2HKO Aerodactyl with Surf or Thunderbolt or even OHKO it with Hydro Pump 89.7% of the time. However, Aerodactyl is very capable of revenge killing Water-types not named Omastar through Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Aerodactyl's main strength in RBY UU is its Speed, so paralysis is the bane of its existence. It will force Aerodactyl to use Agility to remain in control, assuming it is running it, which can be very difficult to set up reliably and leaves it open to exploitation from Pokemon like Dragonite. Unless Aerodactyl can take out opposing paralysis inducers like Electabuzz and Hypno, it's forced to switch out. It should be noted that they're KOed by Hyper Beam from 47.1% and 37.5% onwards, respectively. Raichu can notably use Agility to outspeed Aerodactyl and 2HKO it with Thunderbolt. Electrode can do the same, and its naturally higher Speed makes matters worse. Body Slam's paralysis chance can also make checking Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Dodrio much riskier than it should be, making what would normally be a valid point of entry a potential death sentence.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Articuno takes middling damage from Aerodactyl's options outside of Fire Blast, can boost itself to become faster than it through Agility, and OHKOes it with Blizzard. If Articuno has used Agility, Aerodactyl can't do anything.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: While a Toxic or even burn from Aerodactyl will completely stuff its chances of a Wrap sweep, Dragonite is more than capable of beating Aerodactyl. It can use Agility to outspeed and 2HKO Aerodactyl with Blizzard or Thunderbolt, and it doesn't take much damage from its attacks. It also has access to Thunder Wave, which incapacitates Aerodactyl and makes it much more vulnerable to Wrap.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Speed Utility": {
        "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Double-Edge acts as Aerodactyl's main attacking move, allowing it to deal significant damage to physically weak Pokemon. Double-Edge notably 2HKOes Kadabra and puts Dugtrio into range for Hyper Beam. Hyper Beam allows Aerodactyl to revenge kill opposing Pokemon very effectively, KOing Tentacruel from 40.2% onwards. Fire Blast is most useful for the significant burn chance, which can incapacitate physical attackers and cause Wrap users to take more damage than they can deal when using it. Toxic can be used to prevent a Wrap sweep from Agility + Wrap Dragonite, but Agility is helpful for ignoring the Speed drop from paralysis. Fire Blast works well with Toxic, as burning Haunter and Tentacruel—which are immune to it—allows your own Tentacruel to further chip them using Wrap.</p> <p>Aerodactyl's main purpose during a game is to revenge kill Pokemon and prevent Wrap cores from making progress, all while providing defensive support through its typing. This is best facilitated by the use of partners that, like Aerodactyl, take minimal damage from Wrap, such as Haunter, Omastar, and Vaporeon. Alternatively, Aerodactyl can be fit onto teams with offensive Pokemon that can give it openings to sweep like Persian, Kangaskhan, and Dragonite. Overall, this culminates into a hit-and-run playstyle that makes it work well, be it early- or late-game.</p> <p>Aerodactyl's resistance to Normal-type attacks and high Speed mean it can switch in on Wrap with near-impunity, taking minimal damage while guaranteeing damage on the opposing Wrap user should Aerodactyl stay in. Aerodactyl also happens to switch in well against Pokemon that use their teammate's Wrap to switch in freely, such as Dugtrio and Persian. This makes it a good response to these switch-ins with good prediction, especially if it comes in the same turn as them. Overall, Aerodactyl serves as very effective means to check these fast threats, dictating the game state efficiently by denying the opposing team momentum.</p> <p>Aerodactyl's Ground immunity makes it well equipped for double switching, allowing it to ease in Electric-types like Electabuzz, as well as Haunter and Tentacruel, through deterring the use of Earthquake. This makes Aerodactyl suitable for teams that lead with Electabuzz, as Dugtrio is fairly likely to switch in immediately, and Aerodactyl can KO Dugtrio with Double-Edge + Hyper Beam. Since Aerodactyl is thoroughly debilitated by paralysis, it appreciates having a Ground-type teammate like Dugtrio or Golem to switch in on Thunder Wave and maintain momentum.</p>"

  "Moltres": {
    "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Agility + Partial Trapping. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to the current RBY UU metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Moltres is an unusual Pokemon in RBY UU. It has downright incredible base stats, boasting the second-highest total of any Pokemon outside of Ubers. Its Fire Blast is enormously strong, unsurpassed by any other unboosted special move in the game. Because of these traits, Moltres spent much of its history banned and was considered a top choice once it was finally released to the tier. Given its behemoth offensive prowess and the success its sibling Articuno had, one would be forgiven for assuming Moltres would be a staple in the tier.</p> <p>Moltres, however, is not a staple in RBY UU by any account. The tier is infested with Water-type Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Omastar, and UU king Tentacruel, which creates a very hostile environment for Moltres. Another major flaw is how heavily Articuno outclasses it. As a special attacker, Moltres is nearly strictly worse than Articuno, as several prominent Pokemon in the tier resist Fire but not Ice; thus, the true strength of Moltres's nuclear Fire Blast is seldom realized. Examples include Dragonite, Gyarados, Aerodactyl, and Golem. Somewhat humorously, the only major Pokemon that Moltres has an edge against relative to Articuno is Articuno itself. Being a Fire-type Pokemon isn’t doing Moltres any defensive favors either. Articuno has a much better chance at muscling through Water-type checks, as it can endure their attacks while it hunts for a critical hit or freeze. Moltres, on the other hand, will likely get 2HKOed by Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar, meaning it is afforded no extra turns to try to get lucky. Failing to resist Ice also leaves it more vulnerable to attackers like Gyarados. Considering the ubiquity of Water-type Pokemon and how everything that checks Articuno also checks Moltres, basically every well composed RBY UU team is incidentally prepared to face Moltres.</p> <p>Moltres is just barely able to scrounge a niche in RBY UU, being able to do one of two things for a team. Firstly, it can be a supplement to Articuno to create a strong special attacking core. Against neutral targets, Moltres's Fire Blast boasts impressive damage output, 2HKOing most neutral targets. Alternatively, Moltres can try to slowly rack up damage and possibly even sweep with AgiliSpin, much like Dragonite with Wrap. While both approaches to Moltres are viable, they have their issues. A Moltres and Articuno core still needs a lot of support, as the two share many checks. Fire Spin Moltres is a suboptimal partial trapper relative to staples like Dragonite due to the move's lower accuracy, PP, and damage output.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Moltres is generally best used as an offensive Pokemon, its impressive bulk can allow it to check a few Pokemon, like the tier’s Normal-type attackers. This means Moltres can run defensive options like Rest and Reflect. Toxic gives Moltres a more reliable option for Dragonite and synergizes well with Fire Spin.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Unless they happen to be in KO range of Hyper Beam or Double-Edge, Moltres is almost completely helpless against Water-type Pokemon. Tentacruel outspeeds Moltres and can use Wrap to weaken it or just cleanly 2HKO it with Surf. Vaporeon is slower but can take Moltres’s attacks more comfortably while still scoring a 2HKO. Poliwrath behaves similarly, but it can only potentially 2HKO Moltres if it has Hydro Pump. Thanks to its typing, Omastar is the best counter to Moltres; even if Moltres scores a critical hit with every attack, Omastar can safely use Rest and wall it indefinitely. Omastar will always 2HKO Moltres with Surf as well. Gyarados can take Moltres’s hits fairly comfortably and score a 2HKO with Hydro Pump or a 3HKO with Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon</strong>: Golem takes relatively little from Moltres’s moves. It is very likely to OHKO Moltres with Rock Slide, making Moltres very hesitant to pivot out with Fire Spin; this essentially gives Golem a free turn to use a powerful STAB attack or Substitute. Golem also punishes Hyper Beam exceptionally well, scoring a virtually guaranteed OHKO in response. Aerodactyl doesn’t have many good offensive options for Moltres, but it can take a few hits and apply pressure with Double-Edge, especially if it can land a few critical hits. Neither Golem nor Aerodactyl handles a burn well, however.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Moltres can, at best, 4HKO Dragonite, but it will likely require even more turns to KO it. Dragonite, on the other hand, can 3HKO with Blizzard, stymie Moltres's offensive ability with Thunder Wave, or attempt to use Agility and sweep with Wrap. Dragonite's ability to sweep is threatened by Fire Blast's burn chance, but Dragonite is still very likely to win the matchup thanks to its wide array of strong special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio has no business switching into Moltres and despises burn, but it survives a Fire Blast and can 2HKO Moltres with Rock Slide. Thanks to its high critical hit rate, Dugtrio is liable to OHKO Moltres as well, making Moltres fearful even if it is at full health and has used Agility.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Moltres’s Fire Blast ties with Articuno’s Blizzard as the strongest unboosted special move in the tier. While more Pokemon resist Fire Blast than Blizzard, the move still deals massive damage to the right targets; it 3HKOes Hypno and 2HKOes Kangaskhan, Persian, Dodrio, Dugtrio, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Venusaur. Fire Blast actually outperforms Blizzard against a select few — albeit uncommon — Pokemon as well, including Dewgong, Pinsir, and Venomoth. It also comes with a nasty 30.1% chance to burn, which keeps some would-be checks, like Tentacruel and Dragonite, somewhat hesitant to face Moltres. While not quite as lethal as a freeze, a burn can completely incapacitate pretty much every physical attacker outside of Persian. A burn on a partial trapper like Tentacruel can force it to use Rest much earlier than usual, as the passive damage will build up if it tries to use Wrap or Bind. However, due to Fire Blast's poor accuracy and UU's many Water-types, running out of PP is a genuine possibility. Additionally, a single miss can ruin Moltres, as it leaves it vulnerable to being paralyzed or KOed. As such, Moltres must use it wisely.</p> <p>Moltres's surprisingly high Attack stat makes its Hyper Beam and Double-Edge remarkably strong. Because of the extra damage output from its physical attacks, Moltres can use Agility and attempt to sweep even sooner than Articuno in some cases. For example, Tentacruel and Kadabra must be at or below 35% and 65% health, respectively, for Articuno to secure a sweep with Hyper Beam. For Moltres, these Pokemon can be at 38.5% and 72% health. The difference is minor, but it can be important in a metagame where many Pokemon lose health in increments of roughly 3% to Tentacruel’s Wrap.</p> <p>Fire Spin is more versatile than Double-Edge, enabling it to chip weakened foes into KO range of Fire Blast or Hyper Beam. The move can also immobilize, slowly whittle down, and potentially sweep the opposing team, especially if Moltres has managed to use Agility. Fire Spin also gives Moltres an option against Dragonite; it can use the move and switch out to something that can prevent Dragonite from setting up its potentially game-ending Agility. Compared to Dragonite's Wrap, Moltres's Fire Spin has lower accuracy and PP but has the benefit of damaging Haunter. Alternatively, Double-Edge provides Moltres with a consistent attack with perfect accuracy, a lot of PP, and few drawbacks. This greatly aids in Moltres’s sweeping, allowing it to take out weakened targets with little risk. Note that Articuno almost completely outclasses Moltres running Double-Edge, so Articuno should generally be run alongside Moltres if this set is chosen. Essentially, Fire Spin is for sweeping sooner, while Double-Edge is for sweeping reliably. Agility makes Moltres faster than the entire unboosted metagame and therefore less fearful of Pokemon like Tentacruel, Kadabra, Electabuzz, and Raichu while letting it attempt to sweep or wallbreak.</p> <p>Moltres requires quite a lot of support to function. Pokemon that can apply pressure to Water-type Pokemon, such as Electabuzz, Raichu, and Venusaur, are good partners. Physical attackers like Persian and Kangaskhan can also work with Moltres on hyper offense builds. Together, they can form mixed attacking cores that few teams can handle. Users of sleep inducing moves like Hypno, Tangela, and the aforementioned Venusaur provide Moltres with a setup opportunity. If Moltres is being used alongside Articuno, much of the same support is required, though to an even greater extent. Fast Pokemon like Kadabra and Dugtrio are also good partners, as the core is relatively slow and liable to be smothered by Tentacruel.</p>"

As a result, it may contain outdated information.</p> <hr /> <p>Thanks to an unrivaled base stat total and enormous movepool, Dragonite is easily the most versatile Pokemon in RBY UU and a major influence on what Pokemon and moves are popular. Dragonite is most infamous for its lethal Agility and Wrap combo, which enables it to slowly chip down foes and potentially sweep entire teams. The pair of moves is so powerful that virtually every Pokemon is forced to carry a move that can dispatch or incapacitate Dragonite before it can set up. In addition to being the most potent sweeper in the tier, Dragonite has numerous defensive and supportive traits that make it very easy to justify including on most teams. Its typing and enormous bulk allow it to take on tier staples such as Dugtrio, Persian, Kangaskhan, Venusaur, and Tangela. Furthermore, Wrap and Thunder Wave allow Dragonite to act as a pivot and provide essential support for its teammates. Finally, Dragonite has an incredibly diverse pool of offensive options including Blizzard, Thunderbolt, Body Slam, and the strongest non-STAB Hyper Beam, making it unpredictable and difficult to check. Its typing and versatility also make it an excellent partner to many key Pokemon; those that fear Dugtrio and other physical attackers, like Electabuzz, Haunter, and Persian, appreciate it, as do those that benefit from paralysis spreading, like Articuno, Kangaskhan, and Golem.</p> <p>Dragonite's most obvious shortcoming is its Ice weakness, which gives many prominent Blizzard users, including Tentacruel, Articuno, Vaporeon, Omastar, Dewgong, and Gyarados, the potential to OHKO it. For Tentacruel, Articuno, and Dewgong, this KO is guaranteed. All of them can force Dragonite out if they come in at the same time as it or through a Wrap pivot. They can also severely punish Dragonite if it misses with Wrap. Dragonite is also quite vulnerable to status effects, as they weaken strategies involving Wrap, either by damaging Dragonite during Wrap turns or making it less likely to connect the move. While Dragonite is not particularly slow, it is outpaced by several prominent Pokemon, most notably Tentacruel, so Dragonite is likely to be revenge killed once it has sustained a fair amount of damage. Lastly, while AgiliWrap is Dragonite's claim to fame, it is not totally reliable. Due to Wrap's mediocre 84.4% accuracy, it's not uncommon for Dragonite to set up Agility, miss with Wrap early, and faint to Blizzard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragonite has a diverse array of coverage moves to play with if it wants to cover certain targets. While it misses out on hitting Grass-type Pokemon, Surf is a more accurate alternative to Blizzard that does more to Golem and Omastar while still 2HKOing Dugtrio. Fire Blast is an interesting option that can burn foes. Burn synergizes well with Dragonite’s Wrap and can incapacitate opposing users of partial trapping moves and physical attackers like Tentacruel and Kangaskhan. The move also happens to be Dragonite’s strongest option against Articuno and Pinsir, netting a 3HKO and a 2HKO, respectively. Thunder is a somewhat viable alternative to Thunderbolt; while it sacrifices accuracy, the move garners a possible 2HKO against Omastar and Dewgong and a guaranteed 3HKO against Vaporeon.</p> <p>Dragonite also comes equipped with some notable defensive options. Rest is the most notable of the bunch, as Dragonite is quite difficult to 3HKO. In addition to Wrap turns, Dragonite can attempt to wake up on Pokemon such as Venusaur, Tangela, Aerodactyl, and Electabuzz. The move can still be exploited by Blizzard users and Agility users—most notably Articuno and opposing Dragonite—however. Reflect is potentially interesting for helping against physical attackers, but it fails to protect Dragonite from the many prominent special attackers and Persian's and Pinsir's Slash. Toxic is a fairly useful move for taking advantage of Wrap, but it doesn’t help much against faster Pokemon and has no effect on Tentacruel.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Blizzard Users</strong>: Pokemon with Blizzard greatly threaten Dragonite and can force it out rather consistently. Tentacruel, Articuno, and Dewgong are guaranteed to OHKO Dragonite with Blizzard, so it is very likely to switch out when faced with any of them. Articuno is particularly scary, as not only does it outspeed Dragonite, but it can also potentially set up with Agility and sweep regardless of what Dragonite does. Omastar and Vaporeon are also very likely to OHKO, which encourages Dragonite to switch out, although it may elect to take the risk if it has Wrap. Gyarados outspeeds and can OHKO Dragonite 38.5% of the time, making it a fairly strong answer as well. Poliwrath will never OHKO Dragonite, but it is still a fairly reliable answer to sets without Thunderbolt, though Dragonite may risk using Agility in front of it, especially if the situation is dire.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Because most Dragonite variants rely on Wrap for damage and pivoting, passive damage does a great job at punishing them. Toxic is the most common form of passive damage and is frequently run by Dugtrio, Persian, Kangaskhan, Dodrio, Venusaur, and Aerodactyl. The damage causes Dragonite to take more damage than it can deal with Wrap, thus limiting its ability to pivot and shutting down the AgiliWrap combo almost entirely. Other, less common, forms of passive damage, such as burn and Leech Seed, will work much the same. Aerodactyl and Moltres are the most likely Pokemon to burn Dragonite, as they regularly carry Fire Blast. The Attack drop makes Wrap, Body Slam, and Hyper Beam, much less effective. Venusaur is the only notable user of Leech Seed; though the effect is not permanent, it may choose to run the move over Toxic because of the higher accuracy and HP recovery. All forms of passive damage also limit Dragonite's defensive capabilities, regardless of the set. For example, Dugtrio and Kangaskhan become much more likely to get 3HKOs if Dragonite is poisoned. Additionally, after just a single turn of Toxic damage, Vaporeon will always OHKO Dragonite with Blizzard and Gyarados will OHKO over 80% of the time.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: If Dragonite is paralyzed, it only has about a 63% chance of connecting Wrap. Like passive damage, paralysis greatly reduces the reliability of Wrap for pivoting and sweeping. Moreover, being paralyzed leaves Dragonite much less equipped to handle slow users of Blizzard like Vaporeon, Omastar, and Dewgong.</p> <p><strong>Normal-resistant Pokemon</strong>: While it is still immobilized by Wrap, Haunter takes no damage from the move. Haunter can rather effectively stall Dragonite out of Wrap PP, meaning that setting up AgiliWrap is close to unviable so long as Haunter is healthy. Outside of Wrap, Dragonite still needs to be wary of Haunter’s very fast Hypnosis and Explosion. Much like Haunter, Rock-type Pokemon like Omastar, Aerodactyl, and Golem can potentially PP stall Dragonite’s Wrap, especially if they are paired with each other or Haunter. Aerodactyl is especially notable, as it outspeeds Dragonite, meaning it can switch in and use Toxic or KO it if it happens to be in range. Finally, Rock-type Pokemon can switch in and punish Hyper Beam effectively with prediction.</p> <p><strong>Faster Partial-trappers</strong>: Partial-trapping moves allow Pokemon like Pinsir and Moltres to stop an AgiliWrap sweep without dedicating a moveslot to Toxic. Both Pokemon can then easily pivot to Pokemon like Tentacruel and Articuno. However, if Dragonite has already used Agility, partial-trapping moves cannot punish a miss, unlike Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Blizzard. Moltres is the only exception, being able to use Agility itself after a miss to outspeed the boosted Dragonite and chip it down with Fire Spin.</p>",

      "AgiliWrap": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is Dragonite’s most common set, and arguably its most dangerous. After using Agility, Dragonite outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame and can immobilize and chip any Pokemon but Haunter. Considering Dragonite’s unrivaled Attack stat, Wrap can deal massive damage to the opposing team and occasionally even sweep outright after Agility. However, the healthier the opposing team is, the less likely this strategy is to work; Dragonite will need some luck to connect Wrap that many times. Because Wrap is sometimes dealt with through repeated switching, the Dragonite user can also potentially gain a lot of information about the opposing team quite early in the game. Unlike other sweepers and Agility users, Dragonite can set up at virtually any point in the game; Wrap can severely weaken a team even if it doesn’t actually KO any of its members. From there, fast sweepers like Dugtrio, Persian, and Electabuzz can quickly finish the job. Aside from Haunter and Rock-type Pokemon like Omastar, Aerodactyl, and Golem—which do not take much damage from Wrap—there aren’t really any Pokemon that need to be dealt with before Dragonite can comfortably set up. Another key aspect of AgiliWrap is just how threatening it is; Dragonite very strongly discourages Pokemon from switching out, as doing so could net Dragonite the free turn it needs to use Agility and do a lot of damage. Because of this pressure, Dragonite can often force key damage on slow Pokemon like Hypno and Vaporeon with Wrap, which could potentially force an earlier use of Rest, which Dragonite and its teammates could later exploit. Additionally, if Dragonite is in a position to accept poison or paralysis, it can get enormous damage on or paralyze a powerful Pokemon like Dugtrio, Persian, or Kangaskhan.</p> <p>The key to this Dragonite set is finding the right opportunity to set up. The most obvious way is in front of sleeping or frozen foes. If they do not switch out from Dragonite's teammates immediately, they risk inviting Dragonite in to potentially close the game right there. Moreover, AgiliWrap Dragonite is one of the best, if not the best, Pokemon at punishing Rest. Dragonite creates many 50/50 situations by punishing Rest, most notably threatening to come in against a Hypno that was brought to about half health by Kadabra or opposing Hypno. Alternatively, Dragonite may face a Pokemon that lacks a move to immediately dispatch it; these Pokemon are also prime setup fodder. Preventing Dragonite from successfully sweeping with Wrap generally involves using Toxic, a move that can induce paralysis, or Blizzard, provided the user can OHKO Dragonite. Pokemon without any of these options are fairly rare, but not unseen. Offensive Normal-type Pokemon, such as Kangakhan, Persian, and Dodrio, regularly drop Toxic, making them good targets to set up, especially after some scouting. Finally, while poison and paralysis do greatly hinder any shot of sweeping with Wrap, statused Dragonite is not dead weight, still being good at dealing some damage before it goes down. In the case of paralysis, Dragonite still maintains its defensive abilities, such as checking Dugtrio, Venusaur, and Tangela. Additionally, because Agility clears the Speed drop from paralysis, Dragonite can still attempt to use AgiliWrap. The consistency is significantly lower, but Dragonite still has the potential to deal a lot of damage, and the occasional full paralysis can actually make PP stalling Dragonite a bit trickier, as Rock-type Pokemon looking to switch in on Wrap may end up at risk of taking Blizzard or Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Besides AgiliWrap, Dragonite's most notable attribute is reliably checking Dugtrio and Grass-type Pokemon like Venusaur and Tangela. Because of this role, Blizzard is an obvious choice on the set to hit them hard. Thanks to Dragonite’s above average Special, the move is a good option for weakening offensive Pokemon or finishing off foes during a sweep attempt. It also happens to be Dragonite's best tool for hitting Haunter, being a 4HKO. Additionally, if Dragonite is desperate, it can fish for a freeze to set up with Agility. Dragonite’s final moveslot is its most flexible, generally being used to suit what the team needs. Despite limiting Dragonite to just one consistent source of damage, Thunder Wave is a good option, as it can slow down offensive Normal-type Pokemon that will likely stay in against Dragonite and use Toxic. It can also incapacitate opposing Wrap Dragonite and catch faster Pokemon that often switch in, like Tentacruel and Gyarados. Furthermore, if you are afraid of missing Wrap and willing to sacrifice Dragonite, settling for paralysis on a key Pokemon is often a worthwhile trade. Dragonite boasts the strongest non-STAB Hyper Beam in the game, making it an excellent move for finishing off foes that have been chipped by Wrap. The move can KO Tentacruel and Hypno from around half health and even has a 30.8% chance to OHKO Kadabra. Body Slam functions much the same as Hyper Beam, albeit being notably weaker. The superior accuracy, paralysis chance, and lack of a recharge turn make the move a lot more reliable during sweeps, however. Finally, Thunderbolt is the best option for Omastar, which otherwise is relatively unafraid of Dragonite. The move is also notable for dealing heavy damage to Vaporeon, Dewgong, and especially Gyarados.</p> <p>AgiliWrap Dragonite can fit on the majority of teams, considering the larger number of Pokemon it can check and how universally threatening AgiliWrap is. Many key Pokemon in the tier are very afraid of Dugtrio, so Dragonite’s ability to come in on Earthquake and swiftly punish it with Blizzard is appreciated. While Pokemon such as Gyarados also accomplish this role, Dragonite is generally unbothered by Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon, making it a strong choice on teams with multiple Water-type Pokemon already. Dragonite can form very strong defensive cores with most Water-type Pokemon, especially Vaporeon. Vaporeon is very good at dealing with Ice-type moves and can improve the effectiveness of Wrap by spreading paralysis with Body Slam. The pair also makes Dugtrio struggle to gain momentum, as the opponent will have to constantly choose between using Earthquake and Rock Slide to net the most damage. Electric-type Pokemon, such as Electabuzz and Raichu, can pressure bulky Water-type Pokemon that can bully Dragonite. Raichu also has Surf to OHKO Golem, which takes Wrap chip damage very comfortably. Kadabra is another immensely good teammate for Dragonite. In addition to being quite good at spreading paralysis, Kadabra handles Toxic better than any other Pokemon thanks to Recover. This means it is a strong switch-in when Dragonite faces a Pokemon that must use Toxic to prevent AgiliWrap. Similarly, Poison-type Pokemon like Tentacruel, Venusaur, and Venomoth can also switch into predicted Toxic. Finally, users of sleep-inducing moves, like Haunter, Venusaur, Tangela, Poliwrath, and Hypnosis Hypno, give Dragonite an additional target to potentially set up on.</p>"

      "Wrap Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This Dragonite set is more of a defensive pivot and takes advantage of its wide movepool to improve many common matchups and reduce the danger of Toxic. While Dragonite is far from the fastest Pokemon in the tier, it is still quick enough to pressure Pokemon like Hypno, Tangela, and bulky Water-type Pokemon with Wrap. Additionally, Wrap can enable one of Dragonite's teammates to come in safely. Most often a strong offensive Pokemon, like Kangaskhan, Persian, Dodrio, Gyarados, or Articuno, will take advantage of this opportunity to take out a weakened foe. This strategy is especially effective against slower foes because Dragonite is not pressured to switch out immediately, meaning it can be difficult to predict when it will pivot to a stronger attacker. Wrap is less effective against faster foes, but still feasible if a Pokemon like Tentacruel tries to switch into Dragonite. In a case like this, Dragonite can then very easily pivot to something even faster, like Kadabra or Electabuzz, to threaten Tentacruel in return. Even without a boost from Agility, Wrap is very good for maintaining momentum.</p> <p>This set becomes very powerful with paralysis support, as it allows Dragonite to deal a lot of damage and pivot effectively against more Pokemon. Fast Pokemon that can threaten Dragonite like Kadabra and Electabuzz become almost trivial to manage after paralysis. This means Dragonite can be a strong choice late-game and avoid taking damage even without Agility. Thus, this set frequently makes use of Thunder Wave. Dragonite is one of the only Pokemon with Thunder Wave that can take a few hits from Normal-type attackers. It is a surprisingly strong check to Kangaskhan, Persian, and Dodrio, as it can switch in and pacify them with Thunder Wave. Thunder Wave can also nail some key Pokemon that are likely to switch in against Dragonite. As an example, Dugtrio is very likely to use Toxic against Dragonite and then switch out to something that can stomach a Blizzard. Common situations like this one allow Dragonite to paralyze important Pokemon like Vaporeon, Omastar, and even Tentacruel.</p> <p>Aside from Wrap and possibly Thunder Wave, the remaining moveslots are usually dedicated to some combination of offensive moves. Blizzard is the most common because it helps against Dugtrio, which is generally the Pokemon that encourages players to use Dragonite in the first place. It’s also the best option against the Normal-type Pokemon this set often seeks to face. Body Slam and Hyper Beam are strong options for picking off Hypno and frailer Pokemon like Kadabra, especially if they are paralyzed. Body Slam in particular is also notable for threatening to paralyze Dugtrio and fast Pokemon that are likely to switch in, much like Thunder Wave. Thunderbolt is the best option for the numerous Water-type Pokemon in the tier. A key advantage of this set is that, once the first three moves are used, most players will anticipate that its last move will be Agility; this lets it regularly catch Pokemon like Hypno and Omastar by surprise with a powerful attack.</p> <p>This set works best with Pokemon that can spread or benefit from paralysis. Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Dodrio, Gyarados, and Vaporeon fit in both categories, as they use Body Slam and become more dangerous against paralyzed foes. Hypno, Kadabra, and Electabuzz are common partners for their ability to spread paralysis. Conversely, Pokemon like Tentacruel, Articuno, and Golem appreciate Dragonite’s ability to paralyze Water-type Pokemon and pressure them with Wrap. Pokemon with a severe weakness to Dugtrio or the Normal-type Pokemon, like Haunter or Electabuzz, greatly benefit from this Dragonite set. Dugtrio itself is also a good partner, as it matches up well against Pokemon that take little or nothing from Wrap, like Omastar and Haunter, while also scaring off Tentacruel, which is often quite difficult to paralyze.</p>"
      },
      "PhysNite (Offensive)": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This offensive set allows uses Dragonite's large stats and movepool to break down walls and block certain Pokemon from making progress. In many ways, it performs similarly to Gyarados, being a solid check to Dugtrio that can pressure frail or slow Pokemon like Kadabra and Hypno. Specifically, PhysNite functions as a tank, shutting down Pokemon unable to immediately threaten it and firing off some of the most powerful attacks in the game and the crippling Thunder Wave. It is also a potent revenge killer, able to pressure Dugtrio and pretty much everything slower than it. The main trade-off in using Dragonite over Gyarados is the selection of Pokemon that each one checks. While Gyarados holds up better against bulky Water-type Pokemon, Tentacruel, Articuno, and opposing Dragonite, Dragonite matches up more comfortably against Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon. Essentially, this set is best on teams that need Gyarados’s set of attributes but may fear certain matchups.</p> <p>This set benefits a lot from how players conventionally react when facing Dragonite. Lacking Wrap, this set handles paralysis and poison better than any other. In fact, considering Dragonite has such a good matchup against Venusaur and Tangela, it is remarkably good at preventing them from putting something to sleep if it has been paralyzed. Handling status fairly well makes PhysNite quite comfortable taking on certain threats, like Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Tangela, that other Dragonite are likely to avoid out of fear of paralysis. Dragonite’s wide pool of offensive moves and access to paralysis gives it many strong head-to-head matchups, allowing it to fairly comfortably trade with several common Pokemon. Teams that struggle with just one specific Pokemon, like Dugtrio, a Grass-type Pokemon, or an Electric-type Pokemon, tend to be the best fit for this Dragonite set.</p>"
      },
      "Agility Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is Dragonite’s least common set, but it is still fairly effective. It forgoes Wrap and frames Dragonite as a more conventional Agility sweeper, like Articuno and Dodrio. While they can generally sweep much sooner than Dragonite thanks to having STAB moves, Dragonite maintains a few minor advantages over them that make it worth using. Firstly, Dragonite enjoys a generally superior defensive typing, meaning it can still act as a check to Pokemon like Dugtrio in a pinch. Secondly, Dragonite is a strong mixed attacker, which allows it secure endgames against a wider variety of Pokemon than other sweepers. Lastly, and most importantly, the mere sight of Dragonite strongly encourages certain foes to use Toxic. Unlike Wrap sets, this set is largely unfazed by Toxic. This means, unlike other Agility users, Dragonite can guarantee itself an almost free turn to set up against certain foes. If the opposing team is weak enough, Dragonite can quickly clean up with its impressive offenses and wide coverage.</p> <p>This set requires quite a fair deal more support to function than most sets. Bulkier Pokemon like Omastar, Vaporeon, and Articuno need to be brought into KO range of Thunderbolt or Hyper Beam before this set has any chance of succeeding. As such, this set tends to fit better on more offensive teams that can consistently damage foes and keep them from using Rest. Fast Pokemon like Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Electabuzz are thus among the best partners. Having a solid answer to Articuno is also advisable, as it is bulky enough to easily set up with Agility and then KO Dragonite, even if Dragonite has already set up itself. Also unlike the other sets, this Dragonite set has limited utility early-game and relies fairly heavily on surprise factor, making it most useful towards the very end of the game.</p>"
