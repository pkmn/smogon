Spore from Amoonguss can stop Trick Room setups and makes Porygon2 vulnerable to strong attacks such as Close Combat from Urshifu, Moonblast from Flutter Mane, and Sacred Sword from Chien-Pao without being able to heal the damage off with Recover. Amoonguss also underspeeds Porygon2, punishing Trick Room setups, meaning that once Trick Room is set up, Amoonguss can Spore Porygon2 before it attacks, removing its access to recovery and damage. Incineroar pressures Fake Out, which helps stop Trick Room. Additionally, Incineroar can use Knock Off to remove the Eviolite from Porygon2, making it easier to KO.

Incineroar and Amoonguss can slow down the pace of the game, Latias provides crucial speed control in Tailwind, and Rillaboom's Grassy Surge and Fake Out is appreciated by Registeel. Additionally, Latias and Rillaboom threaten Urshifu-R. Similarly, Raging Bolt is also a good Registeel partner, being the premier Urshifu-R counter in the format.</p> </li> <li> <p>Notable good matchups for Registeel include Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W, both of which get cleanly 2HKOed by Body Press after a single Iron Defense boost. Kingambit also does poorly against Registeel, as Swords Dance can be mitigated by Iron Defense and Body Press hits Kingambit very hard if it does not Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p>However, not all physical attackers are helpless against the IronPress Registeel. Both Urshifu formes can pose a threat, depending on Registeel's choice of Tera type. Chien-Pao can threaten heavy damage with Sacred Sword if Registeel has not used Terastallization.

Its ability, Drizzle, takes its offensive output to outrageous levels while also facilitating the rain offense archetype. Its base 90 Speed allows it to function in both Tailwind and Trick Room. Origin Pulse allows Kyogre to deal consistent damage if it loses HP, which reduces the power of Water Spout. Hydro Pump is another great option, which allows Kyogre to have a strong Water-type move which isn't spread, allowing it to play better against Wide Guard. Ice Beam can threaten Grass- and Dragon-types like Amoonguss and Koraidon, which take resisted damage from Kyogre's Water-type STAB moves. Mystic Water allows Kyogre to OHKO Calyrex-S and Kingambit with Water Spout, which also allows Kyogre to use defensive Tera type.

This can be solved by using Urshifu-R, which outspeeds most of the metagame with a Choice Scarf and threatens high damage with Surging Strikes, which can be boosted by Kyogre's rain. Tsareena is a good teammate for Assault Vest Kyogre, threatening Dragon- and Grass-types like Miraidon and Rillaboom with Triple Axel while also shutting down common priority attacks that threaten Kyogre like Grassy Glide from Rillaboom and Thunderclap from Raging Bolt with Queenly Majesty.

Moonblast provides a reliable STAB move that lets Whimsicott deal solid damage to common Fairy-weak Pokemon like Miraidon, Koraidon, Chien-Pao, and the Urshifu formes. Encore is Whimsicott's most infamous support option, letting it punish setup sweepers like Calm Mind Terapagos, IronPress Zamazenta-C, and Nasty Plot Calyrex-S for attempting to boost in front of it; the move also punishes foes from trying to stall out Tailwind turns with Protect, and it discourages Rillaboom from using Fake Out lest it be locked into it. Additionally, it forces Trick Room setters like Calyrex-I to untwist the dimensions. Taunt is a similarly useful disruption tool that can be used with or in place of Encore, notably allowing Whimsicott to deny Tailwind from other setters like Tornadus and Lunala unless they use Tera Dark. Protect helps Whimsicott keep itself on the field and stay in a position to use its other moves repeatedly, especially in the face of Fake Out users, but the last moveslot can also be spent on more aggressive options like Helping Hand, which is useful with any attacker, or Fake Tears, which is especially devastating alongside strong special threats like Chi-Yu. Whimsicott enjoys holding a Focus Sash to make up for its poor bulk, and Tera Ghost is useful to prevent the item from being wasted by Fake Out.</p> <p>Whimsicott's reliable Tailwind support is a blessing to almost every Restricted Pokemon, especially those with middling Speed tiers such as Groudon, Calyrex-S, and Terapagos.

Clear Amulet Koraidon is another notable partner that reliably discourages opponents from bringing Incineroar, which is easily the worst Pokemon for Whimsicott to face in a battle. Other strong attackers that benefit from Tailwind support are also great with it; Landorus and Urshifu-S both fall into this category, and Chi-Yu is a standout example because it augments Whimsicott's modest damage output with Beads of Ruin. Other setup Pokemon that enjoy Encore are especially useful to justify using Whimsicott on a team over Tornadus, including Calm Mind Raging Bolt, Swords Dance Ogerpon-H, and Nasty Plot Gholdengo. It's important to make sure Whimsicott has teammates that can deal with problematic Dark-types like Chi-Yu, Ting-Lu, and Kingambit due to their Prankster immunity, and a Fighting-type like Urshifu-R or Iron Hands can help with that significantly.</p>"

      "Tailwind Support": {
        "description": "<p>Tornadus is used as a support Pokemon that can set Tailwind for its team and deal semi-consistent damage with Bleakwind Storm. It is very good into Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Rillaboom, as Tornadus can easily use Taunt or threaten them with Bleakwind Storm. Tornadus can make use of its weather-setting abilities to help itself hit Bleakwind Storms or to help support its teammates by boosting or reducing the damage of Water- or Fire-type moves. Icy Wind provides a secondary form of speed control for Tornadus and helps against other Tailwind-based teams. Protect can also help against Fake Out if it holds Rocky Helmet Covert Cloak allows Tornadus to shine as a supportive piece, as it stops it from being flinched by the common Fake Out. It also prevents it from having its Special Attack lowered by Snarl. Rocky Helmet acts more as a repellent for attacks like Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes and Chien-Pao's Ice Spinner. It also can make Pokemon more wary of using Fake Out, as they will be constantly taking chip damage. The EV spread on this Tornadus allows it to take a Tera Water Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R. This can be really impactful on the Rocky Helmet set, as it forces Urshifu-R down to 50% of its health upon hitting it. It can also take an Astral Barrage from Choice Specs Calyrex-S. Tera Dark is mainly used to stop other Tornadus from using Taunt or Whimsicott from using Encore on it. It can also be used as a defensive Tera against Calyrex-S, as it resists or is immune to both of its STAB attacks. Tera Steel can be used to resist attacks from Pokemon such as Chien-Pao and the occasional Rock-type. It also removes a weakness to Electric, which can make it fare better against Raging Bolt.</p> <p>Tornadus is a good partner for many Pokemon thanks to its ability to support them through speed control and weather. One example of this is Chi-Yu, which makes use of Tornadus's ability to set sun and Tailwind to blast through opposing teams. Chi-Yu also helps Tornadus's Bleakwind Storms do more damage. Kyogre is another good partner, as Tornadus allows it to outspeed non-Tailwind teams with its below average Speed stat. Tornadus can also help to stop other weather teams from outdamaging Kyogre while letting Kyogre deal with opposing weather attackers. Tornadus benefits other Pokemon with its weather as well such as Urshifu-R, Koraidon and Archaludon. It can also provide a check to weather-setting Pokemon like Koraidon and Groudon with opposing weather. Checks to Tornadus include Miraidon and Raging Bolt. Their ability to resist its attacks and fire back with powerful Electric-type STAB moves can threaten both Tornadus and its common partners. One other check is Kingambit. Often, Tornadus cannot attack with Bleakwind Storm due to the threat of Defiant being activated. It can easily set up in front of Tornadus or, if it has Assault Vest, threaten its partner. Landorus, however, can help to beat some of these checks with strong Sandsear Storms in Rain while being immune to Miraidon's and Raging Bolt's Electric-type STAB moves. Trick Room teams are also a bad matchup, as they flip the Speed stats and make Tailwind useless. Calyrex-I is especially tough for Tornadus, as it can target it down with strong Glacial Lances or set Trick Room right in front of it.</p>"

Incineroar is naturally blessed with a typing that lets it take on both Restricted Pokemon, such as Lunala and Calyrex-S, and strong non-Restricteds like Chien-Pao, Rillaboom, and Chi-Yu. Will-O-Wisp ruins IronPress Zamazenta-C and Clear Amulet Calyrex-I; this is of great value, as they normally are not hindered by Intimidate since the former relies on its Defense stat to deal damage and the latter almost always runs Clear Amulet. Alternatively, Flare Blitz provides high damage output against Rillaboom and Amoonguss and OHKOes Chien-Pao. Taunt can also be utilized on specific teams, such as those with Calyrex-I, to shut down Amoonguss. Knock Off is crucial to OHKO Calyrex-S while removing items such as Safety Goggles from opposing Incineroar to aid its own partner Amoonguss. Holding Safety Goggles itself allows Incineroar to have a better matchup against Amoonguss, letting it ignore Spore and Rage Powder, but Sitrus Berry can viably be run to provide crucial longevity to Incineroar in this powerful Restricted metagame. The given EV spread allows Incineroar to always survive a Jolly Close Combat from Mienshao. As an added bonus, it also takes a +1 Defense Body Press from Zamazenta-C, allowing it to use Will-O-Wisp or get better positioning against Zamazenta-C's allies. The special bulk EVs allow Incineroar to avoid a 2HKO from +1 Life Orb Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage, letting it retaliate with Knock Off. 27 Speed IVs are run in order to get a slower Parting Shot than opposing Incineroar, allowing the user's Incineroar's Parting Shot to go off onto a freshly switched-in opposing Pokemon for greater value. Tera Ghost allows Incineroar to ignore Fake Out from opposing Incineroar or Rillaboom, Close Combat from Mienshao and either Urshifu forme, and Body Press from Zamazenta-C. Tera Grass lets Incineroar resist Water Spout from Kyogre while being immune to Amoonguss's Spore and Rage Powder, essentially functioning as a built-in Safety Goggles.

As useful as Incineroar is, it is severely threatened by Pokemon such as Koraidon and Kyogre, the former of which is immune to Intimidate thanks to Clear Amulet and can easily OHKO Incineroar with Collision Course. The latter is Incineroar's worst matchup, as it easily gets OHKOed by Water Spout and even Origin Pulse if rain is on the field. Miraidon is also a huge nuisance when used with Choice Specs, as it can either potentially OHKO Incineroar with Electro Drift or pivot around it with Volt Switch, chipping it or its allies down. The susceptibility to Koraidon can be mitigated by having Flutter Mane or Fairy Tera Raging Bolt as a partner, as both take advantage of Koraidon's sun via Protosynthesis and force it to Terastallize. Incineroar should also be carefully preserved against Calyrex-I because it commonly runs Clear Amulet and High Horsepower, which can 2HKO Incineroar. Incineroar also struggles against a top non-Restricted Pokemon in Urshifu-R, so allies such as Rillaboom and/or Amoonguss are appreciated to keep it and other threats like Kyogre and Miraidon in check.</p>"

Lunala's access to Wide Guard paired with its Ghost typing gives it a favorable matchup into popular restricted Pokemon like Calyrex-I and Zamazenta-C by blocking their strong STAB moves in Body Press and Glacial Lance, respectively. Trick Room allows Lunala to set the pace of the match to its favor, with Moonblast being a solid alternative to cover for Dark-types when speed control isn't necessary. The EV spread allows Lunala to take Wicked Blow and Life Orb-boosted Astral Barrage from Urshifu-S and Calyrex-S with Shadow Shield active. Tera Fairy removes Lunala's Dark and Ghost weaknesses while being a strong defensive typing itself, giving Lunala the opportunity to safely stay in against would-be checks like Incineroar and Flutter Mane while having the extra benefit of boosting Moonblast.</p> <p>Lunala naturally struggles against Dark- and Normal-types like Incineroar and Terapagos, both taking negligible to no damage from Moongeist Beam once Power Herb is used up by Meteor Beam. Calyrex-S also forces Lunala to either use Wide Guard or Terastallize to avoid major damage. Urshifu-R is a phenomenal partner for Lunala, as it's able to cover Lunala's weaknesses and OHKO threatening Pokemon like Incineroar, Terapagos, and Calyrex-S; it is also protected by Lunala's Wide Guard from strong spread moves like Bleakwind Storm and Astral Barrage. Incineroar also forms a solid defensive backbone when paired with Urshifu-R as well as generating opportunities for Lunala to set up Trick Room with Fake Out. Amoonguss provides redirection support as well as Pollen Puff healing to keep Lunala at full HP for Shadow Shield; it also synergizes extremely well with Lunala's other common partners like Urshifu-R and Incineroar. Tailwind + Trick Room teams that run Lunala also benefit from strong Tailwind setters like Tornadus and Whimsicott, giving Lunala the flexibility to go for a fast game mode in specific matchups.</p>"

Grassy Terrain also plays an important role of overriding other Terrains such as Electric Terrain from Miraidon and Psychic Terrain from Indeedee-F. Grassy Glide is used, since it allows Rillaboom to threaten Pokemon that are faster than it like Urshifu-R. High Horsepower is used to threaten super effective damage on Pokemon like Raging Bolt, Miraidon, and Incineroar. U-turn allows Rillaboom to switch in and out of the battle, helping it reset Grassy Terrain consistently. Protect can be utilized on Miracle Seed variants to block Fake Out as well as stall Trick Room. Choice Band allows Rillaboom to OHKO foes it normally doesn't, while Miracle Seed allows Rillaboom to use Fake Out and means that Rillaboom isn't locked into a single move. The EV spread allows Rillaboom to OHKO Urshifu-R with Miracle Seed Grassy Glide and almost always OHKO Calyrex-I with Choice Band Tera Grass Wood Hammer. In conjunction with Choice Band, Rillaboom can OHKO Miraidon with High Horsepower. The defensive investment allows Rillaboom to survive a Flare Blitz from Incineroar. Tera Grass is used to amplify Rillaboom's damage, while Tera Fire is used defensively to resist Fire- and Ice-type moves like Flare Blitz from Incineroar and Ice Spinner from Chien-Pao. Tera Fire can also be used to gain immunity to Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Rillaboom is a great partner to Zamazenta-C, which appreciates its offensive capability to threaten Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Calyrex-S, and Kyogre. Wide Guard support from Zamazenta-C can protect Rillaboom from spread moves like Glacial Lance and Astral Barrage, allowing it to stay on the field longer. Rillaboom pairs well with Chien-Pao, which provides another multiplier to Rillaboom's nuclear damage through Sword of Ruin; in return, Rillaboom helps Chien-Pao by OHKOing Urshifu-R. Urshifu-R and Incineroar are great teammates as well, as the trio forms the Fire / Water / Grass core. Rillaboom has a bad matchup against Incineroar and Tornadus, which resist its moves and threaten it with Flare Blitz and Bleakwind Storm, respectively. Furthermore, Incineroar is a counter to Rillaboom thanks to Intimidate and its ability to threaten Fake Out on Choice Band variants. Chien-Pao is another check, which can survive one attack thanks to Focus Sash and OHKO Rillaboom with Ice Spinner or Icicle Crash.</p>"

      "Bulky Support": {
        "description": "<p>Indeedee-F's typing, ability, and movepool make it an excellent support Pokemon. Its Normal / Psychic typing allows it to deal with Calyrex-S well, and Psychic Surge has immense utility in Regulation G, as it blocks priority moves like Fake Out from Incineroar and Rillaboom and Prankster Taunt from Tornadus while also denying the Terrains that power up Miraidon and Rillaboom. The combination of Follow Me and Trick Room allows Indeedee-F to threaten either setting up Trick Room itself or redirecting away attacking moves and Taunt to enable a partner to set up Trick Room. Once the dimensions have been twisted, it can use Helping Hand to make a partner Trick Room sweeper even more threatening. Its last move is usually an attacking move to make it less prone to Taunt; Dazzling Gleam pairs well with Tera Fairy and lets it damage both foes, while Psychic gives it a strong Psychic Terrain-boosted STAB move regardless of Tera type. Alluring Voice is an acceptable alternative to Dazzling Gleam, letting Indeedee-F punish setup sweepers like IronPress Zamazenta-C and Nasty Plot Calyrex-S while also bypassing the prominent Wide Guard. The Fairy-type attacks allow Indeedee-F to break Focus Sashes on Dark-types like Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Urshifu so its partner can remove them quickly. However, Psychic allows Indeedee-F to OHKO Urshifu-R. Psychic Seed complements Psychic Surge well, as it reinforces Indeedee-F's special bulk. Safety Goggles allows it to bypass Amoonguss's Rage Powder and redirect away Spore for the benefit of its teammates, while Rocky Helmet lets it damage physical attackers whose contact moves it can redirect; Rocky Helmet can even break a Focus Sash from an Urshifu or Chien-Pao and severely punish Urshifu-R for using Surging Strikes. Tera Fairy allows Indeedee-F to resist the Dark-type attacks that would otherwise threaten it such as Incineroar's Knock Off and Urshifu's Wicked Blow while powering up Fairy-type moves that it may carry. Alternatively, Tera Grass lets it bypass Amoonguss's disruption and become immune to its Spore without having to use Safety Goggles while also granting a resistance to Water- and Electric-type attacks from the likes of Urshifu-R and Miraidon.</p> <p>With Indeedee-F's utility, it can fit on a variety of teams that appreciate Psychic Terrain, redirection, or its ability to set Trick Room. Calyrex-S appreciates Psychic Terrain blocking priority moves, namely Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch, and powering up its Psychic-type attacks; it is even able to run the devastating Expanding Force with Indeedee-F. Calyrex-S also takes advantage of Indeedee-F's redirection to fire off more of its brutal attacks without fear of retaliation and also benefits from Helping Hand pushing its damage potential up to eleven. Calyrex-I pairs well with Indeedee-F, as it is both a Trick Room setter and a sweeper, meaning that the opponent is hard-pressed to stop either Pokemon from setting up Trick Room with Indeedee-F's support, and once it is set up, Indeedee-F immediately enables Calyrex-I to deal big damage with Helping Hand. Other Trick Room sweepers like Ursaluna, Ursaluna-B, and Torkoal appreciate that Indeedee-F can support them with Helping Hand and Follow Me on top of its ability to set up Trick Room. Indeedee-F is very vulnerable to Dark-types like Urshifu, Chi-Yu, and Incineroar, as the threat of their powerful moves makes it more hesitant to use Follow Me. It also hates Taunt, which completely shuts down all of its utility and thus its field presence. Rillaboom can also interfere with strategies predicated on Psychic Terrain blocking Fake Out.</p>"

Swords Dance allows Zacian-C to OHKO the entire unresisted metagame and boost faster than Incineroar's Intimidate cycling. Alternatively, Substitute can be used to let Zacian-C become immune to Intimidate and Fake Out once it is set up. The EV spread allows Zacian-C to survive Groudon's Precipice Blades and almost always +2 Behemoth Blade from opposing Zacian-C, as well as avoid the 2HKO from Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage. The Attack EVs help Zacian-C 2HKO Groudon, and the Speed enables Zacian-C to outspeed Adamant Chien-Pao. Zacian-C may opt for 164 Speed and 100 Attack with a Jolly nature to outspeed unboosted Iron Bundle while still threatening a 2HKO on Incineroar. Tera Water is Zacian-C's best Tera type, granting a resistance to Fire-type moves like Flare Blitz from Koraidon and Incineroar, while also being a great neutral typing against the metagame. Tera Grass is a good alternative on rain teams, providing Zacian-C with a resistance to Ground-type moves from Groudon and Landorus, as well as a Spore immunity. Both of these give it a crucial resistance to Kyogre's Water Spout. Zacian-C may opt for Tera Stellar to pick up OHKOs on Kyogre and Landorus with Play Rough and Behemoth Blade, respectively.</p> <p>Zacian-C struggles against Fire- and Steel-types like Ogerpon-H, Entei, and Gholdengo, as they wall its STAB moves and threaten it back. Incineroar especially is an issue, as it easily switches into Behemoth Blade and weakens Zacian-C with Intimidate. This is significant, as it negates Zacian-C's one-time Intrepid Sword boost, and lowers its sweeping potential. This makes Pokemon that can threaten them like Urshifu-R and Landorus fantastic partners. Zacian-C can threaten Raging Bolt and Chien-Pao for Urshifu-R and Landorus. Incineroar, Rillaboom, and Amoonguss are also great partners, providing Zacian-C with free turns thanks to Fake Out, Grassy Terrain recovery, and Rage Powder. Pelipper also pairs well with Zacian-C, providing rain to mitigate its weakness to Fire-type moves like Ogerpon-H's Ivy Cudgel and Incineroar's Flare Blitz. Wide Guard helps greatly against Calyrex-S, Kyogre, and Groudon; Zacian-C, in return, threatens Raging Bolt for Pelipper.</p>"

Fighting is an excellent offensive type in the current metagame, giving Zamazenta-C a great matchup spread against common Restricted Pokemon like Terapagos, Calyrex-I, Groudon, and Zacian-C; in addition, the popularity of Dark-types like Incineroar, Ting-Lu, and Chien-Pao is great news for it. Heavy Slam is a useful secondary STAB move that importantly covers Flutter Mane and damages other Fighting-resistant Pokemon more than an unboosted Body Press, reducing the amount of team support Zamazenta-C needs to circumvent its checks.  Behemoth Bash can be used instead to threaten a 2HKO on Tera Fairy Raging Bolt and a potential 2HKO on Calyrex-I. Wide Guard is an amazing utility option that can be used over Iron Defense or Protect as it protects against deadly spread moves like Astral Barrage and Water Spout, improving the Calyrex-S and Kyogre matchups considerably. 84 Defense EVs with an Impish nature give Body Press enough power to OHKO Miraidon and 2HKO most Fighting-resistant Pokemon after an Iron Defense boost, most notably Landorus and Tornadus, assuming Dauntless Shield is active. The given special bulk investment allows Zamazenta-C to survive Choice Scarf Chi-Yu's Flamethrower and avoid a 2HKO from most Flutter Mane variants. The Speed investment ensures that Zamazenta-C will outrun Adamant Ogerpon formes. Tera Grass is the most consistent Tera type, keeping Zamazenta-C's Fire weakness and worsens its chances against Flying-types like Tornadus; in exchange, it becomes immune to Amoonguss's powder moves and gains a resistance to Ground- and Electric-type attacks, which helps it greatly against Landorus, Miraidon, and Raging Bolt. . Alternatively, Tera Water lets Zamazenta-C shed all of its type weaknesses and giving it key resistances to Fire and Water, the latter of which is especially useful against Kyogre and Urshifu-R.</p> <p>As a bulky setup sweeper, Zamazenta-C performs at its best when its team is built around damage mitigation and redirection strategies, giving it as many opportunities as possible to set up Iron Defense and fire off its attacks. Rillaboom is an excellent partner that helps Zamazenta-C by providing Fake Out support, recovery from Grassy Terrain, speed control with Grassy Glide, and a useful typing that lets it check Miraidon and Kyogre. Incineroar can make Zamazenta-C even more unbreakable on the physical side with Fake Out and Intimidate, and as a Dark-type, it provides an important check to Calyrex-S. Raging Bolt boasts great offensive and defensive synergy with Zamazenta-C, picking off weakened targets with Thunderclap while helping against Kyogre and Urshifu-R; it can also run an effective Calm Mind set that appreciates the support options that Zamazenta-C wants on its team anyway. Redirectors like Amoonguss and Ogerpon-W give Zamazenta-C even more setup opportunities, and the former can take this a step further by disabling foes with Spore and healing Zamazenta-C with Pollen Puff. Flutter Mane can slow down faster Pokemon with Icy Wind or help break physical tanks with a Choice Specs set; either way, it's great for threatening faster Restricted Pokemon like Koraidon, Miraidon, and Calyrex-S. Ting-Lu can augment Zamazenta-C's special bulk with Vessel of Ruin, check Miraidon and Calyrex-S, and chip foes into Body Press's KO range with Ruination.</p>"

Urshifu-R's best partner is Tornadus, as it can support Urshifu-R with Tailwind to counter opposing speed control, Rain Dance to boost the power of Urshifu-R's Water-type STAB moves, and Bleakwind Storm to threaten opposing Grass-types like Rillaboom that would threaten Urshifu-R. It can also use Taunt to ensure that Amoonguss cannot use Spore or Rage Powder to disrupt Urshifu-R. Pelipper provides rain with its ability and has a STAB Flying-type attack in Hurricane to threaten Grass-types, and it can use Wide Guard to protect Urshifu-R from the variety of spread moves in the format, including Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S and Water Spout from Kyogre. It also can support Urshifu-R with Helping Hand. Amoonguss can handle Electric- and Grass-types that would threaten Urshifu-R by redirecting attacks away from it with Rage Powder. Urshifu-R forms a formidable pivoting core with Rillaboom and Incineroar, with the three spamming U-turn or Parting Shot to stay ahead of the opponent's switches, reactivate Fake Out, cycle Intimidate, and let Urshifu-R choose new moves to lock into. Incineroar helps take on opposing Rillaboom and Amoonguss for Urshifu-R, while Rillaboom deals with Kyogre and opposing Urshifu-R well and slows down Miraidon. Both of them can use Fake Out to prevent one of the opposing Pokemon from attacking, letting Urshifu-R attack the other without interference. Fake Out also often forces foes to use Protect, which Urshifu-R can attack through.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Urshifu-R is an excellent offensive Pokemon that can threaten metagame staples such as Incineroar, Chien-Pao, and Terapagos thanks to its fantastic typing and STAB moves, enabled by Unseen Fist. Taunt is utilized to shut down supportive Pokemon and Trick Room setters such as Amoonguss and Farigiraf as well as prevent Pokemon like Calm Mind Terapagos and Raging Bolt from setting up. Aqua Jet is a great alternative to get around Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and pick off weakened foes, which is especially useful, as Urshifu-R ignores Protect. Urshifu-R may opt for Swords Dance to become a deadly sweeper, allowing it to OHKO Rillaboom and, after Intimidate, Terapagos-S with Close Combat. Mystic Water boosts Urshifu-R's STAB moves without drawback and allows it to OHKO Incineroar through Sitrus Berry. Safety Goggles lets Urshifu-R ignore Amoonguss's Spore and Rage Powder, which is significant, as Amoonguss resists Urshifu-R's STAB moves; this also provides opportunities for Urshifu-R to set up. The defensive investment allows Urshifu-R to survive Rillaboom's Miracle Seed-boosted Grassy Glide and almost always survive Raging Bolt's Thunderclap. The Speed EVs allow Urshifu-R to outspeed -1 Flutter Mane and Miraidon. Tera Water sheds Urshifu-R's weaknesses to Flutter Mane's Fairy-type STAB moves, Calyrex-S's Psyshock, and Pelipper's Hurricane, as well as greatly boosting its damage output, allowing it to 2HKO Calyrex-I with Surging Strikes and OHKO Chi-Yu with Aqua Jet once Terastallized. Urshifu-R may use Tera Grass to obtain resistances to Rillaboom and Raging Bolt's priority attacks as well as a Spore and Rage Powder immunity. Tera Ghost can be opted for instead to provide Urshifu-R with a Fake Out immunity, allowing it to keep momentum, and a Fighting immunity that lets Urshifu-R take on Zamazenta-C.</p> <p>Urshifu-R struggles against Rillaboom and Raging Bolt, which take its attacks exceptionally well and threaten it with strong priority STAB moves. Ogerpon-W is also an issue, as it can redirect Surging Strikes and is faster, allowing it to hit Urshifu-R for huge damage with Horn Leech. This makes Tornadus and Amoonguss great partners, as Tornadus can threaten the Grass-types, and Amoonguss can protect Urshifu-R from Raging Bolt with Rage Powder. Tornadus can also provide speed and weather control, making up for Urshifu-R's mediocre Speed tier and handling the otherwise problematic Koraidon, which can significantly weaken Urshifu-R with the sun it sets up. Taunt is another great tool that allows Tornadus to shut down Amoonguss for Urshifu-R. Urshifu-R can take on threats like Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu for the two in return. Alternatively, Rillaboom is an excellent pick, as it can pivot in Urshifu-R and threaten Ogerpon-W. Incineroar can pair with Urshifu-R and either Amoonguss or Rillaboom to create a fantastic pivot core, switching in on threats like Rillaboom. Rillaboom and Incineroar also bring Fake Out, which synergises with Unseen Fist. Urshifu-R is also a great asset to Calyrex-S, as it has the ability to remove Ghost-resistant foes like Incineroar and Terapagos.</p>"

It has a great matchup into Incineroar, since it ignores Intimidate with its signature move Surging Strikes, can switch into Chien-Pao and Calyrex-I, and is able to deal significant damage to Terapagos with Close Combat. Aqua Jet is almost unstoppable with Unseen Fist and can pick off Pokemon low on HP or deal damage before Urshifu-R gets KOed. Taunt gives it a much better matchup into Amoonguss, shutting it down almost completely, and it prevents Calyrex-I from setting up Trick Room. Focus Sash gives it more survivability and helps with its relatively low Special Defense. Tera Water allows Urshifu-R to deal incredibly high damage with Surging Strikes, allowing for an OHKO against common threats such as Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao through Focus Sash. Tera Stellar lets it OHKO Terapagos-S with Close Combat but loses the consistency of Tera Water, since Urshifu-R can no longer use boosted Surging Strikes repeatedly.</p> <p>Urshifu-R works incredibly well in Calyrex-S teams, since it can threaten the Normal- and Dark-types that Calyrex-S struggles with, such as Terapagos and Incineroar. In exchange, Calyrex-S can deal with Raging Bolt, which is one of the most common checks to Urshifu-R, as Raging Bolt can use Thunderclap before Urshifu-R can move to bring it down to Focus Sash while also being able to switch-in on Surging Strikes. Urshifu-R synergizes well with Rillaboom and Incineroar, since Fake Out and Unseen Fist are a deadly combination, punishing passive plays such as Protect that try to avoid the flinching turn. Their typings also have incredible synergy with each other, allowing them to switch in on many attacks that Urshifu-R is threatened by. With its great physical bulk and natural type advantage, Rillaboom is a great check to it, slowing Urshifu-R down with Fake Out or doing high damage to it with Wood Hammer or Grassy Glide. Urshifu-R also struggles with Amoonguss, which is able to completely wall it while protecting its teammates with Rage Powder or putting it to sleep with Spore. Tornadus is a good partner for Urshifu-R, helping with its average Speed stat by setting up Tailwind, heavily increasing the damage Urshifu-R does while making the Koraidon matchup easier by using Rain Dance and threatening the Grass-types which could otherwise be problematic such as Amoonguss and Rillaboom with Bleakwind Storm. Koraidon and Miraidon are some of the Restricted Pokemon that have the best matchup into Urshifu-R, as Koraidon is able to set up sun and greatly reduce its damage, while Miraidon is able to outspeed it and bring it down to Focus Sash while also pivoting out with Volt Switch.</p>"

Calyrex-I runs High Horsepower for coverage, letting it hit Fire- and Steel-types that resist Glacial Lance, such as Incineroar and Gholdengo. Calyrex-I runs Clear Amulet for an immunity to Intimidate and Incineroar's Parting Shot. Tera Fire will give it an immunity to Will-O-Wisp and improve its match up into Gholdengo.

        "description": "<p>With blazing Special Attack, high Speed, and As One making it even more threatening after picking up a KO with its powerful Astral Barrage, Calyrex-S is the most powerful sweeper in the game. Nasty Plot allows it to take advantage of the opponent playing passively to become unstoppable. Psyshock threatens opposing Calm Mind users such as Terapagos and Raging Bolt. Draining Kiss can also be used to hit Dark-types and provide Calyrex-S with recovery. Expanding Force can be an option when paired with Indeedee-F, as it has more power than Psyshock in general. Nasty Plot is a must on Spell Tag sets but can be eschewed in favor of an attacking move for Life Orb and Choice Specs variants; sometimes, Shadow Ball is used on Choice Specs to get around Wide Guard. Choice Specs maximizes Calyrex-S's power in return for less flexibility, while Life Orb is mainly used on Expanding Force sets in order to increase the damage output of both STAB moves while keeping the flexibility of Protect. Alternatively, Spell Tag gives Calyrex-S a boost to its main STAB moves with no drawbacks. The HP and Defense investment allows Calyrex-S to survive Tera Water Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R, and maximum Speed investment is run for opposing Calyrex-S, which can be crucial in deciding the game, as they both either OHKO each other with Astral Barrage or force Terastallization. The Special Attack investment allows Calyrex-S to OHKO bulkier Flutter Mane with Spell Tag, allows Life Orb variants to 2HKO Incineroar with Astral Barrage after a boost from Nasty Plot, and ensures that Choice Specs variants almost always OHKO Calyrex-I from full HP. Fairy is the main Tera type for Calyrex-S, as it is neutral into the majority of the metagame and flips the matchup against Urshifu-S while also boosting the power of Draining Kiss. Ghost is an alternative, however, to boost Astral Barrage's power to even more dangerous levels.</p> <p>Calyrex-S being given an opportunity to set up Nasty Plot can end the game, so Pokemon with Fake Out and redirection support are highly appreciated. Incineroar, Rillaboom, Amoonguss, and Ogerpon-W are all common partners. Amoonguss also has the benefit of thriving under Trick Room, a matchup which Calyrex-S struggles against, due to its high Speed and frailty being turned against it. Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Urshifu-R are used to deal with Ghost-resistant Pokemon like Incineroar, Terapagos, and Chien-Pao. Speed control is a common way to take advantage of Calyrex-S's frailty, such as using sun to activate Protosynthesis on Flutter Mane, which can OHKO Calyrex-S with Shadow Ball and 2HKO it with Moonblast, regardless of whether Calyrex-S Terastallizes. Therefore, Pokemon that can provide speed control to keep it the fastest Pokemon on the field, like Tornadus, make an excellent fit and have the advantage of also helping in the Calyrex-S mirror matchup. Indeedee-F is a notable partner for Calyrex-S, giving it redirection in Follow Me and Helping Hand support while being able to reverse opposing Trick Room, block threatening priority such as Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao and Urshifu-S, and turn Expanding Force into a brutal sweeping tool.</p>"

Its access to Nasty Plot, shooting up its Special Attack to astronomical levels, in conjunction with its ability to hit most Pokemon for neutral or super effective damage like Rillaboom and Calyrex-I make it a Pokemon that every team needs to be more than adequately prepared for. Calyrex-S's Ghost typing crucially allows it to be immune to Fake Out from the likes of Incineroar and Rillaboom. Psyshock hits specially defensive Pokemon like Calm Mind Terapagos and Raging Bolt and those holding Assault Vest like Rillaboom hard. Psychic can be run instead to guarantee an OHKO on Urshifu-R, since Psyshock is a damage roll to do so. Alternatively, Draining Kiss lets Calyrex-S hit Dark-types such as Urshifu-S while maintaining longevity. Tera Blast can, however, be run over Draining Kiss in conjunction with Tera Fairy for higher power. Focus Sash ensures that Calyrex-S gets at least two attacks off thanks to its high Speed. Tera Ghost boosts Astral Barrage even further, leaving only Incineroar that can survive it at +2. Tera Fairy allows Calyrex-S to easily take Wicked Blow, Sucker Punch, and Knock Off from the likes of Urshifu-S, Chien-Pao, and Incineroar, respectively, while also powering up its own Fairy-type move of choice.</p> <p>Calyrex-S, though highly oppressive with Astral Barrage alone, faces difficulty wearing down the ubiquitous Incineroar while also being completely unable to hit Terapagos with Astral Barrage.

Incineroar and Rillaboom are also good allies as they provide Calyrex-S with Fake Out and recovery, letting it set up Nasty Plot more easily. Clefairy and Amoonguss are other good allies, as they redirect attacks away from Calyrex-S, allowing it to fire off Astral Barrage safely. The former also bolsters Calyrex-S's bulk with Friend Guard and can help it almost always move first even under Trick Room, thanks to After You; this is important because Calyrex-S is very vulnerable under the twisted dimensions.

    "overview": "<ul> <li> <p>Dondozo is a formidable threat thanks to its stats being doubled when combined with Tatsugiri's Commander ability. Due to its immense bulk, Dondozo is difficult to remove without adequate answers, easily sweeping through entire teams on its own.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dondozo performs best with offensive threats that can break apart teams for it and still function independently without needing to pivot. Examples include Chien-Pao and Dragonite, as well as Tornadus and a sweeper such as Urshifu-S or Flutter Mane. The two cores utilize strong speed control and get off massive damage early, allowing Dondozo to clean up. Glimmora is another excellent partner, as its ability and signature move put foes on a timer, forcing them to burn through Dondozo before fainting to Toxic poison.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dondozo struggles against Pokemon that can ignore its stat boosts, either by neutralizing or bypassing it entirely. Both Urshifu formes and Chien-Pao with Sacred Sword ignore Dondozo's Defense boost, with Chien-Pao both outspeeding and threatening Dondozo if it uses Tera Grass, and Urshifu-S dealing big damage with Wicked Blow and removing Dondozo's ability to stall with Protect. Incineroar and Gouging Fire are able to consistently weaken Dondozo with Breaking Swipe and Intimidate cycling respectively. A combination of Incineroar and Amoonguss is particularly difficult to handle, as Amoonguss can keep Incineroar safe with redirection and Incineroar is free to cycle Parting Shot and Intimidate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dondozo requires much more experience to properly play compared to other sweepers, due to only making plays with one Pokemon for most of the game. While its not impossible to play into certain difficult matchups, especially with a strong composition and much practice, it necessitates significant reads and good positioning of Dondozo to win.</p> </li> </ul>",

        "description": "<p>Farigiraf's main role is as a bulky disruption piece and Trick Room setter, and its ability to block priority is incredibly valuable in a format full of moves like Fake Out, Grassy Glide and Thunderclap. Due to its typing, it has a good matchup into Calyrex-S, as well as Psychic-type STAB moves are generally good into the metagame but especially into Amoonguss and Urshifu-R. Tera Blast is often seen in this slot, as both before and after Terastallization, it gives Farigiraf a consistent single-target STAB move. Foul Play is used to give Farigiraf a way to hit both Calyrex formes for super effective damage, being able to 2HKO both. Electric Seed is used in tandem with Miraidon, and gives Farigiraf more bulk, allowing it to stick around longer to support the team with Helping Hand and Armor Tail. Sitrus Berry allows Farigiraf to disrupt the opponent for longer than it would be able to without it. It can also help live some double-ups to help safely get Trick Room up, such as Surging Strikes + Knock Off from Urshifu-R and Incineroar, respectively. Safety Goggles is for if your team has a particularly bad matchup into Amoonguss and Farigiraf wants to be able to set up Trick Room without being put to sleep without Electric Terrain support from Miraidon. The HP and Special Defense EVs allow Farigiraf to live a Choice Specs Beads of Ruin single target Tera Starstorm from Terapagos, and the rest is put into Defense. Tera Ground is used next to Miraidon to allow it to freely use Discharge, and Tera Fairy allows it to resist the Dark- and Bug-type moves it'd otherwise be weak to like Knock Off and U-turn from Incineroar and Rillaboom, while also resisting Fighting-type attacks and gaining an immunity to Dragon-type moves, like Collision Course and Draco Meteor from Koraidon and Miraidon, respectively.</p> <p>Farigiraf really doesn't like Restricted Pokemon that can OHKO it and potentially prevent Trick Room, such as Kyogre or Tera Fire Koraidon. It also struggles against fast Taunt users, such as Speed Booster Energy Flutter Mane, due to them being able to prevent Trick Room from going up, and bulky Dark-types like Incineroar, as Farigiraf can't hit them very hard without Tera Ground. Incineroar in particular can force a Tera with Knock Off. Miraidon and Farigiraf are great partners for each other, as Farigiraf stops Miraidon from being interrupted by Fake Out, which is particularly important for the Choice Specs set and Miraidon can activate the Electric Seed, making Farigiraf even bulkier, and as previously mentioned, Farigiraf can even Tera Ground so Miraidon can freely click Discharge next to it while the Electric Terrain makes Farigiraf immune to Amoonguss's Spore. Farigiraf itself benefits from partners that can help it set Trick Room, such as bulky Fake Out users like Incineroar and Rillaboom, as well as redirectors like Amoonguss and the Ogerpon formes. Trick Room sweepers also like having Farigiraf as a partner; for example, Calyrex-I loves the boost from Helping Hand, and so does Ursaluna-B. Another great partner is Iron Hands on the aforementioned Miraidon teams, as Farigiraf enjoys having a Fake Out user as a partner, and its Helping Hand lets Iron Hands do insane levels of damage with Quark Drive.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Flutter Mane is one of the fastest Pokemon in Regulation G, and almost nothing can outspeed it with a Booster Energy equipped, making it an excellent form of speed control thanks to Icy Wind; in addition, its excellent STAB combination gives it useful offensive presence against the many Dark-, Fighting-, and Dragon-types of the metagame, such as Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu, both Urshifu formes, Miraidon, and Koraidon. Two single target STAB moves are the default for the excellent coverage they offer, but Moonblast can be swapped out for Dazzling Gleam if bypassing redirection from the likes of Amoonguss, Indeedee-F, and Ogerpon formes is a priority. One of these attacking options can also be exchanged for Taunt, letting Flutter Mane shut down Amoonguss, deny Trick Room, and frustrate setup sweepers like Calm Mind Terapagos and IronPress Zamazenta-C. Icy Wind provides a form of speed control that benefits a variety of mid- to high-Speed teammates. Thunder Wave provides Flutter Mane with extra speed control that also works against Clear Amulet Pokemon such as Koraidon. The given EV spread allows Flutter Mane to survive incredibly powerful hits like Groudon's Precipice Blades and Choice Scarf Chi-Yu's Overheat; it can also tank a Choice Specs Astral Barrage or Tera Ghost Life Orb Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S after Terastallizing. 100 Special Attack EVs ensure a 2HKO on bulkless Chi-Yu with Moonblast and almost always on Calyrex-I with Shadow Ball. 108 Speed EVs with a Timid nature let Flutter Mane outspeed Iron Valiant, which could otherwise use Icy Wind first and ruin Flutter Mane's role as a speed control Pokemon. Tera Fairy is the default Tera type, since it helps Flutter Mane both offensively and defensively, notably allowing it to OHKO Miraidon and Urshifu-R with Moonblast and Dazzling Gleam, respectively, but Tera Grass can also be useful to help deal with Amoonguss's powder moves and Water-, Ground-, and Electric-type attacks like Surging Strikes from Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, Precipice Blades from Groudon, and Electro Drift from Miraidon.</p> <p>Flutter Mane pairs well with many Restricted Pokemon, as its high Speed and Fake Out immunity allows it to almost always move first and use Icy Wind; Terapagos is perhaps the most notable partner, as its Speed is quite poor in a vacuum, but it only needs a single Icy Wind to outpace a major chunk of the metagame. Kyogre is also a good choice because Flutter Mane discourages Koraidon from switching in to change the weather against it. Spread attackers like these as well as Calyrex-S and Groudon also benefit from Flutter Mane threatening common Wide Guard users, such as Mienshao and Iron Valiant. In general, any Pokemon that struggles with Dragon- or Dark-types will benefit from Flutter Mane's offensive presence, including Pokemon such as Incineroar, Rillaboom, Ogerpon-H, Ogerpon-W, Chi-Yu, Calyrex-S, and Lunala. In addition, offensive Fire-types like Chi-Yu and Ogerpon-H are useful for threatening the Steel-types that Flutter Mane struggles with, such as Zacian-C and Kingambit. Pokemon that offer damage mitigation via Intimidate or some other means, such as Incineroar and Snarl users like Ting-Lu and Raging Bolt, can help Flutter Mane stay on the field significantly longer, giving it more time to fire off its powerful attacks.</p>"

Flutter Mane can use support moves such as Taunt over Shadow Ball to prevent opposing Pokemon like Calyrex-I or Amoonguss from setting Trick Room or using moves like Spore, respectively. When paired with Pokemon that set sun such as Koraidon or Groudon, Flutter Mane can use Protosynthesis to boost its Speed and use Icy Wind as a form of speed control, outspeeding and slowing down Pokemon such as Calyrex-S. Dazzling Gleam gives Flutter Mane a spread option that it can boost with Terastallization. Focus Sash lets Flutter Mane live a hit without needing to invest EVs in bulk. Tera Fairy and Stellar both allow Flutter Mane to OHKO Raging Bolt; Tera Stellar allows Shadow Ball to pick up KOs like those against all opposing Flutter Mane. However, Tera Fairy is more consistent, since it can use Fairy-type STAB moves without worrying about losing the boost.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Urshifu-R threatens Flutter Mane when paired with Pokemon such as Tornadus or Pelipper that can set rain for it, removing both Flutter Mane's Speed boost and the sun. Assault Vest Rillaboom can take Flutter Mane's attacks, threaten it with Wood Hammer, and finish it off on the subsequent turn with Grassy Glide. Flutter Mane pairs well with Pokemon that can redirect attacks away from it such as Ogerpon and Amoonguss, since this allows it to maintain its Focus Sash and stay on the field longer. In addition to redirecting attacks, Amoonguss matches up well into Urshifu-R. Raging Bolt can remove Pokemon such as Urshifu-R that threaten Flutter Mane while also reliably switching into Rillaboom's Wood Hammer and Grassy Glide.

The combination of Armor Tail and Trick Room from Farigiraf and Fake Out from Iron Hands almost guarantees Trick Room is set up, which allows Iron Hands to dish out massive damage with Close Combat and Wild Charge. Tornadus is another good form of speed control for Iron Hands, since it can catch opponents off guard and synergizes better with faster offensive partners like the Urshifu formes and Ogerpon-H becauase their high Speed stats do not allow them to function in Trick Room effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>Iron Hands is weak to Pokemon that help mitigate damage like Incineroar and Landorus-T, since they can cycle Intimidate. This is a huge detriment for Iron Hands, since it is a Pokemon that likes staying on the field and whittle down its foes. Lowering its Attack stat does not allow it to do its job nearly as well.

      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Raging Bolt is an incredibly bulky special attacker that can stay on the field and survive hits from Restricted Pokemon, and threaten them back with its huge Special Attack stat and weaken their team with stat reducing moves. It matches up incredibly well into Urshifu-R, keeping it in check with Thunderclap, Koraidon, since it commonly doesn't run Dragon-type moves, common Fire / Water / Grass cores, which usually have Incineroar, Rillaboom, and Urshifu-R or Ogerpon-W, and multiple strong special attackers with Snarl, such as Kyogre, Calyrex-S, and Terapagos. Electroweb gives Raging Bolt a solid speed control option while still dealing relevant damage.  Thunderbolt is a consistent and strong STAB option, and Volt Switch gives it a strong way to reposition itself. Assault Vest allows it to survive hits more easily from strong special attackers such as Calyrex-S, Terapagos, Kyogre, Flutter Mane, and opposing Raging Bolt while punishing them with a Snarl, Electroweb, or stronger attacking move. The EV spread allows it to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S, survive an Icicle Crash from Chien-Pao, and outspeed -1 Gholdengo and Adamant Urshifu. Tera Electric significantly increases the damage it does at the cost of remaining vulnerable to strong Ground-type attackers such as Landorus and Groudon, while Tera Fairy allows it to gain an immunity to threatening Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Miraidon and opposing Raging Bolt while still having a very strong defensive typing into the current metagame.</p> <p>Raging Bolt synergizes well with multiple Pokemon and can work on many team structures, but some notable partners are Incineroar, since it can reduce the threat from physical moves that Raging Bolt cannot weaken, Koraidon, since it activates Raging Bolt's ability Protosynthesis by setting up sun, and Urshifu-R, which checks multiple strong threats to Raging Bolt like Calyrex-I, Flutter Mane, Chien-Pao, and Landorus. Another Pokemon that checks Raging Bolt is Amoonguss, since Raging Bolt can't stop a Spore from going off and Raging Bolt's attacks can be redirected by Rage Powder without many issues. It is also vulnerable to Fake Out, since Raging Bolt is unable to use Protect to block it because of its Assault Vest, and variants without Draco Meteor can't threaten Incineroar for high damage, allowing it to use Parting Shot and pivot out relatively safely.</p>"

      "Three Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>Raging Bolt's high Special Attack, bolstered by Booster Energy increasing its damage output significantly, makes it an immediate force to be reckoned with. It has positive matchups against Kyogre and Urshifu-R, resisting their STAB attacks and threatening huge damage or an OHKO on them, respectively, with its STAB moves. Raging Bolt also matches up well against Koraidon, threatening an OHKO with Draco Meteor or Dragon Pulse. Draco Meteor allows Raging Bolt to pick up valuable KOs with a risky drawback, while Dragon Pulse lets it deal consistent damage. The given EV spread allows Raging Bolt to survive Precipice Blades from Groudon and Ice Spinner from Chien-Pao, while the Special Attack investment nets OHKOs on Landorus and Ursaluna-B with Draco Meteor. Tera Electric provides a powerful damage boost, allowing Raging Bolt to pick up OHKOs on Kyogre and Tera Ghost Urshifu-R and a 2HKO on Sitrus Berry Incineroar with Thunderbolt, which it usually would not be able to do. Tera Fairy provides a Dragon immunity against Dragon-types that threaten Raging Bolt such as Miraidon on top of removing all of its original weaknesses and providing a good defensive typing.</p> <p>Raging Bolt struggles against strong Ground-types such as Landorus, Ursaluna-B, and Groudon, all of which deal significant damage to it, while Calyrex-I is very difficult for Raging Bolt to remove due to its high bulk and potential to OHKO it in return. This makes Calyrex-I and Pelipper exceptional partners, as they threaten OHKOs on Landorus, Ursaluna-B, and Groudon. Additionally, Calyrex-I threatens Landorus and Groudon after they use Tera with High Horsepower, while Pelipper provides Wide Guard support, making it extremely difficult for opposing Calyrex-I to remove. Ogerpon-W provides valuable redirection while comfortably surviving attacks from the aforementioned Ground-types, as well as threatening KOs on them with Ivy Cudgel. Farigiraf prevents Raging Bolt from using Thunderclap and often uses Tera Fairy, granting it immunity to Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse, while Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane also threaten to deal siginificant damage on Raging Bolt. As a result, Zamazenta-C is a great partner, 2HKOing Farigiraf before and after using Tera with Body Press and either Heavy Slam or Behemoth Bash, respectively, as well as easily OHKOing Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane. Incineroar is also an exceptional partner, as it is capable of reducing Calyrex-I's damage through Will-O-Wisp, being difficult for Farigiraf to KO, and dealing significant damage to Chien-Pao with Flare Blitz.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Raging Bolt's good natural bulk allows it to function well as a bulky setup sweeper. It has good matchups against Kyogre and Urshifu-R due to STAB Thunderclap. Dragon Pulse is commonly used to break Pokemon that resist Thunderclap, like opposing Raging Bolt and Miraidon. Dragon Pulse may also aid against Pokemon with redirection like Ogerpon-W or Armor Tail Farigiraf that blocks Thunderclap. Leftovers is the preferred item on Calm Mind Raging Bolt due to the increased longevity, especially when paired with Grassy Terrain support from Rillaboom. Alternatively, Raging Bolt can use Booster Energy for an immediate power boost, threatening an OHKO on Miraidon and a 2HKO on Calyrex-S. 244 HP and 52 Defense EVs allow Raging Bolt to survive Adamant Chien-Pao's Ice Spinner. The HP and Special Defense EVs allow +1 Special Defense Terastallized Raging Bolt to survive two attacks from both Modest Flutter Mane's Moonblast and Landorus's Earth Power. 92 Speed EVs allow Raging Bolt to outspeed 4 Speed Rillaboom. Tera Fairy is the Tera type of choice because it provides Raging Bolt an even matchup into most of the format.</p> <p>Good partners for Calm Mind Raging Bolt include Rillaboom because it can provide Grassy Terrain and create free turns with Fake Out, allowing Raging Bolt to set up more safely. Similarly, Incineroar is often paired with Raging Bolt, since it can offer damage reduction and Fake Out support. Redirection, such as Ogerpon-W's Follow Me, is greatly appreciated by Raging Bolt. Groudon and Koraidon are also good partners for Raging Bolt, since they can activate its Protosynthesis ability and check Pokemon like Amoonguss and Zacian-C, which are common checks for Raging Bolt. Amoonguss threatens Raging Bolt's Thunderclap via Rage Powder redirection and Spore. Zacian-C, Groudon, Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Calyrex-I, and Landorus can threaten Raging Bolt before and after it Terastallizes.</p>"

Access to Helping Hand also further amplifies its partner's ridiculous damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Iron Crown's best counters are Dark- and Steel-types, namely Incineroar, Kingambit, Archaludon, and Gholdengo, all of which resist both of Iron Crown's STAB moves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Therefore, Iron Crown appreciates Pokemon that can help remove these threats consistently, such as Landorus, Entei, and Urshifu-R. In return, Iron Crown can pressure opposing Urshifu-R and Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rillaboom is another noteworthy check, as it is able to safely pivot in and override Psychic Terrain, weakening Expanding Force significantly. Other Pokemon with access to Ice Spinner like Chien-Pao and Dragonite can also be used to remove Psychic Terrain.</p> </li> <li> <p>Faster Pokemon like Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane serve as good checks as well, but they have to watch out for Follow Me from Indeedee-F as they are vulnerable to Tachyon Cutter.</p> </li> </ul>",

  "Terapagos": {
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Terapagos can be used as a hyper offensive threat with its high Special Attack and powerful spread move, Tera Starstorm. Choice Specs immediately boosts the damage output from Tera Starstorm, allowing Terapagos to pick up early-game KOs, which the more common Calm Mind set cannot. Its natural bulk in addition to Tera Shell allows it to withstand powerful attacks that other hyper offensive threats may not be able to. Terapagos has a very good matchup into the oppressive Calyrex-S with an immunity to Astral Barrage. Teraform Zero disrupts strategies revolving around Miraidon, Groudon and Kyogre's Terrain- and weather-setting abilities. Tera Starstorm is the attack Terapagos will want to use most of the time, but Earth Power and Dark Pulse provide coverage for Steel- and Ghost-types that its partners may not be able to comfortably defeat, like Zamazenta-C and Calyrex-S. Hyper Beam allows Terapagos to pick up KOs around Wide Guard users while Terastallized. Sleep Talk allows Terapagos to continue dealing significant damage even when put to sleep from moves such as Amoonguss's Spore.</p> <p>With a middling Speed stat, Terapagos greatly benefits from Tailwind support, which allows it to outspeed and significantly damage its foes more effectively. Tornadus is the best priority Tailwind setter in the format, so it is naturally a great partner for Choice Specs Terapagos. It also deals super effective damage to Fighting-types that threaten Terapagos like the Urshifu formes. Tornadus can utilize priority Taunt to shut down Wide Guard users, most Trick Room setters, and Spore from opposing Amoonguss. Zamazenta-C is very difficult for Terapagos to defeat because of its natural typing and Wide Guard, so it relies on a partner Chi-Yu to defeat it or cripple its offense with Will-O-Wisp. Chi-Yu easily defeats Steel- and Ghost-types that Terapagos struggles against and provides Beads of Ruin support. Amoonguss provides great redirection support with Rage Powder in the face of threats such as Mienshao and both Urshifu formes, and it can shut down threats with Spore. Pollen Puff benefits Terapagos with healing, reactivating Tera Shell. Flutter Mane can check Koraidon with its natural typing as well as provide Icy Wind and Taunt support. Lunala is tough to break with its high natural bulk and Shadow Shield alongside Wide Guard, but a partner Incineroar can weaken its Special Attack and KO it with Snarl and Knock Off. Ting-Lu's great special bulk thanks to Assault Vest and Vessel of Ruin is very difficult for Terapagos to break through, and it can reduce Terapagos's Special Attack further with Snarl. This makes Urshifu-R a great partner, forcing Ting-Lu to Terastallize to remove its weakness to Urshifu-R's STAB moves while gaining a weakness to Terapagos. Koraidon can survive Tera Starstorm and threaten an OHKO on Terastallized Terapagos in return. A partner Flutter Mane forces Koraidon to Terastallize, making it weak to Terapagos. Pelipper is tough for Terapagos to break due to its access to Wide Guard and immunity to Earth Power, so it appreciates partners such as Raging Bolt to threaten Pelipper.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Terapagos is a bulky setup sweeper, with Tera Shell boosting its already great longevity with its high natural bulk. In addition to this, Tera Starstorm becomes a powerful unresisted spread move when Terapagos Terastallizes. Earth Power is ran to allow Terapagos to deal significant damage to Steel-types and Wide Guard users it otherwise would struggle to defeat, notably Zamazenta-C. Leftovers benefits Terapagos's longevity when it does not have a partner to heal it, allowing Tera Shell to be reactivated. Covert Cloak is also a great item, as it prevents Terapagos's Special Attack from being lowered by opposing Snarl and provides the bonus of making it immune to flinch from Fake Out. Clear Amulet is used similarly to Covert Cloak but also prevents Parting Shot lowering Terapagos's Special Attack. Terapagos matches up very well against Calyrex-S, as it is immune to Astral Barrage, and damage from Draining Kiss and Expanding Force can be mitigated by its massive bulk bolstered by Tera Shell, Special Defense boosts from Calm Mind, and partners such as Amoonguss with Rage Powder and Pollen Puff. Teraform Zero disrupts strategies revolving around Miraidon, Groudon and Kyogre's terrain and weather setting abilities. The given EV spread allows Terapagos to survive Collision Course from Koraidon on the physically defensive side and Electro Drift from Choice Specs Miraidon on the specially defensive side with Tera Shell active or while Terastallized. With the bulk the spread provides, Electro Drift becomes a guaranteed 3HKO with Leftovers recovery after Electric Terrain is removed. The Special Attack investment maximizes the value of Terapagos's Calm Mind boosts, the Speed investment lets it outpace 4 Speed investment Rillaboom, and the HP EVs maximize the recovery gained from Leftovers.</p> <p>Rillaboom is a great partner for Terapagos, providing Grassy Terrain recovery and Fake Out to allow it to gain Calm Mind boosts. Incineroar is another great partner, as it can assist Terapagos in defeating Steel- and Ghost-types with Flare Blitz and Knock Off, as well as providing defensive utility through Intimidate, Parting Shot, and Will-O-Wisp on top of Fake Out. Amoonguss supports Terapagos very well, providing HP recovery with Pollen Puff. Its Rage Powder and Spore also allow Terapagos to safely use Calm Mind. Terapagos struggles to defeat Calyrex-I-centred teams, as it is very reliant on a partner Incineroar to reduce the physical damage it takes and deal super effective damage to Calyrex-I. Zamazenta-C can use Wide Guard, preventing Terapagos from dealing damage with Tera Starstorm while Terastallized, and Terapagos is very reliant on Earth Power as well as partners like Incineroar to deal super effective damage to it. As a result, Gholdengo pairs well with Terapagos, since it reliably checks both Calyrex-I and Zamazenta-C with its natural typing. Koraidon can be troublesome, as it can outdamage Terapagos's teammates' recovery while it is setting up with Calm Mind. Taunt Flutter Mane sets cause huge problems for Terapagos, since it cannot damage Flutter Mane significantly if Flutter Mane has not Terastallized, and Terapagos deals little damage without Calm Mind boosts.</p>"
