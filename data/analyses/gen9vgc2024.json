    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Alolan Ninetales heavily struggles against Gholdengo, being unable to punish it with Encore or threaten it with its STAB moves. Fire-types like Incineroar, Hisuian Arcanine, and Volcarona put pressure on Alolan Ninetales while shrugging off all of its attacks. Opposing weather control like Tyranitar and Torkoal are also major issues, making Alolan Ninetales's Blizzard inaccurate and Aurora Veil useless.</li> <li>Dragonite works well with both sets, providing speed control and taking on the Fire-types Alolan Ninetales is weak to, especially with Stomping Tantrum.</li> <li>Offensive Alolan Ninetales is strongest with other offensive threats to overwhelm the opposing team with Pokemon that cover each other's checks. The most notable of these are Sneasler and Kingambit. Sneasler can threaten Incineroar for a lot of damage and has a faster Fake Out but struggles to damage Dragonite and Gholdengo. Alolan Ninetales can cover for Dragonite and Kingambit can take on Gholdengo.</li> <li>Screens setter Alolan Ninetales works best alongside multiple setup sweepers that can steal the game when supported well. Annihilape and Gholdengo cannot be slowed down by Fake Out and hit the majority of the metagame for great damage. Annihilape and Gholdengo also notably take care of Incineroar and Sneasler, two of Alolan Ninetales's toughest matchups.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Offensive Alolan Ninetales's primary role is as a fast sweeper with unique support options. It is best when dishing out early damage while being supported by Fake Out or redirection and going down after taking on what it's expected to handle so Alolan Ninetales's teammates can clean up. Screens setter Alolan Ninetales is strongest when it sets up screens for its team and faints soon after, ensuring its teammates can take full advantage of the Aurora Veil turns and being not nearly as passive.</li> <li>Offensive Alolan Ninetales's flexibility allows it to be an excellent lead Pokemon, threatening foes with powerful Blizzards, Icy Wind speed control, and often Aurora Veil support. This lets it adapt in many lead matchups and position itself in a way to win the game. Choice Specs Alolan Ninetales also plays similarly, as its damage output is rather forceful from turn 1. After Alolan Ninetales impacts the game, it's good to send out your other offensive Pokemon that can finish the job most efficiently. Screens setter Alolan Ninetales also finds itself as a lead, but for different reasons. Alolan Ninetales can use its many support options to set the board for sweepers like Gholdengo and Annihilape to come in and set up. Alolan Ninetales may want to Terastallize if opposing Pokemon threaten to KO it before it sets up Aurora Veil or when interested in sticking around for Icy Wind and Encore support.</li> <li>Gholdengo is Alolan Ninetales's most reliable answer, as Alolan Ninetales cannot threaten it or lock it into a move with Encore. Alolan Ninetales is also 4x weak to Make It Rain and weak to Shadow Ball after Terastallizing into a Ghost-type. Tyranitar is also a great counter, overriding weather and passively breaking Alolan Ninetales's Focus Sash. It's wise to use Kingambit and Annihilape to threaten these Pokemon while preserving Alolan Ninetales, by switching it out once its checks enter the field.</li> </ul>",

Aurora Veil is a great move to increase the team's longevity when Alolan Ninetales can't do a lot on the field or take advantage of defensive play. Encore can be used over these two to better punish defensive play and discourage Fake Out, especially if Alolan Ninetales does not carry Protect. Moonblast and Dazzling Gleam are great secondary STAB moves on Choice Specs variants, threatening 2HKOs on Kingambit and Annihilape, respectively, and ensuring Alolan Ninetales doesn't get walled by Incineroar.

It can be used with Pokemon with abilities that cannot be disabled like Calyrex-S and Pokemon with abilities that are not always necessary for them to function such as Iron Hands and Roaring Moon. It works best against Pokemon with abilities that are important to their performance, such as Prankster Whimsicott and Tornadus, and those that boost their damage and set up Terrain or weather to help their team, such as Miraidon, Koraidon, and Kyogre. Dazzling Gleam can be used for reliable damage and to break Focus Sashes while ignoring redirection, but Strange Steam can be used for a higher chance to OHKO Roaring Moon and Koraidon. Toxic Spikes is used to wear down foes over time, allowing Galarian Weezing's partners to easily clean up late-game. Additionally, it works well against teams without a grounded Poison-type like Amoonguss to absorb Toxic Spikes. Poison Gas is best against Pokemon that intend to set up and stay on the field for a while, such as Calm Mind Terapagos, especially since it is a spread move and cannot be redirected, though it can be blocked by Wide Guard. Protect can bait out Fake Out if Covert Cloak is not being used and can stall turns to rack up poison damage. Covert Cloak can ensure Toxic Spikes is set up against Fake Out users, Sitrus Berry improves survivability, and Mental Herb stops Taunt and Encore from disrupting Toxic Spikes and Poison Gas setup. 12 Speed EVs is used to outspeed Farigiraf and Incineroar with low Speed investment. The EVs in Special Defense allow survival of Astral Barrage from Choice Specs Calyrex-S and Water Spout from Mystic Water Kyogre, given that rain is not active. The defensive investment allows for a high chance to survive Precipice Blades from Groudon and guaranteed survival of Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R. Tera Dark gives Galarian Weezing a resistance to Calyrex-S’s STAB attacks. Tera Grass grants an immunity to Spore and turns its weakness to Ground-type attacks such as Landorus-I's Earth Power into a resistance as well as granting a resistance to Electric-type attacks like Electro Drift from Miraidon. Tera Water grants a resistance to Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I.</p> <p>Faster Taunt users such as Whimsicott shut down the status options of Galarian Weezing without Mental Herb, and sets without Sitrus Berry are vulnerable to high damage from double targeting. Poison-types such as Amoonguss wall Galarian Weezing and absorb Toxic Spikes, preventing it from inflicting poison. Since Galarian Weezing typically cannot deal immediate damage, it relies on its teammates to win games, and it will often lose late-game against offensive Pokemon. Galarian Weezing is often partnered with Calyrex-S because its As One ability is unaffected by Neutralizing Gas. Additionally, Galarian Weezing is commonly paired with Dondozo and Tatsugiri, as a Commander-boosted Dondozo can sweep teams that have been weakened by poison damage, and it can effectively stall out poison damage by using Protect and recovering from Leftovers. Fighting-type teammates like Urshifu-R and Iron Hands can take advantage of Terapagos's Tera Shell being disabled to OHKO it with Close Combat. Indeedee-F supports these teams by providing redirection and providing Psychic-type offense on its own. Ogerpon-C can use Follow Me to guarantee Galarian Weezing's Toxic Spikes setup. Roaring Moon can threaten Psychic-types with Knock Off and provide Tailwind for the team.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Since Magmar’s primary role is redirection, it pairs best with teammates that can either apply immediate offensive pressure or set up for a potential sweep. Although there are other popular teammates like Gholdengo and Dragonite that work well with it, Magmar has been used mainly on a specific balance composition, consisting of Kingambit, Rillaboom, Sneasler, Primarina, and Dragapult to round out the Fire / Water / Grass core.</li> <li>Kingambit is a great partner for Magmar because it can set up safely with Swords Dance and exert significant offensive pressure. Plus, with priority Sucker Punch, Magmar realistically only needs to buy Kingambit one turn. Similarly, Gholdengo is another great partner for it, safely stacking Nasty Plot boosts and sweeping with Make It Rain. Additionally, Magmar can redirect potential Sucker Punch from an opposing Kingambit and burn it with Will-O-Wisp so Gholdengo doesn't outright lose to Kingambit.</li> <li>Rillaboom synergizes with Magmar by providing coverage for common Water-types like Primarina and Basculegion-M and Ground-types like Ursaluna-B that threaten Magmar. In return, Magmar redirects attacks that threaten Rillaboom, most importantly Dire Claw from Sneasler.</li> <li>Primarina works well with Magmar, as it will safely chip away at foes with Hyper Voice without worrying about Dire Claw, Wood Hammer, or Spore from Sneasler, Rillaboom, and Amoonguss. Magmar also pressures Steel-types like Gholdengo and Assault Vest Kingambit that Primarina has a hard time against.</li> <li>Sneasler puts pressure on many relevant Pokemon, including those that Magmar struggles against, like Archaludon and Primarina. Magmar supports Sneasler by helping it maintain its Focus Sash for longer and focus on its role as a glass cannon. Also acting as a glass cannon, Dragapult appreciates redirection, which allows it to safely spam Dragon Darts and deal large amounts of chip damage to both foes.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Magmar's playstyle is straightforward; it enables its teammates to secure KOs while it tanks the hits. For balance compositions, it's the defensive backbone of the team.</li> <li>Typically, Magmar is better as a lead to safely establish early-game offensive dominance with glass cannons like Sneasler and Dragapult or setup sweepers like Swords Dance Kingambit. Once Magmar has fainted and momentum has been established, you can bring in another offensive threat and clean up.</li> <li>One of the biggest flaws of Magmar is spread damage. While this largely can't be avoided, some of the common spread moves can be mitigated with the proper positioning. For example, Expanding Force in Psychic Terrain can be made single target by a well-timed Rillaboom swap, and Eruption from Hisuian Typhlosion can be tanked well by Primarina, which can dish back solid damage. Magmar also struggles against standard Archaludon rain teams. To deal with this, Sneasler, Rillaboom, and Kingambit are solid choices. Sneasler threatens Archaludon with its STAB attacks even if Archaludon Terastallizes, while Rillaboom can handle Basculegion-M effectively. Kingambit pressures everything with boosted Sucker Punch, especially Archaludon before it accumulates too many Stamina boosts.</li> </ul>",

Tailwind gives Galarian Moltres a supportive role in providing speed control for its team, allowing it to outspeed and fire off Fiery Wraths and Foul Plays. Black Glasses helps boost Galarian Moltres's damage output even more, allowing it to OHKO Calyrex-S and pairing well with potential Berserk boosts. The Speed investment allows Galarian Moltres to outspeed Choice Scarf Urshifu-R with Tailwind active, as well as naturally outspeeding most Gholdengo. The defensive investment allows Galarian Moltres to have a good chance of surviving a +2 Tera Fairy-boosted Draining Kiss from Calyrex-S or a Flare Blitz from non-Tera Fire Koraidon. Tera Dark sheds Galarian Moltres's Ice and Electric weaknesses, and the increased damage to its Dark-type STAB moves allow it to threaten an OHKO on Calyrex-I.</p> <p>Galarian Moltres typically struggles against Pokemon that can reliably win the damage trade versus it like Raging Bolt and Zamazenta-C. Amoonguss is able to comfortably tank Galarian Moltres's attacks and retaliate with Spore. Miraidon and Urshifu-R are also problematic matchups for Galarian Moltres, as Miraidon is able to outspeed and OHKO it, while Urshifu-R takes minimal damage from Galarian Moltres and can hit it in return with a Surging Strikes. While Zamazenta-C is is a great check against Galarian Moltres, it is also an amazing partner. Galarian Moltres gives it speed control and strong super effective damage against the Ghost-types Zamazenta-C would typically struggle against while Zamazenta-C grants Wide Guard support for Galarian Moltres, allowing it to effectively counter Calyrex-I. Fairy-types that would try to counter Galarian Moltres like Flutter Mane and Tera Fairy Calyrex-S are also covered by Zamazenta-C's Heavy Slam. Rillaboom is able to deal with opposing Urshifu-R trying to take advantage of their Dark resistance, as well as overriding Electric Terrain from Miraidon and threatening an OHKO with Choice Band-boosted High Horsepower.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Dragonite is a very common bulky physical attacker on balance and physically offensive Coaching teams. Dragonite shines particularly well against weakened teams. It also appreciates redirection or speed control to make up for its mediocre Speed. It works well at supporting teams against hyper offensive teams, with its Multiscale sets allowing it to survive attacks from many common wallbreakers, including Garchomp and Kingambit. Dragonite works well on balance teams, which value more the great consistency and versatility in matchups and the support it can provide to the team through Haze and Tailwind.</li> <li>Dragonite works very well in tandem with Gholdengo and Kingambit, which can cover the Fairy- and Ice-types that may threaten Dragonite. Dragonite also appreciates Coaching support from partners such as Sneasler, which can allow it to mitigate Defense drops from Scale Shot and become difficult to remove for many teams with just a few Coaching boosts. Additionally, redirection from Amoonguss and Fake Out from Rillaboom and Incineroar allow it to better fulfill both its offensive and supportive roles on a team.</li> <li>Dragonite's main issues are its relatively low Speed, weakness to Intimidate, and inability to hit Fairy- and Steel-types except with relatively weak coverage options. Therefore, partners like Kingambit and Sneasler can help hit Dragonite's checks heavily. Additionally, Coaching can help shore up its lesser damage output, particularly against Intimidate from Incineroar, and Defiant from the aforementioned Kingambit as well as Annihilape can help punish Intimidate cycling. Another issue for Dragonite are Pokemon that are faster than it and can threaten to OHKO it, such as Dragapult, Alolan Ninetales, and Garchomp. Therefore, redirection is of great use to these Dragonite sets to deal with such threats.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Dragonite's main role on teams is as a bulky attacker that can also provide support for its team through Haze and Tailwind. It uses its power and priority to clean up weakened teams while maintaining usefulness throughout the game.</li> <li>Dragonite is best used for its heavy damage output and large bulk, so it must be positioned it carefully around potential threats. Dragonite is at its best when Multiscale is kept intact, so keeping it away from weak attacks that may break it is crucial, as having Multiscale can allow Dragonite to tank a powerful hit from a threatening Pokemon and KO back. It can be used as a strong lead into offensive strategies or as a late-game cleaner against more balanced teams. It can also provide important support for its team if it is running Tailwind.</li> <li>Dragonite's biggest issues are against Steel-types that are capable of withstanding its coverage options, such as Gholdengo and Corviknight, and strong Fairy- and Ice-types like Alolan Ninetales. To mitigate these threats, position your other Pokemon that can handle them and hit them with heavy damage early in the game with partners such as Sneasler and Incineroar so Dragonite can pick them off later in the game once correctly positioned. Another way around these threats is with redirection to protect Dragonite or Coaching support so it can overpower its checks.</li> </ul>",

However, this Tera type can leave it vulnerable to other important attacks, including Dire Claw from Sneasler and Make It Rain from Gholdengo.

Redirection from Indeedee-F and Electabuzz helps Hisuian Typhlosion attack without having the Base Power of Eruption lowered, though it doesn't help against spread moves. Choice Specs is almost always paired with Prankster Tailwind support, mainly from Whimsicott, that allows Hisuian Typhlosion to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame.

Access to Foul Play allows Umbreon to tackle physical threats such as Calyrex-I as well as threatening Calyrex-S with a huge amount of damage. Snarl helps tremendously against special attackers like Terapagos, Calyrex-S, and Lunala, dealing a decent chunk of damage to the latter two. Helping Hand can also be used in this slot to further boost the team's offensive pressure to help secure KOs, such as Helping Hand-boosted Tera Fairy Zacian-C OHKOing Incineroar with Play Rough. Yawn is Umbreon's primary means of disruption, forcing the opponent to keep switching their Pokemon to prevent them from being put to sleep, while Taunt helps shut down opposing support Pokemon like Amoonguss or any Trick Room setters such as Farigiraf and Calyrex-I. Moonlight, on the other hand, increases Umbreon's longevity on the field and is especially useful in sun teams. Safety Goggles gives it a much needed immunity to Amoonguss, which can otherwise completely shut down Umbreon with Spore and Rage Powder. The EV spread allows Umbreon to survive a Collision Course from Koraidon outside weather, a Tera Fairy Moonblast from Flutter Mane, and prevents the 2HKO from a rain-boosted Weather Ball and Thunderbolt from Pelipper and a Special Attack Booster Energy Raging Bolt, respectively. Tera Water is an excellent defensive Tera type, further bolstering Umbreon against Calyrex-I, Kyogre, and Urshifu-R. On the other hand, Tera Poison provides a resistance to Fairy and Fighting-type moves such as Flutter Mane's Moonblast, Koraidon's Collision Course, and Urshifu's Close Combat.</p> <p>Despite its longevity and disruptive options, Umbreon provides little to no offensive pressure most of the time. Pokemon like Zacian-C, Zamazenta-C, Koraidon, and the Urshifu formes instantly threaten Umbreon with their STAB moves, while faster Taunt users such as Incineroar and Flutter Mane shut down its support options. Umbreon pairs well with offensive Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Koraidon that can handle the aforementioned threats and take advantage of its Yawn pressure, with the latter setting up sun to maximize the healing provided by Moonlight. Rillaboom partners well with Umbreon because it functions as a Kyogre and Urshifu-R check while providing Grassy Terrain recovery and positioning through its U-turn. Meanwhile, Urshifu-R compliments Umbreon's support role by providing solid offensive pressure by pinning opponents with Surging Strikes, OHKOing Incineroar and Flutter Mane with the move.</p>"

It benefits from teammates that provide utility, such as Fake Out or redirection, enabling it to set up Trick Room and go on the offensive, as well as teammates that can take advantage of Trick Room.</li> <li>Porygon2 is most commonly paired with Incineroar, which offers Fake Out support to allow Porygon2 to set up Trick Room. It also provides Intimidate and Parting Shot utility, enhancing Porygon2’s survivability. Parting Shot is especially valuable, as it allows Incineroar to pivot to a Trick Room sweeper while Porygon2 sets up Trick Room. Additionally, Incineroar’s access to Flare Blitz and Knock Off helps to threaten Pokemon like Gholdengo, which would otherwise wall Porygon2.</li> <li>The preferred Trick Room sweeper for Porygon2 teams is Ursaluna, as it takes full advantage of Trick Room by securing OHKOs on many Pokemon with its Guts boost. This pairing also works well because Porygon2 threatens special damage, while Ursaluna dishes out massive physical damage. Garchomp is another excellent offensive partner for Porygon2 because Garchomp provides a faster-paced, non-Trick Room-dependent offensive option for Porygon2 but with a less explosive damage output than Ursaluna.</li> <li>Amoonguss is a common support partner for Porygon2, taking full advantage of Trick Room with its low Speed and putting foes to sleep with Spore to allow Porygon2 to attack unthreatened. It also provides Rage Powder redirection, enabling Porygon2 to set up Trick Room freely, and Pollen Puff to heal Porygon2, reducing the need for it to constantly use Recover.</li> <li>Gholdengo is a common offensive partner for Porygon2, as it walls Pokemon like non-Throat Chop Sneasler, which can threaten massive damage to Porygon2, and Amoonguss, which can disrupt Porygon2 by putting it to sleep with Spore before it sets up Trick Room or deals much damage. Additionally, the threat of Nasty Plot boosts forces opponents to focus on Gholdengo, potentially allowing Porygon2 to move freely.</li> <li>Flamigo and Sneasler are used on Porygon2 teams, as they threaten Incineroar, which can hinder Porygon2 with Knock Off and Parting Shot, as well as threats like Archaludon, Kingambit, and, in Flamigo's case, Gholdengo with Close Combat. Sneasler has the added benefit of threatening status with Dire Claw and Poison Touch, while Flamigo has Wide Guard utility to protect Porygon2 from moves like Eruption from Hisuian Typhlosion and Make It Rain from Gholdengo.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>As a defensive unit with offensive potential, Porygon2 excels when it is minimally threatened by high-damage moves, such as Close Combat from Sneasler and Choice Specs Tera Fire Eruption from Hisuian Typhlosion. This necessitates pivoting and relying on its teammates to handle major damage dealers, enabling Porygon2 to safely set up Trick Room, heal itself as needed, and retaliate with substantial damage.</li> <li>The optimal strategy for using Porygon2 involves pivoting between Pokemon like Incineroar and Amoonguss until Porygon2 and its partner sweepers like Ursaluna achieve a strong offensive position. This includes cycling Intimidate and Parting Shot with Incineroar to stack stat drops while using Amoonguss's Spore to stop opposing threats. By doing so, you create a window for Porygon2 and its offensive partners to safely attack and capitalize on the advantageous board state.</li> <li>Due to Porygon2's relatively unoppressive presence, it's susceptible to being outpaced offensively, which is largely unavoidable. However, the best way to deal with this is by pivoting between teammates like Incineroar and Amoonguss to cycle Intimidate, use Spore, or provide redirection until Porygon2 and its offensive partner are in a favorable position. As mentioned earlier, Incineroar's Knock Off and Parting Shot significantly impair Porygon2's offensive and defensive capabilities, which is why Pokemon like Garchomp and Flamigo are employed to take down Incineroar. Additionally, cycling Fake Out from Incineroar and Rillaboom can be particularly threatening for Porygon2, as it may allow an opposing Pokemon to set up or chip away at Porygon2, potentially causing it to faint before it can use Recover. This is why Pokemon like Flamigo and Sneasler are often included, as they can threaten common Fake Out users as well as setup threats like Kingambit and Gholdengo.</li> </ul>",

Wide Guard blocks the plethora of spread moves in the metagame that ignore Smeargle's Follow Me, such as Tera Starstorm and Glacial Lance from Terapagos-S and Calyrex-I, respectively. This can, however, be replaced with Decorate on more offensive Calyrex-I teams, letting Trick Room threats like Calyrex-I and Ursaluna-B do significantly more damage quickly. Fake Out is the best last move on Smeargle, providing lots of pressure when it enters the field and opening up room for repositioning or setting up. Smeargle can use Spiky Shield over Fake Out for added longevity and to keep Focus Sash intact against opposing Fake Out. Transform can be used to utilize Smeargle as an offensive threat and win condition, especially when transforming into partner Calyrex-S or opposing Restricted Pokemon. Smeargle requires Focus Sash to make up for its horrendous bulk. Smeargle can also opt for an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def with a Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs on Trick Room teams, enabling Smeargle to boost its partners with Decorate before they attack. Moody is the primary ability on Smeargle, as it has a good chance of allowing Smeargle to take more attacks or threaten fast Spore. Calyrex-I teams can utilize Own Tempo to make sure Smeargle is always slow to function under Trick Room. Smeargle prefers Tera Ghost to escape Fake Out, but it may use Tera Grass on a team with Farigiraf for the immunity to Spore and Rage Powder from Amoonguss, as well as the resistance to Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes, which would otherwise OHKO it through Focus Sash.</p> <p>Smeargle struggles due to its lack of offensive pressure as a full support Pokemon.

Tera Normal boosts Entei's Extreme Speed significantly, allowing it to pick up OHKOs on Tornadus and Landorus-I with Sword of Ruin and 2HKOs on Urshifu-R and Kyogre whilst providing defensive utility in removing Entei's weaknesses to Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type attacks, namely Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R, Earth Power from Landorus-I, and Ivy Cudgel from Ogerpon-C, and notably allowing it an immunity to Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S.</p> <p>Entei, whilst being a powerful offensive threat, does struggle with many metagame threats, namely powerful Water-types in Urshifu-R and Kyogre, which can tank Entei's attacks easily and KO back; Raging Bolt, which can easily survive the majority of its moves and threaten back with heavy damage; and Landorus, which can threaten it with Ground-type STAB moves whilst utilizing Tera Ghost to avoid Extreme Speed. Additionally, Entei can struggle with being locked into moves by Choice Band, so foes like Incineroar and Pelipper and faster offensive Pokemon like Miraidon can take advantage of it being locked into its Fire-type STAB moves, whilst Ghost-types such as Calyrex-S can benefit if Entei locks into Extreme Speed. Additionally, Entei's reliance on a priority move for its damage output can lead to it struggling greatly against priority-blocking effects from the likes of Indeedee-F and Farigiraf. Entei partners particularly well with Chien-Pao, as it can assist Entei in wallbreaking through increasing Entei's damage output with Sword of Ruin and threaten the Ghost-types that can take advantage of Entei as well as Landorus, Miraidon, Farigiraf, and Indeedee-F, whilst Entei in turn threatens Chien-Pao's counters, namely Chi-Yu. Other great partners for Entei include Rillaboom, which provides Fake Out support for Entei whilst also providing Terrain control that can help against Miraidon and Indeedee-F, and Flutter Mane, which can control the speed of the battle and also threatens Miraidon, and both can threaten Entei's main answer in Urshifu-R. The Restricted Pokemon Entei is most commonly partnered with is Zamazenta-C, as Zamazenta-C threatens Entei's potential answers, such as Incineroar and Ogerpon-C, and Entei can chip some of its common checks, namely Landorus, whilst being able to threaten Ogerpon-H and Chi-Yu, which can assist Zamazenta-C greatly.</p>"

Snarl weakens special attackers like Calyrex-S, Terapagos, and Kyogre. Tailwind provides speed control for the team, while Mist finds a niche in protecting the team from stat drops, such as from Intimidate and Snarl. Roar allows Suicune to prevent Trick Room from going up by forcefully switching out setters like Farigiraf and Calyrex-I and can neutralize setup attempts from Pokemon like Calm Mind Terapagos while tanking attacks like Glacial Lance and Tera Starstorm thanks to its excellent defenses. Meanwhile, Helping Hand boosts the partner Pokemon's damage output to quickly KO opposing Pokemon. Icy Wind is a nice alternative in this slot for a lingering Speed reduction, which can come in handy when facing Calyrex-S and Zacian-C. Safety Goggles grants an immunity to Spore and Rage Powder and is especially useful to force out Trick Room setters with Roar while ignoring Amoonguss. Leftovers, on the other hand, provides passive recovery to further increase Suicune's longevity when combined with its natural bulk. The EV spread allows Suicune to avoid a 3HKO from -1 Choice Specs Terapagos's and Calyrex I's Tera Starstorm and High Horsepower, respectively, and turns Koraidon's Collision Course into a 3HKO after Leftovers recovery. The Special Defense EVs let Suicune survive two Astral Barrages from +1 bulky Calyrex-S. The Speed investment enables Suicune to outspeed most Rillaboom, helping it set up Tailwind before Rillaboom can hit it with a Wood Hammer. Tera Dark provides a resistance to Ghost-type attacks like Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage, an immunity to its Psyshock, and an immunity to Prankster Taunt from Tornadus and Whimsicott, and it also enables Suicune to 2HKO Calyrex-S with Snarl.</p> <p>Due to its passive field presence, Suicune is immediately threatened by strong super effective attacks like Volt Switch and Electro Drift from Miraidon, Thunderbolt from Raging Bolt, and Wood Hammer from Rillaboom. Pokemon carrying Covert Cloak, like Calyrex-S and Terapagos, can simply choose to ignore Suicune and set up. Prankster Taunt users like Tornadus can shut down most of Suicune's support options as well, unless it Terastallizes. This makes fast offensive Pokemon like Zacian-C excellent partners for Suicune, as they outspeed and threaten to OHKO most of the aforementioned Pokemon while appreciating the protection against stat drops provided by Suicune's Mist. Landorus counters threatening Electric-types like Miraidon and Raging Bolt and deals massive damage to Rillaboom with Sludge Bomb. Incineroar provides Fake Out and Intimidate support, gets rid of Covert Cloak with Knock Off, and threatens to burn Rillaboom with Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

Wide Guard is an excellent utility move, which not only protects its partner but, along with Pelipper's typing, also allows it to counter many Restricted Pokemon such as Groudon, Koraidon, both Calyrex formes, and Kyogre. Weather Ball and Hurricane's high Base Power make up for Pelipper's middling Special Attack, nuking most targets weak to its STAB moves, such as both Urshifu formes and Incineroar. Protect is generally preferred for utility and to block Fake Out, but Helping Hand can be used to support its teammates, thanks to moving before Fake Out. Focus Sash is needed to guarantee Pelipper can remain a threat even when facing one of the many Pokemon that can hit it for super effective damage. Tera Ghost is a generally strong Tera type and allows Pelipper to dodge Fake Out, which is especially important because it threatens to break Focus Sash. Tera Stellar is also viable to boost Pelipper's damage.</p> <p>Any Pokemon that benefits from rain or Wide Guard appreciates Pelipper's support. Calyrex-I, Zacian-C, and Urshifu-R all value Pelipper's support, with Wide Guard blocking super effective Astral Barrages and Precipice Blades and rain boosting Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes. Other support Pokemon like Amoonguss and Incineroar are also strong with Pelipper defensively, with it handling threats such as Urshifu-R and Landorus for Incineroar and Wide Guard blocking Bleakwind Storms from hitting Amoonguss. Its low Speed tier means it's essentially useless against Pokemon that can exploit its Speed and bring it down to its Focus Sash, leaving Pelipper unable to do anything without the threat of being knocked out. Opposing weather also completely cripples Pelipper, as its moves rely on rain to be consistent; however, its lower Speed compared to most weather setters means this scenario is playable, with rain more commonly lasting its five turns.

Heat Crash benefits from Groudon's high weight, enabling it to inflict greater damage on threats like Amoonguss and Flutter Mane. Thunder Punch punishes Pelipper and Tornadus, allowing Groudon to pressure common weather setting support Pokemon that might otherwise hinder its effectiveness. High Horsepower provides a single-target alternative to Precipice Blades, bypassing Wide Guard and providing greater reliability. Stomping Tantrum doubles in power if Groudon's previous move fails, making it useful in situations where it gets flinched by Fake Out or if it misses an attack like Precipice Blades, allowing it to hit back harder the next turn.

Tornadus often carries Rain Dance to disrupt Groudon's weather control. Incineroar is another major obstacle due to the combined effect of Intimidate, Knock Off removing its Assault Vest, and Fake Out preventing Groudon from attacking. To mitigate these weaknesses, Groudon benefits from strong team support from the likes of Volcarona and Gouging Fire, which make excellent partners, with Volcarona providing Tailwind to boost Groudon's Speed and Rage Powder to protect it from attacks. Gouging Fire benefits from sun with Protosynthesis, hitting hard with Flare Blitz while supporting the team with Howl and Breaking Swipe. Flutter Mane and Raging Bolt appreciate the Protosynthesis activation from sun, which helps Flutter Mane against Calyrex-S, while Raging Bolt pressures Kyogre, Pelipper, and Tornadus, which are common threats to Groudon. Chien-Pao is a strong partner that can increase the damage of physical attacks while using its high Speed and access to Sucker Punch to check faster threats.

        "description": "<p>Whimsicott is a potent Tailwind setter in the Regulation G metagame thanks to Prankster in conjunction with its good supporting movepool, and its typing lets it take on staples such as Raging Bolt and both Urshifu formes. Moonblast lets Whimsicott consistently damage bulky Pokemon such as the aforementioned Raging Bolt while also chipping down Rillaboom and Incineroar. It also lets Whimsicott take full advantage of its good matchup against both Urshifu formes, threatening Urshifu-R with a 2HKO and Urshifu-S with an OHKO once its Focus Sash is broken. Whimsicott's ability to punish passive play like Protect via Encore allows fast-paced teammates like Choice Specs Miraidon and Choice Scarf Chi-Yu to safely output huge damage. Encore also has other immensely useful applications like forcing non-Dark-type Fake Out users like Rillaboom and Iron Hands to switch out if they choose to use the move and reversing Trick Room in the face of threats such as Calyrex-I; this is crucial, as Tailwind teams inherently struggle against Trick Room, especially when they have multiple Pokemon weak to the aforementioned Calyrex-I. Light Screen helps bolster Whimsicott and its allies' bulk against threats such as Calyrex-S and Choice Specs Terapagos. Covert Cloak lets Whimsicott safely ignore Fake Out and set up Tailwind, allowing it to threaten with Encore on the following turn. The physical bulk investment allows Whimsicott to avoid an OHKO from -1 Zamazenta-C's Heavy Slam while never being 2HKOed by +1 Body Press. The special bulk investment enables Whimsicott to never be OHKOed by Choice Specs Tera Stellar Terapagos-S's Tera Starstorm and Mystic Water Kyogre's Water Spout in rain even at full power. Maximum Speed is run in order to let Whimsicott have the best chance to force opposing Whimsicott to repeatedly use Tailwind with Encore, which is an interaction that can also be put to use against the slower Tornadus. Tera Fire rids Whimsicott of its weakness to Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash and Incineroar's Flare Blitz among other powerful moves like Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance and Koraidon's sun-boosted Flare Blitz, crucially never getting 2HKOed by Glacial Lance. Alternatively, Tera Water lets it retain its initial resistance to Kyogre's Water Spout and Origin Pulse in addition to the resistances provided by Tera Fire in exchange for sacrificing the positive defensive matchup against Rillaboom and Raging Bolt. Tera Water also provides Whimsicott with a better matchup against Calyrex-I and Pelipper.</p> <p>Whimsicott, being rather frail, is vulnerable to many relevant Pokemon, most notably Tornadus, as not only does it compete with Whimsicott as a Prankster Tailwind user on nearly every team apart from Miraidon hyper offense, but it also threatens an OHKO with Bleakwind Storm because Whimsicott lacks a Focus Sash. Thus, Miraidon makes for a good partner, as it can easily OHKO Tornadus. Whimsicott supports Choice Specs Miraidon exceptionally well, letting it dish out massive amounts of damage with Tera Electric uncontested under Tailwind. Encore punishes opposing Fake Out users, allowing Choice Specs Miraidon to stay on the field more safely. Whimsicott also helps Chi-Yu do great amounts of damage onto foes thanks to Tailwind and checks Raging Bolt for both it and Miraidon thanks to Beads of Ruin; this is of great value, as Miraidon is otherwise forced to lock into Draco Meteor. Whimsicott is susceptible to being removed by faster Pokemon like Calyrex-I under Trick Room and Chien-Pao, so you should be wise with managing its health and speed control. Iron Hands allows this to happen quite well, not only taking advantage of Trick Room with its low Speed but also heavily threatening Chien-Pao. Its good bulk, access to Fake Out, and healing from Drain Punch allow it to keep Whimsicott safe for multiple turns.</p>"

Moonblast provides a reliable STAB move that lets Whimsicott deal solid damage to common Fairy-weak Pokemon like Miraidon, Koraidon, Chien-Pao, and the Urshifu formes. Encore is Whimsicott's most infamous support option, letting it punish setup sweepers like Calm Mind Terapagos, IronPress Zamazenta-C, and Nasty Plot Calyrex-S for attempting to boost in front of it; the move also punishes foes from trying to stall out Tailwind turns with Protect, and it discourages Rillaboom from using Fake Out lest it be locked into it. Additionally, it forces Trick Room setters like Calyrex-I to untwist the dimensions. Taunt is a similarly useful disruption tool that can be used with or in place of Encore, notably allowing Whimsicott to deny Tailwind from other setters like Tornadus and Lunala unless they use Tera Dark. Protect helps Whimsicott keep itself on the field and stay in a position to use its other moves repeatedly, especially in the face of Fake Out users, but the last moveslot can also be spent on more aggressive options like Helping Hand, which is useful with any attacker, or Fake Tears, which is especially devastating alongside strong special threats like Chi-Yu. Whimsicott enjoys holding a Focus Sash to make up for its poor bulk, and Tera Ghost is useful to prevent the item from being wasted by Fake Out.</p> <p>Whimsicott's reliable Tailwind support is a blessing to almost every Restricted Pokemon, especially those with middling Speed tiers such as Groudon and Terapagos, as well as Pokemon that want to be faster against opposing Tailwind teams such as Miraidon and Calyrex-S. All four of those Pokemon also benefit from Encore, which can create space for them to set up with Swords Dance, Nasty Plot, and Calm Mind. Clear Amulet Koraidon is another notable partner that reliably discourages opponents from bringing Incineroar, which is easily the worst Pokemon for Whimsicott to face in a battle. Other strong attackers that benefit from Tailwind support are also great with it; Landorus and Urshifu-S both fall into this category, and Chi-Yu is a standout example because it augments Whimsicott's modest damage output with Beads of Ruin. Other setup Pokemon that enjoy Encore are especially useful to justify using Whimsicott on a team over Tornadus, including Calm Mind Raging Bolt, Swords Dance Ogerpon-H, and Nasty Plot Gholdengo. It's important to make sure Whimsicott has teammates that can deal with problematic Dark-types like Chi-Yu, Ting-Lu, and Kingambit due to their Prankster immunity, and a Fighting-type like Urshifu-R or Iron Hands can help with that significantly.</p>"

Helping Hand is the preferred last move on Whimsicott for most teams because it provides a damage boost to any of Whimsicott's partners. Sunny Day is used on certain hyper offense teams to boost Hisuian Typhlosion's Eruption and provide weather control against Pelipper. Protect is almost always used on Focus Sash sets to block Fake Out without the need to Terastallize into a Ghost-type. Beat Up is specifically used with Annihilape to boost its Rage Fist; this, in conjunction with Tailwind, makes it into a threat as quickly as possible.</li> <li>Covert Cloak is generally preferred on Whimsicott to block the effects of Fake Out, allowing Whimsicott to get Tailwind off without having to run Protect. However, Focus Sash is sometimes used on teams that want Whimsicott's support on the field for longer. Focus Sash also allows Whimsicott to set Tailwind in front of Talonflame, which would otherwise KO Whimsicott before it can set Tailwind with Brave Bird in conjunction with Gale Wings.</li> <li>Tera Water can be used to give Covert Cloak Whimsicott an extra turn on the field against common Pokemon such as Incineroar, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Gholdengo, though it must watch out for Rillaboom's now supereffective priority Grassy Glide. Tera Ghost gives Whimsicott an immunity to common priority moves, namely Fake Out and Extreme Speed and is usually seen on Focus Sash sets, as they are susceptible to Fake Out. Tera Fire offers similar defensive benefits to Tera Water while still resisting Rillaboom's Grassy Glide after Terastallization. However, Tera Fire makes Whimsicott weak to common moves such a as Primarina's Liquid Voice Hyper Voice and Pelipper's Weather Ball under rain.

Raging Bolt can pick off Pokemon with Thunderclap and shut down special attackers with Snarl significantly easier thanks to Gothitelle's trapping.

Hydreigon also enjoys having Tailwind and redirection support; Tailwind lets Hydreigon outspeed key threats like Dragapult, and redirection moves keep away threats like a Moonblast from Primarina. Choice Specs sets work even better with hyper-offensive playstyles due to the immense damage it can output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hydreigon appreciates Clefable, as it can support Hydreigon with Follow Me, absorbing dangerous Fairy-, Fighting-, and Dragon-type attacks like Moonblast, Outrage, and Close Combat. Hydreigon works well with powerful Ground-type attackers such as Garchomp and Ursaluna that can hit the Pokemon that Hydreigon cannot such as Archaludon with Earthquake, which Hydreigon is unaffected by. It also enjoys the presence of Gholdengo, which can switch in against status moves or Fake Out and threaten Fairy-types. Tailwind support from Talonflame or Whimsicott is also favored by Hydreigon for boosting Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hydreigon's main weakness is its inability to outspeed faster Dragon-types without Tailwind and its dangerous 4x weakness to Fairy. It also has a hard time hitting special walls like Tyranitar and Primarina. To mitigate this, it's important to have strong physical attackers on the team like Garchomp and Annihilape that can quickly empty the opposing team of special walls; to deal with faster Dragon-types, a Tailwind setter like Murkrow is necessary, and a Steel-type like Gholdengo will quickly rid the opposing team of Fairy-types.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Hydreigon fulfills its main role on teams as a damage dealer through its great stats and typing. It absolutely shines the most during the early-game, when it can spread heavy damage, then switch out and clean up other pieces late-game.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hydreigon is best used when the opposing team no longer has any healthy special walls so that it can use its respectable Special Attack to pick off everything else.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hydreigon has its biggest problems against Pokémon that hard check and threaten it, such as Primarina and Archaludon.

        "description": "<p>Quiver Dance Volcarona is a very interesting Pokemon in Regulation G because of its amazing setup potential, good bulk, and respectable damage after Quiver Dance. Volcarona does well against Zamazenta-C and Calyrex-I, since it can 2HKO both of them with Flamethrower. The Special Defense investment allows Volcarona to almost always survive a Life Orb Blood Moon from Ursaluna-B and three non-Terastallized Choice Specs Moonblasts from Flutter Mane. The Speed investment allows it to outspeed Pokemon with base 135 Speed after a Quiver Dance, and a Timid nature lets Volcarona outspeed Calyrex-S after one Quiver Dance as well. 92 Defense EVs allow it to survive 2 Icicle Crashes from Chien-Pao and two Behemoth Blades from Zacian-C after Leftovers recovery. Flame Body is a great ability, as being able to burn an opposing Pokemon is very valuable in case you are facing down Pokemon such as Urshifu-R and Zamazenta-C. Volcarona loves to run Tera Dragon to give it helpful resistances to Water- and Electric-type moves such as Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R and Electro Drift from Miraidon.</p> <p>Volcarona can, however, have some tough matchups. Kyogre specifically is a horrible matchup for it, as Water Spout is a guaranteed OHKO against a Volcarona that is not Terastallized. Both Kyogre and Pelipper can dampen Volcarona's damage output as well, forcing it to rely on Bug Buzz, which does not threaten Kyogre or Pelipper in the slightest. Koraidon and the Ogerpon formes can all do massive damage to it as well. The aforementioned Urshifu-R is also a check to Volcarona, since it can OHKO Volcarona that is not Terastallized with Surging Strikes. Pelipper and Tornadus are also threats since they can hit Volcarona for super effective damage with their STAB moves. A lot of these bad matchups are why it is so important to run Miraidon next to Volcarona, as Miraidon can OHKO the aforementioned checks. Incineroar, Rillaboom, and Iron Hands can all help with setting up Quiver Dance with Fake Out, and Whimsicott can help set up Quiver Dance with Encore or provide speed control with Tailwind in case Quiver Dance isn’t the best option in the current game state.</p>"

      "Bulky Support": {
        "description": "<p>Volcarona can be used as an effective support Pokemon that is capable of redirecting attacks for its partners and weakening opponents. Volcarona matches up well into powerful special attackers such as Terapagos, Raging Bolt, and Ursaluna-B, as it can lower their Special Attack with Struggle Bug. Volcarona also has great matchups into physical threats such as Calyrex-I, Zacian-C, and Zamazenta-C, as it is capable of surviving their attacks and crippling them with a burn with Flame Body or Will-O-Wisp. Overheat is used to deal significant damage to Calyrex-I and Zacian-C, while Flamethrower is used for more consistent damage. Bug Buzz can be a great alternative when Volcarona is paired with Kyogre to deal consistent, unhindered damage to Grass-types threatening Kyogre such as Rillaboom, as well as allowing it to damage Incineroar, Farigiraf, and Raging Bolt sufficiently. Safety Goggles provides Volcarona with immunity to opposing Rage Powder and Spore, while Covert Cloak is used to gain immunity from Fake Out flinching, allowing it to continue supporting its teammates unhindered. Rocky Helmet synergizes with Volcarona's redirection by dealing chip damage, allowing it to break Focus Sash or KO Pokemon brought down to 1 HP with Focus Sash. This is especially effective against Urshifu-R after Volcarona Terastallizes, with Rocky Helmet and Flame Body working in tandem to deal significant damage and burn Urshifu-R, punishing Surging Strikes. The defensive investment allows Volcarona to frequently survive Flare Blitz from Koraidon and makes High Horsepower from Calyrex-I and Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C only 3HKO, while the Speed investment allows Volcarona to outrun Smeargle. Tera Water offers resistance to Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R and Water Spout from Kyogre as well as a resistance to Flare Blitz from Koraidon, while Tera Grass provides an immunity to Spore and Rage Powder while also resisting the aforementioned Water-type attacks.</p> <p>Volcarona pairs well with Terapagos, as Volcarona can burn the Fighting-types that threaten Terapagos such as Urshifu-R, Iron Hands, and Zamazenta-C and redirect attacks, allowing Terapagos to set up with Calm Mind. Volcarona struggles against Water-types like Urshifu-R and Kyogre as well as Flying-types like Tornadus and Pelipper, as it cannot damage them sufficiently and is threatened by their STAB attacks. As a result, Rillaboom is a great partner, as it can threaten these Water-types as well as provide Grassy Terrain recovery, boosting Volcarona's longevity. Volcarona also struggles against Fire-types and Pokemon that usually utilize Tera Fire such as Incineroar and Koraidon, as it can neither burn nor deal significant damage to them. Urshifu-R and Kyogre therefore pair well with Volcarona, both of which threaten Incineroar and Koraidon with their STAB Water-type attacks; Kyogre also overrides Koraidon's sun with its own rain, further hindering Koraidon. In return, Volcarona threatens checks to the aforementioned Water-types such as Rillaboom and Raging Bolt, as it can burn Rillaboom with Will-O-Wisp or through Flame Body and redirect Raging Bolt's Electric STABs with Rage Powder.</p>"

Tera Blast is used only on Tera Fairy sets, whereas Giga Drain sees play on Tera Grass and Tera Dragon sets.</li> <li>Covert Cloak lets Volcarona ignore Fake Out to set up or throw out its attacks more freely, and it prevents Snarl, Icy Wind, and Dire Claw from impeding its sweep. Leftovers gives Volcarona passive recovery, augmenting the recovery that Giga Drain provides to be at higher HP to survive more attacks.</li> <li>Tera Fairy lets Volcarona bypass Dragon-type attacks like Dragapult's Dragon Darts and Dragonite's Scale Shot and maintain a resistance to Fighting-type attacks like Sneasler's Close Combat. Tera Grass gives Volcarona a resistance to Water- and Electric-type attacks like Basculegion's Wave Crash and Archaludon's Electro Shot, makes it immune to Amoonguss's Spore, and powers up Giga Drain, turning +1 Giga Drain from a 2HKO into an OHKO on Basculegion and doing the same with +2 Giga Drain for Primarina. This additionally lets it restore more HP in the process, making it more likely to sweep games. Tera Dragon gives Volcarona similar defensive benefits and doesn't make it weak to Pelipper's Hurricane, Sneasler's Dire Claw, and Fire-type attacks like Armarouge's Armor Cannon and Incineroar's Flare Blitz, though it becomes weak to Dragon-type attacks like Dragapult's Dragon Darts and Dondozo's Order Up.</li> <li>180 Speed EVs and a Timid nature ensure that Volcarona will outspeed Annihilape, as well as other mid-speed Pokemon like Gholdengo and Archaludon. With 164 Special Attack EVs, Tera Blast Fairy will OHKO offensive Dragapult, as well as maximum HP Annihilape after a Quiver Dance. The bulk investment ensures that Volcarona survives a Tera Normal Blood Moon from Life Orb Ursaluna-B after a Quiver Dance and, after Terastallizing, two Rock Slides from Tyranitar if Leftovers or Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain are in play to neutralize sandstorm damage.</li> <li>Alternatively, Volcarona can lean into its bulk with maximum HP investment, which can benefit from the recovery offered by Giga Drain. After the aforementioned Speed investment to outspeed Annihilape, the rest of the EVs are put into Defense, letting Volcarona survive physical priority moves like Black Glasses Kingambit's Tera Dark Sucker Punch and Choice Band Dragonite's Tera Normal Extreme Speed. Even with minimal Special Defense investment, Volcarona has enough special bulk to survive Pelipper's Hurricane; after a Quiver Dance, it will take a Blood Moon from Tera Normal Life Orb Ursaluna-B or a Choice Scarf Tera Fire Overheat from Hisuian Typhlosion in sun, assuming it hasn't Terastallized into a Grass-type.</li> </ul>"

    "sets": {
      "Tailwind Support": {
        "description": "<p>Tornadus is used as a support Pokemon that can set Tailwind for its team and deal semi-consistent damage with Bleakwind Storm. It is very good into Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Rillaboom, as Tornadus can easily use Taunt or threaten them with Bleakwind Storm. Tornadus can make use of its weather-setting abilities to help itself hit Bleakwind Storms or support its teammates by boosting or reducing the damage of Water- or Fire-type moves. Icy Wind provides a secondary form of speed control for Tornadus and helps against other Tailwind-based teams. Protect can also help against Fake Out if it holds Rocky Helmet. Covert Cloak allows Tornadus to shine as a supportive piece, as it stops it from being flinched by the common Fake Out. It also prevents it from having its Special Attack lowered by Snarl. Rocky Helmet acts more as a repellent for attacks like Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes and Chien-Pao's Ice Spinner. It also can make Pokemon more wary of using Fake Out, as they will be constantly taking chip damage. The EV spread on this Tornadus allows it to take a Tera Water Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R. This can be really impactful on the Rocky Helmet set, as it forces Urshifu-R down to 50% of its health upon hitting it. It can also take an Astral Barrage from Choice Specs Calyrex-S. Tera Dark is mainly used to stop other Tornadus from using Taunt or Whimsicott from using Encore on it. It can also be used as a defensive Tera against Calyrex-S, as it resists or is immune to both of its STAB attacks. Tera Steel can be used to resist attacks from Pokemon such as Chien-Pao and the occasional Rock-type. It also removes a weakness to Electric, which can make it fare better against Raging Bolt.</p> <p>Tornadus is a good partner for many Pokemon thanks to its ability to support them through speed control and weather. One example of this is Chi-Yu, which makes use of Tornadus's ability to set sun and Tailwind to blast through opposing teams. Chi-Yu also helps Tornadus's Bleakwind Storms do more damage. Kyogre is another good partner, as Tornadus allows it to outspeed non-Tailwind teams with its below average Speed stat. Tornadus can also help to stop other weather teams from outdamaging Kyogre while letting Kyogre deal with opposing weather attackers. Tornadus benefits other Pokemon with its weather as well such as Urshifu-R, Koraidon and Archaludon. It can also provide a check to weather-setting Pokemon like Koraidon and Groudon with opposing weather. Checks to Tornadus include Miraidon and Raging Bolt. Their ability to resist its attacks and fire back with powerful Electric-type STAB moves can threaten both Tornadus and its common partners. One other check is Kingambit. Often, Tornadus cannot attack with Bleakwind Storm due to the threat of Defiant being activated. It can easily set up in front of Tornadus or, if it has Assault Vest, threaten its partner. Landorus, however, can help to beat some of these checks with strong Sandsear Storms in Rain while being immune to Miraidon's and Raging Bolt's Electric-type STAB moves. Trick Room teams are also a bad matchup, as they flip the Speed stats and make Tailwind useless. Calyrex-I is especially tough for Tornadus, as it can target it down with strong Glacial Lances or set Trick Room right in front of it.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thundurus is a good support Pokemon that is capable of disrupting teams like few other Pokemon can. Eerie Impulse can slow down powerful special attackers more effectively than other forms of damage control like Snarl or Vessel of Ruin, which means that Thundurus can completely neutralize the likes of Calyrex-S, Terapagos, Ursaluna-B, and Miraidon. Thunder Wave is a form of speed control that, unlike Tailwind, can generate free turns for Thundurus and its teammates. Taunt shuts down support Pokemon such as Amoonguss, preventing them from messing with Thundurus's team. Rain Dance allows Thundurus to both disrupt sun teams dependent on weather from Groudon or Koraidon and power up its teammate's Water-type attacks. Covert Cloak prevents Thundurus from being stopped by Fake Out from the likes of Incineroar and Rillaboom, so it does not fear them on the first turn and can use its support moves unperturbed. With 252 HP EVs, 156 Defense EVs, and a Bold nature, Thundurus will be able to take Tera Water Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R or a sun- and Orichalchum Pulse-boosted Flare Blitz from Koraidon, giving it just enough survivability to get off a final support move. 92 Special Defense EVs still give it room to survive many powerful special attacks, including Choice Specs Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage and Choice Specs Beads of Ruin Terapagos-S's Tera Starstorm. Tera Dark gives Thundurus an immunity to Prankster, letting it still get off its support options in the face of faster Prankster Tornadus and Whimsicott. It also gives it a resistance to Calyrex-S's STAB moves, letting it take a move in a pinch.</p> <p>Unlike Tornadus, Thundurus's form of speed control is both less useful and easier to stop; Thunder Wave can only affect the relative Speed of a single Pokemon on the field, whereas Tailwind will affect both Pokemon. What's more, Dark-, Ground-, and Electric-types, such as Chi-Yu, Landorus, and Miraidon, are completely immune to Thundurus's Thunder Wave, so they can threaten it and its team easily. Chien-Pao deserves a special mention, as it ignores Thunder Wave and threatens Thundurus with an OHKO. Fighting-types like Zamazenta-C and Urshifu-R are great partners for Thundurus because they deal with Dark-types very effectively. Zamazenta-C is able to boost its physical bulk with Iron Defense and benefits from Thundurus reducing the special damage from their foes, making it difficult to bring down. Urshifu-R appreciates the fact that Thundurus can summon rain to boost the power of Surging Strikes. Both appreciate Taunt, which shuts down Amoonguss. Rillaboom is a common partner to assist Thundurus in shutting down Miraidon by replacing the Terrain; it also deals with Ground- and Electric-types that irritate Thundurus by resisting their attacks and threatening them in return with its strong STAB moves and High Horsepower, respectively. Indeedee-F and Farigiraf have the ability to block Prankster support moves, so a Dark-type that scares them away is appreciated; Incineroar and Chien-Pao are common choices for such a role. Calyrex-S is also a solid partner for Thundurus, as it appreciates Thundurus's speed control and damage control, the ability to shut down sun teams with Rain Dance, and the fact that Thundurus answers Amoonguss with Taunt. Eerie Impulse is generally helpful against Terapagos-S, which can give Calyrex-S issues. Though both Calyrex-S and Thundurus dislike Dark-types, Calyrex-S can Terastallize Fairy and use Draining Kiss to improve the matchup. Thundurus's Thunderbolt also doesn't do a lot of damage, so foes can ignore it completely if it is unable to utilize its support moves.</p>"

Sludge Bomb allows Landorus to OHKO Ogerpon-H while threatening huge damage to Assault Vest Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W.

Tera Poison allows Landorus to OHKO Ogerpon-W with Sludge Bomb, while shedding weaknesses to common attacks like Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R and Ice Spinner from Chien-Pao; it also allows Landorus to deal great damage to common Tera Fairy users, like Raging Bolt and Flutter Mane. Tera Steel allows Landorus to resist Ice while also giving a neutrality against Water-type STAB moves from common Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Ogerpon-W.

Chien-Pao threatens an OHKO with Ice Spinner or Icicle Crash, Flutter Mane can nullify its Choice Scarf Speed boost with Icy Wind while doing a lot of damage, and Calyrex-I OHKOes Landorus with Glacial Lance and can set up Trick Room. Kyogre, especially with Assault Vest, can soak up hits from Landorus and threaten to OHKO it with Water-type attacks such as Origin Pulse and Water Spout. Rillaboom is a good partner for Landorus because of its positive matchup against Flutter Mane and Kyogre, with Wood Hammer OHKOing them. Kyogre helps against Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, and Calyrex-I, as it can easily take their attacks while responding with tons of damage with its STAB moves while also setting up rain for Sandsear Storm. Both Rillaboom and Kyogre appreciate Landorus being a check to Pokemon that threaten them, such as Chi-Yu and Miraidon, respectively. Raging Bolt is a great counter to Kyogre, because of its natural typing and ability to threaten it with Thunderclap and Thunderbolt. Tornadus can set up Tailwind for Landorus to further bolster its Speed, use Rain Dance to boost Sandsear Storm's accuracy, and has a spread move in Bleakwind Storm that hits Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Amoonguss that benefits from rain.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Talonflame is most common as the main supportive option on teams that aim to overwhelm the opponent and win quickly, such as hyper offense, where priority speed control in the form of Tailwind is especially valuable. Its most common partner by far is Choice Specs Gholdengo, which, when paired with Covert Cloak Talonflame, prevents Fake Out and makes it difficult to stop a turn one Tailwind + Tera Steel Make it Rain. This duo is also particularly strong with Dondozo and Commander Tatsugiri, softening up teams for Dondozo to clean up in the endgame.</li> <li>Talonflame doesn't particularly need any partners to function well; it instead serves to complement its teammates.</li> <li>Talonflame's main competition is Whimsicott, which doesn't have to worry about about losing access to priority moves thanks to Prankster, as well as having better enabling tools such as Sunny Day for Hisuian Typhlosion and Delphox and Beat Up for Annihilape. Talonflame has more general utility tools with Will-O-Wisp and non-Prankster Taunt, is faster, and can OHKO it first with priority Brave Bird, but it generally isn't as support-oriented as Whimsicott.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Talonflame's biggest strength is immediate turn one pressure. Take advantage of that. You generally always want to be leading Talonflame and setting up Tailwind; going for an attack is risky before Tailwind is up, as you lose Gale Wings and a significant chunk of Talonflame's health. Once Tailwind is up, sacrificing it for a free switch is usually the play. If you have the opportunity for a safe switch, however, take it, as Talonflame's coverage and Speed makes it a great late-game cleaner.</li> <li>The only real reason to use Talonflame over Whimsicott is coverage and damage, functioning almost like a glass cannon with access to priority Tailwind. Flying- and Fire-type coverage is excellent into the metagame, and its Speed means it's always a credible threat. Go for damage whenever possible after setting up Tailwind.</li> <li>The best way to handle Talonflame is to nullify either its damage or priority speed control. Pokemon with Intimidate severely hamper Talonflame's offensive pressure, and even Pokemon like Electabuzz and Primarina that can eat one of its attacks and return back for strong damage are difficult matchups. Alternatively, nullifying its priority or Speed advantage also works well. Priority attacks like Fake Out and Extreme Speed break Gale Wings, with the former often completely preventing Tailwind from being set up on non-Covert Cloak sets. Priority blocking abilities like both Indeedee's Psychic Surge are difficult but not common. Incineroar is likely the biggest pain spot for Talonflame teams, as it walls Gholdengo, can break Gale Wings with Fake Out, and has Intimidate to cripple Talonflame offensively. If you're playing Talonflame, you have to be careful when leading it into Incineroar and Sneasler teams, and usually, it's best to completely leave it behind in matchups against balance teams.</li> </ul>",

        "description": "<ul> <li>Talonflame takes over for Tornadus as the premier offensive Tailwind support, dealing huge damage with its primary STAB attacks that give it immediate offensive pressure as well as having a host of supportive options with Gale Wings Tailwind.</li> <li>Covert Cloak is the most popular item on Talonflame, preventing opposing Fake Outs from slowing down a offensive lead. Talonflame's high Speed means it's usually not too bothered by Gale Wings breaking. Life Orb and Sharp Beak are two sides of the same coin; they are offensive items to pick up OHKOes on foes that Covert Cloak sets don't at the cost of being vulnerable to Fake Out. Life Orb allows for cleaner OHKOes such as OHKOing Rillaboom regardless of its defensive investment as well as boosting Flare Blitz, while Sharp Beak is an option if you prefer not taking recoil at the cost of damage output, such as only having a 60% chance to OHKO the previously mentioned Rillaboom.</li> <li>The choice of Tera type is mostly dependent on personal preference. Tera Ghost prevents Fake Out, Extreme Speed, and other priority moves from breaking Gale Wings. Tera Flying is used for damage, allowing Sharp Beak and Life Orb sets to cleanly OHKO Amoonguss, as well as some frail neutral types such as Delphox and Hisuian Typhlosion, with Brave Bird. Tera Grass gives a resistance to Water, Electric, and an important immunity to powder attacks; this is used to bypass opposing Rage Powders and Taunt an opposing Trick Room user on turn one.</li> <li>Jolly is usually preferred for outspeeding Adamant Dragapult, Whimsicott, and Sneasler, but Adamant is also viable to maximize damage, allowing it to OHKO Amoonguss without Terastallization on Life Orb sets.</li> <li>The last two moveslots are open to player preference and usually mix and matched, the usual 2 are Flare Blitz and Taunt, giving it an additional STAB move and extra utility, respectively, but Will-O-Wisp and Protect are also viable; the former cripples physical threats like Dondozo, and the latter is generally useful.</li> </ul>"

Sleep Powder can shut down slower foes such as Annihilape and Primarina, keeping the momentum for offensive threats like Garchomp. Vivillon also works well on balance, specifically with Porygon2, redirecting or shutting down attacks for Porygon2 while also sitting next to Ursaluna as it uses Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p>Thanks to Vivillon's Flying typing, it can be used next to Garchomp and its easily spammable Earthquake amazingly. Earthquake also forces threats such as Archaludon to go for Tera Grass, which then opens up Vivillon to hit hard with Hurricane. Vivillon can also put foes to sleep for Garchomp, which sets it apart from other Flying-types. Gholdengo is another solid partner for Vivillon, benefiting from redirection.</p> </li> <li> <p>Vivillon loses to Maushold and Annihilape as a duo, as Annihilape threatens Vivillon after it Terastallizes, and Maushold can shut down Vivillon by outspeeding it and using Taunt. It can also struggle with Maushold and Archaludon as a duo, with Maushold this time threatening Population Bomb as well as Taunt while Archaludon can take down Vivillon with Electro Shot, Flash Cannon, and Draco Meteor. Garchomp and Gholdengo can patch up these holes; Garchomp's Earthquake hits hard into all of the aforementioned foes, while Gholdengo can do the same with Shadow Ball and Make It Rain. Garchomp also has the added benefit of Rough Skin, damaging Maushold for attacking.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Vivillon's main role is to put things to sleep with high Speed, hit decently hard, and redirect attacks to protect allies. Vivillon really shines when next to Garchomp, putting slower foes likes Pelipper to sleep and redirecting attacks such as Moonblast from Primarina and Draco Meteor from Hydreigon.</p> </li> <li> <p>Vivillon can be used best in early-game situations and works really well in the lead or even in the back next to Gholdengo, spamming Sleep Powder while Gholdengo uses Make It Rain or using Rage Powder to allow Gholdengo to set up and sweep. Vivillon can also be used next to Primarina, with Hyper Voice and Sleep Powder forcing Tera Grass from foes such as Incineroar, which can then allow Vivillon to hit hard with Hurricane.</p> </li> <li> <p>Vivillon can struggle with Pokemon like Incineroar chipping it down and breaking Focus Sash, and smart pivoting into Grass-types or Safety Goggles Pokemon can make it hard for Vivillon to do its job. For this, Incineroar can work to remove Safety Goggles with Knock Off and KO Grass-types with Flare Blitz.

Incineroar makes up for Sylveons middling physical bulk with Parting Shot and Intimidate, as well as handling the Steel- and Fire-types that Sylveon struggles against. Ogerpon-W not only provides Follow Me support but similarly to Incineroar is able to handle Steel- and Fire-type attacks safely. Landorus is a great offensive partner, with it and Sylveon covering each other's checks, as well as making up for Sylveon's low initial damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sylveon's biggest issue is that it struggles to find a slot on most teams due to its competition with Flutter Mane, which is more of an immediate threat thanks to its higher single target damage, higher Speed, and Fake Out immunity from its Ghost typing. While Sylveon has use cases thanks to its bulk and pure Fairy typing, Flutter Mane is easier to fit into most compositions and is able to function well with minimal support.

        "description": "<p>Incineroar is the premier non-Restricted Pokemon in the Regulation G metagame thanks to Intimidate and its ability to check centralizing threats such as Calyrex-S for its team. Its access to Fake Out and Parting Shot combined with its great natural bulk make for a strong combination, demanding respect from foes lest they be forced to switch out, leaving themselves vulnerable to Incineroar's allies, or stay on the field outputting negligible damage. Incineroar is naturally blessed with a typing that lets it take on both Restricted Pokemon, such as Lunala and Calyrex-S, and strong non-Restricted Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Rillaboom, and Chi-Yu. Will-O-Wisp ruins IronPress Zamazenta-C and Clear Amulet Calyrex-I; this is of great value, as they normally are not hindered by Intimidate, since the former relies on its Defense stat to deal damage and the latter almost always runs Clear Amulet. Alternatively, Flare Blitz provides high damage output against Rillaboom and Amoonguss and OHKOes Chien-Pao. Taunt can also be utilized on specific teams, such as those with Calyrex-I, to shut down Amoonguss. Knock Off is crucial to OHKO Calyrex-S while removing items such as Safety Goggles from opposing Incineroar to aid its own partner Amoonguss. Holding Safety Goggles itself allows Incineroar to have a better matchup against Amoonguss, letting it ignore Spore and Rage Powder, but Sitrus Berry can viably be run to provide crucial longevity to Incineroar in this powerful metagame. The given EV spread allows Incineroar to always survive a Jolly Close Combat from Mienshao. As an added bonus, it also takes a +1 Defense Body Press from Zamazenta-C, allowing it to use Will-O-Wisp or get better positioning against Zamazenta-C's allies. The special bulk EVs allow Incineroar to avoid a 2HKO from +1 Life Orb Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage, letting it retaliate with Knock Off. 27 Speed IVs are run in order to get a slower Parting Shot than opposing Incineroar, allowing the user's Incineroar's Parting Shot to go off onto a freshly switched-in opposing Pokemon for greater value. Tera Ghost allows Incineroar to ignore Fake Out from opposing Incineroar or Rillaboom, Close Combat from Mienshao and either Urshifu forme, and Body Press from Zamazenta-C. Tera Grass lets Incineroar resist Water Spout from Kyogre while being immune to Amoonguss's Spore and Rage Powder, essentially functioning as a built-in Safety Goggles. Alternatively, Tera Water can be used to keep the resistance to Water Spout and resist Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance in exchange for a neutral matchup against opposing Incineroar and being unable to ignore Amoonguss.</p> <p>Incineroar pairs well with virtually every Restricted Pokemon, providing Fake Out support in conjunction with solid bulk and damage reduction. As useful as Incineroar is, it is severely threatened by Pokemon such as Koraidon and Kyogre, the former of which is immune to Intimidate thanks to Clear Amulet and can easily OHKO Incineroar with Collision Course. The latter is Incineroar's worst matchup, as it easily gets OHKOed by Water Spout and even Origin Pulse if rain is on the field. Miraidon is also a huge nuisance when used with Choice Specs, as it can either potentially OHKO Incineroar with Electro Drift or pivot around it with Volt Switch, chipping it or its allies down. The susceptibility to Koraidon can be mitigated by having Flutter Mane or Tera Fairy Raging Bolt as a partner, as both take advantage of Koraidon's sun via Protosynthesis and force it to Terastallize. Incineroar should also be carefully preserved against Calyrex-I because it commonly runs Clear Amulet and High Horsepower, which can 2HKO Incineroar. Incineroar also struggles against a top non-Restricted Pokemon in Urshifu-R, so allies such as Rillaboom and/or Amoonguss are appreciated to keep it and other threats like Kyogre and Miraidon in check.</p>"

U-turn allows Incineroar to switch out and get more use out of Intimidate and Fake Out. Assault Vest lets Incineroar survive attacks such as Ursaluna-B's Tera Normal Blood Moon and Pelipper's Weather Ball at the cost of not being able to use common moves like Parting Shot, Will-O-Wisp, and Taunt. The defensive EVs allow Incineroar to take Choice Specs Miraidon's Electro Drift, Landorus's Earth Power, and Mienshao's Close Combat as well as Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance after Incineroar Terastallizes. Tera Grass lets Incineroar resist moves such as the former two's STAB attacks as well as Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes, which lets Incineroar remove their items with Knock Off or bring in teammate with U-turn while making Incineroar immune to Amoonguss's Spore and Rage Powder.</p> <p>Incineroar struggles against Pokemon that can threaten it with super effective damage and ignore Intimidate such as Urshifu-R, Koraidon, Landorus, and Pelipper, with the latter three still hitting it super effectively after it Terastallizes.

Incineroar pairs well with Pokemon like Miraidon that benefit from being able to pivot and can make sure that Electric Terrain is active. Incineroar also uses Flare Blitz to threaten Grass-types like Rillaboom and Amoonguss that resist Miraidon's STAB Electric-type moves. Lunala is another strong partner for Incineroar, as Fake Out can help Lunala set up Trick Room while Incineroar can help strong Trick Room sweepers such as Ursaluna switch in safely.

When facing opposing Sneasler or setup sweepers like Gholdengo or Volcarona, it's crucial to position Primarina correctly—either by placing it next to a redirector, so it can attack freely, or by utilizing other Pokemon to apply more immediate pressure.

Lunala uses Moonblast to hit Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Urshifu-S that resist Moongeist Beam. Calm Mind gives Lunala more bulk to survive against special attackers like Calyrex-S and Miraidon and boosts its damage output, making it a threat. Leftovers provides recovery for Lunala to help it regain Shadow Shield. The defensive investment allows Lunala to live Dark Pulse from Chi-Yu, Shadow Ball from Choice Specs Flutter Mane, and Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S. The offensive investment allows Lunala to OHKO Calyrex-I after a Calm Mind, OHKO Gholdengo, and nearly OHKO bulky Flutter Mane, all with Moongeist Beam.

Pelipper's access to Wide Guard protects Lunala from Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage and Chi-Yu's Snarl. Rillaboom is another great option for Lunala thanks to Grassy Terrain, which offers recovery and a way to override Miraidon's Electric Terrain, and Fake Out, allowing Lunala to set up with Calm Mind. Urshifu-R provides offensive pressure on a lot of Lunala's threats like Chi-Yu, Incineroar, Chien-Pao, Calyrex-S, Terapagos, and Ursaluna-B and synergizes well with Pelipper thanks to rain boosting Surging Strikes and Rillaboom because it handles Fire-types that threaten Rillaboom. Incineroar can use Taunt to shut down Amoonguss, has Intimidate to weaken physical threats such as Zacian-C and Chien-Pao, and has access to Fake Out, making it a great partner for Lunala to set up next to.

Lunala's access to Wide Guard paired with its Ghost typing gives it a favorable matchup into popular restricted Pokemon like Calyrex-I and Zamazenta-C by blocking their strong STAB moves in Body Press and Glacial Lance, respectively. Trick Room allows Lunala to set the pace of the match to its favor, with Moonblast being a solid alternative to cover for Dark-types when speed control isn't necessary. The EV spread allows Lunala to take Wicked Blow and Life Orb-boosted Astral Barrage from Urshifu-S and Calyrex-S with Shadow Shield active.

Calyrex-S also forces Lunala to either use Wide Guard or Terastallize to avoid major damage. Urshifu-R is a phenomenal partner for Lunala, as it's able to cover Lunala's weaknesses and OHKO threatening Pokemon like Incineroar, Terapagos, and Calyrex-S; it is also protected by Lunala's Wide Guard from strong spread moves like Bleakwind Storm and Astral Barrage. Incineroar also forms a solid defensive backbone when paired with Urshifu-R as well as generating opportunities for Lunala to set up Trick Room with Fake Out. Amoonguss provides redirection support as well as Pollen Puff healing to keep Lunala at full HP for Shadow Shield; it also synergizes extremely well with Lunala's other common partners like Urshifu-R and Incineroar. Tailwind + Trick Room teams that run Lunala also benefit from strong Tailwind setters like Tornadus and Whimsicott, giving Lunala the flexibility to go for a fast game mode in specific matchups.</p>"

Grassy Glide is used, since it allows Rillaboom to threaten Pokemon that are faster than it like Urshifu-R. High Horsepower is used to threaten super effective damage on Pokemon like Raging Bolt, Miraidon, and Incineroar. U-turn allows Rillaboom to switch in and out of the battle, helping it reset Grassy Terrain consistently. Protect can be utilized on Miracle Seed variants to block Fake Out as well as stall Trick Room.

Ursaluna complements Hatterene as a fellow Trick Room sweeper where its STAB Ground-type attacks such as Earthquake and Headlong Rush can cover for Hatterene’s weaknesses while Hatterene can switch into and threaten the Fighting-types that threaten Ursaluna. Torkoal is another partner that provides offensive support with its Fire-type STAB moves against Steel- and Grass-types such as Rillaboom, which can override Psychic Terrain but is highly threatened by Eruption, deterring switch-ins. Another partner is Gallade, as it provides Wide Guard support, which is valuable against Eruption and Make It Rain from Hisuian Typhlosion and Gholdengo, respectively.

Ways to mitigate Rillaboom could be to add Torkoal, which can threaten Rillaboom with Eruption.

Safety Goggles allows it to bypass Amoonguss's Rage Powder and redirect away Spore for the benefit of its teammates, while Rocky Helmet lets it damage physical attackers whose contact moves it can redirect; Rocky Helmet can even break a Focus Sash from an Urshifu or Chien-Pao and severely punish Urshifu-R for using Surging Strikes. Tera Fairy allows Indeedee-F to resist the Dark-type attacks that would otherwise threaten it such as Incineroar's Knock Off and Urshifu's Wicked Blow while powering up Fairy-type moves that it may carry. Alternatively, Tera Grass lets it bypass Amoonguss's disruption and become immune to its Spore without having to use Safety Goggles while also granting a resistance to Water- and Electric-type attacks from the likes of Urshifu-R and Miraidon.</p> <p>With Indeedee-F's utility, it can fit on a variety of teams that appreciate Psychic Terrain, redirection, or its ability to set Trick Room. Calyrex-S appreciates Psychic Terrain blocking priority moves, namely Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch, and powering up its Psychic-type attacks; it is even able to run the devastating Expanding Force with Indeedee-F. Calyrex-S also takes advantage of Indeedee-F's redirection to fire off more of its brutal attacks without fear of retaliation and also benefits from Helping Hand pushing its damage potential up to eleven. Calyrex-I pairs well with Indeedee-F, as it is both a Trick Room setter and a sweeper, meaning that the opponent is hard-pressed to stop either Pokemon from setting up Trick Room with Indeedee-F's support, and once it is set up, Indeedee-F immediately enables Calyrex-I to deal big damage with Helping Hand. Other Trick Room sweepers like Ursaluna, Ursaluna-B, and Torkoal appreciate that Indeedee-F can support them with Helping Hand and Follow Me on top of its ability to set up Trick Room. Indeedee-F is very vulnerable to Dark-types like Urshifu, Chi-Yu, and Incineroar, as the threat of their powerful moves makes it more hesitant to use Follow Me. It also hates Taunt, which completely shuts down all of its utility and thus its field presence. Rillaboom can also interfere with strategies predicated on Psychic Terrain blocking Fake Out.</p>"

  "Dragapult": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Dragapult is a common attacker on balance teams with bulky redirectors, such as Electabuzz, Magmar, and Clefable. Redirectors are vital, since they assist in keeping Dragapult around for longer, which is especially important because Dragapult is frail and is weak to Sucker Punch from threats such as Kingambit. Additionally, Dragapult appreciates Fake Out support from the likes of Rillaboom, as it gives free turns for Dragapult to get extra attacks off, and it works nicely with Phantom Force, preventing a foe from attacking Dragapult after it lands the attack.</li> <li>Dragapult appreciates partners that can cover its weaknesses offensively or that can reliably switch into its checks; some examples are Sneasler and Primarina. Sneasler is a fast attacker that can outspeed and threaten Dark- and Fairy-types such as Incineroar, Kingambit, and Primarina. Primarina is a slower, bulkier attacker that can switch into attacks easier while still having the ability to OHKO threats such as Incineroar.</li> <li>Dark-types such as Kingambit and Incineroar are the biggest checks to Dragapult, as they can easily shrug off its attacks and threaten it with an OHKO. The aforementioned partners can help against these threats by threatening them and redirecting attacks, buying more time for Dragapult to switch out safely or overwhelm them with strong Dragon-type attacks. Tailwind teams can also be a big problem to Dragapult, as it relies on being faster than its foes and getting lots of damage off before they can move. Partners such as Rillaboom and Kingambit can help against Tailwind teams, since they can attack foes with strong priority moves, stall turns with smart pivoting, and, in Rillaboom's case, use Fake Out.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Dragapult is a sweeper, and it requires a lot of smart positioning to use it to its maximum potential. Dragapult shines in positions where its partners can support it either offensively by threatening its checks or defensively by aiding in its longevity. U-turn is a great tool in this regard, as it allows Dragapult to escape from tricky positions while doing chip damage to a foe.</li> <li>Dragapult utilizes Terastallization to get major damage on enemy Pokemon throughout the course of the game. Dragapult can be utilized early-game to get off powerful Tera Dragon Dragon Darts or Tera Blast Ghost, or it can be utilized late-game to clean the enemy team with Dragon Darts and Phantom Force.</li> <li>Dragapult's biggest weakness is Pokemon that resist its STAB attacks, such as Kingambit, Alolan Ninetales, and Incineroar. Dragapult utilizes its partners to help against these threats until they are weakened to a point where Dragapult can finish them off. Priority attacks such as Sucker Punch from Kingambit and forms of speed control, such as Tailwind and Trick Room, are threatening to Dragapult, as it is frail and relies on its high damage output and outspeeding foes. Against priority attacks, Dragapult pivots partners in or utilizes an ally with redirection to take the attacks for it. Against Tailwind and Trick Room teams, Dragapult again uses smart pivots and defensive tools such as Follow Me and Fake Out to stall out turns of Trick Room, allowing it to clean up late-game.</li> </ul>",

        "description": "<ul> <li>Dragapult uses its powerful STAB attacks, phenomenal Speed, and solid Attack stat to outrun almost every Pokemon in the game and deal massive damage to the opposing team.</li> <li>Dragon Darts is great at consistently chipping down the opposing team. Phantom Force is Dragapult's strongest Ghost-type STAB move that can also shatter Protect, but it allows foes to switch due to its charging turn. Tera Dragon sets prefer Outrage to nuke foes, albeit inconsistently. On the other hand, Tera Blast Ghost is a reliable one-turn Ghost-type STAB move. U-turn allows Dragapult to get chip damage on foes and pivot out of tricky matchups while dealing respectable damage to threats such as Rillaboom.</li> <li>Choice Band boosts Dragapult's Attack stat to great levels, which pairs excellently with its high Speed.</li> <li>Tera Dragon allows Dragapult to OHKO Garchomp and Hydreigon with one hit from Dragon Darts and Incineroar, Electabuzz, and Magmar with Outrage. Additionally, Tera Dragon removes Dragapult's weakness to Sucker Punch from Kingambit. Tera Ghost is used, since it gives Dragapult a consistent physical Ghost-type attack in Tera Blast Ghost while also allowing it to OHKO Volcarona and Primarina with Phantom Force.</li> <li>An Adamant nature allows Dragapult to always OHKO Volcarona with Outrage and almost always OHKO a Terastallized Hisuian Typhlosion with Phantom Force. A Jolly nature allows Dragapult to outspeed Jolly Talonflame, Adamant Choice Scarf Basculegion-M, and opposing Adamant Dragapult.</li> </ul>"

Play Rough threatens Koraidon and common Steel-resistant foes like Raging Bolt, Iron Hands, and Urshifu-R. Swords Dance allows Zacian-C to boost past Incineroar's Intimidate and remain a strong threat on the field. Sacred Sword can be used over either of these to threaten a 2HKO on Pokemon Zacian-C may otherwise struggle to break through, such as Incineroar and Zamazenta-C. Tera Blast can be used in conjunction with Tera Ground to also threaten Incineroar and Zamazenta-C, as well as Tera Electric Miraidon, Tera Fire Koraidon, and Gholdengo. However, Tera Blast can't break through IronPress Zamazenta-C and requires Zacian-C to commit to Terastallizaion. The defensive EVs allow Zacian-C to survive +3 Body Press from Zamazenta-C and avoid the 2HKO from Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage, while the Attack investment provides Zacian-C with the ability to 2HKO bulky Calyrex-S with Behemoth Blade after Intimidate. The Speed EVs allow Zacian-C to outspeed 135 speed foes that have a neutral nature, such as Modest Miraidon. Zacian-C may opt for 108 Attack and 164 Speed with a Jolly nature, to outspeed Base 135s with a boosting nature, like Jolly Chien-Pao. Tera Fairy sheds Zacian-C's weaknesses to Fire- and Ground-type moves such as Chi-Yu's Heat Wave and Ursaluna-B's Earth Power and greatly boosts its damage, allowing Zacian-C to OHKO Kyogre and Terastallized Miraidon. Tera Ground grants Zacian-C incredible coverage and an immunity to Miraidon's Electric-type STAB moves. Alternatively, Tera Dragon provides Zacian-C with valuable resistances to Water-, Electric-, and Fire-type moves, allowing it to take attacks from threats like Urshifu-R, Miraidon, and Chi-Yu significantly better.</p> <p>Zacian-C especially struggles with Incineroar, which weakens it through Intimidate and can further cripple it with Will-O-Wisp or threaten it with Flare Blitz. Zacian-C also struggles to damage Fire- and Steel-types like Ogerpon-H, Tera Fire Calyrex-I, Gholdengo, and Zamazenta-C if not packing coverage. This makes Urshifu-R an excellent partner, as it can threaten all of Zacian-C's checks and appreciates how Zacian-C reliably removes Raging Bolt and Miraidon. Chien-Pao can use Sacred Sword to threaten Zamazenta-C and Incineroar, as well as help Zacian-C break through the above checks with Sword of Ruin. Tailwind from Pokemon like Tornadus and Whimsicott is greatly appreciated, allowing Zacian-C to maintain its Speed advantage against opposing speed control. Amooonguss can be troublesome, as it takes Zacian-C's attacks well and can slow it down with Spore. In the balance mirror matchup, the Calyrex formes can also be troublesome for Zacian-C, as they are faster in their respective forms of speed control and can output more damage than Zacian-C. Umbreon and Chi-Yu are excellent partners for this reason. Umbreon can utilize its Fake Out immunity to shut down Amoonguss and prevent Trick Room with Taunt while also doing huge damage to both Calyrex formes with Foul Play. Chi-Yu can threaten Amoonguss and the Calyrex formes with Heat Wave and Dark Pulse, respectively. The two also provide Snarl utility to further minimize the threat of Calyrex-S.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Zamazenta-C is a bulky offensive Pokemon that benefits from its good offensive and defensive typing and utility. It has a great balance of bulk and offensive presence with Dauntless Shield-boosted Body Press allowing it to effectively pressure key metagame threats such as Incineroar, Ogerpon-C, and Terapagos. Heavy Slam is used to OHKO Flutter Mane and Whimsicott. Wide Guard's utility enables Zamazenta-C to handle both Calyrex formes, Kyogre, and Groudon by protecting its side from Astral Barrage, Glacial Lance, Origin Pulse, and Precipice Blades, respectively. This support allows its teammates to safely attack these threats. The 164 Speed EVs allow Zamazenta-C to outspeed maximum Speed Landorus and Chi-Yu. Its bulk investment not only boosts Body Press, enabling it to almost always OHKO Incineroar and 2HKO opposing Zamazenta-C, but it also almost always ensures it survives a +1 Tera Fire Ivy Cudgel from Ogerpon-H and two Sacred Swords from Chien-Pao. On the special side, it is guaranteed to withstand a Sandsear Storm from Life Orb Landorus. Tera Dragon gives Zamazenta-C resistances to Fire- and Water-type moves, helping into threats like Chi-Yu, Urshifu-R, and Ogerpon-H. Additionally, removing its Ground and Fighting weakness helps it withstand attacks from Landorus, Groudon, Zamazenta-C, and Iron Hands.</p> <p>Zamazenta-C's more passive playstyle makes it struggle against bulky disruption Pokemon like Amoonguss, which can put it sleep with Spore or redirect its attacks with Rage Powder, and Incineroar, which often uses Tera Ghost and Will-O-Wisp to hinder its effectiveness. For the same reason, Zamazenta-C can also get outpaced offensively by hard-hitting threats like Calyrex-S, which can freely set up with Nasty Plot and sweep, and Miraidon. Landorus is another huge threat to Zamazenta-C because it threatens to OHKO it with Earth Power. Chien-Pao is Zamazenta-C's most common partner, as Sword of Ruin enhances Body Press's damage output. Additionally, Chien-Pao helps cover Zamazenta-C's weaknesses by handling threats such as Landorus, Amoonguss, Miraidon, and Calyrex-S. Speed Booster Energy Flutter Mane is another strong partner, providing speed control with Icy Wind and Thunder Wave to help Zamazenta-C outspeed Pokemon like Chien Pao and common Choice Scarf users such as Landorus and Chi-Yu. Additionally, it pressures Calyrex-S with Shadow Ball and threatens Miraidon and Urshifu with Moonblast while helping with the aforementioned Amoonguss and Incineroar problem with Taunt. Rillaboom offers valuable utility with Fake Out and helps against Miraidon by changing the Terrain, weakening Miraidon's attacks. Amoonguss also synergizes well with Zamazenta-C, as it slows the pace of the game with Spore, while Zamazenta-C can protect it from Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance, which can be crucial in that matchup. Lastly, Choice Scarf Chi-Yu provides immediate offensive pressure, threatening both Calyrex formes, Amoonguss, and opposing Zamazenta-C. In return, Zamazenta-C helps cover some of the Pokemon that resist Chi-Yu's attacks like Incineroar and Roaring Moon.</p>"

It is a versatile pick on many compositions, as its kit does not need much support and is mainly used to enhance a team's offensive pressure with strong attacks. With Tera Dark, Urshifu-S is capable of OHKOing Pokemon such as both Calyrex formes and Flutter Mane as well as bringing most other targets down to low HP, such as Miraidon and Tornadus. Focus Sash helps Urshifu-S remedy its poor defensive typing, while Sucker Punch is able to somewhat bypass Urshifu-S's middling Speed tier.</p> <p>Urshifu-S functions well on many teams, but those with strong speed control are where Urshifu-S shines, particularly Trick Room compositions with Calyrex-I, which appreciate the immediate pressure. Trick Room lets Urshifu-S outspeed threats such as Flutter Mane and Zamazenta-C. Additionally, Unseen Fist ignoring Protect means that it is more risky for foes to attempt to stall out Trick Room turns. Urshifu-S struggles against Pokemon that resist Dark, such as opposing Incineroar and Urshifu, as they nullify Urshifu-S's main benefit in dealing big damage with Wicked Blow. While Close Combat is strong, it's less consistent because it doesnt bypass Intimidate and drops Urshifu-S's defenses. Additionally, many of these threats also outspeed and Urshifu-S for super effective damage, such as the Zamazenta-C and Urshifu-R. However, Pokemon like Amoonguss and Incineroar are able to somewhat make up for these weaknesses. Amoonguss provides redirection, resists Fairy and Fighting, and threatens foes with Spore, while Incineroar offers general utility and Fake Out, which foes can't block with Protect at risk of a attack from Urshifu-S. Tera Fairy is also a popular Tera type, used by foes like Raging Bolt and Calyrex-S, which are problematic for Urshifu-S as it cannot break through Tera Fairy users because they resist its STAB combination</p>"

It has a great matchup into Incineroar, since it ignores Intimidate with its signature move Surging Strikes, can switch into Chien-Pao and Calyrex-I, and is able to deal significant damage to Terapagos with Close Combat. Aqua Jet is almost unstoppable with Unseen Fist and can pick off Pokemon low on HP or deal damage before Urshifu-R gets KOed. Taunt gives it a much better matchup into Amoonguss, shutting it down almost completely, and it prevents Calyrex-I from setting up Trick Room. Focus Sash gives it more survivability and helps with its relatively low Special Defense. Tera Water allows Urshifu-R to deal incredibly high damage with Surging Strikes, allowing for an OHKO against common threats such as Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao through Focus Sash. Tera Stellar lets it OHKO Terapagos-S with Close Combat but loses the consistency of Tera Water, since Urshifu-R can no longer use boosted Surging Strikes repeatedly.</p> <p>Urshifu-R works incredibly well in Calyrex-S teams, since it can threaten the Normal- and Dark-types that Calyrex-S struggles with, such as Terapagos and Incineroar. In exchange, Calyrex-S can deal with Raging Bolt, which is one of the most common checks to Urshifu-R, as Raging Bolt can use Thunderclap before Urshifu-R can move to bring it down to Focus Sash while also being able to switch-in on Surging Strikes. Urshifu-R synergizes well with Rillaboom and Incineroar, since Fake Out and Unseen Fist are a deadly combination, punishing passive plays such as Protect that try to avoid the flinching turn. Their typings also have incredible synergy with each other, allowing them to switch in on many attacks that Urshifu-R is threatened by. With its great physical bulk and natural type advantage, Rillaboom is a great check to it, slowing Urshifu-R down with Fake Out or doing high damage to it with Wood Hammer or Grassy Glide. Urshifu-R also struggles with Amoonguss, which is able to completely wall it while protecting its teammates with Rage Powder or putting it to sleep with Spore. Tornadus is a good partner for Urshifu-R, helping with its average Speed stat by setting up Tailwind, heavily increasing the damage Urshifu-R does while making the Koraidon matchup easier by using Rain Dance and threatening the Grass-types which could otherwise be problematic such as Amoonguss and Rillaboom with Bleakwind Storm. Koraidon and Miraidon are some of the Restricted Pokemon that have the best matchup into Urshifu-R, as Koraidon is able to set up sun and greatly reduce its damage, while Miraidon is able to outspeed it and bring it down to Focus Sash while also pivoting out with Volt Switch.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Urshifu-R is an excellent revenge killer and cleaner against many offensive Pokemon. The Choice Scarf lets Urshifu-R outspeed the dangerous Calyrex-S, meaning that the vast majority of offensive teams get naturally outsped and destroyed by its powerful Surging Strikes or Close Combat, and with Unseen Fist, these teams cannot even attempt to outplay it with Protect. U-turn lets Urshifu-R use the threat of its powerful attacks to pivot out, letting its team maintain momentum even when the opponent tries to switch around its attacks while also letting it 2HKO Ogerpon-W. Aqua Jet lets Urshifu-R bypass opposing speed control and priority moves when revenge killing an opposing threat, whereas Coaching makes partner Calyrex-I a significantly bigger threat. Tera Water powers up its Surging Strikes, letting it destroy foes like Calyrex-S. It also lets Urshifu-R shed its weaknesses to Psychic and Fairy, letting it potentially take attacks like Flutter Mane's Dazzling Gleam and Calyrex-S's Psychic-type moves. This set maximizes both Urshifu-R's Attack and Speed to make it as fast and strong as possible, but an EV spread of 60 HP / 156 Atk / 20 Def / 20 SpD / 252 Spe with an Adamant nature can be also used to survive Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Mystic Water Kyogre's Water Spout.</p> <p>Redirectors such as Rage Powder Amoonguss and Follow Me Ogerpon-W disrupt Urshifu-R very effectively, interfering with it attacking vulnerable targets. Rillaboom's Grassy Glide bypasses Urshifu-R's great Speed and threatens it with an OHKO. Miraidon and Raging Bolt both threaten Urshifu-R with their powerful Electro Drift and Thunderclap, respectively. Koraidon, Groudon, and even Tornadus can set up sun, weakening Surging Strikes so that Urshifu-R can be played around more easily. Additionally, a good way to subvert Urshifu-R's great Speed is with opposing speed control. Users include Tailwind Tornadus, Icy Wind Flutter Mane, and Trick Room Calyrex-I or Farigiraf. Urshifu-R's best partner is Tornadus, as it can support Urshifu-R with Tailwind to counter opposing speed control, Rain Dance to boost the power of Urshifu-R's Water-type STAB moves, and Bleakwind Storm to threaten opposing Grass-types like Rillaboom that would threaten Urshifu-R. It can also use Taunt to ensure that Amoonguss cannot use Spore or Rage Powder to disrupt Urshifu-R. Pelipper provides rain with its ability and has a STAB Flying-type attack in Hurricane to threaten Grass-types, and it can use Wide Guard to protect Urshifu-R from the variety of spread moves in the format, including Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S and Water Spout from Kyogre. It also can support Urshifu-R with Helping Hand. Amoonguss can handle Electric- and Grass-types that would threaten Urshifu-R by redirecting attacks away from it with Rage Powder. Urshifu-R forms a formidable pivoting core with Rillaboom and Incineroar, with the three spamming U-turn or Parting Shot to stay ahead of the opponent's switches, reactivate Fake Out, cycle Intimidate, and let Urshifu-R choose new moves to lock into. Incineroar helps take on opposing Rillaboom and Amoonguss for Urshifu-R, while Rillaboom deals with Kyogre and opposing Urshifu-R well and slows down Miraidon. Both of them can use Fake Out to prevent one of the opposing Pokemon from attacking, letting Urshifu-R attack the other without interference. Fake Out also often forces foes to use Protect, which Urshifu-R can attack through.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Urshifu-R is an excellent offensive Pokemon that can threaten metagame staples such as Incineroar, Chien-Pao, and Terapagos thanks to its fantastic typing and STAB moves, enabled by Unseen Fist. Taunt is utilized to shut down supportive Pokemon and Trick Room setters such as Amoonguss and Farigiraf as well as prevent Pokemon like Calm Mind Terapagos and Raging Bolt from setting up. Aqua Jet is a great alternative to get around Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and pick off weakened foes, which is especially useful, as Urshifu-R ignores Protect. Urshifu-R may opt for Swords Dance to become a deadly sweeper, allowing it to OHKO Rillaboom and, after Intimidate, Terapagos-S with Close Combat. Mystic Water boosts Urshifu-R's STAB moves without drawback and allows it to OHKO Incineroar through Sitrus Berry. Safety Goggles lets Urshifu-R ignore Amoonguss's Spore and Rage Powder, which is significant, as Amoonguss resists Urshifu-R's STAB moves; this also provides opportunities for Urshifu-R to set up. The given EV spread enables Urshifu-R to almost always OHKO Chien-Pao (with Surging Strikes?), survive Rillaboom's Miracle Seed-boosted Grassy Glide and almost always survive Raging Bolt's Thunderclap, and outspeed Pelipper and -1 Modest Miraidon. Tera Poison is the best defensive Tera as it provides key resistances to Flutter Mane's Moonblast and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide, as well as resisting Fighting-type moves from Zamazenta-C and opposing Urshifu. Tera Water still sheds Urshifu-R's weaknesses to Flutter Mane's Fairy-type STAB moves, Calyrex-S's Psyshock, and Pelipper's Hurricane, and greatly boosts its damage output, allowing it to 2HKO Calyrex-I with Surging Strikes and OHKO Chi-Yu with Aqua Jet once Terastallized.</p> <p>Urshifu-R struggles against Rillaboom and Raging Bolt, which take its attacks exceptionally well and threaten it with strong priority STAB moves. Ogerpon-W is also an issue, as it can redirect Surging Strikes and is faster, allowing it to hit Urshifu-R for huge damage with Horn Leech. This makes Tornadus and Amoonguss great partners, as Tornadus can threaten the Grass-types, and Amoonguss can protect Urshifu-R from Raging Bolt with Rage Powder. Tornadus can also provide speed and weather control, making up for Urshifu-R's mediocre Speed tier and handling the otherwise problematic Koraidon, which can significantly weaken Urshifu-R with the sun it sets up. Taunt is another great tool that allows Tornadus to shut down Amoonguss for Urshifu-R. Urshifu-R can take on threats like Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu for the two in return. Alternatively, Rillaboom is an excellent pick, as it can pivot in Urshifu-R and threaten Ogerpon-W. Incineroar can pair with Urshifu-R and either Amoonguss or Rillaboom to create a fantastic pivot core, switching in on threats like Rillaboom. Rillaboom and Incineroar also bring Fake Out, which synergises with Unseen Fist.

        "description": "<p>Regidrago is an offensive threat with great damage potential thanks to the combination of Dragon's Maw and its amazing Dragon-type STAB options. Draco Meteor gives Regidrago a powerful single-target burst option, being able to do massive damage to a majority of the format. While Dragon Pulse is weaker, it deals consistent damage over time, making it better for situations where the power of Draco Meteor is not necessary. Earth Power brings solid coverage into Regidrago's moveset for opposing Steel-types at the cost of not doing great damage due to it not being STAB- or Dragon's Maw-boosted. Tera Blast pairs well with Tera Ghost to threaten Ghost-weak Pokemon such as Calyrex-S and Gholdengo. Life Orb helps increase Regidrago's damage output to insane levels, with the drawback of making Dragon Energy weaker over time; Dragon Fang, on the other hand, sacrifices higher damage output for the lack of recoil, giving Regidrago's Dragon Energy and bulk more consistency. Tera Dragon pushes Regidrago's damage even further, allowing it to pick up KOs on extremely bulky Pokemon like Calyrex-I with Draco Meteor and Helping Hand-boosted Dragon Energy, as well as Amoonguss and Incineroar with Tera Dragon Dragon Energy. Tera Ghost provides Regidrago with a Fake Out immunity, helping in its hyper-aggressive gameplan; it also has the extra benefit of removing its weaknesses.</p> <p>Regidrago's biggest weakness is Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane and Zacian-C, as well as Tera Fairy Pokemon like Calyrex-S and Raging Bolt. Faster Pokemon like Miraidon, Koraidon, and Chien-Pao are other huge threats for Regidrago because they can outspeed and OHKO it. Zacian-C is a great partner for Regidrago, utilizing its typing to threaten Fairy-types. Terapagos is another good partner Restricted Pokemon, being an alternative spread move attacker that can punish opposing Tera Fairy Pokemon that Regidrago would struggle against. Tailwind setters like Tornadus and Whimsicott cover for Regidrago's middling Speed tier and provide it with the ability to outspeed faster threats, drastically increasing its snowball potential. Indeedee-F and Farigiraf are other great partners, blocking priority moves like Fake Out and Sucker Punch with their abilities, setting up Trick Room to help against certain matchups like opposing Tailwind teams, and using Helping Hand to make Regidrago stronger. Indeedee-F is especially helpful thanks to its access to Follow Me, providing redirection support for Regidrago.</p>"

Calyrex-I can spiral out of control quickly thanks to Chilling Neigh Attack boosts, while its access to Trick Room and low Speed stat allow it to operate as both a Trick Room setter and sweeper. Calyrex-I runs High Horsepower for coverage, letting it hit Fire- and Steel-types that resist Glacial Lance, such as Incineroar and Gholdengo. Calyrex-I runs Clear Amulet for an immunity to Intimidate and Incineroar's Parting Shot. Tera Fire will give it an immunity to Will-O-Wisp and improve its match up into Gholdengo. Tera Water grants Calyrex-I a better match up into both Kyogre and Gholdengo, while Tera Grass provides an immunity to Spore and Rage Powder from Amoonguss along with a stronger match up into Kyogre. The allocated EV spread allows Calyrex-I to survive an Electro Drift from Choice Specs Miraidon, while the allocated Attack allows Calyrex-I to OHKO Rillaboom.</p> <p>Calyrex-I pairs well with Fake Out users and redirection support, which can allow it to set up Trick Room more easily, such as Incineroar and Amoonguss. Amoonguss is an especially strong partner, as the Grass-types that are immune to Spore are weak to Glacial Lance. Amoonguss can use Spore and Rage Powder against Zamazenta, which can otherwise set up Iron Defense and wall Calyrex-I, and use Spore and offer Pollen Puff recovery against Kyogre, which otherwise has a favourable damage trade against Calyrex-I. Calyrex-I also pairs well with Pelipper, as the rain reduces damage from Fire-type attacks, and it provides Wide Guard support, which can protect it against Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage and Kyogre's Water Spout. Non-Tera Grass Calyrex-I will struggle against Amoonguss, as it can underspeed it in Trick Room and use Spore, while non-Tera Fire variants will be vulnerable to Incineroar's Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Calyrex-S uses its incredible Speed and Special Attack stats to snowball games when they're paired with Nasty Plot or Calm Mind to boost its Special Attack. Calyrex-S matches up well against Calyrex-I and Zamazenta-C because of its ability to force Calyrex-I to Terastallize and wall Zamazenta-C when paired with any form of physical damage reduction. Psychic is a strong Psychic-type attack that isn't blocked by Wide Guard while threatening Amoonguss, Iron Hands, and Zamazenta-C. Psyshock is used for the matchup against Calm Mind users like Terapagos and Kyogre and Assault Vest users like Raging Bolt and Rillaboom; however, it is weaker against Zamazenta-C and Electric Seed Farigiraf. Draining Kiss is only used on Tera Fairy sets, but it allows Calyrex-S to both threaten the Dark-types that resist Astral Barrage like Roaring Moon, Chien-Pao, and Urshifu-S and recover HP while still threatening Wide Guard Zamazenta-C. Nasty Plot gives Calyrex-S a massive boost to its Special Attack, letting it OHKO or 2HKO most of the metagame, including OHKOing Iron Hands with Psyshock and 2HKOing Assault Vest Raging Bolt with Astral Barrage. Calm Mind takes longer to setup than Nasty Plot, generally requiring more careful planning and positioning, but the Special Defense gained is beneficial against the special attacking Restricted Pokemon like Terapagos and Kyogre. Life Orb boosts all of Calyrex-S's attacks, letting it OHKO Raging Bolt and Miraidon with Astral Barrage after a Nasty Plot. Covert Cloak prevents stat drops from moves like Snarl from Choice Scarf Chi-Yu, Electroweb from Regieleki and Raging Bolt, and Icy Wind from Booster Energy Flutter Mane as well as Fake Out's flinching effect from Pokemon like Incineroar and Rillaboom after Calyrex-S Terastallizes, letting it sweep unimpeded. The EVs allow Calyrex-S to survive a Draco Meteor from Protosynthesis-boosted Raging Bolt and OHKO Rillaboom and Terastallized Calyrex-I with Astral Barrage after either two Nasty Plot boosts or one Nasty Plot and a Helping Hand boost. A Tera type of Normal gives Calyrex-S an immunity to Ghost-type attacks like Shadow Ball from Flutter Mane and Astral Barrage from opposing Calyrex-S while not having many weaknesses. Tera Dark can be used to resist the aforementioned Ghost-type attacks while also resisting Dark-type attacks, improving Calyrex-S's matchup against both opposing Calyrex-S and Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu. Tera Dark does come with more substantial drawbacks though, letting Flutter Mane threaten it before and after Terastallizing. While the other two Tera types are better against the mirror matchup due to taking reduced damage from Astral Barrage, Tera Fairy gives Calyrex-S another layer of depth by boosting Draining Kiss to deal almost double the damage. This lets Calyrex-S run Calm Mind and use Draining Kiss's recovery combined with the Special Defense boosts to spread damage without having to worry about getting chipped down. An important thing to note is that the three Tera types almost form a matchup triangle; Tera Dark Calyrex-S either resists or is immune to all of the attacks that Tera Normal sets run while being able to hit them with Psychic, while a Tera Fairy variant is good against Tera Dark sets because of the pin with Astral Barrage and Draining Kiss before and after the opposing Calyrex-S Terastallizes, but it struggles against Tera Normal Calyrex-S because of the inability to spam Astral Barrage.</p> <p>Due to its lack of coverage, Calyrex-S often has to pick which Pokemon it is unable to threaten. If it opts for Astral Barrage with a Psychic-type coverage move, then it is unable to threaten Dark-types like Incineroar and either specially bulky Pokemon like Calm Mind Terapagos and Kyogre or physically bulky Pokemon such as Wide Guard Zamazenta-C. Calyrex-S can get around this with partners like Urshifu-R that can take advantage of the free turns created by Wide Guard or an opposing Pokemon setting up. Draining Kiss sets lack immediate damage, which can be annoying against Zamazenta-C because of its high bulk and Wide Guard or against hyper offensive Pokemon like Miraidon and Urshifu-R; however, partners like Ogerpon-H and Clefairy help with this by redirecting attacks and giving Calyrex-S multiple turns to set up. Dark- and Normal-types that resist or are immune to Astral Barrage like Farigiraf and Chi-Yu can be annoying for Calyrex-S to remove. The Urshifu formes help by threatening the aforementioned Pokemon while also discouraging Protect, allowing Calyrex-S to start boosting its Special Attack faster. In general, Calyrex-S pairs well with partners that let it do one of two things: set up and sweep or come in after foes have been weakened then sweep. Urshifu-R and Ogerpon-H help with spreading damage early-game and letting Calyrex-S get boosts through Grim Neigh, while Incineroar, Rillaboom, and the aforementioned redirection users give Calyrex-S free turns to boost its Special Attack through Nasty Plot or Calm Mind. Trick Room can be annoying for Calyrex-S because of its high Speed; however, a partner Clefairy with After You can flip the matchup. Spore Amoonguss and Taunt Urshifu-R can also help by preventing Trick Room from going up in the first place.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Calyrex-S aims to outspeed foes and dish out devastating damage early-game to soften them up for its partners. This set can additionally be used as a late-game cleaner. Calyrex-S has a positive matchup against Calyrex-I, which is threatened by Astral Barrage, and Calyrex-S has a favorable matchup against ability-reliant teams such as those based around Miraidon when it is paired with Galarian Weezing. Psychic is the primary Psychic-type STAB move for Calyrex-S; however, Expanding Force is preferred over Psychic when Calyrex-S is paired with Indeedee-F, granting it a strong Psychic-type STAB spread attack. Hyper Beam allows Calyrex-S to achieve crucial OHKOs against foes such as Miraidon with a Tera Normal boost. Pollen Puff allows Calyrex-S to threaten Farigiraf and Indeedee-F as well as sufficiently damaging Dark-types like Roaring Moon. Pollen Puff also allows Calyrex-S to sufficiently damage opposing Calyrex-S before and after Terastallizing. Pollen Puff can additionally heal Calyrex-S's ally in a pinch. Shadow Ball is used instead of Protect on Choice Specs sets, granting them a Ghost-type STAB attack unaffected by Wide Guard. Life Orb allows Calyrex-S to OHKO Amoonguss with Psychic; meanwhile, Choice Specs provides a greater damage increase, allowing Calyrex-S to OHKO Calyrex-I with Astral Barrage at the cost of move flexibility. Offensive Calyrex-S sets often maximize Special Attack and Speed; however, an alternative EV spread of 124 Def / 132 SpA / 252 Spe can be used to survive Surging Strikes from Tera Water Urshifu-R and threaten an OHKO in return. Tera Normal provides Calyrex-S with an immunity to Ghost-type attacks such as Astral Barrage from opposing Calyrex-S. Tera Normal additionally increases the damage of Hyper Beam, allowing Calyrex-S to OHKO Farigiraf, Groudon, and Amoonguss. Tera Dark provides Calyrex-S with resistances to opposing Calyrex-S's STAB attacks and Dark-type attacks like Knock Off from Incineroar and Roaring Moon. Tera Ghost is only used when Calyrex-S is using Choice Specs to maximize the damage of Astral Barrage, OHKOing bulk-invested Ogerpon-H and Whimsicott.</p> <p>Calyrex-S is easily threatened by foes that can move before it attacks like Choice Scarf Urshifu-R as well as priority attacks like Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao. Dark-types like Incineroar and Roaring Moon can withstand Calyrex-S's offensive pressure and OHKO it in return. Farigiraf is difficult for Calyrex-S to damage with its immunity or resistance to Calyrex-S's STAB attacks. Calyrex-S also struggles against opposing Calyrex-S because it is forced to Terastallize to ensure it is not KOed if it moves after the opposing Calyrex-S. Offensive Calyrex-S is most commonly used on teams featuring Galarian Weezing as well as the combination of Dondozo and Tatsugiri. On these teams, Calyrex-S is usually lead with Galarian Weezing in order to deal significant damage to the opposing team with Calyrex-S, while Galarian Weezing disrupts them with Neutralizing Gas, which Calyrex-S is unaffected by. Dondozo and Tatsugiri are then brought in the back and sent onto the field to clean up late-game once Calyrex-S and Galarian Weezing have removed their threats. The partners used alongside Galarian Weezing, Dondozo, and Tatsugiri vary. Ogerpon-C is a great partner for Calyrex-S, providing redirection and easily threatening Urshifu-R, Chien-Pao, and Incineroar with its STAB attacks. Indeedee-F also provides redirection as well as setting Psychic Terrain to prevent threats from priority attacks and turn Calyrex-S's Expanding Force into a powerful spread attack. Iron Hands and Urshifu-R pair exceptionally well with Calyrex-S. Iron Hands can use Fake Out to disrupt foes, allowing Calyrex-S to easily KO them, and Urshifu-R often holds Choice Scarf, allowing it to keep up with threats that outspeed Calyrex-S. Both Iron Hands and Urshifu-R threaten Dark-types with Drain Punch and Close Combat respectively, while Calyrex-S threatens Ghost-types with Astral Barrage for Iron Hands and Urshifu-R. Roaring Moon can easily threaten Farigiraf and opposing Calyrex-S with Knock Off, and it additionally provides Tailwind support.</p>"

It threatens huge damage with Guts-boosted STAB moves. Its slow Speed makes it move before most Pokemon under Trick Room while also Speed tying with minimum Speed Calyrex-I. Facade works in tandem with Flame Orb and Guts to dish out large amounts of damage. Earthquake is a powerful spread move, dealing a lot of consistent damage against both opponents. Swords Dance helps offset Attack drops by Intimidate. Holding a Flame Orb helps it activate Guts, enabling it to sweep in Trick Room while gaining immunity to Spore from Amoonguss. Tera Ghost makes Ursaluna immune to Fake Out from Pokemon like Incineroar and Rillaboom and Fighting-type moves from Koraidon, Urshifu-R, and Zamazenta-C while getting rid of its weakness to Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I.</p> <p>Ursaluna struggles against Intimidate users like Incineroar, as Intimidate reduces its Guts-boosted Attack. Because Ursaluna takes burn damage every turn, foes can utilize Protect to put it in range of attacks or KO it if it's at low HP without risking any damage. Tera Ghost Incineroar has Fake Out, Intimidate, and Parting Shot and is immune to Facade and neutral to Headlong Rush. Focus Sash Urshifu-S is also a good Ursaluna answer, surviving a hit and firing off a Close Combat or Wicked Blow if Ursaluna has Terastallized Ghost. Meanwhile, Calyrex-I can Speed tie Ursaluna and 2HKO it with Glacial Lance. Lunala functions particularly well with Ursaluna because it has access to Trick Room and Wide Guard to block Glacial Lance while also providing a means to remove Ghost-type Pokemon from the field with its STAB moves. Other good partners for Ursaluna are Farigiraf and Indeedee-F, with both being able to set up Trick Room while blocking priority moves with Armor Tail and Psychic Surge, respectively. Calyrex-I can set up Trick Room and also does damage with its Ice- and Ground-type coverage to punish switch-ins and OHKO Amoonguss and Rillaboom and 2HKO Ghost-types like Calyrex-S.

Focus Sash Sneasler pairs best with both special and physical attackers, while Terrain Seed Sneasler both requires either Rillaboom or an Indeedee forme as a partner and pairs very well with them. Sneasler threatens opposing Grass- and Steel-types that resist Rillaboom's Grass-type attacks and Dark- and Steel-types that can switch into Indeedee-M's Expanding Force.</li> <li>Kingambit and Dragapult both synergize very well with Sneasler. Dragapult enjoys Sneasler threatening Primarina, which is a common switch-in to Dragapult's attacks. Dragapult is also extremely fast, letting it and Sneasler quickly overwhelm foes. Dragapult and Kingambit both benefit from Sneasler being good against opposing Kingambit, as they struggle to hit it.</li> <li>Sneasler's main weakness is Gholdengo, since it is immune to all of Sneasler's attacks if it isn't running Throat Chop and is often paired with Incineroar, which can lower Sneasler's Attack while also switching into Throat Chop. An allied Kingambit can help with this, as it benefits from Intimidate and resists both of Gholdengo's STAB attacks while also hitting it for super effective damage.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Sneasler's main role is to use its good coverage against the metagame and good offensive stats to clear the way for other attackers. Look for situations where an opposing team has limited checks to an offensive Pokemon like Dragapult and attempt to remove these checks with Sneasler.</li> <li>Sneasler works best as an early-game attacker, as it can be lead with Pokemon with weaknesses it can cover, forcing the opponent to be weak against one or the other. Tough matchups for Sneasler can simply be resolved by not bringing it, as it shouldn't be the centerpiece of any team.</li> <li>Sneasler's main counters are bulky Pokemon and Pokemon that it lacks the coverage to hit.

Assault Vest on Glimmora is especially effective on Dondozo teams, as the extra longevity helps it spread poison better and stall out even longer, making up for the lowered damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>With Meteor Beam, Glimmora can utilize its high Special Attack stat and good offensive typing as a damage dealer. Tornadus and Ogerpon-W are good partners; Tornadus provides speed control and can launch powerful Bleakwind Storms into Fighting-types that resist Meteor Beam and Ogerpon-W redirects potential Water- or Ground-type attacks while pressuring threats like Urshifu-R and Landorus. In return, Glimmora can threaten Grass-types, which resists both Ogerpon-W's STAB moves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Glimmora's poor defensive typing, combined with its middling bulk and average Speed, makes Glimmora a glass cannon. Glimmora is weak to many prominent offensive threats such as Urshifu-R, Landorus, and Gholdengo. Glimmora also struggles to handle Rock-resistant foes such as Iron Hands, Kingambit, and Urshifu-R. Even then, many of these foes will concede Toxic Spikes while taking out Glimmora; for instance, Urshifu-R will set up both layers of Toxic Spikes if it attacks Glimmora. Amoonguss is another difficult match up, as it absords Toxic Spikes and takes Glimmora's attacks comfortably, while threatening a Spore.</p> </li> </ul>",

Coaching has the ability to boost the power of allies like Calyrex-I, while U-turn helps with positioning, chipping Rillaboom in the process.

Farigiraf is also an issue, as it is a bulky Pokemon that is immune to Shadow Claw, deals great damage to Annihilape with Psychic, and has enough HP to survive a Final Gambit. Calyrex-I is a great partner for Annihilape, as Annihilape is able to either give it a Coaching boost or remove an annoying or powerful foe to Calyrex-I like Zamazenta-C or Calyrex-S with Final Gambit or Shadow Claw, respectively.

      "Bulky Support": {
        "description": "<p>Farigiraf's main role is as a bulky support piece and Trick Room setter, and its ability to block priority is incredibly valuable in a format full of moves like Fake Out, Grassy Glide and Thunderclap. Due to its typing, it has a good matchup into Calyrex-S, and its Psychic-type STAB moves are generally good into the metagame but especially into Amoonguss and Urshifu-R. Tera Blast is often used in the second moveslot, as both before and after Terastallization, it gives Farigiraf a consistent single-target STAB move. Foul Play is used to give Farigiraf a way to hit both Calyrex formes for super effective damage, being able to 2HKO both. Electric Seed is used in tandem with Miraidon and gives Farigiraf more bulk, allowing it to stick around longer to support the team with Helping Hand and Armor Tail. Sitrus Berry allows Farigiraf to disrupt the opponent for longer than it would be able to without it. It can also help it take some double-ups to help safely get Trick Room up, such as Surging Strikes + Knock Off from Urshifu-R and Incineroar. Safety Goggles is viable if your team has a particularly bad matchup into Amoonguss and you want Farigiraf to be able to set up Trick Room without being put to sleep without Electric Terrain support from Miraidon. The HP and Special Defense EVs allow Farigiraf to tank a Choice Specs Beads of Ruin single-target Tera Starstorm from Terapagos, and the rest is put into Defense. Tera Ground is used next to Miraidon to allow it to freely use Discharge, and Tera Fairy allows it to resist the Dark- and Bug-type moves it'd otherwise be weak to like Knock Off and U-turn from Incineroar and Rillaboom, while also resisting Fighting-type attacks and gaining an immunity to Dragon-type moves, like Collision Course and Draco Meteor from Koraidon and Miraidon, respectively.</p> <p>Farigiraf really doesn't like Restricted Pokemon that can OHKO it and potentially prevent Trick Room, such as Kyogre or Tera Fire Koraidon. It also struggles against fast Taunt users, such as Speed Booster Energy Flutter Mane, due to them being able to prevent Trick Room from going up, and bulky Dark-types like Incineroar, as Farigiraf can't hit them very hard without Tera Ground. Incineroar in particular can force it to Terastallize with Knock Off. Miraidon and Farigiraf are great partners for each other, as Farigiraf stops Miraidon from being interrupted by Fake Out, which is particularly important for the Choice Specs set, and Miraidon can activate the Electric Seed to make Farigiraf even bulkier; furthermore, as previously mentioned, Farigiraf can even Tera Ground so Miraidon can freely click Discharge next to it, while the Electric Terrain makes Farigiraf immune to Amoonguss's Spore. Farigiraf itself benefits from partners that can help it set Trick Room, such as bulky Fake Out users like Incineroar and Rillaboom as well as redirectors like Amoonguss and the Ogerpon formes. Trick Room sweepers also like having Farigiraf as a partner; for example, Calyrex-I loves the boost from Helping Hand, and so does Ursaluna-B. Another great partner is Iron Hands on the aforementioned Miraidon teams, as Farigiraf enjoys having a Fake Out user as a partner, and its Helping Hand lets Iron Hands do insane levels of damage with Quark Drive.</p>"

The EV spread allows Farigiraf to survive Adamant Koraidon’s Flare Blitz and Kyogre’s Water Spout. Throat Spray powers up Farigiraf's already powerful attacks after a Hyper Voice. This allows it to then pick up KOs on foes like Koraidon. Tera Fairy is used on Farigiraf to resist powerful super effective attacks from Dark-types like Urshifu-S and Chi-Yu along with Fairy being a great neutral type in the metagame. Tera Normal sheds Farigiraf's Dark weakness and allows it to deal massive damage with Hyper Voice, 2HKOing on Pokemon like Miraidon and Clefairy.</p> <p>Farigiraf has to be careful of powerful Dark-type attacks from Chi-Yu and Incineroar. A great partner for Farigiraf is Kyogre because it appreciates Farigiraf blocking powerful Grassy Glides and Thunderclaps as well as Fake Out. Other Pokemon like Incineroar and Rillaboom are also great partners, as they offer Fake Out support, allowing Farigiraf to set up Trick Room and, through Hyper Voice, Throat Spray. Urshifu-R is another amazing partner because it can hit the annoying Steel- and Dark-types that keep Farigiraf in check while also synergizing well with the aforementioned partners. It also appreciates Farigiraf's nullification of Fake Out, Thunderclap, and Grassy Glide as well as it removing Amoonguss.</p>"

Assault Vest lets it survive attacks like Mystic Water Kyogre's Water Spout as well as getting 4HKOed by Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage most of the time.

Urshifu-R is another check for Kingambit, as it resists Kingambit's STAB attacks and can threaten it with Close Combat. Miraidon can threaten Pokemon like Mienshao and the Urshifu formes that threaten Kingambit. Miraidon also has the added benefit of blocking Spore from Amoonguss with Electric Terrain, which allows Kingambit to play more offensively. Calyrex-S is a good partner for Kingambit, as it appreciates Kingambit helping into opposing Calyrex-S and opposing Incineroar while Calyrex-S can threaten the Fighting-types that Kingambit struggles with like Mienshao. Calyrex-I can set Trick Room that Kingambit works well in while Calyrex-I threatens Amoonguss.

On top of that, Sucker Punch can cause mind games, with Kingambit potentially just using Kowtow Cleave while forcing a switch with the threat of Sucker Punch.

Encore allows Scream Tail to lock foes into passive moves such as Protect, Fake Out, and Taunt, giving its teammates opportunities to setup or attack as well as discouraging opponents from using the latter two moves to hinder setup. Disable is used similarly but can instead prevent opponents from going for attacks that would hit Scream Tail or its partners for large amounts of damage; Encore also disables moves that Pokemon are forced to use, either through Choice items or Scream Tail using Encore. Dazzling Gleam and Play Rough give Scream Tail a way to deal chip damage: Dazzling Gleam can bypass redirection from Pokemon like Amoonguss, while Play Rough can hit Pokemon such as Pelipper that use Wide Guard; both also potentially break a Focus Sash.

Flutter Mane is especially effective against Pokemon that rely on their speed, such as Choice Scarf Urshifu-R and Calyrex-S, as it can threaten to OHKO or slow them down before they move. Taunt can be used instead of Shadow Ball to shut down support Pokemon like Amoonguss and Clefairy, as well as prevent Terapagos from setting up. Flutter Mane can also opt for Thunder Wave to reduce the Speed of Clear Amulet and Covert Cloak Pokemon such as Koraidon and Calyrex-S. Icy Wind is mandatory for Flutter Mane to play as speed control, slowing down both opposing Pokemon while also breaking Focus Sash from the likes of Chien-Pao and the Urshifu formes. Booster Energy allows Flutter Mane to outspeed the entire metagame and become a stronger form of speed control. The EV spread enables Flutter Mane to survive strong physical attacks such as Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance, Adamant Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash, and almost always Adamant Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes. The Special Defense lets it take Volt Switch from Modest Choice Specs Miraidon and Blood Moon from Ursaluna-B. Meanwhile, the Speed investment lets Flutter Mane outspeed neutral nature base 135 Speed Pokemon like Miraidon and Chien-Pao. Tera Fairy is great on Flutter Mane to shed its weakness to Ghost-type attacks such as Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S and boost its damage output, allowing Flutter Mane to threaten a potential OHKO on Miraidon and ensure a 2HKO on Raging Bolt.</p> <p>Flutter Mane struggles against bulky physical attackers like Assault Vest Rillaboom and Iron Hands, which can sponge its attacks, don't mind becoming slower, and threaten an OHKO in return. Zacian-C and Zamazenta-C are major issues in a similar way, but they don't enjoy having their Speed reduced. Flutter Mane also struggles to keep up with more immediate speed control, specifically Prankster Tailwind from Tornadus and Whimsicott, that may allow slower Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Miraidon to threaten it. Flutter Mane pairs well with a variety of Pokemon, namely offensive Pokemon that can utilize its speed control. Chi-Yu exploits this especially well, threatening Zacian-C, Zamazenta-C, and Rillaboom with Heat Wave and Overheat. Chi-Yu also makes up for Flutter Mane's lack of offensive investment with Beads of Ruin and appreciates Flutter Mane's ability to threaten Dragon-types. Choice Specs Terapagos is an excellent asset for this duo, as it takes advantage of how often Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu can force Terastallization. Zamazenta-C can protect Flutter Mane from threatening spread moves such as Astral Barrage and Glacial Lance from the Calyrex formes. Terapagos and Zamazenta-C also appreciate Flutter Mane's speed control making up for their mediocre speed tiers, and its Fairy typing that threatens Koraidon.</p>"

Flutter Mane can use support moves such as Taunt over Shadow Ball to prevent opposing Pokemon like Calyrex-I or Amoonguss from setting Trick Room or using moves like Spore, respectively. When paired with Pokemon that set sun such as Koraidon or Groudon, Flutter Mane can use Protosynthesis to boost its Speed and use Icy Wind as a form of speed control, outspeeding and slowing down Pokemon such as Calyrex-S. Dazzling Gleam gives Flutter Mane a spread option that it can boost with Terastallization. Focus Sash lets Flutter Mane live a hit without needing to invest EVs in bulk.

Icy Wind provides a consistent form of speed control, taking full advantage of Iron Bundle's role as one of the fastest Pokemon in the game. Encore threatens to punish Fake Out users as well as any setup attempts from the likes of Calyrex-S and Terapagos.

Bulky Pokemon like Iron Hands don't care about Speed drops from Icy Wind, wall Iron Bundle's STAB moves, and are capable of OHKOing it, while Pokemon holding Clear Amulet or Covert Cloak like Koraidon and the Calyrex formes are unaffected by Iron Bundle's speed control. Miraidon compliments Iron Bundle exceptionally well by providing Electric Terrain to activate Quark Drive as well as threatening Koraidon and the Calyrex formes with Draco Meteor and Electro Drift, respectively. Meanwhile, Miraidon appreciates the speed control provided by Iron Bundle, allowing it to outspeed common threats such as Choice Scarf Tera Ground Chi-Yu, Zacian-C, and Calyrex-S after an Icy Wind, with Iron Bundle also punishing Fake Out, Protect, and setup attempts via Encore. Farigiraf is another great partner to block the aforementioned priority attacks, reverse opposing Trick Room, and threaten the Calyrex formes with Foul Play. Iron Hands, similar to Iron Bundle, takes advantage of Electric Terrain to bolster its offensive capabilities, but it also can use its amazing defenses to not only tank Raging Bolt's STAB moves while recovering with Drain Punch but also use its slow Speed to compete against Trick Room, which Iron Bundle struggles against.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Iron Hands functions as a bulky attacker and pivot that provides support options such as Fake Out, and its STAB moves can handle prominent metagame staples like Incineroar and Urshifu formes. Iron Hands has a solid matchup against opposing Miraidon teams, as it is one of the few Pokemon capable of surviving a Hadron Engine-boosted Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Miraidon. In addition to that, Iron Hands matches up well against Terapagos and threatens it with Drain Punch. It also helps deal with Calyrex-I Trick Room teams by providing Fake Out support and utilizing its low speed to outspeed and KO Incineroar in Trick Room as well as trade decently with Calyrex-I in Electric Terrain by utilizing its Tera. Wild Charge is used over Thunder Punch, as it OHKOes Urshifu-R and, in Electric Terrain, 2HKOes Calyrex-I. The recoil damage can be compensated through Drain Punch recovery. Close Combat can be used on more offensively oriented teams to get some quick OHKOs on the likes of Incineroar, and Terapagos in Electric Terrain. Volt Switch is used so Iron Hands can be a slow pivot, which helps as a positioning tool. Ice Punch provides a way to 2HKO Amoonguss and Raging Bolt as well as OHKO the occasional Landorus. Meanwhile, Heavy Slam functions as a way to get quick KOs against the likes of Flutter Mane and Tera Fairy Calyrex-S outside of Electric Terrain. Assault Vest boosts Iron Hands's mediocre Special Defense stat. The defensive investment helps Iron Hands survive two Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R as well as two Body Presses from Zamazenta-C. Iron Hands's Special Defense is maximized to take full advantage of Assault Vest, while the Speed investment allows Iron Hands to outspeed Regidrago under Tailwind. The Attack EVs, meanwhile, ensure Quark Drive boosts its Attack stat even after an Intimidate. Tera Grass can be used to gain immunity to Spore and Rage Powder as well as a resistance to Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes and Landorus's Earth Power, whereas Tera Water gives Iron Hands an excellent defensive typing, allowing it to resist Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R and Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I. Tera Fairy is a solid defensive typing that is neutral into most of the metagame. Its immunity to Dragon helps as well when facing Miraidon and Regidrago.</p> <p>Iron Hands is particularly weak to faster setup teams, with foes like Tera Grass Clefairy and Amoonguss that can take hits from Iron Hands and redirect its moves, allowing Calyrex-S to set up with Nasty Plot. Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus and Groudon can wall Iron Hands and threaten to 2HKO it. As a physical attacker, Iron Hands naturally struggles against Intimidate users like Incineroar as well as Defense-boosting Pokemon like Zamazenta-C that can set up Iron Defense, essentially walling Iron Hands. Miraidon naturally complements Iron Hands thanks to its Hadron Engine, as well as functioning as a fast offensive attacker capable of OHKOing all of the aforementioned checks. Meanwhile, a Trick Room setter such as Farigiraf provides excellent speed control to take advantage of Iron Hands's mediocre Speed tier. Farigiraf prevents any opposing Pokemon from using Fake Out thanks to Armor Tail while also having access to Helping Hand, which further boosts Iron Hands's offensive capabilities. Slower powerhouses like Ursaluna-B complement Iron Hands by threatening Incineroar and Zamazenta-C, as well as forming a solid Trick Room core with Farigiraf. Pokemon that fit well on a slower playstyle like Incineroar and Amoonguss also work well with Iron Hands by providing Fake Out, Intimidate, redirection and recovery to form a well-rounded balance core.</p>"

Hurricane's pairing with rain gives Iron Jugulis the ability to consistently threaten Pokemon like the Urshifu formes and Rillaboom. Tailwind is a strong speed control option to help support both itself and its teammates. The Speed investment along with Booster Energy allows Iron Jugulis to outspeed Choice Scarf Urshifu-R. The defensive investment allows Iron Jugulis to survive Flare Blitz from Koraidon in sun, Moonblast from non-Choice Specs Flutter Mane, and Thunderbolt from Assault Vest Raging Bolt. Tera Water provides Iron Jugulis with a better defensive typing against matchups like Calyrex-I and Urshifu-R.</p> <p>Iron Jugulis typically struggles versus powerful Electric-types like Miraidon and Booster Energy Raging Bolt, both of which threaten to OHKO it.

Assault Vest Kyogre is Iron Jugulis's best partner, providing rain for its Hurricane and benefitting greatly from Iron Jugulis's Tailwind. Kyogre's superb special bulk allows it to become untouchable on the special side when paired with Snarl, and, with Tera Grass, it can reliably deal with Electric-type threats. Urshifu-R is another great partner, as both it and Iron Jugulis are strong weather abusers that appreciate weather control, with Iron Jugulis covering for the Grass-types that Urshifu-R typically struggles against. Urshifu-R is a great beneficiary of Tailwind, which allows it to fire off fast Surging Strikes next to Iron Jugulis to exert offensive pressure.

Nasty Plot gives Gholdengo the option to set up once it has used Trick. Power Gem hits Fire-types that resist Make It Rain such as Incineroar, Chi-Yu, and Ogerpon-H. Alternatively, Dazzling Gleam threatens Pokemon like Miraidon and Koraidon. Choice Specs allows Gholdengo to use its strong Steel- and Ghost-type attacks to immediately threaten Pokemon like Calyrex-I, especially if it uses Tera Steel. The EV spread allows Gholdengo to survive Choice Specs Miraidon's Volt Switch, Incineroar's Flare Blitz, and Kyogre's Mystic Water-boosted Origin Pulse and OHKO bulky Flutter Mane sets with Shadow Ball.

Removing Psychic Terrain can allow Chien-Pao to threaten Calyrex-S with a super effective Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Icicle Crash hits less consistently, but it avoids Rocky Helmet damage, can cause foes to flinch, and keeps up Terrains that would benefit Chien-Pao.

Chien-Pao pairs well with physical attackers like Zacian-C and Rillaboom, as Sword of Ruin makes them even more potent threats and they can handle Urshifu-R and Flutter Mane for Chien-Pao. However, they also struggle against Incineroar and opposing Zacian-C. This makes Urshifu-R and Zamazenta-C also good options for Chien-Pao, since they can threaten Incineroar and Zacian-C while taking advantage of Sword of Ruin. Chien-Pao can threaten Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes such as Rillaboom and Raging Bolt, as well as making quick work of Ghost-types that are immune to Body Press such as Calyrex-S.</p>"

It is able to slow down powerful special attackers like Terapagos with Snarl and use its typing to have a positive matchup against Calyrex-S, Miraidon, and Raging Bolt. Ruination provides constant damage, while Throat Chop can threaten to OHKO Calyrex-S and prevent Parting Shot from Incineroar. Stomping Tantrum allows it to threaten Incineroar, Miraidon, and Raging Bolt. Heavy Slam is used on Assault Vest sets to threaten Fairy-type Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Tera Fairy Calyrex-S, whereas Protect sees play on Rocky Helmet sets. Assault Vest allows Ting-Lu to bolster its special bulk even more, making special attacks like Flutter Mane's Moonblast and Calyrex-S's Draining Kiss a 4HKO. Rocky Helmet threatens constant chip damage on Pokemon like Urshifu-R. The EV investment allows Ting-Lu to survive a Wood Hammer from Assault Vest Rillaboom and take two Moonblast from Speed Booster Energy Flutter Mane for the Rocky Helmet set. The Attack investment allows Ting-Lu to OHKO Flutter Mane with Heavy Slam and to 2HKO Raging Bolt and bulky Farigiraf with Stomping Tantrum and Throat Chop, respectively. Tera Poison is utilized to resist the Urshifu formes's Close Combat, Rillaboom's STAB moves, and Flutter Mane's Moonblast. Tera Fairy sees usage thanks to its defensive nature, allowing Ting-Lu to have great matchup into the Urshifu formes while also becoming immune to Draco Meteor from Raging Bolt and Miraidon.</p> <p>Ting-Lu sees usage with Restricted Pokemon like Calyrex-I and Zamazenta-C, allowing both to benefit from Ting-Lu's special damage reduction capabilities. Calyrex-I appreciates Ruination chip and Ting-Lu benefits from Trick Room set by Calyrex-I, while Zamazenta-C provides Wide Guard support, improving the matchup against opposing Calyrex-I. Ting-Lu can be slowed down by Pokemon like Incineroar, which makes Ting-Lu passive by reducing its damage output significantly thanks to Intimidate. Zamazenta-C helps in this regard because it can OHKO Incineroar with Body Press. Koraidon, Zamazenta-C, and Calyrex-I have a great matchup into Ting-Lu and are able to remove it from the field without taking much damage from its STAB moves. Therefore, Pelipper proves to be a great partner for Ting-Lu, providing rain support and Wide Guard, which slow down Pokemon like Koraidon and Calyrex-I, and threatening great damage on Incineroar with Weather Ball. Ting-Lu struggles against strong super effective attacks from Pokemon like Rillaboom, Kyogre, and the Urshifu formes. Raging Bolt is a great partner to Ting-Lu, as it can threaten Urshifu-R and Kyogre for super effective damage and resist Grass-type STAB moves from Rillaboom. Incineroar and Amoonguss are a great duo that support Ting-Lu well. Incineroar slows down Rillaboom thanks to Intimidate and threatens super effective damage with Flare Blitz. Amoonguss can redirect super effective moves like Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R and provide Pollen Puff healing. Ting-Lu, in return, checks Pokemon like Chi-Yu and Flutter Mane, which can be troublesome for Amoonguss.</p>"

These qualities along with proper speed control allow it to pressure common metagame Pokemon including both Calyrex formes, Rillaboom, Amoonguss, and Zamazenta-C. Snarl threatens a common Restricted core that revolves around redirection—Calyrex and Clefairy—and it can be used to chip away and weaken the damage output of bulkier specially offensive threats like Raging Bolt and Terapagos. Choice Specs allows Chi-Yu to pick up OHKOs on Pokemon like Assault Vest Rillaboom and Calyrex-I with Heat Wave and bulky Pelipper with Dark Pulse. Choice Scarf enables Chi-Yu to outspeed common fast metagame staples such as Chien-Pao, Calyrex-S, and Flutter Mane without Protosynthesis Speed activated. The defensive investment guarantees that Chi-Yu survives Surging Strikes and Tera Water Aqua Jet from Urshifu-R when Chi-Yu has used Tera Ghost, High Horsepower from most Assault Vest Rillaboom, and Tera Starstorm from Terapagos-S at +2. The Speed EVs allow Chi-Yu to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Urshifu formes, and it also outspeeds Caylrex-S if running Choice Scarf.

Kyogre and Pelipper are also definite Chi-Yu answers, as they weaken its Fire-type moves with Drizzle and can retaliate with an OHKO with Water Spout or Origin Pulse and Weather Ball, respectively. Chi-Yu has a plethora of great partners; Choice Specs Terapagos and Miraidon both take great advantage of the power boost provided by Beads of Ruin and are able to pressure Pokemon like Kyogre and Incineroar. Koraidon is another good partner for it because it sets up the sun, overriding rain from Pelipper and Kyogre and boosting Chi-Yu's Fire-type attacks. This also mitigates its weakness to Water-type moves, aiding in Chi-Yu's matchup against the aforementioned threats. Chi-Yu can also function by itself with speed control from Prankster Tailwind setters like Whimsicott and Tornadus, which can also set up the sun.</p>"

It matches up well against some common restricted Pokemon such as both Calyrex formes and Zamazenta-C and it can also pressure common Pokemon such as Rillaboom, Gholdengo, and Amoonguss with its STAB moves. Snarl keeps special attacking threats such as Calyrex-S and Terapagos in check and still does respectable spread damage, while Dark Pulse provides strong and consistent damage. Overheat is an instant burst of damage that allows Chi-Yu to OHKO even bulky threats like Rillaboom and Zamazenta-C while also getting around Wide Guard. Since it is very frail, Focus Sash helps Chi-Yu survive for longer, whereas Life Orb gives it a significant damage boost, allowing it to OHKO Flutter Mane with Overheat and 2HKO Miraidon with Dark Pulse. Tera Ghost allows it to avoid Fake Out and gain an immunity to otherwise threatening Fighting-type attacks from Koraidon and the Urshifu formes.</p> <p>Chi-Yu pairs well with strong special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Terapagos, since both of them benefit a lot from Beads of Ruin.

Chi-Yu also has problems with Urshifu-R, since it can switch-in on both Heat Wave and Dark Pulse and OHKO Chi-Yu back with Surging Strikes. Amoonguss helps with that issue, by redirecting away Fighting- and Water-type attacks from Urshifu-R, letting Chi-Yu deal damage more consistently. Pelipper is a strong Chi-Yu answer, since it sets up rain and is able to protect teammates from Chi-Yu's attacks with Wide Guard. Incineroar and Assault Vest Raging Bolt can take hits from it easily, meaning that the former can pivot out with Parting Shot and the latter is able to use Snarl, do high damage to it, or take advantage of Beads of Ruin and attack its partner.</p>"

Snarl is preferred to weaken threats such as Terapagos, Calyrex-S, Raging Bolt, and opposing Chi-Yu; however, Chi-Yu can opt instead for Dark Pulse for a more consistent STAB option against Farigiraf and Pelipper. Overheat is used for burst damage, enabling Chi-Yu to OHKO Calyrex-I and Assault Vest Rillaboom. Taunt is an excellent way for Chi-Yu to shut down Amoonguss as well as Trick Room from setters like Farigiraf and Calyrex-I. This is further enhanced by Covert Cloak's Fake Out immunity, and Covert Cloak also provides Chi-Yu with a valuable immunity to Snarl and Icy Wind stat drops. The EV spread allows Chi-Yu to survive Discharge from Choice Specs Miraidon, Earth Power from Choice Specs Terapagos, and after Terastallization, Close Combat from Urshifu-R. The Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature ensure an OHKO on Zamazenta-C with Overheat, and the Speed EVs enable Chi-Yu to outspeed Terapagos and Adamant Urshifu formes. Tera Water provides a resistance to Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes and Pelipper's Weather Ball while improving Chi-Yu's matchup against Calyrex-I.</p> <p>Because Chi-Yu has relatively poor bulk and a mediocre Speed tier, it struggles with fast, powerful threats such as Miraidon, Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, Koraidon, and Chien-Pao. This makes Rillaboom an exceptional partner, as it can mitigate Miraidon's damage output and threaten Urshifu-R with Wood Hammer and priority Grassy Glide. Rillaboom also appreciates not only Chi-Yu's ability to threaten Steel- and Grass-types like Gholdengo and opposing Rillaboom but also its Taunt shutting down Will-O-Wisp and Parting Shot from Incineroar. Clefairy is also a good partner, enhancing Chi-Yu's bulk and redirecting away attacks to allow Chi-Yu to survive extra crucial turns against Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao. Calyrex-S is a great restricted partner, outspeeding and threatening Miraidon, Koraidon, and Chien-Pao, while also taking advantage of Beads of Ruin. Clefairy and Calyrex-S both appreciate how well Chi-Yu handles Amoonguss and Terapagos. Exceptionally bulky attackers like Kyogre and especially Assault Vest Iron Hands can exploit Chi-Yu's frail defenses, so the above mentioned Rillaboom can be a great help to threaten it and Iron Hands for major damage.</p>"

Spirit Break reduces the damage of common special attackers like Miraidon, Calyrex-S, Terapagos, and Kyogre. Iron Valiant's fast Coaching increases the damage and bulk of allies such as Calyrex-I and Urshifu-R, allowing Calyrex-I to OHKO Flutter Mane and Calyrex-S with Glacial Lance and Urshifu-R to OHKO the same Pokemon as well as Chien-Pao and Ogerpon-C with Surging Strikes. The Defense boost allows Calyrex-I to live Ogerpon-C's Tera Rock Ivy Cudgel and Koraidon's Flare Blitz in the sun.

Faster offensive Pokemon such as Calyrex-S, Zacian-C, and Chien-Pao also threaten Miraidon. Chi-Yu pairs well with Miraidon, threatening the aforementioned threats and increasing Miraidon's damage with Beads of Ruin. Farigiraf is an exceptional partner for Miraidon to block Fake Out from Rillaboom, Incineroar, and Iron Hands, allowing Miraidon to continue attacking without disruption, and it additionally takes little to no damage from Calyrex-S while threatening it with Foul Play. A partner Iron Hands threatens Chien-Pao and, thanks to having its damage increased by Miraidon's Electric Terrain, can significantly damage Incineroar even after Intimidate. Whimsicott supports Miraidon with priority Tailwind to boost Miraidon's Speed and Encore to threaten Fake Out users and setup Pokemon such as Nasty Plot Calyrex-S. Ursaluna-B is another good partner that threatens Calyrex-S and allows Miraidon to use Discharge safely thanks to its Ground typing. Volcarona also supports Miraidon well by threatening to OHKO or burn Zacian-C, Rillaboom, and Chien-Pao.</p>"

Horn Leech is used to deal consistent damage while boosting Ogerpon-W's longevity, while Wood Hammer allows Ogerpon-W to OHKO Flutter Mane and Kyogre. Ogerpon-W also matches up well into Calyrex-S and Ursaluna-B after it Terastallizes, threatening to 2HKO Calyrex-S and OHKO Ursaluna-B with Tera Water Ivy Cudgel.

Its STAB combination allows it to threaten many metagame staples, such as Rillaboom, Amoonguss, Calyrex-I, and Urshifu-R, for massive damage. Ogerpon-H prefers to use Wood Hammer to ensure OHKOs on Urshifu-R and bulky Kyogre; however, Horn Leech is used alongside the defensive sets for more survivability while still 2HKOing the aforementioned Water-types. Grassy Glide is a niche option, providing Ogerpon-H with a powerful priority move alongside Rillaboom and allowing Ogerpon-H to attack faster threats like Calyrex-S and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R before they move. The HP and Defense investment ensures that Ogerpon-H survives Tera Stellar Icicle Crash from Chien-Pao and almost always lives Tera Water Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R. The Speed EVs allow Ogerpon-H to outspeed Modest Landorus, and the rest is to maximize Attack. Ogerpon-H can use a much bulkier EV spread of 220 HP / 12 Atk / 252 Def / 4 SpD / 20 Spe with an Impish nature, which allows it to avoid the 2HKO from Chien-Pao's Ice Spinner, Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance, and Iron Hands's Quark Drive-boosted Drain Punch as well as surviving +1 Tera Fire Ivy Cudgel from opposing Ogerpon-H. The Speed investment allows Ogerpon-H to outspeed neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Regidrago.</p> <p>Ogerpon-H especially struggles with Incineroar, which stomachs its attacks and weakens it with Intimidate and Parting Shot. Dragon-types like Raging Bolt and Roaring Moon are also problematic, taking its attacks and threatening massive damage with Draco Meteor and Acrobatics respectively. Landorus can also be threatening thanks to being able to threaten Ogerpon-H before and after it Terastallizes with Sludge Bomb and Earth Power respectively. Urshifu-R and Landorus make for excellent partners, as they threaten OHKOs on many of the aforementioned Pokemon with their STAB moves. The two also appreciate Ogerpon-H's support, as it can protect them from threatening Pokemon like Rillaboom and Chien-Pao with Follow Me. Miraidon makes excellent use of Ogerpon-H, as it appreciates Ogerpon-H threatening common checks like Rillaboom and Zacian-C with Ivy Cudgel and stomaching their attacks with Follow Me. Calyrex-I is another Restricted Pokemon that works well with Ogerpon-H, as it threatens Landorus and Raging Bolt with Glacial Lance. Calyrex-I has an easier time setting up Trick Room and dealing with disruptive status moves such as Amoonguss's Spore and Incineroar's Will-O-Wisp thanks to Ogerpon-H's Follow Me. Ogerpon-H also threatens foes that resist Glacial Lance like Zamazenta-C, Urshifu-R, and opposing Calyrex-I. Groudon also works particularly well with Ogerpon-H, threatening super effective damage on Incineroar and Raging Bolt with Precipice Blades, while bolstering Ogerpon-H's damage output with sun. Ogerpon-H can support Groudon by redirecting attacks from Rillaboom and Chien-Pao while also threatening Kyogre with its Grass-type STAB attacks, all of which are difficult matchups for Groudon. Powerful setup sweepers such as Calyex-S and Calm Mind Terapagos also make great use of Ogerpon-H. Ogerpon-H can help them set up by redirecting away powerful attacks such as Urshifu-S's Sucker Punch and Drain Punch from Iron Hands  as well as disruptive moves like Amoonguss's Spore and Incineroar's Parting Shot. Ogerpon-H is also helpful offensively, as it can threaten otherwise problematic Pokemon like Chien-Pao and Urshifu-R with Ivy Cudgel and its Grass-type move of choice respectively.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Assault Vest Archaludon is commonly used on rain-reliant teams, allowing it to use Electro Shot every turn. Rain teams also utilize powerful Water-types such as Basculegion-M, which threatens Ground-types like Ursaluna that threaten Archaludon. Assault Vest Archaludon also appreciates redirection and damage reduction, allowing it to set up freely while gaining boosts from Stamina. Power Herb Archaludon needs to deal as much damage as possible before fainting, so it is best paired with fast or priority-boosted forms of speed control like Whimsicott.</li> <li>When it's used with rain, common partners alongside Archaludon are Pelipper, Basculegion-M and Amoonguss. Pelipper and Basculegion-M cover Archaludon's Ground- and Fighting-type weaknesses, while Amoonguss redirects damage with Rage Powder and can heal Archaludon with Pollen Puff. When using the Power Herb set, Archaludon is commonly paired with priority Tailwind users such as Whimsicott and Talonflame, allowing it to attack before its foes can, and it is used on balance teams paired with partners such as Rillaboom and Primarina that threaten Ground- and Fighting-types. Rillaboom can also disrupt opponents with Fake Out as well as healing Archaludon with Grassy Terrain. Incineroar also pairs well with both Archaludon sets, as it can disrupt opponents with Fake Out while providing damage reduction with Intimidate.</li> <li>Before Terastallizing, Archaludon takes severe damage from Ground- and Fighting-types such as Ursaluna and Flamigo. Water- and Grass-type partners such as Pelipper, Primarina, and Rillaboom mitigate the Ground-type weakness, with Pelipper and Primarina also threatening Fighting-types. Archaludon struggles to damage Ghost-types, in particular Gholdengo with its additional Steel typing, so Dark- and Ghost-type partners such as Incineroar and Basculegion-M can threaten them. Haze is another great roadblock to Archaludon. With Primarina being the most common Haze user, Rillaboom can threaten Primarina before it is able to use it.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Archaludon is a sweeper capable of dealing significant damage to most foes after a +1 Special Attack boost from Electro Shot or with Body Press after gaining multiple Defense boosts from Stamina. Archaludon should often be sent out first in order to start setting up early when using the Assault Vest set, and it functions best when it's used on rain teams.</li> <li>The Power Herb set can be used either early- or late-game. It mostly requires speed control through Tailwind in order to deal significant damage before fainting, making this set ideal on hyper offense teams. It can also be slotted onto balance teams that require a powerful special attacker or Steel- and Dragon-type coverage.</li> <li>Ursaluna is a huge check to Archaludon, as it's capable of OHKOing it before it Terastallizes, while Archaludon can't OHKO it back. Archaludon is therefore reliant on partners that can KO or weaken Ursaluna such as Basculegion-M and Incineroar. Gholdengo walls Archaludon, so it relies on partners like Incineroar to survive attacks from Gholdengo and threaten it back. Removing rain prevents Assault Vest Archaludon from freely gaining boosts and attacking with Electro Shot, greatly hindering its setup. This forces Pelipper to be brought back onto the field to reset the weather. Haze also counters Assault Vest Archaludon, severly weakening its damage output and bulk, so partners such as Rillaboom that can KO Haze users like Primarina before they can attack help to mitigate this.</li> </ul>",

        "description": "<p>Raging Bolt is an incredibly bulky special attacker that can stay on the field and survive hits from Restricted Pokemon, and threaten them back with its huge Special Attack stat and weaken their team with stat reducing moves. It matches up incredibly well into Urshifu-R, keeping it in check with Thunderclap, Koraidon, since it commonly doesn't run Dragon-type moves, common Fire / Water / Grass cores, which usually have Incineroar, Rillaboom, and Urshifu-R or Ogerpon-W, and multiple strong special attackers with Snarl, such as Kyogre, Calyrex-S, and Terapagos. Electroweb gives Raging Bolt a solid speed control option while still dealing relevant damage.  Thunderbolt is a consistent and strong STAB option, and Volt Switch gives it a strong way to reposition itself. Assault Vest allows it to survive hits more easily from strong special attackers such as Calyrex-S, Terapagos, Kyogre, Flutter Mane, and opposing Raging Bolt while punishing them with a Snarl, Electroweb, or stronger attacking move. The EV spread allows it to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S, survive an Icicle Crash from Chien-Pao, and outspeed -1 Gholdengo and Adamant Urshifu. Tera Electric significantly increases the damage it does at the cost of remaining vulnerable to strong Ground-type attackers such as Landorus and Groudon, while Tera Fairy allows it to gain an immunity to threatening Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Miraidon and opposing Raging Bolt while still having a very strong defensive typing into the current metagame.</p> <p>Raging Bolt synergizes well with multiple Pokemon and can work on many team structures, but some notable partners are Incineroar, since it can reduce the threat from physical moves that Raging Bolt cannot weaken, Koraidon, since it activates Raging Bolt's ability Protosynthesis by setting up sun, and Urshifu-R, which checks multiple strong threats to Raging Bolt like Calyrex-I, Flutter Mane, Chien-Pao, and Landorus. Another Pokemon that checks Raging Bolt is Amoonguss, since Raging Bolt can't stop a Spore from going off and Raging Bolt's attacks can be redirected by Rage Powder without many issues. It is also vulnerable to Fake Out, since Raging Bolt is unable to use Protect to block it because of its Assault Vest, and variants without Draco Meteor can't threaten Incineroar for high damage, allowing it to use Parting Shot and pivot out relatively safely.</p>"

      "Three Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>Raging Bolt is a strong special attacker that uses its good natural bulk and offensive typing to survive attacks and respond with strong Electric- and Dragon-type moves. Draco Meteor gives Raging Bolt a one-time nuke, while Dragon Pulse is a more consistent option for Life Orb sets. Thunderclap allows Raging Bolt to threaten faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Urshifu-R before they can move. Booster Energy and Life Orb both allow Raging Bolt to deal more damage at the cost of either losing its boost on switch or taking recoil. Life Orb is used on sun teams, as its boost can stack with the Protosynthesis boost. Tera Electric boosts Thunderbolt and Thunderclap, allowing Raging Bolt to OHKO Pokemon such as bulky Kyogre with Thunderbolt and Urshifu-R with Thunderclap if Urshifu-R Terastallizes into a neutral type, as well as 2HKOing Calyrex-I with Thunderbolt. Tera Fairy makes Raging Bolt immune to Dragon-type attacks like Miraidon's Draco Meteor in addition to being a good neutral type.</p> <p>Raging Bolt struggles into bulky Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Ting-Lu that resist or are immune to Thunderbolt, survive Draco Meteor or Dragon Pulse, and respond with Spore or a super effective attack. Faster offensive Pokemon like Miraidon, Zacian-C, and Landorus are also a problem for Raging Bolt, as they can threaten to OHKO it. Calyrex-I threatens the Grass-, Ground-, and Dragon-types that resist Thunderbolt, as well as setting up Trick Room to help Raging Bolt with faster threats. Raging Bolt can also hit the Water-types that resist Glacial Lance with Thunderbolt or Thunderclap. Pokemon that can set up sun such as Koraidon also pair well with Raging Bolt, as they allow it to get a Protosynthesis boost in addition to Life Orb. Raging Bolt can support them by threatening Water-types that resist Flare Blitz or by removing Pelipper, which is a common check to sun teams.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Raging Bolt's good natural bulk allows it to function well as a bulky setup sweeper. It has good matchups against Kyogre and Urshifu-R due to STAB Thunderclap. Dragon Pulse is commonly used to break Pokemon that resist Thunderclap, like opposing Raging Bolt and Miraidon. Dragon Pulse may also aid against Pokemon with redirection like Ogerpon-W or Armor Tail Farigiraf that blocks Thunderclap. Leftovers is the preferred item on Calm Mind Raging Bolt due to the increased longevity, especially when paired with Grassy Terrain support from Rillaboom. Alternatively, Raging Bolt can use Booster Energy for an immediate power boost, threatening an OHKO on Miraidon and a 2HKO on Calyrex-S. 244 HP and 52 Defense EVs allow Raging Bolt to survive Adamant Chien-Pao's Ice Spinner. The HP and Special Defense EVs allow +1 Special Defense Terastallized Raging Bolt to survive two attacks from both Modest Flutter Mane's Moonblast and Landorus's Earth Power. 92 Speed EVs allow Raging Bolt to outspeed 4 Speed Rillaboom. Tera Fairy is the Tera type of choice because it provides Raging Bolt an even matchup into most of the format.</p> <p>Good partners for Calm Mind Raging Bolt include Rillaboom because it can provide Grassy Terrain and create free turns with Fake Out, allowing Raging Bolt to set up more safely. Similarly, Incineroar is often paired with Raging Bolt, since it can offer damage reduction and Fake Out support. Redirection, such as Ogerpon-W's Follow Me, is greatly appreciated by Raging Bolt. Groudon and Koraidon are also good partners for Raging Bolt, since they can activate its Protosynthesis ability and check Pokemon like Amoonguss and Zacian-C, which are common checks for Raging Bolt. Amoonguss threatens Raging Bolt's Thunderclap via Rage Powder redirection and Spore. Zacian-C, Groudon, Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Calyrex-I, and Landorus can threaten Raging Bolt before and after it Terastallizes.</p>"

Access to Helping Hand also further amplifies its partner's ridiculous damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Iron Crown's best counters are Dark- and Steel-types, namely Incineroar, Kingambit, Archaludon, and Gholdengo, all of which resist both of Iron Crown's STAB moves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Therefore, Iron Crown appreciates Pokemon that can help remove these threats consistently, such as Landorus, Entei, and Urshifu-R. In return, Iron Crown can pressure opposing Urshifu-R and Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rillaboom is another noteworthy check, as it is able to safely pivot in and override Psychic Terrain, weakening Expanding Force significantly. Other Pokemon with access to Ice Spinner like Chien-Pao and Dragonite can also be used to remove Psychic Terrain.</p> </li> <li> <p>Faster Pokemon like Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane serve as good checks as well, but they have to watch out for Follow Me from Indeedee-F as they are vulnerable to Tachyon Cutter.</p> </li> </ul>",

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Terapagos is a bulky setup sweeper, with Tera Shell boosting its already great longevity with its high natural bulk. In addition to this, Tera Starstorm becomes a powerful unresisted spread move when Terapagos Terastallizes. Earth Power is ran to allow Terapagos to deal significant damage to Steel-types and Wide Guard users it otherwise would struggle to defeat, notably Zamazenta-C. Leftovers benefits Terapagos's longevity when it does not have a partner to heal it, allowing Tera Shell to be reactivated. Covert Cloak is also a great item, as it prevents Terapagos's Special Attack from being lowered by opposing Snarl and provides the bonus of making it immune to flinch from Fake Out. Clear Amulet is used similarly to Covert Cloak but also prevents Parting Shot lowering Terapagos's Special Attack. Terapagos matches up very well against Calyrex-S, as it is immune to Astral Barrage, and damage from Draining Kiss and Expanding Force can be mitigated by its massive bulk bolstered by Tera Shell, Special Defense boosts from Calm Mind, and partners such as Amoonguss with Rage Powder and Pollen Puff. Teraform Zero disrupts strategies revolving around Miraidon, Groudon and Kyogre's terrain and weather setting abilities. The given EV spread allows Terapagos to survive Collision Course from Koraidon on the physically defensive side and Electro Drift from Choice Specs Miraidon on the specially defensive side with Tera Shell active or while Terastallized. With the bulk the spread provides, Electro Drift becomes a guaranteed 3HKO with Leftovers recovery after Electric Terrain is removed. The Special Attack investment maximizes the value of Terapagos's Calm Mind boosts, the Speed investment lets it outpace 4 Speed investment Rillaboom, and the HP EVs maximize the recovery gained from Leftovers.</p> <p>Rillaboom is a great partner for Terapagos, providing Grassy Terrain recovery and Fake Out to allow it to gain Calm Mind boosts. Incineroar is another great partner, as it can assist Terapagos in defeating Steel- and Ghost-types with Flare Blitz and Knock Off, as well as providing defensive utility through Intimidate, Parting Shot, and Will-O-Wisp on top of Fake Out. Amoonguss supports Terapagos very well, providing HP recovery with Pollen Puff. Its Rage Powder and Spore also allow Terapagos to safely use Calm Mind. Terapagos struggles to defeat Calyrex-I-centred teams, as it is very reliant on a partner Incineroar to reduce the physical damage it takes and deal super effective damage to Calyrex-I. Zamazenta-C can use Wide Guard, preventing Terapagos from dealing damage with Tera Starstorm while Terastallized, and Terapagos is very reliant on Earth Power as well as partners like Incineroar to deal super effective damage to it. As a result, Gholdengo pairs well with Terapagos, since it reliably checks both Calyrex-I and Zamazenta-C with its natural typing. Koraidon can be troublesome, as it can outdamage Terapagos's teammates' recovery while it is setting up with Calm Mind. Taunt Flutter Mane sets cause huge problems for Terapagos, since it cannot damage Flutter Mane significantly if Flutter Mane has not Terastallized, and Terapagos deals little damage without Calm Mind boosts.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Terapagos can be used as a hyper offensive threat with its high Special Attack and powerful spread move, Tera Starstorm. Choice Specs immediately boosts the damage output from Tera Starstorm, allowing Terapagos to pick up early-game KOs, which the more common Calm Mind set cannot. Its natural bulk in addition to Tera Shell allows it to withstand powerful attacks that other hyper offensive threats may not be able to. Terapagos has a very good matchup into the oppressive Calyrex-S with an immunity to Astral Barrage. Teraform Zero disrupts strategies revolving around Miraidon, Groudon and Kyogre's Terrain- and weather-setting abilities. Tera Starstorm is the attack Terapagos will want to use most of the time, but Earth Power and Dark Pulse provide coverage for Steel- and Ghost-types that its partners may not be able to comfortably defeat, like Zamazenta-C and Calyrex-S. Hyper Beam allows Terapagos to pick up KOs around Wide Guard users while Terastallized. Sleep Talk allows Terapagos to continue dealing significant damage even when put to sleep from moves such as Amoonguss's Spore.</p> <p>With a middling Speed stat, Terapagos greatly benefits from Tailwind support, which allows it to outspeed and significantly damage its foes more effectively. Tornadus is the best priority Tailwind setter in the format, so it is naturally a great partner for Choice Specs Terapagos. It also deals super effective damage to Fighting-types that threaten Terapagos like the Urshifu formes. Tornadus can utilize priority Taunt to shut down Wide Guard users, most Trick Room setters, and Spore from opposing Amoonguss. Zamazenta-C is very difficult for Terapagos to defeat because of its natural typing and Wide Guard, so it relies on a partner Chi-Yu to defeat it or cripple its offense with Will-O-Wisp. Chi-Yu easily defeats Steel- and Ghost-types that Terapagos struggles against and provides Beads of Ruin support. Amoonguss provides great redirection support with Rage Powder in the face of threats such as Mienshao and both Urshifu formes, and it can shut down threats with Spore. Pollen Puff benefits Terapagos with healing, reactivating Tera Shell. Flutter Mane can check Koraidon with its natural typing as well as provide Icy Wind and Taunt support. Lunala is tough to break with its high natural bulk and Shadow Shield alongside Wide Guard, but a partner Incineroar can weaken its Special Attack and KO it with Snarl and Knock Off. Ting-Lu's great special bulk thanks to Assault Vest and Vessel of Ruin is very difficult for Terapagos to break through, and it can reduce Terapagos's Special Attack further with Snarl. This makes Urshifu-R a great partner, forcing Ting-Lu to Terastallize to remove its weakness to Urshifu-R's STAB moves while gaining a weakness to Terapagos. Koraidon can survive Tera Starstorm and threaten an OHKO on Terastallized Terapagos in return. A partner Flutter Mane forces Koraidon to Terastallize, making it weak to Terapagos. Pelipper is tough for Terapagos to break due to its access to Wide Guard and immunity to Earth Power, so it appreciates partners such as Raging Bolt to threaten Pelipper.</p>"
