Snarl Pokemon such as Chi-Yu and Raging Bolt can make Porygon2 a sitting duck, making it far less of an issue offensively.

Incineroar makes up for Sylveons middling physical bulk with Parting Shot and Intimidate, as well as handling the Steel- and Fire-types that Sylveon struggles against. Ogerpon-W not only provides Follow Me support but similarly to Incineroar is able to handle Steel- and Fire-type attacks safely. Landorus is a great offensive partner, with it and Sylveon covering each other's checks, as well as making up for Sylveon's low initial damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sylveon's biggest issue is that it struggles to find a slot on most teams due to its competition with Flutter Mane, which is more of an immediate threat thanks to its higher single target damage, higher Speed, and Fake Out immunity from its Ghost typing. While Sylveon has use cases thanks to its bulk and pure Fairy typing, Flutter Mane is easier to fit into most compositions and is able to function well with minimal support.

Both Urshifu formes and Chien-Pao with Sacred Sword ignore Dondozo's Defense boost, with Chien-Pao both outspeeding and threatening Dondozo if it uses Tera Grass, and Urshifu-S dealing big damage with Wicked Blow and removing Dondozo's ability to stall with Protect. Incineroar and Gouging Fire are able to consistently weaken Dondozo with Breaking Swipe and Intimidate cycling respectively.

Roaring Moon's Dark-type STAB moves and excellent elemental resistances make it a great answer to Iron Crown and Gholdengo, as well as the Ogerpon formes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Roaring Moon appreciates partners such as Ogerpon-W, Amoonguss, and Incineroar, which help it to set up Tailwind or Dragon Dance through free turns, the former two handle threats like Urshifu-R and Flutter Mane exceptionally well. Ogerpon-W greatly benefits from Tailwind, while Amoonguss has superb defensive synergy with Roaring Moon; all partners enjoy Breaking Swipe as well. With Acrobatics, Dragon Dance Roaring Moon can help the former two by removing the powder-immune Grass-types and help Incineroar by threatening both Urshfiu formes. Flutter Mane is also a great beneficiary of Roaring Moon, handling opposing Flutter Mane and both Urshifu formes with Tailwind support, and Breaking Swipe protecting it from the physical attackers it's weak to.</p> </li> <li> <p>Roaring Moon's typing, while welcoming fantastic resistances, also invites weaknesses to some of the metagame's most popular threats like the aforementioned Flutter Mane, both Urshifu formes, and Chien-Pao. Roaring Moon can notably mitigate the latter two's damage output if running Breaking Swipe and break Urshifu-S and Chien-Pao's Focus Sash in the process but requires support against them. Incineroar also poses an issue for Roaring Moon, as it resists Knock Off and weakens Roaring Moon with Intimidate. Incineroar's Fake Out can also be used to stall Tailwind turns.</p> </li> </ul>",
