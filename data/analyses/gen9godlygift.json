Thunderbolt provides a consistent source of damage, while Leaf Storm acts like a nuke against neutral targets and Ground-types looking to block Volt Switch such as Landorus. Tera Blast Ice nails Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon like Hydrapple and Eternatus for super effective damage, while Tera Blast Fire hits Zacian-C, Iron Treads, and specially defensive Excadrill. Volt Switch is Hisuian Electrode's most spammable move, allowing it to pivot out and maintain momentum against checks such as Kyurem-W and Galarian Slowking. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Hisuian Electrode to safely pivot on and off the field throughout the game.</p> <p>Hisuian Electrode best fits on teams looking for a strong, special attacking pivot. However, a high Special Attack god like Kyurem-W or Eternatus is required to allow it to actually make progress. Hisuian Electrode pairs well with other offensive pivots such as Landorus-T, Meowscarada, and Hisuian Samurott, as they can chip away at each other's checks. Meowscarada in particular is helpful, as Triple Axel nukes the aforementioned Grass- and Dragon-types that wall Hisuian Electrode, allowing it to comfortably run Tera Fire over Tera Ice. Alternatively, slower pivots such as Pecharunt, Corviknight, and Mandibuzz are helpful in bringing Hisuian Electrode onto the field safely, circumventing its relative frailty. Hisuian Electrode also appreciates powerful physical attackers such as Great Tusk and Weavile, as they are able to break special walls such as Eternatus and Galarian Slowking. Lastly, entry hazard setters like Skarmory, Clefable, and Landorus-T are helpful, as they let Hisuian Electrode's constant pivoting force chip damage onto its checks, allowing it to beat them long-term.</p>"

Choice Band combined with an Attack donation makes it extremely difficult to switch into. Knock Off and Triple Axel are mandatory, with Knock Off removing important items like Rocky Helmet, Leftovers, and Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Skarmory, Primarina, and Moltres. Ice Shard picks off weakened foes such as Hisuian Electrode and Choice Scarf Landorus. For the last moveslot, Low Kick allows Weavile to nail Pokemon such as Heatran and Archaludon with super effective damage, while Beat Up is useful with high-Attack teammates, being a consistent, non-contact move early-game. Tera Dark makes Knock Off even harder to manage and removes Weavile's weakness to Stealth Rock, while Tera Ice makes Triple Axel's damage output nuclear and improves Ice Shard's revenge killing potential.</p> <p>High-Attack gods like Necrozma-DM and Groudon are good fits for Weavile, as they are able to boost its damage by sizeable margins; in return, Weavile can break certain physical walls such as Zapdos and Great Tusk for them. Additionally, Groudon specifically is able to eliminate Steel-types for Weavile, which is especially useful for non-Low Kick variants. As Weavile is weak to Stealth Rock and still vulnerable to other entry hazards, hazard control from Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Hatterene, and Corviknight is important. In addition, though Weavile is powerful and fast, it is incredibly frail, thus necessitating pivots like Rotom-W, Pecharunt, and Landorus-T to bring it in safely. Pecharunt is especially useful, being able to switch into Fairy- and Fighting-type moves and threatening Fairy-types for Weavile. In return, Weavile eliminates Pokemon such as Reuniclus and Landorus that threaten Pecharunt. Weavile also appreciates powerful special attackers such as Landorus, Iron Moth, and Hisuian Electrode, as they are able to break physical walls such as Skarmory, Moltres, and Primarina. Landorus and Iron Moth are especially helpful in breaking Zacian-C, Weavile's toughest matchup. Also, Weavile pairs well with hazard setters such as Skarmory and Ting-Lu, as it is able to remove opposing Heavy-Duty Boots and rack up chip damage, making itself even harder to switch into.</p>"

Hydro Pump provides solid STAB damage to keep Rotom-W from being too passive and punishes Ground-types like Great Tusk and Iron Treads that can switch into Volt Switch. In the last two moveslots, Rotom-W can run any combination of Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, and Protect; Thunder Wave cripples Pokemon that rely on their Speed, like Weavile, Sneasler, and Zacian-C, while Will-O-Wisp neutralizes physical attackers like the previous three, as well as Calyrex-I, Iron Hands, and Rillaboom. Pain Split works better when receiving lower HP stats from gods such as Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C, as it heals more than when receiving HP from gods like Arceus and Eternatus, in which case it's better to use Protect to stall turns while Rotom-W regains HP from Leftovers. Tera Steel allows Rotom-W to defend against Grass-types like Rillaboom, Ogerpon, and Meowscarada, and being Steel-type with an immunity to Ground gives it a generally sound defensive typing. Leftovers is important because it provides Rotom-W with much needed recovery, as it lacks consistent healing options, so it needs to be careful switching into Pokemon with Knock Off like Weavile, Great Tusk, and Hisuian Samurott.</p> <p>Rotom-W fits well on offensive teams that can make full use of the momentum it creates while also typically playing shorter games, which gives opponents less time to exploit its lack of longevity. Rotom-W is able to switch into physical attackers such as Weavile, Hisuian Samurott, and Zamazenta and even some gods such as Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Calyrex-I and scare them out with the threat of Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave. Set Up Sweepers like Weavile, Ogerpon-W, and Landorus appreciate Rotom-W's ability to pivot them in safely while also crippling opposing wallbreakers with status effects. Rotom-W also creates free switch-ins for wallbreakers with more immediate power such as Choice Band Urshifu-S, Choice Band Rillaboom, and Power Herb Glimmora, which can KO bulky foes like Pecharunt, Hydrapple, and Clefable that Rotom-W and its teammates struggle with. Gods with high base HP stats, like Eternatus and Arceus, are ideal donors for sets using Protect, while gods with lower base HP stats like Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C are better for sets running Pain Split. Rotom-W struggles greatly with Grass-types so it's happiest alongside teammates that can reliably switch into them such as Heatran, Corviknight, and Galarian Slowking; the latter two have the additional benefit of U-turn and Chilly Reception, respectively, allowing them to form strong pivoting cores that excel at getting the right Pokemon onto the field.</p>"

Arceus-Fairy's high defensive stats also lend themselves to bulky pivots such as the aforementioned three Pokemon, which support Arceus-Fairy by getting it in safely. Hisuian Samurott and Meowscarada are great choices to receive Arceus-Fairy's Attack stat, as they provide Spikes, pivoting, and Knock Off support. Entry hazard setters such as the aforementioned Hisuian Samurott, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T help wear down specially defensive Pokemon so that Arceus-Fairy has a better shot at 2HKOing them later. Arceus-Fairy struggles to break bulky Pokemon such as Skarmory, Dondozo, and Ho-Oh, so it appreciates Pokemon that beat these walls, such as Ogerpon-W, Zapdos, and Iron Hands. Other special attackers like Hisuian Electrode and Hoopa-U can force in mutual checks such as Clodsire, Galarian Slowking, and specially defensive Excadrill and chip them so that Arceus-Fairy can overpower them with Calm Mind boosts further down the line, with Hisuian Electrode also being able to pivot with Volt Switch.</p>"

Thanks to an Attack donation, Hisuian Samurott gains a significant power boost, helping it capitalize on its STAB options to break through bulkier foes. Ceaseless Edge serves as Hisuian Samurott's most spammable move, while Razor Shell has the ability to break past opposing walls such as Mandibuzz thanks to the potential Defense drop. Knock Off provides great utility by removing items, especially Heavy-Duty Boots from pivots like Ogerpon and Zapdos, and serves as a strong spammable STAB option when paired with Tera Dark, while Flip Turn enables Hisuian Samurott to pivot and maintain momentum against Pokemon like Meowscarada and Zacian-C. Choice Scarf allows Hisuian Samurott to revenge kill effectively and maintain momentum against faster threats such as Lunala and Great Tusk.</p> <p>Gods with higher Attack such as Calyrex-I and Zacian-C are excellent choices for Hisuian Samurott, offering an Attack boost that enables it to break through bulkier foes more effectively. Alternatively, Arceus can be used, as it still offers an Attack increase while benefitting from Hisuian Samurott's ability to set up Spikes more. Due to Hisuian Samurott's relative frailty, defensive pivots such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Galarian Slowking are valuable teammates, giving it safe entry onto the field. Additionally, pairing Hisuian Samurott with strong special attackers like Iron Moth and Hisuian Electrode helps break through opposing physical walls that it might struggle against, such as Skarmory and Zamazenta. Furthermore, both Pokemon form a VoltTurn core with Hisuian Samurott, further weakening each other's checks. Other physical wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Iron Hands and Bulk Up Great Tusk can synergize well with Hisuian Samurott to overwhelm defensive checks such as Rotom-Wash. Finally, since much of Hisuian Samurott's value comes from its ability to set up Spikes, teammates that can deter or deny hazard removal such as Ogerpon with Defiant and Sinistcha are extremely beneficial.</p>"

High Attack gods like Necrozma-DM and Rayquaza are mandatory, as Rillaboom's base Attack is not enough to overwhelm cores. Teammates that can make use of Grassy Terrain like Sneasler, Hisuian Electrode, and Pecharunt are good partners, with Sneasler being able to activate Unburden, Hisuian Electrode gaining significant power on its Leaf Storm, and Pecharunt both taking less damage from Earthquake and gaining extra recovery while providing pivoting with Parting Shot. Pivots like Sandy Shocks, Hisuian Electrode, and Iron Moth that can pressure Grass-resistant foes make for great teammates, as they can pressure the few switch-ins to Rillaboom, especially Skarmory, Moltres, and Hydrapple, while also creating VoltTurn cores. Slow pivots like Slowking, Mandibuzz, and Pecharunt help Rillaboom switch in safely, allowing it more chances to wallbreak. Spikes setters like Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Sandy Shocks make for fantastic teammates, as they, in conjunction with Knock Off from Rillaboom or other teammates, considerably chip grounded foes who don't have Heavy-Duty Boots like Pecharunt, Necrozma-DM, and Tera Steel users like Slowking and Clodsire. Similarly, Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T, Clefable, and Necrozma-DM make for great teammates, with the former having U-turn and the latter two also having Knock Off to reduce the necessity for Rillaboom to use Knock Off itself.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Iron Hands is an extremely potent offensive threat that uses its impressive bulk to set up Swords Dance and sweep with a combination of its high base Attack, great STAB combination, and a Speed donation. Swords Dance allows Iron Hands to score 2HKOs on many defensive staples such as Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T and OHKO most offensive Pokemon. Drain Punch keeps Iron Hands healthy, and Thunder Punch hits many Flying-types like Ho-Oh, Corviknight, and Skarmory. Ice Punch gives Iron Hands a way to hit Ground- and Dragon-types such as Eternatus, Clodsire, and Landorus-T. Alternatively, a +2 Earthquake will 2HKO Galarian Slowking and reliably OHKO Zacian-C, as well as doing more damage to Eternatus and Clodsire than Ice Punch, but it leaves Iron Hands unable to cover Landorus-T. Close Combat and Supercell Slam both provide great damage, but the former reduces Iron Hands's defenses while the latter has the potential to deal significant recoil damage, both of which can make Iron Hands susceptible to early KOs. Booster Energy allows Iron Hands to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, greatly improving its ability to clean late game. It is worth noting that if Iron Hands receives Speed from Arceus, Booster Energy will boost Attack, not Speed. You can circumvent this by only giving Iron Hands 220 Attack EVs and putting the remaining EVs in Special Defense, but if you're receiving Speed from something slower than Arceus, redirecting Attack EVs will not be worth it. Tera Fire allows Iron Hands to more reliably take on Weavile, Hisuian Electrode, and Zacian-C while also giving it an immunity to burns. Tera Flying allows Iron Hands to dodge a Ground-type move and win a free turn to get in a crucial Swords Dance.</p> <p>Iron Hands likes receiving Speed from fast gods like Eternatus, Zacian-C, and even Arceus, and works well on the offensive teams these gods create. Iron Hands will have the easiest time cleaning after its checks have been sufficiently worn down, and to that end, it pairs well with offensive Knock Off users like Meowscarada, Hisuian Samurott, and Weavile; these Pokemon weaken their shared checks and importantly remove Leftovers, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Rocky Helmet from defensive Pokemon like Rotom-W, making it easier for Iron Hands to break through them later. Iron Hands also appreciates entry hazard support to wear down its checks further, such as Spikes from Meowscarada, Hisuian Samurott, and Ting-Lu or Stealth Rock from Great Tusk, Excadrill, and Iron Treads. Iron Hands is stopped in its tracks by Unaware users such as Clefable, Clodsire, and Skeledirge, so it appreciates strong wallbreakers such as Hisuian Electrode, Choice Specs Iron Valiant, and Choice Band Urshifu-S that can break through them.</p>"
