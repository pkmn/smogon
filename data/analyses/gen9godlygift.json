Thunderbolt provides a consistent source of damage, while Leaf Storm acts like a nuke against neutral targets and Ground-types looking to block Volt Switch such as Landorus. Tera Blast Ice nails Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon like Hydrapple and Eternatus for super effective damage, while Tera Blast Fire hits Zacian-C, Iron Treads, and specially defensive Excadrill. Volt Switch is Hisuian Electrode's most spammable move, allowing it to pivot out and maintain momentum against checks such as Kyurem-W and Galarian Slowking. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Hisuian Electrode to safely pivot on and off the field throughout the game.</p> <p>Hisuian Electrode best fits on teams looking for a strong, special attacking pivot. However, a high Special Attack god like Kyurem-W or Eternatus is required to allow it to actually make progress. Hisuian Electrode pairs well with other offensive pivots such as Landorus-T, Meowscarada, and Hisuian Samurott, as they can chip away at each other's checks. Meowscarada in particular is helpful, as Triple Axel nukes the aforementioned Grass- and Dragon-types that wall Hisuian Electrode, allowing it to comfortably run Tera Fire over Tera Ice. Alternatively, slower pivots such as Pecharunt, Corviknight, and Mandibuzz are helpful in bringing Hisuian Electrode onto the field safely, circumventing its relative frailty. Hisuian Electrode also appreciates powerful physical attackers such as Great Tusk and Weavile, as they are able to break special walls such as Eternatus and Galarian Slowking. Lastly, entry hazard setters like Skarmory, Clefable, and Landorus-T are helpful, as they let Hisuian Electrode's constant pivoting force chip damage onto its checks, allowing it to beat them long-term.</p>"

Choice Band combined with an Attack donation makes it extremely difficult to switch into. Knock Off and Triple Axel are mandatory, with Knock Off removing important items like Rocky Helmet, Leftovers, and Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Skarmory, Primarina, and Moltres. Ice Shard picks off weakened foes such as Hisuian Electrode and Choice Scarf Landorus. For the last moveslot, Low Kick allows Weavile to nail Pokemon such as Heatran and Archaludon with super effective damage, while Beat Up is useful with high-Attack teammates, being a consistent, non-contact move early-game. Tera Dark makes Knock Off even harder to manage and removes Weavile's weakness to Stealth Rock, while Tera Ice makes Triple Axel's damage output nuclear and improves Ice Shard's revenge killing potential.</p> <p>High-Attack gods like Necrozma-DM and Groudon are good fits for Weavile, as they are able to boost its damage by sizeable margins; in return, Weavile can break certain physical walls such as Zapdos and Great Tusk for them. Additionally, Groudon specifically is able to eliminate Steel-types for Weavile, which is especially useful for non-Low Kick variants. As Weavile is weak to Stealth Rock and still vulnerable to other entry hazards, hazard control from Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Hatterene, and Corviknight is important. In addition, though Weavile is powerful and fast, it is incredibly frail, thus necessitating pivots like Rotom-W, Pecharunt, and Landorus-T to bring it in safely. Pecharunt is especially useful, being able to switch into Fairy- and Fighting-type moves and threatening Fairy-types for Weavile. In return, Weavile eliminates Pokemon such as Reuniclus and Landorus that threaten Pecharunt. Weavile also appreciates powerful special attackers such as Landorus, Iron Moth, and Hisuian Electrode, as they are able to break physical walls such as Skarmory, Moltres, and Primarina. Landorus and Iron Moth are especially helpful in breaking Zacian-C, Weavile's toughest matchup.

Ice Shard serves as a way to pick off faster Pokemon like Electrode-H and Eternatus looking to outspeed and KO Weavile. Swords Dance enables Weavile to serve as a setup sweeper. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Weavile consistently switch in multiple times throughout the game and circumvent its weakness to Stealth Rock. Tera Ice boosts Triple Axel to nuclear levels while also strengthening Ice Shard, although Tera Dark is an acceptable alternative to empower Knock Off.</p> <p>High-Attack gods like Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Rayquaza are excellent fits for Weavile, as they are able to boost its damage by sizable margins, with Ho-Oh specifically eliminating Steel-types such as Zacian-C that Weavile struggles against; in return, Weavile can break certain physical walls such as Great Tusk and Mandibuzz for Ho-Oh. Also Weavile is still vulnerable to Stealth Rock and other entry hazards if it loses its Heavy-Duty Boots, making hazard control from Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Hatterene, and Corviknight important. Furthermore, Weavile is extremely frail; thus, slower pivots like Rotom-W, Pecharunt, and Galarian Slowking are appreciated to bring it in safely.

Landorus and Iron Moth are especially useful to threaten the previously mentioned Zacian-C, Weavile's toughest matchup.

Hydro Pump provides solid STAB damage to keep Rotom-W from being too passive and punishes Ground-types like Great Tusk and Iron Treads that can switch into Volt Switch. In the last two moveslots, Rotom-W can run any combination of Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, and Protect; Thunder Wave cripples Pokemon that rely on their Speed, like Weavile, Sneasler, and Zacian-C, while Will-O-Wisp neutralizes physical attackers like the previous three, as well as Calyrex-I, Iron Hands, and Rillaboom. Pain Split works better when receiving lower HP stats from gods such as Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C, as it heals more than when receiving HP from gods like Arceus and Eternatus, in which case it's better to use Protect to stall turns while Rotom-W regains HP from Leftovers. Tera Steel allows Rotom-W to defend against Grass-types like Rillaboom, Ogerpon, and Meowscarada, and being Steel-type with an immunity to Ground gives it a generally sound defensive typing. Leftovers is important because it provides Rotom-W with much needed recovery, as it lacks consistent healing options, so it needs to be careful switching into Pokemon with Knock Off like Weavile, Great Tusk, and Hisuian Samurott.</p> <p>Rotom-W fits well on offensive teams that can make full use of the momentum it creates while also typically playing shorter games, which gives opponents less time to exploit its lack of longevity. Rotom-W is able to switch into physical attackers such as Weavile, Hisuian Samurott, and Zamazenta and even some gods such as Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Calyrex-I and scare them out with the threat of Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave. Set Up Sweepers like Weavile, Ogerpon-W, and Landorus appreciate Rotom-W's ability to pivot them in safely while also crippling opposing wallbreakers with status effects. Rotom-W also creates free switch-ins for wallbreakers with more immediate power such as Choice Band Urshifu-S, Choice Band Rillaboom, and Power Herb Glimmora, which can KO bulky foes like Pecharunt, Hydrapple, and Clefable that Rotom-W and its teammates struggle with. Gods with high base HP stats, like Eternatus and Arceus, are ideal donors for sets using Protect, while gods with lower base HP stats like Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C are better for sets running Pain Split. Rotom-W struggles greatly with Grass-types so it's happiest alongside teammates that can reliably switch into them such as Heatran, Corviknight, and Galarian Slowking; the latter two have the additional benefit of U-turn and Chilly Reception, respectively, allowing them to form strong pivoting cores that excel at getting the right Pokemon onto the field.</p>"

Calm Mind grants Arceus-Fairy extra power and shores up its special bulk, and Recover lets it stay healthy and get more boosts off. Judgment is a strong STAB move that can score 2HKOs on common special walls such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Mandibuzz, while Earth Power allows Arceus-Fairy to hit Steel-types such as Excadrill, Heatran, and Zacian-C. The Speed EVs allow Arceus-Fairy to outspeed Ogerpon-W and unboosted Iron Moth and eventually beat them. Tera Ground gives Earth Power a little more power to OHKO Zacian-C at +1 after Stealth Rock and allows it to 2HKO Eternatus and physically defensive Clodsire, with the additional benefit of allowing Arceus-Fairy to resist Poison-type moves from the likes of Sneasler, Iron Moth, and Eternatus that would otherwise KO it.</p> <p>Arceus-Fairy has an amazing set of stats to donate, allowing it to build a very wide variety of teams around itself, but Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy works best on balance and bulky offense structures that can wear down the opposing team to prepare for Arceus-Fairy to finish them off. A multitude of Pokemon love to receive Arceus-Fairy's great HP stat, including but not limited to: Rotom-W, Pecharunt, and Landorus-T. Arceus-Fairy's high defensive stats also lend themselves to bulky pivots such as the aforementioned three Pokemon, which support Arceus-Fairy by getting it in safely. Hisuian Samurott and Meowscarada are great choices to receive Arceus-Fairy's Attack stat, as they provide Spikes, pivoting, and Knock Off support. Entry hazard setters such as the aforementioned Hisuian Samurott, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T help wear down specially defensive Pokemon so that Arceus-Fairy has a better shot at 2HKOing them later. Arceus-Fairy struggles to break bulky Pokemon such as Skarmory, Dondozo, and Ho-Oh, so it appreciates Pokemon that beat these walls, such as Ogerpon-W, Zapdos, and Iron Hands. Other special attackers like Hisuian Electrode and Hoopa-U can force in mutual checks such as Clodsire, Galarian Slowking, and specially defensive Excadrill and chip them so that Arceus-Fairy can overpower them with Calm Mind boosts further down the line, with Hisuian Electrode also being able to pivot with Volt Switch.</p>"

Thanks to an Attack donation, Hisuian Samurott gains a significant power boost, helping it capitalize on its STAB options to break through bulkier foes. Ceaseless Edge serves as Hisuian Samurott's most spammable move, while Razor Shell has the ability to break past opposing walls such as Mandibuzz thanks to the potential Defense drop. Knock Off provides great utility by removing items, especially Heavy-Duty Boots from pivots like Ogerpon and Zapdos, and serves as a strong spammable STAB option when paired with Tera Dark, while Flip Turn enables Hisuian Samurott to pivot and maintain momentum against Pokemon like Meowscarada and Zacian-C. Choice Scarf allows Hisuian Samurott to revenge kill effectively and maintain momentum against faster threats such as Lunala and Great Tusk.</p> <p>Gods with higher Attack such as Calyrex-I and Zacian-C are excellent choices for Hisuian Samurott, offering an Attack boost that enables it to break through bulkier foes more effectively. Alternatively, Arceus can be used, as it still offers an Attack increase while benefitting from Hisuian Samurott's ability to set up Spikes more. Due to Hisuian Samurott's relative frailty, defensive pivots such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Galarian Slowking are valuable teammates, giving it safe entry onto the field. Additionally, pairing Hisuian Samurott with strong special attackers like Iron Moth and Hisuian Electrode helps break through opposing physical walls that it might struggle against, such as Skarmory and Zamazenta. Furthermore, both Pokemon form a VoltTurn core with Hisuian Samurott, further weakening each other's checks. Other physical wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Iron Hands and Bulk Up Great Tusk can synergize well with Hisuian Samurott to overwhelm defensive checks such as Rotom-Wash. Finally, since much of Hisuian Samurott's value comes from its ability to set up Spikes, teammates that can deter or deny hazard removal such as Ogerpon with Defiant and Sinistcha are extremely beneficial.</p>"

Earth Power is Landorus's most reliable STAB move, while Sludge Wave serves as a consistent coverage option to nail targets such as Ogerpon-W and Hydrapple. Alternatively, Psychic hits Great Tusk and Zamazenta, as well as opposing Landorus. Focus Blast is a less accurate option to hit Pokemon such as Skarmory and Arceus. Lastly, Nasty Plot enables Landorus to act as a setup sweeper that can break through bulkier teams. Sheer Force synergizes well with Life Orb, granting Landorus's moves substantial boosts with no drawback. Tera Poison boosts the power of Sludge Wave, while Tera Steel is a generally good defensive Tera type that also allows Landorus to flip its weakness to Ice-type moves into a resistance. Tera Psychic can be used on sets running Psychic as a way to boost its damage output.</p> <p>Landorus appreciates Gods with decent Special Attack stats such as Kyurem-W and Eternatus to amplify its damage output. Kyurem-W notably breaks Water-types like Ogerpon-W thanks to Freeze-Dry as well as Flying-types like opposing Landorus-T and Mandibuzz that Landorus can struggle against, while Landorus beats Steel-types such as Zacian-C and Iron Crown in return. Also, Landorus's bulk is average at best; therefore, having bulky pivots such as Rotom-W and Pecharunt is appreciated. Rotom-W is especially helpful, switching into the Ice- and Water-type moves that Landorus is vulnerable to. Despite having a slightly above average Speed tier, Landorus can struggle against faster threats like Meowscarada, Weavile, and Ogerpon-W, making faster teammates such as Zamazenta and Speed Booster Energy Iron Moth, as well as Sticky Web support from Araquanid, much appreciated. Lastly, entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Skarmory is appreciated to chip foes into OHKO range while also disrupting Sturdy and Focus Sash.</p>"

Tera Ice lets Kyurem-W shed its weaknesses to Fairy and Dragon while also supercharging its Ice-type STAB moves; however, Tera Ground allows Kyurem-W to gain STAB on its only coverage move to further pressure the opposing team as well as give Kyurem-W a Stealth Rock resistance should it lose its Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <p>As a God, Kyurem-W donates a massive Special Attack stat that Pokemon such as Hisuian Electrode and Landorus appreciate. Hisuian Electrode also has an easier time threatening the Water-types that try to wall Kyurem-W such as Primarina and Dondozo while also utilizing its blistering base 150 Speed to threaten Pokemon that outspeed Kyurem-W. Kyurem-W is also able to donate a respectable base 125 HP stat to Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Hatterene that appreciate the massive increase in bulk. Landorus-T can threaten Steel-types such as Iron Crown and Necrozma-DM, while Hatterene is especially useful, as it can easily tank Fighting- and Dragon-type attacks aimed at Kyurem-W. Furthermore, Rotom-W and Landorus-T can both provide pivoting to allow Kyurem-W to hit the field without fear of being worn down by incoming attacks. Despite Kyurem-W's middling base 95 Speed stat, Pokemon such as Iron Hands and Reuniclus are grateful to be able to outspeed a lot of the common walls. Faster Pokemon such as Sneasler and Iron Moth can also help alleviate Kyurem-W's lackluster Speed stat while also threatening Fairy-types such as Primarina and Arceus-Fairy. Lastly, Kyurem-W slots best into the Defense or Speed slot, as both are its weakest stats to offer to its teammates. Which one Kyurem-W should slot in is highly dependent on whether it is paired with the likes of Galarian Slowking and Primarina, which would appreciate the Defense, or Iron Hands, which would appreciate the Speed.</p>"

Sticky Web disrupts frailer offensive Pokemon as well as Speed Booster Energy Pokemon like Iron Hands and Iron Moth. Moonblast nails the aforementioned Great Tusk and Iron Hands while also acting as a consistent damage source. Psychic Noise hits Poison-types such as Pecharunt and Iron Moth but more importantly denies recovery from Pokemon like Rest Dondozo and Recover Clodsire. Stun Spore slows down and cripples foes including Flying-types and Pokemon holding Heavy-Duty Boots, which ignores Sticky Web Speed drops. On the other hand, Skill Swap allows Ribombee to set up Sticky Web on Hatterene as well as temporarily remove important abilities such as Regenerator. Shield Dust allows Ribombee to avoid secondary effects such as Salt Cure from Garganacl and Malignant Chain from Pecharunt, which, combined with Focus Sash, nearly always guarantees it two turns on the field to set up Sticky Web, do damage with Moonblast or Psychic Noise, or paralyze a foe. While Ribombee should rarely Terastallize, Tera Ghost allows it to spinblock Pokemon like Iron Treads in a pinch.</p> <p>Ribombee should typically be placed in a dump slot that no teammate really wants.

Sticky Web also lets faster wallbreakers such as Iron Moth, Zamazenta, Roaring Moon, and Ogerpon-W to forgo a Speed-boosting nature for increased damage. Roaring Moon and Ogerpon-W are especially useful, as they offer strong Knock Offs to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from faster threats such as Iron Treads, Hisuian Electrode, and Eternatus, allowing Ribombee's slower teammates to overwhelm them. Since Ribombee's value lies almost entirely in Sticky Web, Ghost-types such as Pecharunt, Sinistcha, and Arceus-Ghost, which can block Rapid Spin, are incredibly important, while Pokemon that can deter Defog such as Ogerpon and Enamorus should also be considered.</p>"

Knock Off weakens answers like Skarmory, Slowking, and Rotom-W long-term in conjunction with entry hazards, especially Spikes.

While Weakness Policy is the preferred item, Lum Berry is a more consistent option that reduces the need for Tera Fire to avoid burns. Tera Fire is the main Tera type used, enabling Tera Blast if chosen, letting Necrozma-DM avoid burns entirely, and providing it with a more exploitable type for Weakness Policy activation. Tera Ground, on the other hand, boosts Earthquake's damage significantly while also being a good neutrally defensive typing at the cost of noticeably worse synergy with Weakness Policy.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM fits best on teams lacking a consistent setup sweeper and answer to bulky teams, ranging from hyper offense to bulky balance. Necrozma-DM is best played paired with a strong wallbreaker in the Attack slot like Rillaboom, Weavile, or Maushold, as it can accentuate their damage to absurd levels. If a more defensive route is chosen, teammates like Clefable, Slowking, and Landorus-T fit exceptionally well as Defense receivers, providing useful tools like Knock Off utility and pivoting, while Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Tornadus-T, and Skeledirge are great special walls thanks to their access to utility moves like Spikes and Knock Off or anti-setup options. If a more offensive route is chosen, teammates that enjoy extra bulk like Roaring Moon, Sneasler, Primarina, Great Tusk, and Hatterene are great, as Necrozma-DM can give them more opportunities to switch in and set up. Leads like Araquanid, Glimmora, and Grimmsnarl enjoy the offensive or defensive stat donations respectively gifted by Necrozma-DM to either deal more damage or set up entry hazards or dual screens more often and consistently. Entry hazard setters like Sandy Shocks, Great Tusk, and Clefable all enable Necrozma-DM by allowing it to pressure counters like Skarmory, Rotom-W, and Ho-Oh. especially in conjunction with Knock Off for the latter; they also further support it with high-power STAB moves like Thunderbolt and Close Combat or via other utility moves like Knock Off. While Necrozma-DM is incredibly strong, it is incredibly slow and gifts a low Speed stat. Thus, it requires teammates that can fill the role of speed control like Zamazenta, Rillaboom, Unburden Pokemon like Sneasler, Choice Scarf users like the Urshifu formes, and Booster Energy Speed users like Great Tusk and Iron Valiant to handle faster threats like Hisuian Electrode, Eternatus, and Speed slot Iron Hands. Necrozma-DM can also struggle against Pokemon like Ho-Oh, Foul Play Mandibuzz, Iron Defense Skarmory, and Tera Dark or Curse Dondozo, so teammates that can remove or cripple these threats like Ogerpon-W, Iron Boulder, and Zapdos are greatly appreciated.</p>"

Grassy Glide provides Rillaboom with speed control, threatening faster Pokemon like Ogerpon-C, Ogerpon-W, Weavile, and Bulk Up Great Tusk alongside some potential prior chip damage. U-turn lets Rillaboom make progress by forcing in counters like Skarmory and Pecharunt for another teammate to pressure. Tera Grass boosts the damage of Wood Hammer and Grassy Glide to absurd levels, giving Rillaboom the ability to 2HKO physically bulky Grass-resistant foes like Necrozma-DM and Mandibuzz with Wood Hammer and OHKO Ogerpon-W, Iron Valiant, and Great Tusk with Grassy Glide.</p> <p>Choice Band Rillaboom best fits on offense and balance teams looking for a strong wallbreaker with priority. High Attack gods like Necrozma-DM and Rayquaza are mandatory, as Rillaboom's base Attack is not enough to overwhelm cores. Teammates that can make use of Grassy Terrain like Sneasler, Hisuian Electrode, and Pecharunt are good partners, with Sneasler being able to activate Unburden, Hisuian Electrode gaining significant power on its Leaf Storm, and Pecharunt both taking less damage from Earthquake and gaining extra recovery while providing pivoting with Parting Shot. Pivots like Sandy Shocks, Hisuian Electrode, and Iron Moth that can pressure Grass-resistant foes make for great teammates, as they can pressure the few switch-ins to Rillaboom, especially Skarmory, Moltres, and Hydrapple, while also creating VoltTurn cores. Slow pivots like Slowking, Mandibuzz, and Pecharunt help Rillaboom switch in safely, allowing it more chances to wallbreak. Spikes setters like Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Sandy Shocks make for fantastic teammates, as they, in conjunction with Knock Off from Rillaboom or other teammates, considerably chip grounded foes who don't have Heavy-Duty Boots like Pecharunt, Necrozma-DM, and Tera Steel users like Slowking and Clodsire. Similarly, Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T, Clefable, and Necrozma-DM make for great teammates, with the former having U-turn and the latter two also having Knock Off to reduce the necessity for Rillaboom to use Knock Off itself.</p>"

Crunch hits the Ghost-types immune to Body Press such as Gholdengo and Pecharunt. Lastly, Roar allows Zamazenta to force out boosted Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM as well as prevent opposing phazers like Whirlwind Ting-Lu and Skarmory from forcing it out, while Rest alongside Chesto Berry allows Zamazenta to heal itself while ridding it of burns and paralysis.

In return, Zamazenta is able to switch in on and threaten Pokemon like Weavile, Ting-Lu, and Iron Treads, which can be annoying for the aforementioned gods to deal with. However, Zamazenta prefers some support of its own, as despite having Crunch, it can struggle against Ghost-types like Pecharunt and Sinistcha due to its relatively mediocre Attack. Thus, Dark- and Ghost-types like Weavile, Lokix, and Arceus-Ghost are appreciated. Furthermore, although Fairy-types are not immune to Body Press, they resist all of Zamazenta's attacks, making Pokemon like Primarina, Clefable, and Arceus-Fairy extremely annoying. Clefable is especially troublesome, with Unaware ignoring the boosts from Iron Defense and Dauntless Shield. Thus, Poison- and Steel-types like Pecharunt, the aforementioned Eternatus, Necrozma-DM, and Attack-boosted Tinkaton are welcome. The latter two are especially valuable, as they resist all of the moves that Zamazenta is weak to.</p>"

With a Speed donation, Urshifu-S is able to threaten out a lot of frail Pokemon that it wouldn't otherwise. Urshifu-S can choose to inherit in the Attack slot, becoming far stronger, but it prefers the Speed slot because it is relatively slow, it already has high Attack, and Attack-inheriting sets are more awkward to fit onto teams. In terms of moves, Wicked Blow and Close Combat are mandatory. U-turn allows Urshifu-S to generate momentum off the many switches it can force. Poison Jab is great at threatening Fairy-types such as physically defensive Clefable and Primarina, while Sucker Punch is a viable alternative to provide speed control in a pinch, and it is preferred when inheriting from gods slower than Eternatus. Tera Dark is preferred to further boost damage on Wicked Blow and Sucker Punch, allowing Urshifu-S to OHKO fully invested Arceus-Ghost. Tera Poison boosts Poison Jab to achieve a 2HKO on Arceus-Fairy and Clefable with base 115 Defense and it is a good defensive Tera for Urshifu-S. Finally, Tera Fighting boosts the damage of Close Combat.</p> <p>Zacian-C and Eternatus are excellent gods for Urshifu-S to inherit from. Zacian-C appreciates having a strong offensive wallbreaking partner to overwhelm shared checks such as Clodsire and Skarmory, while Eternatus provides Urshifu-S with a partner that can inherit great Special Attack such as Hisuian Electrode or Landorus, taking advantage of the physically defensive walls Urshifu-S invites in and being a solid progress maker itself. Finally, Arceus is rarely a bad choice of a god, and Urshifu-S fits comfortably onto Arceus structures as a fast wallbreaker. Urshifu-S is quite frail, so it appreciates having solid defensive pieces, like Clodsire and Skarmory, to swap into powerful attacks it cannot take itself—especially Fairy-type attacks. Pokemon like Landorus-T, Pecharunt, and Rotom-W can bring Urshifu-S in safely by forming a VoltTurn core with it so it doesn't have to worry about using its middling bulk to hit the field. These three in particular can take on Zacian-C and Zamazenta, two Pokemon Urshifu-S cannot usually beat. Urshifu-S also likes to be paired with physical attackers that can clean easily, like Sneasler, that benefit greatly from the holes it punches in the opposing team. Finally, entry hazard support from the likes of Hisuian Samurott, Great Tusk, Glimmora, and so forth isn't necessarily mandatory but helps Urshifu-S secure key rolls against walls, such as HP-inheriting Skarmory and physically defensive Primarina.</p>"

Swords Dance allows Iron Hands to score 2HKOs on many defensive staples such as Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T and OHKO most offensive Pokemon. Drain Punch keeps Iron Hands healthy, and Thunder Punch hits many Flying-types like Ho-Oh, Corviknight, and Skarmory. Ice Punch gives Iron Hands a way to hit Ground- and Dragon-types such as Eternatus, Clodsire, and Landorus-T. Alternatively, a +2 Earthquake will 2HKO Galarian Slowking and reliably OHKO Zacian-C, as well as doing more damage to Eternatus and Clodsire than Ice Punch, but it leaves Iron Hands unable to cover Landorus-T. Close Combat and Supercell Slam both provide great damage, but the former reduces Iron Hands's defenses while the latter has the potential to deal significant recoil damage, both of which can make Iron Hands susceptible to early KOs. Booster Energy allows Iron Hands to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, greatly improving its ability to clean late game. It is worth noting that if Iron Hands receives Speed from Arceus, Booster Energy will boost Attack, not Speed. You can circumvent this by only giving Iron Hands 220 Attack EVs and putting the remaining EVs in Special Defense, but if you're receiving Speed from something slower than Arceus, redirecting Attack EVs will not be worth it. Tera Fire allows Iron Hands to more reliably take on Weavile, Hisuian Electrode, and Zacian-C while also giving it an immunity to burns. Tera Flying allows Iron Hands to dodge a Ground-type move and win a free turn to get in a crucial Swords Dance.</p> <p>Iron Hands likes receiving Speed from fast gods like Eternatus, Zacian-C, and even Arceus, and works well on the offensive teams these gods create. Iron Hands will have the easiest time cleaning after its checks have been sufficiently worn down, and to that end, it pairs well with offensive Knock Off users like Meowscarada, Hisuian Samurott, and Weavile; these Pokemon weaken their shared checks and importantly remove Leftovers, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Rocky Helmet from defensive Pokemon like Rotom-W, making it easier for Iron Hands to break through them later. Iron Hands also appreciates entry hazard support to wear down its checks further, such as Spikes from Meowscarada, Hisuian Samurott, and Ting-Lu or Stealth Rock from Great Tusk, Excadrill, and Iron Treads. Iron Hands is stopped in its tracks by Unaware users such as Clefable, Clodsire, and Skeledirge, so it appreciates strong wallbreakers such as Hisuian Electrode, Choice Specs Iron Valiant, and Choice Band Urshifu-S that can break through them.</p>"

Earthquake can OHKO Steel-types such as Zacian-C, Heatran, and Iron Treads while also hitting Iron Hands super effectively. Tera Flying boosts the power of Acrobatics, notably allowing Roaring Moon to OHKO uninvested Great Tusk before a Dragon Dance and Dauntless Shield Zamazenta after a Dragon Dance. Alternatively, Tera Ground boosts the power of Earthquake, allowing Roaring Moon to OHKO Eternatus and offensive Iron Hands. Roost can also be an option instead of Acrobatics on Tera Ground sets, as the longevity it provides pairs well with Roaring Moon's bulk and the defensive utility of the Ground typing. The Adamant nature maximizes Roaring Moon's Attack; however, Roaring Moon can instead run an EV spread of 36 HP / 220 Atk / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature to cause Protosynthesis to boost Speed instead, sacrificing power so that it can act as a revenge killer.</p> <p>Roaring Moon can receive the Defense of gods such as Arceus-Ghost, Necrozma-DM, and Eternatus, so it can use its great mixed bulk to reliably set up Dragon Dance. However, Roaring Moon's offensive stats are already great naturally, so it can function fine in any slot, allowing something else to use the Defense donation. Roaring Moon is vulnerable to priority users that can hit it super effectively, so it appreciates Pokemon like Heatran, Zamazenta, and Iron Valiant, which cover Lokix, and others such as Zacian-C, Excadrill, and Iron Crown, which cover Comfey. Roaring Moon also struggles to beat Unaware users such as Clefable and Dondozo, so it appreciates the presence of strong special attackers like Hisuian Electrode and Choice Specs Volcanion, which can KO them or put them in range to be KOed by Roaring Moon. Roaring Moon has an easier time scoring KOs with entry hazard support, so it appreciates Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Skarmory. Roaring Moon, in return, increases the effectiveness of hazards by removing Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Pecharunt can cause a massive headache with the ability to not only be bulkier than it normally is but also to power itself up by spreading status while empowering its Hex. Toxic is a guaranteed way for Pecharunt to spread status, while Malignant Chain allows it to circumvent being Taunted and gives it a Poison-type STAB move at the cost of overall PP, with both synergizing well with Hex. Parting Shot allows Pecharunt to pivot to other teammates with ease while weakening whatever foe it faces. Pecharunt's Tera type is a bit team dependent, but both Water and Fairy provide general defensive capabilities to allow Pecharunt to pull off a well-timed Recover or Parting Shot. Heavy-Duty Boots is the item of choice, mainly so Pecharunt doesn't take chip damage when pivoting with Parting Shot.</p> <p>Pecharunt can fit into almost any slot, but mainly the HP or Special Defense slot. Gods such as Kyurem-W, Ho-Oh, and Arceus all provide the aforementioned stats for Pecharunt to utilize; more specifically, Ho-Oh and Arceus with Will-O-Wisp are useful, as they can help Pecharunt's Hex hit harder with their own status moves. Special walls such as Ting-Lu and Corviknight complement Pecharunt's ability to take on almost any physical attacker. More specifically, Ting-Lu can take the Ghost- and Dark-type attacks aimed at Pecharunt from the likes of Hoopa-U and Darkrai. Steel-types such as Zacian-C, Skarmory, and Iron Treads can take next to nothing from Pecharunt thanks to being immune to Toxic, which in turn neuters Hex's overall power and gives them the opportunity to either set up a sweep or entry hazards. That is why Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Heatran are great partners to help aid in wearing down the aforementioned Steel-types, with the former two providing a Ground-type immunity.</p>"
