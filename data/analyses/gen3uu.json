  "Blastoise": {
    "overview": "<p>Blastoise is really useful in UU and should be kept alive as long as possible to keep dangerous Pokemon like Nidoking and Sandslash from sweeping your team. Wish support is not a bad idea, but is hard to pull off, so if you're really insecure about keeping his HP stable I recommend you use Sleep Talk. The longer Blastoise lasts, the more time your other Pokemon have to find a hole in your opponent's team. You would probably use him like you would use your bulky Water-type in standard play.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mirror Coat will kill Manectric, Lanturn, Electabuzz and anything else that sends a Thunderbolt at you. The only way it will catch Jolteon is if you also have Earthquake, otherwise it'll just Substitute. Counter works well if Fearow, Tauros or some other physical attacker is trying to take you on one on one, however you're better off using Surf or Ice Beam against all these Rocks and Grounds in UU.</p> <p>Hydro Pump is a more powerful alternative to Surf, but 80% accuracy is less than ideal. Earthquake hits aforementioned Electrics, but not very hard because Blastoise's Attack is average at best, and you probably don't want to stack it to keep your physical walling ability. Hidden Power Electric puts a dent in Mantine; Hidden Power Grass helps against Quagsire, but won't really come handy most of the time. Blastoise can Substitute and Focus Punch but it's not useful at all in UU.</p> <p>Haze and Roar work against Baton Passers and against Reversal / Flail Pokemon to an extent, but is not recommended in UU. Protect keeps Solrock from opening a hole in your team with Explosion and can work in conjunction with Counter or Mirror Coat to check what your opponent can do. Yawn is a fun move: lay down some Spikes beforehand for better results. Toxic is always fun to toy around with, you will be able to poison other Water types, and the standard Electric switches aren't fond of it either.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Blastoise needs max HP with plenty of Defense EVs. A Bold nature would help too. Blastoise tend to run around 200 Speed nowadays to get the first strike on Solrock and company before they Explode, and it's always nice to outrun those Sunnybeaming Grasses you will see in UU.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Lanturn resists Surf and hits hard with STAB Electric attacks. Muk's high Special Defense makes it an easy switch in against non-Earthquake versions; Clefable and Slowking also give him trouble. Poliwrath is especially dangerous, because it has Water Absorb, and can Belly Drum on you, unless you have something strange like Hidden Power Grass, or use Roar / Haze.</p>",
    "sets": {"Standard": {"description": "<p>Easy to bring in against many UU teams: Gligar, Sandslash and Solrock are just some examples. Use Sleep Talk if you are lacking something to absorb sleep, but beware that the most common sleepers in UU are Grass-types that can put a hurting in Blastoise. It's mostly useful to keep Blastoise alive and to surprise things like Gligar that try to set up on you while you're sleeping.</p> <p>If you don't want Sleep Talk, you can use Rapid Spin if you're afraid of Spikes. Rapid Spinning against Substitute Qwilfish is not a good idea, so it's a better idea to bring in something to take care of Qwilfish first, and get rid of the Spikes later. Toxic ruins a Lanturn that doesn't carry Rest, as well as several other Waters and Electrics that tend to come in on Blastoise.</p>"}}

  "Raichu": {
    "overview": "<p>Can be a threat to standard teams if your opponent doesn't happen to have Celebi, as it hits about any standard wall quite hard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thief can grab Leftovers from Blissey and Snorlax. Charm can be annoying for Curselax and Swampert. Volt Tackle can give you some extra power, but it can't be used with Surf.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>233 Attack with Focus Punch to 2HKO Blissey in standard. 299 makes you tie with most Salamence for Speed, and 328 makes you faster than stuff like Modest Gengar and the like. Put leftover EVs in Special Attack. When not using Focus Punch, just make sure to max Special Attack for maximal sweeping power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In standard, Venusaur and Celebi can come in easily on Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Grass, Surf and Focus Punch, taking nil damage thanks to Leftovers and Recover, Leech Seed and / or Synthesis. Even Hidden Power Ice doesn't do that much. Dusclops with around 360 Special Defense can take quite a few Thunderbolts from Raichu if it can Pain Split or Rest in time, and is immune to Focus Punch, while Hidden Powers and Surf don't do much damage. Blissey, Snorlax and Regice must avoid Focus Punch at all costs, so they cannot come in effectively on a Substitute Raichu either, but the rest of its moves don't do much at all. Snorlax might even be able to come in on Substitute and Curse up and come out on top, but beware of Raichu using Encore.</p> <p>Grounds can be used for countering Raichu to an extent. Flygon needs to beware of Hidden Power Ice, and doesn't take Focus Punches too lightly (especially if Flygon is Choice Banded and thus lacks Leftovers recovery), but makes an excellent counter nonetheless because of a guaranteed OHKO with its STAB Earthquake. Claydol is immune to Thunderbolt and resists Focus Punch, but is 3HKOed by Surf and almost 4HKOed by Hidden Power Grass or Ice. It is hard for Raichu to get around Claydol though, since Raichu will have to predict it switching in every time. Donphan is easier to beat but is still a hindrance; it takes nearly no damage from Focus Punch thanks to its high Defense, but Surf and Hidden Power will 2HKO him. Swampert is 2HKOed by Hidden Power Grass, but every other attack does absolutely nothing to it.</p> <p>In UnderUsed, Camerupt can be almost completely disregarded as a counter because of Surf. Vileplume and Meganium, much like Venusaur and Celebi, take nearly no damage from Focus Punch and Thunderbolt and can shrug it off with Leech Seed and Synthesis. They should watch out a little more for Hidden Power Ice, though. Quagsire and Whiscash do the same job as Swampert: countering any variant not using Hidden Power Grass with no trouble at all. That's why Vileplume or Meganium combined with Quagsire or Whiscash walls any Raichu available. Sandslash and Gligar do the same as Donphan here: being 2HKOed by Surf (and in Sandslash' case, Hidden Power) doesn't cut it, but easily take Focus Punch and Thunderbolt for breakfast. Hypno and Grumpig, the standard special walls of UU, do quite nicely at taking anything Raichu throws at them, though Grumpig has no Wish like Hypno does, so it will get worn down quickly. A sweeping Grumpig doesn't like to get Thunder Waved either.</p> <p>In general, attacking Raichu straight on is a good idea if it doesn't OHKO you. It's very fragile and weak to the most common attacking move in the game (Earthquake), and it often uses Substitute to see what you're going to do. Just switching out if it comes in on your non-attacking move is handy as well, since it is probably going to use Encore.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Encore": {
        "description": "<p>Raichu is one of the fastest Encorers in the game. In standard, play it as follows: come in on a non-attacking move coming from a slower Pokemon and Encore it, then predict what your opponent is going to do. If Blissey, Snorlax or Regice are coming in, Focus Punch on the switch. If you think Swampert is coming, Hidden Power Grass it on the switch--it will not OHKO though. If you're insecure about prediction, use Substitute after Encoring, and handle from there. However, it's recommended to use Hidden Power Grass if your skills allow it, because Swampert is on nearly every team and it greatly hinders Raichu's sweeping potential.</p> <p>For UU play, Focus Punch probably won't come handy, as Thunderbolt will 2HKO Aggron and Clefable is rare, and not much else weak to Fighting is around, besides Golem who you can OHKO with Hidden Power Grass. Therefore, the EVs suggested are for standard play. A guaranteed 2HKO on Blissey with Focus Punch, and enough Speed to outspeed all Heracross.</p>"
      },
      "Special Sweeper with Focus Punch": {"description": "<p>Use this set with Substitute and Hidden Power Grass in UU to get quite a threatening sweeper. Surf is the main reason to use it over Manectric, because it 2HKOs Gligar and OHKOs Camerupt. Only use Hidden Power Ice in standard for Flygon and Salamence (usually doesn't OHKO), because you need Hidden Power Grass in UU for Quagsire. Like with the first set, if you smell a standard Special wall coming, Focus Punch it.</p> <p>When using Focus Punch, use the EVs suggested on the first set. Otherwise, use these. Timid Raichu ties with Jolly Fearow, Dodrio, Linoone and anything else with 100 base Speed and a +Speed nature. Modest ties with the same Pokemon, except with Adamant versions. You'll usually outspeed Salamence as well as the rare Charizard. Use the IVs suggested when using Hidden Power Ice in standard, having absolute max Speed is important.</p>"},
      "Wish": {"description": "<p>Raichu can force switches easily, being an Electric-type. Predict this, Wish, and switch to whatever counters what they sent in. It can stay alive against Blissey by Wishing and then Substituting. Wish prevents it from using Surf, so you are stuck using Hidden Power.</p>"},
      "Reversal": {"description": "<p>OHKOs Blissey and other normal friends and is a nice surprise. They might think you are whittling down yourself to get a Petaya Boost, so take advantage of their surprise. Watch out for Venusaur and Dusclops. Unfortunately, Surf cannot be used in tandem with Reversal. Not really recommended in either UU or standard: in standard Tyranitar messes you up, and in UU there's a lot of Quick Attack and similar moves around.</p>"}

  "Nidoqueen": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoking is usually better suited for your competitive needs because his higher Speed and offenses, in addition to Megahorn, make it a lot easier to pulverize opposing teams. However, Nidoqueen is much better at using Counter due to higher sturdiness. Because of this tankish nature, Nidoqueen is also better at using the nice resistances given to the Poison / Ground typing, but still you should be wary of these nasty weaknesses to Earthquake, Psychic, Ice Beam, and Surf.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter is an awesome move on Nidoqueen, since she usually survives even STAB Earthquakes if she has a defensive EV spread. Charm can be annoying as hell for physical switch-ins like Fearow, Snorlax or any Ground. Roar Nidoqueen can be used for teams based around Baton Pass and it can easily Roar away Ninjask or Scizor as well. Nidoqueen is defensive enough to pull off a Rest / Sleep Talk set, but it's better to use her outstanding versatility. Substitute helps against Weezing if it's not running Flamethrower or Fire Blast.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass 2HKOes SwaQuagsire and Whiscash, but you should be using it on the switch or they will KO you with Earthquake, Surf or Hydro Pump. Use Crunch if you're using a Nidoqueen that's focused on Special Attack (though that's not recommended as it lacks STAB); it will damage Solrock and Misdreavus badly.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>If you want to OHKO max HP Gligar with Ice Beam guaranteed, you need 200 Special Attack. The main sets should have offensive spreads like suggested, but if you're using Counter or just want a more sturdy Nidoqueen, I recommend using 252 HP / 140 Attack / 36 Defense / 80 Speed with Adamant nature (when not using any special attacks). With this, you survive STAB Earthquakes from the likes of Sandslash. This means you'll be easily living through Nidoking, non-Swords Danced Gligar and any non-STAB Earthquake.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Nidoqueen is versatile, but since its attacking stats are on the low side it doesn't hurt much if it's not dealing STAB or super effective damage.</p> <p>It's mostly Waters and Grounds that Nidoqueen fears. Politoed, Slowking, and Blastoise take on non-Choice Banded Nidoqueen easily, though they may get worn down after a while. If Nidoqueen is not using Hidden Power Grass, Quagsire and Whiscash are failsafe counters in the same way. Poliwrath usually doesn't run Earthquake or a Water move, but if it does it's a good Nidoqueen counter as well.</p> <p>Sandslash takes Ice Beam even worse than Donphan does, so it's only good as an early game counter that shouldn't switch into Ice Beam, and preferably not into Earthquakes either. Watch out for Sludge Bomb's Poison chance, too, as well as the rare Hidden Power Grass. Gligar can come in with some prediction to avoid Ice Beam, but it cannot OHKO Nidoqueen with Earthquake when Nidoqueen is at (near) full health, so just use it as a finisher. It will get OHKOed by most Ice Beaming Nidoqueen. Solrock, Misdreavus and Lunatone are immune to Earthquake and resist Sludge Bomb, so as long as they don't eat a Shadow Ball they're good counters. Solrock can even set up a Reflect to avoid too much damage. Solrock can Earthquake Nidoqueen (watch out for Counter), Misdreavus can Perish Trap or Calm Mind up, Lunatone can Calm Mind up and use Ice Beam / Psychic.</p>",
    "sets": {"Standard": {"description": "<p>The standard Nidoking set, applied to Nidoqueen.

  "Nidoking": {
    "overview": "<p>A great movepool that makes him beyond excellent in UU. There's very few surefire counters for Nidoking, especially in the UU environment. He can always surprise you and kill one of the key elements of your team. However, he can be rather hard to bring in due to his common weaknesses to Surf, Ice Beam, Psychic, and Earthquake, and will always have a problem taking down sturdy Water-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nidoking can use Counter on Choice Banders like Fearow, on walls like Solrock or even on Grounds like Quagsire and Sandslash. It does work nicely, but Nidoking is usually better off at attacking straight up. Toxic and Thief can help in wearing down opponents, but once again Nidoking is better off ramming things instead of stalling them out.</p> <p>Thunder does more damage to Waters than Thunderbolt if it hits and it has a high Paralysis chance, but in the long run Thunderbolt's accuracy is better. Roar can help you against UU Baton Passers, but those are rare. Hidden Power Grass is fun on Nidoking to hit Quagsire for a surprise.</p> <p>Rest and Sleep Talk are always a nice option on Pokemon that can take a hit or two. Nidoking can absorb a Sleep from a Grass-type nicely and then surprise them with Sludge Bomb, but it does hurt his great versatility. Protect is nice to scout for Earthquakes, Explosions, and Choice Banded moves, and helps for Leftovers recovery.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>If you're using Counter on Nidoking, more defensive EVs are suggested. With 88 HP and 28 Defense EVs, you can survive a Gligar Earthquake (as long as he doesn't have an Adamant nature). Nidoking needs 200 Special Attack (the stat, not the amount of EVs) to OHKO Gligar. If you're using a -Special Attack nature (Adamant, for example), you need 68 EVs to reach that. However, without that, Nidoking already has 206 Special Attack, so there's no need to stack it any more. Generally you'll want to focus on Attack to put a little strength behind his Earthquakes, while his Special moves should be designed to kill specific threats like Gligar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Your options are limited. Quagsire, Whiscash, Politoed, Poliwrath, Walrein, and Blastoise work as counters in the same way as the Waters from standard: they do not like Choice Band Earthquakes, and Quagsire and Whiscash do not like Hidden Power Grass, but they take the hits from any of his other moves rather well. Poliwrath, Whiscash, and Quagsire may be better off using Earthquake instead of Surf or Hydro Pump to counter Nidoking.</p> <p>Solrock and Lunatone should beware of Megahorn or Shadow Ball, and Grounds like Sandslash and Gligar cannot take Ice Beam, but if these moves are not present they are great counters.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {"description": "<p>The best UU set for Nidoking. One of the greatest threats to Nidoking is Gligar, and Ice Beam takes care of him. Shadow Ball takes care of Misdreavus, Megahorn beats Grass and Psychic Pokemon, and Earthquake gets STAB. The absence of Thunderbolt allows for a better EV distribution; Water Pokemon for the most part will take more damage from STAB Earthquake than non-STAB Thunderbolt. Give this one max Speed--it's essential for taking on Gligar that want to switch in on your Earthquake.</p>"},

As with a lot of Choice Banders, depending on your and your opponent's prediction skills you could be totally messing something up or doing nothing to them at all. Earthquake should take care of Quagsire and other Water friends in 2 or 3 hits, Megahorn kills Solrock and Lunatone and puts quite a big hurting into Meganium, and Rock Slide is for Fliers like Fearow and Scyther. Sludge Bomb may seem handy for STAB, and Ice Beam catches Gligar.</p>"}

  "Clefable": {
    "overview": "<p>Clefable is really unpredictable and that's where its strength lies. There are zero safe counters for him. However, once its set is found out, its average stats across the board will cause difficulties in damaging things effectively. All sets are quite viable for UU play.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Blast as a more powerful option over Flamethrower. Psychic is for Fighting-types. Reflect is a great move to support your team with and can work in tandem with Counter. Safeguard supports, too, but to a lesser extent. Sing can catch any Clefable counter with a quick Sleep, and can help you set up Calm Mind or Belly Drum. Snatch can get you a Substitute, Calm Mind, Recover, Soft-Boiled, Aromatherapy or Dragon Dance, as long as you're good at predicting. It's a novelty move though. Wish can be considered an option over Soft-Boiled most of the time, Clefable is an above average Wisher. It might be wise to use Protect with it, which can also check what a Choice Bander is going to do, it can help your Leftovers recovery and it saves you from Explosion.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Depends completely on the set, and there's still no strict way of doing them. Using the Magic Stat Numbers article gives you an idea what you can use for EVs on Clefable. Stick with what's given on the sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Countering Clefable safely is hard; you'll usually have to use a combination of Pokemon. Any Pokemon with Rest stalls out the Toxic staller. Steel and Poison-types work as well, though Weezing and the Steels should beware of Fire moves.</p> <p>Generally, powerful offense, Toxic, and Leech Seed stop Clefable. It often has to use Soft-Boiled, so use that to switch in a counter easily.</p> <p>Quagsire does about as well as Swampert and counters it under the same conditions. Hypno can Toxic or Thunder Wave Clefable and wall it, though Choice Band Clefable or generally Shadow Baller can hurt, and Hypno doesn't enjoy Toxic itself. Some offense from Aggron or Fearow can hurt Clefable a lot, but beware of Counter.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Belly Drum": {"description": "<p>Belly Drumming Clefable is quite fun, but not too good since after a Belly Drum its Attack is only 1048. Clefable is also quite slow which makes it hard to take advantage of its super high Attack, so make sure to paralyze some sweepers beforehand, or do it yourself with Thunder Wave. Even if you aren't able to find an opportunity to use Belly Drum, you can still get some random Attack boosts by using Meteor Mash if you picked that. Cosmic Power is an option as well to make this set more tankish: basically you Cosmic Power until you're not taking much damage from the opponent, use Soft-Boiled to recover the damage, Belly Drum up, and start hitting things. If you come across a Ghost or something that can kill you in the long run, Soft-Boiled to full HP, then switch out to come back later and try again.</p>"},
      "Calm Mind + BoltBeam": {"description": "<p>Standard Calm Mind Clefable, Ice Beam and Thunderbolt are only resisted by Magneton, Lanturn, and Shedinja. It doesn't do much against good Special sponges either. This Clefable's greatest enemy is Toxic. You can Rest it off, but expect to get hit hard physically then by Fearow or Aggron, for example. You can toy around with the EVs: more Special Defense means Calm Mind will make your Special Defense absolutely impregnable by Manectric or other Special Attackers, more Defense means you will get great defenses on both sides, and more Special Attack means you will have more firepower.</p>"},
      "Counter": {"description": "<p>Counter is one of Clefable's coolest moves. Pokemon that can be surprised by Counter include Fearow, Tauros, Quagsire, and many more. Clefable survives all of these. The first two moveslots can be about anything: Ice Beam + Thunderbolt is a good idea as well, and Calm Mind works to lure even more physical attacks; if you use Calm Mind, make sure to use a Special Attack in the other free moveslot. You can also use Light Screen in a similar way. Preferably don't use Thunder Wave here: if you Counter against a paralyzed Pokemon, you risk that they get fully paralyzed and your surprise will be given away.</p> <p>Make sure to switch to Bold and to shift Attack EVs to Special Attack when running Special Attacking moves.</p>"},
      "Cosmic Power Staller": {"description": "<p>A stalling set, takes a long time to win with. I don't like this set because you usually get forced to Rest and then phazed, and stalling for so long is just begging to eat a critical hit. I'd always go with Rest here, using Soft-Boiled makes you vulnerable to status. Use Encore on some attacking move and Seismic Toss them to death, or Toxic so your opponent loses HP even while you are setting up or recovering. Flamethrower / Fire Blast is a good option on this set to shut down Steel-types and Weezing.</p>"},
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>A more novel set. Please, use one of your many other Normal Choice Bander options. The only thing Clefable has over them is Meteor Mash, which isn't that great anyway. Feel free to blend in a special move like Flamethrower or Thunderbolt to hurt Skarmory. With these EVs you should be able to outpace Meganium, Blastoise, and about anything else with 200 Speed or lower.</p>"}

  "Vileplume": {
    "overview": "<p>A good UU Pokemon. It walls the hell out of Meganium (don't Sludge Bomb before you check for Counter though), can paralyze opponents or put them to sleep, supports with Aromatherapy and Leech Seed or sweeps with SunnyBeam. Like many other Grass- and Poison-types, however, it gets walled very easily, both in UU and in standard. Still, a good counter to Electric-, Grass-, Water-, and Fighting-types, depending on EVs.</p> <p>Vileplume should only be used outside of UU with the Aromatherapy set, otherwise special versions are inferior to Exeggutor, and physical versions wish they could be Victreebel.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stun Spore is cool if you can catch some fast Flier like Fearow or Salamence on the switch. Toxic is another status affliction Vileplume can deal out; it'll ruin Hypno, who relies on Wish to recover. It works wonders on Milotic and Suicune in standard too, the former losing stall potential, the latter being forced to Rest. Hidden Power Ghost is an alternative physical attack for Swords Dancing Vileplume.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>On the Sunny Day set, since it should only be used in UU, you don't need to worry about being faster than threats like Aerodactyl and Jolteon, so you have a few options here. You can opt to be faster than Electrode (which rarely, if ever, uses a +Speed nature, and it's already rare to begin with), which requires a stat of 190 before Sunny Day (giving 380 after), or 216 EVs. The next breakpoint would be +Speed Persian and Sneasel (also rare) which needs 180 EVs to get a stat of 181. The slowest you should go would be 136 Speed EVs, giving a stat of 170, as this is faster than Timid Manectric and Electabuzz after Sunny Day. Whatever you decide, max out Special Attack with Modest, and put the rest into HP or a defense.</p> <p>On the sweeping sets, you should max the attacking stat you're using, as suggested. The last set should always have max HP, and be mostly focused on one of the defenses.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In standard, without Hidden Power Fire, Metagross, Forretress, Skarmory and other Steels laugh at Vileplume, except if they get Sleep Powdered. Heracross doesn't take much from anything Vileplume does, even Hidden Power Fire. Guts makes it ideal to absorb Stun Spore, and if it has Sleep Talk, then Sleep Powder as well. Dodrio, Salamence, Gyarados and other Fliers hit Vileplume hard with STAB Flying moves, but do not enjoy Stun Spore (due to the speed loss) or Sludge Bomb (because of poison chance and damage). Hidden Power Ice surprises some Fliers pretty well, too.</p> <p>In UU, Muk walls anything Vileplume throws at it, even the Sunnybeam set doesn't do much damage, and if Muk has Fire Blast Vileplume will be dead in two hits. Fearow hates Stun Spore, Hidden Power Ice and Sludge Bomb, but can come in on a Grass move easily and use Choice Banded Drill Peck, which OHKOs Vileplume. Sets without Sludge Bomb or Hidden Power Ice / Fire will get walled by Jumpluff and other Grassers, while any set without a Grass attack has some trouble with Waters with Ice Beam as well as Ground-types. Without Hidden Power Fire, Vileplume is a sitting duck against any Steel.</p>",

Start disabling your counters by wearing them down with Hidden Power or putting one of them to Sleep with Sleep Powder. You will likely want to wait with using Sunny Day when you can OHKO most things your opponent has left, or if you can beat them one on one without dying the process. When the time is right, use Sunny Day to double speed, power up Hidden Power Fire and turn Solar Beam into a one-turn attack. Hidden Power Fire gets rid of Steels like Metagross and Skarmory in two shots, Salamence will nearly always die to one Hidden Power Ice. In UU play, Solar Beam already puts a big dent in Gligar (the only thing really worth using Hidden Power Ice for), so you'll probably want to use Hidden Power Fire for other Grassers like Meganium.</p> <p>Paralysis negates your speed boost, making sweeping practically impossible, so that's why Lum Berry is an option.

In addition, Vileplume is slow and its Attack is only average.</p> <p>Either way, the idea is to find some place to Swords Dance--preferably against a Water or a fellow Grasser-and then attack away, using Moonlight when needed. You can try to put one counter to Sleep with Sleep Powder. Moonlight is replaceable for another attacking move. Hidden Power Fighting has a chance to OHKO Aggron after a Swords Dance, Hidden Power Ground helps for Metagross and still puts a dent in Tyranitar if you're using this in OU.

Suicune might have some troubles once Poliwrath is set up, especially if Suicune lacks Roar. Suicune can't Surf it, and Ice Beam won't do much to it.

It does have some troubles with Salamence, and what can be more surprising than Ice Beaming it to oblivion.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Focus on Attack, with a bit of Speed (near max for Belly Drummers, a small amount for others), and drop the rest in HP or one of the defenses.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Claydol will just take it down, as long as it has Hidden Power Rock instead of Hidden Power Ghost. Note: Jolteon, Aerodactyl, and Crobat will still be faster than Poliwrath after the Salac boost, 1 stat point faster to be precise, if you max out Speed. As such, they will be labeled as counters. Venusaur, Donphan, Skarmory to an extent, Slowbro, Weezing, Gyarados, Flying types, Metagross, Salamence, Celebi, and Dragonite hit Poliwrath hard, in any set. As in UU, without Hydro Pump, Gligar can take any abuse it gives it and finish it off. If it's running without Substitute + Salac, faster things will just dominate it such as Fearow and Electabuzz.</p>",

      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<p>Now this looks like an ordinary Substitute + Belly Drum Water version of Charizard, but it is in some ways better. Send this on a Water Pokemon, especially if your opponent's Suicune doesn't have Roar. The scenario might go like this: You Substitute, they switch. You Belly Drum, they attack. You get Salac boost and you can just attack. Hidden Power Ghost hits Ghosts and Psychics super effectively, but Hidden Power Rock gets Fliers. Since Poliwrath can't get over 394 Speed (393 max with Salac), the EVs suggested give just enough to beat Jolly Dugtrio and Timid Alakazam, as well as take less than 25% from Salamence's Choice Band Rock Slide (so you can switch it in after it kills something, Substitute as it attacks for less than 1/4 or switches, and then Belly Drum). With Hidden Power Rock, you'll need to increase your Speed EVs by 4 at the cost of Defense.</p> <p>In UU, barring Jolly Persian and Electrode, Adamant Poliwrath with those EVs is faster than all UU Pokemon after its Salac activates, giving you some much needed hitting power.</p> <p>Return hits Poisons and, most importantly, Gligar much harder than Brick Break or your Hidden Powers, hits Fliers harder than Hidden Power Ghost, and hits Psychics harder than Hidden Power Rock. It will always OHKO Gligar, but even min HP Gligar has a chance to survive Adamant Hidden Power. You can't even touch Ghosts, obviously, but in UU, Gligar, Vileplume, and Hypno are all common, and Return is the only way to cover them all. Don't use Hidden Power Rock in UU, as there are few Fliers that don't either take neutral damage from Fighting (Fearow and company), or take neutral damage from Rock (Gligar).</p>"

Hidden Power Ghost is for Ghosts while Hidden Power Rock takes care of Fliers (mostly Salamence, Gyarados and Zapdos in standard, as it won't make a difference versus Fearow and Gligar, who take more damage from Focus Punch). Hypnosis helps you to set up more easily and may shut down your main counter, while Bulk Up makes Poliwrath a physical tank. If you can set up a Substitute against slower physical Pokemon and Bulk Up a few times, they're going to be in a world of pain.</p> <p>Using Ice Beam on this set isn't a bad idea. It should cripple if not kill Gligar and Salamence, and it helps against Flygon and Zapdos as well.</p>"},

It also guarantees you will be faster than Zapdos, even 252 Timid ones, after Rock Tomb lowers its Speed. Choice Band Rock Tomb 2HKOs Zapdos about half the time after Leftovers, so if you can hit it with anything, it's going down to two Rock Tombs (Rock Tomb always lowers Speed). Ice Beam is to 2HKO Salamence, who is probably going to be their first switch in to Poliwrath. Focus Punch is easy to get off against Roar Suicune, and also good against Milotic. Sleep Talk is an option to make this thing a real Milotic counter, and it can go over anything but Brick Break.</p>"}

  "Victreebel": {
    "overview": "<p>Victreebel isn't simple to use. It's slow and fragile and lacks a good typing. However, its attacking stats are through the roof. It has a hard time with a lot of standards, mostly Steels, but can nonetheless be a menace by hitting hard on switches. Still, not recommended for newer players. In UU, he can be used to make fun of Meganium, with its immunity to Toxic, 4x resistance to Grass moves, and a Swords Dance-boosted Sludge Bomb that will even shut down those with Reflect or Counter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Encore can catch a lot of stuff off guard, such as Celebi's Recover, Salamence's Dragon Dance, Weezing's Haze, and Tyranitar's Substitute. Synthesis can work, but Victreebel is rather fragile and has no Ground resistance unlike the Recovering Celebi. Growth can be used to power up Special Attack, but Victreebel is bad enough at setting up as it is. Growth really doesn't increase your power that much, and Grass isn't a good attacking type at all. Stun Spore and Body Slam's paralysis chance help Victreebel's low Speed. Reflect can support the team. Hidden Power Ice is nice for catching Salamence and Flygon off-guard in standard, or Altaria and Gligar in UU.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>208 Speed (128 EVs) is a good start for most if not all Victreebel's sets, especially in standard. It beats most Metagross, as well as max Speed Jolly Marowak. Suicune and Kingdra start at 206, so if they have only 4 Speed EVs or none at all you beat them as well. With your other EVs, you will want to max out Victreebel's main attacking stat. And then finally, when using Sludge Bomb on a Special set, put the leftover EVs in Attack. If you're not running Sludge Bomb like that, put what you have left into HP for some more survival, or Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>For standard: Weezing resists Sludge Bomb and Grass moves, can Will-O-Wisp Victreebel and take him down with Sludge Bomb or a Fire move. Haze will erase Swords Dances. Skarmory, Metagross, Jirachi and any other Steel are immune to Sludge Bomb and resists Grass. All three of them can hit Victreebel with STAB super effective moves, but Metagross will do fine with Meteor Mash. Hidden Power Fire is sour for them, though. Salamence and Gyarados take about 30% from Sludge Bomb after Intimidate and hit hard with Hidden Power Flying, and Salamence resists Grass 4x as well. Gengar and Dusclops resist Victreebel's STAB as well. They can both Will-O-Wisp, but Gengar can also use Ice Punch for a load of damage.</p> <p>In Underused matches, Muk resists Sludge Bomb and Grass moves and can Sludge Bomb or use a Fire move on Victreebel's low defenses. Altaria resists Grass moves, but should watch out for these dangerous Sludge Bombs. He doesn't mind Victreebel's status employment though. Camerupt resists Sludge Bomb and OHKOes with his Fire moves, but a Solar Beam nearly OHKOes it. Gligar walls physical sets nicely with his good Defense and natural Sludge Bomb resistance, but Grass moves will hurt him. His Hidden Power Flying really hurts Victreebel though. Any Fire type is going to OHKO Victreebel, they should all beware of that nasty STAB Sludge Bomb, but if Victreebel uses Sunny Day they can really take advantage of that. Beware of Misdreavus as well, who can Thunder Wave or Hidden Power Ice Victreebel.</p> <p>All of Victreebel's counters risk being Sleep Powdered, so try to absorb that with a Sleep Talker first, or put Sleep Talk on a counter.</p>",

Ground and Rock Pokemon get promptly Giga Drained, particularly Swampert and Rhydon in standard and Quagsire and Golem in UU. Sleep Powder is to disable one counter. Save Swords Dancing for later in the game, when there's only slower stuff left that Victreebel KOs easily.</p>"},
      "Special Attacker": {"description": "<p>Hidden Power Fire catches Metagross and Skarmory on the switch and can deal damage to Gengar. Sludge Bomb is to make sure Snorlax and Regice aren't going to wall you easily. It helps against Blissey as well, though she will usually shrug it off with Soft-Boiled. You won't want to cut your secondary attacking stat this time around, because without this Attack investment you won't do much to Snorlax and Regice at all. Rash is probably the best personality for this set, because with Mild, Dugtrio can kill you a lot easier.</p>"},
      "SunnyBeam": {"description": "<p>Sunny Day Victreebel. Hidden Power Fire is for Metagross and Skarmory, while Sludge Bomb keeps Blissey and other Special walls at bay. Sleep Powder is helpful for stuff like Fire Pokemon and Salamence, but it's not totally necessary. Since you're going to try and just sweep your opponent, defensive investment isn't needed.</p> <p>This set's main problem is that unless you use Sludge Bomb, Exeggutor outclasses it in every way in OU, so you should either use Sludge Bomb or use Exeggutor. In UU, however, Exeggutor is banned, so this problem no longer exists.</p>"}

  "Golem": {
    "overview": "<p>A good Pokemon to use in the UU metagame as it stops many sweepers and Choice Band users cold in their tracks. It also has Explosion, which can help to eliminate a Pokemon that's causing you trouble and generally gives some shock value. Golem's weaknesses to Earthquake and special attacks are a huge scar, though.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With Block you can trap something on the switch, but the chance that Golem will be beating whatever switches in on him is slim. Its prime use is trapping Quagsire or some other slower Pokemon and then Exploding on it, but beware Damp or Protect Quagsire. Toxic can be used to wear things like Meganium and Solrock down, but won't work if your opponent has Aromatherapy or Heal Bell. Counter is a great surprise: Golem can survive many Earthquakes and Fighting hits to bounce them back for a quick KO. Roar is useful for Baton Pass chains.</p> <p>Golem can use Body Slam to paralyze a few of its counters, and can follow up with Rock Slide to lock them into paralysis and flinch until they faint. Focus Punch can hit some things hard on the switch, but it has the same power as Earthquake after STAB, so that won't generally do much for you.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Just put a load in HP and Attack, and a little in Defense. Defensive Golem should use Impish, while Choice Banders can use Impish or Adamant. A little Speed can be welcome to Explode on slow stuff, though. 72 EVs is enough for most Vileplume. Trying to outspeed Solrock or Walrein isn't worth the investment.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Golem has trouble with Solrock. Levitate grants it immunity to Earthquake, and with stacked HP and Defense and a faster Reflect, it is not easy to get past. Lunatone has less Defense, but the same typing and ability as well as that super effective Ice Beam to watch out for. Grasses generally make Golem shiver with fear, especially those who have Earthquake resistance, like Meganium and Bellossom. Vileplume and Victreebel OHKO him with any Grass move as well, but they don't like eating repeated STAB Earthquakes. Waters are a problem as well as that's Golem's secondary 4x weakness. Blastoise, Politoed and Poliwrath can all take a beating and Surf or Hydro Pump away. Walrein is weak to Rock, but if it can get in on another move, Golem is still toast. Quagsire has the advantage of the Rock resistance, and can also use STAB Earthquake or Surf, or Ice Beam. Misdreavus is immune to Double-Edge, Explosion, and Earthquake which is a great hindrance, especially for Choice Banders.</p> <p>Besides all this, any kind of decently powered special attack will really mess up Golem, if it doesn't end up KOing him. Not all special attackers like to come into Golem Earthquakes or Rock Slides though.</p>",
    "sets": {"RestTalk": {"description": "<p>Golem's best switch-in opportunity is something with Choice Band, like Fearow and Kangaskhan.

This is the Pokemon that makes Baton Passing such a dangerous strategy, since it stops Pokemon with Roar. I usually prefer Encore on here to stop Pokemon from Calm Minding up against you and getting away with it. Barrier is a good choice to make Mr. Mime very hard to take down by both physical and special attacks.</p>"},

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Razor Leaf is a shafted move in ADV, but a critical hit can mess up things. Grass Whistle is a poor man's Sleep Powder, and again it could hit once. Meganium is very durable and won't mind the accuracy drop as much as fragile Sleepers like Persian would. Toxic is nothing new as an alternative and can work well on something as bulky as Meganium.Substitute + Leech Seed is an interesting combination that should always be mentioned, but Meganium is really too slow to abuse it.</p> <p>Swords Dance can power up physical moves, but you're probably better off using Victreebel for the STAB on Sludge Bomb. Giving Meganium Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ice will allow you to cover more Pokemon types. Finally, if you are paranoid about being statused, Rest over Synthesis is an option. Don't try Sunny Day or Solar Beam, though; use Vileplume or Exeggutor for that.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>If you plan to use Reflect, you'll want to get more Special Defense than suggested above. Alternately, you can use more Special Attack to help a bit with Walrein switches.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>You'll want to watch out for all Grasses, especially those that carry Toxic or are named Vileplume. Fire-types pretty much prove an end to Meganium. Muk and other Poisons in general will have an easy time switching in and have STAB Sludge Bomb to hit Meganium hard. Tentacruel can turn Leech Seed against you with Liquid Ooze, and set up a Swords Dance sweep, or just straight up Sludge Bomb you.</p>",
    "sets": {"Standard": {"description": "<p>Counter is great on Meganium, 100 base in both defenses works excellently. For pseudo-passing and the 50% recovering Synthesis the same cool defenses are a big benefit. Leech Seed is a move every Grass-type should use, can give your team healing support.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hey, some people have pulled off a successful special Gyarados, and if he can do it, Feraligatr can (might) be able to, too! It is definitely unexpected, and that Special Attack isn't awful, and it's got a fair few special attacks there (Crunch and Dragon Claw too), so it's always up for consideration. Brick Break is there, of course, and if you don't like Swords Dance, you can go for a choice band set if you really want. Counter is somewhat unexpected on this Pokemon, so it's a possible choice. Screech at the very least forces a switch, or else let you totally destroy your foe.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>For the first moveset you will want to max out that Attack, put a fair few into Speed, and dump the rest into HP. Its defenses are pretty good for the most part anyway. And maybe some into Special Attack to back Hydro Pump up a bit. Go Adamant or Brave. For the second one you'll want to split your EVs like you would for Gengar and Swampert.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>This big brute will survive weaker Electric and Grass attacks, but I wouldn't push your luck. It is a fair balanced Pokemon overall, just watch out for strong Normal-type sweepers (unless you have Brick Break), fast users of Sleep Powder and Will-O-Wisps.</p>",

  "Ampharos": {
    "overview": "<p>Ampharos makes a name for itself as the best cleric and Electric-type in ADV UU. In a metagame where teams are filled with multiple Pokemon using Toxic or spreading paralysis, Heal Bell is one of the most valuable utility tools for sustaining both offensive and defensive Pokemon, and Ampharos is very effective at using it. Ampharos is a common switch-in to the tier's plethora of Water- and Electric-types by virtue of having impressive mixed bulk coupled with a great ability in Static, which is good at punishing weak contact moves like Rapid Spin, Thief, and Scyther's Aerial Ace. Ampharos isn't a completely passive wall, however, as it is blessed with an astounding base 115 Special Attack stat, which is tied for the highest in the tier with Omastar. This means that it doesn't need much investment to match the power of other Electric-types. Ampharos is a staple on a wide variety of teams that need its cleric support, from balance to bulky offense, working on both Toxic spam and paralysis spam archetypes.</p> <p>However, what can hinder Ampharos as a wall is its lack of recovery outside of Leftovers. This, in conjunction with its poor base Speed, means it has trouble switching in repeatedly when Spikes are up. While Heal Bell is a good support option, its low 8 PP is also a problem for Ampharos, meaning it has to use its opportunities to use Heal Bell wisely, lest it gets overwhelmed by foes repeatedly statusing it. Many Pokemon can also use Heal Bell as an entry point, including powerful wallbreakers such as offensive Kangaskhan and Choice Band Solrock. The tier's common physical attackers usually run Ground-type moves, which Ampharos doesn't like taking due to its lower physical bulk, and even Water-types like Blastoise and Walrein can use Earthquake to keep Ampharos from repeatedly switching in. Finally, while Ampharos deals decent neutral damage, it can fall short of breaking past specially bulky targets like Kangaskhan and Cradily, often relying only on Toxic and Spikes pressure to make progress against them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Focus Punch can be used over a status move with a Quiet nature to break past Kangaskhan, but it reduces Ampharos's ability to make progress using status, and it isn't guaranteed to 2HKO Kangaskhan with Defense investment. Protect can be used instead of a status move for Ampharos to gain more Leftovers recovery, scout Choice Band users such as Solrock, and guard itself against Explosion from Pokemon like Qwilfish and Electrode. Rest can be used with a secondary cleric to give Ampharos recovery and preserve Heal Bell PP for itself. Hidden Power Grass is an alternative Hidden Power choice to be able to deal meaningful damage on Lanturn without resorting to Toxic, and it hits Golem and Quagsire 4x super effectively. However, Hidden Power Ice is preferred for more common checks to Ampharos. Counter can be used to get a surprise KO on some physical attackers that threaten Ampharos, but it has higher risk than reward compared to other consistent options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Kangaskhan walls Ampharos with great special bulk and Early Bird Rest to nullify status. Kangaskhan's Speed also means it will get the jump on Ampharos to pressure with a Normal-type STAB move or to recover off damage it takes from Thunderbolt with Spikes up. Even if Kangaskhan isn't going the bulky route, its offensive sets are able to severely dent Ampharos while avoiding Static when using Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types can find entry on Thunderbolt and proceed to scare out Ampharos. Nidoqueen is a bulky wallbreaker with a Toxic immunity that can use its entry to pressure Ampharos's team with strong coverage and Sludge Bomb poisons, which puts the onus on Ampharos to come back in to use Heal Bell to clear the poison, circling back around to giving Nidoqueen entry again. Quagsire and Camerupt's unique typings allow them to not be affected by BoltBeam coverage, which lets them stonewall Ampharos and apply pressure to its team. Other Ground-types such as Gligar, Golem, Sandslash, and Nidoking can find entry, but they take more damage from Hidden Power Ice and have to be more careful when switching in.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types are able to come in and wall Ampharos, with their weakness to Hidden Power Ice being offset with bulk and instant recovery. Cradily is a prime Ampharos check despite its vulnerability to Toxic. It has great special bulk that lets it shrug off Hidden Power Ice, packs super effective coverage in Earthquake to punish passive plays like Toxic and Heal Bell and threaten a 3HKO, and has Recover with 32 PP, which means unlike other Grass-types that rely on Synthesis or Moonlight, its recovery option can be used liberally over the course of a game. Vileplume is immune to Toxic while having Leech Seed and Moonlight to outlast Ampharos with recovery, and it makes progress through Sludge Bomb poisons or even setting up Swords Dance. Roselia and Cacturne enter on Ampharos to set up Spikes, with Roselia preventing Ampharos from making progress due to its Toxic immunity and Synthesis and Cacturne exerting pressure with Encore and Counter.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Electric-types</strong>: Ampharos is able to check itself due to its huge bulk, and it can force opposing Ampharos to burn Heal Bell PP by repeatedly using status moves. Lanturn can find entry on Ampharos with Volt Absorb healing off any prior damage it takes, meaning it can stonewall Ampharos due to its BoltBeam resistance. Lanturn can protect itself against status from Ampharos by using Substitute or Rest, and can pressure it by battering it down with Surf or forcing it to burn Heal Bell PP by using Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Muk</strong>: Muk's enormous special bulk, coupled with a Toxic immunity, allows it to come in on Ampharos and break open holes in Ampharos's team, or even pose a threat to sweep with Curse + Rest.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Cleric": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Ampharos is a team's primary user of Heal Bell, which allows it to absorb status and cure its teammates of their own status, increasing the longevity of bulkier teammates or keeping offensive threats healthy, both of which include itself. Hidden Power Ice is used to hit Grass- and Ground-types such as Vileplume, Cradily, and Gligar. Most Ground-types besides Nidoqueen are 2HKOed by it, while Gligar is OHKOed, making their entry risky if Ampharos makes correct predictions. Toxic lets Ampharos make progress against defensive cores and cripple its checks that aren't immune to Toxic such as Kangaskhan, Lanturn, Cradily, Hypno, and opposing Ampharos. Thunder Wave is an alternative status option to hinder the Speed of Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Arcanine on paralysis spam structures.</p> <p>Maximum HP and 88 Defense EVs let Ampharos avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Scyther's Hidden Power Bug, and 120 Special Defense EVs prevent a 3HKO from Lapras's Ice Beam. 16 Speed EVs are also used to outspeed certain defensive Omastar spreads.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ampharos pairs well with nearly every Pokemon in the tier, but it especially appreciates teammates that can help sustain its longevity or pose an offensive threat. Kangaskhan provides Ampharos Wish support, spreads status through Toxic or Body Slam, and absorbs status from Ampharos's checks to maintain Heal Bell PP. Omastar checks most physical attackers that can threaten Ampharos, and it provides Spikes support that helps Ampharos threaten its checks upon switching in, since most of them aren't Spikes immune. If a Rapid Spin user tries to remove Omastar's Spikes, Ampharos can find entry and punish their attempt at spinning with Static. Omastar can also reliably run Rest with cleric support, keeping it healthy to check physical attackers long-term. Rapid Spin support from Tentacruel, Blastoise, and Hitmontop is appreciated for Ampharos to comfortably switch into the things it checks. Vileplume partners well with Ampharos, as its bulk and multitude of recovery options allow it to check Kangaskhan and opposing Ampharos, and it provides extra status support through Sludge Bomb poisons or Stun Spore. Pokemon that pose sweeping threats help Ampharos's team establish a long-term offensive threat to mitigate some of Ampharos's own passivity. Long-term win conditions with Rest such as Slowking, Xatu, and Curse users like Walrein, Lapras, and Muk are great in this role, as they are at their most threatening when backed by cleric support to reduce the number of turns they are asleep. Ampharos is one of the best leads in the tier, as it checks common leads such as Qwilfish, Granbull, and Walrein, and it can stalemate with other Electric-type leads like Ampharos and Electabuzz. However, it can also be useful outside of the lead position to preserve its health until it needs to switch in against Water- and Electric-types.</p>"

Granbull may have access to many special moves, but those should be avoided because of how much lower Granbull's Special Attack is compared to its Attack.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Adamant with nearly max Attack for every set except for the Heal Beller is the usual way to go. The utility Granbull will need more HP and Def that the others, though its Attack should never be neglected.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Blastoise and Walrein can take on hits from non-Choice Band sets and stall it out with Rest, but they aren't always the best choice. Reflect Meganium can take a few hits and heal them off with Leech Seed or Synthesis. You'll probably be best off by hitting it with STAB Thunderbolts from the Electric types or other fast hard hitters. If it lacks Earthquake, Aggron and Golem will stop it cold.

    "sets": {
      "Bulk Up": {"description": "<p>The strategy for this set is rather simple: Bulk Up against physically weak opponents and Rest off the damage. The attack drop from Intimidate makes Bulking Up easier than with other Pokemon. The choice between Earthquake and Shadow Ball is dependent on your team. Earthquake covers Golem, Aggron, and other Normal-resistant Pokemon in UU, whereas Shadow Ball hits Misdreavus, Solrock, and Lunatone, and does a bit more to random Psychics than Return.</p>"},
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Choice Band Granbull is dangerous in a UU environment. Its excellent Attack stat and diverse movepool more than compensate for its lackluster Speed. A team that has lost its physical wall will be devastated by this Granbull, therefore it will serve you better to save it for late game when you will be able to more accurately predict an opponent's moves which is the key to every Choice Band set.</p>"},
      "Support": {"description": "<p>This utility set is a completely different direction for Granbull. It is slow but has the Defense to function as decent UU Heal Beller. Just don't pair it up with Exploud or Mr. Mime, as they cannot receive the benefits of Heal Bell. Give it whichever secondary attack and status you need more on your team. While this set isn't as generally good as the others, it is a valuable option due to lack of viable clerics in UU, where Toxic and Thunder Wave users abound.</p>"},
      "SubPunch": {"description": "<p>Intimidate is always nice for a lead off Pokemon where this Granbull functions best. Substitute allows you to take a break from the prediction needed for the Choice Band set and sets up the powerful Focus Punch for the common Rock and Steel type switch-ins. Return is for STAB, and Shadow Ball hits Solrock and Lunatone, as well as Misdreavus and other Ghosts. You can use Brave to guarantee you'll move last, meaning you can take a hit, set up a Substitute, and then use Focus Punch as they break the Substitute.</p>"}

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>It can Double Kick for stuff like Substitute Aggron, but it's not that useful. It can use Return to hit Gligar harder than any of your other moves.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Attack and Speed, only.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gligar is the best counter, thanks to its high Defense, Flying STAB, and Hitmonlee's low Defense. Slowking will also have a thing or two to say to it. Masquerain beats those without Rock Slide. Blastoise and Meganium can take hits from the Choice Band set. Grumpig and Hypno can use it to set up Calm Mind with their Fighting resistance, but Hidden Power Ghost will put the hurt on them.</p>",
    "sets": {"Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Use this Choice Band set how you would any other Choice Bander, with one important proviso: Hitmonlee can also switch into paralyzing moves such as Thunder Wave with impunity, since it has the Limber ability.

This is a pretty simple and standard strategy, but again Hitmonlee's Limber ability is extremely useful for this set.</p> <p>Bulk Up can be used with either Substitute or Endure, but Focus Punch should be used with Substitute. If you are using Bulk Up, you may want to lower your Speed to 254 Speed (176 EVs) and put the rest into HP so you can potentially get 2 or more Bulk Ups, as this still allows you to outspeed everything in UU but Timid Electrode, which is extremely rare.</p>"}}

  "Hitmontop": {
    "overview": "<p>Hitmontop is one of the tier's few Fighting-types, offering unique role compression by being able to both use Rapid Spin and check the tier's best Pokemon, Kangaskhan. Hitmontop's ability Intimidate isn't just useful for switching into Kangaskhan, however, as it checks a slew of other physical attackers such as Granbull, Nidoqueen, and Solrock, which Hitmontop counters. Its base 110 Special Defense is nothing to scoff at either, letting it take hits and trade with certain special attackers in a pinch such as Tentacruel, Ampharos, and Lanturn. Hitmontop's access to Fighting-type STAB lets it threaten many common Pokemon, and it has a good physical movepool for coverage to back it up.</p> <p>However, while Hitmontop can both check Kangaskhan and use Rapid Spin as dual role compression, it finds itself being less effective at both than the Pokemon it competes with, such as Granbull for the former and Tentacruel and Blastoise for the latter. Hitmontop's meager base 50 HP and lack of reliable recovery means it can have trouble switching in against offensive Kangaskhan variants with Spikes up. Without the Intimidate Attack drop, it also takes heavy damage from the physical attackers it means to check besides Solrock. Hitmontop's onus to use Rapid Spin can also make it passive against Spikes teams, and it tends to invite in dangerous Pokemon such as Scyther and Gligar. Not only this, but Hitmontop can struggle against teams using Misdreavus to spinblock, as Hitmontop does not like wasting its health to Psychic without getting a chance to use Rapid Spin. Hitmontop also has issues offensively; as a Fighting-type, it wants as much coverage as possible but can't fit everything into one set, giving it painful four-moveslot syndrome. Even with the proper coverage, Hitmontop's unimpressive base 95 Attack means it lacks power even against the Pokemon hit super effectively by it, such as Omastar, Walrein, and Cradily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mach Punch serves as a priority move to check sweepers such as Reversal Scyther, Rain Dance Omastar, and Petaya Berry Electric-types such as Electrode and Manectric. Thief can be used with no item to steal Leftovers from bulky Pokemon such as Ampharos, Tentacruel, and Vileplume. However, Hitmontop has to drop valuable coverage to run it, and it can backfire if Hitmontop accidentally steals a Choice Band from Scyther. Rest can be used alongside a cleric to gain recovery, but it makes Hitmontop much more passive while asleep, and it can't threaten with more coverage. Bulk Up can be used over a coverage option to pose a potential sweeping threat when it finds entry, and Hitmontop can use it to match the boosts of Curse users such as Walrein, Lapras, and Muk. High Jump Kick sounds appealing to threaten Kangaskhan and Omastar more than Brick Break can, but the extra damage is not worth it when considering its less than perfect accuracy and potential for massive recoil damage on a Pokemon that already struggles to preserve its health. Hitmontop can use Endeavor, Mach Punch, Hidden Power Ghost, and Endure with a Salac Berry on a lead set for a surprise way to make progress on offensive teams by breaking holes for offensive teammates to capitalize on, but its general consistency is very low compared to standard Rapid Spin sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Gligar is not hit meaningfully by any of Hitmontop's coverage options, and it can set up Swords Dance to threaten Hitmontop with boosted Hidden Power Flying while not caring about Intimidate thanks to Hyper Cutter. Altaria can sit in on Hitmontop and stall it out with Toxic, as even Rock Slide won't be able to 3HKO physically defensive variants. Scyther can find entry on resisted moves or Rapid Spin and threaten Hitmontop with a strong Aerial Ace or Hidden Power Flying, but it has to be mindful of Rock Slide when switching in, and Rock Slide Hitmontop can find entry on a Scyther that is Choice-locked into Hidden Power Bug to scare it out. Fearow is similar to Scyther with a stronger Flying-type STAB option in Drill Peck, but finds less entry due to not resisting Brick Break.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Slowking, Xatu, and Grumpig use their resistance to Fighting to find entry and threaten Hitmontop on the special side. None of them are OHKOed by Hidden Power Ghost, and the Psychic-types that are 2HKOed are faster, which means they win one on one. They can even take advantage of Hitmontop switching out by setting up Calm Mind, which lets them exert a lot of offensive pressure even when Hitmontop removes the Spikes they depend on.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Misdreavus, Haunter, and Sableye are immune to Brick Break and can spinblock Hitmontop to keep Spikes up. Even though Misdreavus and Haunter's Psychic don't do amazing damage to Hitmontop while Hidden Power Ghost deals good damage to both, they can use it to pressure if Hitmontop's health is low enough. Haunter can also use Destiny Bond to remove Hitmontop for one of its teammates and for Spikes to stay up for the remainder of the battle. Sableye can completely wall Hitmontop lacking Toxic, with tools like Toxic and Knock Off to harm Hitmontop's longevity and Recover to outlast it.</p> <p><strong>Vileplume</strong>: Vileplume doesn't care about any of Hitmontop's coverage, and it can even heal off the damage it takes from Hitmontop with Leech Seed or Moonlight while making progress through spreading status with Sludge Bomb or Stun Spore. Swords Dance variants are also able to take advantage of Hitmontop to pose a sweeping threat while boosting past Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Muk</strong>: Muk can switch in on Hitmontop to break open holes for its team, only being threatened by Earthquake. Muk can also use Curse + Rest to use Hitmontop as long-term setup fodder to pose a sweeping threat.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Opposing Intimidate hinders the effectiveness of Hitmontop, which already struggles with power. Even Granbull, which is weak to Brick Break, can utilize Intimidate and its great physical bulk to take negligible damage from Hitmontop and potentially set up with Bulk Up. Arcanine doesn't take much damage from Brick Break and threatens Hitmontop with Fire Blast. Opposing Hitmontop are also effective Hitmontop switch-ins, allowing both to reverse Spikes momentum for their teams.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hitmontop finds opportunities to use Rapid Spin by coming in on physical attackers such as Kangaskhan and Solrock, as well as a chipped Omastar in 2HKO range for Brick Break, as Hitmontop loses the interaction otherwise. Hidden Power Ghost is needed to check Solrock, and additionally hits other Psychic-types such as Slowking, Grumpig, and Lunatone, as well as Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Haunter, which can spinblock Hitmontop. Hitmontop's third coverage move is important for deciding which Pokemon it will cover while sacrificing other matchups. Earthquake can be chosen to hit Poison-types, such as Tentacruel, Qwilfish, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Muk, and it can hit Electric-types hard without activating Static. Rock Slide is chosen to hit Flying-types such as Scyther, Altaria, and Fearow, usually on the switch in. Toxic helps against irritating walls such as Blastoise, Cradily, Sableye, and Hypno; it also is a generally safe move to use, as it cripples most of Hitmontop's switch-ins without having to guess with a coverage option.</p> <p>The given EV spread lets Hitmontop have favored odds to 3HKO Omastar with Brick Break while also dealing important damage to bulky Kangaskhan, Cradily, and Misdreavus. The rest of the EVs are put in HP and Defense to let Hitmontop switch in on physical attackers. More EVs can be placed into Speed to hit benchmarks for outspeeding certain Pokemon; 136 Speed EVs let Hitmontop outspeed offensive Omastar, and 184 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed defensive Kangaskhan variants. However, the extra Speed isn't always worth the loss in bulk unless it's needed for Hitmontop's team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Hitmontop lacking reliable recovery, it is rarely seen without Wish Kangaskhan, which helps Hitmontop switch into common Kangaskhan switch-ins, such as opposing Kangaskhan, Omastar, Solrock, and Granbull, over the course of a longer game. Hitmontop is vulnerable to status such as Toxic from Kangaskhan when switching into it, which harms its general longevity, so a cleric such as Ampharos, Aromatherapy Vileplume, or Altaria helps patch up this issue. Hitmontop tends to invite in setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Scyther, Gligar, Curse Muk, and Swords Dance Vileplume, and it lacks power to prevent Curse Lapras, Curse Walrein, and Feraligatr from setting up on it. For this reason, Hitmontop pairs well with a phazer such as Encore Walrein, Roar Blastoise, Roar Altaria, or Perish Song Misdreavus. Hitmontop appreciates Pokemon that can switch into the Flying-types it tends to draw in, including most of the aforementioned Pokemon like Walrein, Altaria, Lapras, and Misdreavus. In return, Hitmontop switches into and checks Solrock, which threatens these Pokemon. Hitmontop can be used in the lead position to Intimidate physical attackers and win the 1v1 against leads like Ampharos, Kangaskhan, Walrein, and Nidoking, or it can be used in the back to switch into physical attackers or Spikers mid-game when it needs to.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>When it comes to fast Electric-types, Electrode has no issues standing out. Its astonishing base 140 Speed makes it the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the tier by quite some margin. With its incredible Speed, usable Special Attack, and Explosion, it makes for a good revenge killer and suicide wallbreaker on offensive teams. Electrode can reliably revenge kill Scyther, which other Electric-types like Manectric and Electabuzz can only Speed tie with. It also pairs well with Electric-types, though, as they share a lot of checks that Electrode can lure in and destroy with Explosion. However, Electrode's offensive stats leave something to be desired when comparing it to Electabuzz and Manectric, and although its Explosion hits hard, it won't KO bulkier Pokemon without some prior damage. It also has less than stellar bulk, so it won't withstand most super effective hits, and even strong neutral hits like Kangaskhan's Double-Edge will KO it without much prior damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt is an option over Substitute on some teams to easily KO Wish Kangaskhan with Explosion. Hidden Power Grass hits Lanturn without resorting to Explosion, but the downsides of dropping Hidden Power Ice are generally not worth it. Thunder Wave could be used on teams that appreciate faster Pokemon being slowed down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Although weakened Kangaskhan can be KOed by Explosion, offensive versions can OHKO Electrode back with ease. Rest means it might be able to switch out and heal any damage later, undoing Electrode's hard work. It also can potentially switch out or use Protect on a predicted Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Electric-types and Grass-types</strong>: Volt Absorb Lanturn renders Hidden Power Ice Electrode useless and may run Protect to block Explosion or Rest to handle Toxic. Ampharos cannot deal much damage to Electrode at once but generally outlasts it with its superior bulk and power. Cradily completely sits on Electrode unless it runs Toxic, as it is 3HKOed by Hidden Power Ice at best. Vileplume is also an effective counter, as it resists Thunderbolt and isn't 2HKOed by unboosted Hidden Power Ice. However, all of these Pokemon but Cradily fall to Explosion with enough chip damage.</p>",

      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Substitute gives Electrode a much needed shield from hard hitters, scouts for switch-ins when forcing foes out, and helps activate Petaya Berry or Liechi Berry. Explosion leaves a serious dent in most foes despite Electrode's horrible Attack. This is helped because Electrode's checks do not resist Normal; the main Pokemon that does, Omastar, wants nothing to do with Thunderbolt, and Ghost-types in Misdreavus and Banette are fairly uncommon and don't enjoy Thunderbolt either. Hidden Power Ice lets it OHKO Gligar and push damage on Vileplume so Explosion KOes. Toxic can cripple Cradily, which otherwise walls Electrode.</p> <p>As for its item, a pinch Berry is the most common choice. Petaya Berry is generally the best choice for its Special Attack boost, but Liechi Berry can be useful for instantly taking down a bulkier Explosion target like Kangaskhan, Vileplume, Ampharos, or the uncommon Hypno. Leftovers is another option, especially if Electrode is running Toxic, as it gives it longevity and potentially more Substitute uses. Magnet is useful if Electrode is running a Speed-boosting nature to give it a much needed damage boost to Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Because its Speed is so high, Electrode generally doesn't need a lot of Speed EVs unless you want it to outrun a specific boosted target, such as Gorebyss in rain or Salac Berry-boosted base 50s, 55s, or 60s like Banette. Not requiring a lot of Speed EVs means that it can invest in Special Attack, Attack, and even bulk at the same time. The spread shown above puts Electrode at 340 Speed with a neutral nature, letting it outrun base 105s like Scyther, Manectric, and Electabuzz. The spread also makes Substitute take exactly 25% of Electrode's health, allowing for the quickest activation of its pinch Berry. If not using one, this benchmark is unnecessary. 116 Defense EVs let Electrode take maximum Attack Kangaskhan's Earthquake. If you are not using any HP investment, 128 EVs will do the same. The other EVs are dumped into Attack for Explosion. An alternative spread is 100 Atk / 192 SpA / 216 Spe with a Naive nature, which revenge kills Swift Swim Gorebyss.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Electrode needs help to break through bulkier Pokemon, Spikes is a natural fit with it. Omastar and Glalie make for good Spikes users, since the former can switch into Kangaskhan and fit on almost any team, and the latter is great at getting Spikes up early on for Electrode to take advantage of. Electrode makes a great partner for a second Electric-type like Manectric or Electabuzz, which greatly appreciates Electrode baiting in and using Explosion on shared counters, and they too appreciate Spikes support. Rain Dance Omastar, Scyther, and Gorebyss also appreciate Electrode's ability to lure in and destroy the likes of Ampharos, Vileplume, and Kangaskhan.</p>"

Always consider this fish for any UU team you might be making.</p>",

Ice Beam can be used to for stuff like Claydol and Salamence, I suppose, but most everything else, such as Grass-types, will be hit harder by Sludge Bomb. Counter can be used instead of Destiny Bond, though most stuff KOs Qwilfish and Destiny Bond tends to be a much better move.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>If you're using a mixed set, you should lower his Defense (use Hasty or Lonely nature), especially if you're using Destiny Bond, as that would guarantee that most things kill you, but still lets you switch on Walrein, Blastoise, and other Water-types. You'll want a lot of Attack on the sweeper sets, but more defensive EVs on the Spiker.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Donphan and Claydol can completely shut you down if you don't have Hydro Pump, and Claydol doesn't take much even if you do. Big brother Tentacruel can easily get set up on Qwilfish, and anything that can take a Sludge Bomb and deal some good damage is a pretty good deterrent as well. Most Rapid Spinners tend to have more than enough defense to take you on, so don't get overzealous with the Spikes. Take what you can get. From the \"if it has to Destiny Bond you\" standpoint of counters, Muk and Misdreavus make great switch ins.

The theory is that Qwilfish becomes faster than everything else with Drizzle in effect (and thus should only be used with Kyogre), but can't stay in for long due to its poor defenses and lack of useful resists outside of Ice Beam. A Choice Band, therefore, suits the style of play Qwilfish generally needs to survive. Hydro Pump hits Skarmory, Forretress, and Metagross, and does something to Groudon, but Ice Beam will do more to Groudon and Rayquaza. Hydro Pump is probably going to be the more useful move, as Rayquaza is very rare, especially compared to Forretress, and Hydro Pump is not much weaker vs. Groudon than Ice Beam.

It's been so influential that standards have changed: Gligar packs Toxic, Steel Wing or Iron Tail to deal with it, Fearow uses Steel Wing and some Ground-types use Hidden Power Bug or Ghost. Still, it's good to go. In standard, it can counter some Choice Banders like Salamence and Tauros pretty decently, but you'll have to predict even more accurately because despite its good HP and Defense, it takes quite a beating from neutral or super effective hits.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With Psych Up, Solrock can surprise Snorlax in standard play. Come in when it has some Curses, copy them, and either try to take it out by yourself, or Baton Pass to something to handle it and the rest of your opponent's team. You may want to watch out for Shadow Ball variants though. Cosmic Power can be Baton Passed as well, but usually begs for critical hits, which you don't want. Light Screen, like Reflect, helps Solrock and the rest of the team to take hits better. Since Solrock lures Water- and Grass-types, it's not a bad idea at all.</p> <p>Body Slam can paralyze opponents sometimes, and Fire moves can hurt Steel-types like Skarmory and Forretress in OU. Toxic can help to wear down the Water-types that switch in on Solrock all the time, and finally, he doesn't make a bad Rest / Sleep Talk user. It does take away a lot of its offense though.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>For most tankish Solrock, a +Defense nature like Impish is preferred. Max out its HP before working on its defenses; put its Defense somewhere between 260 and 280 to live through most hits decently. Special Defense is welcome to take on Psychic-types. A few Speed EVs isn't a bad idea either, especially if you're using Shadow Ball. Solrock ties Speed with Claydol, and of course it helps against enemy Solrock too.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In OU, Metagross awaits it with its resistance to Rock Slide and Explosion, and a STAB super effective Meteor Mash for the OHKO. Earthquake without a Choice Band will only 3HKO Metagross, so watch out. Jirachi with Reflect or Wish can be annoying to an extent, but it needs Thunderbolt and a Calm Mind to really hurt Solrock. Swampert's, Milotic's, and Suicune's high durability and STAB Surfs will be a huge problem as well, try to remove them with Explosion and sweep with something else. Check for Protect Swampert first though, or do it on the switch. Skarmory and Forretress take jack from any physical hit you throw at them. Both will put up Spikes, and Forretress sometimes uses Hidden Power Bug. Celebi can Recover off all your hits, and may pack a Grass move to really put a hurting in you. Dusclops can kill you with Shadow Ball, Will-O-Wisp you, block Explosion and Rest/Pain Split off the damage.</p> <p>For UU, generally Water-types and Grass-types can come in on anything Solrock does, and use their STAB attacks to put a hurting in you. Most notably Quagsire, Whiscash, Blastoise, Poliwrath (usually has no Water moves though), Politoed, and Slowking on the Water side, and Meganium, Vileplume, Bellossom, and Tangela on the Grass one. Banette can be a pain with Will-O-Wisp but won't be switching in on Rock Slides or Shadow Balls. You must beware of it when you want to use Explosion though, and the same goes for when your opponent uses Misdreavus.</p>",

You may want to beware of Shadow Ball, Steel Wing, and Hidden Power Bug, but as long as you switch to Solrock on the right move and put on a Reflect, you'll be fine. After that, attack to your heart's content, switch out of counters, and keep the cycle going until you've had enough. Blow up Solrock on something that doesn't like to get blown up, and its job is done.</p>"},

I don't know why it got Grass-type since it's a Tengu, a bird-like evil spirit, but it's a good thing it did. It also has some use in Ubers, paired with Groudon for the Speed boost, so it can just abuse Shadow Ball to hit all the Psychic Ubers.</p>",

Well, Steel Wing can be used to hit Solrock and Lunatone, same for Hidden Power Ghost (which also hits UU Ghosts harder than Drill Peck, but that doesn't cover the Rock / Steel-types). Hidden Power Ground, however, is better overall, especially against Aggron. Double-Edge is another option over Return just for that extra punch. Double-Edge from Fearow HURTS UUs that aren't named Golem or Aggron (and other walls with a Rock / Steel typing).

Ghost-types like Sableye and Banette can be used too. You should, however, be careful while switching stuff into Fearow again as it can hit pretty hard if the player predicts right. Strong defensive Pokemon like Blastoise or Gligar may trouble you.</p>",

Quick Attack, despite being weak, can sometimes make all the difference when you need it the most, and Hidden Power Ground is there to deal with nasty Rock or Steel-types.</p>"}, "Baton Pass": {"description": "<p>Fearow got Baton Pass as an XD move, so it can be nice to pass stuff around when people are expecting the Choice Band version.</p> <p>Use 252 Speed EVs with Jolly if you're using Substitute, or the suggested EVs with Adamant and Agility.</p>"}}

  "Sandslash": {
    "overview": "<p>In standard, the only thing it has over Donphan is Swords Dance, while Donphan has better stats everywhere except in Speed, plus Roar. Therefore, when using Sandslash in standard, use Swords Dance. It's not a bad Pokemon there, maybe even a tad underrated, a Swords Danced Earthquake does about 70% to Milotic and minimally 60% to Swampert. It resists Rock Slide from Tyranitar and Aerodactyl pretty well, you may want to try it out sometime.</p> <p>In UU, Sandslash is a monster. It rivals Quagsire and Gligar as the best Ground around. It can 2HKO Quagsire and Blastoise with a Swords Dance, and if Gligar comes in on a Swords Dance it can take it out one on one, barring Toxic. Its great Defense and the use of Hidden Power Ghost or Rock makes it an alright Solrock switch-in (though Reflect will be annoying), and it can hurt its counters quite well. Be aware of Sandslash's great sweeping powers, whether you're using it or not.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A great example in standard is Snorlax: try coming in on a Curse. Snorlax might be afraid you're going to Swords Dance up on him and will try to attack you, and a Counter will put a big dent into him. It will also be of great use against Choice Banders such as Salamence in standard or Fearow in UU.</p> <p>You can use Rest for that, but Sandslash may have a hard time surviving this without Heal Bell or Aromatherapy somewhere on your team. Same for UU, except that is even more fast-paced. Protect can be handy for lingering Toxic, gaining Leftovers recovery and scouting for Explosion or Choice Banded moves.</p> <p>Focus Punch can come handy if Skarmory comes in on your Swords Dance, but usually it will not hurt anything more than Earthquake and Rock Slide together will. Flail simply doesn't work well as Sandslash doesn't have STAB on it and isn't fast enough to pull it off. Hidden Power Ghost hits Gengar and Misdreavus harder than Rock Slide, and still puts a dent into Celebi, Solrock and Lunatone, and Hidden Power Flying is an awesome option to scare Heracross and Breloom, and it still hits Celebi, so it's pretty useful when you're using this guy in standard. Sandslash makes an average Sleep Talker thanks to his great defense, but you'll be wasting his awesome Swords Dance potential, and the most common Sleep moves come from Milotic, Jynx and Grass-types, none of which Sandslash likes to face.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>It outspeeds Blastoise with no Speed EVs, with the recommended spread, as well as anything slower (Hypno, Solrock, and anything else with 70 base or lower). You'll generally want a ton of Attack, with the rest of the EVs in HP.</p> <p>If you're using Counter, you may want to take EVs from Attack and Speed and put them into HP.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Its biggest weakness is that it's slow and doesn't take special hits very well, but most special attackers do not take his Earthquakes that easily either.</p> <p>In standard, Skarmory walls Sandslash to an extent. Toxic will mess it up badly, Spikes will hurt the team and Roar and Whirlwind negate Swords Dance. However, Sandslash can also Rapid Spin off the Spikes, and hit Skarmory with a Swords Danced Focus Punch, or try to wear it down with Rock Slide (Swords Danced Rock Slide does about 40%). Suicune, Milotic and Swampert can OHKO with Surf or Hydro Pump, and their high HP and Defense will be troublesome in the early stages. If their health falls below 50%, however, a Swords Danced Earthquake will kill all three of them (except a Bold max Defense max HP Suicune, who has a chance to survive). Salamence and Gyarados can be a pain with Intimidate and immunity to Earthquake, but unless they're using a Special Attack like Hydro Pump, Sandslash can just Swords Dance on the switch and beat them with Rock Slide. Claydol is immune to Earthquake and resists Rock Slide, and usually packs Toxic or a super effective Ice Beam, however he is 3HKOed by Hidden Power Ghost or Hidden Power Bug without Swords Dance. Zapdos and Raikou, as well as other Special Attackers that outspeed Sandslash, can come in on a non-attacking move or after Sandslash killed something to finish it off.</p> <p>In UU, a Gligar with Counter or Toxic can mess up Sandslash somewhat, and Quagsire, Blastoise and Walrein can hold the boat to the same extent Suicune, Milotic and Swampert can in standard. Solrock can Reflect up and Lunatone can use Ice Beam, but they should beware of Hidden Power Ghost or Hidden Power Bug. Any STAB Water, Grass or Ice attack will (nearly) kill Sandslash. Meganium makes a great counter with Giga Drain, Razor Leaf or Hidden Power Grass, perhaps in company of Reflect and / or Leech Seed, but once again watch out for Hidden Power Bug. Make sure to use Synthesis to keep it alive.</p>",

Hit your counters on the switch: Earthquake for Waters like Milotic, Swampert, Suicune in standard or Quagsire and Blastoise in UU, and Hidden Power Bug for Celebi in standard and Solrock in UU. Take note of how much damage you do. When they take two more hits to finish off, Swords Dance on the switch, then take them out.</p>"},

      "Counter": {
        "description": "<p>This set is designed to specifically counter some of the biggest threats in the UU metagame, while still being able to get most of the 2HKOs and OHKOs that it needs to. Counter is a great addition to the sweeper set, as it allows Sandslash to destroy many of the Grass-type Pokemon which normally stop it, since their strongest move is Hidden Power Grass, which can be Countered. The basic strategy is to bring Sandslash in on a weak physical attack such as Rock Slide, or any Electric attack. Swords Dance on the switch and then start sweeping. This set allows you to take out Blastoise, Walrein, and Meganium - all common switch-ins to Sandslash -and continue sweeping what you can. Greedy Gligars also get taken out it they try to KO with only +2 or +4 Atk (depending on EVs and nature of the Gligar).</p> <p>Another bonus is that with the 252 HP EVs, and 36 SpD EVs you always survive various STAB Surfs and Ice Beams, while being faster and being able to 2HKO. For example, you can Swords Dance on your opponent's switch to Walrein or Blastoise, and then hit it for a 2HKO with Rock Slide (only on Walrein) or Earthquake, and live through the Surf / Ice Beam to hit them for the KO. Additionally, Sandslash will always survive a Timid Manectric's Hidden Power even after a Petaya boost, as well as almost always surviving a Timid Electabuzz's Ice Punch after a Petaya boost.</p> <p>Rock Slide is the preferred move in the 4th slot, because it has the flinch rate, and Sandslash is able to outspeed most walls. It also allows Sandslash to take out fliers and Levitators that would not take themselves out with Counter, such as Misdreavus and Xatu, but more importantly, Altaria (which is outsped by this variant of Sandslash, allowing you to Rock Slide and possibly flinch before you get hit with Haze or Perish Song). Furthermore, it helps with Scyther and Yanma, not allowing them to set up while you try to Counter. Hidden Power Bug hits Grass types that do not attack with Hidden Power Grass, such as Bellosom and Tangela, and can hit Meganium hard if it uses Light Screen or Leech Seed. Hidden Power Bug also hits Solrock / Lunatone for super effective damage. Hidden Power Ghost, on the other hand, hits not only the previously mentioned Lunatone / Solrock for super effective damage, but also Misdreavus and Xatu as well. Counter takes care of Fearow, so it is not a big trouble if it walls those two attacks. It should be noted, however, that Rock Slide does have lower accuracy than Hidden Power</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>You can use Flamethrower over Fire Blast, but Fire Blast is recommended because its Special Attack is quite low. Confuse Ray makes you hard to hit, but can work against you when you Grudge and they hit themselves in confusion. Hypnosis is a gamble, but a very rewarding one. You can use it with Will-O-Wisp if you wish: put one Pokemon to sleep, and then burn another. Toxic is another alternative status ailment; burn is better on physical attackers though. Hidden Power Ice takes a chunk of life out of Altaria.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>At least 148 EVs in Speed and Timid nature for 300 Speed, but max is nice. Spread the rest over HP, Special Attack and Special Defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Camerupt is a good Ninetales counter. Wailord can switch in on Will-O-Wisp due to its trait, Water Veil, making it unable to be burned. Blastoise won't care about being hit by Will-O-Wisp and will dispatch Ninetales away quite easily with Surf, unless it gets Grudged.

When the end is near and you want to sacrifice Ninetales, it's time for his big contribution to the team: Grudge.

  "Persian": {
    "overview": "<p>A novelty Pokemon in both standard and UU. It is outclassed by many other Normals despite the great Speed, because its Attack is really below average and it cannot take a hit at all. It is highly unlikely Persian is going to pull off anything game breaking against someone who knows what he's doing. The fastest Hypnosis in the game is nice to shut down at least one counter though.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Screech forces your opponent to either switch out, or stay in and eat double damage, but should only be used with Spikes. Hyper Beam can be used for some last-effort damage if Persian is going to die anyway, or to finish off something when it's not expecting Persian to do more damage. Thief is good to steal these Leftovers or Choice Band from your counter, you may want to put it on the Liechi set and use it when you're about to die. Toxic is a way of forcing permanent damage on things like Gligar and Solrock in UU, or Swampert in standard, but it doesn't help if your opponent has Aromatherapy, Rest, or Heal Bell. Thunder or Thunderbolt can be used in standard as they hurt Skarmory.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>If Persian has 341 Speed (this requires 176 EVs and a Jolly nature), it is faster than all Pokemon in UU except Electrode, as well as Persian and Sneasel with more Speed EVs, so this is a good point to aim at. Then, max Persian's Attack and dump any leftover EVs into HP or a defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Anything that resists Normal. For standard, this includes Skarmory and Forretress, who can Spike up against Persian, as well as Metagross, Rhydon and Tyranitar. Metagross can OHKO with Meteor Mash, Rhydon with Earthquake, and Tyranitar with Focus Punch, but Tyranitar can also opt to 2HKO with Rock Slide (or, if it's Choice Banded, OHKO). Hidden Power helps against Tyranitar to an extent, but Metagross isn't even 2HKOed by Choice Band Hidden Power Ground. Regirock, Scizor and Registeel can take Persian's hits as well and set-up against it. Weezing doesn't resist Normal but nonetheless takes anything that's not a Choice Band Double-Edge easily, it can Will-O-Wisp Persian and Sludge Bomb it to death. Besides all this, lots and lots of things with some kind of Defense and attacking potential can take a hit and beat Persian one-on-one. Swampert, Suicune and Milotic can beat Persian, though Choice Band STAB attacks will bite.</p> <p>In UU, Golem takes anything like a champ and cripples Persian with Earthquake. Solrock doesn't like Shadow Ball or Iron Tail much but it can help it with Reflect and start pounding on Persian with STAB Rock Slide as well. Gligar has to avoid STAB Choice Band Normal hits but takes anything else just fine. Mawile's Normal resistance combined with Intimidate makes it quite a good counter, but beware Hidden Power Fighting or Ground. The same goes to Aggron: it takes no damage from anything but these Hidden Powers.</p> <p>And in the end, Persian still cannot take a hit, so when in doubt just hit Persian with your most powerful move and it will die in two hits maximum. Be wary of getting your counter Hypnotized.</p>",

Fake Out is for Ninjask, Alakazam, and things like Reversal Heracross and Medicham, though it won't work if they Endure the Fake Out. Iron Tail can be used if you're unsure if your opponent is going to switch to, for example Tyranitar or Gengar.

  "Golduck": {
    "overview": "<p>Golduck stands out in ADV UU as a fast offensive Water-type that has access to Calm Mind. Its strong STAB Hydro Pump rips through even specially bulky foes like Kangaskhan and Ampharos. Golduck is also gifted with a unique ability in Cloud Nine, making it able to put a stop to weather-based hyper offense teams. Cloud Nine disables the Speed boost from Swift Swim and Chlorophyll, allowing Golduck to revenge kill Rain Dance Omastar and Gorebyss and Sunny Day Vileplume, as well as ignoring Sunny Day Arcanine attempting to weaken Hydro Pump by setting up sun. Golduck is a more aggressive alternative to another offensive Water-type in Slowking because of its good Speed, Cloud Nine, and no Rest turns to exploit, making it a better pick on hyper offensive teams that need a backup weather answer.</p> <p>However, Golduck faces competition from the plethora of other offensive Water-types in the tier, such as Rain Dance Omastar, Swords Dance Tentacruel, Gorebyss, and Feraligatr. It lacks the defensive profile that enables Pokemon like Slowking to play the long game, which leaves it easily worn down by stray attacks and status as it tries to set up, and Golduck only makes up for it with its moderately fast base Speed stat. Additionally, Golduck's ability to revenge kill weather sweepers is replicated by Pokemon like Electrode and Ninjask, which can also revenge kill other fast Pokemon like Scyther and Tentacruel.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam can be used over Psychic to maintain a strong hit on Vileplume while having coverage for Cradily and Altaria, but Golduck would lack coverage for Tentacruel unless it uses Hidden Power Electric, which can't OHKO Omastar. Hypnosis lets Golduck shut down slower Pokemon that threaten it like Ampharos and Lanturn, giving it reliable setup turns. However, dropping any coverage Golduck has severely limits its ability to threaten its checks, and it can be risky to rely on Hypnosis's meager 60% accuracy. Lum Berry prevents Golduck from being worn down by status, letting it attack or set up against an incoming Toxic or paralysis move. Mystic Water allows Golduck to have the damage of a Modest nature on its STAB moves while maintaining the speed tie with Jolly Gligar that Timid provides. However, it's worth noting that while Golduck is not as reliant on the passive recovery of Leftovers as an offensive sweeper, any amount of passive damage, from Spikes to Toxic, permanently sticking makes Golduck much more fragile.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Golduck is threatened by every common Electric-type in the tier. Ampharos has good special bulk and a Thunderbolt that can OHKO an unboosted Golduck, Lanturn has ample opportunity to gain entry with its Water resistance, and all other Electric-types, such as Electrode, Electabuzz, and Manectric, outspeed Golduck. However, Ampharos can't switch in too many times throughout a battle and has to stay out of range of a boosted Hydro Pump, while the faster Electric-types can't switch in well at all.</p> <p><strong>Cradily</strong>: Cradily is a bulky special wall that can put Golduck on a timer with Toxic, and it can also use Recover to take advantage of Hydro Pump's low PP as well as rack up Toxic damage. However, Golduck can take advantage of Cradily's general passivity to boost, and it doesn't take much damage from Cradily's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Because Golduck is reliant on its Speed to make successful sweeps, paralysis from Kangaskhan's Body Slam, Vileplume's Stun Spore, or Misdreavus's Thunder Wave stops Golduck dead in its tracks and allows more Pokemon to take advantage of its low bulk.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Pokemon with phazing moves like Walrein, Altaria, and Blastoise stand in the way of Golduck's sweep with their good bulk and force it to start again from square one. However, most of these Pokemon don't like taking initial damage from Hidden Power Grass, and they can't threaten Golduck back aside from phazing it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Golduck can find opportunities to set up Calm Mind on Pokemon such as Omastar, Gligar, or Kangaskhan after it uses Rest. The threat of Calm Mind can prevent Kangaskhan from using Rest to stall Golduck, as +1 Hydro Pump 2HKOes specially defensive variants. It can also set up by forcing out a Rock- or Ground-type such as Solrock or Gligar, on which Golduck can enter with a double switch, after they KO Golduck's teammate, or after a teammate has used Explosion. Psychic is used to hit Poison-types that resist Water like Tentacruel, Vileplume, and Qwilfish. Hidden Power Grass is used for other Water-types, notably OHKOing Omastar and 2HKOing Gorebyss, which Golduck can revenge kill by ignoring Swift Swim. While Hydro Pump is Golduck's preferred STAB option, Golduck can also feasibly run Surf over Hidden Power Grass to have guaranteed accuracy against super effective targets while also preserving Hydro Pump's minimal 8 PP.</p> <p>A Timid nature allows Golduck to, at worst, speed tie with other base 85 Speed Pokemon like Gligar, Qwilfish, and Nidoking. A Modest Golduck hits harder with its coverage, allowing for reliable 2HKOs on Vileplume and Tentacruel and a 3HKO on Lanturn without boosts while still outspeeding Omastar, Gorebyss, and Vileplume.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Golduck fits well on hyper offensive teams as a Water-type setup sweeper that helps its frail teammates avoid being bowled over by weather sweepers. Golduck appreciates Spikes support from offensive spikers such as Qwilfish and Glalie, which lay as many layers of Spikes down as possible before they use Explosion to bring in an offensive teammate. Yawn Kangaskhan can create entry points for Golduck by threatening the opponent with sleep, which can force out or disable Electric-types and bulky Water-types that would give Golduck trouble when it sets up. Due to Golduck's difficult matchups against Electric-types, it appreciates Ground-types that reliably check them and keep up offensive pressure like Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Sandslash; Nidoqueen and Nidoking are fast wallbreakers with great coverage, whereas Sandslash is a Swords Dance sweeper with great physical bulk. In return, Golduck can adequately handle any Water-types that give these Pokemon trouble. If Golduck ever faints before it can complete a sweep, it appreciates a cleaner that can take advantage of the damage Golduck has done and revenge kill foes, such as Scyther, Arcanine, Haunter, or a fast Electric-type like Electrode.</p>"

  "Primeape": {
    "overview": "<p>Primeape can go on a rampage when given some breathing room. Its high Speed and power are nothing to scoff at. Its defenses, however, are really sub-par and will force Primeape to switch out or die more often than not. It relies heavily on sleep inflicting moves like Sleep Powder to come in, which is risky business. In both standard and UU, it can put a great hurting into teams, provided you know how to predict and eliminate its many counters.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Primeape can Overheat Skarmory, but its STAB Cross Chop and Focus Punch will be much more useful in other situations, and it's more of a one-time deal anyway as it sharply cuts your Special Attack. It won't even OHKO Skarmory (though Forretress and Scizor will be fried). Thunder or Thunderbolt work against Skarmory as well, and nothing else. Ice Punch, as idiotic as it seems, is good in UU because it hits Gligar and will usually 2HKO it. Thief can be used to steal Leftovers or Choice Band from something that walls you, comes handy in both standard and UU. Screech can force switches or cause massive damage from Cross Chop. With Taunt, you stop status from hitting you, but it's more likely that Primeape will be hit up straight on his weak defenses. This is why you may want to use Counter, with or without Taunt. Taunt / Counter Primeape can surprise the hell out of Gligar, Vileplume, Skarmory, Gyarados and some other things if they come into you.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>For every usual non-Reversal set, minimally 300 in standard to beat Adamant Salamence and everything else with 100 base Speed and no boosting nature. In UU, 296 is a nice number as well to beat Jolly Gligar (rare, but nice anyway), but 308 is preferable for Adamant Fearow and Jolly Kangaskhan. Use 264 Speed minimally for standard Reversal sets, and make sure your HP is not divisible by four when using Substitute with it. For the rest, Primeape should stack its Attack as much as possible.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>One great counter is Gligar, as it takes neutral damage or not very effective from all Primeape's attacks not named Ice Punch, and has decent Defense. Not a lot can switch in on Primeape in UU matches; utilizing two Pokemon to deal with Primeape is another method you could try. The Choice Band set will lose to a combination of Misdreavus and Muk or Vileplume. In all honesty the best way to beat Primeape is to attack it before it attacks you.</p>",

The IVs given are for Hidden Power Flying. Outside of that, there is little reason to use Hidden Power Flying, unless you really want to hurt Heracross and Breloom badly in standard.

There will always be something that walls you, but this set requires less prediction and can really screw opponents over in late game, or if they rely on something like Toxic to stop Primeape.</p>"},
      "Reversal": {"description": "<p>The fastest STAB Reversal in the game. Coming from a respective 339 Attack, Primeape can be quite a monster with this set, provided there is no Sand Stream up and no Quick Attack (or a similar move) in the way. Even if there is a Quick Attacker, Primeape can always switch out and come back later (as long as there are no Spikes) and launch its Reversal. It's unlikely that something like Quick Attack Fearow or Fake Out Kangaskhan is going to switch into that. Use Bulk Up for an easier set-up, or Focus Punch to do some good damage on something like Skarmory before it Drill Pecks you to death. Endure can be a safer route in some situations, and usually works better with Endure.</p>"}

  "Tentacruel": {
    "overview": "<p>Tentacruel is truly a Pokemon to be feared in UU, and can compete in standard as well. Its offensive power with Swords Dance-boosted Sludge Bombs combined with Hydro Pump tends to be just too much for teams in both tiers. However, Tentacruel can only really switch into fellow Water-types and perhaps Skarmory, because he has low Defense, and is weak to Thunderbolt and Earthquake, two of the most common attacks in the game. Psychic weakness doesn't help either. His immunity to Toxic and resistance to Water and Ice helps a lot though, it makes him a great counter to Milotic and Suicune in standard, as well as Blastoise and Walrein in UU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physical Hidden Power (most likely Ground, but Fighting works too) is Tentacruel's only real option for attacking, aside from Sludge Bomb, to take advantage of Swords Dance.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Usually Tentacruel should have 310 Speed in UU, unless it is a more defensive set, is an important point to hit, as the only used Pokemon that will be faster than you are the occasional Jolly Fearow, and Timid Manectric / Electabuzz. Hasty is the best nature for mixed sets, as Tentacruel's massive Special Defense is one of its major selling points, but if you're not using your Attack or Special Attack at all, Timid or Jolly should be used respectively. Stack the attacking stat(s) you're using on sweeping Tentacruel, otherwise you'll want to max out HP and put some in Special Defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Standard: Swampert is the best all-around counter for Tentacruel, as long as Tentacruel isn't packing the rare Giga Drain. It can soak up Sludge Bombs thanks to its resistance, and use its STAB Earthquake to dish out damage. Steels like Skarmory and Metagross get in the way when Tentacruel wants to sweep with Swords Dance, because Skarmory will Roar / Whirlwind away the boosts while Metagross will Earthquake. A few Surfs or Hydro Pumps should do them in though. Gengar is 4x resistant to Sludge Bomb and can Thunderbolt Tentacruel, but again, beware of Surf or Hydro Pump. Zapdos, Jolteon and Raikou may take quite some damage from a Swords Danced Sludge Bomb, but they're quite fast (Zapdos ties with Tentacruel, the other two are faster) and pack STAB Thunderbolts. Beware of Mirror Coat, however. Salamence and Gyarados can Earthquake Tentacruel and resist his Water moves, but their Intimidate won't work on Clear Body versions and Salamence has to watch out for Ice Beam.</p> <p>UU: Quagsire is an even better counter than Swampert because of Water Absorb, for the rest he works in the same way. Whiscash plays a mini-Swampert as well, but to a lesser extent. Hypno with some Defense EVs and Reflect can pose trouble, paralyzing Tentacruel with Thunder Wave or hitting hard with STAB Psychic. A Swords Danced Sludge Bomb will bang him up sooner or later though. Kangaskhan can take a beating and try for a paralysis with Body Slam or hit hard with Earthquake. Walrein can Earthquake, or Encore Substitute or Swords Dance, but again these Swords Danced Sludge Bombs hurt. For the rest, Tentacruel is pretty hard to beat in UU. Your best bet is hitting it hard when you can, preferably with Earthquake. If your team is full of physical offense, Psychic, and Thunderbolt, you can just make it impossible for Tentacruel to ever switch in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Druidcruel": {
        "description": "<p>Simple idea that works pretty well. Switch into something that will switch out once it sees Tentacruel and use Substitute. Wear down Steels, Rocks, and Grounds with Hydro Pump or Surf, and, later on, Swords Dance up and Sludge Bomb away. Works very well in standard, but really shines in UU, because about everything that resists Sludge Bomb is weak to your Water move. The main physical walls are Walrein (who cannot touch Tentacruel with the standard set of Rest, Sleep Talk, Toxic, Ice Beam), Gligar (who is OHKOed by a Water move), and Solrock (who is also OHKOed). In OU, you have stuff like Suicune with Roar, Weezing, Swampert, and the like around to ruin your fun.</p> <p>Surf has the obvious accuracy advantage over Hydro Pump (and the slightly less obvious PP advantage, but that's not that big of a deal, as the Water move's function is solely to hit a very limited number of Pokemon), but Hydro Pump's power can come in handy. With these EVs, Surf will never OHKO max HP Aggron, but Hydro Pump always will. Hydro Pump will easily OHKO Gligar, even if it has max HP, while Surf will always OHKO min HP Gligar, but bulkier versions will survive. Hydro Pump also just barely ekes out an OHKO on max HP Solrock.</p>"

      "Special Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Special Sweeping Tentacruel. Substitute is to bluff the first set, and allows you to get in a free hit on whatever switches in without risk. Absolutely owns some common counters to the standard Tentacruel (Swampert and Quagsire, Salamence etc.). Hidden Power Electric can be used as a fourth slot also to take care of Gyarados who can mess this set up pretty well otherwise. Mantine in UU cannot do much to Tentacruel, so usually you'll just want to keep Substitute. Try not to reveal that you are using a special Tentacruel until the surprise will get you a KO (Substitute and Surf / Hydro Pump should be the only moves you use at first).</p> <p>With Timid you can expect Tentacruel to outspeed everything of 105 base Speed and under as long as they don't have a Speed boosting nature (so Adamant Salamence and Modest Zapdos in OU, and Modest Manectric / Electabuzz in UU), and anything base 90 Speed or lower even if they have a +Speed nature (including Kangaskhan and Gligar), but with Modest you will have more attacking power. Just max out Speed if you go Modest, or, alternately, go as low as 280 Speed to beat Adamant Kangaskhan.</p>"
      },
      "Mirror Coat": {
        "description": "<p>The idea is to set up a Barrier or two, forcing them to attack you from Tentacruel's Special side. Usually this will draw out Electrics like Zapdos, and allow Tentacruel to Mirror Coat that STAB Thunderbolt right in their face. Tentacruel's Special Defense is pretty good, so just by maxing HP, you will survive even a max Special Attack Zapdos Thunderbolt as long as you're on full health. Giga Drain can be used to keep Quagsire and Swampert off your ass, but Toxic will stop them from stalling against you and either switch out or attack you straight up. Hydro Pump is there for some general STAB damage.</p> <p>While it looks nice on paper, it usually won't work that well. You'll find a lot of people trying to set up something like Substitute or Calm Mind from the likes of Raikou, Gengar and Alakazam on Tentacruel, which he cannot really do anything against. Sometimes they will just weaken with Tentacruel with something else, and then kill you with their Thunderbolt. Or they could repeatedly Earthquake you until it goes critical, which pierces Barrier's defense boost. Still, it can be very neat, and this set actually makes a decent Suicune counter, as even if it Calm Minds to the max, it won't OHKO with Surf and risk a Mirror Coat to the face, not to mention Toxic will keep forcing it to Rest.</p> <p>For UU, this might work against Lunatone or Manectric, but again beware of Substitute and Calm Mind.</p>"
      },
      "Utility": {"description": "<p>As mentioned in the previous set, Tentacruel can take special hits quite well, and this support set takes advantage of it. Come in on Waters (especially Cloyster) to Rapid Spin those Spikes away or to Toxic foes. Haze helps against Suicune's Calm Mind, or when Curse Snorlax is taking a nap. Note that Haze is illegal with Rapid Spin. Surf or Hydro Pump is there to hit Gengar who may try to block Rapid Spin and Toxic, but it won't do much against Dusclops or Misdreavus. Fillers like Mirror Coat and Sludge Bomb can be put in the last slot. The main problem with this Tentacruel set is that it's weak to many common attacks, and that Blastoise fills its role pretty much better in UU.</p>"}

  "Rapidash": {
    "overview": "<p>Rapidash suffers from being a Fire-type, having to compete with a lot of other Pokemon that all have the same syndrome: high Attack but no physical STAB, and no offensive movepool to speak of. Rapidash's redeeming factors are Baton Pass and Hypnosis mostly, so try to use these when using Rapidash. You really should only use Rapidash in UU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Quick Attack is present just to counter Pokemon with Reversal and the like. It can use Double Kick on a physical attacking set to open up room so you don't have to use Hidden Power Fighting, and this works against Substitute Tyranitar in standard to an extent.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Rapidash needs 307 Speed minimum to be faster than Jolly Kangaskhan, and a load of other UU threats like Gligar. This requires 244 Speed EVs without a nature, and, if you're going that high, you might as well max it out to go for the tie against other Rapidash, Modest Electabuzz, and Modest Manectric. Alternately, you can use a +Speed nature and bring yourself to 310 Speed, which still beats all Kangaskhan, but also outpaces the aforementioned Modest Electabuzz / Manectric, which requires 144 EVs and a +Speed nature. Most sets will then max one of the attacking stats, and then pump the rest of the EVs into the other attacking stat if you're using a mixed Rapidash, or HP if you are not. The Baton Passer should have more HP EVs than that, however.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Suicune and any other Water-type shuts it out. Dugtrio can actually survive anything Rapidash throws at it except Fire Blast, and then trap it and kill with Earthquake. Aerodactyl has the advantage of resisting Fire, is faster, and has two moves that can OHKO (Earthquake and Rock Slide). Salamence easily beats Rapidash without Hidden Power Ice, same for Dragonite. All these counters should be careful for Hypnosis, if it hits of course. In Underused matches other Fire-type Pokemon generally stop it dead, if you don't have Hidden Power Ice then Altaria counters Rapidash quite easily being resistant to Fire Blast and Solar Beam and Natural Cure takes care of Hypnosis. Walrein can stall it out with Toxic, thanks to Thick Fat, or just attack it outright with Surf, same goes for Blastoise. Quagsire beats Rapidash without Hidden Power Grass. Hypno can stall out anything but a Toxic variant. Cradily stops all but the Sunny Day set, and even that one can easily get PP stalled, because the chance to get a Critical Hit is small with only 8 Fire Blast PP, and Flamethrower won't do enough.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {"description": "<p>Hypnosis is an option on this set if your opponent doesn't have a Pokemon that Rapidash can scare off (like Skarmory), giving you a free turn to set up a Substitute / Agility. Fire Blast will keep Skarmory and Weezing from erasing your boosts, so you can Substitute as they go to, say, Blissey, and then Baton Pass that Substitute to Gengar and Focus Punch it. Obviously, this set works in UU as well.</p> <p>You may not need as many Speed EVs if you are using Agility, but it might come handy to get in that crucial Hypnosis or Hidden Power. The IVs given are for Hidden Power Ice, which should generally only be used in OU, as Hidden Power Grass is more important to hit Waters like Blastoise, Walrein, and Quagsire there.</p>"},
      "SunnyBeam": {"description": "<p>It doesn't have the best Special Attack stat, but can catch your opponent by surprise. Hypnosis is still effective vs. Pokemon with Natural Cure like Blissey. Sunny Day as they come in, Hypnosis. If they stay in, they have to eat boosted Fire Blasts, and if they switch out, they're switching to something that isn't their main special wall, so if they try and come back in, you can just use Hypnosis again on them. Hidden Power Ice hits Salamence in OU, but the main Pokemon for which it's used in UU, is Gligar, who is OHKOed by Fire Blast, and almost always OHKOed by Flamethrower anyway, so Hypnosis is probably better. Sunny Day keeps Rapidash safe from Surf as it attacks.</p> <p>Once again, the IVs are only if you choose Hidden Power Ice.</p>"},
      "Mixed Attacker": {"description": "<p>Hypnosis is to put whatever Pokemon that is giving the team trouble to Sleep. Then, just use whatever attacks it needs to take it down. You'll have to deal with the limited movepool Rapidash provides for you. Overheat any Steel-types that come your way. Iron Tail any Rocks like Solrock. Pick whichever Hidden Power your team needs. Hidden Power Rock and Fighting are useful to take on Walrein just a little better.</p>"}

  "Muk": {
    "overview": "<p>In UU, Muk is very hard to beat if you don't know the set. I recommend Muk for any UU team. It also has a very high cool factor.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>EVs</h3> <p>When you are running no special attacks, at least 401 HP on Muk, 404 if you are using Substitute. Adamant for the SubPuncher, Careful for the Curser, with EVs focused on the stats you are boosting (Attack and Special Defense respectively).</p> <p>For mixed movesets, use a speed-cutting nature: Brave for more Attack, Sassy for more Special Defense.</p> <p>As you see, Muk is quite hard to spread EVs for, so if you're having a lot of trouble you can just use max HP and Attack and you'll be just fine.</p> <h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam can paralyze the opponent, and paralysis is always good. Imprison is very unorthodox and works in very rare circumstances, stay away from it until you've tried out the standard Muk. Memento can make your opponent's Pokemon harmless, so you can set up a Belly Drummer next turn. Explosion is more recommended for suicide, though. Rest, with or without Sleep Talk, makes your Muk live longer. It's really an easy switch for counters though.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Muk is hard to counter. Its first set isn't shut down by anything completely, except Misdreavus and Shedinja if you run Hidden Power Grass, or Quagsire / Whiscash if you have Hidden Power Ghost. Nidoking and Nidoqueen can take one or two Ice Punches and Earthquake Muk to death.</p>",

There's no need for Special Attack EVs as you need more EVs in Special Attack than it's worth to OHKO either Gligar or Quagsire.

  "Hypno": {
    "overview": "<p>A good UU Pokemon would be an understatement. It is top tier UU for a reason: it walls special hits over and over, takes physical hits moderately well, and supports your team with pseudo-passing moves such as Reflect, Light Screen, and Wish. It can switch into so many things in the UU metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hypnosis could work to put Pokemon to sleep. Hypno definitely has the defenses to survive a miss or two, unlike many other Pokemon that learn Hypnosis. Light Screen helps because it protects the rest of your teams against Special hits without having to switch in Hypno. Fire Punch might work in very rare cases, but it'd be more fit if you battle against standard Pokemon such as Steelix and Metagross.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>On both movesets, you will pretty much want to pump HP and Defenses. Try and get your Speed somewhere above 176 to beat Solrock and Lunatone. Put some EVs in Special Attack if you have Psychic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Even with Reflect, Gligar and Ground Pokemon in general will switch into Hypno's Thunder Waves easily and get a free hit on whatever switches in. Banette is a bit risky because you don't want it to take a Thunder Wave, but it deals a ton of damage with its STAB Shadow Ball.

If you're using this, you will most likely switch in on something that has the potential to use a sleeping move or hit you with a special attack. While not being much of an offensive guy, it takes special hits like few others in UU. Psychic and Seismic Toss both work. It really depends though, do you want something that can hit Pokemon such as Gligar harder, or being able to stop Pokemon with Substitute from setting up as easily? It's up to you and your overall team. If you use Protect, use it with Toxic to further stall turns, but both Toxic and Thunder Wave can be used with Reflect. Use Counter with Toxic, as well, because it really ruins a perfect prediction to have them fully paralyzed when you Counter, thus destroying the surprise.</p>"

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "overview": "<p>Kangaskhan is one of the most used Pokemon in the UnderUsed environment. Bulky defenses, high HP, above-average Speed, high Attack with a fantastic movepool and Normal STAB makes Kangaskhan very dangerous. Kangaskhan can be difficult to stop; more than one resist is often necessary to handle it. When building your UU team, make sure that your team can handle Kangaskhan!</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam can be used as your Normal move for Paralysis. Roar can stop random stat uppers, especially the odd UU BP team (as Mr. Mime cannot stand up to STAB Returns to block your Roar), and Yawn works as a sort of pseudo-phazing move.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Near max HP and a lot of Attack in the first set, with the rest in Speed. On the Choice Band set, just max out Attack and Speed. On the Reversal set, max out Attack to ensure that Reversal can do a decent amount of damage. Speed will have to be 264 in OU, with an Adamant nature, but in UU, you can use much lower speeds, such as 251 to beat an Electrode without +Speed, or even less, depending on just how much you fear Electrode. The remainder of EVs should go into either Defense. Use no HP EVs so that you end up with 1% after 4 Substitutes, instead of 25% after 3, or Reversal will be much weaker. Of course, the extra EVs elsewhere will do virtually nothing, so you'll most likely just want to max your Speed to keep other Salac Pokemon from outspeeding you.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Often more than one Rock-type is needed to fully stop Kangaskhan. A bulky Omastar can handle it, Reflect Solrock can handle it. Golem, which is rather uncommon, can switch into it and scare off Kangaskhan, unless it is of course packing Earthquake or Focus Punch. Walrein and Blastoise can easily stall it with Rest and Toxic, unless it's holding a Choice Band. If it has a Choice Band, you'll need to use resists.</p>",

Wish is also an option; with some defensive EVs, Kangaskhan can be bulky, which will allow it to be an effective Wish-passer. Watch out for status.</p>"},
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Kangaskhan is no Slaking, but it can act as a Choice Bander quite well. Its Speed is rather high in UU to pull this off. Because Focus Punch hits very few things in UU, Fake Out can be used to stop Pokemon with Substitute and a Salac, or just for a little bit of extra damage against a Pokemon you normally couldn't take. However, Focus Punch can be useful to predict Walrein and Cradily, and guarantees an OHKO on Aggron, who can potentially survive your Earthquake only to Counter it back.</p>"},
      "Wish Staller": {"description": "<p>This set simply refuses to die, as very few things can do enough to Kangaskhan to overcome Wish and 2 turns of Leftovers for each hit, and those few Pokemon (for instance, Hitmonlee) often have very low Defense, letting your STAB Normal hit them hard. It's completely walled by Aggron, but Wish support lets Pokemon like Gligar switch into that all day. Counter can stop that nicely, but you risk being Thunder Waved or having Aggron just set up a Substitute. You could also stick Roar on there over Protect or Return if you have some Spikes down for even more stall. You may want to focus on more Special Defense if you have Counter to ensure that Counter KOs the opponent when they use a physical attack.</p>"},

  "Scyther": {
    "overview": "<p>Scyther is an excellent offensive Pokemon with one of the highest Speed stats in the tier and an exceptional base 110 Attack. It capitalizes on the progress made by its teammates, allowing it to function as a wallbreaker, revenge killer, cleaner, and sweeper. Scyther's sheer power with its STAB moves lets it 2HKO or 3HKO many relevant Pokemon, such as Kangaskhan, Tentacruel, Ampharos, Solrock, and Vileplume. Swarm punishes any Pokemon swinging at it, as its bulk lets it dodge an OHKO from most neutral attacks, like Kangaskhan's Double-Edge. Scyther works very well on offense and balance teams that uphold Spikes pressure and need a backbone of fast offense and priority, and this makes it one of the best late-game Pokemon.</p> <p>Scyther can, however, have a lack of longevity, as it has weaknesses to common attacking types in Electric, Ice, Fire, and Rock, and it hates being statused by paralysis and Toxic. Choice Band sets can end up being reliant on prediction, and they can allow more Pokemon to gain entry. It can be hard to find entry for Scyther due to its reliance on being kept healthy late-game and its common switch-ins forcing its team to play on the defensive, only coming in through Ground-type moves, double switches, or revenge kills.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fighting can be used on the Choice Band set over Hidden Power Ground to hit all of Cradily, Granbull, and Walrein on the switch in. Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit Flying-types like Altaria while maintaining coverage for Arcanine and Walrein as they switch in. Both Hidden Power choices lower Scyther's Speed IVs, which guarantees opposing base 105 Speed Pokemon can revenge kill it, so Hidden Power Ground, Bug, and Flying are preferable choices. On Reversal sets, Salac Berry can be substituted for Liechi Berry to make Reversal stronger, but this comes at the cost of risking the Speed tie against base 105 Speed foes and being too slow to avoid a revenge kill from Electrode and Ninjask.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Omastar can comfortably switch into Scyther with its Normal and Flying resistances coupled with its sky-high Defense, and it can aptly pressure with Surf or lay down Spikes. Aggron and Golem pose similar problems and can OHKO Scyther with Rock STAB attacks. Although Aggron fears Hidden Power Ground, Omastar and Golem can tank it at least a few times. Other Rock-types like Cradily and Solrock can come in on moves they resist and threaten Scyther back, but they have trouble dealing with Hidden Power Bug.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Altaria and Gligar can both defensively check Scyther with their great bulk, Bug-type resistance, and Spikes immunity while also offensively checking Scyther with super effective coverage. Altaria is very bulky and uses Scyther as an opportunity to use Heal Bell, and it can use Roar on Swords Dance Scyther, forcing it to start the process all over again. Gligar can gain turns to set up its own Swords Dance boosts, hits back hard with Hidden Power Flying, and has priority to beat Salac Reversal sets. Both still need to take caution against Choice Band variants, as Hidden Power Flying and Double-Edge can 2HKO Gligar and non-physically defensive Altaria.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Ampharos is a mixed wall that zaps Scyther with a strong STAB Thunderbolt and can come in on Scyther's contact moves, potentially paralyzing it through Static. While other Electric-types lack Ampharos's bulk, they can Speed tie Scyther or outspeed in the case of Electrode.</p> <p><strong>Walrein</strong>: Walrein is a bulky wall that can threaten Scyther with its STAB Ice Beam, and it can phaze out any attempts of sweeping with Swords Dance through Encore or Roar.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate Users</strong>: Granbull and Arcanine’s Intimidate softens the blow of Scyther’s moves and forces Scyther's team to play on the defensive. Arcanine has a brutal STAB Fire Blast, resists Hidden Power Bug, and has priority to stuff any revenge kills at low health and stop Scyther from Reversal sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Electrode and Ninjask can reliably revenge kill Scyther and can use their entry as an opportunity for their own offense.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Scyther is the most common set for its immediate power and ability to revenge kill fast Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Tentacruel. Scyther also has an incredible max Speed of 339, which is only outsped by Electrode and Ninjask, rivaling its Choice Band user competition like Fearow, Nidoking, and Hitmonlee.</p> <p>Hidden Power Bug is Scyther's main STAB attack for hitting neutral targets and is very powerful when Scyther is in Swarm range. It also provides coverage for Psychic-types, like Slowking and Solrock, and it can be used as a way to avoid contact abilities like Static. Double-Edge provides a very powerful neutral hit to most targets, including Flying-types like Gligar and Altaria, and its recoil can be helpful in pushing Scyther into Swarm range for a boosted Hidden Power Bug. Aerial Ace hits opposing Scyther, Vileplume, Ghost-types like Haunter and Misdreavus, and Fighting-types like Hitmontop. Quick Attack provides very useful priority against Reversal sweepers like opposing Scyther, serves as an additional check to chipped weather sweepers like Sunny Day Vileplume and Rain Dance Gorebyss, and helps check other priority from Arcanine. Silver Wind and Hidden Power Flying can be used as alternatives to Hidden Power Bug and Aerial Ace. This gives Scyther less contact moves, a stronger Flying STAB attack, and access to possible omniboosts with Silver Wind. Using both Silver Wind and Aerial Ace allows Scyther to use another Hidden Power over Double-Edge, such as Hidden Power Ground for Arcanine and Electric-, Rock-, and Steel-types that like to come in on Choice Band Scyther.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Scyther fits well onto Spikes offense with Omastar and Qwilfish. Spikes help Scyther break through bulky Pokemon more easily and wears down its checks as they switch in. Omastar is also a physical wall that can help to check Kangaskhan, Granbull, and opposing Scyther. Since Scyther is very status-prone, cleric Pokemon like Ampharos, Vileplume, and Altaria can heal off any stray Toxic or paralysis thrown at it. Scyther also appreciates a check to Arcanine, such as Tentacruel or Blastoise. Scyther is less effective at wallbreaking after Intimidate, and these teammates allow for safe switch-ins and can remove Spikes for Scyther's team. Lanturn can resist any BoltBeam coverage thrown Scyther's way from Electric-types, Walrein, offensive Omastar, and special attacking Ghost-types. Pokemon that block Rapid Spin, like Haunter and Misdreavus, help keep Spikes on the opposing side of the field and provide valuable offensive utility, such as Haunter's Thief, Will-O-Wisp, and Destiny Bond and Misdreavus's Thunder Wave.</p>"

      "Salac Reversal": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Salac Reversal Scyther is a dangerous late-game sweeper that is nearly impossible to stop without a priority move post-Speed boost. The choice of Hidden Power is mostly up to personal preference; Hidden Power Bug is boosted by Swarm and hits Psychic-types hard, while Hidden Power Flying has better coverage for Poison- and Ghost-types. Substitute is used to bring Scyther's HP down to 1% and capitalize on switches, allowing Scyther to use Swords Dance behind the Substitute. Scyther's HP cannot be divisible by 4 for Substitute sets to activate Salac Berry, so 4 EVs should be put into HP to make four Substitutes and for Reversal to be at maximum power. Endure allows Scyther to reliably get into Salac Berry range even if it took damage prior, lets it take hits from faster Pokemon, and gives it more freedom to set up Swords Dance at least once against most targets, since it is rarely OHKOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Salac Reversal Scyther fits very well onto hyper offense teams, as it can outspeed and sweep every Pokemon without priority, and it can force damage onto bulkier targets. It can generally force the removal of at least one Pokemon for sweeper teammates to capitalize on. This Scyther set appreciates Spikes set early in the match for it to sweep more easily, benefitting from leads such as Qwilfish and Glalie that get as many layers of Spikes as possible then use Explosion to keep up momentum. Scyther also loves support that helps it enter freely, such as Yawn Kangaskhan, to force a switch or give Scyther a way to prey on the slept Pokemon. Explosion users, such as Electrode, Solrock, Haunter, and Muk, fit well as teammates, as they can remove key Pokemon for Scyther to make a full sweep or at least provide valuable chip if Explosion fails to KO, as well as giving free entry for Scyther. Since Arcanine and Gligar stand in the way of Reversal Scyther's sweep, it appreciates offensive teammates that force damage onto them early, such as Arcanine, offensive Kangaskhan, and Water-types like Gorebyss, Golduck, and Feraligatr. Ground-types like Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Sandslash can check opposing Electric-types that threaten Scyther while making significant progress of their own.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance Scyther is a fast setup sweeper that can clean up late-game with its STAB moves and Hidden Power Ground as well as break holes in the opposition for teammates to capitalize on and clean up.</p> <p>Scyther prefers dual STAB moves on Swords Dance sets, usually using Silver Wind and Aerial Ace. Silver Wind is its primary STAB move, giving it access to dangerous omniboosts, and it is further boosted when Scyther is in Swarm range. Aerial Ace allows for useful coverage against various Flying-, Fighting-, and Ghost-types like Gligar, Haunter, Misdreavus, and Hitmontop. These options free up a slot for Hidden Power Ground for hitting Poison-, Rock-, and Steel-types like Nidoqueen, Nidoking, Omastar, and Aggron. Alternatively, Quick Attack gives Scyther a priority move if it can forgo the coverage of Hidden Power Ground, allowing access to a Hidden Power with STAB.</p> <p>The item choice can be team-dependent but is mostly up to preference. Leftovers helps Scyther passively heal any damage it takes and have more longevity, while Lum Berry is used when Scyther doesn't have cleric support and lets it set up in the face of Toxic or paralysis that would otherwise shut down any chance Scyther has at sweeping.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes support from Omastar and Qwilfish helps Swords Dance Scyther muscle past bulky Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Ampharos, and Walrein. Thief support from Omastar, Tentacruel, Arcanine, Haunter, and Electabuzz further facilitates the sweep by removing Leftovers from defensive Pokemon that rely on passive recovery, meaning the damage they take from Scyther's boosted moves and Spikes will be permanent. Bulky Water-types like Tentacruel, Walrein, and Lanturn synergize well, as they can threaten Omastar, Arcanine, Altaria, and Walrein, which can otherwise stand in the way of Scyther's sweep, and they are good at making progress for Scyther to take advantage of. Fearow and Gligar make for good partners, as they are fast mid-game wallbreakers that can back up Scyther's general lack of priority and make for a brutal one-two punch of Flying offense.</p>"

You could use Barrier to try and make Electabuzz survive a little longer / survive a STAB Earthquake and Counter it back for a quick kill. Thief is just an awesome move. Steal Leftovers from the most annoying staller you can find and laugh.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>You'll need at least 244 Speed EVs to hit 307, beating Jolly Kangaskhan. Alternately, you could use 136 Speed EVs with a +Speed nature. Give it -Attack or -Defense, depending on whether you are using a Fighting move. Put the rest in Attack and Special Attack, always focusing more on Special Attack. The only time you're going to want to put some in Defense is for the last set, where you should focus on Defense, HP and Special Attack, with a little bit in its mediocre Special Defense, making it either Modest or Timid. A +Speed nature is almost exclusively to beat out Fearow, a very deadly UU Choice Bander. Otherwise, Electabuzz beats mostly the same things regardless of nature.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Grumpig and Hypno are easily able to switch into it with their beefy Special defense and Muk is quite useful, seeing as it will soak up any of Electabuzz's moves with its HP. You might also try Lanturn and Ampharos, as Electabuzz is unable to really put a big dent into them, due to their resistance to most of Electabuzz's moves, and high Special Defense stats. Meganium and Vileplume could put up a fight, despite being weak to one of its moves.</p>",

Both work on Grumpig, either take away its Leftovers (and do a cool base 40 super effective attack) or Toxic it, either way, it's going to have a lot more trouble stopping you. Watch out for Thieving from Grumpig, however, as it might be a Trickbanding variant (if it tries to Trick right away, though, you'll just steal the Choice Band, and it will Trick it right back onto itself, so you do a 40 power Super Effective move for free).

It hits hard and fast, doesn't have that prominent 4x Flying weakness that Heracross has, and has got a great movepool. Pinsir suffers the most from not having a decent STAB attack, but, with the element of surprise backing, he can be a worthwhile investment. It has the advantage of not being walled by Solrock, and has a likely 2HKO with Rock Slide or Brick Break on Walrein with a Choice Band set, same for Return on Gligar, which are the 3 main physical walls used in UU. The Swords Dancer also has the ability to set up on almost anything in a UU team, and Solrock can't come out to try and abuse your weakness to Rock due to the threat of Hidden Power Bug.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>It's just a shame Pinsir doesn't get Counter anymore. Oh well, Revenge is partial compensation for that. Bulk Up is a decent alternative to Swords Dance. You could try a Rest + Sleep Talk set, because Earthquake and Hidden Power Bug covers most everything but Gligar that's seen on most teams, and Pinsir has a lot of durability. Double-Edge can be used over Return in case Gligar gets really defensive.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>You'll want an Adamant nature most of the time, but sometimes, Jolly can get you just enough Speed to put you above foes like Kangaskhan and enemy Gligar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fearow can come in on Earthquake or Hidden Power Bug and OHKO with Choice Band Drill Peck. Golem has high defenses and STAB Rock Slide to take Pinsir out. Ninetales, Magmar, and Rapidash resist Hidden Power Bug and have STAB on Flamethrower, but Earthquake or Rock Slide will spell their end. Gligar can take on any Pinsir save those with Choice Band Return, and even then has a chance to win, depending on who's faster. Be sure to carry a Quick Attacker / Mach Puncher, however, or the Flailing Pinsir will sweep you, unless you have Misdreavus, or if a Pokemon you have can counter the specific set Pinsir runs. Aggron and Golem can do this for Hidden Power Bug Flailers and Solrock works well against Pinsir that run Earthquake as their secondary offensive move.</p>",

Most of Pinsir's counters will 2HKO it, so the damage from their hit will usually put Pinsir into Salac range, so that's a decent item, even without Endure, but Leftovers gives more longevity.</p>"},

If you have Substitute, you can use that to block status, but you can't switch it in to any attack, and it can be harder to pull off a Swords Dance. Flail will seriously hurt things when you are at 1%, and then you have a choice between Earthquake and Hidden Power Bug. Hidden Power Bug hits Solrock and Lunatone, but Earthquake hits Golem, Aggron, and Omastar.

  "Omastar": {
    "overview": "<p>Omastar is widely regarded as one of the best Pokemon in UU due to its excellent defensive and offensive qualities. Omastar's access to Spikes is incredibly important for virtually every playstyle, and it finds itself to be the easiest Spikes setter to fit on teams due to its great Defense and decent defensive typing in Water / Rock, which gives it useful resistances to Flying- and especially Normal-type moves; these traits also make it one of the best leads in the metagame and a solid check to powerful Pokemon like Scyther, Fearow, and Kangaskhan. Additionally, Omastar's sky-high Special Attack prevents it from being completely passive when running defensive sets, threatening most of the Pokemon it checks with a strong, STAB-boosted Surf, and allows it to become an extremely deadly rain sweeper when paired with Swift Swim that can completely decimate teams once its checks have been taken down. However, while Water / Rock does provide some handy resistances, it also gives Omastar very common weaknesses to Grass-, Electric-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves, making it more difficult for it to consistently check Pokemon like Choice Band Granbull and Kangaskhan and lessening its effectiveness as a check to Fire-types like Ninetales, since they often run Grass-type coverage. Omastar also suffers from poor special bulk, meaning strong neutral or super effective special attacks will often severely cripple or outright KO it. Omastar's lack of reliable recovery and vulnerability to status don't help it either, since Leftovers can instantly be negated by poison or burn and offensive sets detest being paralyzed due to their reliance on outspeeding foes. Omastar is also extremely slow without Swift Swim, so it often must take a hit before it can do anything.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Electric may 3HKO Tentacruel depending on the set Omastar is running and lets it deter Tentacruel without having to worry about Hydro Pump's unreliable accuracy. However, using Hidden Power Electric over Hidden Power Grass leaves Omastar vulnerable to Lanturn and Quagsire. RestTalk improves Omastar's longevity and also prevents it from being worn down by status, but it makes Omastar more passive and leaves it setup fodder for Pokemon like Slowking.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rapid Spin Users</strong>: Rapid Spin users such as Tentacruel, Blastoise, and Hitmontop are able to remove Spikes from their side of the field and deal with Omastar in their own ways. Tentacruel is a fantastic counter to Omastar in general, since it has great special bulk, resists both Water-type STAB move options and Ice Beam, is neutral to Hidden Power Grass, is immune to Toxic, and can 2HKO Omastar with Hydro Pump or OHKO it with Giga Drain. While Hitmontop is the least effective of the Rapid Spin users and does not resist Omastar's attacks, it can inflict poison to Omastar with Toxic and wear it down with Brick Break.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Walrein, Lanturn, and Slowking are 3HKOed at best by Hidden Power Grass and are able to take down Omastar with their STAB moves or through other methods. Walrein can 3HKO it with Surf or inflict it with Toxic. Lanturn can paralyze Omastar with Thunder Wave and has a STAB in Thunderbolt to OHKO Omastar. Slowking can easily tank a Hidden Power Grass before a Calm Mind boost, use Omastar as setup fodder, and OHKO it at +2. If Omastar does not have Hidden Power Grass, Quagsire, although fairly uncommon, can completely wall it and threaten to 3HKO it with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Due to Omastar's 4x weakness to Grass, Grass-types such as Vileplume and Meganium pose a massive threat to it; the former also threatens to immobilize Omastar with Sleep Powder. However, these Pokemon are weak to Ice Beam, so they aren't always reliable answers.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Electabuzz, Manectric, and Electrode are all very fast and threaten to OHKO Omastar with their super effective STAB moves, which make them huge problems. However, these Pokemon are all frail and would never want to take a STAB Hydro Pump from Rain Dance Omastar.</p> <p><strong>Status Ailments</strong>: Poison and burn will instantly negate Leftovers recovery and quickly wear down Omastar due to its lack of reliable recovery. Rain Dance Omastar strongly detests being paralyzed, since that means that even under rain it will fail to outspeed many threats, most notably Electric-types like Electabuzz.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: While special walls such as Hypno and Kangaskhan still take a large chunk of damage from a rain- and STAB-boosted Hydro Pump, they are still able to stall out Rain Dance turns and Hydro Pump PP with Wish and Protect. Hypno and Kangaskhan don't fear anything from offensive and defensive Spikes sets apart from Thief and Toxic, and they can inflict Omastar with Toxic of their own to take it down. However, they do not do much to prevent Spikes from being set up.</p>",

      "Defensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Spikes is an incredibly powerful support tool, since it wears down grounded foes every time they switch in, limiting their opportunities while also making it easier for Omastar's teammates to take down bulkier threats. STAB Surf lets Omastar take down Fire-, Ground-, and Rock-types like Ninetales, Gligar, and Lunatone. Toxic cripples and stacks offensive pressure on most Pokemon that try to switch into Omastar, which gives it more opportunities to set Spikes. Protect helps Omastar rack up Toxic damage, gives it a turn of free Leftovers recovery, and allows it to scout for super effective attacks. Hidden Power Grass is an option to threaten an OHKO on opposing Omastar while also hitting other Water-types like Blastoise, Lanturn, and Quagsire. Another option is Ice Beam to take down Scyther and Altaria, which could become dangerous if not taken care of, and prevent Grass-types like Vileplume from freely switching in.</p> <p>Maximum HP and Defense EVs with a Bold nature let Omastar take multiple Earthquakes from Kangaskhan lacking Choice Band and use it as setup fodder for Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Omastar's lack of reliable recovery, it has to worry about being worn down by Spikes and status, especially poison. Thus, Rapid Spin users like Tentacruel, Blastoise, and Hitmontop are useful teammates. In particular, Tentacruel's resistance to Water, neutrality to Grass-type moves, and immunity to Toxic are very helpful. Moreover, clerics such as Granbull and Vileplume make for great allies. Specifically, Granbull has Intimidate to weaken physical attackers and Thunder Wave to slow down fast Pokemon, and Vileplume has useful resistances to Water, Grass, Electric, and Fighting as well as Sleep Powder to immobilize critical threats. Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Banette can block Rapid Spin to keep Omastar's Spikes from being removed, making them useful partners. Grass- and Electric-types like Vileplume and Electabuzz are very dangerous to Omastar, so Pokemon that can check them such as Muk, Cradily, and Camerupt are good choices for their defensive synergy. Wish passers such as Hypno and Kangaskhan are very helpful to increase Omastar's longevity, due to its aforementioned lack of reliable recovery. They can also make use of Protect and Toxic to rapidly wear down foes in combination with Omastar's Spikes. Hypno is an especially synergistic teammate due to its resistance to Fighting-type moves and good special bulk. Lastly, strong attackers such as Scyther and Kangaskhan greatly appreciate Spikes support, since it wears down several common checks and counters and makes bulkier threats much easier to take down.</p>"

Surf is the STAB move of choice due to its higher accuracy and PP over Hydro Pump. Ice Beam takes down Pokemon like Scyther and Altaria as well as Grass-types such as Vileplume, Meganium, and Shiftry. Thief is Omastar's only way of doing anything significant to one of its strongest counters, Tentacruel, taking away its Leftovers and leaving it much more prone to being worn down by Spikes and chip damage. Hidden Power Grass allows Omastar to OHKO opposing Omastar leads and prevents it from being walled by Quagsire.</p> <p>Maximum HP investment and 12 Defense EVs make Omastar as bulky as possible without sacrificing speed and power. 28 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature guarantee an OHKO with Hidden Power Grass against opposing Omastar leads, which is a critical matchup to win. 216 Speed EVs let Omastar outspeed uninvested base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Meganium.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is one of the best leads for offensive teams due to its combination of good defenses and high power, which let it win the mirror matchup, prevent it from being passive, and allow it to fire off hard hits to weaken threats for its teammates. Since this set should primarily be used on offensive teams, Pokemon that appreciate Omastar's ability to easily set up Spikes early-game such as Electabuzz, Nidoking, and Scyther are excellent partners, as it turns many 3HKOs into 2HKOs, notably giving Nidoking a chance to win against Walrein after two layers of Spikes. Omastar's team needs Spikes to stay up as long as possible, so Rapid Spin users such as Blastoise, Hitmontop, and especially Tentacruel are very problematic. Electric-types such as Electabuzz and Manectric can threaten Blastoise and Tentacruel for Omastar with their super effective STAB moves; Kangaskhan also makes a very good answer to Tentacruel, since it usually runs Earthquake. Meanwhile, Psychic-types such as Hypno and Lunatone can check Hitmontop, as they can tank Brick Break and Hidden Power Ghost and put it down with Psychic. Spinblockers such as Misdreavus and Banette are also useful partners, but due to their mediocre-at-best bulk, they have to watch out for STAB Hydro Pump from Tentacruel and Hidden Power Ghost from Hitmontop.</p>"

Hydro Pump is preferred over Surf on this set due to its significantly higher power, allowing Omastar to grab many KOs more easily at the cost of lower PP and unreliable accuracy. Ice Beam threatens to KO Flying-types like Fearow, Altaria, and Scyther and Grass-types like Vileplume and Meganium. Hidden Power Grass makes Omastar a more consistent sweeper, preventing it from being defenseless against Quagsire and giving it a better matchup against other Water-types like Blastoise. Although using Spikes over Hidden Power Grass can make Omastar a less effective sweeper, it is still an excellent tool to ease sweeping for Omastar's team and can lull the opponent into a false sense of security about its moveset.</p> <p>Mystic Water raises the power of Hydro Pump and allows Omastar to OHKO Pokemon like Hypno and Cradily under rain if three layers of Spikes have been set up. Instead of opting for the power of Mystic Water, Omastar can use Leftovers to increase its longevity. Lum Berry prevents Omastar from being crippled by poison, burn, and especially paralysis, which ensures that Omastar always outspeeds the entire metagame under rain.</p> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Modest nature is chosen to maximize the power of Omastar's attacks and let it outspeed the entire metagame under rain. Omastar can run as low as 96 Speed EVs to invest into defenses, which would let Omastar survive a Hidden Power Grass from Walrein and still allows it to outspeed Scyther and most Electric-types under rain, although this leaves Omastar more vulnerable outside of rain, since Pokemon like Lunatone will be able to outspeed it and hit it with Psychic or Hypnosis, and also means that it will be unable to outrun Electrode under rain, which can threaten to OHKO it with STAB Thunderbolt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Despite Omastar's high damage output under rain, it is walled by bulky Water-types such as Tentacruel, Walrein, and Lanturn, so Electric-types like Electabuzz and Manectric and Grass-types like Vileplume make for good teammates. Vileplume is notable in that it has access to Aromatherapy, which helps offset Omastar's vulnerability to status, particularly Thunder Wave. Baton Passing Calm Mind boosts is very helpful for Omastar, making its already powerful attacks even stronger and helping it tank special attacks; therefore, Hypno and Lunatone can be valuable partners. Hypno notably has good special bulk, resists Fighting-type moves, and has access to Wish to alleviate Omastar's lack of reliable recovery, although Wish and Baton Pass cannot be used together. Choice Band Nidoking and other Ground-types with Choice Band also make for good teammates, since the bulky Water-types that can stop Omastar from sweeping will be significantly weakened if they are forced to take a Choice Band-boosted Earthquake. These Ground-types can also serve as pivots for Electric-type attacks aimed at Omastar.</p>"

Confuse Ray can give you a bit more time to sweep. Body Slam has the chance to paralyze the target, which can also be useful.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Kabutops need a Speed stat of at least 264 for the Endure set. Rain Dance Kabutops only needs 8 Speed EVs to get it at 198. Swords Dance versions might want to get the maximum amount of Speed Kabutops can get. Maximum Attack is always good on Kabutops as well. Don't use a nature that lowers Kabutop's Special Attack if you plan on using a special attack, since its Special Attack is already below-average. If you're using Substitute with Flail, make sure your HP is not divisible by 4 so you are able to Substitute four times and maximize Flail's power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Golem, Solrock, and Aggron counter most of Kabutops's sets because of their high Defense. but they are all weak to Surf. Kabutops cannot really hit Meganium and KO it quickly, so Meganium can Counter an attack back or KO it outright. Blastoise has good defensive stats, and because it is a Water-type, Kabutops cannot get around its Defense without being hit hard by it. Hypno can wall Kabutops fairly well because of Wish, Reflect, and its ability to status Kabutops. However, if Kabutops removes Hypno's Leftovers with Knock Off, it has a chance to put a dent in Hypno.

Rock Slide is a good move in general and a good STAB attack to have. Hidden Power Ground can hit Steel-types.

Ice Beam is a decent option on any set, but only really for Flygon in standard (and of course it is in the uber set).

Also, Toxic is a great option in the Underused environment due to the absence of viable Heal Bellers and Aromatherapists.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Lanturn's HP is plentiful enough; it gains better defensive capabilities if you stack its defenses. 404 HP is required if you use Substitute; 401 will do otherwise. Usually it doesn't need Defense since it's mostly a special wall, so focus on Special Defense. It is desperate for Special Attack EVs for hurting anything. Use Calm or Modest nature.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Quagsire, due to Water Absorb and Electric immunity. Light Screen Meganium will outstall Lanturn even it has Ice Beam.

    "overview": "<p>Xatu's main problem is that its typing gives it a weakness to Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Rock Slide, and it doesn't resist Normal. It does have that great 4x Fighting resist and Earthquake immunity, but since most Pokemon with either of these moves will also have at least one of Rock Slide, Shadow Ball, Return, or Hidden Power Ghost, Xatu can't even abuse its resistances to switch in, unless the enemy has a Choice Band.</p> <p>Grumpig or Hypno are usually a better choice if you want a supporter, Gligar takes on Pokemon that carry Fighting moves better, and Hypno is infinitely better at support. Xatu is simply outclassed by so many Pokemon, it's rarely worth the effort. At least it can come in on Choice Band Earthquakes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Water is an option for Tyranitar in OU, and Hidden Power Fire hits Metagross and Skarmory. Xatu resists Fighting x4, so if you give it Quick Attack, it can be a Reversal counter. Xatu's Attack isn't much worse than its Special Attack, so you could try out physical attacks on it, but then you're just a worse Fearow except for your Fighting resist. Xatu can use Hidden Power Ice to get a surprise OHKO on Gligar, something Hypno and Grumpig can't do without taking a Swords Danced hit, and Gligar might expect Ice Punch from them and switch out, anyway.</p> <p>Rest can be used with the Trait Early Bird to make Rest last a single turn, or you can use it with Synchronize to switch into status, Synchronize it, and then Rest off the status later, and when you wake up, Xatu can Synchronize someone else. This is probably best done with a Sleep Talk set, however, so Xatu isn't completely a sitting duck while it's Sleeping. Thunder Wave or Toxic can be added on as status.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Xatu should go to 310 Speed max, as that will make Xatu faster than neutral nature Scyther, Electabuzz, and Manectric, as well as Jolly Kangaskhan and Timid Pikachu; this requires 224 Speed EVs and a +Speed nature. 301 Speed makes it faster than Jolly Hitmonlee, Adamant Fearow, and neutral nature Tentacruel, as well as Jolly Gligar; this requires 192 EVs and a +Speed nature. 280 Speed beats Adamant Kangaskhan and Modest Pikachu; Xatu needs 216 EVs and a neutral nature to reach this. The lowest most Xatu should go is probably 270 Speed, to beat Adamant Gligar; this needs 176 EVs and a neutral nature.</p> <p>Supporter Xatu should max HP, and put the rest in Special Attack, whereas sweeper Xatu should do the opposite--max Special Attack, and put the rest in HP.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>OU counters: Snorlax, Regice, and Blissey will easily stop any special set, and won't take enough damage from a physical hit if you try and run a Choice Band Xatu for the surprise factor to make it worth it. Xatu can potentially use Wish and Calm Mind to actually beat Blissey, unless it has Toxic, or can Calm Mind itself, but even Thunder Wave will ruin Xatu's chance at a sweep when they just bring in a physical attacker and OHKO you. Tyranitar and Metagross laugh at anything Xatu can throw at them, except Dragon Dancing Tyranitar won't like Thunder Wave. Raikou, Zapdos, and other Electric Pokemon can do more damage than Xatu can defend against with Calm Mind and Wish. Any physical attacker that isn't weak to Psychic can put the hurt on Xatu, really.</p> <p>UU counters: Manectric, Electabuzz, and other Electrics can damage Xatu too fast, just like in OU. Solrock and Lunatone laugh at anything Xatu can throw at it, save Hidden Power Dark, and even that won't do enough to counter Solrock's Rock Slide or Shadow Ball. Aggron doesn't care about Thunder Wave that much, resists Psychic and Hidden Power Dark, and has STAB Rock Slide to annihilate Xatu. Sableye is immune to Psychic and can hit Xatu hard with STAB Shadow Ball or Feint Attack. Banette OHKOs Xatu with Shadow Ball, but doesn't have the Special Defense to switch in that often. Kangaskhan takes very little from Xatu's attacks, and can just beat it down with STAB Return or Shadow Ball, and, if it is abusing Early Bird Rest, you can't even cripple it with Thunder Wave. Hypno and Grumpig can just come in and Calm Mind up with you, and they will win the Calm Mind war most of the time, especially if they have Ice Punch or Thunder Punch.</p>",

Unfortunately, Xatu has neither the defenses nor the typing to pull this off effectively.</p> <p>If you are Quiet, you'll likely want to reduce your Speed IVs to 0, so that Xatu is more likely to take the hit than whatever you're passing to.</p>"},

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psychic might beat the occasional Hitmonlee and Poliwrath or something. Swagger and Toxic are there because if you want to be \"annoying\", you might as well use them.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>The EVs mentioned with the moveset is close to pretty much the best you will get. With maximum HP, it can deal the most Counter damage possible, and that gives it enough Speed to hit 201 which is a good Speed to aim for whenever you are around that area. The rest could be stuck in Special Attack or Defense, but Special Attack seems like the wiser choice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fellow Water-types such as Lanturn, and Mantine and Sleep Talk Walrein with Toxic or Hidden Power Grass, can take most anything from Politoed, including its own Hidden Power Grass. Lanturn even boasts a STAB Thunderbolt of its own with which to destroy Politoed quickly. Swords Dance Tentacruel uses its high Special Defense to set up extremely easily on Politoed and proceeds to sweep. The standard special walls of Hypno and Grumpig counter Politoed excellently as well; Hypno's Insomnia also nullifies one of Politoed's main selling points, Hypnosis. Meganium, Vileplume, and Bellossom have high Special Defense and recovery moves in Synthesis and Moonlight, and hit with Grass STAB. Banette boasts a very powerful Shadow Ball and immunity to Counter due to its Ghost typing. Electrics such as Electabuzz and Manectric make short work of Politoed.</p>",

Hypnosis is a fun status move and in UU, pretty much everything but Hypno, Banette, and the rare Sleep Talking Lanturn will be put to sleep by this guy.

About every Choice Bander in the game, from Aerodactyl to Salamence to Tauros will fail to OHKO Quagsire and be killed by a Counter. You can use Haze to make Quagsire a Suicune counter of sorts, and to force physical attackers to hit you instead of stat up. Toxic is awesome if you're playing UU, since Rest isn't as common there. Last move, either Ice Beam or Surf, is to hit stuff like Gengar and Donphan. Remember, you can counter all Hidden Power, even Hidden Power Grass.</p>"}
    }
  },
  "Slowking": {
    "overview": "<p>Slowking is one of UU's premier Calm Mind sweepers and bulky Water-types. Slowking can be immediately threatening even with a single boost thanks to its nearly unresisted dual STAB combination. Its huge bulk allows for ample setup opportunities against the tier's numerous Water- and Ground-types such as Omastar, Tentacruel, and Gligar, with most special coverage options bouncing off of it. This is complemented nicely by Rest, which allows Slowking to continue its sweep and remain threatening for the long haul. Slowking can be very hard to KO without enough offensive pressure, allowing it to easily punish most bulky builds that aim to take the game slower, and it is a great fit on bulky balance and offense teams that can open up opportunities for Slowking to wreak havoc.</p> <p>Despite its great bulk and defensive typing, Slowking is very slow and can get easily overwhelmed by offensive pressure and forced into using Rest early, something further compounded by Spikes, which makes it difficult for it to switch in. Slowking's reliance on Rest for recovery is exploitable through lost momentum, especially by sweepers that can win the game on the spot, such as Swords Dance Scyther. Slowking is also very susceptible to critical hits, as only one can put it out of commission as it's getting pressured because it has a hard time finding another opportunity to use Rest.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave is useful for turning the tides on switch-ins like Kangaskhan, Scyther, and Electabuzz and allows for earlier opportunities to set up or use Rest. Dropping Psychic for Thunder Wave is useful on paralysis spam structures, though dropping Psychic will hurt Slowking's ability to hit other Water-types and Vileplume. Dropping Rest for Thunder Wave is situationally useful on hyper offensive structures where Slowking's bulky setup sweeper nature trades longevity for speed control, but it then loses out on crucial recovery to sustain itself through its sweep. A Psychic + Calm Mind + RestTalk set reduces Slowking's coverage, but it allows Slowking to maintain itself as an offensive threat while asleep and boost more freely without losing any momentum.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Offensive variants of Kangaskhan can muscle through Slowking's physical bulk and prevent it from Rest looping with Double-Edge being a 3HKO. Specially defensive variants also work well in a pinch, forcing Slowking into a bad spot with Toxic and having reliable ways to recover off the damage Slowking deals with Wish and Early Bird Rest. Roar variants of Kangaskhan can hard stop Slowking's sweep, forcing it out of its Calm Mind boosts. However, Slowking can take advantage of Kangaskhan's Rest turns by setting up and hitting back hard with a boosted Surf.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Scyther and Pinsir pose a dangerous threat to Slowking, smashing through it with super effective STAB moves. Choice Band Scyther has a lot of immediate power with Hidden Power Bug or Silver Wind, KOing even from 60% and potentially OHKOing in Swarm range. Although Swords Dance Scyther and non-Adamant Pinsir need to set up to 2HKO Slowking, they can use Slowking's Rest turns to boost and threaten to sweep. Both Pokemon can hit Slowking very hard, but they get hit hard in return if they switch in.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Ampharos, Lanturn, and Electabuzz are great at handling Slowking, since their STAB Thunderbolts are mostly unperturbed by Special Defense boosts and prevent Slowking from Rest looping. However, if they have taken prior chip damage, Slowking can occasionally take the trade to KO them after Calm Mind, and the faster Electric-types have trouble directly switching into its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Pokemon with Roar such as Altaria, Walrein, Blastoise, and occasionally Kangaskhan can tank any boosted attacks and force Slowking out, making Slowking start back at square one on its sweep and potentially forcing it to switch in with Spikes up. If Slowking is low without using Rest, it's very hard to find an opportunity to recover and Slowking's team becomes on the back foot. However, some of these Pokemon usually don't make much progress of their own on Slowking one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore users like Walrein, Cacturne, Mr. Mime, and Raichu can lock Slowking into Calm Mind, hard stopping its sweep and preventing it from healing off damage while they use the free turns to pressure its team. Some of these Pokemon need a read on Calm Mind, as they don't comfortably switch into Slowking's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: An Explosion user such as Solrock, Electrode, Muk, or Glalie can stop Slowking's sweep by trading with it. This often opens up a gateway for a Slowking-weak Pokemon like Arcanine or Gligar to safely clean.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Slowking should find opportunities to safely come in mid-game and set up Calm Mind on Pokemon such as Omastar, Tentacruel, Gligar, Arcanine, and non-Encore or Roar Walrein through passive entry points or double switches, though Slowking should be careful of the occasional Thief from some of these Pokemon. Its naturally high special bulk coupled with greatly invested physical bulk and a lack of common physical weaknesses means Slowking can survive numerous uses of STAB Earthquake, Hidden Power Electric, and Hidden Power Grass thrown its way, with the latter two doing little damage at +1 Special Defense. Psychic allows Slowking to hit Water- and Grass-types such as Tentacruel and Vileplume. Rest gives Slowking longevity to keep sweeping the opposing team and to offset the damage it takes from a multitude of attacks, Spikes, and Toxic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes are the bane of Slowking, so a Rapid Spin user such as Tentacruel, Blastoise, or Hitmontop is mandatory with it, allowing for safer switches on Pokemon like Gligar and Arcanine. A cleric such as Ampharos, Vileplume, or Altaria can wake up Slowking after it uses Rest, letting it hit the field again for another Calm Mind-boosted assault. Kangaskhan provides the team another special sponge for opposing Water- and Electric-types, and it can pass a Wish to Slowking to keep it healthy when needing to switch into certain threats with Spikes up or if it took prior chip damage. Since Choice Band Scyther is an immediate threat to Slowking, Pokemon that can check it such as Granbull, Arcanine, and Gligar are good partners, establishing their own offense that complements Slowking by cleaning up late-game. Pokemon that can check Electric-types such as Kangaskhan, Ampharos, Cradily, and Nidoqueen can passively damage or wallbreak through them to enable Slowking to sweep and be not as easily forced out.</p>"

That 20% chance of a full stat boost from Ancient Power is always good, which can potentially make Dunsparce a good Pokemon (:o indeed!) Glare can paralyze more Pokemon than Thunder Wave or Body Slam can, being able to hit both Ground- and Ghost-types, but that accuracy winds me up sometimes. Ice Beam has that 20% chance of a freeze, but I don't use it much, as Dunsparce is all about paraflinch. Water Pulse has a 40% chance of confusion, quite chancey, always up for consideration. Attract can get piss annoying, and will at least force a switch, as does Yawn, but remember it doesn't go hand in hand with paralysis. And Counter is a nice surprise; you don't see it much on this Pokemon.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>I usually max out HP, load quite a bit into Attack, and distribute the rest into its defenses. Go with Adamant. Unless, of course, you do decide to use one of those special attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>He may have a buttload of HP, but he can't really take a strong attack, least of all a Brick Break.

Counter is unexpected, but Gligar can live through almost any physical hit, boosted or not--it's a great surprise for Fearow and such friends. Toxic can help wearing down stuff on switches, but with the prevalence of a Sleep Talking Water type for a Gligar counter, it's primarily for Solrock on teams that don't have Vileplume to Aromatherapy.

Hidden Power Flying is good for STAB, and does tons of damage to Meganium and a bit to other Gligar, but Hidden Power Bug still hits Grass types (unless they're part Poison, in which case Earthquake is neutral), in addition to nailing Solrock and Lunatone hard, but you're lost against anything that's Flying.</p>"}

Unfortunately, both of its STAB types are special, and it only has base 35 Special Attack, meaning Sneasel must use non-STAB moves if it wants to make use of its much higher Attack stat. Sneasel is also exceedingly frail and has five glaring weaknesses, necessitating an immense amount of team support in order for it to function. Even so, Sneasel has perfect neutral coverage in Shadow Ball + Brick Break, and in a metagame dominated by Psychic-types such as Hypno, Solrock, Lunatone, and Grumpig, as well as Fighting-weak Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Cradily, and Walrein, perhaps it's not all bad for everyone's favorite icy weasel.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set is more suited to revenge killing than Sneasel's Swords Dance set, making use of moves like Focus Punch and Hidden Power Flying, the latter of which is extremely useful against walls like Hitmontop, Vileplume, and Meganium that Sneasel would otherwise have trouble with. However, Sneasel faces heavy competition as a revenge killer from Persian, which gets STAB on Double-Edge, allowing it to always OHKO Hasty Tentacruel and hit Scyther significantly harder than Sneasel ever could. Substitute and Endure are both options to help Sneasel more safely bring its HP down to the activation range of its Liechi Berry. Focus Punch can be used alongside Substitute as a stronger alternative to Brick Break. Sneasel can also use Substitute in tandem with Toxic to wear down the foe. Quick Attack can be utilized as a priority move that picks off weakened Pokemon. However, Sneasel already has the necessary Speed tier to adequately perform this role, and giving up an important move for Quick Attack is not justifiable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fighting-types such as Poliwrath, Primeape, and Hitmontop can easily OHKO Sneasel with their STAB attacks. Hitmonlee and Hitmontop also have access to Mach Punch, which ignores Sneasel's absurd Speed stat. Additionally, Hitmontop's Intimidate softens the incoming attack before Hitmontop revenge kills Sneasel with Mach Punch. Walls such as Blastoise, Hypno, Granbull, and the aforementioned Hitmontop can all pivot into Sneasel easily and 2HKO it back, especially the latter two with their access to Intimidate. Due to its extreme frailty, Sneasel gets easily crushed by Rock-types such as Omastar, Solrock, and Lunatone; burned alive by Fire-types such as Ninetales, Camerupt, and Magmar; swarmed by Bug-types such as Scyther and Pinsir; and hammered by Steel-types such as Aggron.</p>",

Because Shadow Ball and Brick Break do not receive STAB, Double-Edge becomes Sneasel’s strongest attack against targets that are hit neutrally by the first two attacks. Swords Dance boosts Sneasel’s Attack stat by two stages with each use and allows it to perform the role of a setup sweeper.</p> <p>Liechi Berry is Sneasel's best option for a held item, as it is likely to take a massive hit to activate it or use Double-Edge enough to activate it through the recoil. Both of Sneasel’s abilities are relatively useless. However, Inner Focus prevents Sneasel from flinching, which is considerably more useful than prevention of lowered accuracy, especially with Fake Out users such as Persian and Shiftry around. Maximum Speed and Attack EVs allow Sneasel to outspeed the entire tier and hit as hard as possible. A Jolly nature is utilized so that Sneasel can outspeed base 105 Speed Pokemon such as Scyther, Manectric, Rapidash, and Electabuzz. Sneasel is hard to use because it's so incredibly frail and cannot be directly switched into basically anything. As such, Sneasel should only be switched in via a slow Baton Pass or after a teammate has fainted so that it can revenge kill the foe. Furthermore, bulky attackers such as Kangaskhan and Lunatone can ease pressure off Sneasel with their ability to take a hit yet still maintain offensive momentum. Spikes setters such as Omastar are incredibly useful for chipping away at the opposing team for Sneasel to clean up later.</p>"

For the standard set you're obviously going to want some Speed and Attack, so either give it full Speed and a +Spe nature or 285, enough to outspeed Medicham and other things at that Speed. Split the rest in Attack and HP so he'll survive and get more from Leftovers. For the Calm Mind set worry more about Special Attack and Speed over everything else, maybe a little in HP too. Psych-Up set is going to need less Attack and MUCH more HP and Defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Anything that shrugs off or abuses status for the first set, like Heracross or Celebi. Any physical attacker owns the shit out of the Swagger / Psych Up set with some luck. Prediction counters the last set. Skarmory beats all sets except those with Thunderbolt, Gengar / Misdreavus beat you if you don't have Shadow Ball, and any Steel / Rock can shut you down, especially without Earthquake.

Instead of maxing Special Attack, by taking 8 EVs from it and moving it into the leftover EVs you got from setting the Speed below its maximum, you achieve a HP that is divisible by four which is very nice to activate your Petaya after 3 Substitutes instead of 4, so you might survive some random Quick Attacks, but being able to Substitute 4 times can also be useful.</p> <p>The IVs given are for Hidden Power Ice. Hidden Power Water should use 30 Attack, 30 Defense, and 30 Special Attack, with 31 everywhere else.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Lanturn can often eat a few Hidden Power Grasses and deal Surfs in return. Meganium takes around 2 Hidden Power Ices, and with Light Screen, even more. Quagsire can counter it only if Manectric's Hidden Power isn't Grass.

The choice of Hidden Power can be a tad tough though. Hidden Power Grass is so you don't get totally walled by Lanturn and Quagsire, and so you can use it on Golem. Hidden Power Ice will hit Gligar however, and now it doesn't get walled by Meganium and other Grass Pokemon.

Timid Raikou's unboosted Crunch only hits for 23% - 25%, making Camerupt one of the best Calm Mind Raikou counters in the game. Though by far the most effective of its uses, Camerupt's walling potential is not limited to Electric-types. It switches in on Weezing with relative ease, though Sludge Bomb does take its toll. Heal Bell Celebi's Psychic only does 28% - 31%, while Fire Blast hits for 67% - 79%. While Camerupt doesn't exactly wall them, it can be used to beat Jirachi, Jynx, and Alakazam in a pinch. Wish Jirachi has only about a 1% chance of 2HKOing Camerupt with a +1 Psychic, while Camerupt has an 80.7% chance of 2HKOing Jirachi with Earthquake.

  "Banette": {
    "overview": "<p>Banette can switch in on a sleep-inflicting move like Sleep Powder; more often than not this will cause a switch, so it can get in a couple hits, a Will-O-Wisp, or a Knock Off. Despite its low Speed and mediocre defenses, Banette is a good UU Ghost-type with its decent Attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>EVs</h3> <p>Banette's will need its Attack maxed out and should have an Adamant nature. You'll want a bit of Speed on this thing, usually, as well, because you don't want it taking a hit from what it's supposed to be killing. For the third set, max Speed and Attack with either Jolly or Adamant can work depending on what you want to outspeed after a Salac boost. Jolly can outspeed basically everything in UU except base 125 Speed Pokemon and above, but you lose the Attack power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Not many things in UU can switch into Banette, but Blastoise, Walrein, and Politoed can hold their own quite well. Meganium can also switch into it, although it can't do anything back directly. Gligar and Golem can take a few hits, but again, watch out for that burn. Muk blocks Knock Off with Sticky Hold, and has decent defenses to take Shadow Balls and Hidden Power Fightings, but unless it has Rest or manages to get up a Substitute, it won't like taking Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {"description": "<p>Knock Off and attack whenever possible, but it's also fun to burn things. Insomnia can really mess up some Pokemon and provides some easy switch-ins. Unfortunately, this can't be done often with Banette as you can see its defenses are lacking. This is more of an anti-tank Pokemon; if you want to counter sleep inducers, Hypno is probably the safer bet.</p>"},
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Banette's top two attacking moves are self-explanatory. It has such a bad movepool, though, that other attacks are hard to find; even Double-Edge doesn't damage anything more than the other moves, other than the Normal / Flying types and Girafarig. Will-O-Wisp hurts them more, anyway. Hyper Beam and Destiny Bond are both suicide moves, Will-O-Wisp actually does something to physical sweepers, while Toxic can be used to wear down bulky Water-types.</p>"},
      "Salac + Destiny Bond": {"description": "<p>This set works well in UU, and it can catch things off guard. Banette is immune to Quick Attack / Mach Punch, so running Salac Berry should bring no worries. Hit / burn what you can, and then when you think your run is over, Endure and proceed to Destiny Bond that now slower sweeper or wall.</p>"}

  "Absol": {
    "overview": "<p>Absol has a good movepool and great Attack. Too bad its poor defenses and Speed stop it from being better, or it could be a complete monster. Baton Pass is still fun to toy with.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>EVs</h3> <p>You'll want to focus on Defense and HP on Baton Passing Absol. For the sweeper sets, however, you'll want Attack, and lots of it. Running 264 Speed for Salac variants helps.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Your best bet is probably Gligar, unless Absol is using a novelty Ice Beam set. What hinders Absol is that its Speed is so low that even if it could pull something off, Nidoking or Fearow could just switch in and beat it down. Pokemon like Kangaskhan can easily take a hit from the special set and 2HKO it.</p>",
    "sets": {"Swords Dance + Baton Pass": {"description": "<p>This is a Baton Passing Absol. Absol makes a great Baton Passer with Taunt and can hit stuff hard with Shadow Ball. However, you may not find Taunt to be particularly useful in UU, as very few things run Roar there, and so for this reason, you may prefer Hidden Power Fighting. It combos nicely with Shadow Ball to hit everything at least neutrally. Substitute, however, is still useful to stop status effect moves and is a lot easier on prediction than Taunt. It also blocks Explosion and goes well with Baton Pass.</p>"}}
  },
  "Glalie": {
    "overview": "<p>Glalie has a niche in the UU metagame as a Spikes lead on hyper offense teams and as a rare mid-game Spiker with Explosion on bulky offense teams. Although it faces direct competition from prominent Spikers Omastar and Qwilfish, Glalie's niche comes from its pure Ice typing giving it a defensive edge against Electric- and Ground-type attacks from offensive Normal- and Electric-types. Glalie has positive matchups against both other Spikers and Rapid Spinners, giving it good self-sufficiency for winning Spikes wars. Many of Glalie's offensive teammates appreciate the momentum that Glalie provides with the combination of Spikes and Explosion, making it a good Spiker on teams that prefer Glalie's defensive typing. However, Glalie isn't infallible, as any team with an Arcanine can quickly reverse the momentum it generates. This is what separates Glalie from Qwilfish, whose Water typing allows it to resist Arcanine's Fire Blast to safely lay down Spikes while also providing reliable speed control for its team with Thunder Wave, leaving Qwilfish as the preferred hyper offense lead in the modern metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Glalie can be used as a mid-game Spiker with a specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 236 SpD / 20 Spe and a Careful nature to better switch into Water- and Electric-types. Taunt can be used over Hidden Power Grass to prevent slower foes from using Toxic to put Glalie on a timer, Kangaskhan from using Wish or Rest, or slower Spikers like Omastar from setting up. Ice Beam gives Glalie a STAB option that prevents Flying-type setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Scyther and Gligar from turning Glalie into setup fodder without resorting to Explosion. Icy Wind is a speed control tool to prevent Taunt users from denying Spikes or to lay more layers of Spikes against Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Electabuzz, though Qwilfish is better at speed control through Thunder Wave paralysis. Light Screen allows Glalie to survive special attacks more comfortably and set up on Omastar, Tentacruel, and Ampharos, and it can keep it active for a teammate after using Explosion. Lum Berry gives Glalie a safety net against Toxic and paralysis to let it lay more layers of Spikes without being put on a timer or losing its Speed for a fast Explosion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Arcanine</strong>: Arcanine hard stops Glalie from applying pressure, as it is faster than max Speed Glalie and OHKOes it with Fire Blast. Lead Arcanine can deny Glalie the opportunity to lay Spikes and pressure common switch-ins with Thief if Glalie switches out, while any non-lead Arcanine can limit Glalie to one layer of Spikes before exerting its own offense. If Glalie preemptively uses Explosion turn 1 on the Arcanine switch, this means Glalie has not laid down any Spikes, and Explosion can not OHKO Arcanine after Intimidate, keeping Arcanine healthy to receive Wish passes from Kangaskhan.</p> <p><strong>Solrock</strong>: Solrock's Rock Slide puts a dent into Glalie; Choice Band Solrock can OHKO it, while other variants usually 2HKO it. It is also Spikes-immune, resistant to Explosion, and not easily pressured by Glalie's coverage. Solrock can even safely set up Reflect or Light Screen against non-Taunt Glalie to enable certain setup sweepers.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Hitmontop is a spinner Glalie has trouble against, as Brick Break puts the fear of a 2HKO into Glalie, while Rapid Spin removes its Spikes. Glalie can explode on Hitmontop after it has laid Spikes, but Intimidate means it will not OHKO, leaving Glalie to need prior chip damage or a revenge killer for Hitmontop. Hitmonlee is an anti-Spikes lead that can OHKO Glalie with Choice Band Brick Break, or use Bulk Up on its Spikes turn or switch-out turns.</p> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Haunter makes for a good anti-Spikes lead, as it can Taunt any attempts to lay Spikes and has an immunity to Explosion, leaving Glalie no other option than to switch out, or use the uncommon Ice Beam. Haunter thus makes its own progress by spreading Will-O-Wisps, Thieving any Leftovers, or using Substitute to push itself into Salac/Petaya Berry range and scout the switch-in.</p>",

      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Glalie safely sets up Spikes against Pokemon such as Omastar, Ampharos, Walrein, and Lanturn with its pure Ice typing and solid 80/80/80 bulk. Explosion breaks a hole in the opposition, severely denting anything that doesn't resist Normal or allowing Glalie's team to play a favorable 5v5. Explosion also comes in handy for removing slower setup sweepers such as Granbull, Slowking, and Curse Muk, which can otherwise outlast teams with great bulk and Rest. Earthquake puts pressure on Poison-types like Qwilfish and Tentacruel, taxing either of them for using Spikes or Rapid Spin, respectively, and allows Glalie to hit Electric-types without resorting to Explosion, breaking Electrode and Manectric's Substitutes to keep them from possibly taking advantage of Glalie. Hidden Power Grass is used to pressure Omastar, limiting the amount of Spikes it puts out while Glalie sets its own and making sure Glalie's Explosion connects on a different target that doesn't resist it.</p> <p>A Jolly nature on lead Glalie ensures it will outspeed leads such as Adamant Kangaskhan and neutral-natured base 85 Speed Pokemon such as Nidoking. A physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 Spe with an Impish nature allows Glalie to more effectively set up Spikes against Normal-types, as it can dodge a 2HKO from offensive Kangaskhan's Double-Edge, Bulk Up Granbull's unboosted Return, and an OHKO from Choice Band Granbull's Double-Edge. It also narrowly dodges an OHKO from non-Choice Band Kangaskhan and Granbull's Focus Punch while it sets up Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Electric-types like Electrode, Manectric, and Electabuzz like Glalie as a teammate, for all their checks take Spikes damage, and they appreciate Glalie's ability to safely set up and use Explosion on Kangaskhan, Ampharos, and Lanturn. Psychic-types like Xatu, Lunatone, and Grumpig love Glalie's Spikes support increasing their offensive presence. They can force switches against positive matchups by taking advantage of Psychic's Special Defense drops and few notable resistances to set up a Substitute or Calm Mind. Arcanine likes Glalie as a partner both because it likes Spikes to help it break through specially bulky walls, and Glalie can wear down Tentacruel with Earthquake as well as using Explosion on other bulky Water-types such as Walrein, Blastoise, Lanturn, and Slowking. In a similar vein, physical wallbreakers like offensive Kangaskhan, Scyther, Granbull, Solrock, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen appreciate Glalie wearing down physical walls like Omastar, Granbull, and Vileplume through Spikes, Hidden Power Grass pressure for Omastar, and Explosion to remove the latter two. Late-game cleaners such as Scyther, Gorebyss, and Rain Dance Omastar are good Spikes partners, appreciating the extra push of Spikes damage to KO bulkier targets.</p>"

  "Walrein": {
    "overview": "<p>This is a great alternative to Blastoise and Quagsire in UU, thanks to STAB on Ice Beam, but in an OU game, it's inferior to Lapras, except the Curse set, which is a weaker Swampert. This is one of the most contested UUs, with some respected UU players recommending it be moved to BL due to its ability to tank hits, if that is any indication of its power.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>It can Roar semi-effectively, but there is little to phaze in UU except Grumpig. Icy Wind can stop sweepers with its Speed lowering capabilities. Yawn gives Walrein a phazing move.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>For the Cursing version you will want a good amount of Attack and Special Defense. For the others you might want to concentrate on Defense to take Gligar on. No matter what this won't take on Hitmonlee or other Pokemon with STAB Fighting attacks, so don't even bother (Surf scares away a lot of the Pokemon with Rock attacks). You can't go wrong with some Special Attack; STAB Ice Beam is very threatening. The Encore set uses a bunch of Special Defense to help it take on Calm Mind Pokemon better, but if you want to boost another stat, take it from there first.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Snorlax can take its hits all day and rest off the damage, or Curse up with it and win the match up (barring a critical hit) with STAB Normal, Swampert just overpowers it, any Water with Toxic beats Restless versions, Electric Pokemon especially Manectric and Electabuzz make it run, but sometimes have to worry about Earthquake on the switch. Hitmonlee absorbs hits with its huge Special Defense and unleashes STAB Fighting attacks. Hypno beats Walrein without Toxic. Water Absorb Quagsire can overpower those without Hidden Power Grass, but doesn't like being Toxiced.</p>",

Surf is another option in the last slot, as it also gets STAB and hits stuff like Aggron.</p>"},
      "Encore": {"description": "<p>You COULD use Rest here, Surf is probably more effective. At least try to Toxic a few things before you die. Encore can be useful to stop Cursers or paralyzed enemies, because otherwise, Walrein is usually too slow to really Encore effectively.

      "Curse": {"description": "<p>Walrein can Curse decently if you are into that stuff. You will want to hit Electrics on the switch or you will be in trouble later on. Ice Beam hits Solrock and Misdreavus for decent damage and with STAB absolutely trashes Altaria. Offensively, Ground and Ice are a very powerful combination. Electabuzz and Manectric are your two biggest enemies here, so you have to try and catch them on the switch with Earthquake. You might not want to give away Curse and Earthquake at first, to lull the Electrics into a false sense of security, and then BAM! Earthquake KO.</p>"}

    "overview": "<p>Using Gorebyss with Spikes can work, as the sight of Rain Dance users trigger a switch to Water-types, and Spikes + Hidden Power Grass will hurt.

Maybe it can give you a turn to Rain Dance.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>190 Speed (200 Speed EVs) is needed for the Rain Dancer in UU. You can go lower if you aren't afraid of Electrode and Persian. Max Special Attack, and put the rest in HP. For the Baton Passer, max HP, balance out the defenses, and put Speed wherever to beat something after an Agility (there are tons of things you can do with it).</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The only way to stop this is using a Water-type with decent Special Defense, like Blastoise or Walrein (Omastar doesn't count, thanks to the part Rock typing).
