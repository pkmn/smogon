    "overview": "<p>Venusaur is a phenomenal sun sweeper in the current UU tier. Venusaur's defensive typing lets it set up on many common Pokemon like Tangrowth, Swampert, Tapu Bulu, and Rotom-W, allowing it to clean teams with its Growth boots. With moves like Giga Drain for reliable recovery, a powerful 100-Base Power and sun-boosted Weather Ball, and Sludge Bomb or Earth Power, Venusaur is able to punch holes in many teams, as with a boost it 2HKOes nearly every Pokemon in the tier barring Chansey. With a Modest nature, it outspeeds every relevant Pokemon in the tier under sun except +2 Galarian Moltres. However, Venusaur is severely limited if sun is no longer active, being outsped and KOed by plenty of Pokemon like Salamence and Azelf or used as setup bait for Pokemon like Galarian Moltres and Thundurus-T. Without a boost, Venusaur can sometimes be too weak to sweep, as common Pokemon like Rotom-H and Moltres are able to survive an unboosted hit and OHKO it back. Lastly, priority users such as Lycanroc-D and Mamoswine can pick off a weakened Venusaur.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Knock Off can be used to remove Chansey's Eviolite while also nailing Nihilego and Chandelure, but generally Venusaur benefits much more from its other moves; it can OHKO Nihilego and Chandelure with Earth Power, and after enough boosts from Growth it can damage Chansey with Giga Drain and outheal the damage done by Seismic Toss.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: If Venusaur chooses to not run Earth Power, Chandelure can stomach any of Venusaur's hits at +2 and take it out with a Fire-type attack. Rotom-H and Moltres are other Pokemon that can take an unboosted Sludge Bomb from Venusaur and KO it back with their Fire-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Special walls such as Chansey and Umbreon can take any of Venusaur's hits and stall out sun turns, with the former using Soft-Boiled and wearing it down with Seismic Toss and the latter being able to keep itself healthy with Wish + Protect and hit Venusaur hard with Foul Play due to Growth's attack boosts. Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro and RestTalk Galarian Moltres can take a +2 hit and KO it back.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Zygarde-10%, Lycanroc-D, and Mamoswine can revenge kill Venusaur using their priority moves if Venusaur is worn down, which can happen due to Venusaur sometimes having to take a hit to set up Growth while also dealing with Life Orb recoil.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Growth is a powerful setup move under sun, boosting Venusaur's Special Attack by 2 stages and allowing it to 2HKO nearly all the Pokemon in the tier. It can set up on popular Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Swampert, and Tapu Bulu due to its typing, and then sweep through opposing teams. Giga Drain hits Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types like Primarina, Krookodile, and Rhyperior super effectively. Weather Ball is Venusaur's main attacking move under sun, as its Base Power becomes 100 and is boosted by the sun, KOing Steel-types that resist Giga Drain like Celesteela, Aegislash, and Jirachi. Sludge Bomb hits Pokemon that resist Giga Drain and Weather Ball like Salamence, Hydreigon, and Rotom-H while also hitting Fairy-types like Hatterene super effectively, though it will need a boost to OHKO the former two. Earth Power is an alternative option to hit Tentacruel, Chandelure, and Nihilego harder, but this leaves Venusaur susceptible to Salamence, as Giga Drain and Weather Ball are mandatory moves. Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed ensures Venusaur is as strong and fast as possible. A Modest nature is typically used to maximize damage output while still nearly outspeeding everything under the sun, but a Timid nature can be used to outspeed +2 Galarian Moltres if needed. Life Orb is used to boost Venusaur's damage output, letting it OHKO Pokemon such as Rotom-H, Salamence, and Moltres after a boost, while a boost to Giga Drain gives Venusaur insane damage output and reliable recovery, making it an unstoppable force.</p> <p>Venusaur only fits on sun teams, so Torkoal is a mandatory partner, as it is the most reliable sun setter in the tier. It provides the team with entry hazard support and entry hazard control with Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, respectively. Other Pokemon that take advantage of sun like Chandelure, Darmanitan, and Charizard break holes in enemy teams thanks to their powerful wallbreaking capabilities amplified by sun, allowing Venusaur to sweep much more easily. Venusaur also appreciates momentum such as Teleport from Chansey to help it get in safely as well as give it more opportunities to set up; for example Chansey can bring Venusaur in on physical attackers like Krookodile and Azumarill, which are forced out by it under sun. Hatterene can be run as a Hydreigon check and discourages entry hazards from being set so Torkoal can come in more, allowing Venusaur to sweep more easily.</p> "

However, Nidoqueen can struggle to pivot into Electric-types like Raikou and Thundurus-T that commonly carry super-effective coverage to break through it. Unfortunately, Nidoqueen's overreliance on its Life Orb leaves it susceptible to Knock Off from Pokemon it would pivot into like Nihilego. A low Speed stat gives Nidoqueen an undesirable matchup versus faster-paced teams, and although Nidoqueen sports a quality defensive typing, it is still weak to common Pokemon in the tier such as Mamoswine and Keldeo. These struggles sting a bit more because Nidoqueen has no form of reliable recovery, meaning it is worn down pretty quickly throughout a match. Lastly, Nidoqueen faces severe competition from its counterpart Nidoking, who sports better offenses and a higher speed tier, making it preferred on most teams. Still, Nidoqueen's better bulk and role compression as an entry hazard setter gives it a role on certain teams.</p> ",

Taunt does a decent job of giving utility Pokemon like Chansey a hard time. Substitute can be a viable option to ease prediction on a forced switch. Protect also helps prediction by letting Nidoqueen scout Choice-locked Pokemon it is weak to such as Krookodile and Jirachi.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey is the single best answer to Nidoqueen, as it can consistently switch into its attacks without worry, recover any damage away, and chip Nidoqueen with Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Azelf, Necrozma, and Starmie all can outspeed and KO Nidoqueen, with Necrozma being able to live a hit and use it as set up fodder thanks to its high natural bulk.

Wallbreakers such as Azumarill and Lycanroc-D make good teammates because they also appreciate Nidoqueen's good matchup versus Amoonguss and Tangrowth.

Starmie is a decent teammate for Nidoqueen because it checks many Pokemon that threaten Nidoqueen, such as Keldeo. Rotom-H and Rotom-W are both Volt Switch users that can bring Nidoqueen in safely and also check Mamoswine, and the latter has the added benefit of checking Krookodile. Nidoqueen pairs well with almost any Kommo-o set, as Nidoqueen can break through Primarina and Hatterene to help it succeed.

    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its excellent offensive typing, ability in Sheer Force, powerful STAB moves like Sludge Wave and Earth Power, and excellent coverage moves like Ice Beam and Thunderbolt, Nidoking is a very powerful wallbreaker. It can hit a large portion of the tier for super effective damage, checking plenty of Pokemon like Skarmory, Primarina, Aegislash, and Tapu Bulu. Even though Nidoking is one of the most dangerous threats in the tier, its mediocre Speed tier and bulk mean it can't find many opportunities to wallbreak, mandating pivot support to get it onto the field safely. Nidoking also relies on its Life Orb to do massive damage, so it despises Knock Off from the likes of Nihilego and Mienshao. Its typing also doesn't benefit it much defensively, leaving it weak to common attacking types like Ground, Water, and Psychic from Pokemon like Excadrill, Azumarill, and Azelf. Furthermore, despite being a Ground-type, Nidoking doesn't provide a functional Electric immunity for its team, being outsped by Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Thundurus-T and getting hit hard by their other moves. This lack of defensive utility makes it hard to justify over other Pokemon that share its Ground or Poison typing like Krookodile, Excadrill, and Nihilego.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fire Blast is also a solid option, giving Nidoking the ability to 2HKO Celesteela and OHKO Amoonguss after Stealth Rock, but its BoltBeam coverage already deals with both either way. Superpower can be used to hit Chansey for solid damage on the switch, but it doesn't hit anything else, and doing enough damage requires either a nature change or heavy investment, which normally isn't worth it. While Nidoking's higher Attack might make a physical set worthwhile, it lacks the proper movepool, and most of its Sheer Force-boosted moves are special. Sucker Punch is an option to pick off the likes of Jirachi and Azelf as well as other revenge killers like Lycanroc-D, but forgoing coverage or added utility isn't great for Nidoking. Protect can used over Substitute to scout moves from Choice-locked foes and checks like Hydreigon and Keldeo. While you forgo the additional power from Life Orb, a Choice Scarf set is a solid revenge killer while still being an effective wallbreaker.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Thanks to Chansey's tremendously high special bulk, it is able to switch into any of Nidoking's attacks and can proceed to whittle it down with Seismic Toss, set up Stealth Rock, or recover its HP with Soft-Boiled.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Keldeo and Rotom-W outspeed and threaten Nidoking.

Earth Power slams Steel- and Poison-types such as Jirachi, Aegislash, and Nihilego. Thunderbolt allows Nidoking to nail Water- and Flying-types like Slowking, Skarmory, Celesteela, and Gyarados. Ice Beam can be used to OHKO opposing Ground-types like Krookodile, as well as OHKOing Salamence and Noivern, while Substitute makes Nidoking much less prediction reliant, giving it free turns against foes that it forces out like Nihilego, Tangrowth, and Aegislash. Stealth Rock can be run for role compression thanks to Nidoking preventing common entry hazard removers like Excadrill and Tentacruel from switching into it. A Modest nature should be run to increase Nidoking's damage output against threats like Slowking and Mandibuzz, since it doesn't miss out on any notable Speed benchmarks. Life Orb and Sheer Force pair together to negate the health loss of Life Orb while giving an effective 70% power boost, which is a big factor behind Nidoking's power.</p> <p>Nidoking fits best on offensive teams that are able to bring it in many times to wallbreak and tear through defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss and Aegislash.

Mienshao comfortably beats Chansey, Zarude forces out Swampert, and Rotom-W lures in Tangrowth for Nidoking and OHKOes Krookodile.

Switch-ins to Psychic-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks like Jirachi, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss can be paired with Nidoking on bulkier teams. Jirachi also provides entry hazard support, allowing Nidoking to reliably KO Celesteela, and Healing Wish support to let it wallbreak even more. Tangrowth and Amoonguss are also able to handle Electric-types in the tier much better than Nidoking and can pivot into the likes of Lycanroc-D and Keldeo excellently. Late-game cleaners like the aforementioned Mienshao and Lycanroc-D are great to break through Chansey, which Nidoking struggles against.

    "overview": "<p>Chansey's sky-high, Eviolite-boosted special bulk allows it to wall nearly every special attacker in UU, including fearsome threats such as Nidoking and Primarina. In addition, Chansey can withstand certain physical attacks from setup sweepers like Gyarados and Salamence before they are sufficiently boosted and cripple them with Toxic. Chansey is also hard to wear down, since it has Soft-Boiled for HP recovery and Natural Cure to remove status ailments. It also has many utility moves such as Teleport and Stealth Rock to support its team. However, Chansey is rather passive, as it relies on Seismic Toss and Toxic to deal damage. As a result, many Pokemon such as Aegislash, Galarian Slowbro, and Reuniclus, easily take advantage of Chansey. Without Teleport, Chansey is a huge momentum drain for non-stall teams. Chansey's typing provides few useful resistances, and Chansey by itself must rely on its bulk to keep threats in check. Chansey is vulnerable to every entry hazard, meaning it gets overwhelmed by them quickly. Chansey is also susceptible to Knock Off and Trick, as without Eviolite, it is harder for Chansey to keep threats in check.</p> ",

    "overview": "<p>Galarian Moltres is one of the most dangerous sweepers in UU, defining hyper offense teams with its Double Dance set of Nasty Plot and Agility. Coupled with STAB attacks that provide near-perfect coverage, Galarian Moltres can be remarkably hard to stop after it sets up. This feat is not difficult thanks to Galarian Moltres's excellent bulk, allowing it to turn Pokemon like Hydreigon and Tapu Bulu into setup bait. Furthermore, Galarian Moltres can fill a defensive role by using a RestTalk set that is one of the few Pokemon capable of defeating all variations of Aegislash. These sets also can act as status absorbers to threats like Amoonguss and Chansey. However, having only base 100 Special Attack can prevent Galarian Moltres from breaking through specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey and Nihilego, even when boosted. Galarian Moltres also requires two turns to set up if a Weakness Policy is not used or activated, which leaves it vulnerable to Taunt and status afflictions. Using RestTalk can make Galarian Moltres too passive when first entering a battle, so the set can be challenging to fit onto teams due to how often it invites wallbreakers such as Azumarill and Thundurus-T in. Lastly, despite an overall good defensive typing, Galarian Moltres is weak to common priority moves such as Lycanroc-D's Accelerock and Mamoswine's Ice Shard.</p> ",

Forgoing a STAB or boosting move for Substitute is an option on the Double Dance set to give Galarian Moltres a better matchup against offensive teams, and it can even function decently alongside Salac Berry or Petaya Berry depending on which boosting move is being used, but overall is less reliable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types: Rock-types such as Lycanroc-D and Rhyperior pose a huge threat to Galarian Moltres; Lycanroc-D can halt a sweep with priority Accelerock, and Rhyperior can tank a hit and KO Galarian Moltres with Stone Edge. Nihilego and Diancie also serve as great checks, as the former can take any boosted attack and retaliate with a Rock-type STAB attack, while the latter flat out counters Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Azumarill and Primarina are capable of OHKOing either Galarian Moltres set. Bulkier variants of Primarina can take boosted Hurricane to boot. Diancie can hit Moltres hard with Diamond Storm and shrug off any attack Galarian Moltres tries to hit it with.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster threats like Thundurus-T and Life Orb Mienshao can heavily dent or KO Galarian Moltres, especially if it has taken Stealth Rock chip.

Fiery Wrath's flinch chance also can give Galarian Moltres chances to break through bulkier Pokemon that can tank its attacks such as Chansey and Celesteela. Air Slash is an option over Hurricane if accuracy concerns arise. Weakness Policy is the optimal item for this set, as the most effective way to take down Galarian Moltres is a super effective attack, meaning it activates a decent amount of the time and gives Galarian Moltres exceptional power when coupled with Nasty Plot. Using Weakness Policy can also create opportunities for Galarian Moltres to set up in one turn by using Agility as a super effective attack hits it. Sitrus Berry can allow Galarian Moltres to regain its health and activate Berserk for a second time. Heavy-Duty Boots is also a viable item choice, as preventing Stealth Rock damage can make it much more challenging for an opponent to take down Galarian Moltres.</p> <p>Double Dance Galarian Moltres fits primarily on hyper offense teams, though it also works on some balance teams as a late-game win condition.

Physical sweepers like Gyarados, Belly Drum Azumarill, and Swords Dance Aegislash fit well on hyper offense teams and can break through or soften up specially bulky Pokemon able to halt a Galarian Moltres sweep such as Chansey and Nihilego. Galarian Moltres can beat Grass-types like Amoonguss and Zarude that trouble these Pokemon in return. Grimmsnarl can provide dual screens support to give Galarian Moltres an easier time setting up as it becomes exceptionally difficult to take down behind screens.

Steel-types like Jirachi and Aegislash are extremely important partners, checking one of Galarian Moltres's biggest checks in Nihilego.

Access to great coverage moves such as Knock Off and Ice Punch lets Azumarill break past Pokemon like Volcanion and Amoonguss that would otherwise check it by resisting its STAB combination, while access to Aqua Jet allows it to also be a great revenge killer, especially against top threats like Lycanroc-D and Azelf that have taken chip damage. Azumarill also has decent natural bulk and a great defensive typing, which allows it to blanket check some of the more dangerous threats in the metagame such as Kommo-o and Salamence. Unfortunately, Azumarill is quite slow, so it is easily forced out by faster Pokemon such as Jirachi and Thundurus-T when it is not boosted with Belly Drum. Additionally, Rotom-W and faster Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Zarude can revenge kill Belly Drum Azumarill, as they can stomach a +6 Aqua Jet.

Ice Punch allows Azumarill to break through Amoonguss by hitting it hard enough to 2HKO on the switch. Knock Off can be used to burden anything that switches in, such as Tangrowth and Tentacruel, by removing their item.

    "overview": "<p>Despite its average movepool, Suicune is a decent setup sweeper due to its astounding bulk and valuable defensive typing that allow it to check distinguished threats such as Rhyperior. With Pressure, Calm Mind, and its superb bulk, Suicune is able to stall out threatening walls such as Aegislash and Chansey. However, Suicune is held back by the prevalence of Water-resistant Pokemon in the tier such as Keldeo, Mantine, and especially Zarude; Keldeo can simply ignore Suicune's Special Defense boosts with Secret Sword, Suicune struggles to make headway against Mantine, and Zarude especially can use Jungle Healing to cure itself of burns and Power Whip to deal significant damage. In addition, Suicune lacks reliable recovery, forcing it to rely on Leftovers and Rest in order to regain HP. This makes Suicune susceptible to Knock Off, as losing Leftovers would require Suicune to use Rest more often. In addition, its overreliance on Sleep Talk isn't great either, as you rely on RNG to choose the ideal move. Furthermore, Suicune's weakness to Grass- and Electric-type moves is easily exploitable by the common Power Whip Tangrowth, Zarude, and Thundurus-T.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute + Calm Mind is another option, as it allows Suicune to PP stall would-be checks such as Quagsire; Ice Beam can also be used over Protect to prevent it from getting walled by Grass-types. However, it makes Suicune extremely vulnerable to passive damage and status and thus less reliable than CroCune. In addition, it is unable to sponge hits from foes like Rhyperior and Mamoswine, effectively taking up the teamslot of a Water-type without offering very much defensive utility. Toxic can be used to subdue Water-immune Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Mantine, and Seismitoad. However, Suicune often doesn't have room to run Toxic due to it suffering from four-moveslot syndrome. If you were to run Toxic, it would likely replace Sleep Talk on CroCune. A set with Calm Mind / Roar / Scald / Rest allows Suicune to be used as a dedicated phazer and stop foes like Calm Mind + Psyshock Galarian Slowbro from setting up; however, this would waste Suicune's sweeping capabilities and requires entry hazard support to be effective.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Pokemon such as Raikou and Thundurus-T can easily severely damage Suicune with Thunderbolt, even after a Calm Mind boost. Rotom-W can chunk it with Volt Switch and bring in a powerful wallbreaker that can force it out.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Zarude pose an immense threat to Suicune with Horn Leech and Power Whip due to Suicune's lackluster Defense and poor Speed. Heavy-Duty Boots variants of Zarude, in particular, completely counter Suicune, as they can switch into Scald without fear due to Jungle Healing.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon: As Scald is Suicune's only offensive move, it can't damage Water-immune foes such as Mantine and Gastrodon; Suicune struggles with Gastrodon especially, as it can force Suicune to use Rest more often due to Toxic. Both of these Pokemon also have access to Haze and Clear Smog, making it difficult for Suicune to set up for a late-game sweep, as they result all of its stat boosts. Despite this, Suicune can still annoy both through Pressure stalling.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick Users</strong>: Knock Off removes Leftovers, preventing Suicune from regaining passive recovery over the course of a battle and forcing it to use Rest more often.

Choice Specs improves Salamence's wallbreaking ability and can lure Rhyperior in to nail it with Hydro Pump.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Pokemon such as Azumarill, Primarina, and Hatterene take advantage of Salamence's lack of coverage for them, having the bulk to take a hit and either set up or KO Salamence. Though a niche option, Diancie completely walls any special attacking variants of Salamence, has the bulk to survive a +1 Earthquake from Dragon Dance sets, and can KO Salamence or use it as a free chance to use Heal Bell.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon and Coverage: Without Draco Meteor, special Salamence struggles to relieve Stealth Rock pressure from Nihilego, though it must be wary of Earthquake. Lycanroc-D can OHKO offensive variants of Salamence with -1 Stone Edge after minimal chip damage and easily revenge kill it with Accelerock, though Lycanroc-D cannot switch into Salamence safely. Pokemon such as Mienshao and Krookodile commonly carry Rock-type coverage moves to revenge kill Salamence.</p> <p><strong>Walls: Pokemon like Chansey and Slowking can handle special Salamence with their massive special bulk and use it for momentum with Teleport. However, the two cannot reliably tank hits from Dragon Dance sets. Umbreon and Mandibuzz have the natural bulk to survive Salamence's special attacks and take advantage of Dragon Dance sets with Foul Play. Celesteela is an especially detrimental defensive threat because it completely walls Dragon Dance sets without Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Mamoswine: Mamoswine is the most consistent revenge killer against Salamence, as Ice Shard OHKOes any set.</p> ",

Teammates such as Chansey, Aegislash, and Celesteela appreciate Tangrowth's ability to cripple these offensive threats. Tangrowth can't take Fire- and Ice-type attacks from threats such as Moltres and Mamoswine reliably, so teammates like Primarina and Rotom-W are appreciated. Despite the amazing Regenerator, Tangrowth is extremely prone to being weakened by Stealth Rock and Spikes. Pokemon that can remove entry hazards, like Rotom-H and Salamence, therefore prevent it from being too worn down. Rotom-H is an especially good teammate, as it also checks Celesteela, one of Tangrowth's best checks. Physically defensive walls such as Buzzwole and Seismitoad appreciate Tangrowth taking on menacing special threats such as Thundurus, Keldeo, and Primarina. Buzzwole is especially valuable as a Krookodile check, since it doesn't mind losing its item, unlike Tangrowth. Keldeo can threaten Pokemon that scare Tangrowth, like Mamoswine, Moltres, and Rotom-H. In return, Tangrowth deals with Pokemon that check Keldeo well, like Primarina.</p> "

Other Ground-type wallbreakers offer better defensive utility, like Excadrill. Mamoswine is also quite slow, having no chance to outspeed common threats like Starmie and Lycanroc-D.

Stone Edge can be used to nail Moltres and Rotom-H harder, though this move is very hard to fit because of the better utility the other moves provide. Mamoswine can be used as a Stealth Rock setter but removing any of Mamoswine's four main moves severely limits its wallbreaking potential. Freeze-Dry is an option to OHKO Quagsire and nearly OHKO Gastrodon with Life Orb as well as better pressure Rotom-W. The utility offered by Knock Off is generally better, though, as it does nearly the same amount of damage as Freeze-Dry to Rotom-W, and Mamoswine can already nearly 2HKO Gastrodon and Quagsire with Earthquake.

  "Azelf": {
    "overview": "<p>Azelf is a versatile Pokemon that can take advantage of its incredibly high Speed tier and wide movepool to provide a powerful offensive presence and fast support. Nasty Plot and a variety of coverage moves such as Fire Blast, Energy Ball, and Dazzling Gleam allow Azelf to hit nearly the entire tier for super effective damage, OHKOing most of it at +2. Access to Knock Off and U-turn also makes it a great offensive pivot that can threaten tier staples like Aegislash and Tangrowth. Despite Azelf's elite Speed, common Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Zarude easily revenge kill it. Azelf does not have much bulk and lacks recovery, leaving it worn down quickly and making it difficult to set up with Nasty Plot. It also needs pivot support to get in safely, as it typically cannot directly switch into any attack. Azelf struggles to fit all the moves it needs on its Nasty Plot set, as without Energy Ball Azelf struggles to break Slowking and Swampert, whereas without Dazzling Gleam it is completely walled by Hydreigon and Mandibuzz. Thundurus-T gives Azelf large competition as a special wallbreaker and pivot, having more power, a better typing, and no 4MSS. However, Azelf's high Speed allows it to better threaten Pokemon like Keldeo and Nihilego.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Azelf can be used as a suicide lead due to its great Speed tier and access to Stealth Rock and Taunt. While this allows Azelf to always get Stealth Rock up with a Focus Sash, Pokemon like Excadrill and Krookodile, which possess better defensive utility and Rapid Spin or a stronger Knock Off respectively, can typically do this job better. Azelf can also be a Choice Band user with its great Speed tier and wide physical movepool, boasting options like Knock Off, U-turn, Zen Headbutt, Ice Punch, Explosion, and Trick. However, it is usually unable to OHKO its foes and outclassed by Pokemon like Azumarill, which provides priority and is much stronger. Azelf can run a Choice Scarf to be the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the tier, taking Choice Scarf users like Mienshao by surprise and hindering switch-ins like Hatterene with Trick.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users: Common Choice Scarf users like Krookodile, Zarude, Jirachi, and Mienshao outspeed and threaten Azelf with super effective STAB or coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers: Azelf does not have great defenses and will be 2HKOed by most priority attacks, including Accelerock from Lycanroc-D and Aqua Jet from Azumarill. Additionally, more powerful priority attacks like a boosted Quick Attack from Diggersby will KO Azelf after minimal chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Galarian Moltres and Mandibuzz can OHKO Azelf, and Azelf cannot do much back it unless it is running Dazzling Gleam. Umbreon walls Azelf almost completely without Dazzling Gleam. Choice Scarf Hydreigon can easily revenge kill Azelf, though other sets must watch out for Dazzling Gleam.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>After a Nasty Plot, very few Pokemon other than Chansey and Umbreon can withstand a hit from Azelf. Psyshock is the preferred STAB option to OHKO Nihilego and Tentacruel without a boost, and it also hits Chansey considerably harder than Psychic. Fire Blast OHKOes defensive Celesteela and Assault Vest Tangrowth at +2. It also covers many key threats such as Jirachi, Skarmory, and Excadrill. The last move is dependent on Azelf's team; Energy Ball is able to nail Slowking, Swampert, Azumarill, and Rhyperior for super effective damage. Meanwhile, Dazzling Gleam is an option to OHKO Hydreigon, 2HKO Salamence, and hit Galarian Moltres and Mandibuzz super effectively while also maintaining coverage for Krookodile. It also prevents Umbreon from completely walling Azelf. Since Azelf will typically be hitting its foes for super effective damage, Expert Belt is enough to OHKO nearly everything. Life Orb can be used to increase Azelf's damage output more consistently on targets that it cannot hit super effectively, like Hatterene and Moltres, but the chip damage adds up quickly and leaves Azelf more vulnerable to revenge killers with priority like Lycanroc-D.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Azelf is best used on hyper offense builds that can offer it support, although it can also fit on certain balance teams as a late-game wincon. An entry hazard setter like Nihilego, Excadrill, or Krookodile helps weaken foes like Chansey and Primarina into KO range of +2 Azelf. Ribombee can provide Sticky Web support to boost Azelf's ability to clean through teams, as Sticky Web invalidates common Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Zarude as revenge killers. It also ensures Azelf does not lose any Speed ties with Zygarde-10%. A pivot like Zarude can get Azelf in safely against Pokemon like Amoonguss. A wallbreaker like Azumarill or Mamoswine can help punch holes in the enemy team, significantly weakening them for Azelf to sweep later. Other sweepers like Gyarados and Nasty Plot Thundurus-T can be used on hyper offense teams to cover a wider range of threats, including Swampert, Slowking, and Galarian Moltres, which Azelf cannot easily beat.</p> "

Psyshock is an option over Psychic to guarantee the OHKO on Nihilego and deal additional damage to specially defensive foes like Chansey and Primarina. Flamethrower allows Azelf to threaten Jirachi, Excadrill, and Aegislash. Energy Ball is an option over U-turn on Expert Belt sets to offer greater coverage and threaten Swampert and Azumarill.

Strong wallbreakers like Azumarill and Mamoswine appreciate Azelf's pivoting and deal with Umbreon. An entry hazard setter like Excadrill, Skarmory, or Roserade syncs well with the switches that Azelf's momentum forces, providing additional damage for it and its teammates to break through defensive cores like Tangrowth + Chansey. Offensive pivots like Zarude and Thundurus-T form a strong pivoting cores with Azelf. Zarude can bring Azelf in on Amoonguss and Tangrowth, while it can bring Zarude in on foes like Swampert and Krookodile. Thundurus-T can threaten Primarina and Mandibuzz for Azelf, while Azelf can wear down threats like Aegislash for Thundurus-T. Strong Fighting-types like Mienshao and Conkeldurr can remove Dark-types like Umbreon and Zarude. Primarina is a great partner for Azelf, as it threatens Pokemon like Krookodile and Galarian Moltres. In return, Azelf helps remove their common Grass-type checks like Amoonguss and Tangrowth after they are sufficiently chipped. Many Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Zarude can outspeed and threaten Azelf, so a defensive teammate like Amoonguss or Tangrowth can be used to take hits from these foes.</p> "

STAB Mach Punch is also a great tool, functioning as a strong priority attack that can threaten faster Pokemon like Mienshao, Mamoswine and Hydreigon. Conkeldurr is a bit weighed down by its proneness to being worn down from Flame Orb, however. This is made a larger problem by its poor Speed, which allows the tier's many faster threats like Keldeo and Salamence to overwhelm it, as well as its iffy defensive typing, which doesn't give it many notable resistances and leaves it open to Pokemon like Moltres, Primarina, and Salamence. Conkeldurr also faces competition from Fighting-types like Mienshao, who offers comparable power in addition to a higher speed tier and Regenerator for longevity.</p> ",

Conkeldurr could hold Assault Vest to more easily switch into Scald from Pokemon like Tentacruel and Quagsire while also checking special attackers such as Nihilego. However, this often prevents it from being able to maximize its offensive potential, and it is still quite prone to being worn down. Poison Jab is a coverage option that hits Fairy-types super effectively, but Conkeldurr can usually muscle through them with Facade.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Conkeldurr's low Speed and Flame Orb use leave it quite vulnerable to being overwhelmed by faster Pokemon like Tapu Bulu, Nidoking, and Thundurus-T.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Reuniclus and Galarian Slowbro can take Knock Off from full HP while severely damaging Conkeldurr with STAB Psychic-type attacks.

Skarmory's massive physical bulk lets it switch into a weaker attack from Conkeldurr and nail it with Brave Bird. Togekiss can also be a solid check, 4x resisting Conkeldurr's STAB moves and revenge killing it with Air Slash. Moltres resists Mach Punch and can power through Conkeldurr with Hurricane.

The former can remove Stealth Rock with Defog, while the latter can get a free turn of setup. Krookodile also can't take any Water-type hits from Azumarill, Primarina, and Keldeo, but they don't like to switch in directly into its moves. Swampert and Slowking can take hits from Krookodile and threaten it back, though the latter doesn't like a Choice Band-boosted Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Mienshao, Keldeo, Cobalion, and Conkeldurr also threaten Krookodile greatly. The former three outspeed non-Choice Scarf sets, with Choice Scarf Mienshao outspeeding even those. Meanwhile, Conkeldurr has the bulk to take an Earthquake and recover its health with Drain Punch or just pick off Krookodile with Mach Punch. However, Mienshao and Cobalion should scout for Chople Berry and Choice Scarf sets.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Despite its ability and good defensive typing, Krookodile has subpar bulk and lacks reliable recovery, meaning it gets worn down quite quickly switching into Pokemon such as Excadrill and Zygarde-10%.

With Life Orb, this set fits on hyper offense teams as a great lead. If running Leftovers or a Berry, this set fits on bulky offense and balance teams, which appreciate Krookodile's utility and resistances. Knock Off is useful for checks like Amoonguss, Swampert, and Celesteela, crippling them for Krookodile's teammates. High Horsepower should be used in place of Earthquake if Tapu Bulu is on Krookodile's team, as Grassy Terrain weakens Earthquake. Stealth Rock wears down Pokemon like Celesteela and Tangrowth for teammates like Aegislash and Choice Specs Primarina. Toxic allows Krookodile to cripple checks such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu. Taunt prevents Stealth Rock and Defog from Pokemon like Excadrill, Swampert, Rotom-W, and Moltres. Leftovers offsets entry hazard damage and gives Krookodile longevity to keep threats like Nihilego, Excadrill, and Aegislash in check more easily. Chople Berry lets Krookodile take Lycanroc-D's Close Combat and KO back with Earthquake. It also helps Krookodile take Thundurus-T's Focus Blast to then weaken or KO it. Maximum investement in HP lets Krookodile better check Excadrill and Aegislash.</p> <p>Setup sweepers such as Thundurus-T and Salamence work well with Krookodile, as it can set Stealth Rock up and weaken their checks such as Diancie and Primarina. Special attackers like Azelf and Nihilego appreciate Krookodile denting and crippling their checks in Chansey and Celesteela with Knock Off, paving their way to sweep. In return, they compensate for Krookodile's lower Speed tier and remove Pokemon like Conkeldurr, Zarude, and Tapu Bulu. Amoonguss can check Pokemonn like Primarina, Mienshao, and Zarude for Krookodile, and together they can keep Lycanroc-D in check. Salamence forms a double Intimidate core with Krookodile, weakening Pokemon like Zarude and stopping setup sweepers like Gyarados from getting out of control. Krookodile is vulnerable against Fairy-types such as Azumarill and Togekiss so partners like Aegislash, Rotom-W, and Tentacruel are valuable. Tapu Bulu threatens Azumarill and Primarina for Krookodile. It can also provide Grassy Terrain to give Krookodile more recovery.</p> "

Toxic cripples switch-ins such as Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth, but since others like Amoonguss and Zarude are immune or resilient to it, it's quite matchup reliant. Darkest Lariat is useful to hit Pokemon like Rotom-W harder after they've had their items removed. Stealth Rock can be used to take advantage of Krookodile's ability to force switches against Pokemon such as Azelf and Nihilego, but it should only be used when the role compression is necessary, and it requires very good prediction.

Strong wallbreakers such as Thundurus-T and Nidoking can get past Krookodile's checks such as Slowking, Skarmory, and Tapu Bulu, allowing it to spam its STAB moves more freely. Krookodile is helpless against Grass-types, so partners that can pressure them like Nihilego and Mamoswine are great. Rotom-H is another good teammate that can scare away Grass-types and brings Krookodile in on checks like Nihilego.

Heavy-Duty Boots can also be run to help it pivot in against Spikes stacking teams, but the chip damage or passive recovery is too valuable.

Energy Ball is a situational option for powering through various Pokemon, like Rhyperior, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad, in one hit.

This is rather situational and gives up better utility, though, usually only working well on Choice item sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Several Water-types can often find ways to give Chandelure trouble.

Incineroar, albeit uncommon, resists both of Chandelure's STAB moves and can take advantage of it to annoy a switch-in with either Knock Off or status. Galarian Moltres's high Special Defense allows it to tank hits from Chandelure to then set up.

Late-game cleaners such as Lycanroc-D and Dragon Dance Salamence appreciate Keldeo's ability to wear down or remove foes like Amoonguss and Primarina. In return, Lycanroc-D can help revenge kill threats such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Salamence, which Keldeo may give a free setup opportunity to if locked into the wrong move, and remove faster foes like Azelf and Starmie with Accelerock.</p> "

The Special Defense boosts prevent foes such as Amoonguss and Aegislash from breaking its Substitute after multiple Calm Minds. Substitute also helps Keldeo avoid status. Scald is a spammable move that can punish switch-ins such as Amoonguss and Azumarill. Secret Sword allows Keldeo to break through specially defensive foes such as Chansey and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Icy Wind can be considered to OHKO Salamence, as it comfortably walls Keldeo and can damage it behind Substitute with Dual Wingbeat. It also provides coverage for Grass-types, but bulkier ones like Amoonguss and Tangrowth require multiple boosts to reliably muscle through. For this reason, Air Slash is also an option to hit them much harder at the cost of having a harder time against Salamence; however, Substitute is the preferred option to let Keldeo take advantage of more passive Pokemon like Umbreon and Jirachi. Leftovers provides passive recovery and helps offset Substitute damage. More offensive item options such as Life Orb and Expert Belt can be considered on three attack sets to improve Keldeo's ability to break through Amoonguss and Tangrowth.</p> <p>Calm Mind Keldeo fits best on bulky offense and balance builds that value the sweeping potential it provides alongside a great typing and Speed tier. It can also be considered on more offensive teams if running three attacks. Keldeo lacks the means to muscle past Pokemon such as Primarina, Mantine, and Tangrowth easily; therefore, partners like Toxtricity, Nihilego, and Nidoking help remove them. Nihilego can also check special Salamence and provide Stealth Rock support to wear down Keldeo's checks. Togekiss can muscle through Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth and provide Heal Bell support, as status greatly limits the effectiveness of Keldeo. Salamence can likewise pressure these Grass-types as well as providing Defog support. In return, Keldeo is able to pressure common Flying-resistant foes such as Nihilego, Rhyperior, and Rotom-H for them. Pivots like Jirachi and Chansey bring Keldeo in safely. Jirachi can invite foes such as Moltres in for Keldeo to set up on and provide Healing Wish support to give it another opportunity to sweep. Albeit rare, Noivern can prove problematic due to its Speed and ability to bypass Substitute. For this reason, partners like Rhyperior and Mamoswine are appreciated. Mamoswine is also able to remove Grass-types and force damage on Water-types such as Rotom-W and Primarina. If Keldeo is utilizing a more offensive set, Sticky Web support is valuable to prevent faster foes such as Lycanroc-D from being able to revenge kill it.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Huge Power makes Diggersby a decent wallbreaker and cleaner that can pressure many Pokemon in the tier. A Swords Dance boost allows Diggersby to KO defensive walls like Chansey and Celesteela; even the latter is KOed by Mega Kick after chip damage despite being the only Pokemon in the tier that resists or is immune to both STAB moves. Quick Attack also provides a strong STAB priority attack that allows Diggersby to perform late-game sweeps, while a Choice Scarf set can outspeed and KO some of its usual offensive checks like Cobalion and Lycanroc-D; however, other common Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Zarude outspeed Diggersby and have more defensive utility, with the former having Intimidate and the latter having decent natural bulk. Without Choice Scarf, Diggersby is slow and will rarely outspeed its foes, forcing it to usually rely on Quick Attack for a late-game sweep and making it easy fodder for faster revenge killers like Keldeo if they are healthy enough to survive a boosted Quick Attack. Other offensive Pokemon that can boost their Speed, such as Dragon Dance Salamence and Gyarados, can better position themselves to sweep. With Diggersby's low defenses and lack of any meaningful defensive utility outside of switching in on a predicted Electric-type attack with its Choice Scarf set, it needs to typically OHKO its foes to prevent taking heavy damage in return. Additionally, it is weak to common priority users such as Aqua Jet Azumarill and Mach Punch Conkeldurr.</p> ",

Unfortunately, this set is very prediction reliant. Additionally, Diggersby's poor Speed makes it easy for many foes like Zarude and Lycanroc-D to revenge kill it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon: Diggersby's main drawback is its below average Speed without Choice Scarf, allowing many offensive threats in the tier like Zarude and Lycanroc-D to OHKO it.

While Diggersby can threaten to OHKO Crawdaunt with +2 Quick Attack, it cannot do the same to Azumarill and Conkeldurr.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Defensive Pokemon like Skarmory, Tangrowth, and Celesteela effectively check Choice Scarf Diggersby, as Diggersby fails to inflict enough damage and all of these can threaten it offensively.

Mega Kick KOes Pokemon like Rotom-W and Rotom-H on the switch after minimal damage. It is a powerful STAB move capable of letting Diggersby still muscle past Tangrowth and Celesteela; however, it will have a much harder time getting past Skarmory. Body Slam can be used over Mega Kick as a more reliable option that will still deal enough damage to KO defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss after one Swords Dance boost. Life Orb provides Diggersby with the extra power needed to break through Tangrowth with Fire Punch, while boosting the power of its Quick Attack to pick off a weakened foe. Silk Scarf should primarily be considered if opting for Mega Kick over Fire Punch to retain the extra power to break through defensive cores and ability to clean late-game with +2 Quick Attack without the drawbacks of recoil.</p> <p>Diggersby best fits on offense teams, particularly ones that can offer entry hazard support.

Other teammates like Rotom-H and Thundurus-T can help threaten Celesteela and Skarmory too. Additionally, these partners offer pivot support and can safely bring in Diggersby against their common switch-ins like Chansey. Nihilego can help check problematic Pokemon like Rotom-H and defensive Salamence for Diggersby, and in return, Diggersby assists Nihilego by threatening Chansey. Togekiss is a good partner that can ease Diggersby's Speed issues with Thunder Wave and paralyze foes such as Tentacruel and Jirachi. Heal Bell also allows Diggersby to be more aggressive against foes like Moltres. Additionally, Pokemon that threaten Togekiss, like Celesteela, can be worn down by Diggersby over time.

This helps the team make significant progress by wearing down Pokemon like Amoonguss and Tangrowth, which stop Diggersby's momentum.

  "Aegislash": {
    "overview": "<p>Aegislash's unique typing with useful resistances and immunities coupled with its great blend of offense and defense make it one of the most influential Pokemon in the tier. It can run many different sets that allow it to pick and choose its counters. A Substitute + Toxic set is one of the hardest foes to switch around and take down, as it capitalizes on Aegislash's great bulk to whittle down its common checks with Toxic damage and powerful Shadow Balls. Swords Dance Aegislash with Shadow Sneak is an incredibly threatening sweeper that can pick off many teams just after some chip damage. Mixed sets make for strong wallbreakers that are capable of 2HKOing Chansey and heavily damaging Zarude, which would otherwise be safe switch-ins. It can also effectively run an Autotomize set with Weakness Policy, which takes advantage of the many weak super effective moves thrown at it, like Tentacruel's or Nihilego's Knock Off, while fixing one of its greatest flaws in its low Speed. Its great bulk in Shield forme and Stealth Rock resistance give it points of entry into Pokemon without strong super effective attacks like Nihilego and Jirachi. Still, Aegislash suffers from a very low Speed and typing that is vulnerable to many of UU's staples, including Krookodile, Moltres, and Zarude, which can easily revenge kill it. Aegislash is also overly reliant on King's Shield to tank most neutral hits, which can make it very predictable for setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Salamence and Swords Dance Lycanroc-D to take advantage of it. Lacking reliable recovery also leaves it very vulnerable to being worn down in the course of a game, especially if it takes Knock Off from Pokemon it wants to check like Nihilego. Some mixed walls like Assault Vest Tangrowth and Celesteela can easily scout and force out Aegislash early-game, which greatly hinders its unpredictability factor and lets opponents adjust accordingly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shadow Sneak is an option as the fourth move on the King's Shield + Toxic set to pick off weakened foes, most notably setup sweepers like Necrozma and Polteageist; however, it isn't as consistently useful as other options. Steel Beam gives Choice Specs Aegislash an incredibly powerful nuke to OHKO foes like Amoonguss, but it is not preferred due to Aegislash already effectively threatening Amoonguss with its other moves and the move whittling Aegislash down rather quickly. Choice Band makes Aegislash a terrifying physical wallbreaker and makes its priority even stronger, although this set can struggle with Rocky Helmet users like Buzzwole and doesn't appreciate being locked into moves. Metal Sound exploits defensive switch-ins like Amoonguss, giving Aegislash a great chance to KO it after Stealth Rock damage. However, this isn't the most consistent move, as it is very prediction reliant and unable to punish faster Pokemon on the switch; also, even with the -2 drop, sturdier Pokemon like Assault Vest Tangrowth can still deal with Aegislash.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Aegislash notably struggles with Dark-types like Obstagoon, Zarude, and Krookodile; while it does have Close Combat to punish them if they get too careless, they still threaten it with super effective moves and can easily switch in on Shadow Ball. Galarian Moltres and Umbreon are especially troublesome, as they have the special bulk to tank Aegislash's hits and can shake off status with Rest and Heal Bell, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Walls: Mixed walls like Assault Vest Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Celesteela are very annoying for Aegislash early-game, as they aren't immediately threatened by any of its moves and can KO Aegislash in its Blade forme thanks to their lower Speed and super effective coverage. Chansey completely walls sets lacking Close Combat and can regain momentum with Teleport. However, it struggles more against Aegislash with Close Combat than the three previously mentioned.</p> <p><strong>Burn and Knock Off: Losing its passive recovery to Knock Off or a burn greatly limits the effectiveness of the King's Shield + Toxic set, making it incredibly susceptible to chip damage from weak attacks and Stealth Rock. Other sets also hate one or both of these, as special sets are very dependent on their boosting items and physical sets are significantly weaker when burned.</p> ",

Substitute allows Aegislash to get even more Toxic damage while also reducing the prediction it needs; it can also stop moves like Amonguss's Spore. King's Shield allows Aegislash to switch into its Shield forme and scout Choiced-locked foes like Krookodile and Keldeo so that it can switch into the right teammate if needed. Heavy investment in HP and Special Defense lets Aegislash switch into Pokemon like Salamence and Galarian Slowbro without fearing a 3HKO in Shield forme and cripple or attack them; this investment also stops Amoonguss's Foul Play from breaking its Substitute. 136 Speed EVs are an option to outpace Conkeldurr and everything slower.</p> <p>This set is a solid fit on semi-stall and balance teams thanks to its ability to heavily wear down Aegislash's typical checks, open up holes for its teammates, and be a solid defensive presence. Specially defensive foes that don't care about Toxic, like Celesteela and Chansey, are incredibly hard for this set to deal with, stopping it from making any progress; that's why powerful wallbreakers such as Buzzwole and Mienshao pair really well with it, and Aegislash can soften up some checks to them like Salamence with Toxic damage. Other offensive Pokemon like Jungle Healing Zarude and Obstagoon don't care what Aegislash can do to them, so sturdier walls like Tangrowth and Kommo-o pair really well with this set. Fairy-types like Primarina and Togekiss give it more security against Fighting-types and cover Aegislash's Dark weakness; Sylveon is a notable partner, giving Aegislash Wish support so that it doesn't rely solely on Leftovers for its recovery. Umbreon is another useful partner, not only providing Wish but also easily spreading Toxic and checking some nuisances for Aegislash like Moltres and Nidoking. Regenerator and a Poison typing make Amoonguss one of the most obnoxious foes against this set, meaning that offensive checks to it like Moltres and Mamoswine are natural partners. Aegislash teams need a secondary check for Tangrowth and Nihilego, as they commonly run Knock Off and can leave Aegislash horribly crippled; Pokemon like Amoonguss can achieve this exact job.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Dazzling Gleam 2HKOes Buzzwole and pressures Pokemon like Zarude and Kommo-o. Spikes, in combination with Prankster, turns Klefki into a solid entry hazard setter that can easily get them up on the first turn of a match or when it is given a free switch in. It also helps to wear down bulky Pokemon that Klefki has trouble checking, such as Rhyperior and Chansey. Thunder Wave slows down opposing Pokemon such as Keldeo and Nihilego, which gives its slower teammates more opportunities to wallbreak. It also provides Klefki with a safety net against Speed-boosting setup sweepers, such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Swords Dance + Scale Shot Kommo-o. Foul Play is used to deal with powerful physical attackers, like Gyarados. Alternatively, Toxic can be used to cripple Electric-types like Rotom-W and Rotom-H, which completely wall Klefki otherwise, as well as defensive Pokemon like Assault Vest Tangrowth. Leftovers provides Klefki with recovery, which it lacks otherwise. A specially defensive EV spread allows Klefki to check Pokemon like Salamence, Nihilego, and Galarian Moltres better. 16 Speed EVs allow Klefki to outspeed extremely fast Pokemon, such as Noivern, after paralyzing them.</p> <p>Klefki is best used on offensive teams that appreciate the early-game support that its status moves provide. Klefki gives Nidoking free opportunities to wallbreak so partners like Assault Vest Reuniclus and Rotom-W are appreciated to pressure it. Stealth Rock setters like Rhyperior and Nidoking form a solid entry hazard-stacking core with Klefki while also being able to deal with Rotom-H, a Pokemon that Klefki greatly struggles with. Pokemon that can pressure the Rotom formes are immensely important for Klefki, as they are some of its biggest counters if lacking Toxic. Kommo-o and Nihilego can deal with Rotom-H, while Zarude can take care of Rotom-W. Wallbreakers like Mamoswine and Primarina appreciate Thunder Wave slowing Pokemon that would otherwise take them out, like Gyarados and Mienshao, and Spikes weakening Buzzwole and putting Assault Vest Tangrowth within 2HKO range of Primarina's Moonblast. Water-types such as Keldeo and Azumarill are especially appreciated to take out Pokemon like Krookodile, Rhyperior, and Chandelure that force out Klefki easily. In turn, these Water-types appreciate Klefki's Spikes wearing down Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Late-game cleaners, like Gyarados and Nihilego, greatly appreciate Klefki's support wearing down bulky Pokemon like Buzzwole and Jirachi that often could wall them earlier in the game. Pokemon that can take care of Spikes blockers and removers, such as Tentacruel, Hatterene, and Starmie, are greatly valued to help Klefki keep its Spikes up for longer. Kommo-o and Salamence can take care of Tentacruel, Aegislash can take care of Hatterene, and Tangrowth and Zarude can take care of Starmie.</p> "

Furthermore, its defensive typing, access to reliable recovery, and decent bulk allow Noivern to reliably check threats like Keldeo and Zarude. Unfortunately, Noivern finds itself competing for a spot on teams with the tier's other Dragon / Flying type, Salamence. Salamence is much stronger and bulkier, which makes it a better wallbreaker and allows it to fulfill Noivern's defensive niche much more effectively than Noivern itself. However, Noivern's higher Speed, which is especially useful when dealing with massive threats like Keldeo, still makes it a solid option and a worthwhile pick over Salamence.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Super Fang can be used to weaken bulky walls like Chansey and Celesteela and make it easier for its teammates to revenge kill them while also pairing nicely with Taunt, but it's not very useful otherwise. Boomburst is another option for an attacking move, having an incredibly high Base Power without the drawbacks of Draco Meteor or Hurricane, but it is weaker and does not hit anything super effectively. Defog is a solid option, as Noivern is the fastest Defogger in the metagame and also checks common entry hazard setters like Jirachi and Kommo-o. However, Noivern struggles to fit Defog into its moveset, and if you want to run a Dragon / Flying Defogger, Salamence is a better option. Choice Specs is an option to make Noivern hit harder, but the lack of Heavy-Duty Boots makes Noivern incredibly susceptible to Stealth Rock, and thus it remains a very fringe option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Walls: Chansey brushes off all of Noivern's moves and forces it to switch out, though it does have to worry about Taunt. Rhyperior can also easily sponge Noivern's attacks except for Draco Meteor. Finally, Celesteela is only 4HKOed by Noivern's Flamethrower, allowing it to serve as an occasional check.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Pokémon like Mamoswine and Lycanroc-D can use their super effective priority moves to bypass Noivern's blistering Speed and easily take it out.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off Users: Krookodile, Tangrowth, Conkeldurr, and other common Knock Off users can remove Noivern's Heavy-Duty Boots, which severely hampers its longevity and makes it unable to perform its role as a pivot as well as it could.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Hatterene, Primarina, and Azumarill can take at least one hit and hit Noivern hard with their super effective STAB moves.

Flamethrower prevents Noivern from being completely walled by Steel-types, such as Aegislash, Jirachi, and Celesteela. U-turn is an option over either STAB move that allows Noivern to pivot out of would-be checks and bring in teammates more safely. Noivern does prefer to run both STAB moves, however.

Rotom-W can check Mamoswine and deals with Ground-types like Krookodile and Rhyperior better than Noivern can.

    "overview": "<p>Zygarde-10% is a unique wallbreaker and late-game cleaner in UU due to its exceptional Speed tier allowing it to outspeed Pokemon like Keldeo, Thundurus-T, and Lycanroc-D and giving it a great matchup against fast-paced teams. Thousand Arrows sets it apart from other Ground-types, as it can OHKO Pokemon that other Ground-types like Mamoswine struggle to break through like Rotom-W and Rotom-H. Thousand Arrows is also spammable in Grassy Terrain and against Flying-types, and the only UU Pokemon that resist it are Tapu Bulu, Buzzwole, and Tangrowth. Zygarde-10% is one of the only viable Extreme Speed users, allowing it to revenge kill weakened setup sweepers such as Gyarados. Zygarde-10% unfortunately has paper-thin defenses, meaning it cannot switch into virtually anything without taking big damage or being OHKOed. It even takes substantial damage from resisted attacks like Nihilego's Meteor Beam. Zygarde-10% also needs chip damage to OHKO many common threats like Primarina, and failing to OHKO them causes it to get slammed back. While Thousand Arrows provides great overall coverage, Zygarde-10% lacks reliable moves to overcome Grass-types like Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu, which can regain lost HP via Regenerator or Grassy Terrain, although Tapu Bulu must be wary of the possible Iron Tail.</p> ",

Dragon Dance can be used with Life Orb to allow Zygarde-10% to sweep. However, Zygarde-10% will rarely get an opportunity to set up and will still struggle against Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu. Gyarados typically outclasses this set, as it is bulkier, deals more damage, has better coverage, and can snowball with Moxie. Zygarde-10% is fast enough to run a Coil set to bolster its offensive presence and allow it to hit just as hard as Choice Band, but without locking it into one move. This will also raise its Defense to allow it to withstand an extra hit and increase its accuracy to more reliably use moves like Iron Tail. Zygarde-10% will only realistically get an opportunity to set up against something it forces out, and it will still struggle against Tangrowth even after multiple boosts.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Tangrowth totally walls Zygarde-10%, which can only use Toxic against it. Tapu Bulu has to be wary of Iron Tail but takes minimal damage from Thousand Arrows, is immune to Outrage, and can OHKO Zygarde-10%. Amoonguss is immune to Toxic and takes little damage from Thousand Arrows, forcing Zygarde-10% to lock itself into Outrage to 2HKO it, which leaves Zygarde-10% open to Spore or a switch to any Dragon-resistant Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-type Pokemon like Azumarill, Primarina, and Hatterene can freely switch in while Zygarde-10% is locked into a Dragon-type move and KO it. Additionally, while they do not handle Thousand Arrows well, they will not be KOed by it, and Primarina and Hatterene can recover lost HP with Draining Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users: Noivern can OHKO Zygarde-10% with Draco Meteor, though it doesn't switch into Thousand Arrows well. Choice Scarf users like Zarude and Krookodile can do major damage or OHKO Zygarde-10% with their strong STAB attacks. Mamoswine can OHKO Zygarde-10% with Ice Shard, and other priority users like Conkeldurr and Crawdaunt significantly reduce Zygarde-10%'s ability to stay in play.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Defensive Pokemon like Chansey and Quagsire can shrug off Thousand Arrows and inflict Toxic back. Zygarde-10%'s only chance of breaking through them is to hit them with two Outrage attacks, which leaves Zygarde-10% vulnerable to a Fairy-type switch-in.

Chandelure and Moltres can help remove these Pokemon, with the latter bringing Zygarde-10% in against the Rotom formes with U-turn. Nihilego is also an option to handle Grass-types, and it can set up Stealth Rock as well. Entry hazard setters like the aformentioned Nihilego and Krookodile can help wear down the enemy team to enable a Thousand Arrows or Outrage sweep. Rotom-H can help check Mamoswine, one of Zygarde-10%'s biggest threats, pressure the likes of Tangrowth and Buzzwole, and use Volt Switch to bring in Zygarde-10% safely. Since Zygarde-10% pressures Nidoking, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H significantly, Pokemon that struggle with them like Celesteela and Azumarill are good teammates.</p> "

Both can take on Primarina's STAB moves, but they have to scout for Choice Specs sets, as Psychic 2HKOes Amoonguss, while Moonblast 2HKOes Assault Vest Tangrowth after Stealth Rock damage. Tangrowth can, however, opt for Power Whip in place of Giga Drain to bypass Primarina's Special Defense boosts.

Ground-types such as Rhyperior and Seismitoad handle Electric-types like Thundurus-T and set Stealth Rock up to help Primarina wallbreak. Chansey walls Primarina effortlessly, so Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Kommo-o can be used to threaten it. Primarina can be easily worn down by entry hazards, so a Wish passer like Jirachi can help it stay in the match for longer. In the same vein, entry hazard removers like Salamence and Rotom-H extend Primarina's longevity.</p> "

Rest allows it to not be ruined by status such as Toxic from Aegislash and Krookodile. Moonblast is great neutral coverage while also proving super effective damage on Kommo-o and Galarian Moltres. Scald allows Primarina to get a burn on switch-ins like Amoonguss, Celesteela, and Tentacruel, negating the recovery from their items. 124 Special Defense EVs and Leftovers allow Primarina to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Chandelure's Shadow Ball and 3HKO from Salamence's Hurricane from full HP without Stealth Rock, with the rest put into Defense to take on Dragon Dance Salamence and Keldeo's Secret Sword better. Leftovers is great, as it synergizes well with Rest + Sleep Talk, but Heavy-Duty Boots is an option to negate damage from entry hazards if the team has unreliable or no hazard removal.</p> <p>RestTalk Primarina is mainly used on bulky teams that appreciate a status sponge and value the defensive qualities its typing provides. Necrozma is an excellent partner, as it can threaten Amoonguss and Tentacruel, that would otherwise counter Primarina. Zarude checks Rotom-W and Chansey while appreciating Primarina checking Keldeo and Kommo-o. Fire-types such as Rotom-H and Moltres can help check Grass-types such as Zarude and Assault Vest Tangrowth, and provide momentum with Volt Switch and U-turn. Hazard control is important for Primarina to not be chipped down easily and forced to use Rest if it is running Leftovers. Salamence removes entry hazards with Defog and checks Zarude well. Kommo-o, Rhyperior, and Assault Vest Tangrowth can all form solid defensive cores with Primarina, as they are able to check Pokemon such as Volcanion, Thundurus, and Rotom-W nicely, while Primarina checks Salamence, Keldeo, and Moltres in return.</p> "

Common checks like Amoonguss can't deal with Primarina if it uses Substitute as they come in, as Primarina is faster and can set up with Calm Mind. Substitute also eases prediction when forcing switches from Pokemon like Salamence and Kommo-o. Draining Kiss aids Primarina in recovering HP, allowing it to take more hits and use Substitute if needed. However, Draining Kiss is a very weak move and will only pose a threat if Primarina has accumulated enough boosts. Moonblast, on the other hand, is powerful from the start and lets Primarina not rely too much on Calm Mind boosts to threaten Water-resistant Pokemon like Tangrowth and Rotom-W. Scald is a reliable Water-type move, capable of burning Pokemon trying to check it, like Tentacruel, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Leftovers compensates the 25% loss in HP from Substitute. With the given EV spread Primarina is able to beat Amoonguss one-on-one, as it ensures Amoonguss can't break Primarina's Substitute after a Calm Mind.</p> <p>Substitute + Calm Mind Primarina fits best on bulky offense and balance teams, as its ability to come in on moves like Draco Meteor from Salamence is greatly appreciated by other teammates. By switching on these moves, Primarina can either get a Substitute up or set up with Calm Mind if its checks have been eliminated or weakened. Strong wallbreakers like Mamoswine, Nidoking, and Aegislash can get past bulky Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Electric-types such as Raikou and Thundurus-T force Primarina out of the field if it doesn't have a Substitute up, so Pokemon like Rhyperior and Seismitoad take care of them. They can also set Stealth Rock to aid Primarina in its sweep. Amoonguss and Tangrowth can take on strong physical attackers such as Diggersby and Mamoswine for Primarina. Chansey is extremely annoying, as it can take boosted hits with ease and threaten Primarina back with Toxic and Seismic Toss. Conkeldurr, Lycanroc-D, and Swords Dance Diggersby are powerful wallbreakers that can muscle through Chansey and remove it for Primarina.</p> "

As a result, Ribombee is a cornerstone on Sticky Web teams as the best available setter.

Access to strong coverage moves, such as Close Combat to break past Excadrill, Crunch to deal with Aegislash, and Psychic Fangs to break past Amoonguss makes Lycanroc-D very unpredictable to defensively answer. However, Lycanroc-D struggles to break through teams that run physically bulky threats such as Tangrowth, Swampert, and Skarmory. Its poor bulk also means it cannot come in on almost anything, so it requires pivot support to come in safely as well as occasional aggressive prediction on expected switches. Lycanroc-D is also very prone to wearing itself down with Life Orb recoil, limiting its staying presence on the field.</p> ",

Drill Run is nice to give Lycanroc-D excellent Rock- and Ground-type neutral coverage, but the only notable Pokemon it hits super effectively is Colbur Berry Galarian Slowbro. A Focus Sash lead Lycanroc-D is able to use Endeavor while setting up Stealth Rock, but this is generally not worth it in comparison to its other, much more dynamic sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Amoonguss and Tapu Bulu do not switch into Stone Edge well, but they resist Close Combat and threaten Lycanroc-D after switching in; the former also runs Rocky Helmet often, which punishes Lycanroc-D. Tangrowth is the biggest offender, since unboosted Close Combat damage is restored nearly completely by Regenerator, it commonly uses Rocky Helmet, and it can freely threaten Lycanroc-D's team in multiple ways after it comes in. Choice Scarf Zarude takes Accelrock well and can OHKO it with Power Whip.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Skarmory's excellent physical bulk and reliable recovery lets it effortlessly wall Lycanroc-D unless significantly chipped. It also can wear Lycanroc-D down with Rocky Helmet. Choice Scarf Jirachi resists Lycanroc-D's Accelrock and can revenge kill it with Iron Head, only having to fear the rare Sucker Punch.

However, most of the targets Psychic Fangs hits can be muscled through with Stone Edge after they have taken decent chip damage. Close Combat is a powerful coverage option that nails many Rock resistant Pokemon such as Keldeo, Krookodile, and Excadrill. Crunch hits Aegislash, Jirachi, and Galarian Slowbro harder. Accelerock is useful against offense teams, specifically keeping threats such Agility-boosted Galarian Moltres and Dragon Dance Salamence in check. It also makes Lycanroc-D more difficult to revenge kill with faster threats such as Venusaur in sun and Starmie. Sucker Punch can be used to deal more damage than Accelerock against neutral targets; however, it is only really useful for a better matchup against Choice Scarf Jirachi. A Life Orb is used to guarantee feats such as 2HKOing defensive Celesteela with Close Combat and Amoonguss with Stone Edge on the switch with Stealth Rock up.

While Tapu Bulu's typing has many useful resistances, it comes at the cost of having a lot of weaknesses to common attacking types like Fire, Ice, and Poison, meaning it struggles against staples like Entei, Mamoswine, Nidoking, and even Kommo-o due to its tendency to run Poison Jab. The tier has an abundance of defensive checks to Tapu Bulu, such as Salamence, Amoonguss, and Aegislash, which makes it difficult for Tapu Bulu to make much progress as a wallbreaker, especially when multiple of these checks are naturally found on the same team. Despite its positive traits compared to Amoonguss and Tangrowth, they still outclass it as a defensive Grass-type due to their access to Regenerator and less vulnerable typing.

Cobalion can pivot into Nihilego's attacks and exploit its weak physical defense. Celesteela is capable of taking +1 Thunderbolt and OHKOing Nihilego back with Heavy Slam. Aegislash easily switches into even boosted Nihilego and can KO it with its Steel-type STAB move or revenge kill it with Shadow Sneak.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users: Faster threats like Keldeo, Lycanroc-D, and Azelf all outspeed and threaten to OHKO Nihilego. However, these Pokemon must be wary of Nihilego getting a speed boost after getting a KO on its Meteor Beam set. Priority users like Azumarill and Crawdaunt can OHKO Nihilego with their priority moves.</p> ",

Power Gem threatens many Defoggers and hits neutral targets Sludge Wave can't, like Galarian Slowbro and Celesteela. Sludge Wave threatens Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Primarina. Knock Off cripples checks to Nihilego like Aegislash, Chansey, and Celesteela. It's also great for removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Defoggers. Grass Knot eliminates Pokemon that don't mind Power Gem + Sludge Wave, like Seismitoad and Rhyperior. However, the utility Knock Off provides is amazing, and it's only worth replacing if Nihilego's team has enough other Knock Off users. Protect scouts Choice-locked foes like Krookodile, Zarude, and Keldeo, letting Nihilego switch to the appropriate teammate. It also lets Nihilego accumulate recovery from Black Sludge and stall weather and Toxic turns. Black Sludge mitigates entry hazards and chip damage.</p> <p>This set fits on every playstyle, except hyper offense. Nihilego's team appreciates its good defensive typing and Knock Off, and its offensive capabilities are valuable for removing threats like Primarina and Salamence. Stall in particular appreciates Nihilego's good matchup against Nasty Plot Togekiss. Setup sweepers such as Salamence, Thundurus-T, and Keldeo love Nihilego setting up Stealth Rock and weakening their checks like Assault Vest Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Celesteela. Teammates like Azelf, Krookodile, and Tangrowth provide Knock Off support, giving Nihilego the option of running Grass Knot. Amoonguss and Buzzwole can check physical threats to Nihilego like Krookodile and Mienshao, while Nihilego checks Fire-types like Moltres. Aegislash has notable defensive synergy with Nihilego, as it checks Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro, Lycanroc-D, and Kommo-o. Moltres and Rotom-H deal with Steel-types that wall Nihilego, like Aegislash and Jirachi. Chansey completely walls this set even after having its Eviolite removed, so wallbreakers like Lycanroc-D and Buzzwole should take care of it. Nihilego in return can take out physically defensive Tangrowth and Salamence.</p> "

  "Celesteela": {
    "overview": "<p>Celesteela's typing and defensive stats are both fantastic, allowing it to check a considerable portion of UU's top threats, including Salamence, Jirachi, Nihilego, and Excadrill. Thanks to its decent offensive stats, powerful STAB Heavy Slam, and access to Flamethrower to smack foes like Aegislash and Zarude, Celesteela can prevent itself from being too passive. Leech Seed is also an excellent tool, sustaining Celesteela's longevity and allowing it to significantly wear down its switch-ins, such as Rotom-H and Thundurus-T, potentially forcing them out. Autotomize sets are also a strong option, tapping into Celesteela's strong special coverage and the sweeping potential Beast Boost lends it. Despite its defensive potency, however, Celesteela suffers a bit from its lack of access to reliable recovery, which can prevent it from tanking strong neutral hits as consistently as it would like to and cause it to be overreliant on Leftovers. This can allow a few common Pokemon, such as Mienshao and Mamoswine, to muscle past Celesteela after relatively minimal chip damage. Celesteela also struggles to bypass popular Fire- and Electric-types such as Moltres and Rotom-W on its own, as well as various defensive picks like Tentacruel and Slowking; Tentacruel can utilize Liquid Ooze to take advantage of Leech Seed, while Slowking doesn't take meaningful damage from any of Celesteela's attacks, can absorb Leech Seed and Teleport out, and can threaten to chip Celesteela down with burns from Scald.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Celesteela's physical movepool contains solid options like Earthquake and Stone Edge, which allow it to run a physically based Autotomize set, effectively luring checks like Tentacruel and Rotom-H. However, this generally isn't as effective due to Celesteela's middling immediate power and hardships breaking various Pokemon, such as Tangrowth and Intimidate Krookodile. Earthquake is an option in the fourth slot of the defensive set to still hit Steel-types super effectively while also hitting Tentacruel hard. However, Flamethrower is usually way more valuable for its ability to pressure Zarude while still hitting Steel-types. Toxic cripples some of Celesteela's switch-ins on the defensive set, but it generally isn't as useful as its other options, and, due to foregoing either Protect, it notably makes Celesteela more susceptible to being worn down.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types like Moltres, Volcanion, Rotom-H, and Chandelure can pivot in on both Heavy Slam and Flamethrower and hit Celesteela hard with super effective STAB moves. They can also blanket check Celesteela's Autotomize set if it opts for Flash Cannon, though Meteor Beam can power through them. Moltres is particularly annoying, often being able to restore any chip damage it sustains from Leech Seed with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Toxtricity can tank hits from either of Celesteela's sets and proceed to break past it with super effective STAB attacks, though they all take fair damage from Meteor Beam.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Chansey doesn't take major damage from Celesteela's attacks and can whittle it down with Seismic Toss or bring in a teammate with Teleport. Tentacruel's Liquid Ooze punishes Leech Seed attempts and it doesn't take major damage from any attack Celesteela commonly runs. If it is running Haze, it can also stint the Autotomize set's progress.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Celesteela's defensive set becomes far easier to wear down if Leftovers, its most reliable means of passive recovery, has been removed. Knock Off users like Mamoswine, Krookodile, and Nihilego can wear it down immensely as it tries potentially pivoting in on them. The Autotomize set is also often reliant on whichever item it is running to pose a significant offensive threat, which can prevent Celesteela from setting up on foes like Nihilego and Tangrowth as safely as it would like to at times.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Celesteela's lack of reliable recovery allows particularly powerful wallbreakers, including Primarina, Mamoswine, and Aegislash, to quickly overwhelm it.</p> ",

Leech Seed is important to wear down common switch-ins, including Moltres, Rotom-W, and Thundurus-T. It also prevents Pokemon like Gyarados and Dragon Dance Salamence from reliably setting up on Celesteela, chipping them down. Protect works well alongside Leech Seed, offering Celesteela a guaranteed opportunity to restore health with both Leftovers and Leech Seed. It can also help to scout moves from Choice-locked Pokemon, like Chandelure and Primarina.</p> <p>Celesteela is a solid fit on balance teams thanks to its ability to check several prominent threats, allowing offensive teammates to fall back on it upon losing momentum to foes like Salamence and Noivern. Bulky Water-types often share strong synergy with Celesteela, checking the Fire-types that power through it, while Celesteela can handle Pokemon like Zarude and Tapu Bulu in return. Swampert and Gastrodon check both Rotom-H and Rotom-W, two of Celesteela's more effective answers, while applying pressure to Moltres with STAB Scald. Slowking is another great partner that can bring Celesteela in safely with Teleport against foes such as Tapu Bulu and Hydreigon. Nihilego is another good teammate, pivoting in on Pokemon like Moltres and Thundurus-T for Celesteela while appreciating its ability to deal with Ground-types such as Excadrill and Nidoking. Defensive Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss can also make solid teammates, as they can pivot into threats to Celesteela like Keldeo, Azumarill, and Krookodile. They both can absorb Knock Off for Celesteela, and the former can use Knock Off itself to cripple switch-ins to Celesteela like Moltres. Zarude is another phenomonal partner capable of offensively pressuring Slowking better and revenge killing Thundurus-T.</p> "

        "name": "Autotomize",
        "description": "<p>Autotomize allows Celesteela to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and more easily snowball. It can find setup opportunities against a solid amount of common Pokemon that its defensive set forces out, including Zarude, Hatterene, and Nihilego. Fire Blast provides important coverage against Steel-types like Aegislash and Jirachi. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast for its greater accuracy. However, Celesteela wants all the power it can get due to this set's nature as a sweeper. Meteor Beam grants Celesteela an opportunity to bypass Fire-types like Rotom-H, Moltres, and Chandelure. It also deals massive damage to foes like Rotom-W, Thundurus-T, and Salamence, and the Special Attack boost it supplies is often extremely useful in boosting Celesteela's sweeping capabilities. Due to taking two turns, however, it must be used with Power Herb, and Celesteela must watch out for the opponent predicting the attack and bringing in a foe that resists it due to often being restricted to a one-time use. Flash Cannon is also an option in the fourth slot, offering more overall consistency and giving Celesteela a strong secondary STAB attack that deals decent neutral damage and hits Pokemon like Hatterene, Nihilego, and Rhyperior super effectively. Giga Drain is an option to bypass Quagsire, Rhyperior, and Rotom-W, which can otherwise tank various hits, though it generally doesn't provide too valuable of coverage otherwise. Beast Boost lets Celesteela boost its Special Attack upon netting KOs, giving it great sweeping potential. If Meteor Beam is not being run, Celesteela has no need for Power Herb and can then run Weakness Policy. This allows it to use its solid bulk to tank super effective hits, such as Fire-type moves from Salamence or opposing Celesteela, to gain a +2 boost in power, which heavily increases its threat level. This is particularly potent when Celesteela is behind dual screens, as often the only way to break past it at that rate is with super effective moves.</p> <p>This set fits on offensive builds, acting as a late-game sweeper that cleans weakened teams. Hyper offense teams do particularly well supporting Celesteela, sometimes employing dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl to increase its odds of reliably setting up. Entry hazards let Celesteela muscle past foes like Rotom-W more easily, making setters like Excadrill good options for teammates. On hyper offense teams, leads like Froslass work well for its ability to quickly set Spikes and keep up momentum with Destiny Bond, respectively. Powerful wallbreakers like Mienshao and Conkeldurr make strong teammates capable of removing foes such as Slowking and Chansey for Celesteela to sweep through late-game. Depending on the coverage it opts for, Celesteela will struggle to reliably break past various Pokemon. If it isn't running Meteor Beam, checks to Fire-types like Azumarill and Gyarados are great teammates, easily being able to pressure Rotom-H and Moltres. Without Flash Cannon, Celesteela can't hit Rock-types like Rhyperior and Nihilego super effectively, making Pokemon like Zygarde-10% and the aforementioned Azumarill solid partners. Lastly, sweepers like Thundurus-T and Aegislash often fit well with offensive Celesteela, helping pressure the likes of Slowking and Chansey.</p> "

Necrozma's high natural bulk and Prism Armor allow it to set up on many Pokemon like Nihilego and take super effective hits from threats like Lycanroc-D and even Aegislash.

However, Necrozma heavily dislikes status from threats like Chansey and Aegislash, which limits its chance to sweep. Necrozma is also limited by the number of Dark-types in the tier like Zarude, Mandibuzz, Hydreigon, and Galarian Moltres, which can all hinder at least one of its sets.

  "Polteageist": {
    "overview": "<p>Polteageist's primary role in the UU metagame is as a late-game sweeper; with support to eliminate its weaknesses to priority moves and Dark-types, it becomes a premier offensive threat. Shell Smash and powerful coverage options like Giga Drain and Stored Power make it a threatening setup sweeper that can easily OHKO much of the tier. However, Polteageist's frail defensive stats means it needs significant team support to truly be a consistent threat; while it's a powerful sweeper, it's still a predictable one due to having only one viable set, unlike other setup sweepers such as Necrozma and Kommo-o. Additionally, Polteageist struggles to break through Dark-types like Zarude and Galarian Moltres. The potential upside of using Polteageist is huge, but its weakness to entry hazards and priority alongside its inability to break through several common metagame threats can easily hamper its success. Polteageist works best with Psychic Terrain support to neutralize its weakness to priority, and while it can succeed with dual screens support, there are several other setup sweepers that require less support and are easier to justify.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>White Herb can be used in place of Focus Sash to restore the reduced defenses from Shell Smash, making Polteageist less immediately weak to priority moves like Lycanroc-D's Accelerock. Hyper Beam can be run as a nuke to nearly always OHKO Zarude while retaining the ability to OHKO Krookodile, but it's situational and leaves Polteageist open to being set up on or revenge killed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-types like Zarude, Galarian Moltres, and Incineroar, can all stomach a boosted Shadow Ball with ease, and immunity to Stored Power means they need to be weakened significantly before Polteageist can break through them. Additionally, Galarian Moltres can use Polteageist as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves: Without Psychic Terrain support, Polteageist is extremely vulnerable to priority. Defense drops from Weak Armor and Shell Smash combined with its poor defensive stats means that common priority users like Aegislash, Lycanroc-D, and Crawdaunt can easily OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards: Entry hazards break Polteageist's Focus Sash on entry, making it harder to set up, while Sticky Web prevents it from outspeeding common speed control Pokemon it otherwise would, like Choice Scarf Zarude, Barraskewda, and Choice Scarf Krookodile.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Polteageist can boost past Chansey and overwhelm it, but other special walls like Umbreon, Celesteela, and Assault Vest Tangrowth can easily check it. However, Psychic Terrain lets Polteageist muscle past Celesteela after two Shell Smash boosts.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Stored Power takes advantage of Shell Smash and Weak Armor boosts to boost its Base Power, and it provides powerful coverage. Giga Drain offers important coverage against threats like Krookodile and allows Polteageist to recover HP, eliminating entry hazard and chip damage and restoring the usefulness of a nullified Focus Sash. Weak Armor further boosts Polteageist's Speed past threats like Timid Venusaur in sun and Adamant Barraskewda in rain, and it boosts Stored Power even further.</p> <p>Psychic Terrain blocks common priority moves like Lycanroc-D's Accelerock and Mamoswine's Ice Shard and prevents them from revenge killing Polteageist. It also boosts Stored Power, allowing Polteageist to OHKO Pokemon like bulky Salamence that would otherwise tank a hit and OHKO in return. As such, Indeedee-F is a perfect partner: it sets up Psychic Terrain on the switch, it can help lure in and weaken threats like Zarude, and it can offer last-ditch support with Healing Wish. On Psychic Terrain builds, Necrozma can help weaken opposing Dark-types for Polteageist and Nihilego can work along with Polteageist as an effective sweeper. Entry hazard setters like Kommo-o and Krookodile can help weaken enemy Pokemon to make sweeping easier. Stacking other offensive threats like Gyarados and Kommo-o to weaken checks like Zarude and Galarian Moltres can help overwhelm the opponent and clear a way for Polteageist to clean up late-game.</p> "

  "Hatterene": {
    "overview": "<p>Hatterene is an imposing Calm Mind user for defensive teams to deal with because its ability Magic Bounce deflects status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave, as well as phazing attempts. Hatterene's STAB moves complement each other brilliantly and, alongside Mystical Fire, give it good matchups against entry hazard setters such as Swampert and Skarmory to block their hazards with Magic Bounce and keep pressure off of its teammates. Hatterene's typing, while offensively potent, makes it a Fairy-type that's hit neutrally by Dark-type moves and a Psychic-type weak to Poison. This greatly impedes Hatterene's ability to consistently handle Pokemon such as Galarian Moltres and Hydreigon and makes it unreliable at pressuring Tentacruel and Nihilego. It also struggles to beat Steel-types such as Jirachi and Celesteela if it does not catch them with Mystical Fire on the switch. Without a Calm Mind boost, Hatterene noticeably lacks offensive presence, which can be taken advantage of by wallbreakers such as Diggersby and Choice Specs Primarina. While it does have some good matchups against some hazard setters, it also has poor ones, such as against Jirachi and Nidoqueen, so it can require prediction to make the most out of Magic Bounce. Excadrill is a hazard setter that not only forces out Hatterene but can completely ignore Magic Bounce thanks to Mold Breaker. Hatterene's dismal Speed tier greatly limits what it can accomplish against offensive teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>On Trick Room teams, Hatterene is an effective suicide lead with Focus Sash and Misty Explosion. Magic Bounce denies entry hazards from everything bar Excadrill, and using Misty Explosion right after Trick Room gives a safe entry point for teammates such as Crawdaunt with three turns of Trick Room still remaining. Hatterene can also be an offensive threat in Trick Room with Life Orb, but this sacrifices a lot of consistency in defensive utility because of its need for Special Attack investment and Life Orb recoil. Assault Vest alongside Nuzzle is an option to make Hatterene more bulky without a boost while still crippling the likes of Aegislash and Jirachi, but it faces stiff competition from Reuniclus, which has more consistent healing with Regenerator and better bulk to handle threats such as Keldeo.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Hatterene's poor Speed, lack of consistent recovery, and reliance on a Calm Mind boost to be a consistent threat makes it easy for Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Diggersby, and Crawdaunt to revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Jirachi takes little damage from Hatterene's STAB moves and threatens it back with Iron Head, though it dislikes Mystical Fire. Aegislash is an especially detrimental offensive threat, because even if it takes Mystical Fire on the switch a weakened Shadow Ball still threatens substantial damage; the Swords Dance set can take a Mystical Fire and obliterate Hatterene with a STAB move. Celesteela does not take too much damage from Mystical Fire due to its massive special bulk, and it 2HKOes with Heavy Slam.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Hatterene has plenty of opportunities to gain a Calm Mind boost against various Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Hydreigon, though it does have to be wary of Flash Cannon from the latter. Calm Mind notably helps Hatterene stomach hits from strong attackers such as Choice Specs Keldeo better and retaliate with Draining Kiss. Draining Kiss is mandatory as a powerful recovery tool and is instrumental against Chansey; after three boosts, Draining Kiss + Leftovers will outheal Seismic Toss's damage. Psyshock is useful against opposing Calm Mind users, most notably Primarina, as well as a more immediate weapon against Chansey. Psychic is an alternative option because it OHKOes Amoonguss after one Calm Mind boost instead of two. It also helps Hatterene pressure Quagsire better with Special Defense drops. Mystical Fire is vital to deter Steel-types looking to come in on a Calm Mind or STAB move like Celesteela, Jirachi, and Aegislash. Leftovers augments the recovery from Draining Kiss and makes Hatterene harder for Pokemon such as Suicune to wear down. Hatterene needs 12 EVs in Speed to outrun Amoonguss and 56 EVs to outspeed Quagsire and help against stall, though Psychic is required for the latter Pokemon.</p> <p>Hatterene fits well on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its Magic Bounce relieving entry hazard pressure from Skarmory. Pokemon that handle hazard setters Hatterene cannot switch into well like Nidoqueen, Jirachi, and Nihilego are appreciated. Chansey and Celesteela are able to check them. Celesteela can also pivot into Excadrill. Hazard support from teammates such as Krookodile and Chansey wears down Hatterene checks such as Aegislash and Celesteela. Fire-types can blow through Steel-types that Hatterene has issues with; Rotom-H and Moltres are notably able to check Aegislash and take advantage of Celesteela. Amoonguss and Skarmory can act as secondary pivots into Mienshao and Conkeldurr as repeatedly taking hits from them and losing its Leftovers greatly diminishes its ability to clean with Calm Mind.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Obstagoon is the only Guts user with STAB Facade, allowing it to pressure physical walls such as Amoonguss with ease. Its solid bulk, decent Speed, and access to STAB Knock Off make it a unique offensive threat, being able to take out metagame staples like Rotom-W, Galarian Moltres, and most notably SubToxic Aegislash, who cannot touch Obstagoon due to its typing and status immunity. It also has an excellent matchup against slower bulkier teams because of its status immunity, ability to heal off chip damage with Rest, and high damage output with STAB Knock Off. Due to its poor defensive typing, Obstagoon is easily revenge killed by common threats like Thundurus-T and Lycanroc-D. The abundance of Fighting-types like Buzzwole, Keldeo, and Kommo-o is especially problematic for Obstagoon due to its 4x weakness to fighting moves. Also, it tends to have poorer matchups against hyper offense, as teams pack more faster threats that give Obstagoon few opportunities to wallbreak, although it still can potentially pick up a KO or two. Obstagoon hates Knock Off as it cannot activate Guts without its Flame Orb, severly limiting its threat level. Its overreliance on Sleep Talk isn't ideal, as it relies on RNG to click the correct move. Obstagoon is generally outclassed by other offensive Dark-types like Krookodile and Zarude due to their better defensive utility and less reliance on their item.</p> ",
