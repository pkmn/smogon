  "Gardevoir": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Gardevoir is an admirable offensive nuke in the 1v1 metagame, able to set up on and one-shot several bulky Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, Tapu Lele, and Zygarde-C with a Pixilate-boosted Hyper Beam. In addition, Mega Gardevoir also has access to tools such as Hyper Voice to provide coverage against Substitute users, as well as access to utility options in the form of Will-O-Wisp and Calm Mind, which can be very useful in breaking through physically offensive threats such as Dragonite, Donphan, and Golem and bulkier special attackers such as Tapu Lele, Primarina, and Tapu Fini. Before Mega Evolving, the ability Trace allows Gardevoir to acquire the ability of its foe, which is indispensable against certain Pokemon such as Dragonite and Mega Gyarados. Unfortunately, its naturally poor defenses leaves Mega Gardevoir quite vulnerable to faster physical attackers that populate the metagame, such as Mega Lopunny, Garchomp, Mega Pinsir, and Choice Scarf Haxorus. It also has a terrible matchup against most of the Steel-types in the metagame, which all resist both Mega Gardevoir's Fairy- and Psychic-type STAB moves, such as Mega Metagross, Magearna, and Mega Mawile.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Icy Wind, in tandem with moves like Hyper Beam, Focus Blast or Hidden Power Ground, and Taunt, is an excellent speed control option that is useful in reliably taking down Pokemon like stall Deoxys-S and Crustle. Most of these Pokemon, while weak to a standard Hyper Beam from Mega Gardevoir, have ways to get around this through moves and abilities, but by lowering their Speed, Mega Gardevoir can prevent any kind of counterplay on their end. Running Icy Wind + Hidden Power Ground or Focus Blast also enables Mega Gardevoir to lure and beat the ever-present Magnezone. Run Hidden Power Ground for consistency against Magnezone and Focus Blast if you want to be able to potentially knock out other Pokemon such as Heatran and Mega Aggron. Note that Mega Gardevoir must have at least 321 Speed, or 224 Speed EVs with a Timid nature, in order to outspeed Magnezone after Icy Wind every time, after being potentially hit by Zap Cannon. However, this sacrifices the raw power gained through Hyper Beam, which is important against Pokemon such as Porygon-Z, Landorus-T, and Incineroar.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-type Pokemon unfortunately resist both of Mega Gardevoir's STAB options and simultaneously hit it back with powerful and unresisted or super effective damage. Beware of Pokemon such as Mega Metagross, Mega Mawile, Genesect, Mega Aggron, Celesteela, Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Jolly Kartana.</p> <p><strong>Fast Physical Threats: While Mega Gardevoir can take advantage of Will-O-Wisp to neutralize the damage dealt by slower, bulkier physical Pokemon, it will have a hard time dealing with most faster physical attackers that it encounters, as the damage dealt by the initial attack will often be too much for Mega Gardevoir to contend with. Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Groundium Z Garchomp, Choice Scarf Haxorus, Mega Pinsir, and Victini will easily punch a hole into Mega Gardevoir.</p> <p><strong>Fast Poison-types: Mega Gardevoir is weak to super effective Poison-type damage, so Pokemon like Naganadel, Nihilego, and Gunk Shot Greninja with reasonable Attack will be able to OHKO Mega Gardevoir.</p> <p><strong>Exceptionally Specially Defensive Pokemon: While Mega Gardevoir does have the ability to boost its Special Attack enough to allow it to beat most naturally specially defensive Pokemon, there are a few exceptions that are able to beat Mega Gardevoir before Mega Gardevoir can beat them. Z-Thunder Wave Togekiss can tank a Hyper Beam from speedy bulky Mega Gardevoir and follow up with Thunder Wave followed by Air Slash, and Meloetta will be able to set up Calm Mind alongside Mega Gardevoir while also being able to naturally tank Hyper Beam and take little damage from Psyshock, unlike Tapu Lele.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyper Beam is Mega Gardevoir's main offensive tool, able to obliterate almost anything it touches super effectively in a single shot, Mega Altaria, Kommo-o, and Mega Sableye, as well as knock out many frailer neutrally effective threats, such as offense Landorus-T, Porygon-Z, and Vivillon. Beware of the recharge after using Hyper Beam, so only use it once a KO is guaranteed. Calm Mind allows Mega Gardevoir to safely obtain the offensive capabilities needed in order to beat specially defensive threats such as bulky Tapu Lele, Tapu Fini, Primarina, Mew, and Manaphy. Hyper Voice allows Mega Gardevoir to hit past Substitutes from Pokemon such as Torrent Greninja, Serperior, and Jumpluff. Psyshock is Mega Gardevoir's Psychic-type STAB option, allowing it to hit Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur super effectively, as well as hitting Fire-types such as Rotom-H and Mega Charizard Y for neutral damage. Will-O-Wisp serves as a way to improve Mega Gardevoir's subpar physical bulk by halving the foe's Attack. This is indispensable in beating Multiscale or Sturdy Pokemon such as Dragonite, Donphan, Golem, and non-Choice Scarf Sawk, as well as generally bulky attackers like Mega Tyranitar. Protect can also potentially be run with a defensive spread in order to lure in physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, evading its Fake Out. Encore or Taunt can be used to break down stall or bulky Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro, Jumpluff, and Porygon2. Laser Focus along with Calm Mind allows Mega Gardevoir to blast through opposing Calm Mind users that Psyshock cannot reliably defeat, such as Magearna, Meloetta, and opposing Mega Gardevoir, as well as poke a hole through stall Pokemon such as Clefable and stall Necrozma.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>240 HP EVs allow Mega Gardevoir to take a Hyper Beam from Choice Scarf Modest Porygon Z, along with improving Mega Gardevoir's general physical bulk in the process. Maximum Speed is run to allow Mega Gardevoir to outspeed Pokemon like non-Choice Scarf Haxorus, as well as anything slower, such as Tapu Lele and Vivillon. It also gives you a chance to beat other base 100 Speed Pokemon, like Mega Charizard Y and opposing Mega Gardevoir. The leftover 16 EVs go into Defense, improving Mega Gardevoir's chances against Poison Jab from Choice Scarf Haxorus and a Fake Out into Ice Punch from Mega Medicham. Mega Gardevoir is powerful enough as is to not require investment into Special Attack. Gardevoir runs Trace before Mega Evolving, allowing it to copy very useful abilities for certain matchups, such as Multiscale against Dragonite, Intimidate against Mega Gyarados and Landorus-T, and Volt Absorb against Electrium Z Zeraora.</p> <p>If running Protect, Mega Gardevoir should use a 120 HP / 252 Def / 136 Spe spread with a Timid nature in order to beat Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Mega Blaziken, and Choice Band Garchomp, as well as being able to outspeed base 85 Speed Pokemon like Tapu Fini. A spread of 248 HP / 4 SpA / 148 SpD / 108 Spe and a Calm Nature can also be used in order to lure in and beat Naganadel, as well as still outspeed Adamant Mega Gyarados.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Some Pokemon, like Tapu Lele and Mew, can have Calm Mind of their own, and can match your Calm Mind; if they use that, use Hyper Voice into Hyper Beam after maxing out your Special Attack, or Psyshock after one Calm Mind against Tapu Lele and two for Mew to 2HKO them. Tapu Fini is a noteworthy matchup. It runs either Tapunium Z and Brine or its own Calm Mind in order to attempt to maintain its position against special setup Pokemon. Against the former variant one of two scenarios can occur; either Tapu Fini is offensive and thus will KO Mega Gardevoir with Brine turn 2, in which case the solution is to use Calm Mind turn 1 and use Hyper Beam after, or Tapu Fini will be specially defensive, in which case Mega Gardevoir can set up Calm Mind both turns and then OHKO with Hyper Beam turn 3. The same scenario with Tapu Lele plays out against Calm Mind Tapu Fini, although since Tapu Fini cannot learn Psyshock of its own, it is safe to boost alongside Tapu Fini, at which point you can either knock it out with Hyper Voice into Hyper Beam after you both reach +6 Special Attack and Special Defense, or Psyshock after getting to +2 to 2HKO. Mega Gyarados is a special case; while it may seem like a safer option to use Will-O-Wisp, this is actually not the optimal play, as this will risk a miss. Simply use Hyper Voice twice, or Psyshock turn 1 and Hyper Beam after; this covers every single play a standard Mega Gyarados can make, as Hyper Beam OHKOes if they Mega Evolve.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gardevoir is susceptible to Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-type Pokemon, making Ground-types generally great options for teammates. Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Zygarde-C, Krookodile, Garchomp, and Excadrill, given the right individual sets, can all beat several prominent threats to Mega Gardevoir, such as Heatran, Magearna, Magnezone, and Mega Metagross. For most of these, Groundium Z should be run, although Pokemon like Landorus-T and Garchomp have a little leg room and can afford to run Choice items. Besides Ground-types, Fire-types with positive matchups against special attackers and other Fire-types work well with Mega Gardevoir. In particular, specially defensive Mega Charizard X can provide the backbone necessary to handle faster threats such as most Steel-types, Mega Charizard Y, Gunk Shot Greninja, Naganadel, Meloetta, and faster physical threats that can obliterate Mega Gardevoir, such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Pinsir. Heatran is also notable, as it can effectively check Mega Charizard X, Togekiss, and Mega Aggron. In return, Mega Gardevoir patches up the weaknesses these Pokemon share with bulky special attackers, like Tapu Fini, Tapu Lele, Primarina, and Mega Venusaur.</p> "

  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnezone is one of the best Sturdy Pokemon in the 1v1 metagame, with impressive Special Attack, excellent typing, and notable natural bulk. Thanks to its ability Sturdy, it is guaranteed to survive any singular attack - disregarding Mold Breaker - when it is at full HP and fire back with a powerful Gigavolt Havoc, immediately knocking out frail offensive Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Porygon-Z, Genesect, and Kartana. Magnezone also has an excellent matchup against bulkier offense and stall Pokemon, as it can utilize Metal Sound and Electroweb to lower the foe's Special Defense in order to OHKO with Gigavolt Havoc and outspeed opposing Pokemon to avoid them recovering health or boosting their own Special Defense before Magnezone can land a solid hit, which allows it to beat Pokemon such as Magearna, Tapu Lele, bulky Mega Gardevoir, Normalium Z Porygon-Z, and even Pokemon like Chansey, Blissey, and non-Amnesia Mega Venusaur. While Magnezone can get the job done mostly with those three moves, it also has access to useful utility options such as Protect and Mirror Coat, as well as a secondary STAB move in the form of Flash Cannon for consistent damage. Unfortunately, Magnezone's middling base 60 Speed means that it needs to invest heavily in order to outspeed relevant threats even after an Electroweb. Magnezone also has trouble against Pokemon that can tank the damage done through Gigavolt Havoc and Pokemon that prevent Magnezone from utilizing Metal Sound, such as Mega Charizard X, Dragonite, bulky Mega Metagross, and bulky Mega Tyranitar, as well as any Ground-type Pokemon, such as Zygarde, Landorus-T, Donphan, Golem, and Excadrill.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Ice can be run on Electrium Z sets to OHKO offensive Landorus-T, but the lost utility of other moves is quite noticeable. Magnezone can also utilize a bulky Choice Specs set with an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA and a Modest nature with Thunderbolt, Flash Cannon, Hidden Power Ice, and Mirror Coat in order to have stronger matchups against Pokemon it couldn't reliably beat before, such as Garchomp, Tapu Bulu, Zygarde, and Landorus-T. Choice Specs can also run Hyper Beam over Mirror Coat in order to lure and beat non-Substitute, non-specially defensive Mega Charizard X, but those variants of Mega Charizard X are unlikely to be found in high-level competitive play. Besides these few minor matchups, Choice Specs Magnezone is generally outclassed by Electrium Z, as it can no longer beat the bulky offense or stall Pokemon it could previously. An Air Balloon, in tandem with Electroweb and Thunderbolt, can be utilized in order to reliably beat one of the best Pokemon in the tier, Mega Gyarados. Mega Gyarados will often run Earthquake in order to OHKO Magnezone, as it is able to ignore Sturdy through Mold Breaker. Air Balloon prevents Mega Gyarados from immediately using Earthquake and allows Magnezone to instead lower Mega Gyarados's Speed through Electroweb and finish the job with Thunderbolt. Mega Gyarados, meanwhile, is unable to OHKO Magnezone, even with a boosted Waterfall or Crunch. Magnet Rise can also be used to lure and beat slow Ground-type Pokemon, namely Donphan and Golem, alongside either Hidden Power Ice or Flash Cannon for coverage; if you want Magnezone to maintain its Electrium Z, however, in running both Magnet Rise and a coverage move, Magnezone loses the ability to run either Electroweb or Metal Sound.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Pokemon with Electric-type Immunities: Pokemon that are completely unaffected by Gigavolt Havoc will basically hard wall Magnezone, as any coverage move that Magnezone can muster will not be reliable against these threats. They include threats such as Donphan, Golem, Landorus-T, Zygarde, Garchomp, Mega Swampert, Excadrill, Zeraora, Thundurus-T, and Alolan Marowak. Choice Specs can handle a few of these, notably Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Garchomp, but the other Pokemon will soundly defeat Magnezone.</p> <p><strong>Fast or Offensive Dragon- and Grass-type Pokemon: Offensive variants of Pokemon that resist Gigavolt Havoc and can in turn knock Magnezone out with standard Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type coverage moves, such as Dragonite, Mega Charizard X, Kommo-o, Jumpluff, and offensive Tapu Bulu.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Offensive Pokemon: Certain Pokemon that can naturally tank a neutral Gigavolt Havoc and follow up with super effective moves, such as bulky Mega Metagross, Mega Tyranitar, offensive Mew, and Choice Scarf Hoopa-U can beat Magnezone.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker Users: Pokemon such as Earthquake Mega Gyarados, Haxorus, Hawlucha, and Rampardos can all ignore Magnezone's Sturdy and OHKO it with strong super effective moves before Magnezone even has a chance to attack.</p> <p><strong>Faster Sturdy Users: The fastest Sturdy Pokemon in the 1v1 metagame possess the tools necessary in order to beat Magnezone, as they can naturally tank anything Magnezone can throw at them. These include Pokemon such as Carracosta, Sawk, and Magneton. Carracosta can hit Magnezone with a strong special Hydro Vortex followed up by an Aqua Jet, Sawk can either use a Choice Scarf to still outspeed Magnezone after Electroweb or use Rock Tomb to match Electroweb's Speed drop, and Magneton can utilize Electroweb and Hidden Power Ground in order to take care of Magnezone.</p> ",

        "name": "Electrium Z Offense",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Zap Cannon is used to get the highest-Base Power Gigavolt Havoc possible from Magnezone to blast away Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Porygon-Z, and Mega Slowbro. Metal Sound is paramount in blasting through several viable bulky offense and stall Pokemon, such as Magearna, Tapu Lele, and even slow Mega Venusaur. Electroweb reduces an opposing Pokemon's Speed by one stage while also simultaneously dealing chip damage. This may seem irrelevant, but it is very important in some bulky offense matchups, such as against Tapu Lele and Magearna. After they have been hit by Electroweb, they will be slower than Magnezone, thus avoiding any potential mind games. Protect allows Magnezone to evade Fake Out damage coming from Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Blastoise, and Mega Medicham, allowing it to preserve its Sturdy and blast these Pokemon with Gigavolt Havoc while living their attacks. Flash Cannon gives Magnezone consistent and relatively effective damage when compared to Electroweb and provides relevant Steel-type coverage to hit and reliably beat certain Fairy-type Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, slow Tapu Bulu, and Whimsicott. Mirror Coat allows Magnezone to counterattack Choice item Pokemon it could not beat otherwise, such as Naganadel, Necrozma, and Nihilego, as well as dissuading other special attackers from using their strongest attacks immediately, which can apply pressure against Pokemon such as special Dragonite, Hidden Power Ground Greninja, and Aegislash.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>80 HP EVs make sure Seismic Toss from Pokemon like Chansey and Blissey cannot 3HKO Magnezone, allowing it to decrease their Special Defense with three Metal Sounds and OHKO them with Gigavolt Havoc. 224 Speed EVs allow Magnezone to outspeed speedy Tapu Lele after one Electroweb and avoid potential mind games against it, as well as slightly slower Pokemon such as fast Magearna and Normalium Z Porygon-Z. The rest is put into Special Attack in order to make sure Magnezone can hit as hard as possible. Sturdy is run in order to prevent taking fatal damage from Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Greninja, Genesect, Choice item Victini, and Archeops.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If it can, Magnezone has two courses of action: if Magnezone is faster, it should start using Metal Sound immediately in order to get the foe in range of Gigavolt Havoc. This will ensure victory against Pokemon such as any slow variant of Magearna, Chansey, Blissey, and stall Mega Venusaur, as they will neither be able to do enough damage nor raise their Special Defense fast enough before Magnezone OHKOes them. If Magnezone is slower, generally the play is to use Electroweb before using Metal Sound to get the opposing Pokemon in range of a Gigavolt Havoc. Magnezone wants to be faster than its foe, as this allows it to properly react to recovery moves, Special Defense setup, or attacks and avoid several mind games. This will also get the foe in range of a Gigavolt Havoc while outspeeding the next turn, thus avoiding a 2HKO from Normalium Z Porygon-Z, bulky Magearna, Choice Specs Tapu Lele, and Choice Band Sawk. There are a few fringe cases where Magnezone's utility options come into play. In situations where Magnezone is in a losing matchup that can still be affected by Electric-type attacks, such as Mega Charizard X, Firium Z Victini, and Rock Tomb Sawk, the only possible way to win at this point is to use Zap Cannon and hope for it to hit and cause paralysis. If this happens, immediately use Gigavolt Havoc on turn two and continue attacking with the most accurate moves at your disposal afterwards. This is by no means a repeatable or reliable strategy, but it should be known how to handle these matchups, should you ever face them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pair Magnezone with Pokemon that can defend it against the multitude of Ground- and Dragon-types that most often threaten it. Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, Tapu Fini, Modest Greninja, bulky Tapu Lele, and defensive Mega Swampert all prove excellent in taking on a large range of threats, such as Dragonite, Mega Charizard X, Landorus-T, Donphan, Kommo-o, Golem, and Garchomp. In return, Magnezone can provide protection against overwhelming offensive threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Tapu Lele, Magearna, and Porygon-Z, which can give all of those Pokemon trouble. Magnezone can also work well in a Dragon / Steel / Fairy core, as it will appreciate the work put in from Dragon-type Pokemon such as Kommo-o and Dragonite, which can handle several threats to Magnezone such as Donphan, Golem, and offensive Mega Venusaur and in return appreciate the defense Magnezone provides against Fairy-type Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Tapu Fini, and Mega Mawile. Fairy-type Pokemon such as Alolan Ninetales and Mega Gardevoir can beat Dragon-, Ground-, and Grass-type threats like Kyurem, Garchomp, and Tapu Bulu while appreciating Magnezone's favorable matchup against Pokemon that resist Fairy-type attacks, such as Genesect, Celesteela, and Durant. Also pair Magnezone with faster Pokemon such as Flame Charge Mega Charizard X, Greninja, and Mega Lopunny, as Magnezone is naturally slow and cannot outspeed Pokemon such as Jumpluff and even Smeargle, which take advantage of any slow Pokemon.</p> "

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatran's excellent typing of Fire / Steel and ability in Flash Fire give it handy resistances to types such as Grass, Fairy, Steel, Dragon, Normal, Psychic, and Ice as well as immunities to Fire and Poison. In addition to the resulting ability to wall these types, it has a wide movepool with a lot of options. For offense, STAB and coverage moves such as Overheat, Flash Cannon, Earth Power, and Rock Tomb let Heatran also hit many Fire-, Poison-, Ice-, Fairy-, and Steel-type Pokemon for super effective damage, such as Charizard and Tapu Lele, and Grassium Z + Solar Beam covers its weaknesses to Water- and Ground-type Pokemon. Along with having fantastic offensive options, Heatran also comes with utility in the form of Metal Sound, letting it beat specially bulky Pokemon such as Blissey and Chansey, and Taunt, allowing it to shut down setup-reliant Pokemon such as Stored Power Necrozma. This is further complemented by Heatran's massive Special Attack stat and solid bulk. However, Heatran is weak to Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type moves, all common offensive types in the metagame wielded by Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Lopunny, and Zygarde-C. On top of that, since it has to use Grassium Z in order to use Solar Beam to cover Water- and Ground-types, it can't use Air Balloon, leaving it vulnerable to Pokemon such as Donphan and Garchomp, which carry ground moves while not fearing an OHKO from Bloom Doom.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf can be used for a fast Heatran that maximizes its coverage to beat Pokemon that normally outspeed it and KO such as non-Choice Scarf Durant. Firium Z, while it seems powerful, doesn't accomplish as much as its standard sets, only giving it a more consistent matchup against Mega Venusaur and Kyurem. Will-O-Wisp is great for halving Attack on physical attackers such as Aggron.</p> <h1>Checks And Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon with Ground-type Moves: Pokemon such as Kyurem and Dragonite that can tank a hit from Heatran while popping its Air Balloon and then fire off a powerful 4x super effective Ground-type move can make quick work of it. Zygarde-C gets special mention here, since Thousand Arrows can bypass Air Balloon and hit Heatran for 4x super effective damage whether its Air Balloon is intact or not.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Water-types: If Heatran isn't carrying Bloom Doom, powerful Water-type Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Primarina can quickly KO it, and even if Heatran brings it, faster Water-types like Mega Gyarados and Greninja can just KO Heatran first.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Heatran also has a Fighting weakness, leaving it vulnerable to the likes of Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Pheromosa.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Pokemon such as Seismic Toss Chansey and Blissey, Meloetta, and Z-Conversion Porygon-Z can easily outdamage Heatran, although they lose to Metal Sound.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Overheat is Heatran's main way of dealing STAB damage to Pokemon such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Magearna. Since the battle ends after one Pokemon faints, the Special Attack drop isn't a worry unless it doesn't KO the foe. Rock Tomb is used to outpace Donphan and Magnezone, which otherwise outspeed Heatran after a Rock Tomb or Electroweb, and also beats Mega Charizard X and Y, hitting Mega Charizard X that hasn't Mega Evolved and Mega Charizard Y regardless. Earth Power lets Heatran hit Ground-weak Pokemon resistant to Overheat such as Mega Charizard X and Naganadel, as well as helping in the mirror matchup. Flash Cannon is Heatran's secondary Steel-type STAB attack for Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir and Tapu Lele, while Taunt lets Heatran beat setup-reliant foes such as Type: Null, Stored Power Necrozma, and Chansey and Blissey that are carrying Toxic over Seismic Toss. Hidden Power Ice gives Heatran a fighting chance against Landorus-T and Garchomp.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Air Balloon temporarily negates Heatran's 4x Ground weakness, meaning that Pokemon like Donphan and Garchomp have to break the item with another attack before striking with a Ground-type move, buying Heatran time to KO them back. 120 Speed EVs allow Heatran to outspeed base 100 Pokemon like Mew and Victini after Rock Tomb, and naturally outspeed Modest Magnezone and maximum Speed Donphan from the start. The given Special Defense investment allows Heatran to take Modest Magnezone's Electrium Z-boosted Zap Cannon, turning the match into a coinflip where Magnezone only wins if it successfully paralyzes Heatran with a Zap Cannon. The given physical bulk investment allows Heatran to survive a Hammer Arm from Jolly Mega Metagross, while 188 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature maximize Heatran's damage output with the remaining EVs it has to work with. If you're running Hidden Power Ice, you'll want to have maximum Special Attack investment.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Overheat is a powerful nuke move but has the drawback of lowering Heatran's Special Attack two stages if it doesn't KO the target, so only use it when you are sure it will KO. You almost always want to use Rock Tomb on a foe with Sturdy such as the aforementioned Magnezone and Donphan, as that will usually guarantee a KO the next turn and keeps Heatran's Speed higher than theirs if they use a Speed-lowering move as well. Don't bother trying to predict when Mega Charizard X will mega evolve, as you can still beat it regardless by just reacting to when it does mega evolve.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Magearna, Mega Gardevoir, Tapu Lele, and Mega Altaria are good teammates for Heatran, since they remove physical threats such as Mega Gyarados, Zygarde-C, and Mega Lopunny and benefit from Heatran's ability to beat Steel-, Fire-, and Poison-types such as Magnezone, Charizard, and Naganadel. Furthermore, Pokemon that can remove Water-types such as Zeraora, Magnezone, Mega Venusaur, and Kartana are also great partners for Heatran. Mega Venusaur particularly likes how Heatran removes the Steel-, Flying-, and Psychic-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Charizard Y, and Tapu Lele that otherwise give it a hard time.</p> "

Ancient Power lets Heatran beat both Mega Charizard X and Y without the need for Earth Power. Taunt handles foes like Type: Null and non-Seismic Toss Blissey and Chansey by shutting down their ability to recover or passively harm Heatran, and Metal Sound can be used to lower the opposing Pokemon's Special Defense, allowing Heatran to beat otherwise insurmountable threats like Z-Conversion Porygon-Z, Calm Mind Meloetta, and Seismic Toss Chansey.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs let Heatran outspeed Water-types such as Adamant Mega Swampert, bulky Tapu Fini, bulky Krookodile, and Primarina.

Unfortunately, The omnipresence of powerful Ground- and Fire-types like Zygarde-C, Landorus-T, Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and Donphan can make it tricky for Aegislash to take hits and retaliate, and they are notably unaffected by King's Shield. Stance Change can additionally be exploited by Substitute users such as Mega Metagross and Zeraora to leave Aegislash far more vulnerable to attacks. Metal Sound's low accuracy can prove troublesome against bulkier Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur, possibly being detrimental if it fails to connect.

However, Swords Dance is generally inferior to Metal Sound, as it's unaffected by Intimidate and moves like Charm and Will-O-Wisp. Using Steelium Z with Flash Cannon offers solid damage output against Pokemon that take little or nothing from Shadow Ball and Never-Ending Nightmare, like Mega Tyranitar and Porygon-Z, but this trades off doing significant damage to more viable Pokemon like Magnezone and Mega Slowbro. Magnet Rise with 252 Speed EVs allows Aegislash to win against Golem and Donphan, but having to run Speed investment takes away Aegislash's bulk. Moreover, Zygarde-C and Landorus-T are still capable of outspeeding Aegislash and can OHKO it with Tectonic Rage. Occa Berry or Choice Scarf with Head Smash functions as a lure to Pokemon like Mega Charizard X and Volcarona, but this sacrifices the sheer power provided by Ghostium Z and is overall less consistent, Occa Berry especially against Substitute variants.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: The likes of Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Greninja possess a resistance to Aegislash's Ghost-type moves and can retaliate with their respective super effective STAB moves. Mega Gyarados and Greninja resist both Shadow Ball and Flash Cannon, and the former can comfortably take Never-Ending Nightmare thanks to its immense special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types: Normal-types like Mega Lopunny and Meloetta are immune to Aegislash's mono-Ghost coverage and slowly whittle away at it in return. Type: Null can also shrug off Flash Cannon by virtue of Confide and immense special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Mega Charizard X and Y, Heatran, and Volcarona all annihilate Aegislash with their respective STAB moves. Mega Charizard X must be cautious of King's Shield, however.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Pokemon like Landorus-T, Zygarde-C, and Donphan can KO Aegislash with ease, even potentially bursting through King's Shield with a Tectonic Rage.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Users of Substitute, such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Pinsir, can burn Aegislash's Z-Crystal and ease prediction with King's Shield. Aegislash also has to constantly predict attacking in its favor in order to successfully break through Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Slower Pokemon: Mega Sableye and Avalugg aren't common but can withstand a Never-Ending Nightmare and retaliate with Metal Burst and Mirror Coat, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users: Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Kommo-o can prevent the use of Metal Sound and King's Shield through Taunt, which are imperative to Aegislash's success.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Metal Sound lowers the target's Special Defense, strengthening Aegislash's matchups versus bulky Pokemon like Mega Venusaur, as well as powering through users of Calm Mind like Magearna and Tapu Fini. Laser Focus allows Aegislash's next move to always be a critical hit the next turn, which bypasses stat boosts from Amnesia users like Mega Venusaur and Registeel, and is perfectly accurate, improving consistency, but it can be blocked completely by Substitute. Shadow Ball is a powerful STAB move that hits most of the metagame neutrally and is turned into a devastating nuke through Ghostium Z. Shadow Sneak picks off targets that survive Aegislash's attacks at low health, particularly users of Sturdy such as Magnezone, as well as bulky targets such as Magearna. King's Shield provides protection from attacks, scouts for Z-Moves, reverts Aegislash back into Shield Forme, and punishes physical attackers that make contact, like Victini. Flash Cannon operates as a secondary STAB move that deals decent damage to Pokemon the top metagame threats of Meloetta and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Special Attack investment allows Aegislash to stomach attacks and hit back as hard as possible with Shadow Ball. 4 Special Defense investment ensures that Genesect doesn't receive a Special Attack boost from Download. A Quiet Nature is preferred in order to not take away from Shadow Sneak's power. Ghostium Z converts Shadow Ball into Never-Ending Nightmare, dealing heavy damage in tandem with Metal Sound.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Watch out for Substitute users like Mega Metagross, as they can leave Aegislash open to attacks in Blade forme. Exercise caution when using King's Shield against Pokemon with setup moves, like Mega Charizard X, as mispredicting can result in the foe setting up on this turn and beating Aegislash. Feel free to use Metal Sound in advantageous matchups, like against Ferrothorn and Mega Heracross, as these Pokemon have little to hit Aegislash back with, and maintaining Shield forme before attacking increases its chances of surviving. This can also be used against bulkier foes like Mega Venusaur and Magearna, ensuring that Never-Ending Nightmare can net an OHKO. While they're uncommon, be cautious of slower attackers like Avalugg and Mega Sableye, which can take any one hit and fire back with Mirror Coat or Metal Burst, respectively. Shadow Sneak can be used to pick off a target that survives on low health. Metal Sound's high PP count bolsters Aegislash's matchups against passive Normal-types like Chansey and Type: Null, as it's perfectly capable of PP stalling them despite only running mono-Ghost attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Answers to offensive Normal-types are mandatory, as Aegislash has no way of dealing damage to them. The likes of Mega Lopunny, Blaziken, and Sawk put immense offensive pressure on such Pokemon. These Pokemon are also solid picks against fast, frail threats to Aegislash such as Porygon-Z and Greninja. Bulky Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Mega Altaria match up well against Mega Gyarados, a common and otherwise threatening prospect for Aegislash. Mega Gyarados is not only one of Aegislash's greatest counters but also one of its best partners, able to break through troubling users of Sturdy like Donphan and Golem, as well as taking on Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Blaziken lacking Electric-type coverage. Golem, Donphan, Garchomp, and Crustle additionally fare well against the likes of both Mega Charizard, Volcarona, and Heatran. Tapu Lele and Tapu Fini possess the ability to beat Pokemon that threaten Aegislash such as Z-Conversion Porygon-Z and the previously mentioned Mega Charizard.</p> "

However, Avalugg loses to many Pokemon able to counteract Sturdy, such as Mew, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Charizard X, Pain Split Magearna, and Fake Out users such as mixed Zeraora, Mega Medicham, and Incineroar. Furthermore, many specially offensive Pokemon that Avalugg would otherwise beat with Mirror Coat have ways to PP stall its most effective set due to Choice Band's lock-in, such as Meloetta, Tapu Lele, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Venusaur. Lastly, even with Choice Band, Avalugg's STAB attack in Avalanche only has 60 Base Power if the foe doesn't attack it, meaning it can struggle to break through many physical walls such as Mega Swampert and Clefable.</p> ",

Superpower is preferred over Earthquake to hit Air Balloon Heatran and Choice Band Kartana. Earthquake, however, can be used for a better matchup versus Aegislash and non-mixed Zeraora and to solidify matchups versus non-Will-O-Wisp Victini and Bulk Up Mega Blaziken. Stone Edge is used to hit a variety of threats, such as Mega Charizard Y and Flyinium Z Gyarados, and is the go-to move if Avalanche doesn't have a chance to win due to its raised critical hit chance. Lastly, Mirror Coat is used to beat many special attacking Pokemon, OHKOing them in conjunction with Sturdy, such as Genesect and Choice Specs Meloetta. Gyro Ball with a Brave nature and minimum Speed IVs is a notable option, as it beats Tapu Lele through Z-Reflect and takes out Leech Seed Tapu Bulu.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Band along with 248 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature allows Avalugg to hit as hard as possible after tanking a hit, securing wins versus Dragonite, Garchomp, Will-O-Wisp Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona. 240 HP EVs maximize Avalugg's physical bulk, allowing it to have a better matchup versus threats like bulky Mega Gyarados and maximize damage done back through Mirror Coat. 20 Special Defense EVs solidify the Greninja matchup, allowing Avalugg to tank two Ice Beams from Choice Specs variants and 2HKO back with Avalanche while also beating Hydro Cannon, Dark Pulse, and Grass Knot sets. Sturdy allows Mirror Coat to function properly, as well as letting Avalugg take extremely powerful physical attacks coming from Choice Band Archeops and Darmanitan.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avalanche should be chosen when facing off against Greninja, as it will 2HKO or OHKO Choice Specs Greninja no matter the move it uses, outside of Hidden Power Fire. You should use Superpower against Petaya Berry, Waterium Z, or Choice Specs + Hidden Power Fire variants, however, to get the best chance of victory. Many matchups involve picking between choosing Mirror Coat on a predicted attack and an attacking move on a predicted non-attacking move; for example, against Kommo-o, you must use either Avalanche on a predicted Taunt PP stalling attempt or Close Combat, or Mirror Coat on a predicted Clangorous Soulblaze.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because Avalugg struggles with Steel-type Pokemon and Will-O-Wisp users, so Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona make great partners, with the former being able to take out Magearna, Mega Mawile, and Registeel and the latter taking on troublesome Psychic-types like Mega Gardevoir, Mew, and Mega Slowbro. Avalugg, in return, can take care of the bulky Dragon-types that counter most Fire-types, including Dragonite and Garchomp, as well as countering other specific threats such as Choice Specs Greninja and Heatran if using Superpower. Steel-types like Magnezone and Aegislash make interesting partners for Avalugg, with both being able to break through defensive Pokemon like Primarina, Chansey, and non-Amnesia Mega Venusaur with the combination of Metal Sound and their respective Z-Moves. Both also help take care of the many Psychic- and Fairy-types that roam the tier, such as Mega Gardevoir, Mega Metagross, Tapu Lele, and Clefable. In return, Avalugg can take care of Ground-types like Landorus-T and non-Counter Donphan that threaten them. Charm Mega Venusaur is also a great partner for Avalugg, being able to beat fast stall Pokemon like Whimsicott, Serperior, and Jumpluff while also taking care of Mega Charizard X and Mega Gyarados. Mega Venusaur also takes care of Defense-boosting Pokemon like Chansey and Mega Altaria with Leech Seed + Synthesis while handling Fire-types with Thick Fat.

  "Tapu Lele": {
    "overview": "<p>Tapu Lele is one of the most powerful threats in 1v1, being able to obliterate several prominent threats without even investing EVs in Special Attack, such as Dragonite, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Gyarados. Thanks to its Psychic Surge ability, Tapu Lele is able to forgo coverage moves and investment in Special Attack, letting it instead choose to invest in its defenses and use helpful utility options. Psychic Terrain also blocks priority moves coming from offensive powerhouses such as Extreme Speed from Dragonite and Fake Out from Mega Lopunny as well as Prankster-boosted status moves like Leech Seed from Pokemon such as Whimsicott. Tapu Lele gets access to several helpful utility tools such as Calm Mind, Reflect, and Taunt, allowing it to beat threats such as Tapu Fini, Jumpluff, Donphan, and Golem. Tapu Lele is unfortunately marred by its only average base 95 Speed, leaving it vulnerable to only slightly faster threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Groundium Z Garchomp, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Pinsir. Tapu Lele also cannot deal with many Steel-type Pokemon such as Magearna, Genesect, Mega Metagross, and Aegislash, as they resist both Psychic- and Fairy-type moves. Although Tapu Lele has moves available to beat certain forms of stall, it still struggles against Pokemon that resist Psychic-type attacks and can work around its Taunt, such Mega Slowbro and stall Mew.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf can be used to lure in and take out faster threats that traditionally have excellent matchups against Tapu Lele, such as Greninja, Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, and Genesect, using coverage moves such as Hidden Power Fire, Focus Blast, and Energy Ball alongside STAB Psychic and Moonblast. However, the lack of power and utility compared to a traditional Psychium Z set can be dissuading, and foes that can set up or recover off damage will give Tapu Lele problems. A Choice Specs set is also possible, giving Tapu Lele's coverage options the extra boost needed to reliably beat Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro and Heatran; however, the lack of utility options such as Calm Mind, Reflect, and Taunt really hurts when fighting against top-tier threats such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Charizard X.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-type Pokemon such as Mega Metagross, Kartana, Aegislash, and Durant resist both of Tapu Lele's STAB options and can usually fire back with super effective STAB moves of their own, giving it very few options when facing off against virtually every one of them.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Setup Pokemon: Even though Tapu Lele can use setup options such as Calm Mind and Taunt to hinder most forms of setup, it won't mean much if the Pokemon in question can still do more damage to Tapu Lele than it can do to them. Meloetta, Mega Slowbro, and Electrium Z Togekiss can all find ways to outdamage Tapu Lele while tanking Shattered Psyche and Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Fast Heavy Hitters: Tapu Lele's middling Speed hinders it, as it can do little when faced against threats that have the power to OHKO it on the first turn. Some of the hardest-hitting Pokemon in the metagame, such as Mega Gardevoir, Tectonic Rage Garchomp, Mega Pinsir, Choice Scarf Hoopa-U, and Choice Band Haxorus, all have the power to annihilate Tapu Lele before it can attack.</p> <p><strong>Fast Poison-type Pokemon: While Tapu Lele can OHKO any Poison-type it can lay a hit on, Poison-types that easily outspeed Tapu Lele can swiftly OHKO it first, such as Naganadel and Nihilego.</p> ",

Psyshock can be run in order to hit specially defensive Pokemon that are physically frail, such as Chansey, as well as outdamaging threats that can raise their Special Defense, such as opposing Tapu Lele and Clefable, in exchange for a slightly weaker Shattered Psyche. Moonblast is Tapu Lele's secondary STAB option, able to hit pesky Dark-types such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Sableye, and Krookodile, which are immune to Shattered Psyche, as well as Psychic-types that resist Tapu Lele's Shattered Psyche, such as offensive Mew and Choice Specs Necrozma. Reflect, when boosted with Psychium Z, allows Tapu Lele to easily take attacks from some of the heavier physical hitters in the game, such as Mega Gyarados, specially defensive Mega Charizard X, Donphan, Golem, and Zygarde as well as Flail Mega Lopunny. Taunt shuts down other setup or stall Pokemon, such as Jumpluff, Stored Power Necrozma, and Type: Null. Calm Mind is paramount in beating bulky special attackers such as Tapu Fini, Primarina, and slow Mega Charizard Y, allowing Tapu Lele to tank their powerful attacks and OHKO them back. Skill Swap can be run to turn the opposing Pokemon's abilities against them in a few matchups, such as against certain Sturdy users such as Magnezone, Mirror Coat Avalugg, and mixed Carracosta; Volt Absorb Pokemon such as Charge Zeraora; and Unaware Pokemon such as Clefable and Quagsire. Skill Swap also turns riskier matchups against Pokemon like Crustle into guaranteed wins as opposed to Taunt, which relies on proper prediction.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>96 HP and 188 Defense EVs allow Tapu Lele to tank Giga Impact from Mega Lopunny and Flare Blitz from Mega Charizard X as well as take special attacks more reliably, such as tanking bulky Tapunium Z Tapu Fini's Guardian of Alola followed by Brine after two Special Defense boosts from Calm Mind as well as Flyinium Z-boosted Hurricane from Dragonite. Normally, Pokemon have to prepare for both Fake Out followed by Giga Impact from Mega Lopunny; however, as Psychic Terrain blocks priority moves, this is unnecessary. 224 Speed EVs allow Tapu Lele to outspeed Landorus-T as well as Pokemon such as Normalium Z Porygon-Z and Adamant Mega Charizard X.</p> <p>Tapu Lele can run a specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 60 Def / 196 SpD and a Calm nature in order to take a Blast Burn from Mega Charizard Y as well as other special attacks from fast threats, such as a Hyper Beam from Choice Scarf Porygon-Z and a Hydro Cannon from Choice Specs Greninja. However, this set will be outsped by threats that Tapu Lele can normally easily deal with, such as Landorus-T, Normalium Z Porygon-Z, Vivillon, and Smeargle, as well as sacrifice consistency against physical threats such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Charizard X. Tapu Lele can also choose to invest any amount of EVs into its Special Attack, letting it beat several specially defensive checks such as Electrium Z Togekiss, Clefable, Charge Zeraora, and Pyukumuku.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tapu Lele is powerful, even without Special Attack investment, but it will still fight Pokemon who can avoid being OHKOed. Sturdy and Multiscale attackers, such as Donphan, Golem, and physical Dragonite, and bulky special attackers such as Tapu Fini, offensive Mew, and special Dragonite, will require setup with either Z-Reflect or Calm Mind. Mega Charizard X normally runs two different spreads: offensive and specially defensive. Against offensive Mega Charizard X, use Shattered Psyche immediately, whereas against specially defensive Mega Charizard X, the correct play is to use Z-Reflect turn one, followed by repeated Psychic.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Lele is naturally weak to Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon, and due to this, moderately fast Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Garchomp serve as excellent partners for Tapu Lele for their ability to hit these Pokemon super effectively and tank their attacks. In return, Tapu Lele can threaten bulky Water- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Primarina, Tapu Fini, Dragonite, and opposing Landorus-T, which all give Ground-type Pokemon trouble. Tapu Lele also appreciates Pokemon that can offensively threaten opposing Steel-types and shrug off the damage done by Poison-type Pokemon, meaning that Steel-, Fire-, and Fighting-type Pokemon can all work well as teammates. Magearna, Aegislash, Mega Metagross, both Mega Charizard formes, Mega Blaziken, and Kommo-o can all threaten several prominent Steel-types while crushing Poison-types like Naganadel and Nihilego. In return, Tapu Lele can beat Mega Charizard X, bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, Primarina, and Tapu Fini, and most Ground-type Pokemon such as Donphan, Golem, Landorus-T, and Zygarde. Tapu Lele also has issues with highly specially defensive Pokemon such as Meloetta, Chansey, Kee Berry Mew, Mega Slowbro, and Electrium Z Togekiss. Thus, Pokemon such as Aegislash, Magnezone, and Celesteela, which can all utilize Metal Sound to beat such Pokemon, all serve well as partners for Tapu Lele. In exchange, Tapu Lele can beat the Ground- and Fire-type Pokemon that threaten these Pokemon, namely Mega Charizard X, Landorus-T, and Donphan.</p> "

Tapu Bulu's Grass typing matches it up very well against Mega Gyarados, a very formidable and prevalent threat. It is also the slowest of all the Guardian Deities, which means that its Terrain activates the latest on the field and prevails for the first five turns of the battle.

Its typing causes it to be easily KOed by Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Flyinium Z Dragonite, and Mega Metagross. It also has a subpar Speed stat and just decent Special Defense.

Grassium Z turns Wood Hammer into a 190-Base Power Bloom Doom, which OHKOes nearly everything that does not resist Grass.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tapu Bulu can be sent in against Tapu Lele and Magearna; against Tapu Lele, you should either use Bloom Doom against slow variants, which are telegraphed by Psychic Terrain activating after Grassy Terrain, or use Rock Tomb against faster sets, which covers either Shattered Psyche or Z-Reflect. If Tapu Lele sets up Z-Reflect, use Leech Seed the following turn, stall with Substitute until Reflect has worn off, and then finish it off with Bloom Doom. Against Magearna, you should use Substitute immediately, followed by either Leech Seed or Substitute, depending on whether or not the Magearna attacks Tapu Bulu. After two Fleur Cannons, Magearna will no longer be able to break Tapu Bulu Substitute, allowing Tapu Bulu to stall out Magearna, which will not be able to use Pain Split nor damage Tapu Bulu fast enough. Don't send Tapu Bulu against Landorus-T if you think Landorus-T is holding Flyinium Z.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since Tapu Bulu is weak to Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-type moves, Ground-type Pokemon like Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Golem can serve as good teammates.

Since Tapu Bulu cannot hit Flying-type Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Celesteela very hard, Electric-type Pokemon like Zeraora and Magnezone are also good teammates for Tapu Bulu, and Tapu Bulu helps in return by covering their Ground- and Rock-type weakness, respectively. Since Tapu Bulu has a disadvantage against Ice-type Pokemon like Kyurem, Avalugg, and Weavile, Rock- and Fighting-type Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar and Terrakion can also serve as good teammates. Tapu Bulu also helps in covering any Rock-type teammate's weakness to Ground- and Water-type moves.

If Tapu Bulu is running Hidden Power Fire or Dazzling Gleam, it should run 52 Special Attack EVs in order to guarantee the OHKO on Durant with Hidden Power Fire, as well as have an 80% chance to OHKO Hydreigon with Dazzling Gleam. Tapu Bulu runs 244 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature in order to outspeed Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Greninja, and Adamant Zeraora. The remaining EVs are invested in its Attack stat to increase its offensive abilities as much as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Actively avoid sending Tapu Bulu in against Pokemon it cannot hit super effectively, since this set is a lure set for Pokemon like Greninja, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Lopunny, and it lacks the firepower or the moveset to KO averagely bulky Pokemon hit neutrally.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Ground-type Pokemon like Donphan and Golem can cover Tapu Bulu's Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-type weaknesses while appreciating Tapu Bulu's ability to defeat Water-types. Since Tapu Bulu can hit Flying-type Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Vivillon with this set, some Pokemon that lure in these like Mega Heracross and Volcarona can be paired with it. Magnezone can draw in Ground-type Pokemon for Tapu Bulu and make up for its mediocre Special Defense by defeating special attackers such as Choice Scarf Porygon-Z and Genesect with Mirror Coat.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Tapu Fini's Water / Fairy typing allows it to be one of the best Mega Charizard X answers, as well as letting it take on other common Fire- and Dragon-types like Air Balloon Heatran and bulky Zygarde. Its great bulk lets it take attacks from the likes of Landorus-T and Golem, while the ability Misty Terrain allows it to take on common sleep users like Vivillon and Jumpluff. Tapunium Z along with Taunt also helps it shut down common stall Pokemon like Chansey and Necrozma. Waterium Z allows Tapu Fini to take care of non-specially defensive Mega Mawile along with other offensive Pokemon like Landorus-T, as well as Mega Charizard Y through Z-Rain Dance. However, Tapu Fini struggles with Pokemon like Mega Metagross, Ferrothorn, Mega Venusaur, Magnezone, Togekiss, and Zeraora because of their bulk or their super effective attacks. Furthermore, the Waterium Z set also has trouble with dealing with special walls like Chansey, Meloetta, and Mega Slowbro, which can wear it down slowly with their attacks.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Specs set with Hydro Pump, Hidden Power Fire, Moonblast, and Ice Beam can be used to get more power out of Tapu Fini and beat Ferrothorn and Zygarde, which it cannot usually take on. However, this makes it unable to shut down walls like Chansey or to change the weather versus Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types give Tapu Fini trouble, as they resist its Water-type STAB moves. Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Whimsicott also commonly use Leech Seed to slowly drain Tapu Fini's HP. However, if Tapu Fini has Taunt, it is only shut down by Mega Venusaur, which can fire back with Giga Drain or Sludge Bomb. Other more offensive Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Mega Sceptile can OHKO Tapu Fini from full HP with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks: Powerful Electric Z-Move users like Zeraora and Magnezone can OHKO Tapu Fini from full HP thanks to their powerful STAB attacks. Other Pokemon that commonly run Electric-type moves like Mega Metagross can easily surprise Tapu Fini and OHKO it. Poison-types like Naganadel and Mega Gengar can take care of Tapu Fini thanks to their STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls:  Tapu Fini is unable to take care of walls such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn because of its inability to KO these Pokemon before it gets KOed itself. It also struggles with Mega Slowbro because of its pre-Mega ability in Oblivious preventing it from being shut down by Tapu Fini's Taunt, as well as with Ferrothorn because of its Grass STAB.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Pump transforms into Hydro Vortex to nuke Pokemon like non-specially defensive Mega Mawile and Mega Aggron. Tapu Fini's Rain Dance can be used to either boost Hydro Vortex's damage output or give Tapu Fini a Speed boost with Z-Rain Dance and cancel out Mega Charizard Y's Drought. Calm Mind allows Tapu Fini to take on slower special attackers like Primarina and bulky Necrozma by enabling it to take their attacks as well as boost its Hydro Vortex. Alternatively, Taunt stops Pokemon like Jumpluff, Aegislash, and Stored Power Necrozma from using Leech Seed or Calm Mind. Moonblast allows Tapu Fini to take care of bulky Dark-types like Mega Sableye and Dragon-types like Zygarde-C.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given HP and Defense EVs with a Bold nature allow Tapu Fini to take Choice Band Victini's Bolt Strike, as well as Z-Moves from Landorus-T, Donphan, and Terrakion. Additionally, 52 Special Defense EVs  let it survive Never-Ending Nightmare from Aegislash, as well as the following Shadow Sneak. 56 Speed EVs allow Tapu Fini to outpace maximum Speed Donphan as well as Mega Charizard Y after it gets a boost from Z-Rain Dance. The rest of the EVs go into Special Attack to make Tapu Fini's moves more powerful. Tapu Fini's ability Misty Surge allows it to avoid status for 5 turns, which is good against common sleep users like Jumpluff.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Regardless of which Mega an opposing Charizard is, use Z-Rain Dance to outspeed Mega Charizard Y and cancel out its Drought. If the opponent is running Mega Charizard Y and the Charizard does not Mega Evolve right away, use Rain Dance again the following turns to cover its eventual Mega Evolution and OHKO it with Hydro Pump. Otherwise, just attack with Hydro Pump. Against Sturdy Pokemon like Donphan and Mega Aggron, be sure to use Moonblast first and then use Hydro Vortex to avoid getting KOed by Endeavor followed by Ice Shard or Metal Burst, respectively. Similarly, be careful of sending Tapu Fini out against Magearna, as it has to engage in a mind game of using Taunt to prevent Magearna from using Calm Mind. Predict when Magearna attacks to use Calm Mind. After Tapu Fini gets one Calm Mind ahead of it and uses Taunt, use Hydro Pump then Hydro Vortex to finish it off. Against non-Earthquake Mega Gyarados, first use Taunt, then Calm Mind and Moonblast. For Carracosta, use Taunt so it cannot set up Shell Smash, and then use Moonblast twice to KO it. For Primarina, it will be better to spam Calm Mind and take care of it with Moonblast when Encore ends. Avoid sending Tapu Fini out against walls like Mega Venusaur, Mega Slowbro, and Chansey, because even with Taunt, Tapu Fini cannot win. Avoid sending it out against strong special attackers like Tapu Lele, Choice Specs Genesect, and Normalium Z Porygon-Z, as Tapu Fini does not take their attacks well. Be sure not to send Tapu Fini out to face Deoxys-S, as Deoxys-S has a faster Taunt and will proceed to PP stall Tapu Fini with Recover and Amnesia.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Aggron is a good Pokemon to pair with Tapu Fini because of its ability to take care of  Grass- and Electric-types like Tapu Bulu and Zeraora. In return, Tapu Fini can take care of sleep users like Jumpluff and setup sweepers like non-Earthquake Mega Gyarados. Dragon-types like Haxorus, Naganadel, and Garchomp are good partners, as they handle Tapu Fini's counters such as Tapu Bulu and Magnezone. Tapu Fini in return can take care of troubling Pokemon like non-Earthquake Mega Gyarados, non non-Flyinium Z Dragonite, and Mega Altaria. Ground-types like Zygarde and Landorus-T can help beat Zeraora and Magnezone as well as Steel-types like Magearna and Mega Metagross. In return, Tapu Fini can take care of Dragon- and Flying-types like Mega Latias and Mega Charizard. Fighting-types like Sawk, Mega Blaziken, and Mega Lucario helps with annoying walls like Chansey and offensive Porygon2, and if Sawk is running Poison Jab, it is able to take on Tapu Bulu as well. In return, Tapu Fini can take care of bulky Pokemon like non-Flyinium Z Dragonite, non-specially defensive Mega Mawile, and non-Earthquake Mega Gyarados. Fire-types like Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran are good to pair with Tapu Fini to take care of troubling Steel-and Grass-types like Genesect, specially defensive Mega Mawile, and Ferrothorn. Finally, Grass-types like Mega Sceptile and Mega Venusaur to take care of Electric-types like Zeraora and Magnezone.

Brine will double in strength once the opponent's HP is below half, turning it into a powerful Water-type STAB move after using Guardian of Alola, which is good for taking on Deoxys-S and Tapu Lele.

Allow it to face Sturdy Pokemon like Donphan and Golem, as after Guardian of Alola, Brine will finish them off. Use Icy Wind against Garchomp and Landorus-T, as this will let Tapu Fini outspeed and 2HKO them. Against fast Tapu Lele, use Guardian of Alola turn one, followed up by Icy Wind turn two and Brine turn three, as Tapu Fini will now outspeed it. Tapu Lele will be able to take a Brine after two Calm Minds, but not an Icy Wind followed by a Brine. Against slower, bulkier variants, use Guardian of Alola turn one, followed by Brine. Be careful if there is a Charizard in Team Preview, because even though Tapu Fini can beat Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y 2HKOes it. Do not send it out against Mega Slowbro, as they are unaffected by Taunt and will able to slowly wear down Tapu Fini. Strong special attackers like non-Choice Scarf Porygon-Z can also beat Tapu Fini, so avoid sending it out against them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Ground-types like Zygarde-C and Choice Scarf Landorus-T help Tapu Fini with troubling Electric- and Steel-types like Zeraora and Magnezone.

Tapu Fini struggles with Steel-types like Thunderbolt Choice Specs Genesect and non-Metal Burst Mega Mawile, so having Fire-types like Heatran and bulky Mega Charizard X helps Tapu Fini with pressuring these Pokemon at Team Preview as well as beating these. In return, Tapu Fini can take on Water-types like Primarina and walls like Chansey. Powerful Dragon-types like Choice Scarf Haxorus, Naganadel, and Choice Band Garchomp can help with Tapu Bulu, Whimsicott, and Mega Charizard Y. Garchomp can deal with either of Charizard's Mega Evolutions because of Outrage.

    "overview": "<p>Mega Venusaur has a solid defensive typing with adequate bulk and Thick Fat, which leaves it weak to just Flying and Psychic. This also means it is the only viable Grass-type that is not weak to either Fire- or Ice-type moves, giving it better matchups against Mega Charizard X and Choice Specs Greninja at the same time, one of which other Grass-types like Ferrothorn and Whimsicott may struggle with. It is one of the bulkiest and least passive Leech Seed users, with powerful STAB and coverage moves in Sludge Bomb, Giga Drain, and Hidden Power Fire to help it break foes like Greninja and Tapu Bulu, as well as Taunt users like Mega Mawile and other SubSeed users like Serperior and Jumpluff. It also has access to reliable recovery and stat-lowering moves via Synthesis, Rest, Sleep Powder, Charm, and Amnesia to beat offensive threats like Mega Charizard X. However, Mega Venusaur has no viable way of boosting its offenses, so it is susceptible to bulkier Pokemon like Type: Null. Mega Venusaur also is unable to do much to common Fire-, Steel-, and Dragon-types like Mega Charizard Y, Mega Metagross, and Dragonite, while also being weak to the plethora of Psychic-type Pokemon in the metagame like Tapu Lele, Mew, and Necrozma.</p> ",

Most of them have access to Psyshock as well, which Mega Venusaur has no way of defending against via Amnesia, although it is not often run.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon: Mega Venusaur's Flying-type weakness leaves it wide open for Mega Charizard Y, Togekiss, Celesteela, and Flyinium Z users like Landorus-T and Dragonite, which have the ability to OHKO or 2HKO Mega Venusaur while tanking anything that it can throw at them.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers: Stallbreakers are able to deal with Mega Venusaur with abilities or moves that shut down its strategies.

It also has a hefty chance to poison the foe, helping to deal some chip damage in between turns, though this shouldn't always be relied on except against bulky foes that you have multiple chances to poison. Giga Drain lets Mega Venusaur deal with Ground- and Rock-types like Donphan and Carracosta. Sleep Powder, albeit somewhat unreliable with its 75% accuracy, can turn the tide in Mega Venusaur's favor, which is crucial for matchups like Mega Charizard X and Crustle. Hidden Power Fire gives Mega Venusaur a way of hitting Steel-types such as Genesect and Mega Mawile that take little damage from its STAB moves.

Be wary that some variants of these Pokemon run Substitute, which bypasses Sleep Powder completely, or have significant bulk investment, meaning Mega Venusaur may require three sleep turns to KO them. Use Synthesis when Mega Venusaur can be KOed if a foe wakes up early, such as after Mega Charizard X uses Outrage or Flare Blitz.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Steel-type Pokemon like Registeel and Mega Metagross cover Mega Venusaur's only two weaknesses in Flying and Psychic, taking on threats like Dragonite and Meloetta.

It can also work well against setup Pokemon like non-Substitute Zygarde and Volcarona that cannot boost faster than it. Use Leech Seed as soon as possible to recover more HP while whittling the foe's health down. Against Archeops and Naganadel, use Synthesis first to see what move they use. If they use Head Smash or Draco Meteor, continue using Synthesis, as these moves' ability to 2HKO Mega Venusaur means it's best to just stall them out; otherwise, use the appropriate stat-boosting move. If running Rest, avoid Archeops and Naganadel. Instead, use Mega Venusaur against Pokemon like non-Rest Mega Slowbro and Pyukumuku. For some foes, mostly slower Taunt users unaffected by Sludge Bomb like Mega Mawile and Mega Aggron, it is better to use Leech Seed first.

    "overview": "<h1>Mega Charizard X</h1> <p>Mega Charizard X has an excellent offensive presence in 1v1, possessing a great Attack stat combined with Tough Claws and amazing STAB moves in Flare Blitz and Outrage. It also has various utility options at its disposal, such as Dragon Dance, Will-O-Wisp, Substitute, and Flame Charge, which give it the tools needed to beat several threats it couldn't otherwise, such as Mega Lopunny and Dragonite. Thanks to its natural power, it can afford to invest EVs into its above-average bulk, which gives it the potential to tank some of the most powerful attacks in the metagame, such as Mega Lopunny's Fake Out + Giga Impact and Choice Specs Greninja's Hydro Cannon. It can also wait on Mega Evolving to avoid super effective damage from Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Dragonite and Ground-type attacks such as the first hit of Thousand Arrows. Furthermore, as it appears as a regular Charizard in Team Preview, an opponent won't know if you are running Mega Charizard X or Mega Charizard Y, so you can have a free turn of setup on turn one if they predict wrong. Unfortunately, Charizard has a weakness to Rock-type moves both before and after Mega Evolving, so powerful Rock-type moves are able to quickly knock out even the bulkiest Mega Charizard X, such as Continental Crush from Golem, Crustle, and Donphan, as well as Diamond Storm from Mega Diancie. Mega Charizard X can also be walled by Pokemon that can tank both Outrage and Flare Blitz, such as Primarina, Charm Mega Venusaur, and Tapu Fini.</p> <h1>Mega Charizard Y</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y is an excellent offensive presence in the 1v1 metagame, able to obliterate all but the most specially defensive Pokemon with its sun-boosted Blast Burn, including foes such as Mew, Tapu Lele, and Mega Gardevoir. It also has access to excellent coverage and utility options in the form of Solar Beam and Air Slash, allowing it to beat many Pokemon that Fire-types traditionally struggle with, such as Guardian of Alola Tapu Fini, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Swampert, as well as Flame Charge to beat faster Substitute users, such as Jumpluff and Flail Mega Lopunny. Mega Charizard Y's Drought ability also serves to weaken the Water-type moves dealt out by several prominent Water-types in the metagame, notably enabling it to tank Choice Specs Greninja's Hydro Cannon after moderate investment. Unfortunately, Mega Charizard Y suffers from a 4x weakness to Rock-type moves, with Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, and Crustle easily crushing it. Furthermore, Mega Charizard Y, unlike its X counterpart, has no viable way of boosting its main offensive stat, meaning that Mega Charizard Y has no effective way to break sufficiently bulky Special Defense boosters like Meloetta and stall Deoxys-S, as well as being susceptible to generally specially defensive walls like Chansey.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Mega Charizard X</h1> <p>Earthquake, often paired with Rock Tomb, has a niche role of beating Heatran, which is normally one of the safest Mega Charizard X counters in the metagame. However, besides Heatran, the coverage and power offered by Rock Tomb and Earthquake is completely overshadowed by the combination of Flare Blitz and Outrage, so only use Earthquake if you need to patch up a specific hole in your team. Counter with 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def and an Impish nature can be a decent option against some Choice item users that normally give Mega Charizard X trouble, such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Choice item Garchomp, Haxorus, and Durant.</p> <h1>Mega Charizard Y</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y can also run Counter alongside maximum HP and Defense in order to lure and take out traditional Charizard answers, such as Haxorus and Choice item Dragonite. Be aware that Counter will not reliably beat non-Choice item users, however, as they will be able to play mind games and set up.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Mega Charizard X</h1> <p><strong>Rock-type Moves: The most foolproof way to beat a Mega Charizard X is with powerful Rock-type moves, made all the better with Z-Moves. These include Donphan's and Crustle's Continental Crush, Aggron's Head Smash, and Mega Diancie's Diamond Storm.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Water-types naturally have an edge when fighting Mega Charizard X, as they usually resist Flare Blitz and beat Mega Charizard X before it can set up and KO them. Even with specially defensive Mega Charizard X, some Water-types are still too bulky to break through or offensive enough to KO it. Pokemon such as Primarina, Tapu Fini, Manaphy, and Mega Swampert all excel against Mega Charizard X.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon: Pokemon that avoid being 2HKOed by Mega Charizard X and either incapacitate it or neutralize its offensive presence do very well in defeating it, especially if Mega Charizard X cannot hit the Pokemon super effectively. These include Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Z-Reflect Tapu Lele, Mega Altaria, and Heatran.</p> <p><strong>Stall: Mega Charizard X can naturally be handled effectively by stall Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro, defensive Charm Mega Venusaur, Chansey, Blissey, stall Necrozma, and PP stall Deoxys-S. These Pokemon effectively neutralize Mega Charizard X's Attack with moves like Iron Defense and Charm. They need to worry about the rare Belly Drum Mega Charizard X, which can simply overpower their defenses if it sets up, and Substitute Mega Charizard X, which can hinder Pokemon that rely on Charm or Toxic.</p> <h1>Mega Charizard Y</h1> <p><strong>Rock-type Moves: Mega Charizard Y is severely crippled by any kind of Rock-type move. Even a Rock Tomb from any Pokemon invested in Attack, such as Sawk, will threaten to OHKO it. Beware of Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar, Hidden Power Rock Naganadel, Crustle, Donphan, and Aggron, which can all take a hit from Mega Charizard Y and OHKO back with a Rock-type move, regardless of STAB or if they are burned.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: As Mega Charizard Y cannot boost its Special Attack, it is hugely vulnerable to Pokemon that can either tank a Blast Burn and threaten it back or neutralize its power with moves like Amnesia and Confide while healing off the damage dealt. Pokemon like Meloetta, specially defensive Tapu Lele, Chansey, and Porygon2 can all outlast Mega Charizard Y.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fire- and Dragon-type Pokemon: Fire- and Dragon-type Pokemon unfortunately resist Mega Charizard Y's STAB Blast Burn, as well as its main coverage move Solar Beam, and will usually shrug off Air Slash. Pokemon like Naganadel, which cannot take Flame Charge followed by Blast Burn, and non-Dragon Dance Mega Altaria, which cannot do enough damage and will waste its recovery against Air Slash, are the exception, not the rule, and Mega Charizard Y will be constantly threatened by Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Incineroar, Heatran, Victini, Dragonite, Garchomp, Kommo-o, and Zygarde.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Flame Charge serves the dual purpose of not only boosting Mega Charizard X's Speed in order to outspeed Pokemon like Naganadel, Mega Lopunny, and Greninja, as well as breaking Substitute from Flail Mega Lopunny and Mega Pinsir, Reversal Mega Lucario, and from stall Pokemon like Jumpluff. Dragon Dance can also be used to boost one Speed while also gaining Attack, which can be useful for playing mindgames against the powerful Dragonite and Mega Gyarados. Outrage lets Mega Charizard X hit Pokemon that resist Fire-type attacks, such as bulky Dragonite, Mega Charizard Y, and Kommo-o. Flare Blitz works well with Outrage in providing excellent coverage against the metagame, hitting Pokemon such as Magearna, Mega Metagross, and Ferrothorn. However, Flare Blitz's recoil damage can be particularly damaging against heavy-hitting Pokemon such as a burned Mega Aggron and Substitute Volcarona. Will-O-Wisp makes up for Mega Charizard X's relative lack of bulk and offensive presence by not only halving the opposing Pokemon's Attack but also chipping away at its health at the same time, helping against bulky Multiscale Dragonite. Belly Drum can also be run, maximizing its Attack in order to lure and beat back Mega Slowbro and Type: Null.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given HP and Special Defense EVs let Mega Charizard X tank hits from Modest Choice Specs Greninja. These EVs also let Mega Charizard X lure in and beat special attackers such as special Dragonite, Choice Specs Naganadel, and bulky Meloetta. The HP EVs also give Mega Charizard X sufficient physical bulk to beat bulky physical Dragonite, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Lucario. 96 Speed EVs let Mega Charizard X outspeed a Dragonite lacking a speedy nature, letting it use Will-O-Wisp before an attack. The rest of the EVs should go into Attack, as Mega Charizard X doesn't need much Attack investment to secure KOs.</p> <p>You can also choose to use a speedier spread of 248 HP / 60 Atk / 144 SpD / 56 Spe EV spread with a Jolly nature, which sacrifices reliability against Modest Greninja and Modest Naganadel but lets Mega Charizard X beat Jolly Mega Lopunny, as well as Smeargle. As Mega Lopunny and Greninja are often paired together, you may want to consider this as a catch-all option. A faster build can also be utilized, running 24 HP / 76 Atk / 156 Def / 252 Spe EVs and a Jolly nature, which can be used to beat all Haxorus variants, if you know what item it is running, while maintaining a positive Mega Lopunny matchup, and speed tying other base 100 Speed Pokemon like Mega Medicham and opposing offensive Mega Charizard X. Lastly, if you intend to run Belly Drum, you can run a 128 HP / 24 Atk / 124 Def / 232 Spe EV spread with an Impish nature, letting Mega Charizard X beat Zygarde, while maintaining enough speed for Haxorus and Mega Lopunny.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set beats special attackers such as Greninja, Meloetta, Kommo-o, and Mega Blastoise. Against faster special attackers like Greninja and Naganadel, always use Dragon Dance or Flame Charge on turn one, and attack on turn two. This is the safest way to go about this matchup, as it accounts for Protean type changes and the occasional Choice Scarf Naganadel, which outspeeds Charizard at +1, but discernable based on Draco Meteor damage. Make sure to not Mega Evolve against Naganadel in order to avoid super effective damage. For slower bulky special attackers such as bulky Meloetta, Mega Blastoise, and Volcanion, attack immediately, as Mega Charizard X is faster anyway and tanks any hit they throw out. Against a Pokemon like bulky non-Dragon Dance Dragonite, Mega Charizard X should use Will-O-Wisp without Mega Evolving, then Mega Evolve and attack with Outrage once burn damage has negated Dragonite's Multiscale. If Dragonite is running Dragon Dance, you'll have to play mind games about whether or not they will Dragon Dance or attack. If you are running the Belly Drum EVs, use Belly Drum against Zygarde in your base form, then Mega Evolve turn two to avoid being KOed by Extreme Speed. If you aren't running the anti-Zygarde EVs, you can still win against Zygarde if you have Will-O-Wisp and Dragon Dance, and if the opposing Zygarde user missplays, using Coil to match your Dragon Dances. This will get it in range of an Outrage, and avoid activating Power Construct.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Powerful, bulky Psychic-type Pokemon such as Z-Reflect Tapu Lele, Mew, and Will-O-Wisp Mega Gardevoir all have tools at their disposal that allow them to tank attacks from and overpower hyper offense and stall Pokemon such as Breakneck Blitz Porygon-Z, Mega Venusaur, Tapu Fini, Golem, Donphan, and Mega Altaria, which all can be a problem for Mega Charizard X. As Mega Charizard X is a Fire-type Pokemon, it can work in a standard Fire / Water / Grass core. Pokemon such as Primarina and Greninja can provide answers to Pokemon such as Donphan, Golem, Landorus-T, opposing Mega Charizard X, and Heatran, and Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Kartana cover up Mega Charizard X's vulnerability to Tapu Fini and Primarina. A Dragon / Steel / Fairy team core can also work with Mega Charizard X; Pokemon such as Tapu Lele and Tapu Fini beat threats like Donphan, Golem, and opposing Mega Charizard X, and Pokemon like Magearna and Aegislash can take on Tapu Lele, Tapu Fini, Primarina, Mega Altaria, and Togekiss.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Bulky Offense",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Blast Burn is Mega Charizard Y's most powerful move, as well as one of the most powerful moves in the metagame, able to neutralize almost any Pokemon it can hit super effectively, such as Magearna, Mega Metagross, Aegislash, and Celesteela, as well as frailer Pokemon that resist Fire-type damage, such as Naganadel. Beware of its recharge after usage, Blast Burn's biggest downside. Solar Beam is Mega Charizard Y's best coverage option, allowing it to hit several Water-type Pokemon, such as Guardian of Alola Tapu Fini, Calm Mind Mega Slowbro, and Mega Swampert. Flame Charge is a utility option that gives Mega Charizard Y a way to beat the common sleep inducer Jumpluff, alongside giving an extra bit of chip damage against faster threats such as Greninja, Mew, Mega Gardevoir, Substitute Mega Metagross, and Naganadel. Air Slash is Mega Charizard Y's secondary STAB option, used primarily to get a Pokemon in range of Blast Burn or break a Substitute from an opposing Pokemon that resists Solar Beam, such as Mega Venusaur and specially offensive Mega Altaria. It also has a noticeable 30% chance to make an opposing Pokemon flinch, which can be useful as a last-ditch effort against Pokemon such as Mega Aggron, Magnezone, specially defensive Tapu Lele, and Kommo-o. However, this is by no means a reliable strategy and should only be used if there is no other option in order to win. Will-O-Wisp can also be used to cut the Attack of bulky Mega Gyarados, removing its immediate offensive presence, alongside beating certain Sturdy Pokemon like non-Rockium Z or Choice Band Avalugg and FEAR Aron. You can also choose to run Hidden Power Electric, which, along with Solar Beam, always 2HKOes offensive Mega Gyarados and forces a mind game with bulky Mega Gyarados; this only has use against Mega Gyarados, however. Substitute can be used to lure in Head Smash Donphan and Aggron, two Sturdy users that can OHKO Mega Charizard Y if they can land their attack, OHKOing with Blast Burn after recoil damage. Rock Tomb can be run in order to beat opposing non-Rock Tomb Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>116 HP and 8 Special Defense EVs allow Mega Charizard Y to tank attacks like Choice Specs Hydro Cannon from Greninja, Choice Specs Draco Meteor from Naganadel, and Fake Out + Genesis Supernova from Mew, as well as take a burned Avalugg's Stone Edge. Mega Charizard Y also runs 216 Speed EVs with a Timid nature in order to outspeed base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Tapu Lele as well as slower Pokemon such as non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T, non-Choice Scarf Z Porygon-Z, and Vivillon. The rest goes into Special Attack, in order to improve Mega Charizard Y's matchups against bulkier Pokemon such as Mega Sableye and Mega Slowbro.</p> <p>If you're running Will-O-Wisp, Mega Charizard Y can potentially run a bulky offense spread of 124 HP / 68 Def / 108 SpA / 208 Spe and a Modest nature in order to outspeed and beat every variant of Mega Gyarados, not just bulky Mega Gyarados. If Hidden Power Electric is being used, 8 HP / 148 Def / 144 SpA / 208 Spe and a Modest nature can be run, which simply outspeeds Mega Gyarados and tanks any of its attacks boosted by a Dragon Dance. Mega Charizard Y can also run 208 HP / 116 SpD / 184 Spe and a Timid nature in order to survive a Modest Hyper Beam from Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, allowing it to beat all sets, as well as outspeeding non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Blast Burn does nominally more damage than its coverage options against Pokemon that it hits neutrally with Blast Burn, such as Krookodile. However, if the coverage moves can still knock the Pokemon out, they should be used, in order to avoid missing your move and losing the game. Choice Specs Greninja can try to change its type with Protean to avoid fatal damage from Solar Beam, and thus using Flame Charge turn one, followed up by either Solar Beam or Blast Burn, will allow Mega Charizard Y to react to every play an opposing Greninja can make and avoid any mind games. For specially offensive Mega Altaria, spam Air Slash. Air Slash's absurd 30% flinch chance, combined with Mega Charizard Y's excellent Special Attack, and Mega Charizard Y's resistance to Mega Altaria's Fairy-type will ensure that Mega Charizard Y will waste the recovery option and get them into range of Blast Burn through flinches. If you are running the anti-Mega Gyarados Will-O-Wisp spread, use Will-O-Wisp turn one, followed by a Solar Beam turn two, and Blast Burn turn three in order to have the best chances to beat bulky Mega Gyarados. If you're running Hidden Power Electric, be aware that Hidden Power Electric into a Solar Beam against a bulky Mega Gyarados can sometimes fail to KO, if they Mega Evolve turn one. Therefore, predicting if they will choose to Mega Evolve or stay in base form can aid you, although the odds of winning against bulky Mega Gyarados if you predict incorrectly turn one is still very much in your favor.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y is naturally weak to several Rock-, Electric-, and Dragon-type Pokemon, such as Mega Tyranitar, Magnezone, and Zygarde, alongside Mega Gyarados; this makes it fit extraordinarily well with a standard Fire / Water / Grass core, which can fill in its deficits using Pokemon such as Tapu Fini, Mega Gyarados, Mega Venusaur, and Jumpluff. In return, these Pokemon appreciate Mega Charizard Y's positive matchup against all other Grass-type Pokemon as well as common Steel-type Pokemon such as Magearna and Genesect. Mega Charizard Y also works well with Ground- and Dragon-type Pokemon that can beat back the aforementioned Rock- and Electric-type Pokemon, as well as opposing Fire-type Pokemon like Heatran, Victini, and Incineroar. Pokemon such as Zygarde, bulky Donphan, Kommo-o, and Dragonite can beat all of these threats. In return, Mega Charizard Y threatens Ice-type Pokemon or Pokemon wielding Ice-type moves, such as Greninja, Genesect, Kyurem, Avalugg, and Alolan Ninetales, and bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and Mega Blastoise. Mega Charizard Y also has issues against specially defensive stall Pokemon, such as Amnesia Mega Slowbro, Stored Power Necrozma, Porygon2, and Chansey. Because of this, stallbreakers such as Taunt + Crunch Mega Gyarados, Mega Heracross, and Vivillon all make excellent partners to Mega Charizard Y, which can, in return, beat threatening Pokemon to them such as Mega Metagross and Mega Gardevoir.</p> "

  "Blastoise": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Blastoise's ability to counter some of 1v1's most prominent threats such as Dragonite, Mega Charizard Y, and non-Thunder Punch Mega Metagross makes it a great anti-metagame Pokemon. Mega Launcher is a fantastic ability, since it boosts Mega Blastoise's Aura Sphere and Dragon Pulse by 50%, allowing Mega Blastoise to break through a myriad of threats such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Charizard X. However, Mega Blastoise's mediocre stats force it to focus solely on a particular stat to gain KOs, and this is an issue, as it needs lots of bulk to survive hits but also needs to run a lot of Special Attack and Speed investment along with a Speed-lowering move to defeat foes. Additionally, Mega Blastoise is weak to several Electric- and Grass-types and Pokemon with coverage of either type such as Zeraora, Serperior, Thunder Punch Mega Metagross, and Grass Knot Greninja. Finally, it faces a lot of competition from other, much more viable Water-types such as Mega Gyarados, Greninja, and Tapu Fini.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Counter is a good option, allowing Mega Blastoise to overcome many of the strong physical attackers in the metagame such as non-Substitute Mega Metagross and specially defensive Mega Mawile. Mirror Coat is an alternative to Counter, allowing Mega Blastoise to deal with special attackers like Kommo-o and Psychium Z Mew instead. However, be aware that by using Counter or Mirror Coat, Mega Blastoise must sacrifice Fake Out, which is its primary way of dealing with Sturdy Pokemon and Dragonite. Aqua Jet is a safe option if you want to guarantee Mega Blastoise's ability to take care of Sturdy Pokemon that have to use Protect to beat it such as Crustle and Carracosta.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks: Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Zeraora, Serperior, and Tapu Bulu are major threats to Mega Blastoise due their ability to OHKO it with their super effective STAB moves. Furthermore, there are a myriad of Pokemon 1v1 that carry Electric- and Grass-type coverage such as Thunder Punch Metagross and Grass Knot Greninja.</p> <p><strong>Stall: Mega Blastoise is susceptible to stall Pokemon such as Type: Null, Suicune, and Kee Berry Mew, which all take very little damage from it after either lowering its stats or boosting their own to beat it one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Mega Swampert take all of Mega Blastoise's attacks rather easily and can beat it with their respective secondary STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon: Pokemon like Mega Gyarados, Magearna, and Meloetta all have a good Special Defense stat, which makes them capable of taking anything Mega Blastoise has to offer. They can set up on it or are offensive enough to beat it one-on-one. Furthermore, Pokemon like Chansey and Blissey can comfortably soak up any of Mega Blastoise's attacks, heal themselves with Soft-Boiled, and slowly whittle it down with Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Powerful wallbreakers such as Normalium Z Porygon-Z, Choice Specs Hoopa-U, and Tapu Lele have enough power to overwhelm Mega Blastoise's bulk and OHKO it with their attacks.</p> ",

        "name": "Bulky Special Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out allows Mega Blastoise to deal a small amount of chip damage and break Multiscale and Sturdy of Pokemon such as Dragonite, Donphan, and Golem and KO them with the appropriate move depending on the scenario. Hydro Cannon is Mega Blastoise's hardest-hitting STAB move, which is powerful enough to grab KOs against Pokemon that it is super effective against and Pokemon with low Special Defense such as Archeops and Mega Aggron. Rock Tomb is a great way to beat some of 1v1's strongest wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y, non-specially defensive Mega Charizard X, and Choice Band Hoopa-U with some residual damage from Fake Out by lowering their Speed and getting them in KO range of Mega Blastoise's other powerful moves. Ice Beam OHKOes some of the most important threats in the metagame such as Dragonite after Fake Out, Zygarde, and Garchomp. Dragon Pulse is an alternative to beat specially defensive Mega Charizard X. Aura Sphere is a decent Mega Launcher-boosted option that lets Mega Blastoise beat common Dark- and Steel-types such as non-Power Whip Ferrothorn, Mega Tyranitar, and almost always non-Timid Magnezone. Dark Pulse can also be run, allowing Mega Blastoise to deal with the many Ghost- and Psychic-types in the tier such as Mega Gengar, Jirachi, and Choice Specs Deoxys-S. Be mindful that Mega Blastoise should always use Dragon Pulse together with Rock Tomb. Hidden Power Electric in conjunction with Aura Sphere guarantees that Mega Blastoise always beats Mega Gyarados one-on-one.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>216 HP EVs and 44 Special Defense EVs guarantee that Mega Blastoise always survives one Thunderbolt from Genesect as well as Solar Beam from Mega Charizard Y. The HP investment also allows it to take any move that Landorus-T and Dragonite have to offer. 112 Speed EVs allow Mega Blastoise to outspeed non-Timid Magnezone as well as base 100 Speed Pokemon after a Speed drop from Rock Tomb, such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y. The remaining EVs are dumped into its Special Attack, improving its matchup against other physical Pokemon such as Garchomp.</p> <p>Alternatively, Mega Blastoise can run an EV spread of 224 HP / 68 Def / 96 SpA / 8 SpD / 112 Spe with a Modest nature to gain as much reliability against Choice Band Victini and Mega Heracross as possible while sacrificing the matchup against Genesect.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Don't use Fake Out turn one against Mega Lucario, which can have Inner Focus as its pre-Mega ability. Mega Blastoise is vulnerable to stall Pokemon such as Type: Null, Suicune, and Kee Berry Mew, which can all beat it one-on-one due to taking very little damage from it after lowering its stats or boosting their own stats. When facing Mega Charizard X, first use Fake Out to scout for whether or not it is running bulk. If it is running bulk, use Rock Tomb to slow it down and follow it up with Dragon Pulse. On the other hand, if it isn't bulky, use Hydro Cannon to win.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Agile allies such as Pheromosa, Naganadel, and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z are key due to their ability to defeat Pokemon like Zeraora, Jumpluff, and Tapu Lele that Mega Blastoise struggles to deal with because of its mediocre Speed tier. In return, Mega Blastoise can defeat bulkier Pokemon such as Dragonite for Jumpluff and Landorus-T for Zeraora and Tapu Lele. Mega Blastoise appreciates having Ground-type partners such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Donphan, which all threaten the common Electric-types in the tier such as Zeraora and Magnezone. In return, Mega Blastoise can deal with opposing Ground-types and Dragonite. Flying-types like Dragonite, Flyinium Z Landorus-T, and Togekiss are great teammates, as they can take down Grass-types such as Serperior, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Venusaur, while Mega Blastoise can defeat opposing Rock-types such as Golem and Carracosta that give them difficulty. Electric-types such as Zeraora and Magnezone are great allies, as they can beat many bulky Water-types that Mega Blastoise struggles against such as Primarina and Tapu Fini. In return, Mega Blastoise can deal with common Ground- and Rock-types such as Golem, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. As Mega Blastoise itself is a Water-type Pokemon, it can be utilized on a standard Fire / Water / Grass core, which has great synergy as a whole. Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Victini, and Volcarona deal with the plethora of Steel- and Grass-types in the tier such as Magearna, Serperior, and Tapu Bulu, while Mega Blastoise can deal with the Ground- and Rock-types they struggle with. Grass-types like Serperior and Mega Venusaur are helpful, as they cover Mega Blastoise's weakness to Electric-types such as Zeraora and Zapdos; in return, Mega Blastoise can help deal with some of the Dragon-, Flying-, and Fire-types in the tier such as Zygarde-C, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran. Physical wallbreakers such as Mega Heracross, Choice Band Hoopa-U, Incineroar, and Mega Medicham are useful, as they can defeat many of the stall Pokemon in the tier such as Mega Slowbro, Type: Null, and Kee Berry Mew. Mega Blastoise, on the other hand, can deal with some agile Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, non-Grass Knot Greninja, and Naganadel thanks to its bulk.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Clefable acts as an anti-metagame wall that can beat even the most formidable of setup Pokemon in 1v1.

Its powerful ability Unaware allows it to tackle Pokemon that might try to set up and break through its defenses like Mega Charizard X and Landorus-T. However, despite its good defenses Clefable can still fall prey to powerful super effective attacks from the likes of Mega Metagross, Naganadel, and Genesect. Furthermore, while Unaware ignores the stat boosts of enemies, Clefable's own defenses can still be lowered, allowing Pokemon like Magnezone, Aegislash, and Nihilego to beat it. Finally, some attacks like Choice Band Victini's V-create and Porygon-Z's Breakneck Blitz can be too much for Clefable to handle, even with defensive boosts.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Clefable has no other options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Very Strong Attackers</strong>: Clefable needs a turn to set up, and in this time very strong or super effective attacks can KO or damage it to a point where even after it sets up it will be KOed before it has a chance to recover. Very powerful attackers like Choice Band Victini and Porygon-Z can outmuscle Clefable.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Bypassers: Pokemon that can somehow bypass Clefable's Unaware or defensive boosts are solid checks. Laser Focus users like Meloetta and Raikou do well, as critical hits render Clefable's boosts useless. Metal Sound users like Aegislash and Magnezone can negate Clefable's stat boosts to land devastating hits. Pokemon like Mega Sableye and Kyurem can reduce Clefable's Special Attack and stall out its meager PP.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attackers: Clefable can only boost up to a certain point with its status moves. Thus, super effective STAB attacks from Pokemon like Naganadel, Nihilego, Mega Metagross, Kartana, and Choice Specs Genesect can prove overwhelming for Clefable's defenses.</p> <p><strong>Other Stall: Clefable is weak to other stall Pokemon that can outstall it, as most of its moves (especially its recovery options) have relatively few PP. Foes like Type: Null, Mega Slowbro, Registeel, Necrozma, and to a certain extent Magearna can all PP stall Clefable at very little risk. Pokemon that use SubSeed like Serperior and Venusaur can also stall out Clefable given Moonlight's low PP.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt users like Mega Gardevoir, Tapu Fini, and Kee Berry Mew can beat Clefable by restricting its recovery but must be careful they don't fall prey to Magic Coat.</p> ",

Reflect in conjunction with Psychium Z allows Clefable to cut incoming damage by two-thirds, beating strong physical attackers such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Gyarados, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. Moonlight gives access to reliable recovery and can make the Mega Charizard Y matchup more reliable by allowing Clefable to recover 66% instead of 50% in sun.

Its access to priority in Sucker Punch also gives it the potential to beat bulky Pokemon like Meloetta and Genesect that would be able to take just a Z-Move. In addition to all this, it has access to moves like Rock Blast and Counter, which can help it defeat Pokemon like Jumpluff and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, respectively, which would otherwise beat it. Unfortunately, Golem's pitiful Speed tier leaves it outsped by the majority of the metagame and vulnerable to faster bulky Pokemon like Serperior, Tapu Lele, and Mew. Another factor that severely affects its viability is the ubiquity of Mold Breaker, Fake Out, and Skill Link Pokemon like Mega Gyarados, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Heracross, which can bypass Sturdy. These downsides make Golem face competition for its niche from Donphan, another Sturdy user that also has access to Ground-type STAB and priority.</p> ",

Earthquake gets powered up by Groundium Z into Tectonic Rage, which can OHKO Pokemon like non-Magnet Rise Mega Metagross. Sucker Punch gives Golem the potential to pick off weakened Pokemon after Tectonic Rage like Choice Band Garchomp. Protect can be used to negate the chip damage from Fake Out from Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham to preserve Sturdy. Rock Tomb can be run for a more consistent Mega Charizard X and Volcarona matchup. Smack Down can be used against Zapdos and Celesteela to make them take super effective damage from Tectonic Rage on subsequent turns. Bulldoze can also be run to let Golem counter Magearna.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 EVs in Attack coupled with an Adamant nature maximize Golem's damage output. 252 Speed EVs let it outspeed Pokemon like bulky Mega Tyranitar. Groundium Z is used to beat non-Magnet Rise Mega Metagross and Aegislash. Sturdy lets Golem survive attacks like Never-Ending Nightmare from Aegislash and Hydro Cannon from Greninja that it otherwise would not.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against Mega Lopunny, use Protect on Fake Out cautiously, since they can potentially set a Substitute up while you use Protect, or Encore your Protect. Avoid bringing Golem against faster Pokemon that can stall it out, like Serperior, Whimsicott, Kee Berry Mew, and Deoxys-S. Avoid bringing it against Iron Defense and Charm users like Mega Slowbro and Chansey, as they can easily tank any hits Golem throws at them and render Golem unable to KO them afterwards. You will be able to beat Greninja, despite being a Water-type, thanks to Golem's Sturdy. If you're running Bulldoze for Magearna, use Bulldoze on the first turn followed by Earthquake on the second turn and Tectonic Rage on the third to successfully defeat it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Grass-type Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Mega Venusaur make good teammates for Golem, since they can take on Water- and Ground-type Pokemon that give Golem trouble. Specially defensive Tapu Bulu equipped with Taunt in particular stands out as a teammate, since it beats bulkier threats that Golem cannot like Mega Gyarados, Donphan, Mega Gardevoir, Primarina, Registeel, Zygarde-C, Mega Slowbro, and Mew, with Golem beating Fire- and Steel-type Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Aegislash, non-Magnet Rise Mega Metagross, and Mega Mawile for Tapu Bulu. Mega Venusaur can also beat opposing Golem, Donphan, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Altaria, while Golem beats Belly Drum Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona for Mega Venusaur. Special wallbreakers like Porygon-Z and Nihilego synergize well with Golem, as they can take on the Will-O-Wisp, Iron Defense, and Charm users like Mew and Mega Venusaur that threaten it. Since Golem is slow, fast Pokemon like Pheromosa and Deoxys-S are useful partners to beat Pokemon like Whimsicott, Smeargle,and Vivillon, which rely on facing slower opponents to win. In return, Golem can beat bulky threats like Aegislash and Jirachi.</p> "

Fairium Z Magearna is an excellent partner for Golem because it can deal with the biggest threats to Golem, namely Mega Gyarados, Dragonite, and Donphan, while Golem can consistently take care of Fire-type Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran for Magearna.</p> "

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Slowbro is one of the most consistent setup stall Pokemon in the 1v1 metagame. With naturally monstrous Defense, it can tank neutral attacks from the strongest physical attackers in the tier, such as Mega Charizard X, Flyinium Z-boosted Fly Dragonite, and Mega Lopunny, even without Defense investment. Thanks to this, Mega Slowbro can put as many EVs into Special Defense and HP as possible, which enables it to tank moves from powerful special attackers as well, such as specially offensive Dragonite and Choice Scarf Porygon Z, and follow up with recovery in the form of Slack Off or Rest, or use various setup moves such as Iron Defense, Calm Mind, and Amnesia in order to get out of KO range. Slowbro also has access to two very useful abilities for its role, those being Oblivious and Shell Armor, allowing it to be immune to the move Taunt, which normally shuts down all forms of stall, before Mega Evolving and avoid being hit by a critical hit after, making it more reliable against every Pokemon that can boost its offenses. Mega Slowbro is, unfortunately, one of the slowest Pokemon in the metagame, so it is only able to set up after it has already taken damage, leaving it susceptible to being knocked out by sufficiently powerful super effective attacks. Mega Slowbro is also weak to several common attacking moves, those being Grass-, Electric-, and Dark-type moves, so you'll need to watch out for moves such as Giga Drain, Thunderbolt, Dark Pulse, and their respective Z-Moves from Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Magnezone, and Hoopa-U.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Foul Play is an interesting niche choice that beats a notable anti-Mega Slowbro set in Belly Drum Mega Charizard X. Considering the popularity of Mega Charizard X, this may be an interesting choice to have more of a guaranteed matchup against every variant of Mega Charizard X. However, in every other regard, Foul Play is severely inferior to Scald.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective Attackers: As Mega Slowbro is such an excellent stall Pokemon in the context of 1v1, with answers to Taunt, status conditions, most forms of stall, and critical hits, the most common threat against Mega Slowbro will be super effective attackers, and it will struggle against those that can exploit its Water / Psychic typing. These include prevalent Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Magnezone, Z-Conversion Porygon-Z, Choice Specs Greninja, Aegislash, Choice Specs Genesect, Tapu Bulu, Gigavolt Havoc Zeraora, Bloom Doom Heatran, Kartana, and Hoopa-U. The only real relevant exception to this in 1v1 is the aforementioned Mega Gyarados, which, unfortunately, only has Crunch, which Mega Slowbro can tank using Iron Defense.</p> <p><strong>Very Powerful Attackers: There are a select few Pokemon in the metagame that are simply so powerful that they can overwhelm Mega Slowbro with neutral damage. These include Choice Specs or Normalium Z Porygon-Z, which can OHKO even a fully invested Mega Slowbro using Hyper Beam or Breakneck Blitz, or Belly Drum Mega Charizard X, which can very impressively 2HKO a +2 Defense Mega Slowbro with Outrage after a Belly Drum, unless Mega Slowbro runs Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Encore Users</strong>: The cousin of Taunt, Encore, is, unfortunately, not blocked by Oblivious and will pose a serious problem to Mega Slowbro, as it will not be able to use anything except the move it has been locked into for the remainder of the battle. Some popular Encore users include Primarina, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Alakazam, and Whimsicott.</p> <p><strong>Other Rest Stallers: While Mega Slowbro can usually outlast other forms of stall by using the move Rest, retaining more PP while it is asleep, if its opponent also has Rest, Mega Slowbro may be in trouble. If the opposing Pokemon can Rest off the damage Mega Slowbro deals and has more PP, you have essentially lost. Beware of Pokemon such as Meowstic-M, Type: Null, Pyukumuku, and Suicune.</p> ",

        "name": "Semistall Setup",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald serves as Mega Slowbro's trusty attacking option, allowing it to slowly whittle down the opposing Pokemon, combined with a 30% chance to burn. A burn can provide extra security against physical attackers that can boost their Attack, such as Mega Gyarados, Dragonite, and Zygarde-C. Iron Defense boosts Mega Slowbro's already insane natural physical bulk to impenetrable levels in order to lessen the damage dealt by the aforementioned physical attackers as well. Calm Mind allows Mega Slowbro to boost its somewhat lacking Special Defense while also boosting the damage dealt by each of its Scalds. This is essential in effectively breaking through Pokemon that can recover from the damage dealt from unboosted Scalds and the following burn chip damage or boost their own Special Defense stat, such as bulky Magearna, Zygarde-C, Mega Altaria, Mega Sableye, and Mew. Amnesia can also be run if Mega Slowbro needs to boost its Special Defense faster than Calm Mind and if the Special Attack boost brought by Calm Mind is unnecessary. This can come in handy against particularly scary matchups, like Mega Gardevoir, Meloetta, and Choice Specs Deoxys-S. Slack Off recovers Mega Slowbro's HP. Use this to heal off damage taken before Mega Slowbro boosts its defensive stats. Rest is another recovery option that fully restores Mega Slowbro's health and removes any status condition such as poison or burn. This can be particularly useful when facing off against other stall Pokemon, such as Jumpluff, Whimsicott, and non-Sleep Powder Mega Venusaur. However, the three turns of immobility can leave Mega Slowbro wide open for more offensive Pokemon like Mega Gyarados and Mega Gardevoir to set up and attack while Mega Slowbro is unable to match them defensively.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>As Mega Slowbro already has excess physical bulk uninvested, all the EVs are instead invested into HP and Special Defense in order to make sure that it can have the highest possible Special Defense. The leftover EVs are invested into Defense. Mega Slowbro runs 0 Speed IVs to make sure it can underspeed Pokemon such as Metal Burst Mega Aggron and Mega Mawile. This also ensures that you don't automically lose the Mega Slowbro mirror, which will end in Struggle being used on both sides and the slowest Pokemon winning. Before Mega Evolving, Slowbro has access to Oblivious, which prevents Taunt shutting it down, unlike most other stall Pokemon. Oblivious even blocks Taunt from Mold Breaker Pokemon like Mega Gyarados and Haxorus, allowing Mega Slowbro to continue setting up its defenses. Thanks to Shell Armor, Mega Slowbro can set up without worrying about critical hits, which similar Pokemon such as stall Deoxys-S and Necrozma worry about and often fall prey to.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Slowbro is designed to tank hits while setting up its defenses in order to make sure it can comfortably attack with Scald without ever getting in range of being knocked out. Shell Armor affords Mega Slowbro to not have to waste recovery to get out of range from a critical hit. Therefore, feel free to set up in ranges that might be a little bit more dangerous to other Pokemon as long as Mega Slowbro can recover from the damage dealt the next turn. Oblivious means you can send Mega Slowbro out against traditional Taunt users, such as Tapu Lele, Tapu Fini, Stall Deoxys-S, and bulky Kommo-o, and not have to worry about it being shut down as long as you do not Mega Evolve. One particularly important foe, Mega Gyarados, can only consistently beat Mega Slowbro if it has both Taunt and Crunch, as Slowbro must not Mega Evolve to avoid being Taunted, but Crunch will do too much to regular Slowbro. If Mega Gyarados only has Taunt, never Mega Evolve and instead set up Iron Defense in Mega Slowbro's regular form, getting to maximum Defense before chipping at it with Scald. If Mega Gyarados only has Crunch, you should Mega Evolve and set up to avoid fatal Crunch damage. Additionally, while Mega Gyarados's access to Mold Breaker won't matter against Oblivious, it can bypass Shell Armor. Dragonite can run both a viable physical set and a viable special set, so if you do not know the opponent's Dragonite set, you should boost Mega Slowbro's Special Defense immediately with either Amnesia or Calm Mind, as Mega Slowbro has enough natural bulk to tank a Supersonic Skystrike followed by Outrage, but not a Dragonium Z-boosted Draco Meteor or Flyinium Z-boosted Hurricane followed by Draco Meteor without a Special Defense buff. Also, Mega Slowbro is heavier than regular Slowbro, so if you find yourself up against Grass Knot users such as Choice Scarf Greninja, do not Mega Evolve.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can tank attacks that would be super effective against Mega Slowbro, namely Grass-, Electric-, Dark-, Bug-, and Ghost-type moves, naturally are its best teammate option. Pokemon such as Kommo-o and specially defensive Mega Charizard X can deal with Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Choice Specs Greninja, Aegislash, and Tapu Bulu that give Mega Slowbro a hard time and appreciate the positive matchups Mega Slowbro has against Psychic- and Rock-types, respectively. Specially defensive tanks are also a great option for teammates, as Mega Slowbro's biggest threats are usually special attackers. Pokemon like Meloetta, Chansey, Mega Tyranitar, and Blissey all work well with Mega Slowbro and appreciate the Fighting-type resistance that Mega Slowbro offers. As a Water-type, Mega Slowbro can fit well on a standard Fire / Water / Grass core team, especially appreciating the work put in by Pokemon from Fire-types like Incineroar, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Blaziken and from Grass-types like Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Bulu. The Fire- and Grass-types can effectively deal with Pokemon that threaten Mega Slowbro such as Z-Conversion Porygon-Z, Magnezone, Mega Charizard Y, and other Mega Slowbro. As Mega Slowbro is naturally slow, it is also susceptible to Pokemon such as Vivillon and Smeargle, whose strategies are only successful if they go first. Be sure to pair Mega Slowbro with at least sufficiently fast Pokemon, like Pheromosa, Mega Lopunny, and Porygon-Z. Mega Slowbro can beat the common Jumpluff, as it is able to recover back the health leeched by Leech Seed and PP stall Jumpluff.</p> "

  "Magneton": {
    "overview": "<p>Magneton has a niche in the 1v1 metagame over its evolved counterpart Magnezone due to its ability to outspeed Adamant variants of Mega Gyarados at maximum Speed, which is one of the best Pokemon in the tier and does not utilize a Jolly nature in high levels of play the majority of the time. It retains the fantastic Electric / Steel typing that gives it a large number of resistances. Due to its ability Sturdy, it is able to survive any hit from full HP, allowing it to fire off a powerful Gigavolt Havoc that beats Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Kartana, Porygon-Z, and Crustle. Magneton can also utilize its Z-Move in combination with Metal Sound in order to KO bulkier threats such as Tapu Lele, Magearna, and bulky Meloetta and has access to Electroweb in order to outspeed Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir and Mew. Magneton also serves as a viable answer to the plethora of Water-types that are viable in the 1v1 metagame such as Manaphy, Primarina, and Tapu Fini, utilizing Gigavolt Havoc to KO them. However, despite the fact that Magneton is able to tank almost any single hit and fire off a powerful attack in return, it has trouble versus Pokemon that are able to KO it before it is able to do much to them, such as bulky variants of Mega Metagross, Dragonite, and Mega Charizard X and Ground-types that are simply immune to its moves such as Landorus-T, Donphan, Golem, Excadrill, and Zygarde. Unlike its evolved counterpart, Magnezone, it is unable to learn Mirror Coat, which is the reason why it has trouble versus Pokemon such as Naganadel and Choice Scarf variants of Tapu Lele. It also has lower Special Attack than Magnezone, which prevents it from getting an OHKO on Landorus-T.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Magneton has no viable other options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Pokemon with Electric-type Immunities</strong>: Pokemon that are immune to Gigavolt Havoc wall Magneton, and the majority of its coverage options are not enough to take on such threats. Those threats include Donphan, Golem, Landorus-T, Zygarde, Garchomp, Mega Swampert, Excadrill, Zeraora, Thundurus-T, and Alolan Marowak.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker Users: Pokemon such as the rarely seen Jolly Earthquake Mega Gyarados, Haxorus, Hawlucha, and Choice Scarf Rampardos can all ignore Magneton's Sturdy and OHKO it with strong super effective moves before Magneton even has a chance to attack.</p> <p><strong>Fast or Offensive Dragon- and Grass-type Pokemon: Offensive Pokemon that resist Magneton's Gigavolt Havoc such as Mega Charizard X, Kommo-o, and Tapu Bulu can 2HKO Magneton with their coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Offensive Pokemon: Pokemon that can naturally survive a Gigavolt Havoc and hit Magneton super effectively such as specially defensive variants of Mega Metagross, Mega Tyranitar, and Hoopa-U beat it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Sturdy or Bulky Pokemon with Speed Control: Sturdy Pokemon such as Carracosta and Sawk have options to beat Magneton.

However, Zap Cannon can also be used for its guaranteed paralysis in many otherwise unwinnable matchups such as offensive Mega Charizard X, Volcarona, Naganadel, and bulky Victini. Metal Sound is essential to beating slow bulky offense and stall Pokemon such as Magearna, Meloetta, and Tapu Lele and slow variants of Mega Venusaur. Electroweb allows Magneton to beat faster Pokemon such as Tapu Lele. Protect serves as a way of retaining full health against Fake Out users such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham. This allows Magneton to tank any of their attacks with its ability, Sturdy, and KO with Gigavolt Havoc in return. Protect can also be used in a prediction against Aegislash, depending on whether it attacks or not. Hidden Power Ground allows Magneton to beat its more common evolved counterpart, Magnezone.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Magneton to outspeed Pokemon under base 70 Speed, as well as Adamant variants of Mega Gyarados. Maximum Special Attack investment allows Magneton to hit as hard as possible with its Z-Move, Gigavolt Havoc. The rest is put into HP in order to increase Magneton's overall bulk. Sturdy helps Magneton survive almost any hit from full HP.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>There are two courses of action that should be taken if the foe can tank the Z-Move. If Magneton is faster than the opposing Pokemon, start using Metal Sound. If Magneton is slower, use Electroweb to bring down their speed. Being faster Magneton to react more easily to the foe boosting their Special Defense, recovering, or using an attack. Against Substitute users such as Torrent Greninja and Mega Pinsir, use Electroweb in order to break their Substitute, as it is more reliable than Zap Cannon. Against an opposing Aegislash, it's best to use Protect if you predict an attack turn one, allowing you to use Gigavolt Havoc if you predict them to attack again. If you predict King's Shield, use Metal Sound followed by Gigavolt Havoc. Use the combination of Electroweb and Hidden Power Ground to beat opposing Magnezone and Magneton that do not carry Hidden Power Ground, in order not to lose to a Magnezone's Gigavolt Havoc, or a speed tie. In the case of losing matchups such as Choice Scarf Sawk and Mega Charizard X, use Zap Cannon and hope for a hit. If it does hit, use Gigavolt Havoc immediately after, followed by the most accurate moves in your moveset, as the chance of full paralysis can help win this matchup.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Magneton should be used in conjunction with Pokemon like Greninja, bulky Tapu Lele, defensive Mega Swampert, Occa Berry Whimsicott, and defensive Mega Gyarados that can beat the multitude of viable Ground- and Dragon-types such as Landorus-T, Donphan, Golem, Garchomp, Dragonite, and Mega Charizard X that beat Magneton. Magneton also supports them with good matchups versus offensive threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Magearna, Tapu Lele, Primarina, Porygon-Z, and Tapu Fini. Magneton can work well in a Dragon / Steel / Fairy core, appreciating the support from Pokemon like Dragonite, Kommo-o, and Magearna to take out Pokemon such as Golem and Donphan, while Magneton helps beat the Pokemon mentioned earlier.

  "Pinsir": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Pinsir is a powerful physical attacker that can force its way through foes such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Venusaur but has a hard time dealing with a lackluster defensive typing. Its Speed allows it to outspeed crucial base 100 Speed Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Mega Gardevoir, Volcarona, and Mew, in addition to slightly faster Pokemon such as non-Choice Scarf Garchomp, and other important offensive threats such as non-Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Tapu Lele, and Landorus-T. It is adept at taking on slower Pokemon that are weak to its Aerilate-boosted STAB moves, such as Mega Venusaur and Kommo-o, as well as some frailer Pokemon that do not resist them, such as Hoopa-U and Tapu Lele. Its decent physical bulk allows it to take on Pokemon like Mega Gyarados and Mega Mawile., and setup moves in Swords Dance and Bulk Up let it boost past bulkier Pokemon that it cannot OHKO, like Type: Null, Magearna, Chansey, and Mega Mawile. However, its typing leaves it vulnerable to common Rock-, Electric-, and Fire-types types, such as Golem, Zeraora, and bulky Flame Charge Mega Charizard X. Many Pokemon also carry moves of these types as coverage moves; for example, Choice Scarf Genesect commonly run Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, or Flamethrower. Mega Pinsir has trouble with physically defensive Pokemon, especially with the abundance of Steel-types. For example, Mega Aggron, Mega Metagross, and Mega Slowbro all hard wall Mega Pinsir. Furthermore, despite Mega Pinsir being fast, its Speed is by no means stellar. Faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Choice Scarf Victini, and Jumpluff all reliably deal with it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Pinsir does not have many other options outside of changing up its moveset. Flail is a decent move option over Earthquake that when used in conjunction with Substitute has the potential to reach 200 Base Power, allowing Mega Pinsir to outright OHKO most Pokemon, potentially even Pokemon that resist Flying. This is useful against slower bulkier foes that Giga Impact does not always OHKO, such as non-Flame Charge Mega Charizard X and Garchomp. However, this means that Mega Pinsir cannot reliably take on Magearna or Mega Mawile anymore. Rock Tomb allows Mega Pinsir to force a mind game versus bulky Mega Charizard X, as you can use Rock Tomb on its Flame Charge to finish it off with a Giga Impact the following turn. Against physical Dragonite, use Substitute first to scout for a Z-Move before using Rock Tomb to negate its Dragon Dance, and then finish it off with Giga Impact. Rock Tomb can also help against Choice Scarf Sawk, as Pinsir can survive a Stone Edge before Mega Evolving. Other options include X-Scissor for Mega Slowbro and Close Combat for Mega Tyranitar. These are suboptimal, however, as they force Mega Pinsir to replace Earthquake, which causes it to lose to Magearna, one of the best Pokemon in 1v1. Return can be used as a more reliable STAB move that does not force Mega Pinsir to recharge after, removing predictions against Pokemon like Whimsicott and Serperior, as well as giving Mega Pinsir a chance against Substitute users like Landorus-T. It can also help in matchups where Mega Pinsir cannot OHKO the foe with Giga Impact, such as against Type: Null. Quick Attack is also an option to finish off faster Pokemon, such as Jumpluff, as well as outspeed Whimsicott's Prankster-boosted moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Although Mega Pinsir has a decent Speed tier, many Pokemon such as Greninja, Mega Lopunny, and Zeraora still outspeed it and are able to OHKO it thanks to its middling defenses. Pokemon that typically run Choice Scarf such as Porygon-Z and Genesect can simply OHKO Mega Pinsir before it has a chance to attack.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon: Pokemon that can tank a hit from Mega Pinsir and retaliate will give it a hard time. Bulky Mega Charizard X can simply use Flame Charge and finish off Mega Pinsir on the following turn. Dragonite can use Dragon Dance or simply keep attacking without fear of getting OHKOed. In particular, Sturdy Pokemon like Donphan, Golem, and Crustle can fire back with super effective moves that cripple Mega Pinsir. Dragonite also beats Mega Pinsir with ease, as it can either OHKO Mega Pinsir upfront or outspeed it after a Dragon Dance before attacking, while Mega Pinsir has no way of OHKOing Dragonite back through Multiscale.</p> <p><strong>Stall Pokemon: While Mega Pinsir does have a way of setting up, it does not have a consistently powerful move to punish certain stall Pokemon. This means that Pokemon like Mega Slowbro, Mega Sableye, and Clefable can set up their defenses and whittle down Mega Pinsir over time.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Giga Impact is Mega Pinsir's strongest move and allows it to OHKO most frail Pokemon like non-Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Mega Gardevoir, and Tapu Lele. Substitute is used to evade status from Pokemon like Mew and Mega Swampert. It can also be used to waste the foe's Z-Move, such as against Magearna and Aegislash. Earthquake along with Mold Breaker helps Mega Pinsir OHKO Magnezone through Sturdy and beat other Steel-types like Magearna and Mega Mawile. Swords Dance lets Mega Pinsir boost its power to unrivaled levels, especially when behind a Substitute, helping Mega Pinsir break through defensive Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Zygarde. Bulk Up can bolster Mega Pinsir's offense and defense simultaneously and is primarily used against other physical attackers like Mega Mawile, which unboosted Mega Pinsir cannot OHKO.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given Speed investment allows Mega Pinsir to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon as well as slightly faster Pokemon such as Garchomp and Nihilego. Maximum Attack investment allows Mega Pinsir to hit as hard and fast as possible, notably OHKOing uninvested Mega Charizard X. The rest of the EVs are put into Defense to improve Mega Pinsir's bulk, giving it better chances to survive Play Rough followed by Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile after Bulk Up. Mega Pinsir's pre-Mega abilities are both useful. Hyper Cutter allows Mega Pinsir to ignore the plethora of Intimidate users in the tier, notably Mega Mawile and Mega Gyarados, in addition to Attack-lowering moves like Charm from Chansey and Umbreon. Mold Breaker, on the other hand, lets Mega Pinsir ignore foes' abilities like Magnezone's Sturdy. Aerilate gives Mega Pinsir that extra bit of power, as well as giving it fantastic Flying-type STAB on Normal-type moves like Giga Impact.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With decent physical bulk, Mega Pinsir can tank hits from Pokemon like boosted Mega Gyarados, Zygarde, and Mega Mawile, to buy itself time to set up and retaliate. Against Mega Mawile, Hyper Cutter and Bulk Up are required to be able to survive a Play Rough followed by Sucker Punch while having enough Attack to OHKO in return with  +1 Earthquake. Against standard Magearna, use Substitute first. If it keeps attacking, use Substitute again until it is at -2 Special Attack, and then use Swords Dance instead of Substitute, as Mega Pinsir can survive a -2 Fleur Cannon and OHKO it with +2 Earthquake. Otherwise, if it starts setting up with Iron Defense, use Swords Dance while safely behind a free Substitute and then use Earthquake to 2HKO it when it stops setting up. Mega Pinsir can set up against passive Pokemon like Chansey by using Substitute to prevent being statused and boosting past their defenses with Swords Dance. Against Pokemon that cannot deal fatal damage to Mega Pinsir such as defensive Mew and Tapu Fini, use Swords Dance to OHKO them with Giga Impact the following turn. If Mew burns Mega Pinsir with Will-O-Wisp, simply use Swords Dance again. Mega Swampert, Mega Blastoise, and Aegislash are matchups that Mega Pinsir can force in its favor, provided the right plays are made. Use Substitute on the first turn. Against the first two, attempt to use Swords Dance without Mega Evolving to avoid taking fatal damage from Ice Beam. For Aegislash, try to attack it in its vulnerable Sword forme, which it will be in after it attacks Mega Pinsir's Substitute. Be wary about sending this into Pokemon that may seem susceptible to Mega Pinsir. Despite the typing advantage, Mega Pinsir has trouble in matchups against Pokemon like Jumpluff, Serperior, and Whimsicott. For Donphan, use Substitute to bait out Head Smash so it takes recoil and loses Sturdy. Proceed to finish it off with Giga Impact.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Pinsir struggles with the majority of Fire-, Rock-, Ground-, Electric-, and Steel-types, so Mega Swampert and Quagsire can help in handling Pokemon like Crustle, Donphan, Zeraora, and Mega Aggron. They also sufficiently deal with the omnipresent Mega Charizard X and Dragonite. Mega Pinsir deals with some of the wallbreakers that threaten them like Normalium Z Porygon-Z, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Gyarados. Mega Pinsir has trouble with faster offensive threats like Greninja, Naganadel, and Mega Lopunny, so bulky Pokemon like Magearna, Donphan, and Pyukumuku are good partners. Mega Pinsir can handle the Pokemon that threaten them, like Taunt Tapu Fini, defensive Mew, and Mega Venusaur. As Mega Pinsir has difficulty dealing with physically defensive Pokemon like Mega Slowbro and Mega Metagross, it appreciates special attackers such as Greninja, Aegislash, and Mega Charizard Y. In return, Mega Pinsir can take out specially bulky Pokemon like Mega Gyarados and defensive Kommo-o.</p> "

  "Gyarados": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Gyarados is a dominant force in the 1v1 metagame. After it Mega Evolves, Gyarados's ability becomes Mold Breaker, allowing it to ignore abilities such as Sturdy, Multiscale, and Magic Bounce from notable foes such as Crustle, Dragonite, and Mega Sableye. Gyarados may also opt not to Mega Evolve, preserving its Water / Flying typing over Water / Dark, opening up an entire other range of Pokemon it can tank attacks from such as Magearna and Sawk. Additionally, Mega Gyarados has an impressive movepool featuring usable STAB attacks in Waterfall and Crunch, good coverage options such as Outrage and Earthquake, anti-stall measures like Taunt, and also boosting moves, particularly Dragon Dance, which it is an exemplary user of. This is because of its great bulk paired with its high Attack stat, and despite its somewhat lackluster Speed, it's capable of outspeeding most Pokemon with proper investment after a boost. While it is indeed incredibly powerful, it's far from unstoppable, with bulky offensive Pokemon that have favorable type matchups like Tapu Lele, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Altaria countering it.</p> <p>Gyarados also has access to Supersonic Skystrike to complement its Water typing quite nicely, allowing it to lure in and break through typical Mega Gyarados checks like Mega Venusaur, slow Kommo-o, and Kartana. Flyinium Z Gyarados does have many flaws, however, including the inability to change its typing and the loss of Mold Breaker. This leaves it vulnerable to Pokemon like Dragonite, Golem, Mew, Aegislash, and Magnezone because it cannot change its typing. Flyinium Z Gyarados also overrelies on Bounce and Supersonic Skystrike, which means that once its Z-Move is spent, it has to use its unreliable two-turn Bounce, which can easily be taken advantage of, particularly by Protect and Substitute users like Serperior.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A set utilizing Curse, Rest, Payback, and Ice Fang with an EV spread of 232 HP / 32 Atk / 244 Def and an Adamant nature can be used to take on Mega Metagross somewhat reliably by using Curse followed by Payback. It also beats Landorus-T and Zygarde. However, Curse is incompatible with Intimidate, significantly worsening Mega Gyarados's initial physical bulk and making it unable to beat most Mega Charizard X. A set featuring Thunderbolt, Fire Blast, Ice Beam, and a filler move such as Hurricane or Taunt can be used to beat opposing Mega Gyarados, Zygarde, Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, Genesect, Kartana, Mega Scizor, Durant, Buzzwole, and Mega Heracross, providing outstanding utility. However, it is incredibly weak, leaving it as purely a lure set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Most Steel-types, notably including Mega Metagross, Genesect, Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Durant, can take care of Mega Gyarados in one way or another, generally as a result of their large Defense stats and super effective coverage.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Fairy-types, by various means, can generally beat Mega Gyarados. Such Pokemon include Tapu Lele, Mega Altaria, Tapu Fini, Primarina, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Mawile.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Mega Slowbro and Buzzwole can tank Mega Gyarados's attacks easily as a result of their high Defense and shrug off the damage with reliable recovery or KO Mega Gyarados back.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Boosters: Pokemon such as Mega Pinsir, Zeraora, and Kartana can all tank a hit from a +1 Mega Gyarados, and after a Swords Dance or Bulk Up, KO Mega Gyarados.</p> <p><strong>Coverage-dependent Checks: Pokemon that can use attacks that hit both regular and Mega Gyarados effectively, utilizing coverage combos such as Electric+Fighting or Electric+Grass, can beat Mega Gyarados.

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Mega Gyarados's Attack and Speed stats, allowing it to take on faster Pokemon better, notably beating certain variants of Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Metagross. Waterfall is Mega Gyarados's Water STAB move and hits Landorus-T, Donphan, Golem, and Crustle super effectively. It also has a very useful 20% chance to flinch. Crunch provides Mega Gyarados with a Dark-type STAB attack and hits Mega Metagross, Mega Slowbro, Meloetta, Mew, and Necrozma. Be wary of Thunder Punch variants of Mega Metagross, however, which beat this Mega Gyarados set. Note also that in order to check Mega Slowbro, Taunt must be used. In addition to the aforementioned coverage-dependent targets, Taunt can beat Mega Sableye and stop Pokemon like Zygarde and Crustle from using setup moves. Outrage hits equally as hard as Mega Gyarados's STAB attacks and provides valuable coverage against opposing Mega Gyarados, Dragonite, Zygarde, and Garchomp. In order to beat Zygarde, however, Mega Gyarados must have Taunt so that Zygarde can't use Coil. Earthquake can be used to beat most Magnezone and get a better matchup against Magearna and Mega Mawile. Stone Edge allows Gyarados to reliably beat Mega Charizard Y and most Mega Pinsir, and in the absence of Outrage, it is useful against Mega Charizard X and Dragonite.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP EVs help maximize Mega Gyarados's mixed bulk better than 252 HP EVs would. 28 Defense EVs with the given HP nearly guarantee that Mega Gyarados can avoid a 2HKO from Adamant Mega Charizard X's Outrage. Similarly, 44 SpD EVs with the given HP give Mega Gyarados an extremely favorable roll against Porygon-Z's Uproar, avoiding a 2HKO without investing many EVs. 144 Speed EVs allow Mega Gyarados to outspeed Pokemon with base 110 Speed like Mega Metagross and Mega Diancie after a Dragon Dance. The remainder of Mega Gyarados's EVs are placed into Attack to hit as hard as possible, and for the same reason, an Adamant nature is used. Intimidate is Mega Gyarados's most viable pre-Mega ability, as it effectively increases Mega Gyarados's physical bulk by a factor of 1.5.</p> <p>Mega Gyarados can also run a spread of 248 HP / 44 SpD / 216 Spe with an Adamant nature, which lets it outspeed Greninja after a Dragon Dance, covering for the unpredictability of Greninja, in exchange for the loss in reliability, while still retaining its extremely favorable Uproar Porygon-Z odds. This will sacrifice slight offensive presence and the avoided 2HKO roll from Adamant Mega Charizard X, however.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against Donphan and other Counter users, outside of Golem, it is advisable to use Dragon Dance twice before attacking with Waterfall so that Mega Gyarados can OHKO them, thus avoiding a potential Counter. If Waterfall is not being run, Outrage or Crunch will usually 2HKO them +1, but Counter must still be played around. If you end up in a seemingly unwinnable matchup and are running Waterfall, it is advisable to go for flinches, which can allow you to win through luck. This is not a strategy that should be relied upon, however. Versus Crustle, Mega Gyarados should use Taunt immediately, if it is running it, set up Dragon Dance, and then KO with Waterfall. If Waterfall isn't being used, Mega Gyarados must play correctly by using Taunt only on turns where Crustle tries to set up Shell Smash and never attack on a turn on which Crustle uses Counter. Without Waterfall, this matchup is not favorable. If Mega Gyarados is using Taunt and Crunch, to beat most Mega Slowbro, it should use Crunch until Slowbro opts to Mega Evolve, as Slowbro has the Oblivious ability, which Mold Breaker is ineffective against. When pitted against Zygarde, Mega Gyarados should use Taunt, set up Dragon Dance, and only then attack. Provided that Gyarados is using Earthquake, it may also check Magearna by using Earthquake (and not Mega Evolving) on turn one and following it up with a Taunt or additional Earthquake depending upon whether Magearna uses Iron Defense or Twinkle Tackle. Similarly, with Crunch, Mega Gyarados can outplay defensive Mew by setting up Dragon Dance on an incoming Will-O-Wisp or using Crunch on an incoming Taunt. After using Dragon Dance, Mega Gyarados should proceed to Taunt Mew. In some situations, it may be advantageous to not Mega Evolve, which preserves regular Gyarados's Water / Flying typing. This gives it a better shot at beating Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Greninja, and Sawk, although Gyarados must still be wary of Electric-type coverage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fast and hard-hitting Pokemon such as Naganadel, Greninja, and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z make for good teammates, as they can deal with various Pokemon that threaten Mega Gyarados like Mega Charizard Y, Tapu Lele, and Genesect, while Gyarados can cover up their weaknesses to Sturdy users. Jumpluff makes for a strong Mega Gyarados teammate, as it can deal with Magearna, Mega Metagross, Landorus-T, and certain variants of Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Lele. Meanwhile, Mega Gyarados can support Jumpluff by beating Pokemon that it struggles against such as Crustle, Heatran, and Naganadel. Pokemon with typings that have synergy with Mega Gyarados's make for good teammates. Grass- and Fire- type Pokemon in particular form a Fire / Water / Grass core with Mega Gyarados and cover its weaknesses to Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon. Examples of such Pokemon include Mega Venusaur, Mega Charizard X, and Victini.</p> "

        "name": "Flyinium Z",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Bounce allows Gyarados to execute a powerful Supersonic Skystrike, which hits Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and slow Kommo-o for super effective damage and after a Dragon Dance hits hard enough to take out the likes of Mega Charizard X. Taunt is particularly useful against Pokemon like Jumpluff, Ferrothorn, and Substitute Primarina. Dragon Dance allows Gyarados to outspeed threats like Greninja, Mega Charizard Y, Garchomp, and Mega Lopunny after a single boost. Waterfall lets Gyarados deal with Heatran and Donphan. Bulldoze is an interesting move option over Waterfall that allows Flyinium Z Gyarados to bypass faster Taunt users like Kee Berry Mew and stall Deoxys-S by slowing them down enough so that Gyarados can Taunt them first.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>208 Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Gyarados to outspeed common threats like Smeargle, non-Hasty Kommo-o, and, after a Dragon Dance, Garchomp and Jumpluff. 8 HP EVs with 84 Special Defense EVs enable Gyarados to survive a Hidden Power Electric from Mega Charizard Y. The rest is invested into Attack to allow it to hit as hard as possible and help with rolls against bulky Mega Charizard X. Intimidate increases Gyarados's survivability against physical threats such as Choice Band Garchomp, Kartana, and Mega Lopunny. Flyinium Z turns Bounce into Supersonic Skystrike, not only boosting its power but also allowing Gyarados to use a Flying-type attack immediately.</p> <p>Alternatively, the set can be varied to better take on bulky Mega Charizard X. 252 Atk / 84 Def / 172 Spe with an Adamant nature lets Gyarados OHKO Mega Charizard X with +1 Supersonic Skystrike while also tanking an Outrage after a Dragon Dance. However, this means it underspeeds Pokemon like Smeargle and Tapu Bulu, as well as Mega Lopunny even after a Dragon Dance. A spread of 120 HP / 120 Atk / 12 Def / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature allows Gyarados to outspeed Smeargle and tank an Outrage from Mega Charizard X after a Dragon Dance as well as Hidden Power Electric from Mega Charizard Y. However, this set fails to KO bulky Mega Charizard X, which is the more common variant.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against defensive Mega Venusaur, it is better to use Taunt before using Supersonic Skystrike, in case they survive the initial attack. Against Greninja, use Dragon Dance turn one in case they are running Torrent. Follow up with Supersonic Skystrike if they do not use Substitute; if they do, use Taunt, and use Waterfall to break their Substitute before unleashing Gyarados's Z-Move. Against Primarina, it is best to test the waters to see if they are running Substitute. Use Dragon Dance first, and if they use Substitute, use Taunt to prevent them from using Substitute again. Then, use Bounce to break their Substitute, and finish them off with a Supersonic Skystrike. If they do not have Substitute, just set up Dragon Dance twice and then use Supersonic Skystrike. Despite Gyarados's ability to lure in and take out most Grass-types, Serperior in particular is a tricky matchup, as Gyarados overrelies on Bounce. As long as Serperior baits out the Z-Move and uses Protect on Supersonic Skystrike, it has the upper hand, particularly as Leaf Storm 2HKOes Gyarados. The best play for Gyarados is to use Dragon Dance first and Taunt Serperior after. If they have a Substitute up, use Waterfall to break the Substitute, then go for Supersonic Skystrike.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Flyinium Z Gyarados appreciates teammates that lure in the likes of Mega Venusaur, Kommo-o, and Mega Charizard Y. Serperior is a great partner for this reason, as it is vulnerable to opposing Grass-, Dragon-, and Fire-types and appreciates Gyarados's coverage, in particular its ability to handle both Mega Charizard X and Y. On the other hand, Serperior deals with threats like most Sturdy Pokemon, Zeraora, Mew, and Magearna, in addition to Mega Gyarados. Magearna is another good partner that lures in Mega Venusaur while also dealing with Sturdy Pokemon that Gyarados has trouble taking on, such as Golem, Crustle, and Donphan. It also sufficiently deals with Dragonite and Porygon-Z. Gyarados beats Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Heatran in return. Bulky Ground-types like Zygarde and Landorus-T aid Gyarados by taking care of most Sturdy Pokemon, as well as providing an immunity to Electric-type moves, which Gyarados is 4x weak to, allowing them to beat Pokemon like Zeraora and Victini. They also beat pesky Steel-types like Magearna and Mega Mawile. Gyarados helps with Greninja and Jumpluff, Pokemon that Landorus-T and Zygarde struggle against. Taunt Air Balloon Heatran is very useful in taking out SubSeed users like Serperior that Gyarados has unreliable matchups against, as well as providing a decent check to Sturdy Pokemon like Donphan and Golem. In return, Gyarados covers Kommo-o, Garchomp, and Mega Lopunny.</p> "

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<p>Zapdos has an uncommon niche in 1v1 as a hybrid of offense and stall, giving it a unique matchup spread that can't easily be achieved using exclusively one or the other. Gigavolt Havoc can OHKO the many bulky Water-types in 1v1, such as Primarina, Tapu Fini, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Gyarados, while slower, bulkier Pokemon such as Necrozma and Porygon2 get Toxic stalled. Zapdos's nature as a hybrid Pokemon adds a degree of unpredictability that makes it difficult to play against. Pressure is a useful ability that lets Zapdos PP stall Pokemon that rely on a single move, such as Magearna. However, Zapdos is held back by its mediocre bulk, necessitating a very defensive spread that can't afford to invest in Speed. Zapdos's average bulk and inability to invest in Speed keep it from reliably tanking hits from powerhouses like Mega Charizard Y and Substitute Torrent Greninja or outspeeding threats such as Tapu Lele and Jumpluff. Zapdos's lack of access to Taunt means that it is outclassed as a staller by Pokemon that can use it, such as Mew and Deoxys-S, and it cannot win against other stallers such as Whimsicott and Registeel.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Reflect is an alternative option with a faster EV spread that aims to improve Zapdos's matchups against physical attackers such as Mega Metagross. Combined with Hidden Power Ice, Reflect gives Zapdos consistent wins over notable physical attackers like Garchomp and Landorus-T. Laser Focus and Metal Sound are options over Substitute that can be used to defeat Kee Berry Mew and Type: Null, respectively. Heat Wave is an option for a more offensive Zapdos set that can beat Ferrothorn and Genesect. Charge is a niche choice, allowing Zapdos to double the damage of Gigavolt Havoc, gaining OHKOs it otherwise misses, such as Choice Scarf Genesect.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Stall: Pokemon with better stall tools than Zapdos such as Rest Zygarde and Amnesia Registeel reliably beat it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Rock-types: Faster Rock-types or Rock-types with Speed-boosting moves, such as Carracosta, Mega Diancie, and Crustle, all OHKO or 2HKO Zapdos comfortably.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Bypass: Pokemon that use sound moves and other moves that bypass Substitute makes Toxic stalling a difficult prospect for Zapdos.

These include Whimsicott, Deoxys-S, and Kee Berry Mew.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Offense: Faster Pokemon that have immediate power such as Mega Charizard X and Y, Mega Gardevoir, and Tapu Lele won't give Zapdos a chance to inflict them with Toxic or set up a Substitute.</p> ",

        "name": "Hybird",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunder is Zapdos's best offensive move and should be used whenever stalling the opposing Pokemon isn't a viable choice. Common threats defeated by Gigavolt Havoc include Mega Gyarados, Primarina, Mega Slowbro, Tapu Fini, Kartana, Celesteela, Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, and Heatran. Zap Cannon is a viable option over Thunder, giving Zapdos a harder-hitting Z-Move and a better chance of hitting and paralyzing the foe. However, not having the higher accuracy of Thunder means you can lose out on important 2HKOs such as against Mega Mawile, Heatran, and Choice Scarf Timid Genesect. Zap Cannon can also make PP stall matchups more difficult, because a Pokemon does not lose PP if it is fully paralyzed. In exchange, the higher paralysis chance of Zap Cannon gives higher chances of winning against faster threats Zapdos can 2HKO, such as Naganadel. Toxic is present to outstall threats that can tank or are immune to Gigavolt Havoc, such as Mega Altaria, Donphan, Clefable, Necrozma, and Porygon2. Roost is a reliable recovery option that can also be useful in shedding Zapdos's Flying typing for a turn, allowing Zapdos to win mind games and defeat Pokemon with coverage moves for Flying-types, such as Donphan and Mega Swampert. Because Electric shares no weakness with Electric / Flying typing, being able to use Roost to change typing is a powerful asset. The final move is Substitute, giving Zapdos a reliable win against the ever-present Magearna, as well as wins over important threats such as Necrozma, Porygon2, Chansey, and usually Aegislash.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>240 HP EVs and 136 Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature allow Zapdos to survive a Hyper Beam from Modest Porygon-Z and an Ice Beam from Timid Choice Specs Greninja. 28 Special Attack EVs ensure an OHKO against uninvested Porygon-Z.  112 Defense EVs with the given HP investment give Zapdos enough physical bulk to sometimes keep a Substitute against Donphan's Ice Shard, as eventually having a Substitute not broken is critical in order to beat Donphan. Pressure allows Zapdos to PP stall, in conjunction with Substitute and Roost, Pokemon that use Choice items or simply don't have much PP, such as Magearna and Choice Specs Necrozma. Electrium Z is the best item for this set, allowing Zapdos to pick up many OHKOs with very little Special Attack investment.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>A safe turn 1 play against most slower Pokemon is often Substitute, allowing Zapdos to block any status moves or Z-Moves they may want to use immediately. This is especially true against Magearna, Chansey, and Aegislash. Against Magearna, make sure Zapdos always stays behind a Substitute to avoid potentially taking a critical hit. Eventually, Fleur Cannon will not break the Substitute, and you can use Roost to guarantee the win. Against Donphan, you need to be aware of the mind game between Roost and Earthquake and of the possible Head Smash. Use Substitute on turn 1 to scout for Head Smash. If Donphan has Head Smash, you need to choose the correct turn to Roost. Using Roost on turn 2 or 3 is much better than on turn 4, because on turn 4 Zapdos will be in range of being KOed by Ice Shard. If Donphan has Rock Tomb instead, purposefully tank the hit so Zapdos becomes slower and no longer needs to worry about Earthquake. Eventually, this matchup becomes a loop of Ice Shard against Substitute and Roost. Continue using Roost and Substitute until Ice Shard fails to break the Substitute. Then, use Toxic to ensure the win. Against Aegislash, use Substitute and Roost to survive and recover against Never-Ending Nightmare. Use Gigavolt Havoc on a turn you think the opponent will not use King's Shield. Against Heatran, use Thunder on turn 1.  If it misses, use Roost; otherwise, Gigavolt Havoc KOes. Zap Cannon and Thunder have decent chances of inflicting paralysis, which can be used to occasionally win matches you would otherwise lose, such as against Choice Specs Genesect and Naganadel.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Zapdos has losing matchups against many of the bulky offense Pokemon that can't be reliably Toxic stalled, such as Mega Charizard X and Y, physical Dragonite, Mega Gardevoir, and Zygarde. Bulky Water- and Fairy-types, such as Primarina, Mega Slowbro, and Tapu Lele, can each handle a combination of those threats, while Zapdos handles threats such as Metal Sound Celesteela, Magearna, and other Water-types that threaten these complements. Zapdos also has excellent synergy with Fire-types such as Heatran and Victini that can handle the various Fairy-, Steel-, and Grass-types that Zapdos may not be able to, notably Mega Gardevoir, Tapu Lele, Choice Specs Genesect, and Tapu Bulu. Zapdos deals with Protean Greninja, Porygon2, and bulky Water-types that threaten such Fire-types.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Dragonite is a valuable asset to teams because its ability Multiscale allows it to withstand hits from some of the most powerful Pokemon in the metagame, such as Porygon-Z, Mega Charizard Y, and Magnezone. With more than competent offensive stats, physically and specially, and a loaded arsenal of powerful STAB and coverage attacks, Dragonite is capable of punching through just about any offensive Pokemon, bulky and otherwise, such as Meloetta, Zygarde, and Magnezone. Extreme Speed also gives Dragonite an opportunity to play around certain matchups that other setup users and tanky attackers simply do not have, namely the ability to pick up KOs against weakened Pokemon, such as Kommo-o and Garchomp after using its Z-Move and Magnezone after Earthquake. Dragonite can also use both Choice Scarf and Choice Band to lure in and defeat Pokemon that would be able to beat Z-Move variants, like Greninja, Tapu Lele, and Magearna, with Choice Band in particular providing almost Z-Move-like power for all moves, in exchange for being more predictable and losing the ability to pick off weakened foes with Extreme Speed. However, despite having a viable means of setting up with Dragon Dance, Dragonite still ends up struggling against Pokemon with the raw bulk, type resistances, or setup to withstand its attacks, namely against Mega Gyarados, Magearna, Tapu Lele, and Mega Slowbro. Additionally, there are Pokemon that can play around Multiscale while still advancing their win condition, such as Will-O-Wisp Mega Charizard X and Mega Gardevoir and Fake Out + Ice Punch Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A specially offensive set with Dragonium Z + Draco Meteor can be ran over Flyinium Z + Hurricane, but without a sufficiently viable means of increasing the power of its Z-Move, in addition to the lacking metagame coverage that Dragon-type moves provide, it ends up being outclassed by Flyinium Z. The one upside to it is that Dragonite doesn't have to run Speed anymore, since the extra power from Devastating Drake lets Dragonite 2HKO Kommo-o even after Clangorous Soulblaze, which means you can move those EVs into Special Defense, letting Dragonite reliably withstand an Ice Beam from Choice Specs Greninja. Groundium Z with Earthquake can be run to bait Pokemon that would otherwise counter Dragonite, like Magearna, Ice Punch Mega Metagross, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Mawile.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Pokemon like Magearna, Tapu Lele, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Altaria, and Tapu Fini all withstand attacks from Dragonite either naturally or with the help of moves like Reflect, Will-O-Wisp, and Cotton Guard and make quick work of Dragonite with their Fairy-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Coverage Attacks: Certain Pokemon can either safely break Multiscale and KO Dragonite or have the natural bulk or type advantages to withstand its attacks and threaten it with their super effective coverage attacks, namely Outrage Mega Gyarados, Ice Beam Greninja, Ice Punch Mega Metagross, Ice Beam Genesect, and Ice Punch Mega Lopunny.</p> <p><strong>Stall: Stall Pokemon often have sufficient bulk to withstand attacks from Dragonite and can either set up defensively to mitigate its damage or hinder Dragonite with some kind of stat-dropping move and heal off any damage Dragonite does all the while. These Pokemon include Mega Slowbro, Kee Berry Mew, Chansey, and Mega Sableye.</p> ",

        "name": "Z-Outrageous",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Outrage is Dragonite's main STAB attack and doubles as the base move for a powerful Devastating Drake, which brushes aside most foes it hits neutrally that lack absurd physical bulk or hindering status moves, such as Mega Charizard Y, Porygon-Z, and Meloetta. Earthquake is an essential coverage move for hitting the Steel-types that resist both of Dragonite's STAB attacks, like Magnezone, Heatran, and Aegislash. Extreme Speed is a useful move for picking off weakened targets after they've been softened up by Dragonite's other attacks, as well as breaking Sturdy from Counter users like Donphan and Sawk. Some relevant examples that this move helps against include Kommo-o, Magnezone, Donphan, and Zeraora. Dragon Dance is Dragonite's setup move and also enables the use of Z-Dragon Dance, which restores the user's lowered stats to +0 before setting up, if ran with Dragonium Z. Matchups you'll find yourself needing Dragon Dance for include Normalium Z Porygon-Z, Meloetta, Zygarde, Mega Venusaur, Mega Pinsir, and Mewinium Mew. Alternatively, a similar set with Fly over one of Dragonite's moves and Flyinium Z over Dragonium Z can be run, sacrificing matchups against Pokemon that Devastating Drake would win against, like opposing Dragonite, Zygarde, and Bulk Up Zeraora, in favor of winning matchups against Pokemon like slow Tapu Lele, Genesect, Primarina, and Durant. Substitute can also be run over Earthquake or Extreme Speed with a more defensive spread in order to lure in and beat Mega Charizard X every time, regardless of spreads or moveset. Protect can be used to block Fake Out from Mega Lopunny, Zeraora, Mega Medicham, and Incineroar in order to maintain Multiscale. Fire Punch can be used to safely beat Genesect, Kartana, Ferrothorn, and Durant.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>156 HP EVs make Dragonite survive a Choice Band Outrage from Garchomp. When combined with 36 Special Defense EVs, Dragonite also lives Choice Specs Draco Meteor from Naganadel and Latios. The 172 Speed EVs let Dragonite outspeed Serperior after a Dragon Dance, while 144 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature maximizes its attack in order to almost always 2HKO Aegislash with Earthquake. Multiscale is an essential ability that allows Dragonite to withstand an attack, at full health, from most Pokemon beyond Mold Breaker users or Pokemon with extremely powerful super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p>Thanks to Multiscale, Dragonite has several other EV spreads at its disposal. A spread of 160 HP / 72 Atk / 104 SpD / 172 Spe and a Careful Nature can be run in order to beat Choice Specs Greninja, a very common metagame threat, alongside the HP to tank a Choice Band Outrage from Garchomp. This also still beats Serperior with its 172 Speed EVs and the 72 Attack. However, this will lose out reliability on both physical defense and offensive presence, so Landorus-T should no longer be considered reliable. If Substitute is being run, Dragonite should run 188 HP / 28 Atk / 120 Def / 172 Spe with an Adamant Nature, as this makes sure Dragonite will always be able to use Substitute after an Outrage from Mega Charizard X, as well as always survive a Draco Meteor from Naganadel, and outspeed Serperior after a Dragon Dance.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Dragonite is best used against Pokemon that lack or don't use reliable recovery and some way to boost their Defense or lower the foe's Attack, such as Mega Charizard Y, Aegislash, Meloetta, and Magnezone. Even though Dragonite doesn't have the greatest defensive typing, Multiscale makes it capable of withstanding hits from even most super effective hits, such as Mega Charizard X's Outrage, Porygon-Z's Ice Beam, Kommo-o's Clangorous Soulblaze, and Crustle's Continental Crush. Against Mega Charizard X, Dragon Dance is usually the ideal play, as they will most often opt to use Will-O-Wisp to hinder Dragonite's Attack and break Multiscale to KO it on the next turn with Outrage. Using Dragon Dance will allow Dragonite to either OHKO them with Devastating Drake if they try to Mega Evolve or 2HKO them with Devastating Drake followed by Extreme Speed if they don't. It becomes a bit prediction based once your opponent knows the tech, though; if you predict them to use a move other than Will-O-Wisp, you should Devastating Drake right away, as an Outrage from Mega Charizard X after a Dragon Dance or Flame Charge will likely KO Dragonite. Z-Dragon Dance is only really useful for getting past certain Taunt users, namely Mew, but it also helps for the Landorus-T matchup, as Z-Dragon Dance undoes Intimidate's Attack drop and boosts Dragonite to +1, in addition to undoing a possible Speed reduction from Rock Tomb. Be aware that Head Smash + Counter + Ice Shard Donphan can play mind games with Dragonite, putting it in range of Ice Shard after a Head Smash while threatening to KO with Counter the first turn if Dragonite uses its Z-Move. If you're running Substitute, use Substitute turn one against Mega Charizard X, followed by either a Devastating Drake if they used Outrage turn one, or a Dragon Dance if they do anything else.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Steel-type Pokemon like Magnezone, Genesect, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela all help to cover Dragonite's weakness to common Fairy-types like Magearna, Tapu Lele, Mega Gardevoir, Togekiss, and Clefable while being aided by Dragonite's proficiency against the Fighting-, Ground-, and Fire-types that would threaten them, like Mega Charizard Y, Zygarde, Landorus-T, Heatran, and Blaziken. Physically defensive Pokemon like Mega Slowbro, Zygarde, Tapu Fini, and Porygon2 aid Dragonite through dealing with various Pokemon that have either the moves, ability, or raw stats to withstand its attacks, like Mega Charizard X, Mega Gyarados, Mega Metagross, Celesteela, and Mega Aggron. In turn, Dragonite helps these Pokemon out by covering their weaknesses to special attackers and stallbreakers like Mew, Magnezone, Kommo-o, Genesect, and Hoopa-U. Meloetta helps Dragonite by handling particular threats to it, like non-Crunch Mega Gyarados, Magearna, Tapu Lele, Choice Specs Greninja, and Mega Slowbro; just be wary that Meloetta needs Calm Mind to handle Gyarados and Slowbro and needs both Calm Mind and Laser focus to handle Magearna. In return, Dragonite aids Meloetta by covering its weaknesses to non-Ice Punch Mega Metagross, Zygarde, Electrium Z Zeraora, and Volcarona.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hurricane is the main move, being boosted by Flyinium Z to gain perfect accuracy and a considerable boost in power for a single turn. Supersonic Skystrike's main utility is for covering Pokemon that resist or are immune to Dragonite's Dragon-type moves, namely slow Tapu Lele, Mega Altaria, and Primarina. Furthermore, since it's a special attack, Counter users like Donphan, Crustle, and Sawk can no longer deflect their damage right back at Dragonite. Fire Blast is an essential move for damaging Steel-types. The main Pokemon hit with Fire Blast are non-Ice Punch Mega Metagross, Magnezone, Aegislash, Genesect, and Ferrothorn. Extreme Speed is an essential priority attack for picking up KOs against weakened Pokemon. The main Pokemon you'll want to have it for are Crustle, Sawk, Carracosta, and Kommo-o in case Dragonite's Z-Move doesn't OHKO them. Ice Beam is a coverage move that aids to win certain matchups more reliably, namely against Substitute users like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Zygarde, though it can also help against opposing Dragonite that lack a Dragon-type Z-Move as well as Mega Altaria. Protect can be used to block Fake Out from Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham in order to maintain Multiscale.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The 156 HP EVs and 36 Special Defense make Dragonite survive a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor from Naganadel and Latios. The 136 Speed EVs let Dragonite outspeed uninvested base 95 Speed Pokemon, namely Tapu Lele and Zygarde, as well as outspeeding specially defensive variants of Kommo-o that would not be 2HKOed by Supersonic Skystrike followed by Extreme Speed. 180 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature maximizes Dragonite's offensive presence, letting it reliably 3HKO bulky non-Ice Punch Mega Metagross with the combination of two Fire Blasts and an Extreme Speed, in addition to 2HKOing non-specially defensive Kommo-o that have been boosted by Clangorous Soulblaze with Supersonic Skystrike followed by Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Dragonite can also run a spread of 160 HP / 108 SpA / 104 SpD / 136 Spe and a Calm Nature in order to live a Choice Specs Greninja's Ice Beam, as well as a Choice Band Outrage from Garchomp.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Special Dragonite is more suited going in against Pokemon that can't or don't usually boost their defenses or heal off any damage, such as Mega Charizard Y, non-Ice Punch Mega Metagross, Zygarde, Landorus-T, and Donphan. This Dragonite set does not have to fear the potential damage deflection from Counter users like Donphan, Crustle, and Sawk, so it can just use its Z-Move right away and pick them off with Extreme Speed. Unfortunately, since Dragonite doesn't possess a viable means of boosting its Special Attack, certain matchups are unfavorable, namely against Z-Conversion Porygon-Z with Recover, Amnesia Mew, and Iapapa Berry Necrozma, as well as losing the potential win against specially defensive Mega Charizard X.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Meloetta is an asset to Dragonite, covering its weaknesses to Porygon-Z, Magearna, faster Tapu Lele, Choice Specs Greninja, and Mega Slowbro. In return, Dragonite aids Meloetta by covering its weaknesses to non-Ice Punch Mega Metagross, Zygarde, Genesect, and Crustle. Mega Tyranitar aids Dragonite by taking on specially defensive Mega Charizard X, Dragonium Z Dragonite, Porygon-Z, Meloetta, and Choice Specs Greninja, while Dragonite backs up Tyranitar by taking care of non-Ice Punch Mega Metagross, Zygarde, Landorus-T, Mega Altaria, and Kommo-o. Physically defensive Zygarde covers Dragonite's weaknesses to Mega Charizard X, Mega Gyarados, Magearna, Ice Punch Mega Metagross, and Metal Sound Aegislash, while Dragonite handles Zygarde's weaknesses to Mega Altaria, Genesect, Kommo-o, Primarina, and Naganadel.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Outrage is Dragonite's main offensive move, blowing back Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Porygon-Z, and Meloetta. Earthquake is necessary in order to 2HKO Magearna. Fire Punch is used to beat Pokemon like Genesect and Mega Scizor. Superpower is an option to most reliably beat Heatran and Mega Tyranitar, while Iron Head can be used to beat Mega Diancie and slow Tapu Lele. Extreme Speed allows Dragonite to beat faster frail Pokemon like Pheromosa, Vivillon, and Smeargle, as well as Volcarona, and to avoid confusion after fatigue from Outrage. Fly can be run in order to beat Mega Heracross.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>152 HP EVs and 4 Defense EVs allow Dragonite to tank Choice Band Garchomp's Outrage as well as survive an Ice Beam from Genesect. The 136 Speed EVs are used to outspeed neutral-natured Magearna. The rest of the EVs are invested into Attack, with an Adamant nature, in order to hit as hard as possible. Multiscale is run in order to take super effective attacks like Ice Beam from Porygon-Z and Hidden Power Ice from Magnezone.</p> <p>Alternatively, one can choose to run a spread of 160 HP / 4 Atk / 208 SpD / 136 Spe in order to also tank Choice Specs Greninja's Ice Beam, alongside still tanking Choice Band Garchomp's Outrage and beating Magearna, but this loses out on the offensive presence that is useful in the Dragonite mirror matchup.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Band Dragonite can be used to lure in and KO Pokemon that normally do well against Dragon-types, like Magearna, Incineroar, and Mega Tyranitar. It is notable that Outrage will always 3HKO bulky Heatran, which removes some of the necessity of running Superpower, although Hidden Power Ice variants may require Superpower anyway to be taken care of. Even though Iron Head hits Togekiss super effectively, Extreme Speed should be used against Choice Scarf variants to 2HKO it while avoiding potential flinches caused by Air Slash. Mega Mawile, although it's weak to Earthquake, should be avoided, as Intimidate will allow it to take an Earthquake and win with Play Rough or Metal Burst followed by Sucker Punch. Choice Band Dragonite can also be used to lure in and beat Choice Scarf variants of Dragonite, as Choice Band-boosted Outrage can OHKO an offensive Dragonite even through Multiscale.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dragonite in general appreciates answers to bulky offensive Steel- and Water-types that can easily take its unboosted attacks, like Mega Metagross, Mega Mawile, Mega Aggron, Primarina, Mega Swampert, and Tapu Fini. This hole can be mostly patched up through the usage of certain Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Celesteela, Magnezone, and Genesect, as well as with Mega Charizard Y, which can utilize both Fire- and Grass-type moves to beat both types. In return, they appreciate Dragonite's positive matchups against each of their mirror matchups, as well as Dragonite's ability to beat threats like Naganadel, Heatran, and Victini. Be wary of Sturdy and Mold Breaker users like Donphan, Golem, Crustle, Mega Gyarados, and Haxorus, which can all tank attacks from Dragonite and knock it out with Counter or their offensive options; to counteract them, bulky Water-types like Primarina, Mega Swampert, Manaphy, Tapu Fini, and your own Mega Gyarados can be run, which all have the capability to bypass most of their respective strategies. Magearna can also be used to beat most of these aforementioned threats with its Double Dance Fairium Z set. In return, for the Water-types, Dragonite can win against Pokemon like Kommo-o, Ferrothorn, and faster threats like Smeargle and Vivillon, which threaten most of these Pokemon, and Dragonite can aid Magearna against Mega Charizard Y, Zygarde, and Heatran.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Outrage is Dragonite's go-to move, being used against Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Garchomp, and non-Dragonium Z Zeraora. Iron Head should be used to beat Fairy-types Choice Scarf Dragonite lures in, like Tapu Lele and Mega Diancie. Earthquake is most useful in beating Pokemon like Aegislash and Magnezone. Fire Punch is used to blow back Steel-types that aren't hit super effectively by Earthquake, like Genesect, Ferrothorn, and offensive Celesteela. Superpower can be run in order to beat Steel-types not threatened by Earthquake like Heatran and Ferrothorn, as well as Mega Tyranitar and Mega Lopunny, depending on the nature of Dragonite. Fly can also be run in order to beat Mega Heracross.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>8 HP and 4 Special Defense EVs allow Dragonite to always survive an Ice Beam from Choice Scarf Greninja. The rest are put into Attack and Speed to maximize Dragonite's offensive presence. This specifically allows a Jolly Dragonite to outspeed Zeraora, as well as common threats like Mega Lopunny, Zeraora, and +1 bulky Mega Charizard X. An Adamant nature can also be run in order to more reliably secure KOs against metagame staples like Aegislash, Greninja, Mega Tyranitar, and bulky Tapu Lele. Multiscale is run in order to tank attacks like Moonblast from Tapu Lele and Outrage from Mega Charizard X.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Dragonite can lure in Pokemon like Greninja, Tapu Lele, Zeraora, and Mega Lopunny, which traditionally have an excellent matchup against Dragonite, and KO them with specific coverage moves. Against Greninja, if you choose to run an Adamant nature, always use Outrage instead of Superpower, as it will OHKO Greninja anyway and also covers the occasional Shadow Sneak + Waterium Z Greninja variants that could avoid damage from Superpower. If Jolly is being run, use Superpower, as Outrage will not OHKO Greninja reliably enough to be worth using to account for Shadow Sneak Waterium Z Greninja. Avoid sending Dragonite out against Zeraora and Mega Lopunny if you are running Adamant, as they will simply outspeed it and win with Fake Out followed by their respective coverage options. If running a Jolly nature, bear in mind that Dragonite will be able to outspeed bulky Mega Charizard X even after a Flame Charge or Dragon Dance and promptly 2HKO it. If you are running Jolly Dragonite and predict your opponent to be running a defensive Normalium Z Porygon-Z variant, use Outrage instead of Superpower, as Superpower has a chance to fail to OHKO in that matchup. However, outside of this specific Dragonite and Porygon-Z scenario, Superpower will always be the correct play. Mega Gardevoir is an interesting matchup; although Dragonite can use Iron Head to hit it super effectively, regular Gardevoir can Trace Multiscale, giving it the opportunity to use Will-O-Wisp and break Multiscale. However, Mega Gardevoir is still not in the clear; it needs to not only avoid two Iron Head flinches but also hit both Will-O-Wisp and Hyper Beam back to back or use Hyper Beam immediately to perhaps get a good roll and OHKO Dragonite. So, in practice, this matchup is not very reliable on either end, with Dragonite only statistically beating Mega Gardevoir about 60% of the time.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dragonite in general appreciates answers to bulky offensive Steel- and Water-types that can easily take its unboosted attacks, like Mega Metagross, Mega Mawile, Mega Aggron, Magearna, Primarina, Mega Swampert, and Tapu Fini. This hole can mostly be patched up through the usage of certain Steel-types of your own, like Ferrothorn, Celesteela, Magnezone, and Genesect, as well as with Mega Charizard Y, which can utilize both Fire- and Grass-type moves to beat both types. In return, they appreciate Dragonite's positive matchups against each of their mirror matchups, as well as Dragonite's ability to beat hyper offensive foes like Mega Lopunny and Zeraora. Stall Pokemon like Mega Slowbro, Type: Null, Kee Berry Mew, Stored Power Necrozma, and Registeel all easily take attacks from Dragonite and quickly overwhelm it defensively. Therefore, stallbreakers like Taunt Mega Gyarados, Fightinium Z Pheromosa, Serperior, and Tapunium Z Tapu Fini can serve as excellent partners. In return, Dragonite can beat Kommo-o, Magnezone, and Tapu Lele, three very common hyper offensive threats that can be run to beat these stallbreaking Pokemon. As Sturdy, Intimidate, and Mold Breaker users, like Donphan, Golem, Crustle, Landorus-T, Incineroar, Mega Gyarados, and Choice Scarf Haxorus, can all tank attacks from Dragonite and knock it out with Counter or their offensive options, bulky Water-types like Primarina, Mega Swampert, Manaphy, Tapu Fini, and your own Mega Gyarados can be run, which all have the capability to bypass most of their respective strategies. Double Dance + Fairium Z Magearna can also be used to beat most of these threats. In return, for the Water-types, Dragonite can win against the aforementioned Tapu Lele and Kartana, which threaten most of these Pokemon, and can aid against Mega Charizard Y and bulky Mega Charizard X for Magearna.</p> "

Its ability to use both Sleep Powder and Leech Seed combined with a great Speed stat allows it to put slower foes to sleep and stall them out. Unfortunately, Jumpluff isn't extremely consistent, as Sleep Powder's somewhat low accuracy even with Wide Lens will occasionally cause it to miss. Additionally, Jumpluff's standard set cannot touch Grass-types at all, meaning it's useless and will almost always lose the matchup. Lastly, multi-hit moves like Rock Blast, priority moves like Ice Shard, and speed control moves like Flame Charge further add to the list of Jumpluff's bad matchups.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>As the combination of Sleep Powder and Leech Seed is Jumpluff's only real niche, other sets with different moves would be gimmicky at best. The most versatile part of Jumpluff is its item slot. Grassium Z combined with Sleep Powder can potentially help it handle Flame Charge users like Mega Charizard X and Y, and Yache Berry could try to avoid Donphan's Ice Shard from doing too much, but these are still very luck-based considering Sleep Powder's accuracy without Wide Lens is reduced and Jumpluff needs very optimal sleep turns. In order to try to avoid losing to sound moves like Uproar and Bug Buzz, Jumpluff can attempt to use a spread with Special Defense investment instead of Defense, especially if your team's matchup versus Pokemon like Golem is solid. Jumpluff can run Infestation instead of Protect to chip down Pokemon that use recovery moves. Jumpluff can run Chlorophyll over Infiltrator so it can try to beat Flame Charge Mega Charizard Y. If you're not worried about missing but would rather have a chance to beat Pokemon that outspeed Jumpluff, Bright Powder is worth considering.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Naturally fast Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Greninja are huge threats and can easily take Jumpluff down, as they are not afraid of being unable to attack it.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Pokemon: Choice Scarf users, conventional or not, can outspeed Jumpluff and easily handle it. Common users are Pokemon like Porygon-Z, Sawk, and Haxorus.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: As Grass-types are immune to Leech Seed and Sleep Powder, they fear nothing from Jumpluff.</p> <p><strong>Strong Sound Moves</strong>: Moves like Mega Gardevoir's Hyper Voice and Genesect's Bug Buzz can easily go through Jumpluff's Substitute and OHKO or 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Recovery: Users of moves like Roost, Soft-Boiled, and Rest can outstall Jumpluff. Rest users in particular are able to gain 100% of their health and control their sleep, and they don't use PP while asleep.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Jumpluff uses only status moves and is forced to use Struggle if it's afflicted by Taunt. It will almost always lose to Taunt users like Mega Gyarados and Tapu Lele.</p> <p><strong>Flame Charge: Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y sometimes run Flame Charge and can break Jumpluff's Substitute, raise their Speed stat, and can then follow it up with a stronger Fire-type move to finish Jumpluff off. However, if Jumpluff runs Chlorophyll, Mega Charizard Y might struggle more.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit Moves</strong>: Golem and Mega Heracross can use a strong Rock Blast to break through Jumpluff's Substitute and continue to damage it.</p> ",

Substitute completely protects Jumpluff from attacks, while Leech Seed allows it to both continuously damage foes while also healing its own HP. Protect also allows Jumpluff to avoid taking damage while not losing HP, however the foe can either set up on your protect or attack through it with a Z-Move.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Wide Lens is optimal for Jumpluff, as it doesn't need any other item, and any boost to Sleep Powder's accuracy is helpful. Infiltrator, while not a particularly useful ability, is better than nothing, and allows Jumpluff to go against Pokemon behind a Substitute. The only EVs on this set that really matter are 252 Speed with a Jolly nature. 20 HP EVs grant Jumpluff with a low HP divisible by 8 for maximum Leech Seed recovery, with the rest in Defense to try to take physical moves like Ice Shard or Rock Blast better.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Jumpluff starts off by using Sleep Powder against the foe to start off the stall. Next it will want to use Substitute to both continue setting up the stall and account for a foe waking up the first turn, which a second-turn Leech Seed wouldn't do. After this, it should set up a Leech Seed. From here, Jumpluff will want to spam Protect and then Substitute to slowly but surely whittle the foe's health down until it eventually faints, assuming all goes well. Avoid taking hits at all cost, as Jumpluff is often unable to take them. If you're expecting a Z-Move, Jumpluff should use Substitute, as a well-timed Z-Move from something like Golem or Tapu Lele can go through Protect.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>When teambuilding with Jumpluff, fast Pokemon will immediately stick out as a threat. Because of this, you will want to be able to handle them, and bulky attackers are especially good at doing this. Z-Move users like Primarina, Donphan, and Tapu Lele are good examples of this. Bulky Mega Evolutions are also good at beating fast threats too, as Mega Metagross or Mega Mawile can beat Choice Scarf users such as Porygon-Z, and other faster threats like Mega Lopunny.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>With a solid defensive typing in Water / Ground, Quagsire has valuable resistances to Fire-, Rock-, Steel-, and Poison-type moves, on top of an Electric-type immunity and only one weakness, albeit a 4x one to Grass-type moves. While 95 / 85 / 65 defenses are on the middling side of decent, especially concerning Special Defense, it's just enough for Quagsire to survive a wide range of physical and special attacks that are not Grass-type, using Z-Stockpile's healing effect to immediately negate any attack that doesn't KO it and boost its defenses. Access to Unaware means that foes like Mega Charizard X and Landorus-T can't use boosting moves of their own to counter Stockpile, leaving them unable to KO Quagsire with an attack. However, Quagsire's average bulk can be taken advantage of by some of the more powerful moves in 1v1, and it can still be easily OHKOed by some of the most common Pokemon in the game, such as Greninja, Tapu Lele, and Porygon-Z. Stockpile can only be used three times as well, meaning moves that drop defenses such as Metal Sound can leave Quagsire vulnerable. Quagsire is also very passive, struggles against opposing stall like stall Deoxys-S and Rest Slowbro, and tends to lose to Taunt from Pokemon like Mega Gyarados and Kommo-o.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Sassy or Relaxed nature with minimized Speed IVs lets Quagsire always underspeed Mega Aggron and Mega Mawile, allowing it to dodge a Metal Burst, but leaves it more vulnerable to Taunt from them. Rest can be run over Recover to beat opposing stall, curing Toxic and potentially PP stalling the opposing Pokemon, but doing so leaves Quagsire unable to recover enough on more powerful offensive threats.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass Moves: Quagsire's 4x weakness to Grass means that Grass coverage is more than capable of OHKOing it easily. Venusaur, Kartana, and Tapu Bulu as well as Solar Beam Mega Charizard Y, Bloom Doom Heatran, and Grass Knot Greninja are all threats to look out for.</p> <p><strong>Extremely Powerful Moves: Quagsire's middling bulk leaves it unable to take the most powerful moves in the metagame, being KOed by Shattered Psyche Tapu Lele, Hyper Beam Mega Gardevoir, Choice Specs Draco Meteor Naganadel, and every Porygon-Z set.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Although Normalium Z ensures Quagsire can get at least one defensive boost, it's simply too passive to pose much of a threat afterwards; Scald is easily outdamaged by most offensive Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker</strong>: Mega Gyarados, Haxorus, and Excadrill can all ignore Unaware to boost their Attack more than Stockpile allows and KO Quagsire.</p> <p><strong>Rest: As Quagsire's primary method of attack is through Toxic, any Pokemon that uses Rest can easily PP stall Quagsire into oblivion.</p> <p><strong>Defense-lowering Moves</strong>: Moves capable of lowering a Pokemon's Defense, such as Metal Sound from Aegislash, can leave Quagsire vulnerable to being knocked out, as Stockpile only boosts three times.</p> ",

        "name": "Stockpile",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stockpile boosts Quagsire's defenses and, when used with Normalium Z, fully heals it at the same time. With Quagsire's low speed, almost every offensive Pokemon will attack first, at which point it can shrug off any hit that doesn't OHKO, fully restore its health, and boost its defenses to ensure that it'll easily take any subsequent attacks. Recover continues to restore health after using Stockpile and is essential, as most physical attackers can continue to do enough damage to threaten Quagsire after one Stockpile, giving Quagsire the longevity it needs to continue to boost its defenses. Toxic is Quagsire's main method of doing damage and taking out the majority of Pokemon. Scald keeps Quagsire from being completely passive and gives it a chance of burning physical attackers, ensuring it will survive physical critical hits and giving it a chance against certain Pokemon such as bulky Taunt Krookodile and Mega Diancie, both of which can prevent Quagsire from using Toxic on them. Alternatively, Earthquake allows Quagsire to hit the Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon that are naturally immune to Toxic, such as Mega Metagross, Magnezone, and Mega Gengar. Additionally, having an attacking move allows Quagsire to not have to resort to Struggle if it is Taunted, and it also lets Quagsire break through Substitute users like Mega Charizard X and Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Normalium Z is essential, as Quagsire needs Z-Stockpile's healing effect to survive more than a single attack against the majority of offensive Pokemon. Unaware allows Quagsire to ignore the stat changes of the foe when taking or dealing damage, although it leaves a vulnerability to moves like Draco Meteor from Naganadel and Fleur Cannon from Magearna, as Quagsire unfortunately ignores the stat dropping effects of these moves as well. Quagsire runs 248 HP EVs and 84 Defense EVs with a Bold or Impish nature in order to avoid an OHKO from Tectonic Rage from Landorus-T. The rest is put into Special Defense to maximize special bulk. Be sure to switch around the natures depending on the type of offensive coverage you are running.</p> <p>An EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with either a Calm or Careful nature sacrifices defensive versatility for better chances against bulky special attackers like Meloetta and non-Grass Knot Greninja, but it still struggles against powerful special attacking threats such as Tapu Lele and Porygon-Z.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>On Team Preview, consider what Pokemon your opponent has that are capable of beating Quagsire. It can easily handle a plethora of bulky offense Pokemon, so if your opponent's team features the likes of Mega Metagross, Dragonite, and Mega Charizard X, Quagsire can shine. When using Quagsire against an offensive threat, your first move should always be to go for Z-Stockpile. As long as Quagsire manages to take the hit, it will completely restore its health and boost its defenses by one stage. After that, boost with Stockpile and heal with Recover accordingly, making sure Quagsire remains out of range of being KOed. After Quagsire has used Stockpile three times and is at high HP, go for Toxic and stall the foe's health away. Use Scald and Earthquake in matchups where Toxic would be ineffectual or where Scald does more damage faster, such as against Landorus-T, Krookodile, and Mega Tyranitar. Against other Toxic users, be sure to preserve Z-Stockpile as long as you can, as it allows Quagsire to survive Toxic for a few turns longer than its foe can. Always remember that Quagsire can lose to an inopportune critical hit, so if you have a more reliable way of taking out the opponent's Pokemon, it may be better to go with that instead.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Teammates capable of beating Grass-types like Venusaur are appreciated, so Flyinium Z Dragonite and Landorus-T make good partners, and Quagsire can take out Pokemon such as Dragonite and Kyurem for them. Tapu Lele beats Venusaur as well as other counters such as Mega Gyarados, Haxorus, and Greninja, while Quagsire can take out some of Tapu Lele's best answers in Mega Metagross and Mega Aggron. Stall beaters such as Mega Gyarados and Zygarde help patch up Quagsire's weakness to opposing stall while letting Quagsire capitalize on the focused sets ran to beat them; however, Quagsire must be wary, as Grass coverage is often used to threaten Mega Gyarados. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Laser Focus Meloetta can also provide an answer to hyper offensive special attackers like Porygon-Z and Mega Gardevoir that threaten Quagsire's poor defenses, and in return, Quagsire can defend Meloetta against Volcarona and Magnezone, which can both effectively take it down.</p> "

Umbreon also has great utility moves like Charm and Moonlight that enable it to take on Mega Gyarados, Mega Charizard X, and Choice Scarf Haxorus. Furthermore, Umbreon can pressure setup Pokemon such as Landorus-T with Foul Play and prevent Tapu Lele from setting up Calm Mind with Snarl. However, Umbreon has trouble facing bulky Pokemon such as Porygon2, Magearna, and Z-Move Togekiss, which are able to take its attacks and stall out of Moonlight's PP. It also suffers against common Leech Seed users such as Serperior, Jumpluff, and Mega Venusaur because of its inability to do major damage to them and its limited recovery with Moonlight. It further suffers against Taunt users such as Deoxys-S, Tapu Fini, and Kommo-o, as it cuts off Umbreon's recovery options and allows them to either stall it out or take it out with their super effective attacks.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Z-Charm makes Umbreon able to beat powerful physical attackers such as Mega Gyarados, Choice Scarf Haxorus, Choice Band Garchomp, and Choice Band Dragonite lacking Superpower. Foul Play enables Umbreon to beat physical attackers such as non-Substitute Landorus-T, Jirachi, and Mega Pinsir. Moonlight allows Umbreon to shake off damage after using Z-Charm on Choice Band Garchomp, Choice Scarf Haxorus, or Mega Charizard X or after using Snarl against Tapu Lele or Primarina. Snarl makes Umbreon able to beat Tapu Lele and Primarina due to the Special Attack drop. Toxic can be used over Snarl to take on walls like Porygon2 and non-Rest Slowbro.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Fairum Z allows Umbreon to use Z-Charm, which allows it to beat Pokemon such as non-Superpower Choice Band Dragonite and Choice Band Garchomp. Inner Focus allows it to avoid flinches from Jirachi's Iron Head and Mega Gyarados's Waterfall. 252 HP EVs and 228 Defense EVs enable Umbreon to take attacks from Garchomp, Zeraora, and Landorus-T as well as two Outrages from non-Superpower Choice Band Dragonite. 28 Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature allow Umbreon to survive Normalium Z-boosted Hyper Beam from bulky Meloetta after Laser Focus as well as tank Moonblast from Primarina and non-Taunt Tapu Lele.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against Mega Metagross, do not use Z-Charm, because it can forgo Mega Evolving to avoid the Attack drop with Clear Body; instead, use Foul Play twice to beat it. Also, do not use Z-Charm against Victini, as Umbreon already OHKOes or 2HKOes Victini with Foul Play, and Victini can't do anything back. Umbreon is a good pick against both Mega Charizard X and Y, as Z-Charm + Foul Play will take care of Mega Charizard X while Snarl + Moonlight will allow Umbreon to stall out sun turns to beat Mega Charizard Y. It can also take on Jirachi due to Inner Focus, and use Foul Play to 2HKO it. For Meloetta, it is best to use Snarl turn 1; if it uses Calm Mind turn 2, use Snarl again, and if it used Laser Focus, use Moonlight turn 3 to be able to recover off Breakneck Blitz. Umbreon should avoid being sent out on most Leech Seed users, with the exception of Whimsicott, and walls such as Mega Venusaur, Serperior, Clefable, Registeel, and Mega Slowbro, as it cannot do enough damage to them to beat them and cannot do major damage back to them. Umbreon can win against Whimsicott only because its Dark typing allows it to avoid Prankster Leech Seed and Taunt.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can take on Fighting-types like Kommo-o and Terrakion such as Tapu Fini and Mega Diancie make good partners for Umbreon. In return, Umbreon can take on Mega Metagross for them. Whimsicott and Mega Sableye are great counters to stall Deoxys-S, which Umbreon is unable to take care of. In return, Umbreon can take on Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Primarina, Fire-types like Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y, and Steel-types like Mega Metagross and Magnezone for Whimsicott. Flying-types like Togekiss and Flyinium Z Landorus-T can help against Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Serperior and Fighting-types that Umbreon can't beat like Kommo-o and Mega Gallade. In return, Umbreon can take on Naganadel and Mega Charizard Y for them. Steel-types such as Magnezone, Mega Metagross, and Mega Mawile are great to beat Fairy-type Pokemon that Umbreon has trouble beating such as Mega Diancie, Mega Gardevoir, and Tapu Fini; in return, Umbreon can take on Mega Charizard Y for them. Electric-type Pokemon that can beat Mega Slowbro like Magnezone and Zeraora make great partners for Umbreon. In return, Umbreon can take care of Ground-type Pokemon for them. Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, Heatran, and Incineroar are great for taking on Steel-types like Registeel and Ferrothorn. Umbreon is able to take on Dragon-types like Haxorus and Garchomp in return.</p> "

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Scizor's brilliant Bug / Steel typing and excellent mixed bulk allow it to handle notable offensive threats in 1v1 including Mega Metagross, Kartana, Magearna, and Meloetta. Access to Iron Defense and reliable recovery in Roost lets it beat most physical setup sweepers that can't 2HKO it, including Swords Dance Mega Mawile and Landorus-T, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and non-Taunt Mega Gyarados. Mega Scizor's moveset also gives it a very high PP count, allowing it to outstall certain defensive Pokemon like non-Hidden Power Fire Mega Venusaur, Mega Aggron, and Porygon2. However, Mega Scizor's glaring 4x weakness to Fire means that it is easily beaten by Fire-type Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran. Furthermore, this weakness is exploited by threats like Kommo-o, Naganadel, Necrozma, and Mew that carry Fire-type coverage. Mega Scizor competes with other tanky Steel-types like Magearna, Mega Metagross, Mega Mawile, and Aegislash, which give up a neutrality to Ground for a reduced weakness to Fire that lets them handle foes with Fire-type coverage more reliably and have greater offensive presence and access to a wider variety of coverage moves. Registeel, in particular, gives Mega Scizor stiff competition as a stall Pokemon. It similarly has a Double Dance set, access to recovery in Rest, and the ability to PP stall defensive Pokemon; however, it also sports superior defensive stats and the ability to hold Leftovers. Mega Scizor should mainly be considered over Registeel for its ability to handle Ground- and Fighting-types in addition to the range of Pokemon that are handled by Steel-types.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance can be used with Bug Bite and an Adamant nature to let Mega Scizor pose an offensive threat, potentially letting it win matchups against Pokemon like Mega Audino, Mega Slowbro, Kee Berry Mew, and Stored Power Necrozma. However, Mega Scizor will lose its ability to check setup sweepers, and it's generally outclassed as a Swords Dance user by the likes of Kartana and Mega Mawile, since they can hit much harder right off the bat. A set with Curse + Laser Focus allows Mega Scizor to reliably break Pokemon that boost their defenses such as Ferrothorn and Bulk Up Adamant Landorus-T. Mega Scizor struggles to find room for both of these moves, however, and using Curse over Iron Defense means that Mega Scizor won't be able to reliably beat Swords Dance users like Landorus-T and Garchomp.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Coverage: Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Volcarona can easily OHKO Mega Scizor with their STAB moves.

        "name": "Stall",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Roost sustains Mega Scizor's health, letting it set up on and beat most offensive Pokemon that can't 2HKO it. Bullet Punch is Mega Scizor's main attacking move, which is boosted by Technician and hits foes like Crustle, Golem, and Mega Gardevoir super effectively. Iron Defense boosts Mega Scizor's Defense to nearly impenetrable levels, letting it wall most physical attackers that can't hit it super effectively, including setup sweepers like Mega Mawile, Landorus-T, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and non-Taunt Mega Gyarados. Struggle Bug lets Mega Scizor actually beat Magearna instead of being setup fodder for it and softens blows from other special attackers like Meloetta and Porygon-Z. Bug Bite is another option that is boosted by Technician and hits Psychic-types like offensive Deoxys-S hard. It also allows Mega Scizor to beat certain Pokemon that avoid the 2HKO from Bullet Punch and can 2HKO it in return like Mega Tyranitar, Choice Specs Greninja, and Mega Medicham.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP and 68 Special Defense EVs ensure that Mega Scizor survives Hydro Cannon from Choice Specs Greninja. The rest of the EVs are placed into Defense with a Relaxed or Impish nature to maximize its physical walling capabilities, nearly guaranteeing that it survives Earthquake followed by Tectonic Rage from Jolly Landorus-T. An Impish nature is used even if Struggle Bug is opted for so that Mega Scizor outspeeds Mega Tyranitar. Scizor should immediately Mega Evolve, so for the most part its pre-Mega ability is irrelevant. However, Light Metal has circumstantial use to avoid giving a useful ability to Trace users like Hidden Power Fire Mega Alakazam.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Scizor matches up well against most non-Fire-type physical attackers such as Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, and non-Taunt Mega Gyarados, as well as common Sturdy users like Crustle, Golem, and Donphan. Be aware that Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Magearna, Dragonite, and Greninja occasionally carry Fire-type coverage, which will allow them to beat Mega Scizor. This may be likely if the opposing team appears to be luring in threats that are weak to Fire-type moves. Rest stallers such as Registeel, Type: Null, and Mega Audino should be avoided, as they will win the PP war against Mega Scizor. Taunt users such as Mega Sableye and Kee Berry Mew can also beat it with ease. Mega Scizor should also watch out for hard-hitting special attackers such as Substitute + Torrent Greninja, Tail Glow Manaphy, and Metal Sound Aegislash and Magnezone, as they tend to overwhelm it. Against Kartana, Mega Scizor should not bother using Iron Defense because Kartana will ignore its Defense boosts with Sacred Sword. Instead, it should use Struggle Bug or Bug Bite twice and then follow up with Bullet Punch, which will nearly always knock out an uninvested Kartana. Against Rock-type Sturdy users like Crustle and Golem, Mega Scizor should initially boost up with Iron Defense and use Struggle Bug until these foes are within KO range of Bullet Punch. Against Greninja, use Roost turn one. If Greninja uses Hydro Cannon, spam Roost until Choice Specs Greninja depletes itself of Hydro Cannon PP or until Life Orb Greninja wears itself down sufficiently from recoil. If Choice Specs Greninja does not use Hydro Cannon, Mega Scizor should use Struggle Bug, as it will 2HKO Greninja if it locks itself into Dark Pulse, and if not then Mega Scizor will comfortably tank any other hit Greninja can throw at it. Note that Greninja is far from a guaranteed matchup, since Mega Scizor will lose to Substitute + Torrent and Hidden Power Fire variants regardless of what it does. Against Zeraora, use Iron Defense first if you predict it to be running a purely physical set. Struggle Bug should be used if you predict it to be running a mixed set, as even if Zeraora uses Charge turn one, a Special Attack drop will nearly guarantee that Mega Scizor survives both Electrium Z-boosted Thunder and Electrium Z-boosted Plasma Fists from it the following turn. Use Roost on turns after Zeraora uses Charge so that Mega Scizor isn't put into KO range from the boosted damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini, Mega Gyarados, and Primarina are excellent teammates, as they can reliably take on Fire-types Mega Charizard X, Heatran, and Mega Gyarados for Mega Scizor; Tapu Fini can also take on Mega Charizard Y if it's running Z-Rain Dance. In return, Mega Scizor deals with Grass-types like Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Serperior and bulky special tanks like Mega Gardevoir and Tapu Lele for them. Dragon-types like Garchomp, Zygarde-C, Kommo-o, and Mega Altaria can also handle Fire-types well, and they appreciate Mega Scizor's ability to deal with Fairy-types such as Magearna, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Mawile, as well as Choice Specs Greninja and Porygon-Z. Mega Tyranitar is another great partner that can deal with both Charizard formes, Heatran, and Pokemon with Fire-type coverage such as Naganadel and Mew. In return, Mega Scizor can take on many of the Fighting-, Steel-, and Ground-types that trouble it like Mega Lopunny, Mega Metagross, and Donphan. Specially offensive Steel-types like Celesteela, Genesect, and Aegislash give Mega Scizor trouble, so Fire-types like Heatran, Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Incineroar are appreciated for their ability to break past them. Heatran can also deal with both Charizard formes for Mega Scizor and wall Pokemon such as Naganadel and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele that use Fire-type coverage to hit Steel-types. In return, Mega Scizor can take care of Ground- and Rock-types that trouble these Pokemon like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Crustle, and Golem. Mega Scizor also tends to struggle with hard-hitting special attackers such as Substitute + Torrent Greninja, Tail Glow Manaphy, and mixed Shell Smash Carracosta, so Pokemon that can deal with them are appreciated. Zeraora can be an effective partner, as it's able to outspeed and beat these Pokemon in addition to many of Mega Scizor's defensive answers such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Slowbro. If it's running Outrage, it can also lure in Dragon-types that trouble Mega Scizor such as Mega Charizard X and Naganadel. In return, Zeraora greatly appreciates Mega Scizor's ability to deal with Ground-types like Landorus-T, Golem, and Donphan. Chansey can handle most non-setup special attackers well and appreciates Mega Scizor's ability to deal with most physical attackers, including Fighting-types like Sawk, in return.</p> "

Its great offensive typing lets it muscle past common threats, including Mega Gyarados and Meloetta. Skill Link, accompanied by multi-hit moves like Pin Missile, Bullet Seed, and Rock Blast, lets Mega Heracross fire off high-Base Power attacks, allowing it to get past most Sturdy users like Donphan and Golem and Substitute users like Jumpluff and Whimsicott. Guts allows Heracross to defeat bulky Will-O-Wisp users, namely Mega Sableye and Kee Berry Mew. With investment in its excellent bulk, Mega Heracross is able to take hits from powerful attackers like Mega Gyarados, Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, and Meloetta and then retaliate with its strong attacks. Unfortunately, its typing leaves it weak to Fire-, Psychic-, and Fairy-type Pokemon such as both Mega Charizard formes, Victini, and Mega Gardevoir, which are prevalent in 1v1. Its 4x weakness to Flying-type attacks can be exploited by Pokemon such as Mega Pinsir, Choice Specs Celesteela, and other Pokemon that occasionally carry Flying-type moves such as Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Archeops. Mega Heracross also cannot use any viable setup options, as its below average Speed will only open the way to it being OHKOed or 2HKOed if it does not attack immediately.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Endure can be used on the offensive set in place of Bullet Seed to take on Mega Charizard Y's Blast Burn, Porygon-Z's Hyper Beam, Mega Gardevoir's Hyper Beam, and Mega Pinsir's Giga Impact; Mega Heracross can then retaliate with its own moves while they recharge. Again, though, this can only really be used as a lure set, as it is very easily played around once revealed. Swords Dance is another option that boosts Mega Heracross's Attack to a very high level, letting it grab guaranteed wins against Curse Mega Aggron and Zygarde. However, Mega Heracross cannot really afford to switch one of its other moves for Swords Dance, as it loses more important matchups than it wins.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fast Fire-types: Both Mega Charizard formes, Mega Blaziken, and Victini outspeed Mega Heracross and can OHKO it with their powerful, super effective Fire-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type attacks: Mega Heracross is 4x weak to Flying-type attacks, and Pokemon carrying such attacks like Dragonite, Choice Specs Celesteela, Togekiss, Vivillon, and Archeops can use this to OHKO it with relative ease.</p> <p><strong>Certain Fairy- and Psychic-types: Though Mega Heracross is more than capable of defeating a decent number of Fairy- and Psychic-types, it still loses to some that either outspeed it or are able to take an attack and KO back like Magearna, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Mawile, Tapu Lele, Mega Altaria, and offensive Mew.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon: Pokemon such as Zygarde, Kommo-o, Necrozma, Bulk Up Zeraora, Zen Headbutt Mega Metagross, and Landorus-T that can boost their Defense to tank hits or naturally tank an attack from Mega Heracross will threaten it, as it is usually going to be outsped and have to tank a hit first before firing off something in return.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Powerful attacking Pokemon equipped with Z-Crystals and Choice items such as Normalium Z Porygon-Z and Choice Band Slaking are able to defeat it with their boosted attacks.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Pin Missile is Mega Heracross's hardest-hitting move, knocking out threats like Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Greninja, Meloetta, and Serperior. Earthquake lets Mega Heracross 2HKO Aegislash and Magnezone. Close Combat is used to hit Steel- and Normal-types that cannot be dispatched with Mega Heracross's other moves, like Ferrothorn, Mega Lopunny, and Choice Band Kartana. Bullet Seed provides coverage against defensive Water-types, which would brush aside Mega Heracross's regular attacks, such as Primarina, Mega Swampert, and non-Tapunium Z Tapu Fini. It is also Mega Heracross's most reliable move against FEAR Pokemon thanks to its flawless accuracy. Rock Blast is used primarily to hit Mega Gyarados before it Mega Evolves, denying it the ability to set up with Dragon Dance, but it can also be used to threaten Bug-types such as Crustle and bulky Volcarona. Rock Tomb is used in order to beat Magnezone. This requires a slightly faster EV spread that can outspeed Magnezone before it can use Electroweb to lower Mega Heracross's Speed. Alternatively, Counter can be used to get past physical attackers that are able to take hits from Mega Heracross, like Choice Band Garchomp and Durant.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP and 212 Special Defense EVs allow Mega Heracross to nearly always survive a Never-Ending Nightmare and Shadow Sneak combination from Aegislash, as well as a Hyper Beam from Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, a Draco Meteor from Naganadel, and a Hydro Cannon from Choice Specs Greninja. The leftover EVs are put into Attack alongside an Adamant nature, allowing Mega Heracross to hit as hard as possible. With Guts as the pre-Mega ability, Heracross can potentially take on status users like non-Iron Defense Will-O-Wisp Mew. Skill Link boosts all of Mega Heracross's multi-hit moves by making them always hit five times, thus increasing the power of its moves.</p> <p>If this set is running Rock Tomb to beat Magnezone, Mega Heracross will need to run a spread of 208 HP / 100 Atk / 144 SpD / 56 Spe and a Careful nature to allow Heracross to outspeed Modest Magnezone and break its Sturdy with Rock Tomb before Mega Evolving. This spread also allows Heracross to take a possible Gigavolt Havoc and maintains important matchups against Pokemon like Aegislash. This EV spread will unfortunately cost Mega Heracross some Attack, however. Mega Heracross can run an offensive set with a spread of 244 Atk / 48 SpD / 216 Spe and an Adamant nature to beat out specific threats such as Hoopa-U, Genesect, Heatran, and Zapdos, as well as having a chance to KO slow Dragonite.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against Mega Gyarados, always use Rock Blast turn one, as this will hit it hard if it doesn't Mega Evolve and get it in range of a Bullet Seed or another Rock Blast for the next turn. If they Mega Evolve turn one to avoid the super effective Rock Blast, Pin Missile, Close Combat, or Bullet Seed can be used to pick them off next turn. Against Primarina, use Earthquake turn one to avoid putting it in range of Torrent, and then follow up with a Bullet Seed turn two. Beware of the rarer Encore Primarina, which can lock Mega Heracross into Earthquake and proceed to knock it out with a Torrent-boosted Z-Move. If you choose to run Rock Tomb for Magnezone, assuming you are running the correct EV spread, do not Mega Evolve, as Heracross will naturally outspeed Modest Magnezone and be able to break its Sturdy, survive Gigavolt Havoc, maintain the higher Speed stat, and finish it off with Earthquake afterwards. Earthquake will also OHKO uninvested Zeraora; however, Bulk Up variants will still beat Mega Heracross. Against Will-O-Wisp users like Kee Berry Mew and Mega Sableye, do not Mega Evolve; instead, stay in base forme to gain an Attack boost, if they choose to use Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Tyranitar makes a good teammate for Mega Heracross with its capability of taking on both Mega Charizard formes, Mega Pinsir, and Heatran, while Mega Heracross can handle Mega Lopunny, Donphan, Golem, and Sawk in return. Certain Fire-types like Heatran and Mega Charizard Y also work very well with Mega Heracross, as they can counter strong Fire-, Psychic-, and Fairy-type Pokemon and bulkier offensive threats that threaten Mega Heracross. They can both take on Mega Metagross, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Altaria, Tapu Lele, Magearna, and offensive Mew, whereas Heatran has the edge over threats like both Mega Charizard formes, specially offensive Dragonite, and Clefable. Mega Charizard Y can better handle Normalium Z Porygon-Z and Landorus-T. In return, Heatran and Mega Charizard X appreciate the help Mega Heracross gives against powerful Water-types such as Greninja, Mega Gyarados, Mega Swampert, and Primarina as well as general offensive threats like Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, and Sawk. Bulky Water-types like Primarina and Tapu Fini are also useful, as they can beat most Fire-types like both Mega Charizard formes, Heatran, and Mega Blaziken while enjoying Mega Heracross's positive matchup against Magnezone and Grass-types like Serperior. Mega Heracross also appreciates Pokemon that can threaten Flying-types like Dragonite and Choice Specs Celesteela, such as Zeraora, specially defensive Mega Charizard X, Mega Metagross, and Mega Sableye. In exchange, Mega Heracross can deal with bothersome Ground-types that threaten the former two, primarily Donphan and Golem, and Primarina for all but Zeraora.</p> "

  "Donphan": {
    "overview": "<p>Donphan is an excellent physical bulky offensive presence in the 1v1 metagame with powerful moves, good offensive stats, decent bulk, and an invaluable ability in Sturdy. Donphan's wide movepool with access to Ground- and Rock-type moves allows it to hit the entire tier for at least neutral damage, if not super effective. With Ice Shard, Donphan has a consistent priority move to finish off faster Pokemon. However, it faces stiff competition from other Rockium Z Sturdy users such as Crustle, Carracosta, and Golem. It also struggles with bulky offensive Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados and Mew. With no way of boosting its stats reliably, Donphan is vulnerable to setup stallers or even just naturally bulky Pokemon, such as Chansey and Porygon2.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Groundium Z can be replaced with Rockium Z for guaranteed accuracy and a harder-hitting Rock-type move, but the power of STAB Tectonic Rage is sorely missed. On the main Groundium Z set, Head Smash and Counter can be replaced with Endeavor and Substitute to potentially lure Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados and Kommo-o. Using Endeavor immediately can be effective to bait attackers to which Donphan cannot normally retaliate. However, if they do not attack turn one, use Substitute repeatedly until Donphan is at 1 HP followed by Endeavor and Ice Shard to defeat any Pokemon that does not carry a priority move. This gives Donphan the potential to outplay Pokemon that it would normally not stand a chance against.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Pokemon that Ignore Sturdy: Mold Breaker users, such as Mega Gyarados and Magnet Rise Excadrill, can break through Donphan's Sturdy. Necrozma can also OHKO Donphan thanks to Photon Geyser ignoring opposing abilities. Pokemon with Skill Link, like Cloyster and Mega Heracross, can also aptly deal with Donphan.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon: Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Zygarde are naturally bulky, so despite having a 4x weakness to Ice Shard, they are still able to defeat standard Donphan. Pokemon like Magearna and Tapu Lele can boost their defenses to defeat Donphan, however, they must be wary of lure sets.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon: Pokemon that can utilize Magnet Rise, such as Aegislash and Excadrill, are usually good checks to Donphan. Air Balloon users, such as Heatran, usually handle Donphan well too. However, these can be lured in and defeated using Choice Band-boosted Superpower, excluding Aegislash. Some Flying-type Pokemon, such as Celesteela, are also able to easily tank any of Donphan's attacks and defeat it.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Special Dragonite with Extreme Speed can safely beat Donphan. Primarina can defeat standard Donphan with Aqua Jet; however, it can be lured and taken out with Choice Band-boosted Gunk Shot.</p> <p><strong>Stall Pokemon: As Donphan is unable to raise its offenses, Pokemon such as Mega Sableye and Kee Berry Mew are able to set up without worry and whittle Donphan down with Will-O-Wisp, while others like Mega Venusaur and Mega Slowbro can PP stall Donphan or beat it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Water- and Grass-type Pokemon: Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu and Tapu Fini have a type advantage over Donphan, although they must watch out for Choice Band-boosted Gunk Shot.</p> ",

        "name": "Groundium Z",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Donphan's strongest STAB move and, when combined with Groundium Z, allows it to OHKO most hyper offensive Pokemon that do not resist it, such as Kartana and Mega Lopunny. Ice Shard allows Donphan to pick off any weakened Pokemon that Tectonic Rage fails to OHKO. Its +1 priority also allows it to gain the upper hand against some faster foes like Jumpluff and Garchomp. Head Smash lets Donphan hit Flying-types for super effective damage. It is also Donphan's most powerful attack against Pokemon that resist Earthquake; however, the recoil negates Donphan's Sturdy. Stone Edge can be used instead to preserve Donphan's Sturdy at the cost of power. Counter is used to defeat most physical Pokemon, mainly Choice item users such as Haxorus, Sawk, and Landorus-T. Bulldoze is another option to slow down foes, in particular Magearna. Rock Tomb can also be used to beat slow Mega Charizard X and Y.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Attack investment ensures that Donphan can hit as hard as possible while maintaining its bulk to tank physical hits. The rest of the EVs are put into Speed to outspeed other uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon. Groundium Z allows Donphan to use Tectonic Rage to hit harder than it can with any other item. Sturdy ensures that Donphan will always be left with at least 1 HP if hit from full HP, allowing it to retaliate with powerful moves.</p> <p>If you choose to run Bulldoze, run maximum Attack and Speed with an Adamant nature, alongside 0 HP IVs, which allows you to beat Magearna.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Donphan is very good against frail hyper offensive Pokemon such as Hoopa-U, Mega Lopunny, and Greninja, thanks to its Sturdy ability. Donphan is able to deal with most other Sturdy Pokemon like Magnezone, Golem, Crustle, Aggron, and Sawk, as Donphan can use its powerful Tectonic Rage to bring them to Sturdy and then use Ice Shard. If you're running Bulldoze to beat Magearna, use Bulldoze turn one, followed by an Earthquake if they used Iron Defense previously. This will get them in range of Tectonic Rage, even if they use Pain Split.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Donphan is weak to physically bulky Pokemon such as Zygarde-C, Mega Slowbro, and Kommo-o, so having a special wallbreaker such as Psychium Z Mew or Normalium Z Porygon-Z is recommended. In return, Donphan can deal with Pokemon such as Greninja and Mega Lopunny that pose a threat to them. Mega Metagross and bulky Mega Charizard Y can deal with common Water- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, Tapu Fini, and Tapu Bulu, which Donphan struggles with. Donphan also helps against Fire- and Rock-type Pokemon that bother them, such as Mega Charizard X and Golem. As Donphan struggles against Pokemon that can raise their defenses like fast Iron Defense Magearna and Deoxys-S, wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard X and Aegislash are appreciated. Donphan remedies their weakness to Pokemon like Golem and Greninja.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Donphan's go-to STAB move, which can take out common Steel-types such as Magearna, Metagross, and Aegislash. It also beats most grounded Fire-, Electric-, and Poison-types, such as Mega Blaziken, Zeraora, and Naganadel. Head Smash deals with Flying-types, particularly Mega Charizard X and Y. Stone Edge is another, weaker option to avoid recoil. Ice Shard gives Donphan a priority move and helps it against some Dragon- and Ground-types, such as Garchomp and Landorus-T. Gunk Shot decimates Fairy-type Pokemon such as Primarina and deals more damage to Grass-types than Fire Fang does, which is useful against Pokemon such as Whimsicott and Tapu Bulu. Fire Fang is another option that can be used over Ice Shard or Gunk Shot, allowing Donphan to hit certain Steel-types harder, such as bulky Genesect and Mega Scizor. Other coverage moves such as Play Rough for Kommo-o, Superpower for Air Balloon Heatran, Seed Bomb for Mega Swampert, and Bounce for Mega Heracross can be considered.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment gives Donphan the best opportunity to deal with threats, as it lets it hit hard and fast. Donphan doesn't need HP investment, as Sturdy lets it survive any hit anyway. The leftover EVs are put into Defense, with HP IVs foregone entirely to keep Donphan's HP as low as possible so that Magearna does not regain much HP through Pain Split. Choice Band lets Donphan hit extremely hard with a variety of different moves; however, it locks Donphan into one move, which leaves it vulnerable to anti-Choice item strategies and makes Donphan unable to use Ice Shard to finish off opposing Pokemon if another move has been selected.</p> <p>The EV spread can be altered to 128 HP / 160 Atk / 220 Def with an Adamant nature in order to successfully tank a physical Supersonic Skystrike and Extreme Speed from maximum Attack Adamant Dragonite, its most common set, while ensuring a 2HKO with 2 Ice Shards. This also allows it to beat Choice Item variants of Dragonite.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>While Choice Band allows Donphan to hit harder, it has the drawback of not allowing Donphan to switch its moves, losing the matchup against Pokemon such as Sawk and Golem running Counter. This set is a lure set, so send Donphan in against Pokemon that lose to its coverage moves but usually win against its standard Groundium Z set, such as Primarina and Landorus-T. With Choice Band and no HP investment, Donphan has a very good chance at defeating fast Iron Defense Magearna, which can catch opponents off-guard. Do not send it in against Substitute + Flail Mega Lopunny, as Donphan will not be able to KO Mega Lopunny and will be defeated by Fake Out and Flail.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As Donphan is able to lure Fairy-type Pokemon such as Primarina and Magearna, Pokemon that are weak to Fairy-type moves such as Mega Gyarados and Kommo-o are good partners. Those also help to cover threats that Donphan would be unable to cover, such as Dragonite and Mega Gyarados. Donphan needs partners that can take out physical walls such as Mega Slowbro and Zygarde-C, so Pokemon such as Greninja and Mega Gardevoir pair well with it. In return, Donphan deals with the physically offensive Pokemon that these Pokemon struggle with, such as Mega Charizard X, as well as Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Magearna.</p> "

However, Porygon2 can be taken down by Pokemon like Sawk and Mega Lopunny because of their high Attack stats and super effective STAB moves. It also has a hard time against strong special attackers with boosting moves like Mega Gardevoir and Magearna, as they are able to tank Porygon2's attacks and OHKO it with their STAB moves after setting up. Furthermore, Porygon2 struggles against Taunt users like Tapu Fini, Mew, and Deoxys-S, as they cut off its recovery, making it easier to knock out or outlast. Porygon2 also has trouble with bulky Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Mega Sableye because of their immunity to Toxic and ability to outstall it.</p> ",

Hidden Power Fire can be used to help beat Steel-types like Ferrothorn, but Porygon2 will have to give up either its BoltBeam coverage or Toxic. A moveset consisting of Curse / Conversion / Recover / Return can be used in order for Porygon2 to have a better chance against physical attackers like Incineroar, as well as being able to convert into a Ghost-type to deliver the Ghost-type version of Curse after Porygon2 has set up with the regular version of Curse. Charge Beam can be used over Thunderbolt to enable Porygon2 to take on Amnesia users like Mega Slowbro; however, Porygon2 will be unable to take on other Water-types like Mega Gyarados.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types like Sawk, Terrakion, Kommo-o, Mega Medicham, Mega Lucario, and Mega Lopunny give Porygon2 trouble, as all of these Pokemon outpace it and can either OHKO or 2HKO it.

Thunderbolt is good to use against Water-types like Mega Gyarados and Carracosta. Ice Beam allows Porygon2 to take care of Ground- and Dragon-types like Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Zygarde. Foul Play is a great way to deal with Pokemon with high Attack like Mega Metagross and Jirachi along with setup sweepers like Mega Charizard X and Mega Pinsir. Toxic can be used over Foul Play to deal with bulky Pokemon like non-Rest Mega Slowbro, Z-Thunder Wave Togekiss, and Kyurem. Psywave can be used to hit Special Defense-boosting Pokemon like Tapu Fini, Clefable, Audino, and Ferrothorn harder.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment and 172 EVs in Defense coupled with a Bold nature help Porygon2 take Z-Moves such as Dragonite's  Outrage-based Devastating Drake. This also helps Porygon2 take physical attacks from the likes of Mega Metagross, Victini, Garchomp, and mixed Zeraora. A Bold nature is used over Relaxed in order to outpace Encore Primarina and Taunt Mega Mawile. 84 Special Defense EVs allow Porygon2 to avoid the 2HKO of Dragonite's Draco Meteor-based Devastating Drake into Draco Meteor.

Porygon2 has a solid matchup against common Choice Scarf users like Haxorus and non-Trick Porygon-Z, as it can tank their attacks and finish them off with Ice Beam. Moreover, try not to send Porygon2 out against walls like Ferrothorn and Chansey, as Ferrothorn is too difficult to knock out due to Leech Seed its access to and its immunity to Toxic, and Chansey will win by using its own Toxic and outdamaging Porygon2 with Seismic Toss. Be sure to avoid using Porygon2 around Taunt users that it cannot quickly KO like Guardian of Alola Tapu Fini, Incineroar, Mega Tyranitar, Deoxys-S, and Kee Berry Mew, as this will prohibit the use of Recover and make it unable to take care of them.

Dragon-types like Haxorus, Garchomp, and Mega Charizard X can set up on them or take care of walls like Ferrothorn with their STAB attacks, while Porygon2 can take on Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Mega Gyarados for them.

However, its subpar defensive stats result in it losing to any Pokemon faster than it due to it getting OHKOed or hit with Taunt. A fairly low base Speed stat of 75 leaves Smeargle outsped by common threats like Mega Lopunny, Mega Charizard X and Y, and Greninja. Smeargle relies heavily on sleep turns, as it can't beat any Pokemon that wakes up before it sets up Imprison and transforms.</p> ",

They can be handled with Lovely Kiss, though.</p> <p><strong>Z-Move Users</strong>: Z-Moves can be used in spite of Imprison, so if you do not use Substitute, Pokemon like Dragonium Z Dragonite and Ghostium Z Aegislash can OHKO a Transformed Smeargle with super effective attacks.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With the use of Spore, Smeargle increases its chances of being able to use Imprison + Transform while taking minimal damage. Imprison prevents the foe from using moves it shares with Smeargle; when paired with Transform, this won't let the foe use any of its moves. The fourth moveslot is pretty flexible. King's Shield can help Smeargle take a physical hit it otherwise wouldn't before putting the opponent to sleep. Magic Coat can help Smeargle out by bouncing Taunt and other status moves back to the user. Usually, you would use Magic Coat if you are running Quick Claw. Lovely Kiss can help with Spore's problem of not being able to put Grass-types to sleep. Substitute can help Smeargle get enough sleep turns and allow it to take a hit from behind the Substitute to put the foe to sleep once more. It also allows Smeargle to evade a super effective Z-Move from Pokemon such as bulky Dragonium Z Dragonite and Ghostium Z Aegislash after using Transform.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Running 252 Speed EVs with a Speed-boosting nature makes Smeargle outspeed as many Pokemon as possible. Speed is Smeargle's only useful stat, as it relies on Speed to win. 252 HP EVs make Smeargle slightly better at taking hits, and the EVs aren't useful elsewhere. After Transform, Smeargle copies the opposing Pokemon's stats besides HP, which it retains. Mental Herb can help Smeargle put Taunt users to sleep. Quick Claw is also an option, as it can let Smeargle steal away games with its 20% chance of letting Smeargle use a sleep-inducing move before an otherwise faster foe can move. Sitrus Berry can restore HP lost from Struggle recoil and heal Smeargle using Substitute.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Smeargle only if you suspect that your opponent will bring a slower tank or wall. When you send out Smeargle, you should always use Spore first unless you expect a physical hit from a faster foe, in which case you can use King's Shield, or if you're facing a Grass-type, which is immune to Spore. After using Spore on the opposing Pokemon, use Imprison and then Transform to force it to use Struggle.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon like Pheromosa and Zeraora benefit from Smeargle's ability to scare off bulkier builds, while Smeargle appreciates their Speed stats against faster teams. The opponent will hesitate to use bulky Pokemon against a Smeargle team, so Pokemon that enjoy having these walls not picked like Mega Lopunny and Donphan make good team options. Smeargle can deal with slow, bulky, powerful Pokemon like Mega Mawile, which benefits hyper offensive teams unable to OHKO these Pokemon.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Mega Tyranitar is a slow, bulky offensive Pokemon that is capable of tanking powerful super effective moves from Pokemon like Genesect, Magnezone, and Heatran and KOing them back. It has one of the highest Attack stats available in the 1v1 metagame, with access to useful STAB moves in Rock Tomb and Crunch, coverage moves like Fire Punch, Superpower, and Earthquake, and utility moves like Dragon Dance and Taunt, which allow it to take on a large number of Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Dragonite, Genesect, Greninja, Mega Slowbro, and Heatran. Good bulk and a fantastic ability in Sand Stream, which raises its Special Defense by 50%, allow it to tank a number of strong attacks with appropriate defensive investment, Mega Tyranitar can tank two Outrages from Mega Charizard X, a Bug Buzz from Download-boosted Choice Specs Genesect, and a Hydro Cannon from Choice Specs Greninja. Its typing also gives it the upper hand versus Fire-, Normal-, and Ghost-types like Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Porygon-Z, and Mega Gengar and gives it an immunity to Psychic-type moves from Pokemon like Necrozma. However, Rock is a weak defensive typing, and Mega Tyranitar has difficulty getting around stall because it has to give up arguably more valuable coverage moves for Taunt in order to do so. Mega Tyranitar is also a slow Pokemon, and this presents major drawbacks in its usage. It also has weaknesses to common attacking types in the 1v1 metagame, such as Fighting, Ground, Water, and Grass. As a result, it gets countered by the likes of Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, Mega Gyarados, and Kartana.</p> ",

Dragon Dance can be run in order to boost Mega Tyranitar's Attack and Speed with one move, but this comes at the cost of not dealing immediate damage to your the opposing Pokemon, unlike Rock Tomb.

However, Stone Edge from Mega Tyranitar has a good chance of beating Primarina.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-type Pokemon like Mega Mawile and Mega Metagross are able to KO Mega Tyranitar with their strong STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-type Pokemon are ubiquitous in the 1v1 metagame, and all of them, such as Donphan, Landorus-T, Golem, Zygarde, and Garchomp, can easily take out Mega Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Mega Tyranitar is vulnerable to physically defensive Pokemon like Mega Venusaur, Mega Sableye, Mega Aggron, and Pyukumuku, which are able to survive Mega Tyranitar’s attacks and PP stall it or defeat it with Leech Seed or Toxic.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rock Tomb slows down faster foes like Dragonite and Magnezone, allowing Mega Tyranitar to move first and KO them afterwards. Also, Rock Tomb's high accuracy means it is more reliable compared to Tyranitar's other Rock-type STAB moves. Fire Punch helps defeat Steel-type Pokemon like Genesect, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela. Earthquake is used to KO some Steel-types like Magnezone and Heatran. Taunt is also an option against stall Pokemon like Jumpluff, Deoxys-S, and Type: Null. Superpower allows Mega Tyranitar to defeat certain some Normal- and Dark-type Pokemon like Porygon-Z and opposing Mega Tyranitar, while Crunch could be used as another STAB move to defeat Psychic-type Pokemon like Meloetta.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP and 72 Defense EVs allow Mega Tyranitar to two Outrages from maximum Attack Mega Charizard X. 56 Special Defense EVs alongside the Special Defense boost from Sand Stream help it to tank a Bug Buzz from Download-boosted Choice Specs Genesect and a Hydro Cannon from Choice Specs Greninja. The remaining 132 EVs are put into Attack, which, when coupled with an Adamant nature, helps Mega Tyranitar KO Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Magnezone, Genesect, and Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against pre-Mega Charizard, you don't need to predict whether you're facing the X or Y mega variant; if it is Mega Charizard Y, Rock Tomb KOes it, and if it is Mega Charizard X, a follow-up Earthquake will usually KO it. When matched up against Choice Specs Greninja, start off with Fire Punch. If Greninja uses Hydro Cannon, you can knock it out the next turn with Earthquake, but if Greninja used Grass Knot, Fire Punch along with Sandstorm usually OHKOes it. Against Magnezone, always use Rock Tomb followed by Earthquake, since Magnezone has Sturdy as its ability. Against stall Pokemon like Jumpluff, Deoxys-S, and Mega Slowbro, Mega Evolve Tyranitar after five turns to maximize sand damage. If you have Taunt, always start off by using Taunt against Jumpluff and Type: Null, but against Deoxys-S, start off by using Rock Tomb, and after four uses of Rock Tomb, use Taunt. At this point, Mega Tyranitar outspeeds Deoxys-S and can force it to Struggle with Taunt. When up against Slowbro, if Tyranitar has Crunch and Taunt, use Crunch on the first turn. If Slowbro was Mega Evolved, use Taunt to block its recovery, but if Slowbro was not, use Crunch again, since Slowbro's ability Oblivious blocks Taunt.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since Mega Tyranitar is weak to Ground-type attacks from Pokemon like Garchomp, Landorus-T, Donphan, and Golem, bulky Pokemon like Mega Heracross and fast Pokemon like Mega Gyarados can be paired to counter said threats. These Pokemon can take advantage of Mega Tyranitar's ability to KO their common counters like bulky Mega Charizard Y. Since Fighting-type Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, Mega Blaziken, and Mega Heracross can KO Mega Tyranitar easily, Fairy-type Pokemon like Magearna and Primarina fare well as teammates. In this case, Primarina is the better option, since it can additionally be used to KO Sturdy users and lure Magnezone for Mega Tyranitar to defeat. Since Mega Tyranitar is vulnerable to physically defensive Pokemon like Mega Venusaur, Mega Sableye, Mega Aggron, and Pyukumuku, stallbreakers like Mega Charizard Y and Mega Gardevoir are solid team options. Since Mega Tyranitar is weak to bulky Water-type Pokemon like Mega Gyarados, Primarina, Mega Swampert, and Tapu Fini, bulky Grass-type Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn can be used. In turn, these Pokemon appreciate Mega Tyranitar taking care of their Fire- and Flying-type weaknesses.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Mega Blaziken has a great Attack stat and the access to Speed Boost, enabling it to outpace Pokemon like Mega Metagross and Mega Lopunny. Thanks to its Fire / Fighting typing, it can take care of many Steel- and Grass-types like Magearna, Genesect, Heatran, and Serperior and bulky Pokemon like Porygon2 and Type: Null with High Jump Kick. However, Mega Blaziken struggles with walls like Mega Slowbro and Clefable, which are able to tank it's hits thanks to their massive bulk. Mega Blaziken also suffers against bulky Water- and Ground-types like Tapu Fini, Mega Gyarados, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Zygarde-C because they can survive Mega Blaziken's attacks and OHKO it with their super effective moves. Mega Blaziken has to rely on Protect to get a Speed boost. This allows Substitute users like Torrent Greninja to play mind games and use Substitute on the Protect turn to win the matchup.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Substitute + Reversal set can be used to take down Pokemon like offensive Zeraora and Mega Metagross more easily.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective STAB: Water-, Ground-, and Flying-types like Mega Gyarados, Mega Slowbro, Tapu Fini, Primarina, Togekiss, Landorus-T, Zygarde-C, and Garchomp avoid the OHKO from Mega Blaziken and can defeat it with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy and Multiscale Users: Pokemon with Sturdy and Multiscale such as Golem, Donphan, Mega Aggron, and Dragonite can survive a hit from Mega Blaziken and take care of it with a move like Tectonic Rage, Metal Burst, or Supersonic Skystrike.</p> <p><strong>Walls: Walls like Mega Slowbro, Clefable, and Charm or Sleep Powder Mega Venusaur give Mega Blaziken trouble because of their massive bulk that enables them to slowly chip away at Mega Blaziken and eventually defeat it.</p> ",

        "name": "Speed Boost",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Protect allows Mega Blaziken to safely get a Speed boost against faster threats like Mega Lopunny, Choice Specs Greninja, and Mega Gengar, and also can be used to scout the set the foe is using to see if setting up with Bulk Up or using Will-O-Wisp is better than attacking. Flare Blitz allows Mega Blaziken to take care of Steel- and Grass-types like Genesect, Ferrothorn, and Serperior. High Jump Kick enables it to combat Normal-, Rock-, and Dark-types such as Mega Lopunny, Porygon2, and Mega Tyranitar. Bulk Up allows Mega Blaziken to take care of bulky Pokemon like Mega Metagross, Porygon2, and Mega Sableye more easily. Will-O-Wisp enables it to beat Mega Metagross and Mega Mawile, as well as Sturdy users like Rockium Z Aggron and FEAR Pokemon like Aron, breaking their respective strategies. Substitute combined with Protect can be used to play mind games with foes that normally threaten to OHKO Mega Blaziken that have negative repercussions with their main STAB moves, and it can help deal with Zeraora and Naganadel. Thunder Punch can be run with Bulk Up to give Mega Blaziken the chance to beat Mega Gyarados, as most Gyarados will not Mega Evolve out of fear of High Jump Kick.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs and 92 Special Defense EVs allow Mega Blaziken to be able to tank Mega Charizard X's Outrage, Mega Charizard Y's Air Slash, and Magearna's Twinkle Tackle. 140 Speed EVs allow Mega Blaziken to outspeed Mega Lopunny after one Speed boost. The rest of the EVs go into Attack to make Mega Blaziken able to beat maximum HP Mega Charizard X and bulky Mega Charizard Y. Using Blaze as base Blaziken's base ability allows it to not give Speed Boost to Trace users like Mega Gardevoir.</p> <p>There are several additional ways to EV Mega Blaziken, all taking advantage of the difference in Speed gained through its ability. Running 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe and an Adamant Nature will let Mega Blaziken outspeed and OHKO non-Timid Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Haxorus, and bulky Mega Gardevoir after using Protect. However, running a more offensive spread will lose  reliability against both Mega Charizards. Additionaly, either 252 HP / 64 Atk / 176 SpD / 16 Spe with a Jolly Nature or 252 HP / 24 Atk / 168 SpD / 64 Spe with a Careful nature can be run in order to increase Mega Blaziken's Special Defense in exchange for power and Speed. The former can outspeed Mega Gengar after Protect and tank Naganadel's Draco Meteor, avoiding the need to run Substitute, but will lose some reliability with Magearna without Substitute. The latter can be run to avoid mind games with Magnezone, tanking a Gigavolt Havoc, alongside improving the overall Meloetta matchup, but its further loss in Speed and power lets it lose to more niche threats, like Mega Gengar and Choice Scarf Diggersby, alongside the previously weak Magearna matchup. For more physically defensive spreads, a spread of 128 HP / 80 Atk / 236 Def / 64 Spe with an Adamant Nature allows Mega Blaziken to tank Haxorus after Protect and Bulk Up, and Fake Out into Gigavolt Havoc from physical Zeraora, but will specifically lose reliability against Mega Charizard Y. Finally, if you choose to run Will-O-Wisp, 192 HP / 48 Atk / 252 Def / 16 Spe and a Jolly Nature can be run to tank a Tectonic Rage into Sucker Punch from burnt Golem and a burnt Continental Crush from Crustle after Shell Smash, while naturally tanking threats like Mega Lopunny and outspeeding Mega Gengar after one turn, but will sacrifice matchups against with Mega Charizard Y, alongside Magearna and Naganadel.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Blaziken can be picked against either Mega Charizard Y or X. Use High Jump Kick on the first turn, as neither forme can OHKO Mega Blaziken. Against Mega Charizard X, use High Jump Kick again to finish it off. If Mega Charizard X uses Flame Charge against Mega Blaziken, use Protect the next turn, giving it another Speed boost and making sure it avoids being KOed by a faster Outrage before Mega Blaziken follows up with High Jump Kick. Be wary of offensive Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X variants, as they can potentially outplay Mega Blaziken if it boosts while Mega Blaziken uses Protect. However, against Mega Charizard Y, Flare Blitz will do more damage in the sun and cannot miss, so use it to take care of Mega Charizard Y. Against Magearna, if you're running a Mega Blaziken spread with low Attack investment, use High Jump Kick to be sure that Mega Blaziken can tank the Twinkle Tackle and then KO it with Flare Blitz. Against Mega Mawile, be sure to use Bulk Up or Will-O-Wisp first because of the Attack drop from Intimidate. If using Substitute, be sure to use it on Naganadel after Protect in order to beat it, if they used Draco Meteor turn one. If running the alternative EVs of 252 HP / 64 Atk / 176 SpD / 16 Spe with a Jolly nature and facing Mega Gardevoir, Mega Evolve and use Protect on the first turn. On turn two, use Bulk Up so Mega Blaziken does not get OHKOed by Psyshock. Against Naganadel, use High Jump Kick twice to finish it off. If you are running the 128 HP / 80 Atk / 236 Def / 64 Spe EVs, use High Jump Kick turn one against Zeraora, using Protect turn two if they don't Fake Out and continuing to use High Jump Kick if they do. Against Haxorus, simply use Protect, Bulk Up, and High Jump Kick on turns one, two, and three, which will tank and knock out any set.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Blaziken appreciates Pokemon that can take care of Water-types like Tapu Fini and Mega Slowbro, so Electric- and Grass-types like Magnezone, Zeraora, Mega Venusaur, and Tapu Bulu are geat partners. In return, Mega Blaziken can threaten Pokemon like Mega Charizard X and Y and Mega Metagross for them. Mega Blaziken struggles against Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp, so Pokemon that can threaten them like Greninja, Tapu Fini, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele make for good partners. In return, Mega Blaziken can take care of Steel-types like Choice Scarf Genesect and Magearna. Multiscale and Sturdy users like Dragonite and Magnezone pair well with Mega Blaziken because of their ability to take on Meloetta and Victini. In return, Mega Blaziken can take care of troublesome Pokemon like Mega Charizard X and Mega Metagross. Wallbreakers like Kommo-o, Porygon-Z, and Magearna can defeat Pokemon like Zygarde-C and Mega Gyarados. In return, Mega Blaziken can threaten Mega Metagross for them. Walls like Mega Slowbro and Mega Sableye help with Dragon-, Ground-, and Steel-types like Choice Scarf Haxorus, Naganadel, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. In return, Mega Blaziken can take care of wallbreakers like Normalium Z  Porygon-Z and bulky Zeraora.</p> "

  "Swampert": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Swampert possesses one of the best defensive typings in the game in Water / Ground, with resistances to Fire, Rock, and Steel and a critical immunity to Electric-type moves, the bane of most Water-type Pokemon. This great defensive typing is further fortified by Mega Swampert's amazing bulk, allowing it to survive a hit from powerful attackers like Porygon-Z, Dragonite, and Pheromosa and put them to sleep with the combination of Yawn + Protect. Mega Swampert's Ground / Ice coverage in Earthquake and Ice Beam hits many common Fire-, Steel-, Dragon-, and Ground-type Pokemon super effectively like Victini, Magnezone, Dragonite, and Garchomp. However, Mega Swampert's main selling point in Yawn is also its biggest downfall, as its reliance on sleep turns makes it a shaky check to Pokemon that can 2HKO it like Dragonite, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny, relying on the 66% chance that opposing Pokemon stay asleep for at least two turns. Furthermore, with a lack of usable stat-boosting moves and an over reliance on sleep turns, Mega Swampert is usually countered by a plethora of stall-oriented Pokemon with access to Taunt like Deoxys-S, Mew, and Mega Sableye or Defense-boosting moves like Mega Slowbro and Mega Altaria. Lastly, Mega Swampert's Water / Ground typing gives it a glaring 4x Grass-type weakness, making it susceptible to Grass-type Pokemon like Serperior and Grass-type coverage like Solar Beam from Mega Charizard Y and Grass Knot from Greninja.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Swampert can utilize Counter or Mirror Coat thanks to its great mixed bulk, potentially baiting Mega Charizard X into using Outrage and surprising some special attackers like Choice Specs Latios. However, using Yawn + Protect and attacking twice usually accomplishes what these moves are trying to do with less prediction needed against powerful Pokemon that can run physical or special movesets like Hoopa-U and Pheromosa. Waterfall also seems like a good option, as it is boosted by STAB, but Ground / Ice coverage already hits everything that Water-type coverage hits, with Waterfall only being useful to surprise for Substitute + Magnet Rise Mega Metagross as well as Levitate users and Flying-type Pokemon that resist Ice Beam such as Rotom-H and Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X before it Mega Evolves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-type Moves: Mega Swampert's 4x weakness to Grass-type moves means that it gets OHKOed by most of them. Grass-types such as Kartana, Serperior, and Tapu Bulu along with Pokemon carrying unexpected Grass-type coverage such as Bloom Doom Heatran, Grass Knot Greninja, and Hoopa-U directly counter Mega Swampert.</p> <p><strong>Physically Oriented Stall Pokemon: As Mega Swampert is unable to raise its Attack, Iron Defense users like Registeel, Mega Slowbro, and Necrozma along with Will-O-Wisp users like Mega Sableye and Kee Berry Mew can cripple Mega Swampert and beat it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Taunt Users: Taunt effectively shuts down Mega Swampert's main strategy in Yawn, especially from bulky Pokemon that commonly utilize the move such as Tapu Fini, Mega Gyarados, Kommo-o, and Whimsicott.</p> <p><strong>Substitute: Substitute also blocks Yawn and provides an extra obstacle of mind games for Mega Swampert to break through. This move in and of itself makes matchups versus Garchomp, Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, and Greninja tricky.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-immune Pokemon: Magnet Rise users like Mega Metagross and Aegislash can be troublesome for Mega Swampert, as can bulky Flying-type Pokemon like Skarmory and Mega Pidgeot and Levitate users such as Mega Latias and Rotom-W.</p> ",

        "name": "Yawn + Protect",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Yawn should be used against Pokemon like Charizard, Sawk, Crustle, and Haxorus. Protect is used in combination with Yawn to ensure that the foe falls asleep the next turn by preventing Mega Swampert from getting attacked or being affected by Encore, status conditions, or Encore from Pokemon like Mega Lopunny. Earthquake is Mega Swampert's most powerful STAB move, hitting extremely hard with investment and a base 150 Attack stat. This allows it to KO Pokemon it doesn't need Yawn to win against, like Zeraora, Magnezone, and Blacephalon. Ice Beam allows Mega Swampert to deal with the many Flying-types that are immune to Earthquake and hit specific Pokemon 4x super effectively, including metagame staples like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Dragonite, and Zygarde.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>208 HP EVs are used to maximize Mega Swampert's great mixed bulk by allowing it to take a Dragonium Z-boosted Outrage from Dragonite, as well as anything physical nukes like Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny can throw at it so it can use Yawn against them on turn 1. 248 Special Defense EVs paired with this HP investment allow Mega Swampert to beat both Normalium Z and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z by taking Breakneck Blitz and preventing Uproar from Choice Scarf variants from 2HKOing it. 36 Special Attack EVs are needed to guarantee that Ice Beam 2HKOes maximum HP Dragonite. The Attack stat is where the remaining EVs go. A Brave nature allows Mega Swampert to not hinder its Special Attack while increasing its Attack at the expense of its Speed, a stat it does not need very much. This still gives it enough Speed to outspeed uninvested base 60s like bulky Primarina and Incineroar.</p> <p>An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 28 Atk / 232 SpA with a Brave nature can be used to guarantee that Ice Beam will OHKO Landorus-T and Garchomp and 2HKO Groundium Z Zygarde without having to worry about potential Substitute mind games.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Do not send Mega Swampert into versatile Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Greninja, and Hoopa-U, as they can try to lure in Mega Swampert with their Grass-type coverage. Usually, it's not a good idea to pick Mega Swampert versus stall Pokemon like Mega Sableye, Type: Null, and Registeel, as they can nullify Yawn's usefulness and boost their defenses. Sadly, bulky Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X and Mega Gyarados can forgo Mega Evolving and immunize themselves to Earthquake while shaking off Ice Beam with ease thanks to their secondary typings, so picking Mega Swampert into common Fire / Water / Grass cores with these Pokemon is not advised. Using Protect on turn 1 is advised versus powerful Fake Out users like Mega Medicham and Flail Mega Lopunny to prevent chip damage that might otherwise let them OHKO Mega Swampert. It is also important to use Protect turn 1 when facing off against Porygon-Z, as this allows you to scout if it uses Uproar, in which case you can proceed to use Earthquake twice, as Uproar does not 2HKO Mega Swampert, and Earthquake will always 2HKO Porygon-Z.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fire-types like Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y deserve a special mention for their ability to counter Steel- and Grass-types that Mega Swampert struggles with such as Magearna, Registeel, Tapu Bulu, Serperior, and Ferrothorn, as well as Will-O-Wisp users such as Mew and Volcarona. Mega Swampert, in return, can take care of Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon that counter them such as non-Magnet Rise Mega Diancie, Donphan, Garchomp, and Archeops. Grass + Steel types like Kartana and Ferrothorn are fitting partners for Mega Swampert, as they counter opposing Grass- and Water-types such as Whimsicott, Tapu Bulu, Mega Gyarados, and Tapu Fini with their secondary STAB options. Furthermore, their secondary Steel typing helps versus Fairy-type Pokemon that Mega Swampert struggles with such as Clefable and Taunt / Will-O-Wisp Mega Gardevoir. Mega Swampert, in return, takes care of most of the Fire-, Poison-, and Fighting-types that threaten them such as Blacephalon, Nagandel, and Mega Lopunny. Along with that, Pokemon that carry multi-hit moves and sound-based moves to get through Substitute, a direct counter to Yawn, match well with Mega Swampert. Notable examples include Mega Heracross and Volcarona, with the former being a great Will-O-Wisp absorber thanks to its pre-Mega ability in Guts and access to Bullet Seed and Pin Missile to hit Water- and Grass-types hiding behind Substitute like Greninja, Primarina, Serperior, and Whimsicott, as well as access to Close Combat to counter bulky Normal-types like Chansey, Porygon2, and Type: Null. Mega Swampert, in return, can deal with Pokemon Mega Heracross struggles against including Flying-types like Flyinium Z Dragonite, Flyinium Z Landorus-T, and non-Substitute Mega Pinsir, as well as some offensive Fire-types including Mega Blaziken and Victini. Volcarona also helps take care of Steel-types not hit hard by Earthquake and problematic Psychic-types such as Celesteela, Magnet Rise Mega Metagross, Mega Mawile, Mew, and Necrozma thanks to its unique Fire / Bug typing while also utilizing Bug Buzz to hit through Substitute and inflicting special damage to complement Mega Swampert's physical attacking prowess. Mega Swampert, in return, helps counter Rock-type Pokemon like Golem and Crustle and Pokemon carrying Rock-type coverage such as Stone Edge Sawk and Stone Edge Garchomp.</p> "

It also has a great movepool with coverage against other common metagame threats including Zygarde, Heatran, and Genesect and can utilize alternative spreads to beat bulkier Pokemon like Mega Gyarados. However, Slaking’s awful ability in Truant leaves it open every other turn, which is taken advantage of by Protect or Substitute users and Pokemon that are able to survive Slaking's first hit and have the means to KO it back like Aegislash and Mega Gyarados. It also faces competition from Pokemon like Diggersby, which swaps bulk and greater power on Giga Impact for a more powerful Earthquake and a better ability.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Slaking’s main set is Choice Band, there are also two other variants you could run. A Choice Scarf set takes advantage of the gained Speed to OHKO fast frail foes like offensive Mega Gardevoir and Choice Scarf Porygon Z. However, this set comes up short of OHKOing bulkier threats like Tapu Fini and Kommo-o. The other set, which is less common, is stall. This set takes advantage of Slaking’s ability and natural bulk to PP stall Pokemon like Mega Slowbro and Type: Null. This usually runs Amnesia / Bulk Up / Rest. However, this set lacks power to KO threats and relies too much on its bulk to survive multiple hits.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Protect and Fast Substitute Users: Protect and faster Substitute users completely nullify Choice Band Slaking because of its Truant ability. Pokemon that take advantage of these moves are Whimsicott, Landorus-T, Groundium Z Garchomp, Mega Blaziken, Jumpluff, Mega Swampert, Serperior, and Aegislash.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out Users: A Fake Out flinch turn 1 triggers Truant the next turn for Slaking and allows the foe to freely use a super effective attack or boosting move. This makes most matchups against common foes like Mega Lopunny, Incineroar, Mega Medicham, and Zeraora completely unreliable and an uphill battle for Slaking.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Most Steel-types can tank Slaking's attacks fairy well and overwhelm it either through boosting or simply by KOing it within a few turns. Some Steel-types worth mentioning would be Magearna, bulky Mega Metagross, Celesteela, Mega Mawile, and Registeel.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Offense: While most Steel-types also fit into this category, generally Pokemon that can withstand attacks and have a followup can beat Slaking. For example, Mega Gyarados, bulky Dragonite, and Kyurem all have some way to combat Slaking after its first attack while it's loafing around.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Stall: Bulky stall Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro, Mega Sableye, and Type: Null usually can easily deal with Slaking's attacks and gain the initiative to set up because of Truant.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Users: Pokemon like Donphan, Magnezone, Crustle, Sawk, and Carracosta can take advantage of their ability in Sturdy to usually get the edge over Slaking because it needs at least three turns to KO them.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Most Fighting-types have the advantage not only typing but also in Speed.

You should use 100% accurate moves like Ice Punch and Earthquake whenever applicable instead of Giga Impact, so you don't risk the 10% chance of missing against foes like Choice Band Garchomp and Victini. When Slaking is up against stall foes that it can't beat otherwise, the optimal play is to either use Giga Impact if a critical hit can OHKO the opposing Pokemon or spam Ice Punch to attempt to freeze it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bulky special Psychic-types are generally good teammates for Slaking because they cover up its weakness to Fighting-types like Mega Lucario and Pheromosa and to common heavy-hitters that rely on their abilities like Donphan, Golem, and Dragonite. Alongside this, a physical / special attacker pairing is usually a good way to cover a variety of threats. In return, Slaking can be a effective Psychic-type partner, as it can smash frail Bug- and Ghost-types like Mega Heracross and Blacephalon fairly well. While Dark-types like Mega Sableye can often be a problem for Slaking, Fairy-types like Tapu Lele, Mega Gardevoir, and Clefable generally have a good matchup against them. Teammates that cover Slaking’s ability and beat Protect and fast Substitute users include Pokemon like Volcarona, Serperior, and Greninja. Volcarona and Serperior benefit from Substitute and their Special Attack-boosting moves to pressure opposing utility Pokemon, not to mention Volcarona can hit through Substitute with Bug Buzz, while Greninja's great movepool, power, and Speed typically grant it a great matchup against most Protect and Substitute users like Jumpluff and Mega Swampert. In return, Slaking deals with bulky offensive Pokemon that can survive weaker attacks and OHKO back like non-Will-O-Wisp Mega Charizard X and Kommo-o. Sturdy users like Crustle and Magnezone often pose a threat to Slaking; naturally, Pokemon that beat them can fit well with it. These would include Pokemon like Mega Gyarados, fast Donphan, and special Dragonite. In return, Slaking covers up most faster frail foes that intimidate them like Mega Diancie and Tapu Bulu.</p> "

  "Sableye": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Sableye fills a solid role in the 1v1 metagame thanks to its access to two useful abilities in Prankster and Magic Bounce, as well as its great defensive typing and stats. It is useful for stalling out many Pokemon, such as Dragonite or Genesect, thanks to priority Will-O-Wisp and Calm Mind, reducing the damage taken from opposing Pokemon. It also counters Pokemon that rely on status, such as Jumpluff and Chansey, due to Magic Bounce. Magic Bounce also stops opposing Pokemon such as Zeraora and Kee Berry Mew from using Taunt on Mega Sableye. It can also utilize several other utility options, such as Taunt and Recover, in order to prevent setup and stay out of range of being knocked out, as well as moves such as Metal Burst and Foul Play to punish heavy hitters such as Naganadel and Garchomp. Unfortunately, Mega Sableye does have some unfavorable matchups against some common Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Mega Gyarados. Fairy-types, such as Magearna and Mega Gardevoir, also present a problem for Mega Sableye, as Fairy is the only type Mega Sableye is hit super effectively by.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Night Shade, Snarl, or Dark Pulse can also help Mega Sableye handle special attackers such as special Dragonite and Aegislash more quickly than Taunt and Metal Burst, and they come in handy if you want your Mega Sableye to deal direct damage against special attackers instead of relying on Metal Burst. However, realistically, the combination of Calm Mind, Taunt, and Metal Burst is going to handle most special attackers just as effectively as Calm Mind and an attack while covering strong Choice-locked attackers, such as Haxorus and non-Adamant Choice Band Victini, as well.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: By far, the biggest weakness for Mega Sableye is Fairy-type Pokemon. Virtually every Fairy-type Pokemon will threaten Mega Sableye, as they are the only type that can hit Mega Sableye for super effective damage. Beware of Pokemon such as Magearna, Mega Gardevoir, Tapu Lele, Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Mega Altaria. However, they can sometimes be played around by using a combination of Metal Burst and Calm Mind or Taunt, as Mega Sableye can potentially take one Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Hyper Offense: Certain extremely powerful Pokemon can break through Mega Sableye's impressive bulk in a single attack, even after a Will-O-Wisp or Calm Mind boost. Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Adamant Choice Band Victini, and Choice Specs Blacephalon will blow away Mega Sableye in a single turn. Other powerful setup Pokemon, such as mixed Zeraora and Mega Blaziken, can boost their attacking stats in order to deal fatal damage with their attacks, but they can be forced into a mind game with Taunt and Metal Burst.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Dark-types: Certain bulky Dark-types possess the tools necessary to break through Mega Sableye. Taunt Mega Gyarados is the biggest example, using its Dark typing to gain an immunity to Prankster Will-O-Wisp and Taunt, and using a Taunt of its own to cripple Mega Sableye, setting up on and OHKOing it while taking minimal damage from Foul Play. Incineroar is another example of this, using Bulk Up or Swords Dance to boost its Attack while being immune to Prankster Taunt and Will-O-Wisp, and OHKO Mega Sableye with Malicious Moonsault.</p> <p><strong>Mega Lopunny: As the only relevant Fighting-type Pokemon with Scrappy, Mega Lopunny is a consistent counter to Mega Sableye, as Fake Out followed by High Jump Kick is a guaranteed KO, even after a Will-O-Wisp.</p> ",

        "name": "Stall",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Will-O-Wisp is Mega Sableye's form of neutralizing many physical attackers like Mega Metagross, Donphan, and physical Dragonite. Once they are burned, they will be taken down through a combination of Mega Sableye's other moves. Recover is a necessary healing move to stop Mega Sableye from gradually getting chipped down from Pokemon such as bulky Kommo-o and non-Nasty Plot Porygon-Z. Foul Play helps beat opposing Pokemon that will try to set up on Mega Sableye such as Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. Metal Burst makes use of Mega Sableye's bulk to strike back against foes that try to knock it out in one hit with a Z-Move or a powerful attack, such as Naganadel, Haxorus, and Choice Specs Greninja. Taunt improves Mega Sableye's matchup against Pokemon that want to set up against it, such as Zygarde and Mew, by forcing them to attack and wasting their attack's PP. It also improves the matchup against opposing stall Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Deoxys-S and allows it to stop recovery moves. Calm Mind is a reliable way to stall out non-boosting special attackers such as Genesect and non-Nasty Plot Porygon-Z.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread with a Bold nature greatly boosts Mega Sableye's Defense while leaving it enough Special Defense to not give Download users such as Genesect a Special Attack boost and preventing it from 2HKOing Mega Sableye. The spread also allows Mega Sableye to avoid being knocked out by several different Pokemon, such as Aegislash, Naganadel, Haxorus, Greninja, and non-Nasty Plot Porygon-Z. Prankster provides Sableye with priority Will-O-Wisp and Taunt, which allows it to burn physical attackers, such as Dragonite and Golem, and shut down stall Pokemon like Chansey and Celesteela before they have a chance to affect Sableye. Recover and Calm Mind also receive priority to help Sableye survive attacks. After Mega Evolution, Magic Bounce stops opposing Pokemon like Jumpluff from stalling with status moves like Leech Seed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Taunt Mega Gyarados easily defeats Mega Sableye due to its access to Mold Breaker to bypass Mega Sableye's Magic Bounce, but otherwise, Mega Sableye will beat other Mega Gyarados variants after burning it with Will-O-Wisp. Remember when playing against Mega Gyarados and Mega Tyranitar to Mega Evolve and then use Will-O-Wisp, because Prankster moves do not affect Dark-type Pokemon. If physical attackers try to nullify the burn with setup moves like Swords Dance and Dragon Dance, Foul Play will simply deal more damage, sealing their fate. Dragon Dance Dragonite is a particularly unique matchup. Use Will-O-Wisp turn one. If Dragonite uses Devastating Drake turn one, Sableye will be able to use Recover the next turn and safely start damaging Dragonite with Foul Play. If it uses Dragon Dance on the Will-O-Wisp, you will need to Mega Evolve Sableye next turn and use Recover. If it does not Mega Evolve, it will faint to a +1 Devastating Drake; by recovering, this covers the play of Dragonite either using its Z-Move or using Dragon Dance again. If it sets up Dragon Dance again, use Foul Play the next turn, as not only will a +2 Devastating Drake from a burned Dragonite fail to knock out Mega Sableye, but Foul Play also will do enough damage after burn damage to OHKO. Physical setup attackers that are unaffected by Will-O-Wisp, primarily Mega Charizard X and Mega Blaziken, will be a tossup; Mega Sableye will either need to use Metal Burst on their attack or use Taunt on a predicted setup move. Mega Sableye's selection of variable moves makes it flexible for catering to the needs of its teammates, which allows it to work well with most other Pokemon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that deter Fairy-type Pokemon like Magearna, Mega Gardevoir, and Tapu Lele, such as Poison- or Steel-type Pokemon like Naganadel, Mega Metagross, and Aegislash, are all good options to help support Mega Sableye. In return, Mega Sableye complements Poison-types by handling Psychic-type Pokemon such as Mew and Meloetta and helps Steel-types by warding off Ground-type Pokemon such as Garchomp, Donphan, and Golem. Specially defensive Mega Charizard X could be a solid teammate as well to handle Fairy-types such as Magearna and Mega Gardevoir, as could Mega Charizard Y. Mega Sableye also supports Mega Charizard X by being able to defeat Porygon-Z, Crustle, and Donphan. Pokemon that can also threaten Taunt Mega Gyarados and Mega Lopunny, two of Mega Sableye's most common answers, such as Mega Venusaur, Zeraora, and Mega Metagross, can also be very helpful. Mega Sableye helps out these Pokemon by defeating Psychic- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Mew, Meloetta, Donphan, and Zygarde.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Mega Mawile is a force to be reckoned with in the 1v1 metagame, able to deal with top-tier threats such as Mega Gyarados, Porygon-Z, and Tapu Lele. Its ability, Huge Power, grants it the highest effective base Attack in the game, which it can boost even further with Swords Dance. A very solid typing in Steel / Fairy allows it to resist prevalent types like Normal, Psychic, Dark, and Fairy. Its natural bulk and pre-Mega ability Intimidate allow Mega Mawile to survive most neutral hits and even some super effective ones. However, Mega Mawile's abysmal Speed tier does it no favors, other than allowing it to almost always land Metal Burst successfully. There are also many common Fire- and Ground-types, such as Charizard, Heatran, and Donphan, which can handle Mega Mawile effectively.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hyper Cutter is another option over Intimidate that prevents opposing Pokemon from weakening Mawile's Attack with Intimidate or moves like Charm. Combined with Swords Dance, Mega Mawile can boost its Attack to nigh-unstoppable levels. This can help against Pokemon such as Charm Mega Venusaur and Chansey but sorely restricts its defensive utility, losing out matchups like Choice Band Garchomp and Mega Gyarados. Other moves such as Counter, Endure, Ice Punch, and Thunder Punch can be run; however, they are hard to fit on Mega Mawile's tight moveset, as you lose out on either priority with Sucker Punch, utility with Taunt, or setup with Swords Dance. Counter hits physical attackers harder, such as Mega Aggron. Endure can be used to lure recharge move users such as Blast Burn Mega Charizard Y and Hydro Cannon Water-type starter Pokemon. Ice Punch hits some Pokemon harder, having a higher chance of OHKOing uninvested Dragonite. Thunder Punch eases the Mega Gyarados and Tapu Fini matchup and provides a way to hit Celesteela and Mega Charizard X that do not Mega Evolve fearing Play Rough.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Pokemon with Super Effective STAB Moves: Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Groundium Z Donphan and Garchomp can OHKO Mega Mawile before it has a chance to strike back.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers: Pokemon with strong special attacks such as Choice Specs Naganadel and Electrium Z Magnezone are usually able to OHKO Mega Mawile, unless Mega Mawile is running a specially defensive set.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Mega Mawile's STAB Moves: Steel-types like Mega Aggron do not fear any of Mega Mawile's moves and can 3HKO back with Heavy Slam. Mega Venusaur resists Play Rough and can chip away at Mega Mawile, unless Mega Mawile uses Swords Dance and carries Iron Head as well.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that can lower Mega Mawile's Attack or boost their physical bulk, such as stall Mew and Mega Slowbro, are good checks to Mega Mawile. Mega Mawile cannot use Taunt to defeat these Pokemon, as Mew has a faster Taunt and Slowbro has Oblivious.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Play Rough is Mega Mawile's go-to STAB move, resisted only by Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types. It allows Mega Mawile to 2HKO Pokemon such as Gyarados and Dragonite and OHKO most frail offensive Pokemon like Porygon-Z. Sucker Punch makes up for Mawile's terrible Speed and allows it to finish off foes after any of Mega Mawile's other moves, such as against Meloetta. It can also sometimes outright OHKO targets such as Blacephalon. Iron Head is Mega Mawile's secondary STAB move that lets it hit Rock- and Fairy-type Pokemon, such as Crustle and Tapu Bulu, for super effective damage, as well as hitting Pokemon like Magearna and Mega Venusaur for neutral damage. Alternatively, Taunt is a very potent status move that allows Mega Mawile to check stall Pokemon, such as Porygon2 and Pyukumuku, and prevents foes like Magearna and Mega Altaria from using status moves to set up or heal themselves, while Fire Fang allows Mega Mawile to hit Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Kartana for super effective damage. Swords Dance allows Mega Mawile to boost its Attack to even further heights to defeat bulkier Pokemon. This can allow it to break past defensive walls like Chansey without fear of Counter. Metal Burst is always a good option to have for Choice item users like Garchomp as well as foes that do not have recovery like Tapu Fini.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment along with 104 Defense EVs specifically allow Mega Mawile to survive an Earthquake from Adamant Gyarados followed by another Earthquake after it Mega Evolves into Mega Gyarados. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack to maximize damage output. Intimidate is the preferred ability that lets Mawile lower the opposing Pokemon's Attack stat, which allows it to survive many hits it normally wouldn't be able to take, such as Choice Band Garchomp's Earthquake and two Earthquakes from Adamant Dragonite.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Send Mega Mawile in on stall Pokemon that rely on only status moves and do not carry Taunt themselves, such as Wide Lens Jumpluff. Deoxys-S will be a 50/50, deciding whether or not you attack on a Taunt or Taunt on their Iron Defense. Against foes that may carry Counter, it is better to use a weaker move like Sucker Punch or Metal Burst to scout for Counter before committing to a stronger move. The matchup with Mega Metagross is a tossup. If you have Metal Burst, use that first, and if not, use Sucker Punch first. Be wary that Mega Metagross can render Sucker Punch useless with Bullet Punch, so play accordingly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can deal with both Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y, such as Water-type Pokemon like Primarina and Mega Gyarados and Dragon-types like Garchomp and Zygarde, are good partners for Mega Mawile. Mega Mawile can cover Pokemon that threaten them such as Porygon-Z and Meloetta. Mega Mawile needs checks to Sturdy Pokemon like Donphan and Golem, so physically bulky Pokemon like Mega Slowbro, Mega Sableye, and defensive Mew are much appreciated. Mega Mawile also helps to check the Dark-types that threaten these Pokemon, like Hoopa-U and Mega Gyarados. Ground-type Pokemon like Donphan and Landorus-T pair well with Mega Mawile, as their STAB attacks are super effective against all foes that resist Fairy, namely Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-types like Mega Aggron, Naganadel, and Mega Charizard X. Meanwhile, Mega Mawile takes care of Water- and Grass-types like Mega Gyarados and Tapu Bulu as well as some of the bulkier Dragon-types like Dragonite, Mega Altaria, and Kommo-o.</p> "

Metal Burst allows Mega Mawile to retaliate after surviving opposing Pokemon's moves. This is a great move to lure Pokemon that are unable to OHKO Mega Mawile, such as Genesect and Choice Specs Greninja. Sucker Punch is a great priority finisher that allows Mega Mawile to finish off weakened Pokemon, such as Crustle after a Play Rough. Taunt forces opposing Pokemon to attack, preventing them from recovering HP and also letting Mega Mawile get off a guaranteed Metal Burst, shutting down setup Pokemon like Fairium Z Magearna. Swords Dance is an option to boost Mega Mawile's already insane Attack stat. When used in conjunction with Taunt, this can allow Mega Mawile to break through certain stall Pokemon like Chansey and Necrozma.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment allows Mega Mawile to survive as many attacks as possible, Modest Primarina's Oceanic Operetta in particular. It allows Mega Mawile to survive many special attacks in general, such as Aegislash's Never-Ending Nightmare and Choice Specs Greninja's Hydro Cannon. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack. Intimidate lowers the opponent's Attack and also improves Mega Mawile's survivability. 0 Speed IVs with a Sassy nature help Mega Mawile be slower so Metal Burst does not fail.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Mega Mawile against special attackers that usually have the upper hand against offensive sets. This set does well against Choice item users that cannot OHKO Mega Mawile, as Mega Mawile can simply return any damage it takes through Metal Burst or outright OHKO them with Play Rough. These include Choice Scarf Garchomp, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Choice Specs Greninja, Choice Specs Genesect, and Choice Specs Necrozma. As this is a lure set, it is best used to surprise the opponent. If they are aware of your strategy, Pokemon such as Primarina and Electrium Z Magnezone can take advantage of Metal Burst and use status moves like Substitute and Metal Sound to prevent taking heavy damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rock- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar and Golem work well with Mega Mawile, as they deal with the omnipresent Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y, while Mega Mawile can deal with the Water-type Pokemon that threaten them, like Mega Gyarados and Tapu Fini. Mega Mawile also pairs well with special attackers like Normalium Z Porygon-Z, Mega Charizard Y, and Choice Specs Greninja that can handle physical walls like Mega Slowbro and Mew.

  "Aron": {
    "overview": "<p>Aron is a gimmick Pokemon that can catch people off guard if they don't have the proper resources or experience on their team to counter it. This gimmick specifically relies on Sturdy, allowing Aron to take a hit from almost any Pokemon barring ones with status moves, Mold Breaker, or multi-hit moves. With the combination of level 1, Sturdy, Shell Bell, and Endeavor, Aron is able to take a hit, use Endeavor to bring the opposing Pokemon down to 1 HP, heal back all of the damage with Shell Bell, and eventually use either Sandstorm, Metal Burst, or Toxic to finish off the foe. This lets Aron beat Pokemon that cannot deviate from attacking like Dragonite, Donphan, Mega Altaria, and Meloetta. However, an abundance of status moves including Will-O-Wisp, Sleep Powder, Taunt, and Substitute all stop Aron from completing the task at hand. Furthermore, Mold Breaker Pokemon like Haxorus and Mega Gyarados can go through Sturdy and OHKO Aron. Lastly, flinching moves are also prevalent in the metagame. Though Aron can block Fake Out if it is running Protect, moves like Iron Head and Air Slash used by Pokemon like Jirachi, Mega Mawile, Mega Charizard Y, and Togekiss make matchups with them unreliable, as one flinch can catch Aron off guard and leave it open to being KOed the next turn.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aron has no other options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Endeavor</strong>: Ghost-types fully prevent Aron from carrying out its strategy and can effectively beat Aron no matter the set. Common Ghost-type Pokemon in 1v1 are Mega Gengar, Aegislash, and Mega Sableye. Zeraora's Plasma Fists turns Endeavor into an Electric-type move, preventing Aron from damaging Zeraora.</p> <p><strong>Workarounds to Sturdy: Pokemon with Mold Breaker or multi-hit attacks can easily KO Aron due to them bypassing its Sturdy ability. Examples of these Pokemon include Mega Gyarados, Haxorus, Excadrill, and Mega Heracross. On another note, any Pokemon that can put Aron to sleep can break its gimmick by just 2HKOing or stalling out Aron. Examples of these Pokemon include Smeargle, Breloom, Mega Venusaur, Jumpluff, Mega Swampert, and Vivillon.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Moves that can cause residual damage at the end of the turn like Leech Seed and Will-O-Wisp can break Aron's Sturdy, after which the opposing Pokemon can KO Aron with any move. Users of such moves include Mega Venusaur, Celesteela, Serperior, Whimsicott, and Mega Gardevoir, Mega Charizard X, and Victini. Also, the abilities Rough Skin and Iron Barbs block Aron from using Endeavor because if it uses it, it'll have its Sturdy broken and subsequently get KOed by any move. These abilities are mainly used by Garchomp and Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt can shut down all of Aron's moves outside of Endeavor and Metal Burst, leaving it unable to perform its gimmick and enabling opposing Pokemon to PP stall Aron until it is forced to use Struggle. Examples of common Pokemon that run this move are Tapu Lele, Kommo-o, Tapu Fini, Kee Berry Mew, Victini, Mega Mawile, Mega Tyranitar, and Tapu Bulu.</p> <p><strong>PP Stall: Pokemon with high PP status moves like Metal Sound Magnezone, Celesteela, Rest Zygarde-C, and Registeel can stall out Aron until it runs out of PP with no way of KOing the foe and make it use Struggle.</p> <p><strong>Substitute: Any Pokemon with Substitute can negate Aron's gimmick moves by blocking status, and when these foes are at low enough HP, Endeavor no longer does enough damage to break through Substitute. Examples of common metagame threats that run Substitute are Torrent Greninja, Mega Metagross, Zygarde, Primarina, and Landorus-T.</p> <p><strong>Flinching Moves: Pokemon that have the main goal of taking down their foe through flinches have a good chance of winning against Aron due to just one flinch stopping it from performing its gimmick fully. These Pokemon mainly include Jirachi and Togekiss. Also, if Aron doesn't have Protect, Fake Out users like Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny can beat it.</p> ",

Pokemon that Endeavor can beat, alongside other moves, include Dragonite, Victini, and Donphan. Sandstorm allows Aron to finish off opposing Pokemon after using Endeavor at 1 HP unless they are Steel-, Rock-, or Ground-types. Metal Burst is for Steel-types, which are immune to both sandstorm and Toxic chip damage; it guarantees Aron's matchup against offensive Steel-types that are only able to use attacking moves, like Genesect and Choice Specs Celesteela. Toxic should be used against foes that are Ground- or Rock-type and use Counter, like Donphan and Golem. Protect is an option over Toxic if you want the potential to win against Pokemon that use Fake Out like Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, Mewnium Z Mew, Incineroar, and Weavile. Water Pulse can be used to win the mirror matchup versus other Aron.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sturdy crucially allows Aron to take one hit and use Endeavor in return, lowering the opponent's HP down to 1. Shell Bell, in combination with Endeavor and Aron being at level 1, allows Aron to restore itself to full health after using Endeavor at 1 HP. A Brave nature along with 0 Speed EVs allows Aron to be as slow as possible to potentially win the mirror matchup versus other Aron. No EVs outside of Attack are invested because they are not needed, as Aron is level 1 and any attack will bring it down to 1 HP anyway.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against most Pokemon, the standard procedure is to use Endeavor turn one and subsequently use Toxic or Sandstorm to knock out the opposing Pokemon. Use this strategy versus Pokemon like Dragonite, Choice Specs Greninja, and non-Taunt Tapu Lele. Against Counter users, like Donphan and Golem, you may want to use Toxic or Sandstorm turn one if you expect them to use Counter that turn. Use Protect against Pokemon that you want to scout sets for or that you expect to use Fake Out. Examples of Fake Out users are Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, and Mega Blastoise. Be aware that Z-Move users that use Fake Out like Mew and Incineroar force you to win a mind game, since they can opt to use their Z-Move on Aron's Protect. Stay away from users of moves or abilities that inflict residual damage like Jumpluff, Mega Charizard X, and Garchomp, Taunt and Substitute users like Tapu Lele and Greninja, and Pokemon with abilities that circumvent Sturdy like Mega Gyarados, Excadrill, and Mega Heracross.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can beat Taunt users like Kommo-o and Tapu Lele can be good assets for an Aron-based team; examples of these Pokemon include hyper offensive threats like Porygon-Z, Naganadel, and Choice Band Zeraora.

Taunt users that can stop residual damage-inducing moves like Sleep Powder, Will-O-Wisp, and Leech Seed from the likes of Jumpluff, Mega Gardevoir, and Whimsicott are good partners for Aron; examples of these include Tapu Lele, Mew, Heatran, and Kommo-o. In return, Aron can take down Dragonite and Meloetta for them. Aron commonly loses to users of abilities like Mold Breaker, Skill Link, and Rough Skin such as Mega Gyarados, Excadrill, Haxorus, Mega Heracross, and Garchomp. Teammates that can beat more than half of these Pokemon are Dragonite, Mega Gyarados, and Greninja.

The combination of Sturdy and Metal Burst allows Mega Aggron to neutralize Choice item users such as Naganadel, Greninja, and Genesect, who would otherwise be too much for Mega Aggron to handle. Mega Aggron also has access to Taunt, which gives it the potential to beat Pokemon that want to play around Metal Burst, like Manaphy, and can shut down certain fast sleep users such as Jumpluff and Vivillon. The need for higher HP and power to beat threats such as Mega Charizard X makes it very vulnerable to specially offensive Pokemon that can play around Sturdy. Metal Burst can also be played around, by either hitting it with a less damaging move in the first turns or using status moves, such as Substitute and Will-O-Wisp. Taunt helps avoid this situation, although it's not very reliable, if they attack when you Taunt. Taunt also isn't enough to prevent losing to common stall threats such as Mega Sableye, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Slowbro, as Mega Aggron has no reliable way of boosting its offenses outside of Curse.</p> <p>A Rockium Z set can also be used to beat threats to the Mega set, such as both Mega Charizard X and Y, without relying so heavily on Head Smash's inconsistent accuracy. It is also no longer mandatory to run Metal Burst and Taunt, allowing the use of Screech, allowing Aggron to beat certain Kee Berry Mew variants when used with Rock Tomb. However, Aggron is not nearly as bulky as Mega Aggron and is forced to keep its Rock typing, leaving it susceptible to threats like Mega Metagross, Haxorus, and Mega Lopunny.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Curse and Rest are a good combination of moves, since Mega Aggron isn't very concerned about the Speed drops and can use its boosted stats to very easily deal with threats like non-Taunt Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Metagross.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Taunt Stallers: Mega Aggron's low Speed prevents it from Taunting opposing Pokemon before they can make a move. Thus, Pokemon like Kee Berry Mew can Taunt Mega Aggron to prevent being affected by Taunt themselves, and then go on with the stall.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker: Mold Breaker can bypass Aggron's Sturdy and Filter, so Pokemon like Excadrill and Taunt Mega Gyarados can hit it without worrying about getting KOed by Metal Burst.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy: Sturdy Pokemon like Magnezone, Carracosta, Donphan, and Golem can comfortably 2HKO Mega Aggron while evading an OHKO thanks to their ability.</p> <p><strong>Non-Choiced Bulky Special Attackers: Pokemon like Magnet Rise Aegislash, Primarina, and Heatran can hit Aggron with a weak move to neutralize its Sturdy without getting KOed by Metal Burst and then KO it with a strong special move.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Metal Burst is a very useful move for Mega Aggron's arsenal. Combined with Filter and Sturdy, it can take out threats such as Haxorus, Naganadel, and Dragonite. Head Smash's high Base Power and Rock STAB combined with Sturdy can let Aggron take out both Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y. Be wary, though, as its poor accuracy and heavy recoil might lead to losing some matches, especially against Mega Charizard X and Y. Heavy Slam is Mega Aggron's most reliable STAB move. Its damage is based on its weight, which makes it have a consistently high Base Power, with Mega Aggron being one of the heaviest Pokemon in the metagame. It can easily defeat Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Clefable, and Mega Altaria. Earthquake is a strong Ground-type coverage move that can super effectively hit most of the typings that resist Heavy Slam and Head Smash, making it a reliable choice to beat the likes of Aegislash and Mega Metagross. Taunt is a very useful move that can beat semi-stall Pokemon like Porygon2 and help Mega Aggron's matchup against fast sleep users such as Vivillon and Jumpluff. Avalanche can be used to beat Pokemon like Landorus-T, Zygarde, and uninvested Dragonite without worrying about mind games from setup or chip damage moves.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>240 HP and 64 Defense EVs with a Relaxed Nature makes it so Mega Aggron will be able to tank a Fake Out followed up by two High Jump Kicks from Mega Lopunny, as well as Pokemon like Mega Charizard X and Haxorus. 240 HP also allows Mega Aggron to deal as much damage as possible with its Metal Burst. 204 Attack investment gives it as much offensive power as possible in order to solidify matchups against Z-Reflect Tapu Lele, Will-O-Wisp Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Charizard X, as well as always OHKO Aegislash in its Blade for before mega evolving. 0 Speed IVs allow Aggron to get outsped by the majority of the Pokemon in the metagame, letting it use Metal Burst successfully as often as possible against slow Pokemon such as Scrafty; it also helps by letting it move last against Aegislash and knock it out with Earthquake.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Aggron's massive physical bulk and strength make it a good choice against most physically offensive Pokemon, like Mega Tyranitar and Tapu Bulu. The combination of Sturdy and Metal Burst makes it ideal to face Choice item users such as Kartana, Genesect, and Garchomp. Against Pokemon you predict to set up offensively like non-Taunt and non-Earthquake Mega Gyarados and Manaphy, you can use Taunt turn 1 to force them to attack. When facing any of Charizard's Mega Evolutions, your best bet is to not Mega Evolve and retain Aggron's Sturdy, then hit them with a STAB Head Smash. This will prevent a Mega Charizard Y from OHKOing, and maintain Rock-type STAB so you can OHKO Mega Charizard X or 2HKO after a Will-O-Wisp. Against opposing Mega Lopunny, don't use Metal Burst, as this can potentially let them gain the advantage with moves like Substitute or Encore. Just mega evolve and use Heavy Slam for a comfortable 2HKO. When up against Pokemon like Jumpluff and Porygon2, neutralize them with Taunt as soon as possible, and then KO them with Heavy Slam or Metal Burst.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Aggron's lack of Special Defense can really put it at a disadvantage against Pokemon that can negate Sturdy before it can attack, such as Primarina and Mega Blastoise, so a specially bulky teammate like Mega Gardevoir or Togekiss would cover that weakness greatly. In exchange, Mega Aggron can provide an immunity to Poison-type attacks from Pokemon like Naganadel and Nihilego and good physical bulk to make up for its teammate's lack of it, which would otherwise lose to other Steel-types like Kartana. Pokemon like Greninja and Zeraora can make up for Mega Aggron's lack of Speed, dealing with Pokemon like Volcarona, while Mega Aggron compensates for their lack of bulk by beating strong Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Darmanitan and Haxorus. Mega Aggron is easily dealt with by very physically bulky Pokemon such as Kommo-o and Mega Venusaur, so strong special attackers like Porygon-Z and Tapu Lele pair perfectly with Mega Aggron. In exchange, Mega Aggron beats Pokemon with massive Special Defense, such as Mega Gardevoir and Araquanid. Fake Out or Mold Breaker Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Excadrill can deal with other Sturdy Pokemon like Golem, Magnezone, and Carracosta, which pose a threat to Mega Aggron. In exchange, Mega Aggron can deal with strong Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Victini and Garchomp.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Head Smash is essential for a high-Base Power Continental Crush able to KO Pokemon like both Mega Charizard X and Y and Incineroar. Rock Tomb is primarily used to lower the Speed of Dragonite while breaking its Multiscale. It is also useful for foes like non-Seismic Toss or Barrier + Kee Berry Mew so that Screech can lower their defenses. Screech is helpful for softening up foes too bulky for Aggron to beat normally, like Porygon2, Type: Null, and Z-Conversion Porygon-Z. Heavy Slam is necessary for Tapu Lele, as well as easing the matchup against Mega Gardevoir. It is also useful for non-Iron Head Mega Mawile. Metal Burst can be run to beat Choice item users like Genesect, Choice Band Garchomp, and especially Choice Scarf Dragonite. Taunt is another option in order to beat non-Seismic Toss Kee Berry Mew and stall Deoxys-S.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>208 HP EVs along with 52 Special Defense EVs let Aggron tank Earthquake + Extreme Speed from Dragonite and Breakneck Blitz + Shadow Ball from Porygon-Z. 156 Speed EVs let Aggron outspeed Adamant Dragonite after a Speed drop from Rock Tomb. The rest are put into Attack for maximum damage output.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In general, Aggron is going to want to attack a Pokemon only when they are put range of Continental Crush by Screech or Rock Tomb. Screech should be used against slower and bulkier Pokemon, like Celesteela and Porygon2, while Rock Tomb is most useful against Choice Band variants of Dragonite. Rockium Z Aggron looks the same as Mega Aggron at Team Preview but beats a few foes that Mega Aggron can't, like Volcarona and Incineroar. This lets Rockium Z Aggron lure in and defeat these Pokemon. Additionally, Mega Aggron has very unreliable win chances against both Mega Charizard X and Y, so Rockium Z Aggron can bait Charizard to an extent as well. Against Porygon-Z, use Screech followed by Continental Crush to beat it in case it uses Z-Conversion. Against bulky Pokemon like Type: Null and Porygon2, Aggron will need to use Screech twice before attacking in order to KO with Continental Crush. Against Type: Null, although Screech can miss, it has far greater PP than Iron Defense and Type: Null cannot threaten Aggron offensively, so eventually you will be able to put it in range of Continental Crush. Against non-Iron Head Mega Mawile, use Screech at first to avoid Metal Burst and Sucker Punch. This matchup is far from reliable, though, because if Mawile never uses Metal Burst and instead keeps attacking, Aggron will be forced to either try to PP stall Sucker Punch with Screech or use Heavy Slam, which runs the risk of Mawile using Metal Burst. If Metal Burst is ran, Aggron will need to predict if Dragonite is holding a Choice Scarf or not and use either Rock Tomb or Metal Burst accordingly. It should be noted that while Aggron can usually force an Earthquake from non-Choice Scarf Dragonite variants, experienced players can simply use their Z-Move followed by an Earthquake to KO it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Aggron is very weak to bulky Water-types like Mega Gyarados, Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Mega Slowbro. Electric- and Grass-types like Zapdos and Tapu Bulu can cover this weakness while benefiting from Aggron's ability to beat offensive wallbreakers like Mega Charizard X, Dragonite, and Normalium Z Porygon-Z. Aggron is deathly weak to Ground-types like Zygarde, Landorus-T, and Donphan, so Water- and Grass-types like Manaphy and Serperior can be valuable partners. In return, Aggron can beat Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, fast Choice Band Victini, and Crustle. Opposing Steel-types like Magearna, Magnezone, Celesteela, and Heatran can wall Rockium Z Aggron very easily, so Fire- and Ground-types like Mega Blaziken and Zygarde partner well with it. In return, Aggron can help these Pokemon with threats such as Dragonite, Meloetta, and Clefable.</p> "

However, Mega Medicham has trouble with faster Pokemon and common Choice Scarf users such as Mega Blaziken, Greninja, Porygon-Z, and Jirachi because its bulk makes it unable to take a hit from these Pokemon. It struggles with bulky Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Mew, Mega Slowbro, Aegislash, and Mega Gengar, as it either fails to do damage to them or gets outstalled. Mega Medicham cannot get past walls like Mega Sableye and Clefable because they can take its attacks and slowly wear down its health. Mega Medicham also struggles to settle on one nature to use, as it needs an Adamant nature to consistently beat bulkier Pokemon like Zygarde-C and Zapdos but will no longer be able to outpace Tapu Lele and Normalium Z Porygon-Z without a Jolly nature.</p> ",

High Jump Kick takes care of Steel- and Normal-type Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Genesect, Porygon2, non-Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Meloetta, Donphan, Kommo-o, and Seperior. Zen Headbutt allows Mega Medicham to take on Mega Venusaur, Volcarona, and bulky Mega Charizard Y. Ice Punch takes care of most Flying- and Dragon-types like Landorus-T and Zygarde. Poison Jab can be used over Ice Punch for Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu, bulky Tapu Fini, Primarina, and Whimsicott and to turn the matchup against Mega Gardevoir into a coinflip with a Speed tie. Thunder Punch with an Adamant nature enables Mega Medicham to force mind games against Mega Gyarados or beat Flyinium Z variants. Rock Tomb can be used over Zen Headbutt for hitting bulky Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Having 252 Attack EVs and Pure Power turn Mega Medicham into a powerful attacker, as it can take care of walls like Porygon2 and Pokemon like non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T and non-Choice Scarf Porygon-Z.

An Adamant nature can be used to be able to take care of Zapdos, offensive Mega Metagross, and Zygarde. Mega Medicham can also almost always KO Primarina with Fake Out followed by Poison Jab. However, Mega Medicham will fail to outspeed faster Pokemon like Vivillon and Genesect.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avoid using Fake Out against Tapu Lele, which is immune due to Psychic Terrain. If Mega Medicham is not running Ice Punch, it cannot beat Landorus-T, so you should be careful about sending it out if a teammate does not pressure it. Only send Mega Medicham in on Pokemon like Primarina, Zapdos, and Zygarde-C if you are running an Adamant nature, as Mega Medicham only can reliably beat them with Adamant. If Mega Medicham does not have a Jolly nature, be careful around Normalium Z Porygon-Z and Vivillon, as these all outpace and OHKO it. When facing Serperior, be sure to Fake Out turn one to scout for Protect. If Serperior does not use Protect turn one, then use Ice Punch, as the chip damage from Fake Out will be enough to knock Serperior out. If Serperior does use Protect turn one, use High Jump Kick to avoid losing half of Mega Medicham's health to crash damage and have it taken care of by Leaf Storm. Avoid walls like Mega Sableye, Deoxys-S, and Clefable because all of them can slowly wear Mega Medicham down and take care of it. If the opponent has a fast Pokemon like Greninja or a common Choice Scarf user like Porygon-Z, Genesect, or Jirachi, avoid picking Mega Medicham, as it will be unable to take care of these Pokemon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon like Porygon-Z and Meloetta can take care of offensive Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y for Mega Medicham. In return, Mega Medicham can take on Steel-types like Heatran, Genesect, and Ferrothorn for them.

Its amazing natural bulk allows it to tank both physical and special attacks while simultaneously recovering 50% of its health with Roost. After Mega Evolving, it gains Pixilate for a powerful STAB attack in Hyper Voice. Mega Altaria also has access to useful setup and coverage moves between Cotton Guard and Fire Blast, which aid it in withstanding damage from the many powerful physical attackers that occupy 1v1 such as Mega Charizard X, Landorus-T, and Mega Heracross as well as taking on certain Steel-types that resist its STAB Hyper Voice such as Genesect and Kartana. However, Poison-types such as Naganadel and Mega Venusaur, Steel-types such as Heatran, and Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Magearna threaten it.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunder Punch is a necessity for many of the bulky Water-types that do not take enough damage from Mega Metagross's Steel-type STAB attacks, particularly Mega Gyarados, non-Substitute Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Mega Blastoise. Earthquake is an essential move for combating opposing Steel-types, mainly Magnezone and rival Mega Metagross. Iron Head, while not as powerful as the popular Meteor Mash, has 100% accuracy, improving consistency against your opponents by not risking a miss. Additionally, Iron Head has a much more beneficial side effect in its 30% flinch chance, granting Mega Metagross opportunities to get a free turn of damage whenever it uses the move; this is particularly helpful for Pokemon where you really need a single spare turn to win, such as Heatran, Dragonite if you lack Ice Punch, and Magearna if you lack Substitute. Zen Headbutt can be used either as an alternative STAB move for hitting foes neutrally or as a coverage move. Like Iron Head, it also has a flinch chance, though it's only 20% as opposed to Iron Head's 30%, so it's not really something that can be relied on as effectively for flinches. The main threats that it provides coverage for are Kommo-o and Mega Venusaur, and it is more reliable for OHKOing Naganadel. Substitute is a helpful utility move for dancing around status move users, as well as avoiding significant damage from Counter, Metal Burst, and Z-Moves. It is most useful for Magearna, Aegislash, Mega Venusaur, Celesteela, and Mega Mawile. Ice Punch is mainly just a coverage move for the threatening Dragon- and Ground-type Pokemon that occupy the metagame, namely Dragonite, Mega Altaria, and Landorus-T, although Mega Metagross will still lose to Groundium Z Landorus-T sets. Bullet Punch is a STAB priority move that helps for chipping down opposing Pokemon or following up for a KO. Bullet Punch will benefit you the most against Magnezone, Choice Specs Greninja, Mega Mawile, and Naganadel if you lack Zen Headbutt. Rock Slide can be run alongside a speedy EV spread for the purpose of catching Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona by surprise. If you're lucky, you could also get a flinch against Mega Charizard X for a 2HKO. Meteor Mash can be run on a speedy EV spread as well, 2HKOing Z-Move Mew, Choice Specs Necrozma, and putting Pheromosa and Z-Conversion Porygon-Z into Bullet Punch range.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The 248 HP and 28 Defense EVs with an Impish Nature make Mega Metagross capable of withstanding a maximum Attack Mega Gyarados's Dragon Dance-boosted Crunch. The 64 Special Defense EVs also just barely enable Mega Metagross to withstand a Timid Choice Specs Naganadel's Fire Blast, among other significant special hits like Choice Specs Greninja's Dark Pulse, Magnezone's Electrium Z-boosted Zap Cannon, and Heatran's -2 Overheat after using Substitute. The 72 Speed EVs just barely creep past maximum Speed Smeargle in order to avoid being put to sleep, as well as outspeeding Adamant Mega Gyarados in order to avoid a potential 2HKO from Crunch. The 96 Attack EVs make Thunder Punch a near-guaranteed 2HKO against maximum HP Mega Gyarados, as well as maximizing Mega Metagross's general damage output without sacrificing any essential investments. Clear Body is an essential ability before Metagross Mega Evolves because it prevents Intimidate and moves like Charm from lowering Metagross's Attack, as well as stopping moves like Electroweb, Rock Tomb, and Bulldoze from lowering its Speed.</p> <p>Mega Metagross can run maximum Attack and maximum Speed to outspeed Pokemon like Garchomp and Landorus-T and OHKO them with Ice Punch or become immune to their Ground moves with Magnet Rise. This is mandatory for both Rock Slide and Meteor Mash, as well. Outspeeding Porygon-Z also helps so that you can 2HKO it with the combination of Meteor Mash, before it boosts with Z-Conversion, and Bullet Punch. This, however, sacrifices many matchups against bulky offensive or faster Pokemon due to the bulk you sacrifice in order to do so, meaning you now lose to Mega Gyarados, Greninja, Magnezone, and Naganadel.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Metagross finds itself best suited against opposing bulky offensive threats like Dragonite, Mega Gyarados, Meloetta, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Mawile. In most scenarios against offensive Pokemon like Mega Gyarados, Dragonite, and Greninja, Mega Metagross wants to deal as much damage as possible as fast as possible because these Pokemon often don't use moves that it would be beneficial to use Substitute against. In scenarios against certain Pokemon that rely on a single powerful attack or aim to hinder Mega Metagross with status moves, such as Primarina and stall Celesteela, using Substitute immediately will help you be able to negate these moves so that you can go for the KO unhindered; however, some Pokemon possess the means to break its Substitutes, which means some predictions may be required, namely against foes like Aegislash and Hidden Power Fire Mega Venusaur. Against Magearna, you're best suited using Earthquake Turn 1 in order to get as much damage off as possible before it uses Iron Defense, as well as 2HKO it in the event that it's a Choice Specs set, then following up with Substitute so that it can't recover its HP by using Pain Split. Even though Greninja is a Water-type, it loses that typing upon using Dark Pulse, which means that you're better off using Mega Metagross's Steel STAB attack, rather than Thunder Punch; even if they use Hydro Cannon to resist Steel, they'll be stuck recharging the next turn, making them easy to pick off with Thunder Punch. Be forewarned that you will need Bullet Punch in order to reliably 2HKO Greninja if it uses Dark Pulse, as Iron Head does not have a reliable OHKO chance. Additionally, Greninja may opt to use Hidden Power Fire to resist Mega Metagross's Steel attacks, but this leaves it susceptible to being knocked out by Earthquake, thus making the matchup more reliant on predictions if you're unfamiliar with the set or if they're running both Hidden Power Fire and Dark Pulse. Against Altaria, Ice Punch is often the ideal move to start with, as most Altaria will not Mega Evolve immediately out of fear of a Steel-type STAB attack, and try to set up defensively with Cotton Guard; even if they do Mega Evolve, it's still very feasible for Iron Head to pick up the 2HKO on the next turn even if Mega Altaria is at +3 unless they're running a lot of Defense investment. Against Mega Mawile, using either Bullet Punch or Substitute immediately is the best option, as most Mawile wouldn't think to use Play Rough against Mega Metagross, nor can it even reliably break Mega Metagross's Substitute, unless they have near-maximum Attack or Fire Fang. Bullet Punch's utility is to outprioritize Sucker Punch as well as minimize damage taken from a potential Metal Burst. In certain unfavorable situations, like being up against a Zygarde or Air Balloon Heatran, your only option will be to go for the unlikely odds of a 30% Iron Head flinch, which would put Zygarde in range of an Ice Punch 2HKO and pop Heatran's Air Balloon so that you can finish it off with Earthquake. The biggest downside of using Mega Metagross is that it will often find itself needing coverage moves that it doesn't have room for, such as Ice Punch for Dragonite, Zen Headbutt for Kommo-o, and Bullet Punch for Magnezone. Don't be afraid to switch up moves on Mega Metagross to cover whatever weaknesses your team may have at a given point in time.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Water-types like Mega Gyarados, Mega Slowbro, Primarina, and Tapu Fini cover Mega Metagross's weaknesses to Fire- and Ground-types like Charizard, Heatran, Donphan, and Garchomp very well, while Mega Metagross in turn aids the Water-types by resisting and tanking hits from the Grass- and Electric-types they're weak to, namely Mega Venusaur, Magnezone, and Zeraora. Stall-oriented Pokemon like Mega Slowbro, Zygarde, Jumpluff, Kee Berry Mew, Mega Altaria, and Mega Venusaur work well with Mega Metagross, as it covers many of the most viable Taunt users in the metagame such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Gardevoir, Kommo-o, and Tapu Fini, while most of Mega Metagross's weaknesses are either stall users themselves or bulky offensive Pokemon that have little answer to being stalled down, like Mega Charizard X and Y, Landorus-T, and Donphan. Dragonite is a suitable partner for Mega Metagross, as it can handle the Fire- and Ground-types that threaten Mega Metagross, as well as Z-Conversion Porygon-Z. In return, Mega Metagross aids Dragonite in handling the threatening Fairy-types and Mold Breaker Pokemon that present Dragonite with issues.</p> "

  "Registeel": {
    "overview": "<p>Registeel's viability stems from its immense bulk coupled with its excellent defensive typing, providing it with the defensive capacity to withstand attacks from many of the top-tier threats of the 1v1 metagame between Pokemon like non-Choice Band Dragonite, Choice Specs Greninja, Mega Metagross, non-Nasty Plot Porygon-Z, and Primarina. Moves that boost either of Registeel's defenses allow it to keep up with or even outpace many of the common Pokemon that utilize their own setup moves like Magearna, Tapu Lele, non-Choice Band Zeraora, and Togekiss. The raw PP of all of Registeel's moves even gives it an advantage against other stall Pokemon, such as Mega Slowbro, non-Taunt Mega Sableye, Mega Venusaur, and Type: Null, as it will survive long enough to eventually force the foe to knock itself out by using Struggle. Unfortunately, as a stall-oriented Pokemon, Registeel faces issues against Taunt users like Mega Gyarados, Torrent Greninja, Kee Berry Mew, Kommo-o, and Tapu Fini that block it from setting it up and healing off damage. Additionally, as a Steel-type, Registeel faces severe weaknesses to the common and powerful offensive types of Fire, Ground, and Fighting, which are utilized by prevalent threats like Mega Charizard X and Y, Zygarde, Landorus-T, Victini, Mega Lopunny, and Pheromosa.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Registeel has no other viable options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Registeel has the unfortunate weaknesses of Fire, Ground, and Fighting, all of which are common and powerful types that easily overwhelm Registeel, despite its immense bulk. Common examples for Fire-types are Mega Charizard X and Y, Victini, Mega Blaziken, Volcarona, and Incineroar. Ground-type attackers include Choice Band Dragonite, Zygarde, Landorus-T, Donphan, and Garchomp. Fighting-type users primarily consist of Mega Lopunny, Pheromosa, Sawk, Choice Band Kartana, and Choice Band Zeraora.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Because Registeel is heavily dependent upon its three status moves, Taunt users that either stall out Seismic Toss or KO it first can present issues. The main Pokemon that threaten Registeel with Taunt include Mega Gyarados, Torrent Greninja, Kee Berry Mew, Kommo-o, Tapu Fini, Victini, Heatran, Mega Sableye, Mega Tyranitar, and Whimsicott.</p> <p><strong>Critical Hits: As a stall-oriented Pokemon, Registeel can very easily have its day ruined by a poorly timed critical hit. Additionally, there are a couple of Pokemon like Meloetta and Aegislash that can force critical hits with the move Laser Focus in order to bypass Registeel's boosts and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Overwhelming Offense: As bulky as Registeel is, there are still some Pokemon that set up to +6 to match its boosts and overwhelm it by dealing enough damage to 3HKO it while it's asleep like Earthquake Crustle, Waterium Z Carracosta, and Earthquake Mega Pinsir.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Amnesia is one of Registeel's two defensive boosting moves, boosting its Special Defense by two stages in order to avoid KOs from special attackers like Genesect, Serperior, Timid Naganadel, and Choice Specs Necrozma. Iron Defense is Registeel's other boosting move, allowing it to withstand physical attacks from the likes of non-Choice Band Dragonite, Mega Metagross, and Choice Scarf Haxorus. Rest is Registeel's sole recovery move, allowing it to heal off damage before being KOed, with the sleep turns also aiding it in PP stalling opposing stall Pokemon like Jumpluff, Type: Null, and Kyurem. Seismic Toss is Registeel's best damaging move, dealing damage based on level, rather than its underwhelming offensive stats. Counter allows Registeel to heavily damage physical attackers that might otherwise overwhelm it, like Choice Band Dragonite, Choice Band Zeraora, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Pinsir.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>172 EVs in Defense coupled with 248 HP allow Registeel to avoid the 3HKO from Dragonite's +4 Earthquake after boosting to +6 Defense. 88 EVs in Special Defense alongside the HP investment ensure that Registeel isn't KOed by Timid Naganadel's Fire Blast after using Amnesia. Leftovers effectively acts as extra bulk that allows the previous two points to be possible, in addition to preventing Registeel from losing to being locked into Encore by Primarina and Togekiss. Clear Body prevents Registeel's stats from being lowered, which is useful for blocking Metal Sound from the likes of Aegislash, Magnezone, and Celesteela.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>An important thing to note in PP stall matchups against Magearna, Mega Slowbro, Type: Null, and Mega Scizor is that you want Registeel to use Rest whenever it's at less than full HP so that you can save as much as possible, since Rest doesn't put Registeel to sleep otherwise. Against Rest Mega Slowbro and Type: Null, in particular, you need to play carefully, because Registeel actually ties them on PP. After both sides use up all of their boosting PP, Registeel wins by repeatedly using Rest, because it would either gain extra turns from sleeping or eventually KO them with Seismic Toss after they use up all of their Rest PP. This strategy can be a bit reliant on RNG against Mega Slowbro, as Registeel would be hoping for a Scald burn or critical hit so that it can use Rest at least six times. Against Choice Scarf Porygon-Z and Togekiss, it is ideal to use Seismic Toss on the first turn, so that you can KO them in the event that they try to lock Registeel into its first move with Trick. Even if Porygon-Z turns out to be a Z-Conversion set, Registeel can withstand just about any attack and boost up its Special Defense with Amnesia to stall it down. Against Primarina, it is ideal to use Amnesia on the first turn, even if you expect it to run Encore, as Registeel will eventually boost its Special Defense so much that Primarina's attacks won't be able to outdamage Leftovers recovery. Against non-Choice Band Zeraora, it is ideal to lead with Iron Defense, as a majority of them use physically oriented sets. However, if Zeraora uses Charge, it may potentially be a mixed set with Electrium Z and Thunder, meaning you should use Amnesia on the next turn. While the boosted Gigavolt Havoc will deal a lot of damage, Registeel is just bulky enough to withstand the following attack and can safely use Rest and eventually get to a comfortable position to KO with Seismic Toss.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Registeel pairs well with Water-types like Mega Gyarados, Greninja, Mega Slowbro, Primarina, and Tapu Fini, as these Pokemon cover Registeel's glaring weaknesses to the Fire- and Ground-types that occupy the metagame. In return, Registeel covers their weaknesses to Grass- and Electric-types like non-Choice Band Zeraora, Magnezone, Mega Venusaur, Serperior, and Ferrothorn. Registeel also appreciates partners like Dragonite, Magearna, Tapu Lele, and Clefable that cover its weakness to Fighting-types. In return, Registeel can go head to head with many of the Steel-types like opposing Magearna, Mega Metagross, non-Laser Focus Aegislash, and Celesteela that would otherwise threaten these partners. While Registeel is considerably bulky, it still struggles with the plethora of Pokemon that use Earthquake, so it likes to have physically bulky teammates like Mega Slowbro, Zygarde, Mega Altaria, and Mega Sableye that can deal with them. In turn, Registeel can handle the special attackers like Choice Specs Greninja, Porygon-Z, Mega Gardevoir, Primarina, and Serperior that would otherwise overwhelm them.</p> "

Furthermore, a wide variety of status moves allow it to cripple Pokemon that may otherwise overwhelm it like Primarina and Incineroar. However, while Mega Latias does have extremely high base stats, its poor typing causes it to be hit super effectively by many prevalent Pokemon like Mega Gardevoir and Mega Charizard X. Additionally, due to its reliance on Calm Mind and Charm, Mega Latias is shut down by bulky Taunt users like Mega Gyarados and Tapu Fini.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Latias can run an alternative set with Draco Meteor, Reflect Type, Charm, and Roost to gain an advantage over Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X.

Substitute is an option instead of Draco Meteor to deal with Magearna, status users like Porygon2, and Zapdos, and FEAR users like Aron.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster or Extremely Bulky Dragon-types: While Mega Latias does have immense bulk, it is not enough to take powerful STAB Outrages or Draco Meteors from Pokemon like Dragonite, Choice Scarf Haxorus, and Naganadel.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks: Pokemon with hard-hitting super effective moves like Aegislash, Mega Gardevoir, Hoopa-U, Choice Band Pheromosa, and Volcarona are able to OHKO Mega Latias without allowing it to set up.</p> <p><strong>Overwhelming Offense: Pokemon like Meloetta, Metal Sound Celesteela, Crustle, and Choice Band Archeops, which have extremely high offensive presence and either outspeed Mega Latias or survive its attacks, are able to KO Mega Latias without even needing to use super effective moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster SubSeed Users: Faster Pokemon with Leech Seed like Serperior and Jumpluff are able to get Leech Seed off without being OHKOed and then outstall Mega Latias's Roost.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: While Mega Latias is able to break through certain Steel-types like Magnezone and Heatran, Steel-type Pokemon with setup moves like Registeel can outstall Mega Latias in a setup war, while Steel-type Pokemon that can hit it super effectively like Mega Mawile and Genesect are able to OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users: Taunt users like Mega Gyarados, Kee Berry Mew, Tapu Fini, Mega Sableye, Mega Tyranitar, and Whimsicott are able to prevent Mega Latias's status moves and eventually defeat it.</p> ",

Roost allows Mega Latias to heal damage taken from specially attacking Pokemon like Mega Altaria while boosting its Special Defense to eventually take negligible damage from them. Draco Meteor allows Mega Latias to OHKO many prevalent Pokemon like Zygarde, Greninja, Blacephalon, and Garchomp. Reflect Type can be another option instead of Draco Meteor to take on Pokemon Mega Latias would normally struggle against like non-Taunt Mega Aggron, Mega Metagross, and Magearna while also solidifying matchups such as against Substitute stalling Venusaur and Ferrothorn. Charm is another option that allows Mega Latias to defeat physical attackers like bulky Flame Charge Mega Charizard X and Buzzwole.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mega Latias has a great ability in Levitate, which allows it to defeat Ground-reliant attackers like Tectonic Rage Landorus-T, Donphan, and Golem, which some other bulky setup Pokemon like Registeel would struggle against. 32 HP and 12 Special Defense EVs allow Mega Latias to tank neutral-natured Choice Specs Greninja's Ice Beam. 232 Speed EVs and a Timid nature let Mega Latias outspeed Modest Greninja and Blacephalon, which would otherwise OHKO it. 232 Special Attack EVs allow Mega Latias to OHKO specially defensive Kommo-o, Blacephalon, and Greninja using Draco Meteor.</p> <p>If you run Charm or Reflect Type, use an EV spread of 184 HP / 72 Def / 252 Spe with a Timid nature to maximize physical bulk and to defeat Mega Lopunny, Supersonic Skystrike Landorus-T, Magearna, Mega Aggron, and Mega Metagross, as well as Mega Gyarados and Mega Charizard X without Taunt and Dragon Dance, respectively.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against Steel-types that learn Metal Sound like Magnezone and Heatran, Mega Latias should first use Calm Mind two times, then use Stored Power followed by Draco Meteor. The Normalium Z Porygon-Z matchup is a risky one, on account of mind games between using Reflect Type on Porygon-Z to become a Normal-type before it uses Z-Conversion to transform into a Ghost-type and using Calm Mind in anticipation of Breakneck Blitz.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon with a Steel / Fairy typing like Mega Mawile and Magearna make for good teammates, as they can deal with Fairy- and Dark-types, as well as bulky offensive threats like Tapu Lele, Mega Gardevoir, Crustle, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Heracross, while Mega Latias can cover their weaknesses to foes like Zygarde, Donphan, and Magnezone. Heatran serves as a uniquely good partner for Mega Latias. Mega Latias appreciates Heatran's ability to deal with Fairy-types like Gardevoir and Tapu Lele, Steel-types like Mega Mawile and Mega Metagross, and other threats to Mega Latias like offensive Mega Charizard X, Substitute stalling Serperior, and Porygon-Z. Heatran in return appreciates Mega Latias's ability to OHKO threats like Greninja, Zygarde, Kommo-o, and Garchomp as well as outstall Water-types like Primarina and non-Taunt Tapu Fini. Shell Smash users with Sturdy like Crustle and Carracosta make for good teammates, as they can deal with offensive Pokemon like Porygon-Z, Mega Gardevoir, and both formes of Mega Charizard. Crustle and Carracosta in return appreciate Mega Latias's ability to deal with certain Sturdy users like Magnezone and Donphan as well as bulky Dragon-types like Zygarde and Kommo-o. Physically bulky Pokemon like Mega Slowbro and Mega Tyranitar make for good teammates, as they are able to deal with strong physical hitters; otherwise, Mega Latias would not be able to deal with foes like Crustle, Mega Charizard X, and Dragonite.

  "Latios": {
    "overview": "<p>Latios has an interesting role in 1v1, being one of the two Pokemon with a Dragon / Psychic typing alongside Latias. Its decent special bulk allows it to take hits from bulky offensive Pokemon like Primarina and Celesteela as well as offensive nukes that it resists like Blast Burn from Mega Charizard Y, and its typing and ability also let it resist key attacks from Fire-, Ground-, and Electric-types such as Heatran, Mega Camerupt, Donphan, and Xurkitree. Latios's diverse movepool also allows it to KO a variety of foes, such as Kommo-o, Heatran, Tapu Fini, and Kee Berry Mew. On the other hand, Latios's typing leaves it weak to Fairy-, Dark- and Steel-types like Mega Gardevoir, Hoopa-U, and offensive Mega Metagross. Additionally, it relies way too much on a predictable Choice Specs set that bulky offense staples can easily be EVed to tank hits from, while it in return cannot EV itself to survive hits from Pokemon like Greninja and Mega Lopunny. Furthermore, Latios's moves don't have a high Base Power, so they need the boost from Choice Specs to OHKO or 2HKO common threats. Lastly, Latios is almost outclassed by Naganadel because of the latter's Poison-type STAB to beat common Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir, its high Speed stat to outspeed faster threats like Serperior, and stronger Fire-type coverage to help with Steel-types like Mega Mawile and Magearna. Latios's only redeeming qualities over Naganadel are its ability in Levitate, immunizing it to STAB attacks from common Ground-type staples like Donphan and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and its Psychic-type coverage, which can help against Poison- and Fighting-types like Mega Venusaur and Mega Blaziken.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Latios can use a Choice Scarf set with a Modest nature to outspeed and KO faster Pokemon such as Greninja, Naganadel, and Mega Lopunny.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Latios's Dragon-type STAB attack used to nuke threats in one or two turns. Pokemon that are susceptible to this move include Mega Charizard Y, Zygarde-C, Kommo-o, and non-Choice Scarf Garchomp. Thunderbolt is used to hit Water- and Flying-types such as Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Celesteela super effectively. Notably, it is also able to hit Heatran for neutral damage, whilst the rest of Latios's moves are not effective versus it. Psychic is mainly used to beat Poison- and Fighting-types, namely Mega Venusaur and Mega Heracross. Hidden Power Fire, because of its low Base Power, is used against Pokemon that are 4x weak to Fire-type moves such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, as well as non-Mirror Coat Magnezone. Shadow Ball is an interesting option over Hidden Power Fire that gives Latios a way to hit Psychic-types like bulky Tapu Lele, bulky non-Bullet Punch Mega Metagross, and Kee Berry Mew while forgoing the Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor matchups. Trick is another option, losing out on the matchups that Hidden Power Fire allows Latios to win yet gaining the win versus most stall-based Pokemon like Type: Null. Energy Ball can be run over over Thunderbolt to OHKO Mega Swampert and Quagsire.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>32 HP EVs are invested to take a Moonblast followed by a Torrent-boosted Aqua Jet from Primarina. The remainder of the EVs are invested into Special Attack to maximize Latios's power with a neutral nature to make it the most threatening to the metagame it is capable of being, allowing it to 3HKO most Heatran. 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Latios to outspeed Durant and Kartana and OHKO them. Levitate gives Latios immunity to Ground-type STAB from Pokemon like Landorus-T, Donphan, and Krookodile.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Psychic is notable in that it can 2HKO physically defensive Mega Altaria reliably, allowing you to beat Hyper Voice variants, the most common type. Some Dragon-type Pokemon, which Latios can normally OHKO, can run variants in order to catch Latios by surprise, such as Choice Scarf Garchomp. Specially defensive Mega Charizard X is not a reliable matchup, as it can stay in its base forme turn one, use Flame Charge or Dragon Dance to boost its Speed, and OHKO Latios turn two with Outrage after Mega Evolving. Despite Tapu Fini and Primarina's access to Moonblast, Latios can use Thunderbolt twice to KO them while taking a hit from them because of their lack of Special Attack investment. Don't use Draco Meteor against Sturdy Pokemon like Donphan and non-Mirror Coat Magnezone, as Psychic can already 2HKO them in most cases, and you don't want the chance to miss.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Physically defensive Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro, Registeel, and Ferrothorn make superb partners for Latios, as it is lacking in HP and Defense stats. In return, Latios provides a higher damage output to take out bulkier threats that these Pokemon can't deal with, such as Mega Charizard Y, non-Choice Scarf Genesect, and Heatran. Also, Fairy-types such as Mega Mawile, Mega Altaria, Mega Gardevoir, Magearna, and Mega Diancie can cover Dragon-types and Dark-types such as Dragonite, Haxorus, Mega Gyarados, and Hoopa-U with their STAB moves. Furthermore, Steel-types such as Celesteela, Mega Metagross, Ferrothorn, and Kartana can hit Fairy- and Ice-types that Latios is weak to while also resisting Bug-, Dragon-, and Ice-type attacks. Examples of these types include Mega Gardevoir, Alolan Ninetales, Crustle, and bulky Dragonite. Heatran, notably, can lure in Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Donphan, beat Steel- and Fairy-types like Mega Mawile, Mega Gardevoir, and Tapu Lele, which Latios lacks the ability to in most cases, and also take out specially defensive Mega Charizard X, which most other Steel-types can't do.</p> "

  "Jirachi": {
    "overview": "<p>Jirachi's niche in 1v1 stems from the combination of its bulk and Speed tier that allow it to take on multiple top-tier threats, such as Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Tapu Lele, and Meloetta, alongside its incredible ability in Serene Grace and the two moves that it uses to take advantage of it. Serene Grace is an important factor to Jirachi's success, as it greatly increases Jirachi's odds of winning matchups that it would otherwise struggle in, such as against Tapu Fini, Kommo-o, Crustle, and Hoopa-U, through multiple flinches. Jirachi also has access to multiple coverage moves that aid it in handling Pokemon that can deal with its STAB attacks like Dragonite, Genesect, and Chansey. Unfortunately, Jirachi's STAB attacks aren't perfectly reliable for every matchup. Any matchup that Jirachi doesn't win by raw type advantage or move power alone are often subject to the random chance of whether or not Jirachi lands a flinch or multiple consecutive flinches. The main examples of this include Mega Charizard Y, Magearna, and Zeraora. Jirachi is also not gifted with the best offensive presence, as multiple top-tier threats like Mega Charizard X, Mega Gyarados, and Greninja resist Jirachi's Steel-type STAB attacks and aren't stopped by its coverage without extraordinary luck.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Z-Happy Hour set can be used with an EV spread of 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe, a Hasty nature, and the moves of Iron Head, Thunderbolt, and Psychic to help take care of walls like Serperior with Psychic. However, forgoing Fire Punch means Jirachi will lose to Pokemon like Genesect. Thunder Wave with Colbur Berry allows Jirachi to attempt a paraflinching strategy on Dark-types in particular, like Greninja and Hoopa-U; however, Jirachi can no longer take care of Jumpluff and Choice Band Haxorus. Leftovers with Substitute, Thunderbolt, Psyshock, and Calm Mind with an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe can be used in order to take on passive Pokemon like Chansey; however, Jirachi will be unable to take care of Ferrothorn and Genesect. Steelium Z with Doom Desire can be good to take care of Magearna, but Jirachi can no longer beat Mega Medicham and outpace and take advantage of Iron Head flinches against Choice Scarf Haxorus.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks: Fire-, Ground-, or Dark-types like Mega Charizard X, Mega Gyarados, and Greninja are able to take care of Jirachi with their STAB attacks and resist its STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon: Bulky Pokemon such as Mega Metagross, Celesteela, Aegislash, Zygarde-C, Primarina, and Magnezone, as well as walls like Type: Null, Mega Slowbro, and Porygon2, can tank any of Jirachi's attacks and either stall it out or KO it out before it can do the same to them.</p> <p><strong>Bypassing Flinches: There are ways multiple Pokemon can negate Jirachi's flinches, such as through priority like Sucker Punch Mega Mawile and Prankster Sableye and Whimsicott, by outspeeding it like Deoxys-S and Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and through Inner Focus like Mega Gallade.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Iron Head is Jirachi's main STAB move that it uses for dealing with the Fairy-types that occupy 1v1 like Mega Gardevoir and Tapu Lele, and its effective 60% flinch chance from Serene Grace allows it to take on opposing Pokemon like Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Tapunium Z Tapu Fini, and Haxorus that would all normally take Jirachi down before it could do the same to them. Heart Stamp is Jirachi's Psychic-type STAB attack and is mainly used against foes that are weak to it or resist Iron Head and cannot be dispatched by its coverage moves, namely Zeraora, Kommo-o, Mega Venusaur, and Naganadel. Like Iron Head, Heart Stamp is also equipped with a 30% base flinch chance that is doubled to 60% by Serene Grace. Zen Headbutt can be used over Heart Stamp to enable Jirachi to 2HKO Pokemon like Kommo-o and OHKO Naganadel. Fire Punch gives Jirachi a way to deal with Steel-types like Genesect and Ferrothorn that resist both of its STAB attacks. Ice Punch allows Jirachi to 2HKO Dragonite and OHKO Jumpluff. Trick can be used to shut down walls such as Chansey, making them unable to use moves like Soft-Boiled.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack EVs make Jirachi's attacks as strong as possible. With 252 Speed EVs, a Jolly nature, and a Choice Scarf, Jirachi outpaces Choice Scarf users like Haxorus, Porygon-Z, and Genesect. An Adamant nature can be used over a Jolly nature to help KO Pokemon in one less turn like Naganadel and Kommo-o, as well as 2HKO Mega Medicham; however, Jirachi would be unable to outpace Jolly Choice Scarf Haxorus and Adamant Choice Scarf Garchomp, which can 2HKO it with Earthquake. 4 Special Defense EVs prevent Genesect from getting a Special Attack boost with Download. The ability Serene Grace allows Jirachi to beat many more threats that it couldn't before like Mega Medicham, Primarina, and Tapu Fini with a greater flinch chance on Iron Head and Heart Stamp.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avoid relying on Jirachi to beat Zygarde, Landorus-T, or Earthquake Mega Metagross, as Ice Punch and Fire Punch respectively will be unable to OHKO these bulky threats. Pokemon that Jirachi needs only one flinch to win against such as Naganadel, Mega Medicham, Counter Crustle, and Hoopa-U are good to send it out against; however, if they do move, Jirachi will be OHKOed by their attacks. Pokemon that require more than one flinch but cannot OHKO Jirachi such as Choice Scarf Haxorus, Tapu Fini, and Primarina are also good for Jirachi to take on. Pokemon that Jirachi has to rely on flinching more than once to not get OHKOed such as Garchomp, Choice Band Haxorus and Donphan are not wise to send it out against.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Jirachi needs partners that can take care of Fire-types like Mega Blaziken, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran, so Pokemon like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Haxorus, Primarina, and Tapu Fini are good partners for it. In return, Jirachi can take care of Genesect, Ferrothorn, and Jumpluff. Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Mega Gardevoir are able to take care of Fighting-types like Sawk and Mega Blaziken. In return, Jirachi can take care of Genesect and Naganadel for them. Walls like Mega Slowbro and Deoxys-S are able to take on bulky Steel-types like Mega Metagross and Magearna. In return, Jirachi can take on Jumpluff for Mega Slowbro and Tapu Fini for Deoxys-S. Pokemon like Porygon-Z, Greninja, Tapu Lele, and Serperior can pressure Ground-types that trouble Jirachi such as Zygarde, Landorus-T, and Donphan from being picked. In return, Jirachi can take on Fighting-types such as Sawk for Porygon-Z and Greninja and take care of Togekiss for Serperior.</p> "

  "Deoxys-Speed": {
    "overview": "<p>Deoxys-S is the naturally fastest Pokemon in the 1v1 metagame, allowing it to outpace and set up against or KO Pokemon like Donphan, Mega Charizard Y, Kommo-o, and Pheromosa. Access to a wide variety of moves, including powerful defensive moves like Iron Defense and Amnesia and powerful offensive moves such as Psycho Boost as well as BoltBeam, makes it highly versatile and unpredictable. Using its defensive set, it can beat many Pokemon that don't boost their offenses with a status move like Mega Charizard Y and Donphan, as well as stall Pokemon that are weak to Taunt like Jumpluff. Its offensive set can beat many Pokemon that are weak to its STAB Psychic-type moves like Kommo-o and Mega Venusaur or are weak to a coverage move it carries like Garchomp. Unfortunately, besides its Speed, Deoxys-S has average stats that hold back its sets from being too powerful or too bulky, making it a suboptimal pick when Speed is not being considered. Because it also relies on Taunt to stop setup Pokemon, it can be forced into guessing games where it's unsure whether to use Taunt or boost its defenses against Dragon Dance users like Mega Charizard X, Taunt + Clangorous Soulblaze Kommo-o, and Shell Smash Crustle. Because of the long nature of battles with its defensive set, critical hits are inevitable and could potentially make Deoxys-S lose a winnable matchup. Deoxys-S's defenses are also still rather poor, meaning it has trouble dealing with super effective moves such as Crunch from Mega Gyarados and Never-Ending Nightmare from Aegislash, and without natural defenses it also will likely faint to critical hits. Offensively it has no way to deal with specially defensive Pokemon like Mega Metagross, which can OHKO or 2HKO Deoxys-S faster than Deoxys-S can do the same.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Psychium Z set with Reflect, Light Screen, Recover, and Psychic or Psycho Boost can be an effective combination of the two other sets that sacrifices maximum bulk and coverage for more immediate bulk and a way to end out the game earlier to avoid losing to critical hits while also beating Fighting-types like Kommo-o and Poison-types like Naganadel. Rocky Helmet can be used on the defensive set in order to drastically reduce the number of turns opposing physical attackers like Mega Charizard X, Mega Metagross, and Dragonite have to land a critical hit on Deoxys-S by making them knock themselves out in a few turns from the recoil.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: While the Choice Specs set carries Focus Blast for coverage, it's quite often not strong enough to take out bulkier Dark-types such as Crunch Mega Gyarados and Incineroar. These Pokemon also are often able to inflict a lot of damage against Deoxys-S, even after it sets up.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Deoxys-S doesn't really have an effective way of dealing with powerful Ghost-type Pokemon like Aegislash, which can KO it even after it boosts its defenses.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Bug-type Pokemon: Bug-type Pokemon like Volcarona and Genesect also can be hard for Deoxys-S to deal with, but it can manage with different moves on its Choice Specs set.</p> <p><strong>Bulkier Setup Pokemon: Dragon Dance Pokemon like Mega Charizard X can be extremely difficult for Deoxys-S to deal with, often requiring Deoxys-S to get several predictions correctly.</p> <p><strong>Fast Pokemon and Speed Control</strong>: Pokemon with a Choice Scarf such as Greninja and Jolly Haxorus outpace Deoxys-S and KO it.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Iron Defense is Deoxys-S's best move to boost its Defense, allowing it to beat most physical Pokemon that lack a way to boost their own Attack such as Donphan and Golem. Similarly, Amnesia allows Deoxys-S to beat many special Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Primarina. Taunt is useful to shut down opposing stall Pokemon such as Jumpluff by preventing them from utilizing their necessary status moves and block setup from Special Attack boosters like Magearna and Tapu Lele, as well as forcing Pokemon to waste their targeting moves first, thus PP stalling Pokemon faster. Recover is essential to the set, as it allows Deoxys-S to stall out the opposing Pokemon's attacks by alternating between its defensive move and Recover.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Deoxys-S to outpace the entire unboosted metagame so it can boost its defenses before the opposing Pokemon attacks as well as Taunt any foe before they can set up or use Taunt themselves such as Kommo-o. 252 HP EVs maximize bulk against both special and physical Pokemon. Pressure causes opposing Pokemon to use Struggle much sooner than Deoxys-S when they use a targeting move, which works excellently in tandem with Taunt. Leftovers is helpful against Mega Evolutions that do consistent damage like Mega Charizard Y, while Aguav Berry's one-time immediate recovery helps Deoxys-S stabilize the matchup against powerful Z-Moves like those from Magearna.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Deoxys-S is best used against Pokemon that lack a way to boost their offenses such Mega Charizard Y, Donphan, and Golem, but it can also be used against stall Pokemon that don't have a good way to beat Taunt users such as Mega Venusaur and Jumpluff. When facing powerful setup or Taunt users, like Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X or Mega Gyarados, mindgames will be involved, if you want to Taunt on their setup move and Taunt, or boost defensively on their attack. Deoxys-S can also outboost certain one-stage boosters such as Calm Mind Magearna and Bulk Up Zeraora, so Deoxys-S should always boost defensively turn one, then either Taunt or Recover turn two, depending on whether they attacked or set up. Often it might be preferable to wait until Deoxys-S is below 50% so you get the maximum recovery. However, if a critical hit can KO Deoxys-S at a certain health, Recover should be used earlier to ensure it doesn't fall below that health. Mixed attackers such as Zeraora and Carracosta can also be difficult to play against, as it is more difficult to predict which defensive stat to boost.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Deoxys-S appreciates teammates that can cover its Dark- and Ghost-type weakness like Genesect, which can beat Mega Gyarados, and Mega Lopunny, which can beat Aegislash. Deoxys-S in return can beat certain bulky and stall Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur that might trouble these Pokemon. Sturdy Z-Move users can help beat Choice Scarf Pokemon like Porygon-Z as well as setup Pokemon like Mega Charizard X; Deoxys-S, in return, beats Fake Out Users like Mega Lopunny and sleep users like Jumpluff that would be able to beat these Pokemon. Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X and Y and Rock-types like Golem and Crustle can be helpful in beating Bug-types like Durant and Volcarona, while Deoxys-S can usually threaten the bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and Primarina that threaten them.</p> "

Ice Beam can target Pokemon such as Garchomp, Zygarde, and Landorus-T. Thunderbolt can be used to beat Water-types like non-Crunch Mega Gyarados and Greninja more reliably. Focus Blast targets Dark-types like Mega Tyranitar alongside Greninja, as well as certain Steel-types like offensive Heatran. Shadow Ball hits certain Psychic-types like Tapu Lele. Hidden Power Fire can be helpful to beat Genesect, Ferrothorn, and Durant. Hidden Power Rock gives Deoxys-S better chances against Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. Grass Knot hits Water / Ground-types like Mega Swampert.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack EVs, a Modest nature, and Choice Specs allow Deoxys-S to deal the most damage it can with its moves.

Ambipom uses its powerful Normal-type STAB moves Fake Out and Giga Impact in conjunction with Normalium Z to overpower common bulky offense threats like Mega Charizard X and Dragonite. Its access to Tickle allows it to take on a more defensive role to take out threats such as Mega Gyarados and Incineroar. However, Ambipom suffers from its lack of coverage, since using any other moveset would trade important matchups for less significant ones. Its Normal-type moves are easily walled by Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types such as Crustle, Magearna, and Mega Aggron, and coverage moves like Low Sweep and Fire Punch are not strong enough to deal with this issue. Ambipom also lacks sufficient Speed and bulk to beat other faster threats in the metagame such as Mega Lopunny and Zeraora.

Giga Impact is a high-Base Power STAB move that gets powered up by Normalium Z to deal massive amounts of damage. After a Fake Out, it can be used to beat Dragonite and Tapu Fini, as well as immediately OHKOing most Tapu Lele. Tickle lowers the foe's Attack and Defense by one stage and allows Ambipom to win matchups against Mega Gyarados and bulky Incineroar; Normalium Z-boosted Tickle also raises Ambipom's Defense to make up for its lack of bulk while increasing its KO potential. Low Sweep is a coverage move against Rock- and Steel-types that lowers the foe's Speed and allows Ambipom to beat Mega Gyarados and Excadrill. Fire Punch is an option instead of Low Sweep, sacrificing the Mega Gyarados matchup to beat Ferrothorn and Choice Specs Genesect.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature allow Ambipom to hit as hard as possible with Fake Out and Breakneck Blitz, letting it KO Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Tapu Lele, and Meloetta. 4 Special Defense EVs deny Pokemon with the ability Download a Special Attack boost; this allows Ambipom to almost always beat offensive Choice Scarf Genesect. Maximum Speed investment is used to outspeed all unboosted base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mew, Volcarona, Mega Medicham, and both Mega Charizard formes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against Mew, if Fake Out does not activate a Kee Berry on Mew, use Breakneck Blitz to immediately KO it, as the lack of Kee Berry will indicate an offensive Mew set that will OHKO Ambipom with Genesis Supernova if given the chance. If it is a Kee Berry Mew set, use Tickle. Mega Gyarados's base ability Intimidate allows it to survive the two-hit combo, so it is necessary to lower its stats with Normalium Z-boosted Tickle after using Fake Out, damage it and lower its Speed with Low Sweep, and then KO it with Giga Impact. When facing Tapu Lele, Fake Out is unusable because of Psychic Surge, so use Breakneck Blitz on turn 1 to KO it in most cases. Against Bulk Up users like Incineroar, Ambipom should use Tickle until it successfully lowers their stats; Tickle nullifies the effect of the move Bulk Up and has more PP, so this is guaranteed. Once their stats are lowered, you can KO them with Breakneck Blitz. Against Mega Altaria, you enter a coinflip situation. If you expect Mega Altaria to use Cotton Guard, Ambipom KOes it with Breakneck Blitz followed by Giga Impact. However, if you expect Mega Altaria to use Roost to heal off the incoming Breakneck Blitz damage, Ambipom must use Tickle first to OHKO afterwards.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Ambipom has a really hard time dealing with Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types, so Pokemon that can deal with these threats like Aegislash, Heatran, and Sawk are very good teammates. Ambipom, in exchange, can beat Pokemon that threaten these partners like Mega Charizard X and Mega Gyarados. Ambipom also has trouble beating faster Pokemon like Zeraora and Mega Lopunny, which can be dealt with by bulky Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Kommo-o. The latter has a bad matchup against Pokemon like Mega Gardevoir and Tapu Lele, which Ambipom easily deals with. It also has difficulty dealing with stall Pokemon like Registeel, Mega Slowbro, and Type: Null, so Taunt users like Mega Gyarados and Mega Tyranitar are appreciated.

Its high attacking power mixed with Fake Out's chip damage allows it to reliably KO top-tier Pokemon like Mega Pinsir, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Gardevoir. High Jump Kick is another powerful STAB move that can hit Rock- and Steel-types that resist Giga Impact super effectively, like Magnezone, Heatran, and Mega Tyranitar. Encore uses Mega Lopunny's high Speed to effectively lock opposing stall or setup Pokemon like Type: Null and Kee Berry Mew into a status move, allowing it to attack freely. Ice Punch allows Mega Lopunny to hit Pokemon like Dragonite, Garchomp, and Landorus, which are often present in the higher tiers of the metagame, super effectively. Substitute also functions well alongside Encore; at the cost of either Giga Impact or High Jump Kick, it can provide better support against Pokemon like Flash Cannon Aegislash. Thunder Punch is another coverage option that allows Mega Lopunny to hit Gyarados before Mega Evolution 4x super effectively and will get it in range of a High Jump Kick if it does Mega Evolve.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Mega Lopunny to outspeed all Pokemon with a base Speed lower than 135, which includes Pokemon like Greninja, Jumpluff, and Kartana, common fast 1v1 threats. Maximum Attack investment lets it  take out as many foes as possible. The 4 Defense EVs are leftovers and serve no relevant purpose, only to marginally boost its Defense.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against Tapu Fini, you can use Fake Out into High Jump Kick to put it in KO range of Giga Impact. Aegislash is a tricky matchup thanks to King's Shield. Against non-Flash Cannon Aegislash, you can use Giga Impact, Fake Out, or the 4th coverage move until Aegislash runs out of King's Shield PP and then KO it with High Jump Kicks. In order to beat Flash Cannon Aegislash, however, you will need to win a mindgame during turn one. If Pokemon like Kee Berry Mew use status moves, you can outspeed them and lock them into the status move with Encore during the next turn; if the opposing Pokemon has Prankster or uses a priority status move, use it during the same turn. If you're carrying Thunder Punch, the play against Mega Gyarados is to use Thunder Punch turn 2, after Fake Out. If Gyarados doesn't Mega Evolve, expecting a High Jump Kick, Thunder Punch followed by another Thunder Punch will KO it regardless if it Mega Evolves on the second Thunder Punch. If it does Mega Evolve on the first Thunder Punch, use High Jump Kick afterwards.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>When teambuilding with Mega Lopunny, you'd want to include bulky Fairy-type Pokemon like Clefable and Tapu Lele, which can beat physically bulky Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Kommo-o, and Primarina and bring great complementary coverage. In return, Mega Lopunny provides good coverage for Steel-type Pokemon such as Magnezone and Heatran, which threaten these Fairy-types. It is always preferable to bring hard-hitting Pokemon like Aegislash and Blacephalon that are able to beat bulky offense Pokemon like Mega Metagross and Magearna. Mega Lopunny also helps in return by covering Sturdy Pokemon like Magneton and Golem and strong specially defensive Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y. The last good way to support Mega Lopunny is through stall Pokemon such as Whimsicott and Illumise that can beat Pokemon that outspeed Mega Lopunny, such as Zeraora, or have way too much bulk for Lopunny to deal with such as Mega Slowbro.</p> "

  "Garchomp": {
    "overview": "<p>Garchomp comes with a great stat spread. Its base 102 Speed and offensive typing allows it to run multiple sets and outspeed and defeat top-tier threats such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Tyranitar. With an immunity to Electric and key resistances to Fire- and Rock-type moves, it can also be used to beat powerful attackers such as Crustle and Victini. Its high Attack stat that can be further upgrade with Choice Band and Z-Crystal and solid offensive typing let it KO a lot of threatening Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Aegislash, Magearna, and Mega Venusaur. Garchomp has a great movepool with reliable STAB moves in Outrage and Earthquake, as well as coverage options in Poison Jab, Fire Fang, and Fire Blast to KO Pokemon like Whimsicott and Genesect. Rough Skin offers chip damage that helps it in defeating F.E.A.R. Aron. However, its 4x weakness to Ice makes it vulnerable to coverage moves carried by common threats such as Porygon-Z and Greninja. Its typing also leaves it weak to Fairy-type Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Altaria, which can take advantage of Garchomp. It is left outsped by some hard hitters like Mega Pinsir and Mega Lucario, which can OHKO regular Garchomp. Although it can defeat some Dragon-type Pokemon such as non-Choice Scarf Haxorus and Mega Charizard X, it loses to bulky Dragonite, Naganadel, and Choice Scarf Haxorus, as the former can survive a hit and OHKO back and the latter two outspeeds and OHKOes Garchomp.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragonium Z can be run in order get the power of Choice Band Garchomp while still maintaining freedom of choice against certain Pokemon such as Landorus-T, which neither Groundium Z nor Choice Band sets can hit effectively. However, given that Garchomp cannot defeat most Dragon-type Pokemon, the ones that it can are beaten by Choice Band as is, and the loss of coverage against Fairy-type Pokemon like Magearna and Tapu Lele is troublesome, Dragonium Z is mostly outclassed by its main sets. Choice Scarf boosts Garchomp's Speed, letting it defeat fast offensive threats such as Greninja and Naganadel and granting it a guaranteed win against Mega Blaziken, but without Choice Band's Attack boost or Tectonic Rage from Groundium Z, it's unable to defeat bulky Pokemon like Mega Mawile, Magearna, and Aegislash. Garchompite can be run with an EV spread of 248 HP / 176 Def / 80 SpD / 4 Spe to grant Garchomp titanic Attack and bulk, enabling it to take hits from the likes of Flail Mega Lopunny, Mega Pinsir, and Reversal Mega Lucario at the cost of 10 base Speed. It can even survive a Moonblast from Mega Diancie. However, while the loss in Speed may seem trivial at first, this drops Mega Garchomp under the base 100 Speed tier, which significantly affects its placement in the metagame, causing it to struggle against threats such as Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard X. Mega Garchomp can also run a specially defensive set with an EV spread of 200 HP / 52 Atk / 252 SpD / 4 Spe and an Adamant nature to defeat Porygon-Z, Choice Specs Necrozma, Psychium Z Tapu Lele, Primarina, and Choice Scarf Latios at the cost of losing to powerful physical attackers like Mega Charizard X and Mega Lucario. A Haban Berry set with an EV spread of 248 HP / 48 Atk / 112 Def / 96 SpD / 4 Spe with a Jolly nature and Rock Tomb / Outrage / Earthquake / Substitute can be used to defeat Dragon-types including Dragonite, Naganadel, Latios, and Haxorus but comes at the cost of Garchomp's offensive power and leaves it unable to defeat bulky Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Chansey. Corkscrew Crash with Iron Tail lets Garchomp lure in and defeat some Fairy-types that usually defeat it, namely bulky Tapu Lele and Mega Altaria.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ice-type Attacks: Ice-type moves generally OHKO Garchomp, as it is 4x weak to them. Pokemon like Porygon-Z, Mega Gyarados, Greninja, Alolan Ninetales, Avalugg, and Genesect carry Ice-type moves and are able to defeat Garchomp if they outspeed it or survive its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon: Garchomp gets outsped by some hard hitters like Greninja, Naganadel, and Choice Scarf users like Porygon-Z and Latios, which can OHKO it before it gets a chance to retaliate.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon like Mega Slowbro, Mega Sableye, and Deoxys-S can tank Mega Garchomp's hits and either wear it down by boosting their defenses and healing or KO it with their attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fairy-types: Mega Altaria and bulky Tapu Lele can take a Choice Band-boosted Poison Jab as well as Tectonic Rage from Garchomp and OHKO back with their super effective Fairy-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Greninja outspeed and OHKO Garchomp with Ice Beam, while Mega Gyarados and Primarina can take a hit from Garchomp and KO back with Ice Fang in the former's case and Moonblast or a Waterium Z-boosted STAB move for the latter.</p> ",

Earthquake lets Garchomp defeat Aegislash, non-Reversal Mega Blaziken, and Excadrill. With Tectonic Rage, Garchomp can also defeat defensive Mega Metagross as well as the faster variant without Ice Punch, Mega Mawile, Magearna, and Curse Mega Aggron. Rock Tomb's speed control lets Garchomp defeat Mega Charizard X if it doesn't Mega Evolve in order to avoid super effective damage, as well as beating Pokemon 4x weak to Rock-type moves, such as Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. Substitute helps in scouting for moves, blocking status moves like Sleep Powder from Mega Venusaur and Charm from Chansey, taking Z-Moves like Tectonic Rage from Golem and rechargeable moves from Mega Blastoise and Meloetta, and blocking Counter from Sawk, Crustle, and Chansey.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack EVs and maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allow Garchomp to hit as hard as possible while outspeeding as many Pokemon as possible, including Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Gardevoir. This specifically gives Garchomp the best odds at KOing bulky Tapu Lele. Groundium Z upgrades Earthquake into a devastating 180-Base Power Tectonic Rage. Rough Skin provides chip damage against contact move users.</p> <p>If desired, a spread of 176 Atk / 80 SpD / 252 Spe and a Jolly Nature can be run, in order to always live a Hidden Power Ice from Air Balloon Heatran and Magnezone, improving the matchups reliability, with the drop in Attack only affected bulky Tapu Lele and bulky Genesect's reliability.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Garchomp is vulnerable to Sturdy Pokemon like Donphan, Pokemon with Ice-type attacks such as Porygon-Z and Greninja, and some of the faster Pokemon like Ice Punch Mega Lopunny or Ice Beam Greninja, so avoid sending it against them. Against Charizard, start with Substitute to block Counter or Outrage and scout for the Mega Evolution. Mega Charizard Y can be KOed with Rock Tomb. If it turns out to be Mega Charizard X and it Mega Evolves, KO it with Tectonic Rage. If Charizard does not Mega Evolve and uses Dragon Dance, use Rock Tomb until it breaks Garchomp's Substitute and then finish it off with Tectonic Rage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Powerful special attackers can help Garchomp with physically bulky Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro and Mega Gyarados. Mega Charizard Y with Flame Charge checks these Pokemon in addition to non-specially defensive Tapu Lele, Tapu Fini, and Greninja, which all threaten Garchomp. In return, Garchomp checks Meloetta, Chansey, Normalium Z Porygon-Z, offensive Tapu Lele, and Crustle. Curse Mega Aggron is a great team option for Garchomp, as it can defeat Tapu Lele, offensive Mega Metagross with Ice Punch, Mega Altaria, Greninja, Mega Lopunny, Mega Mawile, and some Sturdy Pokemon like Golem and Donphan while appreciating the positive matchup Garchomp has against bulky special attackers such as bulky Magearna and Aegislash. Sturdy Pokemon and Fairy-types also trouble Garchomp; Fairium Z Magearna defeats Sturdy Pokemon like Donphan and Golem and Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Mega Altaria, and it can also beat Mega Gyarados and Porygon-Z. At the same time, Garchomp checks Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Aegislash, Mega Venusaur, and Chansey, which can be troublesome for Magearna.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Outrage is Garchomp's most powerful STAB move, hitting Dragon-types such as offensive Mega Charizard X, Zygarde-C, and Kommo-o super effectively and dealing massive damage to Pokemon that do not resist it. It also has a minimal opportunity cost, as in most favorable matchups, Garchomp's raw power means the foe will be KOed before Garchomp gets confused. Earthquake's super effective coverage allows it to KO Pokemon like non-Ice Punch Mega Metagross, Excadrill, and non-Reversal Mega Blaziken. Poison Jab hits Fairy- and Grass-types super effectively, letting Garchomp OHKO Whimsicott, Tapu Bulu, and offensive Mega Gardevoir. Fire Fang lets it KO other Steel-types that are not hit super effectively by Earthquake such as Genesect, Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor. Alternatively, Stone Edge gives Garchomp EdgeQuake coverage, which few Pokemon resist. Stone Edge can also be used against predicted bulky Mega Charizard X that may not decide to Mega Evolve, and it also OHKOes offensive Mega Charizard X regardless if it Mega Evolves or not. Fling can be used to defeat Air Balloon Heatran and Magnezone.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature let Garchomp outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, including non-Choice Scarf base 100 Speed Pokemon and below such as Charizard, Landorus, Mega Gardevoir, and non-Choice Scarf Genesect. 252 Attack EVs with Choice Band allow Garchomp to hit as hard as possible, letting it KO Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, standard Magearna, and Aegislash. It also gives Choice Band the best possible odds against offensive Dragonite. Rough Skin is the ability of choice to hurt physical attackers that use contact moves, which makes Earthquake a guaranteed OHKO against non-Ice Punch Mega Metagross.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avoid sending it against most Sturdy Pokemon like Donphan, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Aggron, as they are able to knock Garchomp out with Counter. Physically defensive Pokemon hit neutrally by Garchomp like Mega Slowbro and Type: Null should also be avoided, who can PP stall Garchomp. Some Sturdy Pokemon can be beaten, however, most notably Electrium Z Magneton and Magnezone, as well as Crustle. Use Fire Fang over Outrage when facing Crustle, as the opponent may predict Garchomp to use Outrage and OHKO Garchomp with Counter. Fire Fang along with Rough Skin damage from Counter is a reliable 3HKO.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Powerful special wallbreakers like Normalium Z Porygon-Z and Choice Specs Greninja are great teammates for Garchomp, as they can defeat physically defensive Pokemon like Mega Slowbro and Mega Blastoise, which Garchomp struggles against. Choice Scarf Porygon-Z can also check Mega Lopunny and Jumpluff for Garchomp. Pokemon that are able to defeat the prominent Mega Gyarados such as bulky Mega Charizard Y and Mega Venusaur are necessary and pair up well with Garchomp, as Mega Gyarados is able to KO it with Outrage after boosting its Attack. Mega Gyarados itself emerges as another great teammate for Garchomp, as it is capable of defeating Sturdy Pokemon and other Pokemon that Garchomp is not able to defeat like Mega Aggron, Dragonite, and Donphan. Garchomp has great synergy with Mega Venusaur, since Mega Venusaur beats Mega Gyarados, Donphan, Magnezone, Mega Altaria, and Mega Slowbro, which defeat Garchomp, while Garchomp can check the Pokemon that defeat Mega Venusaur such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Mega Pinsir, and non-Ice Punch Mega Metagross. Aegislash and Genesect can be paired with Garchomp to scare off the abundant Fairy-types such as bulky Mega Mawile, Mega Altaria, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, which can be problematic for Garchomp. Arm Thrust Mega Heracross can defeat Mega Gyarados, Mega Slowbro, and all Sturdy Pokemon, which Garchomp appreciates.</p> "

  "Lucario": {
    "overview": "<p>With impressive offensive stats coupled with a compelling ability in Adaptability and a splendid movepool, Mega Lucario is a hard-hitter in the 1v1 metagame. Mega Lucario's high Speed lets it outspeed and KO top-tier threats like Mega Charizard Y, Mega Pinsir, Mega Gardevoir, and Heatran, while its resistance to Normal-type attacks allows it to be a great counter to Porygon Z and Meloetta. In addition to this, its Steel typing provides a immunity to poison that gives it the upper hand against Mega Venusaur. Mega Lucario also is equipped with utility moves like Magnet Rise, which lets it defeat common Ground-type Pokemon like Golem, Donphan, and non-Choice Scarf Garchomp, and its pre-Mega evolution ability Inner Focus allows it to defeat Jirachi most of the time. Sadly, its typing also makes it weak to common offensive types including Fire and Fighting, which leaves it vulnerable to Pokemon like non-Choice Band Victini, Sawk, and Mega Charizard X, as well as the unique Thousand Arrows from Zygarde, which bypasses Magnet Rise. Mega Lucario also struggles to fit everything it wants on one set, leaving it vulnerable to common threats if it does not run the correct coverage move. Moreover, its subpar bulk doesn't help in taking other powerful attacks like Hydro Cannon from Greninja and Psycho Boost from Deoxys-S. Its physical sets get completely walled by Aegislash, while bulky Pokemon such as Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Dragonite are able to take hits from it and retaliate with their moves. Due to these factors, it faces tough competition from other Fighting- or Steel-type Pokemon like Magearna, Mega Metagross, Mega Lopunny, and Kommo-o.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A special attacker set with Flash Cannon / Focus Blast / Nasty Plot / Substitute can be utilized to check counters to Mega Lucario's physical sets like Mega Mawile and Mega Scizor. However, the subpar accuracy of Focus Blast and Lucario's general lack of reliable, strong special STAB moves makes Mega Lucario struggle significantly against many Pokemon like bulky Mega Gardevoir, and so it is generally outclassed by its physical sets. Bulk Up can be used to take care of Pokemon like non-Earthquake Mega Gyarados and non-Hammer Arm Mega Metagross, but since Mega Lucario is frail, it usually needs firepower after the boost and not longevity, making this move inferior to Swords Dance. Screech can also be used as an alternative to Swords Dance for Unaware Pokemon like Quagsire and Pyukumuku, against which Swords Dance does nothing. However, its accuracy is an issue, since this can cause Mega Lucario to lose key matchups against Iron Defense users like Magearna and stall Deoxys-S, against which Swords Dance is better.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon: Defensive Pokemon like Mega Slowbro and Zygarde-C can take multiple hits from Mega Lucario with ease and either outstall it or KO it with their own moves.

At the same time, it safeguards Mega Lucario from Counter, Metal Burst, and status moves like Pain Split from Magearna and Leech Seed from stall Celesteela. Reversal is its main damaging move, reaching 200 Base Power on low health and, with the Adaptability boost, allowing it to KO the likes of Garchomp, Mega Aggron, and Celesteela. Meteor Mash is used to KO Fairy-type Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Mega Gardevoir, Tapu Bulu, non-Choice Scarf Togekiss, and Clefable. Swords Dance is a useful setup move that allows Mega Lucario to beat Magearna in conjunction with Substitute and even break through walls that resist Reversal, as well as take out bulky setup Pokemon like Curse Mega Aggron. Magnet Rise is used to allow Mega Lucario to defeat Pokemon that carry super effective Ground-type moves such as non-Choice Scarf Garchomp, Donphan, and Golem. Rock Tomb lets Mega Lucario outspeed Pokemon with Speed-boosting setup moves like Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X and Shell Smash + Earthquake Crustle, but it means it loses out against Blacephalon and bulkier variants of Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>240 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature let Mega Lucario outspeed base 110s such as Archeops, as well as Mega Charizard X and Y, non-Choice Scarf Garchomp, Mega Pinsir, non-Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Durant. 28 Special Defense EVs ensure that Mega Lucario survives a Hyper Beam from Modest maximum Special Attack Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. The remaining 240 EVs are invested in Attack to enhance Mega Lucario's offensive capability by letting it hit as hard as possible. Inner Focus as the pre-Mega ability prevents Lucario from flinching, which lets it defeat Jirachi most of the time. Adaptability boosts Reversal's power after factoring in the STAB boost, making it a 400-Base Power move after four uses of Substitute.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against Tapunium Z Tapu Fini, use Meteor Mash first. If they use Guardian of Alola, use Substitute before unleashing a devastating 200-BP Reversal. Against Ground-type Pokemon like Donphan and Golem, use Counter after Magnet Rise to avoid a potential Counter. Use Rock Tomb as the first move against potential Choice Scarf users such as Porygon-Z to outspeed them on subsequent turns. When matched up against Jirachi, the best play is to start with Rock Tomb without Mega Evolving in order to outpace it. Mega Evolve on the next turn, and use Substitute to get Mega Lucario within range of high Base Power Reversal, which will let you win most of the time. Against stall Pokemon, use Swords Dance if Mega Lucario is faster; else, use Rock Tomb in order to avoid being Taunted by Pokemon such as Deoxys-S before boosting Mega Lucario's Attack.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Porygon-Z can be paired with Mega Lucario to defeat most of the Pokemon that outspeed it such as Greninja, Mega Lopunny, and Naganadel, and as well as physically bulky Pokemon including Zygarde-C and non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Concurrently, Mega Lucario checks Mega Aggron for Porygon-Z, as well as Magearna if running Swords Dance and Donphan and Golem if carrying Magnet Rise. Bulky Mega Charizard Y appreciates Mega Lucario's ability to take on non-Taunt Heatran, Donphan, and Golem. Mega Charizard Y can help it by checking non Choice-Scarf Landorus-T, Calm Mind Mega Slowbro, Greninja, Tapu Fini, and Mega Mawile, which usually defeat Mega Lucario. This Mega Lucario set doesn't have any powerful move to hit Ghost-type Pokemon, so it requires teammates that can deal with them.

In addition, it also defeats Dragonite, Choice Scarf Garchomp, and Choice Scarf Victini, which defeat Mega Lucario.

Togekiss is able to survive many attacks from powerful Pokemon with good investment, such as Choice Specs Greninja's Ice Beam, uninvested +2 Mega Gardevoir's Hyper Beam after Z-Thunder Wave, Jolly Choice Scarf Kartana's Smart Strike, Mega Charizard X's Flare Blitz, Genesect's Flash Cannon, and uninvested Tapu Lele's Shattered Psyche. Surviving these hits is important for Togekiss, as it allows it to bully them with Thunder Wave, Air Slash, Roost, Charm, or Substitute. However, its weakness to common Steel-, Rock-, and Electric-types such as Magnezone, Magearna, Terrakion, and Zeraora can hold it back significantly, as these are common picks against teams that use Togekiss, making it sometimes hard to send out.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Togekiss can use Firium Z to beat Aegislash and Magearna, but it loses out on the ability to use Z-Thunder Wave or Z-Charm, which relegates it to a lure. Grassium Z allows Togekiss to lure Ground-types such as Golem and Mega Swampert, and in addition still beat Mega Gyarados; however, this gives up the ability to use Z-Thunder Wave, which causes it to lose out on numerous matchups.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-types: Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-type Pokemon, such as Zeraora, Magnezone, Gigalith, and Aegislash  resist Air Slash, which can allow them to survive a large number of them and potentially OHKO Togekiss with powerful Z-Moves.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Nukes: Strong super effective attackers such as Choice Specs or Poisonium Z Naganadel and Icium Z Weavile can OHKO Togekiss.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Air Slash is the most obvious choice of move for Togekiss, as it's a decently strong STAB move that, with Serene Grace, has a 60% flinch chance. This allows it to hit the majority of the metagame for decent damage, notably, Mega Gyarados. Thunder Wave allows Togekiss to essentially double its Speed, outrunning fully invested Deoxys-S, while adding the chance for full paralysis on top of the flinch chance from Air Slash. Z-Thunder Wave raises Togekiss's Special Defense by one stage, allowing it to survive hits from Pokemon such as Choice Specs Greninja, Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, and uninvested Mega Gardevoir. Roost allows Togekiss to create an HP buffer that allows it to survive attacks if the opponent is able to move, allowing the user to mitigate risk by a significant amount in many matchups, such as against uninvested Mega Gardevoir and uninvested Tapu Lele, and the removal of its Flying typing allows Togekiss to take neutral damage from attacks like Stone Edge from Golem, Bolt Strike from Victini, and Ice Beam from Choice Specs Greninja. Nasty Plot allows Togekiss to break through walls such as Mega Slowbro, Umbreon, Kyurem, and Deoxys-S. Alternatively, Charm lets it beat Groundium Z Golem, Donphan, physical Dragonite, and Mega Gyarados more reliably. Encore can force opposing Pokemon to continue using setup moves, allowing Togekiss to slowly chip away at their HP with safety. This lets it lock Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir, Mega Charizard X, and Zygarde into moves such as Calm Mind, Dragon Dance, and Substitute, respectively, as well as beating stall Pokemon like Mega Slowbro and Stored Power Necrozma. Substitute can be combined with Air Slash and Thunder Wave to further protect Togekiss from being attacked. This can help against uninvested Tapu Lele and Mega Gardevoir.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>208 HP EVs and 72 Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature allow Togekiss to survive many strong hits from uninvested Tapu Lele, uninvested Mega Gardevoir, and Choice Specs Greninja, giving it the opportunity to use Z-Thunder Wave. The HP EVs also allow Togekiss to deal with physical attackers like Mega Gyarados with ease. Landing Air Slash on a paralyzed Pokemon gives the foe a 30% chance to move each turn. This allows Togekiss to take many opponents entirely through flinches without needing Roost or Nasty Plot. Electrium Z allows Togekiss to use Z-Thunder Wave to boost its Special Defense by one stage. This helps against Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Choice Specs Greninja, uninvested Tapu Lele, and uninvested Mega Gardevoir. 228 Speed EVs allow Togekiss to outspeed maximum Speed Deoxys-S after Thunder Wave. Serene Grace boosts the chance of Air Slash flinching to 60%, which helps against Tapu Lele, Mega Gardevoir, Tapu Fini, and Primarina.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Keep in mind that the foe has a 70% chance to not attack each turn if Air Slash lands. Substitute can be used against Pokemon that tend to use moves like Calm Mind, such as Magearna, Tapu Lele, and Mega Gardevoir, as it can create a barrier that allows Togekiss to survive a powerful attack in case it doesn't land a flinch. Against Magearna specifically, use Z-Thunder Wave turn 1, then use Substitute, then spam Air Slash. Use Substitute again when it breaks Togekiss's Substitute, as Togekiss can survive a +2 Fleur Cannon after a Roost at +1 Special Defense, then use Substitute again. Make sure you have a Substitute up at almost all times, to prevent the opposing Magearna from using Pain Split. Use Togekiss if your opponent doesn't have any Pokemon that win via being faster like Smeargle, Vivillon, or Jumpluff.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can efficiently dispatch Steel-, Electric-, and Rock-types like Rockium Z Golem, Zeraora, and Magnezone are helpful as teammates for Togekiss, such as Golem, Donphan, and Garchomp. In return, Togekiss can beat Water- and Grass-types like Primarina and Mega Venusaur for them. Pokemon such as Kyurem and Dragonite that benefit from Togekiss dispatching uninvested Mega Gardevoir, Mega Gyarados, and Greninja are good teammates, especially if they match up well versus the Steel-, Electric-, and Rock-types that hold Togekiss back such as Golem, Zeraora, and Celesteela. Pokemon that can deal with Toxic stallers like Blissey and Chansey, such as Ferrothorn, are good teammates for Togekiss, as are teammates that can deal with fast Poison-types like Naganadel and Substitute Mega Gengar, such as specially defensive Flame Charge Mega Charizard X.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Air Slash is the primary move that Choice Scarf Togekiss uses, so much so that the other moves are filler, with the exception of Fire Blast. It hits Naganadel, Tapu Lele, Mega Charizard X and Y, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Gyarados, and most of the metagame for at least decent damage, allowing it to potentially win a poor matchup with a string of flinches. Fire Blast allows Togekiss to beat some Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Dazzling Gleam is a secondary STAB move that can hit Dragon- and Dark-type Pokemon for super effective damage, such as Greninja, Garchomp, Haxorus, non-Metal Burst Mega Sableye, and Mega Altaria. Trick can mess with Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Type: Null by forcing them to lose their Eviolite  and locking them into the first move they used.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Serene Grace gives Air Slash a 60% chance to land a flinch, allowing it to drastically increase its chance of winning through a chain of flinches. 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature give Togekiss the maximum Speed possible, while 252 Special Attack EVs let it do as much damage as possible. A Choice Scarf boosts Togekiss's speed so that it can outspeed everything up to maximum Speed Zeraora.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In particular, use Air Slash against Pokemon that you cannot OHKO with a coverage move and will lose against barring flinches, such as Mega Tyranitar, Golem, and Magnezone, as a small chance of winning is better than no chance of winning. It's a good idea to use Togekiss when your opponent has a way to beat both other Pokemon on your team or if they use a lot of Pokemon that do not resist Air Slash.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can beat Rock-, Steel-, Poison-, and Electric-types such as Magnezone, Naganadel, Mega Gengar, and Golem are good teammates for Togekiss. Ground-types cover all of these tremendously, so teammates like Zygarde-C, Donphan, and Golem are great. In return, Togekiss can beat most Water- and Grass-types like Mega Venusaur, Primarina, and Ferrothorn for these Ground-type teammates. Strong wallbreaking Pokemon such as Incineroar, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Charizard X and Y can beat beefy Pokemon that take too many turns for Togekiss to KO such as Celesteela and PP stall Deoxys-S. Choice Scarf Togekiss acts as a good panic button, as it can beat threats to the main core of the team through luck, which can allow it to support generally strong cores such as Mega Gardevoir + Heatran and Mega Altaria + Heatran.</p> "

        "name": "Fairium Z",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Air Slash is this set's go-to move, as it is a relatively strong STAB move that can make slower targets such as Golem, Donphan, and Primarina flinch. Charm is used to reduce the opposing Pokemon's Attack by two stages, and when powered up by Fairium Z, it also raises Togekiss' Defense by one stage. This can help it beat Golem, Donphan, Mega Gyarados, Mega Charizard X, and other physical attackers such as physically attacking Dragonite and Mega Aggron more reliably. Roost is used to heal Togekiss, which in conjunction with Charm drastically increases Togekiss's longevity. This is useful against Pokemon that can survive many Air Slashes such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Gyarados. Nasty Plot can help against defensive Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro, Mega Sableye, and Necrozma. Thunder Wave can be used to increase the chance of the foe losing a turn and also allows Togekiss to beat Mega Charizard Y much more easily by negating the chance of an opposing Air Slash flinch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given HP and Defense EVs allow Togekiss to take a full-power Flare Blitz from Mega Charizard X and another one after a Z-Charm. The Special Defense investment allows Togekiss to survive Timid Porygon-Z's Normalium Z-boosted Hyper Beam most of the time and moves like Mega Charizard Y's Blast Burn all of the time. Fairium Z is used so that Togekiss can use Z-Charm. Serene Grace doubles the chance of Air Slash to land a flinch.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Air Slash, Thunder Wave, or Nasty Plot in between Charms and Roost against most physical foes, as doing more damage allows Togekiss to avoid potentially being struck by a critical hit. Send Togekiss in against physical attackers such as Golem, Donphan, Mega Gyarados, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Charizard X. Avoid using Togekiss against teams that utilize a lot of special attackers or Electric-types such as Magearna, Tapu Lele, and Zeraora, as it tends to lose against these Pokemon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fairium Z Togekiss pairs well with Bug- and Grass-types, such as Scizor, Volcarona, and Mega Venusaur, as it can dispatch the majority of Rock- and Fire-types for them. These Bug- and Grass-types in return can beat Electric- and Ice-types such as Zeraora and Kyurem, both of which can easily OHKO Togekiss. Togekiss benefits from teammates that can deal with special attackers like Mega Gardevoir, Tapu Lele, and Magnezone, such as your own Magnezone, Chansey, and Magearna, as it takes care of primarily physical attackers such as Golem, Mega Charizard X, and physically attacking Dragonite for them. Magearna is an especially notable partner, as it loves Togekiss's ability to deal with Mega Charizard X and Y. In return, Magearna can beat Tapu Lele and Mega Gardevoir for Togekiss.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Porygon-Z is an extremely strong special attacker due to its high Special Attack and Adaptability, capable of OHKOing many key threats in 1v1 such as Zygarde, Landorus-T, and Mega Charizard X. This is also aided by its access to an extremely powerful Hyper Beam; its ability to OHKO most Pokemon eliminates the main drawback of a recharge turn. A mono-Normal typing means that Porygon-Z only has one weakness, but Fighting-types such as Mega Lopunny, Sawk, and Mega Blaziken are dominant forces in the 1v1 metagame, and it also has no resistances and only one immunity, resulting in it having a lack of defensive value. Lastly, because Porygon-Z primarily relies on its Normal-type STAB moves, it is often walled by Normal-resistant and -immune Pokemon such as Magearna and Mega Tyranitar.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Specs can be used instead of Choice Scarf to increase Porygon-Z's damage output and allow it to OHKO Dragonite with Blizzard, but Z-Conversion secures the same +1 boost without locking Porygon-Z into a move. Z-Conversion Porygon-Z can run both Nasty Plot and Recover, forgoing Shadow Ball or Hyper Beam, but this set is walled by Steel-, Rock-, and Ghost-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types resist Hyper Beam and Ice Beam and can often tank Hidden Power Fire due to their bulk. Mega Aggron, Magearna, and Celesteela are big threats to Porygon-Z because they can often check or even wall it depending on its set.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Rock-types such as Nihilego and Mega Tyranitar resist Hyper Beam and Breakneck Blitz and can often OHKO Porygon-Z back with their STAB moves. Mega Tyranitar also resists Shadow Ball, meaning Z-Conversion sets cannot break past it.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Due to their immunity to Normal, Aegislash and Mega Gengar are only damaged by Shadow Ball, which requires a turn of setup for it to become a STAB option. This means that they can easily wall and shut down Porygon-Z.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Chansey and Mega Venusaur can all take one of Porygon-Z's attacks and either recover HP or inflict it with status. It cannot effectively break them due to Hyper Beam's recharge turn. However, they can all be overwhelmed by Nasty Plot sets.</p> ",

        "name": "Z-Conversion",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball hits most Pokemon neutrally and heavily damages Ghost- and Psychic-types; after a Conversion boost and Adaptability, it can OHKO a majority of the metagame such as Aegislash and Mega Slowbro. Recover enables Porygon-Z to remain healthy throughout a match so it can break bulkier foes and Sturdy users like Donphan and Golem more easily. Nasty Plot is an alternative that boosts Porygon-Z's Special Attack further so it can beat specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey and Mega Venusaur. This can also be run instead of Hyper Beam, but Porygon-Z loses out on the raw power that it offers. Hyper Beam is Porygon-Z's strongest STAB move, capable of OHKOing a majority of the metagame due to its high Base Power when boosted by Adaptability. It can also be turned into a 200-Base Power Breakneck Blitz if the boosts from Z-Conversion aren't required. Conversion changes Porygon-Z's typing to that of its first move in Shadow Ball, providing it with resistances to Bug and Poison and two useful immunities in Normal and Fighting as well as a strong STAB move. When powered up with Normalium Z, it grants Porygon-Z a +1 boost to all its stats. Uproar can be run as an alternative to Recover in order to beat Substitute users such as Jumpluff more reliably, but losing out on the longevity of Recover makes beating bulkier Pokemon harder.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>216 Speed EVs combined with a Timid nature allow Porygon-Z to outspeed Sawk and Mega Metagross as well as slower variants of Mega Charizard X. 212 Defense EVs enable Porygon-Z to survive Mega Charizard X's Flare Blitz or Outrage as well as Mega Gyarados's Waterfall. Adaptability boosts Porygon-Z's Normal-type STAB moves and Ghost-type moves after it has used Z-Conversion, making Hyper Beam even harder to combat and Shadow Ball difficult for neutral targets to take. Normalium Z can be used for a strong Normal-type attack or to grant Porygon-Z a +1 boost to all its stats with Z-Conversion.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Breakneck Blitz is notable in the absurd amounts of power it offers, alongside a follow up Hyper Beam; Porygon-Z can be sent out against bulkier Pokemon like Mega Slowbro and Primarina and proceed to OHKO or heavily damage with Breakneck Blitz. You should avoid bringing it in against a Sturdy user if it isn't running Recover, as Porygon-Z cannot break Sturdy without taking a hit, and its frailty makes this difficult. Setting up with Z-Conversion is optimal against bulkier Pokemon that Porygon-Z cannot OHKO so it can utilize its boosted Special Attack to net a KO as well as its increased defenses to take hits from them more easily. It can also stall them out with Recover. Be wary of Z-Conversion; while Porygon-Z's new Ghost typing offers resistances, it also offers a weakness to Ghost- and Dark-type moves from Pokemon such as Mega Gengar and Mega Gyarados, which a Normal-typed Porygon-Z can take more easily.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Porygon-Z cannot adequately damage Steel-types if it's unable to set up Z-Conversion due to their resistance to Breakneck Blitz, so Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Zygarde-C and Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y make good partners due to their ability to reliably win these matchups. Answers to special walls are appreciated, as Porygon-Z cannot beat Chansey. As such, physical wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Metagross make good partners. Before a Speed boost and without a Choice Scarf, Porygon-Z has an average Speed tier, which faster threats such as Mega Charizard Y can take advantage of to OHKO it before it can attack; pairing it with faster teammates such as Mega Metagross and Mega Lopunny or bulkier Pokemon that can take a hit help deal with this. Porygon-Z is a relatively frail Pokemon and cannot take many hits; thus, bulkier partners such as Magearna and Mega Venusaur are appreciated.</p> "

Ice Beam enables Porygon-Z to hit Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Zygarde-C for the most damage, preventing them from setting up on a free turn granted by recharge, and Trick shuts down defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Mew by locking them into one move and removing their defensive items.

In addition to this, Rotom-H's STAB Fire- and Electric-type coverage separates it from other common Fire-types, as this allows it to beat many common bulky Water-types such as Mega Slowbro, Primarina, and Tapu Fini. Rotom-H's access to Will-O-Wisp and Charge gives it ways of dealing with both physical and special attackers, such as Zeraora and Mewnium Z Mew. However, Rotom-H is held back mainly by its poor Speed tier in conjunction with its subpar HP stat, which allows Pokemon past the base 86 Speed benchmark to outspeed it, including most of the more prominent threats in the metagame like Greninja, Garchomp, Z-Celebrate Meloetta, Porygon-Z, and Mega Lopunny. Additionally, while Rotom-H's typing is good, it can be a liability in a metagame full of common Dragon- and Ground-types with Rock-type coverage or Thousand Arrows, such as Mega Charizard X, Landorus-T, and Zygarde-C.</p> ",

Overheat is a staple move on any Rotom-H set, nailing many prominent Grass- and Steel-types such as Mega Mawile and Ferrothorn. Will-O-Wisp allows Rotom-H to deal with some physical attackers such as Zeraora as well as breaking Sturdy on Pokemon like Magnezone and Choice Band Avalugg. Charge is used in combination with Thunder to boost Gigavolt Havoc's firepower further and to give Rotom-H a +1 in its Special Defense boost, notably allowing it to beat one of the best Pokemon in the metagame in Magearna.

You can also opt to run an EV spread of 160 HP / 128 SpA / 220 Spe to defeat Choice Band Donphan more reliably while retaining the ability to OHKO Mega Gyarados, at the cost of losing some reliability against Groundium Z Donphan.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In Magearna's case, Rotom-H should use Charge to boost Gigavolt Havoc's firepower and cancel out the effect of Magearna using Calm Mind.

Other than Magearna, there are still other Pokemon that Charge is useful against, such as Dragon Dance Mega Altaria, Mewnium Z Mew, and Heatran. The Special Defense boost can prove crucial against special attackers like Mew, and the power boost can help Rotom-H KO them once they've gotten chipped down with the preferred move. When facing Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Sawk and Choice Scarf Victini, Electroweb, if chosen, should be used in conjunction with Gigavolt Havoc to slow them down and KO them after.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>A Fire / Water / Grass core team can be utilized, as such a core has excellent type synergy. Water-types such as Mega Gyarados, Greninja, and Mega Slowbro help deal with many of the prominent bulky Fire-types like Mega Charizard X, Victini, and Incineroar, as Rotom-H has no tools at its disposal capable of defeating them. Water-types also benefit from Rotom-H defeating many bulky Water-types such as Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Mega Blastoise. Greninja gets a special mention, as it deals with some of the faster Pokemon in the tier such as Z-Conversion Porygon-Z, Garchomp, and Choice Band Durant. Grass-types like Mega Venusaur, Serperior, and Tapu Bulu are necessary for Rotom-H, as they can safely deal with many of the fast Water-types within the tier, such as Greninja, Manaphy, and Keldeo. Rotom-H, in return, can defeat the myriad of Flying- and Steel-types in the tier such as Mega Charizard Y, Togekiss, Heatran, Celesteela, and Mega Pinsir. Speedy Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Pheromosa, and Naganadel are very helpful for taking on Serperior, which Rotom-H cannot defeat one-on-one, as well as many other Pokemon like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Tapu Lele that all threaten Rotom-H; in return, Rotom-H can deal with some of the bulkier physical Pokemon in the tier such as Mega Metagross, Donphan, and Mega Aggron. Finally, wallbreakers like Hoopa-U, Kartana, and Garchomp are a must, as they are able to deal with PP stalling Pokemon and special walls such as Clefable, Mega Venusaur, and Blissey while Rotom-H can deal with some bulkier foes that they cannot beat such as Flyinium Z Dragonite, Celesteela, and Genesect.</p> "

  "Manaphy": {
    "overview": "<p>Manaphy's niche in 1v1 comes from its wide variety of utility options and EV spreads that make it a very flexible partner. As a Water-type Pokemon, Manaphy finds itself in an advantageous position against many of the common Fire-, Steel-, and Ground-types that occupy 1v1 such as Mega Charizard X, Heatran, Magearna, Zygarde-C, Landorus-T, and Donphan. Additionally, Manaphy's access to Grass-type coverage gives it good matchups against many of the top-tier Water-types in 1v1 between Mega Gyarados, Primarina, and Tapu Fini. Even with mimimal investment, Manaphy still has above average bulk, being capable of withstanding powerful attacks like Magearna's Twinkle Tackle, Garchomp's Tectonic Rage, and Choice Specs Naganadel's Draco Meteor. Unfortunately, Manaphy's strongest Water-type move is Surf, which means it often misses out on getting KOs, namely on non-Flame Charge Mega Charizard Y and Choice Scarf Genesect, that it would've gotten if it had a move with higher Base Power like Hydro Pump. Additionally, Manaphy's excessively balanced stats lead to it being required to sacrifice reliability against Pokemon it previously could knock out, withstand attacks from, or outspeed in the interest of gaining matchups against others. This is especially evident in the fringe scenarios of trying to make Manaphy reliably withstand attacks from Landorus-T and Naganadel while still maintaining the power and speed to deal with Mega Charizard X and Smeargle.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Acid Armor and Charm help with Manaphy's physical bulk, boosting its Defense by two stages and lowering the foe's Attack by two stages. These moves help Manaphy buy time to set up against Pokemon like Dragonite and Mega Mawile while also enabling it to stall when used with more defensively oriented sets. Calm Mind is an option that is ideally used on faster builds in order to withstand attacks from the likes of Tapu Lele and Genesect, but this leaves Manaphy missing one of its core moves. Rest can be used in conjunction with the prior defensive setup moves in the interest of stalling foes like Mega Slowbro, Clefable, Jumpluff, and Mega Venusaur rather than going for a quick knockout. Rain Dance can be used alongside Rest and Hydration on more stall-oriented sets in order to get free heals in the duration of the weather. It is mainly useful for canceling out Mega Charizard Y's Drought. Scald can be used in place of Surf on more stall-oriented sets in the interest of fishing for a burn in order to further aid against physical threats like Dragonite and Mega Mawile while also getting continual chip damage against the likes of Mega Scizor, Kyurem, Chansey, and Umbreon; moreover, Chesto Berry and Iapapa Berry can be used in place of Waterium Z so that Manaphy can get immediate recovery that doesn't disrupt its defensive setup. Icium Z can be used over Waterium Z with the base move Blizzard in place of Surf in order for Manaphy to get KOs versus Dragonite, Serperior, and Garchomp, as well as Kommo-o, when used in conjunction with Calm Mind and Icy Wind.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks: As a Water-type, Manaphy suffers from a severe weakness to the Electric- and Grass-types in 1v1 that threaten to KO it before it gets a chance to KO them, namely Zeraora, Magnezone, Serperior, Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Kartana.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Though Manaphy is respectably bulky, there are still many Pokemon that simply have the raw power or setup to dispose of Manaphy without needing to hit super effectively, such as Dragonite, Porygon-Z, Tapu Lele, Mega Gardevoir, Pheromosa, and Substitute Volcarona.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon: There are multiple Pokemon that have the raw bulk, type resistance, and setup to withstand attacks, fire back with their own powerful attacks, and exhaust Manaphy, such as Meloetta, Mega Slowbro, Aegislash, Kommo-o, Clefable, Mega Venusaur, Choice Specs Necrozma, and Whimsicott.</p> ",

        "name": "Tail Glow + 3 Attacks",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Tail Glow is Manaphy's setup move, increasing its Special Attack by three stages so that it can knock out foes like Mega Gyarados, Magearna, Tapu Fini, and Mega Altaria. Surf becomes a powerful STAB Hydro Vortex when used with Waterium Z, giving Manaphy the potential to clear out the common Fire- and Ground-types that occupy the 1v1 metagame such as Heatran, Donphan, and common variants of Landorus-T and Victini. Icy Wind deals important chip damage while also lowering the foe's Speed by one stage, which is essential for taking on Mega Gyarados, Garchomp, Naganadel, and stall Deoxys-S. Energy Ball is a coverage move for dealing with the Water-types that resist Surf and Icy Wind such as Mega Gyarados, Primarina, and Tapu Fini.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>244 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature ensure that Manaphy knocks out offensive Mega Charizard X in one hit with Hydro Vortex, as well as +1 Magearna after using Tail Glow. 152 Speed EVs guarantee that Manaphy outspeeds Smeargle, Adamant Mega Gyarados, and specially defensive Mega Charizard X. 84 HP EVs and 28 Defense EVs allow Manaphy to withstand a Solar Beam from Mega Charizard Y, as well as giving it the best odds of surviving a Tectonic Rage from Jolly Landorus-T and a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor from Timid Naganadel.</p> <p>Manaphy can afford to be extremely customisable, thanks to its typing, bulk, and Tail Glow. Manaphy can run a spread of 168 HP / 172 SpA / 96 SpD / 72 Spe with a Calm Nature in order to beat Aegislash, surviving a Never-Ending Nightmare into a Shadow Sneak, while also outspeeding Modest Heatran, in order to beat Grassium Z Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>There are a handful of matchups where it's ideal for Manaphy to go for the attack right away instead of setting up, namely using Hydro Vortex versus offensive Mega Charizard X, Greninja, Landorus-T, and Victini or a combination of Icy Wind followed by another attack for Garchomp and Naganadel. Against Mega Charizard X, it is ideal for Manaphy to use Hydro Vortex right away, as it will immediately KO offensive sets. If Mega Charizard X is slower than Manaphy and survives Hydro Vortex, it means they are running a specially defensive set and will lack the ability to reliably KO Manaphy, even after a Dragon Dance, while Manaphy picks up the 2HKO with Surf. The matchup versus Mega Gyarados is won by using Tail Glow immediately and then following up with Icy Wind to make sure that Mega Gyarados doesn't 2HKO Manaphy after a Dragon Dance as well as deal crucial chip damage. On the third turn, Manaphy picks up the 2HKO with either Hydro Vortex if Gyarados didn't Mega Evolve or Energy Ball if it did. Mega Slowbro is a questionable matchup for Manaphy, as it is very reliant on rolls and careful plays due to Mega Slowbro's ability to boost its Special Defense considerably with Amnesia. The ideal play is to use Energy Ball after the first Tail Glow so that Mega Slowbro gets a possible Special Defense drop and some chip damage, then follow up with another Tail Glow, and repeatedly use Energy Ball, hoping for sufficient rolls to drop Special Defense and KO it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Manaphy can find a place in the common Fire / Water / Grass core with Fire-types like Mega Charizard, Heatran, and Victini covering its weakness to Grass-types like Serperior, Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Kartana, while Manaphy returns the favor by handling the Rock-, Ground-, and Water-types like Mega Tyranitar, Landorus-T, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Swampert that threaten them. Meanwhile, the aforementioned Grass-types cover Manaphy's weakness to Electric-type attacks from Pokemon like Zeraora, Magnezone, and Thunder Punch Mega Metagross, while Manaphy covers their weakness to the aforementioned Fire-types as well as Steel-types like Magearna, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor, which resist their attacks. Bulky Steel-types like Mega Metagross, Celesteela, Heatran, specially defensive Mega Mawile, and Ferrothorn serve as good partners for Manaphy, as they can deal with the powerful special attackers that threaten it between Porygon-Z, Tapu Lele, Mega Gardevoir, Meloetta, and Magnezone, while Manaphy covers Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Zygarde-C, Mega Sableye, and Victini that would otherwise beat them. It also appreciates assistance from Fairy-types like Magearna, Tapu Lele, Mega Gardevoir, Tapu Fini, and Mega Altaria, as they deal with the Dragon- and Fighting-types like Dragonite, Kommo-o, Haxorus, Pheromosa, and Sawk that either overpower Manaphy or withstand its attacks. Manaphy, in turn, handles the opposing Steel- and Fire-types like Magearna, Celesteela, Heatran, and Victini that the Fairy-types struggle with. Sturdy Pokemon like Magnezone, Donphan, Crustle, and Sawk excel at handling some of the more offensive threats that often KO Manaphy between Mega Charizard Y, Porygon-Z, Meloetta, Genesect, and Kartana, while Manaphy handles Pokemon like Zygarde-C, Landorus-T, Mega Altaria, Mega Sableye, and Mega Swampert that can all withstand attacks from the Sturdy Pokemon and knock them out over a long, drawn-out battle.</p> "

  "Victini": {
    "overview": "<p>Victini is a good Pokemon in 1v1 because of its Fire typing and its access to V-create, allowing it to beat common threats such as Magearna, Mega Charizard Y, and Genesect. Fire is generally a good offensive type and V-create is a supremely powerful STAB move, allowing Victini to beat many of the omnipresent bulky Steel-types, like Celesteela and Mega Mawile. Defensively, Victini's resistance to Fairy-type STAB attacks from popular Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Gardevoir allows it to beat them when it's running a physical set. It can also be quite versatile with its base 100 stats across the board and nice movepool that includes moves such as Blue Flare, Celebrate, Magic Coat, Will-O-Wisp, and Glaciate, allowing it to run a variety of viable sets to beat diverse threats. A Z-Celebrate set can also be used to beat threats to the Choice Band set like Mega Charizard X and Kommo-o. By running a mixed attacker set, Victini is able to beat Zeraora reliably. It is also able to viably run Taunt for some stall Pokemon like Type: Null and Mega Altaria. However, Victini lacks decent spammable boosting moves, only having Z-Celebrate, Power-Up Punch, and Work Up, and, as a result, competes with other Fire-types like Mega Charizard X, Heatran, and Incineroar due to their ability to raise their damage output by using moves like Dragon Dance, Metal Sound, and Bulk Up. Furthermore, Victini's rather lacking offensive stats leave its coverage moves without much force behind them, meaning it loses to Pokemon that can withstand V-create and are too bulky for its coverage moves, like Mega Gyarados, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Tyranitar.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A physical Psychium Z set with V-create / Bolt Strike / Zen Headbutt / Light Screen or Magic Coat can be run. Physical sets retain the ability to beat Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Mega Gardevoir, and Kommo-o. Magic Coat or Light Screen can also beat either variant of Tapu Fini, given that you predict Tapu Fini's set correctly, by using Z-Magic Coat or Light Screen against Waterium Z variants and directly using Bolt Strike against Tapunium Z variants. This Victini set can also beat Choice Specs Greninja with Z-Magic Coat followed by Bolt Strike or V-create depending on Greninja's move. Z-Light Screen can allow Victini to beat Heatran and Primarina most of the time. Both Z-Magic Coat and Z-Light Screen sets can also force Volcarona into mind games. An Icium Z set with Will-O-Wisp / Blue Flare / Taunt / Glaciate can be run to beat Pokemon that are weak to Ice like Dragonite, Zygarde, Landorus-T, and Donphan. However, because this set will make Victini's STAB moves especially lackluster, it should only be used to lure in and beat Dragonite. Firium Z can be run to beat Aegislash without Victini having to run Substitute. It can also somewhat consistently beat Donphan with Z-Will-O-Wisp. A faster Choice Band set can be used to retain the offensive power of Choice Band while outspeeding Pokemon like Normalium Z Porygon-Z.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock- and Ground-types: Pokemon such as Zygarde, Landorus-T, Mega Tyranitar, and Garchomp can all survive Victini's attacks and KO it with super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Offense: Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, Incineroar, and Choice Scarf Dragonite resist V-create, are too bulky for Victini's much weaker coverage moves, and can defeat Victini with powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Stall Mega Evolutions and Z-Move Users: Mega Slowbro, Kyurem, and Psychium Z Deoxys-S can set up using boosting moves, then stall Victini out while whittling it down because of its lack of good boosting moves and their immunity to Trick.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash: King's Shield blocks V-create and prevents Victini from OHKOing Aegislash, which OHKOes Victini in return with Never-Ending Nightmare.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>V-create is Victini's strongest move by far, and it is used to burst Steel-types like Magearna, Mega Mawile, and Celesteela. It can also be used to beat Pokemon that are unable to effectively hit Victini such as Mega Gardevoir, Tapu Lele, and Mew. Bolt Strike is used against Tapunium Z Tapu Fini and Heatran. It also is a powerful weapon against opposing Victini and can sometimes land an OHKO against Primarina. Flame Charge is used against Pokemon that will avoid fainting to V-create such as Magnezone, Flail Mega Pinsir, and Flail Mega Lopunny. It can also be used to outspeed SubSeed users like Jumpluff and Serperior. Zen Headbutt is used against Poison-types like Mega Venusaur and Naganadel. Trick can shut down stall Pokemon that do not use Z-Crystals or Mega Stones like Type: Null and Pyukumuku, as well as give Victini a chance against Porygon2, albeit an unreliable one. It can also be used to force Deoxys-S into guessing games between using Taunt against Trick or Iron Defense against V-create.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>240 HP and 4 Special Defense EVs are used to increase Victini's bulk, particularly for Modest Magnezone's Gigavolt Havoc, forcing it to try to paralyze Victini with regular Zap Cannon. Additionally, the 4 Special Defense EVs prevent a Special Attack Download boost for Pokemon like Genesect and Porygon2. The HP investment helps Victini survive physical attacks like Mega Lopunny's Fake Out followed by Giga Impact. 20 Speed EVs are used to outspeed base 60 Speed Pokemon, particularly Timid Magnezone. 244 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature alongside Choice Band are used to deal as much damage as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Flame Charge if the Speed boost will let Victini outspeed and KO the foe on the next turn, like against Substitute users such as Mega Pinsir, Serperior, and Mega Lopunny. The matchup against Substitute + Earthquake Mega Metagross is a coinflip, requiring Victini to use Flame Charge if Mega Metagross chooses to use Substitute and V-create if it does not use Substitute.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fast Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon like Electrium Z Zeraora and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu can beat Water-types like Mega Gyarados, Greninja, and Mega Slowbro.

        "name": "Z-Celebrate",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Celebrate is required for this set to function, allowing Victini to boost up all of its stats with Z-Celebrate as well as raise Stored Power's Base Power to 120. Stored Power allows Victini to hit foes like Mega Charizard X, Kommo-o, and boosted Bulk Up Zeraora. V-create is also a must-have, sporting a huge 180 Base Power on top of STAB and an Attack boost from Z-Celebrate to beat threats that resist Stored Power like Gardevoir and Magearna, as well as Zeraora that has used Charge. Taunt allows Victini to shut down stall Pokemon and Substitute users that would otherwise wall it, such as Mega Altaria and Mega Audino. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ground can be run to beat Heatran as well as ease the Substitute + Earthquake Mega Metagross matchup.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>212 Special Attack EVs along with a Rash nature allow Victini to OHKO offensive Mega Charizard X after a Z-Celebrate boost, while 232 Speed EVs allow Victini to outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Haxorus after a boost. 16 Attack and 48 HP EVs give Victini the best chances of simultaneously OHKOing a bulky Charge-boosted Zeraora with V-create, tanking two Outrages from specially defensive Mega Charizard X, and tanking specially defensive Kommo-o's Clangorous Soulblaze followed by Clanging Scales.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Unfortunately, because of this set's lack of bulk investment, hard-hitting hyper offensive Pokemon, even if they're weak to Psychic or Fire, can threaten Victini and should be avoided. Victini is OHKOed by Naganadel, relies on damage rolls for taking out foes like Mega Lopunny, and gives a Special Attack Download boost to Genesect, causing offensive Choice Specs sets to have a favorable damage roll against Victini. The only times where Victini may not want to use Z-Celebrate immediately are during scenarios where it must consider using Taunt first in order to prevent a crucial status move. These two exceptions are against Mega Mawile and non-Occa Berry Taunt Whimsicott; both of them are coinflips. Against Mega Mawile, Victini must either use Taunt if Mega Mawile uses Swords Dance or use Z-Celebrate if Mega Mawile attacks immediately. Against Whimsicott, Victini must either use V-create immediately if Whimsicott uses Taunt or use its own Taunt if Whimsicott does not. Against Mega Charizard X, simply use Z-Celebrate followed by Stored Power, which will OHKO offensive sets and 2HKO Mega Charizard X if it is specially defensive; specially defensive Mega Charizard X will be both unable to outspeed Victini after a Dragon Dance and unable to 2HKO it with unboosted Outrage. Against Zeraora, after using Z-Celebrate turn one, act according to what move Zeraora uses. If Zeraora attacks immediately and does not get the small chance of KOing or uses Charge, use V-create for the OHKO. If it uses Bulk Up, use Stored Power. Even if Stored Power does not OHKO, Zeraora will be unable to KO Victini before another Stored Power KOes it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fast Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon like Electrium Z Zeraora and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu can beat Water-types like Mega Gyarados, Greninja, and Mega Slowbro. In return, Victini can take care of Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Venusaur. Mold Breaker Outrage users, namely Choice Scarf Haxorus and Mega Gyarados, can beat Dragonite, one of the greatest threats in 1v1.

It is the highest Base Power move on the set, so it is used to KO Pokemon like Donphan after Sturdy is broken. Blue Flare takes out Pokemon weak to Fire such as Magearna, Celesteela, Mega Metagross, and Serperior. Glaciate can slow down the opposing Pokemon while also dealing chip damage, which is useful against foes like offensive Mega Charizard X and slow or Choice Band Dragonite sets. It can also beat Zygarde most of the time. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple physical attackers as well as do a little bit of chip damage to beat Donphan, Golem, and physical Dragonite.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>80 HP and 248 Defense EVs is are the most efficient way to tank both burned Golem's Tectonic Rage followed by Sucker Punch, as well as special Dragonite's Supersonic Skystrike followed by Extreme Speed. The extra 180 EVs are put into Special Attack with a Modest nature for maximized reliability in matchups reliant on damage rolls.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Glaciate if Victini can survive the current turn and will outspeed the foe on the next turn. This is useful if the foe already outspeeds Victini or is using a Speed-boosting move, like in the case of offensive Mega Charizard X or special Dragonite. Victini should use Will-O-Wisp if there is an ability like Multiscale or Sturdy that only works with maximum HP, such as against Dragonite or Donphan. Against Kommo-o, go for Shattered Psyche, which should always OHKO it as long as Victini is faster. This variant of Victini can lure in Donphan, Golem, and slow Dragonite sets as well as Choice Band Dragonite, as Victini usually has a poor matchup against these threats. Keep in mind that Victini will not reliably beat a Dragonite that outspeeds it and will lose to Choice Scarf variants. If Donphan is running Bulldoze, Victini will have to anticipate it with Glaciate, although Bulldoze Donphan is not very common. Victini will also have to predict Mega Metagross's use of Substitute by using Blue Flare immediately rather than Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fast Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon like Electrium Z Zeraora and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu can beat Water-types like Mega Gyarados, Greninja, and Mega Slowbro.

    "overview": "<p>Serperior plays the simultaneous role of a Leech Seed staller and an offensive presence in 1v1. If Serperior can seed its foe first and survive a slower move, it will almost always win the matchup. This will allow it to beat Pokemon that prove unable to muscle past its respectable bulk in one turn, primarily Pokemon like Garchomp, Mega Metagross, and Magnezone, proving excellent in striking down bulky offense. This is further augmented by Serperior's use of Protect and Substitute to play mind games and bait potentially devastating single-use moves from Tapu Lele, Aegislash, and non-Flame Charge Mega Charizard Y. The usual weaknesses of fellow Leech Seed stallers, such as Jumpluff and Whimsicott—Taunt and recovery moves—do not necessarily apply to Serperior; thanks to its powerful Leaf Storm and Contrary, Serperior can muscle past Pokemon that attempt to mitigate Leech Seed's usefulness, allowing it to strike down Pokemon like bulky Mega Gyarados and Mega Sableye. Unfortunately, despite these advantages it holds over fellow Leech Seed stallers, it still falls prey to strategies that almost all Leech Seed stallers will lose to: faster, powerful attackers and sound-based moves. Common Pokemon like Greninja and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z will find no trouble in OHKOing Serperior, and noisy behemoths like Meloetta, Mega Gardevoir, and Kommo-o will bypass its Substitute and hit it where it hurts.</p> ",

Overheat users like Mew and Heatran will have to watch out for Substitute, which can bring their Special Attack down by two stages and allow Serperior to Leech Seed them on the next turn.</p> <p><strong>Powerful single attacks: Serperior always has to bear in mind the threat posed by Pokemon like Porygon-Z and offensive Deoxys-S, which can launch off a single powerful attack and OHKO Serperior as it attempts to set up Leech Seed. Serperior can play mind games with slower powerful Z-Move users, like Tapu Lele and Aegislash, or slower recharge move users, like non-Flame Charge Mega Charizard Y and Mega Pinsir, but their matchups will never be clear.</p> <p><strong>Substitute bypassers: Slower Pokemon that are not blocked from attacking Serperior by Substitute will easily be able to face off against Serperior and OHKO or 2HKO it. This includes powerful sound move users like Uproar Meloetta, Bug Buzz Genesect and Volcarona, and Hyper Voice Mega Gardevoir. Hoopa-U can also bypass Substitute protection with its signature Hyperspace Fury. It should be noted that Mega Altaria, a prominent Hyper Voice user, will not be able to damage Serperior fast enough with Hyper Voice to seriously threaten it, unless Mega Altaria not only runs Fire Blast and a more specially offensive set than what is recommended, but also wins four successive mind games.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Serperior is heavily reliant on Leech Seed chip damage and will thus have a terrible time against other Grass-type Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn. This excludes non-Choice Band Kartana, which Serperior can break through with Leaf Storm before it can KO Serperior back.</p> <p><strong>Taunt users that resist Grass: While Serperior does have an excellent matchup against Taunt users like Mew and Tapu Fini, Pokemon that have the combination of access to Taunt, a resistance to Leaf Storm, and offensive presence will be able to take it down. These include the likes of Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Mega Aggron.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leech Seed allows Serperior to sap away health from its opponent for itself, allowing it to beat anything that it can outspeed, take a hit from, and land a Leech Seed on, like Avalugg and Garchomp. Leaf Storm is Serperior's STAB option which will boost its Special Attack after each successful use. This allows Serperior to beat back recovery users like Mega Slowbro and most Mega Altaria. Substitute is used to block attacks from opposing Pokemon, as well as give an extra layer of protection against Toxic users. Protect allows Serperior to avoid taking damage without losing a portion of its HP, unlike Substitute. When used with Substitute, it can also be used to PP stall moves with 8 PP, such as V-create from Choice Band Victini. Taunt can also be used to prevent Pokemon such as Crustle and offensive Mega Gyarados from setting up.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP and 24 Defense EVs allow Serperior to tank an Outrage from Choice Band Garchomp as well as an Air Slash from non-Flame Charge Mega Charizard Y and force mind games with it. 232 Speed EVs let Serperior outspeed base 110 Speed Pokemon like Mega Metagross. The 4 Special Defense EVs are leftovers, giving Serperior a better chance for playing mind games against Tapu Lele variants. Contrary is run in order to consistently boost the power of Leaf Storm as well as give much better odds against Metal Sound users like Aegislash. It also means that stat-dropping moves like Rock Tomb, Confide, and Metal Sound actually help Serperior instead, shutting down foes like Sawk, Type: Null, and Aegislash, which rely on these moves to gain the upper hand. Leftovers is run in order to give Serperior more recovery alongside Leech Seed, which, combined with Protect and Substitute, lets Serperior stall out slower Pokemon hit by Leech Seed indefinitely.</p> <p>184 HP / 72 Def / 252 Spe can also be run if you need to outspeed a few niche Pokemon, specifically Mega Lucario, while also Speed tying with opposing Serperior for better odds in the mirror matchup. These EVs also maintain the Garchomp matchup.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>After a foe is seeded, simply alternate Protect and Substitute to eventually sap away all of an opponent's health. If a foe can mortally threaten Serperior with a powerful Z-Move or recharge move, such as Aegislash, Tapu Lele, Z-Conversion Porygon-Z, and non-Flame Charge Mega Charizard Y, Serperior will need to play mind games to get in a position where it can land a Leech Seed without being KOed by using Substitute on the predicted Z-Move or Blast Burn or by using Leech Seed on a weaker hit that it can survive. Against Magearna, you should always use Substitute first, in case it is running the niche set of offensive Fairium Z. Only use Leech Seed after they use their Z-Move followed up by Fleur Cannon or if they don't break Serperior's Substitute on a turn. If an opposing Pokemon recovers while moving last, you should use Leaf Storm the following turn, which will quickly snowball into damage that exceeds the health they are recovering, most of the time. This is useful against bulkier threats like most Mega Altaria. If your opponent utilizes Toxic, use Substitute before Leech Seed in order to avoid being afflicted by the condition, such as against Porygon2 or Chansey. Against Fly users, specifically Choice item Landorus-T and Dragonite, use Substitute on turn one as well, which will allow you to avoid the potentially deadly damage and safely Leech Seed them. Serperior will have to play around a potential Outrage from Choice Scarf Dragonite, however. Against setup Pokemon that can potentially threaten Serperior, such as non-Rock Blast Crustle, Serperior will need to predict whether or not they will attack or use Shell Smash, and act accordingly. Mega Gyarados can potentially beat Serperior if it predicts the wrong set. If it's running a hyper offensive set, the winning play is to Leaf Storm twice, not bothering to Leech Seed, as Serperior can be 2HKOed after a Dragon Dance boost while failing to do enough damage without boosts itself. Using Leech Seed and Substitute turns one and two could leave Serperior open to a potential Taunt. Against bulky Mega Gyarados, Serperior will want to use Leech Seed on turn one and then use Leaf Storm, Protecting when they use Outrage to gain back HP.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Generally bulky Pokemon will be Serperior's greatest form of aid, as they will naturally be able to tank the hits coming off of extremely powerful Pokemon that Serperior cannot handle and retaliate in kind. Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, Magnezone, Meloetta, Tapu Fini, and Primarina can generally threaten some highly offensive Pokemon, including Mega Charizard X and Y, Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Greninja, and trickier foes like Aegislash. In return, Serperior threatens other bulky offense Pokemon that generally threaten these teammates, such as opposing Mega Gyarados, Magearna, most Mega Altaria, and opposing Magnezone. Choice Scarf Dragonite is a particularly good choice as well, as it provides not only the power and bulk to beat powerful threats to Serperior like Meloetta, Kommo-o, and Genesect but also the Speed necessary to outspeed and OHKO Greninja and Porygon-Z, whose Ice Beam and Hyper Beam would normally beat other bulky Dragon-types and, in the case of Greninja, other Dragonite variants that could play the role that Choice Scarf Dragonite provides. In return, Serperior beats back Fairy-, Water-, and Steel-type Pokemon that are not threatened by Dragonite, like non-Taunt Mega Mawile, Mega Metagross, Tapu Fini, and Primarina.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Emboar's above-average Attack stat combined with its ability Reckless makes it a threat to be reckoned with in 1v1. Its STAB moves alongside Head Smash allow it to OHKO common threats like Magearna, Heatran, and Mega Charizard X and Y. Choice Scarf allows Emboar to outspeed and KO some common fast threats such as Jumpluff, Naganadel, Modest Greninja, and Mega Lucario. However, defensively, Emboar's lackluster bulk alongside its Fire / Fighting typing makes it lose to common threats that can bulk for its moves, like Dragonite, Mega Gyarados, and Landorus-T. Furthermore, Emboar's lackluster Speed forces it to use a Choice Scarf to win most of its matchups. Additionally, even with the Choice Scarf boost, Emboar still can't outspeed common fast threats like Mega Lopunny, Timid Greninja, Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Zeraora, and offensive Deoxys-S. Also, because Emboar usually needs to use Choice Scarf, it fails to gain the offensive presence necessary to beat matchups that its coverage enables it to hit super effectively, like Mega Metagross and Mega Blaziken. Lastly, it faces rolls against Pokemon like bulky Victini and bulky Mega Charizard X when running a Jolly nature and is unable to outspeed Pokemon like Naganadel and Jumpluff when running Adamant.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Emboar can use a Choice Band set with an EV spread of 88 HP / 224 Atk / 96 Def / 100 SpD and an Adamant nature to take on threats like Mega Charizard X and Magearna; specifically, the 88 HP and 96 Defense EVs allow Emboar to take a hit from Mega Charizard X, and the 100 Special Defense EVs also allow it to take Magearna's Twinkle Tackle. However, it loses out on some of the matchups that Choice Scarf Emboar wins because of its Speed, like faster threats in Jumpluff, Naganadel, and Mega Medicham. Such a set can also run an EV spread of of 200 HP / 60 Atk / 248 Def and an Impish nature specifically to take Mega Metagross's Zen Headbutt and retaliate with a Flare Blitz. Emboar can also run a Firium Z set with the moves Will-O-Wisp / Blast Burn / Grass Knot / Flame Charge, an EV spread of 20 HP / 236 Def / 40 SpA / 212 Spe, and a Bold nature; this lets Emboar take a Z-Move from Donphan or Golem after they have been burned by Will-O-Wisp and KO them back with Inferno Overdrive or Grass Knot, but this is mostly a gimmick.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Hyper Offense: Most hyper offense Pokemon such as Greninja, Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Zeraora, and Mega Lopunny can outspeed and easily KO Emboar due to its lackluster bulk.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Offense: Most bulky offense Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Mega Metagross that aren't weak to Emboar's powerful moves, and some that are hit super effectively, can take a hit from Emboar and either set up turn one or KO it back with a powerful move.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Pokemon: Almost every Pokemon with the ability Sturdy, including Mega Aggron, Crustle, Donphan, Magnezone, and Sawk, can beat Emboar by taking a hit and then retaliating with a more powerful one.</p> <p><strong>Stall: Pokemon like Type: Null, Mega Slowbro, Mew, and Mega Altaria that try to stall out Emboar almost always win because of most of its moves, outside of Earthquake, have a negative effect on the user like recoil or Attack drops.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Head Smash is specifically for common Fire- and Flying-types, mainly Mega Charizard X and Y along with other threats such as Victini, Volcarona, Togekiss, and Archeops. Flare Blitz is Emboar's best STAB move and lets it primarily take on Steel-types such as Magearna, Celesteela, Registeel, and Mega Scizor as well as some prevalent Grass- and Bug-types such as Serperior, Ferrothorn, Genesect, Durant. Superpower is used mainly for Dark- and Normal-types like Mega Tyranitar, Incineroar, Weavile, non-Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, and Ambipom and one particular Steel-type in Heatran. Earthquake is used to KO Poison-types and some Fire-types, such as Nihilego and Infernape.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack EVs give Emboar the best chance against Naganadel with Earthquake. 252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature let Emboar outspeed Naganadel when holding a Choice Scarf. However, an Adamant nature can be run to more reliably beat threats like bulky Mega Charizard X and Victini, though Emboar loses out on faster foes like Naganadel and Jumpluff. 4 EVs are invested into Special Defense to give Genesect an Attack boost instead of a Special Attack boost. Choice Scarf is used to outspeed common metagame threats and KO them, such as Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y, Jumpluff, Mega Gardevoir, and Victini. Reckless is used to boost the power of Emboar's recoil moves, Flare Blitz and Head Smash, even further.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Certain Pokemon like Mega Venusaur, Mega Metagross, and Dragonite, Aegislash, Magnezone, Krookodile, and Porygon2 are capable of beating Emboar, despite its move options, due to their ability to lower Emboar's Attack, Sturdy, or amazingly high bulk, and should be avoided. Emboar needs to be wary against Pokemon that it needs rolls to KO, like bulky Mega Charizard X, Mega Gardevoir, and Victini, as they can all take a hit with dedicated investment and KO it back easily, so you need to bet your luck against them. Incineroar is a noteworthy matchup due to Superpower not always 2HKOing it, which may give it enough time to use a Malicious Moonsault followed by a Darkest Lariat to KO Emboar. Avoid speedier Pokemon that can outspeed Emboar even with a Choice Scarf and KO it, like Mega Lopunny, Greninja, and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. Emboar can't deal well with FEAR or gimmick Pokemon outside of Smeargle because of its Choice Scarf locking it into a move, so stay away from them. Examples of these include Aron, Mega Alakazam, and Togedemaru.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>A bulky offense Pokemon like Mega Gyarados, Dragonite, Mega Metagross, or Zygarde-C can provide an easier time versus hyper offense Pokemon like Choice Scarf Porygon-Z and Landorus-T, both of which can easily outspeed and KO Emboar; in return, Emboar can take down sleep users that these Pokemon struggle with like Jumpluff, Vivillon, and Breloom, as well as common threats like both Mega Charizard X and Y and Mega Gardevoir. Sleep inducers like Jumpluff and Mega Gengar can take down bulky Pokemon like Mega Gyarados, Dragonite, Mega Metagross, Aegislash, and Landorus-T. In return, Emboar can defeat Steel-types that these threats lose to like Ferrothorn and Genesect. Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Mega Venusaur, Tapu Bulu, and Kartana can take down the common Water- and Ground-types that Emboar loses to, such as Primarina, Tapu Fini, Donphan, and Golem. In return, Emboar can beat Mega Charizard X and Y and common Flying-types like Celesteela, Vivillon, Mega Pinsir, and Jumpluff. Tanky Pokemon, especially Steel-types such as Celesteela, Mega Metagross, and Ferrothorn, that can take moves from Tapu Lele, Porygon-Z, and Greninja are helpful partners for Emboar. In return, Emboar can take down Mega Charizard X and non-bulky Victini, which these are weak to.</p> "

  "Gigalith": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting decent stats, good abilities, and a shallow-yet-usable movepool, Gigalith is an anti-metagame Pokemon that can beat some common foes in the 1v1 metagame like special and Flyinium Z Dragonite, Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Porygon-Z. Its overall bulk lets it tank some hits like an Outrage from Mega Charizard X and special attacks like Solar Beam from Mega Charizard Y and, when further enhanced by Sand Stream, more powerful special attacks like Dragonium Z-boosted Draco Meteor from Dragonite, Draco Meteor from Naganadel, Shattered Psyche from boosted bulky Tapu Lele, and Hyper Beam from Mega Gardevoir. It also has access to setup moves like Curse and, more importantly, Laser Focus, which, in tandem with each other, let Gigalith beat bulkier threats like Mega Altaria and Noble Roar Kyurem. Its mono-Rock typing makes it less vulnerable to attacks from Grass-, Fighting-, and Steel-types that would threaten other prominent Rock-types, giving it a niche over Mega Tyranitar, Golem, and Mega Diancie. In spite of all this, Gigalith is weak offensively to common types in the 1v1 metagame like Steel, Ground, and Fighting. This puts it at a disadvantage against Pokemon like Magearna, Zygarde, and Kommo-o, which can set up against Gigalith and knock it out. Also, its subpar Speed means it can't beat fast Pokemon dependent on status moves to win, like Smeargle, Kee Berry Mew, and Jumpluff. Without setting up, it lacks the offensive punch to KO bulkier Pokemon, so Taunt from Pokemon like Mega Gyarados and Mew effectively prevent Gigalith from setting up. This also leaves it unable to beat physically bulky Pokemon immune to critical hits, like Mega Slowbro and Type: Null. All this severely reduces its usability in favor of other Rock-type Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Terrakion.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sturdy is another ability Gigalith can use to survive one hit from Pokemon like Mega Blaziken and Pheromosa, but it loses out on the bulk that Sand Stream brings to the table, stopping it from beating bulky Pokemon like Dragonite and Mega Gardevoir.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective Attackers: Barring few Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, most attackers that use super effective STAB moves on Gigalith are bulky enough to take any hit Gigalith throws at them or just brute force their way past its defenses. These include Water-type Pokemon like Mega Gyarados, Steel-type Pokemon like Mega Metagross, Fighting-type Pokemon like Kommo-o, and Ground-type Pokemon like Zygarde.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon: Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Celesteela and setup Pokemon like Kee Berry Mew and Taunt Deoxys-S can tank any hit Gigalith throws at them and effectively boost their defenses to a level at which Gigalith finds itself unable to defeat them.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Critical Hits: Pokemon like Type: Null and Mega Slowbro hinder Gigalith's main ability to use Laser Focus for a 100% critical hit and can therefore stall out Gigalith's attacks with their own boosting moves and win the matchup.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Users: Pokemon like Mega Swampert, Smeargle, and Jumpluff can put Gigalith to sleep and can render it incapable of using its moves before getting put in a losing situation.</p> ",

Laser Focus lets Gigalith beat Defense-boosting Pokemon like Clefable and Kyurem. This also lets it force Taunt + Z-Reflect Tapu Lele into a mind game. Curse lets Gigalith set up against Pokemon that don't always get KOed by Continental Crush, like Flyinium Z Dragonite. It also lets it take a second hit from Pokemon like Haxorus. Earthquake lets it take on certain Steel-type Pokemon like Grassium Z Heatran and Laser Focus Aegislash, which don't take much damage from Continental Crush. Protect is also an option that lets Gigalith more reliably beat special or mixed Dragonium Z Dragonite and reduces the mind games against Tapu Lele. Rock Blast can also be used to beat Substitute users like Jumpluff and Whimsicott, or Counter users like Crustle.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 EVs in HP and 252 EVs in Special Defense along with a Careful nature give Gigalith the best chance of taking two Flash Cannons from Heatran. This also improves its odds of tanking hits from hard-hitting specially attacking Pokemon like Porygon-Z, Tapu Lele, and Mega Gardevoir. The Defense IVs are reduced to 18 to avoid giving Genesect a Special Attack boost from Download, thus granting Gigalith a better chance of beating Choice Scarf variants. The remaining EVs are dumped into Attack.</p> <p>An alternative EV spread of 168 HP / 104 Atk / 236 Def with a Relaxed nature and Superpower can also be utilized to reliably beat non-Substitute Mega Lopunny, Registeel, and Choice Scarf Excadrill.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Curse once against bulkier foes like Mega Altaria, most Porygon2, and Curse Mega Scizor before using Laser Focus, since these Pokemon need more than a +1 boost to be taken down. A combination of Sand Stream-boosted bulk and Continental Crush allows Gigalith to tank a +1 Hyper Beam from bulkier variants of Mega Gardevoir but only one from offensive variants while being able to KO any variant with Continental Crush + Stone Edge + 2 turns of Sandstorm damage. So, against Mega Gardevoir, always use Continental Crush turn 1, followed by Stone Edge, even if it uses Will-O-Wisp. Against bulky Tapu Lele, there are two options; you can either use Laser Focus turn 1 if you predict the Tapu Lele to use Z-Reflect, or you can use Continental Crush right away if you predict them to use their offensive moves or Taunt on the first turn. Avoid sending in Gigalith against defensive Pokemon like Toxic + Foul Play Porygon2 and especially against those immune to critical hits like Mega Slowbro and Type: Null.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Grass-types like specially defensive Tapu Bulu and Ferrothorn are great teammates because they can take on bulky Water-type and Ground-type Pokemon like Mega Gyarados, Tapu Fini, Donphan, Zygarde, and Kommo-o for Gigalith, with Gigalith taking care of Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran for these Pokemon. For similar reasons, Steelium Z Celesteela can also be counted upon as a teammate. While it loses to Tapu Fini and Zygarde, it takes care of Mega Metagross, Landorus-T, Mega Slowbro, and Aegislash for Gigalith, with Gigalith taking on Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Incineroar, and Zeraora in return. Some Pokemon that benefit from Gigalith KOing Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Porygon-Z, and some Dragonite variants, such as specially defensive Mega Mawile and Genesect, appreciate it as a teammate. In turn, these Pokemon can beat Mega Gyarados, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Lopunny for Gigalith.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Sawk is one of the premier Fighting-type Pokemon in 1v1, as thanks to access to Sturdy coupled with a good Speed tier that allows it to outspeed bulky offensive threats like Magearna and Magnezone, it poses a huge threat to a wide range of the 1v1 metagame. Furthermore, its ability to run a lot of great viable item options, such as Fightinium Z and Choice Scarf, allows it to fill many potential different roles and adds to its unpredictability in Team Preview. It can deal with hyper offensive Pokemon like Greninja, Kartana, and Hoopa-U by taking a hit with Sturdy and hitting back hard or utilizing a Choice Scarf to outspeed them while also being able to take on bulkier Pokemon like Deoxys-S and Magearna with utility moves like Laser Focus. Its access to strong coverage moves like Stone Edge, Rock Tomb, Ice Punch, and Poison Jab allows it to cover Flying-, Poison-, and Fairy-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Jumpluff, Naganadel, and Mega Gardevoir that resist Fighting. Unfortunately, 1v1 also has a myriad of bulky Pokemon that can generally brush off any of Sawk's attacks, like Mega Slowbro, Mew, Mega Sableye, and Mega Venusaur. Common priority move users like Donphan and Mold Breaker Pokemon like Haxorus also have ways of dealing with Sturdy users and make it hard for Sawk to keep up.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>On the Fightinium Z set, Sawk can opt to run other moves in the last two slots, such as Poison Jab for Whimsicott; however, these usually come at too great a cost, losing out on important matchups like non-Substitute Mega Lopunny for Protect and Mega Gyarados for Bulk Up. A Choice Band set allows Sawk to beat Landorus-T and force Gyarados into mind games with Thunder Punch and Close Combat. This is generally not as useful as Choice Scarf or Fightinium Z, though, as it loses to Z-Conversion Porygon-Z and Mega Lopunny. A Poisonium Z set can be used as a lure for Tapu Fini and uninvested Primarina. This is usually not worth running over Fightinium Z, as Fightinium Z covers many more matchups, in particular Magearna, which is a much more common threat than the rare uninvested Primarina.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Pokemon Resistant To Fighting: Psychic-, Fairy-, Ghost-, and Poison-type Pokemon naturally resist or are immune to Sawk's STAB moves and can usually take a hit or two to guarantee a win over it. Bulky Pokemon like Mega Slowbro, Clefable, Mega Sableye, and Mega Venusaur are all very good answers to Sawk, as it does very little damage to them.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker Users: Mega Gyarados and Haxorus are two very common Pokemon that use their ability in Mold Breaker to punish Sawk's reliance on Sturdy. Choice Specs Necrozma, while not a Mold Breaker user, can use Photon Geyser to bypass Sturdy.</p> <p><strong>Priority Move Users: Mega Lopunny and Zeraora can break non-Protect Sawk's Sturdy with Fake Out and finish it off before it can attack, and both have ways of outplaying Protect via Substitute and Bulk Up or a Z-Move. Other Sturdy users like Donphan and Golem can tank any hit from Sawk before using their priority moves to beat Sawk. Primarina, Aegislash, and Dragonite can survive at least one hit from Sawk and use their priority moves to finish it off.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Bulky Will-O-Wisp users like defensive Mega Charizard X can break Sawk's Sturdy and mitigate its ability to deal damage, allowing themselves to KO it next turn. Rough Skin and Iron Barbs Pokemon, primarily Garchomp and Ferrothorn, can also be troublesome against Sawk, as Choice Scarf Sawk isn't guaranteed to immediately OHKO either one, and they can in return KO Sawk back after Sturdy is broken.</p> ",

Laser Focus lets Sawk power through Pokemon that rely on boosting their Defense to win, such as Magearna and Quagsire. Rock Tomb OHKOes Volcarona and uninvested Mega Charizard Y and lets Sawk outspeed Magnezone even after it uses Electroweb. Sawk has a few options for the last slot. Counter lets Sawk force mind games against Mega Mawile and Substitute Mega Metagross, as well as dealing with other Choiced physical attackers like Choice Band Dragonite and Garchomp. Protect is an option that blocks any potential Fake Out Pokemon from breaking Sawk's Sturdy, letting it potentially gain the upper hand against non-Substitute + Flail Mega Lopunny and Zeraora. Bulk Up gives Sawk a chance to beat Mega Gyarados and works nicely with Laser Focus to take on Defense-boosting foes like stall Deoxys-S.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment with a Jolly nature lets Sawk hit as fast and hard as possible. Notably, it can OHKO standard Magearna with All-Out Pummeling after using Laser Focus while also outspeeding Smeargle and bulky Mega Charizard X, something it cannot do with an Adamant nature. Fightinium Z turns Close Combat into a powerful All-Out Pummeling while also giving Sawk the option of Z-Bulk Up to increase its Attack further and bypass Taunt in order to get the best odds against Mega Gyarados. Sturdy is an incredible ability in 1v1, allowing Sawk to take a hit from most Pokemon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Naganadel can usually be taken down by using Rock Tomb turn one, followed up by an All-Out Pummeling, although Naganadel can sometimes survive given low rolls. Magnezone can use Zap Cannon to fish for paralysis against Sawk, which could make it an unreliable matchup against experienced players. Be aware that Fake Out users have countermeasures if they predict a Protect, as Mega Lopunny can potentially use Substitute, and Zeraora and Ambipom can use their Z-Move during the turn that Sawk uses Protect, breaking Sturdy. With Bulk Up, Sawk has a decent chance against Gyarados.

Sawk can beat specially defensive Pokemon like Magearna, Registeel, and Mega Charizard Y for them, as well as fast physical attackers like Choice Scarf Archeops and Darmanitan, while Greninja and Mega Gardevoir beat Mega Slowbro, Dragonite, and Mew reliably for Sawk. Greninja and Mega Gardevoir can take care of different Ghost- and Fairy-type Pokemon for Sawk; Greninja handles Aegislash and Tapu Bulu, while Mega Gardevoir handles Mega Sableye and Tapu Lele, and both can beat Z-Conversion Porygon-Z, Tapu Fini, and Primarina. Pokemon that beat bulky offensive Pokemon like Donphan and Primarina are good partners for Sawk. Celesteela and Serperior beat most Sturdy users reliably, besides Crustle, which Sawk is good against. Both of them also beat Mega Gyarados and Aegislash, and Celesteela also deals with troublesome Fairy-type Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Gardevoir, while Serperior fares well against stall-oriented Pokemon like Mew and Mega Sableye.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Whimsicott's Prankster, along with the combination of Leech Seed, Substitute, and Protect, allows it to outstall most non-Grass or Magic Bounce offensive Pokemon as long as it can survive one attack, regardless of if they naturally outspeed it. This can be useful against Pokemon like non-Encore Mega Lopunny and Zeraora. Whimsicott can also take on Fire- and Steel-types like Mega Charizard X and Mega Metagross when running Occa Berry or Babiri Berry, as this allows it to take a super effective attack that would usually OHKO it and affect them with Leech Seed. Thanks to its Fairy typing, Whimsicott can take on Kommo-o and Mega Gyarados with Moonblast, letting it defeat Pokemon that could otherwise beat it thanks to access to Taunt, strong attacking moves, or a natural Dark typing. Dark-types that can shrug off Moonblast damage such as Incineroar are a problem for Whimsicott, as their immunity to Prankster prevents Whimsicott from being able to SubSeed stall them. Whimsicott also suffers against sound move users like Porygon-Z and Meloetta, because both Uproar and Hyper Voice go through Substitute. Whimsicott also cannot do anything to opposing Grass-types like Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn, as they are immune to Leech Seed and can easily take care of it with their STAB attacks.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Encore can be used to trap Pokemon that commonly set up like Mega Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Taunt Mega Mawile. Leftovers can be used to help stall out low-PP moves like V-create from Victini; however, damage reduction Berries like Occa and Babiri to lure in threats against Whimsicott like Mega Charizard X and Mega Metagross are usually more useful. Yache Berry can be used in order for Whimsicott to survive Ice-type attacks from Greninja; however, Occa and Babiri Berry are more effective due to how common Fire- and Steel-types are when compared to Ice-types. Kebia Berry is another choice that halves the damage of Poison-type moves, which is particularly useful for baiting out common Poison Jab Choice Scarf users Sawk and Haxorus.  However, the downside of this is roughly the same as Yache Berry, as it's just blatantly outclassed by Occa and Babiri Berry in practicality.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types like Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Serperior are immune to Leech Seed, therefore making Whimsicott unable to do anything against them. A notable exception to this is Jumpluff, which will be unable to attack after being Taunted and must use Struggle.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks: If not running Occa Berry, Whimsicott cannot beat Fire-types like Mega Charizard X and Heatran. If Whimsicott is not running Babiri Berry, Steel-types like Mega Mawile and Mega Metagross can OHKO it. Ice-type moves from Greninja cause Whimsicott to be OHKOed before the Pokemon can be successfully attacked with Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: If Whimsicott is not running Moonblast, it is walled by Dark-types like Hoopa-U and Incineroar because they are immune to Prankster, therefore making Whimsicott's status moves unable to do anything.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Pokemon such as Tapu Fini can engage in mind games with Whimsicott, forcing it to choose to Taunt on a predicted Taunt or use a status move like Substitute or Leech Seed on a predicted attack.</p> <p><strong>Sound Moves</strong>: Attacks that go through Substitute like Uproar from Porygon-Z and Meloetta, Hyper Voice from Mega Gardevoir, and Bug Buzz from Volcarona can easily take care of Whimsicott before it gets a chance to outstall these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Tapu Lele: Because of Psychic Terrain, Tapu Lele blocks Whimsicott from using Leech Seed and can knock it out with Shattered Psyche.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Whimsicott is unable to win against Mega Sableye or Mega Diancie because Magic Bounce renders them immune to Leech Seed.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leech Seed allows Whimsicott to get HP back after using Substitute and can effectively stall out the opposing Pokemon's HP. Substitute makes Whimsicott able to avoid Toxic from Pokemon such as Porygon2 and stall out HP after using Leech Seed on Mega Metagross and Mega Charizard X. Protect is useful after using Substitute to make Whimsicott able to keep itself healthy while stalling the opposing Pokemon. Taunt is useful against walls like Deoxys-S and Kee Berry Mew, as they become unable to use their recovery, set up, status, or Taunt Whimsicott. Moonblast enables Whimsicott to take on Dark-types that would otherwise be immune to Prankster like Hydreigon, Scrafty, and Mega Gyarados.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An Occa Berry allows Whimsicott to take Fire-type attacks from non-Choice Band Victini and Mega Charizard X, whereas a Babiri Berry lets it take on Steel-types like Mega Mawile and Mega Metagross. Prankster enables Whimsicott to always use its status moves before the opposing Pokemon unless it is a Dark-type, stalling out foes regardless of a Speed advantage.</p> <p>If Occa Berry is being run, use 240 HP EVs and 168 Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature, which allows Whimsicott to survive a Flash Cannon from Magnezone and Heatran, an Air Slash from Mega Charizard Y, and a Genesis Supernova from Mew. The remaining 100 Defense EVs are leftover EVs, enabling Whimsicott to take a Giga Impact from Mega Lopunny.</p> <p>If Babiri Berry is being run, 240 HP EVs and 60 Defense EVs with a Bold nature allow Whimsicott to take an Iron Head from Mega Mawile, a Meteor Mash from Mega Metagross, and a Giga Impact from Adamant Mega Lopunny. The remaining 208 EVs are used in Special Defense to improve Whimsicott's matchups against Choice Specs Deoxys-S and force a mind game between Blast Burn and Air Slash against Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Send Whimsicott out against Fire-types like Mega Blaziken, Mega Charizard X, Heatran and non-Choice Band Victini, or Steel-types like non-Taunt Mega Mawile, Mega Metagross, and Mega Aggron, depending on the Berry that's being run, as Whimsicott can use Leech Seed first, tank a hit with its Berry, and stall out the foe with Substitute and Protect. Be wary against Mega Charizard Y, because although Whimsicott can survive an Air Slash, it still gets OHKOed by Blast Burn even with Occa Berry. Thus, Whimsicott must either use Substitute on Blast Burn or Leech Seed on Air Slash. Against Choice item and stall users like Jirachi, Victini, Kee Berry Mew, and Necrozma, it is best to use Protect first to scout if they have Trick or if Necrozma is running Choice Specs or stall. If they do have Trick, use Substitute or Taunt to prevent this; otherwise, use Leech Seed and proceed to stall as usual. For Kee Berry Mew, it is best to Taunt turn one and then use Leech Seed and the combination of Protect + Substitute to stall it out of HP. Avoid picking Whimsicott to face Mega Gyarados unless it is running Moonblast. Against Landorus-T, it is best to use Substitute first to evade a potential Supersonic Skystrike or to take advantage of Fly's two-turn usage before using Leech Seed to stall it. Whimsicott has trouble with moves that go through Substitute such as Hyper Voice from Mega Gardevoir, Uproar from Porygon-Z, and Bug Buzz from Volcarona, so do not send it out against these Pokemon. Even with Occa Berry, Whimsicott should avoid facing Fire-types such as Choice Band Victini and Incineroar because it fails to survive a V-create from the former and has to rely on getting a double Protect to stall out V-create, and the latter avoids Leech Seed because of its Dark-typing.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Strong wallbreakers with like Meloetta, Victini, Mega Charizard Y, and Porygon-Z can help with Grass-types like Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Serperior. In return, Whimsicott can take on bulky offensive threats, like Mega Heracross, Mega Aggron, and Donphan for them. If you're running an Occa Berry, Pokemon that can beat Steel-types like Mega Charizard X, Heatran, and Incineroar are good partners for Whimsicott, as they help take care of Genesect, Serperior, and Mega Metagross. In return, Whimsicott can take on opposing Mega Charizard X, Primarina, and Kommo-o. If you're running a Babiri Berry, Water- and Dragon-types such as Tapu Fini, Manaphy, Haxorus and Garchomp make good partners for Whimsicott to take on troubling Fire-types like Mega Charizard, Mega Blaziken, and Heatran. In return, Whimsicott can take on offensive and defensive threats like Zeraora and Mega Gyarados for them. Pokemon like Meloetta, Mega Gardevoir, Porygon-Z, and Tapu Lele give Whimsicott trouble because of Hyper Voice and Uproar going though Substitute or Psychic Surge negating Prankster's usability, so Pokemon that can take care of these like Mega Aggron, Mega Metagross, and Mega Mawile are good to pair with it. In return, Whimsicott can potentially take on Fire- and Steel-type Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, non-Taunt Heatran, Magnezone, and opposing Mega Aggron and Mega Mawile that typically bother them. Whimsicott can also take on Donphan, Primarina, and Zygarde-C for them, regardless of the Berry being used.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Krookodile is an excellent physically bulky threat in the 1v1 metagame. Its defensive capabilities allow it to tank and power through a surprising list of common threats, such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Mawile, Heatran, and Mega Charizard X. Alongside this, Krookodile also can tackle opposing stall Pokemon, using the combination of Taunt and Rock Tomb to shut down Pokemon like Type: Null, Jumpluff, defensive Deoxys-S, and Kee Berry Mew. Unfortunately, Krookodile cannot operate as effectively against special attackers and will go down easily if hit by a powerful special attack, falling to the likes of Tapu Lele, Greninja, Meloetta, and Porygon-Z. Additionally, Krookodile is forced to heavily invest in Defense to be viable, leaving its respectable base 92 Speed stat mostly underutilized, and thus it falls prey to faster foes that can take advantage of it before it can react, such as sleep users like Smeargle and Breloom, bulky Flying-type Pokemon like Dragonite, Mega Gyarados before Mega Evolution, and Landorus-T, and faces mind games against faster opposing bulky setup sweepers, like Groundium Z Garchomp and the rare speedy Zygarde.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Tectonic Rage is Krookodile's go-to offensive option, blasting away Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Victini. Bulk Up boosts both Krookodile's Attack and Defense by one stage, which is necessary in order to break through bulkier threats such as Zygarde and survive attacks from slower physical threats such as Mega Mawile. Taunt is used not only to shut down PP stall from Pokemon such as Type: Null, Jumpluff, and Deoxys-S but also to prevent setup from Pokemon such as Zygarde and Crustle. Rock Tomb provides much-needed Rock-type coverage as well as speed control, allowing Krookodile to punish Mega Charizard X that choose not to Mega Evolve. It also allows Krookodile to deal chip damage in order to avoid potentially deadly Counters from Sturdy Pokemon such as Donphan, Golem, and Crustle.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>160 HP and 236 Defense EVs allow Krookodile to take a Fake Out followed by High Jump Kick from Jolly Mega Lopunny, as well as Hammer Arm from Mega Metagross, Play Rough from Mega Mawile after Bulk Up, and Overheat from Air Balloon Heatran. 56 Speed EVs allow Krookodile to outspeed base 110 Speed Pokemon after a Speed drop, most notably Mega Metagross, as well as slower Pokemon right off the bat, such as neutral-natured Magearna, Mega Mawile, and bulky Zygarde. 56 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature allow Krookodile to OHKO Mega Lopunny with Tectonic Rage. Intimidate is run to lower the foe's Attack, and it is Krookodile's only viable ability in 1v1, allowing it to better handle physical attacks.</p> <p>Krookodile can run a specially defensive spread with 244 HP, 108 Special Defense, and a Careful nature in order to survive a Draco Meteor from Naganadel. However, the loss of Defense and Attack investment means that Krookodile now struggles with  the Pokemon it used to lure in, such as Mega Lopunny.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against bulkier physical Pokemon, such as Mega Mawile and bulky non-Magnet Rise Mega Metagross, set up using Bulk Up before unleashing a Tectonic Rage in order to successfully knock them out. Deoxys-S will require Krookodile to lower their Speed with Rock Tomb before it can successfully land a Taunt. Against Mega Charizard X, use Rock Tomb turn one, as they may not choose to Mega Evolve immediately. If they do not Mega Evolve turn one, finish them off with Rock Tomb on turn two. If they do Mega Evolve, use Tectonic Rage. While Krookodile may have the advantage against some physical Pokemon that it can hit with it super effectively, such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Mawile, other, more offensive or faster Pokemon, such as Sawk and Mega Blaziken, can overpower Krookodile even after an Intimidate drop, and should be avoided.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Krookodile's main job is to serve as an overall check to physically offensive powerhouses, besides some exceptionally powerful Grass- and Fighting-type Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Mega Blaziken. This means that Krookodile serves as an excellent partner to Flying-type Pokemon that can shrug off Ice-type damage and beat Pokemon like Greninja and Genesect. Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Choice Scarf Dragonite, Togekiss, and Celesteela fit this role. They also appreciate Krookodile's innate immunity to Electric-type damage from Pokemon such as Magnezone and Zeraora. Krookodile also appreciates other Pokemon that can take care of Grass- and Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Victini, Mega Venusaur, Magearna, and Mega Mawile, which can either tank their attacks or hit them super effectively. In return, Krookodile can deal with their generally poor matchups against stall Pokemon like Deoxys-S and Kee Berry Mew thanks to its access to all of speed control, setup, and Taunt. Krookodile also appreciates Pokemon that can sponge attacks from specially offensive threats such as Greninja and Porygon-Z. Specially defensive Mega Charizard X, Mega Gardevoir, and Kommo-o can all do well against these foes, and in return they appreciate Krookodile's dominance over other physical attackers, such as opposing Mega Charizard X and Choice Band Garchomp. Krookodile also struggles to handle specifically bulky Flying-type Pokemon, such as Gyarados before Mega Evolution, Landorus-T, specially offensive Dragonite, and Steelium Z Celesteela. Therefore, Pokemon with excellent Electric- or Ice-type coverage can be run in order to defend against these Pokemon, such as Zeraora, Choice Specs Magnezone, Hidden Power Fire Greninja, and Icium Z Pheromosa. In exchange, Krookodile deals with the pesky Ground- and Steel-types that would bother its teammates, such as Donphan, Magearna, and specially defensive Mega Mawile.</p> "

Continental Crush should also be used against Pokemon like Porygon-Z that could hold Choice Scarf, as they can outspeed Crustle even after a Jolly Shell Smash.

In addition, a Dark and Fighting typing work very well with each other offensively, allowing Scrafty to beat Pokemon like Meloetta, Aegislash, and Heatran with the same set. Despite its rather low HP, its defenses are very high, allowing it to win some matchups even without Intimidate's help such as against Mega Metagross barring Iron Head flinches, Choice Specs Greninja, and Magnezone. However, Scrafty has a very middling base 90 Attack, so it is very vulnerable to Pokemon that can stall it out, like Kee Berry Mew, Mega Slowbro, and Zygarde. It is also slightly stretched thin in EVs, and it isn't especially versatile in its moves, items, or EV spread. Furthermore, it is torn between KOing Heatran and tanking Mega Lopunny or Magnezone's attacks, being unable to do all three consistently at the same time. It is generally not preferred over the other two Dark-type Bulk Up Intimidate users, Incineroar and Krookodile. Both not only have higher Attack stats, but they also have much better ways than Scrafty for dealing with stall.

However, this is generally not worth giving up Fake Out, as it not only messes with damage rolls, but these stall matchups are also prediction based. This pales in comparison to Scrafty's primary competition Incineroar's ability to beat both of these consistently and Krookodile's higher Speed and access to Rock Tomb for speed control.

Bulk Up boosts Scrafty's physical offense and bulk for it to take on Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Garchomp, and bulky Mega Metagross barring Iron Head flinches. Fake Out hits foes for chip damage and breaks Magnezone's Sturdy and Choice Scarf Dragonite's Multiscale.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>76 Special Defense EVs along with 252 HP EVs lets Scrafty tank a Gigavolt Havoc from Magnezone. 180 Attack EVs maximize damage output in order to most reliably KO things like bulky Heatran, Garchomp, and bulky physical Dragonium Z Dragonite. Intimidate is run to crucially lower the Attack of foes like Mega Charizard X and Garchomp.</p> <p>Alternatively, a spread of 244 HP / 100 Atk / 84 Def / 80 SpD can be run to always tank Mega Lopunny's Fake Out followed by High Jump Kick. However, this will sacrifice consistency against bulky Heatran and bulky physical Dragonium Z Dragonite.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Don't send Scrafty into Pokemon with defensive setup like Kee Berry Mew, Mega Slowbro, and Zygarde, as Scrafty does very little damage even after Bulk Up. Be aware of Counter from Donphan and Crustle, which can knock you out if you stop setting up with Bulk Up early. If the spread with 180 Attack EVs is being run, do not use Fake Out against Garchomp to avoid Rough Skin damage; however, if the alternate spread with 84 Defense EVs is being run, use Fake Out first to secure the KO. Against Registeel, you should use Bulk Up four times before using two High Jump Kicks followed by Black Hole Eclipse. If Registeel uses Seismic Toss before it reaches +6 Defense, just begin using High Jump Kick early too. Against Zeraora, Scrafty will need to predict whether it is running Bulk Up + Electrium Z or not. If it is not, use Black Hole Eclipse immediately for the KO. If it is, set up Bulk Up once while they also use Bulk Up. While Scrafty will still have the advantage in damage rolls in the case of a misprediction, for maximum reliability Scrafty will need to attack immediately against another Bulk Up from Zeraora or set up Bulk Up again before attacking against a Charge from Zeraora. Against offensive Mega Metagross, use Black Hole Eclipse, and use Bulk Up against bulky variants. Fake Out's damage will help you tell how much bulk it has. Against bulky Mega Charizard X, use Bulk Up twice, and then use Black Hole Eclipse followed by High Jump Kick. If you see it's offensive by damage rolls from Fake Out, forego setting up the second Bulk Up, and attack with Black Hole Eclipse. If Mega Gyarados does not have Taunt, use Bulk Up immediately, and use attacking moves according to if it has Mega Evolved or not. If Gyarados does have Taunt, you will need to predict when it uses Taunt by not using Bulk Up and when it will Mega Evolve, using Foul Play or High Jump Kick accordingly. Although Gyarados can win, this matchup is still in Scrafty's favor.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can beat Fairy-types like Mega Charizard Y, Magnezone, and Ferrothorn can greatly help cover Scrafty's deathly weakness to Fairy, beating Pokemon like Magearna, Mega Mawile, Mega Gardevoir, Tapu Lele, and Primarina. In return, Scrafty can beat Pokemon like Heatran, Mega Charizard X, and Garchomp. Clefable can beat Pokemon like Dragonite, Mega Charizard Y, and Landorus-T. In return, Scrafty can beat Pokemon like Mega Metagross, Meloetta, and Magnezone. Stallbreakers like Serperior and Tapu Bulu can beat Pokemon that are too bulky for Scrafty to handly like Zygarde, Kee Berry Mew, and Mega Slowbro. In return, Scrafty can beat foes like Victini, Incineroar, and Naganadel.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Carracosta is a powerful Pokemon thanks to its combination of Shell Smash, mixed offense movepool, Sturdy, and priority moves. With Shell Smash and Waterium Z, it can outpace and OHKO a lot of Pokemon such as Heatran, Landorus-T, and Porygon-Z, while priority in Aqua Jet allows it to beat opposing Sturdy Pokemon such as Magnezone, Crustle, and Trace users like Mega Gardevoir. Because Carracosta can run a mixed set, it can easily threaten defensive Pokemon and isn’t threatened by Will-O-Wisp from Mega Charizard X or Mega Gardevoir like many other Sturdy Pokemon are. Unfortunately, Carracosta can't effectively run mixed STAB attacks, priority, Shell Smash, and coverage in one set and individual sets lose out on key power that could be helpful. It also is reliant on its STAB moves, meaning Pokemon that resist them like Mega Venusaur can easily beat it. It's also extremely slow and can be beaten by faster priority users like Donphan or can be prevented from setting up by Taunt users like Tapu Lele.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A physical set with Rockium Z that runs Stone Edge with Earthquake for coverage can be used to target Flying-types like Dragonite as well, but isn't as strong against Steel-types and is more susceptible to Will-O-Wisp. Ice Beam provides good coverage that complements Carracosta's STAB attacks if it commits to a being a full special attacker. These moves can threaten Dragon-types like Groundium Z Garchomp.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Type Resistances: Bulky Water-, Grass-, and Dragon-types such as Mega Gyarados, Primarina, Mega Venusaur, Whimsicott, Kommo-o, and Mega Altaria can all take Hydro Vortex before attacking.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out Users: Mega Lopunny, Zeraora, and Mega Medicham all use Fake Out to break Carracosta’s Sturdy before KOing it with a powerful STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fast Priority Pokemon: Pokemon that can take Carracosta's moves and respond with their own priority moves such as Donphan and Dragonium Z Dragonite can shut down Carracosta without giving it too many opportunities to attack.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Walls: Mixed walls such as Umbreon, Clefable, and Quagsire can boost their already high defenses even higher and tank Carracosta's boosted attacks.</p> <p><strong>Taunt users: Certain Taunt users like Tapu Lele and Mega Sableye can attempt to stop Carracosta from raising its stats with Shell Smash; however, this can be somewhat worked around if Carracosta attacks when they use Taunt.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shell Smash allows Carracosta to boost both its offensive stats and Speed and OHKO opposing Pokemon like Mega Charizard X and Mega Metagross at the start of turn 2. Hydro Pump is the special Water-type STAB move used as the base for Hydro Vortex to KO most opposing Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Magearna. Aqua Jet can finish off opposing Sturdy Pokemon such as Magnezone and Crustle and can help deal additional necessary chip damage to Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y. This also can be used for a physical Hydro Vortex, which can aid against Pokemon like Magearna. Aqua Tail is a second option for Hydro Vortex that can take out Calm Mind Pokemon such as Meloetta or naturally specially defensive Pokemon like Chansey. Alternatively, Rock Slide can be used against Pokemon that resist Carracosta's Water-type STAB moves such as Kyurem and Araquanid. Protect can be run to alleviate the threat of Fake Out from certain Pokemon, such as Mega Medicham.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Waterium Z powers up Hydro Pump, Aqua Tail, or Aqua Jet to Hydro Vortex to deal as much damage as possible. 240 Speed EVs and a Naive nature allow Carracosta to outspeed base 110 Pokemon after a Shell Smash, notably Mega Metagross. Special Attack is maximized to boost the power of special Hydro Vortex, since Carracosta already has superb Attack, and the remaining EVs go into Attack in order to aid against Mega Charizard Y with physical Hydro Vortex followed by Aqua Jet. Sturdy allows Carracosta one free turn to set up Shell Smash.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against most bulky Pokemon like Mega Metagross, Tapu Lele, and Meloetta, turn 1 can be used to set up Shell Smash. However, against Pokemon faster or potentially faster than base 110 such as Choice Scarf Porygon-Z and Speed Boost Mega Blaziken and against opposing Sturdy or Trace users like Magnezone and Gardevoir, turn 1 should be used to attack. Against Pokemon that can boost either or both defensive stats, such as Magearna, Z-Celebrate Meloetta, and Z-Conversion Porygon-Z, it is ideal to repeatedly use Shell Smash as long as Sturdy remains intact, and only Attack if your Sturdy is broken or you have maxed out your offensive stats.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Carracosta is particularly strong when paired with Fire- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, Mega Venusaur, and Kartana. Carracosta can cover the opposing Fire-types like Mega Charizard X and opposing Heatran for them while the Fire-types can threaten Serperior and Ferrothorn and the Grass-types can threaten opposing Water-types like Primarina and Tapu Fini. Choice Scarf users like Porygon-Z, Landorus-T, and Victini are helpful in dealing with Fake Out users like Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham and Zeraora. In return, Carracosta can get through bulkier Pokemon such as Meloetta and Heatran with the help of Shell Smash. Electric-types like Zeraora and Magnezone can also be helpful, as they can deal with bulky Water-types such as Primarina and Tapu Fini that Carracosta struggles with, while Carracosta can deal with annoying Ground-types like Landorus-T and non-Extreme Speed Zygarde.</p> "

  "Archeops": {
    "overview": "<p>Archeops's great offensive typing coupled with a mammoth Attack stat, Choice Band, and access to high-Base Power STAB and coverage moves like Head Smash and Outrage paves its way for being a fast powerful attacker. Its base 110 Speed stat lets it outspeed top-tier threats including Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, non-Choice Scarf Garchomp, Durant, Mega Pinsir, and Speed tie with Jumpluff. However, its typing leaves it weak to Water, Steel, and Rock, all of which are common attacking types, leaving it vulnerable to Mega Gyarados, Mega Metagross, and Mega Tyranitar. Archeops is also very frail, so if it fails to KO the opposing Pokemon, it's most likely going to lose. This also makes it lose against faster Pokemon like Naganadel and Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf users like Porygon-Z and Victini, as well as every Sturdy Pokemon like Golem, Donphan, Magnezone, and Sawk, all of which are very common. Archeops is also highly reliant on Head Smash for KOing foes, which is unreliable due to its relatively low 80% accuracy. Finally, its horrendous ability in Defeatist does it no favors, making matchups on Pokemon it could potentially 2HKO like offensive Mega Venusaur set-dependent, if they can live an attack and activate Defeatist, as well as harming the matchup against stall Pokemon like Porygon2 and Chansey.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The same moves mentioned in the Choice Band set along with Hidden Power Ice can be used with Choice Scarf with a Naughty nature allowing Archeops to get past faster threats like Naganadel, Landorus-T, Zeraora, Mega Lopunny, and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z while still defeating Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y. However, without Choice Band, it can no longer defeat the likes of Dragonite, Psychium Z Tapu Lele, and physically bulky Primarina. Flyinium Z with Sky Attack provides it a devastating 200-Base Power Supersonic Skystrike while Rockium Z + Head Smash becomes a powerful 200 Base Power Continental Crush with perfect accuracy; however, using Z-Crystals over Choice Band reduces the power of its other moves and leaves it devoid of coverage moves, which results in losing of some of the Pokemon which the Choice Band set can defeat. Moreover, Choice Band-boosted Head Smash hits harder than Continental Crush, always OHKOing HP-invested Dragonite through Multiscale while the latter depends on a roll to do so.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-type Pokemon like Mega Metagross, Mega Aggron, Aegislash, Magearna, and Mega Mawile are commonly used in the 1v1 metagame, resist both of Archeops's STAB moves, and are bulky enough to tank an Earthquake and retaliate with their super effective Steel-type moves. However, Kartana can be defeated with Heat Wave, and Durant also gets OHKOed by Head Smash.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Greninja, Zeraora, Mega Lopunny, and Choice Scarf users like Garchomp, Tapu Lele, Victini, and Genesect outpace Archeops and are able to take it out with their attacks. However, all of these Pokemon except for Garchomp can be defeated by Choice Scarf variants.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Pokemon: Sturdy Pokemon like Golem, Donphan, Sawk, and Magnezone are able to take one hit and OHKO Archeops back with their powerful moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon: Bulky Pokemon like Zygarde-C and Mega Slowbro can easily take Archeops's attacks and defeat it using their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Archeops loses to most Water-type Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, Greninja, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Swampert. Greninja outspeeds and OHKOes it, while the others are able to take a hit from it and OHKO it with their super effective Water-type STAB moves.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Head Smash, despite its relatively low accuracy, is a great Rock-type STAB move with a huge 150 Base Power that lets it OHKO Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Dragonite through Multiscale, bulky Tapu Lele, and Meloetta. Fly is Archeops's Flying-type STAB move, which allows it to defeat the likes of Mega Heracross, Mega Venusaur, Kommo-o, and Keldeo. Outrage combined with Choice Band lets it OHKO non-Choice Scarf Garchomp and can also be used as a more reliable move to KO non-Choice Scarf Haxorus. Heat Wave KOes Kartana and non-Choice Scarf Genesect reliably. Alternatively, Earthquake can be used to OHKO non-Choice Scarf Terrakion, non-Choice Scarf Excadrill, and Nihilego with ease without relying on Head Smash. Switcheroo can be used over Heat Wave to shut down defensive Pokemon like Chansey.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment with Choice Band lets Archeops hit as hard as possible, which is required to one-shot bulky Z-Move Tapu Lele, Dragonite through Multiscale, and Meloetta. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature lets it outpace Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, non-Choice Scarf Garchomp, Mega Pinsir, Durant, and Speed tie with other base 110 Speed Pokemon like Jumpluff and Latios, which can discourage your opponent from sending these Pokemon. Unfortunately, Archeops must use Defeatist, which reduces its attacks to half their power when it has less than half of its maximum HP remaining, costing it its matchup against Chansey after Head Smash recoil.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Some physically defensive walls that Archeops hits super effectively, like Zygarde and defensive Mega Venusaur, and Sturdy Pokemon like Golem and Magnezone, should be avoided, as they can tank its hits and retaliate with their own. While Head Smash should be the move Archeops relies on most, if one of your more accurate coverage moves can OHKO an opponent, use that instead, to avoid the chance of missing. It should be noted that Archeops can break through several impressive bulky offense Pokemon, who can usually tank even super effective hits, like Dragonite, Meloetta, and Kommo-o, and has pretty good odds against other defensive Pokemon like Primarina and Mew. You should avoid using Fly if you predict the foe to be carrying Protect or Substitute, as they can take advantage of the extra turn and avoid taking any damage, such as against Jumpluff or Whimsicott.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Archeops gets outsped by some hard-hitters like Choice Specs Greninja, Naganadel, Mega Lopunny, and Choice Scarf users like Garchomp, which can OHKO it. Fast Pokemon like Choice Scarf Porygon-Z can defeat all of these threats; in turn, Archeops can check Dragonite, Meloetta, bulky Mega Heracross, and Primarina, which are able to defeat Porygon-Z. Specially offensive Pokemon like bulky Mega Charizard Y offer support against Mega Gyarados, Greninja, and Mega Slowbro, which threaten Archeops, while Archeops can deal with Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Dragonite, and Mega Pinsir, which threaten Mega Charizard Y. Similarly, physically bulky Mega Charizard X checks Steel-types like Mega Metagross and Magearna and Mega Lopunny, Magnezone, and Sawk reliably, which can all defeat Archeops, while Archeops helps Mega Charizard X in return by checking bulky Z-Move Tapu Lele, Dragonite, Meloetta, and Primarina. Sturdy Pokemon heavily counter Archeops, so bulky Mega Heracross is a great teammate for Archeops, as it can single-handedly take out most of Archeops's checks including most Sturdy Pokemon like Golem and Sawk, faster threats like Mega Lucario, Greninja, Mega Lopunny, and Choice Scarf Garchomp, and most of the Water-type Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Swampert. Archeops in turn helps Mega Heracross by scaring off Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Dragonite, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Medicham, which threaten Mega Heracross.</p> "

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn is a prominent force within the 1v1 metagame due to its great mixed bulk in conjunction with its unique typing allowing it to defeat top-tier threats such as Magearna, Porygon-Z, and Tapu Lele. In addition to this, its wide range of setup moves such as Curse, Iron Defense, and Confide enables it to beat prominent physical and special threats like Porygon-Z, Zeraora, and Magearna. Its high-powered STAB moves such as Power Whip and Gyro Ball further help it have just a little bit of an offensive presence and beat Water-types such as Manaphy, Tapu Fini, and Primarina, in addition to Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie, Whimsicott, and Tapu Lele. However, Ferrothorn faces stiff competition with other Grass-type Pokemon such as Serperior, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Venusaur, which are all faster and have better recovery moves. Additionally, Ferrothorn has hardly any form of recovery outside of Leech Seed, which makes its job of stalling out Pokemon much harder to do, as it gets whittled down very easily. Lastly, Ferrothorn's 4x weakness to Fire means that top-tier threats such as Mega Charizard X and Y, Heatran, Dragonite, and Incineroar all have coverage moves to beat it no matter the situation.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rest can also be used for extra longevity; however, due to Ferrothorn having so many utility moves at its disposal that beat many prominent threats, it struggles to pick the proper moves to deal with all the threats necessary. Toxic has its benefits in whittling down Pokemon in tandem with Leech Seed; examples include non-Taunt Thundurus-T, Porygon2, and Avalugg.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Mega Charizard, Incineroar, and Heatran are all faster than Ferrothorn and can OHKO it with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Super Effective Coverage: Choice Scarf Togekiss, Hidden Power Fire Greninja, Choice Specs Meloetta, and Genesect are all able to 2HKO or OHKO Ferrothorn using their preferred Fire-type moves while taking very little or significant damage from Ferrothorn's STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Common Fighting-types such as Sawk, Kommo-o, and Mega Lopunny are extremely threatening to Ferrothorn, as they are all able to do significant damage to it and care very little about the damage that Ferrothorn does due to either their access to Sturdy or their ability to KO it before it does the same.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Ferrothorn is very vulnerable to Taunt because it leaves it unable to recover its HP with Leech Seed, meaning foes can stall it much more easily. Pokemon such as Mew, Mega Mawile, and Deoxys-S are all able to Taunt Ferrothorn and either PP stall it, use it as setup fodder, or outright 2HKO it using coverage moves, although you should be aware that Z-Confide can temporarily bypass Taunt in certain matchups.</p> <p><strong>Rest: Due to Ferrothorn's lackluster recovery moves, it tends to be horrible in the Rest PP stall department and will most likely lose, so beware of Pokemon such as Type: Null.</p> <p><strong>Hyper Offensive Wallbreakers: Numerous threats including Aegislash, Kartana, and Mega Pinsir are all able to use Ferrothorn as setup fodder and use their respective moves to beat it.</p> ",

Confide, when used as a Z-Move, boosts Ferrothorn's Special Defense by one stage and helps neuter special attackers such as Tapu Fini, Primarina, and Meloetta. Curse enables Ferrothorn to further boost its defensive capabilities in addition to its offensive abilities, helping it deal with foes such as Porygon2, Crustle, and the aforementioned non-Hammer Arm Mega Metagross. Iron Defense, while seeming inferior in the sense of not providing an Attack raise, boosts Ferrothorn's already great physical bulk to transcendent levels, lessening the damage from physical attackers such as Swords Dance Mega Pinsir. Gyro Ball is usually Ferrothorn's most powerful STAB move thanks to its exceedingly low Speed and is a reliable way to beat Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Diancie.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP and 176 Special Defense EVs make Ferrothorn capable of usually beating Magnezone, taking its Gigavolt Havoc in conjunction with Metal Sound after using Z-Confide. Furthermore, this investment also almost guarantees that Choice Specs Hidden Power Fire Tapu Lele won't OHKO Ferrothorn. Notably, 16 EVs in Attack ensure that Iron Defense Ferrothorn can almost always beat 0 HP EVs Swords Dance + Earthquake Mega Pinsir with Gyro Ball. The remaining 64 EVs are put into Defense, allowing Ferrothorn the chance to beat as many physical threats as possible, most notably neutral-natured non-Swords Dance Landorus-T. 0 IVs in Speed maximize Gyro Ball's damage output.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Leech Seed should in many cases be used almost immediately unless Ferrothorn is up against setup Pokemon such as Mega Pinsir, since Ferrothorn's lack of reliable recovery options can leave it whittled down very easily. Rest users such as Type: Null and Mega Slowbro should be avoided, as they can PP stall you once Leech Seed is set. In order to beat specially offensive Steel-types, like Magnezone and Magearna, you should first use Z-Confide, followed by Leech Seed next turn. Follow this up with more Confide to slowly whittle down their health while remaining out of range for their attacks, and once its health is low enough, finish it off with Gyro Ball. For simpler Pokemon such as Primarina and Tapu Fini, use Z-Confide and then use Gyro Ball until they are KOed while also avoiding being shut down by Encore from Primarina or Taunt from Tapu Fini.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to this Ferrothorn set being a defensive staller, offensive teammates such as Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Hoopa-U are beneficial, as they overpower Taunt users such as Mega Aggron, Deoxys-S, and Kee Berry Mew, while Ferrothorn can deal with some of 1v1's most metagame-defining threats such as Tapu Lele, Porygon-Z, and Mega Gardevoir. Ferrothorn appreciates Water-type Pokemon such as Tapu Fini, Primarina, and Mega Gyarados, as they take care of the Fire-types that choose to stand in its way such as Mega Charizard, Heatran, and Incineroar. Ferrothorn takes care of the notorious Electric-types such as Zeraora and Magnezone in return. Fire-types of your own such as Mega Charizard, Volcarona, and Incineroar are also worth noting because they help cover the Water-types' weakness to Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Serperior, and Tapu Bulu. Ferrothorn is able to synergize perfectly with the Fire-types, beating Rock- and Ground-types including Golem, Donphan, and Carracosta and completing the well-known Fire / Water / Grass core. Ground-types such as Garchomp, Mega Swampert, and Landorus-T are other options for beating the previously mentioned Fire-types, in addition to the fact that they can beat Steel-types such as Aegislash that Ferrothorn struggles to deal with. Ferrothorn can deal with Water-types that they struggle to fight against such as non-Taunt Mega Gyarados, non-Hidden Power Fire Greninja, and Manaphy in return. Steel-types that take neutral damage from Fighting-type moves such as Magearna, Mega Metagross, and Jirachi are generally very helpful, as they beat Fighting-types such as Mega Lucario, Pheromosa, and Sawk, while Ferrothorn can deal with the some of the Ground- and Ghost-types in the metagame such as Krookodile and Zygarde-C.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leech Seed enables Ferrothorn to chip threats such as Mega Slowbro, Mega Mawile, and Donphan to the point where Bloom Doom can finish them off. Bloom Doom is also Ferrothorn's main way of dishing out heavy damage, being able to OHKO non-Hidden Power Fire Greninja, Mega Blastoise, and Primarina. Substitute in tandem with Leech Seed is a great way to scout for stat-dropping or stat-increasing moves such as Metal Sound and Calm Mind or to chip down foes to the point where Bloom Doom can pick them off, such as Magnezone, Twinkle Tackle Magearna, and Crustle. Swords Dance is used to further bolster Ferrothorn's offensive capabilities, making it able to beat Mega Slowbro. Curse is an option in this set to boost Bloom Doom's damage output and to increase Ferrothorn's already great Defense stat to greater heights, allowing it to beat Umbreon and Foul Play Mega Sableye. Iron Defense allows Ferrothorn to enhance its already great bulk and beat physical Dragonite. Protect is another option if you want to stall out Leech Seed turns and scout for Z-Moves from Pokemon like Porygon-Z and Aegislash.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment and 32 Defense EVs with an Impish nature allow Ferrothorn to use Substitute against Choice Scarf Haxorus's Superpower, as well as boosting its special bulk. Additionally, 224 Attack EVs allow Ferrothorn to OHKO Choice Scarf Haxorus after two uses of Superpower and two rounds of Iron Barbs recoil, as well as ensuring it can OHKO non-Taunt Mega Sableye after a Swords Dance.</p> <p>Alternatively, Ferrothorn can choose to run 252 HP / 144 Atk / 112 Def alongside Protect to always beat Mega Lopunny, as well as having a chance of beating Mega Gallade if it uses Close Combat turn one.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Grassium Z can be used alongside not only Power Whip but also Leech Seed, allowing Ferrothorn to negate stat-lowering moves such as Metal Sound while also bypassing Taunt, enabling it to beat Mega Gyarados, Magnezone, and Mega Aggron. Substitute is a vital move and should be used almost immediately to either beat Pokemon that rely on a one-time nuke such as Twinkle Tackle Magearna and Breakneck Blitz Meloetta or avoid Scald burns from Mega Slowbro and Suicune. You also shouldn't be using Ferrothorn to fight PP battles against Pokemon like Type: Null and Mega Latias. It's better to try whittling down Sturdy Pokemon and use Ferrothorn's stat-boosting moves to its advantage against Pokemon such as Golem and Mega Tyranitar, to avoid a potential Counter.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to Ferrothorn's 4x weakness to Fire, you can opt to form a Fire / Water / Grass core team, as Water- and Fire-types both have a solid typing synergy with Ferrothorn and can deal with opposing Fire- and Steel-types. Water-type Pokemon such as Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Greninja are good teammates for Ferrothorn, as Ferrothorn can deal with the Electric-types such as Zeraora and Magnezone while they deal with Ferrothorn's massive weakness to Fire-types. Fire-types such as Incineroar, Mega Charizard X, and Victini can effectively deal with Grass-types that the aforementioned allies struggle to beat such as Mega Venusaur, Tapu Bulu, and Serperior, while Ferrothorn can deal with Rock- and Ground-types such as Golem, Carracosta, and Mega Swampert. Pokemon that can beat Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir, Primarina, and Magearna are greatly appreciated, as they deal with threatening Pokemon such as Sawk, Pheromosa, and Kommo-o, while Ferrothorn can deal with physical attackers like Mega Pinsir due to its high defensive capabilities. Mega Slowbro, in particular, is an amazing teammate for Ferrothorn, as it can deal with both Fire- and Fighting-type Pokemon, while Ferrothorn can deal with the aforementioned Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon. Ferrothorn is vulnerable to Taunt, so wallbreakers such as Garchomp, Kartana, and Tapu Lele that can deal heavy damage to Taunt users including Mega Mawile, Mega Sableye, and Mew are very much-appreciated partners. While the mentioned wallbreakers are very strong, they have trouble dealing with faster foes that Ferrothorn can beat such as Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. Finally, Ferrothorn has a hard time against faster foes such as Tectonic Rage Garchomp, Taunt Mega Aggron, and Aegislash, so having an agile teammate such as Mega Lopunny, Volcarona, or Greninja is very helpful in this aspect. Ferrothorn can also help deal with their vulnerability to strong heavy-hitters such as non-Hammer Arm Mega Metagross, Primarina, and Donphan.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Haxorus is one of the few viable Pokemon that have the ability Mold Breaker, allowing it to bypass abilities like Multiscale and Sturdy from common Pokemon like Dragonite and Magnezone. Additionally, its pure Dragon typing gives it only three weaknesses and one resistance, allowing it to take on a lot of Pokemon in the metagame thanks to its high Attack stat and vast movepool with high-Base Power moves like Outrage, Iron Tail, and Superpower let it break past Pokemon like Mega Venusaur, Tapu Lele, and Mega Tyranitar. However, Haxorus does suffer from mediocre HP, Special Defense, and Defense stats, which means it cannot take a Z-Move from Aegislash or live a super effective attack from Garchomp, Magearna, and Naganadel. Furthermore, Haxorus has an awkward Speed tier that allows it to outpace Tapu Lele, but not Pokemon like Mega Charizard X without having to run Choice Scarf and losing power. It is also outclassed by other Mold Breaker Pokemon like Mega Gyarados, which can check physical attackers like Landorus-T thanks to its pre-Mega Evolution ability Intimidate and can take care of Sturdy Pokemon that Haxorus can like Magnezone thanks to Earthquake while also taking care of Pokemon that Haxorus cannot take care of, like Donphan.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragonium Z can be used with Outrage and Dragon Dance or Swords Dance to have a powerful STAB Z-Move with setup, but it causes Haxorus to lose out on the raw power from Choice Band or the Speed boost from Choice Scarf. Waterium Z used with Aqua Tail can be used to help KO common Pokemon like Donphan and Golem, but this means that Haxorus will not be running Iron Tail to take care of common Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Tapu Bulu. Poisonium Z can be used with Poison Jab to lure in and take out Fairy-types like Primarina and Tapu Fini while also beating Pokemon it already can with Iron Tail, but this means it cannot beat Pokemon like Charm Mega Venusaur due to losing out on raw power from Choice Band or outpace Pokemon like Mega Lopunny with a Choice Scarf.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types like Mega Metagross, Skarmory, and Celesteela can take care of Haxorus due to their ability to easily take a hit, and KO back with its STAB or super effective moves.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types like Tapu Lele, Mega Gardevoir, and Tapu Bulu can take care of Haxorus if Iron Tail misses. Fairy-types that do not rely on a miss like Tapu Fini and Primarina can easily OHKO Haxorus, as they can take a hit from any of its moves.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Pokemon: Choice Scarf Pokemon like Porygon-Z with Hyper Beam can OHKO Haxorus if it isn't running a Jolly nature with Choice Scarf, and Genesect with Ice Beam can OHKO Haxorus before it gets the chance to move.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon: Bulky Pokemon like Mega Slowbro, Porygon2, Avalugg, and Chansey can easily eat any of Haxorus's attacks and stall it out or, in Chansey's case, KO it with Counter. Intimidate Pokemon like Mega Gyarados, Mega Mawile, and Landorus-T cut Haxorus's Attack stat, allowing them to survive a hit and KO in return with their strong STAB or super effective moves. Pokemon like Mega Sableye and Mew use Will-O-Wisp to burn Haxorus, making it easier for them to take multiple hits from Haxorus and eventually defeat it.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types like Garchomp and Naganadel can outspeed and OHKO Haxorus with their STAB attacks unless Haxorus has a Choice Scarf.</p> ",

Iron Tail allows Haxorus to check Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu and Mega Gardevoir; however, its low accuracy could be an issue. Rock Slide hits Pokemon like Mega Pinsir, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Charizard X that doesn't Mega Evolve. Superpower allows it to KO Steel-types like Air Balloon Heatran. Earthquake allows it to hit common Steel-type Pokemon like Magnezone and Excadrill. Poison Jab can be run in order to hit certain Pokemon like Whimsicott and Tapu Bulu more reliably, but will fail to OHKO Mega Gardevoir.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment makes Haxorus as fast and as powerful as possible. Choice Scarf allows it to outpace common Pokemon that would normally outspeed it and KO it like Mega Lopunny, Mega Lucario, and Greninja. An Adamant nature is an option to hit harder and secure a KOs on several Pokemon, such as non-Charm Mega Venusaur, whereas a Jolly nature allows Haxorus to outpace certain threats like Timid Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. Its ability Mold Breaker allows Haxorus to bypass abilities like Multiscale from Dragonite and Sturdy from Pokemon like Magnezone.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Be wary of the occasional Choice Scarf variant of Pokemon that Haxorus normally beats, such as Greninja and Naganadel. Be careful around Iron Defense users like Mega Slowbro and Magearna or common Intimidate users like Landorus-T and Mega Mawile, as Haxorus cannot beat them. Instead, send it against Water-types like Greninja and Volcanion as it can outpace both of these and KO them. It can also take care of fast, frail Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Zeraora thanks to its Choice Scarf.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Jumpluff is a good teammate for Haxorus in order to make Pokemon like Magearna and Landorus-T fall asleep and stall them out with Substitute and Leech Seed. Slowbro can take on physical attackers Haxorus cannot beat such as Landorus-T, Golem, and Mega Metagross. Sturdy Pokemon like Skarmory can take on Greninja, Meloetta, and Ferrothorn for Haxorus.

Iron Tail can hit Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Tapu Bulu; however, its low accuracy can be problematic. Poison Jab can be run instead of Iron Tail in order to more reliably beat Pokemon like Whimsicott and Tapu Bulu, but will be less reliable against Tapu Lele. Earthquake is for the common Rock-, Electric-, and Steel-types like Mega Tyranitar, Magnezone, and Excadrill. Rock Slide defeats Mega Charizard Y and Charizard that chooses to not to Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard X right away. Superpower can break down Pokemon like Air Balloon Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Jolly nature and maximum Speed EVs are used to outpace key Pokemon like Tapu Lele. 108 EVs in Special Defense allows Haxorus to live a Blast Burn from Mega Charizard Y. Mold Breaker allows Haxorus to bypass abilities like Sturdy and Multiscale from Pokemon like Golem and Dragonite. The rest are put into attack to maximize offensive output. Choice Band boosts its Attack even more, allowing to break through defensive Pokemon like Mega Venusaur.</p> <p>Alternatively, a simpler spread of 252 Attack and 252 Speed EVs can be used, which improves the rolls in a few matchups, such as against maximum Defense Zygarde and physically defensive Tapu Lele with Poison Jab.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Be wary of sleep users like Jumpluff, as it outspeeds Haxorus and uses Substitute and Leech Seed to drain its HP. Make sure that your opponent does not have a Dragon- or Ice-type move user on the team like Zeraora or Greninja, as both outspeed and can OHKO Haxorus. Do not send it out against bulky Pokemon like Mega Gyarados, Landorus-T, Mega Slowbro, Mega Aggron, and Charm Mega Venusaur, as both of these easily beat Haxorus.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Special Choice Scarf attackers like Porygon-Z can help take care of threats like Landorus-T, Genesect, and Mega Lopunny that Haxorus cannot outspeed or OHKO. Special attackers like Meloetta, Genesect, and Zeraora can help break down threats like Mega Slowbro and Mew. Sturdy Pokemon like Magnezone and Donphan and Pokemon like Genesect can help deal with Meloetta and Naganadel.

Steel-type Pokemon like Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn check Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu, Tapu Lele, and Mega Gardevoir more reliably, as Haxorus's Iron Tail has a chance to miss. It also helps with other Pokemon like Mega Gyarados, and Chansey. Jumpluff is a good Pokemon to pair with Haxorus as it can beat Pokemon like Aegislash, non-Rock Blast Golem, and Mega Metagross with its Substitute + Sleep Powder + Leech Seed set. Tapu Fini is another good Pokemon to pair with Haxorus, as it helps with Pokemon like Garchomp, Donphan, and Mega Sableye.</p> "

  "Durant": {
    "overview": "<p>Durant is a lesser-used but powerful Bug / Steel type in the 1v1 metagame, with very good stats that match its archetype very well. Durant's Speed is enough to outspeed the majority of the relevant metagame, such as both Mega Charizard X and Y, Meloetta, and Mew, allowing Durant to pick up KOs before it gets hurt. Durant can hit extremely hard due to its ability in Hustle; combined with a Choice Band, Durant gains the capability to OHKO some of the naturally bulkiest Pokemon in the metagame, such as Meloetta, Tapu Lele, and Heatran. Unfortunately, Hustle is also one of Durant's biggest drawbacks, as its accuracy drop makes it less reliable in matchups it should theoretically win, especially against Substitute stallers such as Whimsicott and Serperior. Additionally, Durant's one weakness, Fire, is a very common offensive type, and the 4x effectiveness prevents Durant from surviving almost any Fire-type hits, leaving it weak to several Pokemon like Genesect and Dragonite, which all wield Fire-type coverage moves. Lastly, Durant is very lacking in HP and Special Defense, making it vulnerable to sufficiently powerful special hits from Pokemon like Greninja and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rockium Z with Stone Edge can be run to eliminate the atrocious accuracy of Hustle-boosted Stone Edge against both Mega Charizard X and Y, two of the best Pokemon in the metagame, allowing Durant to more reliably beat both of them. However, the loss of power caused by taking away Choice Band leaves it lacking when facing other threats it could normally OHKO, such as Mega Altaria and Meloetta. Choice Scarf can also be run to lure in normal answers to Durant, such as Greninja and Porygon-Z. However, as with Rockium Z, this set loses the critical power needed in order to OHKO threats, such as Mega Charizard X, Mew, and Heatran. Durant can also choose to run a particularly evil set consisting of the move Entrainment with its ability Truant, replacing the ability of its target with Truant. This can be used to PP stall Choice item users with a combination of Protect, Dig, and Endure or Rest. However, outside of this niche, it utterly fails to PP stall anything else, especially setup offense, which will simply maximize their offense as Durant uses a move and wait until it runs out of ways to avoid damage, although this will end up taking double the amount of time, thanks to Truant.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fast or Bulky Special Attackers: Durant's horrible Special Defense can easily be taken advantage of by almost all of the special attacking Pokemon in the 1v1 metagame, assuming they either outspeed Durant or can survive one of its attacks. Pokemon such as Greninja, special Dragonite, Magnezone, Magearna, and Aegislash can all effortlessly eliminate Durant with any one of their powerful special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster or Bulky Fire-types and Fire-type Coverage: Pokemon that can take advantage of Durant's 4x weakness to Fire-type moves will easily dispatch of it, either by simply going first and knocking Durant out or surviving any single attack from Durant and roasting it. Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Victini, Genesect, Kommo-o, Fire Punch Jirachi, and Mega Camerupt can all obliterate Durant.</p> <p><strong>Faster Substitute Users: Faster Pokemon that can utilize Substitute to avoid damage will usually be able to fish for a miss from Durant and act from there to snag a win. Pokemon like Serperior and Whimsicott fall under this category.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Users: Sturdy Pokemon can all survive any of Durant's attacks and either OHKO it, get it in range of a priority attack, or use Counter to beat it. Sturdy Pokemon such as Donphan, Golem, Carracosta, and Skarmory will cut down Durant.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Iron Head is Durant's main STAB option, 2HKOing or OHKOing almost anything that doesn't resist it, such as Tapu Lele or Mega Gardevoir. Its 30% flinch chance can also allow Durant to cause the foe to flinch if there's no other way of winning. This is especially helpful against targets like Magearna and Crustle, which Durant cannot OHKO but can OHKO Durant in return. X-Scissor is a good secondary STAB move that can pick up KOs on Psychic- and Grass-types like Meloetta and Celebi. Although you won't be using X-Scissor a lot and it's the most replaceable move on the set, it's Durant's main way of beating Mega Slowbro and Mega Metagross. No Durant set is complete without Stone Edge, a valuable asset that allows it to KO any Fire- or Flying-types that don't outspeed it, most prominently Mega Charizard X and Y. With this set of moves, Durant would get walled by most Steel-types, but it also has access to Superpower, which helps it somewhat. With Superpower, Durant can OHKO Steel-type walls such as Ferrothorn and Heatran, as well as take out bulky Normal-types such as Chansey. Rock Slide can also be run instead of Stone Edge in order to more accurately hit targets such as Mega Pinsir, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard Y, though this leaves Durant unable to OHKO Mega Charizard X.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature are necessary to maximize Durant's Speed, allowing it to outspeed Terrakion, Mega Pinsir, and Nihilego and KO them. 56 EVs are put into HP in order to allow Durant to guarantee surviving a Fake Out followed by High Jump Kick from Mega Lopunny, as well as attacks such as a +1 Waterfall from Adamant Mega Gyarados, giving you the capacity to 2HKO it with either X-Scissor or Stone Edge and not fall to it after being hit by a boosted Waterfall. The rest is put into Attack to maximize Durant's damage output. Choice Band and Hustle add up to give Durant monstrous attacking power that allows it to KO maximum Defense walls such as Chansey and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against Mega Gyarados, you will need to either use Stone Edge, predicting them to not Mega Evolve in fear of X-Scissor, or use X-Scissor as they fear being hit by a Stone Edge. Getting either one of these plays correct will allow Durant to 2HKO Mega Gyarados. Avoid sending Durant out against Porygon-Z, as although Hyper Beam is resisted, it will still knock out Durant. Steel-types with a neutrality or immunity to Fighting, most importantly Aegislash and Magearna, can also defeat Durant with ease. Finally, bulkier Pokemon and faster Substitute users, like Whimsicott, Mega Metagross, Type: Null, Porygon2, and Serperior, should not be considered consistent wins for Durant; even if Durant can technically hit them super effectively, they can either spam Substitute or recovery until Durant misses a move, which is eventually going to happen, and then take advantage of the protection of Substitute or the drop in Attack from Superpower to win.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Durant doesn't like facing special attackers, but fortunately for Durant, Chansey really loves taking on that job, saving Durant from specially offensive Dragonite and Primarina. Mirror Coat Magnezone, or Magnezone in general, also does a great job of picking off things that threaten Durant due to its Sturdy ability, handling Pokemon such as Greninja, Magearna, and Naganadel. In return, Durant can threaten Fire-type Pokemon that normally seriously threaten Magnezone, such as Mega Charizard X and Victini. Durant is also threatened by physical attackers with Intimidate or Multiscale, most importantly Landorus-T and Dragonite, as they can take any hit from Durant and retaliate. These two are pretty hard to cover with just one Pokemon, but Fake Out + Ice Punch Mega Lopunny does a good job against them. In return, Durant can deal with the common bulkier Pokemon that Mega Lopunny struggles with the most, in particular, Meloetta and Mega Charizard X. Certain Fire-type Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf Victini and Mega Camerupt, Durant will not be able to defeat, and thus it will require the assistance of traditional Fire-type answers, such as Mega Gyarados and Primarina. Durant assists these Pokemon by blasting Grass-type Pokemon like Kartana and Tapu Bulu.</p> "

Its good Special Attack and Speed along with Quiver Dance give it the potential to outspeed most other Pokemon after one boost, such as non-Hidden Power Rock Naganadel. With Substitute, Volcarona can bring its HP under one third and unleash a devastating Swarm-boosted Savage Spin-Out. This move can overwhelm the majority of Pokemon that do not resist it, letting Volcarona deal with most Pokemon that are slower than it. Unfortunately, Volcarona's Bug / Fire typing is poorly equipped to fight extremely prevalent Flying- and Water-types like Dragonite, Greninja, Tapu Fini, and especially Rock-types and Rock-type move users like Crustle and Donphan. Despite excellent offensive stats, Volcarona has subpar defensive stats, and heavy investment is required to take even some neutral hits, such as Fake Out followed by Giga Impact from Mega Lopunny and Hyper Beam from Choice Scarf Porygon-Z.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Volcarona has a number of viable EV spread options. One is to completely forgo any HP investment and instead opt for a full-on offensive spread with maximum Special Attack and Speed to hit harder against Pokemon like Registeel and specially defensive Mega Heracross. A more physically defensive set with Will-O-Wisp over Substitute can be utilized to take on physical attackers like Donphan and Mega Medicham more reliably. Choice Specs is a possible item choice for Volcarona to boost coverage moves like Giga Drain and Hidden Power Ice, as well as its other STAB move Overheat, nabbing easier KOs on Pokemon like Mega Swampert, Landorus-T, and Mega Heracross. Hidden Power Electric can be used to allow Volcarona to lure in and take out Gyarados before it Mega Evolves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective STAB Moves: There are a plethora of Water-, Rock,- and Flying-types roaming the tier, such as Mega Gyarados, Archeops, Aggron, Golem, Dragonite, Mega Pinsir, and Landorus-T. Many Pokemon like Sawk and Choice Scarf Darmanitan also commonly carry Rock-type coverage, which is a huge threat to Volcarona.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Pokemon like Donphan and Mega Charizard X can take anything Volcarona throws at them while hitting it very hard with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon: Pokemon like Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Mega Lopunny, Greninja, Zeraora, and Mega Gengar all aptly deal with Volcarona due to their ability to outspeed and take it out.</p> ",

        "name": "Fast Buginium Z",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Bug Buzz is Volcarona's primary attacking move, which, when boosted by Buginium Z and Swarm, deals with Pokemon like Mew and Mega Tyranitar. It also goes through Substitute, which allows Volcarona to take on Pokemon like Whimsicott and Jumpluff. Overheat lets Volcarona blast away Steel-types like Aegislash, Mega Mawile, Mega Metagross, and Magearna. Quiver Dance boosts Volcarona's offensive stats and lets it outspeed and OHKO Pokemon like Mega Metagross and Haxorus after just one boost. It also means that Volcarona is able to set up alongside Pokemon like Magearna. Substitute gives Volcarona more opportunities to set up by giving it a safety net against status and powerful Z-Moves from Pokemon like Tapu Lele. It also helps bring Volcarona's HP low enough for it to utilize Swarm-boosted moves.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Volcarona Speed tie with opposing base 100 Speed Pokemon like Mega Medicham and offensive Mega Charizard X, as well as outspeed Tapu Lele, Meloetta, and non-Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. The 192 HP EVs combined with 52 EVs allow Volcarona to tank Zen Headbutt followed by Bullet Punch from Mega Metagross, as well as tank Draco Meteor from non-Hidden Power Rock Choice Specs Naganadel and Shattered Psyche from Tapu Lele after a Quiver Dance. 12 Special Attack EVs guarantee an OHKO with Savage Spin-Out against Normalium Z Porygon-Z. Swarm alongside Buginium Z and Substitute to use an incredibly powerful nuke in Savage Spin-Out at low health, along with any accumulated Quiver Dance boosts.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against special attackers like Aegislash, Mega Altaria, and Tapu Lele, use Quiver Dance so that Volcarona can survive their Z-Moves if they use them. If Tapu Lele uses Calm Mind, continue using Substitute until either Volcarona is in Swarm range or they do not attack. As long as Volcarona has the same number of boosts as Tapu Lele, it should OHKO it with a Swarm-boosted Savage Spin-Out. Naturally, some Pokemon, such as Normalium Z Porygon-Z, should immediately be attacked with Savage Spin-Out, as Volcarona can simply OHKO them without risk. Against stall Pokemon like Porygon2, it is better to use Substitute first to ensure that Volcarona is unaffected by a potential Toxic or other status conditions. Against Type: Null, Volcarona's best play is to wait for them to use Confide at least twice before using Z-Quiver Dance to reset its stats and outboost them with more PP. The chance of a Special Defense drop from Bug Buzz can almost help immensely in these situations, but it should not be relied upon. Against Pokemon Volcarona outspeeds but cannot OHKO, like Mega Tyranitar and Mega Venusaur, use Substitute until it has less than 33% HP. If at any point before this they do not attack or break Volcarona's Substitute, use Quiver Dance to further boost Volcarona's Special Attack and keep up the pressure; when Volcarona is under 33%, use Savage Spin-Out. Against non-Extreme Speed Zygarde, use Quiver Dance first to boost Volcarona's offenses. Volcarona will be able to OHKO it with a Swarm-boosted Savage Spin-Out at +1, so use Substitute if needed to get into Swarm range. Otherwise, if they are running Extreme Speed, Volcarona has to Substitute on Tectonic Rage and then use Quiver Dance followed by Savage Spin-Out. If the foe uses Taunt, gauge whether using Z-Quiver Dance or if just attacking is the optimal option. If Volcarona already outspeeds the foe, it is generally more worth it to just attack. For example, against Deoxys-S, it would be better to Z-Quiver Dance, but against Mega Tyranitar, you would rather just attack. Magnezone is a tricky matchup, as it is a coinflip as to whether or not they will use Metal Sound or Electroweb. With this information, attacking and using Quiver Dance are your best options, as Electroweb will break Volcarona's Substitute anyway.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As Volcarona is weak to Rock-type moves and threatened by other Fire- and Rock-types, Steel- and Ground-types are a perfect match. Mega Aggron and Donphan serve as good partners, dealing with Pokemon like Mega Charizard X and Y, Archeops, and Greninja, while Volcarona does away with Pokemon like Meloetta, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Venusaur that they typically struggle against. Volcarona's glaring Water-type weakness is easily covered by Kartana and Ferrothorn, which handle Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Mega Gyarados with ease. In return, Volcarona takes care of Pokemon like Genesect and Deoxys-S. Being weak to Fire-types also means that Water-types are a good partner for Volcarona, as they will cover different threats. Primarina in particular helps by beating pesky physical attackers like Golem and Crustle as well as Fire-types like Mega Charizard X and Darmanitan. It also checks Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. Meanwhile, Volcarona crushes any Grass-types that may threaten Primarina, such as Tapu Bulu and Mega Venusaur.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Roost lets Volcarona recover HP so that it can take multiple hits from foes like Primarina. Quiver Dance boosts Volcarona's offense and defense simultaneously, helping tremendously against foes like Mega Charizard Y and Porygon-Z. Bug Buzz is capable of dealing with many foes when boosted by Swarm and Buginium Z. Substitute allows Volcarona avoid taking fatal damage from potential Z-Moves like Oceanic Operetta from Primarina and brings Volcarona closer to Swarm range. Alternatively, Overheat hits Steel-types that resist Bug Buzz, like Aegislash and Mega Mawile. Will-O-Wisp is another option to lower the foe's Attack and deal chip damage, which is potentially helpful against physical attackers like Donphan. This is best run with Substitute to force a mind game.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The 240 HP and 32 Defense EV investment lets Volcarona survive a Zen Headbutt followed by Bullet Punch from Mega Metagross. The 20 Speed EVs allow Volcarona to outspeed Timid Magnezone. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Defense to almost always ensure Volcarona's matchup against Modest Magnezone and grant it enough bulk to tank hits like Hyper Beam from Choice Scarf Porygon-Z and Sparkling Aria from Primarina.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Send Volcarona in on specially offensive threats like Mega Charizard Y, Mew, Meloetta, and Porygon-Z. Against Mega Charizard Y, it may be necessary to set up Quiver Dance multiple times while using Roost when necessary to avoid taking fatal damage. If Porygon-Z does not immediately use Z-Conversion, use Savage Spin-Out after a single Quiver Dance. Otherwise, Quiver Dance twice before using Savage Spin-Out. With Substitute, Volcarona has a chance at beating Primarina. Usually it is safe to use Substitute to absorb the damage from Oceanic Operetta, and then Volcarona can Quiver Dance and Roost off any damage taken. Substitute can also be continuously used to safely bring Volcarona to Swarm range; this is useful against Zygarde, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Venusaur. Immediately use Bug Buzz against opposing Magnezone to break their Sturdy and get them in range of Overheat. With Overheat, Volcarona can take on Steel-types like Aegislash, Celesteela, and Mega Mawile; against Mega Mawile, immediately OHKO it, but set up Quiver Dance first against the others. Against Donphan and Aggron, use Substitute to scout for Head Smash. If they don't use it, or if they miss, Will-O-Wisp is the next best play if you're running it. If they do hit Head Smash, their Sturdy will be broken from taking recoil, and Volcarona will be able to OHKO them with a Swarm-boosted Savage Spin-Out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As Volcarona is capable of taking on most specially offensive threats, partners that can take on physical threats, namely Mega Gyarados, Mega Charizard X, and Dragonite, are appreciated. Flyinium Z Landorus-T and Mega Altaria are able to handle these aptly and are weak to specially oriented wallbreakers like Aegislash, Celesteela, Mega Charizard Y, and Porygon-Z, all of which are Pokemon that Volcarona can beat. Volcarona works well with Pokemon that can beat Rock- and Water-types like Archeops and Greninja, so Grass-types like Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn are cordial companions. In return, Volcarona is adept at beating Pokemon like Mew, Mega Charizard Y, Kommo-o, and Zygarde.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Terrakion's high Attack stat along with an above-average Speed tier, powerful moves, and Rock typing makes it an interesting anti-metagame Pokemon in 1v1. Its unique Rock / Fighting typing lets it beat an interesting list of Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Y, Tapu Lele, Mega Gardevoir, Porygon-Z, and Mega Tyranitar. Furthermore, access to utility such as Taunt, Swords Dance, and Rock Tomb allows it to set up and win against stall-based targets that would otherwise just win against it, such as Mew, Type: Null, Tapunium Z Tapu Fini, stall Deoxys-S, and Registeel. Unfortunately, Terrakion's poor bulk and only above-average Speed make it susceptible to faster, more hyper offensive Pokemon like Greninja, Zeraora, Choice Scarf Haxorus, Mega Lopunny, Naganadel, Pheromosa, and offensive Deoxys-S. Lastly, Terrakion's Attack stat is high, but there are many bulky Pokemon in the metagame that can survive a hit from it, such as bulky Dragonite, Mega Slowbro, and Primarina.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A standard Terrakion set with Substitute and Earthquake can also be utilized, mostly to reliably beat Aegislash. A Choice Scarf set can be used to catch faster, less bulky Pokemon off guard and KO them, such as Mega Lopunny and Greninja, at the price of losing out on a powerful Z-Move and status moves. A bulkier Terrakion spread with high HP and high Defense or Special Defense and Rock Tomb allows it to beat threats like Choice item Dragonite, Magnezone, and Timid Naganadel but loses out on many matchups that fast Terrakion beats such as Mega Gardevoir, Tapu Lele, and Victini.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water- and Ground-types: Most Water- and Ground-types, such as Mega Gyarados, Primarina, Greninja, Garchomp, Zygarde, and Landorus-T, can withstand Terrakion's STAB attacks and KO back or outright outspeed and KO it with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Most Steel-types happen to have a typing that either neutralizes Close Combat's super effectiveness or are just outright bulky enough to take it and KO Terrakion, such as Mega Metagross, Magearna, Mega Scizor, Jirachi, and Celesteela.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Nukes: Pokemon like non-Choice Scarf Dragonite, Kommo-o, Mewnium Z Mew, and Choice Specs Necrozma can all take a hit from Terrakion and OHKO it in return with either a Z-Move or a Choice item-boosted attack.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Pokemon: Z-Celebrate Meloetta, Mega Altaria, and Clefable all can set up on Terrakion while taking Continental Crush or Close Combat and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Pokemon: Most Pokemon with the ability Sturdy such as Sawk, Donphan, Golem, Magnezone, and Gigalith can take a hit from Terrakion and retaliate with a powerful move.</p> <p><strong>Faster Hyper Offense Pokemon: Fast Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Haxorus, Hoopa-U, Zeraora, Mega Lopunny, and offensive Deoxys-S can easily outspeed and OHKO Terrakion without time for retaliation.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stone Edge is able to turn into Continental Crush for high damage output, which allows Terrakion to beat mainly both Mega Charizard X and Y, Mega Gardevoir, offensive Genesect, Togekiss, and Victini. Taunt is used to block many setup or stall Pokemon, such as Kee Berry Mew, Stored Power Necrozma, Aron, and Riolu, from using their boosting moves right away. Close Combat is used to cover Normal-, Dark-, Rock-, and Steel-types that are neutral against or resist Stone Edge, such as Porygon2, Porygon-Z, Mega Tyranitar, and non-Choice Scarf Excadrill. Swords Dance allows Terrakion to beat Tapunium Z Tapu Fini. Alternatively, Rock Tomb has its niche in slowing down and beating Choice Scarf Dragonite, stall Deoxys-S, and Earthquake Crustle. Substitute can be used over Swords Dance or Taunt, though it's only a niche pick to beat Slaking or force Pokemon like Mega Blaziken into mind games.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack EVs allow Terrakion to OHKO Tapu Lele and bulky Choice Specs Genesect most of the time. 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature let Terrakion outspeed maximum base 100 Speed Pokemon and above such as Blacephalon, Mega Charizard X and Y, Mega Gardevoir, and Mew, as well as outspeeding and KOing Modest Naganadel. 4 EVs are added to Special Defense for a better matchup against Choice Scarf non-Flash Cannon Genesect, as it will get a Download boost in Attack instead of Special Attack. Rockium Z combined with Stone Edge gives Terrakion a high damage output to beat common metagame threats such as Mega Charizard X and Y, non-bulky Tapu Lele, and Genesect.</p> <p>A bulkier EV spread of 16 HP / 244 Atk / 48 SpD / 200 Spe still allows Terrakion to outspeed base 100s and Landorus while being able to take a hit from and OHKO Choice Scarf offensive Genesect, but bulky Genesect is the more common set.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The combination of Taunt and Swords Dance is useful for Counter Registeel; use Taunt turn one, and then set up with Swords Dance. However, against non-Counter Registeel, either Swords Dance or Taunt will work. Be aware that against Meloetta, Continental Crush is a roll to KO. Against stall Deoxys-S, use Rock Tomb until Terrakion outspeeds it and then Taunt until it faints to Struggle recoil.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bulkier Pokemon that are slower but can take hits and dish out more damage over time, such as bulky Dragonite, Mega Gyarados, Mega Metagross, and Meloetta, make a good fit for Terrakion, as it struggles to deal with hyper offense Pokemon such as Greninja, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, and Naganadel; Terrakion in return can cover slow stall-oriented Pokemon that most bulky offense Pokemon lose to, such as Tapunium Tapu Fini and non-Giga Drain Mega Venusaur. Steel-types such as Magearna, Magnezone, Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Magneton are able to beat the common Fairy-types that Terrakion loses to such as Magearna, Clefable, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Mawile. In return, Terrakion can cover the Fire-types that most of these Steel-types may lose to, such as Mega Charizard X and Y, Heatran, and Victini. Fairy- and Psychic-types such as Mega Mawile, Mega Altaria, Mega Gardevoir, Hoopa-U, and Mew can cover the Fighting-types like Mega Blaziken, Kommo-o, and Mega Lopunny that resist Continental Crush and, in most cases, can also take Terrakion's attacks or outspeed and KO it. In return, Terrakion can beat some of the Steel-types that Fairy- and Psychic-types lose to most of the time, such as Heatran, Genesect, and Registeel.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Landorus-T's great offensive presence, good bulk boosted further by Intimidate, and decent Speed allow it to take on common Pokemon in the 1v1 metagame such as Victini, Mega Charizard X, and Magearna. It's great typing also helps it beat metagame threats such as Zeraora and Magearna, while Intimidate's effective bulk boost helps in matchups versus attackers such as Mega Gyarados, Haxorus, and Mega Lopunny. It also has access to utility moves such as Bulk Up, Swords Dance, and Rock Tomb, making it harder to accurately check with metagame threats such as Mega Gyarados and Donphan. Landorus-T can effectively play both a bulky offensive role with Z-Moves and bulk investment and a hyper offensive role with a Choice Scarf and Speed investment, which plays into its great versatility. However, Landorus-T's 4x weakness to Ice-type moves shouldn't be overlooked, as faster threats such as Genesect and offensive Mega Metagross often carry an Ice-type move and simply OHKO Landorus-T with it. In addition to this, it is also weak to specially offensive Water-types such as Primarina and Tapu Fini, as they are too bulky for Landorus-T to handle, can KO it with super effective moves, and can take advantage of its vulnerable Special Defense. Moreover, Landorus-T lacks tools to deal with bulky special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Meloetta because of their overwhelming power. It also struggles to break physically defensive stall Pokemon like Mega Slowbro, Clefable, and Type: Null, and its Speed leaves Landorus-T susceptible to faster threats such as Jumpluff.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Landorus-T can run an Assault Vest set capable of beating all Porygon-Z, Naganadel, and Pokemon with Ice-type coverage like Choice Specs Hidden Power Ice Magnezone and Ice Beam Magearna. This set, however, is more of a niche lure set and struggles to beat Pokemon outside of what it is intended to lure, such as Groundium Z Garchomp, and Krookodile.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Landorus-T struggles to break walls such as Clefable, Type: Null, and Mega Slowbro because of their high defenses and ability to match Landorus-T's Swords Dance or Bulk Up with moves like Iron Defense.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Offense: Bulky Pokemon such as Dragonite, Necrozma, and Meloetta are able to take Landorus-T's moves without needing a type resistance and KO back with a powerful move.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves: Ice Beam, Ice Punch, and Blizzard are carried by Pokemon like Genesect, Pheromosa, Mega Metagross, and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, which outspeed and OHKO Landorus-T.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance helps overtake the debuffs from Intimidate users such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Mawile, Bulk Up users such as Krookodile and opposing Landorus-T, or naturally bulky Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Mega Tyranitar. Supersonic Skystrike is Landorus-T's primary STAB move, swiftly getting rid of Grass- and Fighting-types such as Mega Venusaur and Kommo-o. Earthquake is its secondary STAB move, beating Steel-type and Fire-type Pokemon such as Magearna, in tandem with Substitute, and Heatran. Rock Tomb helps in matchups where being faster helps, especially against stall Pokemon like most variants of Kee Berry Mew and stall Deoxys-S, as both carry Taunt and prevent Landorus-T from using Swords Dance. It also helps slow down Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and physical Dragonite. You can run Substitute over Rock Tomb to avoid status moves such as Toxic and Charm from Pokemon like Umbreon and Metal Burst from Mega Aggron, allowing Landorus-T to set up or take damage behind a Substitute.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>56 HP EVs and 236 Defense EVs allow Landorus-T to survive an unboosted Waterfall from Mega Gyarados. If you choose to run Bulk Up, the same EV spread will also allow Landorus-T to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Garchomp after a boost. 176 Speed EVs let Landorus-T outspeed Adamant variants of Mega Gyarados. 40 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature maximize Landorus-T's damage output with the remaining EVs so you can always OHKO bulky Mega Gyarados with Supersonic Skystrike after a Swords Dance.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against Pokemon such as Crustle and Choice Band Garchomp, which barely survive a Supersonic Skystrike, it is best to use Rock Tomb first before going for the Z-Move. This applies to physical Dragonite, as well, with Rock Tomb breaking Multiscale. Against Golem, use Supersonic Skystrike, as Landorus-T can take Golem's Counter followed by Sucker Punch, and then use Earthquake. Against Aggron, it is best to use Swords Dance followed by Rock Tomb. If it Mega Evolves, use Swords Dance again and Earthquake afterwards. Against Donphan, you need Bulk Up to guarantee the win, as otherwise, it's a coinflip on using Rock Tomb into a predicted Counter and using Earthquake into a predicted Ice Shard, and for both plays you want to use Supersonic Skystrike the next turn. Against Mega Charizard X, it is best to Rock Tomb turn 1. If it Mega Evolves, use Earthquake; otherwise, use Rock Tomb a second time. Against Magearna, it is best to use set up Substitute first to negate a Fleur Cannon. If it goes for Iron Defense, use Swords Dance. When it reaches -2 Special Attack, use Earthquake. Be careful against bulkier threats such as Clefable and Zygarde, as Swords Dance Landorus-T struggles to beat them reliably. Avoid sending Landorus-T against Pokemon that carry Ice-type moves such as Genesect and Pheromosa. It's best not to send Landorus-T out versus physically bulky Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro, Primarina, and Ice Punch Mega Metagross due to them being too bulky for Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Flyinium Z Landorus-T is great at dealing with Grass- and Electric-types such as Mega Venusaur and Zeraora. Water-types such as Primarina and Tapu Fini that struggle with these Pokemon appreciate Landorus-T's ability to get rid of them. At the same time, Primarina and Tapu Fini all deal with Ground-types Landorus-T still struggles with, like Rhyperior and Zygarde. This Landorus-T set is also great at dealing with slower Bug- and Fighting-types such as Mega Heracross and Kommo-o, which Dark-types like Greninja and Hoopa-U have trouble dealing with. At the same time, Greninja and Hoopa-U deal with fast sleep users such as Jumpluff and Smeargle. Landorus-T easily loses to fast special attackers that carry Ice-type moves such as Pheromosa and Genesect. Pairing Landorus-T with Mega Venusaur and Magnezone, which are good at taking special hits, helps in dealing with these Pokemon. Landorus-T when running Substitute also helps in dealing with Steel-types such as Aegislash, which Mega Venusaur and Magnezone struggle with.</p> "

Rock Slide allows Landorus-T to consistently beat Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y.

The remaining 208 EVs in Attack maximize Landorus-T's offensive capabilities.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against both Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y, it's best to use Rock Slide to catch both of the two formes, OHKOing Mega Charizard Y and 2HKOing Mega Charizard X. Choice Scarf Landorus-T can lure in Pokemon that can normally beat Z-Move variants of Landorus-T, such as Greninja, Porygon-Z, and the aforementioned Mega Charizard Y, so keep that in mind at Team Preview.

Landorus-T, in return, helps with Fire-types such as Victini and Mega Charizard Y. Mega Venusaur is also an excellent partner for Landorus-T due to its ability to beat Water-types and Pokemon with Ice- and Water-type coverage such as Primarina and Genesect, and Landorus-T can help with Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Victini in return.</p> "

Swords Dance helps Landorus-T against bulkier threats such as Ferrothorn, Krookodile, and Chansey. Rock Tomb helps in matchups where being faster helps, especially against stall Pokemon like stall Deoxys-S, as it carries Taunt and prevents you from using Swords Dance. Rock Tomb also slows down Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Haxorus.

Substitute also blocks damage from Metal Burst and Counter from Pokemon such as Mega Aggron and Chansey. Bulk Up is an option over Swords Dance that gives Landorus-T a boost in both Attack and Defense, helping it against Pokemon such as Choice Band Donphan.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Landorus-T to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Porygon-Z and OHKO it with Tectonic Rage. The combination of 56 HP EVs and 52 Defense EVs allows Landorus-T to tank the combination of Fake Out and Ice Punch from Mega Lopunny as well as maximum Special Attack Heatran's Overheat.

This set, however, does not outspeed Normalium Z Porygon-Z and is more susceptible to faster niche threats that use sleep such as Smeargle and Vivillon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against Air Balloon users such as Heatran and Magnezone, using Rock Tomb to break Air Balloon and Tectonic Rage afterwards is the best play. Against Mega Charizard X, it is best to Rock Tomb turn one and then use your Z-Move if it Mega Evolves. Against Choice Band Donphan, you can either Earthquake if you predict Ice Shard or Bulk Up on a predicted Counter if you are running it. However, against Golem and Adamant Crustle, you'd want to immediately use Rock Tomb turn one, as it breaks Sturdy while avoiding potentially fatal Counter damage, and it helps in outspeeding Adamant variants of Crustle even at +1 after a Shell Smash. Finish it off with Tectonic Rage. Against Pokemon that usually carry Metal Burst and Counter, such as Mega Aggron and Chansey, or against Pokemon that aim to lower Landorus-T's Attack stat or inflict it with status like Charm, Leech Seed, or Toxic, such as Mega Venusaur, almost always go for Substitute turn one to easily avoid it, allowing Landorus-T to set up or attack safely. Avoid sending Landorus-T against Pokemon that carry Ice-type moves such as Pheromosa and Genesect, or specially offensive powerhouses like Mega Charizard Y and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, as Landorus-T cannot take care of these Pokemon. It's best not to send Landorus-T out versus physically bulky Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro, Primarina, and Mega Gyarados due to them being too bulky for Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Landorus-T struggles with bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Mega Gyarados because of their high innate bulk and Landorus-T's weakness to Water-type moves. Pairing it with an Electric-type such as Zeraora or Magnezone that can handle these Water-types is appreciated. At the same time, Landorus-T beats Ground-types Zeraora and Magneton struggle with, such as Golem and Groundium Z Garchomp. These Electric-types also deal with Mega Charizard Y, which Landorus-T struggles with, while Landorus-T handles Mega Charizard X. Landorus-T has trouble dealing with Psychic-types such as offensive Mega Metagross, Tapu Lele, Mega Gardevoir, and Meloetta because of their ability to either outspeed and OHKO Landorus-T or successfully tank its attacks with their bulk. Pairing Landorus-T with Heatran or Aegislash, which all handle these Pokemon well, helps. At the same time, Landorus-T deals with the Ground-types Heatran and Aegislash struggle with, as well as opposing Heatran and Aegislash. Physical walls such as Mega Slowbro, Type: Null, and Clefable are too bulky for Landorus-T to defeat, so stallbreakers such as Kartana and Belly Drum Mega Charizard X make good partners, as Landorus-T helps with their weakness to faster attackers such as Zeraora. Landorus-T easily loses to special attackers that carry Ice-type moves such as Greninja, Porygon-Z, and Pheromosa. Pairing Landorus-T with Mega Venusaur or Mega Gardevoir, which are good at taking special hits, helps in dealing with these Pokemon. Landorus-T also helps in dealing with Steel-types such as Aegislash and Heatran, which Mega Venusaur and Mega Gardevoir struggle with.</p> "

Roost is an obvious choice, because it is Kyurem's only form of recovery outside of Rest. Ice Beam is Kyurem's most reliable STAB move and allows it to OHKO many of the premier Ground-types in the metagame, like Zygarde-C, Landorus, Landorus-T, Kartana, and Mega Pinsir. When boosted by Icium, it can OHKO bulky Dragonite. Earth Power is taken over a Dragon-type STAB move for the reason that it gives Kyurem a way to effectively and safely damage threats like Mega Aggron, offensive Mega Mawile, Donphan, Magnezone, and Heatran.

The rest of the EVs are put into Defense with a Bold nature to weaken powerful super effective moves like Choice Scarf Garchomp's Outrage and KO them in return with Ice Beam. Icium Z allows Kyurem to use Subzero Slammer to OHKO threats like bulky Dragonite and slow Kommo-o. Alternatively, Groundium Z allows Kyurem to use Tectonic Rage, which can OHKO both formes of Diancie, and offensive Mega Metagross and Mega Mawile. Normalium Z gives Kyurem a Defense boost from Noble Roar and lets it take hits like Mega Mawile's Play Rough and Mega Heracross's Close Combat. Kyurem's ability Pressure allows it to efficiently PP stall the foe out of powerful moves such as Stone Edge and Hyper Beam. Groundium Z is the best item for Kyurem, because it allows it to check more threats than the other Z-Crystals do, such as Excadrill and both formes of Diancie.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Icium Z Kyurem cannot defeat Mega Mawile, so be careful when your opponent has a Mega Mawile, as Kyurem only acts as Mega Mawile bait when using Normalium Z or Groundium Z.

Excadrill and Haxorus provide great support for Kyurem, scaring off threats like Mega Gardevoir and Mega Charizard X and Y. Mega Charizard X and Y make good teammates for Groundium Z Kyurem, as it can OHKO threats like Mega Diancie. Icium Z Kyurem pairs well with Pokemon like Landorus-T that can beat Mega Diancie and Mega Mawile.

  "Meloetta": {
    "overview": "<p>Meloetta acts as an incredible balance breaker, being capable of breaking through a wide variety of the metagame's best offensively and defensively built threats. With its considerable bulk and power, Meloetta can take out several offensive threats like Mega Charizard X and Y, Greninja, Porygon-Z, Mega Gardevoir, and Garchomp without fear of being KOed. Meloetta's Normal and Psychic typing complement each other quite nicely, with its Normal half benefiting from the presented neutrality to Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Haxorus, Choice Band Kartana, Mega Lopunny, and special Pheromosa and the Psychic half gaining a complete immunity to Ghost-type attacks from the likes of Normalium Porygon-Z, Aegislash, Blacephalon, and Mega Gengar. Additionally, Meloetta uses its variety of setup moves between Z-Celebrate, Calm Mind, and Laser Focus to break through top-tier defensive threats like Magearna, Kee Berry Mew, Zygarde, Mega Altaria, and Mega Venusaur. Sadly, though, Meloetta is mostly limited to using its STAB moves, meaning it is very easily walled by Pokemon that resist them like Mega Metagross, Celesteela, Mega Sableye, Ferrothorn, and Registeel. In addition, Meloetta's relatively low Defense leads to issues against some of the more powerful physical attackers of the metagame like Choice Band Victini, Mega Mawile, Sawk, and Mega Medicham. Ultimately, due to the bulky offensive nature of 1v1, Meloetta often struggles to pick up KOs against many Pokemon like specially defensive Mega Charizard X, Mega Gyarados, Kyurem, and Mega Swampert that are competently built to withstand its attacks and take advantage of Meloetta's need to set up in order to even have a chance at dealing with them.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Meloetta can alternatively use a Choice Specs set that takes advantage of its immediate power and access to a wide variety of coverage moves like Shadow Ball, Focus Blast, Thunderbolt, and Hidden Power Fire that enable it to power through foes that its Normalium Z sets can't handle, like specially defensive Mega Charizard X, Mega Slowbro, Mega Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and Incineroar, at the expense of no longer being able to set up and having to move many bulk EVs to Special Attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Type Resistances: With Meloetta being so reliant on its STAB attacks, it is left susceptible to Pokemon that resist them like Mega Metagross, Celesteela, Mega Tyranitar, Mega Aggron, Ferrothorn, and Jirachi or just resist Normal-type moves and are able to deal with the damage from its Psychic-type attacks like Gigalith, Mega Lucario, Alolan Marowak, and Rhyperior. Mega Sableye in particular is immune to both of Meloetta's STAB attacks. Plasma Fists Zeraora negates Normal-type attacks and is able to withstand Meloetta's Psychic-type attacks long enough for it to KO first.</p> <p><strong>Overwhelming Offense: While Meloetta does its best to withstand what it can, there are still a plethora of Pokemon that either outright KO it or set up to do so, like Dragonite, Mega Mawile, Choice Band Victini, Grassium Z Kartana, Choice Band Archeops, Mega Medicham, and Tapu Bulu.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks: On top of Meloetta's frailty, it also suffers from its weaknesses to Bug- and Dark-types that Pokemon like Genesect, Volcarona, Crunch Mega Gyarados, Hoopa-U, and Incineroar take advantage of.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Foes: Mega Charizard X, Mega Blaziken, and Kyurem can invest into their special bulk in order to withstand Meloetta's attacks and ensure the win. Other Pokemon like Mega Slowbro, Z-Thunder Wave Togekiss, Registeel, Mega Scizor, Chansey, and Umbreon beat Meloetta by setting up to raise their Special Defense or lowering its Special Attack and eventually stalling it out.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Users: Pokemon with the ability Sturdy like Crustle, Sawk, Magneton, Carracosta, and Golem all threaten Meloetta by being able to withstand a single attack from it and proceed to KO it.</p> ",

        "name": "come on! (Z-Celebrate)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Celebrate is used alongside Normalium Z to boost all of Meloetta's stats, which aids it in reliably handling threats like offensive Mega Charizard X, Porygon-Z, Tapu Fini, Kommo-o, and Serperior. Hyper Beam is Meloetta's main damage-dealing move and can either be used alongside Normalium Z to become Breakneck Blitz, in order to OHKO Pokemon like Greninja, Haxorus, Kartana, and Mega Blaziken, or after Z-Celebrate to hit even harder than Breakneck Blitz! Using it as Breakneck Blitz also mitigates the need to recharge on the following turn, which is useful for 2HKOing offensive Magnezone. Laser Focus is an important stallbreaking tool that Meloetta uses to deal with Special Defense boosters like Mega Gardevoir, Kee Berry Mew, Clefable, and Deoxys-S. Psychic is Meloetta's secondary STAB move that is helpful for hitting Ghost- and Rock-types like Aegislash, Z-Conversion Porygon-Z, and Mega Diancie that resist or are immune to Hyper Beam in addition to breaking potential Substitutes from Pokemon like Zygarde, Landorus-T, Garchomp, Primarina, and Serperior without being forced to recharge. Psyshock is an alternative Psychic-type STAB move that performs the same role but deals physical damage in the interest of aiding matchups against Nihilego and Mirror Coat Avalugg at the expense of being unable to break Zygarde's Substitute.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP and 132 Defense EVs allow Meloetta to withstand the combination of Fake Out and Giga Impact from Jolly Mega Lopunny. 100 Speed EVs ensure that Meloetta outpaces Timid Magnezone and Serperior after using Z-Celebrate. 16 Special Defense EVs allow Meloetta to withstand a Blast Burn from Timid Mega Charizard Y. Lastly, 12 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature ensure that Meloetta KOes offensive Magnezone with the combination of Breakneck Blitz and Hyper Beam. Normalium Z grants Meloetta the ability to use any of Z-Celebrate, Breakneck Blitz, and Z-Laser Focus.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>You want to think your moves through carefully when using Meloetta. You will be using Normalium Z in just about every matchup, with several variances in how you go about using it. Laser Focus should usually be used in combination with Z-Celebrate, in order to reliably beat bulky threats like Mega Gardevoir, opposing Meloetta, Kee Berry Mew, Clefable, and Stored Power Necrozma. The only exception is Deoxys-S, who you should use Z-Laser Focus to bypass any potential Special Defense boosts followed by Hyper Beam, as Deoxys-S is fast enough to outspeed +1 Meloetta and would prevent it from using normal Laser Focus with Taunt. The Psychic-type moves are typically only to be used for the sake of breaking Substitutes from Pokemon like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Serperior. Against Landorus-T and Garchomp, in particular, you need to be wary of the possibility that they use Rock Tomb to make Meloetta slower once again after it uses Z-Celebrate, as this means they can just use Substitute again to block its Hyper Beam, while a +1 Psychic-type move isn't guaranteed to KO them at 75%. Against Porygon-Z, it's best to start with Z-Celebrate, as this will ensure Meloetta survives any combination of attacks from Choice Scarf variants in addition to allowing it to outspeed Normalium Z sets in the event that they attempt to KO Meloetta with Breakneck Blitz instead of using Z-Conversion. If Porygon-Z transforms into a Ghost-type, it should be easy to take it down with Meloetta's Psychic-type moves, though it may be necessary to use Laser Focus if Meloetta is equipped with Psyshock in place of Psychic, as many Normalium Z Porygon-Z sets are built with a lot of Defense EVs. If Porygon-Z transforms into any other type, a Laser Focus followed by a Hyper Beam should be sufficient to blast it away, while it fails to KO Meloetta with anything other than Dark Pulse.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Meloetta appreciates backup from the various Ground-types like Zygarde, Landorus-T, Donphan, Garchomp, and Krookodile that cover the Steel- and Rock-types that resist its STAB attacks. In turn, Meloetta handles the Water-types that threaten these Pokemon like non-Crunch Mega Gyarados, Choice Specs Greninja, Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Manaphy. Physically bulky Pokemon like Mega Metagross, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Aggron all serve to handle the powerful physical attackers like Dragonite, Mega Mawile, and Mega Medicham that would otherwise overwhelm Meloetta, while it returns the favor by covering special attackers like Mega Charizard Y, Choice Specs Greninja, Porygon-Z, Aegislash, and Kommo-o. Particular Pokemon like Kommo-o, Primarina, Mega Altaria, Mega Blaziken, and Pheromosa act quite nicely as partners for Meloetta on account of their resistances to the Bug- and Dark-type attacks that threaten it. Meanwhile, Meloetta covers particular threats to them like Tapu Lele, Mega Gardevoir, Tapu Fini, and opposing Mega Altaria.</p> "

        "name": "Calm Mind + Laser Focus",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind aids Meloetta in beating Type: Null and Manaphy. Laser Focus is used alongside Calm Mind to bypass Special Defense boosts in order to take on Magearna and Stored Power Necrozma. Uproar is Meloetta's base move for Breakneck Blitz, which can OHKO offensive Mega Charizard X, Greninja, Porygon-Z, Landorus-T, Haxorus, Kartana, and Naganadel, in addition to being a useful regular move for going through Torrent Greninja's, Jumpluff's, Serperior's, and Whimsicott's Substitute. Psyshock is Meloetta's secondary STAB attack and allows it to deal damage to Ghost-types like Aegislash and Mega Gengar in addition to aiding matchups against Nihilego and Mirror Coat Avalugg by dealing physical damage. Hyper Beam can be used in place of Uproar or Meloetta's Psychic-type STAB move for the extra damage against certain threats like Mega Slowbro, Magnezone, Registeel, and stall Deoxys-S, but this sacrifices either the ability to bypass Substitutes or the ability to deal with Ghost- and Rock-types.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP and 16 Special Defense EVs allow Meloetta to withstand a Blast Burn from Timid Mega Charizard Y. 56 Speed EVs ensure that Meloetta outpaces neutral-natured Magearna. 40 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature ensure that Meloetta gets the OHKO with Breakneck Blitz from Uproar against offensive Mega Charizard X, Landorus-T, and Mega Lopunny. 148 Defense EVs allow Meloetta to withstand the combination of Fake Out and Giga Impact from Jolly Mega Lopunny, as well as giving it the best odds it can get for withstanding the combination of Tectonic Rage + Ice Shard from Donphan. Normalium Z grants Meloetta the ability to use either Breakneck Blitz or Z-Laser Focus.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>You want to be very selective with how you go about using Meloetta, as different matchups have different ways that they are ideally played out. Calm Mind alongside Laser Focus is necessary for breaking through bulkier threats like Magearna, Tapu Lele, opposing Meloetta, Aegislash, Primarina, Heatran, Mega Venusaur, Necrozma, Porygon2, and Type: Null. Mega Charizard Y only requires a single use of Calm Mind before Meloetta can OHKO it with Breakneck Blitz; setting up any further only gives them more opportunities to land Air Slash flinches. Against Magearna, in particular, Meloetta only needs to set up to +3 before using Laser Focus followed by Breakneck Blitz. Setting up further only gives Magearna more chances to land critical hits or outright KO Meloetta.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Meloetta appreciates assistance from physical attackers and stallbreakers like Taunt Mega Gyarados, Choice Band Garchomp, Mega Mawile, Taunt Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Blaziken that threaten the specially defensive Pokemon Meloetta fails to pressure offensively. In turn, Meloetta covers the bulky offense threats like Zygarde, Primarina, Mega Altaria, and Krookodile. Meloetta welcomes Pokemon like Z-Move Dragonite, Zygarde, Kommo-o, Mega Altaria, and Donphan that either completely wall or break down the Sturdy users that overpower it. Meloetta returns the favor by handling threats like Magearna, Greninja, Tapu Lele, Clefable, and Necrozma. Prominent Dark-types like Mega Tyranitar, Incineroar, Krookodile, and Scrafty cover Meloetta's problem with Pokemon that are immune to its STAB attacks, in addition to handling various other threats. Meanwhile, Meloetta covers their backs by handling Fairy-type threats like Magearna, Tapu Lele, Mega Gardevoir, Primarina, and Mega Altaria.</p> "

This, along with its STAB moves, allows it to take care of many Water- and Psychic-types like Mega Gyarados, Meloetta, and Mega Slowbro. Also, Genesect's typing allows it to resist Fairy-type moves from Pokemon like Mega Diancie. Its ability Download can make Genesect gain an additional Special Attack boost if the foe has lower Special Defense than Defense and is useful to get KOs it could not get otherwise against Pokemon such as Tapu Fini. Because of Genesect's movepool, it is tricky for the opponent to predict what coverage Genesect is running. However, Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Heatran give Genesect trouble. Genesect is easily KOed by neutral or super effective Z-Moves from Pokemon like Zeraora and Aegislash, as Genesect is often too frail to win matchups where it is outsped or it is not strong enough to KO the opponent. Steel-types such as Aegislash and Magearna give Genesect competition due to having more bulk and Special Attack without relying on Download for the right boost.</p> ",

However, this means dropping a coverage move and the power it gets from Choice Specs or the Speed it gets from Choice Scarf.

  "Greninja": {
    "overview": "<p>Greninja is a threatening Pokemon in the 1v1 metagame, with a good Special Attack and an amazing Speed tier that make it very threatening, being able to OHKO many threats like Mega Swampert, Zygarde-C, and Dragonite. Backing up that statline is access to Protean with a great movepool, giving it more offensive pressure with a STAB boost on all of its moves and a way to evade powerful attacks by changing to a type that resists them or is immune to them. A Substitute + Torrent set can also be used to beat threats to the Choice Specs set like specially defensive Mega Charizard X and Y, Mega Metagross, and Type: Null. By using the increased utility from forgoing coverage moves for options like Substitute, Work Up, and Taunt, Greninja can pump out a huge boosted Hydro Cannon while still using status moves to lock down foes. However, it is horribly frail, so any super effective moves against it will likely OHKO it, and it also falls to some strong neutral STAB attacks such as Adamant Haxorus's Outrage, Mega Lopunny's Giga Impact, and Mega Gyarados's Outrage. Greninja can also be defeated by faster Pokemon that can take advantage of its low defenses like Zeraora and bulkier ones that aren't afraid to take its hits like Kyurem</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Greninja is extremely versatile with its mixed attacking stats and Protean, so it has many options to use in combating what would have been losses before. A Waterium Z Greninja with Shadow Sneak can be used in order to reliably beat Porygon-Z, reacting to Porygon-Z's chosen coverage option. Greninja's extensive physical movepool can be used to make a Choice Band set, with Giga Impact for high Base Power, Gunk Shot to deal with Fairy-types like Mega Gardevoir, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Bulu, and Low Kick for special walls or heavy targets like Chansey and Kyurem. Greninja also has fantastic physical coverage in Ice Punch, Waterfall, Night Slash, and Rock Slide to fit the team. However, Greninja is no longer able to deal with some threats with a Choice Band set, as Ice Punch no longer OHKOes Dragonite in Ice Beam's place. A Modest Choice Scarf set can be used with one of these coverage moves to bait faster Pokemon, such as using Hidden Power Ground on a Zeraora to take an Electric-type attack, outspeeding Choice Scarf Haxorus and OHKOing it with Ice Beam, or outstripping Mega Blaziken's Speed tier even after Protect and washing it away with Hydro Cannon. This is generally a subpar option because Greninja loses its immense power from a Choice Specs or Choice Band. A Life Orb can be used to have Protean take a more defensive role, as Greninja changing its typing can help afterwards when taking down the opposing Pokemon. A Z-Crystal can also be used to give Greninja the same power, if not more, of Choice Specs on one move and the freedom it gets from Life Orb. Notable options of this are Darkinium Z to OHKO Mega Metagross and Icium Z to have the most consistent matchup against specially defensive Dragonite. However, both of these options have subpar power in comparison to Choice Specs, as OHKOing targets such as Dragonite and Mega Gyarados at the same time becomes much harder when Greninja doesn't have a flat boost to all of its attacks as high as from Choice Specs or Choice Band.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Greninja is liable to being OHKOed by strong STAB moves or super effective moves from faster Pokemon such as Zeraora, Mega Lopunny, and Choice Scarf Haxorus unless it has a Choice Scarf itself.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy: Since Sturdy Pokemon can always absorb a hit from Greninja, they’re really effective at OHKOing it. Donphan is a good example, as it survives everything and OHKOes Greninja with neutral Tectonic Rage. However, Greninja can survive or avoid this attack and strike back with priority to win, depending on the set.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon: Bulkier Pokemon can take Greninja's attacks and OHKO it in return. However, Greninja's insane amount of versatility can usually help it get by these walls depending on the set. Bulky PP stall Kyurem can survive anything from Choice Specs easily and 2HKO Greninja with Ice Beam or Earth Power depending on what it's locked into. Mega Venusaur 2HKOes Greninja with Sludge Bomb and only fears Extrasensory, while Chansey is extremely consistent and only fears Choice Band sets.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Cannon is Greninja's attack with the highest Base Power, and it can score an OHKO on threats such as Heatran and Mega Diancie with relative ease. Grass Knot is chosen in the second slot to hit the Water-types that resist Hydro Cannon for super effective damage, and it's Greninja's best option for dealing with Mega Slowbro, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Swampert. Ice Beam is fantastic coverage, as it obliterates Pokemon that are weak to it such as Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Naganadel. Dark Pulse gives Greninja good coverage, beating Ghostium Z Aegislash and offensive Mew, and it is also a great option in dealing with Mirror Coat users like Avalugg, as Greninja keeping the Dark typing prevents the move from working. Hidden Power Fire is Greninja’s best option against Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Magearna. Ferrothorn and Scizor are both easily OHKOed, while Magearna is 2HKOed. Another benefit of using Hidden Power Fire is that Magearna often will see Greninja as an easy KO, and luring it is very important. Hidden Power Ground can be used to gain an immunity to Electrium Z Magnezone. Blizzard gives Greninja another Ice-type coverage option that hits a bit harder, giving Greninja more consistent KOs on the bulky sets of Dragonite, Kommo-o, and Mega Altaria; however, its 70% accuracy can cause losses. Extrasensory is Greninja’s best option to deal with Mega Venusaur. Hidden Power Electric can be used against Mega Gyarados to confound it, OHKOing normal Gyarados while Grass Knot OHKOes Mega Gyarados. Hidden Power Steel can be run in order to consistently beat Tapu Lele, but this requires heavy Special Defense investment. Gunk Shot can be run in order to gain better matchups against Fairy-types like Mega Gardevoir and offensive Tapu Lele, without drastically shifting EV investment, unlike Hidden Power Steel. Shadow Sneak be used in order to play mind games with Choice-locked Porygon-Z using Hyper Beam.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs are used to let Greninja hit as hard and fast as possible. A Timid nature is chosen so that Greninja can outspeed targets such as Mega Diancie, Blacephalon, Naganadel, and Mega Latios. Choice Specs is used because it gives Greninja as much power as possible to OHKO its targets. Protean gives Greninja STAB on every move, giving it the power it needs to OHKO its targets.</p> <p>A spread of 4 HP / 48 SpA / 204 SpD / 252 Spe with a Timid nature is ideal for using Hidden Power Steel, in order to tank a Shattered Psyche from Tapu Lele. If Greninja is running Gunk Shot, use a Naive nature instead of Timid.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Sometimes moves that will allow Greninja to attack again are the better option if Greninja can’t OHKO the opposing Pokemon, such as changing Greninja's type with Hidden Power Fire to resist Magearna's Twinkle Tackle. Some options to cheese a victory in unfavorable matchups can come from Greninja’s moves’ secondary effects. Dark Pulse's 20% flinch rate can be used to cheese a win from a Donphan or Magnezone, but it's not reliable for swinging the matchup. Ice Beam's freeze chance of 10% is less reliable than Dark Pulse's flinch rate, so that move should never be used for its secondary effect unless the Pokemon resists Dark Pulse but not Ice Beam. Despite being a Fire-type Pokemon, both Mega Charizard X and Y can beat Greninja if given proper EV investment, so you will need to predict if your opponent is running bulky sets or not.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Magnezone is a fantastic partner for Greninja, as it helps it deal with unfavorable matchups in Meloetta, Primarina, Mega Charizard Y, and Magearna. It also has a good matchup against Sturdy Pokemon such as Avalugg and Crustle. Greninja also beats many threats to Magnezone in Dragonite, Kommo-o, Zygarde, and Mega Charizard X. Zygarde has a fantastic matchup against almost every Sturdy Pokemon in the tier, which Greninja mostly universally loses to. It also helps Greninja in matchups against faster Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Zeraora. Greninja can also help Zygarde by making quick work of Dragonite, other Zygarde, and Mega Charizard X. Dragonite is another good Pokemon to partner with Greninja, as it has fantastic matchups against Mega Venusaur, Meloetta, Mega Charizard Y, and Magnezone. Greninja also helps Dragonite in shaky matchups against Mega Charizard X and Aegislash. Heatran is a great option because it more reliably beats Charizard and Magearna, letting Greninja use Dark Pulse or a different Hidden Power. Heatran also appreciates Greninja's targeting of Zygarde and Dragonite. Other Electric-types like Raikou and Zapdos can also be used as team options because they are much more reliable at dealing with Gyarados than Magnezone while also beating Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Mega Charizard Y.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + Torrent",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute is required for this set to function, allowing Greninja to safely defeat both Mega Charizard X and Y by using Substitute until Torrent and Petaya Berry are activated. Hydro Cannon is also a must-have, sporting a huge 150-Base Power on top of STAB, a Torrent boost, and Petaya Berry or Waterium Z to do incredible amounts of damage. Taunt allows Greninja to shut down stall Pokemon and Substitute users that would wall it, such as Mega Audino and Jumpluff . Work Up helps Greninja defeat Pokemon like Type: Null and non-Hyper Voice Mega Gardevoir that would attempt to boost their defenses to beat it. Alternatively, Water Shuriken can be used to beat Sturdy users like Golem as well as potentially Donphan and Crustle. This move is especially good when paired with a Petaya Berry, allowing Greninja to KO most Sturdy users in three hits instead of four. Haze can also be used as an alternative to Work Up, removing the foe's stat boosts, as well as guaranteeing a win against Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X. Ice Beam can also be used to beat Infestation Jumpluff and non-Choice Scarf Garchomp, but it loses so many other matchups that it's not worth using most of the time. Waterfall can also be used in conjunction with Work Up, as it guarantees a win against other Pokemon that would try to boost their Special Defense like Magearna and allows Greninja to run a mixed offensive set using Waterium Z.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>76 HP EVs and 108 Defense EVs prevent a Mega Charizard X's Flame Charge from breaking Greninja's Substitute. Additionally, the 76 HP EVs mean that Petaya Berry activates after 3 Substitutes, protecting Greninja from many priority moves that it resists. In addition to this, Greninja can now take 3 Seismic Tosses from Registeel, guaranteeing a win in this matchup. 176 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Greninja to outspeed maximum Speed Mega Lucario. Although the Mega Lucario matchup isn't a guaranteed win for Greninja, you lose nothing by investing the necessary EVs to outspeed it. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack to hit as hard as possible. Petaya Berry and Torrent in conjunction with Substitute allow Greninja to repeatedly use Substitute until the Berry and ability activate, allowing it to unleash a massively boosted Hydro Cannon. Waterium Z is an alternative that provides more consistency and power right out of the gate at the cost of total power; despite the increased accuracy, certain matchups such as Mega Swampert, Magearna, and Mega Gardevoir are made less consistent, making Petaya Berry generally the better option. It also improves certain matchups against Substitute users like Jumpluff, where you need to hit two turns in a row to win.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Greninja should be sent out against slower Pokemon without a resistance to Water and stall Pokemon that are weak to Taunt. Avoid using Greninja against Pokemon that can bypass its Substitute like Meloetta. Unless the foe is exclusively a status user like Jumpluff or Type: Null, on turn 1, use Substitute. If the opponent elects to use a Speed-boosting move like Flame Charge or Dragon Dance, keep using Substitute until Greninja hits 25% health, after which you should use Hydro Cannon. If a foe such as Magearna or Mega Gardevoir tries to boost their Special Defense, use Work Up until both Pokemon are at +6, and then use Substitute until at 25% health, or use Haze to nullify their setup. Without Haze, certain matchups like Magearna are a toss-up, as if their Special Defense boosts reach +6, the benefit from Petaya Berry is lost. If you're using Haze, make sure to not Haze away your Petaya Berry boost. Only use Water Shuriken against Sturdy users. Unless the foe uses multi-hit moves and will faint to an unboosted Water Shuriken, like Golem, use Substitute to reach 25% health to get the Torrent and Petaya Berry boosts and then use it to hopefully KO the foe. If an opposing Pokemon uses a move like Shell Smash to boost their Speed, keep using Substitute, as they cannot eliminate Greninja if it is behind a Substitute. Between Petaya Berry and Waterium Z, they play largely similarly except against status users and Pokemon that can survive a hit from a Petaya Berry-boosted Hydro Cannon. Waterium Z allows you to use Hydro Vortex followed by Hydro Cannon the next turn, beating some Substitute users. In addition to this, with Petaya Berry, you cannot let the foe reach +6, as the advantage gained from Petaya Berry is lost. However, you can safely get to +6 with Waterium Z, as you still keep the damage boost.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can deal with common threats to this set like Dragonite, Mega Gyarados, Mega Lopunny, and Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, Porygon-Z, and Sawk are very good partners. Examples include Magearna, Mega Metagross, and Tapu Lele, all of which have their weaknesses to Mega Charizard X and Y, Magearna, and Jumpluff covered by Greninja. Pokemon such as Zeraora and Magnezone that can deal with the bulky Water-types that typically beat Greninja like Tapu Fini and Primarina are great teammates as well and appreciate having their matchups against Mega Charizard X and Y and non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T covered.</p> "

Its Ground typing also allows it to stonewall most Zeraora, which traditionally serves as a counter to Normal-types. However, Diggersby's overall middling base stats betray it, leaving it unable to run setup or leave its Speed stat uninvested. Diggersby is therefore forced to choose between running a Choice Scarf to shore up its below average Speed, leaving it vulnerable to naturally bulky Pokemon, like Primarina, Kommo-o, and Tapu Fini, and going all in on Attack with a Choice Band, forfeiting any potential to outspeed and OHKO Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Greninja. It also faces competition from Slaking as a hyper offensive Normal-type; with its natural bulk and Speed, Slaking hits much harder with its Choice Band-boosted Giga Impact when compared to Choice Scarf Diggersby and is much more capable of tanking hits than Choice Band Diggersby.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Diggersby has no viable other options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Sturdy Users</strong>: Diggersby will struggle against most Pokemon it cannot OHKO, and thus most Sturdy users have ways to work around Diggersby, be it hyper offense of their own, setup, Counter, Metal Burst, or priority, or a combination of these. Do not send Diggersby against Donphan, Golem, Aggron, Carracosta, Sawk, and Avalugg. Endure Porygon-Z should also not be considered a reliable win, for similar reasoning.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Pokemon that can naturally outspeed Diggersby even after Choice Scarf will make quick work of it, and thus Diggersby should not go up against Mega Lopunny, Choice Band Zeraora, Pheromosa, Haxorus, Mega Blaziken, and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z and Tapu Lele. Running a Jolly nature can clean up a few of these, but not all.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Bulky Pokemon: Pokemon that can tank an attack from Diggersby will usually win. Do not use Diggersby against Mega Gyarados, Zygarde-C, Dragonite, Mega Slowbro, Mega Venusaur, Mega Sableye, and Kee Berry Mew.

Fire Punch can break down Steel-types that are hit neutrally by Earthquake, like Genesect, Kartana, Durant, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Gunk Shot can also be run in order to give Diggersby much better odds against Serperior and Tapu Fini. Ice Punch serves as a more reliable answer for Pokemon like Garchomp.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EVs are designed to maximize Attack and Speed, giving Diggersby the highest odds at beating Pokemon like bulky Mega Charizard X and Garchomp. Huge Power is run for this purpose as well, making Diggersby viable. The remaining 4 EVs are put into Special Defense in order to not lose to Download users like Choice Scarf Genesect. A Choice Scarf is run in order to outspeed Greninja, Naganadel, and Jumpluff. An Adamant nature should be run in order to consistently beat threats like Tapu Lele, Magearna, and Ferrothorn. However, Jolly is an option to catch speedier Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Mega Gengar, and Modest Choice Scarf Porygon-Z off guard.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The matchup against bulky Mega Charizard X is a coinflip, depending on whether or not you predict it to Mega Evolve or not. If you predict it to stay in its regular forme, use Giga Impact, and if you expect it to Mega Evolve to tank Giga Impact, use Earthquake. If one of Diggersby's more accurate coverage moves can also OHKO the opposing Pokemon, use it over Giga Impact, as this will circumvent any chance of losing due to a miss. Against Pokemon that threaten to beat Diggersby, use Ice Punch if that hits neutrally or super effectively, in order to fish for freezes. This is less than ideal, but it is the only way to win against Pokemon like Crustle, Meloetta, Aron, Kommo-o, and Mega Altaria. Despite it having access to Ice Punch, do not use Diggersby against Landorus-T and Zygarde-C, as Landorus-T will either tank an Ice Punch or outspeed it with its own Choice Scarf and OHKO back, and Zygarde will be able to KO Diggersby with Tectonic Rage followed by Extreme Speed or after using Coil. For the same reason, Mega Mawile and Incineroar should be avoided, as they can easily take an Earthquake after Intimidate and OHKO back with Metal Burst or Play Rough or Fake Out followed by Malicious Moonsault. Some other bulkier Pokemon will be able to shrug off damage dealt by Giga Impact or super effective damage, like Primarina, Celesteela, and Mega Aggron, and retaliate with their respective offensive options.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon like Serperior, Tapu Bulu, Magnezone, and Zeraora are especially helpful partners of Diggersby, as they can deal with Diggersby's ineptitude against several common bulky Water-types, like Mega Gyarados, Primarina, and Mega Slowbro. In return, Diggersby deals with dangerous Fire-types like Mega Charizard X and Y, Victini, and Volcarona and dangerous Ground- and Steel-types like Garchomp and non-Counter Registeel. Diggersby will appreciate bulky Taunt users like Kommo-o, stall Deoxys-S, and Tapu Fini, which can break past stall or setup Pokemon that can take a few of Diggersby's hits, like Umbreon, Necrozma, Zygarde-C, Landorus-T, and Meloetta.

Vivillon also has access to a strong STAB move in Hurricane, which with Quiver Dance and Sleep Powder allows it to defeat Pokemon slower than it, such as Aegislash and Mega Altaria. However, it faces a lot of competition from other sleep Pokemon such as Jumpluff and Mega Gengar, all of which are faster and can cover most of the 1v1 metagame. Despite this, Vivillon can be considered to be better due to a more accurate Sleep Powder making it more reliable. Vivillon struggles against Rock-types like Golem and Crustle that carry multi-hit moves such as Rock Blast, leaving it unable to do its job effectively.

The remaining EVs are invested in Special Attack to make Vivillon's Hurricane hit as hard as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Sleep Powder is generally going to be the best turn one play, as it can put slow Pokemon to sleep that aren't Grass-types to sleep. Against Grass-types and Pokemon that can shut down Vivillon if they wake up right away like Kommo-o, use Quiver Dance or Substitute if Hurricane can't immediately OHKO them. Use Hurricane if the opposing Pokemon has the ability to beat Vivillon like Mega Heracross, Whimsicott, and Tapu Bulu. Once the foe has been put to sleep, use Substitute in order to ensure that you don't lose if it wakes up immediately, and if the Substitute is still intact, start setting up with Quiver Dance if you can't 2HKO the opposing Pokemon with Hurricane and proceed to whittle the opposing Pokemon down, using Sleep Powder and Substitute depending on the situation. If you can survive a hit from the opposing Pokemon without using Quiver Dance and 2HKO it, use Hurricane.

The combination of Zygarde's great utility moves like Coil, Rest, and Substitute, alongside access to a priority move in Extreme Speed, lets it beat various styles of Pokemon, from Taunt-less stall like Jumpluff to hyper offense like Choice Scarf Haxorus. Power Construct also gives it free health after falling below 50% of its actual HP. However, because of Zygarde's 4x weakness to Ice-type attacks, you will have to look out for Pokemon that run Ice-type coverage like Greninja. Special attacking Pokemon or strong Dragon-types like bulky Hoopa-U, Tapu Lele, Kommo-o, and Dragonite can also be a problem for Zygarde. Pokemon with Taunt like Mega Sableye and Tapu Fini or unexpected moves that can catch it off guard like Belly Drum can be very deadly, as before turning into Zygarde-C, Zygarde is relatively vulnerable to special attacks and has mediocre physical bulk.

Its ability, Power Construct, lets Zygarde transform into its bulkier forme, Zygarde-C, doubling its base HP stat.</p> <p>Zygarde can use an alternative spread of 16 HP / 96 Atk / 252 Def / 144 Spe with an Impish nature. This would risk losing the very important Mega Charizard X matchup but also has some upsides. It outspeeds maximum Speed neutral-natured Mega Gyarados and is able to OHKO bulky Tapu Fini.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is ideal to set up Coil first against Pokemon like Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Donphan, and Primarina lacking Substitute. Substitute is preferred to be used as soon as possible if you are playing against a Pokemon that is typically slower than Zygarde and tends to use a Z-Move, as well as against Pokemon that use status moves or attacks like Mirror Coat, Counter, and Metal Burst such as Registeel without Iron Defense, Mega Audino, Magnet Rise Aegislash, and Ferrothorn. If you are using Rest against stall Pokemon to PP stall them, you want to use Rest as much as possible to get the maximum PP advantage. However, if you want to do that, you risk getting critically hit. Rest is preferred against Pokemon like Jumpluff, Mega Slowbro, Registeel, and Mega Gyarados lacking Taunt. When you use Coil and Rest in an attempt to stall the opposing Pokemon, you have to stay out of the foe's critical hit range. The most important matchup, against Mega Charizard X, can be won by using Coil first and using Thousand Arrows + Tectonic Rage if they didn't use Dragon Dance first turn and did not Mega Evolve. If it Mega Evolved on the first turn, you can OHKO it with Tectonic Rage. If they used Dragon Dance, use Coil twice, and use Thousand Arrows if they didn't Mega Evolve or finish them with Tectonic Rage if they did. After two Coils and Thousand Arrows, Extreme Speed is able to OHKO or 2HKO, depending on how bulky the opposing Charizard is.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Zygarde appreciates partners that beat Pokemon with Ice-type coverage. Consider strong Fire-types like Mega Charizard X and Y as teammates, because Zygarde covers their Rock-type weakness and wins against Pokemon like Crustle. In return, Charizard is covering Zygarde's 4x Ice-type weakness by beating Pokemon like Greninja and Genesect. To further support Zygarde, you need something to cover its Dragon- and Fairy-type weaknesses. A strong special attacking Fairy-, Steel-, or Poison-type would be the best choice, since Zygarde is attacking physically. Pokemon like Magearna and Mega Gardevoir are good choices because they are able to beat some big threats to Zygarde like Naganadel, Mega Aggron, and opposing Mega Gardevoir. In exchange, Zygarde covers their Poison- and Fire-type weaknesses, winning against Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Mega Charizard X and Y. Strong special attackers such as Porygon-Z and Mega Gardevoir can also be a problem for Zygarde, so a special wall like Type: Null can help cover that weakness. In return, Zygarde wins against most of the heavy-hitting attackers that are a problem for Type: Null like Taunt Heatran, Swords Dance Mega Mawile, Taunt Mega Tyranitar, Mega Blaziken, Crustle, and Victini. Taunt users like Tapu Fini and Mega Gyarados can counter Zygarde, so you might want to consider a Pokemon with the ability Oblivious like Slowbro or your own Taunt user like Tapu Fini. Zygarde helps Slowbro and Tapu Fini by covering their Electric-type weakness, winning against Pokemon like Bolt Strike Victini and Zeraora. Zygarde overall has very shaky matchups against bulky Water-type Pokemon like Primarina and Tapu Fini. Grass-type Pokemon like Kartana are a good addition that help cover this weakness. In return, Zygarde covers Kartana's Fire-type weakness and is capable of beating Pokemon like Mega Charizard X and Y and Heatran.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Mega Diancie is a good anti-metagame Pokemon in the 1v1 metagame with its unique Rock / Fairy typing that, in combination with its good Speed tier, allows it to reliably beat metagame staples such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Gyarados and serve as a good check to the ubiquitous Dragonite, only fearing Choice item variants. Furthermore, its pre-Mega ability Clear Body nullifies the effects of Intimidate from Pokemon like Mega Gyarados, while its post-Mega ability Magic Bounce protects it from status moves directed at it, ensuring wins against certain stall Pokemon like Whimsicott and fast sleep users like Jumpluff, Vivillon, and Smeargle. Diancie's excellent bulk prior to Mega Evolution allows it to delay Mega Evolution to beat Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Porygon-Z, and Mega Gyarados. Mega Diancie's EVs are stretched thin, however, so it is unable to consistently beat Mega Gyarados and simultaneously outspeed fast offensive Pokemon such as Garchomp, Kartana, and Durant. Furthermore, the prominence of Steel-types in the metagame hurts Mega Diancie, as its 4x weakness to Steel is easily exploited by threats such as Heatran, Mega Aggron, and Celesteela.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Skill Swap can be used with Earth Power to lure and defeat non-Air Balloon Magnezone. It can also be used to let Mega Diancie wall Zeraora with its own Volt Absorb ability, to remove Mega Gardevoir's Pixilate if running fast Mega Diancie, to steal Clefable's Unaware to use against it, and to steal Crustle's Sturdy when not running Rock Tomb.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-type Attackers and Steel-type Coverage: Steel-types like Heatran, Genesect, Magnezone, Mega Metagross, and Celesteela are able to tank any of Mega Diancie's moves, with the exception of Genesect being OHKOed by fast Mega Diancie's Hidden Power Fire, and OHKO Mega Diancie back with their STAB moves, exploiting its crippling 4x weakness to Steel. Additionally, Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Dragonite and Choice Scarf Haxorus can outspeed Mega Diancie and OHKO it with their Steel-type coverage moves such as Iron Head and Iron Tail.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Many Ground-types such as Landorus, Garchomp, Choice Scarf Diggersby, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T can outspeed bulky Mega Diancie and KO it with their powerful STAB moves. Mega Diancie's access to Magnet Rise can potentially neutralize some of these Pokemon, but some bulky Ground-types like Rockium Z Golem and Mega Swampert can take advantage of their other STAB options to still hit Mega Diancie hard, while Quagsire can make use of Z-Stockpile and Recover to set up before whittling away at Mega Diancie's health with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Due to being forced to run a Naive or Rash nature, Mega Diancie's special bulk is diminished. This can be taken advantage of by Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir, Tapu Lele, and Normalium Z Porygon-Z, although Mega Diancie has ways to mitigate this, like with Skill Swap against Mega Gardevoir and Rock Tomb against Porygon-Z.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Grass- and Water-types: Pokemon like Tapu Bulu, Greninja, and Primarina can OHKO Mega Diancie with their STAB moves, while Mega Diancie is either unable to significantly damage them in return or unable to outspeed them.</p> <p><strong>Walls: Pokemon with extremely high defensive stats such as Mega Slowbro, Clefable, Registeel, Kee Berry Mew, and Stored Power Necrozma can render Mega Diancie's attacks mostly ineffective, allowing these Pokemon to beat Mega Diancie before it can significantly damage them in return.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Moonblast is Mega Diancie's main STAB move and hits extremely hard due to Mega Diancie's high Special Attack stat. Diamond Storm is a secondary STAB attack that hits Fire-types like Volcarona and Mega Charizard X and Y while giving Mega Diancie a chance to beat some physical attackers such as Mega Gyarados due to the move's 50% chance to raise Defense by two stages. Magnet Rise is used to beat Ground-types like non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Donphan that Mega Diancie outspeeds. It also allows Mega Diancie to evade Earthquake from physical Dragonium Z variants of Dragonite. Hidden Power Fire hits foes 4x weak to it such as Kartana and non-Choice Scarf Genesect that would otherwise tank any of Mega Diancie's attacks and KO it in return. Rock Tomb allows Mega Diancie to consistently beat Porygon-Z as well as non-Choice item Dragonite. Calm Mind can be used to beat Type: Null, but it is rarely useful outside of this matchup and causes Mega Diancie to lose the important matchup against Kartana.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Speed-boosting nature ensures that Mega Diancie is able to outspeed Kartana. Maximum Special Attack investment allows Mega Diancie to hit as hard as possible with Moonblast. 4 Attack EVs grant some extra power on Mega Diancie's Diamond Storm. A Naive nature is used so that Mega Diancie doesn't lose power on Diamond Storm or Rock Tomb and has a better chance to beat Mega Gyarados if it gets Defense boosts from Diamond Storm. Magic Bounce after mega evolution allows Mega Diancie to beat Pokemon like Jumpluff and Whimsicott.</p> <p>If running Rock Tomb, use an alternative EV spread of 68 HP / 208 SpA / 232 Spe with a Naive nature to ensure that Diancie beats maximum Attack Dragonite by tanking Earthquake in its base forme in addition to Extreme Speed after Mega Evolving.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against Donphan, after using Magnet Rise, use Diamond Storm first to avoid losing to Endeavor sets. This will be unnecessary if they use Head Smash, however, as this will break Sturdy and allow Moonblast to be used immediately for the KO. Against Zygarde, if predicting Tectonic Rage to be used, Mega Diancie should use Magnet Rise to avoid being OHKOed, but if predicting Thousand Arrows, Mega Diancie should use Moonblast to 2HKO Zygarde; note that Moonblast sometimes OHKOes it as well, easing the pressure of the mind game. Against Porygon-Z, bulky Mega Gyarados, and non-Choice item Dragonite, Mega Diancie can win if running Rock Tomb. After using Rock Tomb turn one without Mega Evolving against Porygon-Z, either Mega Evolve and use Moonblast if Porygon-Z has used Breakneck Blitz, or use Moonblast without Mega Evolving turn two, and then use Moonblast again while Mega Evolving turn three if Porygon-Z has used Z-Conversion. Against non-Choice Band Dragonite, just use Rock Tomb, and Mega Evolve and use Moonblast to secure the KO, assuming you're running the alternative EV spread to ensure that Diancie can tank Dragonite's attacks. If you encounter Mega Gyarados, Diancie should immediately Mega Evolve and use Diamond Storm, as if the chance for a Defense boost activates, it will win with Moonblast. However, this coinflip situation makes the matchup extremely unreliable, unlike with bulky Mega Gyarados.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since fast Mega Diancie loses to many Water- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Tapu Fini, Primarina, and Tapu Bulu and has an inconsistent matchup against Mega Gyarados and Zygarde, Pokemon that can consistently beat these threats like Mega Venusaur work well with it. In exchange, Mega Diancie can beat non-Choice item Dragonite, Mega Charizard Y, Garchomp, and Meloetta for Mega Venusaur. Steel-types with good matchups against Water-types like Kartana and specially defensive tanks like Meloetta synergize well with Mega Diancie, as they can beat Mega Gardevoir, Tapu Lele, Tapu Fini, and Primarina, all of which Mega Diancie struggles with. Mega Diancie can, in return, beat Fire-types like both formes of Mega Charizard, Victini, and Mega Blaziken for Kartana and Dark-types like Scrafty, Incineroar, and Mega Sableye for Meloetta. Fast Mega Diancie's general weakness to speedier offensive Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Choice Specs Deoxys-S, and Zeraora means that stall Pokemon capable of taking hits from them, such as Type: Null and Kee Berry Mew, make for good partners. In exchange, Mega Diancie can beat fast sleep users like Jumpluff and Vivillon and certain stallbreakers like Incineroar and Kommo-o that these Pokemon struggle with.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Moonblast is Mega Diancie's strongest move and hits Mega Gyarados, Kommo-o, Dragonite, and Krookodile hard. Rock Tomb gives Mega Diancie a secondary STAB attack to hit Volcarona and Mega Charizard X and Y while providing an important method of speed control that lets it beat Mega Gyarados and non-Choice item Dragonite. Magnet Rise allows Mega Diancie to beat some slow Ground-types like Groundium Z Donphan, Groundium Z Golem, and Mega Camerupt. Diamond Storm allows Mega Diancie to consistently beat some specially bulky Pokemon like Meloetta and Togekiss. Calm Mind can be run over Diamond Storm to beat certain stall Pokemon such as Type: Null, non-Amnesia Kee Berry Mew, and Porygon2.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>224 HP EVs and 52 Defense EVs allow Mega Diancie to tank bulky Mega Gyarados's Waterfall in its Mega forme and maximum Attack Mega Gyarados's Waterfall in its base forme. 28 Speed EVs ensure that Mega Diancie outspeeds maximum Speed Adamant Mega Gyarados as well as base 70 Speed Pokemon after Mega Evolving. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack to maximize Mega Diancie's damage output, notably almost guaranteeing the KO on bulky Mega Gyarados when Mega Diancie is played correctly. A Rash nature is used so that the damage output of Rock Tomb is not reduced, as its low Base Power makes this necessary. Magic Bounce after Mega Evolving allows Mega Diancie to beat certain stall Pokemon, such as Jumpluff, Whimsicott, Smeargle, and Vivillon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If you predict that Mega Gyarados is running a bulky spread, then Mega Evolve immediately and use Rock Tomb turn one, as Mega Gyarados will then be unable to OHKO Mega Diancie with Waterfall. After this, simply use Moonblast turn two for the KO. Note that most Mega Gyarados run bulky spreads, so if you are unsure about what the foe's spread is, this is the safest option. However, if you predict that Mega Gyarados is running a more offensive spread, do not Mega Evolve, and use Rock Tomb turn one to get chip damage and to prevent Mega Gyarados from outspeeding you if it uses Dragon Dance; on turn two, Mega Evolve and use Moonblast for the KO. Against Mega Charizard X and Y, use Diamond Storm if you are running it or Rock Tomb and refrain from Mega Evolving turn one to ensure the win, as Mega Evolving will cause Mega Diancie to be outsped and subsequently OHKOed by Solar Beam from Mega Charizard Y. Landorus-T can potentially use Rock Tomb followed by repeated uses of Substitute to stall out Mega Diancie's Magnet Rise turns before outspeeding and KOing it with its Ground-type moves, so if you suspect this play to come out, it is better to remain non-Mega-Evolved the first turn so as to avoid the Speed drop from Rock Tomb with Clear Body. Against Donphan, use either Rock Tomb or Diamond Storm turn two to avoid losing to Endeavor sets, unless it has already broken its Sturdy with Head Smash. After this, use Moonblast after Mega Evolving repeatedly to ensure the win. Against Meloetta, first use Diamond Storm without Mega Evolving, then Mega Evolve and use Diamond Storm to secure the win. If not running Diamond Storm, refrain from sending Mega Diancie out against Meloetta, as it will have a losing matchup.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since bulky Mega Diancie has poor matchups against Steel-types like Magearna, Heatran, Genesect, Magnezone, Kartana, and Celesteela, Pokemon that reliably beat these threats, such as Mega Charizard X and Y, Mega Blaziken, Golem, and other Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-types, make for good partners. In exchange, Mega Diancie can beat Mega Gyarados, Kommo-o, and Donphan for these Pokemon. Since bulky Mega Diancie struggles against Water-types such as Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Manaphy, Electric- and Grass-types like Zeraora and Serperior make for good partners. Zeraora also has an excellent matchup against most of the aforementioned Steel-types that threaten Mega Diancie. In exchange, Mega Diancie can beat Flyinium Z Dragonite and Mega Charizard X and Y for Serperior and Donphan and Whimsicott for Zeraora. If not running Calm Mind, Mega Diancie struggles to break through stall Pokemon like stall Deoxys-S, Type: Null, and Kee Berry Mew. This makes stallbreakers like Incineroar and Kommo-o good partners. In exchange, Mega Diancie can beat Donphan, Golem, and special Dragonite for Incineroar, and non-Choice item Dragonite, Mega Charizard X, and Whimsicott for Kommo-o.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Hoopa-U is a premier Dark / Psychic Pokemon of 1v1, with only two weaknesses to Fairy and Bug and an immunity to Psychic, and is gifted with amazing offensive stats and coverage moves. Because of its high offensive stats, Hoopa-U can run physical, special, and mixed sets, leaving the opponent bewildered to what set it could be running and letting it break walls such as Celesteela, and defeat stall Pokemon like Mega Slowbro and Deoxys-S before they can even set up. Its signature move in Hyperspace Fury allows Hoopa-U to beat Jumpluff and Aegislash by ignoring Substitute and Protect, while access to Gunk Shot helps beat Fairy-type Pokemon that would otherwise beat it, like Primarina and Tapu Fini. Hoopa-U also has great base Special Defense, allowing it to survive Moonblast from Tapu Lele and potentially a Hyper Beam from Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. Its Dark typing also grants Hoopa-U an immunity to Prankster-boosted status moves, letting it easily beat Whimsicott. However, Hoopa-U's lackluster physical bulk leaves it easily KOed by Pokemon faster than it or bulky hard hitters like Mega Charizard X, Dragonite, and Landorus-T. Its ability, Magician, has little to no use in the 1v1 format. Hoopa-U's 4x weakness to Bug shouldn't be ignored either, allowing Bug-types like Genesect and Volcarona to simply OHKO it. Fairy also is one of the most common offensive types, and Pokemon such as Magearna and Mega Mawile, which are both immune to Gunk Shot, and Mega Gardevoir, which simply outspeeds Hoopa-U, all easily deal with it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hoopa-U can run a Choice Scarf set to outspeed Pokemon that would otherwise just OHKO it. Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir, Genesect, and Kartana are examples. However, this set sacrifices Hoopa-U's overall damage output, losing the Primarina and Mega Slowbro matchups. A Darkinium Z set with two Dark-type moves, one physical and one special, allows Hoopa-U to reliably beat both physically frail Pokemon such as Nihilego and Araquanid or specially frail foes such as Rhyperior. This set, however, sacrifices Gunk Shot and therefore loses to Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Tapu Bulu. A quite niche move to run is Skill Swap, which lets Hoopa-U tank a move from Multiscale Dragonite and OHKO in return with Ice Punch or steal Crustle or Magnezone's Sturdy to tank a hit and OHKO in return with a Z-Move. It's a set designed to catch people off guard, but it only truly works in specific matchups. Hoopa-U can run a bulky Psychium Z set with Reflect, Calm Mind, Dark Pulse, and Psychic to reliably beat Porygon-Z, Donphan, and Golem; however, it struggles to beat the Ground-types the Choice Specs set beats and the Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele and Tapu Bulu that the Choice Band set deals with.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Physical Attackers: Because of Hoopa-U's low Defense stat, Pokemon like Mega Charizard X and Dragonite, which all can take a hit from Hoopa-U, can 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Fast Nukes: Hoopa-U is not the fastest Pokemon around, so foes like Mega Charizard Y, Kartana, and Archeops just outspeed it and beat it with their strongest move.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Despite Hoopa-U's ability to beat common Fairy-types such as Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Tapu Bulu, it still fails to beat Magearna, Mega Mawile, and Mega Gardevoir because they're either immune to Gunk Shot or are faster and OHKO Hoopa-U.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy: Hoopa-U lacks the right utility to reliably beat all Pokemon with Sturdy. Donphan, Golem, and Crustle can simply use their Z-Moves to OHKO Hoopa-U.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Genesect and Volcarona, which Hoopa-U can't hit super effectively and all run a Bug-type move, simply OHKO Hoopa-U.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyperspace Fury is a very powerful Dark-type STAB attack that allows Hoopa-U to ignore Protect and Substitute; however, the move has a slight drawback, as it reduces Hoopa-U's Defense. Despite the Defense drop, Hyperspace Fury helps Hoopa-U beat SubSeed users like Jumpluff and deal massive damage to Psychic-type Pokemon like Mega Slowbro, Meloetta, and Deoxys-S. Gunk Shot lets Hoopa-U beat Fairy-type Pokemon like Primarina, Tapu Fini, and give the best chances at beating Tapu Lele. Zen Headbutt is Hoopa-U's secondary STAB attack and is used to hit Venusaur and Kommo-o super effectively. Fire Punch is used to beat foes that are 4x weak to it like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor; however, it cannot get rid of Kartana because it simply outspeeds and nukes Hoopa-U. Drain Punch is an option that helps beat Mega Tyranitar and Greninja. Trick shuts down Pokemon that carry Leftovers or Eviolite, like Pyukumuku and non-Return Type: Null, while also beating FEAR Pokemon like Aron. Ice Punch can also be used to beat non-Extreme Speed Zygarde.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given HP and Defense EVs let Hoopa-U take a Meteor Mash from non-Adamant Mega Metagross. Its high Special Defense stat already allows it to naturally tank special hits from Tapu Lele, Greninja, and Heatran, specifically allowing Hoopa-U to take a Hyper Beam from a Modest Choice Scarf Porygon-Z with the given HP investment. 164 Speed EVs allow Hoopa-U to outspeed uninvested base 100 Speed Pokemon, like Victini and Manaphy, and the remaining Attack EVs and Choice Band maximize Hoopa-U's damage output, allowing it to secure KOs on bulky Fairy-types such as Primarina and Tapu Fini.</p> <p>Alternatively, an EV spread of 252 HP / 24 Atk / 12 Def / 124 SpD / 96 Spe can be run in order to beat Magnezone, outspeeding it and surving an Electroweb into Gigavolt Havoc, as well as still tank a Meteor Mash from Mega Metagross, but will lose out on overall power and Speed, making Hoopa-U less reliable against bulkier variants of Mega Metagross and faster variants of Kommo-o. A simpler spread of maximum Speed and maximum Attack, with a Jolly nature, in order to outspeed common Pokemon, like Smeargle.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against Mega Swampert, which uses Yawn, use either Hyperspace Fury on its Yawn to attack through the Protect, or use Zen Headbutt as it uses Earthquake turn 1 because Earthquake can OHKO Hoopa-U after the Defense drop on Hyperspace Fury. Against Serperior, use Hyperspace Fury if it uses Substitute or Leech Seed to 2HKO it; however, use Gunk Shot on a Leaf Storm so you can OHKO it before it 2HKOes Hoopa-U. Furthermore, Serperior can simply fish for Gunk Shot misses by repeatedly using Substitute.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hoopa-U struggles with 1v1's metagame-defining Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Dragonite, Mega Gyarados, and Magearna because of their ability to tank neutral hits and set up to OHKO Hoopa-U. Pokemon like Garchomp, Heatran, Clefable, and Mega Altaria, which can handle a good number of them, partner well with Hoopa-U. At the same time, Hoopa-U handles stall users such as Mega Slowbro, Deoxys-S, and Mew that the previous Pokemon struggle with. Hoopa-U lacks the ability to defeat Pokemon with the ability Sturdy such as Donphan, Golem, and Crustle. Pairing it with Mega Gyarados or Primarina helps deal with these Pokemon thanks to their adequate defenses, while Hoopa-U deals with Tapu Bulu, Tapu Fini, and Tapu Lele, which give them trouble. Despite being able to beat certain Fairy-types, Hoopa-U still can't cover all of them; Mega Mawile and Magearna are immune to Gunk Shot, while Mega Gardevoir is simply faster and OHKOes with a Pixilate-boosted Hyper Beam. Hoopa-U is also 4x weak to Bug. Pair it with Fire-type Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, or Heatran, as they cover both Bug-types and the Fairy-types Hoopa-U fails to beat. In return, Hoopa-U is able to take out Water-type Pokemon like Primarina and Mega Slowbro, which they typically struggle with.</p> "

Thunderbolt allows Hoopa-U to notably beat Mega Gyarados and Celesteela more reliably than Dark Pulse. Alternatively, Hoopa-U can run Grass Knot, as it still beats Mega Gyarados but also covers Mega Swampert; however, this makes the Celesteela matchup more difficult. Psychic is Hoopa-U's secondary STAB move and is used to hit Mega Venusaur and Mega Blaziken super effectively.

Choice Specs Hoopa-U has no tool to deal with Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele, Mega Mawile, Magearna, and Mega Gardevoir. Thus pairing Hoopa-U with Salazzle or Jirachi, which deal with these Pokemon quite well, is appreciated. At the same time, Hoopa-U deals with the Water-types Salazzle and Jirachi struggle with, such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Swampert. Choice Specs Hoopa-U still fails to beat some of 1v1's strongest Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Y, Dragonite, and Magearna. Garchomp, Heatran, and Mega Altaria deal with most of them and appreciate Hoopa-U dealing with stall Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro and Mew that they can't take on. Hoopa-U is also great at bluffing sets and baiting. Its Choice Specs set is great at baiting Mega Gyarados, while its Choice Band set baits Primarina and Tapu Fini. Having at least one physical attacking Pokemon and a special attacking Pokemon makes the opponent question what set Hoopa-U could be running.</p> "

Additionally, no single type resists both Dark and Fire, giving Incineroar pretty decent coverage with its STAB options. However, Incineroar has terrible base Speed even for a bulky attacker, so it struggles against speedy variants of Pokemon that Fire-types usually excel against, mainly Magearna, and is also susceptible to faster niche threats such as Smeargle and Vivillon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Incineroar can run a Jolly nature and Swords Dance in order to outspeed and overpower Magearna, which can survive Flare Blitz after an Iron Defense boost. However, Incineroar will lose some overall bulk, which can be detrimental against foes such as Dragonite and Naganadel. Alongside Fake Out, Earthquake allows Incineroar to lure in Air Balloon Heatran, generally one of the best Fire-type counters in 1v1, and swiftly knock it out before it can do the same.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers with Super Effective Moves: Despite Incineroar's positive matchups against several highly ranked Pokemon in 1v1, it still struggles against most Pokemon that can hit it super effectively and survive Fake Out followed by an attack. Bulky Water-, Rock-, Ground-, and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Diancie, Garchomp, and Mega Lopunny all threaten Incineroar.</p> <p><strong>Greninja: Greninja is an incredibly common threat in 1v1 that can easily drown Incineroar in its powerful Hydro Cannon or Hydro Vortex.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Jumpluff, Breloom, Smeargle, and Vivillon can all put Incineroar to sleep before it can do anything to stop them thanks to its below-average Speed. Taunt can somewhat mitigate these threats, but that is reliant on getting good luck with sleep turns and therefore makes Incineroar only a soft check at best.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fairy-type Pokemon: Fairy-type Pokemon that can shrug off Incineroar's Malicious Moonsault and Flare Blitz can seriously threaten it with either setup moves or slow chip damage. Pokemon such as Magearna, bulky Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Altaria can all mitigate the damage from Incineroar's attacks and follow up with powerful Fairy-type moves in return.</p> <p><strong>Extraordinarily Powerful Special Attackers: Pokemon such as Volcarona and Porygon-Z have the firepower needed to blast through Incineroar despite its notable Special Defense investment.</p> ",

        "name": "Bulk Up Offense",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Bulk Up is lets Incineroar tank multiple hits from some of the strongest offensive threats in the metagame such as physical Dragonite, Celesteela, and Mega Charizard X. Fake Out allows Incineroar to break abilities like Multiscale and Sturdy for free, as well as get Pokemon into the KO range of Incineroar's remaining attacks. This will allow Incineroar to beat Pokemon such as Dragonite, Magnezone, Haxorus, and bulky Mega Charizard Y. Darkest Lariat is a moderately powerful Dark-type STAB move unique to Incineroar that allows it to ignore opposing stat changes, particularly any boosts in Defense. This allows Incineroar to blast through stall Pokemon that rely on boosting their Defense, such as Mega Slowbro, Deoxys-S, and Type: Null. When boosted by Incinium Z, it becomes an exceptionally powerful one-time attack capable of dealing with threats such as Meloetta, Mega Metagross, and Aegislash. Flare Blitz is Incineroar's secondary STAB option, not only hitting harder than Darkest Lariat but also threatening Steel-type Pokemon such as Kartana, Genesect, and Celesteela. Taunt can be useful to beat certain stall Pokemon such as Jumpluff, Breloom, and Chansey. Will-O-Wisp can be run with a faster spread in order to beat Donphan and Golem.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment and 108 Defense EVs let Incineroar survive Devastating Drake from physical Dragonite, use Bulk Up, and then survive the following Earthquake; it also lets Incineroar tank two uses of Outrage from Mega Charizard X. Maximum HP investment and 100 Special Defense EVs allow Incineroar to survive Gigavolt Havoc from Magnezone, Draco Meteor from Naganadel, and Air Slash followed by Blast Burn from Speedy Bulky Mega Charizard Y. The remaining EVs are put into Attack alongside an Adamant nature in order to improve its offensive presence. Intimidate enables Incineroar to survive physical attacks it normally wouldn't be able to, such as Devastating Drake from physical Dragonite and Giga Impact from non-Hyper Cutter Mega Pinsir.</p> <p>A more specially defensive EV spread of 228 HP / 28 Atk / 252 SpD with an Adamant nature can also be run in order to always survive Choice Scarf Porygon-Z's Hyper Beam and beat Speedy Bulky Tapu Lele variants. If you're running Will-O-Wisp, a spread of 28 HP / 52 Atk / 252 Def / 176 Spe with an Impish nature can be used in order to beat Donphan and Golem, alongside maintaining a physical Dragonite matchup.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Don't use Fake Out against Tapu Lele, as it can block Fake Out with Psychic Surge. Against Mega Slowbro and Speedy Bulky Tapu Lele , using Bulk Up allows Incineroar to react to either Iron Defense and Scald from the former or Moonblast and Z-Reflect from the latter. Against Mega Slowbro, Bulk Up allows either Darkest Lariat to 2HKO through Iron Defense or Malicious Moonsault to OHKO if Mega Slowbro uses Scald. For Tapu Lele, using Bulk Up allows Incineroar to 3HKO it with a combination of Malicious Moonsault followed by two uses of Darkest Lariat through Z-Reflect, with Bulk Up forcing Tapu Lele to use Z-Reflect no matter what, avoiding the need to predict. Bear in mind, however, that Incineroar can only beat this Tapu Lele set with the alternative specially defensive EV spread.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Incineroar appreciates answers to Pokemon that can hit it super effectively, mainly Water-, Rock-, Ground-, and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, Golem, and Kommo-o. To fulfill this need, use bulky Grass-, Psychic-, Water-, and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Tapu Lele, Mega Slowbro, Primarina, and Tapu Fini, all of which can sponge up any attacks coming from these threats and fire back with their own super effective moves. They also appreciate Incineroar's penchant to nail hyper offensive threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Magnezone. Incineroar is naturally slow and thus has issues with Pokemon that can capitalize on its poor Speed, such as Jumpluff, standard Magearna, and Vivillon. Pokemon such as Genesect, Ferrothorn, and Taunt Mega Mawile can all do well against these Pokemon.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>With a stellar Water / Fairy typing, a great Special Attack, and good Special Defense, Primarina proves itself to be a prevalent threat in the 1v1 metagame. Its typing is useful for both defensive and offensive purposes, as it enables it to take on many of the tier's most prevalent Water-, Fire-, and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Charizard X, and Kommo-o as well as Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon such as Donphan and Crustle. Very few type combinations resist both Fairy- and Water-type moves, allowing Primarina's high-Base Power STAB moves in Oceanic Operetta and Moonblast to hit most of the metagame neutrally. Primarina can forego Special Attack investment to invest in its Defense to survive powerful hits such as Tectonic Rage from Landorus-T, as it already has enough power with its STAB moves. Access to priority in Aqua Jet allows Primarina to beat Sturdy Pokemon and pick off weakened Pokemon. Access to Encore also allows it to beat passive Pokemon like Mega Slowbro. Although Primarina faces competition from Tapu Fini, it can offer more power and utility with Oceanic Operetta and Encore. However, Primarina is weak to common Grass-, Electric-, and Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur, Zeraora, and Naganadel. Also, Primarina has no way of boosting its power, so it can fall prey to bulky setup Pokemon like Meloetta and Magearna and powerful nukes such as Breakneck Blitz from Porygon-Z.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Primarina can run a fairly viable Choice Specs set with wide coverage options in Hydro Cannon, Sparkling Aria, Moonblast, Hidden Power Fire, Psychic, Shadow Ball, Icy Wind, Ice Beam, and Energy Ball. This allows it to beat Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Mega Swampert but loses out on the utility that the bulky Primarium Z set brings with the option of switching moves, meaning that it will be unable to reliably check Sturdy Pokemon like Carracosta, Crustle, and Sawk. A Fairium Z set with Baby-Doll Eyes can ease the matchup versus some physical attackers or allow Primarina to use Twinkle Tackle. This can be helpful against Pokemon such as Gyarados, Zygarde, and physical Dragonite but leaves Primarina unable to blast through Pokemon such as Mega Mawile. A Quiet nature can be used over Relaxed if power is preferred over bulk to ensure OHKOs on Pokemon such as maximum HP Mega Mawile; however, this may leave Primarina vulnerable to some of the physical threats it used to check.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Attacker with Super Effective Moves: Pokemon who have an offensive type advantage over Primarina such as Kartana, Tapu Bulu, Electrium Z Zeraora, Magnezone, and Choice Specs Naganadel easily outspeed and OHKO Primarina before it can even land a hit.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Pokemon like Tapu Fini, Tapu Lele, and Chansey have naturally high Special Defense, preventing Primarina from posing any threat.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Flyinium Z Dragonite, Choice Band Hoopa-U with Gunk Shot, Mega Heracross with Bullet Seed, and Choice Specs Porygon-Z are some of the Pokemon that can OHKO Primarina with their overwhelming offenses.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Typing Advantage: Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Volcanion can whittle Primarina down while taking little damage. However, Ferrothorn can be lured and taken out with a Choice Specs set with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Special Defense-boosting Pokemon: Pokemon that can boost their Special Defense such as Magearna, Necrozma, Deoxys-S, Mew, Mega Gardevoir, and Meloetta prevent Primarina from OHKOing them and are able to either stall Primarina's PP or take it out after boosting up. As these Pokemon are naturally faster than Primarina, they do not fear being locked into a move by Encore.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sparkling Aria becomes Oceanic Operetta with Primarium Z, which has an astounding 195 Base Power. Sparkling Aria also goes through Substitute, which is helpful against common Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Mega Blaziken. Waterium Z with Hydro Cannon can be used for the extra 5 Base Power over Oceanic Operetta as well as more immediate power to 2HKO opposing Pokemon more easily. However, it loses Sparkling Aria's ability to go through Substitute and requires a recharge turn afterwards. Moonblast is mostly used when the foe resists Water and is weak to Fairy, such as against Mega Gyarados and Haxorus. This is because a neutral Oceanic Operetta still does more damage than a super effective Moonblast. However, if Oceanic Operetta does not OHKO the foe, Moonblast is the preferred move of choice. Aqua Jet is a useful STAB priority move that can get boosted by Torrent to finish off Pokemon that manage to survive Primarina's primary STAB moves, such as Garchomp, Genesect, and Sturdy Pokemon. Aqua Jet can also be used to evade certain strategies, such as Mirror Coat from Avalugg. Encore is used to defeat certain setup or stall Pokemon, such as locking Mega Gyarados into Dragon Dance and Mega Slowbro into Calm Mind or Amnesia. Substitute is used to guarantee Torrent's boost against Pokemon that do not already put Primarina into Torrent range, such as Mega Metagross, Mega Mawile, and Zygarde. It can also be used to evade status from slower Pokemon such as Pyukumuku and Aron.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>240 HP EVs and maximum Defense investment are required in order to be able to survive powerful hits from physical attackers such as Tectonic Rage followed by Sucker Punch from Golem, Poison Jab from Choice Band Haxorus, and Fake Out followed by Giga Impact from Mega Lopunny. The 16 Special Defense EVs ensure that Download users like Genesect do not receive a Special Attack boost. Special Attack investment is not necessary, as Primarina already has decent Special Attack. Torrent is an amazing ability that boosts Primarina's Water-type moves to insane levels when at or below 1/3 max HP, which can be manipulated with Substitute. This boost is commonly triggered by Pokemon that fail to OHKO Primarina, such as Choice Specs Meloetta and Choice Specs Magearna. 0 Speed IVs with a negative Speed nature allow Primarina to not automatically lose to Aegislash by giving Primarina a chance to attack it in its vulnerable Blade forme. If running Substitute, it is better to run Bold over Relaxed with 31 Speed IVs to allow Primarina to set up Substitute before slower Pokemon like minimum Speed Aegislash, Mega Mawile, and Mega Aggron.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>For passive, slower Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro, attack as usual on Turn 1, and then after they use a setup move, use Encore to prevent them from switching moves. In this case, repeatedly use Encore on them on the appropriate turns to ensure that they cannot retaliate. For some Pokemon that do not put Primarina into Torrent range, it can be better to use Substitute rather than attack. For example, against bulky Mega Metagross, it is better to use Substitute first to trigger Torrent and then OHKO it with Torrent-boosted Oceanic Operetta. Against Pokemon that run Metal Burst, such as specially defensive Mega Mawile and Mega Aggron, it is wiser to use Moonblast first before firing off Oceanic Operetta so as not to get OHKOed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Grass-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Kartana and Fire-type Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Incineroar are good teammates for Primarina, as they cover each other's threats. Ferrothorn and Kartana can handle the Electric- and Water- Pokemon that trouble Primarina such as Zeraora and Tapu Fini, while Mega Charizard X and Incineroar defeat Grass- and Steel-types such as Mega Venusaur and Magearna, and Primarina takes care of Fire- and Dragon- types like Mega Charizard X and Haxorus. Physical attackers such as Zeraora and Mega Metagross help in breaking specially defensive Pokemon such as Meloetta and Chansey, while Primarina takes care of physically defensive Pokemon such as Sturdy users. Fighting-type Pokemon such as Sawk and Mega Blaziken are able to cover the Steel-types that bother Primarina such as Kartana and Magearna, while Primarina can take out Pokemon that threaten them like Donphan and Golem.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>In a metagame where Knock Off, Trick, and Switcheroo are nearly irrelevant, Type: Null performs satisfactorily as a bulky tank and PP staller due to Battle Armor and Eviolite. Its absurd bulk allows it to take on several key metagame threats such as Landorus-T, Mega Aggron lacking Taunt, and Greninja. Type: Null also possesses only a single weakness in Fighting, which allows it to take on a larger portion of the metagame. However, its reliance on non-attacking moves allows Pokemon such as Tapu Lele and Mega Gyarados to easily shut Type: Null down with Taunt and defeat it. Furthermore, Type: Null is also susceptible to Fighting-types such as Mega Lopunny and Sawk, as well as Fighting-type coverage such as Focus Blast from Mega Gardevoir and Hoopa-U. Type: Null also has difficulty differentiating itself from other bulky Normal-type tanks such as Chansey, which are not nearly as one-dimensional. Lastly, Type: Null does not have any useful type resistances to complement its stellar bulk, which in practice doesn't make it seem nearly as bulky as it looks on paper.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Metal Sound over Flame Charge or Return gives Type: Null 32 additional PP to play with. However, giving up an attack would mean that Type: Null would become even more susceptible to Taunt users such as Mega Gyarados, and the high PP of Confide and Iron Defense along with the guaranteed sleep turns of Rest is usually sufficient for PP stalling. Toxic can badly poison the foe and mitigates Type: Null's low offensive presence. However, several Pokemon such as Zygarde-C and Mega Slowbro can alleviate their status in the very same fashion Type: Null does, via Rest. Toxic also has way less PP than all of Type: Null's other moves and leaves it susceptible not only to Taunt but also to Substitute users such as Mega Gyarados and the aforementioned Zygarde-C.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Heracross, Mega Lucario, and Mega Gallade can all blow back Type: Null with either a STAB super effective High Jump Kick or Close Combat.

Iron Defense allows Type: Null to boost its Defense by two stages, easing the matchup against certain physical attackers such as Golem, Choice-locked Garchomp, and physical Hoopa-U. Rest alleviates Type: Null's status and fully restores its health so it can take repeated hits from top-tier threats such as Mega Metagross. Rest also guarantees sleep turns for Type: Null to burn out the PP of opposing Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro. Flame Charge can be used to not only deal damage, but also eventually outspeed his opponents, allowing for Type: Null to be able to use Rest freely against offensive Taunt users like Krookodile, Mega Gardevoir, and bulky Tapu Lele, and therefore being able to more effectively PP them. Return, while not very strong due to the lack of Attack investment, prevents Type: Null from being completely shut down by Taunt and Substitute users such as Mega Gyarados and Tapu Lele while also slowly chipping away at Pokemon such as Mega Mawile and Golem that lack reliable recovery options. However, because Type: Null doesn't have Attack investment, Return may not be enough to defeat Taunt users with recovery such as Mew.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP and 80 Defense EVs alongside and Impish nature allow Type: Null to take on a myriad of physical attackers such as Landorus-T and Choice Band Garchomp. The 180 EV in Special Defense allow Type: Null to prevent being 2HKOed by a Mega Charizard Y's Blast Burn after Confide, allowing Type: Null to safely rest off damage accumulated until the sun wears off. The given Defense and Special Defense EVs, alongside an Impish nature, also guarantee Download users such as Genesect raise their Attack instead of Special Attack, ensuring Type: Null avoids being 3HKOed after using Rest. Because Type: Null is not fully evolved, an Eviolite is equipped to further augment its defensive prowess. Battle Armor prevents Type: Null from being struck with a critical hit to make the foe incapable of overcoming Type: Null's Iron Defense's Defense boosts and Confide's Special Attack drops.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avoid picking Type: Null if the opposing team has certain Taunt users such as Mega Gyarados, wallbreakers such as non-Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, or dedicated PP stallers such as Mega Slowbro that can defeat it. Flame Charge is marginally useful against Genesect, as you can simply use Flame Charge twice against to win. If Type: Null is against a Pokemon that can potentially be either a physical or special attacker, such as Hoopa-U, determine if the rest of the opposing team is predominantly made up of physical or special attackers, and use your best judgment. Be careful to not use Rest prematurely, as Type: Null may not be able to win the matchup any longer if too many premature uses of Rest are used. Against opposing PP stallers, use Rest as soon as you get attacked so you can get the two free turns of guaranteed sleep. Do not attack the opposing PP staller, as then they would be able to use Rest and get their two free turns of guaranteed sleep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Faster Fighting-type checks such as Tapu Lele, Aegislash, and Landorus-T that can dissuade the opponent from sending in Fighting-types make good partners for Type: Null, as scaring the opponent from choosing their Mega Lopunny, Mega Blaziken, or Sawk is crucial for Type: Null to have a good matchup. Teammates such as Tapu Bulu, Mega Diancie, and Mega Metagross that can defeat common Taunt and Substitute users such as Mega Gyarados and Tapu Lele are essential in discouraging the opponent from choosing these threats to face Type: Null. Pokemon that beat common Ghost-types such as Mega Lopunny and Heatran are also incredibly useful.</p> "

It also has access to the only Z-Move that deals damage and boosts all stats, Clangorous Soulblaze, which gives it the power necessary to beat threats such as Greninja, Mega Charizard Y, and Zygarde. Kommo-o also has a somewhat rare niche of being able to beat virtually every single Sturdy Pokemon in the metagame, such as Donphan, Carracosta, and Magnezone. It only loses to Skarmory, thanks to the latter's Supersonic Skystrike. With some defensive EV investment, Kommo-o can tank several powerful attacks such as Ice Beam from Choice Specs Greninja, Air Slash from Mega Charizard Y, and Outrage from Mega Gyarados without compromising its ability to reliably overcome its other matchups. Unfortunately, its relatively poor defensive typing for the 1v1 metagame makes it quite susceptible to virtually every Fairy-type, such as Magearna, Tapu Lele, Tapu Fini, and Mega Gardevoir.

Its corresponding Z-Move, Clangorous Soulblaze, also boosts all of Kommo-o's stats by one stage, giving it not only the bulk to tank moves such as Never-Ending Nightmare from Aegislash and Tectonic Rage followed by Ice Shard from Donphan, but also the Speed necessary to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Genesect, and Meloetta. Clanging Scales and Clangorous Soulblaze are both sound-based moves, allowing them to bypass Substitutes from Pokemon such as Jumpluff and Flail Mega Lopunny. Close Combat allows Kommo-o to take on Steel-types like Heatran, Magnezone, and Mega Aggron that resist its Dragon-type attacks. It can also more effectively deal with specially defensive Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar, Chansey, Blissey, and Meloetta, all of which could be issues for Kommo-o if they are allowed to set up or stall. Unfortunately, Close Combat's Defense drops mean it shouldn't be spammed it in matchups against Pokemon like Mega Aggron and Meloetta, where sufficient bulk is important. Flamethrower allows Kommo-o to beat Pokemon such as Genesect, Scizor, stall Tapu Bulu, and Aegislash. It also helps damage Volcarona without activating Swarm, as well as avoid stat drops from Close Combat and Clanging Scales against Pokemon such as Mega Aggron, Volcarona, and Meloetta. Taunt shuts down several stall Pokemon such as Celesteela, Pyukumuku, Chansey, and Blissey, as well as preventing Aegislash from using King's Shield to enter its Shield forme or Metal Sound or Laser Focus to bypass Kommo-o's Special Defense.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>240 HP and 100 Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature are used to ensure Kommo-o survives a Choice Specs Greninja's Ice Beam and other powerful special attacks like Choice Scarf Porygon-Z's Hyper Beam, Choice Specs Genesect's Ice Beam, and Mega Charizard Y's Air Slash. The 240 HP EVs maximize Kommo-o's physical bulk, letting it tank Zen Headbutt from Adamant Choice Band Victini, Outrage from an offensive Mega Gyarados, and Fake Out followed by Giga Impact from an Adamant Mega Lopunny relatively comfortably. 28 Attack EVs guarantee that Kommo-o's Close Combat is able to OHKO standard Mega Lopunny, even with a Calm nature. 56 EVs in Speed allow Kommo-o to reach 330 Speed after a Clangorous Soulblaze, letting it outspeed and defeat Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Choice Band Victini, and stall Mew. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack, allowing Kommo-o to OHKO Greninja with Clangorous Soulblaze. Both Soundproof and Overcoat can be run on Kommo-o, as each ability has its own niche. Soundproof ensures Kommo-o doesn't always lose to Ditto, opposing Kommo-o, and avoids an unreliable matchup against Metal Sound Aegislash. Overcoat allows Kommo-o to beat a Transformed Smeargle with Clangorous Soulblaze, as a Transformed Smeargle with Soundproof would be immune to it, along with beating non-Flyinium Vivillon as well.</p> <p>Kommo-o can run a faster, less bulky variant with 88 HP / 28 Atk / 4 Def / 136 SpA / 252 Spe EVs and a Timid nature in order to outspeed and beat bulky Mega Charizard X and Modest Breakneck Blitz Porygon-Z, both of which are threats to standard Kommo-o, while still being able to beat Mega Lopunny and Mega Gyarados. However, with this set it loses to virtually every special attacker it can beat with the standard set, and thus this set should only be run as a niche anti-meta option with very supportive teammates. Additionally, a more offensive EV spread of 128 HP / 252 SpA / 128 Spe can be run in order to have a better matchup against bulky Meta Metagross, and faster threats like offensive Mega Lucario.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against bulky special attackers such as Meloetta and Volcarona, Kommo-o should use Clanging Scales and Flamethrower in order to get them in range of Close Combat, as they both have ways to raise their Special Defense but not their Defense. Avoid sending Kommo-o in against any Fairy- and Dragon-type Pokemon, as it cannot deal with any of them except stall Tapu Bulu and Zygarde. Soundproof Kommo-o can consistently beat Metal Sound Aegislash through the following steps. On turn one, Kommo-o should use Clangorous Soulblaze to boost its defenses before Aegislash attacks; this is essential in avoiding significant damage from Aegislash's Z-Move. Then, Kommo-o should use Taunt to disable King's Shield and then KO Aegislash with Flamethrower. This strategy guarantees that Kommo-o always beats Aegislash, as +1 Kommo-o survives Aegislash's Z-Move followed by Shadow Ball and Shadow Sneak. Overcoat Kommo-o will unfortunately have to predict whether or not it uses Metal Sound or attacks, making this variant less reliable.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Kommo-o is generally  weak against Fairy-, Ice-, Psychic-, Flying-, and Dragon-type Pokemon; naturally bulky Steel-types such as Magearna, Heatran, Aegislash, and Mega Metagross can all provide an excellent defensive backbone against most threats of the aforementioned types, such as Mega Altaria, offensive Mew, Kyurem, and Vivillon. Kommo-o can also cover the weaknesses possessed by Steel-types by reliably beating most Ground-, Fire-, and Fighting-types, such as Sturdy Pokemon, Zygarde, Heatran, and standard Mega Lopunny. Alongside the Steel-types, run options in order to cover up a few matchups that Steel-types don't universally cover, such as against Mega Charizard X, Supersonic Skystrike Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Naganadel. Mega Slowbro, Stored Power Necrozma, Mega Gyarados, Chansey, and Blissey can all fill this role. In exchange, Kommo-o can beat most Dark- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, Greninja, Pheromosa, and Keldeo. Besides the aforementioned, Kommo-o appreciates Pokemon that universally cover Dragon-types, as, except for Zygarde, they all have favorable matchups against Kommo-o. Pokemon that can beat every viable Dragon-type in the metagame include Mega Diancie and specially defensive Mega Altaria. Sturdy users such as Magnezone, Crustle, Donphan, and Carracosta can also serve as excellent teammates, as they can tank overwhelming offensive moves that Kommo-o has trouble with, such as a Breakneck Blitz from Porygon-Z and Outrage from Mega Charizard X, and hit back hard. Magnezone is especially relevant, as it can take on Fairy-type Pokemon in the tier. In return, Sturdy Pokemon appreciate the favorable matchups Kommo-o has against traditional Sturdy breakers such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Lopunny.</p> "

  "Nihilego": {
    "overview": "<p>Nihilego is capable of both attacking and tanking to a respectable extent. Its advantage lies in its Rock / Poison typing, which is good offensively against major forces in the 1v1 metagame in Fire- and Fairy-type Pokemon, like Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Fini. Nihilego's formidable special bulk allows it to tank strong moves like a Hydro Vortex from Tapu Fini with appropriate investment. Physically, its extremely frail Defense is just not enough to tank most super effective physical moves, especially from Steel- and Ground-type Pokemon like Mega Metagross, Mega Aggron, Zygarde, and Donphan. Pokemon who also carry Earthquake as a coverage move, like Dragonite, Haxorus, Sawk, and Mega Pinsir, will be able to easily knock out Nihilego. Lastly, its immediate power is usually not enough to shore up its awkward defense typing, leaving it wide open to Pokemon like Heatran, Zeraora, Mega Blaziken, and Necrozma, who can all outdamage Nihilego.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Nihilego can run Poisonium Z in order to beat certain Fairy-type Pokemon like Primarina, Tapu Lele, and Mega Gardevoir while not being locked into one move. However, this set is generally outclassed by Rockium Z in overall coverage, as running Poisonium Z will causes you to lose the Mega Charizard X matchup. Nihilego can also utilize an Air Balloon with a Modest nature and Hidden Power Ice to lure in Pokemon that use Ground-type moves, such as Mega Pinsir and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. However, such a set is only useful as a lure and does not deal a lot of damage. Nihilego can utilize Spite, in combination with Substitute, to lure and beat Magearna, by blocking Pain Split and depleting Fleur Cannon's PP, as well as counter non-Earth Power Choice Specs Necrozma.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon and Coverage: Ground-type Pokemon like Zygarde check Nihilego, since they resist both of Nihilego's STAB attacks. Also, Earthquake from Pokemon like Dragonite and Mega Pinsir can take out Nihilego very easily due to its 4x weakness to Ground.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types like Mega Mawile, Magearna, Mega Metagross, and Ferrothorn check Nihilego because its Poison-type attacks deal no damage and its Rock-type attacks are not very effective.</p> <p><strong>Special Tanks: Choice Specs Necrozma and Mega Gyarados can handle Nihilego's special moves easily and deal heavy damage in return with their respective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Physical Attackers: Almost all faster physical attackers like Durant, Archeops, and Kartana outspeed Nihilego and KO it with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Pokemon: Common threats with Sturdy in the 1v1 metagame include Donphan, Golem, and Crustle; Nihilego is disadvantaged against these Pokemon, as they can endure one attack from it and KO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Strong Super Effective Attackers: Nihilego is easily cracked by Pokemon like Mega Blastoise, Mew, and Hoopa-U, which can survive its attacks and retaliate with strong super effective STAB attacks such as Hydro Cannon, Genesis Supernova, and Zen Headbutt.</p> ",

Acid Spray is another option that can be used to beat stall Pokemon such as Deoxys-S, Mega Venusaur, and Kee Berry Mew. Dazzling Gleam can be used to KO Kommo-o, Krookodile, and Hydreigon, while Grass Knot is an option to beat Pokemon such as Mega Swampert, Mega Slowbro and Quagsire.

Nihilego's typing and inability to handle Steel- and Ground-type Pokemon make it almost a necessity to have a Pokemon like Mega Gyarados or Mega Blastoise that can beat them; these two are also good teammates because Nihilego can take care of Grass-types for them. Since Nihilego can struggle against Water-types, Grass-type Pokemon like Kartana, which can also run Sacred Sword to counter Dark-types, can be used to beat them. Also, Nihilego's weakness to Psychic and Steel makes Volcarona a viable teammate for Nihilego, as it can beat Pokemon like Mega Metagross and Mega Mawile. Fast Mega Heracross is also a good teammate, as it can beat Jumpluff, Heatran, Mega Gyarados, and Sturdy users, all of which trouble Nihilego, and Nihilego can beat Fairy- and Fire-types to support Mega Heracross in return.</p> "

Since Nihilego struggles against Steel-type Pokemon like Mega Metagross, Magearna, and Mega Mawile, Ground-type Pokemon like Zygarde can be used as teammates; Nihilego can also cover Zygarde's Ice-type weakness. Nihilego can handle most Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon, so Pokemon like Mega Heracross can be used to lure in these Pokemon, with Mega Heracross also defeating Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, Donphan, Golem, and Jumpluff for Nihilego.

  "Buzzwole": {
    "overview": "<p>Buzzwole is one of the most physically bulky Pokemon available in the 1v1 metagame, which allows it to tank strong attacks such as +3 Waterfall from Mega Gyarados with sufficient investment. With a base Attack stat of 139 along with moves such as Bulk Up and Roost, it is able to defeat physical walls such as Avalugg, Zygarde-C, and Mega Aggron. Lunge can be used in order to not only deal damage but also lower your their Attack by one stage on each hit, shutting down Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados and Tectonic Rage Landorus-T, which need to boost their Attack to break Buzzwole. However, although Buzzwole has high HP, due to its subpar Special Defense it is unable to tank attacks from common metagame threats, such as Hyper Beam from Porygon-Z, Hydro Cannon from Greninja, and Clangorous Soulblaze from Kommo-o. Another one of Buzzwole's main drawbacks is its weakness to commonly used offensive types such as Fire, Fairy, and Flying, meaning it's vulnerable to threats such as Charizard, Tapu Lele, Primarina, and Supersonic Skystrike Landorus-T. Buzzwole also struggles against Pokemon that can exploit its low speed, such as Whimsicott and Smeargle, which can cripple it with Leech Seed or Spore before it can fight back.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fightinium Z can be run alongside maximum HP and Defense investment with an Impish nature in order to gain the advantage against certain Pokemon such as Mega Mawile, Zen Headbutt Mega Metagross, Darmanitan, and non-Substitute Mega Blaziken. However, given that the Lunge set already handles most physical attackers that Fightinium Z can be used for, it is severely outclassed by Buginium Z. A Choice Band set with Hammer Arm over Superpower and Thunder Punch, Ice Punch, or Earthquake instead of Bulk Up with the same EVs can be used with decent success. Since Buzzwole lacks sufficient Speed, a Choice Scarf set with Lunge, Superpower, Poison Jab, and Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, or Stone Edge could also be used to take out some Pokemon such as Gyarados, Greninja, Jumpluff, Mega Charizard Y, and Whimsicott. An Assault Vest can also be utilized to defeat some special attackers like Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Choice Specs Greninja, and Aegislash.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon: Buzzwole is 4x weak to Flying, so Pokemon such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Charizard Y, offensive Celesteela, and Flyinium Z Dragonite can easily KO it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Pokemon such as Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Blaziken can reliably beat Buzzwole with super effective Fire-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Pokemon such as Aegislash and Taunt Mega Sableye are successful in checking Buzzwole, as Buzzwole cannot effectively damage them and they will often be able to knock out Buzzwole with special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Buzzwole can't tank strong neutral special attacks, since it has very poor special bulk. Thus, Pokemon like Magearna, Greninja, Porygon-Z, Tapu Lele, and Choice Specs Necrozma easily defeat Buzzwole.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Physical Attackers: Mega Medicham and Mega Mawile are some of the physically offensive Pokemon that are able to defeat Buzzwole because of the combination of their high Attack stats and their strong super effective STAB moves in Zen Headbutt and Play Rough.</p> ",

        "name": "Bulk Up",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Bulk Up helps set up against physically offensive Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, non-Zen Headbutt Mega Metagross, Zygarde, and Garchomp so it can survive the next attack and retaliate. Lunge is used for reducing the Attack of Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados and inflicting not very effective or neutral damage against Sturdy Pokemon that use Counter or Metal Burst such as Aggron, Donphan, and Crustle. Lunge also helps KO slow Grass- and Psychic-type Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu and Hoopa-U, or knock Pokemon out with a Savage Spin-Out, like Meloetta. Roost heals the damage taken from Pokemon such as non-Zen Headbutt Mega Metagross, Zygarde, and Excadrill. Taunt can be run in order to shut down stall and setup Pokemon that can contest Buzzwole's offensive presence, such as Jumpluff, Stored Power Necrozma, Mega Gyarados, and Zygarde-C. Superpower can be run in order to beat Heatran, usually over Taunt.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>92 HP EVs and 192 Defense EVs allow Buzzwole to tank a Choice Band Garchomp's Outrage twice after Bulk Up, as well as hits from physical threats such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Metagross, and Zygarde. 180 Speed EVs coupled with an Jolly nature assist Buzzwole in defeating Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, allowing Buzzwole to use Taunt before a potential opposing Taunt from an Adamant Gyarados, the only variant that Gyarados can threaten its natural bulk with Waterfall flinches. This also allows Buzzwole to outspeed Pokemon such as bulky Meloetta and offensive Mega Venusaur, after Bulk Up, which would beat Buzzwole if they could go first. The 44 EVs in Attack are leftovers. Buginium Z is used in order to OHKO threats such as Meloetta, bulky Hoopa-U, and Mega Venusaur.</p> <p>Alternatively, Buzzwole can run the spread of 216 HP / 112 SpD / 180 Spe with a Jolly nature in order to get the best odds against mixed Zeraora, as well as a simple 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe spread that retains the positive Mega Gyarados matchup while gaining the ability to OHKO Pokemon like Choice Band Haxorus, Necrozma, and Deoxys-S after Iron Defense. These EVs should be used when running Superpower, in order to beat bulky Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against bulky Incineroar, feel free to simply spam Lunge, as you will never be able to be 2HKOed by Flare Blitz after a Lunge, letting you safely heal off the damage dealt by Incineroar, and having Incineroar damage itself through recoil. Against Garchomp, do not go for Lunge, instead use Bulk Up in order to prevent Rough Skin recoil damage from affecting you. If you're running the anti-Zeraora spread, simply use Savage Spin-Out as soon as possible, to OHKO Zeraora, who could OHKO Buzzwole if it bothers to use setup with a Charge-boosted Gigavolt Havoc.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since Buzzwole has very average special bulk and struggles to take on Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon, Mega Charizard X, Nihilego and Chansey are good teammates. Both of them also appreciate Buzzwole's ability to beat the physical attackers that would otherwise threaten them. Because most of the Ground-type Pokemon that Nihilego has difficulties against are physical attackers, Buzzwole can take them out. Other specially defensive Pokemon such as Meloetta and Hoopa-U can be used as teammates, since Buzzwole struggles against Pokemon such as Aegislash, and it does not have the bulk or Speed to take out Tapu Lele and Mega Gardevoir. Also, because Buzzwole is not very fast, some fast Pokemon such as Mega Blaziken and Zeraora can be used to make up for its not-so-high Speed, aiding against Pokemon like Naganadel and Greninja. Water-type Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise and Mega Swampert are good teammates because they can deal with the Fire-types that give Buzzwole issues, and Buzzwole can check several Grass-types for them in return. Magnezone with Electroweb can also be used alongside Buzzwole since it also learns Mirror Coat to KO special attackers.</p> "

  "Pheromosa": {
    "overview": "<p>Pheromosa is a glass cannon in the 1v1 metagame. One of its main assets is its Speed tier, which lets it naturally outspeed most unboosted Pokemon like Zeraora and Mega Lopunny and even some Choice Scarf Pokemon like Modest Porygon-Z and Modest Tapu Lele. Furthermore, its high Attack and Special Attack coupled with its good movepool let it beat many top-tier Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Zygarde-C, and Jumpluff. Pheromosa's ability to run either physical or special sets, unlike most other Fighting-types, makes it an unpredictable foe in battle; this fact can be used to gain an advantage in Team Preview against Pokemon like Zygarde and Nihilego, since special Pheromosa counters Zygarde, and physical sets take on Nihilego. However, Pheromosa's pitiful bulk makes it vulnerable to hits from any Pokemon it cannot immediately KO, so it finds itself unable to have a positive matchup against bulky Pokemon like Gyarados, Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Magearna. This severely affects its usage and leaves it outclassed by other Fighting- and Bug-type Pokemon like Kommo-o, Mega Lopunny, and Volcarona.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The special Fightinium Z set can use a spread of 160 Def / 156 SpA / 192 Spe along with a Naive nature and a moveset of Lunge / Bug Buzz / Focus Blast / High Jump Kick, where the Defense EVs are used to tank a Heavy Slam from Mega Aggron after the Attack drop from Lunge. This variant also has a small advantage of having dual offensive capability, which can help against certain Pokemon, but the loss in damage is apparent when up against Mega Slowbro and most Kommo-o, and the Naive nature makes it lose to Scald Mega Slowbro. A Choice Specs set with Bug Buzz, Focus Blast, Ice Beam or Blizzard, and Hidden Power Rock or Hyper Beam can be used, using Bug Buzz to beat Serperior and Whimsicott; Focus Blast to beat Pokemon like Heatran and non-Timid Choice Scarf Porygon-Z; Ice Beam to beat Garchomp and Landorus-T; Blizzard to beat Kommo-o, Mega Altaria, and Dragonite; Hidden Power Rock to beat Mega Charizard Y; and Hyper Beam to beat foes that don't resist it like Mega Medicham. The big issue with this is the low accuracy of Focus Blast and Blizzard, which, when coupled with its horrendous bulk, makes Pheromosa unable to win reliably. Z-Moves can also be used as coverage moves, with options including Subzero Slammer from Blizzard to take on Kommo-o and most Dragonite and Acid Downpour from Poison Jab with an EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe and an Adamant nature to give Pheromosa a good chance against bulkier Fairy-types like non-Choice Scarf Togekiss and Primarina. Jolly Pheromosa can be run in order to beat all variants of Togekiss, but this will leave Pheromosa with worse odds against Primarina. Such sets, however, do not beat anything apart from the limited range of Pokemon they can KO and are therefore used more as lure sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon: Any Pokemon that can tank either of its movesets' attacks can defeat Pheromosa, as Pheromosa is as frail as it gets. Such Pokemon include Gyarados, Charizard, Aegislash, and Mega Venusaur, which can KO it back with one of their own moves or just drain Pheromosa's HP away with Leech Seed and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Move Users: Choice Specs Deoxys-S outspeeds and KOes Pheromosa. Not many other Pokemon naturally outspeed Pheromosa, but Choice Scarf Pokemon like Timid Porygon-Z and Jolly Haxorus and boosted Speed Boost Pokemon like Mega Blaziken can take it out. Quick Attack Aerilate Mega Pinsir and Bullet Punch Technician Mega Scizor also KO it.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Pokemon like Mega Gengar and Mega Sableye resist both of Pheromosa's STAB attacks and aren't typically affected by its coverage moves.

Its high Base Power also lets Pheromosa beat some Pokemon like Genesect and Zeraora, which take neutral damage from it. Lunge is used to KO Psychic- and Dark-type Pokemon like Greninja, Meloetta, and Mew. Poison Jab lets Pheromosa beat some Fairy-type Pokemon like Mega Gardevoir and Whimsicott. Outrage can be used to potentially KO Dragon-type Pokemon like Naganadel and Kommo-o. Double Kick is an option to lure in and secure the KO on Sturdy Pokemon, most commonly Magnezone and Magneton. This also lets it beat FEAR Pokemon like Aron and Magnemite. Giga Impact can also be used as a last-ditch effort to KO some physically frail Pokemon like offensive Mega Charizard Y and Mega Medicham that do not take so much damage from every other move. Throat Chop is a final option to KO some Ghost-type Pokemon like Mega Gengar and Blacephalon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs along with a Jolly nature let Pheromosa outspeed Mega Alakazam, Zeraora, and Mega Lopunny.

An Adamant nature can also be used to OHKO bulkier Pokemon such as defensive Tapu Lele, Mega Slowbro, Kommo-o, and Magnezone, but this means Pheromosa loses to the aforementioned faster Pokemon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Since Pheromosa is a frail attacker and Choice-locked, try to go for the move that would immediately KO the opposing Pokemon. Avoid sending it out against bulky Pokemon like Gyarados, Charizard, Magearna, Primarina, and Tapu Fini, as they can tank any hit that Pheromosa throws at them and return the damage in full.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since Pheromosa is weak to physically bulky Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Magearna, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Metagross, some combination of bulky, special attacking nukes like Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Lele is good to pair with Pheromosa. Tapu Lele can check or counter Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Venusaur, while Mega Charizard Y can check or counter Mega Metagross and Magearna. Since these Pokemon are not super fast, they appreciate Pheromosa handling frail Substitute users like Jumpluff and Whimsicott and many special tanks like Meloetta and Mega Gardevoir. Since Pheromosa can take out some slow Fairy-type Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Gardevoir, some Pokemon that bait these Pokemon out like Mega Gyarados and special Dragonite pair well with it. Special Dragonite is particularly great as a teammate in this regard, as it can take on threats like Kommo-o, Zygarde-C, and Landorus-T. Since most Sturdy Pokemon like Donphan, Magnezone and Crustle counter Pheromosa, some of their counters like Mega Gyarados and Magnet Rise Groundium Z Excadrill and fast status users like Jumpluff and Smeargle can also make for good teammates. In return, Pheromosa can take out Fake Out users that threaten these Pokemon, such as Zeraora and Mega Lopunny if running a Jolly nature and bulky Tapu Lele and Mega Slowbro if Adamant. Grass-type Pokemon like Mega Venusaur, Serperior, and Tapu Bulu make good teammates, since most Water-type Pokemon like Mega Gyarados, Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Mega Swampert are bulky enough to tank whatever hit Pheromosa throws at them and can return the damage in full. In return, Pheromosa takes out Tapu Lele, Greninja, Meloetta and Heatran, which trouble these Grass-types.</p> "

Bug Buzz lets it take out Psychic-type Pokemon like Mega Slowbro most of the time. Being a sound-based move, it also goes through Substitute, which helps Pheromosa against faster Substitute users like non-Moonblast Whimsicott.

Lunge's Attack drop allows Pheromosa to tank attacks from these Pokemon and beat them. Use Ice Beam against unfavorable foes like Tapu Lele, where its freeze chance could come in handy. This isn't reliable at all, however, and should be a last-ditch effort. Avoid sending Pheromosa out against bulky Pokemon like Gyarados, Charizard, and Magearna, as these Pokemon can tank any attack from it and return the damage in full. If you are using the heavily defensive set and are matched up against Mega Gyarados, the play is to use Electroweb turn one and then, based on damage rolls for Electroweb, use All-Out Pummeling turn 2 if Electroweb does more than 60% damage or use Electroweb again if it does less, as Pheromosa can take a Waterfall from boosted bulky Mega Gyarados</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Some powerful physical attackers like specially defensive Mega Mawile and Groundium Z Garchomp do well as Pheromosa's teammates, since Pheromosa can take on common counters to these Pokemon like Donphan, Golem, and Landorus-T. Mega Mawile can take out Mega Gyarados, Tapu Lele, and Magnezone, while Groundium Z Garchomp takes on Charizard and Magearna. Since Pheromosa is so frail, some bulky Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar and specially defensive Substitute Primarina serve as excellent teammates. While Mega Tyranitar stands out because it can take on Charizard, Genesect, and Magnezone and bait out Donphan and Golem, Primarina can also be used to take out Mega Gyarados and Charizard and take on Mega Metagross, with Pheromosa beating Garchomp and Jumpluff in return.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Celesteela's great bulk, typing, and offensive presence help it to be a beast in the 1v1 metagame. Its diverse movepool with coverage moves such as Fire Blast and Giga Drain allows it to take on many threats in the metagame such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Mega Gyarados, Golem, and Donphan, while its STAB Corkscrew Crash allows it to mow down Fairy-types like Tapu Lele, Tapu Bulu, Mega Diancie, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Altaria, Togekiss, and non-Babiri Berry Whimsicott. With its Steel / Flying typing, Celesteela has key resistances to common Dragon-, Fairy-, Steel-, and Psychic-type Pokemon such as Dragonite, Magearna, Mega Aggron, and Meloetta. However, many common Fire- and Electric-type threats in the 1v1 metagame are able to OHKO it, such as Mega Charizard X and Y, Zeraora, and Magnezone. Also, Celesteela doesn't have a great Special Attack stat, meaning it has trouble breaking through walls such as Type: Null, even with Metal Sound. Furthermore, Celesteela's lackluster base Speed makes it susceptible to faster Pokemon like Mega Metagross, Mega Lopunny, and, in particular, sleep users like Jumpluff and Mega Gengar.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Leech Seed + Protect set can be utilized to stall out opposing Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Substitute Primarina. A Choice Specs set with Air Slash instead of Metal Sound allows all of Celesteela's moves to become more powerful to beat stronger targets such as Mega Lopunny, Kommo-o, Guardian of Alola Tapu Fini, and Serperior, although not having the ability to use Metal Sound causes Celesteela to lose out on matchups such as Porygon-Z and Meloetta.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Celesteela can't hit Electric-types for much damage, and most just OHKO it with a super effective move; such Pokemon include Magnezone, Zeraora, Magneton, Raikou, Zapdos, and Mega Ampharos.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types can easily OHKO Celesteela with their super effective moves. Examples include Mega Charizard X and Y, Heatran, Victini, Incineroar, Mega Blaziken, Volcarona, Volcanion, Rotom-H, Alolan Marowak, Delphox, and Darmanitan.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Some Taunt users can win against Celesteela if it can't win even after using Z-Metal Sound to bypass the Taunt. Examples of these Pokemon include Amnesia Mew and Deoxys-S. Mega Sableye reflects Taunt and easily stalls Celesteela, while Type: Null can use Confide against Celesteela, rendering its attacks useless.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Users: Jumpluff, Vivillon, and Mega Gengar can easily put Celesteela to sleep and either stall it out or KO it with powerful STAB attacks.</p> ",

It can also use Z-Metal Sound to bypass Taunt from users like Waterium Z Tapu Fini and Kee Berry Mew, lacking Amnesia. Flash Cannon in combination with Steelium Z allows Celesteela to have an easier time with Fairy-, Rock-, and Ice-type Pokemon, such as Mega Gardevoir, Terrakion, and Kyurem. Giga Drain gives Celesteela a better matchup versus Water-types such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Swampert, and Greninja, though almost all Ground- and Rock-types are already beaten by its other moves. Fire Blast is used to beat Grass-, Steel-, and Bug-type Pokemon more easily, including Kartana, non-Thunder Punch Mega Metagross, Genesect, Durant, and Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>188 HP and 192 Special Defense EVs allow Celesteela to take powerful hits such as a Never-Ending Nightmare follwed by Shadow Sneak from Aegislash and a Choice Specs-boosted Thunderbolt from Genesect while maximizing its physical bulk. 128 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature allow Celesteela to have as much power as possible. Steelium Z can either boost Flash Cannon's Base Power to 160 or allow Celesteela to boost its Special Attack with Z-Metal Sound.</p> <p>Celesteela can also choose to run a more physically defensive spread of 128 HP / 232 Def / 148 SpA EVs, which is specifically tailored to beat Mega Lopunny, as well as being able to live an Archeops's Head Smash and Continental Crush into Sucker Punch from Golem, although this will naturally lose its positive matchup with Aegislash and Genesect.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Beware of wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham and Crustle, who will OHKO or 2HKO Celesteela. Also, be wary of sleep users like Smeargle, Jumpluff, or Mega Gengar, as they'll make Celesteela unable to set up or move at all. If you predict the opposing Porygon-Z is running Choice Scarf, use Giga Drain followed by Corkscrew Crash to cover for Thunderbolt. If you are running the physically defensive spread, use Giga Drain turn two against Mega Lopunny, after Fake Out has been used, in order to heal off enough damage from the combined damage of Fake Out and High Jump Kick, letting Celesteela tank the second High Jump Kick and follow up with a Corkscrew Crash.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rock-types such as Carracosta and Crustle help Celesteela have an easier time against Fire-type Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Y and Victini, while in return Celesteela can take down Grass- and Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn with its Fire-type coverage, as well as Mold Breaker Pokemon that would OHKO Crustle or Carracosta such as Mega Gyarados and Haxorus. Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Golem, and Donphan help versus Fire- and Electric-types that make up a good portion of the metagame and almost always win against Celesteela such as Mega Charizard X and Y, Zeraora, Magnezone, and Heatran, while in return Celesteela can take down the Grass- and Ice-types that these Pokemon usually lose to such as Ferrothorn, Mega Venusaur, and Kyurem. Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Primarina can also be viable assets to your team, as they can take down Fire-type threats that Celesteela is ever so weak to, such as Mega Charizard X and Volcarona, as well as Zygarde-C. In return, Celesteela can beat Grass-types that trouble Tapu Fini and Primarina like Mega Venusaur and Tapu Bulu. Celesteela is a very slow threat compared to others in 1v1, so a fast Pokemon like Greninja, Choice Specs Deoxys-S, or Zeraora can be a viable asset to your team to beat Pokemon like Jumpluff and Mega Gengar; in return, Celesteela can take harder hits that these faster, more glass cannon-like Pokemon aren't capable of handling such as a Supersonic Skystrike or Devastating Drake from Dragonite or a Never-Ending Nightmare from Aegislash.</p> "

Despite this, Kartana is weak to Fire and Fighting, meaning frequently used Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Lopunny can easily counter it. It has horrific special bulk and is easily OHKOed by even resisted attacks from some of the most common special attackers in the metagame, such as Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Kommo-o, Magnezone, and Meloetta.

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>An Adamant Choice Scarf set can be used to take out Greninja, Mega Lopunny, and Naganadel but loses out on the firepower provided by other sets. Kartana can also run an all-out attacker set with Leaf Blade, Sacred Sword, Smart Strike, and Swords Dance or Substitute in the last moveslot, along with a spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe, a Jolly nature, and Grassium Z. In addition to having more coverage, such a set has more firepower to KO Pokemon like bulky Normalium Z Porygon-Z. Kartana can also make use of a Swords Dance / Substitute / Smart Strike / Laser Focus set with a spread of 112 Atk / 148 SpD / 248 Spe along with a Jolly nature and Steelium Z to counter Iron Defense Magearna and non-Hidden Power Fire Mega Venusaur.

Smart Strike hits Ice-, Rock-, and Fairy-type Pokemon like Alolan Ninetales, Nihilego, and Tapu Lele. Sacred Sword can be used against bulky Normal-types and some Steel-types like Chansey, Heatran, and Excadrill. However, this is not the most effective way to deal with Chansey and Heatran, since Chansey can tank a Sacred Sword and return with Counter, while Heatran sometimes has enough bulk to survive a Sacred Sword and KO Kartana with a Fire-type STAB move. Giga Impact is the hardest-hitting neutrally damaging move, giving Kartana a good chance to KO many defensively uninvested Mega Charizard, Garchomp, and Mega Pinsir.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>48 HP EVs allow Kartana to survive two Sucker Punches from maximum Attack Mega Mawile. 252 Speed EVs along with a Jolly nature help it to outspeed maximum Speed non-Choice Scarf Terrakion and Keldeo.

However, such a spread causes Kartana to lose out on other matchups like Landorus-T, and both Greninja and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z usually run Hidden Power Fire.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If it's a choice between Leaf Blade and Giga Impact, use Giga Impact unless you are sure that Leaf Blade will KO, since Giga Impact does more damage than STAB-boosted Leaf Blade, but it can miss. Avoid sending in Kartana on faster special attackers like Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Necrozma, Magnezone, and Naganadel. Also, don’t use Kartana against Sturdy Pokemon like Donphan, Aggron, and Magnezone, since they can use Counter, Metal Burst, or a Z-Move to finish it off.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since Fire-types and special attackers like Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Greninja, Porygon-Z, Magearna, and Magnezone beat Kartana, a specially defensive Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Primarina, Tapu Fini, or Chansey can be used as a teammate. In return, Kartana can help defeat common Mega Charizard X counters like Mega Gyarados, Primarina and Tapu Fini counters like Nihilego, and common Taunt users that usually give Chansey trouble like Mega Gyarados and Tapu Lele. Choice Specs Necrozma is also a good option, since it beats Donphan, Golem, some Fire-type Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, and Fighting-type Pokemon like Mega Blaziken and Mega Lopunny, while Kartana can help Necrozma with Mega Gyarados, Mega Charizard Y, Tapu Lele, and Mega Gardevoir.

Leaf Blade lets Kartana KO Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types like Mega Gyarados, Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Mega Tyranitar, and its high critical hit ratio helps in checking physical setup Pokemon like Coil Zygarde. Swords Dance lets Kartana set up on Zygarde and Mega Metagross after setting up Iron Defense. Substitute prevents Donphan and Golem from using  Counter.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The 176 HP EVs along with 24 Defense EVs ensure that Kartana can always use Synthesis after Iron Defense against Mega Metagross without having to worry about Hammer Arm and Bullet Punch, as Kartana will outspeed Adamant sets and tank Jolly variants' attacks. Kartana runs maximum Speed in order to outspeed and OHKO threats such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and non-Choice Scarf Blacephalon. The remaining EVs are given to Attack to increase Kartana's overall offensive presence. Grassium Z turns Leaf Blade into a powerful STAB-boosted Bloom Doom, which can even KO neutral physically bulky Pokemon like Mega Sableye and Landorus-T when boosted.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against most physical attackers like Mega Metagross, Zygarde-C, and Landorus-T, start off by using Iron Defense and healing the damage taken with Synthesis. After fully setting up with Iron Defense, start using either Swords Dance or Substitute. Finish off by using Bloom Doom followed by Leaf Blade if the foe is still standing.

Fighting-type Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Sawk, Mega Heracross, and Mega Blaziken counter Kartana; Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Primarina with appropriate Defense investment have an advantage over these Pokemon and hence make for good partners.

  "Necrozma": {
    "overview": "<p>Necrozma finds its niche as a bulky special attacker or potent stall Pokemon in the 1v1 metagame. Necrozma's respectable bulk gives it the ability to tank Mega Charizard X's Outrage, Mega Lopunny's Fake Out followed by Giga Impact, Garchomp's Tectonic Rage, and even Mega Charizard Y's sun-boosted Blast Burn. With strong STAB options in Photon Geyser, Prismatic Laser, and Stored Power and a wide range of coverage moves such as Heat Wave, Necrozma has the capability to KO a large portion of the metagame including Mega Venusaur, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Metagross. Furthermore, its access to status moves including Moonlight, Iron Defense, and Calm Mind in combination with Stored Power allows it to also function as a strong setup attacker, setting up defensive boosts and channeling them into huge attacks. However, Necrozma's utility as a bulky attacker is limited by its lacking offensive stats, which causes it to be reliant on having the correct coverage moves in order to win most matchups, as well as restricting it to using Choice Specs as its most viable offensive option.

Photon Geyser's secondary effects allows Necrozma to ignore enemy abilities, helping in matchups against Sturdy users like Crustle, Donphan, and FEAR Aron. As it doesn't come with a recharge turn, it's also helpful when playing mind games with Substitute users like bulky Landorus-T, which can attempt to avoid Prismatic Laser. Heat Wave allows Necrozma to hit Steel-type Pokemon such as Celesteela, offensive Mega Metagross, and Ferrothorn that resist its STAB moves. Signal Beam is one of Necrozma's primary coverage moves, allowing it to hit Psychic- and Dark- types that resist or are immune to Photon Geyser and Prismatic Laser, beating Greninja and offensive Mew. Hidden Power Ice is another coverage move that Necrozma can run, allowing for a guaranteed KO on Pokemon that are 4x weak to Ice-type moves that otherwise force Substitute predictions such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Zygarde. Another option is Hyper Voice, allowing Necrozma to gain specific matchups against Substitute users such as Substitute + Torrent Greninja and Flail Mega Lopunny. However, the opportunity cost is usually too great, and thus it isn't seen too often. Psyshock allows Necrozma to beat Tapu Lele consistently, even if they have Z-Reflect, but is otherwise inferior to Photon Geyser.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>176 HP and 100 Special Defense EVs let Necrozma tank a Choice Specs-boosted Bug Buzz from Genesect while retaining the physical bulk to beat threats like Fake Out + Giga Impact Mega Lopunny. Alternatively, a spread of 228 HP / 244 SpA / 36 SpD allows Necrozma to tank Mega Pinsir's Giga Impact and have a better matchup against Groundium Z Landorus-T, though it loses out on the Genesect matchup. 232 EVs in Special Attack with a Modest nature maximize Necrozma's attacking abilities after the bulk, letting it devastate key metagame threats like Mega Charizard X with its STAB Prismatic laser. Prism Armor improves Necrozma's bulk, allowing it to survive a Dark Pulse from Choice Specs Greninja.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against Substitute users like Garchomp and bulky Landorus-T, which if given a turn to set up will KO Necrozma but are eliminated by a Prismatic Laser, you must predict if they are going to use Substitute or a setup move, or use Hidden Power Ice if you are running it. Against non-Crunch Mega Gyarados, a similar prediction occurs but between whether or not they Mega Evolve. If you think they'll Mega Evolve, use Signal Beam. Otherwise, KO them with Prismatic Laser.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Flyinium Z Landorus-T is a useful teammate, handling Mega Gyarados, Chansey, and Aegislash. In return, Necrozma takes care of threats to Landorus-T in the form of Greninja, Naganadel, and Primarina. Metal Sound Magnezone is also appreciated, since it breaks many of the specially bulky Pokemon that wall Necrozma like Chansey, Tapu Fini, Magearna, and Meloetta. Necrozma, meanwhile, can defeat Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Donphan, and Mega Venusaur, which usually trouble Magnezone. Pokemon like Mega Gyarados also prove to be good teammates due to their wallbreaking capabilities, defeating Mega Sableye, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Aggron while appreciating Necrozma's assistance against Pokemon like Primarina and Mega Venusaur. Bulk Up Zeraora covers Steel- and Dark-types like Magnezone and Mega Gyarados, along with beating sleep users such as Smeargle and Jumpluff. In return, Necrozma defeats Pokemon like Donphan, Mega Altaria, Mega Charizard X, and Kommo-o that beat Electrium Z Zeraora.</p> "

Iron Defense gives Necrozma the capacity to beat physical threats like Mega Charizard X and physical Dragonite. Moonlight allows Necrozma to recover while setting up. Stored Power lets Necrozma take advantage of its boosts and even break through Pokemon that 4x resist it like Mega Metagross.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs maximize bulk for both defensive stats. 252 Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature allow Necrozma to tank a Blast Burn from Mega Charizard Y as well as maximize its chances against Breakneck Blitz from maximum Special Attack Porygon-Z. A pinch Berry such as Iapapa restores 50% health when Necrozma is at 25% or less, winning crucial matchups against foes like Greninja, Mega Charizard Y, Dragonite, and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z by allowing Necrozma to set up initially without worrying about recovery. Sitrus Berry can be used for a more consistent Charizard matchup, but overall it is outclassed by Iapapa Berry in almost every other matchup including against Greninja and Porygon-Z. Prism Armor is Necrozma's only ability and maximizes its bulk against super effective attackers.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Don't send Necrozma out against Dark-types or Pokemon that use Taunt, as with the exception of some Choice item attackers like Greninja that you can PP stall, they totally shut down this set. Against Pokemon that could be either physical or special like Charizard and Dragonite, there are general strategies that can cover both variants most of the time. Against Charizard, use Calm Mind turn one if you know it's Mega Charizard Y, as this helps against both Air Slash and Blast Burn; use Iron Defense for Mega Charizard X. If you don't know what forme it is, Moonlight is a safe play, as it is helpful against all but Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X. For Dragonite, just use Iron Defense, as Necrozma beats special Dragonite most of the time anyway; on the other hand, if you don't use Iron Defense, Necrozma will lose to Dragon Dance. After Iron Defense, you can usually safely boost up, since Iapapa Berry will let Necrozma recover after two attacks. Against Pokemon that do more than 60 damage but still less than 75% of Necrozma's health, you can use Moonlight turn 1 and then use a boosting move; Iapapa Berry will be able to activate and you can successfully stall out the opponent from there.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fighting-types like Kommo-o and Terrakion complement stall Necrozma well, dealing with Dark-type threats like Mega Gyarados and Incineroar that beat it. In return, Necrozma covers common weaknesses for the other two like Dragonite and Magearna. Powerful Bug-types like Durant and Genesect can beat Dark-types as well, in addition to key Taunt users like Kee Berry Mew and Tapu Bulu. In exchange, Necrozma deals with many physical attackers that the former struggle with like Dragonite, Donphan, and Mega Swampert. Garchomp makes a great partner, beating Mega Charizard X and Incineroar while Necrozma handles both Dragonite and Landorus-T.</p> "

It grants Magearna great resistances for defensive purposes, allowing it to sponge hits from popular Dragon- and Fairy-type Pokemon. Magearna's typing is also great offensively, as it can hit opposing Fighting-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type Pokemon super effectively. Magearna also has stats that complement its typing, making it easier to survive hits and deal damage. Magearna is blessed with a powerful signature move in Fleur Cannon, which, when paired with Fairium Z, can OHKO a good portion of the metagame, and its movepool has other great options such as Calm Mind, Iron Defense, and plenty of coverage moves like Ice Beam and Energy Ball. However, its ability, Soul-Heart, is useless in the 1v1 metagame. Additionally, Magearna is weak to common Fire- and Ground-type attacks, which are some of the most popular in the metagame.

Magearna can also utilize two other sets to lure in and beat Ground-types; the first is an Air Balloon set with an EV spread of 232 HP / 240 SpA / 26 SpD and a Modest nature, while the second is a Shuca Berry set with an EV spread of 100 HP / 132 Def / 60 SpA / 216 Spe and a Modest nature. The Air Balloon set's EVs allow Magearna to hit harder and secure more OHKOs than the Shuca Berry set, such as against Gyarados with Thunderbolt and Naganadel with Fleur Cannon, but this set mandates the use of Magnet Rise. On the other hand, the Shuca Berry set's defensive investment lets Magearna hits, and the set doesn't require Magearna to run Magnet Rise, but it doesn't hit as hard. Ice Beam is mandatory on both sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Ground- and Fire-type Pokemon: Faster Ground- and Fire-type Pokemon such as Charizard, Heatran, and Zygarde-C can easily OHKO Magearna with a STAB move before it can set up Iron Defense or Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon with Stat-lowering Moves: Some Steel-type Pokemon such as Magnezone and Aegislash resists Magearna's attacks and can utilize Metal Sound to drop Magearna's Special Defense and OHKO it with Gigavolt Havoc or Never-Ending Nightmare respectively. Some other Steel-types can beat it if they run specific moves such as Mega Metagross with Laser Focus.</p> <p><strong>Deoxys-S and Jumpluff: Both of these Pokemon run a stall strategy that can beat Magearna. Deoxys-S utilizes Amnesia PP stall, which allows it to survive a Twinkle Tackle. Jumpluff beats Magearna with Sleep Powder and Leech Seed, as Magearna doesn't have a way to recover HP after Jumpluff sets up a Substitute.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fleur Cannon is Magearna's strongest STAB move, and it is all Magearna needs to nail important Pokemon. Iron Defense boosts Magearna's Defense, making it able to defeat physical attackers such as Mega Gyarados, Donphan, and Golem, which would otherwise easily OHKO or 2HKO it. Calm Mind boosts Magearna's Special Defense and Special Attack, which allows it to muscle through specially bulky Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Tapu Fini, and Porygon-Z after a Z-Conversion. Pain Split allows Magearna to chip away at the foe while avoiding the OHKO against Golem and Donphan after an Iron Defense. It also allows Magearna to replenish its health against Pokemon that are bulky enough to bring Magearna's health down such as Mega Metagross. It also helps Magearna defeat stall Pokemon such as Chansey.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Fairium Z turns Fleur Cannon into a powerful Twinkle Tackle, which allows it to fire off a powerful attack without the Special Attack drop. 212 Speed EVs allow Magearna to outspeed Donphan, while the HP EVs and a Bold nature allow Magearna to survive a Tectonic Rage followed by Earthquake from Golem and Donphan after an Iron Defense boost. 48 Special Defense EV's Magearna to take Choice Specs Naganadel's Fire Blast.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The correct way to use Magearna depends on the foe; for example, if Magearna is up against Sturdy Pokemon like Donphan, Golem, Crustle, or Sawk, it must use Iron Defense, Pain Split, and Twinkle Tackle, in that order. This move sequence allows Magearna to tank at least two hits and recover its health in order to survive another hit. Simultaneously, Magearna breaks Sturdy, which allows it to finish off the foe with Twinkle Tackle. If you are up against Dragonite, Magearna must use Iron Defense and then Pain Split to break Multiscale and heal off the damage; then, Magearna must use Twinkle Tackle to OHKO Dragonite and win the matchup. However, be wary that Choice Band Dragonite can easily defeat Magearna.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Magearna's main drawback is that Ground- and Fire-type Pokemon such as Zygarde-C, Garchomp, and Charizard can easily defeat it, which means that bulky Water-type Pokemon like Primarina and Mega Gyarados are generally appreciated teammates. In addition, some stall tactics such as Substitute + Leech Seed from Jumpluff and PP stalling from Deoxys-S defeat Magearna, so having Pokemon that beat them such as Hoopa-U and Buginium Z Crustle with Rock Blast is a good option. Furthermore, some Steel-types such as Metal Sound Aegislash and Magnezone give Magearna trouble, especially if they use stat-lowering moves, making Mega Charizard X a great partner for Magearna.</p> "

  "Naganadel": {
    "overview": "<p>Naganadel's Speed, Special Attack, and access to powerful STAB moves like Draco Meteor and Sludge Wave allow it to outspeed and OHKO many Dragon-, Grass-, and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Zygarde-C, Kommo-o, non-Choice Scarf or specially defensive Tapu Lele, Tapu Fini, and Jumpluff, as well as Normalium Z or Choice Specs Porygon-Z and non-Choice Scarf Garchomp. Furthermore, a strong coverage move in Fire Blast lets it hit Steel-type Pokemon that resist its STAB attacks for super effective damage. However, Naganadel has rather low defensive stats, making it very weak to opposing Pokemon that can outspeed or tank a hit and retaliate with either super effective attacks like Outrage and Earthquake from Mega Gyarados or powerful STAB moves like Giga Impact from Mega Lopunny, and Ice Beam from Greninja. Naganadel's shallow movepool leaves it with only Draco Meteor, Sludge Wave, and Fire Blast as clear options for moves without many choices for a fourth, making it a very linear Pokemon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragonium Z is an option for Naganadel, allowing it to boost the power of Draco Meteor to the same level of running Choice Specs once while also allowing Naganadel to use Nasty Plot and break Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro and Sableye. Dragonium Z's flaw is that it makes Naganadel unable to deal with Pokemon like Mega Gardevoir and Tapu Lele. Poisonium Z also allows Naganadel to break through similar special walls and deal with Fairy-type Pokemon like Mega Gardevoir and Tapu Lele, but Naganadel loses out on other matchups such as against specially defensive Zygarde, Mega Mawile, and Landorus-T that Choice Specs and Dragonium Z would otherwise allow it to win. Modest Choice Scarf is another option for Naganadel, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon such as Greninja and other Choice Scarf users like Jirachi. Firium Z is another possible item for Naganadel, boosting Fire Blast's damage. This allows Naganadel to guarantee a KO against non-heavy Special Defense-invested Steel-type Pokemon like Mega Metagross and Magearna. Air Slash is an alternative option to Hidden Power Rock, covering Pokemon like Mega Heracross. Signal Beam is also an option to cover Hoopa-U.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Offense: Offensive Pokemon that invest in their special bulk such as Magearna, Mega Metagross, Mega Gyarados, Meloetta, and Dragonite can tank a hit from Naganadel and KO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Pokemon: Sturdy Pokemon like Crustle, Donphan, and Golem are guaranteed to survive a hit from Naganadel and then KO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Naganadel struggles to break through special walls like Type: Null, Chansey, and Porygon2, unless it has Nasty Plot.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: While Naganadel is fast, it is not the fastest Pokemon in the tier. Its meager defenses allow it to be reliably eliminated by faster Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Greninja, Zeraora, and Choice Scarf Pokemon like Excadrill and Haxorus. However, Choice Scarf Naganadel can lure these Pokemon in and proceed to KO them.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Naganadel’s hardest-hitting STAB move that should be used when the rest of  Naganadel's moves aren't super effective, such as against Porygon-Z or Landorus-T, and on other Dragon-types, like Zygarde-C and Kommo-o. Sludge Wave is best used against opposing Fairy- and Grass-types such as Tapu Lele, Serperior, and Jumpluff. Fire Blast is Naganadel’s hardest-hitting coverage move that is best used against Steel-types such as Genesect, Kartana, offensive Magearna, and Mega Metagross. Hidden Power Rock is used to better Naganadel's matchup versus both Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y, allowing Naganadel to OHKO Mega Charizard Y and OHKO specially defensive Mega Charizard X should it opt to not Mega Evolve. Thunderbolt can be run with a Modest nature in order to consistently 2HKO Mega Slowbro.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment paired with a Timid nature allows Naganadel to outspeed as much as possible, most notably base 110 Speed Pokemon like Jumpluff. Modest can also be run in order to improve rolls against Pokemon like Magearna and Mega Mawile, in exchange for the Jumpluff and Mega Lucario matchup. Maximum Special Attack investment allows Naganadel to hit as hard as it can while still retaining maximum Speed by nature. 4 Special Defense EVs cause Choice Scarf Genesect's Download to boost Attack instead of Special Attack, which is crucial when Naganadel is against it.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Naganadel is best used against Pokemon with fairly low Special Defense like Normalium Z Porygon-Z or Pokemon that it can hit super effectively like Zygarde and Genesect. Naganadel does not survive many hits, so it struggles to deal with Pokemon that are faster than it like Mega Lopunny and Greninja. Naganadel also struggles with specially defensive walls that it fails to OHKO like Chansey and Meloetta. Naganadel cannot deal with Pokemon with the ability Sturdy like Donphan and Crustle, as they will always survive its moves from full health and can retaliate to KO. If you think an opposing Charizard will Mega Evolve, Naganadel should use Draco Meteor instead of Hidden Power Rock. Otherwise, Naganadel should use Hidden Power Rock against Charizard the rest of the time.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Naganadel synergizes well with Ground-type Pokemon like Bulldoze Donphan and Landorus-T due to their ability to break Steel-types that Naganadel struggles with, like bulky Magearna, and take down Mega Lopunny, which can outspeed and OHKO Naganadel. Naganadel also covers many of Donphan and Landorus-T's counters like Jumpluff, Primarina, and Tapu Lele in return. Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Incineroar similarly are great teammates thanks to their ability to defeat Steel-type Pokemon Naganadel can't beat such as Jirachi and Aegislash. A bulky Mega Charizard Y can beat Greninja and Lopunny as well, which Naganadel struggles with. Naganadel has difficulties with Pokemon that run Sturdy, namely Donphan and Golem, so another good teammate would be Mega Gyarados thanks to its access to Mold Breaker. In return, Naganadel helps to deal with Fairy- and Grass-types that Gyarados struggles with, such as Tapu Fini and Jumpluff. Physical attackers like Sawk and Mega Medicham are also good teammates for Naganadel, as they are able to break specially defensive Pokemon that Naganadel can't deal with like Chansey and Hoopa-U.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Zeraora's incredibly high Speed and access to moves like Fake Out, Bulk Up, Charge, Outrage, Thunder, and its signature move Plasma Fists allow it to win matchups against Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados, Tapu Fini, Mega Charizard Y, non-Choice Scarf Greninja, and Mega Charizard X. Additionally, Zeraora is the most viable fast Electric-type in the 1v1 metagame, blessed with a lack of competition and a unique niche. Furthermore, despite Zeraora's blistering speed, its bulk is not horrible and is complemented by a decent defensive typing, with pure Electric-types having only a sole weakness in Ground, and access to Bulk Up and Charge to boost either defense. Because of Zeraora's large set of viable moves, it has many other options that it can use to fit its team; it can also get a lot of power by holding an Electrium Z and powering up its Plasma Fists or Thunder into Gigavolt Havoc, which can be further increased in damage by Bulk Up or Charge. Furthermore, Plasma Fists in combination with Zeraora's ability Volt Absorb grants it an immunity to Normal-type attacks from slower Pokemon such as Normalium Z Meloetta. However, its unboosted Attack and Special Attack are not stellar, and Zeraora loses to threats such as Mega Venusaur, Tapu Bulu, and Zygarde because of its only passable offenses and mediocre defenses.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>192 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature can be run to beat Mega Lopunny at the cost of some damage rolls if the team requires Zeraora to deal with this rather important threat. Additionally, an Adamant nature can be run to further boost damage to increase chances in damage rolls. Taunt can be used in order to beat stall Pokemon such as Type: Null and Mega Audino. However, this will sacrifice matchups against Dragon-types such as Mega Charizard X and Haxorus. A Life Orb set with attacks like Plasma Fists, Outrage, Grass Knot, Close Combat, and Fake Out allows Zeraora to beat Pokemon such as Donphan and Golem while retaining the Mega Charizard X matchup and beating all but the most physically bulky Dragonite. However, this has a large drawback in not being able to beat Mega Gyarados reliably. A Choice Band set with moves such as Plasma Fists, Outrage, Close Combat, Fire Punch, and Iron Tail allows Zeraora to bring an additional physical coverage move over Life Orb, because of the absence of Fake Out, and beat Kommo-o more reliably, with Iron Tail beating Fairy-types such as Gardevoir, most Tapu Lele, and Clefable. However, this set also has struggles with Mega Gyarados. Dragonium Z can be run to guarantee a win against Dragon-types like Kommo-o, Dragonite, and Mega Charizard X and Y while simultaneously greatly assisting against opposing Zeraora.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Bulky Ground-types like Zygarde and Donphan shrug off Outrage and in return OHKO Zeraora with super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Choice Scarf users or faster Pokemon such as Timid Choice Scarf Porygon-Z and Pheromosa will simply outspeed and OHKO Zeraora because of its mediocre bulk.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Offense: Bulky hard-hitting Pokemon not hit super effectively such as Mega Mawile, Mega Tyranitar, and Aegislash will take Zeraora's hit and proceed to KO Zeraora with a strong attack.</p> <p><strong>Stall: Pokemon such as Whimsicott and Umbreon will just outstall Zeraora while wearing it down. Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn do this especially well thanks to their Electric resistance.</p> <p><strong>Trace: Gardevoir will Trace Zeraora's Volt Absorb to be immune to Plasma Fists and Thunder while also not being affected by Outrage because of its Fairy typing, leaving Zeraora with no way of dealing damage.

Outrage is mainly for Dragon-types such as Mega Charizard X, Haxorus, and Naganadel, but it can be used to hit many foes that don't resist it because of the inherent synergy between Electric- and Dragon-type moves. Bulk Up is both to boost Zeraora's damage output and reduce damage taken from physical attacks. The most specific attack it helps Zeraora take is Mega Charizard X's Dragon Dance-boosted Outrage, but it can also help with slower Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados. Fake Out is not only a little bit of practically free damage to secure what would normally be damage rolls, but it also potentially scouts Charizard's Mega Evolution and breaks non-Ground-type Sturdy Pokemon like Carracosta and Sawk. It can also break Dragonite's Multiscale, allowing Zeraora to win against non-Dragonium Z variants. Charge doubles Gigavolt Havoc's damage and helps against special attackers because of the extra Special Defense it provides. Offensive Mew, Heatran, and Genesect require both the Special Defense increase from Charge as well as a boosted Gigavolt Havoc in order to be beaten.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>48 HP and 120 Defense EVs allow Zeraora to survive a Jolly Mega Charizard X's Outrage. 88 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature let it outspeed non-Choice Scarf Greninja. 252 Attack EVs help it hit as hard as possible to prevent unnecessary damage rolls against foes such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Charizard X.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Keep in mind that against Dragonite, it is better to use Gigavolt Havoc rather than Outrage after using Fake Out and Bulk Up. However, Zeraora will lose to Dragonium Z Dragonite. Do remember to predict whether the opponent has a Mega Charizard X or Mega Charizard Y, because against Mega Charizard X, Zeraora will have to use Bulk Up, while if it is Mega Charizard Y, Zeraora will need to use Gigavolt Havoc. Using Fake Out can ease this prediction, if they Mega Evolve turn one, but some may choose to avoid this, if they predict Fake Out. Zeraora should be sent out against the aforementioned Flying- and Water-types, certain Dragon-types such as Haxorus and Mega Charizard X, and Pokemon without a way to effectively hit it like Magnezone and Normalium Z Meloetta. Fake Out should be used against practically everything except Tapu Lele and Mew; Tapu Lele will simply block it with Psychic Terrain, and Mew might get a Defense boost from Kee Berry, removing almost all chances of victory.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini, Primarina, and Mega Slowbro can beat Ground-types such as Donphan, Zygarde, and Landorus-T as well as Dragonium Z Dragonite. In return, Zeraora will help beat Pokemon that threaten them such as opposing Tapu Fini, Mega Charizard Y, and Magnezone. Bulky offense Pokemon like Dragonite, Magearna, and Mega Swampert can tank attacks from hyper offense Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Garchomp, and Pheromosa. In return, Zeraora will shut down wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard X and Y, Carracosta, and Tapu Fini. Wallbreaking Pokemon like Aegislash, Victini, and Hoopa-U can break through Pokemon that are too bulky for Zeraora to handle such as Mega Mawile, Mega Venusaur, bulky Tapu Lele, and Magearna; in return, Zeraora will help beat faster or harder-hitting Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Gyarados, and Volcarona.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Plasma Fists should be used against Pokemon with lower Defense than Special Defense, such as a Magearna that has used Calm Mind. Conversely, Thunder should be used against Pokemon with lower Special Defense than Defense, such as a Magearna that has used Iron Defense. Charge allows Zeraora to beat Tapu Lele, Magearna, Mew, and other special attackers with its Special Defense boost in addition to its doubling of the following turn's Gigavolt Havoc damage. Fake Out is needed to help any potential damage rolls such as against Mega Gyarados. As this set does not have very heavy investment in either offense, it needs the extra damage from Fake Out to ensure wins. It also breaks Sturdy from Pokemon like Carracosta, Crustle, and Sawk.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>60 Attack EVs guarantee an OHKO on Fairium Z Magearna after a Charge boost even when Magearna uses Calm Mind. 168 Special Attack EVs ensure an OHKO after Fake Out on bulky Mega Gyarados. 128 Special Defense EVs allows Zeraora to always survive bulky Tapu Lele's Shattered Psyche after a Charge boost. Finally, 152 Speed EVs let Zeraora outspeed Mega Gengar and other base 130 Speed Pokemon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because Charge boosts the damage of both Zeraora's STAB moves, it is effective against Pokemon that can boost either defense like the aforementioned Magearna and Tapu Lele. Always target the weaker effective defense; for example, even though Mega Gyarados's base Special Defense is higher than its Defense, because of Gyarados's Intimidate, Zeraora should use Gigavolt Havoc from Thunder. Remember to not use Fake Out against Mew or Tapu Lele, because Mew rather commonly holds Kee Berry, and Tapu Lele will simply block it with Psychic Terrain; use Charge instead. Keep in mind that if the Tapu Lele is an offensive set rather than the more common bulky variant, Zeraora will need to use Electrium Z-boosted Plasma Fists immediately. It also beats almost all Sableye sets, with even the most physically bulky having a 50% chance to be OHKOed by a Charge-boosted Gigavolt Havoc from Plasma Fists. Some stall Pokemon like Type: Null and Whimsicott cannot be defeated by mixed Zeraora, for it just does not do enough damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Physically bulky special attackers like Genesect, Primarina, and Mega Slowbro can beat Ground-types such as Donphan, Zygarde, and Landorus-T.

Wallbreakers of your own like Aegislash, Victini, and Hoopa-U can break through Pokemon that are too bulky for Zeraora to handle such as Mega Mawile, Mega Metagross, and Mega Venusaur, while Zeraora will help them beat faster or harder-hitting Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados and Volcarona. Mixed Zeraora will need versatile Water-type teammates like Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Greninja to beat Dragon-types like Mega Charizard X, Zygarde, Haxorus, and Dragonite. Keep in mind that Choice Scarf Haxorus will beat Greninja, and physical Flyinium Z Dragonite will usually beat Primarina and Tapu Fini.
