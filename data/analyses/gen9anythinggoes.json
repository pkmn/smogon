        "description": "<p>Ho-Oh is one of the best wallbreakers in the metagame thanks to its high Attack stat, powerful STAB moves, incredible longevity provided by Regenerator, and amazing typing. The prominence of Koraidon and its sun makes Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire incredibly powerful, always OHKOing offensive Necrozma-DM and Calyrex-S with one layer of Spikes, always 2HKOing Arceus, and greatly limiting the capacity of Ting-Lu to switch in while having very high odds of burning switch-ins that aren't Fire-type, such as Eternatus and Arceus-Water. Brave Bird is only resisted by a few Pokemon, like Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Miraidon, which are all threatened by Ho-Oh's other moves. Earthquake is mainly used as a way to hit Miraidon super effectively, but it also 2HKOes Eternatus without recoil. Alternatively, Substitute can be used to break through more passive teams, since it lets Ho-Oh take advantage of bulky staples like Gliscor, which is unable to break its Substitute. Notably, Substitute Ho-Oh should always be Tera Flying to maximize its ability to break stall teams. Imprison can also be used to beat opposing Ho-Oh by blocking its recovery and damaging moves, and it enables Ho-Oh to break support Arceus formes that can't hit it super effectively by blocking Recover. Whirlwind can also be used to block setup attempts by Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy or Arceus-Ground, which could otherwise use Ho-Oh as setup fodder. Tera Ground allows Ho-Oh to turn the tables on Miraidon and OHKO it with Earthquake, increase the damage it deals to Eternatus, and 2HKO offensive Tera Fire Arceus-Ground without getting OHKOed by Stone Edge. However, it leaves Ho-Oh weak to Calyrex-S's Grass Knot. Tera Fairy is helpful as a way to deny Dragon-type moves from Koraidon while still surviving any move from Miraidon, although it stops Ho-Oh from checking Necrozma-DM and removes its resistance to and immunity to burn from opposing Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire and Koraidon's Flare Blitz. Tera Flying further bolsters the power of Brave Bird, allowing it to OHKO Calyrex-S, 2HKO bulky Arceus, and 2HKO Ting-Lu with one layer of Spikes. The given EVs are to ensure Ho-Oh outspeeds opposing defensive Ho-Oh, Gliscor, and bulky Necrozma-DM while maximizing its Attack and bulk.</p> <p>Offensive Ho-Oh fits best on balance and bulky offense teams, which greatly benefit from its wallbreaking and high staying power due to Regenerator. Calyrex-S and Miraidon appreciate Ho-Oh taking on opposing Ting-Lu, which can check both of them. Choice Scarf Koraidon also benefits from offensive Ho-Oh switching in freely against most of its checks, such as defensive Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Fairy, and Landorus-T, and it can easily pivot Ho-Oh in with U-turn, also providing sun to bolster Sacred Fire's power. Offensive Ho-Oh appreciates Ting-Lu a lot thanks to its ability to check Miraidon—which would otherwise OHKO Ho-Oh with Electro Drift—and Calyrex-S. Entry hazard setters like Eternatus, Ting-Lu, Arceus-Ground, and Landorus-T are perfect partners, as they enhance Ho-Oh's wallbreaking power with the chip damage provided by hazards. Ho-Oh also greatly values partners that can help check Koraidon, like Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Water; the last also checks Necrozma-DM, which can be threatening for Ho-Oh if it's carrying Stone Edge. Offensive Ho-Oh struggles against Calyrex-S; therefore, partners that can check it like Ting-Lu and Arceus are appreciated.</p>"

  "Kyogre": {
    "overview": "<p>Kyogre sets itself apart as a wallbreaker in the Anything Goes metagame by virtue of its formidable bulk and superb raw power. Drizzle extends Kyogre's damage potential to impressive heights, which severely limits the amount of Pokemon willing to switch in on its Water-type attacks. Kyogre matches up positively against the majority of the tier's defensive threats, including staples like Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, Ting-Lu, and Arceus-Ground. However, Kyogre may struggle against bulky Dragon-types such as Eternatus, Koraidon, Miraidon, and Giratina-O, which can discourage the use of Kyogre’s STAB moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leftovers variants of Kyogre may use an alternative EV spread of 240 HP / 252 Def / 16 Spe and a Bold nature. While this limits Kyogre's firepower, it improves its ability to check Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, Koraidon, and physical Arceus-Ground. On these sets, Protect may be favored over Thunder in order to scout Choice item users and recover with Leftovers. Water Spout can be used in place of Thunder to deal high damage to switch-ins while being more accurate than Origin Pulse. Surf may also seem appealing as an accurate Water-type STAB option. However, it is considerably less powerful than Origin Pulse. All Kyogre sets can reasonably opt for Tera Poison as a niche option, as it grants an immunity to Eternatus's Toxic and the ability to remove its Toxic Spikes. Furthermore, it provides a valuable resistance to Calyrex-S's Grass Knot, which is otherwise super effective. Another Tera type option is Electric, which provides relevant resistances to Miraidon's Electro Drift, Ho-Oh's Brave Bird, and opposing Kyogre's Thunder.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Eternatus</strong>: Eternatus can reliably switch in on Kyogre's attacks and threaten it with Toxic. Additionally, it can take advantage of Kyogre to set Toxic Spikes. Eternatus has access to reliable recovery, which prevents Kyogre from wearing it down. Thunder Wave variants of Kyogre can cripple Eternatus, however, and Choice Specs variants can 2HKO it with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Koraidon</strong>: Due to Orichalcum Pulse activating sun, Koraidon is able to switch in comfortably on Kyogre's Water-type attacks and 2HKO it with Low Kick. Furthermore, Koraidon can pivot out with U-turn safely, as Kyogre is significantly weakened by sun. Kyogre can deal significant damage to Koraidon on a predicted switch by using Ice Beam, with Choice Specs variants achieving an OHKO. Additionally, Thunder Wave may allow Kyogre to outspeed non-Choice Scarf variants of Koraidon. Choice Scarf Koraidon is also incapacitated by paralysis, as its revenge killing capabilities become severely impaired.</p> <p><strong>Miraidon</strong>: Miraidon outspeeds Kyogre and is able to OHKO it with Electro Drift. Because Miraidon is such a threatening wallbreaker in its own right, it forces Kyogre to be played carefully. Though Miraidon resists Water, it cannot switch in on Kyogre's Water-type attacks repeatedly, as they deal heavy chip damage.</p>",

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to maximize longevity by use of Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers in addition to heavy HP investment. Kyogre's exceedingly strong Origin Pulse in tandem with Drizzle allows it to pose a major threat to defensive cores. Ice Beam is a compulsory coverage move, as it allows Kyogre to deal heavy damage to Dragon-types like Eternatus, Koraidon, and Miraidon, which resists Origin Pulse. Thunder improves Kyogre's matchup against opposing Kyogre and Arceus-Water. Kyogre is able to set up using Calm Mind, further bolstering its already impressive Special Attack to break through Eternatus. Finally, Thunder Wave allows Kyogre to pester faster switch-ins such as Eternatus and Koraidon. The given EV spread allows Kyogre to outspeed paralyzed Calyrex-S. Kyogre's choice of item largely depends on a team's interaction with entry hazards. Teams with adequate hazard countermeasures, including Pokemon with Taunt, often opt for Leftovers. Otherwise, Kyogre should use Heavy-Duty Boots. Tera Fairy is Kyogre's Tera Type of choice, as it greatly improves Kyogre's matchup against Koraidon.</p> <p>Offensive Kyogre excels on bulky offense teams, as it is able to keep pressure on many of the metagame's defensive threats. Kyogre’s notable bulk allows it to take hits from more passive Pokemon such as support Arceus formes and Ting-Lu. Bulky offense teams also appreciate its ability to soft check major threats in Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Ground, and Ho-Oh. Drizzle can deactivate Koraidon's Orichalcum Pulse, making it significantly easier to handle. Kyogre synergizes very well with pivots like Koraidon, Miraidon, and Landorus-T, which give it ample opportunity to face defensive Pokemon. Eternatus is a good teammate for Leftovers Kyogre, as it absorbs Toxic Spikes. Steel-type Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C can shut down Kyogre’s main check in Eternatus.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Kyogre trades longevity for more immediate damage, increasing its breaking power. Origin Pulse is inaccurate but is Kyogre's best move after Water Spout is weakened. Ice Beam allows Kyogre to threaten Dragon-types like Koraidon, Miraidon, and Eternatus, preventing them from being reliable switch-ins and notably OHKOing Koraidon after one spike layer of Spikes. Thunder allows Kyogre to hit bulky Water-types, such as opposing Kyogre, Arceus-Water, and Tera Water Arceus-Fairy. Tera Water boosts Kyogre's Water-type attacks to an absurd level, allowing it to OHKO Miraidon with Water Spout on the switch and at worst 2HKO every common defensive Pokemon in rain. Alternatively, Tera Fairy makes Kyogre immune to Dragon-type attacks and lets it survive a Low Kick from Koraidon even after some chip damage. Tera Ghost is an alternative option that similarly deals with Low Kick while also adding an immunity to Extreme Speed, which allows Kyogre to take on even boosted Arceus. 252 EVs in Speed with a Timid nature lets Kyogre outspeed most defensive Arceus formes, whereas Modest can be used for more damage output, enabling Ice Beam to OHKO Koraidon.</p> <p>Since Choice Specs Kyogre is easily chipped down by entry hazards, it often finds itself on faster-paced teams that appreciate its ability to quickly force progress. Koraidon, Miraidon, Calyrex-S, and offensive Arceus-Fairy make excellent teammates, since they appreciate Kyogre's ability to OHKO most of their checks. Since Kyogre is very slow, it appreciates speed control options such as Choice Scarf Koraidon and Calyrex-S as well as Arceus, which can clean up late-game. Kyogre also benefits from Sticky Web, as it allows it to outspeed threats such as Loaded Dice Koraidon, Life Orb Miraidon, and Zacian-C, making Kyogre much more difficult to answer. Bulky Ground-types like Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, Arceus-Ground, and Landorus-T are also great teammates, since they switch into Miraidon's Electric-type attacks well. Landorus-T in particular can also switch into and chip Koraidon with Rocky Helmet and pivot Kyogre in against the defensive Pokemon that often switch into it, such as defensive Arceus formes, Ho-Oh, and opposing Landorus-T. Other pivots such as Choice Scarf Koraidon and Miraidon also make excellent partners, as they can help bring Kyogre onto the field.</p>"

Access to moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Spikes differentiate it from Landorus-T. Will-O-Wisp allows Groudon to cripple Pokemon that switch into it such as Koraidon and physical variants of Arceus-Ground. Roar is used to phaze foes such as Swords Dance Zacian-C, Swords Dance Koraidon, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Arceus-Ground that may try to set up on it while also racking up chip damage from entry hazards. Protect is an alternative move that can be used to scout moves from the likes of Choice Specs Miraidon and Kyogre and Choice Scarf Koraidon as well as maximize Leftovers recovery. Tera Water allows Groudon to resist Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C, Flare Blitz from Koraidon, and Water Spout and Ice Beam from Kyogre, whereas Tera Fairy makes it immune or resistant to Scale Shot and Low Kick from Koraidon and Draco Meteor from Miraidon. Offensive teammates that benefit from the hazards set up by Groudon such as Calyrex-S, Calm Mind Arceus formes, Miraidon, Koraidon, Zacian-C, and Extreme Killer Arceus are appreciated. As Groudon lacks recovery, revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Koraidon and other physical walls with access to recovery such as defensive Arceus formes are mandatory partners. As Groudon is unable to check special attackers such as Calyrex-S, Miraidon, and Kyogre, checks to them such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire are appreciated; they can set up hazards as well to form a hazard stacking core with it.</p>"

The fast Taunt and entry hazards Deoxys-S provides enable many powerful setup sweepers like Koraidon and Miraidon to break through their usual checks. However, Deoxys-S is quite one dimensional, as it is cramped for moves if it wants to beat some of its many counterleads; for example, it needs Knock Off to threaten Calyrex-S and Psycho Boost to threaten Scale Shot Koraidon. Although it is often considered to be the most reliable suicide lead in the tier, it doesn't match up well against many other hyper offense leads such as Ribombee, Glimmora, and the occasional Grimmsnarl, so teammates like Necrozma-DM are appreciated.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Skill Swap can be used to beat Magic Bounce Hatterene, but Hatterene is very rare, and Skill Swap has limited uses in other matchups. Tera Dark can be used to beat Grimmsnarl leads, but this is quite situational, and it loses out on the Extreme Killer Arceus matchup. Rocky Helmet with a bulkier EV spread of 252 HP / 192 Def / 16 SpD / 52 Spe can be used to possibly set multiple layers of entry hazards more reliably and beat Focus Sash leads, but it leaves Deoxys-S vulnerable to Choice Scarf Calyrex-S. Counter can be used alongside the aforementioned bulky EV spread to punish U-turn from Choice Scarf Koraidon but has limited other uses.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ribombee</strong>: Ribombee can lower Deoxys-S's Speed with Pounce and follow up by KOing it with Bug Buzz.</p> <p><strong>Calyrex-S</strong>: With its powerful Astral Barrage, Calyrex-S can KO non-Knock Off Deoxys-S and gain a Special Attack boost as a result, which makes it harder to respond to, as hyper offense teams usually do not have any Choice Scarf users.</p> <p><strong>Grimmsnarl</strong>: Deoxys-S cannot deal any meaningful damage to Grimmsnarl, which can use Taunt before Deoxys-S can set entry hazards.

Knock Off can take out any unsuspecting Calyrex-S, while Stealth Rock can be used if Deoxys-S can survive for multiple turns to set it in addition to Spikes and should be used with an EV spread of 80 HP / 176 SpA / 252 Spe and a Timid nature.

Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave both debilitate physical attackers, but Will-O-Wisp chips away at walls and affects Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground, while Thunder Wave additionally impairs special attackers such as Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy. Poltergeist breaks Arceus-Ground's Substitute, which would otherwise block Will-O-Wisp and Dragon Tail, in one hit; alternatively, running Hex lets Giratina-O hit statused walls harder and makes burn affect it much less. Dragon Tail quickly racks up entry hazard damage on the opposing team and prevents foes from continuously setting up against Giratina-O, which is especially useful against Taunt users. The given EV spread lets Giratina take unboosted Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage and outspeed Taunt Landorus-T. Tera Steel makes Giratina-O immune to poison from foes such as Toxapex and gives it a resistance to moves like Arceus-Fairy's Judgment, Zacian-C's Play Rough and Behemoth Blade, Koraidon's Scale Shot, and Arceus-Ground's Dragon Claw and Ice Beam. Tera Poison similarly removes Giratina-O's Dragon weakness and provides it with an immunity to Toxic and a resistance to Fairy, but it doesn't make Giratina-O weak to Koraidon's Low Kick. Defensive Giratina-O fits best on balance teams that otherwise have trouble dealing with Ground-types such as Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground or need the increased longevity Defog provides. Toxapex and Skeledirge handle Pokemon like Zacian-C and Koraidon for Giratina-O; in return, it handles Ground-types and helps check Arceus. Giratina-O appreciates Ting-Lu and Arceus checking Calyrex-S for it; Ting-Lu also checks Miraidon and helps check Calm Mind Arceus-Ground. Calyrex-S likes Giratina-O being able to deal with its two main switch-ins, Arceus and Ting-Lu, by checking the former and removing the latter's Spikes. Because it lacks recovery, Giratina-O can get overwhelmed by the Pokemon it checks when facing hyper offense teams, so it appreciates revenge killers such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Choice Scarf Koraidon.</p>"

Shadow Claw allows it to hit Calyrex-S, Tera Ghost Koraidon, and Giratina-O. Recover allows Arceus to set up on Pokemon such as other Arceus lacking Bulk Up, Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground, various defensive Arceus formes lacking Will-O-Wisp, and Koraidon after Terastallizing. Tera Fire gives Arceus a burn immunity, which lets it set up on Pokemon that would otherwise check it, such as support Arceus formes with Will-O-Wisp and non-Whirlwind Ho-Oh. It also grants a resistance to Koraidon's Flare Blitz and Calyrex-S's Grass Knot at the cost at the cost of Arceus's immunity to Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage. Arceus's Special Defense and HP EVs allow it to survive a +2 Tera Grass Calyrex-S Grass Knot or a +2 Tera Stellar Psychic from the same foe. Its Speed creeps it above fully invested, neutral-natured base 90 Pokemon such as Kyogre and Ho-Oh.</p> <p>Bulk Up Arceus applies offensive pressure on Pokemon such as Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Water, and defensive Ho-Oh, forcing them to stay at high enough HP to successfully stop a sweep. Its longevity relative to regular Extreme Killer Arceus makes it much more prominent on bulkier balance and bulky offense teams, where it frequently acts as a great Calyrex-S check and often threatens to sweep once the opponent's defensive Arceus formes and Ho-Oh are worn down. Bulk Up Arceus struggles with special wallbreakers, like Miraidon and Kyogre, as it can't OHKO them without multiple boosts, allowing them to force out or heavily damage it. Thus, Eternatus is a great partner for Bulk Up Arceus, leveraging its Water resistance to be one of the best Kyogre switch-ins, as well as spreading poison with Toxic Spikes and Toxic. Ting-Lu, being balance's best and only Miraidon check, is also a great partner to Bulk Up Arceus due to its Electric immunity and great Special Defense. Before Terastallizing, Arceus is also weak to Koraidon's Low Kick and burn inflicted by defensive Arceus formes, Ho-Oh, and Giratina-O. Arceus-Fairy is a great burn absorber, can force out Ho-Oh with Power Gem, acts as a great Koraidon switch-in, and easily spreads paralysis with Thunder Wave to make it easier for Arceus to set up. Arceus-Water is also a great switch-in to Ho-Oh, leveraging its Fire resistance and threatening it out with Judgment. It also helps slow down Zacian-C, using its Water typing to resist Behemoth Blade and threatening Zacian-C with Will-O-Wisp but at the cost of letting opposing Koraidon use Low Kick more freely than Arceus-Fairy. Bulk Up Arceus is a deadweight against stall due to Dondozo, Skeledirge, Skarmory, and Garganacl walling it effectively. Thus, it appreciates stallbreaking teammates, such as Miraidon and Calyrex-S, which also assist in breaking Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Water. Zacian-C also proves to be a challenge for Bulk Up Arceus to break on its own, so it usually relies on teammates such as Ho-Oh or the aforementioned Arceus-Water to force Zacian-C to switch out and slowly chip it with entry hazard damage. Choice Scarf Koraidon is also a great offensive check to Zacian-C and Miraidon, threatening OHKOes with Flare Blitz and Outrage, respectively.</p>"

      "Offensive Extreme Killer": {
        "description": "<p>Arceus is one of the most potent setup sweepers and cleaners in the metagame, fitting on a wide variety of teams due to its impressive natural bulk and typing blessing it with a good matchup into Calyrex-S, while its powerful Extreme Speeds are crucial at keeping other attackers like Miraidon, Koraidon, and Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground from running wild. Shadow Claw is critical coverage for its ability to OHKO non-Terastallized Calyrex-S and hit Necrozma-DM and Giratina-O for large amounts of damage. Stone Edge hits Ho-Oh, OHKOing offensive sets unboosted and defensive sets with a boost. Earthquake instead hits Zacian-C—which can otherwise switch into Arceus with relative ease—in addition to OHKOing most Eternatus and hitting Necrozma-DM for higher damage after using Swords Dance. Taunt is an option on more offensive teams that prevents defensive Arceus formes from healing or crippling Arceus with Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave, stifles setup attempts from Pokemon like Bulk Up Arceus and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, and can help break stall teams by shutting down Gliscor and stopping Dondozo from using Rest. Heavy-Duty Boots provides Arceus with more opportunities to set up in the face of Spikes or Toxic Spikes, but hyper offense teams can instead run Mental Herb or Lum Berry to circumvent either Encore Calyrex-S or burn from Ho-Oh and defensive Arceus formes. Tera Normal boosts Extreme Speed's power to the point of it 2HKOing defensive Arceus formes and OHKOing Miraidon and Koraidon after a boost, albeit requiring minor chip damage to KO the latter with consistency. Tera Fire instead grants an immunity to burn; gives resistances to Calyrex-S's Grass Knot and Fairy- and Steel-type attacks from Arceus-Fairy, Zacian-C, and Necrozma-DM; and rids Arceus of its Fighting-type weakness so it can survive Koraidon's Low Kick and Zacian-C's Close Combat. Maximum Speed investment gives an advantage over opposing Extreme Killer Arceus, though lower investment is an option to increase survivability against Calyrex-S.</p> <p>Arceus excels on almost every type of team, (comma) from balance to bulky offense to hyper offense. On balance and bulky offense, Ting-Lu can assist Arceus as a check to Calyrex-S while helping handle Necrozma-DM and providing Spikes that can chip Arceus's checks like Koraidon, Zacian-C, and defensive Arceus formes into KO range of its boosted attacks. On these teams, switch-ins to Koraidon like Arceus-Fairy, Landorus-T, and defensive Arceus-Ground are a necessity, as Koraidon can survive even boosted Extreme Speeds without Tera Normal and frequently runs Tera Ghost to stop Arceus even from critical HP. Arceus pairs well with most offensive threats in the metagame but has particularly nice synergy with Giratina-O and Choice Scarf Calyrex-S, as they can often put foes into lose-lose scenarios where they must use Tera Ghost to avoid Extreme Speed, thus becoming vulnerable to Shadow Sneak or Astral Barrage; the inverse is also true in the case of Tera Normal Calyrex-S. Arceus is an essential member of hyper offense teams, acting as their primary stopgap to Calyrex-S on top of being a potent sweeper and revenge killer. Suicide leads like Deoxys-S and Ribombee can support Arceus and its teammates with Spikes and Sticky Web, respectively. Life Orb Calyrex-S can take advantage of Arceus's switch-ins like defensive Arceus formes and Zacian-C to deal massive damage or even outright sweep, while physical attackers like Koraidon and Zacian-C can overwhelm physical walls to open a path for Arceus to sweep.</p>"

Furthermore, Taunt blocks recovery from defensive Pokemon like support Arceus formes and Dondozo, allowing Arceus-Ground to break through or cripple them for a teammate. Stone Edge allows Arceus-Ground to OHKO Ho-Oh at +1. Tera Fire is used to block Will-O-Wisp, resist Koraidon's Flare Blitz, resist Calyrex-S's Grass Knot, resist both of Zacian-C's STAB moves, and resist Arceus-Fairy's Judgment.

This works the other way around as well, with Koraidon and Zacian-C doing a great deal of damage to defensive Arceus formes and Koraidon knocking support Arceus formes into Earthquake's KO range, potentially enabling a sweep. Arceus-Ground also serves a vital role on hyper offense teams as an Electric-immune Pokemon, which allows it to force out and set up on Miraidon, an otherwise potentially significant threat. Calyrex-S and Arceus-Ground share a common check in Ting-Lu, which they chip into KO range of each other, allowing for one of them to sweep. Arceus and Arceus-Ground also both struggle with Giratina-O, as Giratina-O's Ground and Normal immunity makes it a hard-to-break wall. This can be circumvented by using Arceus to chip Giratina-O with Swords Dance-boosted Shadow Claw, which can allow Arceus-Ground to sweep with Stone Edge without having to fear Dragon Tail or Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

Tera Water resists Fire-type attacks too, resists Kyogre's powerful STAB moves, rids Necrozma-DM of its Ground-type weakness, and maintains its Steel-type resistance, letting it always beat opposing Necrozma-DM and defeat Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground one-on-one once boosted; though, this leaves it floundering against Ho-Oh and Will-O-Wisp Arceus formes. Tera Steel is a niche option on offensive sets with Stone Edge, boosting their power to the stratosphere and potentially letting them 2HKO opposing Necrozma-DM at +2, though they need prior chip damage against defensive Necrozma-DM, and it doesn't provide any defensive utility beyond removing their Ghost-type weakness. The given EV spread lets Necrozma-DM outspeed uninvested base 90 Speed Pokemon, non-Choice Scarf Calyrex-S after two Dragon Dances, and Adamant-natured Choice Scarf Koraidon after using Dragon Dance three times; the remaining EVs are put into Defense and used with an Impish nature to maximize its defensive prowess, allowing for ridiculous feats like letting it survive +1 Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground's Earthquake and stalling out Choice Scarf Koraidon's Flare Blitz due to Moonlight's increased healing in sun. Offensive teams can forgo the additional defensive investment for an offensive spread with an Adamant nature to markedly improve damage against Ting-Lu and defensive Arceus formes, though this results in considerably reduced bulk, which is especially noticeable against Koraidon.</p> <p>Few teams bar hyper offense don't appreciate Necrozma-DM's immense versatility as a powerful wincon. On more offensive teams, it works in tandem with other physical wallbreakers like Koraidon, Ho-Oh, Zacian-C, and Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground to overwhelm physical walls. Balance teams benefit greatly from Necrozma-DM's defensive utility—especially against Zacian-C—and provide it with a defensive backbone that enables it to bide its time until it can set up and end the game. Ting-Lu is Necrozma-DM's single best partner on any because it provides refuge from Calyrex-S and Miraidon seeking to take advantage of Necrozma-DM, and the Spikes it easily stacks hinder attempts to revenge kill Necrozma-DM from Choice Scarf Koraidon and Calyrex-S while wearing down common checks to Necrozma-DM in Ting-Lu, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Water. Ho-Oh is another wonderful partner for Necrozma-DM, checking Koraidon and Calyrex-S for it; in exchange, Necrozma-DM can switch into Eternatus and deter Choice Scarf Koraidon from using Outrage. Necrozma-DM loves to be paired with powerful wallbreakers like Calyrex-S, Koraidon, and Choice Band Ho-Oh, as these Pokemon excel at beating teams down into position for Necrozma-DM to checkmate them. Calyrex-S supports Necrozma-DM by doing major damage to Ho-Oh with its Choice Specs- or Nasty Plot-boosted attacks and weakening Ting-Lu, which can comfortably take hits from Necrozma-DM and phaze it out with Whirlwind. Koraidon can weaken defensive Arceus formes and force Ho-Oh to Terastallize into the Fairy-type from the threat of being 2HKOed by its Dragon-type moves and thus become weak to Sunsteel Strike. Ho-Oh is the nemesis of any Necrozma-DM lacking Stone Edge, as it can comfortably take most of its attacks and respond with the threat of a Sacred Fire burn or phazing with Whirlwind. As a result, having strong counterplay to Ho-Oh, such as Arceus-Water, Eternatus, or Miraidon, is necessary due to Ho-Oh's propensity for staying healthy. Defensive Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Water are other troublesome defensive checks to Necrozma-DM, so switch-ins to them, such as Ting-Lu or Ho-Oh for the former and Eternatus or Miraidon for the latter, are crucial. Kyogre, though wary of Knock Off or Tera Water, can often take advantage of Necrozma-DM to launch its powerful Water-type attacks, necessitating a Pokemon that can pivot into it like Eternatus, Miraidon, or Koraidon.</p>"

Play Rough has a decent chance to 2HKO Ting-Lu, which is immune to Prankster-boosted Taunt, stopping it from freely laying Spikes.

Tera Ghost makes Grimmsnarl immune to Arceus's Extreme Speed, which has a higher priority than Prankster-boosted moves, and neutral to attacks like Zacian-C's STAB moves. Grimmsnarl is best used on hyper offense teams, where it can block Koraidon's Scale Shot in a pinch, sparingly take hits from Calyrex-S, and—most importantly—support setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Koraidon and setup Arceus formes. Zacian-C and Arceus-Ground can notably switch into Pokemon Grimmsnarl cannot safely stop from setting up such as Arceus-Fairy and opposing Zacian-C, respectively. Additionally, Nasty Plot Calyrex-S and Calm Mind + Agility Miraidon appreciate Grimmsnarl potentially weakening Ting-Lu, their primary defensive check.

However, Zacian-C is checked by multiple defensive Pokemon, most notably Necrozma-DM and Arceus-Ground, as they can take its attacks and force it to switch out. Furthermore, Calyrex-S is a huge threat because of its high Special Attack and Speed, being able to KO Zacian-C after minor chip damage. Choice Scarf Koraidon is also a threat, as it can OHKO Zacian-C with Flare Blitz.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute is a niche option that can take advantage of Eternatus and Pokemon Choice-locked into Dragon-type moves, allowing Zacian-C to set up without interruption. Substitute isn't the best choice for Zacian-C though, as losing important coverage moves like Wild Charge and Crunch lets it get walled by checks such as Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and defensive Arceus formes. Tera Fire is a niche option that grants Zacian-C an immunity to burn from Ho-Oh and defensive Arceus formes such as Arceus-Water and Arceus-Fairy while also allowing it to resist Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire and Koraidon's Flare Blitz. However, Tera Fire makes Zacian-C weak to Stealth Rock, allowing Choice Scarf users such as Koraidon and Calyrex-S and priority users in Arceus to revenge kill it with ease. An alternate EV spread of 104 HP / 252 Atk / 152 Spe allows Zacian-C to outspeed both Koraidon and Miraidon, with the remaining EVs being put into HP, allowing it to survive an Earthquake from Necrozma-DM at -1 and making it harder for Calyrex-S to revenge kill it. However, this EV spread might struggle against opposing Zacian-C with maximum Speed and offensive Necromza-DM, so it is not always the best choice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM</strong>: Physically defensive Necrozma-DM is one of the most common checks to Zacian-C, as it resists both of Zacian-C's main STAB moves and has moves like Earthquake and Sunsteel Strike that can potentially 2HKO it back.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Calyrex-S, as well as Choice Scarf users such as Koraidon and Miraidon, are able to outspeed Zacian-C. Calyrex-S can brute force its way through Zacian-C with Astral Barrage after minor chip damage or a Close Combat Special Defense drop, Koraidon is able to OHKO Zacian-C with Flare Blitz, and Miraidon 2HKOes Zacian-C with Electro Drift.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Arceus Formes</strong>: Bulky Arceus formes such as Arceus-Water and Arceus-Ground can be a problem for Zacian-C, as they can take hits from it and reliably heal themselves with Recover while also threatening it with Judgment or Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

Wild Charge hits Ho-Oh, Kyogre, and Arceus-Water, OHKOing or doing major damage to them after Zacian-C uses Swords Dance. Crunch and Close Combat deal with Necrozma-DM, with the former also threatening Calyrex-S and the latter hitting Ting-Lu for Behemoth Blade sets and OHKOing Arceus. Tera Dark boosts Crunch's damage to let it break through Necrozma-DM more easily and prevents Zacian-C from getting 2HKOed by Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage. Tera Fighting increases the damage of Close Combat, which lets Zacian-C OHKO defensive Arceus formes at +3.</p> <p>Zacian-C struggles with Calyrex-S, which outspeeds it and threatens it with Astral Barrage, so Arceus and special walls such as Ho-Oh and Ting-Lu are needed to help check Calyrex-S.

Bulky walls such as various Arceus formes can also help with Koraidon. Due to Necrozma-DM's high Defense stat, Zacian-C often struggles to break through it, so special attackers like Calyrex-S, Miraidon, Kyogre, and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground are good options to help deal with it.

Multiple physically defensive Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Arceus-Fairy, defensive variants of Arceus Ground, and Eternatus either take massive damage or get KOed by a Swords Dance-boosted Glacial Lance, made worse especially when combined with Tera Fire blocking Will-O-Wisp and Sacred Fire burns. Once Trick Room fades away, Calyrex-I is very prone to getting revenge killed due to its poor defensive typing and Speed. Glacial Lance is great at forcing Terastallization from Pokemon such as Tera Water Arceus-Fairy and Tera Water Landorus-T, which opens up holes for teammates such as Choice Scarf Koraidon and pivot Miraidon to exploit, as Arceus-Fairy and Ho-Oh would lack the ability to Terastallize. High Horsepower allows Calyrex-I to target the Steel-type Pokemon in the tier, such as Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C. Calyrex-I's EV spread maximizes its Attack and breaking potential and runs minimum Speed to Speed tie opposing Calyrex-I under Trick Room.

Calyrex-I struggles with Pokemon such as Arceus-Water, Skeledirge, and Dondozo, being completely unable to break them in most scenarios. Calyrex-I benefits from Pokemon such as Miraidon and Kyogre, which break through the aforementioned checks, and Kyogre has great synergy with Trick Room due to its relatively low Speed stat. Ting-Lu and Eternatus can help defensively back Calyrex-I, as Eternatus can switch into defensive Arceus formes, bar defensive Arceus-Ground, and defensive Ho-Oh with ease, setting up Toxic Spikes and Toxic to help enable a Calyrex-I sweep.

Psychic 2HKOes Arceus, while Psyshock 2HKOes offensive Ho-Oh, has a better chance of OHKOing Eternatus, and hits Pokemon such as Blissey. Trick + Choice Specs debilitates Calyrex-S's checks like Ho-Oh, Ting-Lu, and Arceus by removing the longevity their items grant them and forcing them to attack. Tera Ghost allows Astral Barrage to 2HKO Ting-Lu with less chip damage, OHKO Ho-Oh with an As One boost, and OHKO Necrozma-DM with a neutral Tera type, in addition to 2HKOing Ho-Oh and defensive Arceus formes after Calyrex-S loses its Choice Specs because of Trick. Tera Grass gives Grass Knot a good chance of OHKOing Ting-Lu after hazard damage and lets it 2HKO Arceus; Tera Grass also grants Calyrex-S a resistance to Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground's Earthquake.

Balance and bulky offense teams love it for its potency as a wallbreaker that provides immense utility as a revenge killer and by potentially using Encore, whereas it is borderline mandatory on hyper offense due to its unmatched explosivity and Speed. Koraidon is Calyrex-S's best partner on every kind of team, terrifying Arceus and Ting-Lu while amplifying the pressure placed upon Ho-Oh; on bulkier teams, it takes the mantle of being the team's Choice Scarf user that Calyrex-S must forfeit by opting for Nasty Plot, whereas on hyper offense, it backs up Calyrex-S as one of the core setup sweepers and wallbreakers. Ting-Lu is a great partner for its overall immense defensive utility and capability to answer Choice Scarf Calyrex-S, and its Spikes can wear down opposing Ting-Lu and defensive Arceus formes into range for Calyrex-S to KO them. Ho-Oh provides refuge from Choice Scarf Calyrex-S and Koraidon, the most common revenge killers of Calyrex-S, as well as checking Arceus and Ting-Lu. Ho-Oh is a major nuisance for Calyrex-S, so switch-ins to it like Eternatus or Arceus-Water are important to have. On hyper offense, suicide leads like Deoxys-S, Ribombee, and Glimmora can set entry hazards to weaken foes for Calyrex-S and its teammates or—in Ribombee's case—hinder revenge killers.</p>"

Earth Power is an option that chips Miraidon and Eternatus as well as giving it a super effective hit against Tera Fire Zacian-C and Koraidon.

Tera Flying is a niche option that further improves its matchup against Arceus-Ground while avoiding super effective Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C. Skeledirge is a good fit on balance teams that appreciate it checking common setup threats and carrying teammates that make up for its shortcomings and bad matchups. Skeledirge is very vulnerable to Miraidon, Kyogre, Calyrex-S, and Arceus-Ground, so it appreciates teammates like Ting-Lu, Eternatus, Wo-Chien, and Giratina-O to handle these powerful attackers. Likewise, Skeledirge pairs well with fast attackers and priority users such as Calyrex-S, Choice Scarf Koraidon, and Extreme Killer Arceus, which can threaten the foes that force Skeledirge out and revenge kill Pokemon it checks if it is overwhelmed.</p>"

Spikes and Toxic Spikes give Clodsire a way to exert offensive pressure, alongside Earthquake which punishes Miraidon and Zacian-C on switch-in. Poison Jab can be used over Toxic or Toxic Spikes to potentially punish Taunt variants of Arceus-Fairy, but it is generally outclassed by the other options. Water Absorb makes Clodsire a more solid check to Miraidon, since Unaware ignores Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop, and lets Clodsire check Arceus-Water and variants of Kyogre without Substitute. Unaware is an alternative checks Calyrex-S more consistently. Tera Steel flips Clodsire's weakness to Ice- and Psychic-type attacks such as Kyogre's Ice Beam and Calyrex-S's Psyshock, while making Clodsire more reliable into Miraidon's Draco Meteor. Tera Dark makes Clodsire weaker to Arceus-Fairy and Miraidon, but checks Calyrex-S without a Fighting- or Fairy-type move, as well as Calm Mind Arceus-Ground. Clodsire's ability to both absorb Toxic Spikes and check various special attackers gives it a niche on balance and stall teams. Clodsire pairs well with physical walls such as Gliscor, Toxapex, Dondozo, and Skeledirge, as they can check Koraidon, physical variants of Arceus formes, and Zacian-C. Secondary special walls such as Blissey are appreciated to ease the burden on Clodsire against Calyrex-S, Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, and Kyogre. Wo-Chien also checks these threats and helps against Dragon Dance variants of Arceus-Ground.

    "overview": "<p>Ting-Lu is a dominant presence in Anything Goes, filling the role of the metagame's most crucial defensive glue while simultaneously providing indispensable offensive support. Ting-Lu is blessed with a fantastic typing that—in tandem with its titanic, Vessel of Ruin-boosted bulk—makes it the single best switch-in to Miraidon, one of the most consistent Calyrex-S checks, and a soft check to Necrozma-DM, Eternatus, and a plethora of other threats. This incredible defensive profile grants Ting-Lu many opportunities to set multiple layers of Spikes, making it that much harder for the foes to weather hits from its teammates. This unrivaled combination of traits means that Ting-Lu should be used on nearly every team bar hyper offense ones. Though, as fantastic as Ting-Lu is, its omnipresence means that methods to limit its impact or take advantage of it are common. Koraidon and Kyogre are able to exploit Ting-Lu to facilitate their wallbreaking, and common Pokemon like Miraidon and various Arceus formes can use Taunt to prevent Ting-Lu from setting Spikes. Furthermore, Ting-Lu is entirely reliant on Leftovers for healing, so Knock Off or any status condition greatly reduces its longevity.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ting-Lu has plenty of fringe options. Fissure can be used in a similar vein to Ruination, punishing switch-ins and OHKOing bulky sweepers that would typically beat Ting-Lu, though its inherent inconsistency and inability to touch Ho-Oh mean that it is generally inferior. Protect can be used to gain additional healing from Leftovers and scout Choice Scarf Koraidon's attacks, though this means giving up a valuable moveslot for minimal upsides. Stealth Rock can be used to stack additional passive damage on top of Spikes, though the difficulty of fitting it into Ting-Lu's moveset and lack of general effectiveness over Spikes mean that it is usually better delegating Stealth Rock to a partner like Arceus-Water, if it's run at all. Similarly, Taunt can be used, with some extra Speed investment, to gain an advantage over opposing Ting-Lu, though this has minimal other use and struggles to fit into Ting-Lu's cramped moveset. A wide variety of Tera types can be used, such as Steel and Fairy, to fill whatever niche is required; these have far less overall use than Tera Grass or Tera Poison though.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Koraidon</strong>: Koraidon heavily threatens Ting-Lu with its powerful Low Kick and can switch into it with relative safety, though it doesn't appreciate getting hit by Ruination or Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Kyogre</strong>: Kyogre deals massive damage to Ting-Lu and can typically use it as an entry point; Tera Grass Ting-Lu can turn the tables against it though.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ting-Lu is incapable of doing much damage to Ho-Oh, and it can get crippled by a Sacred Fire burn or take a lot of damage from offensive sets. Ho-Oh doesn't immediately force Ting-Lu out though, and it can often allow multiple layers of Spikes to go up.</p>",

Spikes are an essential part of Ting-Lu's kit, chipping key defensive walls like Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Water, and opposing Ting-Lu into KO range of the powerful wallbreakers that it is often paired with, in addition to limiting common revenge killers like Choice Scarf Calyrex-S and Koraidon; futhermore, the dearth of relevant entry hazard removal means that each layer of Spikes is usually permanent. Earthquake does large amounts of damage to Miraidon and Eternatus and is a decently strong hit on most neutral targets. Ruination is an important tool for limiting Ting-Lu's switch-ins and forcing Arceus formes to use Recover, as well as being the best move to weaken opposing Ting-Lu. Payback can be run over either Earthquake or Ruination to OHKO Calyrex-S for teams that are weaker to it, though this will result in Ting-Lu either struggling against Miraidon or failing to punish switch-ins, depending on which move is replaced. Whirlwind allows Ting-Lu to handle setup sweepers like Necrozma-DM and Arceus-Ground, as well as racking up additional damage from Spikes. Tera Grass can turn the tables on Kyogre and makes Ting-Lu an effective check to Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground. Tera Poison instead lets Ting-Lu resist Koraidon's Low Kick and Fairy-type attacks from Zacian-C and Arceus-Fairy, be immune to Eternatus's Toxic, and remove Eternatus's Toxic Spikes, albeit at the cost of becoming weak to Psychic- and Ground-type attacks from Calyrex-S, Necrozma-DM, and Arceus-Ground. Both Tera types additionally let Ting-Lu resist Calyrex-S's Grass Knot.</p> <p>Ting-Lu is so incredible that it's hard to find reasons not to use it. It can slot into any playstyle besides hyper offense and likely improve the team. That being said, Ting-Lu's glaring weakness to Koraidon necessitates partners that can handle it, such as Ho-Oh and defensive Arceus formes. Kyogre is another troublesome wallbreaker, so teammates that can pivot into it like Eternatus, Koraidon, and Miraidon are greatly appreciated, with Eternatus additionally absorbing Toxic Spikes for Ting-Lu. Reliance on Leftovers for healing means that Ting-Lu can be overwhelmed by Miraidon and Calyrex-S, so backup checks to them like Arceus-Ground for the former and Ho-Oh or Arceus for the latter are very important. Almost every offensive threat benefits from Ting-Lu's Spikes digging into its checks, as well as the backbone it provides against Calyrex-S and Miraidon. Koraidon and Miraidon are especially notable partners, as they can maintain momentum with U-turn to accrue additional entry hazard damage on defensive Arceus formes and Ting-Lu, respectively, with Koraidon also taking advantage of opposing Ting-Lu attempting to trade hazards with Ting-Lu. Necrozma-DM is another teammate that benefits greatly from Ting-Lu's Spikes support weakening opposing teams to the point where it can sweep with Dragon Dance, and it provides additional support as a check to Zacian-C and another pivot for Eternatus, while Ting-Lu can check Calyrex-S for it.</p>"

However, Koraidon's ability to switch in repeatedly is significantly hindered by Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Additionally, Koraidon's reliance on Flare Blitz diminishes its longevity.

Flare Blitz, when boosted by Orichalcum Pulse's sun, provides excellent neutral coverage against Steel-, Fairy-, and Ghost-types such as Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Fairy, and Calyrex-S. Low Kick, with its 120 Base Power against most of the metagame, avoids the stat drops of Close Combat and OHKOes Arceus and Ting-Lu after one layer of Spikes while reliably damaging Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Water. Outrage is generally preferred over Dragon Claw due to its ability to 2HKO Ho-Oh and OHKO Calyrex-S and Eternatus. However, it makes Koraidon vulnerable to revenge killing attempts by Fairy-types such as Arceus-Fairy, Zacian-C, and Tera Fairy Ho-Oh. U-turn provides essential pivoting capabilities and allows Koraidon to finish off weakened foes without the concern of them Terastallizing into a type that's immune to one of its STAB moves. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed +1 Jolly Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM after Sticky Web, outspeed +1 Jolly Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground, and Speed tie with opposing Choice Scarf Miraidon and Koraidon. An Adamant nature enables Koraidon to 2HKO bulky Arceus formes after one layer of Spikes or Stealth Rock and secure a guaranteed OHKO on Calyrex-S. Tera Fire allows Flare Blitz to OHKO Necrozma-DM and 2HKO Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Ground; it also grants Koraidon burn immunity while making it neutral to Psychic-type moves from Calyrex-S and Necrozma-DM. However, Tera Fire flips Koraidon's resistance to Stealth Rock into a weakness, severely limiting its ability to switch in repeatedly. Tera Ghost provides Koraidon with immunities to Fighting- and Normal-type moves, allowing it to turn the tables against opposing Koraidon and Extreme Killer Arceus. Additionally, it allows Koraidon to take neutral damage from Psychic- and Dragon-type attacks from Necrozma-DM, Calyrex-S, and Eternatus. The primary downside of Tera Ghost is its weakness to Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Koraidon is an incredibly powerful asset to balance and bulky offense teams thanks to its game-defining pivoting and wallbreaking abilities. However, Koraidon struggles against bulky Arceus formes like Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Water, as the former resists Low Kick, (comma) and the latter resists Flare Blitz. Defensive Ho-Oh also poses a challenge for Koraidon to break through. As a result, Kyogre and Ho-Oh make excellent teammates, applying pressure on opposing Ho-Oh and bulky Arceus formes. In return, they greatly benefit from Koraidon's pivoting allowing them to enter the battlefield safely. Koraidon also pairs well with Calyrex-S, whose unmatched Special Attack and Speed stats can dismantle Koraidon's aforementioned checks. Physical attackers in Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground and Necrozma-DM are also invaluable teammates, as they can dispose of Ho-Oh with Stone Edge while continually pressuring bulky Arceus formes. Miraidon is another outstanding partner that complements Koraidon perfectly, as both can safely bring in the other, with Koraidon forcing out Ting-Lu and Miraidon pressuring Ho-Oh. Lastly, Koraidon benefits from being paired with entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, and Eternatus, which not only provide critical support with Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Toxic Spikes but also check significant threats such as Calyrex-S, opposing Koraidon, and Kyogre, respectively.</p>"

      "Scale Shot": {
        "description": "<p>Scale Shot Koraidon is an incredibly potent setup sweeper, leveraging its great Attack, great ability, and high Speed to punch holes through many bulky offense and balance teams alike. Scale Shot targets Dragon-types, such as Eternatus, Miraidon, and Giratina-O, while also increasing Koraidon's Speed. This boost allows it to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Calyrex-S and Speed tie with Jolly Choice Scarf Koraidon. However, the accompanying Defense drop makes it more vulnerable to Arceus's Extreme Speed. Scale Shot can also 2HKO Skeledirge and OHKO Ho-Oh after a boost, allowing Koraidon to break through teams that are reliant on them to check it. Flare Blitz gives Koraidon a way to hit Arceus-Fairy, OHKOing it at +2 after some chip damage and forcing Arceus-Fairy to stay healthy; this move also gives Koraidon an accurate way of hitting and OHKOing Calyrex-S. Low Kick is OHKOes Arceus and deals significant damage to Arceus-Water, Arceus-Ground, and Ting-Lu. Close Combat is an alternative to Low Kick, giving Koraidon a good way of hitting Alomomola, although it causes a Defense drop in exchange. Swords Dance allows Koraidon to threaten defensive Arceus formes, threaten defensive Ho-Oh, and break through many teams. Tera Ghost gives Koraidon an immunity to Arceus's Extreme Speed and opposing Koraidon's Low Kick, helping it avoid being revenge killed.</p> <p>Koraidon is a staple on hyper offense teams, where Scale Shot forces Arceus-Fairy to stay very healthy or allow Koraidon a Speed boost, which it can use to easily snowball into a sweep. Thus, due to Koraidon's ability to easily chip defensive Arceus formes, Zacian-C finds its way onto the majority of teams using Scale Shot Koraidon. One of Zacian-C's biggest defensive checks, Arceus-Water, takes a great deal of damage when attempting to stop +2 Koraidon, allowing Zacian-C to revenge kill Arceus-Water with Wild Charge. Koraidon also assists Arceus-Ground in breaking defensive Arceus formes, which can otherwise chip Arceus-Ground with Judgment or threaten to use Will-O-Wisp until they are Taunted. Though Koraidon can assist in breaking defensive Arceus formes, on its own, it still struggles to get past them without prior chip damage. Therefore, Deoxys-S's entry hazards greatly assist Koraidon, as +2 Low Kick OHKOes Arceus-Water, and +2 Flare Blitz OHKOes Arceus-Fairy after some hazard damage. Choice Scarf Calyrex-S can outspeed even +1 Koraidon and threaten to OHKO it with Psychic or Astral Barrage after some chip damage, so Arceus, with an immunity to Astral Barrage and great natural bulk, is a stellar teammate for Koraidon. Furthermore, taking advantage of Calyrex-S being locked into Astral Barrage or Psychic, Arceus can force Calyrex-S to switch out with the threat of Shadow Claw and set up with Swords Dance. Though quite niche, Scale Shot Koraidon can also be used on balance and bulky offense structures using Choice Scarf Calyrex-S, leveraging surprise factor to quickly overwhelm unsuspecting defensive Arceus formes.</p>"

  "Miraidon": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to Miraidon's outstanding power cementing it as one of the most potent wallbreakers in the metagame, it is a staple on balance and bulky offense, and every team needs to have effective counterplay for it. U-turn makes Miraidon an amazing pivot, allowing it to safely bring in teammates such as Koraidon and Calyrex-S. However, due to the prevalence of the Ground-types Ting-Lu and Arceus-Ground, which can force Miraidon out one-on-one, it has a tough time safely coming in and wallbreaking. Additionally, Calyrex-S and Choice Scarf Koraidon can revenge kill Miraidon. Keeping this in mind, Miraidon really appreciates teammates such as Ho-Oh and Ting-Lu that are able to check Ting-Lu, Arceus-Ground, and offensive wallbreakers such as Koraidon and Calyrex-S.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Miraidon can opt to use a more niche option in Overheat, which OHKOes Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C under the sun provided by the omnipresent Koraidon. However, it is heavily prediction reliant and makes Miraidon drop more effective option in Taunt or Calm Mind. Miraidon can also opt for Tera Grass, which further bolsters the power of Solar Beam, allowing it to OHKO Ting-Lu at +1 and OHKO Arceus-Ground when unboosted. Furthermore, it lets Miraidon serve as a backup check to Arceus-Ground thanks to the Ground resistance it provides.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ting-Lu</strong>: Ting-Lu can effectively switch into Miraidon's Draco Meteor and safely pivot into Electro Drift, making it difficult to break through. However, Ting-Lu lacks recovery, which means it cannot do this repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Ground</strong>: At +1, Arceus-Ground can outspeed Miraidon and threaten it out with Earthquake. Also, Arceus-Ground is able to pivot in on Miraidon's Electro Drift, and it can force Miraidon to switch out in a one-on-one situation.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers such as Koraidon and Calyrex-S can outspeed Miraidon and potentially KO it with their STAB moves. Additionally, thanks to Arceus's STAB priority in Extreme Speed, it can pick off a low-HP Miraidon.</p> <p><strong>Zacian-C</strong>: Courtesy of Zacian-C's high Speed and Play Rough, it is able to KO Miraidon. Also, Zacian-C is one of the very few Pokemon that blocks Miraidon's Draco Meteor, making it easier for it to safely switch in.</p>",

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Miraidon's raw natural power backed by Hadron Engine and access to U-turn make it one of the best pivots for balance and bulky offense teams. Heavy-Duty Boots greatly increases Miraidon's longevity by letting it come in multiple times without any consequences from entry hazards while also improving its matchup against Sticky Web. Taunt helps prevent Ting-Lu from using Spikes, Arceus formes and Clodsire from using Recover, and foes such as Arceus and Necrozma-DM from setting up. Calm Mind allows Miraidon to OHKO Necrozma-DM after a single boost and brute force its way through its checks, 2HKOing Ting-Lu and OHKOing Arceus-Ground at +1 after entry hazard damage. Solar Beam is an alternative option that allows Miraidon to 2HKO Ting-Lu and OHKO Arceus-Ground after some minor chip damage, although it requires sun to be up for Miraidon to be able to use it with ease. Tera Fairy gives Miraidon an immunity to Dragon-type moves from Koraidon, Eternatus, and opposing Miraidon, albeit at the cost of making it weak to Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike and removing its resistance to Ho-Oh's STAB moves. Tera Dragon boosts Miraidon's Draco Meteor to absolutely insane levels, allowing it to 2HKO Ting-Lu at +1 and OHKO Arceus-Ground. Tera Ghost grants Miraidon an immunity to Koraidon's Low Kick and Arceus's Extreme Speed, although it makes Miraidon weak to Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage.</p> <p>Miraidon is primarily used on balance and bulky offense teams that benefit from its wallbreaking and pivoting capabilities. Miraidon struggles with revenge killers such as Koraidon and Calyrex-S, so it likes checks to them such as Ho-Oh and defensive Arceus formes for the former and Ting-Lu for the latter. Miraidon appreciates being paired with Choice Scarf Koraidon, as they can pivot each other in and complement each other really well, with Koraidon being able to pressure Ting-Lu and Arceus-Ground and Miraidon helping against Ho-Oh and Arceus-Water. Miraidon also appreciates special attackers such as Calyrex-S and Arceus-Ground that can pressure and eventually break through Ting-Lu. Lastly, Miraidon greatly benefits from Ting-Lu setting entry hazards to let it effectively break through foes and being a fabulous check to Calyrex-S and Arceus-Ground, which Miraidon struggles with.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {},
      "Agility": {
        "description": "<p>Life Orb Miraidon is a potent setup sweeper, leveraging its great power to unleash incredible damage. Agility allows Miraidon to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Electro Drift hits most of the tier neutrally and notably OHKOes Zacian-C, Calyrex-S, and Ho-Oh, as well as OHKOing Arceus formes after two layers of Spikes. Solar Beam gives Miraidon a way of hitting Ting-Lu super effectively, though it is hindered by requiring Koraidon's sun. Dragon Pulse hits all Dragon-types in the tier for super effective damage while giving an alternative to chip Ting-Lu. However, due to Miraidon's poor longevity because of Life Orb recoil damage and a vulnerability to entry hazard damage, it can't afford to switch in frequently early in the game. Additionally, an opponent could predict Miraidon's moves and constantly switch to a resisted Pokemon to stall out Electric Terrain. Tera Grass ensures an OHKO on Ting-Lu with Solar Beam after minor chip damage and ensures Miraidon's safe setup against foes such as Eternatus, Miraidon, and Ting-Lu if it doesn't use Whirlwind. Miraidon's EV spread allows it to outspeed the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the tier, Choice Scarf Calyrex-S, after using Agility.</p> <p>Agility Miraidon is primarily used on two types of teams—hyper offense and bulky offense—as a late-game sweeper once other attackers wear down its checks. On bulky offense, it also has a surprise factor, since an offensive pivot set is much more common on such teams, and an unexpected Agility can quickly turn the tide of a game. However, due to Miraidon's issues with longevity and weakness to entry hazard damage, bulky offense teams using it often run Pokemon such as Magic Bounce Hatterene to stave off hazards or powerful attackers like Choice Specs Kyogre to apply pressure on opposing hazard setters. Miraidon lures in and does great damage to Ting-Lu, one of Calyrex-S's best checks, helping enable a Nasty Plot sweep. Agility Miraidon also lures in Arceus-Ground, which takes a great deal of damage from Solar Beam, and opens up Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Koraidon, which no longer has to worry about Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground using Tera Fairy to set up on it. Similarly, Miraidon's ability to significantly chip Arceus-Fairy when combined with entry hazards helps Koraidon overwhelm and KO it. Miraidon struggles with Ting-Lu before Terastallizing due to the latter's great natural bulk and Electric immunity, and Choice Scarf Koraidon's Outrage threatens to OHKO Miraidon before it uses Agility. Therefore, Arceus-Fairy, Ho-Oh, and Landorus-T are great partners to Agility Miraidon, leveraging their excellent defensive typings and stats to switch into Ting-Lu and Koraidon effectively. Landorus-T's and Choice Scarf Koraidon's U-turns also provide a safe switch in opportunity for Agility Miraidon. Furthermore, Landorus-T checks Zacian-C, which otherwise outspeeds and threatens to OHKO Miraidon with Play Rough before it uses Agility. Ting-Lu is also a stellar partner for Miraidon, as the layers of Spikes it sets are an invaluable aid to a potential sweep.</p>"
