  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Out of all the Chlorophyll users, Venusaur is perhaps the most balanced. Neither fast and frail, nor bulky with a great support movepool, it has a little bit of everything. This has its benefits, but with benefits come downsides. Trying to occupy the roles of two very different types of Pokemon, Venusaur often falls short of all its goals. Despite this, proper support can open up new doors for Venusaur, and it can become a great Pokemon to utilize on a sun team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Petal Dance might seem like an attractive option for its sheer power, but it is unreliable as it hits a random opponent and confuses Venusaur after a few turns. Giga Drain might seem inviting for the recovery it provides, and it would be if it were not incompatible with Chlorophyll, so Venusaur is best relying on the average Energy Ball. Those looking for healing might see Synthesis as an option; however, Venusaur is better off attacking than trying to heal, and Synthesis is inconsistent at best. A physical set is somewhat viable, utilizing Seed Bomb and Earthquake to hit Venusaur's usual counters for super effective damage, but the low damage output will often turn one off. Substitute can be utilized along with Sleep Powder for a deadly combo, which allows Venusaur to keep its opponents asleep and render them unable to take it out immediately.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fire-types such as Chandelure and Heatran wall Venusaur to no end, taking little from its attacks and hitting back with super effective Fire-type moves. Ironically, the condition that suits Venusaur the best is also its worst enemy. Sun boosts Fire-type moves by 50%, allowing such attacks to OHKO Venusaur with no trouble. Ice-types threaten Venusaur as well; Abomasnow in particular neuters Venusaur's Speed with hail and threatens a KO with a super effective Blizzard. Venusaur's weakness to Flying allows Pokemon such as Tornadus and Togekiss to have a field day against it, as they can dish out massive damage to Venusaur with their STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Chlorophyll": {
        "description": "<p>In sun, Venusaur's ability, Chlorophyll, doubles its Speed, instantly allowing it to outpace all other unboosted Pokemon. This makes for an insanely fast Sleep Powder, and the lack of Sleep Clause in VGC allows Venusaur to quickly incapacitate several remaining foes. In addition to providing a solid STAB move, Energy Ball hits auto-weather Pokemon, such as Tyranitar and Politoed, for super effective damage, something a sun team always needs. If one doesn't fear other weather, SolarBeam is a powerful STAB option while in sun, hitting for 120 Base Power without having to charge. However, one must be aware of the numerous ways SolarBeam can be neutered, as the four other weather starters love to switch in and leave Venusaur with a two-turn charging move that has severely reduced effectiveness. Hidden Power Ice gives Venusaur a way to hit the Dragon- and Flying-type Pokemon that take little damage from its STAB move. Sludge Bomb, however, provides a secondary STAB move that has a higher Base Power than Energy Ball, and can afflict the opponent with the poison condition. Protect is arguably the best move in doubles, shielding Venusaur from all assaults for a turn, as well as giving its partner time to eliminate a threat.</p> <p>Venusaur's attacking power leaves something to be desired, so a Life Orb is used to boost the damage output of all its attacks. If a Life Orb is not available, a Yache Berry makes for a suitable alternative, as it could allow Venusaur to survive a Blizzard it might otherwise not. A Modest nature and 252 Special Attack EVs let Venusaur hit as hard as possible, and 252 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed nearly everything under sun. Chandelure and Heatran pose a threat to Venusaur, making Hidden Power Ground a viable option to take care of these Pokemon.</p> <p>Due to Venusaur's dependence on sun, a Pokemon to set it up is greatly appreciated. Ninetales is the premier Pokemon to provide this, with its ability, Drought, instantly bringing eternal sun to the field. Venusaur helps Ninetales by taking on the dangerous Ground-types that want to smack it with a super effective Earthquake.</p>"

  "Pikachu": {
    "overview": "<p>Pikachu: the hero of Pokemon, keeping the world safe from Team Rocket. Its base 90 Speed, as well as its other stats, all of which are below 55, aren't very appealing, as they make Pikachu very susceptible to being KOed by both priority moves and faster Pokemon, such as Garchomp. However, its signature item—Light Ball—gives Pikachu some much-needed attacking power, allowing it to nab some nifty KOs on weakened Pokemon. Even with the attacking power it receives, though, Pikachu still needs lots of team support to actually hurt the opposing team; therefore it enjoys team support from sleep inducers, Icy Wind spammers, and Tailwind users. Pikachu can wreck the opponent if played right, but make any mistake with it and you're done for.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pikachu really doesn't have many other helpful options to use. Static can be used, possibly activating against opponents attempting to use Fake Out or other contact priority moves on it. Focus Sash can be another choice for an item, but losing its Light Ball would lead to a significant drop in attacking power. Support moves such as Rain Dance and Helping Hand can be used, but there are many other Pokemon that can pull off these support roles better. Substitute is a viable option over Protect, but Pikachu's Substitute takes little effort to break.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Pikachu's paper-thin defenses make clear how easy it is to take care of it; nearly any strong STAB attack will OHKO Pikachu. Pikachu essentially fears anything that can outspeed it and hit it hard such as Garchomp and Infernape. Spread moves are also trouble for Pikachu, as they cannot be lured by Follow Me or Rage Powder users. If Pikachu lacks Hidden Power Ice, Pokemon that resist both Grass Knot and Thunderbolt, such as Haxorus and Latios, will take little damage and manage to retaliate and KO it. Relatively bulky Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Metagross also create issues for Pikachu, as they can easily tank one of Pikachu's attacks and KO it with one of their own STAB attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Fake Out Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Pikachu makes a subpar Fake Out user compared to others, but using Fake Out allows partners to use support moves such as Tailwind, Icy Wind, or Spore, making for an easier second turn. Thunderbolt is Pikachu's main STAB move, dealing plenty of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Thunder is a harder-hitting option to only be used on rain teams, as its horrid accuracy without rain isn't worth the extra power. Grass Knot is an excellent way for Pikachu to nail a wider variety of Pokemon for super effective damage, such as heavy Ground- and Rock-types; Rhyperior, Gastrodon, Tyranitar, and Terrakion are all noteworthy targets. Protect is useful for Pikachu; it allows it Pikachu to last longer in the battle, and lets teammates provide opportunities for Pikachu to shine and go on the offensive. However, Hidden Power Ice can give extra coverage, allowing Pikachu to hit Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus, and Dragonite extremely hard.</p> <p>The purpose of the EVs is to allow Pikachu to hit as hard and fast as possible. Because of its poor defensive stats, using either a Rash or Naive nature instead of decreasing one of its offensive stats is recommended. A Naive nature is generally preferred, due to a need to outspeed threats such as neutral natured Landorus and Volcarona. Light Ball is Pikachu's item to use, giving it an excellent boost for its attacking stats. Lightning Rod is the key ability and main reason why Pikachu can be so strong in this metagame, as it pairs well with Pokemon that can spam Discharge or priority Thunder Waves for instant boosts.</p> <p>Support is absolutely a must for Pikachu if you wish for optimal results. Pokemon that can provide this support include sleep inducers, Icy Wind users, and Follow Me and Rage Powder users. Ideal Pokemon for this are Amoonguss, Cresselia, and Togekiss, all of which have different types of support. Togekiss can be especially useful for providing Tailwind; however, other users of Tailwind, such as Tornadus and Zapdos, can work just as well. Lightning Rod not only gives Pikachu those much-needed boosts to its Special Attack, but also provides support to draw in deadly Electric-type attacks away from Pokemon that would otherwise take heavy damage, such as Gyarados and Jellicent.</p>"

  "Raichu": {
    "overview": "<p>Raichu may not be the best Pokemon in the VGC metagame, but it's still a Pokemon to consider. This generation, Raichu received a new addition to its arsenal from the Dream World: Lightning Rod. This ability grants Raichu an immunity to Electric-type moves, as well as a Special Attack boost when hit by them. Additionally, Raichu still has the tools it has always had: a wide movepool, excellent Speed, and good Special Attack. Lightning Rod makes Raichu an excellent choice to use on any rain team, as it can draw away all Electric-type attacks aimed at its Water-type teammates and obtain the aforementioned Special Attack boost. However, Raichu's terrible defenses allow most powerful neutral attacks to strike it down. If it weren't for Lightning Rod and Encore, Raichu would be outclassed by other Electric-types such as Zapdos. All in all, Raichu can serve as a useful counter to rain teams, an option to use on your own rain teams, as well as a powerful special attacker on an offensive team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Although being locked into one attack is unfavorable, Choice Scarf and Choice Specs are also options to consider; a Choice set consisting of Thunderbolt, Focus Blast, Hidden Power Ice, and Grass Knot can be effective. Using Nasty Plot and Agility in conjunction with Focus Sash is somewhat viable, allowing Raichu to obtain a power or Speed boost while surviving an attack, then hit back on the next turn. Since Raichu's Attack stat and physical movepool aren't too shabby, a physical set consisting of Volt Tackle, Return, Iron Tail, and Brick Break is a possibility as well. A SubPunch set with two other physical moves—most notably Volt Tackle and Iron Tail—is another powerful set; however, this is illegal with Lightning Rod. A set with Substitute and three attacks can be used to block status, but Raichu isn't drastically affected by any type of status, and status isn't too common anyway. Grass Knot or Hidden Power Grass can be used over Focus Blast or Hidden Power Ice, respectively, to hit Gastrodon hard. Even though it is somewhat of a gimmick, Magnet Rise can also be used to turn Raichu's lone Ground-type weakness into an immunity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Thanks to its good special bulk, Gastrodon can take any hit Raichu throws at it and strike back with a super effective Earth Power. However, Gastrodon should be wary of Hidden Power Grass and Grass Knot, as they do heavy damage; on the other hand, Rindo Berry, which is one of Gastrodon's most commonly held items, solves this problem. Strong, faster Fake Out users such as Weavile can break Raichu's Focus Sash and flinch it on turn one, KOing it the next turn with a powerful STAB attack. Terrakion is also a pretty good check to Raichu; it outspeeds Raichu and OHKOes it with Close Combat. Lanturn is immune to Raichu's STAB thanks to Volt Absorb, resists Hidden Power Ice, takes little damage from Focus Blast, and can hit Raichu hard with a STAB Surf. Tyranitar walls any Raichu that doesn't carry Focus Blast quite well; sandstorm breaks Raichu's Focus Sash and also provides Tyranitar with a Special Defense boost. Similarly, Abomasnow can take down Raichu easily with a powerful STAB move thanks to Snow Warning. Since Garchomp usually carries Yache Berry, it can take any hit from Raichu and KO it with a STAB Earthquake. In general, physical attackers which are faster or bulky enough to take a hit can easily take it down, as Raichu's Defense stat is horrendous.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set utilizes Raichu's high Special Attack, good Speed, and decent movepool to turn it into a hard-hitting special attacker. Thunderbolt is Raichu's most reliable STAB move, hitting almost every Pokemon that doesn't resist it for good damage. Another option for a STAB move is Discharge; the 30% paralysis chance that Discharge provides can be very helpful. However, as Discharge hits all Pokemon on the field instead of just one, it should only be used if Raichu's teammates are immune to Electric-type attacks. Fake Out is more of a support move, meant to be used on turn one to flinch the opponent; this helps Raichu to break Focus Sashes and take down threats immediately with the combined help of a teammate. Hidden Power Ice hits Dragon-types that resist Raichu's STAB move, such as Latios and Haxorus, for super effective damage; it also provides coverage against Ground-types that threaten Raichu, such as Garchomp. Focus Blast is an alternative coverage move that allows Raichu to hit Rock- and Ice-types such as Tyranitar and Abomasnow for super effective damage. The choice between Hidden Power Ice and Focus Blast depends on the type of Pokemon your team has trouble with. Protect allows Raichu to avoid Fake Out from faster Pokemon on turn one and is also useful for scouting purposes. Encore is also a viable choice for the fourth moveslot, however; it forces a Pokemon into using the move it used last, and is thus useful against Pokemon that set up Trick Room or Tailwind.</p> <p>Focus Sash allows Raichu to survive one attack—providing that it's not a multi-hit one—and strike back with a powerful attack of its own. Life Orb gives Raichu a nice power boost and is certainly a viable option over Focus Sash, seeing as hail and sandstorm, both of which are disastrous for Focus Sash holders, are common in the VGC 2012 metagame. The EV spread used on this set is quite simple; it maximizes Raichu's Special Attack and Speed, allowing it to be as fast and powerful as possible. A Timid nature makes Raichu even faster and allows it to outspeed all Pokemon with base 99 Speed or below, most notably Haxorus and Krookodile. Alternatively, a Modest nature can be used to make Raichu hit even harder. As for teammates, Drizzle Politoed helps Raichu by summoning rain, allowing it to run Thunder without fear of missing. Bulky Water-types, such as Jellicent and Politoed, are both teammates that can help Raichu by baiting Electric-type attacks for it to redirect and absorb. Ludicolo and other Grass-types can quickly dispose of Ground-types that wall Raichu, such as Gastrodon. Pokemon that carry Discharge, such as Zapdos, can give Raichu a free Special Attack boost through Lightning Rod as well.</p>"

  "Nidoking": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoking finds great strength in his Dream World ability, Sheer Force, which not only boosts the power of moves that have secondary effects, but also negates recoil damage from Life Orb when said moves are used. Base 85 Speed isn't the greatest for a sweeper, but with enough investment, it suffices for Nidoking's purposes. To add to this, Nidoking has an amazing special movepool, which includes powerful moves such as Thunderbolt and Ice Beam; one can even use Nidoking on a weather team in order to use moves such as Blizzard and Thunder. However, Nidoking is fairly frail, and will fold to nearly any attack that comes its way. This is a huge drawback of using Nidoking, but if you can work around its issues, you will clearly see how much of a monster he can be for your opponent.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nidoking can definitely make use of a physical set that takes advantage of Head Smash and Sucker Punch, but his physical movepool is too small to abuse Sheer Force properly. If you want more power, you could try and use moves such as Fire Blast, Blizzard, and Thunder, but the accuracy is off-putting. However, Thunder and Blizzard will be perfectly accurate in rain and hail respectively, making them good choices with the right team support. Thunder and Thunderbolt aren't good choices in general though, as they only hit two of the Pokemon commonly seen on rain teams, Politoed and Jellicent, for super effective damage. Sludge Wave is a decent STAB spread move, but it requires a Steel-type teammate, as hitting an ally won't be enjoyable. If you're worried about Nidoking getting outsped, a Timid nature can work, but again, he misses out on significant KOs. The same set with a Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs could work on a Trick Room team, but his base 85 Speed might be too fast. A Choice Scarf can be used to help Nidoking outspeed threats such as Latios and Garchomp, but the significant power drop is discouraging.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As mentioned before, Nidoking has issues with Psychic-types, such as Latios and Cresselia, as most of them can either outspeed and OHKO Nidoking or take a hit and KO him. Rain and sandstorm are problematic weathers for Nidoking, as rain teams include many Water-type Pokemon, who can easily KO Nidoking with rain-boosted STAB attacks, while sandstorm activates the abilities Sand Force and Sand Rush, allowing some Pokemon to take a hit and retaliate full force, or easily outspeed Nidoking and take him out. Again, Latios and Garchomp are major threats to Nidoking, as both of them outspeed and KO. While Abomasnow is normally easily dispatched by Nidoking, Choice Scarf variants are good counters, as they can outspeed and OHKO Nidoking with Blizzard. Nidoking's defenses are not great, so a majority of Pokemon that outspeed him will KO him as well.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>At Level 50, Modest Nidoking has a Special Attack stat of 150. With Sheer Force, STAB, and Life Orb boosting most of his moves, Nidoking is a force to be reckoned with. Earth Power, Nidoking's main STAB move, is put into the first moveslot. Earth Power hits almost everything that isn't up in the air for great damage. Ice Beam is needed so Nidoking can eliminate Dragon-type threats, such as Latios and Garchomp, who easily OHKO him. However, Ice Beam only helps KO these threats when you have either Tailwind or Trick Room up, as otherwise, Latios and Garchomp will outspeed Nidoking. The third slot is reserved for a secondary STAB move, Sludge Bomb; it hits a number of opponents very hard, but lacks coverage due to Nidoking's poor offensive typing. Sludge Bomb can OHKO Ludicolo, another Pokemon that Nidoking doesn't like to be around, as Ludicolo can easily tear through Nidoking using Scald or Ice Beam. Flamethrower is also a worthy move for the set, as it hits Pokemon such as Scizor, Abomasnow, and Escavalier for incredible damage. However, its coverage overlaps with Earth Power, which often renders it useless. Protect is just a general staple for nearly every VGC Pokemon: it can help stall, prevent Nidoking from taking damage from Fake Out, or simply allow Nidoking to live for another turn.</p> <p>To abuse Sheer Force to its full potential, Life Orb is the item of choice. A Modest nature is recommended for Nidoking, as he misses out on some key KOs otherwise. Sheer Force is obviously the best ability for Nidoking, as it provides his moves with much-needed boosts, and negates Life Orb recoil damage. The EV spread is a simple special sweeper build; it ensures that Nidoking is as fast and strong as possible. In terms of moves, Shadow Ball is an option for coverage against Psychic-type threats, but it struggles to find itself a moveslot among Nidoking's other excellent coverage moves.</p> <p>Thunder Wave and Helping Hand support is greatly appreciated; the former allows Nidoking to outspeed naturally faster opponents, while the latter gives him even more power. Cresselia is an excellent teammate, as it can provide this support and set up Trick Room for Nidoking. Steel-type partners are nice, as they are able to sponge most attacks that Nidoking is weak to. Bronzong stands out, as it can also use Hypnosis to cripple an opponent in addition to providing key resistances. Latios and Garchomp are major problems for Nidoking, as they can outspeed and OHKO with Psychic and Earthquake, respectively. Nidoking also doesn't like rain very much, as rain teams tend to include Pokemon that pose threats to him, such as Ludicolo, Politoed, and Kingdra. Some great Pokemon that can help beat rain for Nidoking are Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Ludicolo; as an added bonus, most of them have excellent synergy with Nidoking. Out of these, Scizor is most likely the best choice, as it can beat Latios that don't carry Hidden Power Fire. Latias can be very helpful to Nidoking, as she is able to set up dual screens as well as use Helping Hand; she can also help rid Nidoking of Latios.</p>"

  "Poliwrath": {
    "overview": "<p>While often overlooked due to its fellow amphibian—Politoed—acquiring Drizzle as a Dream World ability, Poliwrath is valid Pokemon in VGC in its own right. Sporting two water-related abilities in Swift Swim and Water Absorb, it can function well on a rain team. Poliwrath's unique Water / Fighting typing and respectable movepool allow it to perform both offensive and supportive roles on a team. While its stats may be considered a bit too balanced at times, its exclusive access to having both Belly Drum and Swift Swim should not be overlooked. If you're looking for a risky strategy or a solid support Pokemon, give Poliwrath a try.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Poliwrath's third ability, Damp, can be used to prevent the opponent from using Explosion. However, with the nerf to Explosion in BW, it isn't nearly as potent or common as it was in past years. Poliwrath can run Ice Punch, allowing to it fare better against Dragon-type Pokemon, but keep in mind that Ice Punch in combination with Swift Swim is currently illegal. Low Sweep can be used as an alternative to Brick Break; while it is weaker than Brick Break, Low Sweep's secondary effect is more useful. Payback can allow Poliwrath to strike hard against Latios and Cresselia, both of whom normally take Poliwrath's attacks with ease. Circle Throw can be used to phase out Trick Room users. Rain Dance can be used, allowing Poliwrath to manually set up the rain for the team. Hypnosis can catch the opponent off guard, sending an opponent off to bed, but with only 60% accuracy it is a risky move to use. Lastly, Encore can be used by Poliwrath as a way to disrupt the opponent, locking them into their previously used move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As long as Poliwrath hasn't set up, or lacks rain on the battlefield, it isn't too difficult to deal with. Electric-type Pokemon, Zapdos and Rotom-W in particular, don't take too much from Poliwrath's attacks and can zap it with Thunderbolt. Other Swift Swim users, such as Ludicolo and Kingdra, will always outrun Poliwrath and can hit it hard with Giga Drain or Draco Meteor respectively. Dragon-type Pokemon such as Latios, Salamence, and Latias resist all of Poliwrath's main offensive moves, allowing them to reliably take on the fighting frog, as long as it hasn't used Belly Drum. Lastly, Jellicent is immune to both of Poliwrath's STAB moves, and cannot be harmed if Poliwrath does not run Earthquake. Don't get overconfident, though; resisting Poliwrath's main attacks doesn't stop Poliwrath from supporting its ally with either Helping Hand or Icy Wind.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<p>Poliwrath is neither particularly fast nor hard-hitting, but these problems can be alleviated after a bit of setup. By using Belly Drum, Poliwrath skyrockets to a whopping 600 Attack, and with Swift Swim it will outrun just about anything in the rain. Waterfall is Poliwrath's primary STAB move, dealing extra damage with the rain up. Brick Break acts as a secondary STAB move, providing decent coverage when used in tandem with Waterfall. Earthquake can be used instead of Brick Break, offering Poliwrath a way to hit multiple targets after powering up, it also allows Poliwrath to take down Amoonguss and Jellicent after a Belly Drum, in exchange for the ability to KO Ludicolo and Abomasnow. Lastly, Protect allows Poliwrath to stop and scout incoming attacks that will likely be directed at it.</p> <p>84 Speed EVs provide Poliwrath with 101 Speed, allowing it to outrun positive natured base 130 Speed Pokemon in the rain. 168 HP EVs keep Poliwrath's HP as an even number, allowing its Sitrus Berry to activate immediately upon the usage of Belly Drum. The remainder of the EVs go into maximizing Poliwrath's Attack, while the leftover few EVs go into its remaining defenses. Belly Drum is a risky strategy, and might require a bit of team effort to pull off successfully. If you feel that it is too risky, Belly Drum can be replaced with Earthquake, and its Sitrus Berry swapped out for a Life Orb, Water Gem or Fighting Gem, transforming Poliwrath into a simple rain sweeper.</p> <p>Even at +6 Attack, Poliwrath will not OHKO everything in sight; Pokemon such as Latios and Metagross have a chance to survive, while Latias and Cresselia can survive Poliwrath's attack with some room to spare. However, the story changes if it is raining, as all of the mentioned Pokemon will be crushed under the might of a +6 Waterfall in the rain.</p> <p>Poliwrath will often require either rain or Tailwind support in order to do some real sweeping; without one of them, it simply isn't fast enough. Thundurus and Politoed are good Pokemon to accompany Poliwrath, as they can get the rain up fairly easily. Since Belly Drum cuts a bit into Poliwrath's chances of survival, it is likely that it will need some extra support to bring itself up to +6. Follow Me or Rage Powder users, such as Togekiss and Amoonguss, respectively, can make it a lot easier to execute Belly Drum successfully. Likewise, Pokemon with Fake Out, such as Hitmontop or Ludicolo, can stop threats to Poliwrath as it sets itself up.</p>"
      },
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>This Poliwrath is designed to play a supportive role on a team. Waterfall and Brick Break allow Poliwrath to show a bit of offensive presence, utilizing its unique Water / Fighting typing to its advantage. Icy Wind slows the opposing team down, allowing slower Pokemon to gain an upper hand in the battle. Helping Hand allows Poliwrath to strengthen its ally's attacks, which is especially useful if its ally runs Surf. Protect may be used instead of Helping Hand, allowing Poliwrath to defend itself from attacks if needed.</p> <p>Poliwrath's EVs allow it to survive a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor from a Timid Latios. The remainder of the EVs are then placed into Attack to add more power to its moves. Holding a Sitrus Berry further improves upon Poliwrath's survivability, but a type-resist berry, such as a Wacan or Coba Berry, can act as acceptable substitutes.</p> <p>Due to having Water Absorb, a partner that runs Surf, such as Ludicolo or Politoed, can be effective, as Poliwrath can heal itself from the attack while it deals significant damage against its foes, especially after a Helping Hand boost. Other Pokemon with powerful spread moves, such as Abomasnow or Chandelure, can also work well, as Poliwrath can either power up their attacks with Helping Hand or slow down the opponents with Icy Wind, allowing its partner to outrun the opponents.</p>"

It boasts an excellent supporting movepool along with a great base 135 Special Attack and base 120 Speed, letting it outspeed the likes of Choice Scarf Abomasnow. However, Alakazam lacks physical bulk and requires support from its teammates to stay alive and be effective in battle. Alakazam was given a gift this generation in the form of Magic Guard, which allows it to utilize Life Orb for extra power without worrying about recoil damage, as well as avoid indirect damage. Unfortunately, Alakazam lacks a usable spread move that most other special attackers possess. Nonetheless, Alakazam is still a strong offensive force that can wreck the opponent one Pokemon at a time.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Alakazam has a vast movepool and several decent abilities, giving it plenty of possible options to run. A Choice Scarf allows even Modest Alakazam to reach a staggering Speed of 258, which outpaces Choice Scarf users with base 102 Speed or less. If running Choice Scarf, Trick should be used over Protect. Trick can also be used on a Flame Orb set to cripple the physical attackers that Alakazam hates. In terms of other attacking options, Hidden Power Ice secures super effective coverage on Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Salamence, and also hits Thundurus and Zapdos hard. Energy Ball and Grass Knot are other offensive options to hit Water- and Ground-types, along with the likes of Jellicent and Tyranitar. Telekinesis Alakazam pairs well with users of Zap Cannon, Inferno, and Dynamic Punch, such as Porygon-Z, Chandelure, and Metagross. Gravity has a similar effect, except that it affects the whole field and renders all opponents vulnerable to Ground-types moves. Thunder Wave and Swagger are good status-inducing moves that allow slower teammates to outspeed and possibly KO the opponent. Alakazam can also run support moves such as Light Screen, Reflect, Safeguard, and Taunt; however, this can be better done by many other Pokemon, such as Cresselia and Sableye. Ally Switch is a neat move that can allow Alakazam to switch out its partner and absorb Will-O-Wisp or a resisted hit. Skill Swap may uses with Pokemon such as Slaking and Regigigas, but it is highly situational in order for it to work properly.</p> <p>Inner Focus can prevent Fake Out from leaving Alakazam vulnerable for one turn. With Inner Focus, Alakazam also regains access to Move Tutor moves from previous generations, such as Counter, Signal Beam, and Role Play. However, these moves are not very significant, making Magic Guard a better overall choice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Physical priority moves such as Bullet Punch and Sucker Punch are the bane of Alakazam’s existence, as they hit it on its weaker Defense stat and potentially break its Focus Sash. Pokemon such as Scizor, Tyranitar, and Escavalier can be very problematic if Alakazam lacks Focus Blast. The blisteringly fast Alakazam absolutely hates Trick Room, where the vast majority of the metagame outspeeds it. Thunder Wave users also cripple Alakazam's sweeping abilities by cutting its tremendous Speed stat to nothing and potentially leaving it fully paralyzed. Weavile is a good check that can easily outspeed Alakazam and OHKO with Night Slash.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Psychic is Alakazam's STAB move of choice, which hits Fighting- and Poison-types for a huge amount of damage. Psyshock is equally notable for being only slightly weaker, but it is able to nail specially defensive Pokemon Blissey and Virizion for greater damage. Shadow Ball allows Alakazam to hit other Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Latios and Jellicent, both of whom it outspeeds and can KO after some previous damage. Focus Blast gives Alakazam excellent neutral coverage by hitting Dark- and Steel-types, such as Tyranitar and Scizor, who would otherwise wall Alakazam and easily OHKO with Crunch and Bug Bite, respectively. Hidden Power Fire can be used to gain super effective coverage on Steel- and Grass-types, such as Scizor, Escavalier, and Metagross, at the cost of super effective coverage on Tyranitar. Protect insures Alakazam for one turn, allowing its teammates to rid the field of possible threats. Substitute is equally viable thanks to Alakazam’s excellent Speed; it can often put up a Substitute before the opposing Pokemon can attack. With Substitute, Alakazam can also set up on Sucker Punch, survive a subsequent hit, and KO the Sucker Punch user.</p> <p>Life Orb is an excellent item for Alakazam as it does not have to worry about recoil. Focus Sash is a viable option too, as it allows Alakazam to survive a hit and retaliate. A Timid nature allows Alakazam to outspeed many common threats in the metagame, such as Choice Scarf Jellicent and Abomasnow. Magic Guard is an excellent ability as it prevents residual damage; such as weather recoil, Life Orb recoil, and status ailments.</p> <p>Alakazam is quite the glass cannon, so it should simply aim to hit as hard and fast as possible. Therefore, an EV spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe is optimum. When running Hidden Power Fire, use an EV spread of 8 HP / 252 SpA / 248 Spe to avoid wasting EVs. If you just want to outspeed base 60 Speed Choice Scarf users, such as Abomasnow and Jellicent, an EV spread of 28 HP / 252 SpA / 228 Spe puts Alakazam ahead of them by one point. Hidden Power Fighting can be used over Focus Blast for a more reliable way to hit Dark- and Steel-types, though the drop in power is extremely noticeable. Encore and Disable are usable options as well. The former can force Fake Out users out to switch and Trick Room setters to undo their own Trick Room, while the latter gives Alakazam another way of beating Sucker Punch users. Additionally, it allows Alakazam to Disable spread moves used the turn before.</p> <p>Thanks to Magic Guard, Alakazam finds itself on most teams as a fast, strong late-game cleaner. Especially notable is the fact that it takes no recoil from hail or sand, making it an excellent choice for a weather team. Follow Me and Rage Powder users give Alakazam tons of support by letting it attack without worrying about being KOed by threats such as Tyranitar and Scizor. Most notably, they remove the threat of priority moves KOing Alakazam before it can move. Pokemon with access to Quick Guard, such as Terrakion and Virizion, make good partners by being able to block priority moves and provide Fighting-type coverage if Alakazam lacks Focus Blast or Hidden Power Fighting. Wide Guard users can block strong spread moves such as Rock Slide and Earthquake, and are appreciated as well. A great user of Wide Guard and Quick Guard is Hitmontop, who can not only provide Wide Guard protection, but also support from Fake Out, Intimidate, and strong priority moves such as Mach Punch and Sucker Punch. Priority attackers of your own pair well with Alakazam to finish off Pokemon that it barely misses KOs on, such as Latios and Jellicent. Helping Hand users also enable Alakazam to OHKO Latios and Choice Scarf Jellicent with Shadow Ball. Tailwind support can allow Alakazam to outspeed almost everything, including all common Choice Scarf users.</p>"

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<p>Zapdos's excellent typing and bulk allows it to check a multitude of common physical attackers such as Metagross and Garchomp. However, Zapdos distinguishes itself from other bulky Pokemon with its excellent offensive prowess; it features good Speed, high Special Attack, and excellent coverage. Although it might at first seem outclassed by Thundurus, Zapdos's greater bulk and access to Tailwind and Heat Wave keep it distinct from the genie. Unfortunately, Zapdos is weak to common spread attacks, such as Rock Slide and Blizzard, and it's also slower than several common threats, such as Latios, Weavile, and Terrakion. Overall, thanks to its bulk and power, Zapdos works well as part of a DisQuake duo, a rain attacker, a check to rain teams, or on a goodstuff team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roost can let Zapdos stall out slower Rock Slides and Blizzards, allowing it to take better advantage of its multitude of resistances and good bulk. Rain Dance provides insurance if Politoed gets KOed, and can replace Detect or Heat Wave. Thunder Wave can help to slow down an opponent and the chance of full paralysis is handy, but Tailwind is often more useful and reliable. Roar can stop even Mental Herb users from setting up Trick Room, which is especially useful as Zapdos usually has trouble against most Trick Room teams. Light Screen doesn't have any specific use, but supports the team and allows Zapdos to take Blizzards more easily.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Rotom-H is a perfect counter to Zapdos; it resists any attack Zapdos can use, and can 2HKO with Thunderbolt and Overheat. Tyranitar can take any attack and do severe damage in return with Rock Slide. Abomasnow has to watch out for Heat Wave, but it resists Thunderbolt and takes little damage from Hidden Power Ice. In return, Focus Sash and Occa Berry variants can easily do huge damage or even KO Zapdos with Blizzard, while Choice Scarf Abomasnow outspeeds and does severe damage before Zapdos can attack. Weavile outspeeds and does great damage with Ice Punch, possibly OHKOing as well. Terrakion doesn't take too much damage from any attack, and easily outspeeds and 2HKOes Zapdos with Rock Slide. Rhyperior is hurt by Hidden Power Ice and is OHKOed by Hidden Power Grass if lacking Solid Rock, but does huge damage in return with Rock Slide. Archeops can't switch into Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Ice, but maims Zapdos with Rock Slide. Latios is also an excellent check, as it outspeeds Zapdos and can shrug off Hidden Power Ice while OHKOing back with a Life Orb- or Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor. In addition, Latios can't be baited by a resist Berry, unlike Abomasnow or Weavile; it has to watch out for bulkier variants with Thunder Wave or Tailwind, however. Specially defensive Latias and Blissey take very little from any attack, but must watch out for Toxic, which cripples them both.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice have excellent coverage when used together, as Hidden Power Ice 2HKOes most of the Pokemon that resist Thunderbolt, such as Latios. Discharge can be used over Thunderbolt, as it is a spread attack and works well when paired with Earthquake, forming the well-known DisQuake combination. However, it is less powerful than Thunderbolt on a single target. If Zapdos is being used on a rain team, Hidden Power Grass can be used to deal with Swampert and Gastrodon, as the latter is a common check to rain teams. Heat Wave OHKOes Abomasnow and does severe damage to Ferrothorn, while doing slightly more damage to Metagross than Thunderbolt does. Detect allows Zapdos to avoid damage for a turn and lets its partner KO a threat. As an added plus, Imprison users such as Uxie will also not prevent Zapdos from using Detect, due to its limited distribution. Tailwind is also an option in the last moveslot, as it allows Zapdos to surprise weather teams and goodstuff teams with faster Pokemon.</p> <p>Zapdos can use a variety of EV spreads, as its excellent natural bulk allows it to survive almost any attack with the right spread. The given EV spread allows it to outspeed Adamant Mamoswine, uninvested Chandelure, and maximum Speed Metagross, while giving it some good bulk as well. Dropping down to 32 Speed EVs and putting the remaining EVs into Defense gives Zapdos much more bulk, but still allows it to outrun 252+ Abomasnow, as well as uninvested Metagross and Politoed. If running Hidden Power Grass, the EV spread should be changed to 140 HP / 4 Def / 248 SpA / 116 Spe to account for the IV drop, although the extra 4 EVs can go into Special Defense if wanted. Zapdos's choice of item can also influence its choice of EV spread; while Sitrus Berry makes Zapdos more difficult to 2HKO, Charti Berry helps it take Rock Slides more easily, while Yache Berry allows it to brace a Blizzard. Electric Gem powers up Thunderbolt or Thunder, which can be very useful in certain situations. Speaking of Thunder, it is also an option in the first slot if Zapdos is used on a rain team for the added power and accuracy it brings to the table. For example, Electric Gem Thunder OHKOes 4 HP Terrakion.</p> <p>Fake Out users such as Mienshao, Scrafty, Hitmontop, and Infernape make it easier for Zapdos to set up Tailwind, and thus are great partners. As Rock- and Ice-types can take advantage of Zapdos's weaknesses, a Fighting-type partner such as Toxicroak or Scrafty can prove very useful, as it can hit both these types for super effective damage, and can take advantage of Tailwind as well. Metagross also makes a solid partner as it resists all attacks that hit Zapdos for super effective damage, and can OHKO the likes of Abomasnow and Tyranitar.</p>"

  "Typhlosion": {
    "overview": "<p>Typhlosion seems to be a fairly average Pokemon, with relatively low defensive stats and no superb offensive stats either. On top of this, it has weaknesses to Earthquake, Surf, and Rock Slide, three incredibly common attacks in VGC 2012. However, being one of five VGC legal Pokemon that have access to STAB Eruption, Typhlosion is a pretty cool pick for any respectable sun team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Typhlosion can use a type-resist Berry, such as Shuca Berry or Charti Berry, to alleviate some of the damage from Earthquake and Rock Slide, respectively. Typhlosion can also make use of a Choice Scarf for some more Speed; Choice Scarf Typhlosion hits 250 Speed, outspeeding Metagross, Latios, Gengar, and Swift Swim Ludicolo, among others. Overheat is yet another option, as it hits incredibly hard in the sun, but the drop in Special Attack can be a hindrance. Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Dragon-type Pokemon for heavy damage as well.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Tyranitar can counter Typhlosion fairly well, because specially defensive variants can survive SolarBeam, and it can injure or OHKO Typhlosion with STAB Rock Slide, depending on its Attack investment. Rhyperior can counter Typhlosion under Trick Room, and those who change the weather on Typhlosion can also beat it. In general, Trick Room teams hit Typhlosion pretty hard, as its base 100 Speed and Timid nature means it will easily be outpaced under the effects of Trick Room. Rain teams can also cause trouble for Typhlosion, who relies heavily on harsh sunlight for its power. Latios and Latias can check Typhlosion well, as they survive its powerful Eruption and can hit back hard with their STAB Dragon-type attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set makes use of Typhlosion's power in the sun. STAB Eruption is Typhlosion's primary attacking option, and inflicts massive damage to all Pokemon, even ones that resist Fire-type attacks. However, as its damage output depends on Typhlosion's health, Heat Wave is a secondary STAB option for when Typhlosion is at low HP. SolarBeam and Hidden Power Ground grant Typhlosion coverage on Pokemon that can take an Eruption, such as Tyranitar, Rhyperior, and Heatran, hitting them for super effective damage. If running Hidden Power Ground, the EVs should be changed to 4 HP / 4 Def / 248 SpA / 252 Spe to account for the IV drop. Protect lets Typhlosion avoid damage from both its opponents and its ally for a turn.</p> <p>Without sun, Typhlosion is fairly lacking. Eruption doesn't do as much as one might expect, as many Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame resist Fire-type attacks. As Eruption is Typhlosion's main selling point, it really doesn't stand much of a chance without proper sun support. Weaknesses to many common spread moves don't do Typhlosion any favors either, so it is often rendered useless if opposing auto-weather starters are able to win the weather war.</p> <p>As mentioned before, Typhlosion absolutely needs sun support. However, Ninetales, who sets up sun with its Drought ability, shares the same weaknesses as Typhlosion. It can therefore be a little dangerous to have both on the same team, but when you take into account all the Grass-types that have the Chlorophyll ability, a sun team can come together fairly nicely. Typhlosion also loves Tailwind support, as its base 100 Speed isn't too great. With Tailwind up, Typhlosion outspeeds many common threats and can deal tons of damage in the sun. Whimsicott is a great partner, because Prankster grants it priority on both Tailwind and Sunny Day should Ninetales lose the weather war or faint.</p> <p>What people often underestimate is how hard Typhlosion can hit. In the sun, Fire Gem Eruption can KO almost all of the commonly seen Pokemon, making Typhlosion a truly dangerous Pokemon. To back this statement up, here are some damage calculations showcasing Eruption's power.</p> <ul> <li>Eruption vs. 4/0 Latios 75% - 88.5%</li> <li>Eruption vs. 252/0 Hitmontop 149.7% - 176.4%</li> <li>Eruption vs. 4/0 Garchomp 78.3% - 92.9%</li> <li>Eruption vs. 252/252 Cresselia 74% - 87.2%</li> </ul> <p>Even though Typhlosion is able to hit hard, it doesn't take hits well. Rhyperior can shrug off Hidden Power Ground and OHKO with Earthquake; in fact, any Pokemon Typhlosion fails to KO can often take it out or cripple it. Cresselia survives Eruption and can set up Trick Room, which can often mean trouble for your team, especially if you have Tailwind up. Additionally, Typhlosion appreciates partners that can clean up for it, as well as Helping Hand support, which can let it nab OHKOs it would normally miss out on.</p>"

It provides Togetic with a respectable increase of bulk over Togekiss, but in return, Togetic is much weaker offensively, as it loses Air Slash and Aura Sphere, in addition to having a meager base 80 Special Attack. However, this does give Togetic an incentive to run a full support moveset without any offense. If you find that your team requires some heavy-duty Follow Me support, you might want to give Togetic a try.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Helping Hand can be used with Togetic, allowing Togetic to power up its ally's moves. However, as with Tri Attack, it is a special move from Pokemon Colosseum, and may not be easily obtainable on cart. Encore can be used to disrupt the opponent; however, its usefulness is limited due to Togetic's low Speed. Headbutt can allow Togetic to take advantage of Serene Grace, flinching the opponent 60% of the time after they are paralyzed. Endeavor can give Togetic a way to do some surprise damage to an opponent when it is low on health.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Togetic almost exclusively acts as support for its team, redirecting attacks away from its ally, or aiding in Speed control by using Tailwind or Thunder Wave. Therefore, hard-hitters are needed in order to get it off the field as soon as possible. Pokemon with Electric-type moves, such as Zapdos and Rotom-A, are best for the job, as they hit Togetic hard with super effective attacks. Pokemon with Lightningrod, such as Manectric, can take things a step further by preventing Togetic from crippling their teammates with Thunder Wave. Finally, spread moves such as Blizzard, Discharge, and Heat Wave can bypass Follow Me and reduce Togetic's supportive function.</p> <p>If brute force isn't your style, Taunt will stop Togetic from using any of its supporting moves, possibly forcing it to use Struggle. Likewise, Tricking Togetic a Choice Scarf will also shut it down by restricting it to a single move and stripping it of its Eviolite boost. Lastly, any Pokemon that has Final Gambit can completely ignore Togetic's sizable defenses and OHKO it at the expense of their own life, provided that they have at least 162 HP remaining.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Follow Me Support": {
        "description": "<p>Togetic's main goal is to use Follow Me to draw attention away from its partner. Tri Attack provides Togetic with an offensive option; while it might not do much damage, it has an attractive 40% chance of causing a random status effect due to Serene Grace. Thunder Wave allows Togetic to cripple targets with paralysis, providing an opportunity for its ally to attack. Alternatively, Tailwind may be used as a method of boosting your teammates' Speed in battle. Either Roost or Protect should be used in Togetic's final moveslot. Roost allows Togetic to heal itself so as to last longer as a support Pokemon. Protect blocks oncoming attacks, which can be helpful if the opponent becomes too focused on trying to take Togetic out.</p> <p>The EVs allow Togetic to survive an Electric Gem-boosted Thunderbolt from a Modest Zapdos. The remainder of the EVs are placed into Defense to give it a bit more physical bulk. As Togetic's offense is quite lackluster, you can opt to replace Tri Attack with another support move, such as Charm or Light Screen. Alternatively, Togetic can use Heat Wave over Tri Attack as it hits both targets and has a 20% chance to burn the opponent. This is especially handy if Togetic is run on a Trick Room team, as Tri Attack might paralyze the foe, which is counterproductive. Likewise, Tailwind or Thunder Wave should be replaced if Togetic is run on a Trick Room team.</p> <p>Pokemon that require a bit of setup to become a serious threat, such as Volcarona, Snorlax, and Gorebyss, appreciate the free turns Togetic's Follow Me can buy them. Likewise, Trick Room users such as Reuniclus and Chandelure have a much easier time twisting the dimensions with Togetic's Follow Me support. Unfortunately, Togetic's low Speed means that it is outrun by just about every single Fake Out user there is. As it is unable to redirect the opponent's Fake Out, one must still be wary of opposing Fake Out users when using Togetic.</p>"

  "Azumarill": {
    "overview": "<p>Azumarill is by far one of the cutest Pokemon that can be used in VGC 2012. However, Azumarill has more than just cuteness on its side; it has an ability that most Pokemon would die for in Huge Power. With Huge Power, Azumarill's Attack is boosted by 50%, and with a great offensive typing in Water, it can take advantage of this very well. However, Game Freak felt that the cute rabbit needed even more power, so in DPP, they gave Azumarill Aqua Jet, a great priority move for Azumarill. Thanks to Aqua Jet, Azumarill can nail faster common Fire-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon, such as Terrakion, Volcarona, and Mamoswine. Azumarill's 100 / 80 / 80 defenses mean that it can take a hit as well, and with only two weaknesses, Azumarill can last a while. However, this is where it all ends for Azumarill. With base 50 Speed, Azumarill is painfully slow, though Aqua Jet somewhat remedies this. There are Pokemon such as Jellicent that wall Azumarill completely, meaning that there is a limit to Azumarill's usefulness. One of the perks to using Azumarill is that it is a rabbit. Imagine sweeping your opponents with a rabbit.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Azumarill's movepool is really shallow, though it has a few more options it can use. Return has good overall coverage with Azumarill's Water STAB, though the given coverage moves usually work better. Aqua Tail can be used instead of Waterfall for more power; the accuracy is a turn off, however. Azumarill also has a decent support movepool, with moves such as Encore, Light Screen, and Perish Song; Azumarill, however, is at its best using its huge Attack to offensively pressure the opponent. There are also several items Azumarill that can use. Life Orb boosts Azumarill's attacks, and also allows Azumarill to switch attacks, though the recoil makes Azumarill faint faster. Water Gem can also be used for a powerful Aqua Jet, which can be game changing in taking out faster threats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>If your team has problems with Azumarill, just add a Jellicent. Jellicent is immune to Azumarill's Water-type attacks, thanks to Water Absorb, and is also immune to Superpower and resistant to Ice Punch. Other Water-type Pokemon, such as Slowbro, Slowking, and Gyarados, also take little from its attacks; the former is resistant to all of Azumarill's attacks, while the latter has Intimidate to lower Azumarill's Attack. Zapdos and Rotom-W make great checks, as both can take an Aqua Jet and OHKO Choice Band variants with their Electric STABs. Basically, bulky Water-types and Grass-types can beat Azumarill. Finally, Dusclops and Sableye both have Will-O-Wisp, as the former is bulky enough to take a Waterfall, while the latter has priority to burn Azumarill before it can attack.</p>",

Aqua Jet is the vital move of this set, allowing Azumarill to nail faster Pokemon such as Infernape, Excadrill, Landorus, as well as several other Pokemon. Waterfall hits harder than Aqua Jet, and gives Azumarill a STAB move to use when Aqua Jet doesn't get the KO. Ice Punch nails Dragon-types, such as Garchomp, Latias, and Hydreigon, which is a plus, considering the latter two resist Aqua Jet. Superpower can be used to hit Abomasnow and Ferrothorn harder than Ice Punch, as well as to hit other Steel-type Pokemon. However, Protect can be used to shield Azumarill from opposing attacks, keeping it alive for later in the match.</p> <p>The Speed EVs are used to make sure Azumarill outpaces 0 Speed Tyranitar. Maximum Attack EVs are used to make the most of Huge Power. The remainder are used in HP to make Azumarill bulkier. However, there are other EV spreads Azumarill can use; an EV spread of 84 HP / 252 Atk / 172 Spe can be used to outspeed base 70s, though the loss of bulk is significant. 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD with 0 Speed IVs make Azumarill usable in Trick Room thanks to its low base 50 Speed. The choice of item is up to what the team needs; with a Choice Band, Azumarill's Attack will skyrocket, though this means Azumarill is locked into one attack. Wacan Berry, however, can be used to sponge Electric-type attacks from Zapdos and Thundurus, giving Azumarill time to KO with Waterfall and Aqua Jet.</p> <p>Azumarill, as it cannot nail Pokemon such as Jellicent, needs support to be effective. Thus, teammates that can beat Pokemon such as Jellicent and Electric-types are useful. Zapdos is a good example, as it has Hidden Power Ice or Flying to deal with Grass-types, and a STAB Thunderbolt to deal with Jellicent. Another good partner is Tyranitar, as the Special Defense boost thanks to sandstorm means it can take Electric-type attacks. However, sandstorm damage takes a toll on Azumarill. Dragon-type Pokemon, such as Hydreigon, also make great partners, as they can nail Jellicent and resist Grass- and Electric-type attacks. Partners with Lightningrod also help, though most, such as Raichu and Zebstrika, are really frail. Thunder Wave support is a must for Azumarill to outspeed Pokemon such as Latios and Weavile; Cresselia is a prime example, as it is bulky enough to use Thunder Wave multiple times.</p>"

Upon closer inspection, however, one can see that Jumpluff has some niche thanks to its great ability, Chlorophyll, and a fantastic movepool to take advantage of this. All is not well for Jumpluff, unfortunately, as a weakness to the three very common spread moves, Blizzard, Heat Wave, and Rock Slide, keeps it from realizing its true potential as a sun-abusing supporter.

While sun may help Jumpluff, it also powers up opposing Pokemon's Fire-type moves, which shred Jumpluff to pieces. Zapdos and Chandelure in particular can utilize powerful Heat Waves to take down Jumpluff. Pokemon utilizing the Prankster ability, such as Thundurus and Whimsicott, can use a priority Taunt to stop Jumpluff from getting off its deadly Sleep Powder, and force a Giga Drain-less Jumpluff to Struggle for damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Chlorophyll Supporter": {
        "description": "<p>The lack of Sleep Clause in VGC allows a huge amount of Pokemon to abuse Sleep Powder and Spore; Jumpluff is one of these said Pokemon. What really sets Jumpluff apart from the rest is its ability, Chlorophyll, which doubles its Speed in the sun; this set takes full advantage of it by supporting its team with a variety of support moves.</p> <p>With Sleep Powder, Jumpluff is able to neuter the opponent's Pokemon by rendering it unable to attack for several turns. Encore can lock foes into non-damaging moves or one-time use moves such as Fake Out, forcing a switch and keeping the opponent on their toes. Those two moves are critical to Jumpluff's success, and as such, are mandatory, but the remaining two can be a combination of Rage Powder, Helping Hand, Giga Drain, or Protect. Rage Powder is generally the first choice; it provides cover for Jumpluff's partner by attracting all moves to Jumpluff for a turn while Jumpluff's teammate eliminates any threats. However, a teammate may need a little extra \"oomph\" on its attacks in order to get a KO, which Jumpluff gladly provides with Helping Hand, boosting the power of its partner's attacks. If one is afraid of Taunt, Giga Drain keeps Jumpluff from being complete Taunt bait and allows a little HP to be regained. Protect keeps Jumpluff alive for another turn and gives time for its partner to take care of a problematic Pokemon.</p> <p>Another support option is Stun Spore, which cuts the opponent's Speed by 75% to help give Jumpluff's teammates the upper hand. Memento could be viable as a last-ditch move to neuter a powerful opponent, but Jumpluff is generally better off using Sleep Powder until it is KOed. A SubSeed set looks good on paper, but its weakness to common spread moves keeps this from being utilized effectively. Substitute, however, is usable in its own right, and could be placed in the fourth moveslot if Giga Drain and Protect are unattractive. Sunny Day is useful for setting sun back up if a weather starter is brought in; however, Pokemon that have access to Prankster such as Whimsicott generally perform this job better.</p>"

  "Hitmontop": {
    "overview": "<p>Hitmontop burst onto the scene in VGC 2010, forming one half of the famed \"TopOgre\" combo. While its partner in crime, Kyogre, may be banned this year, Hitmontop is a great Pokemon in its own right. Possessing two amazing abilities, a movepool tailored to its stats, and an excellent typing that provides it with a great Fighting-type STAB, Hitmontop is a staple on any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aerial Ace is a viable option for hitting other Hitmontop, as well as Toxicroak and Shedinja, who give Hitmontop problems otherwise. With the Flying-types that threaten Hitmontop, a Coba Berry may be used to stay alive for another turn; however, Hitmontop has no real way of responding, and therefore, is better suited carrying a Life Orb. A set revolving around a Focus Sash, Endeavor, and Mach Punch could be used, but it is more of a gimmick than an actual set. Hitmontop also has access to Rock Slide, but there are far better Pokemon that receive this move, such as Terrakion and Garchomp. Feint is a nifty move, providing another Technician-boosted priority move that has the ability to break an opponent's Protect, and is worth consideration on the first set. Helping Hand can also work on the supportive set in place of Wide Guard or Detect. Of note is Dark Gem too, which gives Hitmontop a chance to OHKO Latios with Sucker Punch, as well as dealing more damage to Cresselia. Hitmontop also gets the ability of Steadfast, but is often useless for Hitmontop as it hardly ever gets flinched and it would miss out on previous generation tutor moves like Sucker Punch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Flying-types such as Tornadus and Thundurus take little damage from Hitmontop's assaults, and hit back hard with their own STAB moves. Psychic-types, Cresselia and Metagross in particular, make Hitmontop's life a living hell. Metagross completely ignores Intimidate with Clear Body and can OHKO with Zen Headbutt while Cresselia takes little from even a super effective Sucker Punch and destroys Hitmontop with Psychic. Latios too, can survive a Sucker Punch and fire off a STAB Psychic or Psyshock, OHKOing Hitmontop. With Intimidate and a Fighting-type resistance, Gyarados performs extremely well in countering Hitmontop.</p>",

      "Intimidate Support": {
        "description": "<p>A Fighting Gem is used alongside Close Combat or Mach Punch for a one-time powerful Fighting-type move. To keep Hitmontop in top condition, a Sitrus Berry can be used instead and helps greatly with Hitmontop's longevity. A third, unlisted option to consider is an Eject Button. With an Eject Button, both Intimidate and Fake Out are re-usable, allowing for more disruption. However, be warned that an untimely Eject Button activation can spell your doom if a faster opponent activates it before a crucial Close Combat. As with most support sets, maximum investment in HP keeps Hitmontop alive and kicking throughout the game, while 252 EVs are placed in Attack to allow it to hit hard with its attacks.</p> <p>Weavile has excellent synergy with this set, as Hitmontop shields it from the common spread moves that threaten it in Heat Wave and Rock Slide while also decreasing the damage Fighting-type moves do to Weavile through Intimidate. Likewise, Weavile aids Hitmontop by eliminating the Flying- and Psychic-type threats which cause Hitmontop grief with their STAB attacks.</p>"

      "Priority Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Technician boosts all moves that have a Base Power of 60 or less, allowing Hitmontop to utilize priority moves to the fullest. Fake Out prevents opponents from setting up and makes them a sitting duck for a turn; this gives Hitmontop's partner the opportunity to set up something of its own or KO the foe that poses a threat to Hitmontop. A STAB-, Technician-, and Life Orb-boosted Mach Punch deals out massive amounts of damage to almost everything it touches, and is the main drawing point for this set. Pokemon that resist Mach Punch, however, such as Latios and Zapdos, give Hitmontop problems, and Sucker Punch provides the perfect counter against these foes. As a priority Dark-type move, Sucker Punch is also the perfect solution to any Psychic-type threats that threaten Hitmontop with their powerful STAB attacks. Detect provides Hitmontop with a way to stay alive for an additional crucial turn, while its partner takes care of a threatening foe. Detect may be unnecessary, however, and in this case Wide Guard provides a suitable option. Spread moves such as Heat Wave and Rock Slide run rampant in doubles, and Wide Guard blocks these moves, keeping Hitmontop's teammates alive.</p> <p>A Life Orb boosts Hitmontop's already-powerful attacks even further, and Sucker Punch welcomes the rise in power, as it is not boosted by Technician. All of Hitmontop's attacks are priority-based moves and therefore, only a minimum amount of EVs are invested in Speed while maximum investment in HP and Attack secure Hitmontop's place on the field as a bulky attacker.</p> <p>Hitmontop's skills as a powerful priority user are much in need, allowing it to fit on a variety of different teams. Trick Room teams benefit from the Fake Out support Hitmontop brings to the table, allowing Trick Room to be set up without hindrance. Likewise, Tailwind and goodstuff teams appreciate the extra time given by Hitmontop with Fake Out.</p>"

  "Blaziken": {
    "overview": "<p>With the addition of Dream World, Blaziken received an excellent ability in Speed Boost, which turns it into a potent offensive threat. Its amazing offensive typing makes it a great choice to lead with; just watch out for the common rain teams in the VGC 2012 metagame. However, Blaziken works best with sun support, as it can wreak havoc with its sun-boosted Fire-type STAB. With weather teams being so common in this metagame, Blaziken's dual STABs allow it to hit hail and sandstorm starters as well as bulky Steel-types, such as Bronzong and Metagross, for super effective damage, paving the way for its teammates to set up weather of their own and sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Blaziken has a few other options to consider. A special set with 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe is a viable option. Choice Band is an item to consider if you feel Blaziken's Attack isn't high enough, but it is not nearly as good as Life Orb. Fire Gem can be used to fire off a single powerful Flare Blitz which can OHKO almost everything that does not resist it, if used in the sun. Swords Dance can surprise opponents expecting Protect on turn 1; Blaziken will be at +2 Attack and +1 Speed at the end of the turn. Work Up is another set-up move to consider, as it works well on a mixed set. Brave Bird is an option for additional coverage, but the recoil damage can bring Blaziken down fast. Lastly, Sunny Day can be used to activate the sun, but Ninetales does this job better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Blaziken doesn't have many counters if it's used in the sun because sun-boosted Flare Blitz will 2HKO almost all Pokemon in the tier, including Pokemon that resist it. Bulky Water-types can take a hit in the rain easily and OHKO back with their STAB moves. Rain teams in general check Blaziken very well. When not used in the sun, Blaziken has a few hard counters such as Jellicent and Gliscor; they can take any of its attacks and proceed to KO Blaziken with a super effective move. Trick Room users, such as Reuniclus, take down Blaziken with ease, as they can use its high Speed to their advantage and KO it with a powerful move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>The initial goal is to use Protect on turn one, which provides a free turn for Blaziken's Speed Boost ability to activate, allowing it to outspeed a large number of threats. Flare Blitz is Blaziken's strongest STAB, and dents hail teams and Fire-weak Pokemon such as Metagross and Abomasnow. Hi Jump Kick can be used for secondary STAB, but because many Pokemon in the VGC metagame carry Protect, Sky Uppercut is preferred for its reliability. Rock Slide and Shadow Claw provide extra coverage; the former hits Fire- and Flying-types for super effective damage, while the latter covers Ghost-types. However, Rock Slide is generally the better option because it hits both opposing Pokemon simultaneously, and has a nifty flinch rate as well.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is preferred over Jolly because Speed Boost increases Blaziken's Speed, reducing the need to use a positive Speed nature. Blaziken can also OHKO Abomasnow and Tyranitar that do not carry a Chople Berry, two very common Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame. If you wish to use a mixed set, an alternative EV spread of 252 Atk / 48 SpA / 208 Spe can be used with Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Electric; Hidden Power Ice can 2HKO Garchomp even if it holds Yache Berry, while Hidden Power Electric can 2HKO Wacan Berry Gyarados.</p> <p>Ninetales is certainly one of the best teammates Blaziken could ask for, as it has the ability to summon permanent sun. A max Attack, sun-boosted Flare Blitz can OHKO or 2HKO almost every Pokemon in the metagame, including those that resist it. As Blaziken has a lot of trouble with rain teams, Ferrothorn makes an excellent teammate; it can take all the Water-type attacks aimed at Blaziken and retaliate with a powerful STAB Power Whip. Sunny Day users are also good teammates. Priority support is very helpful as well; Weavile is a good teammate in this case.</p>"

  "Swampert": {
    "overview": "<p>Swampert has always been a down-to-earth Pokemon, never receiving the many technical or crafty moves its competition has. Swampert's nice coverage and well-rounded stats are usually overshadowed either by Pokemon with neat abilities, such as Gastrodon, or Pokemon that have a similar typing but can hit harder, such as Rhyperior and Kabutops. However, Swampert has one move its competitors cannot use: Wide Guard. With this small perk in its movepool, Swampert maintains a niche as a reliable Wide Guard user that resists common spread moves and lacks Psychic-, Ice- and Flying-type weaknesses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swampert's movepool is quite shallow, but it does have a few options to consider. Hammer Arm has a nice 100 Base Power and raises Swampert's Speed in Trick Room, but it doesn't hit much that Swampert's STABs don't cover already. Aqua Tail is an option over Waterfall for its higher Base Power, but the slight gain in power is overshadowed by the drop in accuracy. Yawn can put an opponent to sleep, but only works one turn after it is used. However, as your opponent probably isn't going to Protect on the first turn of Yawn, it makes them a little more predictable. Rest + Chesto Berry gives Swampert great one-off instant recovery, which is especially handy thanks to its solid bulk. Muddy Water and Scald can be used if you're feeling lucky, but if you find yourself with some free turns, Waterfall and Earthquake are more useful. Surf is another option, but it lacks a secondary effect, so unless you're running a Pokemon to take advantage of it, such as Toxicroak, it's not worth a moveslot. Ice Punch and Icy Wind are both great moves, but they are unfortunately illegal with Wide Guard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Grass-types are the bane of Swampert's existence, especially Ferrothorn and Breloom. Ferrothorn laughs at any attempt to do damage to it, and has access to Power Whip and Seed Bomb. Breloom can outspeed and KO Swampert with STAB Seed Bomb before Swampert has a chance to move, and can also incapacitate Swampert with Spore. Similarly, sun teams can mop the floor with Swampert with Grass-types such as Shiftry and Sawsbuck. Abomasnow cannot use Blizzard freely around Swampert, but has STAB Grass Knot or Giga Drain to deal with the mudfish. Swampert has a hard time with bulky Water-types, especially those that don't use STAB spread moves. Gyarados and Rotom-W are fine examples of this, as they take almost nothing from Swampert's assaults and can hit through Wide Guard. If you're scared of opposing Wide Guard users, you can opt to use single-target moves such as Stone Edge or Rock Blast instead of Rock Slide, when available.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wide Guardian": {
        "description": "<p>Swampert is a great Wide Guard user, blessed with formidable bulk and an excellent typing that makes Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Conkeldurr jealous. Swampert can take common spread moves such as Blizzard, Rock Slide, and Heat Wave admirably, and the combination of Earthquake and Waterfall makes a great STAB combo. When using Swampert as a lead, keep in mind that Fake Out is in the same priority bracket as Wide Guard, which means that Wide Guard can be stopped. Protect runs on the same counter as Wide Guard, but is a solid move all around to keep Swampert safe from gang attacks and Fake Out. Rock Slide is also an old favorite, as spread moves are appreciated on any team. Ice Beam might look weak given Swampert's average Special Attack, but it still does respectable damage to common Dragon-types.</p> <p>Pokemon that can make use of Wide Guard and take care of Grass-types make great teammates in general. Examples of this are Volcarona, Zapdos, Abomasnow, and Chandelure. Hail teams are usually weak to Heat Wave and Rock Slide, though the buffeting hail can also be a problem for Swampert. Volcarona can actually find time to use Quiver Dance when under Rock Slide protection, or simply singe the competition with its powerful STAB moves. Zapdos can use Heat Wave and form a Discharge + Earthquake combination, while Chandelure appreciates Surf and Rock Slide protection, and can support Swampert with Trick Room. Sandstorm teams love additional protection from rain teams, and Swampert is immune to sandstorm damage courtesy of its Ground typing.</p>"

  "Dusclops": {
    "overview": "<p>With the introduction of Eviolite, Dusclops has surpassed its older brother, Dusknoir, as the premier Trick Room setter in the VGC metagame. Furthermore, with its myriad support moves such as Helping Hand, it does not become a deadweight on the team after fulfilling its role of setting up Trick Room. Dusclops should be considered for any Trick Room team looking for a reliable supporter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dusclops can also run an anti-Trick Room set by using Imprison over Night Shade, shutting down the opponent's Trick Room user. Seismic Toss is an option over Night Shade, as the difference between them is nominal (immunities to one or the other); be warned however, as Chandelure is immune to both Will-O-Wisp and Seismic Toss, which are Dusclops's two main avenues of dealing damage. Therefore, it is preferable to use Night Shade in order to hit the more common Chandelure. Protect can be used over Night Shade; however, this renders Dusclops as a total Taunt bait. Furthermore, with its defenses, Dusclops usually has no need for Protect, as it is able to easily survive most hits while its partner can take out the threat. Pain Split is Dusclops's only method of recovery; if Pain Split is used, Dusclop should use 0 HP EVs in order to maximize the amount of recovery it receives. Dusclops is also able to run Rain Dance and Sunny Day; however, its inability to hold weather lengthening items renders it a mediocre user. Confuse Ray can be used to stir up confusion in the enemy ranks, but is quite unreliable. Finally, Grudge or Destiny Bond are viable options, though they are quite gimmicky.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The best way to shut down Dusclops is by using Taunt, as it renders Dusclop unable to use its supporting techniques and set up Trick Room, making Night Shade or Seismic Toss its only option. Failing that, strong super effective attacks such as Crunch from Tyranitar, or Dark Pulse from Zoroark and Hydreigon are good ways to inflict a great deal of damage on Dusclops; however, beware of Will-O-Wisp from Dusclops if using a physical attacker to wear Dusclops down.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>One of the more common ways teams try to stop Trick Room from going up is by fainting the Trick Room user; with Dusclops's incredible bulk along with Eviolite, outright KOing Dusclops is difficult to do, barring very strong attackers that can hit Dusclops super effectively, such as Tyranitar and Zoroark. Another common method used by opposing teams to stop Trick Room is to Fake Out the user; as Dusclops is immune to Normal-type attacks, it is protected from this method and is therefore able to set up Trick Room without hindrance. Will-O-Wisp is used to cripple physical attackers such as Tyranitar and Garchomp, cutting their Attack in half, further boosting Dusclops's ability to tank physical attacks. Helping Hand is used to support Dusclops's teammate; users of spread moves such as Heat Wave and Rock Slide enjoy the extra boost in power provided by Helping Hand, as it can allow attacks that would normally not OHKO opponents to reach that critical plateau. Finally, Night Shade allows Dusclops to dish out consistent damage, while preventing it from being completely shut down by Taunt.</p> <p>252 HP EVs are used to boost Dusclops's relatively low HP stat to reasonable levels. 252 Special Defense EVs are used, as Will-O-Wisp already helps to cushion Dusclops against physical attacks. The only item that should be considered for Dusclops is Eviolite; this is the crucial component that allows Dusclops to be considered over Dusknoir, as the latter does everything much more effectively when Dusclops is not holding an Eviolite. When using Helping Hand, it is not advised for the partner to use spread moves that hit Dusclops in the process, such as Earthquake and Surf, as Dusclops has no reliable way of recovering HP. It should be noted that Helping Hand is a Pokemon XD exclusive move, meaning obtaining a decent Dusclops on a retail cart can be a hassle. Any teammate that can take advantage of Trick Room and can use spread moves is a friend of Dusclops; Chandelure, Hippowdon, Tyranitar, Heatran, and Gastrodon (with Muddy Water) all function well under Trick Room and are able to use spread moves that are further boosted by Helping Hand. Teammates that also resist Dark-type attacks such as Steel-, Dark-, and Fighting-types are greatly helpful; Intimidate Hitmontop is one useful teammate, as it can switch into Dark-type attacks aimed at Dusclops, and in the event that Dusclops is unable to use Will-O-Wisp, can lower the enemy's Attack stat.</p>"

Regice's massive base 200 Special Defense stat allows it to stand against threatening special attackers such as Latios, Swift Swim Ludicolo, and Zapdos while being able to cripple them with Thunder Wave. It has access to the BoltBeam combo, which allows it to hit the majority of the VGC metagame for super effective damage. However, Regice sports a huge downfall in its lackluster HP stat and Ice typing, which leave it at the mercy of common threats in VGC such as Hitmontop, Tyranitar, and Metagross. In addition, its base 50 Speed allows plenty of Pokemon to get the drop on it, but it can be useful on or against Trick Room teams. Regice can be a difficult Pokemon to use in the VGC 2012 metagame, but if you're able to make use of its advantages, it will not disappoint.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire enables Regice to handle Scizor and Ferrothorn a lot better. Occa Berry enables Regice to tank powerful Fire-type moves aimed at it, such as a Fire Gem-boosted Overheat. Blizzard and Thunder can be used if Regice is placed on a hail or rain team, respectively. Ice Gem gives Ice Beam tremendous power, and can be used alongside an Unnerve user to break through Yache Berries. Amnesia turns Regice into an impenetrable special wall, and allows it to shrug off powerful special attacks, but Regice is too slow to pull this off effectively without a huge amount of team support. Regice can utilize Safeguard to completely shut down Amoonguss, as it blocks Spore, which allows Regice to hurt Amoonguss badly with a powerful Ice Beam without worrying about being put to sleep. Charti Berry buffers the damage Regice takes from Rock-type moves, such as Rock Slide and Stone Edge; however, the former is not a huge problem if it hits multiple targets, while the latter is uncommon. A Chesto Rest set allows Regice to remain on the battlefield that much longer by recovering all of it's HP back instantly. Gravity boosts the accuracy of Blizzard and Zap Cannon, which allows Regice to use both moves to its heart content. Rain Dance allows Regice to counter other weather teams and buffers its Fire weakness. Focus Blast allows Regice to hurt Tyranitar and other Rock- and Steel-types, but its accuracy is unappealing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Metagross completely destroys Regice as long as it doesn't miss with Meteor Mash. Physical Fire-types, such as Infernape and Darmanitan, are also a huge threat to Regice. Heatran completely dominates Regice thanks to its Fire / Steel typing, as not only does it 4x resist Ice-type moves, but both of its STABs deal super effective damage to Regice. Tyranitar takes almost nothing from Regice's attacks thanks to Sandstorm's boost to its Special Defense, and it can hit hard back with Rock Slide or Low Kick. Even if it carries a Chople Berry, Fighting-types are still a threat to Regice, especially if they carry a Lum Berry or if Safeguard is up, as Regice will be unable to cripple them with Thunder Wave. Pokemon with the ability Thick Fat, such as Hariyama and Snorlax, are a nuisance to Regice, as its STAB move is weakened by this ability. Sun teams are problematic as well, as Regice takes much more damage from Fire-type moves in the sun.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This set gives Regice the best of both worlds, as it can tank hits and hit back hard. Ice beam is Regice's main STAB move and will do significant damage to the many Dragon- and Flying-types in VGC, such as Latios, Zapdos, and Thundurus. Thunderbolt completes the BoltBeam combo and allows Regice to handle Water-types, and hit all other types that resist Ice for neutral damage. Thunder Wave allows Regice to threaten most teams by crippling fast opposing threats, slowing them down to a point where a teammate can pick them off. It especially allows Regice to threaten rain sweepers such as Ludicolo and Kingdra, as Regice is more than capable of surviving boosted Water-type moves and paralyzing them. Icy Wind allows Regice to be a team player as it slows down threats for its partners and cannot be Taunted. However, Regice itself is slow enough to be outsped by most Pokemon even after the Speed drop. Protect gives Regice extra longevity, as it can Protect against moves that threaten it so a partner can handle the threat.</p> <p>252 HP EVs help Regice to sponge most special attacks, and 252 Special Attack EVs give Regice enough fire power to hit hard in return. A Modest nature backs up the full investment in Special Attack so it can hit as hard as possible. If you require a specially bulky spread: 252 HP / 244 SpD / 12 SpA with a Calm nature allows Regice to tank a plethora of special attacks; for example, Latios's Dragon Gem Draco Meteor, Chandelure's Heat Wave, and Ludicolo's Hydro Pump in the rain can only 3HKO it. A Chople Berry allows Regice to survive a Fighting-type attack and paralyze the user with Thunder Wave, but if you prefer extra longevity, a Sitrus Berry is an option. A physically bulky spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA with a Bold nature allows Regice to handle physical attacks a lot better on its own. Politoed is a notable partner as it handles Fire- and Rock-types for Regice while setting up permanent rain for Regice to diminish its Fire weakness. Cresselia deserves a mention, as its Psychic typing allows it to fend off Fighting-types for Regice, and it is able to set up Reflect to help Regice withstand physical attacks better. Fighting-types such as Hitmontop aid Regice against bothersome Steel-types and special walls, and can utilize Intimidate to weaken physical threats. Hitmontop also has access to Wide Guard, which blocks Rock Slide and Heat Wave. Follow Me and Rage Powder support are beneficial to draw away harmful super effective attacks from Regice, giving it a chance to strike back. Thanks to its low Speed, Regice is capable of handling Trick Room teams, as it has Ice Beam to hurt Amoonguss.</p>"

        "description": "<p>This set is meant to fully utilize one of Torterra’s best perks: its base 109 Attack stat. The hardest decision when using Torterra is whether to run Wood Hammer or Seed Bomb. Wood Hammer is the more powerful option, but its recoil forces the use of a Life Orb, as it is illogical with a Focus Sash. However, if you don't like the recoil and want to use Focus Sash, Seed Bomb is your best option. Earthquake is obvious as it is a powerful STAB attack; Rock Slide is also mandatory as it hits the Flying-types that resist Torterra's STABs super effectively. Finally, as is the case with every other VGC Pokemon, Protect enables Torterra to scout attacks and keep itself safe for a turn. Wide Guard can also be considered because it blocks Heat Wave and Blizzard, two common moves in the metagame.</p> <p>A Brave nature is used in conjunction with 0 Speed IVs and 252 Attack EVs to minimize Torterra's Speed while maximizing its Attack, which lets it reach its highest potential as a Trick Room sweeper.</p> <p>To fully utilize this set, Trick Room is an absolute must. Cresselia, Musharna, and Bronzong are amazing partners, as they are immune to Earthquake, and the former two can boost the power of Earthquake with Helping Hand. Other Trick Room users, such as Dusclops, Reuniclus, and Slowking, also make good teammates; however, they lack said Earthquake immunity. Pokemon that can set up sandstorm, namely Tyranitar and Hippowdon, also pair greatly with Torterra, who is immune to sandstorm recoil. Of the two, Tyranitar is the more recommended choice as their only common weakness is Bug, an attack type that is almost never seen in the VGC metagame. It is also worth mentioning again that Torterra is a great counter to Swampert, Gastrodon, and Rhyperior. Another effective partner to Torterra is a Rotom forme, as depending on its forme, it can eliminate threats to Torterra such as Tornadus, Thundurus, Scizor, and Fire-types. To add to the success of their pairing, Rotom-A is immune to the turtle's Earthquakes, and Torterra is immune to Discharge as well.</p>"

  "Infernape": {
    "overview": "<p>Possessing great mixed attacking stats and a wide movepool, Infernape is a Pokemon that can give just about anything a run for its mon(k)ey. It can threaten a wide variety of Pokemon, and opponents wanting to take it down must run either a faster Pokemon or an especially bulky Trick Room user—tanks such as Dragonite and Snorlax will be able to take a hit, but will be crippled in the process of KOing it. Infernape shouldn't be trifled with, as its unpredictability may lead to your downfall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Infernape has a few other tricks up its sleeve, including support options such as Quick Guard, Helping Hand, and Taunt, and offensive options such as Vacuum Wave, Mach Punch, Grass Knot, and Rock Slide. Quick Guard protects your team from slower Fake Out users such as Hitmontop and Hariyama; however, because Fake Out from faster Pokemon such as Weavile will bypass Quick Guard, it's not very useful. Helping Hand and Taunt are cool moves, but are wasted on the frail Infernape. Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave are handy priority moves—Mach Punch in particular can be boosted by Iron Fist—but they are hard to fit into Infernape's moveset. They can, however, be used in conjunction with Endeavor and Focus Sash in a pseudo F.E.A.R. combination. Infernape gets Iron Fist via a Dream World promotion, but such Infernape are male only, making Mach Punch the only move boosted by Iron Fist, therefore Blaze is generally better. Grass Knot seems like a good choice at first, but most of the things you'd hit with it are so light that Infernape's usual moves outdamage it. Rock Slide is a nice coverage move, but unfortunately, isn't as useful as Hidden Power Ice is against Dragon- and Flying-types, though it does hit Volcarona hard. Infernape also gets Feint, which is a great move, but requires a lot of prediction. If you need to eliminate Politoed badly, Infernape gets ThunderPunch, which deals a minimum of 51% to neutral 4 HP Politoed with the supplied EV spread and Focus Sash. However, Close Combat does more damage on average, so it's not worth the loss of the main options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Latios can outspeed and OHKO Infernape with only a few scrapes and bruises, but must be wary of Hidden Power Ice and the occasional Shadow Claw. Tornadus and Thundurus give Infernape similar problems, but they are more susceptible to Hidden Power Ice and Rock Slide. Infernape without priority (outside of Fake Out) will struggle against Trick Room in any form, especially Sandstorm + Trick Room, which strips Infernape of its Focus Sash, leaving it vulnerable to pretty much anything. As a Fire-type, Infernape loathes Politoed, Ludicolo, and company, but they must be wary of ThunderPunch, and a possible Acrobatics.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Infernape's stats and movepool scream mixed attacker, which this set capitalizes on. In general, Fake Out is a great move, providing a guaranteed flinch as well as damage, which most teams love to have. Close Combat provides powerful physical STAB, and works well with Focus Sash, allowing Blaze to activate more easily. Heat Wave is a great STAB spread move, though the meager 100 (75 when hitting multiple Pokemon) Base Power can be off-putting. As an alternative, Overheat packs enough firepower to roast 4 HP Zapdos with only a Blaze boost (Life Orb not needed), and does around 50% to the same Zapdos at -2, when a Life Orb is equipped. The last moveslot is preferential, as Infernape has many options. Protect is a staple move that keeps Infernape safe from faster Fake Outs, keeping its Focus Sash intact. Encore can punish Pokemon that try to guard themselves with Protect, locking them into a useless Protect for the next few turns, and allows you to focus on the cripple's partner. Hidden Power Ice hits Pokemon such as Dragonite and Salamence who otherwise wall this set, and provides nice coverage overall.</p> <p>The EVs listed guarantee that Infernape will OHKO 4 HP / 4 Def Terrakion not holding Focus Sash or Chople Berry, as well as OHKO 252 HP Chople Berry Tyranitar 40% of the time if Infernape is using Life Orb. If you want to drop some Speed to make room for more Attack EVs, some good benchmarks to consider are 236 EVs, for base 105 Pokemon such as Mienshao, and 212 EVs, for Garchomp and everything slower. Infernape especially loves Drought Ninetales and Sunny Day support, as sun support not only powers up its Fire-type STAB, but removes damaging weather, such as hail and sandstorm, that nullifies Infernape's Focus Sash.</p>"

  "Empoleon": {
    "overview": "<p>Back in the days before the 5th Generation and the year of the Ubers, Empoleon had some wide usage in VGC. While its typing let it resist lots of moves, Empoleon gets hit fairly hard by common moves such as Earthquake, Close Combat, and Thunderbolt. However, with a nice Special Attacking stat along with bulky base defenses and low base Speed, Empoleon makes good use out of being under Trick Room to easily produce a sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fighting can hit both Ferrothorn and Abomasnow super effectively, regardless of weather. Hidden Power Fire can also hit both of these but is weaker while it is raining. Feather Dance can lower the Attack of physical attackers, making it harder for them to KO Empoleon. The same principle is applied when using Iron Defense to boost Empoleon's Defense to take hits better. Blizzard can be used over Ice Beam if Empoleon is paired with Abomasnow. Flash Cannon is a useful STAB move, but only gives extra coverage on Ice-types such as Abomasnow and Glaceon. Empoleon's only other ability is Defiant, which it gets from the Dream World. Its Attack stat is somewhat decent, but the only time you would see Attack boosts from this ability would be in the face of Intimidate users. This could help Empoleon beat Intimidate Hitmontop, but it can easily fail if not played correctly. Empoleon could abuse Absorb Bulb on an offensive set, as it resists Water-types and can somewhat easily collect boosts.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Unless Empoleon somehow finds a way to stop Electric-type attacks from hurting it through team support, Empoleon gets done in by fast, strong Electric-types such as Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Thundurus. Rotom-W checks Empoleon very well as it resists all of Empoleon's moves and takes very little from Grass Knot, and can hit back pretty hard with Thunderbolt. Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Hitmonlee can use priority attacks such as Mach Punch or just Close Combat to severely damage Empoleon. Gastrodon can sponge almost all of Empoleon's hits if it lacks Hidden Power Grass or Grass Knot. Most common sand abusers can hurt Empoleon with powerful and quick Earthquakes to deal a lot of damage, potentially KOing Empoleon.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Supporter": {
        "description": "<p>Scald is the main STAB for the set as it's one of Empoleon's most reliable Water-type STABs with benefits. Icy Wind is a nice move that Empoleon has in its arsenal to help it take on more of a team supporting role by lowering the opponent's Speed and dealing damage at the same time. Hidden Power Grass gets most of its use by hitting things such as Gastrodon and Rotom-W, which otherwise wall almost anything Empoleon has. However, Grass Knot can hit others, including Rhyperior and Swampert, harder. Protect is a staple on almost anything in VGC. It can help stall, give protection for that turn, and help mess with the opponent's predictions on what to attack the next turn.</p> <p>With the prevalent use of Fighting-types in this metagame, Chople Berry helps Empoleon tank even the strongest Fighting-type attack. Wacan Berry is another choice with the common use of Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Thundurus roaming about with hard hitting moves, as Wacan Berry lets Empoleon survive these. Both Berries also leave Empoleon at enough HP to have Torrent activate, strengthening Scald. As mentioned before, Torrent is a far superior ability for Empoleon over Defiant. A Calm nature gives Empoleon slightly more special bulk, allowing it to survive an Electric Gem-boosted Thunder from Zapdos with Wacan Berry as well as other special attacking moves. Full HP investment lets Empoleon survive lots of attacks and last longer to utilize Icy Wind repeatedly. Full Special Attack investment ensures that it still hits hard while being a decent supporter.</p> <p>Rain support is cool to boost Empoleon's main STAB and to be in control of the dominating weather on the field. Empoleon can pair well with slower, hard-hitting Pokemon that enjoy facing opponents with lowered Speed from Icy Wind support, namely Hydreigon, Chandelure, and Rotom-A; all can be big threats but are often slower than major foes such as Latios or Garchomp. Tornadus and Crobat make good partners, as they prevent Fighting-types on the field from causing a big problem for Empoleon with their Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Scald is the main STAB option on the set. It deals some good damage and has a slight chance to burn the opponent, which might come in handy when hitting physical attackers. Hydro Pump is the other option as it is stronger, but has a higher chance to miss, which could be crucial in some games. Ice Beam gives coverage over many things that threaten Empoleon, such as Garchomp, Zapdos, and Thundurus, which can all use their respective STAB moves to deal heavy damage to Empoleon. Grass Knot hits fellow Water-types, such as Gastrodon and Swampert. Hidden Power Flying gives Empoleon excellent coverage to hit Fighting-type threats, such as Hitmontop and Toxicroak. Protect is a staple move for any Pokemon in VGC. It can do great things during a match such as stall burns, prevent a turn from being wasted due to Fake Out, or just keep Empoleon safe from harm while its partner takes out threats.</p> <p>To maximize the attacking output of Empoleon, Life Orb is the item of choice for it. However, Chople Berry can be an alternative option as a lot of the time, Life Orb is already used up on the majority of Trick Room teams. Chople Berry can help Empoleon tank the common Fighting-types in the metagame such as Scrafty and Hariyama. Torrent is the best ability for Empoleon, having more practical uses over Defiant, as Empoleon is a better Special Attacker. Quiet nature maximizes Empoleon's Special Attack and decreases its Speed for better Trick Room use. Empoleon has decent base defenses, but a somewhat low HP stat of 84, so with full investment Empoleon becomes harder to OHKO with moves such as Earthquake from Garchomp and Mamoswine. A Speed IV of 2 in conjunction with the right IVs in the other stats allows Empoleon to get maximum power on Hidden Power Flying while being as slow as possible for Trick Room. Aqua Jet could be used to finish off weakened opponents. Hidden Power Grass is an option to use over Grass Knot to be able to hit threats such as Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Quagsire harder. If you do use this as an option, a Speed IV of 3 along with the other IVs matching in the right field will make a Grass-type Hidden Power. Surf can be used as the main Water-type STAB for Empoleon, but should only be used with partners immune to Surf such as Gastrodon so that you don't have to waste a moveslot with Protect on your partner when using it.</p> <p>Pokemon that work well at setting up Trick Room pair very well with Empoleon, as they can set Trick Room for Empoleon to wreck the rest of the team. Other Pokemon which work well under Trick Room that have Lightning Rod, such as Marowak and Seaking, are excellent partners for Empoleon, as they prevent foes such as Zapdos and Thundurus from being huge threats. Empoleon's counters mostly consist of common VGC physical attackers, such as Hitmontop, Garchomp and Excadrill, as they can all hit Empoleon for super effective damage. Prankster Sableye is a good partner, as it can use Will-O-Wisp and the combination of Trick and Lagging Tail to stop these kinds of threats that may KO Empoleon. Politoed makes a good partner with the ability to set rain and increase the power of Empoleon's main STAB.</p>"

  "Staraptor": {
    "overview": "<p>With high-power moves, an impressive base 120 Attack, and a decent base 100 Speed, Staraptor charges towards its opponents head-first, hitting hard and fast. Receiving both the Intimidate and Reckless abilities, it can choose between providing support for the team, or going straight for the KO. Its poor defenses, further weakened by recoil damage or Close Combat defense drops, might make one think twice about using Staraptor, but with a bit of support and by picking its fights wisely, this black-feathered bird can blaze a path through its opponents' teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Staraptor's movepool is quite shallow. Whirlwind stops Trick Room, Quick Attack gives Staraptor a priority move that can finish off weakened opponents, and Endeavor can be used at low HP as a surprise attack. Staraptor can try to be a revenge killer while keeping Intimidate by using Normal Gem and Retaliate; however, it is heavily situational. Lastly, FeatherDance further lowers the opponents' Attack stats. Most of the time, though, Staraptor will be hard-pressed to find space for these moves on its moveset.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Staraptor is quite frail and tends to take large amounts of recoil damage whenever it attacks, so it will go down quickly to powerful special attacks, or even non-Intimidate-weakened physical attacks. However, landing said attack on Staraptor can be tricky due to its Speed and power. Thundurus and Zapdos resist the combination of Brave Bird and Close Combat and can KO with Thunderbolt, but neither takes kindly to getting hit by Double-Edge. Metagross can take just about anything Staraptor can throw at it and strike back hard with Meteor Mash, but has to watch out for Final Gambit. Bisharp's Attack gets boosted by Intimidate, and it can OHKO with Sucker Punch. Sableye can cripple Staraptor with priority Will-O-Wisp. Lastly, Swift Swim Pokemon have little to worry about if the rain is up, as they outrun and OHKO Staraptor without too much of a problem.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>With Reckless boosting Staraptor's recoil moves, its Brave Bird and Double-Edge become 144 Base Power STAB moves. Brave Bird and Close Combat provide great coverage, while Double-Edge fills in the remaining gaps by hitting Thundurus and Zapdos hard. U-turn provides Staraptor with a way to switch out while dealing damage, but it can be risky if Staraptor is blocked by Protect while using U-turn.</p> <p>The EVs allow Staraptor to hit as hard and fast as possible. Its Double-Edge can OHKO 4/0 Thundurus and 4/0 Latios, and with a Choice Scarf, it will easily be able to outrun them to execute its attacks. A Choice Band can be used instead of a Choice Scarf, trading Speed for power and increasing Staraptor's OHKO list, but it will require a lot of support as Staraptor's base 100 Speed is just a bit too slow for the job. Choice Band Staraptor should also utilize a Jolly nature; even with Jolly, Staraptor can OHKO 4/0 Garchomp with its recoil moves.</p> <p>If being locked into one move is unfavorable, Staraptor can run a Normal or Flying Gem instead of a Choice item. This allows Staraptor to have more freedom of choice in terms of its moves, and enables it to run Protect over U-turn. Similarly to Choice Band Staraptor, it will need quite a bit of support to work well, due to the presence of many faster Pokemon in the metagame.</p> <p>An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 52 Atk / 204 Spe allows the best use of Final Gambit. With 192 HP, Staraptor's Final Gambit delivers an OHKO against the likes of Metagross, Togekiss, Ferrothorn, Porygon2, and Latias, who can be difficult for it to KO normally. 204 Speed EVs give Staraptor 146 Speed, allowing it to always outrun Choice Scarf base 80 threats, such as Chandelure or Mamoswine. As Final Gambit becomes the main focus of the set, Intimidate is recommended over Reckless.</p> <p>Using this Staraptor will be all about having it land its devastating attacks while finding a way to keep it alive for as long as possible. Users of Fake Out, Follow Me, or Helping Hand work very nicely in allowing Staraptor to survive longer or hit harder. Faster sweepers, such as Latios and Terrakion, can also work by keeping the opponent under pressure with heavy hitting attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Tailwind Support": {
        "description": "<p>The goal of this Staraptor is to provide Intimidate and Tailwind support to its team; once it sets up, it can proceed to go on the offensive. Brave Bird and Close Combat provide great coverage, and differentiates Staraptor from Salamence, who is able to perform a similar role. Tailwind allows Staraptor to double the Speed of its teammates for three turns, while Protect protects Staraptor from incoming attacks.</p> <p>116 Speed EVs give 135 Speed, allowing Staraptor to outrun Ludicolo in the rain after using Tailwind. The rest of the EVs go into maximizing Staraptor's Attack, with the remainder added into Special Defense. Investing in Special Defense instead of HP allows Staraptor to survive non-STAB Ice Beams or Blizzards from various Water-type Pokemon, such as Politoed and Ludicolo, while Staraptor can hold a Wacan Berry to survive Zapdos's Thunderbolts, provided Zapdos does not run Life Orb or an Electric Gem. A Flying Gem or Life Orb can be run instead if you feel confident that you can keep Staraptor away from the high voltage.</p> <p>A partner that runs Fake Out increases Staraptor's chances of using Tailwind. Hitmontop can work very nicely, layering a second Intimidate upon the opponents, while Tailwind will allow it to outrun most Pokemon. Although Staraptor can hit hard, it does not last very long on the field. Be sure to have some heavy attackers on standby to back it up after it sets up Tailwind; many common Pokemon, such as Metagross, Chandelure, or Latios, make good teammates, but Tailwind can also open up the field for more interesting options, such as Darmanitan or Dragonite.</p>"

  "Roserade": {
    "overview": "<p>While the presence of Amoonguss overshadows Roserade, Roserade is not a Pokemon that should be overlooked. Utilizing its undervalued STAB moves, Roserade can take down some common threats in the metagame. Boasting an outstanding base 125 Special Attack, a respectable base 90 Speed, and a great base 105 Special Defense, Roserade can be a powerhouse with proper team support and easily fits onto most teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>SolarBeam becomes usable in sun, and Weather Ball becomes usable in most weather. However, because weather inducers are common, the moves may become weakened. Sleep Powder is a good support move, but Amoonguss and Breloom are better sleep inducers than Roserade. If Guts sweepers are a problem for your team, Worry Seed can severely cripple them, but due to Roserade's frailty, smacking them with a STAB Leaf Storm deals with them more effectively. A Choice Scarf set with Shadow Ball or Weather Ball over Protect can be considered if you want the extra Speed. If Roserade's teammates cover the Pokemon that Hidden Power Ice or Fire would hit, Hidden Power Ground can be used to increase coverage, but Hidden Power Ice and Fire are generally more useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Hail teams are troublesome to Roserade, as a STAB Blizzard will easily OHKO her. If Roserade is not carrying Shadow Ball, Psychic-types such as Reuniclus and Musharna wall her and retaliate with a super effective Psychic. Roserade can't do a thing against Fire-types, and Heatran will be able to completely shut her down. Heat Wave from opposing sun teams can also cause trouble. The choice of a certain Hidden Power will determine which Pokemon will wall Roserade. If Hidden Power Fire is chosen, Dragon-types wall Roserade, and if you choose Hidden Power Ice, Steel-types wall her.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Roserade's best STAB moves. Leaf Storm is a great move to have on hand, being able to destroy the opposition easily; the Special Attack drop it causes is greatly mitigated by the length of VGC battles. Sludge Bomb is Roserade's second STAB move, OHKOing Abomasnow and Breloom as well as having a good chance to OHKO Ludicolo. Hidden Power Fire smashes Scizor, while Hidden Power Ice dents Garchomp and Salamence. Protect is a staple in VGC, shielding Roserade for a turn while its teammate can eliminate her threats.</p> <p>While neither of Roserade's abilities are very useful in VGC, Poison Point is the more useful ability, forcing physical attackers to think twice before hitting Roserade with contact moves. However, Poison Point does conflict with teams hoping to abuse status, and in that case, Natural Cure should be used. In the fast-paced VGC metagame, Gems are some of the most useful items as they provide the user with a single super-powered move, often turning 2HKOs into OHKOs without the drawbacks of using Choice Specs or a Choice Band. Grass Gem in combination with Leaf Storm smacks everything hard; it even OHKOes Tyranitar in sand. A Life Orb can be used to make Roserade useful even after she fires off a STAB Leaf Storm. Giga Drain provides a safer route if the drop in Special Attack is unappealing, but the decrease in power is significant. Shadow Ball can help lessen the threat of common Psychic- and Ghost-types. Roserade needs a teammate that can alleviate her weakness to weather, so Heatran, Chandelure, and Gastrodon make great partners. Heatran and Chandelure can handle sun and hail, while Gastrodon benefits from rain and tanks common attacks from sand teams.</p>"

  "Togekiss": {
    "overview": "<p>Togekiss has everything anyone could want in a Pokemon: nice bulk, a movepool out the wazoo, an amazing base 120 Special Attack stat, two great abilities—and to top it all off, it's affably cute as well. It does possess unfortunate weaknesses to common Rock-, Ice-, and Electric-type moves, but these can be played around. Just run it alongside a partner capable of taking out threats to it and Togekiss will not let you down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Togekiss gets Psycho Shift, which it can use alongside Flame Orb, but this is generally better left to more defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia. Sunny Day and Rain Dance can be used to let Togekiss mess up opposing weather teams, or even serve as a backup weather inducer. ExtremeSpeed is a powerful priority move that enables Togekiss to pick off weakened Pokemon; it is a cool addition to your Togekiss if it somehow finds itself with an extra moveslot. As mentioned in the Follow Me set, Togekiss is more than capable of using Light Screen, Reflect, and Safeguard to support its teammates. Togekiss gets Super Luck via the Dream World, and while this might be somewhat useful if it had any moves with boosted critical hit chances, Togekiss prefers the flinch chance that its other luck-based ability, Serene Grace, grants.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As mentioned before, Electric-types such as Thundurus and Zapdos zap Togekiss right out of the sky with STAB Thunderbolt and Discharge. Tyranitar is a solid check, as are its common partners, Excadrill, Terrakion, and Landorus, though the first three have to be wary of Aura Sphere. Hail-based teams tend to give Togekiss the cold shoulder with STAB 100% accurate Blizzards, which also negate Follow Me, but they have to watch out for Heat Wave.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Follow Me Support": {
        "description": "<p>This is any Togekiss's user's bread-and-butter set, and it's not hard to see why. Great defenses combined with Follow Me and Air Slash make Togekiss one of the premier supporting Pokemon in VGC, so much so that it is often the first thing an opponent would want to eliminate. Consequently, Protect is the main option in the last slot, keeping Togekiss alive for an extra turn so its partner can take out the offending Pokemon. Togekiss has many more options to use in the third slot, but the two listed are the picks of the litter. Thunder Wave cripples fast attackers such as Latios, who would otherwise be problematic, while also forming the ever-so-annoying paraflinch combination. Tailwind is a bit more support-oriented, allowing Togekiss's team members to outrun the opponent; increasing Togekiss's Speed also makes Air Slash more deadly.</p> <p>A The listed specially defensive EV spread allows Togekiss to take powerful Blizzards and Thunderbolts with HP to spare; alternatively, a Bold nature with 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD can be used to let Togekiss survive powerful Rock Slides and Stone Edges from Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Rhyperior. If you have access to a Togepi from Pokemon XD Gale of Darkness, Helping Hand is a very viable option, as the combination of Follow Me and Helping Hand is surprisingly useful. While you're dabbling in ADV, Body Slam and Soft-Boiled can be used over Thunder Wave and Roost respectively. If you want to cram as much support as you can on Togekiss, you can forgo the third slot's listed options in favor of moves such as Encore, Safeguard, Reflect, and Light Screen. Be careful about doing this, however, as without Roost or Protect, Togekiss tends to go down rather quickly. If you're using Togekiss to help set up Trick Room, be sure to avoid also running clashing moves such as Tailwind and Thunder Wave. Encore is perhaps the most useful replacement, as most teams rely on double Protecting to stall out Trick Room. If all your team needs is Follow Me support, you can consider more offensive options such as Aura Sphere, Tri Attack, and Heat Wave.</p> <p>Without Aura Sphere, Togekiss generally struggles against Rock-types such as Tyranitar. It also can't do much to most Electric-types, especially Thundurus and Zapdos. Terrakion makes a fine partner, taking out said Pokemon in one or two hits while Togekiss directs attacks to itself so Terrakion remains relatively untouched. As previously stated, Wide Guard users make excellent teammates. When running Trick Room, Togekiss enjoys a boosting teammate that can take out problematic Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Bronzong. However, note that it is not a good idea to pair Togekiss with a Trick Room user that shares a weakness with it, such as Chandelure, Slowking, and Slowbro.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Unlike most Togekiss, this set aims to immediately outrun the opponent and start firing off Air Slashes. Aura Sphere is a great coverage move, especially against Moody Smeargle with a few Evasion boosts, and against Pokemon that resist Air Slash such as Tyranitar. Heat Wave is a great spread move, especially considering the fact that it has a 20% chance to burn a Pokemon, but Tri Attack gets a STAB boost and has many different effects that are also boosted by Serene Grace. The last slot is generally preferential; Hidden Power Ice hits Dragons such as Garchomp and Dragonite super effectively, which is always handy for a team. Follow Me is again always a good option, and with Choice Scarf, it can stop Fake Out more effectively, though Follow Me isn't the best move to be Choice-locked into. Trick can lock opposing Pokemon into undesirable moves, possibly removing beneficial items such as Eviolite and miscellaneous Berries.</p> <p>Togekiss doesn't have many more offensive options, but Fire Blast can be used over Heat Wave for a little extra power. As odd as it may sound, Twister is also an option. With Serene Grace it is essentially a perfectly accurate weaker Rock Slide with a higher flinch rate. As this Togekiss is more offensively inclined, and it might be locked into an unfavorable move from time to time, its teammates should be ready to cater to its needs. Wide Guard users such as Hitmontop, Swampert, and Conkeldurr make great teammates, as they protect Togekiss from Rock Slide and Discharge, and can also take on the hail and sand teams that Togekiss doesn't particularly care for. Choice Scarf Togekiss also enjoys harsh sunlight, which boosts Heat Wave, but it isn't required.</p>"

  "Dusknoir": {
    "overview": "<p>A Trick Room staple for years, Dusknoir found its usage dropping quickly once its pre-evolution, Dusclops, got a defense boost in the form of Eviolite. While it may not tank the hits its pre-evolution does, Dusknoir is still able to set up Trick Room with impunity, and utilize helpful items Dusclops cannot. It again trumps Dusclops by having a much higher base 100 Attack from which it can take advantage of its own Trick Room. Although many overlook these aspects and use Dusclops, Dusknoir is a fantastic Pokemon for setting up and abusing Trick Room.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>It must be noted that a Dusknoir with Helping Hand and flawless IVs is considerably difficult to obtain in-game, only being available via the GameCube iterations of the series, namely Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness. A realistic goal would be attempting to get a Dusknoir with IVs of 28 or higher. Because of this handicap, Protect may be used instead in order to provide Dusknoir with a damage-free turn. Pain Split provides a way to recover HP and hurt opponents at the same time and with Dusknoir's low HP, it will often receive health while the foe will likely lose it. Dusknoir has a plethora of physical options in its movepool, yet sadly finds itself lacking the necessary moveslots to utilize them. Ice Punch could be useful against the Grass-type Spore users that ruin Dusknoir's day, such as Amoonguss and Parasect. Earthquake, Rock Slide, Fire Punch, Thunderpunch, and Brick Break are all moves that seem useful on paper but can't hit as hard as one would like in application. Imprison is an option to shut down other Trick Room users, as well as to disable moves detrimental to Dusknoir's teammates, such as Will-O-Wisp. Speaking of disabling, Disable provides a way to shut down Choice users that spam powerful moves. Gravity seems as if it could be decent, though between setting up both it and Trick Room, time will be short to actually utilize it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Taunt completely shuts Dusknoir down, and though a Mental Herb remedies this, one can still Taunt again to completely cripple the ghoul. Once Taunted, Pokemon utilizing Sucker Punch such as Hitmontop and Shiftry can rip Dusknoir apart, as it is forced to attack. Though few Pokemon can OHKO Dusknoir, it still has much to fear from strong attackers. Dark-type Pokemon such as Weavile and Honchkrow can smack Dusknoir with a super effective STAB move, though they must watch out for a Will-O-Wisp in return. Chandelure can soak up Will-O-Wisp, boosting its Fire-type STAB via Flash Fire, and proceed to murder Dusknoir with either its boosted Fire STAB or a super effective Shadow Ball. Additionally, Chandelure can run Imprison which, when coupled with Trick Room, renders Dusknoir unable to set up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Dusknoir can help both itself and its allies by setting up Trick Room. Setting up Trick Room allows the slowest Pokemon to go first; with Dusknoir's poor Speed, this means it will almost always be going first. Will-O-Wisp neuters physical attackers, especially Dark-types looking to hit Dusknoir for super effective damage, such as Bisharp and Tyranitar. In the third slot, Shadow Punch gives Dusknoir a reliable STAB move that never misses, though Shadow Sneak has priority and is only weaker than Shadow Punch by 20 Base Power. Helping Hand provides Dusknoir with the ability to boost the power of its partner's attacks by 50%, something few other Pokemon can boast.</p> <p>The item choice is what really distinguishes Dusknoir from Dusclops. While Dusclops is forced to use Eviolite, Dusknoir can choose from a myriad of items. Mental Herb wastes an opposing Taunt and allows Dusknoir to always get off a Trick Room on the first turn. Due to the popularity of Spore users, a Lum Berry may be used as a way to evade the Sandman and pull off a Trick Room; however, a Sitrus Berry provides Dusknoir with additional longevity and allows it to get away with not using Pain Split. A Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs make Dusknoir as slow as possible, so it can almost always move first in Trick Room. 236 HP and Special Defense EVs bulk up Dusknoir, allowing it to take many special-based attacks with ease, while Will-O-Wisp keeps physical attackers at bay. 36 EVs are put into Defense in order to allow Dusknoir to survive a Crunch from Tyranitar, even without a Sitrus Berry.</p> <p>Any Pokemon that can aid Dusknoir in its quest to set up Trick Room is greatly appreciated as a partner. Pokemon that utilize Fake Out, namely Scrafty and Hariyama, are great partners for Dusknoir. In addition to utilizing Fake Out, Scrafty and Hariyama have low Speed, allowing them to function very well in Trick Room. Amoonguss, a longtime staple of Trick Room teams, is a highly recommended teammate, drawing attacks away from Dusknoir with Rage Powder and taking threats out of action with its 100% accurate Spore. Rhyperior and Conkeldurr are but two examples of the slow, yet hard-hitting Pokemon that love taking advantage of the Trick Room environment Dusknoir brings, in addition to the boost in attacking power provided by Helping Hand.</p>"

  "Serperior": {
    "overview": "<p>While its name may imply superiority over other Pokemon, Serperior is often seen as inferior to other Grass-types and supporting Pokemon in VGC 2012. Serperior's high base 113 Speed helps differentiate itself from most Grass-types, however it faces competition from Whimsicott, who has access to Prankster. Serperior lacks the offensive stats to actually deal decent damage, so it's often left to support its team members. Its defensive stats aren't worth writing home about either, as it's weak to Fire- and Ice-type attacks—which are commonly seen—and has a small movepool, making it relatively predictable. Despite its disadvantages, Serperior can still do a decent job at supporting its teammates thanks to its great base Speed, but is outclassed by many other Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Serperior's movepool is rather limited, but still has a few viable options. Serperior is the fastest Gastro Acid user in the game, and while it may seem gimmicky on paper it could potentially shut down Pokemon that heavily rely on their abilities, such as Swift Swim abusers. Serperior can also make good use of Leech Seed as it has low HP, which works well on foes with high HP stats, such as Chansey. Safeguard can be used to block status, and Mean Look prevents opponents from switching, which could allow a safe switch in for a counter. Sunny Day is useful for cancelling out unfavorable weather such as sand or hail.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Serperior's defenses are less than outstanding, so any heavy hitter with a strong Fire-, Ice-, or Flying-type move can easily take out Serperior if it hasn't set up dual screens yet. Faster opponents such as Weavile can easily remove Serperior with Fake Out and a STAB Ice Punch. Steel-types such as Metagross and Scizor take very little from Serperior's attacks and can effectively wall it. Prankster users such as Whimsicott and Thundurus can use Taunt to render Serperior useless, unless it has Mental Herb; any Pokemon with Taunt could shut it down as well.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Serperior's high base Speed can allow it to function as a fast dual screen user. Light Screen and Reflect form the core of the set, while Giga Drain gives Serperior a way to recover HP and prevents it from becoming complete Taunt bait. Glare can paralyze opponents while being able to hit Ground-types. Taunt can prevent slower opponents, such as Cresselia, from setting up, and Protect allows Serperior to avoid damage for a turn.</p> <p>The EVs are set to give Serperior both speed and bulk, while adding a little to its defenses. Using maximum Speed is almost pointless as it doesn't let Serperior outspeed anything in particular. 244 Speed EVs hits 181 Speed, which outspeeds max Speed Thundurus and Tornadus and everything below, which includes base 110 Speed Pokemon. The rest of the EVs are placed in defenses and Special Attack, as to not waste EVs. Mental Herb is the item of choice due to the prevalence of Taunt users. Light Clay may be used to prolong the effects of Light Screen and Reflect, but Mental Herb is usually preferred due to the fast nature of VGC battles. Leaf Storm may be used over Giga Drain if you want a strong attack and don't care about HP recovery; Leaf Blade can also be used with a Jolly nature if you'd rather hit on the physical side. The set pairs well with offensive partners, such as Latios and Terrakion, as they appreciate the boosts given by dual screens. Slower Pokemon such as Metagross and Chandelure also do well with paralysis support from Glare.</p>"

  "Emboar": {
    "overview": "<p>Life isn't easy for Emboar. As it is seemingly outclassed by its older two Fire / Fighting type cousins, Blaziken and Infernape, one might wonder why anybody would ever use Emboar. However, with high base 123 Attack, low base 65 Speed, and a deceptively wide movepool, Emboar is a prime candidate for a Trick Room attacker. 110 / 65 / 65 defenses aren't the best in the world, though, especially as it is weak to several common offensive types, such as Water, Ground, and Psychic. Despite this, the smoldering piece of bacon is a very underrated threat, and it is on the whole definitely one of the best physical attackers under Trick Room.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earthquake is a good spread move to use over Rock Slide, but the coverage it provides overlaps with Emboar's STAB moves, and Emboar's other coverage moves have more power. Curse makes Emboar more powerful, bulkier, and slower in Trick Room, but setup moves are rarely useful in the fast-paced VGC metagame. Head Smash is ridiculously powerful and can hit Flying-types extremely well—to illustrate, it OHKOes 252/0 Zapdos—but it has severe recoil and shaky 80% accuracy. Thanks to its respectable base 100 Special Attack, Emboar can run a viable special set by drawing on moves such as Flamethrower, Focus Blast, Overheat, Fire Blast, Scald, Hidden Power, and Grass Knot, which can beat Gastrodon, Rhyperior, and Landorus, if Hidden Power Ice is being used. However, Emboar's physical movepool is both more powerful and more reliable. Although Emboar can run a mixed set to moderate success, allowing it to both counter the above Pokemon and the other Pokemon it is strong against, it appreciates the extra survivability more than the special coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The likes of Hitmontop and Arcanine have Intimidate to reduce Emboar's Attack, which puts it in a sticky situation as to whether to stay in or switch out. Gastrodon and Slowking outpace Emboar in Trick Room and can hit it hard with a STAB Water-type move. Cresselia and Dusclops can tank Emboar's attacks comfortably and also perform well in Trick Room; Cresselia can hit back with its super effective Psychic as well. However, Dusclops must watch out as it cannot burn Emboar with Will-O-Wisp. Acrobatics users such as Crobat, Tornadus, and Scizor can easily OHKO Emboar, and as Emboar has absolutely no Ice-type coverage outside of the extremely rare Hidden Power Ice, it requires proper support in order to take out threats such as Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus. Teams that counter Trick Room will stop Emboar as it is far too slow to do any work outside of Trick Room. Chandelure is immune to both of Emboar's STABs and can counter Trick Room, but it must watch out for Head Smash.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Flare Blitz is the best Fire-type physical STAB Emboar can use, as it does huge damage to just about anything it hits super effectively, particularly Scizor and Ferrothorn. Hammer Arm is Emboar's best Fighting-type STAB move, and has a Speed-lowering effect that benefits Emboar in Trick Room. However, it does have a shaky 90% accuracy. Superpower is a more powerful and accurate option, but as it lowers Emboar's Attack and Defense, it puts a big dent in Emboar's ability to pull off a clean sweep. Rock Slide destroys Flying-types such as Zapdos and Thundurus, and its flinch chance is great as Emboar will outpace most Pokemon in Trick Room. Alternatively, Wild Charge not only hits Flying-types super effectively but also serves as a fantastic weapon against Water-types such as Politoed and Gyarados, which would normally cause Emboar trouble. However, it does inflict some nasty recoil. Protect ensures that Emboar will be able to survive for more turns and is a gold-standard move in the VGC metagame. When using Emboar, note that it is best run not in the lead spot, but as a sweeper to bring out only after Trick Room has been set up.</p> <p>252 EVs are put in HP and Attack to make full use of Emboar's best stats. A Brave nature ensures that Emboar can outpace most threats in Trick Room and hit them hard. An Expert Belt maximizes the power of Emboar's super effective hits, while Life Orb boosts all its moves at the cost of recoil, which can be useful to grab a few surprise KOs. Fire and Fighting Gems also work well. White Herb is another interesting item as it counters Intimidate and mitigates Superpower's crippling stat drops. Even though Emboar isn't the bulkiest Pokemon around, it can utilize a Sitrus Berry well, in particular to recover some of the recoil damage it will be taking.</p> <p>Standard Trick Room setters, namely Cresselia, Bronzong, Slowking, and Dusclops, all have good synergy with Emboar, as they can eliminate opponents that often trouble it, such as Terrakion, Chandelure, and Reuniclus. Gastrodon pairs with Emboar well, as its ability to draw in all common Water attacks—bar Surf and Muddy Water—gives Emboar one less threat to worry about. Jellicent is also a fantastic partner, as it has access to Trick Room and the ability to take out Emboar's counters, such as Rhyperior, Arcanine, and Chandelure.</p>"

  "Stoutland": {
    "overview": "<p>Stoutland is the final evolution of the most recent addition to the weak, common Route 1 Normal-type Pokemon family. Even so, this mustachioed mutt is no runt; Stoutland is a purebred, competitively viable Pokemon with good defenses, excellent Attack, a decent movepool, and two amazing abilities. Stoutland's major flaws boil down to the fact that, firstly, it cannot do much of anything to Rock- and Steel-types outside of Dig, and secondly, it is weak to the common Fighting-type moves and will take massive damage from them even after Intimidate. These weaknesses can be patched up by its teammates, though, and Stoutland could add that little spark of personality your team needs without losing any competitive edge.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Remember the saying 'you can't teach an old dog new tricks'? Well, that applies to Stoutland's rather shallow movepool. Reversal is slightly gimmicky, but it's Stoutland's only good Fighting-type move. The combination of Focus Sash and Reversal can let Stoutland take care of pesky Steel- and Rock-types, but if you're using a sandstorm team, you probably have a whole menagerie of Earthquake users. Bite can be used over Crunch if you feel a potential paraflinch combination is worth more than a clean 2HKO on Latios. Yawn is always an annoying move especially given the lack of Sleep Clause, though the one turn it takes to work hampers its usefulness. Snarl can make Stoutland even sturdier, and lowering opponents' Special Attack is useful considering the popularity of powerful Surfs, Heat Waves, and Blizzards.</p> <p>Sand Rush Stoutland can utilize a Choice Band, but it doesn't gain any notable OHKOs. Normal Gem effectively provides the same boost as Choice Band, but benefits only Return, and gives Stoutland the ability to change moves afterward. Lum Berry protects Stoutland from status, which can be useful to avoid sleep or burn, the latter of which cripples the Sand Rush set. If you don't like any of the options listed, Last Resort can be used as a, well, last resort. However, Last Resort requires a set of only Protect and Last Resort to be effective, which leaves Stoutland vulnerable to just about anything that resists Normal-type moves. Due to Item Clause, you might be hard-pressed to spare a Sitrus or Chople Berry for Stoutland. Leftovers is a good replacement, especially as maximum HP Stoutland attains a stat of 192, which is divisible by 16.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As Stoutland is a Normal-type with no Fighting- nor Ground-type attacks, Rock-type Pokemon naturally pose problems to it. Terrakion will run circles around Stoutland if it can avoid Intimidate or if it switches into a Crunch for the Justified boost, as it can retaliate with its powerful Close Combat. Hitmontop can bypass Sand Rush and 2HKO Stoutland with Mach Punch or send Stoutland to the pound with Close Combat. Guts Conkeldurr doesn't mind an Attack drop, and can use a combination of Drain Punch and Mach Punch to finish off Stoutland. Lucario resists both Crunch and Return and defeats Stoutland with Close Combat and ExtremeSpeed, but it hates being paralyzed. Metagross and Heatran aren't bothered by Intimidate, usually don't care too much about paralysis, and can use powerful STAB moves such as Meteor Mash and Heat Wave to make short work of Stoutland.</p> <p>Sand Rush Stoutland is dead weight against Trick Room most of the time, as it is forced to Protect stall Trick Room out and hope it isn't KOed before it can land a hit. Porygon2 is probably the best Trick Room user to use against Stoutland, though any Trick Room user will likely be able to set up against Stoutland with the proper support. Under Trick Room's effects, Rhyperior and Hariyama are two of the best answers to Stoutland, especially if Hariyama is a Guts variant.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Intimidate Support": {
        "description": "<p>A supporting Stoutland is perhaps the most useful variant, as it can easily fit onto many teams. Intimidate and Thunder Wave make for an annoying combination, crippling just about anything as most Ground-types are physically based. Return is Stoutland's main STAB, and can 2HKO or heavily damage sweepers such as Thundurus and Kingdra. Crunch is mainly for Ghost-types, but Ice Fang is a good alternative coverage move. The third slot is reserved for supporting moves. Thunder Wave cripples anything that isn't inside Trick Room, can nab some paralysis hax, and can pave the way for more dangerous Pokemon on your team. Helping Hand does as the name suggests, multiplying the recipient's power by 1.5, though you'll have to be on your toes about the opponent Protecting on the boosted move. Protect is fairly obvious as it guards Stoutland from dangerous moves and allows it to recover more HP from Leftovers.</p> <p>On the subject of items, Sitrus Berry is the standard-issue recovery item of VGC, and coincidentally, maximum HP Stoutland's HP is divisible by 4, meaning it heals a little more than it normally would. If you don't want Fighting-type moves to make Stoutland run off with its tail between its legs, simply equip it with a Chople Berry. Keep in mind, however, that Stoutland will miss recovery.</p> <p>Fire-, Fighting-, and Flying-type Pokemon make good partners for Stoutland due to its issues with Rock-, Steel-, and Fighting-types. A Togekiss backed by Thunder Wave and Intimidate support can be a nightmare for anybody, especially if Togekiss has Aura Sphere. Chandelure appreciates both Thunder Wave and Helping Hand, and Rock Slide won't be as deadly to it with Intimidate support. Hitmontop deserves a special mention as it can form a double Intimidate combo with Stoutland, ensuring physical attacks will deal little damage. Latios absolutely adores Helping Hand, which boosts its Draco Meteor to obscene power levels, and it won't be easily checked by Dragon Claw or Sucker Punch after the opponent's Attack is taken down a notch.</p>"
      },
      "Sand Rush": {
        "description": "<p>The main draw of Sand Rush Stoutland is that it is the only Sand Rush user that can hit Water-types super effectively while maintaining an excellent Speed stat, outrunning even Choice Scarf Garchomp and Speed tying with Choice Scarf Terrakion. In fact, it can OHKO 4/0 Ludicolo with Return after sandstorm damage, as well as 2HKO 252/140+ Suicune with Wild Charge. Remember to Crunch opponents such as Jellicent and Slowking, as Wild Charge and Life Orb recoil will take its toll very quickly. Ice Fang is an option over Crunch or Protect, as it can provide extra coverage against Dragon- and Grass-types, and has almost unresisted coverage with Wild Charge. Protect is useful on this set as well, as it stalls out Trick Room and Tailwind, racks up sandstorm damage, and avoids moves such as Mach Punch and a teammate's Earthquake.</p> <p>Do not attempt to equip Stoutland with recovery items; Life Orb is absolutely needed on this set for the OHKOs it provides. Although this is an offensive set, Thunder Wave can still be useful with Sand Rush, as it allows Stoutland's slower teammates to outspeed otherwise threatening Pokemon. Helping Hand can be used in a similar manner if you have a priority user such as Scizor. If you need more assurance against opposing weather starters, Fire Fang can be used for a surprise kill against Abomasnow, and to deal massive amounts of damage to Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Obviously, Sand Rush Stoutland needs sand active as much as possible. Hippowdon is typing-wise the better choice of the two fully evolved Sand Stream Pokemon, but Tyranitar is a good option as well. Claydol is able to use Ally Switch to avoid Ghost-type moves and take Fighting-type moves for Stoutland, but more importantly, it can reverse Trick Room, a field condition that would otherwise neuter Stoutland. Bronzong and Reuniclus are two other Trick Room users that don't take damage from sand, but they are slower and might not fit on a team full of speedy Pokemon. Gliscor greatly appreciates the removal of Water-types and can OHKO many Fighting-types with its powerful Acrobatics. As previously mentioned, Scizor makes a good partner to finish off weakened threats with its powerful Bullet Punch; it can also use Acrobatics against Fighting-types.</p>"

Gigalith also has a great ability in Sturdy, acting as a free Focus Sash. However, Gigalith has a grand total of five weaknesses, three of them are some of the most used offensive types in VGC. Gigalith also has a shallow movepool, making it very predictable. Despite this, Gigalith is a Pokemon you should give serious consideration to when building a Trick Room team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unfortunately, Gigalith doesn't have much else to utilize outside of this set. Stone Edge is less accurate than Rock Slide, but is powerful enough to be considered over it, and Smack Down grounds Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate, allowing them to be hit by Earthquake. Gravity increases the accuracy of Rock Slide and an ally's moves, and also makes everyone on the field vulnerable to Earthquake. Curse makes Gigalith even more deadly in Trick Room, but setup moves are usually hard to utilize in the VGC metagame. Gigalith is capable of setting up Sandstorm in case the team lacks Tyranitar, and can be more successful at it than others due to Sturdy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Any Pokemon with a high Special Attack stat that can even hit Gigalith for neutral damage will cause it trouble, as outside of sand, Gigalith's Special Defense is lacking. Some of these Pokemon include Latios, Hydreigon, and others. Priority attacks such as Scizor's Bullet Punch and Azumarill's Aqua Jet give Gigalith trouble, hitting for super effective damage and instantly knocking it out once Sturdy is activated. Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Hitmontop and Gyarados, stop Gigalith from doing much damage, and if Trick Room isn't able to be set up due to Taunt or the Trick Room user is being KOed, Gigalith is just a sitting duck to all attacks. However, the opponent must still watch out for Explosion. Pokemon with Wide Guard such as Hitmontop stop all of Gigalith's attacks on the main set, severely crippling it, and a burn from Sableye's or Dusclops's Will-o-Wisp reduces Gigalith's Attack stat to near-useless levels. Ferrothorn is a fantastic counter, outpacing Gigalith in Trick Room, taking barely anything from its attacks, while hitting back hard with Power Whip. A great and easy way to get rid of Sturdy is Hail, and Abomasnow can easily finish the job with Giga Drain.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Boom Boom Rock": {
        "description": "<p>This set is meant to emphasize Gigalith's best perk: its fantastic Attack stat. Rock Slide is a fantastic STAB, hitting both opponents, and it gets even more power with a Rock Gem. Earthquake is another great spread attack, hitting Steel-types such as Heatran super effectively. Explosion is for when Gigalith is done with its job, and it gets insanely powerful when boosted by a Normal Gem. Protect allows Gigalith to live an extra turn, and allows its partner to get rid of a threat or set up Trick Room.</p> <p>252 EVs are put in HP and Attack, and 4 in Defense, which are easily the best of Gigalith's stats. Sturdy is ideal to prolong Gigalith's role on the field to try and take out as many of the opponents Pokemon as possible. However, if Gigalith is being used on a sand abusing Trick Room team, Sand Force is a better ability to use. A Choice Band can possibly be used over Rock or Normal Gem, replacing Protect with Rock Blast, which hits through opponents who use Substitute, and beats one of the most common Trick Room counter: Imprison Chandelure.</p> <p>Trick Room allies that are immune to Earthquake, such as Cresselia, Musharna, and Bronzong, pair up great with Gigalith. Ghost-type Trick Room partners, such as Dusclops and Jellicent, are also good to use, since they are immune to Gigalith's Explosion, and are almost guaranteed to set up Trick Room. Gastrodon is an effective partner, drawing Water-type attacks away from Gigalith except for Surf and Muddy Water, giving it one less thing to worry about. Pokemon that set up sand, namely Tyranitar and Hippowdon, form good synergy with Gigalith, seeing as it gets a Special Defense boost in the sand. However, when using any three of these Pokemon, they all share the same Grass-type weakness, both Gigalith and Tyranitar or Hippowdon share a Water-type weakness, and Gigalith and Tyranitar are extra-weak to Fighting, so one must watch out for this.</p>"

With priority Encore, Taunt, and just about everything else it could ask for bar Sleep Powder, Whimsicott is well-equipped to make your opponents' blood boil. While it might have procured a few more enemies in the transition from VGC 2011 to VGC 2012, such as Abomasnow and Ninetales, it's still as annoying as ever, earning it the rightful title of Prankster.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Any good prankster has an extra joy buzzer or whoopee cushion lying around, and Whimsicott is no exception. In fact, just about any non-attacking move Whimsicott learns could be used by a skilled player to great effect. Tickle, Charm, and Fake Tears lower your opponent's stats to soften them up, allowing your teammates to deal with the weakened Pokemon more easily. Light Screen and Safeguard are two good field effects, but Whimsicott unfortunately cannot utilize a dual screens combination, as it lacks Reflect. Swagger is usually frowned upon because of the luck factor, but it's another move that can incapacitate or otherwise annoy opponents further. Additionally, Swagger can even be combined with a Persim Berry, Lum Berry, or Whimsicott's Safeguard to raise your teammate's Attack by two stages with no drawbacks, which makes for a potent combination.</p> <p>Less effective, but still viable options include Memento, Leech Seed, Switcheroo, and Stun Spore. Memento can be a last-ditch effort to leave a mark on the opponent by severely crippling the opponent's offensive Pokemon, though they can simply switch out to rid themselves of the stat drops. Leech Seed can be used to gain some residual damage, extra health, or on the Level 1 Trick Room set, finish off an opponent, albeit at the end of the turn. Switcheroo, while unfortunately illegal with Encore, can hand off a crippling item such as Lagging Tail, Iron Ball, or a Choice item, and also gives you hints as to the opponent's strategy. Stun Spore works similarly to Tailwind, but it only hits one Pokemon, has 75% accuracy, and can be blocked by Berries or Safeguard. Beat Up in conjunction with Terrakion was a popular strategy in VGC 2011, but with Swift Swim and Chlorophyll abusers around every corner, it isn't as effective anymore. Lastly, Hurricane is Whimsicott's only other worthwhile offensive move besides Hidden Power; it could work in rain for the 30% chance of confusion, and also hits common Fighting-types for decent damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Whimsicott's antics have earned it some common enemies, forcing it to be ever-vigilant. Abomasnow and Ninetales have Heat Wave and Blizzard to roast or freeze Whimsicott alive, and their teammates will usually do the same. Chandelure and Heatran don't care too much about Tailwind, and in Chandelure's case, Endeavor, and of course have STAB Fire-type moves to incinerate Whimsicott. Metagross is able to use Ice Punch, doesn't mind Encore or Taunt, and also packs Bullet Punch to KO Trick Room variants. Discharge + Earthquake is the bane of Trick Room Whimsicott; similarly, double Blizzard plagues standard Whimsicott. If Whimsicott is not using Taunt, Sableye's own priority Taunt will completely shut down Whimsicott.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Supporter": {
        "description": "<p>Tailwind support is one of Whimsicott's many talents, and perhaps the most useful. Doubling your Pokemon's Speed is increasingly valuable in a metagame swimming with Drizzle and Drought abusers, and the threat of Encore and Taunt can keep Trick Room at bay. For many reasons, Encore is the preferred second move. First and foremost, If your opponent Protects or sets up their field effects, you can lock them into a useless move for a few turns, potentially until Encore runs out of PP or your timer is running short because of Encore's priority. If the opponent is locked into a useless move, you can gang up on it more easily as it will most likely switch or fail to Protect itself. Encore can be slightly situational, so Taunt is an acceptable alternative. Taunt prevents field effects from going up and opponents from using Protect, allowing your partner to safely dispatch the Taunted Pokemon or at least dent the switch-in.</p> <p>Giga Drain's main purpose is to keep Whimsicott from being Taunt bait, but it does have the perk of healing Whimsicott and dealing respectable amounts of damage to Pokemon it hits super effectively. For example, it 2HKOes 4 HP Terrakion and 252 HP Gastrodon, and OHKOes any Kabutops without a Rindo Berry or Focus Sash. Protect is a standard move in VGC, especially as Whimsicott has a tendency to be double-targeted. If you don't feel like playing conservatively with Whimsicott, Helping Hand can easily take Protect's place as your opponent probably won't want to Protect in front of Whimsicott until you reveal you don't have Encore or Whimsicott bites the dust.</p> <p>The EV spread lets Whimsicott Speed tie with or outspeed other Whimsicott, Thundurus, and Tornadus in order to Taunt or Encore them before they can do the same to you. If you're feeling particularly unlucky or don't want to risk the tie, a Mental Herb can be used in Focus Sash's place. If you want more Giga Drain recovery, you can consider moving the HP EVs into one of Whimsicott's defenses so Giga Drain will recover a greater percentage of its HP. The fourth slot is also flexible; moves such as Light Screen, Stun Spore, and Fake Tears are excellent replacements. Fake Tears in particular helps Whimsicott recover more health with Giga Drain.</p> <p>Being a fluffy cottonball with noodles for limbs, Whimsicott obviously isn't doing much without teammates to take advantage of its support. Pokemon that can make use of Tailwind are obvious teammates; a few examples are Hydreigon, Chandelure, Heatran, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H. The majority of these Pokemon also discourage the use of Blizzard and Heat Wave. Hydreigon can make use of Whimsicott's ability to prevent unexpected Protects to fire off devastating Draco Meteors, and Chandelure can reverse Trick Room if you're concerned about it getting up between Encore and Taunt. Pairing Whimsicott with a Fake Out user is a great way to pressure the opponent into Protecting, though it works better if you lead with a more immediately threatening Pokemon and switch to Whimsicott. Mienshao and Hitmontop are good standbys that are fortunate enough to possess both Fake Out and Wide Guard, while still maintaining a solid offensive presence. Furthermore, Hitmontop can play mind games with Sucker Punch, daring the opponent to select a support move to dodge it, and if you're using Taunt, Sucker Punch is guaranteed to hit.</p>"
      },
      "Level 1 Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Similar to FEARgle of the late VGC 2010, Level 1 Whimsicott aims to set up Trick Room and bring the opponent down to at least 12 HP, at which point even a feather could KO even the beefiest of opponents. Encore is a great move to have on any Whimsicott, and this set is no different. One could even argue that Level 1 Whimsicott makes the most use of it, since after a successful setup, the opponent will be even more hard-pressed to select Protect to keep their precious Pokemon's HP from being taken down to near zero in one hit. Taunt is completely acceptable as well to prevent them from using Protect to thwart Endeavor or your teammate's attacks or reversing Trick Room. Protect is vital on this set, as opponents may pack more than one priority user or Pokemon with access to ExtremeSpeed—such as Lucario and Dragonite—and double target Whimsicott in hopes of crushing the fluffy menace.</p> <p>The EVs, IVs, and nature are all geared towards raising Whimsicott's Special Defense; the only purpose of this is so Download Porygon2 and Porygon-Z receive a boost for Attack instead of Special Attack.</p> <p>Unless your opponent has vision problems, mental handicaps, or is waving to their friends and family at his first VGC event and not looking at the screen during Team Preview, your opponent is most likely going to notice that your Whimsicott is Level 1. This throws any semblance of surprise factor out the window, so usual Trick Room supporters work best here.</p> <p>Hitmontop and Hariyama both possess Fake Out, Wide Guard, and priority moves to finish off Pokemon weakened by Endeavor. Scrafty may not have Wide Guard or priority moves, but it can still take a bite out of Ghost-types hoping to absorb Endeavor with Crunch. Scizor is widely known for its priority Bullet Punch, but it can also use Feint to break through Protect and finish off weakened Pokemon, or gang up on an unfortunate victim to ensure Endeavor succeeds. Togekiss is a great Follow Me user, and it can also use ExtremeSpeed and Air Slash to finish what Whimsicott started. Clefable is another good Follow Me user to use in Trick Room. In addition to forming a cute combination with Whimsicott, it can use a Toxic Orb and Magic Guard to avoid a crippling Spore or Sleep Powder.</p> <p>Leading with another Trick Room user, such as Gallade or Jellicent, might look like a bad idea, but if you're confident with your prediction skills, you can run circles around Trick Room's usual checks. Beyond support Pokemon, familiar faces such as Snorlax and Rhyperior make good Trick Room attackers.</p>"

  "Krookodile": {
    "overview": "<p>Krookodile was a common Pokemon in the VGC 2011 metagame, and it's easy to see why. It has a great base 117 Attack stat as well as Intimidate, an ability which is almost priceless in VGC 2012, as it weakens physical threats such as Scizor and Tyranitar. In addition, Krookodile also has great offensive typing; its Ground / Dark typing has great neutral coverage on the majority of the VGC 2012 Pokemon. Its typing is also decent defensively, giving it four resistances, most notably to Rock-types, and two immunities, including one to Electric-type attacks. Because of this, Krookodile can be used in tandem with an Electric-type Pokemon, such as Zapdos, to form the \"DisQuake\" combination. However, this is where the party ends for Krookodile; its typing also gives it five weaknesses, all of which are common offensive types such as Water, Ice, Fighting, and Grass. Krookodile's 95 / 70 / 70 defenses aren't helping it much either, and its Speed is somewhat lacking, leaving it open to faster Pokemon such as Infernape and Terrakion. However, if one needs a Pokemon with a great ability and good offensive capabilities, Krookodile is definitely a Pokemon to consider.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Krookodile has many options outside of the ones already mentioned. Beat Up can be utilized along with a partner with Justified, such as Terrakion, giving the Pokemon with Justified a +4 Attack boost. However, Whimsicott is a better user of Beat Up due to it being faster than all of the Pokemon with Justified, and Krookodile has better options anyways. Bulldoze can be used to lower both of the opponents' Speed by one stage; however, the power drop between Bulldoze and Earthquake is too much to be considered, especially when one takes into account the 25 percent drop in power that Bulldoze incurs when hitting both foes. Fire Fang can be used to hit Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Scizor harder, though that's about all it does. Thunder Fang can be used to hit Water-type Pokemon harder, but Krookodile shouldn't be facing Water-type Pokemon anyways, especially since most of them, such as Kingdra and Ludicolo, have secondary types that give them a neutrality to Electric-type attacks. Taunt can be used to shut down moves such as Trick Room or Spore, but most users of these moves are usually holding a Mental Herb, so look out for that.</p> <p>Moxie may be used over Intimidate if one likes the Attack boost that Krookodile gets after every KO, but it is unreliable and Intimidate's usefulness it too good to pass up. Item-wise, a Choice Scarf can be used to outspeed faster Pokemon, such as Latios, Latias, and Infernape, giving Krookodile the chance to OHKO them with its STAB attacks. Another possibility for its item is a Dark Gem, which grabs Crunch some important KOs; it OHKOes Reuniclus, has a good chance to OHKO 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD Dusknoir, and deals major damage to both Dusclops and Cresselia. Ground Gem can also be used to power up Earthquake, which is useful since it loses power due to double battle mechanics. Yache Berry is the last useful item that Krookodile can effectively utilize, allowing it to survive an Ice-type attack, giving Krookodile the chance to retaliate.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>While Krookodile has near perfect coverage with its STAB moves, there are a few Pokemon that give it some trouble. Hydreigon resists Crunch and is immune to Earthquake, and can OHKO Krookodile with Draco Meteor. Heracross is another Pokemon that resists both of its STAB moves, while OHKOing back with STAB attacks of its own. Breloom and Virizion are also good Krookodile counters, as they resist every option outside of Low Sweep, and can OHKO Krookodile with any STAB of theirs; Virizion even gets an Attack boost if hit by Crunch, which is useful for the opponent.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Rotom-W, have little trouble taking an attack from Krookodile and then OHKOing it with Water-type STAB attacks. Rotom-W is even immune to Earthquake, making it a more reliable check. Amoonguss can tank a hit, cripple Krookodile with Spore, or just attack it with Giga Drain. Bulky Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Machamp and Hitmontop, resist Crunch, have Wide Guard to block Earthquake, and can use powerful Fighting-type STAB attacks to OHKO Krookodile. Faster Pokemon, such as Latios, Infernape, and Terrakion can all use their attacks to OHKO Krookodile, though none of them will like to take a super effective STAB attack from Krookodile. Trick Room is also a good check to Krookodile, as Krookodile's relatively high base Speed will make it move later in Trick Room.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>While this set isn't very different from the set commonly used in VGC 2011, it is still very effective in VGC 2012. Crunch and Earthquake are Krookodile's STAB moves, and, between them, it obtains near perfect coverage, which is impressive considering the number of Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame. Crunch nails common Psychic-type Pokemon, such as Latios, Latias, Musharna, and Cresselia for super effective damage, while Earthquake gives Krookodile a great STAB move, as well as a way to hit Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Metagross, and Ninetales. The third moveslot depends on what the team needs; Rock Slide gives Krookodile another coverage move, allowing it to nail Pokemon such as Yanmega and Volcarona in addition to other Pokemon such as Zapdos for heavy damage. However, Low Sweep can be used to make the opponent's Pokemon slower, supporting not only itself but also its teammates. Protect is not only useful for keeping Focus Sash intact by fending off Fake Out, but also for keeping Krookodile alive long enough so its partner can take out a threat.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Krookodile to outspeed neutral-natured Pokemon with base 90 Speed or below while maintaining offensive power. The remaining EVs are placed in HP to slightly increase Krookodile's bulk. However, if one is worried about opposing Krookodile, a spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe can be used to speed tie with other Adamant Krookodile. Another way to optimize Krookodile's EVs is to use a spread of 92 HP / 252 Atk / 164 Spe in order to guarantee outpacing Pokemon with base 80 Speed, such as Mamoswine and Chandelure. Finally, a spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe can be used to maximize Krookodile's bulk, while still outspeeding Cresselia, a common threat.</p> <p>The item choice comes down to personal preference. A Focus Sash can be used to ensure that Krookodile won't be OHKOed, which is useful considering its weakness to common types in the metagame. However, a Chople Berry can be used as well, ensuring that Krookodile will survive a Fighting-type attack, most notably Infernape's and Terrakion's Close Combat, and have a chance to retaliate with Earthquake. This also opens up the opportunity for a teammate to hold a Focus Sash, which can be useful when making a team. The choice of ability may look odd to players who are new to VGC 2012, but Intimidate is much more effective than Moxie, as it lowers the Attack stat of both opposing Pokemon by one stage; this can easily be the difference between a KO and barely surviving.</p> <p>Any Pokemon that can take care of Krookodile's weaknesses is a great partner, and there are numerous Pokemon that fit this description. Pokemon such as Zapdos and Thundurus can nail Water-, Fighting-, Grass-, and Bug-type Pokemon thanks to their super effective STAB attacks. They also allow Krookodile to use Earthquake without worrying about hitting its partner; keep in mind, however, that this combination shares an Ice-type weakness. Rotom-H is another good partner, hitting Water-, Grass-, Bug- and Ice-types with its STAB attacks, also forming \"DisQuake\" thanks to Levitate. Krookodile can take care of the Rock-types that trouble Rotom-H by using Earthquake, but this combination adds an extra Water-type weakness. Other Fire-type Pokemon, such as Chandelure, can deal with Grass-, Bug-, and Ice-type Pokemon that give Krookodile trouble, but they don't have Levitate to evade Earthquake. Finally, Thunder Wave support from Cresselia and Musharna work, as they can cripple faster Pokemon and use Helping Hand to boost Earthquake, themselves immune to it due to Levitate and Telepathy, respectively.</p>"

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn is one of the best tanks in the VGC 2012 metagame, with defensive stats superior to most Pokemon legal in the VGC 2012 metagame. Ferrothorn's strong defenses are backed up by its superb typing, Grass / Steel, which leaves it weak to just two types of attacks, Fighting and Fire. More importantly, it resists many attacking types commonly used in the VGC 2012 metagame, including Water, Rock, Electric, and Dragon. This allows Ferrothorn to switch in with relative ease and set up Leech Seed. Ferrothorn is at its best against teams based around rain, as it walls many common threats to rain teams. Ferrothorn is not without its weaknesses, however. Its 4x weakness to Fire-type attacks make it extremely vulnerable to a number of common Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame, and one must be very careful when playing with Ferrothorn to avoid getting caught off guard by one. Lastly, Ferrothorn's paltry base 20 Speed makes it one of the slowest Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame. This can be taken advantage of with Trick Room, or you can just accept that Ferrothorn will move last every turn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Other move options include Substitute, Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Explosion. Substitute is preferable in Trick Room, as it will allow Ferrothorn to use the move before potentially being hit by a status move, one of its prime downfalls. Toxic is an option for more passive damage, but it should be noted that Poison- and Grass-types, Poison Heal Breloom, and other Ferrothorn are immune to both Toxic and Leech Seed. If you use Thunder Wave, Gyro Ball should be replaced with Iron Head because it will be much weaker due to the opponent's lower Speed. Explosion allows Ferrothorn to go out with a bang, but make sure that its teammate either resists or is immune to the move. A more offensive set is possible; with 244 Attack EVs and a Brave nature, Gyro Ball will OHKO a number of common Pokemon, including Toxicroak. This setup can catch an opponent off guard, but Ferrothorn will not be able to take hits as well. One possible way to enjoy the best of both worlds would be to set up Trick Room, enabling Ferrothorn to move before Pokemon that threaten it and knock them out with a powerful Gyro Ball or Power Whip. As for items, Occa Berry is an option to help Ferrothorn survive one Fire-type attack, but Leftovers offers more long-term sustainability.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Zapdos counters Ferrothorn very well, taking minimal damage from its attacks and 2HKOing it with Heat Wave. Fire-type Pokemon such as Chandelure, Ninetales, and Infernape threaten to OHKO Ferrothorn and are unafraid of it as well. Salamence and Togekiss are other special attackers that have access to Heat Wave, and the move is always an option on them if you feel that Ferrothorn is a threat to your team. Hitmontop has a 68.75% chance to OHKO the standard Ferrothorn with Fighting Gem-boosted Close Combat and does not take significant damage from Ferrothorn in return. Hidden Power Fire is an option on any special attacker to deal with Ferrothorn easily, but is not recommended unless your team has a significant weakness to Ferrothorn. Pokemon packing sleep-inducing moves can keep Ferrothorn in check for a time, as they will almost assuredly outspeed it and put it to sleep before it can move. However, most Pokemon that commonly carry sleep moves in VGC 2012 cannot deal significant damage to Ferrothorn, so it is unwise to rely solely on them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>This moveset takes advantage of Ferrothorn's capabilities by focusing on its defensive potential while still allowing it to threaten opposing Pokemon. Your main plan with Ferrothorn should be to Leech Seed your opponent's Pokemon and stall with Protect. Power Whip's damage potential is not to be underestimated, as Ferrothorn has a reasonable base 94 Attack and receives STAB on the attack. Ground / Water-type Pokemon, such as Gastrodon and Swampert, are common in the VGC 2012 metagame, and Power Whip scores a 4x super effective hit on both of them. Gyro Ball takes advantage of the STAB bonus in addition to Ferrothorn's low Speed stat, but unfortunately does not have good coverage.</p> <p>A Relaxed nature is used to maximize Ferrothorn's stats by boosting its high base Defense, and the focus is placed on Defense EVs because the majority of the Pokemon that threaten it are physical attackers. Because Ferrothorn resists most commonly seen special attacks, it doesn't need a lot of investment in Special Defense. The given EV spread allows Ferrothorn, if originally at full health, to survive three Blizzards from Abomasnow provided that you still have two Pokemon on your side of the field, which will limit Abomasnow's Blizzard. It is possible to use a more specially defensive EV spread, which would allow Ferrothorn to take Heat Wave from Pokemon such as Infernape and Zapdos more comfortably; this would also enable Ferrothorn to wall Water-type Pokemon even more easily. You can also elect to run even more Defense EVs, which would help against Fighting-type threats such as Hitmontop and Terrakion.</p>"

  "Chandelure": {
    "overview": "<p>Possessing a great Special Attack stat, immunities to Normal-, Fighting-, and Fire-type moves, and a great spread move in Heat Wave, Chandelure is a major threat in the VGC 2012 metagame. With the prevalence of weather and Trick Room teams, Chandelure can either act as a great counter to them, or operate effectively under those conditions. However, Chandelure must constantly be on the lookout for opposing spread attacks, as it is hit super effectively by Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Surf, three of the most common spread moves in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Imprison allows Chandelure to shut down Trick Room teams; however, it is hard to give up Protect for Imprison, as the former is a crucial move that guarantees Chandelure a degree of survivability in this hostile metagame. Psychic hits Terrakion, Hitmontop, and Toxicroak very hard, although Terrakion will not be KOed by Psychic, taking 79.8% even without sandstorm. Hidden Power Ground is an option if you are especially afraid of Heatran. Hidden Power Fighting does decent damage against Tyranitar, but other Pokemon are more suited in taking it down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Rain teams are the bane of Chandelure's existence, weakening its Heat Wave, while its opponents, such as Ludicolo, Politoed, and Kingdra, all carry super effective Water-type attacks that will OHKO. Tyranitar is also a great counter, as Crunch, Rock Slide, and Earthquake all do super effective damage on Chandelure, dispatching it quickly. Heatran resists Shadow Ball and gets a Flash Fire boost from Heat Wave, making it an efficient counter to Chandelure. Hitmontop and Toxicroak both do major damage to Chandelure with Sucker Punch; however, care must be given that Chandelure has taken damage previously, as their attacks will not faint Chandelure at full health, and Chandelure can deal major damage with Heat Wave.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Heat Wave is the main attack of this set; coupled with Chandelure's monstrous base 145 Special Attack and STAB, it will do major damage to both of your opponent's Pokemon, potentially KOing them. Shadow Ball allows Chandelure to hit single targets for good damage, while eliminating threats such as opposing Chandelure, Cresselia, and Slowking. Depending on your team, Trick Room can either give bulky Pokemon on your team an advantage over foes which would normally outspeed them, or remove Trick Room that has already been set up. Finally, Protect allows Chandelure to shield itself from the barrage of super effective attacks that are common in this metagame, such as Earthquake, Rock Slide, and more; this also gives your teammate an opportunity to eliminate the threat to Chandelure.</p> <p>Chandelure's item of choice is Fire Gem, which boosts the power of its Heat Wave once, allowing it to deal massive damage to both of your opponent's Pokemon. Life Orb is a good choice too, giving Chandelure a constant boost in its attacks, though this comes with the drawback of losing 10% of its HP each attack. Focus Sash is another solid item choice, as it gives Chandelure a second wind against super effective attacks, allowing it to hit back hard once more before going down.</p> <p>252 Special Attack EVs are self-explanatory, allowing Chandelure to hit its opponents the hardest. However, the EV investment gets a bit trickier from this point. If it being used on a Trick Room team, Chandelure can opt to use a Quiet nature with 252 HP EVs and 0 Spe IVs, giving it maximum Speed under Trick Room. The 4 EVs in Special Defense ensure that Porygon-Z does not snag a Special Attack boost from Download. However, if you're not running a Trick Room set, one can invest in Chandelure's HP for bulk, or in Speed. HP investment allows Chandelure to live through attacks such as Rock Slide and Hitmontop's Sucker Punch, and extends its longevity; it also allows Chandelure to run a Modest nature, boosting its Special Attack further. However, a spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe coupled with a Timid nature allows Chandelure to outspeed Adamant Mamoswine, KOing it before it can use Earthquake. All in all, running a bulky Chandelure is much more effective, as it gives Chandelure much needed bulk, while Speed only allows Chandelure to outspeed one threat.</p> <p>Ferrothorn is an effective teammate to Chandelure, as it draws Fire- and Fighting-type attacks, giving Chandelure an opportunity to switch in safely and also possibly snag a Flash Fire boost. Furthermore, Ferrothorn can eliminate Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types—especially Tyranitar—that threaten Chandelure. Fighting-type teammates such as Hitmontop are very effective as well, eliminating Dark- and Rock-types that plague Chandelure. Hitmontop is an especially effective partner, as it carries priority attacks that can KO foes that are weakened by Chandelure's Heat Wave. It can also utilize Wide Guard, blocking spread attacks such as Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Surf that would normally KO Chandelure. Finally, its ability, Intimidate, weakens the physical attacks of its enemies, allowing Chandelure to survive a physical hit or two. Finally, teammates that can set up Trick Room prior to Chandelure switching in do it a great service. With Trick Room up, Chandelure can immediately start hitting its foes for massive damage.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Chandelure acts as a strong revenge killer, outspeeding most of the Pokemon in this metagame without a Choice Scarf or a Speed boost from the weather. Heat Wave is its main form of offense, dealing heavy damage to opponents that do not resist it. Shadow Ball acts as its secondary STAB attack, dealing damage to a single opponent. Hidden Power Ice allows Chandelure to hit Dragon-types super effectively, especially Garchomp, that otherwise threaten Chandelure with a super effective Earthquake. Finally, Overheat does massive damage to one single target, potentially KOing it, with the drawback of lowering Chandelure's Special Attack. However, if you desire more coverage, Energy Ball can be used to hit Water-types for super effective damage.</p> <p>252 EVs each are invested in Special Attack and Speed, maximizing its Special Attack and Speed; this allows Chandelure to act as an efficient revenge killer and attacker. Timid is used in order to outspeed Pokemon with base 130 Speed, such as Modest Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Timid Choice Scarf Politoed, Aerodactyl, and Crobat. However, if you prefer the extra boost in power, Modest is a suitable alternative.</p> <p>Chandelure appreciates having a teammate that resists the Ghost-, Dark-, Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type attacks that neutralize it. As stated before, Ferrothorn is an excellent choice, resisting four of the five mentioned, and boasting excellent defenses. Due to the popularity of spread moves, Chandelure appreciates Wide Guard support, something that Hitmontop, Conkeldurr, and Hariyama can reliably provide. A Dusknoir running Imprison or a Whimsicott running Taunt can also be an effective remedy against opponents which set up Trick Room, making them excellent partners for Chandelure should it be faced with the field effect.</p>"

While great offensively, Fire- and Bug-types make a poor defensive combination, cursing Volcarona with weaknesses to common spread moves, such as Rock Slide and Surf. It also needs a little team support to get going, as it can otherwise be a sitting duck against sand and rain teams.

While these moves cannot hit two opponents at once, they can be used for the boost in power they provide compared to Heat Wave. SolarBeam is an interesting option on a sun team, but most of SolarBeam's targets will be found on sand and rain teams, which reduces its effectiveness. Hurricane is an interesting option; it allows Volcarona to perform in or against rain teams, and also has an added chance of confusing the opponent. However, Hurricane's accuracy receives a huge drop in sunlight, while rain weakens Volcarona's Fire-type STAB moves, making the two incompatible. Psychic can reliably defeat Fighting-types, which usually carry Rock-type moves. Volcarona is one of the select few Pokemon that can viably use stat-boosting moves in VGC 2012, making Quiver Dance an attractive option. While using Quiver Dance requires more team support than usual, it can prove extremely potent if used correctly.</p> <p>Volcarona also receives solid support options besides the listed Rage Powder, such as Safeguard and Sunny Day. Though these could probably be used to better effect on bulkier Pokemon, they allow Volcarona to become a little more independent, protecting itself from negative effects, such as rain and paralysis. Fire and Bug Gems help Volcarona score OHKOs on certain Pokemon, such as Zapdos and Tyranitar. However, Focus Sash is too good of an item for Volcarona to pass up, so Gems should be used only if you are in desperate need of them. Hidden Power Rock hits both Fire- and Dragon-types that give Volcarona headaches, though it lacks the power to reliably defeat Dragon-types, and also requires a different EV spread. If you're not concerned about Water-type moves and have another Pokemon in need of a Focus Sash, Charti Berry will protect Volcarona from at least one Rock Slide, provided Volcarona is in good condition.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In general, Pokemon that can use Rock Slide and either take a hit from or outspeed Volcarona are instantly threats. Tyranitar can effectively strip Volcarona of its Focus Sash, though it's better off not going up against Volcarona directly due to Bug Buzz. Terrakion can outspeed and OHKO most Volcarona, or at least knock it down to its Focus Sash with Rock Slide. Heatran, though relatively uncommon, walls all Volcarona that lack Hidden Power Ground. Gyarados will also wall Volcarona, and can easily KO it with Waterfall or Rock Slide, or paralyze Volcarona to make it dead weight; Salamence and Dragonite similarly take little damage and can prey on its low Defense by nailing it with Rock-type moves. Trick Room is a large thorn in any fast and frail attacker's side, and Volcarona is no exception. However, common Trick Room leads will not enjoy taking Volcarona's STAB moves, and Fake Out users run the risk of getting burned by Flame Body. On rain teams, Swift Swim Pokemon such as Kabutops and Kingdra can douse Volcarona before it can move.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This set aims to use Volcarona's great coverage and awesome offensive stats to their maximum potential. Heat Wave and Bug Buzz are two potent STAB moves, allowing Volcarona to hit multiple Pokemon at once and leave large dents in Psychic-types, respectively. The move used in the third slot depends largely on what you want Volcarona to be able to defeat. Hidden Power Ice is the most useful move, as it can destroy the common Dragon-types that normally wall Volcarona, such as Salamence and Dragonite. Hidden Power Ground decimates Heatran, who otherwise walls Volcarona, and powers through opposing Fire-types, such as Chandelure and Arcanine. Rage Powder might seem like an odd move to use on such a frail Pokemon, but it allows Volcarona to redirect priority moves, such as Bullet Punch and Mach Punch, possibly burning the offender thanks to Flame Body. Focus Sash and Protect act as safety nets, ensuring Volcarona isn't taken out too early by a surprise Rock Slide.</p> <p>The EVs and nature increase Volcarona's offensive stats, as little benefit comes from investing in Volcarona's low defenses. Maximum Speed allows Volcarona to tie with Salamence, Zapdos, and opposing Volcarona, while 252 Special Attack EVs let Volcarona hit as hard as possible. A Modest nature can also be used for more power, though the loss in Speed means it will be outpaced by positive-natured Salamence and Zapdos. When using Hidden Power Ground, an EV spread of 4 HP / 4 Def / 248 SpA / 252 Spe is recommended to account for the IV drop.</p> <p>Heatran, Terrakion, and Rock Slide users in general are big problems for Volcarona; therefore, Fighting-types, such as Conkeldurr and Hitmontop, make perfect teammates. The aforementioned Pokemon can take down most of Volcarona's counters while providing Wide Guard support to protect Volcarona from Rock Slide and Surf. In return, Volcarona can KO the bulky Psychic-types, such as Cresselia, Musharna, and Reuniclus, that threaten said Fighting-types. Ninetales provides support from Drought, which will make Volcarona's Heat Wave even more fearsome. Sun support also helps Volcarona defensively, as it nullifies Volcarona's weakness to common Water-type moves, such as Surf. However, it should be noted that when pairing Volcarona with Ninetales, the Rock weaknesses add up, increasing the need for Wide Guard support.</p>"

  "Dugtrio": {
    "overview": "<p>Dugtrio is an interesting Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame. It might not seem like the most appealing Pokemon to use, especially when options such as Excadrill and Garchomp are available. In fact, thanks to its mere base 80 Attack and 35 / 50 / 70 defenses, Dugtrio seems appalling when compared to other attackers; however, it has a base 120 Speed stat and some nifty options for attacking and supporting, such as Final Gambit, Memento, and Reversal. Dugtrio can also serve as a trap, holding Intimidated foes down until they're KOed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dugtrio has few other good options in its pool of tricks. Other offensive options can be used with Sand Force, such as Pursuit, Shadow Claw, and Rock Slide, can be used, but these are weak, especially off its base 80 Attack, which pales in comparison to other offensive sand sweepers. Dugtrio has access to Beat Up, which lets it pair nicely with Lucario and Terrakion to activate Justified and wreck havoc on the opposing team. Fissure can be used for lack of a better option. It can also quickly put up Substitute, which acts similarly to Protect, and blocks incoming Sucker Punches. However, Dugtrio's Substitutes will be very weak and easily broken.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Dugtrio gets screwed over pretty easily by lots of common Pokemon in the metagame, as well as priority and spread moves. In addition, it is hit for at least neutral damage by every spread move except Rock Slide. Dugtrio particularly fears Pokemon with a base Speed stat of 120 or higher, such as Weavile and Crobat, most of whom can easily KO Dugtrio. Bulky support Pokemon, such as Cresselia and Suicune, don't really care much for any of Dugtrio attacks, or being weakened by Memento. Fake Out from Hariyama and Hitmontop can break Dugtrio's Focus Sash and leave it vulnerable to almost any attack. Trick Room often makes Dugtrio the last Pokemon to move on the field, which leaves it wide open to any attack. Abomasnow and other hail sweepers can bring Dugtrio down to its Focus Sash with Blizzard and have hail damage finish it off for good.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Suicide Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Dugtrio is as frail as can be, which means that it won't be an attacker that will occupy the field for a very long time. Furthermore, even if it manages to survive for long, it won't be doing much damage to the opposition thanks to its base 80 Attack stat. However, it is far from completely useless. Dugtrio has some interesting options in the form of Memento and Final Gambit, which give Dugtrio a role as a supporting attacker on the field. Memento is good for severely crippling active Pokemon on the field, but should be saved for late-game, when there are no more partners the enemy could switch out to. Final Gambit is nearly the opposite of Memento in execution, in that it should be used as early in the game as possible to ensure maximum damage is dealt. Earthquake is Dugtrio's main attacking option; it collects a STAB bonus and is one of Dugtrio's strongest attacks. Reversal is an excellent option for a Pokemon as frail as Dugtrio. It has no issue being brought down to its Focus Sash, and will then be able to retaliate with Reversal. Sucker Punch can be used to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types as well, as it is Dugtrio's only priority move. Protect is amazing in the VGC metagame, especially for stalling, and provides good protection for one turn while partners help take care of threats.</p> <p>Focus Sash is the preferred item for Dugtrio, as this allows it to take on bigger threats in the metagame, such as Dragon Gem Latios and Fire Gem Chandelure, who otherwise have little problem taking care of it by tanking a hit and dealing one back. Dugtrio's Arena Trap ability works nicely with Intimidate users such as Arcanine and Salamence, as it traps weakened physical attackers, who are small threats that are easier to KO. Sand Veil is a worthy option, however, if Dugtrio is used on a sand team. A Jolly nature is optimal as it allows Dugtrio to outspeed numerous threats, such as Thundurus, Latios, and Gengar, while maximum Attack and Speed lets Dugtrio hit as hard and as fast as possible; however, an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe can be used if using Final Gambit.</p> <p>Tyranitar and Hippowdon make good partners as they easily summon a sandstorm upon switching in. However, they do compound the team's weakness to Grass- and Water-type moves, so be prepared. Dugtrio can rid sand teams of troublesome threats, such as Rotom-W and Hitmontop, by crippling them with Memento, which gives your team an easy opportunity to collect some offensive momentum. Bullet Punch and Mach Punch are troublesome for Dugtrio, so it enjoys Quick Guard support from Terrakion and Hitmontop. Follow Me and Rage Powder users are also good for diverting those priority moves, as well as other moves that could KO Dugtrio. Dugtrio can be somewhat of a utility for many teams, and pairs nicely with many different Pokemon because Memento enables it to cripple potential threats for your team. In addition to Quick Guard, the aforementioned Hitmontop can also provide Wide Guard, Intimidate, and Fake Out support.</p>"

  "Dodrio": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Dodrio has a decent base 100 Speed and an impressive base 110 Attack, its poor defenses and typing deny it a chance to shine in the VGC 2012 metagame. Dodrio is also unfortunately outclassed by the likes of Staraptor, which has the exact same typing as it as well as a higher Attack stat. However, with access to Brave Bird, Dodrio is able to KO some of the most common Pokemon, including Hitmontop, Abomasnow, Volcarona, and Ludicolo. Despite the fact that Dodrio has poor defenses and only average offensive stats, when partnered correctly, it can get some surprising KOs.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unfortunately, Dodrio's movepool is incredibly limited, and it doesn't have access to many other good moves. Steel Wing can hit Rock-types such as Tyranitar for decent damage, but Rock-types other than Tyranitar and Terrakion aren't so common. Toxic allows Dodrio to shut down walls such as Cresselia before it is KOed, but runs into the risk of being ruined by either Lum Berries or Rest. Sunny Day can be used to support a sun team, for obvious reasons. Drill Peck is an alternative option to Brave Bird; however, because Dodrio is already not very strong, Drill Peck will not get as many KOs as Brave Bird. The recoil damage is often insignificant as Dodrio will go down to a hit or two regardless. Focus Sash can be used to ensure that Dodrio gets one attack off before getting KOed, but as Brave Bird is often the main attack, it will just KO Dodrio after being used.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Because Dodrio's defensive stats are rather poor, it is easily OHKOed by strong STAB attacks. Examples include Zapdos's Thunderbolt and Tyranitar's Rock Slide. Electric-, Steel-, and Rock-type Pokemon, such as Zapdos, Thundurus, Metagross, and Tyranitar, all wall Dodrio, leaving it helpless. Dodrio also does not fare well against defensive walls that can soak hits, such as Cresselia. Sableye threatens to burn Dodrio with Will-o-Wisp and can use Trick to steal its Flying Gem.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This set's goal is to hit as hard as possible with two of Dodrio's strongest STAB attacking moves, Brave Bird and Return. Brave Bird KOes Hitmontop, Toxicroak, Abomasnow, and Ludicolo without rain before they are able to hit Dodrio. Return gives Dodrio more coverage, allowing it to hit Electric-types harder and not take any recoil damage. Quick Attack is excellent, finishing off Focus Sash users along with Pokemon that are close to fainting. It also allows Dodrio to deal some quick damage before getting KOed. However, Taunt can also be used to stop the likes of Cresselia and Amoonguss as Dodrio outspeeds them. Protect is necessary to increase Dodrio's longevity while its partner takes out common threats.</p> <p>Dodrio's EV spread is straightforward, but effective. With a Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment, it outspeeds anything with less than base 100 Speed. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Attack, allowing Dodrio to dish out as much damage as possible. Although Focus Sash is an excellent item, ensuring Dodrio can get at least one attack off before fainting, Brave Bird will KO Dodrio after it uses it. With a Flying Gem, Dodrio is able to get an incredibly powerful Brave Bird off, sending all Fighting-type Pokemon to oblivion.</p> <p>Because Dodrio's Speed is only decent, it appreciates being partnered with Pokemon that can slow down the opposing team with moves such as Thunder Wave and Icy Wind. Cresselia is an excellent example, disrupting the opponent's team while assisting Dodrio's offensive abilities. Dodrio also partners well with Fake Out users such as Hitmontop, Infernape, and Mienshao, all of which can use Fake Out to flinch faster Pokemon while Dodrio finishes the job with Brave Bird. As Dodrio is completely walled by Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon, it works great alongside Fighting- and Ground-type Pokemon. Terrakion has access to Rock Slide and Close Combat, taking out Pokemon that otherwise render Dodrio useless. Garchomp has access to Earthquake and Rock Slide and takes advantage of Dodrio's Flying-type to spam Earthquake. Tyranitar is slightly slower than both Terrakion and Garchomp but has more bulk, as well as access to Rock Slide and Low Kick.</p>"

While often overshadowed by Chandelure, Gengar has a few things Chandelure doesn't, namely a higher Speed stat and a lack of weakness to Water-type attacks. Gengar is a reliable Pokemon when looking for a Ghost-type attacker.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gengar can use Confuse Ray if you're feeling lucky, but this is generally an unreliable strategy. With a Focus Sash, Destiny Bond can be deadly if used with proper prediction; however due to double targeting and weather, its success rate is low. Taunt can be used, but Prankster Pokemon and faster users severely outclass Gengar at utilizing it. Substitute can also be used; however, Gengar needs as much of its HP as possible. Though Will-O-Wisp hampers physical attackers, Gengar does not have the bulk to survive an attack in the turn it takes to burn the opponent. In addition to these options, Gengar can also learn Icy Wind to control speed or even Giga Drain if you're worried about Swampert. Also with a Choice Scarf and a Modest nature, Gengar can be used successfully, outspeeding Ludicolo in the rain and OHKOing it with Sludge Bomb. Gengar also has access to Explosion, but it will not do much damage coming off of Gengar's base 65 Attack. To capitalize on the element of surprise, Gengar can also run Trick Room.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Tyranitar is a great check to Gengar, shrugging off its attacks and OHKOing it with Crunch. Sucker Punch users can also check Gengar easily with good prediction. If Gengar loses the speed tie against Latios, Latios's Psychic OHKOes Gengar. While Cresselia takes a lot of damage from Shadow Ball, it can retaliate with Thunder Wave, rendering Gengar useless for the rest of the match. Cresselia can also utilize STAB Psychic to deal massive damage to Gengar without any investment in Special Attack. Finally, because of Gengar's awful defenses, it can be swiftly dealt with by any strong offensive Pokemon with a decent STAB attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Casper the Unfriendly Ghost": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to counter common Pokemon while also dealing massive damage without support. Shadow Ball is Gengar's most important STAB dealing massive damage to anything that doesn't resist it, while tearing through Pokemon it hits super effectively. Thunderbolt is useful for countering common Water-types, often 2HKOing them due to Gengar's fantastic Special Attack stat. Depending on your team, Sludge Bomb can be used instead of Thunderbolt if Electric-type coverage isn't needed, giving Gengar a second STAB move as well as a way to OHKO 4 / 0 Ludicolo and Breloom. Hidden Power Ice not only provides excellent type coverage alongside Thunderbolt, but it also 2HKOes common threats such as Garchomp, Tornadus, and Thundurus. However, remember that Tornadus and Thundurus are faster than Gengar, so Tailwind support is crucial. Focus Blast deals damage to Tyranitar, although the accuracy leaves something to be desired. Protect is considered a staple in VGC, allowing you to shield your Pokemon for a turn and potentially eliminate the threat.</p> <p>The item choice comes down to personal preference. A Ghost Gem allows Gengar to OHKO Latios and 2HKO Dusclops and any Cresselia that have little Special Defense investment. However, a Focus Sash can be used if you're worried about Gengar's flaky defenses, as most Psychic- or Ghost-type attacks will OHKO it. Gengar needs as much Speed and Special Attack as possible to tie and OHKO Latios, while dealing as much damage as possible to Cresselia. In addition those listed above, Gengar can use a few other moves to counter specific Pokemon. Disable can be used instead of either Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Ice to shut down some of Gengar's counters. With good prediction, Gengar can also disable Hitmontop and Toxicroak's Sucker Punch, leaving both Pokemon unable to KO Gengar. If Focus Blast's accuracy isn't appealing, Hidden Power Fighting can be used instead, but the drop in power is noticeable. Gengar benefits greatly with Infernape as a teammate since Infernape can use Fake Out to assure Gengar will beat Latios and deal massive damage to Tyranitar with Close Combat.</p>"

Qwilfish is the only Swift Swim Pokemon able to use Explosion, but due to the changes to Explosion in BW, it isn't nearly as potent as it once was. However, if you need a Swift Swim Pokemon that can handle Ludicolo and Abomasnow, you might want to give Qwilfish a try.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Qwilfish's Dream World ability is Intimidate. While it is a good support ability, the loss of Swift Swim can be crippling. Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall, but the added power is often not worth giving up accuracy and the chance to flinch the opponent for Qwilfish. Thunder Wave and Taunt allow Qwilfish to play a bit of a support role on a team, paralyzing opponents or stopping moves such as Trick Room. Acid Spray is another interesting option, allowing Qwilfish to set an opponent up to be taken out by special attacks. Aqua Jet provides Qwilfish with a priority option, though it should be the fastest on the field if it is raining anyway. Lastly, Destiny Bond can be used over Explosion as a situational way to KO an opponent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Removing the rain or setting up Trick Room will quickly put Qwilfish out of its element, making it easy pickings for just about any special sweeper.

Explosion, though nerfed, can still deal considerable damage to the opponent and acts as a last ditch effort when faced with a poor match up.

Manual weather users, such as Thundurus, can also help set up Qwilfish for sweeping. To take greater advantage of the rain, Swift Swim Pokemon, such as Ludicolo and Kingdra, or Dragon-type Pokemon, such as Latios and Hydreigon, make effective partners. The former can keep up offensive pressure against the opponent, while the latter are able to switch in on attacks super effective on Qwilfish.

The VGC 2012 metagame continues this trend, as Raikou is still more than capable of being a dominant threat. The Crown Raikou event blessed it with new moves such as Weather Ball and Aura Sphere; however, Raikou can only use a Rash nature with these. While this does provide Raikou with extra power, it also prevents Raikou from outspeeding Pokemon with base 100 Speed, as well as Garchomp. On top of this, the drop in Special Defense leaves it more vulnerable to powerful special attacks. Non-event Raikou is viable as well, however, forgoing Weather Ball and Aura Sphere for Speed and bulk. Raikou can be a very effective Pokemon in VGC whichever way it's utilized, and it should never be underestimated.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A bulky set is viable considering Raikou has respectable HP and Defense stats. With a Modest nature and a spread of 252 HP / 64 Def / 60 SpA / 84 SpD / 48 Spe, Raikou survives a Dragon Gem Draco Meteor from Latios and a Fighting Gem Close Combat from Hitmontop. ExtremeSpeed can nab surprise kills on weakened or frail Pokemon. If your team struggles against bulky Psychic-types, such as Cresselia, Latias, and Gallade, Shadow Ball can be used to dent them, but it lacks significant coverage otherwise. Weather Ball is an excellent move for Raikou that allows it to function on any weather team. On rain teams, Raikou can wield an improved Thunder in addition to a 150 Base Power Water-type Weather Ball. Weather Ball Raikou is also great on sun teams that have problems getting past Water-types.</p> <p>An Electric Gem is useful for boosting Thunderbolt's power for one turn to deal massive damage to the target. Shuca Berry is also a good choice that allows Raikou to survive at least one Ground-type move, and is a bit more reliable than Air Balloon, which loses its effect if Raikou takes damage from an attack. Reflect and Light Screen are two interesting moves that Raikou can use to support itself and its team, and its Speed will allow it to set up either screen before your opponent can make a move the majority of the time. Dual screens Raikou should use a Timid nature and an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe. Discharge is a nifty option to possibly paralyze both opponents, but it only works effectively if Raikou's partner is immune to it or uses Protect that turn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Because of the drastic loss in Speed caused by using a Rash nature, Raikou is now outsped by a number of Pokemon, most notably Garchomp, which can take it out with a powerful Earthquake. Additionally, the drop in Special Defense will put Raikou in danger of powerful special moves such as Draco Meteor, Hydro Pump, Fire Blast, and others. If Raikou lacks Air Balloon, it will be more susceptible to Ground-types. Amoonguss is another good counter as it can sponge most of Raikou's attacks and put it to sleep with Spore.</p>",

Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Ice, and Aura Sphere provide phenomenal coverage in VGC, allowing it to strike the majority of the top threats for super effective damage. Thunderbolt is Raikou's main STAB move, and will significantly damage any target that does not resist it. Hidden Power Ice is the preferred coverage move as it allows Raikou to OHKO non-Yache Garchomp and severely damage most other Ground- and Dragon-types. However, it should be noted that Garchomp will outspeed Rash Raikou, which is where Air Balloon comes into play. If Gastrodon and Swampert are nuisances, Hidden Power Grass is viable as it deals a large amount of damage to them both. Aura Sphere is a very reliable Fighting-type move that allows Raikou to massacre Tyranitar, dent tanks such as Blissey and Snorlax, and consistently damage evasion abusers. Thunder and Rain Dance work well with each other as they enable Raikou to utilize its strongest STAB move that also has a 30% chance to paralyze its target. Protect allows Raikou to protect itself from harm for a turn, possibly while its partner takes out a threat. Rash Raikou would certainly make better use of Protect as the Speed drop enables threats such as Latios, Garchomp, and Terrakion to get the drop on it.</p> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Raikou to Speed-tie with positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon that themselves run maximum Speed. Air Balloon temporarily grants Raikou a Ground-type immunity and hence no weaknesses. Life Orb provides Raikou with extra power, but it will then be more susceptible to faster Earthquakes. A Rash nature gives Raikou a lot of extra power but the downside is the drop in Speed and additional vulnerability to special attacks. A Timid nature, on the other hand, allows it to outpace the majority of threats in the VGC 2012 metagame, but it will be much weaker and have less coverage. If Crown Raikou's Speed proves a big hassle, you can easily equip it with a Choice Scarf; however, its inability to change moves can be disadvantageous.</p> <p>Raikou's teammates should be able to handle fast Ground-types and special tanks. Choice Scarf Abomasnow is a noteworthy choice as it outpaces Garchomp, Landorus, and Latios, and can OHKO the former two while dealing plenty of damage to Latios. Also, the hail it summons turns Weather Ball into a 100 Base Power Ice-type move; Raikou can thus run Hidden Power Grass. Hitmontop also deserves a mention as it handles special tanks such as Tyranitar, Blissey, and Snorlax, while also having access to Wide Guard to save Raikou from Earthquake.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Though it faces stiff competition from all the Water-type Pokemon in VGC 2012, Suicune fills the role of a bulky team supporter well. Thanks to its great defenses, decent Speed and Special Attack, and pure Water typing with only two weaknesses, Suicune is rather difficult to KO. Combined with Suicune's wide arsenal of moves, which include Tailwind and Icy Wind, Suicune's value is easily apparent. However, like all Pokemon, Suicune has its flaws. Its average Special Attack makes it easy to wall, and the popularity of Pokemon such as Zapdos limit its success. Nevertheless, Suicune's great bulk and supportive capabilities make it a fine Pokemon to consider on any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Suicune doesn't get many viable options that have not been listed. ExtremeSpeed can be useful for picking off weakened Pokemon, but this is very situational, and Suicune can't afford to waste a moveslot. With maximum HP investment, Mirror Coat can KO Pokemon such as Zapdos and Thundurus. However, it is very unreliable, as Suicune needs to be attacked on the special side for it to work. If you're running hail, Blizzard gives Suicune a powerful spread move that complements its Water typing, but with all the other weather changers in VGC 2012, it's best to use the more reliable Ice Beam. Quash is an interesting move, but Suicune's average Speed means that it isn't the best user of this strategy. Roar can phaze out Pokemon trying to boost or set up Trick Room, but the former are uncommon in doubles. Finally, Reflect is a great support move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As Suicune is very versatile and bulky, one must be careful when trying to counter it. There are a few Pokemon that easily check it: bulky Grass-type Pokemon such as Abomasnow, Ludicolo, and Ferrothorn can take any attack Suicune can use, and hit it hard with their Grass STAB or use Leech Seed to pressure Suicune into switching out. As with most other Water Absorb and Storm Drain Pokemon, Gastrodon is immune to Scald, and has no problem sponging an Icy Wind. However, note that most of these Pokemon can't harm Suicune once it starts to set up Calm Mind boosts. Zapdos, Blissey and Chansey can take any attack Suicune can use and proceed to use Toxic, making Suicune easier to KO. However, the Crowncune and Calm Mind variants can both use Rest to remove Toxic, and then use Sheer Cold or set up, respectively. Pokemon such as Sableye can use priority Taunt, preventing Suicune from using Calm Mind or any of its supporting moves.</p> <p>Offensively, Thundurus, and other Electric-type Pokemon all threaten to 2HKO Suicune. Ninetales is a thorn in Suicune's side, as Drought activates Chlorophyll, enabling Pokemon such as Venusaur and Sawsbuck to outpace and can 2HKO Suicune; sunlight also weakens Suicune's Water STAB. Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Rotom-W and Metagross, can use Trick to give Suicune a Choice Scarf, which renders it almost useless for the remainder of the battle.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tailwind": {
        "description": "<p>With above-average bulk and a great typing, Suicune can use a Tailwind set to great effect. After Tailwind is set up, Suicune has no problem outpacing faster Pokemon such as Terrakion and Infernape. The choice of Water-type STAB is down to personal preference: Scald gives Suicune a 100% accurate move with a decent burn rate, while a Life Orb-boosted Hydro Pump can OHKO Tyranitar in neutral weather, though its accuracy is shaky and its PP is low. Ice Beam lets Suicune hit Pokemon such as Garchomp, Dragonite, and Latios for super effective damage, and also dents Zapdos and Thundurus. Calm Mind is a nice option that allows Suicune to use its great bulk to its advantage, making it even harder to KO. Protect is also a viable option, shielding Suicune from damage.</p> <p>The item choice depends on what Suicune needs to accomplish most. With a Wacan Berry, Zapdos's Thunder will never KO Suicune, enabling it to set up Tailwind or hit Zapdos with Ice Beam. Life Orb is also a viable option as the power boost lets Suicune hit harder; with a Life Orb equipped, Ice Beam can 2HKO 140/0 Zapdos. Sitrus Berry, once activated, restores a nice amount of health, and can provide a Suicune a crucial extra turn in the fight. In Tailwind, the above EV spread allows Suicune to outpace Modest Ludicolo in the rain, as well as Choice Scarf Terrakion. Maximum Special Attack enables Suicune to hold its own offensively once Tailwind is set up; the remaining EVs are placed in HP to increase Suicune's survivability.</p> <p>Terrakion and Tyranitar make good teammates, as they deal heavy damage to Zapdos and most other Electric-types that threaten to 2HKO Suicune. Abomasnow can cancel opposing weather by summoning hail via Snow Warning, and can dispatch Thundurus and Zapdos with a STAB Blizzard.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Suicune's superb bulk and excellent defensive typing makes it one of the few viable Pokemon in VGC 2012 that can use a ChestoRest set. It is also one of the better Calm Mind users because of its good bulk, decent Speed and Special Attack stats, and great offensive STAB. This set aims to set up a few Calm Mind boosts, support the team by utilizing Icy Wind, and using Rest to recover any damage taken. The choice of Water-type STAB is, again, a personal preference. Scald grants consistent damage and a decent chance to burn the opponent, but Hydro Pump can rip through teams after Suicune gets enough Calm Mind boosts. Only a critical hit can bring Suicune down if it has the opportunity to set up.</p> <p>The EV spread given allows Suicune to outpace 252+ Thundurus after an Icy Wind, while also maximizing its massive bulk. Sleep Talk can be used over Icy Wind to let Suicune continue attacking while asleep, but Rest + Chesto Berry is usually sufficient. In addition, note that mono-attacking Suicune is vulnerable to Storm Drain and Water Absorb users, so a Grass-type Pokemon such as Ludicolo or Amoonguss works well in checking these Pokemon. Finally, Pressure helps Suicune by stalling out low PP moves, such as Draco Meteor.</p> <p>Hitmontop is an excellent partner, as Intimidate and Fake Out help Suicune set up Calm Minds. A Rage Powder or Follow Me partner is also very viable because it gives Suicune more turns to set up as well. With Zapdos and Thundurus being extremely common, Pokemon such as Abomasnow and Tyranitar also make great partners, as they can dispatch these threats. Pokemon such as Garchomp and Rotom who can outpace most Pokemon after an Icy Wind from Suicune can opt to go with bulkier spreads, as Icy Wind reduces the need for them to invest as much in Speed. Finally, Pokemon with Psych Up can take advantage of all the Calm Mind boosts Suicune accumulates, letting them hit extremely hard in addition to making them ridiculously bulky.</p>"
      },
      "Crowncune": {
        "description": "<p>At first glance, this looks like a gimmicky set; however, it is really effective when played correctly. The tremendous bulk of this set complements Suicune's excellent defensive typing, making it one of the few viable users of OHKO moves. With Rest and Sleep Talk, Suicune becomes incredibly hard to take down, as it has enough bulk to shrug off damage, in addition to plenty of chances to get lucky with Sheer Cold. Pokemon Suicune cannot normally deal with, such as Ludicolo, Ferrothorn, and Chansey, now have a 30% chance to be OHKOed. Scald rounds off the set, dealing consistent damage and possessing a good burn chance.</p> <p>The EV spread gives good overall bulk; specifically, Suicune only takes about 40% from a Jolly Terrakion's Close Combat, and has a chance to survive the 2HKO from 252+ Zapdos's Discharge after Leftovers.</p> <p>As with the previous set, Terrakion and Tyranitar make good teammates, as they can deal heavy damage to Zapdos and Thundurus, both of whom threaten to 2HKO Suicune.</p> <p>It should be noted that Sheer Cold Suicune is an event from the fourth generation games, and it is therefore hard to obtain one with flawless IVs. For this reason, Icy Wind or Ice Beam is a decent alternative, as it retains coverage against Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon.</p>"

  "Flygon": {
    "overview": "<p>You might be wondering why anyone in their right mind would use Flygon in a metagame where Garchomp, Latios, Latias, and Salamence roam freely. With the exact same typing as Garchomp, it would make even more sense that Flygon should never be used. However, being the only Dragon-type that resists common spread moves such as Earthquake, Rock Slide, Discharge, and Heat Wave gives it a niche among the other Dragon-types. Although Flygon is still somewhat doomed to inferiority, it is usable thanks to its decent base stats and unique moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flygon also has access to Feint, which can break through the opposing Pokemon's Protect and mess up your opponent's strategy. This requires some prediction and timing to pull off though, which can be risky, especially with Flygon. Outrage can be used instead of Dragon Claw, but because it hits a random opponent, it isn't always efficient. Flygon can be given a Choice Scarf and run a more offensive set, but it doesn't hit hard enough for this to be a great option either.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Almost any Ice-type can destroy Flygon decently. Weavile and Mamoswine both hit hard with their STAB Ice-type moves which are often boosted by Ice Gem, making them extremely dangerous, even when Flygon packs Yache Berry. Abomasnow also hits very hard with Blizzard and does not take much damage from any of Flygon's attacks. Flygon's frailty also makes it prone to being worn down by other attacks, including the common Surf, and even moves it resists.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tailwind Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set is what gives Flygon a bit of originality. Dragon Claw and Earthquake as Flygon's two main STAB moves might leave much to be desired when Garchomp is an option in the tier with its much higher Attack, but Flygon can still make great use of them, hitting a wide range of threats pretty hard. However, Tailwind really gives Flygon an edge over Garchomp. With its base 100 Speed, Flygon is able to outspeed some of the most common threats and set up Tailwind to support its teammates. Unfortunately, its general frailty with base 80 HP and average defenses leaves Flygon easy to wear down. Protect is used to avoid damage for a turn, and can be used to scout for potentially dangerous moves.</p> <p>Don't get your hopes up though; Flygon is, unfortunately, sorely outclassed in almost everything it does. There are various superior Dragon-type Pokemon in the tier: Salamence also has access to Tailwind, and has better offensive stats to complement it. Garchomp hits harder and faster with the STAB moves it shares with Flygon, and is also much bulkier to tank more hits. If Garchomp and Salamence had a really unfortunate lovechild, it would be Flygon. With no new toys to play with this generation, Flygon really has gotten the short end of the stick when compared to other physical Dragon-types.</p> <p>Flygon isn't all that bad though, as it does benefit from receiving some of the best features of both dominating physical Dragon-types. Levitate is really a blessing for Flygon, as it gives a niche for being immune to Earthquake, something Garchomp lacks. Additionally, it gains the edge over Salamence by resisting Discharge and Rock Slide.</p> <p>Base 100 Attack isn't something to overlook either. Although it seems like it would be hitting everything for lots of damage, its attacking power falls short of OHKOs, even against common threats. With the reduction in power from spread moves hitting two or more Pokemon, Flygon's Earthquake is weakened even more to the point where most Pokemon can shrug it off with ease and hit back hard.</p> <ul> <li>Earthquake vs. 252/0 Ninetales 74.4% - 90%</li> <li>Dragon Claw vs. 4/0 Latios 88.5% - 105.1%</li> <li>Earthquake vs. 252/0 Metagross 46% - 55.6%</li> </ul> <p>Because of the lack of heavy hitting, Flygon appreciates teammates that can hit much harder than it. Flygon's Tailwinds aid many hard hitting Pokemon, so all Flygon really has to do is finish the job by picking off the remains after its partners have razed the opposition. Flygon also enjoys Helping Hand support, which boosts its damage output to an acceptable level.</p>"

  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnezone certainly has the stats of a top contender, the highlight of which is its massive Special Attack stat which caps out at a whopping 200. Its Steel / Electric typing makes it mortally weak to Earthquake and to a lesser extent Heat Wave, though Sturdy somewhat makes up for this. In light of this, you might ask yourself why Magnezone isn't used that often. The answer is simple: its movepool is woefully shallow. In fact, the extent of its coverage is its STAB and choice of Hidden Power, making Magnezone horribly predictable. It also faces competition from Eelektross, for a slow Electric-type due to the eel's expansive movepool and a complete lack of weaknesses. However, Magnezone has the sheer power and bulk to make up for this, and is able to fulfill a very interesting niche as a reliable Gravity user.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magnezone's movepool is comparable to a desert wasteland beyond the main options, but never fear, desert-dwellers! There are a few oases in Magnezone's movepool. Mirror Coat combined with Sturdy makes for a potent combination, but requires acute prediction and the right situation to be useful. Metal Sound is viable since switching is ill-advised most of the time, though the 85% accuracy really hurts its viability. Tri-Attack and Flash Cannon are basically the only other special moves Magnezone has, but they have decent neutral coverage. Flash Cannon still hits Ice- and Rock-types harder than Magnezone's other moves, most notably Abomasnow and Tyranitar. Magnezone can also set up Rain Dance, though it is outclassed by Politoed or Kingdra in doing so. Zap Cannon is best used in tandem with Gravity, a horseshoe and a four leaved clover because of its shaky accuracy even in Gravity, though the guaranteed paralysis is enough to consider it. Due to Sturdy, Magnezone can viably use multiple items such as Red Card and Leftovers. Red Card ejects Earthquake users as well as anything else that attacks Magnezone, and Leftovers protects the integrity of Sturdy from weak hits such as Fake Out and Rock Slide. If you're afraid of getting walled by Ferrothorn or Shedinja, Hidden Power Fire beats them both handily, though doesn't cover much besides them. Discharge, while not as effective as Zapdos's or Eelektross's Discharge because of their Ground immunities, can still prove effective as Magnezone's only spread move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>If you want to counter Magnezone, simply look over your team and see if you have a Ground-type. If you don't have a Ground-type, simply equip one of your Pokemon with Earthquake. Magnezone can live through at least one Earthquake, however, so make sure you can handle a powerful Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Ice should Sturdy activate. Mamoswine is a fine example of a strong, Earthquake-wielding Ground-type, that can also hit through Sturdy if a hailstorm is in effect, courtesy of its comrade Abomasnow. Pokemon with Mold Breaker, such as Haxorus, can use Earthquake without fear of Sturdy thanks to its effect. Faster Fire-types can roast Magnezone alive, though again, Sturdy allows Magnezone to live through one Flamethrower, provided it does not get burned. Infernape is able to use Fake Out to \"break\" Sturdy and proceed to melt Magnezone with its choice of STAB Fire move or Close Combat. Under the effects of Trick Room, Magnezone becomes a little more troublesome. Hitmontop has a respectable Special Defense stat, as well as Mach Punch, though it won't enjoy too many Thunderbolts. Slower Earthquake users come in handy here, though if you don't have a slow Earthquake user, you'll either have to try to stall out Trick Room or hope Magnezone doesn't KO your Earthquake user before you can use Earthquake.</p> <p>Outside of its obvious weaknesses, Shedinja and Ferrothorn make excellent Magnezone checks, provided Magnezone isn't using Hidden Power Fire. Shedinja walls each and every common Magnezone attack thanks to Wonder Guard, and actually appreciates Thunder Wave since it cannot be put to sleep or poisoned while it's paralyzed. Ferrothorn can get hit by Magnezone's attacks, even though they'll be fairly weak. However, Ferrothorn can't do much to Magnezone in return, outside of Leech Seed or the uncommon Bulldoze.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Tank": {
        "description": "<p>Since offensive coverage isn't Magnezone's strong suit, a slightly supportive set comes naturally to it. Magnezone is a reliable paralysis spreader with Thunder Wave, and is just fast enough to make good use of it itself. If you're not using Thunder Wave, Signal Beam is a suitable replacement, as it hits Psychic- and Grass-types harder than Magnezone's other moves. Thunderbolt is Magnezone's go-to Electric-type move, though with proper teammates, Discharge and Thunder are viable as well. Hidden Power Ice has good coverage with Magnezone's Electric-type STAB, and Hidden Power Ground hits Fire-types and opposing Electric-types. Protect is a given for the last slot, especially when using an Earthquake user alongside Magnezone. Item-wise, Electric Gem provides the necessary power for Thunderbolt to OHKO specially defensive Togekiss, whereas Sitrus Berry heals Magnezone enough to let it take a few more neutral hits.</p> <p>Magnezone has a few more notable options for items and moves. Light Screen and Reflect are great support moves to use in the third slot, though they aren't as effective together because of the loss of Protect or Hidden Power that is caused in order to make room for dual screens. Magnezone is a reliable user of Gravity due to Sturdy, and can make use of its own Gravity by using Thunder. Air Balloon is an option if you're not using Gravity, though it announces itself and gives your opponent more incentive to break Magnezone's Sturdy. Magnezone can also function admirably under Trick Room, provided it has a Quiet nature and isn't using Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Reuniclus enjoys an accurate Focus Blast to take on Tyranitar and other Dark-types, provided Magnezone is using Gravity, and can set up Trick Room for Magnezone. Magnezone also appreciates Slowbro as a Trick Room using partner, since it is able to use Ice Beam or its choice of Water-type STAB moves to beat Fire- and Ground-types. Grass-types are also good partners for Magnezone because of Magnezone's inability to severely damage Gastrodon, Swampert or Rhyperior. Amoonguss is a fine example, as it is able to abuse the lack of Sleep Clause and can draw away Fighting-type moves, though it shares a Fire-type weakness with Magnezone. Ludicolo has no trouble beating down Magnezone checks with its superb Grass- and Water-type STAB combination, and if you're using Magnezone in rain, you have the option of using a Thunder that never misses. Ironically, while being Magnezone's greatest enemies, Garchomp and Mamoswine can make good partners for it too. They both enjoy paralysis and Gravity support, and in Mamoswine's case, can smack Ground-types with a STAB Icicle Crash. Be wary about using Earthquake around Magnezone however; a Protect and Earthquake combination can be easy to predict. Latios is also a good partner, as it can destroy the likes of Hitmontop, and is generally faster than Garchomp.</p>"

  "Glaceon": {
    "overview": "<p>Glaceon has always been an underrated Pokemon, mainly because of its poor HP, average Speed, and predictable movepool. However, with manageable defensive stats and a superb 130 Special Attack Stat, Glaceon is a force to be reckoned with. Even its ability, Snow Cloak, makes it difficult to hit Glaceon. When utilized properly, Glaceon can plow through unprepared teams. The raw power of Blizzard is incredible, especially in a metagame where some of the most common Pokemon are weak to Ice. Overall, Glaceon is an excellent addition to any VGC team that abuses Hail.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Although Glaceon has incredible power, it is very straightforward and predictable because of its limited movepool; however, when used correctly, it can easily destroy teams that do not have a counter. Ice Beam can be considered if you want a STAB attack when hail is not up. Although Glaceon is not a physical attacker, Ice Shard can be used to finish off weakened Pokemon. If your team is Tyranitar weak, Hidden Power Fighting may be considered for a 2HKO. Ice Body, Glaceon's Dream World ability, is an alternative for those who prefer healing, though Snow Cloak is superior in most cases, as Glaceon prefers the evasion boost. Focus Sash and Ice Gem are other items that can be used. Focus Sash allows Glaceon to survive a super effective attack, such as Overheat, and Ice Gem allows Glaceon to fire off one very destructive Blizzard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Generally, Fire-types, such as Chandelure and Infernape, cause problems for Glaceon. Steel-types that resist Blizzard, such as Metagross, Heatran, and Scizor are also a nuisance. Tyranitar, Politoed, and Ninetales can all change the weather and reduce Blizzard's accuracy, making Glaceon much less effective. Hitmontop can smack Glaceon with its STAB moves, and support its teammates with Wide Guard, which shuts down Blizzard for a turn.</p>",

      "Trick Room Hail": {
        "description": "<p>Unfortunately, Glaceon suffers from having a limited movepool; however, it can cause massive damage with the moves it does have. Blizzard is Glaceon's main move; with such raw power, it can easily take out common Pokemon such as Garchomp, Zapdos, Latios, Tornadus, and Thundurus. However, many other Pokemon resist Glaceon's Blizzard, such as Chandelure, Metagross, and Scizor. The rest of Glaceon's movepool is to target these specific Pokemon. Shadow Ball is used to hit Ghost types that resist Blizzard, such as Chandelure and Jellicent. Fake Tears and Hidden Power Ground should be considered, depending on the rest of your team. Fake Tears may seem like a poor suggestion, but in a 1 vs 1 stall war against Pokemon such as Cresselia and Suicune—who can constantly heal damage by using Rest, it gives a significant advantage. It can also be used to get some surprise KOs with its partner; lower an opponent's Special Defense with Fake Tears, and OHKO it with a strong special attack. Hidden Power Ground is an alternative in order to gain more coverage—with Hidden Power Ground, Glaceon can hit Pokemon that otherwise wall it, such as Heatran and Metagross. Protect is a given on Glaceon in order for it to survive as long as possible.</p> <p>Glaceon runs max HP and 248 Special Attack EVs to give it both stability and strength. Should Glaceon run Hidden Power Ground, 248 and 252 Special Attack EVs serve the same purpose, so the remaining EVs can be placed into Special Defense. Glaceon's bulk allows it to take Heat Wave and Rock Slide and has enough firepower to KO Pokemon back. For example, Adamant 4/0 Garchomp with Yache Berry is always OHKOed by Blizzard after hail damage. Iron Ball is used in order to outspeed Pokemon under Trick Room that would normally be slower than Glaceon. Snow Cloak makes it much harder for moves with 90 accuracy to hit, and helps Glaceon survive longer.</p> <p>In order to spam Blizzard, it must be used in hail for maximum effect, due to its otherwise-shaky accuracy. Therefore, it is best paired with Abomasnow who can easily set up hail. However, you must be wary as both Glaceon and Abomasnow share weaknesses to Fire-, Rock-, and Fighting-type attacks. In order to utilize Glaceon, it must be sent out when you have the weather under control. Should your opponent have a weather-changing Pokemon, such as Politoed, Tyranitar, or Ninetales, you must prioritize to KO them first. Glaceon also wants to be put on a team that can easily set up Trick Room for it to sweep. Bulky Pokemon that can easily set up Trick Room include Jellicent, Reuniclus, and Cofagrigus. Be sure to utilize the 4 turns of Trick Room efficiently, because Glaceon cannot survive more than 2 or 3 attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Similar to the Trick Room set, Glaceon aims to spam Blizzard to maximize its damage output. Utilizing a Choice Scarf, Glaceon can outrun more threats, such as Garchomp and Zapdos, and its mediocre Speed isn't such a problem. Its other moves are very situational, and should only be used if Blizzard runs out of PP, or a specific threat needs to be removed. Shadow Ball is used to help against any Ghost-types, Hidden Power Ground has the ability to hit Steel-types that otherwise wall Glaceon, and Signal Beam can be used against Ludicolo.</p> <p>Maximum Speed and 248 Special Attack EVs ensure Glaceon is as fast as possible, while dishing out a heap of damage. Because it runs Hidden Power Ground, there is no difference between 248 and 252 Special Attack EVs. The remaining EVs can be placed into HP, giving it an extra point. Blizzard is the only move it should be using, but the other moves might come in handy in specific situations.</p> <p>Glaceon works very well alongside Infernape and Terrakion—Infernape can take out Pokemon that are resistant to Blizzard, and it can deal with Pokemon that give hail teams trouble, such as Tyranitar. Infernape and Glaceon also provide incredible coverage, and Infernape easily KOes Pokemon that give Glaceon trouble, such as Scizor, Tyranitar, and Heatran. Along with Fake Out support, it allows Glaceon to dish out constant Blizzard, while protecting it from dangerous attacks. Terrakion plays a similar role to Infernape; with a higher Attack stat, it can hit Rock- and Fire-types, such as Chandelure, Volcarona, and Tyranitar.</p>"

  "Gallade": {
    "overview": "<p>Gallade is often overlooked because of its base 80 Speed and mediocre physical Defense, which would at first glance make it seem insufficient to take on many relevant threats. In practice, however, it's quite the opposite. Its ability to take on Trick Room teams or abuse the twisted dimensions is valuable to any team in a metagame where Trick Room lurks in every corner, as is its vast offensive movepool which contains great STABs and coverage. The good news doesn't stop there; it receives a myriad of supportive moves such as Helping Hand, Thunder Wave, and the rare Heal Pulse. Its great base 115 Special Defense also allows it to take powerful attacks such as STAB Thunders, Heat Waves, and Blizzards, and thanks to its menacing base 125 Attack, it is able to dish out major hurt. Overall, if you need a Pokemon to glue together your Trick Room-weak team, or need a supporter but can't seem to fit one in, Gallade is your knight in shining armor.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gallade has quite a few options, both offensive and defensive. It can use Trick Room and Imprison with a neutral Speed nature to counter Trick Room teams, though it takes up two moveslots; simply reversing Trick Room is the best anti-Trick Room strategy to use with Gallade anyway. Gallade receives both Light Screen and Reflect, but using them in tandem with each other isn't as efficient as picking one or the other. Encore can punish opponents that try to stall out Trick Room with Protect or Substitute, though that's really all it can be used for. Being an expert swordsman, Gallade naturally receives Night Slash and Leaf Blade, which can be helpful against the always troubling Psychic- and Ghost-types, and rain teams, respectively. Feint breaks Protects, allowing you to gang up on a troublesome threat, but is hard to fit in Gallade's moveslots. Hypnosis would be a good move to cripple slower (or faster, in Trick Room's case) Pokemon if it didn't have horrible accuracy. Gallade is also able to use the elemental punches, Ice Punch in particular. Ice Punch really only hits Dragon-types though, most of which usually carry Yache Berries. If you're concerned about physical moves, such as Acrobatics, OHKOing your Gallade, or you just want to use Close Combat more freely, Focus Sash is an option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Acrobatics users such as Crobat, Tornadus, and Gliscor have no problem going up against any Gallade, as they outspeed and KO it before Gallade can respond. Dusclops and Cresselia can ignore Gallade completely, as they don't care about paralysis or Trick Room, though both dislike getting burned. Gyarados and Salamence take meager amounts of damage after Intimidate and hit Gallade's weaker defensive stat, though Salamence has to watch out for Ice Punch. Without a super effective attack or Thunder Wave, faster variants of Togekiss and Yanmega can Air Slash Gallade to kingdom come. Metagross can take most of Gallade's attacks without breaking a sweat and Meteor Mash or Iron Head Gallade into submission. If Gallade relies on only its STAB moves for coverage, Sableye completely walls Gallade and can burn it to prevent major damage to Sableye's teammates.</p>",

Investment in HP ensures Gallade isn't taken out easily from attacks such as Rotom-W's rain-boosted Hydro Pump, Abomasnow's Blizzard, and Latios's Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor. Close Combat is a powerful move, but if you really want Gallade to live through more powerful attacks, Drain Punch is a safer option. Zen Headbutt is another reliable STAB move, and comes with a nice chance of flinching. The third slot is reserved for the myriad of supportive options Gallade is blessed with. Heal Pulse is great when your partner is bulky, but should be used with discretion when your opponent is using a Follow Me Pokemon. Helping Hand is just generally a great doubles move, powering up moves that would otherwise deal less than desirable damage. Thunder Wave can also benefit Gallade, patching up its lackluster Speed stat and forming a slightly weaker version of the infamous ParaFlinch combination when used in combination with Zen Headbutt. There are many options for the last slot; Protect is good for scouting random Shadow Balls and priority moves, whereas Shadow Sneak is useful for breaking Focus Sashes and finishing off survivors of more powerful assaults such as Close Combat.</p> <p>The third slot's options can spill over into the fourth slot if you need more support, and Gallade can accomplish a lot with them. Be careful about using Gallade without Protect or a priority move, however; once your opponent discovers Gallade can't Protect itself, they will gang up and attack it without hesitation. Because Gallade can't do much to stop bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types, Hydreigon is an excellent partner. Hydreigon especially enjoys Gallade's paralysis support, which makes its only decent Speed stat less of an issue. Pokemon that have the ability Intimidate make fine partners, as they help patch up Gallade's awful Defense. Arcanine and Salamence love Thunder Wave support, and the former particularly enjoys its ExtremeSpeeds being powered up by Helping Hand. Both Salamence and Arcanine appreciate the protection against Tyranitar that Gallade provides, and can weaken Earthquakes from Tyranitar's common partners. Zapdos also enjoys the absence of Tyranitar, and can make opposing Dragon-types freeze in their tracks with Hidden Power Ice; it can also OHKO Acrobatics users such as Crobat. Fast Rock Slide users such as Terrakion and Aerodactyl help fend off Flying-types, and in Aerodactyl's case, remove the effects of Lum and Chople Berries, as well as supporting Gallade with Tailwind. Finally, if one is extremely fearful of Zen Headbutt's accuracy, Psycho Cut can be used instead, but it loses some power and the flinch chance.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Unlike most Trick Room users, Gallade can hit from the physical side and make use of its own Trick Room to abuse its great dual STABs. Close Combat, a 120 Base Power STAB move, should be a self-explanatory choice. Psycho Cut makes mincemeat out of the common Fighting-type Fake Out users, while Shadow Sneak can break Focus Sash and finish weakened Pokemon outside of Trick Room. The fourth move largely depends on Gallade's teammate. If you're using a Follow Me user that can't heal itself efficiently, such as Amoonguss, Heal Pulse is a great way to keep your teammate healthy and ready to spam Spore or similar moves. Protect does as advertised, protecting Gallade from Fake Out and attacks that would otherwise KO it.</p> <p>Unlike other variants of Gallade, Trick Room Gallade can afford to drop the fourth slot's options in order to gain more coverage, so a moveset such as Trick Room / Close Combat / Psycho Cut / Shadow Sneak is perfectly viable. If you don't fear Fake Out or similar flinch-inducing moves, Steadfast becomes an option, if only for 4th gen moves such as Zen Headbutt and Drain Punch, asthey are illegal with Justified. Keep in mind Steadfast can raise Gallade's Speed, which can work against it in Trick Room.</p> <p>Gallade is a rare case; pairing it with conventional Fake Out users such as Hitmontop and Hariyama is ill-advised due to overlapping weaknesses. Sableye is probably the best Fake Out user to pair with Gallade typing-wise, and can use Taunt and Will-O-Wisp to prevent Trick Room being reversed and to burn physical attackers, respectively. Togekiss and Coba Berry Amoonguss make great partners for Gallade, keeping it safe from gang attacks and annoying the opponent under Trick Room with Air Slash and Spore, respectively. Tyranitar makes a good partner for KOing Psychic- and Ghost-types, and has the option of Unnerve if you don't want Sand Stream. Beyond these Pokemon, regular Trick Room Pokemon such as Scizor, Gigalith, and slower variants of Dragonite are good partners to take advantage of Gallade's Trick Room.</p>"

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>With the re-emergence of the rest of the 491 Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame, Heatran looks to establish itself as the premier Fire-type Pokemon. Unfortunately, with the omnipresence of Fighting-, Water-, and Ground-type attacks, along with Heatran's low Speed stat, it is easily knocked around like a pinball in a pinball machine. This problem is made worse with an increase in hyper offensive playstyles, coupled with hard-hitting attacks present in the metagame. However, Heatran's tendency to get slapped around doesn't take away from the fact that it possesses two of the best Fire-type attacks in this metagame; Heat Wave and Eruption. It has a phenomenal Special Attack stat that will punch through anything, given the right opportunity. If you're willing to gamble on this glass cannon, it will yield huge dividends.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With its slow Speed stat, Heatran greatly appreciates Tailwind support, which Latios, Zapdos, and other such Pokemon can provide. However Heatran can also boost its own speed with a Choice Scarf and Modest nature, letting it outspeed a majority of the unboosted common VGC threats. On the other side of the spectrum, if using Trick Room, it is recommended that you use a 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD spread on Heatran, a Speed hindering nature, and 2 Speed IVs (in order to achieve a 70 Base Power Hidden Power). Fire Gem can also work well, giving Heatran a much stronger Fire-type Attack for one turn. Air Balloon can be used to give Heatran immunity to Ground-type attacks; be warned, however, that it should only be used if you are planning to lead with Heatran, as switching it in on an off-chance attack will ruin Heatran's advantage.</p> <p>As for alternative move choices, Dragon Pulse can be a much more effective option to hit Dragon-types over Hidden Power Ice. Heatran can also opt to run Will-O-Wisp to burn the Fighting-types that will inevitably switch into it. Substitute may be a nice option, especially when your opponents will undoubtedly be using Protect against Heatran's super effective attacks, giving Heatran plenty of opportunities to set up. Overheat can work as an alternative over Heat Wave and Eruption, hitting one opponent for massive amounts of damage. Since switching is very difficult in this metagame, Overheat will debilitate Heatran afterwards, lowering its Special Attack stat by two stages. Finally, Explosion can be used as a surprise, dealing final blows to its enemies, while Heatran sacrifices itself.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Since Fighting-types are a staple on most VGC teams, it’s not very hard to counter Heatran. Hitmontop can employ either Mach Punch or Close Combat to quickly dispose of Heatran, and so can most other Fighting-types. Tyranitar also walls most of Heatran's attacks, with the exception of Hidden Power Ice and Earth Power. However, as sandstorm boosts Tyranitar's Special Defense, it usually does not take as much damage from Heatran as one would expect, and it can KO back with a Low Kick or Earthquake. Rain teams also wall Heatran, with the rain neutralizing Heatran’s STAB Fire-type attacks. One must beware of the rare Explosion, however, as it can still deal severe damage to any rain team. Yache Berry Garchomp can survive a Hidden Power Ice and fire back an Earthquake to dispose of Heatran quickly. Finally, Gyarados is probably the supreme Heatran counter, only needing to watch out for the rare Will-O-Wisp, while taking little to no damage from Heatran’s attacks. It even has the added advantage of nerfing Heatran’s Explosion through Intimidate.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With Heatran's sky-high Special Attack, Heat Wave and Eruption have the potential to knock out both opponents in one shot, or at least deal massive damage to those who don't resist, or aren't immune to Fire-type attacks. Heat Wave is a safer bet; with Heatran's tendency to get hit for massive damage, Heat Wave will consistently hit opponents for significant damage. However, Eruption is the high-risk, high-reward option, which allows Heatran to engulf its opponents in flames straight from hell. One must note, though, that Eruption will get steadily weaker as Heatran’s HP drops. Earth Power gives Heatran an option to hit opposing Fire- and Rock-types, who would otherwise take little damage from Heat Wave and even Eruption. Hidden Power Ice allows Heatran to hit opposing Dragon-types who resist Fire super effectively, whereas Protect allows Heatran to defend itself from incoming super effective attacks.</p> <p>Shuca Berry is used to partially neutralize Ground-type attacks aimed at Heatran; however, as Heatran possesses a 4x weakness to Ground-type attacks, there is still the possibility that it will be KOed. Chople Berry can also be used to neutralize powerful Fighting-type attacks that are popular in this metagame. 252 Special Attack EVs ensure Heatran hits its opponents as hard as possible, while 252 Speed EVs allow Heatran to be as fast as possible. The 4 leftover EVs are then placed into HP to give Heatran a little bit of extra bulk. On the note of natures, if using Eruption, Heatran must run a Quiet nature; otherwise, Heatran is free to run whatever nature it wants. A Modest nature is recommended though to further boost Heatran's Special Attack.</p> <p>Heatran greatly appreciates Helping Hand support in conjunction with Heat Wave and Eruption. Cresselia, Dusclops, and Dusknoir can all provide Helping Hand, allowing Heatran to achieve KOs with its spread moves, when it otherwise could not. Furthermore, all three of these Pokemon can also use Trick Room, allowing Heatran to either run a set with the lowest Speed stat as possible, or still operate under regular conditions by negating opposing Trick Room. Psychic-type attacks are well appreciated with the plethora of Fighting-types that lurk in every corner of VGC 2012. With the popularity of rain teams, Zapdos, as well as other Electric- and Grass-types, will be appreciated. Ninetales can also help get rid of rain and put into place more friendly conditions that Heatran can take advantage of. Finally, Sableye may seem like an odd choice, but it has access to priority Will-O-Wisp that boosts Heatran’s Fire-type attacks, courtesy of Flash Fire, as well as Fake Out, that lends Heatran a free turn to do whatever it wants.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Possessing great attacking stats and an excellent ability in Chlorophyll, Shiftry is built for high-octane offense. Two great STABs in Dark and Grass further aid its ability to hit hard and deal damage. Unfortunately, Shiftry is weak to two very common spread moves: Blizzard and Heat Wave, the latter boosted by the very condition that supports Shiftry! Despite this, Shiftry still deserves to be put on a sun team, and with the right support, it can be deadly indeed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tailwind is an option to double Shiftry's and its team's Speed for 4 turns, allowing it to provide some support of its own. However, Shiftry's frail defenses and the presence of Pokemon with Prankster such as Whimsicott and Tornadus make Tailwind a gimmicky option. Low Kick could be used on the physical set, hitting such Pokemon as Scrafty and Metagross for more damage than its other moves; however, the additional coverage is not great enough to warrant use in most situations. Shiftry has Nasty Plot, Swords Dance, and Growth, which one may be attracted to. However, given the fast-paced nature of double battles, Shiftry would rather attack than waste time boosting. Shiftry gets several other physical moves such as Rock Slide and X-Scissor. However, they offer no additional benefit over Shiftry's main STAB moves. If the Special Attack drop of Leaf Storm is unattractive, Giga Drain and SolarBeam are alternate options, though Giga Drain is rather weak and SolarBeam is too unreliable in doubles without sun being active.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Zapdos takes little from Shiftry's assaults and hits back hard with a super effective Heat Wave. Most other Flying-types are able to counter Shiftry by taking its attacks and damaging Shiftry in return with their STAB Flying-type moves. Fire-types such as Chandelure and Ninetales can hit Shiftry hard with a STAB Heat Wave, although the former must be wary of Sucker Punch. Hitmontop, Machamp, and other Fighting-types threaten with their super effective STAB Fighting-type moves. Abomasnow changes the weather to hail, slowing Shiftry down and making Abomasnow's super effective Blizzard have 100% accuracy, taking Shiftry out of the game.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Fake Out is a great move for disrupting the opponent, forcing them to Protect or get flinched, wasting a turn either way. The few Pokemon that outspeed Shiftry are hit hard by its priority STAB Sucker Punch. Sucker Punch is one of the best STAB priority moves in the metagame, hitting the common Ghost- and Psychic-types for super effective damage. Seed Bomb is Shiftry's secondary STAB, landing a super effective hit on some Pokemon that resist Sucker Punch, such as Terrakion, and gives Shiftry a reliable backup attack if the opponent chooses not to attack. The last slot is somewhat controversial. Many insist that with Explosion's recent nerf, it is no longer a viable option. However, Explosion is a fantastic move for clearing the field when Shiftry is low on HP, or, should Shiftry be dead weight in a battle, get some last-ditch damage off on the opposing team. However, unless Shiftry's partner is a Ghost-type or uses Protect, Explosion is extremely risky. Protect is a great move for any Pokemon in VGC metagames, and the best choice if Explosion is unappealing.</p> <p>Shiftry can make great use of Life Orb, which boosts its damage output and allows it to get important OHKOs, such as on 4 HP Terrakion with Seed Bomb. Unfortunately, a Life Orb is better used by a teammate, in which case a Focus Sash can be used to keep Shiftry alive for an additional turn. Chlorophyll doubles Shiftry's Speed in sun, allowing it to outspeed nearly every Pokemon in the metagame. Because of this, Shiftry may use an Adamant nature without fear of being outsped. Shiftry needs all the Attack and Speed it can get, and the EV spread reflects that.</p> <p>Sun support is critical to Shiftry, and Ninetales is the perfect Pokemon to provide it. Ninetales's ability, Drought, brings permanent sun to the field and doubles Shiftry's Speed, making for a great teammate. Due to Shiftry's trouble with spread moves, Hitmontop is an excellent partner, providing Wide Guard support and Intimidating physical attackers attempting to hit Shiftry hard.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>In addition to a great physical set, Shiftry can run an excellent specially-oriented set. Once again, the usefulness of Fake Out must be emphasized for disrupting the opponent and giving Shiftry's teammate a chance to attack. Leaf Storm is a powerful Grass-type STAB move, and with a sky-high 140 Base Power it wrecks anything that doesn't resist it. Unfortunately, Leaf Storm cuts Shiftry's Special Attack in half when it is used, so it should only be used if absolutely necessary. Dark Pulse covers Shiftry's other STAB, and gives it a chance to flinch the opponent, too. With Protect, Shiftry can shield itself from all assaults while its partner deals with a problem Pokemon, or uses a multi-hit move such as Earthquake. Shiftry can utilize Substitute to good effect, giving it a facade to take hits and stay relatively safe, firing off shots of its own. If Substitute is used, however, a Life Orb is the appropriate item choice, because Substitute negates Focus Sash's effect.</p> <p>In sun, Shiftry has almost no fear of being outsped, so a Modest nature is used to boost Shiftry's Special Attack stat. With Shiftry's lackluster defenses, it will not be staying on the field for extended periods of time, so a Life Orb can only help it. If one wishes to preserve Shiftry past the first few turns, however, a Focus Sash is a suitable alternative. Chlorophyll and 252 Speed EVs keep Shiftry going as fast as it can in sun, and 252 Special Attack EVs help it hit as hard as possible.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ice grants coverage on Dragon- and Flying-types, to which Shiftry often struggles to damage. However, Dark Pulse deals with both Latias and Latios anyway, so the additional coverage is not vital. Likewise, Hidden Power Fire helps Shiftry damage Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, but on a sun team, Shiftry is often partnered with Fire-types such as Ninetales and Charizard, so using this move is generally unnecessary.</p> <p>As before, Shiftry greatly appreciates sun support, which Ninetales is more than happy to provide. Psychic-types such as Latios work well alongside Shiftry to take on the Fighting-type Pokemon that threaten Shiftry. Again, Hitmontop provides Shiftry with Intimidate and Wide Guard support, potentially changing the course of a match by allowing Shiftry time to attack.</p>"

With her incredible bulk, Cresselia is able to take large amounts of damage with relative ease, making her a reliable user of Trick Room. With a vast movepool to complement her bulk, Cresselia becomes an amazing supporter supplying things such as dual screens, Helping Hand, and ways to lower the opponent's Speed. When it comes to the attractive combination of support versatility and high bulk, few Pokemon stand out as much as Cresselia.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cresselia is one of the few Pokemon that can use a Calm Mind set in VGC. However, flinches or full paralyses can be annoying if you're trying to set up. A Bold nature can be used in tandem with an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD to wall physical threats better. Psycho Shift and Toxic or Flame Orb combination is cool to try to spread around status ailments and stop physical attackers. Moonlight can be used for recovery, but with weather changing so much in this metagame, the amount recovered will vary. Lunar Dance can be used to sacrifice a weakened Cresselia to heal a weakened teammate to full health. Magic Coat can bounce back status moves that can be troublesome to your team. With a Choice item, Cresselia can utilize Trick to force opponents to use moves such as Protect. Recycle can be used if Cresselia has Sitrus Berry to provide an easy constant form of recovery. Psyshock can be used as an alternative to Psychic to hit Blissey and Chansey harder. Gravity can serve as an option for Cresselia to set up easily. However it has the downside of countering the effects of Levitate.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fake Out and Taunt both hurt Cresselia by preventing it from supporting its teammates, by either flinching it for one turn or disabling its non-attacking moves for three turns. Strong attackers such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Metagross can be troublesome with their appropriate Gems. As far as special attackers go, nothing can OHKO Cresselia without a critical hit. However, opponents such as Chandelure and Volcarona can 2HKO Cresselia with Shadow Ball or Bug Buzz. Imprison users with Trick Room prevent Cresselia from setting up Trick Room. Roar also prevents Cresselia from setting up Trick Room, as it phazes Cresselia out before it can set up.</p>",

Thunder Wave is also another option to regulate Speed but gets no use against Pokemon such as Garchomp or Excadrill, or Pokemon with Lightningrod on the field. Psychic gives Cresselia an attacking option if she gets taunted or needs to quickly KO a weakened Pokemon. Light Screen or Reflect make great choices for helping your team's defensive capabilities. The move you use can depend on what kind of attacks your team is weak to. If you have trouble with moves such as Surf, Discharge, or other special attacks, Light Screen would be the preferred choice; if many of your Pokemon have issues with physical attacks such as Rock Slide or Earthquake, Reflect is the obvious choice. A great supporting move Cresselia can use is Helping Hand, which boosts her partner's attacks, gaining significant KOs. Rest is also an option in tandem with Chesto Berry, helping Cresselia last longer as a supporter in matches.</p> <p>The choice of item depends on what kind of recovery you would prefer. Sitrus Berry is great quick recovery for matches, while Chesto Berry is preferred for use with Rest to keep Cresselia awake. However, it can serve use without Rest by defending Cresselia against sleep inducing moves. Levitate is Cresselia's only ability and provides a Ground-type immunity, meaning partners such as Garchomp can spam Earthquake. A Calm nature can be used to add onto Cresselia's special bulk. The EV spread aims to provide as much special bulk as possible to tank those common spread moves, such as Surf, Discharge, and Blizzard, while cushioning against strong special Ghost-type moves, such as Shadow Ball. An EV spread of 252 HP / 28 SpA / 230 SpD gives Cresselia the ability to 2HKO 252 HP Hitmontop and Hariyama. This spread also works well with Ice Beam to get easy 2HKOs on Thundurus, Tornadus, and Landorus. You can replace Psychic on the set to compensate for the other kind of screen support you chose, giving the classic dual screen coverage to fend off assaults from both attacking stats. Protect also makes a good choice, keeping Cresselia alive longer with prediction. Cresselia can use Trick Room on this set to counter opposing Trick Room users, or to regulate the speed of the game when you know the opposition outspeeds Cresselia's partners.</p> <p>Cresselia, being the great supporter it is, can pair with lots of different Pokemon, especially with hard hitting Pokemon such as Garchomp or Abomasnow who benefit from Helping Hand. Slow bulky Pokemon are excellent partners for Cresselia because of the way she can change the tempo of the game with Trick Room, Icy Wind, or Thunder Wave. Tyranitar and other Dark-types provide trouble for Cresselia while she is supporting her team, so having ways to take these kinds of Pokemon out immensely extends Cresselia's longevity. A Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Hitmontop, Salamence, or Gyarados, is a great partner to weaken physical attacks that would otherwise heavily dent Cresselia.</p>"

      "Trick Room Setter": {
        "description": "<p>In this metagame, Cresselia is no doubt the best Trick Room set-up user. Psychic helps KO worn down Pokemon and provides a nice way to deal out huge damage to the common Fighting-types. Cresselia can also remain as a supporter and maximize her team's offensive potential with Helping Hand, boosting her partner's moves such as Earthquake or Rock Slide. One of the most annoying ways people deal with Trick Room is to put all of the Pokemon to sleep. This creates a better opportunity for them to stall and KO your Pokemon while taking no damage. You can solve this problem with Safeguard. Screens also make a fine choice, as they help Pokemon set up and are usually successful in VGC. The screen to use depends on what support the team needs. If you have trouble with special attacks, Light Screen would be the screen of choice, while Reflect is the obvious choice for defending against physical attacks.</p> <p>Cresselia will be taking a lot of damage in matches, so Sitrus Berry is the item of choice for quick recovery. If you have trouble with Sitrus Berry or Taunt users, Mental Herb is a completely fine option to be able to set Trick Room immediately without being Taunted. Levitate is Cresselia's only ability and provides a Ground-type immunity, meaning partners such as Garchomp can spam Earthquake. A Sassy nature gives more special bulk and might be preferred to take powerful weather boosted moves. A Relaxed nature allows Cresselia to take physical hits better and still have some special bulk from the given EV spread. The EV spread is just an all around build to better tank more hits. As a Trick Room setter, she will commonly find herself being double targeted, necessitating an all-around bulky build to be successful in surviving a lot of the time. Protect can still keep Cresselia alive longer with good prediction.</p> <p>Because this set is dedicated to setting up Trick Room, Pokemon that can effectively utilize Trick Room, such as Rhyperior and Snorlax, are some of the best partners for Cresselia. Fake Out users, such as Scrafty and Hariyama, are wonderful for Cresselia as they can disable a threat for one turn, which is enough for Cresselia to set up Trick Room. These kinds of Pokemon can also give Cresselia safety from Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Bisharp. Strong attackers with Intimidate work well with Cresselia, cushioning her against physical attacks. Sadly, not many Intimidate users are slow enough for optimal Trick Room use.</p>"

The ability to bring eternal sun instantly makes Ninetales a must-have for any team looking to abuse Sunny Day and its effects. Not only that, but Ninetales powers up its own STAB Fire-type moves with the sun it brings, making it a force on its own. That is not to say that Ninetales is without its downsides, though. With weaknesses to common spread moves such as Surf, Rock Slide, and Earthquake, Ninetales must tread carefully or risk being KOed. Still, Ninetales is quite the force to be reckoned with in VGC.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ground gives Ninetales the option to hit one of sun's biggest checks, Heatran, though one must be aware that this renders Ninetales incapable of doing much damage against Dragon-types. Hypnosis may seem attractive at first glance; however, its low accuracy often puts the user at a disadvantage, and Pokemon with more accurate sleep moves such as Spore generally fill this role better. Nasty Plot and Calm Mind are in the same boat, but VGC—and doubles in general—is such a fast-paced metagame that boosting is very hard to pull off, and attacking may lead to a better result. Fire Blast and Overheat may be utilized as an alternative STAB move, though Heat Wave's double-targeting and Flamethrower's accuracy makes them better than such high-risk moves. Psyshock may be looked at to cover Fighting-types, but in the sun, Heat Wave does nearly as much damage anyway, making Psyshock not often worth the moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Chandelure is a near-perfect counter to Ninetales, taking little from its attacks and even boosting its own Fire-type moves by switching in on a Heat Wave. Two common spread moves in the form of Earthquake and Rock Slide bring Ninetales to its knees, making any Pokemon carrying these moves an instant threat. Politoed can bring everlasting rain to the field, nerfing Ninetales's Fire-type moves, and can OHKO Ninetales with a STAB, rain-boosted Water-type move of choice.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Heat Wave provides Ninetales with a very powerful STAB move, being boosted by the sun and having the possibility of hitting both targets at once. However, if the miss rate of Heat Wave is bothersome, Flamethrower is an appropriate choice in order to stay on the offensive without running the risk of a miss at a critical time. With Hidden Power Ice, Ninetales is able to hit Ground- and Dragon-type Pokemon, who might otherwise give it problems, such as Garchomp and Salamence. It must be noted that, unfortunately, even max Special Attack Ninetales's Hidden Power Ice maxes out at 96% damage on 4/0 Garchomp, making priority or spread move support appreciated. Will-O-Wisp destroys common physical attackers such as Hitmontop and Tyranitar, halving their Attack. However, Politoed gives Ninetales fits, as its Dream World ability, Drizzle, brings eternal rain to the field. With this being such a detriment to Ninetales's attacking ability, Energy Ball gives Ninetales a way to hit Water-types such as Politoed for super effective damage, though it's really only good to hit on the switch, as a return Surf or Hydro Pump OHKOes. Protect gives Ninetales a way to stay relatively safe for a turn, while its partner eliminates a threat.</p> <p>Ninetales is weak to many common spread moves; therefore a Focus Sash is an excellent item choice to help Ninetales fire off one last shot. A Focus Sash may not be available to Ninetales, and if so, a Shuca or Charti Berry would be satisfactory to help against Earthquake and Rock Slide users, respectively. Ninetales faces very little opposition at the excellent base 100 Speed tier, and as a result, a Modest nature may be used without fear of being outsped and KOed. With a more offensively oriented set such as this one, EVs are placed in Special Attack and Speed in order to give Ninetales the maximum amount of power.</p> <p>Other weather starters are the bane of Ninetales's existence, making it quite natural to look for Pokemon that can eliminate these threats. Hitmontop does a superb job of taking on these threats. Intimidate and a Fighting-type STAB move of choice stops Tyranitar in its tracks, and Wide Guard stops Politoed and other rain abusers looking to Surf Ninetales away. Conversely, with Ninetales bringing eternal sun, many Pokemon look to make use of its great ability. Chlorophyll users such as Venusaur and Jumpluff are able to abuse their fast Sleep Powder, and Jumpluff supports the team with moves such as Rage Powder, Encore, and Helping Hand. If one is looking for offense, Shiftry has powerful Grass- and Dark-type STABs while taking advantage of Chlorophyll.</p>"

      "Sun Support": {
        "description": "<p>An Iron Ball and a Quiet nature guarantee that Ninetales will be slower than every weather starter that lacks Iron Ball, aside from Hippowdon, who sees little usage. With this in mind players may lead with Ninetales and have little worry of opposing weather being set up. Ninetales needs a powerful STAB to abuse with sun, and Heat Wave does its job in that category. Its accuracy can be a bit underwhelming at times, however, making Flamethrower a suitable alternative to guarantee a hit. Hidden Power Ice hits the Dragon-, Flying-, and Ground-types which Ninetales may have trouble with. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Garchomp, while Energy Ball helps somewhat with the Water-types that plague Ninetales, especially Politoed. In VGC, Protect is the most important move a Pokemon can have, giving the ability to stall out Trick Room, Tailwind, and other effects. With Ninetales it is no different, as the ability to stay alive for a turn while its partner takes care of a threatening Pokemon can be very handy indeed.</p> <p>An Iron Ball, a Quiet nature, and 2 Speed IVs permit Ninetales to do two things: get sun up in nearly every battle and still retain a desirable Hidden Power. Speed is not the point of this set; in fact the opposite is true, so 252 EVs are invested into HP to increase Ninetales's longevity, while 252 EVs are placed in Special Attack to increase its attacking prowess.</p> <p>Without the high Speed Ninetales possesses on other sets, correct support is vital to keeping Ninetales alive. Hitmontop comes in handy when Ninetales is faced with physical attackers. Hitmontop's ability, Intimidate, allows Ninetales to take multiple physical assaults and the additional Wide Guard support Hitmontop brings to the table is nearly unrivaled in VGC. Shiftry is another great partner for Ninetales, outspeeding nearly everything in the sun that Ninetales brings and decimating Water-types with its STAB Seed Bomb. Additionally, Jumpluff outspeeds all Pokemon in sun and can toss around Sleep Powder, while boosting Ninetales's attacks with Helping Hand.</p> <p>Though its base 100 Speed may not suggest it, Ninetales can function very well in a Trick Room environment. With an Iron Ball and minimum Speed, Ninetales is slowed down to 47 Speed at Level 50, just low enough to work in Trick Room. Cresselia is a good candidate to set up Trick Room, having massive defenses and the ability to support Ninetales with the move Helping Hand. Additionally, the sun Ninetales starts allows Cresselia to use Moonlight to restore up to two-thirds of its health, something that it often lacks. In addition, with an Iron Ball, Ninetales can function as a pseudo-Trick Room counter, outspeeding common abusers in Trick Room.</p>"

  "Parasect": {
    "overview": "<p>Parasect is one of the golden few blessed with access to Spore. Despite possessing worse bulk than Amoonguss and being unable to hold a candle to Breloom in terms of offense, Parasect has its own unique niche in the form of Dry Skin. Not only does this ability grant it surprising bulk in rain, Dry Skin also provides Parasect with recovery when hit by Water-type moves, a feature it can abuse with Rage Powder and a teammate's Surf. Unfortunately, Parasect's numerous weaknesses to common attack types in VGC make it difficult for this bug to pull off the goods. Nonetheless, it is capable of performing a very specialized supporting role, and is a worthy consideration for any rain team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If you elect to use Effect Spore, Endure is an option over protect for the chance of Effect Spore hax. This isn't recommended for the Rain Support set, however, as the main use of Protect there is to recover HP. Substitute could also be used to give Parasect an additional buffer against attacks; this is particularly useful when coupled with a Surf user to aid recovery. However, the opportunity to pull this off will be rare. Parasect really requires X-Scissor to effectively damage Latios and Latias, so if you don't use X-Scissor, be sure that your team has a counter. Parasect can play similar to an Amoonguss or Tangrowth using Rage Powder and a sleep inducing move, but those two perform better with their superior bulk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Thanks to its atrocious typing, mediocre offenses and poor Speed, it may be easier to describe what won't counter Parasect. With a 4x weakness to Fire- and Flying-Type attacks, as well as weaknesses to Rock-, Ice-, Poison-, and Bug-type moves, it's a good bet that at least one of the opponents will be able to hit Parasect super effectively. However, Parasect does have surprisingly good bulk, and in rain, the only attacks one really needs to watch out for are Flying-type moves from Pokemon such as Tornadus and other Acrobatics users. Faster Taunts from Pokemon such as Tornadus and Whimsicott, as well as faster Spores from Smeargle, Amoonguss, and Breloom also shut down Parasect, meaning Trick Room support is vital.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rain Support": {
        "description": "<p>Dry Skin gives Parasect the ability to recover a grand total of 18.75% of its maximum HP every turn in the rain and with leftovers, giving him formidable bulk compared to other Spore and Rage Powder users. Parasect can also make use of Rage Powder alongside Dry Skin; partnering him with a Surf user in rain increases his recovery while also enabling him to redirect attacks away from your main attacker. Yes, you read that correctly; That's 43.75% HP recovery every turn, while your other Pokemon is protected and can fire away rain-boosted Surfs. Be cautious however, as Parasect's abysmal Speed calls for Trick Room support. While not entirely necessary for Rage Powder, which has a priority of +3, it is essential to allow him to use Spore effectively. Seed Bomb can be used to demolish Pokemon 4x weak to Grass-type attacks, such as Ground / Water or Rock / Water Pokemon, while X-Scissor is useful for hitting Latias and Latios, but will never OHKO them. Protect, a staple move of the doubles metagame, also helps Parasect gain an extra turn of HP recovery.</p> <p>The EVs and nature are as such because Parasect is mostly going to be sponging specially based attacks such as Heat Wave, Ice Beam, and Blizzard. A Sassy nature and 252 Special Defense EVs help maximize Parasect's chances of surviving these special attacks. 196 HP EVs provide Parasect with the greatest possible Leftovers number, and also gives him a little bulk on the physical side, which may come in handy. Furthermore, his resistances to Fighting- and Ground-type moves help him tank many physically based assaults in VGC. Leech Seed can further contribute to Parasect's bulk, and can replace its attacking move. However, doing so would leave Parasect completely helpless against a Taunt user, so one should be careful when considering this option. Toxic could be used as well, to get past other bulky Water-types.</p> <p>Parasect is a pure support Pokemon, and thus requires a competent attacker to support; good choices to fill this role include Hydreigon, Dragonite, and Latios. Rage Powder can be useful, allowing your attacking Pokemon to safely set up a Swords Dance or use another boosting move, sacrificing Parasect to allow a teammate a free switch in. Another thing to take note of is Parasect's 4x resistance to Ground-type moves, which enables it to sponge most Ground-type attacks. Coupled with its immense recovery, Parasect makes an interesting and viable teammate to Earthquake users, such as Garchomp, Dragonite and Latios. Furthermore, in a clutch situation, it can serve as a guarantee that your attacking Pokemon will be able to finish off the foe.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Parasect can be a pretty mean Sandman, thanks to its relatively respectable base 95 Attack stat. This Parasect plays fairly differently from the previous set as its goal isn't to tank attacks for its teammate, but rather take advantage of Trick Room with Spore and its STAB attacks. Rage Powder is an alternative to Seed Bomb, however, as Parasect's dual STABs, Bug and Grass, have pretty terrible coverage. As this Parasect is more offensive in nature and prefers Trick Room support, it isn't as reliant on rain's Dry Skin recovery. As such, Effect Spore may be the better option to hope for hax, as Parasect won't be investing much into its defenses.</p> <p>The EVs make Parasect as strong and as slow as possible. The 252 HP EVs are in fact somewhat inconsequential, but if you did choose to use Dry Skin with this Parasect, it would at least allow Parasect maximum Surf recovery. One of Parasect's biggest strengths in this metagame is being a great Trick Room counter thanks to its abysmal Speed coupled with Spore, as well as its ability to 0HKO Latios and Latias with max Attack investment 100% of the time.</p> <p>Using a Focus Sash carries its own risks. Abomasnow, Tyranitar, and Hippowdon all break Parasect's sash with their respective weathers, making Parasect a poor choice against such teams. Multi-hit moves and Fake Out also break Parasect's sash, often leaving him without the opportunity to do much at all. Furthermore, faster Spore users will shut Parasect down before Trick Room has a chance to go up if you don't predict properly with Protect.</p>"

  "Persian": {
    "overview": "<p>Unnerving as it may be, Persian doesn't receive much movepool-wise, but it still gets everything it needs to have to become a potent team player in VGC 2012. Among such gifts are Fake Out and Unnerve, which is a combination unique to the Classy Cat, striking fear into the hearts of Pokemon such as Yache Garchomp and Chople Tyranitar. Beyond this, however, Persian fails to meet even the lowest of expectations with a base 70 Attack and 65 / 60 / 65 defenses that makes Pokemon like Whimsicott look like a brick wall in comparison. Keep this in the back of your mind, though, and play Persian to its strengths; it will surely dominate Berry-reliant Pokemon, making it a great addition to teams bothered by these threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Persian unfortunately does not receive Icy Wind, Seed Bomb, Headbutt, or even Knock Off in conjunction with Unnerve. If you are in need of a Persian with any of those moves, you will have to stick with Technician or Limber, but keep in mind that Unnerve is the main reason to use Persian. Hypnosis goes well with Unnerve, bypassing status-removing Berries, but its accuracy is shaky to say the least. It is important to note that a Swagger-Persim Berry combination can be used with your teammate, as Unnerve does not affect your own roster. More Unnerve compatible offensive options include U-turn, Aerial Ace, and Flail. Flail works well with Focus Sash, but hail and sandstorm, as well as priority moves make this an unreliable choice. U-turn can potentially get a teammate in safely, but Persian is better off staying where it is to Unnerve the opponent. Aerial Ace hits Fighting- and Grass-types super effectively, but it doesn't hit them hard enough to use it over Night Slash. Snatch can steal enemy Tailwinds and Substitutes, but it takes quite a bit of prediction to pull off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Teams that don't rely on Berries don't have a problem facing Persian, but they will be annoyed by Fake Out and a potential Charm. Hitmontop and other Pokemon that pack Mach Punch make great counters to Persian given its mediocre defenses. As mentioned before, sets lacking Night Slash don't like Ghost-types, and leading with one can make Persian slightly more predictable. Trick Room can spell death for Persian because of its lack of powerful priority or good defenses. Metagross without an Occa or Shuca Berry can completely ignore Persian as even Charm gets blocked by Clear Body, but it must be wary of Hypnosis.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Unnerve Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Persian sits at a great base 115 Speed stat, which outpaces many of the common Fake Out users, losing only to Weavile and the weather Fake Out users, namely Ludicolo and Shiftry. Protect keeps Persian alive for one turn (and more importantly, it keeps Unnerve active). The other two moves are mostly filler, and there is a lot Persian can do with the extra slots. Charm annoys physical Fighting-types in particular, and Feint removes enemy Protects, allowing you to gang up on whatever threatens you the most without worry. When running something over Night Slash, you must be careful not to let yourself get walled by Ghost-, Rock-, or Steel-types, however.</p> <p>As Persian isn't the Pokemon that's going to sweep teams, pairing it up with Pokemon that can take advantage of Unnerve and Fake Out make great teammates. Mamoswine loves to KO Garchomp right through Yache Berry with an Ice Gem boosted Ice Shard, and most teams appreciate the absence of Chople Berry Tyranitar. Persian has a hard time dealing with Ghost-types, so Pokemon that can take care of them, such as Chandelure, Hydreigon, and Krookodile are good teammates too. Pokemon with access to Spore such as Amoonguss can help patch up Persian's Trick Room weakness, as Trick Room users usually depend on their Lum or Chesto Berries to stay awake, and Persian can Fake Out or Feint their supporters.</p>"

Golduck has a decent base 85 Speed, and it can easily put this to good use with its access to Icy Wind. Its movepool is not the greatest, but Golduck's niche is not in attacking, it is in supporting.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>In order to use Golduck and Shedinja together, Golduck would need a bulkier spread as Shedinja appreciates Focus Sash. The choice between Sitrus, Wacan, and Rindo depends on what kind of support the rest of the team needs; the choice is usually Wacan because of how common Thunderbolt is in VGC. Soak is also a gimmick that is usable with this pair, but it gets stopped by Gastrodon.</p> <p>Golduck does have a few alternatives for its moveset. Like most Water-types, it gets access to Surf, but Surf also hits Golduck's partner, so Scald and Hydro Pump are preferred. Focus Blast is usable, but its poor accuracy and inferior coverage makes Icy Wind the better choice. Ice Beam can be used over Icy Wind for more power. Yawn and Hypnosis are both alternative surprise tactics, but neither work as well as Encore. Magic Coat is very situational and requires a high level of prediction. It helps against Pokemon that abuse Prankster, such as Thundurus and Sableye. Light Screen is another option, but unless Golduck's teammates desperately need a Special Defense boost, it should not be used.</p> <p>Although it does not work as well as the support set, an offensive set with a Modest nature and a Water Gem could be used instead. Swift Swim is usable here, but Cloud Nine outclasses Swift Swim because of how disruptive it can be.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Golduck can easily be beaten by the common Thunderbolt and the slightly less common Hidden Power Grass; without Focus Sash intact, it is easily OHKOed by most Pokemon with these moves. Golduck also has trouble with threats that wall it, such as Rotom-W and Gyarados; the former can easily OHKO Golduck with STAB Thunderbolt as well. Thundurus, Zapdos, and Virizion all outspeed Golduck and OHKO it. Focus Sash is very important against these Pokemon, but it still takes several Icy Winds to KO them. Spread moves are the bane of Focus Sash, breaking it and allowing the opponent's partner to take care of Golduck. Golduck can't do much to Abomasnow without Focus Blast, while Abomasnow can 2HKO it. Politoed is normally on the bulkier side, so it would win one-on-one with Hidden Power Grass. Ferrothorn walls Golduck and handles it with a STAB Power Whip. Golduck can't do much to Scizor, Metagross, and Escavalier other than hope for a Scald burn. Pokemon with the ability Guts benefit from Scald, so Golduck tends to have a hard time with them.</p>",

Of the 4 auto-weather Pokemon, Golduck has big problems with Abomasnow and Hidden Power Grass Politoed, but it checks weather pretty well otherwise. Since many teams in VGC 2012 rely heavily on setting up weather, Golduck is a real nuisance. Cloud Nine is a support ability, so it only makes sense that Golduck's moveset is supporting as well. It should be noted that Cloud Nine does not stop weather from occurring, it just negates any effects that would come from it while Golduck is on the field. Scald is usually preferred because of its chance to burn, as well as better accuracy than Hydro Pump. Icy Wind helps with coverage and slowing threats down. Focus Sash can't be broken by weather, so it's a great choice for Golduck. It also helps Golduck survive powerful boosted attacks, which is highly useful considering the prevalence of Gems in VGC. Protect is a given, as it is needed to preserve Focus Sash and to keep Golduck's Cloud Nine active as long as possible. The choice between Hidden Power Electric, Hidden Power Grass, and Encore can be complicated; it depends on how Golduck's teammates handle threats. Hidden Power Electric is mostly for Gyarados, but it also hits other common threats such as Rotom-W. Hidden Power Grass can be used if Golduck's teammates have problems with Gastrodon. Encore, is more of a surprise factor that works if Golduck does not need the coverage from the Hidden Powers.</p> <p>Timid is Golduck's best choice for the nature as it allows Golduck to benefit from Icy Wind. Heracross, Nidoking, and Cresselia have the same Base Speed as Golduck, but with Timid, Golduck will almost always outspeed them. Since Golduck is running Focus Sash, it doesn't need any bulk; the given EV spread makes the best use of Focus Sash. Although Golduck is a support Pokemon, it doesn't mind the added support Rage Powder Amoonguss and Follow Me Electivire bring; Amoonguss and Electivire each handle one of Golduck's two weaknesses. Although this help is appreciated, Golduck can also help its partner handle the opponents as well, as it can hold its own against Ninetales and Tyranitar. Technician Hitmontop and Virizion are good partners as well, as they can deal with Abomasnow and Politoed, two weather inducers that give Golduck trouble.

BW has been kind to Arcanine, providing it with Close Combat and Wild Charge, thus allowing it to have a respectable physical movepool. Although its typing provides Arcanine with a strong offense, its weaknesses to Rock- and Water-type moves can often leave it in a tight spot. Nevertheless, Arcanine is a Pokemon that can fit well on many teams, showing that this old dog still has a few tricks up its sleeve.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arcanine's other abilities, Flash Fire and Justified, can be used, though they aren't quite as useful as Intimidate. Flash Fire gives Arcanine immunity against Fire-type moves, thus allowing its team to better handle Fire-type Pokemon. Justified can allow Arcanine to boost its Attack when hit by Dark-type attacks and works well with an ally with Beat Up for a +4 Attack Boost. Arcanine's stats make it possible for it to utilize a Choice Scarf moveset, but it will often find that being locked into one move is undesirable. A White Herb can be given to Arcanine to allow it to be unfazed by an opponent's Intimidate or be used to counteract Close Combat's defense drops. Arcanine has a number of supportive options at its disposal, including Safeguard, Will-O-Wisp, and Helping Hand, which can allow it to play a support role. Utilizing a defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 100 Def / 156 SpD with a Careful nature allows Arcanine to withstand numerous attacks, including a Timid Latios's Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor, while supporting the team with Helping Hand. Finally, it is possible to run a mixed set for Arcanine by utilizing Heat Wave on a moveset. Due to Arcanine's shallow special movepool, it's not recommended to try a full special attack moveset.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As a Fire-type Pokemon, Arcanine's effectiveness is dampened by the presence of rain and Water-type Pokemon. While Wild Charge can help its case, a lot of the common Water-type Pokemon, such as Ludicolo, Kingdra and Gastrodon, have a secondary typing that is resistant or immune to Electric-type attacks. Aside from Water-type Pokemon, Dragon-type Pokemon, such as Latios and Garchomp, can take Arcanine on with relative ease, though Latios will need to watch out for ExtremeSpeed and the potential Crunch. Chandelure is immune to Arcanine's main offensive moves and only has to watch out for variants that run Crunch. Jellicent is in a similar position as Chandelure, though it isn't immune to Flare Blitz. It will also have to watch out for Wild Charge.</p>",

Close Combat provides good coverage in tandem with Flare Blitz, and allows Arcanine to strike hard against many Pokemon that resist Fire-type moves. Wild Charge can be used instead of Close Combat because it provides Arcanine with a better option against Water-type Pokemon. However, Wild Charge is weaker than Close Combat against most Pokemon. ExtremeSpeed provides Arcanine with a strong priority move. Because ExtremeSpeed has +2 Priority, it can allow Arcanine to pick off weakened Pokemon, even if they have Prankster as an ability. Protect rounds the moveset off, giving Arcanine a way to block incoming attacks for a turn.</p> <p>The EVs provided for the set maximize Arcanine's Speed and Attack, while holding a Life Orb further powers up Arcanine's offense. As Life Orb is a commonly used item for many Pokemon, Fire Gem or Fighting Gem can be good alternatives. The former makes Flare Blitz an incredibly powerful attack, allowing Arcanine to OHKO Ferrothorn through an Occa Berry regardless of its defensive EVs; the latter strengthens Close Combat, giving Arcanine a chance to KO Tyranitar through a Chople Berry.</p> <p>An alternate EV spread of 196 HP / 252 Atk / 60 Spe gives Arcanine some extra survivability. 60 Speed EVs give Arcanine 123 Speed, allowing it to outspeed Modest Ludicolo outside of the rain. Crunch can be used as an alternative move over Close Combat or Wild Charge, allowing Arcanine to deal damage to Ghost-type Pokemon such as Chandelure and Jellicent.</p> <p>Arcanine's Intimidate support reduces the threat of physical attackers, allowing more fragile sweepers such as Latios, Thundurus, and Choice Scarf Abomasnow to survive a wide variety of physical attacks. Aside from this, Arcanine pairs up well with other Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Hitmontop or Salamence, providing a double layer of attack drops to the opposing team. Gastrodon also makes a good partner for Arcanine. Intimidate allows Gastrodon to stay in play longer, as it prevents Arcanine from being targeted by Water-type moves. In turn, Arcanine can deal with Grass-type Pokemon that threaten Gastrodon with Flare Blitz.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Machamp is the epitome of a bulky attacker. With base 130 Attack and a wide movepool, Machamp is a force to be reckoned with. Moreover, its ability, No Guard, means that it can spam 100 Base Power Dynamic Punch with a 100% chance of confusion, and 90 / 80 / 85 defenses means it can take a lot of hits while dishing back powerful attacks. However, the Superpower Pokemon isn’t without its faults. With only base 55 Speed, Machamp is constantly outsped by Pokemon such as Latios and Tornadus. Furthermore, with Intimidate so common in the metagame, Machamp will find it hard-pressed to keep up a constant stream of assaults. Nevertheless, Machamp is a Pokemon that definitely should not be overlooked.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Machamp gets a huge movepool, and there are many viable alternatives for its moves. Earthquake gives Machamp great spread move coverage, as well as the ability to hit Toxicroak. It also gets Helping Hand, which boosts the power of an ally's attack by 50%. Encore also makes a good option for Machamp, as it can lock Pokemon into moves such as Tailwind or Trick Room, though Machamp struggles to find a moveslot for it. It also gets Light Screen, which gives great team support. However, Machamp doesn't want to give up any of its coverage moves and so many of the above options struggle to fit in on Machamp’s sets. Item-wise, Machamp can use Fighting Gem, as it allows you to OHKO Chople Berry Tyranitar and deal massive damage to anything that gets hit by it. White Herb, though situational, can be used to bypass Intimidate once, allowing Machamp to retain its powerful Attack.</p> <p>Choice Scarf is also a nice option to use on Machamp, as this allows Machamp to fix its Speed problems. With a Choice Scarf and a Jolly nature, an EV spread of 32 HP / 252 Atk / 224 Spe outspeeds Jolly Garchomp, and a spread of 12 HP / 252 Atk / 244 Spe outrun positive natured base 105s. However, Machamp dislikes using a Jolly nature over an Adamant one, as its attacks will be far less powerful than the physical attacker set. And, even if it were to run max Speed, it would still not outpace speed demons such as Latios, Tornadus, and Infernape. Pokemon such as Weavile and your own Latios can be used to counter these threats, and so work well as teammates. A Guts set is also viable, but this means you would have to use Close Combat over Dynamic Punch, which reduces Machamp's great defenses; besides, Pokemon such as Hariyama can pull such sets off better, thanks to Fake Out.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Pokemon that resist Dynamic Punch usually check Machamp. Reuniclus and Musharna make great Machamp counters since they take little damage from Dynamic Punch, are slower (and therefore not hurt as badly by Payback), and can KO back with Psychic. Slowbro also falls in this category, as Payback and Thunder Punch are the only ways to hit it, while it can deal heavy damage to Machamp with Psychic. These counters, however, are not immune to Dynamic Punch and do not enjoy the confusion that it brings. Ghost-type Pokemon such as Sableye and Dusclops are immune to Dynamic Punch, take little from its other attacks, and can use Will-O-Wisp to completely cripple it. This is especially true for Sableye, who gets priority through Prankster. Intimidate cuts Machamp’s Attack and makes its attacks weaker, making it far less of a threat. Finally, as No Guard works both ways, Machamp is susceptible to any OHKO attacks its opponents may have.</p>",

Dynamic Punch is Machamp's greatest asset, as it is easily abused with No Guard. Ice Punch is used to hurt Pokemon such as Garchomp and Zapdos. Stone Edge cannot miss thanks to No Guard, nails Volcarona and Yanmega, and hits Gyarados harder than Ice Punch. Bullet Punch is also a nice option, as it gives Machamp a priority attack to finish off Pokemon at low health. Machamp gets a great move for VGC 2012, Wide Guard, which protects your team from Blizzard, Heat Wave, Surf, Earthquake, or any other spread move that comes your way. This provides great team support, but Protect can be used to block attacks aimed at Machamp, giving Machamp's partner time to take out a threat.</p> <p>Sitrus Berry adds on to its overall bulk, as Machamp can restore a fair amount of HP back when it activates. The EVs and nature give Machamp bulk while also boosting its attack. An alternative option is to run a Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs, as it allows Machamp to abuse its base 55 Speed in Trick Room. As for teammates, Pokemon with access to Thunder Wave work well, as Machamp enjoys being able to outspeed its opponent.</p>"

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its brilliant offensive typing, high Defense, and low Speed, Slowbro makes for an effective counter to speedy attackers and weather sweepers. With the ability to set up Trick Room, outspeed most opponents under it, and deal with threats to other Trick Room sweepers, this 'Bro has what it takes to lead its team to victory. One must not write off Slowbro as just a physically bulky Slowking, as its unique traits allow it to fill a role that Slowking simply cannot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Wacan Berry can be used to decrease the damage from common Electric moves, which Slowbro is weak to, while a Colbur Berry can help Slowbro take a STAB Dark attack from the likes of Tyranitar and Scrafty. Slowbro can use Choice Specs to hit hard without any setup, but it will require Trick Room support from a teammate to perform this job well. Slack Off can provide it with an additional way to heal, but Slowbro must forgo either Protect or a coverage move. As mentioned, Blizzard has 100% accuracy in a hailstorm, and can be used on a hail team. Fire Blast hits noticeably harder than Flamethrower, but at the cost of lower accuracy. Grass Knot is an option to hit bulky Water types that would otherwise wall Slowbro. Shadow Ball and Signal Beam hit Ghost- and Psychic-types, but Slowbro's main STAB attacks are usually better. Icy Wind and Thunder Wave are good options to lower the opponents' Speed outside of Trick Room. Slowbro's physical bulk also lets it effectively use Counter to surprise physical attackers.</p> <p>Slowbro is capable of running a support role both in and out of Trick Room. Heal Pulse can be used to heal a partner and works well under Trick Room. However, Rage Powder or Follow Me can make this strategy backfire, and note that if Slowbro's partner faints before Heal Pulse lands, an opponent will be healed instead. Light Screen can be used to bolster your team's Special Defense, enabling Slowbro to better sponge strong super effective special attacks. Safeguard can be used to prevent status, notably sleep, which can put a stop to a Trick Room sweep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ferrothorn, Rotom-C, Ludicolo, and Amoonguss can take any attack in Slowbro's arsenal barring Fire Blast or Flamethrower and hit back with STAB Grass attacks. Rotom-W can take Slowbro's STAB attacks and swiftly KO with STAB Thunderbolt. Similarly, Zapdos and Thundurus can strike Slowbro down with their own STAB Thunderbolts. Due to Storm Drain, Gastrodon completely shuts Slowbro down if it lacks both Grass Knot and Psychic. Hydreigon's STAB Dark Pulse inflicts heavy damage, while Latios and Latias both have access to Thunderbolt; these Pokemon only fear the rare Ice Beam or Signal Beam. Lastly, Escavalier outspeeds Slowbro under Trick Room and will OHKO with STAB Megahorn; however, it must be wary of Flamethrower or a Scald burn.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Slowbro relies on its high bulk to set up Trick Room, shrugging off the majority of physical attacks directed at it. Once Trick Room is up, Slowbro can function as a powerful, bulky sweeper with its good Special Attack, low Speed, and dual STAB attacks. Scald is its main attack, dealing solid damage while also having a nifty 30% burn chance. As Scald is a Water-type attack, rain support will greatly increase Slowbro's offensive power. Surf can be utilized to hit both opponents, but a suitable partner such as Ludicolo or Toxicroak is required to mitigate the damage that Surf will otherwise do.</p> <p>Psychic is used to take down Fighting-types such as Hitmontop, Toxicroak, and Hariyama; it also functions as a strong secondary STAB. Due to Slowbro's physical bulk, it is never 2HKOed by Sucker Punch from Hitmontop or Toxicroak without a Dark Gem, while Psychic will 2HKO in return. If Blissey or other special walls are of concern, Psyshock can be used instead to deal physical damage while still receiving a STAB boost.</p> <p>Protect is a staple in this metagame, allowing Slowbro to stop a predicted Fake Out or Taunt and guard itself from attacks while its partner eliminates a threat. However, using Protect will limit Slowbro's coverage, so either Ice Beam or Flamethrower can be used in its place. Ice Beam hits the ever-common Zapdos, Thundurus, and Latios for super effective damage, while Flamethrower will hit Metagross, Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Abomasnow, likely OHKOing the latter two outside of rain.</p> <p>The EV spread gives Slowbro near maximum overall bulk; the rest is put in Special Attack to nearly maximize damage. A 0 Speed IV is essential to make Slowbro as fast as possible under Trick Room. Slowbro's Regenerator ability and a Sitrus Berry grant it incredible longevity and the capability to take many hits. Mental Herb can be used to stop the effects of Taunt, virtually guaranteeing Trick Room gets set up.</p> <p>As Slowbro has trouble with bulky Water-types, it appreciates partners that can dispose of them. Ferrothorn works extremely well under Trick Room with its incredible bulk and powerful STAB Grass attacks. Eelektross is also an excellent Trick Room partner that can zap Water-types with STAB Electric attacks. Slow, bulky Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr, Scrafty, and Hariyama all benefit from Trick Room and can scare away Ferrothorn with STAB Fighting attacks; the latter two can also use Fake Out to give Slowbro a better chance of setting up Trick Room.</p> <p>Politoed's Drizzle ability brings rain, which boosts the power of Scald and Surf. Rain speeds up Swift Swim users as well, making them much slower while Trick Room is in effect. Slowbro also works well with Abomasnow, as hail makes Blizzard 100% accurate.</p>"

  "Cloyster": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting amazing physical bulk and respectable Attack and Speed stats, as well as good offensive typing and type coverage, Cloyster is a threat to prepare for in the VGC 2012 metagame. While stat-boosting moves are often frowned upon in such a fast-paced metagame, Cloyster is one of the few Pokemon that can effectively boost and sweep the opponent's team with proper team support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A White Herb can be used to nullify the defensive drops from using Shell Smash, but a Focus Sash guarantees that Cloyster can get the Shell Smash off. Explosion can be used once Cloyster is brought down to its Focus Sash, but due to the abundance of Protect, it isn't as effective as its other moves. Cloyster receives a good special movepool, but a specially based set won't be able to take advantage of Skill Link. Ice Shard can be used if priority is desired, but after a Shell Smash, Cloyster is fast enough to outpace most Pokemon. Scizor is the only notable Pokemon priority would hit, and the attack would be shrugged off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Because there is no Pokemon that receives both Follow Me / Rage Powder and Wide Guard, Cloyster can be KOed by priority moves such as Bullet Punch and double-targeting moves such as Rock Slide. If Cloyster isn't packing Hidden Power Fire, several Pokemon become easy checks. Scizor and Metagross resist both of Cloyster's attacking moves and can KO with priority or Meteor Mash.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<p>Although boosting moves are typically frowned upon, Cloyster is one of the few Pokemon that can consistently set up and sweep the opponent's team with ease. After a Shell Smash, Cloyster is able to KO almost every Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame with Icicle Spear and Rock Blast, which always hit five times due to Skill Link, allowing Cloyster to threaten Pokemon such as Zapdos, Latios, and Garchomp. Multi-hit moves are also useful for overriding type-resist Berries and KOing the holder. Hidden Power Fire ensures Cloyster is not walled by Scizor, but if Cloyster is hit down to its Focus Sash, priority Bullet Punch will KO it. While getting the KO on Scizor is important for Cloyster, Protect is a decent alternative, allowing Cloyster to shield itself from an attack while its teammate KOes the threat.</p> <p>Focus Sash is essential if Cloyster wants to use Shell Smash. With the given EVs and the Lonely nature, Cloyster after a Shell Smash hits 242 Speed, just shy of Speed tying Ludicolo in rain due to Hidden Power. If outpacing Ludicolo and other Pokemon is important, a Hasty nature can be used; however, the drop in power is noticeable. After a Shell Smash, Cloyster can utilize STAB moves such as Hydro Pump and Shell Razor to hit other Pokemon for super effective damage. Hydro Pump and Shell Razor hit harder against Pokemon that are only 2x weak to Fire-type moves. Pokemon that can use Rage Powder or Follow Me, such as Amoonguss, make good teammates as they draw in Fake Outs and Thunderbolts that would otherwise KO Cloyster. A partner with Wide Guard, such as Hitmontop, blocks Cloyster from Discharges and Rock Slides from common threats. A Fake Out partner helps Cloyster get the Shell Smash off, ensuring that Cloyster isn't KOed that turn.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>There isn't anything about Cloyster that screams \"Choice Scarf user\", especially with its middling Speed and Attack stats. To demonstrate how effective this set is, take a closer look at Icicle Spear. Cloyster's Skill Link essentially turns it into an Ice-type Close Combat with no negative repercussions, as well as the ability to bypass Focus Sash and Yache Berry. Although a base 95 Attack stat doesn't sound too attractive on paper, that's still on par with the likes of Hitmontop. Add that to the fact that many common Pokemon take at least neutral damage from Ice-type attacks, you have yourself a really potent threat on your hands!</p> <p>Icicle Spear is the star of the show. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Cloyster can outspeed and OHKO 252/0 Zapdos, Yache Berry Garchomp, Latios, Thundurus, Tornadus, and many more. It's absolutely hilarious to see threats such as Zapdos have their Sitrus Berry activate midway through the attack, only to have them faint after all five hits. Rock Blast provides additional coverage and deals with any Fire-types that stand in your way. Razor Shell will be seldom used, but it provides nice secondary STAB and takes a good chunk off the troublesome Terrakion. Explosion is primarily a filler, but it might come in handy once in a blue moon. You're using a Choice Scarf Cloyster anyway, so a second surprise in the form of Explosion doesn't hurt anyone.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Cloyster to hit a magical Speed stat of 180 with a Choice Scarf, just barely enough to outpace positive-natured base 111 Speed Pokemon. From there, the rest is invested into Attack for maximum firepower. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP for some additional bulk. A Naughty nature can be used with a special attack in the fourth slot, but it probably won't be seeing much use. If you choose to run a Naughty nature, make sure you move the HP EVs into Special Attack. Prominent special options include Hidden Power Fire, Surf, Hydro Pump, Blizzard, and Ice Beam. For a few wacky hijinks, Protect is an option in the last slot. Using Protect and immediately switching out on the next turn might fool your opponent into thinking you're not using a Choice Scarf at all. Maximum Speed with a Jolly nature is also an option that allows Cloyster to outrun maximum Speed base 115 Pokemon, as well as Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Choice Scarf Abomasnow. Be warned that the power difference is noticeable, so give it some thought first.</p> <p>As for teammates, Cloyster can't handle multiple opponents at once, so Follow Me, Rage Powder, or Fake Out support is greatly appreciated. Not only does Hitmontop make a stellar Fake Out user, but it can lower the power of opposing Rock Slides with Intimidate or block Rock Slide, or any other spread attack, with Wide Guard, as well as smack Steel-types that resist Icicle Spear with Close Combat. Amoonguss can redirect Fighting-, Grass-, or Electric-type attacks aimed at Cloyster with Rage Powder, sponge Fake Out from slower opponents, and even put your opponent to sleep with Spore, giving Cloyster plenty of time to attack. Not only is Volcarona a good user of Rage Powder as it resists the Fighting- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Cloyster, but it also outspeeds the majority of Fake Out users, guaranteeing that Cloyster will be free to attack (burning Fake Out users with Volcarona's Flame Body is also hysterical). Be cautious if using Volcarona and Cloyster together, as two Pokemon weak to Rock Slide isn't the best idea. Pokemon that love having Garchomp and Zapdos out of the way are also great teammates to consider. Metagross springs to mind as a good candidate—it loves firing off Meteor Mash and Earthquake without the ever-annoying Zapdos in the way.</p>"

  "Hypno": {
    "overview": "<p>Hypno's decent 85 / 70 / 115 defenses make it bulky enough to take some strong hits. Hypno's useful abilities, Insomnia and Inner Focus, nicely help it set up Trick Room. It has balanced Attack and Special Attack stats, meaning it can attack from either side effectively. Hypno's Speed stat is somewhat high, but it is low enough to still abuse Trick Room well. One of Hypno's best traits is that no one knows what Hypno does. Hypno is obviously not your standard Pokemon in VGC, and not many people actually know about its abilities and what it's actually capable of.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hypno has many other options it can use. Hypno could abuse Trick very well, using items such as Choice Scarf or Choice Specs to lock the opponent into moves that are less desirable. Flatter is a fine option to attempt messing with physical attackers and confusing them. Swagger works similarly against special attackers. Thief could be another option, especially after you use your item and want to mess with your opponent in any way possible. A physical or special attacking Trick Room abuse set could be used on Hypno, but so many other Pokemon take the role better such as Jellicent or Dusknoir. Hypno can abuse Disable very well to rid the enemy of pesky moves that can hit very hard against Hypno, or moves that your opponent may abuse a lot, such as Protect or Rage Powder / Follow Me.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gallade makes a decent counter to Hypno, since it can reset Trick Room, hit Hypno pretty hard with Shadow Sneak, and resist some moves Hypno can throw at it. Dark-types, such as Tyranitar and Bisharp, wall most of Hypno's attacks. Metagross is also hard to deal with, and can hurt Hypno pretty easily with Meteor Mash or Earthquake. Although Hypno can take attacks from Reuniclus, Musharna, and a few other Psychic-types, it has a hard time hitting back. All it can do is either put them to sleep or set up Safeguard for team support.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Tank": {
        "description": "<p>Hypno is a great Trick Room setter and benefits from it a lot. This is due to the sheer bulk it has with the given EV set. You can use Safeguard to prevent statuses, such as burns, paralysis, and sleep, wreaking havoc for your team. Hypno can also put threats to sleep, with Hypnosis. After all, it is called Hypno for a reason. Psychic is Hypno's main attacking option, as it's its strongest, and most reliable special attacking move. Protect is a staple move on nearly any VGC Pokemon, as it allows Hypno to last longer in the battle and thus gives it a greater chance to beat other Pokemon. It can be used to stall out certain strategies and scout out dangerous moves. Substitute can be used, if you expect things like Sucker Punch to come your way or if you think your opponent will do anything else that will give you a chance to set up a Substitute.</p> <p>Lum Berry stops status inducers such as Amoonguss and Breloom from disrupting Hypno while it is setting up Trick Room. Mental Herb is also nice to get the easy Trick Room or Safeguard set up without the worry of being Taunted. Relaxed nature minimizes Hypno's Speed, which is the optimal choice when abusing Trick Room, and raises its Defense, allowing it to take hits better from physical attackers. Inner Focus is a great ability for Hypno, as it prevents Hypno from being flinched from the likes of Hitmontop, Infernape, and Hariyama. The EV set lets Hypno easily tank strong special and physical hits. The Special Attack EVs make sure that Hypno can still do some damage once Trick Room is up or once Hypno is Taunted and can't do anything else. The 0 Speed IV makes Hypno as slow as possible, for optimal use under Trick Room, so it can outspeed as many Pokemon as possible.</p> <p>Hypno likes having Rage Powder or Follow Me support from Pokemon such as Togekiss or Amoonguss. They help Hypno set up Trick Room and not get hit by some hard hitting moves. Togekiss is an especially good partner, because it can use Follow Me and attract Ghost-type moves aimed for Hypno that won't affect Togekiss. Dark-types are very hard for Hypno to deal with, especially when they're physically offensive, such as the common Bisharp and Tyranitar. That's why Fighting-type support from Hariyama or Hitmontop would be beneficial. Support from these kinds of Fighting-type Pokemon can not only get rid of Dark types, but they can also provide Fake Out support, which is welcome, since then, Hypno has to deal with one less Pokemon when setting up Trick Room. Common Trick Room abusers, such as Rhyperior and Snorlax, are excellent teammates because they work with Hypno once Trick Room is set up.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Kingler is an interesting Pokemon to use in the VGC 2012 metagame. It manages to hit pretty hard thanks to its base 130 Attack, and in conjunction with a decent physical movepool, it can be a surprise threat to some teams. However, due to its base 75 Speed stat, numerous threats such as Thundurus, Zapdos, and the Rotom formes outspeed it. Thanks to its middling base 75 Speed, Kingler is a good Trick Room sweeper as it has an edge over many of its common checks. Kingler can also be a good sweeper under the rain, but it usually finds itself outclassed by other common physical attackers found on rain teams, such as Toxicroak and Kingdra.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kingler has a few other cool options that it can use. Even with a low base 75 Speed, when equipped with a Choice Scarf, Kingler can outspeed base 120 Speed Pokemon such as Weavile and Swellow. However, a base 75 Speed is still fairly low, making Trick Room a viable option for Kingler. Sadly, Crawdaunt completely outclasses Kingler at running a Trick Room set, due to its lower Speed, better special bulk, and useful secondary STAB. Flail with Focus Sash can be used, but with the barrage of spread moves that you'll find in doubles, Kingler may find setting up difficult. Other attacking moves such as Return and Brick Break can be used for slightly better neutral coverage, but they have lower Base Power. Wide Guard can be used to provide teammates with protection from moves such as Discharge, Surf, and Blizzard. Finally, Sheer Force can be used, but sadly Kingler has too poor a movepool to make use of this amazing ability.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Even though the rain can be Kingler's friend, it attracts a lot of its threats that take advantage of rain and can beat Kingler one-on-one, such as Ludicolo, Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Zapdos. Choice Scarf Abomasnow can easily outspeed Kingler and OHKO it with Giga Drain. Sun can make Kingler completely useless by halving the power of Crabhammer, with most Pokemon commonly found on sun teams resisting or only taking neutral from Kingler's coverage moves. Strong special attackers such as Chandelure, Thundurus, and Latios, can easily break through Kingler's awful special bulk and OHKO it with their powerful STAB moves. In general, most Electric-types, such as Rotom-W and Thundurus, that can outspeed Kingler can quickly take it out with their STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set is probably the best set you're going to be able to get out of Kingler. Crabhammer is the best STAB move in Kingler's arsenal, hitting many common threats in the metagame, such as Tyranitar, Terrakion, and Infernape for tons of damage. X-Scissor is for coverage in the second slot, hitting Psychic- and Dark-types such as Reuniclus and Slowking for super effective damage. It also hits Water-types such as Politoed and Rotom-W for neutral damage. Superpower provides the same coverage, although it is ineffective against Psychic-types; however, the Attack and Defense drops can be annoying as they pretty much force you to switch or treat Kingler as death fodder for the rest of the match. The third slot is all filler due to Kingler's lack of a better movepool. However, these options are still worth using in a battle. Rock Slide surprises Flying- and Ice-types, such as Zapdos and Abomasnow, that think they can tank a Crabhammer. However, due to Rock Slide's low offensive output, Guillotine can actually be a solid option to use. Even though it has god-awful accuracy, it can net surprise KOs every now and again. Protect helps Kingler stay safe for a turn from possible threats, such as Zapdos and Rotom-W, while a partner takes care of them with moves of their own. Protect can also be used to prevent being hit by the common Fake Out.</p> <p>Kingler is highlighted for its attacking abilities, making Life Orb ideal for maxing out Kingler's offensive output. However, when the recoil damage of Life Orb is combined with Kingler's very low special bulk, it is left open to many hard hitting special attackers, such as Chandelure, Nidoking, and Thundurus. Focus Sash enables Kingler to tank a hit from any of the aforementioned Pokemon and retaliate back with one of its own moves. Hyper Cutter is Kingler's best ability, giving Kingler an immunity to the ever-so-common Intimidate. An Adamant nature along with maximum investment in Attack and Speed enables Kingler to hit as hard as possible and outspeed all neutral base 70 Speed Pokemon, such as Hitmontop and Metagross.</p> <p>Kingler loves the support of Pokemon with Prankster that can set up Rain Dance, such as Thundurus and Sableye. These two Pokemon are more effective teammates than Politoed as they minimize the team's weakness to Grass- and Electric-type attacks, as opposed to worsening them. They are also able to change the weather condition instantly, which help Kingler against Pokemon such as Drought Ninetales and Sand Stream Tyranitar. Lightning Rod users can help Kingler a lot by taking incoming Thunderbolts and Thunder Waves, which can then either be used to raise their Special Attack, or in the case of Ground-type users, can simply be absorbed. Supporting Pokemon such as Sableye, Cresselia, and Hitmontop, can each help Kingler do its job through support from Fake Out, Helping Hand, and Trick, respectively.</p>"

  "Marowak": {
    "overview": "<p>With lower-than-average base stats, one may wonder why Marowak deserves to be used over other Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame. The answer is simple: Marowak's signature item, Thick Club, doubles Marowak's Attack stat, allowing the bone wrangler to enter the field with an enormous 289 Attack stat while still being able to switch moves. Combine this with its low base Speed, a fantastic ability in Lightning Rod, and decent defenses to make up for its low HP stat, and you will find Marowak to be a great Trick Room abuser.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Marowak has few moves it can utilize successfully in the VGC metagame aside those already listed. For one, Marowak can utilize ThunderPunch to hit Water-types, most notably Gyarados, but the move does not provide much additional coverage as Bonemerang already hits most Water-types for the same amount of damage. Double-Edge can be used in conjunction with Rock Head over another move for good coverage, but losing Lightning Rod means Marowak provides no support for its partners. Lastly, Marowak can utilize Low Kick to hit one of its counters, Bronzong, for a decent amount of damage in rain, but outside that it has relatively no use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Although Marowak's attacking power is immense and it will likely 2HKO anything that dares switch into it, Marowak is not perfect and has a few easy-to-exploit flaws. Marowak's Speed stat leaves much to be desired. It is easily outsped outside of Trick Room, meaning if you can prevent Trick Room from going up, you will have effectively quashed any hope it has of sweeping. If Trick Room does happen to go up, Ferrothorn can outspeed and OHKO Marowak with Power Whip. Alternatively, you can utilize Intimidate against Marowak to make its attacks bearable. Hitmontop does a fantastic job at this role as it can Fake Out and Intimidate Marowak, use its Eject Button, and come back in again to do the same thing.</p> <p>Even in Trick Room, Marowak's low bulk often makes it victim to attacks that will OHKO it since it cannot OHKO all of the VGC metagame. While Marowak may be capable of surviving a few neutral STAB attacks, it cannot take virtually any strong Water-type move. Rotom-W fills this role well, since the washing machine can easily stomach any attack and retaliate with a super effective Hydro Pump. Should you lack access to these moves or Pokemon in a match, you may as well just try to simply stall out Trick Room. The move Wide Guard deserves a special mention, as it blocks Marowak's Earthquake and Rock Slide, forcing it to use Fire Punch or Bonemerang. Be careful about attempting to stall out Trick Room with Protect though, for if Marowak manages to predict correctly and nab a Swords Dance, it will OHKO all Pokemon on the field that do not Protect themselves. Should you be placed in such a situation, then your only hope is to continue stalling out Trick Room, as it will become a sitting duck when the dimensions revert to their original state.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Marowak's low Speed and signature item allow it to distinguish itself as an exceptionally talented Trick Room attacker. Earthquake and Rock Slide are the bread and butter of the set, not only achieving great coverage, but also hitting multiple Pokemon at once. The third moveslot is dependent on the team's needs. Fire Punch enables Marowak to OHKO Ferrothorn outside of rainy weather, and grants perfect coverage, but leaves Marowak with a fairly weak move to use against the opposition when it has a partner vulnerable to Ground-type moves. Bonemerang fixes this problem; by providing Marowak with a powerful move that does not hit its partners and hits Ferrothorn for the same damage as Fire Punch in the rain. Lastly, Marowak's immense power virtually forces its opponents to use Protect. This makes Swords Dance a fine option, as it is an excellent way to take advantage of a predicted free turn; nothing will be able to take Marowak's attacks after a boost. If you find prediction too difficult, then you may opt to use Detect, a staple move in doubles that protects the user, scouts, stalls, and allows Marowak's partner to use a spread move that would otherwise hit Marowak.</p> <p>Marowak requires Trick Room support to be able to maim its opponents, so partners that can twist the dimensions are appreciated. Cresselia, Musharna, and Bronzong make fine partners as their bulk and typing allow Trick Room to be set up with ease. All three deserve a special mention as their abilities allow them to avoid the tremors Marowak produces, while Musharna can also boost the power of Earthquake with Helping Hand.</p> <p>Marowak's ability, Lightning Rod, allows it to absorb Electric-type attacks from its enemies. This makes Pokemon such as Jellicent and Gyarados great partners as they no longer have to fear being hit by Electric-type moves—barring Discharge. The former is capable of setting up Trick Room for Marowak and discourages the use of Surf, while the latter not only avoids Earthquake, but also increases Marowak's physical bulk with its fabulous ability, Intimidate. Speaking of Intimidate, Marowak cannot bear to be hit with it, as it cuts Marowak's Attack stat. Due to the fast paced nature of the VGC metagame, chances are Marowak will be unable to switch out to remove the stat drop. This makes Amoonguss a good partner for Marowak, as it is capable of sending the opponent's Pokemon to sleep, making it easier for Marowak to switch and remove the stat drop. Amoonguss is also capable of utilizing Rage Powder to lure in all Water-type moves not named Surf. Lastly, Marowak loves Gravity support if it can be provided along with Trick Room, as it enables Marowak to now nab Levitating Pokemon and Flying-types with Earthquake. However, it is far from necessary and can be a burden, as it forces Marowak's partners to Protect or have the Telepathy ability.</p> <p>Marowak receives the ability Battle Armor from Dream World, which prevents critical hits. Since Marowak's bulk is by no means impressive and it already has a fantastic ability in Lightning Rod, there should be no reason to use Battle Armor.</p>"

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "overview": "<p>Kangaskhan's main selling point is its ability, Scrappy, which allows its Normal- and Fighting-type attacks to hit Ghost-type Pokemon, thus making Kangaskhan the only Pokemon that can use Fake Out on a Ghost-type Pokemon. In addition to this, Scrappy reduces the number of Pokemon that can safely switch in to take Kangaskhan's STAB moves, making it a surprisingly good offensive threat. While its Normal-typing is far from being a good defensive typing, Kangaskhan has a decent amount of bulk to allow it to take a hit or two. If your team is looking for a Fake Out user and has some troubles with Ghost-type Pokemon, Kangaskhan might be the Pokemon for the job.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>It is possible for Kangaskhan to run a Level 1 Endeavor set, especially since Scrappy allows Endeavor to hit Ghost-type Pokemon. However, this will require Trick Room support and a way to deal with sandstorm and hail to be effective. Aside from this, Kangaskhan has access to Circle Throw, which allows it to phaze out Trick Room users while doing some of damage. Circle Throw also has the added advantage of being able to phaze the target before it uses Trick Room, as Trick Room has lower priority. Earthquake gives Kangaskhan a spread move that also hits just about everything for neutral damage when used in tandem with Return. Lastly, Disable provides an interesting support option, allowing Kangaskhan to shut down an opponent's last used move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Kangaskhan is only weak to Fighting-type attacks, but does not have any resistances. Thus, the easiest way to handle it is to hit it hard with powerful STAB attacks. Although Return and Low Kick will hit everything for at least neutral damage, Metagross and Scizor can take either attack fairly easily and hit back with Meteor Mash and Bug Bite respectively. Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Salamence and Hitmontop, can lower Kangaskhan's Attack, making it easier to handle, but they should be aware that Kangaskhan might still be able to pull off a supporting role if it is running Helping Hand.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Fake Out Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set makes full use of Kangaskhan's Scrappy ability. Fake Out causes any target, except for those with Inner Focus, to flinch in fear for the first turn. Return provides Kangaskhan with a powerful STAB move. However, Double-Edge can be used over it, trading survivability for extra power. Low Kick provides coverage alongside Kangaskhan's STAB move, hitting most Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon super effectively. Between Return and Low Kick, Kangaskhan can hit everything except for Shedinja for neutral damage. Kangaskhan's final move is up to one's preference. Protect allows Kangaskhan to block incoming attacks, which is very valuable in VGC. Sucker Punch provides Kangaskhan with another priority attack, letting it pick off weakened opponents, or strike first against faster opponents. Lastly, Helping Hand allows Kangaskhan to boost the power of its ally's attacks, providing additional team support.</p> <p>28 Special Defense EVs in addition to 252 HP EVs guarantees that Kangaskhan will survive a Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor from Latios. The remainder of the EVs are then placed into Attack to provide some strength to Kangaskhan's moves. Holding a Chople Berry stops Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Terrakion, Gallade, and Hitmontop, from OHKOing Kangaskhan with Close Combat or other Fighting-type attacks. A Normal Gem can be used instead of a Chople Berry, allowing Kangaskhan to dish out respectable damage with a STAB attack. An alternate EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe can be used with a Life Orb, providing Kangaskhan with a more offensively-oriented role on the team.</p> <p>Kangaskhan works great with Pokemon such as Tornadus and Volcarona that use set up moves, such as Tailwind and Quiver Dance. Its ability to flinch Ghost-type Pokemon with Fake Out lets Kangaskhan play a big role in stopping them from setting up Trick Room. To further prevent Trick Room from being set up, Dark- and Ghost-type Pokemon make good allies, hitting many of the common Trick Room users super effectively. If Kangaskhan is running Helping Hand, Choice Scarf users, such as Abomasnow and Chandelure, can be great partners as they outrun most Pokemon and their spread moves can be boosted by Kangaskhan's Helping Hand.</p>"

  "Seaking": {
    "overview": "<p>This generation, Seaking was gifted with the ability of Lightning Rod, which not only draws in Electric-type attacks, but also gives Seaking an immunity to them. Thanks to Lightning Rod, Seaking is only hit super effectively by Grass-type attacks, but with its frail defenses, neutral hits still do good damage. Seaking has a very small movepool to work with, but it still makes due with what it has.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Seaking could run the physical set with Swift Swim and maximum Speed investment, but the likes of Kingdra and Ludicolo are better in the role of a Swift Swim sweeper. Poison Jab is about one of the only other powerful physical attacks that Seaking gets; however, its coverage overlaps with Megahorn's. Seaking has a few Normal-type moves, namely Return and Body Slam, that serve some small use, and offer decent neutral coverage. On a special attacking set, Seaking could run Hidden Power Flying or Hidden Power Fire, the latter if used outside of rain, to fend off opposing Grass-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Grass-types—both fast and bulky ones—are problematic for Seaking; examples include Ludicolo under rain, Venusaur under sun, Ferrothorn, and Breloom. They can either outspeed or tank a hit and proceed to KO with a strong Grass-type attack, such as Giga Drain or Power Whip. Metagross and Scizor take neutral damage from any of Seaking's hits and can easily 2HKO with their own STAB moves. Sun teams can be troublesome for Seaking to handle, as many Pokemon commonly found on them, such as Venusaur and Tangrowth, can tank neutral hits from Seaking and retaliate with a KO.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Waterfall is the main STAB move on the set. With STAB and a potential boost from rain, it hits pretty hard against those who take merely neutral damage from it. Aqua Tail can be used for more power, but at the cost of accuracy. Megahorn gives coverage over Psychic-, Grass-, and Dark-types such as Cresselia, Ludicolo, and Abomasnow. However, its accuracy isn't reliable, so be warned. Horn Drill is pretty cool to take out bulky threats such as Cresselia. Soak can be used to change your partner's typing to Water, to possibly get rid of its other weaknesses. Protect is standard on nearly every single Pokemon in VGC. It can help stall, prevent Fake Out damage, or just keep Seaking protected for a turn, while something else happens to get rid of the possible threats on the field.</p> <p>A Life Orb helps Seaking deal out as much damage as possible; this is especially needed with its base 92 Attack stat. An Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs allow Seaking to hit as hard as possible with its main Water-type STAB and Megahorn. Seaking is in an awkward Speed tier; even with maximum Speed and a boosting nature it doesn't outspeed many threats or common Pokemon you'd want gone, so HP EVs are added for extra bulk. Finally, Lightning Rod is what grants Seaking its unique niche, the most important feature of which is the immunity to Electric-type attacks it grants everyone on the field.</p> <p>Rain support strengthens Seaking's main STAB option, be it Waterfall or Aqua Tail. As Seaking can protect its fellow Water-types from Electric-type attacks, Politoed specifically makes a good partner due to its ability to automatically provide permanent rain. Vice versa, Seaking gives it protection from threats such as Thundurus and Zapdos, who can OHKO with STAB Thunder. Pokemon such as Ludicolo, Ferrothorn, and Breloom can be problematic with strong Grass-type moves, so pairing it with a partner with access to Flying or Fire-type moves helps deal with these threats more easily. Tornadus can also be a good partner as he is able to set up rain and Tailwind, and he can abuse rain himself with Hurricane. Discharge users pair well with Seaking as they can use Discharge freely, without the fear of Seaking getting hurt.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Scald is the recommended STAB move due to its burn chance. Hydro Pump is another option as it is stronger, but its imperfect accuracy can be a letdown. Ice Beam grants Seaking coverage on Dragon-, Grass-, and Flying-types, such as Garchomp, Venusaur, and Thundurus. Hidden Power Grass hits other Water-types, but does not provide much added coverage on top of this. Soak can be used to change your partner's typing to Water, to possibly get rid of other unwanted weaknesses. Protect is standard on nearly every single Pokemon in VGC, as it has many uses in VGC battles, including stalling, preventing Fake Out, and keeping Seaking safe from potential KOs for a turn.</p> <p>A Life Orb can power up Seaking's moves, allowing it to hit incredibly hard after one or two Lightning Rod Special Attack boosts, even though Seaking only has a base 65 Special Attack to start with. As said before, Lightning Rod does so many things for Seaking; most notably, it grants Seaking and its partner an immunity to Electric-type attacks. In addition to this immunity, it also gives Seaking a Special Attack boost for each turn it draws in an Electric-type attack. A Modest nature gets the most power out of Seaking's base 65 Special Attack. In VGC 2012, you won't find Seaking outspeeding many threats in the metagame even with max Speed investment and a positive nature. This lets Seaking use the EVs it would normally invested into the Speed stat, and invest more in HP to increase bulk and survivability.</p> <p>Pokemon who can keep rain up are excellent partners for Seaking as the rain boosts Seaking's STAB move. Politoed is preferred for this as he summons automatic rain upon entering the field. Pokemon with Prankster Rain Dance, such as Tornadus and Thundurus, are also good picks. Thundurus is an especially good partner because it can set rain up with Rain Dance and give boosts to Seaking with Thunder Wave and Discharge. Other Discharge users include Zapdos, the Rotom formes, and Zebstrika. Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Breloom, and Ludicolo, are problematic as they can hit Seaking super effectively and OHKO; this makes Tornadus and Crobat, who are great checks/counters to said Grass-types, good teammates.</p>"

  "Starmie": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Starmie might appear to be a top-tier threat in VGC 2012 with its high base Speed and large movepool. However, even with a Life Orb or another power-boosting item, its base 100 Special Attack is simply not enough for it to beat the opponent's Pokemon before they can KO Starmie. A Focus Sash somewhat remedies this issue, though, and with the right team support, Starmie can cause huge problems to any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Scald is an alternative to Hydro Pump if you would rather not run the risk of it missing, but the power drop is noticeable. Surf is another alternative to Hydro Pump, but it hits Starmie's teammate and is actually weaker than Scald in double battles. Psychic is an alternative to Psyshock, but it does not get any KOs that Psyshock wouldn't; Psyshock is also generally better because it can greatly damage Pokemon such as Blissey and Snorlax. Hidden Power Fire can be used to damage Abomasnow, Ferrothorn, and Shedinja, but it cannot OHKO variants of Ferrothorn and Abomasnow that invest in HP. If you do decide to use Hidden Power Fire, an alternative EV spread of 248 SpA / 12 SpD / 248 Spe should be used. Hidden Power Grass could be used to inflict more damage against Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Gastrodon, but Starmie fails to OHKO either of them. If you do decide to use Hidden Power Grass, an alternative EV spread of 4 HP / 248 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe should be used.</p> <p>Starmie can play a more supportive role with moves such as Icy Wind and Thunder Wave, but Pokemon such as Cresselia usually do this job much more effectively as Starmie is relatively frail. Recover is an option to avoid Sucker Punch and restore HP, but it is rarely useful in VGC 2012. If you want some extra power, Starmie can hold a Life Orb or Water Gem, but it appreciates being able to take a hit with its Focus Sash. Other Gems can also be used, but they will often not be as effective. A Colbur Berry enables Starmie to beat Weavile, take a Sucker Punch, and survive for a turn against Tyranitar, but Focus Sash is usually the better option, as it allows Starmie to survive an attack of any type. Finally, Analytic is an alternative to Natural Cure, but with such a high Speed stat, Starmie will almost always be attacking first.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The likes of Weavile, Speed Boost Yanmega, Jolteon, and Choice Scarf users such as Rotom and Chandelure can outspeed and KO Starmie, but they have to watch out for Focus Sash variants. Sucker Punch users such as Toxicroak and Hitmontop can damage Starmie before it is able to attack, but they have to watch out for Psyshock. Tyranitar can take a Hydro Pump in the sand, knock Starmie to its sash with Crunch, and let sandstorm finish the job. Starmie has difficulty OHKOing many Pokemon, including Zapdos, so if they are not finished off by Starmie's partner, they can pose a threat to it. Gastrodon and Cresselia can take all of Starmie's attacks with ease, but cannot damage Starmie much in return. Ferrothorn, Abomasnow, and Ludicolo are probably the best counters to Starmie, as they take little damage from Starmie's attacks and can hit it hard with the appropriate Grass-type attack. In addition, Starmie has problems against Trick Room teams in general due to its frailty.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set utilizes Starmie's high Speed, decent Special Attack, and great offensive movepool to deal as much damage as possible before it goes down. Hydro Pump is the most powerful Water-type attack that Starmie can use, and it provides Starmie with great coverage in VGC 2012. Ice Beam and Thunderbolt provide BoltBeam coverage, which is particularly effective against the Grass- and Water-types that resist Hydro Pump. Protect has many uses in doubles, as it can be used to stall out an extra turn of Tailwind or Trick Room, and also keep Focus Sash intact. Focus Sash is strongly recommend on Starmie, as it allows Starmie to almost always use at least two attacks.</p> <p>Thunder is generally the best option for Starmie if it is being used on a rain team, as it needs all of the power that it can get. However, it should only be considered when paired with a Pokemon that has Rain Dance or a Drizzle Politoed. Blizzard can be useful as hail is reasonably common in VGC 2012, thanks to Abomasnow's Snow Warning, and it hits both opponents for around the same amount as Ice Beam; note though that it is somewhat unreliable outside of hail. Psyshock can be very useful for beating Fighting-types, such as Toxicroak, Virizion, and Hitmontop, and also to hit Blissey, Snorlax, and Ludicolo harder, but Protect will be more effective in most battles.</p> <p>To make Starmie hit as hard and fast as possible, 252 EVs are placed in both Special Attack and Speed. The remaining 4 EVs are placed in Special Defense in order to eliminate the risk of Pokemon such as Porygon-Z receiving a Special Attack boost from Download. A Modest nature is not recommended, as a Timid nature lets Starmie outspeed common Pokemon such as Thundurus and Latios; the power boost from using a Modest nature is not particularly noticeable regardless. Although switching is not as common in VGC as it is in singles, mainly due to the prevalence of Thunder Wave from Pokemon such as Thundurus and Cresselia, Natural Cure is the recommended ability for Starmie.</p> <p>Rain support aids Starmie greatly, as it boosts the power of Hydro Pump and allows Starmie to use Thunder effectively. Hydro Pump has a colossal 270 Base Power after the rain boost and STAB, so it hits everything that does not resist it for a ton of damage. It should be noted that a rain-boosted Hydro Pump is more powerful than even a super effective Thunder. The power boost from Thunder is quite useful as it enables Starmie to 2HKO Pokemon such as Wacan Berry Politoed and 252/0 Jellicent. A Politoed with Drizzle is the best option for providing rain support for Starmie, but Rain Dance users such as Thundurus and Tornadus can also work, as they would let Starmie beat Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Ninetales with relative ease. Tornadus can effectively provide Tailwind support as well, which can allow Starmie to outspeed and beat Pokemon such as Jolteon, Weavile, and Choice Scarf Chandelure, while also helping against weather-based teams.</p> <p>Many Pokemon can do a great job of supporting Starmie, and most of these can simply defeat Starmie's counters. Fighting-types such as Hitmontop, Terrakion, and Infernape are good picks, as they can defeat common counters to Starmie, such as Tyranitar, Abomasnow, Gastrodon, and Kingdra, with a powerful STAB Close Combat. Additionally, Hitmontop can use Fake Out to stop one of the opponent's Pokemon from attacking for a turn, Terrakion can rack up damage on the opponent's Pokemon and break Focus Sashes with Rock Slide while also being able to OHKO Yanmega, and Infernape can take out Grass-types with Flare Blitz and Overheat. Metagross is another good option, as it can finish off the Pokemon that Starmie fails to OHKO with Bullet Punch, and beat threats such as Tyranitar, Abomasnow, and Hitmontop with Meteor Mash and Zen Headbutt, respectively. Abomasnow's Snow Warning ability helps Starmie beat weather abusers, such as Venusaur and Ludicolo, which would otherwise outspeed and OHKO Starmie, although hail will break Starmie's Focus Sash. Abomasnow can help against Gastrodon, and the hail it provides allows Starmie to use Blizzard.</p> <p>Alternatively, Amoonguss, Togekiss, and Cresselia can support Starmie defensively. Amoonguss can use Rage Powder to deflect attacks such as Sucker Punch and Thunderbolt from Starmie, Spore to put major threats to sleep, and Giga Drain to remove Pokemon such as Gastrodon. Furthermore, Amoonguss resists Grass- and Electric-type attacks, so it can take quite a few attacks that will be targeted at Starmie. Togekiss can also use Follow Me to deflect attacks, but it has more offensive options, allowing it to take out Pokemon such as Hitmontop, Ludicolo, and Abomasnow with Air Slash and Fire Blast, respectively. Additionally, Togekiss can use Tailwind to boost the Speed of your team. Cresselia can provide Thunder Wave or Icy Wind support to help Starmie against the few Pokemon that can outspeed it, such as Jolteon, Weavile, Choice Scarf Chandelure, and weather sweepers; it can also use Trick Room to reverse a possible Trick Room set up by opposing teams, as well as Helping Hand to boost the power of Starmie's attacks. More offensively, it can use Psychic to remove common Sucker Punch users, such as Hitmontop and Toxicroak.</p>"

  "Jynx": {
    "overview": "<p>Jynx has a unique niche in VGC 2012 since she can learn both Fake Out, and a sleep inducing move—Lovely Kiss. Combine this with an excellent new dream world ability that provides great synergy with rain teams, and Jynx becomes a very potent support Pokemon. When it comes to outright attacking, Jynx is no slouch either, with above average base 95 Speed, great base 115 Special Attack, and the coveted Ice-type STAB, she is able to function well as a support Pokemon. Sadly, for all of Jynx’s positive qualities, she has an equal number of negative ones on hand. With a pathetic base 35 Defense stat, she won’t endure many attacks without a Focus Sash, and will find herself the victim of an OHKO if her opponent so much as sneezes on her. Ice typing is fantastic offensively, but it brings a horrible array of weaknesses to common attacks such as Heat Wave, Bullet Punch, and the omnipresent Rock Slide. On top of all of this, she faces stiff competition from Ludicolo and Toxicroak for a slot on most rain teams. Still, given the chance, Jynx can teach any opponent just how annoying a Sleep-inducing Pokemon in a metagame without Sleep Clause can be.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jynx has a few extra support attacks in its movepool for use, and among them are Fake Tears, Taunt, Rain Dance, and Perish Song. If your team really needs any of these attacks, feel free to find an empty moveslot on Jynx and use whichever one you’d like. A few other notable moves, such as Helping Hand and Icy Wind, are also available, but those are Gen IV tutor moves and are incompatible with Jynx's Dream World ability. Nasty Plot is an option, but it’s just so hard to set up in doubles. For a more gimmicky option, Trick Room is a part of Jynx's arsenal. It's only real use is in the surprise factor. Leftovers with Dry Skin in the rain gives Jynx a ton of health, especially in conjunction with friendly Surfs. It's best to try using Substitute when using a set like this to provide Jynx with some sort of safety net. Jynx is very frail, though, so it's tough to make a Leftovers set worthwhile. While an Ice Gem-boosted Ice Beam sounds good on paper, the lack of a Focus Sash really hurts.</p> <p>Energy Ball, Shadow Ball, Focus Blast, and Hidden Power are the extent of Jynx's offensive movepool. If you wish, you can slash any of those over Protect on the first set and try your luck, and see if any of those attacks alleviate certain problems on your team. A Life Orb set with three attacks and either Lovely Kiss or Fake Out might seem tempting, but Jynx needs the safety a Focus Sash provides. If you decide to use Jynx on a hail team as a defense against rain teams, Blizzard is an option for a powerful spread attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Unlike in other metagames, where a sleep clause is in effect, Jynx isn't suddenly easier to counter once it has put something to sleep. While trying to defeat Jynx, sleep is just something you’ll need to work around. That said, Metagross, Scizor, and Hitmontop all love to see Jynx. All three have powerful priority attacks that can bring her down to her Focus Sash. Metagross in particular doesn't care about Ice Beam or Psychic and only fears a Lovely Kiss. Sun teams exploit Jynx's near 4x weakness to Fire in the sun and can KO it with the weakest Fire-type move in their arsenal. Focus Sash is neutered in the sun, as Dry Skin saps HP at the end of every turn when the sun is shining. Rock Slides from nearly anything will KO Jynx or break the sash. Notable mentions of Pokemon with Rock Slide include Garchomp and Terrakion. Blissey, Chansey, and Cresselia take next to nothing from Jynx's actual attacks and can stall her out; however, they don’t enjoy taking a Lovely Kiss at all.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Fake Out and Sleep support together is what sets Jynx apart from Ludicolo and Toxicroak. Against most teams, you'll want to Fake Out on turn one while your partner attacks, and then proceed to put problematic Pokemon to sleep with Lovely Kiss. With Jynx's high base Speed, she can outspeed other Fake Out Users and prevent her own partner from being hit by Fake Out. When using Jynx, it's important to drop your inhibitions from playing other metagames and remember that VGC lacks a sleep clause. Go nuts! With base 95 Speed, Lovely Kiss can be outright devastating when it hits. The remaining portion of the set is fairly self-explanatory. Ice Beam is for STAB and, coming off of Jynx’s solid base Special Attack, it's going to hurt. Protect is one of the most useful moves in doubles and it’s no different for Jynx. Alternatively, if you want Jynx to pack a little more punch, Psychic can be used over Protect since it gains a STAB boost.</p> <p>The EVs are the classic build for frail special attackers. A Timid nature with both Speed and Special Attack maximized help Jynx utilize its two best qualities. Focus Sash is a necessity with Jynx thanks to its terrible physical bulk; this will let Jynx live at least a turn outside of sun or sandstorm. Thanks to its Dry Skin ability, Jynx loves weather support in the form of rain. Politoed is an obvious teammate, providing Jynx with the rain it wants for Dry Skin and helping against Rock- and Fire-types. Thanks to Dry Skin, Jynx will happily take Surfs from her partners and receive a 25% HP bonus. Good candidates for powerful Surf users include the likes of Kingdra, Latios, and Hydreigon.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With Zapdos being the most used Pokemon in VGC 2012, one might look at Gyarados and immediately write it off due to its crippling 4x weakness to Electric-type attacks. Although its weakness to Electric-type moves holds Gyarados back, it is not the weakling one might think. A fantastic ability in Intimidate allows it to shut down some of the top physical attackers in the game such as Hitmontop and Weavile while also backing up its teammates even further with a variety of supporting moves. An excellent Attack stat further complements Gyarados's capabilities, especially because Water is a great offensive type. All of this sets Gyarados up to do great things in the VGC 2012 metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Gyarados is definitely a great pick for providing support, no one said it can't eat its cake, too. An attacking set based around Dragon Dance is a viable option, and the Moxie ability Gyarados receives from the Dream World can allow it to rampage through teams after a single Dragon Dance. Ice Fang could be used if one wants to try to take on Zapdos head-to-head—and not worry as much about accuracy—though Gyarados is going to wind up being recalled to its Poke Ball for a rest, unless Zapdos is critically low on health to begin with. If a more attacking-oriented set is used, Aqua Tail is a viable alternative to Waterfall, providing a much appreciated boost in power, though it has less-than-perfect accuracy and loses out on the flinch chance. Bounce provides Gyarados with a secondary STAB, though it requires a turn to charge and the opponent can easily avoid it with Protect, reducing its effectiveness.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Zapdos has been mentioned several times previously, and with good reason. In most circumstances, Zapdos, and almost any Electric-type, can take Gyarados down with ease. Their STAB Electric moves are 4x super effective on Gyarados, and even with a Wacan Berry, it will be hard-pressed to take more than one attack. Rock-types that switch in on Gyarados, bypassing its Intimidate, hit hard with their STAB Rock Slide, though Gyarados can threaten with its own super effective Waterfall. Pokemon that are immune to or resist Water-type moves go a long way towards stopping Gyarados, especially Gastrodon and Abomasnow, though the latter must watch out for Gyarados carrying Stone Edge.</p>",

Waterfall is arguably Gyarados's best attacking move, and is boosted by STAB, so it hits hard and also has a useful 20% chance to flinch. Gyarados isn't exactly the epitome of speed, so Thunder Wave gives it the ability to slow down foes, and allows Gyarados to imitate Togekiss's deadly paraflinch combo. If one prefers to slow down two Pokemon at once, Icy Wind does just that, although its slightly lower accuracy might be somewhat off-putting. Taunt is a great move for this set, allowing it to cripple common setup Pokemon, such as Cresselia and Dusclops. This allows Gyarados to function as a decent Trick Room counter, which, when set up, turns Gyarados's Speed-dropping moves back on itself. If one does not fear Trick Room, Stone Edge provides an additional attacking option, allowing Gyarados to hit Pokemon resistant to Water-type moves such as Abomasnow, and is Gyarados's best bet against Zapdos. Protect has been called the Swiss Army Knife of VGC, and that is a perfect representation. Its numerous uses include stalling out Trick Room, shielding Gyarados from damage, and allowing weather conditions to take down a Pokemon low on HP.</p> <p>The given EV spread is enough to make one's head itch intensely, but do not fear, it has its place. Maximum HP EVs allow Gyarados to tank most attacks with ease, especially those that are physically-based. The 140 Defense EVs further boost Gyarados's physical capabilities, as do the 52 EVs invested in Attack. The 20 Special Defense EVs guarantee that it can survive a Zapdos's Thunderbolt, provided a Wacan Berry is used. The remaining 44 EVs are put in Speed in order to guarantee that it outspeeds 4 Speed Cresselia, so it can Taunt Cresselia before it can do anything. The aforementioned Wacan Berry is the main item on this set, and for good reason: Gyarados is hard-pressed to do anything if it cannot take an Electric-type attack. If one wishes to avoid type-resist berries, Gyarados can utilize a Lum Berry to great effect, making it a great switch-in to common status users, such as Cresselia and Amoonguss.</p> <p>Intimidate is one of the best abilities in the game; it lowers both opponents' Attack stats when Gyarados switches in. Because of this, Gyarados makes a great partner for many Pokemon that would normally have trouble with physical attackers. Weavile, in particular, works well with Gyarados, appreciating the drop in power from opposing Rock-type moves Weavile loathes, while using its STAB Ice Punch to take on Zapdos and Thundurus, two of Gyarados's biggest counters. Gyarados's Flying-type allows its partner to utilize Earthquake without worrying about damaging Gyarados, further bolstering its role as a supporting Pokemon.</p>"

  "Lapras": {
    "overview": "<p>With respectable bulk and good abilities in Hydration and Water Absorb, Lapras can be a potent threat in the VGC 2012 metagame. A low base 60 Speed makes Lapras a good candidate for Trick Room teams, and it is able to work well in different weather conditions. While it does have these perks, Lapras also has its drawbacks; Lapras's paltry base 85 offensive stats mean that even a physical Latios will hit harder. Still, with the right team support, Lapras is a threat that must be prepared for.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Outside of what is listed, Lapras has a very shallow movepool. Perish Song can be used, but you have to make sure that you have at least one Pokemon left in reserve. Sheer Cold is somewhat viable due to Lapras's bulk, but is gimmicky at best and viable only on the Hydration set. Sing is another option as sleep is always beneficial, but its accuracy is shaky. Psychic can be used to stop Fighting-types, but the only notable OHKO that it gets is on Toxicroak, who can KO Lapras after a Fake Out anyways. One final change you could make is to use Scald or Hydro Pump as Lapras's STAB move. Scald would be beneficial for the Hydration set by providing burn support for the team, while Hydro Pump could help the offensive set by providing a more powerful STAB attack; the choice comes down to a matter of power versus accuracy.</p> <p>There are two other item options Lapras can use. First, Sitrus Berry can be used to improve Lapras's longevity. Chople Berry is another option, helping against the Fighting-types that threaten Lapras. However, Pokemon such as Infernape and Terrakion can still OHKO it with Close Combat whether or not Lapras carries a Chople Berry.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fighting-types, such as Hitmontop, Terrakion, and Infernape, are the best counters to Lapras, as they can all OHKO it with Close Combat. Water-types in general wall Lapras well, though they must be careful of Thunder or Thunderbolt; Rotom-W stands out among the bulky Water-types, as it is able to wall Lapras even if it has Thunder or Thunderbolt. Lapras depends very much on the weather for it to be successful; as such, Tyranitar stands out as a good counter—it gains a Special Defense boost in the sand and can hit Lapras hard with its STAB Rock Slide. Finally, in rain, Ludicolo and Abomasnow are major pains to Lapras, taking only neutral damage from any of its moves and KOing Lapras with a Grass-type attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Hydration": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Lapras's main attributes: bulk and access to Hydration. The idea is to come in while rain is up, take a Water-type attack to activate Absorb Bulb, and proceed to repeatedly attack with STAB rain-boosted Surf. The choice of Thunder or Ice Beam comes down to what you need Lapras to take out. Thunder has perfect accuracy in the rain, but leaves Lapras susceptible to Dragon-types. On the other hand, Ice Beam is an option to take out the Dragon-types that will stop Lapras, but it will allow rain teams to walk all over it.</p> <p>The final two moveslots are the bread and butter of this set. Rest provides full recovery, and, in the rain, Lapras's sleep is cured at the end of the turn, courtesy of Hydration. Protect is standard in the VGC metagame to ease prediction and recover HP, if opting for Leftovers.</p> <p>The above EV spread allows Lapras to only be 3HKOed by Zapdos's Discharge while being able to 3HKO back without an Absorb Bulb boost, or 2HKO with an Absorb Bulb boost. Politoed stands out as one of the best teammates for Lapras, as it sets up rain, indirectly keeping Lapras alive. Politoed can also help by using Surf to activate Lapras's Absorb Bulb. Other good teammates include Amoonguss, who resists Fighting-type attacks, as well as any other Pokemon that can take out Fighting-types.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>While Lapras is typically seen playing a defensive role, this set aims to capitalize on an incorrect prediction and KO specific threats that counter Lapras. For example, Yache Berry Garchomp will survive a +1 Ice Beam from the defensive set; however, the same Garchomp is OHKOed by an Ice Gem-boosted Blizzard. Other examples include Dragonite (with Multiscale), Latios, and even Zapdos.</p> <p>The other three moves come down to supporting the primary STAB option, Blizzard. Surf provides a secondary STAB move, taking out Fire-types that resist Blizzard as well as 2HKOing Tyranitar outside of sand. Ice Shard will help deal with Focus Sash users such as Chandelure; however, if they aren't problems, then Thunderbolt can be used to take out Water-types, most of whom would otherwise wall this set. Protect is, once again, standard in VGC.</p> <p>This set has a couple of EV spreads that can be used. With a neutral nature and 252 Speed EVs, Lapras gets the jump on Gyarados and can KO with Thunderbolt. With a Timid nature and 252 Speed EVs, Lapras can Speed tie with Honchkrow, meaning that it will beat Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Metagross as well. Another option would be to use this set in Trick Room, with a Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs. Lapras functions extremely well with both hail and Trick Room active.</p> <p>Abomasnow is welcomed for this set, as it will allow Blizzard to hit with 100% accuracy. Reuniclus also can be a good partner if you are looking to use Lapras in hail and Trick Room simultaneously, as it is immune to hail, takes out Fighting-types, and can set up Trick Room effectively. Zapdos can help by taking out Water-types if you decide not to run Thunderbolt on Lapras. Once again, Amoonguss is a good partner to draw in Fighting-type attacks. Finally, Kingdra and Ludicolo are beneficial for this set, as their STAB Surf attacks will heal a lot of Lapras's HP due to Water Absorb. However, these two partners are really only beneficial if used in rain.</p>"

  "Vaporeon": {
    "overview": "<p>As a slow Water-type, Vaporeon naturally draws comparisons to Jellicent. Both have access to STAB spread moves not named Surf, are graced with Water Absorb, have similar bulk, and can come in both blue and pink. While Jellicent has a useful Ghost typing and is able to set up Trick Room by itself, Vaporeon has access to Helping Hand and the incredibly annoying and useful combination of Rest and Hydration. With bulk, power, and instant recovery numerous ChestoRest users can only dream of, Vaporeon is certainly not one to be taken lightly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Members of the Eevee family usually have shallow movepools, but Vaporeon's contains many interesting options such as Icy Wind, Fake Tears, Acid Armor, Yawn, Tickle, and Charm. Icy Wind is unfortunately illegal with Hydration, but it slows down opposing Pokemon if you use Vaporeon as a tank with Water Absorb. Fake Tears, Charm, and Tickle soften up opponents for both Vaporeon and its partner, while Acid Armor benefits Vaporeon only, making it useful for gang attacks or Psych Up combos. Yawn coupled with Detect is almost guaranteed to put a Pokemon to sleep, and if the opponent switches, it leaves them vulnerable to gang attacks. Protect can be used over Detect if you feel the extra PP is important, though Vaporeon is then more vulnerable to Imprison attempts. Rain Dance is useful when Politoed bites the dust too early and you need your rain for Hydration or Swift Swim partners. Shadow Ball hits common Psychic- and Ghost-type supporters super effectively, though it's even weaker than a Hydro Pump boosted by either rain or a Water Gem. As odd as it might seem coming off Vaporeon's poor Attack stat, Quick Attack is valuable to combat common Focus Sash users or finish off Pokemon hanging on by a sliver of health. Toxic and Hidden Power Fire are Vaporeon's only way of damaging Shedinja and Ferrothorn, and Toxic is useful when combined with Rest. Leftovers can be used over Sitrus Berry in case of an Item Clause clash, though it heals less than Sitrus Berry in an average match.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Like most Water-types, Grass-types give Vaporeon an extremely hard time. Breloom and Ferrothorn are two prime examples, as they can pelt Vaporeon's weaker Defense with Seed Bomb or Power Whip, or cripple it with Spore or Leech Seed. Abomasnow brings an unwelcome change of weather and can heal itself with Giga Drain given Vaporeon's enormous base HP. Ludicolo and Rotom-W are threats to any pure Water-type with STAB Giga Drain and Thunderbolt, and both benefit from rain, making them even bigger threats. Water Absorb Jellicent and Lapras completely wall Vaporeon without Hidden Power Grass and are able to use Energy Ball or Thunderbolt, respectively, to chip away at Vaporeon, though Rest + Hydration Vaporeon can weather the assaults. Physical Eelektross can light Vaporeon up with Wild Charge and outspeeds it in Trick Room, but Hydro Pump will definitely leave a dent if Eelektross can't outspeed it. Toxicroak is immune to Water-type moves, can use Drain Punch to deal damage and recover, and is able to Taunt to prevent Vaporeon from using Rest.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Tank": {
        "description": "<p>Taking into account its low Speed, high defenses, and good Special Attack, Vaporeon is a natural candidate for Trick Room and rain hybrid teams. Hydro Pump, while inaccurate, has a large chance of OHKOing Tyranitar in sandstorm and, factoring in a Water Gem boost, deals heavy damage to anything that takes at least neutral damage from it, including even specially defensive Cresselia. Muddy Water is only slightly more accurate, but it has the ability to hit two Pokemon at once without harming your own and comes with a nice 47% chance to lower at least one of the opposing Pokemon's accuracy. Scald, while weaker or unable to hit two Pokemon at once, has the perk of a 30% chance to burn and perfect accuracy. Ice Beam is a staple coverage move for any Water-type, and Vaporeon is no exception. Besides Ferrothorn and pure Water-types, Ice Beam and your choice of a Water-type STAB move grant Vaporeon great neutral coverage, as well as putting the ever-dangerous Dragon-types on ice.</p> <p>Helping Hand is naturally a great doubles support move, as it allows moves such as Thunder and Draco Meteor to climb to unimaginable levels of power. Normally, Vaporeon is completely walled by other Water-types, notably Gastrodon and Rotom-W; a quick and easy solution to this is Hidden Power Grass. However, against Rotom-W, it's not a guaranteed 2HKO, as it can outspeed and either OHKO or 2HKO Vaporeon outside of Trick Room. The last move depends on the ability of choice. If you want a good Water-type Trick Room sweeper, want to use Surf to restore Vaporeon's HP, or simply aren't interested in Hydration, Detect is the fourth move of choice alongside Water Absorb as Vaporeon's ability. Rest is obviously best used with Hydration, though if you don't need Helping Hand or Hidden Power Grass, Detect can fit snugly in the third slot.</p> <p>The EVs ensure that Vaporeon isn't OHKOed by Latios's Draco Meteor while accommodating for the drop in IVs when using Hidden Power Grass. 76 Special Defense EVs can be used to prevent Vaporeon from being OHKOed by Latios as well, but HP investment is generally better to improve Vaporeon's overall bulk. If you're not using Vaporeon in Trick Room, switch to a Modest nature and use a 31 Speed IV. As for items, a Wacan Berry fends off Electric-type moves such as Thunder for a turn, which is especially useful with Rest healing Vaporeon back up to full health while its partner takes care of the aggressor. If you're not interested in the insurance of a Wacan Berry nor power of a Water Gem, a Sitrus Berry is useful for instant healing so that Vaporeon don't have to immediately use Rest to recover from a move that would 2HKO it, such as Latios's Draco Meteor.</p> <p>As a slow Pokemon, Vaporeon appreciates Trick Room support. Jellicent can be Vaporeon's partner in crime, as they can utilize each other's Water Absorb abilities in a Surf-spamming free-for-all, though their weaknesses overlap. Gallade can hit Ferrothorn hard with Close Combat, set up Trick Room, and support Vaporeon with moves such as Helping Hand and Will-O-Wisp. Dusclops performs a similar role, though its main form of offense is Night Shade. If you're using rain alongside Trick Room, Level 1 Whimsicott is a valuable teammate, as sandstorm and hail won't break its Focus Sash, allowing it to Endeavor or set up Trick Room in relative safety. Pokemon such as Reuniclus and Porygon2 are also good teammates that can complement Vaporeon's coverage with moves such as Thunder or Energy Ball. Other Trick Room abusers with the Lightningrod ability, such as Rhyperior and Marowak, make great partners as they synergize well with Vaporeon by taking care of Electric-type moves that may threaten Vaporeon.</p> <p>When you want to use Hydration, the number one partner for the job is none other than Politoed. Though they have overlapping weaknesses, Politoed's rain support activates Hydration, and Vaporeon appreciates a boost to its Water-type moves. Despite Rotom-W and Ferrothorn being top threats to Vaporeon, they also make good teammates. Rotom-W can tackle the opposing Water-types that get in Vaporeon's way, while Ferrothorn is Hydration + Rest Vaporeon's partner in crime; together, they often stall out the 15 minute timer with their constant recovery and respectable bulk. Scizor works well in and out of Trick Room and can chow down on various threatening Grass-types with Bug Bite, as well as checking Abomasnow and Tyranitar, allowing you to keep your rain active.</p>"

  "Jolteon": {
    "overview": "<p>Jolteon has always been a staple throughout the generations, but sadly, it takes a step back in this metagame. Known for its high Special Attack and insane Speed stat, Jolteon still plays as an effective and speedy attacker, but the emergence of Thundurus has dampened its presence somewhat. Its movepool is also very shallow; Jolteon must rely on Hidden Power for a secondary attack. Nevertheless, with the right support, Jolteon can be very difficult to stop, and this merits its use on most teams in VGC 2012.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jolteon's offensive movepool is admittedly lackluster, but it has a variety of support options to consider, including Light Screen, Reflect, Helping Hand, Rain Dance, and even Agility with Baton Pass. Cresselia is arguably better at setting up dual screens and using Helping Hand due to its bulk; however, due to Jolteon's Speed, dual screens may be a viable option. Jolteon also has the highest Speed out of all Rain Dance users, allowing it to act as an effective Rain Dance supporter.</p> <p>Although it is already faster than most Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame, Jolteon's Dream World ability Quick Feet can be used in conjunction with a Flame or Toxic Orb in order to outspeed everything in the game, making it a very good Tailwind counter. However, the loss of Focus Sash hampers Jolteon's longevity by a good deal, and since it already outspeeds most of the metagame anyways, Jolteon is better off just using Volt Absorb.</p> <p>Discharge can work as an Electric-type STAB move, allowing Jolteon to hit both opponents, but unless you are running a Ground-type or a Pokemon with the ability Telepathy as a partner, Thunderbolt is typically better, as it doesn't hit Jolteon's partner. Volt Switch is an option that allows Jolteon to switch out of its counters while still dealing decent damage, but Ground-types will render it useless.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Jolteon's biggest weaknesses are fast physical priority attacks, and Earthquake. Enemies such as Hitmontop, Toxicroak, and others who possess a priority physical attack do massive damage while bypassing Jolteon's high Speed. Status also cripples it, especially paralysis; Pokemon such as Whimsicott thus make great checks, as they can Stun Spore Jolteon, crippling it. However, take note that Jolteon is immune to Thunder Wave due to Volt Absorb. Attacks that lower Jolteon's Speed, such as Icy Wind, will also cripple it. Perhaps its biggest counter is Trick Room, where Jolteon becomes the slowest Pokemon on the field; slow, bulky Ground-types such as Gastrodon and Rhyperior can now outspeed and KO it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to take advantage of Jolteon's high Speed and Special Attack. Thunderbolt is Jolteon's main way of dealing damage, and is a reliable, powerful STAB move hitting Tornadus, and the omnipresent Politoed and rain teams for super effective damage. Hidden Power is the best way to get some coverage with Jolteon's regrettably lackluster movepool; Hidden Power Ice hits Ground-types that wall Jolteon, such as Garchomp, as well as the ever popular Dragon-types, Hidden Power Grass eliminates threats such as Swampert and Gastrodon which otherwise wall Jolteon. If running Hidden Power Grass, the EVs should be changed to 4 HP / 248 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe to account for the IV drop. Thunder Wave is great for team support, crippling weather abusers such as Ludicolo and allowing your teammates to outspeed threats. However, if you run a Trick Room team, or already have a teammate who can inflict status, Signal Beam is good for hitting Pokemon such as Cresselia and Tyranitar for higher damage than Thunderbolt. Protect is a staple on any VGC 2012 Pokemon, and Jolteon is no exception, allowing a teammate to take out a counter.</p> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature are used in order to outspeed threats such as Scarf Chandelure, Abomasnow, and Jellicent and Starmie. 252 Special Attack EVs maximize the damage Jolteon's damage output. A Modest nature is an option in order to boost Jolteon's Special Attack further; nevertheless, the ability to outspeed the enemies listed above is far more important. Focus Sash is by far Jolteon's best item option due to its frailness. However, due to item clause, if another teammate is running Focus Sash, you may opt to use Electric Gem in order to boost Thunderbolt's strength.</p> <p>Volt Absorb is Jolteon's ability of choice as it gives it an immunity to Electric-type attacks, allowing it to switch in on Zapdos, Rotom-W and others. This is truly a godsend, as Jolteon's frailty doesn't give it too many opportunities to switch in. Also, if you're running a rain team, Thunder is recommended over Thunderbolt for the added power, although you must watch out for weather changers such as Tyranitar and Ninetales, which can leave Jolteon with an inaccurate STAB attack.</p>"

  "Kabutops": {
    "overview": "<p>While most Pokemon who possess the ability Swift Swim have higher Special Attack than Attack, Kabutops opposes this stereotype, possessing a higher Attack stat compared to its Special Attack stat. Thus, Kabutops is probably one of the best physical attackers who can take advantage of rain. Its Water and Rock typing gives Kabutops two fantastic offensive STABs, allowing it to be an effective attacker. Though frail by some standards and weak to common Fighting- and Grass-type moves, Kabutops is a force to be reckoned with that works well on any rain team. When the clouds open up and rain pours down, Kabutops is turned into a hard-hitting attacker with incredible Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Superpower has a set Base Power of 120 unlike Low Kick, however, it also lowers both Kabutops's Attack and Defense stat upon use. X-Scissor can be used in order to hit Psychic-types especially hard, but otherwise grants no additional coverage. Swords Dance looks enticing, doubling Kabutops' Attack stat, but because battles are so short in this metagame, Kabutops is better off using each turn attacking. Aqua Tail has 10 more Base Power than Waterfall, though the lower accuracy and loss of a flinch chance makes this option unattractive. Kabutops could viably run Rain Dance to set rain up for itself, in the event Tyranitar or Abomasnow switches in to change the weather. Finally, Aerial Ace grants Kabutops the ability to hit Grass-types such as Breloom and Amoonguss for super effective damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Grass-types have an inherent advantage over Kabutops, resisting its main STAB and utilizing their own STAB moves to hit for 4x damage. Abomasnow not only slows Kabutops down by changing the weather, but threatens Kabutops with a super effective Grass Knot or Giga Drain. Zapdos can take a Rock Slide and retaliate with its own STAB Electric move of choice, which Kabutops is unable to handle. Strong Fighting-types such as Toxicroak and Hitmontop deal with Kabutops well, dishing out pain with their super effective STAB moves. Hitmontop is also able to use its ability, Intimidate, to lower Kabutops's Attack stat and weaken it until Kabutops switches out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swift Swim Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Waterfall provides a reliable STAB move, is boosted by rain, and has a chance to flinch, making it Kabutops's go-to move in almost any situation. Rock Slide takes advantage of Kabutops's other STAB, Rock, and hits the Pokemon who threaten Kabutops, such as Abomasnow and Zapdos, for super effective damage. Aqua Jet provides Kabutops a reliable STAB priority move, in the event that Kabutops is paralyzed or Trick Room is set up. While Kabutops's STABs give plenty of coverage, Low Kick may be used instead in order to hit weather setters, such as Tyranitar and Abomasnow, for super effective damage, as the loss of rain on the field is detrimental to Kabutops. Protect is always a useful move to have, shielding its user from damage for a turn and allowing Kabutops's partner to take out a threat gunning for it.</p> <p>Due to Kabutops's frailty, Focus Sash is used so Kabutops can stomach any attack. In the event Focus Sash is unavailable due to Item Clause, a Life Orb may be used instead in order to boost Kabutops's attacks at the cost of some HP every attack. However, it may be the case that both of these items are already in use due to their usefulness; a Rock Gem can be utilized instead to provide one very powerful Rock Slide. Kabutops's ability, Swift Swim, doubles its Speed when rain is falling on the field, making it Kabutops's primary ability. An Adamant nature is used as Kabutops will outspeed virtually any Pokemon in this metagame in rain; however, a Jolly nature may be used in order to outspeed opposing Kabutops.</p> <p>Kabutops relies heavily on rain; thus a teammate who can set up rain is crucial to Kabutops's success. Politoed is probably Kabutops' best teammate in this regard; its ability Drizzle allows it to set up eternal rain by entering the field. Ludicolo is also a strong choice, possessing two abilities that take advantage of the rain; it can Fake Out threats to give Kabutops time to eliminate them, while Kabutops's Rock Slide destroys Flying-types who ruin Ludicolo's day. Cresselia makes for a good teammate, scaring off Fighting-types with its STAB Psychic, and providing support with moves such as Helping Hand.</p>"

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Aerodactyl seems like a rather nondescript Pokemon. Sure, it's fast and has access to Taunt and STAB Rock Slide, but it doesn't hit very hard at all, possesses a weak Flying-type STAB, and has weaknesses to a plethora of common types. However, Aerodactyl was given a subtle but huge improvement in its Dream World ability: Unnerve. Unnerve prevents the opponent's Pokemon from using any of their berries, which means there is no more Yache for Garchomp, Charti for Thundurus, Chople for Scrafty, Occa for Scizor, Shuca for Metagross, Coba for Amoonguss, or Sitrus or Lum for anything. This can be an incredibly potent way to assure KOs with Pokemon that can otherwise be stymied by common resistance berries. This simple change makes Aerodactyl a useful team player, and helps it in its own right against the common users of Charti and Coba Berries.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aerodactyl has Crunch, Earthquake, Aqua Tail, Fire Fang, and Thunder Fang as other coverage options, but it is usually better off with just its STAB moves. Bulldoze is an interesting option for further team support, dropping your opponent's Speed, which can allow your partner to hit them before they attack, and through their berries too! Fly is an interesting option. If your sole goal is to gain more turns of Unnerve support, Fly can glean you a few more turns with the turns that you are invulnerable. However, it is not too effective from an offensive viewpoint, as the opponent can just use Protect on the turns Aerodactyl lands and attack on the turns it goes up; it must be noted that doing this also makes the opponent incredibly predictable, which Aerodactyl's partner can take advantage of. Neither of Aerodactyl's other abilities are at all worth running, and Unnerve is pretty much the only reason to run Aerodactyl anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Aerodactyl's biggest problem is its frailty and weakness to quite a few common types, which makes it fairly easy to counter. Rain teams with Swift Swim users will have an especially easy time with Aerodactyl as Swift Swim Kingdra, Ludicolo, and Kabutops are all able to outspeed Aerodactyl and OHKO it with Water-type attacks. Scizor's Bullet Punch OHKOes Aerodactyl, but Scizor needs to be wary of being OHKOed prematurely by Aerodactyl's partner, especially because it is incapable of using its Occa Berry. Ferrothorn is another good counter, as it can either Leech Seed or OHKO Aerodactyl with Gyro Ball. It even has Iron Barbs, breaking Aerodactyl's Focus Sash on contact. Jolteon is also of note because it Speed ties with Aerodactyl and can OHKO with Thunderbolt. Plenty of other Pokemon are capable of OHKOing Aerodactyl, but really, the best way to counter Aerodactyl is by not having it counter you because you tend to rely too much on resistance berries in the VGC metagame.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Unnerve Support": {
        "description": "<p>Rock Slide is the obvious STAB move that provides a strong hit on both opponents. Aerodactyl is faster than Tornadus and Thundurus and can OHKO both with a Rock Gem-boosted Rock Slide, and they can't use Charti Berry to do anything about it either. Aerial Ace provides more coverage; it's most useful against Fighting-types that resist Rock Slide. It is incredibly weak at 60 BP, but it can still do heavy damage with STAB, especially when it is super effective. Tailwind provides incredibly helpful support for the team, and Aerodactyl is also fairly good at setting it up due to its high Speed. It isn't as much of a sure thing as Prankster Tailwind, but it is pretty much as close as you can get. If you are worried about your opponents setting up, you can run Taunt instead, but with priority setup and Mental Herb, Taunt is not as reliable as it used to be. Protect is as useful as always to scout your opponents' move, stall out set-up moves, such as Trick Room, and shield Aerodactyl from a threat while its partner finishes off that particular foe. Protect is even more useful on Aerodactyl when considering the fact that it will assure another turn in which your partner will be able to hit through berries. Again, Taunt can be run over Protect if you really want both it and Tailwind, but Protect is usually the better option.</p> <p>Focus Sash is the first choice of item to keep Aerodactyl alive for longer, and with Aerodactyl's frailty and many common weaknesses, you will find it will activate often. The longer Aerodactyl is alive, the longer you will be able to hit through your opponents' berries, and so, even if Aerodactyl doesn't do much with its extra bit of life, its partner can. Rock Gem is another option if Focus Sash is being used by one of your other Pokemon, as it allows Aerodactyl to do more reasonable damage itself, instead of relying on its partner to do the damage. Without Rock Gem, Aerodactyl can't OHKO Tornadus, Thundurus, Chandelure, or much else. Still, Focus Sash is most useful if you can possibly afford to put it on Aerodactyl. Speed is maxed because it is Aerodactyl's greatest asset other than Unnerve, and putting EVs anywhere else really isn't worth it. The remaining EVs are invested in Attack, allowing Aerodactyl to at least deal a significant amount of damage to its opponents.</p> <p>Aerodactyl's best teammates are the things it supports best, which are Pokemon that tear into threats deprived of the effect of their resistance berries. Mamoswine is one of the most effective partners for Aerodactyl. It will greatly appreciate not having to worry about Yache Berries when trying to Ice Shard threats weak to it, such as Garchomp, and fewer Pokemon will be able to dodge a KO from Earthquake without Shuca Berry. Aerodactyl is also immune to Earthquake, meaning Mamoswine can spam it freely. Mamoswine will also appreciate Tailwind support because of its only average Speed. Any of the rest of the multitude of Pokemon that are often limited by resistance berries will also appreciate Aerodactyl's support, but it is important to consider whether Persian or Aerodactyl is a better fit to provide Unnerve support. Smeargle and Amoonguss also get special mentions because Unnerve allows them to use Spore with impunity, not having to worry about Lum Berries.</p>"

  "Snorlax": {
    "overview": "<p>Snorlax instantly appeals as a powerful defensive Pokemon, boasting 160 / 65 / 110 defenses. However, a weakness to Fighting and low physical bulk leave Snorlax easy prey to the common Fighting-type attacks in VGC. Do not fear, though; Snorlax has access to many hard-hitting physical moves and a useful ability in Thick Fat. Snorlax also has an extremely low base 30 Speed; while this might seem to be a terrible weakness, it can be taken advantage of through Trick Room. Remember to play to Snorlax's strengths, and you will find it tearing up your opponents in no time.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Superpower is a solid option for scoring some KOs against most Steel- and Rock-types, as well as opposing Snorlax that don't invest heavily in Defense. Sitrus Berry could be a viable item for gaining instant recovery after taking some hits or getting HP back after Belly Drum. Although setting up in VGC can be dangerous, if you can predict your opponent double Protecting to stall out Trick Room, Snorlax can use Belly Drum and go in for a KO on the next turn. Selfdestruct is a very powerful STAB move, and when boosted by a Normal Gem, it will almost always guarantee a KO on Pokemon that don't resist it, have an immunity to it, or use Protect. Body Slam can be used as a good STAB in place of Return, and the possibility of paralysis can be useful. Chesto Berry can be used with Rest, letting Snorlax regain full health mid-game and survive longer.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fighting-types are among the most common Pokemon in VGC 2012. This can be a huge problem for Snorlax, as they stop its sweep short and outright destroy it with their super effective STAB moves. Chople Berry Tyranitar is a threat as well, especially if it carries Low Kick or Superpower, as the best Snorlax can throw at it is Superpower. Metagross is also often problematic, even with Earthquake and Trick Room up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set is intended for use under Trick Room, where Snorlax can outspeed and tear through most frail opponents. Return is one of Snorlax's strongest STABs, while Earthquake deals solid damage to Steel-types that resist Return. However, as it is also a spread move, be careful not to hurt teammates when using it. Crunch helps Snorlax defeat common Ghost- and Psychic-type threats such as Cresselia and Jellicent, who, thanks to access to Trick Room, tend to be nightmares for any Trick Room team. Fire Punch can be useful against hail teams, and helps Snorlax defeat opponents that resist or are immune to its other attacks, such as Bronzong. Protect is used in the fourth slot as a multipurpose move; it can allow Snorlax to stall to some extent, aid against Fake Out users, and scout.</p> <p>The item here comes down to personal preference; however, here are some useful calculations, showing common instances where Chople Berry is useful with the given EV spread:</p> <ul> <li>252 Atk Hitmontop Close Combat 49% - 58%</li> <li>252 Atk Fighting Gem Hitmontop Close Combat 74% - 87%</li> <li>252 Atk Terrakion Close Combat 55% - 65%</li> <li>252 Atk Fighting Gem Terrakion Close Combat 83% - 98%</li> </ul> <p>Chople Berry is definitely an excellent choice, letting Snorlax survive almost anything Terrakion can throw at it. The given EVs are fairly straightforward: maximum Attack investment lets Snorlax hit as hard as possible, and the rest go into optimizing its bulk. Snorlax's HP stat is large and needs little investment, the Defense EVs and the Chople Berry help Snorlax take some Fighting-type attacks, while the Special Defense EVs cushion special blows, such as a Thunderbolt from Zapdos or Thundurus. A Brave nature maximizes Snorlax's Attack stat while lowering its Speed; in conjunction with 0 Speed IVs, Snorlax becomes as fast in Trick Room as possible. Snorlax's ability also comes down to preference. Thick Fat gives Snorlax resistances to Fire- and Ice-type attacks, such as Heat Wave and Blizzard, whilst Immunity stops Snorlax from becoming poisoned. Thick Fat is usually the superior option, but one must still watch out for the occasional burn or freeze.</p> <p>Pokemon with the Telepathy ability, such as Musharna, make decent partners for Snorlax, as they allow it to fire off moves such as Earthquake and Selfdestruct without worry of hurting its partner. In fact, Psychic-type Pokemon in general make excellent partners for Snorlax: Reuniclus, Musharna, and Cresselia can all set up Trick Room, which is a must for it to function properly, as well as take out annoying Fighting-types with super effective STAB attacks. Additionally, Cresselia and Musharna can provide Helping Hand support for Snorlax, while Reuniclus can help Snorlax take down the opponent's team once Trick Room is up. While Ghost-type Pokemon are able to switch in on Fighting-type moves that could potentially KO Snorlax, most Ghost-types that can provide Helping Hand + Trick Room support have a tough time taking out Fighting-types, making Psychic-types better suited for this role. Follow Me and Rage Powder users are nice teammates to have too, as they can absorb strong Fighting-type blows that could potentially KO Snorlax. Capable users of these moves include Amoonguss, Parasect, and Togekiss.</p>"

  "Dragonite": {
    "overview": "<p>In previous years, Dragonite was known as one of the weaker Dragon-types largely outclassed by its fellow Dragon-types, particularly Flygon and Garchomp, which were both faster. But now, thanks to its new ability, Multiscale, Dragonite's bulk has greatly increased, allowing it to hit hard before getting KOed. However, with its 4x weakness to Ice-type moves, the original dragon might have a hard time taking Blizzards, even with the help of Multiscale.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragonite can also run a Trick Room set; the only change required would be to put the Speed EVs into HP and to use a Brave or Quiet nature. An unmentioned but viable attack to use is Earthquake, though Rock Slide is generally a better spread attack as it won't damage your partner. Brick Break is another option as it has good coverage with Dragon Claw, and can also break the rare Light Screen and Reflect. Roost could be chosen over Protect to renew Multiscale and restore health, but Protect is generally the preferred option in VGC. Dragonite can run the Inner Focus ability to prevent flinching from Fake Out, a move commonly used on Dragonite to break Multiscale. The extra turn could allow Dragonite to either attack or set up Tailwind.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As stated before, Latios and Abomasnow can counter Dragonite quite well. Abomasnow summons hail, which breaks Multiscale, making Yache Berry the only way to thwart Abomasnow. Similarly, Tyranitar conjures a sandstorm, and Rock Slide severely dents Dragonite once Multiscale is gone. Fake Out users, such as Hitmontop, can help break Multiscale, but they must be wary of the rare Inner Focus Dragonite that could use that turn to its advantage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This is the standard Dragonite set. Dragon Claw is Dragonite's main move, as it gets the STAB boost and is only resisted by Steel-types. Fire Punch provides nice coverage along with Dragon Claw, hitting Abomasnow and Steel-types for super effective damage. However, it should be noted that despite being super effective, Fire Punch won't do over 50% to max HP Metagross. Extreme Speed will allow Dragonite to strike first, moving even before all other priority attacks bar Fake Out. Protect is a staple for most Pokemon in VGC, and can also be used in sync with Leftovers to help restore HP each turn.</p> <p>The 204 HP EVs allow Dragonite to always survive Life Orb Latios's Draco Meteor, and also gives it maximum Leftovers recovery and good bulk. The 52 Speed EVs let Dragonite outrun minimum speed Rotom-A. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack. An Adamant nature allows Dragonite to deal as much damage as possible, while Leftovers is used to restore some HP each turn, which might allow multiple usage of Multiscale. Haban Berry, however, lets Dragonite survive a Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor, which it cannot do with just Multiscale.</p> <p>As for teammates, Ground-types such as Krookodile can work well as Dragonite is immune to their Earthquake. Scrafty is a handy partner as it has Fake Out to help Dragonite preserve Multiscale for a turn. Its STAB attacks are also super effective against Abomasnow and Latios, Dragonite's two main counters. Either Politoed or Ninetales can also be used to get rid of opposing sandstorm and hail if needed, as both of these weathers will break Dragonite's Multiscale.</p>"
      },
      "Special Rain Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Dragonite has a good Special Attack stat, so a specially offensive set should not be underestimated. Draco Meteor is a strong Dragon-type STAB attack, but has the unfortunate side effect of halving Dragonite's special attack after use, so Dragon Pulse can be a good alternative. Hurricane gets the STAB bonus too, and has perfect accuracy in the rain. Thunder can be used on a rain team, and can also be a good option outside of rain. Flamethrower gets good coverage with Dragonite's primary STAB, but will be weakened by rain if Dragonite is on a rain team. Protect is almost a necessity in VGC, and should be used on almost everything in it.</p> <p>The EV spread is the same as the physical attacker set—the HP EVs guarantee Dragonite will survive Life Orb Latios's Draco Meteor, while the Speed EVs let it outpace uninvested Rotom-A—except the Attack EVs are moved to Special Attack instead and a Modest nature is used. As for item choice, Dragon Gem is useful for powering up Dragonite's Dragon-type attack, while the Haban Berry can help against opposing Dragon-types, most notably Dragon Gem Latios.</p> <p>As this is a weather-oriented set, Politoed gets first mention. In the rain, Thunder and Hurricane both have perfect accuracy, and with their 120 Base Power, they will do massive amounts of damage. Other partners include Earthquake users, Fake Out users, and Pokemon that can counter Dragonite's checks, such as Krookodile, Hitmontop, and Scrafty, respectively.</p>"

  "Crobat": {
    "overview": "<p>Crobat might not see much use in VGC when compared to standard threats such as Metagross, but this does not mean it isn't worth using. It actually finds itself able to handle utility Fake Out users, such as Hitmontop and Mienshao, pretty well with its access to Inner Focus and a powerful STAB, Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics. Crobat is also one of the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the tier with its amazing base 130 Speed. All in all, Crobat is certainly a Pokemon who can tear through the opposition if used properly, but one wrong choice will easily make it dead weight.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Crobat can run Brave Bird to OHKO threats such as Latios and Gengar, who can survive Acrobatics and KO back, but it will take a huge amount of recoil. An Adamant nature is also an option, particularly with Brave Bird. U-turn might seem like a good idea to get a free switch-in and scout the opponent, but with Crobat's high Speed, the switch-in must be able to sponge attacks directed at Crobat. Crobat's excellent special movepool might make a special attacking set appear viable, but with its poor base 70 Special Attack, this is obviously a bad idea. It also has access to alternative physical coverage options in X-Scissor, Cross Poison, and Zen Headbutt, though an all-out attacking set is outclassed by more powerful Flying-types given Crobat's merely average base 90 Attack stat. Running Heat Wave with a Rash nature is also an option, as this allows Crobat to deal heavy damage to Steel-type checks such as Metagross and Scizor. Crobat can also take advantage of its high Speed and run Hypnosis, but its accuracy makes it highly unreliable. Infiltrator allows Crobat to hit through dual screens and inflict status through Safeguard, but the loss of Inner Focus will make it vulnerable to Fake Out. Lastly, with its high Speed, Crobat can run Fly to dodge all damage for a turn and allow its partner to take out a threat, but it will be highly vulnerable the next turn; such a strategy is also extremely predictable, and the opponent can either get what is basically a free switch in or use Protect to absorb the damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Crobat doesn't have the worst defenses for taking hits, but being weak to several common types doesn't help its cause in any way. Zapdos means trouble for Crobat, walling its main STAB move and dealing heavy damage back with Thunderbolt; the same goes for most other Electric-types. Terrakion doesn't mind taking a Super Fang as it is primarily a frail attacker and can easily KO in return with STAB Rock Slide. Priority moves such as Sucker Punch and ExtremeSpeed will circumvent Crobat's high Speed, preventing it from wreaking havoc. Trick Room can turn Crobat's monstrous Speed against it by turning it into the slowest Pokemon on the field. Common Pokemon with Prankster, including Murkrow and Thundurus, can cripple Crobat with Thunder Wave before it can even move, rendering it virtually useless for the rest of the match.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Anti-Lead": {
        "description": "<p>With the prevalence of Fighting-type Pokemon in VGC 2012, STAB Acrobatics is an amazing move to have, hitting strong physical attackers such as Scrafty, Hitmontop, and Hariyama very hard. For the Pokemon that resist Acrobatics, namely Steel-types such as Metagross and Bronzong, Super Fang can be used to strip off half of their health, the only downside being its inability to hit Ghost-types. Tailwind is a great support move to help teammates outspeed fast threats such as Latios and Tornadus, and Crobat can easily set it up with its excellent Speed. Taunt can be used as an alternative to stop Trick Room and Tailwind from being set up, and can even prevent the use of Protect and Substitute. Protect is standard, helping Crobat shield itself from powerful attacks from the likes of Latios and Terrakion while Crobat's partner deals with these threats.</p> <p>Flying Gem gives a one-time boost to Acrobatics, ensuring that you can get in at least one hard hit with Crobat. The EV spread simply maximizes Crobat's Attack and Speed so that it can hit as hard and fast as possible, while a Jolly nature lets Crobat outspeed almost every unboosted Pokemon in VGC, as well as Speed tie with Aerodactyl and Jolteon. An alternative EV spread of 36 HP / 252 Atk / 220 Spe can be used to give Crobat slightly more bulk and still outspeed all unboosted Pokemon except Aerodactyl, Jolteon, and other Crobat. Inner Focus is the ability of choice to help deal with Fake Out users such as Hitmontop and Mienshao, who can otherwise create openings for their team to attack with a guaranteed flinch.</p> <p>Crobat, being able to handle Fake Out users itself, actually pairs well with fast Fake Out users such as Ambipom and Mienshao, who can clear out offensive threats for it with one move. Mienshao can be especially handy due to its access to Wide Guard to block spread moves such as Discharge and Rock Slide. Pokemon who are often outsped by fast threats such as Garchomp and Latios can make great teammates if Crobat runs Tailwind, as it helps them to outspeed and OHKO these threats. Crobat can also fit into a rain team pretty well, as its weaknesses are covered by common rain boosted Pokemon such as Ludicolo and Scizor. Terrakion is a good partner who can take advantage of the Tailwind set up by Crobat to spam Rock Slide and Earthquake. Speaking of Earthquake, Crobat pairs well with Earthquake users such as Garchomp and Mamoswine. Hitmontop also makes a good partner, as it can support Crobat well with Intimidate, Fake Out, and Wide Guard, while nailing troublesome Ghost- and Psychic-types with Sucker Punch.</p>"

  "Lanturn": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Lanturn appears to be outclassed by Rotom-W, who is faster, stronger, and slightly bulkier than Lanturn; however, it has a few tricks up its sleeve that allow it to carve a niche for itself in the metagame. In particular, Lanturn has access to Blizzard and Surf, moves that Rotom-W can only dream of having. In addition, it has two good abilities in Water Absorb and Volt Absorb. These qualities make Lanturn a fantastic counter to both hail and rain teams, a nearly unique quality.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aside from the listed options, Lanturn has a few other things in its arsenal. Confuse Ray, when combined with Thunder Wave, has a very good chance of preventing an opponent from attacking. However, the opponent can simply switch or double target Lanturn's partner, as Lanturn does not pose much of an offensive presence. Scald can burn opponents and hits harder than Surf, which hits both opponents, but Hydro Pump is usually better. Volt Switch is a nifty move to scout the opponent's switches. Heal Bell can cure Lanturn's team of status, but Lanturn will be hard-pressed to find a turn to use it. Icy Wind slows down both foes, although Thunder Wave serves a similar purpose. Signal Beam hits Ludicolo and Abomasnow super effectively, while Hidden Power Fire hits Abomasnow even harder. Lastly, Shuca Berry or Air Balloon can be used to alleviate Lanturn's Ground-type weakness, but Rindo Berry is usually better due to Ground-type moves being rare on rain and hail teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Earthquake users will destroy Lanturn, unless it is carrying Shuca Berry or Air Balloon. Tyranitar and Ninetales change the weather from Lanturn's preferred rain or hail, and can put the hurt on it with Rock Slide or SolarBeam respectively. Grass-type moves, especially after Rindo Berry has been consumed, will do a large amount of damage to Lanturn. Ferrothorn completely walls Lanturn aside from a stray Hidden Power Fire, and can retaliate with a powerful Power Whip. Gastrodon also walls Lanturn, and can hit it super effectively with a STAB Earth Power. In general, Lanturn's mediocre stats make it fairly useless against teams that are neither rain nor hail.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Anti-Weather": {
        "description": "<p>This set combines all of Lanturn's best qualities to create a set that can defeat most rain and hail teams. Against the former, Lanturn walls all common rain sweepers bar Ludicolo, while against the latter, Lanturn resists Blizzard and is only threatened by Abomasnow. Thunder gains perfect accuracy in rain, and hits Politoed and rain sweepers, such as Kabutops and Kingdra, hard. It is also Lanturn's most powerful STAB attack. Surf sets Lanturn apart from Rotom-W, being an accurate STAB move that hits both opponents. However, be aware that Surf will hit Lanturn's partner as well, so either use Protect or partner Lanturn with a Pokemon that resists, is immune to, or benefits from Water-type moves. Blizzard is a move that hits both opponents, and also hits Pokemon found on hail teams hard. However, since most hail teams have Pokemon that resist Blizzard, such as Ice- or Water-types, Thunder Wave can be used instead to cripple sweepers on all teams. Protect is standard on many Pokemon in the metagame, as it can scout, avoid a partner's attack, and avoid damage from Fake Out.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Lanturn's Special Attack and HP. A Modest nature is used to give Lanturn more power, as its Special Attack is average at best. Water Absorb lets Lanturn wall rain teams, but Volt Absorb can be used if your team uses Discharge. Hydro Pump is an option over Surf if Lanturn's partner does not want to be taking damage, although Surf differentiates Lanturn from Rotom-W and is a more useful move overall.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, Lanturn needs Ludicolo and Abomasnow removed in order to do its job properly. Both of these Pokemon are weak to Bug-type moves, so Scizor is a fantastic partner for Lanturn. It can use its STAB Bug Bite to easily dispose of Grass-types, and also appreciates Lanturn's paralysis support. Speaking of paralysis, slow Pokemon greatly enjoy the Speed drops caused by it. Metagross is one example—it can even take out Abomasnow for Lanturn. An Abomasnow of your own can be helpful, as it allows Lanturn to use Blizzard reliably. It even resists Surf, allowing Lanturn to use the move more often.</p>"

  "Politoed": {
    "overview": "<p>When the VGC 2012 ruleset was announced, it didn't take long for Politoed to take hold of the metagame. With an entourage of Swift Swim Pokemon capable of utilizing Drizzle—that range from the humble Anorith to the mighty Kingdra,—Politoed is never in shortage of teammates to occupy vacant team slots. Politoed isn't just good for Drizzle, however, as it can deal major damage to anything without a resistance or high Special Defense with its STAB, rain-boosted Water moves, or support its team using moves such as Helping Hand and Icy Wind.</p> <p>Politoed doesn't really have many issues either, besides the obvious weaknesses to Grass- and Electric-type attacks, such as those from Thundurus and Breloom. The only things that really trouble it are other weather changers, such as Abomasnow, Tyranitar, and Ninetales. Luckily, Politoed can surround itself with Pokemon that have great defensive synergy, allowing it to switch in and out to reinstate weather if need be, as well as having a good matchup type-wise against two-thirds of the other weather changers. Because of its versatility, power, and workable bulk, Politoed won't be budging from its top 10 position anytime soon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Haze, Toxic, Hypnosis, Rain Dance, Mud Shot, and Swagger make up the lesser-used support side of Politoed's movepool. Haze can be useful to erase Kingdra's Special Attack drop after a Draco Meteor, as well as any Intimidate drops, but seeing as you could just as easily switch to remove the effects, it isn't worth the moveslot. Toxic can easily beat non-Resting Cresselia, but the effects of poison can sometimes prove to be too slow for the fast-paced VGC metagame. Hypnosis would be a great move to capitalize on the lack of Sleep Clause if it didn't have an awful 60% accuracy, but it can be a nice option on defensive sets should Politoed find itself twiddling its thumbs instead of providing meaningful support. Swagger can power up Pokemon such as Kabutops and Metagross while also potentially disrupting the opponent, but Politoed's partners are typically faster than it is, and as such, a Swagger boost is slower than a Helping Hand boost. Rain Dance might seem odd on something with an auto-weather ability, but can come in handy against Abomasnow and Tyranitar, as they are slower and therefore get the weather advantage should they and Politoed be sent out at the same time. Theoretically, Mud Shot hits Electric-types super effectively as well as having the same Speed drop as Icy Wind, but is in reality less useful than Icy Wind as firstly, the most common Electric-types are either Flying or Levitating, and secondly, it only affects one Pokemon.</p> <p>Iron Ball could be used to gain the weather advantage over Abomasnow and Tyranitar, but being slower than the two subjects Politoed to Rock Slide or Giga Drain while it cannot recover from either attack without a partner using Heal Pulse or Trick in conjunction with its own Sitrus Berry. A Choice Scarf can be used like Choice Specs, but Politoed is in general too weak to make use of the Choice Scarf and requires Speed investment, which cuts into its bulk. Leftovers should really only be considered as an alternative to Sitrus Berry in the case of Item Clause, though this isn't to say that it's a terrible item; it simply isn't as fast as Sitrus Berry, which heals four times as much as Leftovers in a single turn. Lastly, Psychic could be useful to combat Fighting-types and Amoonguss, but both are hit just as hard by Hydro Pump and Ice Beam, respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Politoed's checks and counters are fairly straightforward. Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, Rotom-C, Zapdos, Abomasnow, and Toxicroak are but a few, though Politoed is probably going to be played conservatively until your opponent is absolutely sure you aren't going to change the weather. A surprise Sunny Day, Hail, or Sandstorm is a great way to take advantage of this, though you have to be careful about repeated Hydro Pumps from Politoed's teammates. To expound on the mentioned counters, Ferrothorn takes absolutely nothing from any Politoed assault bar a Scald burn, and is a general nuisance to rain teams. Rotom-W, Rotom-C, and Zapdos electrocute Politoed with their STAB Thunderbolts or Thunders while Politoed cannot OHKO them back. Abomasnow, a weather inducer itself, is Politoed's natural enemy, and the best Politoed can do to it is a neutral Ice Beam. With Drain Punch and Dry Skin healing, Toxicroak walls any Politoed if it doesn't get frozen, which is a real possibility if you let the match drag on too long. Opposing rain teams pack their own Ludicolo and Thunder users who of course can make frog leg stew out of Politoed in a heartbeat, though mirror matches generally lead to mind games of who's going to bring their Politoed. Amoonguss might be weak to Ice Beam, but it can definitely take one or two hits, Spore Politoed, and heal off the damage with Giga Drain. BW2 brought Thundurus-T to deal with Politoed, and it can usually succeed in doing so as long as it is equipped with either an Electric Gem or Choice Specs, and Politoed isn't equipped with a Wacan Berry. Virizion doesn't mind Ice Beams as much as it does Scald burns, and can 2HKO Politoed with Leaf Blade or use Sunny Day to weaken its partners.</p>",

      "Rain Support": {
        "description": "<p>Like a lot of Pokemon in today's metagame, this set aims to be both bulky and offensive while also capitalizing on Politoed's great support moves. Icy Wind and Helping Hand form the backbone of Politoed's supportive side by helping its teammates outspeed dangerous opponents and getting the OHKOs that they desire. Ice Beam is more powerful and can nab just enough damage on Pokemon such as bulky Thundurus for better follow-throughs such as Hidden Power Ice or Draco Meteor. Encore is tricky to use, but is highly rewarding, especially when paired with Icy Wind. The trick is to use Icy Wind on Pokemon that will most likely Protect later, and when they become slower, you can lock them into Protect when they do slip up. Another perk to this is that you can punish faster Pokemon that use Trick Room in hopes of outspeeding your Swift Swimmers, forcing them to reverse their own Trick Room.</p> <p>Water Gem should only be used in conjunction with Hydro Pump. The reason for this is that with said Gem, Hydro Pump is able to score quick KOs on numerous Pokemon, such as Thundurus-T, Metagross, and Hitmontop, as well as severely damage anything else that doesn't resist it, such as bulky Thundurus and even Cresselia. Sitrus Berry is the next best thing if you're not interested in such power, or if you're using Scald. With a Sitrus Berry, Politoed can bounce back from an unboosted Thunderbolt (Pokemon such as Rotom-A and Thundurus-T can't OHKO without a boosting item) and continue to spew Icy Winds and Helping Hands all over the field, or simply have enough HP to last another switch. Protect is a staple on Politoed because of the attention it draws, especially when it's involved in a weather war with its all-time rivals, Abomasnow and Tyranitar.</p> <p>Other viable options to consider are Surf, Hidden Power Grass, and Wacan Berry. Surf is great for spread damage, but shouldn't be used unless you have a partner Pokemon that has Telepathy, Water Absorb, Storm Drain or a partner Pokemon that doubly resists it, as Surf is very powerful in the rain. Hidden Power Grass is really only good for Gastrodon and Rotom-W, but it can come in handy if your team lacks a Grass-type to deal with them. If you're worried about Choice Specs Thundurus-T or Electric Gem Rotom-A, Wacan Berry is a great item, although Politoed generally appreciates the power of Water Gem or Sitrus Berry's healing effect.</p> <p>The first Pokemon that springs to mind for a great partner for Politoed is Kingdra. A Life Orb and Helping Hand boosted Draco Meteor is one of the most dangerous attacks in the game, and is quickly becoming the next big attack to EV against, as it OHKOes common rain checks such as Thundurus. Additionally, it so happens that Kingdra can learn Disable, allowing Politoed and Kingdra to KO bulkier opponents such as Cresselia or bypass the normally threatening Shedinja by causing them to prematurely Struggle as Encore locks the opponent into a move that is Disabled. The downside to this is that Kingdra cannot learn both Muddy Water and Disable at the same time, but Hydro Pump is certainly a viable alternative. Ludicolo can take advantage of Surf Politoed with Absorb Bulb and Fake Out the opposition, as well as being able to comfortably check Gastrodon and Rotom-W, both of which are big threats to rain teams. Other Swift Swim users such as Kabutops, Armaldo, and Beartic are good contenders for the role of Politoed's teammates, as they are all capable of dealing with bothersome Pokemon such as Thundurus. The downside to these Pokemon are that they are vulnerable to Intimidate, don't have particularly useful moves outside of their STABs, and (mostly) don't have STAB Water moves to use.</p> <p>Grass- and Electric-type attacks plague Politoed and its buddies, so naturally, it would be a good idea to pack a Pokemon that can switch into such moves. Thundurus-T is an excellent option in this regard because its typing gives it a Grass resistance, while Volt Absorb allows it to freely switch into the horrible Thunderbolts aimed at Politoed; conversely, Politoed can switch into Ice Beams aimed at Thundurus. In a similar vein, Landorus-T can switch into Thunderbolts and weakens the more common offensive Grass-types (Breloom and Virizion) with Intimidate, though having to Protect whenever it uses Earthquake is a downside. Rotom-W can stomach Grass Knots and has a powerful STAB Hydro Pump to make use of Drizzle, but has a hard time switching into multiple Thunderbolts. Pokemon weak to Fire-type moves love to get soaked with rain; the most viable are Amoonguss, Scizor, and Metagross. Amoonguss is great against other rain teams and can keep Thunderbolts off of Politoed with Rage Powder, and after one or two Icy Winds, Amoonguss is all set to Spore everything in front of it. Both Scizor and Metagross serve largely the same role: to destroy Abomasnow and Tyranitar. While Abomasnow immediately recoils at the prospect of either Steel-type's STAB moves, Tyranitar may try to get smart with them and throw a Fire Punch their way, which obviously won't work because of their newfound neutrality (in Scizor's case, only a 2x weakness).</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Rain Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set's aim is to simply not die. While it certainly isn't going to be leaving any smarts, it can take moves such as Fighting Gem Close Combat from Terrakion and Modest Hydreigon's Dragon Gem Draco Meteor much more comfortably than a more offensive set can. As such, this set is better for people who think Politoed should be saving its own skin and preserving the rain rather than joining the fray and getting fried. Scald and Icy Wind are excellent supportive moves as they can't be Taunted, and Protect does as advertised, which is all the more important on a defensive set such as this.</p> <p>Because of Politoed's newfound bulk, the third moveslot is going to be all the more useful. Helping Hand is first on the list as it is easy to use and instantly rewards you with OHKOs that would previously be impossible. Encore is as useful as ever to lock your opponent into undesirable moves and causes them to make risky plays. Perish Song is a more deadly move because Politoed isn't easily 2HKOed between Protects, which allows it to become your opponent's worst nightmare. However, this requires at least one Pokemon to be KOed and for you to have at least one of your own Pokemon still intact to negate the drawback. In the right hands however, Perish Song is an incredibly dangerous attack that can instantly force your opponent into a checkmate position, should the score be something like 2-3 in your favor.</p> <p>A Sitrus Berry is preferred as Politoed lacks recovery outside of Rest, but a Wacan Berry is useful to survive a deadly Thunderbolt, especially when Politoed is busy setting up Perish Song. Leftovers combos well with Protect, though it is only as useful as Sitrus Berry if Politoed receives four turns of its effect.</p> <p>The partners for this set are largely the same as the first rain support set (Swift Swim users and switch-ins to Grass- and Electric-type attacks), although said partners are expected to be more offensive to pick up Politoed's slack. Shadow Tag Gothitelle pairs well with Perish Song Politoed for obvious reasons, as with Gothitelle's support, Politoed can instantly turn the game into 4-2 in your favor. However, since the combo relies on Gothitelle staying behind Protect and Politoed actually setting up Perish Song, Feint or Taunt can easily bring the two to their knees, so it is prudent that you pay attention to the Team Preview and wait for just the right team to take advantage of.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>If you can appreciate the power of Water Gem Hydro Pump and how often Politoed switches in and out, then Choice Specs Politoed provides all the firepower a little frog could ever ask for. With Hydro Pump OHKOing everything within the grey area of bulk in which Hitmontop and Metagross reside, and 2HKOing just about everything else, all of the other moves are mostly filler. Ice Beam OHKOes 4/0 Thundurus and Tornadus and deals around 87% to Latios. Hidden Power Grass comes as a surprise to incoming Gastrodon that think they can soak up a Scald or at the very least be lightly touched by Icy Wind, but doesn't have much use besides that as 252/0 Rotom-W only takes about 60% from it. Scald is weaker than Hydro Pump, but comes in handy when you need a powerful Water-type move that won't miss. As a small bonus, Scald can even ward off freeze hax, most notably from Abomasnow as Politoed switches in.</p> <p>Surf and Focus Blast are the only other real options for this set. Surf hurts your partners even more than usual, so it's best to either build your team around it or be prepared to Protect when Politoed Surfs. Focus Blast is great for Ferrothorn, but that's really the only notable Pokemon it can hurt more than Hydro Pump does, and even then it only has 70% accuracy with no way to boost it.</p> <p>Again, Swift Swim users have a love affair with Drizzle, but more importantly, Choice Specs Politoed needs solid switch-ins. Thundurus-T takes the forefront once again, as it resists Grass-type moves and is completely immune to Thunderbolts, though it has to give up its Choice Specs for Politoed to wear them. In a similar yet more obscure way, Lightning Rod Raichu can lead away Thunderbolts and provide Fake Out support, as well as Feint and Thunder Wave support to set up faster Pokemon and Protecting Pokemon for surprise Hydro Pump KOs. Amoonguss can lead away Thunderbolts and completely neuter any Ferrothorn lacking Thunder Wave or Iron Head, and gains the benefit of weakened Fire-type moves and Politoed's ability to OHKO Amoonguss's mortal enemy, Metagross. Trick Room is also appreciated, but should not be used together with Swift Swim Pokemon.</p>"

  "Murkrow": {
    "overview": "<p>Here in VGC, Murkrow finds a great niche with the Prankster ability, which only 6 other Pokemon get. Murkrow really stands out from the others, with its typing and movepool giving it advantages over other Prankster users. With the support moves it has, Murkrow has amazing potential to fit on nearly any team. However, Murkrow is not without its drawbacks. It has 60 / 42 / 42 defenses, meaning even with as much invested bulk as possible and an Eviolite, it won't be able to take many hits from the opposition. Its weaknesses to common spread moves in VGC, such as Discharge, Rock Slide, and Blizzard, can be a thorn in your side. This is no big problem though, as the benefits Prankster provides easily outweigh these downsides. Murkrow may seem a somewhat odd Pokemon, but when used correctly, it can wreak havoc upon the opposing team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>For a special attacking option, you can run Snarl. While you lose priority in doing so, it allows Murkrow to mess with opposing special attackers. Confuse Ray is a decent choice if you feel lucky enough to use it. Perish Song is a cool option to force switches, but VGC battles are very fast-paced, making this less of an option than in standard play. Roost is another option, but Murkrow is very frail and might not be able to make much use of extra health. Focus Sash is also an option to help Murkrow with its frailty issues, but it might limit options for items on other team members, so Eviolite is usually better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Murkrow is weak to many common spread moves, such as Rock Slide, Discharge, and Blizzard. Special attackers are good checks to Murkrow due to the fact that many aren't bothered by the tools Murkrow uses. Additionally, despite packing FeatherDance, Murkrow will likely still fall to powerful STAB Rock Slide from Pokemon such as Terrakion and Tyranitar. White Herb is quite annoying for Murkrow because it removes the Attack drop from FeatherDance. This causes Murkrow to waste a turn, which can cost the match in VGC. Finally, due to Clear Body, Murkrow can't do much to Metagross.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Prankster": {
        "description": "<p>Murkrow has all the right tools it needs to abuse Prankster to its fullest. Quash forces attacks such as Rock Slide and Earthquake to move last, and Murkrow is the only Prankster user to receive access to this excellent move. FeatherDance, essentially a double Intimidate, is another unique tool, lowering your opponents Attack stat by two stages. The third move can be a tough choice: Thunder Wave is very useful to cripple sweepers and prevent common speedy threats from sweeping your team, but Tailwind virtually guarantees that your team is faster than your opponent's, giving you a nice sweeping opportunity. The last move is also preferential. Protect is a staple in VGC play because it is useful on nearly anything; Protect enables Murkrow to avoid damage for a turn or Protect itself when the opponent might double target it while Murkrow's partner goes in for the KO. Taunt allows Murkrow to prevent Trick Room from being set up, ruins Amoonguss's attempts to Spore, and so on. Furthermore, Murkrow is one of the few Pokemon able to outspeed and Taunt Prankster Sableye.</p> <p>The EVs and nature give Murkrow as much special bulk as possible, because most of the time, Murkrow has FeatherDance to stop physical threats from doing much damage to it. Prankster is one of the only reasons to use Murkrow, and is therefore the obvious choice. Sucker Punch or Brave Bird can be put into the set for attacking options; just change the nature from Calm to Careful. However, do note that Brave Bird's recoil can take a toll on Murkrow's longevity.</p> <p>Steel-types, such as Metagross and Bisharp, can be useful to sponge powerful moves aimed at Murkrow. Most special attacking Trick Room Pokemon pose a threat to Murkrow, as it doesn't have many moves that can hurt them much. Some good teammates to sponge moves from these threats would include Cresselia, Bronzong, or bulky Hitmontop. Murkrow has good synergy with Garchomp because Murkrow is immune to Earthquake, meaning Garchomp can easily fire away strong Earthquakes at will. Pokemon weak to physical attacks make good teammates to go with Murkrow, because it can support them with FeatherDance, granting its teammates many setup opportunities.</p>"

  "Slowking": {
    "overview": "<p>In the wake of a new metagame plagued with weather, Slowking emerges as the premier counter to such teams running rampant. With Trick Room and its atrocious Speed stat, Slowking can take advantage of the Speed boosts that many Pokemon gain from the weather to outrun most of its opponents. Furthermore, Slowking can often make use of the weather itself with its usable base 100 Special Attack stat and fantastic movepool. With its bulk and power, Slowking has the potential to make a huge splash in this metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Slowking's massive movepool gives it a plethora of other options to consider. Fire Blast can be run if you prefer raw power over accuracy. Mirror Coat is a rather gimmicky option, but can be viable due to Slowking's bulk and its tendency to attract Electric- and Ghost-type attacks, most of which are specially based. Slack Off provides Slowking with a reliable method of recovery, but it is largely redundant thanks to Regenerator. Slowking can also run a support set with options such as Yawn, Thunder Wave, and Light Screen, but it is better off attacking. Finally, Slowking has other attacking options in Grass Knot, Shadow Ball, and Icy Wind, which can be used instead of Trick Room if your team already has a Trick Room user.</p> <p>If Item Clause prevents Slowking from using the listed items, it can run Lum Berry to take Spore from Parasect and Amoonguss, Leftovers for steady recovery, or Wacan Berry to weaken the Electric-type moves that will inevitably come its way.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Your best option against Slowking is to hit it with Fake Out and go straight for the KO with a super effective move to stop it from setting up Trick Room. Electric-types such as Thundurus and Zapdos carry STAB Thunderbolt to faint Slowking; the former can also use Taunt to stop Trick Room. Ferrothorn also makes a great check, as it only fears the rare Fire-type move, outspeeds Slowking under Trick Room, and can OHKO with STAB Power Whip. Other Steel-type powerhouses, such as Scizor and Metagross, also fall in the same category as they only need to avoid Flamethrower and can dish out heavy damage, if not outright KO Slowking.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Slowking's bulk allows it to set up Trick Room with relative ease, and its good Special Attack stat and powerful STAB attacks enable it to immediately start pounding its opponents into the ground. Trick Room allows Slowking to utilize its very low Speed to become one of the fastest Pokemon on the field. Scald is Slowking's main Water-type STAB as it is boosted by the rain and has the potential to cripple physical attackers. If using Surf, it is advised to have a partner that benefits from Water-type moves, such as Ludicolo or Toxicroak, or that at least resists them.</p> <p>Psychic allows Slowking to take down Fighting-types such as Hariyama, Hitmontop, and Toxicroak, while also providing it with a strong secondary STAB move. To put this into perspective, Slowking's excellent bulk allows it to take a maximum of 62.9% from Adamant Toxicroak's Sucker Punch and 58.9% from the same move from Adamant Hitmontop, and KO in return with Psychic. Blizzard and Ice Beam are also options for the third moveslot; the former can be used on hail teams for a move that hits both opponents hard, while the latter gives Slowking an accurate Ice-type move in all other weather. Finally, Protect allows Slowking to guard itself against super effective attacks while its teammate takes out the threat. However, this leaves Slowking vulnerable to Steel-types such as Metagross, which are especially problematic to hail teams, so replacing Protect with Flamethrower might be a wiser option.</p> <p>With the ubiquity of priority Taunt users such as Whimsicott and Thundurus, it is no wonder that Mental Herb is the primary item option on this set, as it allows Slowking to set up Trick Room unhindered. However, Sitrus Berry can be used to extend Slowking's longevity in conjunction with Regenerator, which allows it to retreat from battle and switch back in when a future opportunity arises with an additional 33% health. This can enable Slowking to set up Trick Room once more or score one last hard hit before going down, and hence prove very useful.</p> <p>252 HP EVs increase Slowking's longevity on the field, allowing it to set up Trick Room with ease. Furthermore, with Regenerator healing 33% of Slowking's health each time it switches in, maximum investment in HP allows for greater recovery. 252 Special Attack EVs add more bite to Slowking's attacks, allowing it to take advantage of Trick Room. A Quiet nature, in conjunction with 0 Speed IVs, enables Slowking to outspeed a large proportion of the metagame under Trick Room, and further boosts its Special Attack.</p> <p>Slowking appreciates having teammates, Grass-types in particular, that can take advantage of Trick Room while still providing it with much-needed support. Ferrothorn has great defensive synergy with Slowking; it resists all of Slowking's weaknesses, while Slowking can deal with the Fire- and Fighting-types that KO Ferrothorn. Ferrothorn can also make great use of Trick Room with its awful base 20 Speed and powerful STAB Power Whip. Abomasnow is another good choice as it allows Slowking to make use of an accurate Blizzard, and still outspeeds most opponents under Trick Room. Hippowdon is immune to Electric-type moves, and also scuppers the plans of most weather teams.</p>"

  "Wobbuffet": {
    "overview": "<p>With only 8 moves, no access to Protect, and no way to attack an opponent directly, Wobbuffet is definitely a strange choice for VGC. Using Shadow Tag to cut off the opponent's ability to switch is Wobbuffet's primary function, providing an opportunity to use a few unconventional strategies.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Safeguard can be used to block Status moves. Destiny Bond can be used to deter attacks on Wobbuffet when it is at low HP, but its usage is rather situational. Splash provides Wobbuffet a move with a massive amount of PP, making the opponent more likely to start using Struggle first, but isn't viable due to the timer. Tickle is a decent support move that can be used instead of Charm, but it is extremely difficult to obtain for use in an actual event. Mental Herb can be used to cure Wobbuffet from Taunt, which would prevent it from using its supporting moves, while Lum Berry can be used to counteract Spore or Thunder Wave. Lastly, don't use Wobbuffet's Dream World ability, Telepathy, as it defeats the purpose of running a Wobbuffet.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The inability to switch out means that it is critical to start thinking about how to counter Wobbuffet right from the Team Preview screen. Getting caught without a strong offensive presence on the field can leave you in a dangerous spot in about 3 turns. Because Wobbuffet cannot learn Protect, throwing high power STAB moves, such as Draco Meteor, Meteor Mash, and Hydro Pump, at it will shorten its stay on the field, and returns your ability to switch out. With their extremely high power, Heracross and Escavalier can OHKO Wobbuffet with a Bug Gem-boosted Megahorn. Otherwise, other Bug-, Dark-, and Ghost-types, such as Hydreigon, Chandelure, and Scizor are good at disposing Wobbuffet quickly.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shadow Tag Support": {
        "description": "<p>As mentioned before, Wobbuffet lacks options for moves. Counter and Mirror Coat are used to score a KO or two with some prediction. Encore is used to lock an opponent into a single move, while Charm is used to reduce an opponent's Attack. Because Wobbuffet's ability prevents the opponent from switching, both Encore and Charm are more potent than they would be otherwise.</p> <p>Wobbuffet's EV spread provides a balanced amount of physical and special bulk. Even without HP investment, most strong attacks will still do more than enough damage to allow a lethal blow with Counter or Mirror Coat. Wobbuffet should run 0 IV in Speed and either a Relaxed or Sassy nature if it is on a Trick Room team. An alternate spread of 124 Def / 132 SpD / 252 Spe with a Timid nature can be used, allowing Wobbuffet to outrun uninvested base 70s and disrupt them with Encore. Wobbuffet holds a Sitrus Berry for extra longevity, but holding Leftovers or a type-resist Berry can work as well.</p> <p>The most interesting strategy for Wobbuffet in VGC is Perish Trapping. If attempting this, Perish Song users, such as Politoed, Azumarill, and Jigglypuff, along with bulky Pokemon, such as Chansey, Bronzong, and Cresselia, make effective partners to Wobbuffet by setting up Perish Song allowing Wobbuffet to buy time until the perish count reduces to zero. Another interesting—although harder to pull off—strategy is to use Skill Swap on Wobbuffet. By using Pokemon, such as Chansey and Cresselia, to Skill Swap for Shadow Tag, it can make it much more difficult for the opponent to remove the ability from play to allow themselves to switch out. Other strategies for Shadow Tag include partnering Wobbuffet with Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Salamence and Hitmontop, to shred the Attack of any physical attackers present, or with Pokemon with Disable, such as Kingdra, Alakazam, and Jigglypuff, to shut down a Pokemon completely after they have been hit with Encore from Wobbuffet.</p>"

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Granting it a total of ten resistances and only one weakness, Scizor's typing alone allows it to be an easy fit on most teams. Additionally, Scizor boasts one of the most powerful priority moves in the game that is backed by a huge 130 base Attack stat, as well as its Technician ability, thus making it a very potent attacker. Its Bug STAB enables it to annihilate Psychic-types, even threatening to 2HKO the incredibly resilient Cresselia. If you're looking for a bulky Steel-type to hold your team together while simultaneously posing as an offensive threat, Scizor is sure to not disappoint.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Besides Occa Berry, a Lum Berry can heal Scizor from a crippling burn and other status. A Sitrus Berry helps Scizor in its role as a bulky attacker. Scizor can be effective in Trick Room because of its low Speed; it also learns Fling, which can be used in conjunction with Iron Ball to lower its Speed and give it a 130 Base Power Dark-type move. While gimmicky, a Technician-boosted Natural Gift can let Scizor OHKO Pokemon it would normally have trouble with, such as Gyarados and Salamence, two Pokemon that one would probably never think to be in any severe danger against Scizor.</p> <p>U-turn can be a great momentum keeper and works excellently along with Fake Out or Intimidate users. However, U-turn is noticeably weaker than Bug Bite and the forced switch can sometimes be problematic because you can only bring four Pokemon and have two out at the same time. Scizor can usually get Tailwind up thanks to its superb defensive typing, barring Fake Out or Taunt, and can run enough speed EVs to outpace base 130 Speed Pokemon. Acrobatics helps rain teams immensely, KOing common rain threats such as Breloom, Virizion, and Toxicroak. Alternatively, Aerial Ace is a Technician-boosted move that allows Scizor to hold something other than a Flying Gem while still retaining the ability to KO the three Pokemon mentioned above. Night Slash allows Scizor to hit Ghost-types such as Jellicent and Chandelure for super effective damage. However, note that Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics out damages Night Slash and 2HKOes most Jellicent and Chandelure. Feint has the same priority as Extreme Speed and breaks all forms of Protect, ensuring Scizor's partner can land its attack. Quick Attack is weaker than Bullet Punch, but does more damage to Water-types such as Kingdra and Ludicolo. Besides Tailwind, Scizor also gets Light Screen for team support. It boosts your team's Special Defense, and can also save Scizor from weaker Fire-type attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Unfortunately, Scizor's movepool leaves it with few offensive options; as a consequence, there are a number of Pokemon Scizor will struggle to get past. Zapdos is one of the best switch-ins, as it resists every move on the standard set and threatens to KO Scizor with Heat Wave. Ninetales similarly resists both of its STABs and summons permanent sun, making Scizor's Occa Berry useless against most Fire-type attacks. Intimidate users such as Arcanine, Salamence, Gyarados, and Hitmontop are all a bane to Scizor, lowering its Attack and making Scizor struggle to do significant damage. Heatran, Infernape, Volcarona, and Chandelure resist both of Scizor's STABs and can KO with their STAB moves; Heatran should be wary of Superpower, however. Most Fire-types are typically a great threat to Scizor; the four above are merely the most common. However, it should be noted that in the rain, Occa Berry Scizor can survive any unboosted Fire-type attack bar Overheat. Bulky Ghost-types are a nuisance as they resist Bug Bite and can burn Scizor with Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Scizor boasts a great combination of offense and defense with this set. Bullet Punch is an incredibly powerful priority attack, picking off most weakened foes. Due to the Technician boost, Bug Bite is Scizor's strongest STAB, scoring an easy KO on Pokemon such as Latios, Ludicolo, and Abomasnow. Bug Bite also consumes the opponent's Berry, which allows Scizor to accomplish the incredible feat of 2HKOing even Sitrus Berry Cresselia. Superpower gives it much-needed coverage, hitting Steel-types such as Heatran for super effective damage. Superpower also deals more damage to Fighting-types and non-Chople Berry Tyranitar than the other attacks listed.</p> <p>252 Attack EVs are used while the rest are put into HP in order to maximize Scizor's overall bulk. If you would instead prefer to bolster Scizor's lower Special Defense, a spread of 180 HP / 252 Atk / 76 SpD maximizes Scizor's special bulk in exchange for a loss of some physical bulk.</p> <p>Protect is standard in doubles play. Scizor can feasibly forgo Protect for another attack due to its bulk and typing, but its severe weakness to Fire-type attacks will often put it in a situation where it's forced to switch when confronted by a Fire-type move if it does not carry Protect.</p> <p>Dragon-types such as Latios and Garchomp usually enjoy having Scizor around. Scizor easily picks off Weavile with Bullet Punch and forces out or deals with opposing Latios, Abomasnow, and Cresselia. In return, Garchomp and Latios can pose a deterrent to Fire-type attacks and threaten Fire-type foes with Earthquake or Rock Slide, or in Latios's case with its insanely powerful Draco Meteor. They also complement each other well defensively. Terrakion enjoys the removal of Psychic-types and can threaten Zapdos as well as most other Fire-type attack users with its powerful Rock-type STAB. Gyarados is also a great partner, resisting Fire-type attacks and supporting with Intimidate and Thunder Wave. Because of its ability to deal with Tyranitar and Abomasnow, Scizor can work well on weather teams to eliminate those two.</p>"

  "Shuckle": {
    "overview": "<p>Shuckle boasts the highest defensive stats out of every Pokemon—base 230 in both Defense and Special Defense. However, due to its low HP and pitiful offenses, Shuckle is often overlooked when considering a Pokemon on a VGC team due to the fast-paced nature of the metagame. Shuckle has a very unique move, Power Split, and when used correctly it can cause serious disruption to the enemy's team. Although the VGC metagame is fast paced, Shuckle serves a very unique niche—Power Split—in it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gastro Acid is a useful move, but unfortunately, Shuckle has no moveslots to spare for it. Encore is useful for Shuckle if Trick Room is in play; however, Prankster Pokemon are generally better at disrupting opponents with this move. Shuckle also receives Safeguard, a neat move which shields your team from status, but Pokemon such as Cresselia can utilize Safeguard better, due to not being complete Taunt bait. Struggle Bug is a useful move for lowering the opponents Special Attack, and allows Shuckle to invest fully in Defense to increase its defensive capabilities. Shuckle also receives Power Trick, which switches its Defense with its Attack, giving Shuckle 310 Attack if you run maximum Defense; however, the chances of consistently pulling off a sweep are very slim. Shuckle also has the Gluttony ability, which allows it to consume its pinch berries earlier, but Sturdy is generally the better option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>If you are concerned that your team is weak to Shuckle, throwing on a Water-type with a good base Special Attack and a good STAB should alleviate you of your problem. Kingdra is a prime example, as it shrugs off neutral Rock Slide and Bug Bite and has the ability to OHKO Shuckle with Hydro Pump in rain. Metagross also makes an excellent counter for Shuckle, denting Shuckle with its STAB super effective Meteor Mash and taking pitiful damage from both of its STAB moves. Metagross can also receive an Attack boost from Meteor Mash, which only makes Shuckle's problem even greater. Scizor also makes a great counter to Shuckle, as it is not only immune to sandstorm damage and laughs at its STABs, but also able to deal heavy damage to Shuckle through its Bullet Punch. In general, though, Pokemon who run Taunt can shut down Shuckle, making it dead weight for the next few turns.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Power Split": {
        "description": "<p>With Power Split, Shuckle can use its hideous base 10 Attack and Special Attack stats to effectively hamper the attacking power of an enemy. With the given nature and IVs, Shuckle has 30 Attack and 13 Special Attack, which turns a Modest Chandelure's 216 Special Attack into a significantly less threatening 114 Special Attack. After using Power Split on a strong physical attacker, Shuckle can use its improved Attack in an attempt to deal damage with its STAB moves. However, Shuckle has to be wary of Taunt, which stops it from using Power Split and Rest. Rock Slide is a very good move in VGC, hitting both targets for decent damage. Helping Hand is considered a very useful move in VGC, turning 2HKOs into OHKOs; however, Shuckle is not the best user of it, as it is already complete Taunt bait. Bug Bite is Shuckle's secondary STAB move, and has a nifty secondary effect of stealing the opponents' Berries. It is also useful for dealing damage to Ludicolo, who is a threat to Shuckle. With Rest, Shuckle can take advantage of its ability, Sturdy, if the opponent is using a bulky setup Pokemon, such as Calm Mind Cresselia.</p> <p>Chesto Berry is essential when using Rest, as it allows Shuckle to recover all of its health in one turn. Shuckle functions best in sandstorm, which grants it a 50% boost to its Special Defense. Sandstorm also provides residual damage, which helps Shuckle wear down the opponents. Considering Water is one of Shuckle's few weaknesses, you can opt to invest more heavily in Special Defense to better take special hits. Earthquake can be used, as it has good coverage in tandem with Rock Slide, but be careful about not hitting your partner.</p> <p>Scizor makes an excellent partner for Shuckle, as it deals with rain teams that threaten Shuckle, and is also impervious to the residual damage from sandstorm. Zapdos also makes a good teammate for Shuckle, as its main coverage moves—Thunderbolt, Hidden Power, and Heat Wave—help eliminate some of Shuckle's counters, namely. With its base 5 Speed, Shuckle benefits from Trick Room, and can flinch the opponent with Rock Slide once it is set up.</p> <p>Shuckle receives Contrary as a Dream World ability, which can be useful for turning a possible Defense or Special Defense drop into a boost. While Shuckle's other abilities are more important, neither of them are essential, and Contrary can be used so you do not have to worry about Defense drops from Crunch and Special Defense drops from Shadow Ball, Psychic, and other moves.</p>"

      "Guard Split": {
        "description": "<p>Guard Split is the main attraction to this set. Thanks to Shuckle having defensive stats can that reach into the 300's, the recipient of Guard Split has its defensive capabilities boosted through the roof. Shuckle's other moves are mainly for situations where using Guard Split is not favorable, or has already been used. Helping Hand allows Shuckle to strengthen its partner's attacks, while Toxic is used to wear foes down. Lastly, Protect allows Shuckle to scout for the opponent's attacks, and helps stall opposing Pokemon to death when used in tandem with Toxic.</p> <p>While the EV spread doesn't do much for Shuckle, it maximizes the effectiveness of Guard Split. Mental Herb prevents the opponent from stopping Shuckle in its tracks with Taunt; however, a Lum Berry can be used instead if you are worried about being afflicted with sleep from moves, such as Spore and Hypnosis.</p> <p>The best recipient for Guard Split is Chansey, due to Eviolite further boosting the effects of Guard Split. After a Guard Split, even Terrakion's Close Combat will be a 4HKO, and because critical hits do not bypass the effects of Guard Split, Chansey becomes pretty much indestructible. Porygon2, Rhydon, Snorlax, and Blissey are also good recipients of Guard Split, though they are not nearly as hard to defeat as Chansey is after the boost.</p> <p>Trick Room users, such as Cresselia, Jellicent and Chandelure, are effective at helping Shuckle set up, as Shuckle becomes the fastest Pokemon on the field under Trick Room, making it extremely hard to stop from using Guard Split. On the other hand, hard hitting sweepers, such as Latios, Salamence, and Rotom-A, are also effective partners for Shuckle. By threatening the opponent with powerful moves such as a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor, it can force the opponent to play defensively, providing an opportunity to switch out Shuckle's attacking partner in order to use Guard Split on the desired Pokemon. Alternatively, Shuckle can use Helping Hand to boost these Pokemon's attacks in an attempt to KO an opposing Pokemon.</p>"

  "Heracross": {
    "overview": "<p>While Heracross is often overlooked, it has several advantages over other common Pokemon that enable it to function well in the VGC 2012 metagame. With its excellent Bug / Fighting typing, Heracross can hit several top threats, such as Terrakion, Cresselia, and Tyranitar, for super effective damage. Thanks to its terrific base 125 Attack stat, which can be further boosted by its fantastic ability Guts, Heracross can dispose of opposing Pokemon with ease. With decent base 80 / 75 / 95 defenses, Heracross can also take a hit or two before going down. Due to its average base 85 Speed, Heracross benefits greatly from Tailwind, Trick Room, and Thunder Wave or Icy Wind support, all of which allow it to get the jump on faster threats. Heracross isn't the perfect Pokemon, however; it is plagued with weaknesses to Fire-, Flying-, and Psychic-type moves, all of which are commonly used in the VGC metagame. Despite its faults, Heracross flourishes with proper team support, and is able to fit onto any team with ease.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A more defensive spread of 252 HP / 68 Atk / 4 Def / 172 SpD / 12 Spe capitalizes on Heracross's decent bulk. Specifically, this Heracross survives a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor from Latios and two Heat Waves from Zapdos, and can do massive damage to Cresselia with a Bug Gem-boosted Megahorn. Feint can negate the opponents' Protect, but the loss of a coverage move hurts Heracross greatly. Aerial Ace gains some useful coverage, but its Base Power is too low to be usable. Smack Down, when used in conjunction with either an Earthquake user or Earthquake on Heracross, is feasible, but forces Heracross or its partner to Protect often, and wastes its Guts ability. Night Slash hits Ghost-types, but has overlapping coverage with Megahorn. If Heracross's partner can activate Guts, Heracross can use another item, such as a Bug Gem, but the set-up is difficult to accomplish consistently. Stone Edge hits Zapdos harder than Rock Slide does, but one crucial miss can lose you a game, and the fact that Rock Slide is a spread move with a flinch chance is too good to pass up on. A Choice Scarf lets Heracross outpace faster threats, but being locked into a move and losing Guts far outweighs the advantages of the extra Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Zapdos outspeeds Heracross, can KO with both Heat Wave and Hidden Power Flying, resists both its STABs, and only fears Rock Slide. Acrobatics users such as Tornadus can dispatch of Heracross with ease, as most are faster than it. Chandelure can utilize Heat Wave and often caries a Focus Sash, and therefore makes for a decent check to Heracross. Infernape outspeeds Heracross and can easily KO it with its Fire-type move of choice, or even Encore Heracross's Protect. Salamence and Dragonite outrun Heracross, wall most of its attacks, and can use a Fire-type move or Hidden Power Flying to KO Heracross. Latios also outspeeds and can use its STAB Psychic to KO Heracross.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Guts": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of common type weaknesses to demolish the opponents's team through hard-hitting moves. After a Guts boost, Heracross's Attack stat is boosted to unimaginable levels, which allows it to destroy common threats, such as Cresselia, Tyranitar, and Politoed, amongst others. Megahorn easily destroys Cresselia and Amoonguss, two Pokemon that are commonly seen in VGC. Megahorn also hits Ludicolo for super effective damage, but Heracross takes a lot of damage from Scald or Surf in the rain. Fighting-type moves are notorious for their super effective coverage; indeed, Heracross's STAB Close Combat KOes many Pokemon with ease, and hits even Pokemon who are neutral to it for large amounts of damage as well.</p> <p>Your choice of third move depends on what coverage move benefits your team most. Rock Slide and Earthquake are good spread moves, and hit a good portion of the metagame super effectively. Rock Slide helps Heracross against Flying-types, doesn't harm its ally, and hits Shedinja, while Earthquake works well with most of Heracross's recommended teammates, and hits a lot of the metagame for significant amounts of damage. Facade hits almost everything for neutral damage and, after a Guts boost, its Base Power doubles to a cool 140. Protect is a crucial move in VGC; it shields Heracross from a potentially fatal attack and activates Guts.</p> <p>The choice between Flame Orb and Toxic Orb is not very important. Toxic Orb does less damage over short periods of time, but battles tend to last longer than before so Flame Orb is typically the superior item. While unlikely, Toxic Orb prevents Heracross's Attack from being halved if its ability were to be switched. An Adamant nature lets Heracross Speed tie with other neutral base 85s, while a Jolly one enables it to get the jump on all neutral Krookodile, Lucario, and Rotom formes, Excadrill out of sand, as well as Speed tie with neutral Hydreigon.</p> <p>Suicune and Aerodactyl make for great Tailwind partners as both deal with a few counters to Heracross, namely Fire- and Flying-types. Tornadus, Salamence, and Crobat also make for good Tailwind partners. If you'd rather provide Heracross with Thunder Wave support, Pokemon such as Thundurus, Togekiss, Rotom-W, and Cresselia are great partners. Thundurus destroys Flying-types, Togekiss draws in potentially threatening attacks with Follow Me, Rotom-W threatens Fire-types, and Cresselia makes for an excellent all-round support Pokemon. Starmie is faster than all of the Dragon-types and rains on their parade with Ice Beam. Mamoswine is very useful for checking both Dragon-types and Zapdos, both of which are common checks to Heracross. Ninetales and Politoed also make for good teammates, as they can remove hail and sand, and put pressure on Fire-types. Furthermore, Politoed can use Ice Beam to deal respectable damage to Zapdos and other Flying-types.</p>"

  "Ursaring": {
    "overview": "<p>Ursaring is possibly one of the most overlooked Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame. With access to Guts, a base 130 Attack stat, and STAB Facade that reaches a base power of 315 when inflicted with a status condition, it can be a great Trick Room sweeper. Outside of Trick Room, Ursaring struggles because of its base 55 Speed, so it does not see much action. Ursaring's niche is sweeping, so it's important to avoid keeping Ursaring on the field for long periods of time if its Speed has not been boosted.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ursaring can use an Adamant nature with a Speed IV of 31 instead, but Trick Room Ursaring tends to work better. Earthquake can be used to hit Pokemon such as Heatran harder, but Close Combat is usually a better choice. Low Kick is essentially a weaker Close Combat, but may be preferred because it doesn't lower Ursaring's defenses. Counter can be really useful, but requires a lot of prediction to work effectively. Fling is also usable when using Flame Orb or Toxic Orb, but the one time chance and the prediction needed to pull it off makes Crunch the superior option. Rock Slide's ability to possibly flinch the opponent makes it another desirable option. Double-Edge and Return should only be used if Ursaring isn't using Guts, but Ursaring isn't really worth using without Facade. The elemental punches are also usable on Ursaring for coverage purposes. Brick Break doesn't hit nearly as hard as Close Combat or Low Kick, but can be useful to destroy Reflect and Light Screen. Night Slash's higher critical hit ratio is all it really has over Crunch, and is therefore an inferior option to it. Hammer Arm is more useful if Ursaring is guaranteed Trick Room at all times, as the Speed drops would make actually Ursaring faster. Swords Dance and Bulk Up are possible choices over Protect, but they won't get much use with its status cutting Ursaring's HP every turn. Unnerve and Quick Feet are Ursaring's other abilities, and neither works well enough to be used over Guts. Toxic Orb is a useful item if Ursaring is to be played more conservatively, as it does less damage than a Flame Orb only if Ursaring is on the field for three or less turns. Although Ursaring is severely outclassed without Guts, other items such as Sitrus Berry or Chople Berry that preserve its bulk can be considered.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ursaring can't handle being attacked twice in one turn, nor can it handle facing most Fighting-types. Hitmontop is especially annoying for Ursaring because of its access to Mach Punch. If Ursaring doesn't switch out at all, then its burn will eventually take it out instead. Cofagrigus's Mummy ability tends to cause problems because it nullifies Guts. Disable and Cursed Body from other Ghost-types aren't always problems, but it depends on which move they stop. Ursaring becomes frail after a Close Combat, so if any Pokemon uses a priority move on it, Ursaring will probably go down. Steel-types and bulky Pokemon tend to give Ursaring trouble because they can usually take a hit and then leave a dent in Ursaring. Pokemon with very strong, Gem-boosted attacks also give Ursaring trouble; for example, most Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteors can OHKO Ursaring, so Trick Room definitely needs to be set up to avoid these situations. Without the Speed advantage, Ursaring is very easy to stop.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Facade is an obvious choice because its base 315 power, thanks to Guts, is just too much to pass up. Ursaring is otherwise outclassed by the more common Pokemon seen in VGC 2012 if Facade is not used, as it lets it 2HKO most Pokemon who resist it. Close Combat, although it drops its Defense and Special Defense, is the best choice for this set because it gets crucial KOs on Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Excadrill, and hits Steel-types for major damage. Facade can't touch Ghost-types so Crunch is preferred because it can possibly OHKO standard Chandelure. Ursaring should avoid using Protect except when Trick Room is being set up or when facing Fighting-types with priority moves, such as Hitmontop. Although it isn’t very useful, Protect can be invaluable when trying to keep Ursaring alive.</p> <p>Ursaring only really works in Trick Room, so a Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs are best. The given EV spread is to increase Ursaring's durability and works best if Ursaring isn't constantly in battle.</p> <p>Seeing as Ursaring works best in Trick Room, it loves Trick Room partners such as Cresselia or Chandelure; Cresselia is even able to make Facade stronger with Helping Hand if needed. Because of the damage it takes from its Flame Orb, Ursaring appreciates partners with Heal Pulse, specifically Slowking, who can also set up Trick Room and counter most Fighting-types. Pokemon with Intimidate are welcome partners as well, as most Fighting-type moves tend to be physical. Follow Me and Rage Powder users are also extremely useful to Ursaring, allowing it to attack freely while its partner takes any damage directed at Ursaring. Fake Out users are priceless in the fast-paced VGC metagame; Sableye provides both Fake Out and Will-O-Wisp support, allowing Ursaring to have a bit more freedom when attacking outside of Trick Room.</p>"

  "Octillery": {
    "overview": "<p>Octillery seems incredibly mediocre compared to all the other Water-type Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame. Its average defenses and poor Speed often hinder it, leaving it quite easy to defeat with a faster Pokemon. However, with access to Water Spout, one of the strongest moves in the game, Octillery easily KOs unsuspecting opponents. To add to this, Octillery's low Speed can be abused to its fullest in a Trick Room team, while Octillery supports its team with its incredible coverage. Although this octopus may seem easily destroyed, it can quickly wash away your entire team if you underestimate it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Other moves that can be considered include Rain Dance, Thunder Wave, Surf, Sludge Bomb, and Icy Wind. Rain Dance can catch your opponent off guard and increases Water Spout's power, but it leaves Octillery wide open to an attack on the turn it is used. Thunder Wave can be used in the final turns of Trick Room to paralyze an opponent, reducing their effectiveness. Surf is another strong STAB boosted attack but hits your partner as well. Sludge Bomb can be used to hit Grass-types such as Ludicolo that otherwise give Octillery a bit of trouble. Icy Wind, similar to Thunder Wave, can be used to slow both of your opponent's Pokemon. However, Octillery's main role is to do as much damage as possible in the few turns it is alive, so it does not want to spend its time using support moves or offensive moves that do not do much damage.</p> <p>Octillery is one of the few Pokemon that received Moody as its Dream World ability, and it can be considered over its other two abilities. However, because of its unpredictability and Octillery's fragility, it is not very effective. As Moody users often use Protect, an Octillery with Moody will often draw out very long games depending on its boosts. Because VGC games run on a 15 minute timer, there are essentially only 15 turns for Octillery to gain the boosts it needs while avoiding being KOed. It is an interesting gimmick to try out, and can be deadly when Octillery gets the boosts it needs. However, it comes with great risk and is not recommended.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Octillery is rendered useless without Trick Room, so if you are able to shut down or stall out Trick Room, it will easily go down. Because it is so frail, any strong STAB attack will be able to KO it. Octillery is also walled by Pokemon that resist both of its main attacks, namely Water-type Pokemon. Rain teams that include Pokemon such as Ludicolo, Toxicroak, and Kingdra can easily soak a hit from Octillery before OHKOing it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Octillery is most effective as a Trick Room sweeper because of its low Speed. Water Spout is absolutely necessary on Octillery, and with a Water Gem boost, it can OHKO almost anything that does not resist it. However, as Octillery is fragile, Water Spout's effectiveness will decrease tenfold after it is attacked. Ice Beam hits Dragon- and Flying-type Pokemon for large amounts of damage. The last offensive move should be chosen according to your teammates. Scald is a great alternative for a strong STAB attack, doing more damage than Water Spout when Octillery is on low health; it also has a nice chance to burn. Fire Blast eliminates Steel-types such as Scizor and Ferrothorn. Energy Ball is excellent for hitting Water-types that otherwise resist Octillery's attacks. Finally, Protect is necessary to prevent Octillery from taking damage while allowing its partner to set up Trick Room.</p> <p>In order to maximize Octillery's Water Spout's damage output, Water Gem is necessary. However, Life Orb can also be used to boost the power of Octillery's other attacks, although it decreases Water Spout's potential. Quiet nature with 0 Speed IVs allow Octillery to be as fast as possible under Trick Room, and the HP EVs allow it to survive as long as possible. Sniper is the only useful ability, as Suction Cups is pointless and Moody is too risky and unreliable. Sniper has no drawbacks, and the chance of doing 3x damage is always a nice addition.</p> <p>Octillery needs to be used in Trick Room and therefore partners well with other slow Pokemon. For example, it works great alongside Cresselia and Dusknoir, who are both bulky and can help set up Trick Room as well as assist Octillery with moves such as Helping Hand. Octillery can also be used with Politoed; the boost that Rain provides makes Water Spout even more deadly. Octillery can also be used with Abomasnow, as it can KO Fire-type Pokemon that threaten Abomasnow while having the ability to spam completely accurate Blizzards thanks to Hail.</p>"

  "Houndoom": {
    "overview": "<p>When first considering Houndoom, it is most often compared to Chandelure, and rightfully so; much like Chandelure, Houndoom has the ability to hit Psychic-, Ghost-, and Grass-types. However, unlike Chandelure, it has remarkably bad defenses given its weakness to Fighting-type attacks and lack of immunity to Fake Out, as well as lower Special Attack, making Chandelure the more popular option. Houndoom does have two saving graces, however. The first is Sucker Punch, and the other is Unnerve, which enables Houndoom to reliably check common Steel-types such as Metagross and Scizor, with its STAB Fire-type moves without an Occa Berry blocking the KO. Still, its frailty and Fighting-type weakness, as well as heavy competition from Chandelure, keep Houndoom out of standard play and a rare sight outside of its small niche.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Houndoom doesn't have much else going for it. Flame Charge is basically a boosting move that can deal necessary chip damage, but you're better off having a teammate that can accomplish that given Houndoom's frailty. STAB Overheat is as frightening a prospect as ever, but the main reason it's not on the set is because Houndoom is better off projecting its Unnerving presence rather than switching out to regain its full attacking stats. Sunny Day might not be particularly useful in most cases, but it can shield Houndoom from numerous harmful weather effects such as hail, sandstorm, and rain, also powering up Houndoom's STAB Fire-type moves. Counter in conjunction with a Focus Sash stands a good chance of wiping the floor with most Fighting-types, though the omnipresence of hail, sandstorm, and priority moves make it unappealing. Beat Up, when used with a Justified user such as Terrakion or Virizion, is somewhat unexpected of Houndoom, which can turn the battle in your favor in a heartbeat. The only things wrong with this is that Houndoom is somewhat slow compared to the two, meaning you'll have to wait until the next turn to abuse your +4 Attack Close Combat, and both Pokemon are susceptible to priority or Speed-modifying moves such as Tailwind and Trick Room. Lastly, Heat Wave might seem like a good spread move to use over Fire Blast or Flamethrower, but the only way for Houndoom to learn it is to transfer it from the fourth generation games, which in turn makes it incompatible with Unnerve.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Given Houndoom's Fighting-type weakness and low defenses, Pokemon that have access to STAB Mach Punch are no-brainers as checks. Hitmontop and Conkeldurr are the best choices here, as they don't mind taking a neutral Fire-type move or two before 2HKOing Houndoom, assuming it is holding a Focus Sash. Faster Fighting-types, such as Terrakion and Infernape, also do a good job of checking Houndoom, though they might be taking some major damage after the Close Combat defense drops. Tyranitar is the next best Houndoom counter, as it laughs at all of Houndoom's moves while OHKOing right though its Focus Sash thanks to Sand Stream. Politoed and its posse of Swift Swim sweepers have absolutely no problem with Houndoom outside of being mildly annoyed by Sucker Punch. Arcanine is a notable check in this dog-eat-dog world, taking absolutely nothing from Houndoom and OHKOing it with Close Combat, and it doesn't have to risk a Speed tie afterwards if Houndoom hangs on with its Focus Sash thanks to ExtremeSpeed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Unnerving Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Houndoom is one of the few Pokemon that can claim an OHKO against Occa Berry Metagross, and with Sucker Punch, it is capable of OHKOing Latios with minor residual damage. Fire Blast is required to OHKO Metagross without any help from Houndoom's teammates, even with Life Orb, but Flamethrower is still useful should you have Pokemon to deal chip damage. Hidden Power Ice takes advantage of disabled Yache Berries to plow through standard Dragon-types, such as Garchomp and Dragonite, though it needs either Life Orb or chip damage for a clean OHKO. Taunt completely shuts down support Pokemon without moves to hit Houndoom, such as Cresselia, ensures Sucker Punch will always hit, and prevents Pokemon from using Protect. Protect is a fairly standard move in VGC, and it is very useful for waiting for Houndoom's teammate to deal chip damage to a target.</p> <p>Although Houndoom doesn't have many tricks up its sleeve, there are a couple of changes to the main options one could make. A Dark Gem guarantees the KO on Latios with Sucker Punch, though that's about all it's good for. Dark Pulse, while certainly useful for dealing massive damage to Psychic-types, is illegal with the combination of Sucker Punch and Unnerve. If you can supply paralysis or Icy Wind support, Dark Pulse becomes more viable, but without it, Sucker Punch will be the more useful option.</p> <p>Pokemon that can take advantage of Houndoom's Unnerve ability spring to mind as good teammates. Amoonguss and Cresselia are thus excellent teammates, as they can cripple opponents without worry of Lum Berries, deal chip damage, and keep Houndoom safe from faster Pokemon. Mamoswine, Rotom-W, and most Fighting-types also make excellent candidates, as Yache Berry Garchomp, Wacan Berry Politoed, and Chople Berry Tyranitar are all less threatening when their Berry of choice is neutralized, and said teammates will often score a clean or near OHKO on these threats. Breloom presents the best of both worlds, as it is capable of OHKOing Politoed, Tyranitar, and even Rindo Berry Gastrodon with the appropriate STAB move, and can use Spore to put dangerous Pokemon to sleep.</p>"

  "Kingdra": {
    "overview": "<p>It seems that Kingdra has been given all the tools it needs in order to thrive in the VGC 2012 metagame. An ability in Swift Swim that boosts its Speed in rain, a great Water- and Dragon-typing, a reliable spread move in Surf that’s further boosted by the rain and reasonable bulk all allow Kingdra to be an effective teammate in this weather-dominated metagame. However, Kingdra lives and dies with Rain Dance on the field, so it is essential that you use Politoed to set up rain, and allow it to survive as long as possible in order to replenish the rain that will inevitably be negated by other weather inducing opponents.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kingdra's movepool outside of these moves isn't very deep, but there are a few other options. Rain Dance can take precedence over one of its moves, allowing Kingdra to bring forth rain onto the field manually if the weather has been changed the previous turn. Hidden Power Fire outside of the rain can be used in order to take out Abomasnow and Ferrothorn; beware that Hidden Power Fire in the rain will be considerably weakened, however. Scald or Muddy Water can be used as Kingdra's STAB Water-type attack, with Scald having a chance to burn, and Muddy Water a chance for an accuracy drop. Substitute is an option for those who are wary about status moves; it also allows Kingdra to outpredict its opponent and set up a Substitute when the opponent attempts to Protect against Kingdra's attacks. Finally, Disable may seem like a gimmicky option, but it allows Kingdra to shut down a Dragon-type attack from an enemy quite easily due to Kingdra's alarming Speed in rain. Simply Protect on the first turn while the enemy uses its Dragon-type attack, and Disable on the next turn to prevent the enemy from firing off its previous attack.</p> <p>Kingdra has the option of using a Water or Dragon Gem, both which give a one time boost to Kingdra's STAB attacks. Water Gem in particular, coupled with STAB and rain on the field, has the potential of making Kingdra's Surf attack incredibly powerful. Absorb Bulb can also work if your teammate is also using Surf, and since Kingdra is 4x resistant to Water-type attacks, it takes miniscule damage and receives a Special Attack Boost.</p> <p>Kingdra gets Damp as its Dream World ability. Needless to say, Swift Swim is infinitely more useful than this. Kingdra relies on its extremely high Speed stat to be successful in this metagame, and furthermore, Explosion, with its nerf in the 5th Generation, is not as prevalent as it was in the previous VGC metagames.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As mentioned above, opposing weather shifting Pokemon are the greatest threat to Kingdra, as they bring down Kingdra's Speed stat down to mediocre levels and weaken its Water-type attacks. Tyranitar is one of the most popular weather changing Pokemon with its Sand Stream ability; the Sandstorm that it brings onto the field will also increase Tyranitar's Special Defense, so beware. Ninetales's Drought brings forth eternal sun, further crippling Kingdra's Water-type attacks. Any Dragon-type enemy who can either survive an attack from Kingdra, or outspeed Kingdra outside of rain will also check it nicely. Garchomp and Latios fit the bill perfectly, as both outspeed Kingdra outside of the rain and can also carry a Haban Berry to survive a Dragon-type attack from Kingdra and KO back, assuming Kingdra is not holding a Haban Berry itself. Paralysis also damns Kingdra for the majority of the game since Kingdra relies on its Speed stat to thrive in this metagame. Finally, Ferrothorn, while not a common threat, takes miniscule damage from all of Kingdra's attacks, except for Ice Beam, and can deal major damage with its STAB Power Whip.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rain Dance Kingdra": {
        "description": "<p>Kingdra has plenty of options to use for its Water-type STAB attack; however, Surf and Hydro Pump are probably the best options. Surf allows Kingdra to attack both opponents at the same time while gaining a power boost in the rain. However, Surf will hit Kingdra’s teammate as well; knowing this, it is crucial that Kingdra’s teammate either resists or is immune to Water-type attacks, or casts Protect on that respective turn. Hydro Pump is another option, allowing Kingdra to target one single opponent without hitting its own teammate on the field; however, the lowered accuracy makes it unreliable in crucial situations, so one might want to opt for Surf instead. Dragon Pulse acts as its secondary STAB attack, giving it excellent coverage, which is only resisted by Empoleon. Draco Meteor may be used over Dragon Pulse for raw power; however, the Special Attack drop cripples Kingdra immensely. Therefore, because switching in and out is rather difficult in this present metagame, it is recommended that Dragon Pulse be used over Draco Meteor. Ice Beam is used to hit Parasect, Amoonguss and other Grass-type opponents super effectively. Hidden Power Electric may also be used in this slot in order to hit opposing Water-type enemies. Finally, Protect is used in the fourth slot, allowing Kingdra to protect itself against a powerful attack for one turn.</p> <p>Life Orb is used for maximum damage output, which is especially important when using spread moves such as Surf. As Kingdra is usually used offensively, Life Orb is probably the best choice for it. However, Haban Berry can be used instead to negate Kingdra’s only weakness, giving Kingdra a greater degree of survivability and an opportunity to KO the enemy in return. However, beware that a Latios using a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor will still KO Kingdra through Haban Berry.</p> <p>252 Special Attack EVs are obvious since this set’s main focus is dealing as much damage as possible in the rain. 252 Speed EVs are used to outspeed almost everything in this metagame, allowing Kingdra to become an offensive monster in the rain. However, 196 Speed EVs may be used instead in order to outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Garchomp in the rain, while the rest of the EVs can be invested into HP for additional bulk; be warned though, as a Jolly Choice Scarf Terrakion, a +2 Jolly Blaziken, a +2 Modest Yanmega, and weather abusers, such as Kabutops, will be able to outspeed Kingdra. Thus, it is recommended that one runs 252 Speed EVs instead.</p> <p>Politoed is probably Kingdra's most important teammate. Its ability to set up eternal rain on the field, as well as its resistance to Surf, makes it invaluable to Kingdra, not to mention the team as a whole. Toxicroak also makes a great teammate, as it is able to set up Rain Dance, while also being able to take advantage of it and Water-type attacks from its teammates due to its Dry Skin ability. Furthermore, it can take down Tyranitar, one of the biggest counters to rain due to its ability to cancel out rain with its Sand Stream ability. Finally, Toxicroak's ability to Taunt Trick Room users and access to STAB Drain Punch to take out Ferrothorn, another great rain counter, make it invaluable. Gastrodon also is a great teammate, obtaining a Special Attack boost when hit by any Water-type attack with its Storm Drain ability. Furthermore, its ability to check Trick Room teams with its abysmal Speed stat makes it further useful. Finally, a teammate who can resist Dragon-type attacks aimed at Kingdra will lengthen Kingdra's survivability by quite a bit. Metagross is perfect for this; it resists Dragon-type attacks, while sporting Ice Punch to take out the offending Dragon-type enemy. Metagross's weakness to Fire-type attacks is also mitigated by rain.</p>"

  "Porygon2": {
    "overview": "<p>With good overall bulk further boosted by Eviolite, an expansive support movepool, and access to the coveted Recover, one might question why Porygon2 is not a more commonly seen Pokemon in the VGC metagame. The answer is simple: Porygon2's lack of a good Special Attack stat and reliance on Eviolite make it quite possibly the biggest Taunt bait in the metagame. While Magic Coat might help to assuage this significant problem, it does not spare Porygon2 from the wrath of Pokemon bearing Imprison, which hinders its usefulness even more. Porygon2's Speed also leaves much to be desired, which means it is only really useful as a Trick Room supporter. Regardless of these shortcomings, Porygon2 should not be overlooked as an option when searching for a bulky Trick Room user. Give Porygon2 a try, and you will be assured of distorted dimensions and a duck that refuses to faint.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Porygon2's movepool is massive, it does not consist of many useful supporting options. Icy Wind gives Porygon2 the ability to cut the enemies' Speed while preventing it from being Taunt bait, but is rather weak and allows opposing Trick Room teams to become even more threatening. Gravity, Rain Dance, and Sunny Day are all field moves that Porygon2 can utilize nicely to easily disrupt the match, courtesy of its great bulk. Toxic and Thunder Wave are good status alternatives, which Porygon2 has little to no problem spreading around due to its bulk. Lastly, Porygon2 can utilize its Dream World ability, Analytic, nicely, due to Porygon2's relatively low Speed and Analytic's reliability in comparison to Trace or Download. However, Analytic is most useful outside of Trick Room, which conflicts with Porygon2's best role.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>While it might be difficult to destroy the cyber duck, it is much easier to simply neuter it by preventing it from supporting its team. Certain threats can utilize Imprison in conjunction with Trick Room to immediately shut down Porygon2's ability to Trick Room, forcing it out and making it a burden to its team. Chandelure excels at this thanks to key resistances and immunities to Ice- and Normal-type moves, which allow it to evade Fake Out and Tri Attack while taking little damage from Ice Beam. If your team cannot spare a slot for such a Pokemon, then it might be beneficial to just Taunt Porygon2. Once Porygon2 is Taunted, not only is it a sitting duck (pun intended), but it also cannot Recover back its HP, which will result in a slow, painful death. If you lack Taunt or a user of Imprison + Trick Room, then your best option will be to target Porygon2's weakness—powerful Fighting-type attacks—which will inevitably lead to its doom. Hariyama does an excellent job at this, as its presence discourages Trick Room, and it can hit Porygon2 hard with a Guts-boosted STAB Close Combat for the KO.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Support": {
        "description": "<p>One of the ways of stopping an enemy from setting up Trick Room is to kill it. Porygon2's immense defenses eliminate the chances of it fainting quickly, enabling it to successfully set up Trick Room for the team. Trick Room is the crux of the set, giving Porygon2's slow partners the upper hand by allowing them to move first. Tri Attack is Porygon2's only usable special STAB attack and can dent the opposition should Porygon2 be Taunted, as well as soften enemies for Porygon2's partners. Ice Beam, however, hits most common Taunt users, namely Thundurus, Tornadus, Whimsicott, and Murkrow, for super effective damage, and hence might be more useful if you wish to prevent Porygon2 from being Taunted. Recover is what separates Porygon2 from the many other bulky Trick Room users, as it gives Porygon2 a reliable way of restoring 50% of its health. Protect is overall a great move in doubles, as it shields Porygon2 from attacks, scouts the enemy, and stalls turns. Lastly, Magic Coat allows Porygon2 to take advantage of the fact that it is an enormous Taunt bait, and reflect Taunt back at the opposition.</p> <p>Porygon2 attracts Taunts like how a flame attracts moths; this issue must therefore be dealt with. Fake Out support is the traditional way of stopping Taunt, and buys Porygon2 time to set up Trick Room. Porygon2's sky-high defenses, combined with access to a reliable recovery move, make it very hard to take down mid- and late-game. However, one must be careful to make best use of Porygon2's niche as a Trick Room user. Porygon2's vulnerability to both Taunt and Fake Out often make it a poor choice if you are using it to lead and set up Trick Room. In that role, it is far outclassed by the likes of Dusknoir and Dusclops, both of whom have good defenses, while also being immune to Fake Out.</p> <p>Porygon2 has two great abilities to choose from: Download and Trace. Trace allows Porygon2 to copy the opponent's ability, which can be game-changing. For example, if Porygon2 traces Bronzong's or Cresselia's Levitate, it will further delay, if not prevent its death in battle. However, there are times where Porygon2 might Trace something useless or even detrimental to itself, such as Speed Boost. To insure some degree of reliability, one might opt to use Download, which gives Porygon2 the strength to dent things, but once again, there is a chance the ability might boost Porygon2's Attack instead.</p> <p>Porygon2 can run an alternate spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD to decrease the damage it takes from special attacks. Additionally, Porygon2 can utilize Thunderbolt, Thunder, or Discharge over one of its support moves to gain good coverage with Ice Beam, but this is not recommended as Porygon2's attacks are normally far too weak to pose an offensive threat. Such a change would also hamper Porygon2's ability to support its team, its primary role.</p>"

  "Smeargle": {
    "overview": "<p>Say hello to the oddest Pokemon allowed in VGC 2012. With balanced base 20 offenses, poor 55 / 35 / 45 defenses, and a mediocre base 75 Speed stat, you might wonder why one would ever use it. The reason is simple: it can learn almost every move in the Pokemon universe, making it one of the best support Pokemon available. Smeargle can potentially use an incredible number of moves, such as Fake Out, Helping Hand, Tailwind, and Trick Room. However, the fact that it is KOed by a light breeze doesn't help while it's trying to support a team. Additionally, it has terrible offensive stats, leaving it complete Taunt bait. To top it all off, the best move Smeargle can get in VGC 2012, Dark Void, is banned. Nevertheless, Smeargle can be very annoying to your opponent if you play it correctly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Smeargle can literally use all moves except for Chatter; the problem is trying to find moves it can utilize well while not being completely outclassed. Thunder Wave can be used to spread paralysis, but Pokemon such as Thundurus and Cresselia are better users of this move thanks to priority and higher defenses, respectively. Will-O-Wisp is another status move that Smeargle can use, but Sableye outclasses Smeargle in this due to Prankster. Super Fang cuts down bulky Pokemon such as Cresselia and Metagross, weakening them to let a teammate KO them later. Tailwind gives team support and lets Smeargle outspeed faster Pokemon such as Tornadus and Infernape. Detect and Protect can be used to gain an extra turn on the field, be it for stalling or scouting.</p> <p>An Imprison set is somewhat viable, and can often catch your opponent off-guard. Moody + Entrainment is pretty cool, but it is a gimmicky strategy at best and relies on a bit of luck. Smeargle can also use Baton Pass with Moody, but as VGC 2012 battles are very short, it isn't really worth the moveslot. Transform can work with a bit of luck, but is otherwise extremely unreliable. Finally, Choice Scarf can be used either to let Smeargle Spore faster opponents before they can move, or with Trick or Switcheroo.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As Smeargle does nothing other than support its team, it isn't that hard to beat. Taunt is the easiest way around Smeargle, as it shuts down both common variants. However, be careful of Smeargle carrying Mental Herb. Pokemon that carry Lum Berry or Chesto Berry can also check Smeargle, as the Berry cures them of sleep and lets them KO the artist. One can also get rid of Smeargle the old-fashioned way: OHKO it with any move. However, remember that most Smeargle carry a Focus Sash, and can survive one hit to put your Pokemon to sleep.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility Lead": {
        "description": "<p>With Smeargle's massive movepool and somewhat acceptable Speed, it can pull off a lead set to great effect. Fake Out flinches your opponent, giving your teammate a chance to set up a Tailwind or Trick Room, or take out an opponent before it can threaten your team. In addition to letting it outpace Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Metagross, Smeargle's base 75 Speed also makes it the fastest user of Spore in the entire game, letting it take out Trick Room users. Follow Me draws attacks away from Smeargle's partner, giving it time to attack the opponent. Helping Hand can help Smeargle boost the power of its partner's attacks by 50%, which can be the difference between KOing the opponent or having it survive. The last slot depends on what Smeargle needs to accomplish. With Taunt, Smeargle can stop slower support Pokemon such as Cresselia and Musharna. However, they commonly run Mental Herb, which takes away the guarantee that Taunt stops them. Encore locks the opponent into moves such as Protect, making prediction easier.</p> <p>With Smeargle's horrible defenses, a Focus Sash is a great item for it, as it lets Smeargle survive at least one attack. If a teammate is already holding a Focus Sash, Mental Herb is an option, allowing Smeargle to break through Taunt and Spore the opponent. The EVs allow Smeargle to outspeed and Spore Hitmontop, Metagross, Tyranitar, and Mamoswine. Smeargle has two abilities it can use. Own Tempo prevents confusion, which can be useful against an opponent that uses Confuse Ray or Teeter Dance. Moody can make Smeargle harder to KO and can double its Speed, letting it outrun Pokemon such as Latios and Terrakion. Just be aware that Moody has a chance to reduce Smeargle's Speed instead, allowing the base 70 Speed Pokemon it could otherwise outrun to now outspeed it.</p> <p>The best teammates for Smeargle are Pokemon that set up, such as Quiver Dance Volcarona or Dragon Dance Haxorus. Frail sweepers that can't take a hit, such as Weavile and Zoroark, also work well with Smeargle.</p>"
      },
      "Lv. 1 Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>This set is very useful in Ubers and OU, and can be successful in VGC 2012 as well. One thing that sets this variant of Smeargle apart from Lv. 1 Whimsicott is Spore, which must be used on this set. Unless double targeted or Taunted, Smeargle will always get Trick Room up, making it an excellent supporter for a Trick Room team. Endeavor brings the foe to low HP, making it easier to take out instantly or later on in the battle. Feint breaks Protect and is exceptionally useful in Trick Room, as most opponents will try to stall out Trick Room with Protect. However, Destiny Bond can be used to take out an opponent when Smeargle has done its job.</p> <p>Focus Sash is necessary for this set to work, as Lv. 1 Smeargle will otherwise be unable to survive any direct attack. Moves such as Dragon Rage or ExtremeSpeed also work with this set, as after Smeargle uses Endeavor on the opponent, it can KO the foe with priority, or use Dragon Rage to guarantee the KO even after Leftovers.</p> <p>This set requires a large amount of team support to function well. Fake Out users, such as Hariyama and Scrafty, can flinch an opponent to stop Smeargle from being double targeted or Taunted that turn. Pokemon that use Rage Powder or Follow Me make great teammates as well, as they protect Smeargle by redirecting incoming attacks to themselves. Togekiss or Amoonguss make fine choices here, as both have decent amount of bulk to survive attacks.</p>"

  "Blissey": {
    "overview": "<p>Blissey has ridiculous special bulk; it is an absolute certainty that Blissey will win one-on-one against almost any special attacker, or even a pair. However, its Defense is the total opposite of its Special Defense. Blissey is easily trounced by physical attackers, as well as most Steel- and Poison-types due to their immunity to Toxic. Blissey has access to a multitude of support moves and special attacks, so despite its weakness to physical attackers, it makes an excellent partner for just about anything.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter, along with a Chople Berry, can obtain quite a few unexpected KOs, easily taking Close Combats and other Fighting-type attacks and retaliating with a KO. Serene Grace with Charge Beam allows Blissey to use a damaging attack that also raises its Special Attack every time it hits. This makes Blissey far less susceptible to Steel- and Poison-types and Taunt, and allows it to deal some good damage after a few boosts, as well as break Focus Sashes. Minimize is an especially interesting option and can allow Blissey to get past many physical attackers with a bit of luck and a free turn or two. Sing and Attract are extremely unreliable, but synergize well with Minimize. The time limit is always an issue, however. Charm can help in a one-on-one situation against a physical attacker that can normally 2HKO Blissey (which is basically any physical attacker without Fighting-type moves). Heal Pulse and Reflect or Light Screen help Blissey's partner, using its ridiculous special longevity to support the team. Heal Bell heals away Toxic, which is many rain teams' only defense against Blissey. Thunder Wave and Icy Wind support a slower partner, while Gravity boosts accuracy and Helping Hand can boost a partner's power. Blissey has access to a ridiculous number of support moves, but is plagued by four-moveslot syndrome, as well as the time limit, which limit the gamut of usable attacks.</p> <p>Because Seismic Toss is illegal with Healer, Natural Cure is most often the better choice. However, if not using Seismic Toss, Healer will make an excellent replacement to Natural Cure due to the low amount of switching, which makes Natural Cure useless, while Healer's chance to fix a status ailment can be immensely useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Almost any physical attacker can OHKO or 2HKO Blissey easily, without suffering much more than a Toxic in return, and Fighting-types in particular can usually OHKO it with ease, although Thunder Wave, Charm, or Chople Berry can hinder or even completely stop them if used correctly. Taunt using special attackers stop Soft-Boiled and Taunt, and can just whale away at Blissey until the blob is finally eliminated, but the time limit may allow Blissey to stall them out to win, and Seismic Toss means Blissey will be able to beat them regardless. Gengar is immune to both Seismic Toss and Toxic, so Blissey can do nothing but paralyze it with Thunder Wave.</p>",

      "Special Wall": {
        "description": "<p>This set is the standard frustrating wall, providing a full stop to almost any special attacker. However, despite its complete mastery of all special attacks, most physical attackers can effectively drop-kick it into next week, especially Fighting-types. Toxic allows Blissey to actually deal damage, although the time limit means it will be slightly difficult to ensure a win thanks to its slow damage. Soft-Boiled recovers HP to make Blissey effectively invincible. Seismic Toss hits Steel-types and stops Blissey from being complete Taunt bait, while Protect prevents damage for a turn, which is really useful for Blissey thanks to its tendency to be easily KOed by most strong physical attacks.</p> <p>A Calm nature allows Blissey to take on especially powerful special attackers, especially rain teams, but a Bold nature gives a very small benefit to Defense, which can come in handy against weaker physical attackers. More Special Defense EVs are unnecessary, as Blissey already has a ridiculous amount of special bulk, and the Defense EVs allow it to take as many physical hits as possible. Blissey is useful for checking special attackers and annoying rain teams (bar Toxicroak and Scizor). It's not an exaggeration to say that Blissey can win the match even if your opponent has four Pokemon on their side and Blissey is your last one left, if all opposing Pokemon are special attackers. Intimidate users, such as Gyarados and Hitmontop, Follow Me or Rage Powder users, such as Amoonguss and Togekiss, Psychic-type attackers, such as Latios and Reuniclus, and Ghost-types with Will-O-Wisp, such as Sableye, Dusclops, and Dusknoir, are really really good partners in a stalling combination, as they can take care of most of the Pokemon that plague Blissey. Prankster Taunt users can also prove useful, as Blissey is completely shut down by opposing Taunt. Thundurus is especially useful, and excels in taking out Gyarados, which commonly carries Taunt. Sableye is also doubly useful, with Will-O-Wisp to neuter physical attackers. The primary reason to use Blissey over Chansey is the ability to use an item: Chople Berry allows Blissey to take Fighting-type attacks with relative ease, while Leftovers allows it to take repeated hits from strong attackers without faltering far more easily than Chansey, despite Chansey's greater defenses.</p>"

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Tyranitar is one of the most popular Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame, and for good reason. It has very impressive stats, the best of which is its massive base 134 Attack. With a base Speed of only 61, however, it is one of the slower Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame. This can be taken advantage of by providing it with Trick Room support, or simply by using it to underspeed opposing weather Pokemon. Tyranitar's Sand Stream ability initiates a sandstorm whenever Tyranitar enters the battlefield; when two weather inducers are sent out at the same time (the beginning of the battle, for example), the slower Pokemon's weather stays in effect. Tyranitar's Rock / Dark typing gives it two very useful STAB attacks, but also provides it with a horrific 4x weakness to Fighting-type moves, a very popular attack type in the VGC 2012 metagame. Furthermore, Tyranitar is weak to Ground-, Water-, and Grass-type moves, all of which are common in the metagame as well. Thankfully, Tyranitar's weaknesses to Water- and Grass-type attacks are to a certain extent offset by the Special Defense boost that Rock-types receive during a sandstorm.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tyranitar has a vast movepool, but many of its moves are not viable in VGC 2012. If your team relies heavily on sandstorm being set up, Tyranitar can hold Iron Ball instead of one of the recommended items to lower its Speed, and take advantage of it by running the move Fling. With an Iron Ball, Fling becomes an immensely powerful 130 Base Power Dark-type move, which is further boosted by STAB. One problem with this strategy, though, is that it can only be pulled off once. Additionally, if the target uses Protect, the Iron Ball is used up and the strategy is rendered useless. In place of Low Kick, Tyranitar can instead use a support move, such as Taunt or Thunder Wave. Taunt can be used to mess with Trick Room teams, but Tyranitar itself generally fares well in Trick Room due to its low Speed. Tyranitar also has a wide selection of powerful special attacks, such as Fire Blast, Thunderbolt, and Ice Beam, but its base 95 Special Attack pales in comparison to its base 134 Attack stat. Stone Edge can be used in place of Rock Slide, but its low accuracy makes it less reliable, and unlike Rock Slide, it can also be redirected by Follow Me and Rage Powder. Nonetheless, one big advantage of Stone Edge is its ability to easily 2HKO Gyarados, which is a big threat to Tyranitar. Tyranitar receives a number of other moves, such as Iron Head and Aqua Tail, but they are not recommended due to their poor type coverage. If you do not care about initiating a sandstorm, or would rather take better advantage of Tailwind or Icy Wind support, you can use an Adamant nature and a 31 Speed IV. Another option is utilizing 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature along with Choice Scarf, which can catch your opponents off guard. This opens up Tyranitar to being OHKOed by any number of attacks, but the added Speed can be helpful in some situations. In particular, Tyranitar can outspeed and OHKO Latios and Thundurus, which can otherwise pose a threat to Tyranitar and its teammates.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As stated before, Fighting-type Pokemon are the bane of Tyranitar's existence. They are able to deal massive amounts of damage to Tyranitar while taking relatively little in return. Pokemon with the Intimidate ability also fare well against Tyranitar, as Tyranitar almost always relies on physical attacks to deal damage. Hitmontop and Arcanine are particularly threatening because they pose an imminent threat to Tyranitar, but even Salamence and Gyarados can be switched in relatively safely, as neither is OHKOed by Rock Slide after Intimidate. Other Pokemon that can wall Tyranitar well and severely damage it include most Steel-types, such as Metagross and Ferrothorn.</p>",

Tyranitar can choose between any number of attacks for its third move, as it has a very wide movepool. Low Kick is generally preferred, as it does heavy damage to the many Steel-types that resist Rock Slide and Crunch.</p> <p>The EVs listed maximize Tyranitar's HP so that it can take both special and physical hits well. However, they do not enable Tyranitar to always survive a Close Combat from 252+ Hitmontop even should Tyranitar be holding a Chople Berry. You can choose to invest 212 EVs into HP to enable Tyranitar to survive the aforementioned hit, but no amount of investment will allow Chople Berry Tyranitar to survive Life Orb Hitmontop's Close Combat with surety. Lastly, it should be noted that Tyranitar is overwhelmingly unlikely to survive a similar assault from Fighting Gem Hitmontop.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Tyranitar doesn't have many options to deal with opposing Fighting-type Pokemon, which are the biggest threats to it. As such, good teammates for Tyranitar include Pokemon that can comfortably take on Fighting-types, such as Cresselia and Gyarados. Other recommended partners are Pokemon that can take advantage of the sandstorm that Tyranitar summons, such as Garchomp, Excadrill, and Landorus. Pokemon that can quickly eliminate potential threats to Tyranitar, such as Latios and Porygon-Z, also make great teammates for Tyranitar. However if running Unnerve as the ability, Tyranitar can pair well with other weather setters like Abomasnow and Ninetales as well as other Pokemon who can work well without the nuisance Sand Stream can bring. If you are looking to provide Tyranitar with Trick Room support, Slowking, Dusclops, and Dusknoir are among the best options. These Pokemon can cover Tyranitar's weakness to Fighting-type attackers by either hitting them hard with STAB Psychic or Scald, or burning them with Will-O-Wisp, weakening them greatly. The three also have strong defenses and resist or are immune to many of the common attacks directed at Tyranitar, making them excellent teammates. If Tyranitar doesn't already have Fire-type support through teammates, it can use Fire Blast to deal heavy damage against Steel-, Bug-, and Grass-types. Scizor and Ferrothorn are a few to name that Fire Blast threatens.</p>"

      "Unnerve": {
        "description": "<p>This set outlines the use of Tyranitar on a weatherless team, and makes use of its special attacking capabilities. This gives it merit over a physical set because Intimidate no longer cripples Tyranitar. Dark Pulse is the main STAB move for the set, as it hits many Pokemon for neutral damage and most Trick Room users super effectively. Flamethrower is used to give coverage against Steel-types such as Scizor, Metagross, and Ferrothorn; these threats can all haunt a physical set because Tyranitar has no physical options to hurt them significantly. Ice Beam gives coverage against Dragon- and Flying-types such as Garchomp and Thundurus, which can destroy Tyranitar with Earthquake and cripple its teammates with Thunder Wave, respectively. Protect helps Tyranitar work around Pokemon that may threaten it, avoiding all attacks for a turn while a teammate handles the threat.</p> <p>Without Sand Stream, Tyranitar loses the Special Defense boost provided by sandstorm, making it susceptible to a wider range of attacks. A Chople Berry allows Tyranitar to take less damage from common Fighting-type attacks such as Technician Mach Punch from Hitmontop and Close Combat from anything that doesn't have Fighting-type STAB. A Focus Sash can be used to let Tyranitar survive at least one of these hits, such as a Fighting Gem Close Combat from Hitmontop or Hydro Pump from Ludicolo in the rain. A Modest nature gives Tyranitar a boost in Special Attack, allowing it to perform well in a special attacking role. Although Unnerve may seem like an odd choice for a Pokemon such as Tyranitar, it actually helps Tyranitar function as an attacker on teams that do not want a sandstorm to ensue. However, this doesn't mean that Unnerve comes without further use. It allows Tyranitar to go up against common bulky Pokemon and take them down more easily due to the fact that Unnerve negates type-resistance and health restoration Berries, such as Yache and Sitrus. The EV spread maximizes HP for general bulk allows Tyranitar to take a few neutral hits before it gets KOed, and maximum investment in Special Attack helps Tyranitar hit as hard as possible. Moves such as Blizzard and Fire Blast could be used to hit harder than Ice Beam and Flamethrower at the cost of accuracy. A Quiet nature in conjunction with 0 Speed IVs can be used you are running Tyranitar on a Trick Room team.</p> <p>With Unnerve, Tyranitar becomes a great partner for sleep, Will-O-Wisp, and Thunder Wave users because Unnerve cancels the use of any kind of Berry that could otherwise reverse the status Tyranitar's partner dishes out. Specific status inducers who work especially well are Togekiss and Amoonguss, who can utilize Follow Me and Rage Powder, respectively, to draw potential KOs away from Tyranitar. Because Tyranitar no longer summons sand with Unnerve, it can easily find space for use on a hail or sun team with Abomasnow or Ninetales. Tyranitar benefits from usage on hail and sun teams because they help Tyranitar work around the rain teams that are problematic to deal with. Pokemon with Prankster, such as Murkrow, Sableye, and Whimsicott, also make great partners as they can neuter physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp or moves that reduce Attack, such as FeatherDance and Charm.</p>"

  "Ludicolo": {
    "overview": "<p>Ludicolo has always been a staple on any rain team because of its unique typing and wide variety of moves. Upon first inspection, Ludicolo's stats seem average. Its defenses are sub-par and its Special Attack is just a meager base 90. However, Ludicolo's ordinary Speed turns lightning-fast in the rain because of Swift Swim, allowing it to outspeed almost everything in the VGC 2012 metagame. This dancing duck is certainly an excellent addition to any rain team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Grass Knot is often more powerful than Giga Drain, but one key target, Rotom-W, gets hit by Grass Knot for 20 Base Power, so it essentially walls Ludicolo if Ludicolo's only Grass-type move is Grass Knot. Politoed is also only hit for 60 Base Power compared to Giga Drain's 75. Water Gem can be used to boost Ludicolo's more powerful STAB moves, and Ice Gem can be used to surprise Dragon-type Pokemon, OHKOing them even with a Yache Berry.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>When rain is up and Ludicolo has either an Absorb Bulb boost or a Life Orb, it can surprisingly OHKO almost anything that does not resist its attacks. The biggest problem for Ludicolo is if there is no rain, because its Speed will be cut and it can easily be KOed before getting a chance to strike back. Similarly, Ludicolo also suffers greatly should it get paralyzed. As Ludicolo has a major weakness to Flying-type moves, common users of said attacks, such as Scizor, Tornadus, and Crobat, will all be able to OHKO it, provided they are not KOed first. Latios and Latias can also cause Ludicolo problems if it does not run Ice Beam, as they resist both of its STAB attacks. In general, Ludicolo is not a very bulky Pokemon and its poor defenses do not allow it to take hits very well, so powerful STAB attacks such as Thunder, Close Combat, and Draco Meteor can easily KO it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>This set is fairly straightforward but also incredibly effective. Fake Out allows Ludicolo to put pressure on the opponent and assists its partner. When holding an Absorb Bulb, Fake Out Ludicolo works especially well with a partner that knows Surf, as this immediately boosts Ludicolo's Special Attack. Hydro Pump, Surf, and Scald are all strong offensive options that have different uses. A rain boosted Hydro Pump does a massive amount of damage, OHKOing almost everything that does not resist it. However, if you dislike Hydro Pump's risky accuracy, Scald is a weaker alternative. Surf pairs well with Pokemon such as Toxicroak and Parasect, benefitting your team while dealing large amounts of damage to both of your opponent's Pokemon. Giga Drain is its most reliable Grass-type STAB attack, and also deals massive damage to Rotom-W and Gastrodon. Ice Beam hits Dragon-type Pokemon that otherwise wall Ludicolo for super effective damage. However, Protect may be used to allow Ludicolo to survive as long as possible.</p> <p>Absorb Bulb takes advantage of Ludicolo's resistance to Water-type moves, and gives it the boost it needs to OHKO several common Pokemon such as Zapdos and Metagross. However, Life Orb can also be used as an alternative as it does not need to be set up. The EV spread given lets Ludicolo outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Terrakion and Jolly Choice Scarf Garchomp in rain. However, an alternative spread of 172 HP / 252 SpA / 84 Spe can be used for more bulk, while maintaining the ability to outspeed all base 130 Pokemon.</p> <p>As this Ludicolo is designed for use on a rain team, it works best alongside other Pokemon that perform well in rain. For example, it partners very well with Politoed; Politoed sets up rain for Ludicolo, and can activate Ludicolo's Absorb Bulb with Surf. Other Pokemon Ludicolo works well with include Toxicroak, Kingdra, and Thundurus. Toxicroak takes care of Tyranitar and Abomasnow, both of whom give Ludicolo trouble when rain is not up. Kingdra can also use Surf to activate Ludicolo's Absorb Bulb and dish out huge amounts of damage with Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse. Thundurus takes care of Ludicolo's weakness to Flying-types, easily KOing threats such as Tornadus.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky": {
        "description": "<p>This Ludicolo aims to annoy your opponent by Leech Seeding everything while setting up Substitutes. With Leech Seed, Rain Dish, and Leftovers, Ludicolo heals a great amount of HP every turn. Leech Seed is made even better in doubles by the fact that Ludicolo can use it on both of the enemy Pokemon. Icy Wind deals super effective damage to Grass-type Pokemon that are immune to Leech Seed, and slows down threats for Ludicolo's partner as well. However, Substitute allows Ludicolo to stall while healing every turn, which can result in a win with the time limit in effect. Giga Drain enables Ludicolo to recover even more HP, while Protect is crucial in allowing Ludicolo to survive for as long as possible while gaining health every turn.</p> <p>Leftovers allows Ludicolo to heal a consistent 1/16 of its HP every turn, but Sitrus Berry heals 1/4 in one sitting. Rain Dish lets Ludicolo regain more health every turn, but Swift Swim can also be considered in order to make Ludicolo's Substitute go before virtually anything else. If your opponent does not have any way to take care of Ludicolo, such as hitting it with super effective moves, it can easily stall their team out. However, the timer pushes you to essentially a 15 turn clock, meaning you must use Ludicolo well to pull out a victory because of time.</p> <p>Although Ludicolo is generally designed for a rain team, this specific variant can actually be used to counter one as well. It takes advantage of the rain and is able to hit just about everything with Giga Drain, while Leech Seed, Leftovers, and Rain Dish make it almost impossible to KO without a super effective hit. It can also work well with other bulky Pokemon, such as Cresselia, which can hit opposing threats with Icy Wind, making them slower than Ludicolo. Last but not least, Ludicolo also fits perfectly into a rain team, offering a bulkier alternative rather than an offensive set.</p>"

  "Breloom": {
    "overview": "<p>High Attack, decent Speed, and access to the only 100% accurate sleep-inducing move instantly makes Breloom a force to be reckoned with. Its Fighting / Grass typing is a really great offensive typing, allowing Breloom to defeat 4 of the 5 Pokemon with weather-inducing abilities, though it opens it up to manhandling by Flying-types. Two great abilities further cement Breloom's status as a threat to any team in VGC 2012.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Slide can be used to dent Flying-types, though most Flying-types in VGC are faster and are able to wipe Breloom out anyway. Substitute used in tandem with Focus Punch, Spore, and Leech Seed could produce devastating results; though keeping a Substitute up for very long is often difficult in VGC. Sky Uppercut has greater power than Drain Punch and, unlike Focus Punch, doesn't require a turn to charge, although its low 90% accuracy and inability to restore HP keeps it from being a primary option. Brick Break is a gimmicky option if one is worried about the use of Reflect and Light Screen, but Drain Punch's healing powers outclass it in nearly all aspects.</p> <p>A set focusing on Speed could be utilized, where one would take the HP EVs and transfer them to Speed. Additionally, a Speed-reliant set would require the use of a Focus Sash, as the loss of HP would greatly decrease Breloom's ability to take a hit. If this is the case, Effect Spore should be used as the ability to provide a chance to incapacitate the opponent. A Choice Scarf could be utilized to allow Breloom to get off a fast Spore, although being forced to repeatedly use Spore on already sleeping targets is a rather unattractive option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Flying-types wall Breloom with ease, taking little from both of its STABs and hitting back hard with a 4x super effective Flying move. Zapdos and Tornadus are two of the main offenders; Tornadus utilizes Acrobatics and Zapdos, while rarely using a Flying-type move, has a super effective Heat Wave or Hidden Power Ice to destroy Breloom. Fire-types such as Chandelure and Arcanine counter Breloom as well; Chandelure takes no damage from Drain Punch and Arcanine neuters Breloom's strength with Intimidate while utilizing its STAB to burn Breloom to a crisp. Yanmega and other Bug-types are able to take on Breloom with their resistances to its moves and ability to hit hard with a STAB attack of their own. Abomasnow can KO Breloom with a STAB Blizzard, but it must be on the lookout for a super effective Fighting move headed its way. Latios takes anything Breloom can throw at it and OHKOes with a STAB Psychic-type move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spore": {
        "description": "<p>Spore is the only 100% accurate sleep move in Pokemon, and thus it forms the core of this set. With Spore, Breloom is able to incapacitate Pokemon with impunity. The lack of Sleep Clause allows Breloom to put an entire team to sleep. Seed Bomb gives Breloom a reliable STAB move, hitting common Pokemon such as Politoed and Gastrodon for super effective damage. Breloom has two move choices for its other STAB option. Drain Punch hits hard and restores Breloom's HP every time it hits, but Mach Punch has priority and can aid Breloom when it would normally move after the foe. Protect, a move commonly seen in VGC, shields Breloom from attacks for a turn and gives Breloom's partner a chance to dismantle a threat. Protect also activates Toxic Orb if used on the first turn.</p> <p>Toxic Orb paired with Poison Heal restores a great deal of Breloom's HP every turn, as well as keeping it immune to other status conditions. Breloom is not known for its Speed, so an Adamant nature is used to boost its Attack while its EVs maximize both its Attack and HP.</p> <p>Good teammates are crucial for Breloom; without them, it would struggle to stay alive. Pokemon that utilize Fake Out go well with Breloom. Weavile in particular is able to Fake Out opponents and give Breloom a chance to Spore them, as well as decimating the Flying-types that plague Breloom, such as Tornadus and Zapdos. Rock-types such as Tyranitar appreciate Breloom's ability to take out Water-type Pokemon while they aid Breloom via their strong Rock-type STAB, which scares off opposing Flying- and Fire-types. Choice Scarf Chandelure is a great teammate, denting Pokemon that counter Breloom such as Zapdos and Latios.</p>"

  "Ninjask": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite having the highest base Speed stat available in VGC and a decent Attack stat, Ninjask is barely used. This is partially because of its Bug / Flying typing which leaves Ninjask susceptible to common super effective Electric- and Rock-type attacks. It does not help that Ninjask has very low defenses either, but when played correctly, Ninjask can be very threatening. Ninjask also gets access to Speed Boost, which allows it to outspeed the majority of the metagame after a single boost.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If you find Ninjask too frail for your liking, it is possible to run a Focus Sash on it if you are afraid of Choice Scarf Pokemon or dying in one hit. However, this is not recommended as sand is very prevalent and will break the Focus Sash if you Protect, or the sand damage will KO Ninjask once the Focus Sash kicks in. Night Slash is also an option if you have problems with Ghost-type Pokemon, but non-STAB Night Slash is very weak against anything that it does not hit for super effective damage. Substitute can also be used in place of Protect, but it requires some prediction to be useful. Swords Dance is also an option if you feel that you need that extra boost, but this severely limits Ninjask's coverage, survivability, or both. For more experienced players, Final Gambit is also an option, but it is to be used with extreme caution. If you use this correctly, you can successfully take down big threats or take out a huge chunk of HP, but if you use it when they Protect, congratulations, you've just wasted your Ninjask.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ninjask does not have the best defensive typing, leaving it vulnerable to several common attacking types. Rock-types can easily come in on Ninjask and not be too worried about taking a lot of damage. Tyranitar for example can take a hit and KO Ninjask with a 4x super effective Rock Slide. Electric-types such as Thundurus and Eelektross can also easily take on Ninjask thanks to their resistance to Aerial Ace and immunity to Dig, as well as access to super effective STAB Electric-type moves with which to OHKO Ninjask. Chandelure also threatens Ninjask with Heat Wave and other Fire-type moves, but note that Ninjask still has a chance of killing Chandelure and other Fire-types with Dig. Defensive Pokemon such as Hitmontop, Metagross, and Heatran can counter Ninjask fairly easily, being able to take a hit or two. Trick Room also counters Ninjask since it is naturally fast, and Speed Boost will keep raising its Speed, causing Ninjask to be extremely slow in Trick Room. Focus Sash Abomasnow can also take a hit and KO Ninjask with a super effective Blizzard. Other generally bulky Pokemon, such as Dusclops and Cresselia, can also take Ninjask on with ease, and cripple it with Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Since Ninjask has such a high base Speed stat to begin with, minimal investment is needed to outspeed many common threats that do not use Choice Scarf. This allows you to invest in HP, to increase Ninjask's durability. X-Scissor is Ninjask's most useful move, netting a strong super effective hit on many common Pokemon, such as Cresselia, Latios, and Tyranitar. Bug Bite is also a very viable option to eat the opposing Pokemon's type resist or Sitrus Berry, and in the latter case, giving Ninjask back one quarter of its health. Aerial Ace is on the set to provide dual STAB and is super effective on certain Pokemon that resist its Bug-type STAB move, such as Hitmontop. Dig prevents Ninjask from being walled by Steel-types, such as Metagross or Heatran, that resist X-Scissor and Aerial Ace. However, Dig may require some prediction and is easily stopped by Protect so Baton Pass is also a viable option, allowing Ninjask to pass on a Speed Boost to another Pokemon that can handle big threats. In the last slot, Protect can be used to scout the opponent's moves, or to get a free Speed Boost and come out unscathed.</p> <p>Max Attack with an Adamant nature is a must, to deal out the greatest possible damage, and KO common threats. With an Adamant nature and minimal Speed investment, Ninjask is able to outspeed Latios and OHKO it with X-Scissor. The 252 HP EVs are mainly there to help Ninjask take hits. The EVs are very helpful when your opponent is using priority, as those moves would easily kill Ninjask if the HP EVs were not invested. Life Orb is used because Ninjask is easily countered without Protect, which it won't be able to use if Choice Band is the item of choice; another reason to use Life Orb is that Ninjask needs all the extra power it can get.</p> <p>Ninjask is not perfect and cannot carry an entire team on its back; it needs teammates, like any other Pokemon. When looking for teammates for Ninjask, note that many Steel-types effectively wall Ninjask, as do many Pokemon used on weather teams. One Pokemon that resists most of Ninjask's weaknesses is Gastrodon, which can also deal with Steel-type threats with its Ground-type STAB. Hitmontop is also a good partner since it can utilize its Intimidate ability to lower the opponent's Attack stat, and also resists Rock-type moves, especially Rock Slide. Hitmontop also has strong STAB Fighting-type moves that can deal with Pokemon that pose huge threats to Ninjask, such as Tyranitar.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Although its abysmal stats might suggest otherwise, Shedinja is a viable choice for any team in the VGC metagame thanks to its exclusive ability, Wonder Guard, which protects it from all attacks that aren't super effective. Unfortunately, Wonder Guard doesn't protect Shedinja from passive damage in the form of status or weather, and in conjunction with the fact that it has a maximum of 1 HP, this means that it is laughably easy to wipe Shedinja out if one has the required Pokemon on their team. Thus, it is somewhat of a gamble to use Shedinja, as it can become a dead weight in the blink of an eye. With careful planning and foresight, however, Shedinja is an effective tool against any opponent who lacks the weather and moves to hit it super effectively, and this merits its use on any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shedinja has a few other options for attacks, such as Night Slash instead of a Ghost-type attack. However, despite its superior type coverage, the lack of STAB, and priority, in the case of Shadow Sneak, make Night Slash an inferior choice in many situations. Sucker Punch is a reasonably powerful attack that has priority. However, because many opponents attempt to KO Shedinja through non-attacking means, Shadow Sneak is usually the better choice. Toxic can be used over Will-O-Wisp in order to damage Fire-type Pokemon that are immune to it; however, Will-O-Wisp carries the additional effect of halving your opponent's Attack stat, making it the superior option. Finally, a Choice Band set could be used, but it is much more vulnerable due to the fact that Shedinja does not carry Focus Sash, and cannot use Protect against unexpected moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As stated previously, one of the most effective ways to deal with Shedinja is to use a Pokemon with Sand Stream or Snow Warning, such as Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Abomasnow. The former two also carry super effective moves, making them excellent counters. However, one must be wary of the opponents who possess the ability to change the weather into a non-damaging one, such as Ninetales and Politoed, or even negate it, such as Lickilicky. The more common way to deal with Shedinja would be to simply use a super effective attack. With the plethora of Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame that carry Dark-, Fire-, Ghost-, Rock-, and Flying-type attacks, countering Shedinja is not an especially hard thing to do. Thus, when building a team, ensure that you have a few ways of checking Shedinja without lowering the overall effectiveness of the team.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Though Shedinja has a number of options available to it, it should only use physical attacks as it sports a dismal base 30 Special Attack stat. X-Scissor provides Shedinja with a strong STAB attack. Bug Bite can be very useful for removing annoying type-resist berries, but it comes with the downside of being weaker than X-Scissor. Shadow Sneak gives Shedinja a STAB priority attack, allowing it to finish off weakened foes. Protect is a must, because it allows Shedinja to scout the opponent's move, protecting it from a fatal blow while its teammate KOes the threat. The last move depends on Shedinja's teammates. If your team has enough control over the weather, you can run Swords Dance or Will-O-Wisp, both of which will help Shedinja deal with bulky Pokemon that would otherwise be troublesome for it. If you are afraid of an opponent switching in a Pokemon with Sand Stream or Snow Warning, however, Sunny Day is the better choice.</p> <p>The EV spread is very simple. 252 EVs in Attack and a boosting nature are used to maximize the power of Shedinja's attacks. The remaining EVs are put in Speed, since it is obviously a futile exercise to invest in Shedinja's defenses. A Lonely nature and 11 Defense IVs are used to ensure that Download users such as Porygon-Z do not get a Special Attack boost. However, if Shedinja is used in Trick Room, a Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs are used. For an item, Focus Sash is preferred, as it allows Shedinja to survive one super effective hit, but it does not protect it from status, Leech Seed, or weather conditions. Lum Berry can be used if you are particularly wary of being burned or poisoned, but unless you are concerned with a very specific threat to Shedinja, Focus Sash covers a broader range of situations.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Ninetales and Politoed are very effective teammates for Shedinja, as their Dream World abilities allow them to remove harmful weather conditions. Golduck and Lickilicky are also good for this reason, as their Cloud Nine ability negates the effects of weather. Other useful teammates depend on what coverage your team needs. If you plan to use Shedinja, have at least one way of dealing with the following popular checks to Shedinja: Zapdos, Tyranitar, Abomasnow, Hippowdon, Chandelure, Infernape, Heatran, Garchomp, Ninetales, Rhyperior, Scrafty, Terrakion, Togekiss, and Weavile. Several other Pokemon, such as Hitmontop and Toxicroak, will generally only have Sucker Punch as a way to hurt Shedinja, and can thus be successfully played around with proper prediction.</p>"

Its low base 50 Speed is a blessing under Trick Room, which its teammate will have an easier time setting up first turn thanks to Hariyama's Fake Out flinching one opponent. Above average 144 / 60 / 60 defenses ensure that Hariyama won't be easily KOed before its partner can set up. All of these traits make it the perfect candidate for a Fake Out user on a Trick Room team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stone Edge hits a lot harder than either Ice Punch or Rock Slide, but its 80% accuracy is a bit shaky, and the extra power is unnecessary after a Guts boost. Nonetheless, Stone Edge would help greatly against bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Cresselia, Musharna, Reuniclus, Dusclops, and Jellicent. Payback could be used to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types harder, but Hariyama will rarely be moving last in Trick Room. Bullet Punch is a less specific priority option. Hariyama learns Fire Punch and Thunder Punch, but neither gains any notable coverage. Facade could be used to hit Flying- and Psychic-types hard, but if used with only Close Combat, Hariyama will have no way of hitting Ghost-types. Feint Attack could be used to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively and never miss, but the added power is insignificant. Payback gets the same 2HKOs, which may turn into OHKOs if Hariyama is attacked first. Low Kick has more PP than Close Combat, and can be used to do a lot of damage to Pokemon such as Metagross, Rhyperior, and Tyranitar without the stat drops. However, it will not hit all Pokemon with 120 Base Power, so it is not as reliable as Close Combat. For example, Low Kick misses out on OHKOs against common threats such as Hitmontop, Politoed, and Ninetales. Earthquake is another move Hariyama can learn which hits both opponents, but Ice Punch and Rock Slide give better coverage.</p> <p>Hariyama can support its teammates with Helping Hand, but it is better off all-out attacking, and the job of using Helping Hand is usually done better by more defensive Pokemon. Hariyama can learn Belly Drum, but will have trouble setting it up in a 2v2 battle. Thick Fat can be used to resist Fire- and Ice-type moves such as Heat Wave and Blizzard, but the drop in power is significant, and Hariyama already takes hits well enough. Hariyama's Dream World ability, Sheer Force, boosts the power of moves that have secondary effects by 30%. Examples of such moves would include Ice Punch and Rock Slide, but not Close Combat, which is Hariyama's main attacking move, so Guts would be the better option. A Payapa Berry or Coba Berry could be used, but with the former, Hariyama will often not be able to KO the Psychic-type in the extra turn it gains, and with the latter, Hariyama will not hit hard enough to OHKO a 4/0 Tornadus unless it chooses to run Stone Edge.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Hariyama has a lot of trouble dealing with bulky Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon, as it cannot hit them hard enough to do any significant damage, so Musharna, Cresselia, Jellicent, Reuniclus, Dusknoir, and Dusclops counter Hariyama very well. Latios and Latias can take a Rock Slide and hit Hariyama back with Psyshock, Psychic, or Draco Meteor, which will often KO it after burn damage. However, they have to watch out for Ice Punch, which will OHKO them. Pokemon who can use priority moves, such as Hitmontop and Metagross, can take advantage of Close Combat defense drops and residual burn damage to finish off Hariyama. Outside of Trick Room, anything that outspeeds Hariyama and has a STAB super effective move, such as Tornadus, can often OHKO it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The purpose of this set is for Hariyama to use Fake Out on turn 1 in order to assist its partner in setting up Trick Room. Subsequently, the Flame Orb will have burned Hariyama, activating Guts and giving Hariyama a 1.5x boost in Attack, bringing its Attack stat to 283.</p> <p>A Guts-boosted Close Combat hits everything that does not resist it for huge amounts of damage. Ice Punch can OHKO Latias, Latios, Thundurus, and Tornadus while giving Hariyama great neutral coverage. Rock Slide targets both opponents, and hits Pokemon such as Chandelure, Jellicent, and Volcarona for more damage. Rock Slide also allows Hariyama to damage Shedinja. It should be noted that a neutral Close Combat is more powerful than a 2x effective Rock Slide or Ice Punch, and a resisted Close Combat does more damage than a neutral Rock Slide or Ice Punch.</p> <p>Hariyama can use Detect to allow it to survive for an extra turn, while Wide Guard can be used to protect your team from multi-target attacks, such as Blizzard, Rock Slide, Heat Wave, and Earthquake. However, because of Egg move restrictions, Wide Guard and Ice Punch are incompatible.</p> <p>The 252 Attack EVs and a Brave nature allow Hariyama to do as much damage as possible, while the remaining EVs are split between Defense and Special Defense to maximize Hariyama's bulk.</p> <p>A Flame Orb is the best item for this set, but a Toxic Orb could be used if a teammate is running Flame Orb, or if you don't think Hariyama will be staying in for more than 3 turns. A Flame Orb is necessary because first, without the Guts boost, Hariyama will miss out on a lot of OHKOs, and second, burn gives Hariyama an immunity to status from the likes of Amoonguss. Furthermore, resist berries do not work too well with Hariyama because it will usually be attacking under Trick Room and will often KO the opponent before it gets to attack.</p> <p>Hariyama pairs very well with bulky Trick Room users such as Dusclops, Cresselia, and Musharna. The Trick Room users appreciate only having to take one hit when trying to set up, or even avoid being Taunted or Imprisoned thanks to Fake Out. Hariyama can also take out Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Scrafty for them. Dusclops, Cresselia, and Musharna can also use Helping Hand to boost Hariyama's power to even higher levels. Chandelure is another good partner for Hariyama as it can not only set up Trick Room, but also use Shadow Ball to beat the Psychic- and Ghost-types with whom Hariyama has trouble.</p>"

  "Sableye": {
    "overview": "<p>With the introduction of BW, Sableye was blessed with an incredible ability: Prankster. With no weaknesses, its excellent typing makes it deceptively bulky and easy to fit on any team. Its typing also grants it immunities to Fighting-, Psychic-, and Normal-type attacks. Sableye is the only Prankster Pokemon that has access to Will-O-Wisp, allowing it to shut down offensive threats before they get a chance to attack; it also has access to a wide variety of support moves such as Trick, Recover, and Taunt. Offensively, Sableye learns Sucker Punch, which can 2HKO several common Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Latios and Chandelure, even with no investment in Attack. However, Sableye also suffers from many issues. Will-O-Wisp, its main move, has shaky accuracy and a miss can spell disaster. To make matters worse, Sableye also has poor defensive stats and cannot take too many hits. Specially based Pokemon that are not weak to Sucker Punch, such as Zapdos and Abomasnow, do not care about being burned, and can wall Sableye with ease. Nonetheless, although Sableye suffers from several problems, it is still an excellent addition to any team with its unique typing and movepool.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sableye has access to several other helpful moves, namely Taunt, Feint, Sunny Day, Rain Dance, and Confuse Ray. Taunt is useful in shutting down walls such as Cresselia and Amoonguss, but risks being stopped by Mental Herb. Feint breaks though Protect and partners well with strong sweepers such as Latios. Sunny Day or Rain Dance can be used either with a team that relies on weather or to counter weather teams should your team have trouble with them. Sableye can also use Confuse Ray to confuse all the opposing Pokemon, reducing their ability to attack. However, all of these moves are rather situational and are generally not as useful as those on the main set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Sableye has a hard time against Fire-types, as they are not affected by Will-O-Wisp. Sucker Punch also does little damage to all of them bar Chandelure. Heatran in particular can easily switch in on Will-O-Wisp and get a Flash Fire boost, is barely dented by Sucker Punch, and can retaliate for tremendous damage. Other Fire-types, such as Infernape and Arcanine, can easily wall Sableye. As Sableye is so frail, strong STAB attacks from both your Pokemon will often KO it in a turn. However, Sableye can threaten to Trick a Lagging Tail before it faints, often rendering sweepers useless. Nevertheless, sweepers that are already slow, such as Tyranitar and Metagross, are not affected too much by this. Pokemon with the Guts ability, such as Hariyama and Heracross, do not mind being burned. In fact, they often carry Flame Orb, which would burn Sableye if it decides to Trick.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Prankster": {
        "description": "<p>This set utilizes Sableye to its full potential as a support Pokemon, by letting it assist its partner with moves such as Fake Out, while threatening to KO foes with Sucker Punch. Fake Out is an extremely helpful move that allows Sableye to break Focus Sashes and to disrupt set-ups. Sucker Punch hits Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Latios and Chandelure, for massive damage, 2HKOing them. It also provides Sableye with an attacking move if it is ever Taunted. Priority Will-O-Wisp hampers physical sweepers, including Garchomp, Hitmontop, Metagross, Scizor, Tyranitar, and Terrakion. However, be wary of priority attacks, such as Scizor's Bullet Punch, as they will hit Sableye very hard before Sableye is able to burn their users. Will-O-Wisp also helps out by wearing down bulky Pokemon, such as Cresselia and Amoonguss. The last move is based off item choice and preference. If Lagging Tail is used, Trick can easily shut down one of your opponent's Pokemon by forcing them to move last, as well as by stealing their item. Not only does it reduce their attacking abilities, it also often steals helpful items such as Focus Sashes and type resist Berries. Detect is generally a useful move to have to protect Sableye from threats while its partner takes it out. Recover, on the other hand, allows Sableye to heal half of its HP but leaves it vulnerable to attacks.</p> <p>Maximum Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature lets Sableye better tank special attacks, as most physical threats will be neutered by Will-O-Wisp. If Trick is not your cup of tea, Leftovers is a great alternative to allow Sableye to survive on the field longer. Sableye partners well with any sweeper who can take advantage of the disruption it provides. For example, slow sweepers such as Hydreigon, Tyranitar, and Metagross appreciate Sableye Tricking a Lagging Tail to slow down faster opponents. Sableye also partners well with fast and fragile sweepers that dread physical attacks, such as Latios.</p>"

  "Aron": {
    "overview": "<p>With Sturdy now acting as a permanent Focus Sash, Aron becomes an interesting option for performing a FEAR strategy. While it may not have as many support options as Whimsicott or Smeargle have, its immunity to Sandstorm and freedom to choose its own held item differentiate Aron from the other Level 1 Pokemon that Endeavor for success.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to Aron being at level 1, its options are limited to non-damaging attacks. Sandstorm is a good way for Aron to counter Hail. Screech and Metal Sound can be used to weaken an opposing Pokemon's defenses, allowing a partner to deal more damage. Lastly, Swagger can be used to try to disrupt the opponent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>There are many ways to deal with a Level 1 Aron. Abomasnow can summon up Hail, damaging Aron through residual damage and rendering Sturdy worthless. Ghost-type Pokemon are immune to Endeavor, but should still watch out for Toxic, Metal Sound, or Screech. Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs can mess up Aron, but it would require Ferrothorn to be hit with Endeavor first. Multi-hit moves such as Rock Blast or Icicle Spear can KO Aron. Lastly, Pokemon with Mold Breaker ignore Sturdy and OHKO Aron with any attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Level 1 Sturdy": {
        "description": "<p>Endeavor strikes at opponents, leaving them at an inch of their health and at the mercy of weaker attacks, such as Bullet Punch or Rock Slide. Toxic gives Aron something to use against Ghost-types, or targets struck by Endeavor. Sleep Talk allows Aron to continue to act if put to sleep, although admittedly it is not very reliable. Protect is vital, as the presence of Aron pressures the opponent to throw attacks towards it. Protect also stops Fake Out from ruining Aron's usefulness.</p> <p>As Aron is at Level 1, its Nature, EVs and IVs are largely irrelevant. Its HP is always 12, and its Speed can be either 4, 5, or 6. If, for some reason, it's really important that Aron can outrun a paralyzed Ferrothorn or other Aron, then 36 Speed EVs with a neutral Speed nature will allow Aron to have 6 Speed. Aron's held item, Berry Juice, recovers 20 HP when Aron is below half health, essentially requiring 3 hits to KO Aron. Because Aron will not go down to a double-targeting from the opponent, it can be surprisingly effective even outside of Trick Room. Alternatively, a Shell Bell can be used over Berry Juice, allowing Aron to replenish its HP to full whenever it hits an opponent with Endeavor. This can make Aron extremely tough to take out under the influence of Trick Room.</p> <p>Aron dislikes Hail, so having a teammate that can change the weather is appreciated. Tyranitar and Hippowdon in particular are useful, as Sandstorm can finish off those hit with Endeavor. However, it will take two turns for a Pokemon hit with Endeavor to faint unless they have at least 192 HP. Pokemon with priority moves are useful alongside Aron, as they can pick off crippled targets. Feint users are especially useful as they can strike through an opponent's Protect to finish them off. Pokemon such as Metagross or Hitmontop are helpful priority users, but some Pokemon that are lesser known for priority attacks, such as Togekiss, Gallade, and Infernape, can work well too. Supportive Pokemon that have Follow Me or Fake Out can help Aron last longer to try to land more Endeavors on the opponent. Lastly, Trick Room allows Aron to move first, turning it into a major threat.</p>"

  "Medicham": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Medicham might look like a mediocre Pokemon. It only has base 60 attacking stats, as well as a rather average base 80 Speed. However, Medicham has an ability that makes it different from other Fighting-type Pokemon: Pure Power. Pure Power raises Medicham's attacking power to insane levels, and with a great offensive typing and coverage options, Medicham makes a great physical attacker. Another merit that separates Medicham from other Fighting-type Pokemon is that it is resistant to Fighting-type attacks due to its Psychic typing, making for a decent check to other Fighting-type Pokemon. Medicham is also the only Fighting-type Pokemon other than Gallade to receive Trick, and with such offensive capability, it can use Choice items to great effect. However, Pure Power isn't enough to make Medicham unbeatable; 65 / 75 / 75 defenses aren't helping Medicham take many hits. To add to Medicham's flaws, base 80 Speed is only average, making it slower than Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Latios, both of which can OHKO Medicham. The fact that its only STAB priority attack, Vacuum Wave, is specially based is another flaw in Medicham's resume. However, Medicham is a Pokemon that has all the tools it needs to succeed, so not preparing for it will cause grief for your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Medicham has an expansive movepool, but sadly, there are few other moves it can use that don't make it outclassed by other Pokemon. Support-wise, Helping Hand is an option to increase the power of an ally's attack by 50%, though Medicham has better things to be doing. A dual screens set might look usable due to Medicham's decent defensive typing, but there are other Pokemon that have much better bulk or Speed, such as Musharna and Latias, respectively, that can pull it off better. Gravity increases Hi Jump Kick's accuracy, making it a bit more usable. Telepathy is a good ability for doubles, but Medicham is outclassed in this regard by Musharna and even Gardevoir, making Telepathy useless on it. Its main merit is Pure Power anyways, and not using it limits Medicham's effectiveness.</p> <p>Bullet Punch gives Medicham some kind of physical priority, but it doesn't receive STAB and is fairly weak, as well as providing little coverage against Pokemon that trouble Medicham. Feint can be used to break Protects and Detects, making it easier for its ally to attack, but it takes up a moveslot, which is risky for Medicham. Fire Punch deals more damage to Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Scizor, but that's about it. Medicham's other Fighting-type STAB options, Force Palm and Low Sweep, are usable to either lower the opponents' Speed or paralyze them, helping both Medicham and its partner. However, Medicham needs the power of either Drain Punch or Low Kick to really be effective. A set with Endure and Reversal might look decent, but because pinch Berries are not yet released, it isn't as good in practice as it is on paper. Finally, Medicham can use a Fighting Gem to increase the power of its Fighting-type STAB attack to insane levels. For example, Medicham can OHKO 252 / 0 Metagross with a Fighting Gem-boosted Hi Jump Kick!</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>One can look at Medicham's ability and think it must be impossible to beat; however, there are countless Pokemon that can give it problems. Spiritomb and Sableye are immune to both of Medicham's STABs, making them great counters. They also have Will-O-Wisp to cripple Medicham for the remainder of the game. Shedinja walls Medicham completely unless Medicham is running Rock Slide. Bulky Psychic-type Pokemon, such as Cresselia and Latias, make great checks, as they resist both STAB attacks and can cripple Medicham with Thunder Wave. A well-timed Trick can screw over all of the aforementioned Pokemon, however, so be wary of that when facing Medicham. Faster Pokemon such as Gengar, Latios, and Tornadus can just OHKO Medicham before it can attack, though a surprise attack from the Choice Scarf set will be a problem for those Pokemon as well. A nice measure to keep Medicham in check is Trick Room, as Medicham often tries to be as fast as possible.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Pure Power!": {
        "description": "<p>This set showcases Medicham's Pure Power ability, and even though it has no coverage moves, its STAB moves alone are enough to cause problems for your opponent. Fake Out helps teammates by making a Pokemon useless for one turn, which can be crucial as the battle wears on. The choice of Psychic-type STAB move is one of power or accuracy; Psycho Cut is reliable, only slightly weaker than Zen Headbutt, and also has an increased critical hit rate. However, Zen Headbutt has a nice flinch rate, which Medicham can take advantage of thanks to its decent Speed. If you thought the choice of Psychic-type STAB was hard, picking a Fighting-type STAB move can be even harder. However, each attack plays a different role for Medicham. Drain Punch works great alongside Life Orb as it heals Medicham after use, which can help to cancel out Life Orb recoil. Low Kick is another great STAB option, hitting the heavier Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame, such as Tyranitar and Metagross, quite effectively. If one likes a high-risk, high-reward strategy, Hi Jump Kick is a perfect move to use. Even though it has a costly 50% recoil if it misses (or hits a Pokemon that has used Protect), a Base Power of 130 is hard to ignore, especially as it is considerably more powerful than both Low Kick and Drain Punch. Detect rounds off the set, allowing Medicham to stay in the fight for longer, as well as being effective even if the opponent uses Imprison.</p> <p>The EVs provided give Medicham as much Speed as possible. The Attack EVs give Medicham as much power as is possible, making it deadly alongside Pure Power. While most base 80 Speed Pokemon use a neutral Speed nature, Medicham uses Jolly to outspeed all neutral-natured base 92 Speed Pokemon and below, which includes key Pokemon such as Krookodile, Rotom-A, and Toxicroak. However, if one is looking for more power, an Adamant nature can still work, as Medicham will still Speed tie with other neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon.</p> <p>After reading about how powerful Medicham is with Pure Power, you probably need some evidence of how powerful Medicham really is. Therefore, the calcs below showcase Medicham against common VGC 2012 threats. All of the calcs below are with Medicham using a Jolly nature and a Life Orb:</p> <ul> <li>Low Kick vs. 252/0 Metagross 68.4% - 80.8%</li> <li>Hi Jump Kick vs. 252/0 Metagross 73.6% - 86.8%</li> <li>Drain Punch vs. 252/0 Togekiss 54.5% - 64.4%</li> <li>Hi Jump Kick vs. 252/0 Togekiss 93.9% - 110.7%</li> <li>Drain Punch vs. 252/0 Politoed 64.1% - 75.3%</li> <li>Hi Jump Kick vs. 252/0 Politoed 110.4% - 130.5%</li> <li>Low Kick vs. 4/0 Garchomp 60.6% - 71.5%</li> <li>Hi Jump Kick vs. 4/0 Garchomp 98% - 115.6%</li> <li>Drain Punch vs. 252/0 Rotom-W 60.5% - 71.4%</li> <li>Hi Jump Kick vs. 252/0 Rotom-W 104.6% - 123.4%</li> <li>Zen Headbutt vs. 140/0 Zapdos 66.6% - 78.7%</li> </ul> <p>While the moves provided give Medicham the ideal moveset, they are changeable due to the immense number of coverage moves Medicham has. Ice Punch hits Flying-type Pokemon that resist Medicham's Fighting-type STAB move, such as Zapdos and Togekiss. It also has the added bonus of hitting Dragon-type Pokemon, such as Garchomp and Haxorus, for super effective damage. ThunderPunch not only nails Flying-type Pokemon, but also hits Water-type Pokemon such as Politoed and Jellicent, the latter being especially important as it is immune to Medicham's Fighting-type STAB attacks. Finally, Rock Slide is an option as it, again, hits Flying-type Pokemon, while it also gives Medicham a spread attack to use; however, it hits weaker than the elemental punches when spread attack mechanics are factored in.</p> <p>Medicham has problems against two types of Pokemon: Ghost and Flying. As such, Pokemon that can get rid of Ghost- and Flying-type Pokemon make great teammates. Dark-type Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Krookodile can get rid of Ghost-types, while Medicham clears Fighting-type Pokemon that give them trouble. Likewise, Electric-type Pokemon also make great partners, so Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Zapdos can all work out fine. Also, as Fake Out is prone to making the opponent double Protect, Pokemon with Substitute make great partners, as they can use Substitute while the opponent blocks the Fake Out.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>While Choice item users are few and far between, Medicham fills the role exceptionally. One of the reasons for this is the fact that Medicham gains Trick, which means it can potentially cripple another Pokemon for the rest of the match. Medicham hits 198 Speed with a Choice Scarf and an Adamant nature, and 218 with Jolly, which remedies its Speed problem. Likewise, a Choice Band can be used, as Pure Power in conjunction with a Choice Band means total devastation if played right. Drain Punch is the reliable STAB attack for this set, as it not only heals Medicham after every use, but it also hits light Pokemon, such as Rotom-W, for solid damage. However, Low Kick can be used as it hits heavier Pokemon such as Terrakion and Metagross harder than Drain Punch, though beware of lighter Pokemon if locked into Low Kick. Again, the choice of Psychic-type STAB attack is between reliability and power. Psycho Cut is more accurate than Zen Headbutt, but Zen Headbutt works great with a Choice Scarf as Medicham can make use of the flinch rate even more so due to an increase in Speed. The third moveslot is another personal preference. Ice Punch hits Dragon- and Flying-type Pokemon; however, Rock Slide gives Medicham a spread attack that keeps good coverage with its Fighting-type STAB. Trick can screw over defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia and Musharna.</p> <p>The EVs given for this set are standard for a physical attacker. However, they are important, as they allow Medicham to hit as hard and as fast as possible. The choice of nature is dependent on the item; with a Choice Scarf, an Adamant nature is preferred as it allows Medicham to retain as much power as possible while still outspeeding common VGC Pokemon such as Latios and Weavile. However, if one decides to use a Choice Band, Jolly is the main nature, as Choice Band will provide more than enough power for Medicham to forgo an Attack-boosting nature.</p> <p>Like the non-Choice set, Medicham can change its moveset to tailor to one's needs. Hi Jump Kick is usable for its sheer power, but be wary of Protect and Ghost-type Pokemon, as Medicham can't switch attacks while using a Choice item. To make matters worse, because most players double Protect expecting a Fake Out, using Hi Jump Kick on the first turn usually results in disastrous consequences. ThunderPunch can also work on this set, though Ice Punch and Rock Slide work better in most situations.</p> <p>The first thing one should notice while observing this set is that it has no way of protecting itself. As such, this set needs more support than the non-Choice set. Follow Me from Togekiss and Lucario, Rage Powder from Jumpluff and Amoonguss, and Fake Out support all work, as they buy Medicham time to use its attacks or to Trick its Choice item onto another Pokemon. Aside from that, Pokemon that can clear the field of Flying- and Ghost-type Pokemon make great partners. Dark-type Pokemon, such as Honchkrow and Houndoom, make great teammates, as they can use their Dark-type STAB attacks to clear Ghost-types, as well as having priority in Sucker Punch to remove threats to Choice Scarf Medicham. Electric-type Pokemon, such as the Rotom formes and Zapdos, clear Flying-type Pokemon from the field, while Medicham's Fighting-type STAB clears Rock-types.</p>"

  "Manectric": {
    "overview": "<p>Manectric is an underdog among Electric-types due to its rather shallow special movepool and average Special Attack. However, its base 105 Speed enables it to outspeed a majority of the threats in VGC. Lightning Rod gives it an immunity to Electric-type moves and a Special Attack boost when hit by them, allowing Manectric to defend its teammates from threats such as Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Thundurus, by drawing away their STAB moves. What sets Manectric apart from most Electric-types is its access to Flamethrower and Overheat, which allows it to punish most Steel- and Grass-types. While 70 / 60 / 60 defenses seem unappealing, it's a very underrated Pokemon and should not be overlooked as a threat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder is viable as Lightning Rod makes Manectric a good choice for rain teams, but Overheat and Flamethrower become almost unusable. Switcheroo can be useful for Tricking a Choice item onto a support Pokemon and shutting it down. Signal Beam deals slightly more damage to Latios, Latias, and Hydreigon and has a slight chance of confusion, but Hidden Power Ice or Grass are useful for checking Ground-types with dual typings, such as Garchomp, Gliscor, and Gastrodon. Air Balloon is useful as it gives Manectric an immunity to Ground-type moves as long as it does not get attacked, but its abysmal defenses means it'll be OHKOed by most neutral attacks anyway. Magnet Rise works like Air Balloon and allows Manectric to hold another item, but it only lasts for 5 turns. Electric or Fire Gem can be used to power up Thunderbolt or Overheat respectively, but Life Orb is better as it boosts all of Manectric's attacks consistently.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The best checks to Manectric are powerful attackers which can either outspeed it or tank its attacks. Tyranitar shrugs off all of Manectric's attacks with ease, and can hit back very hard with STAB Crunch or Rock Slide. Rotom-H resists all of Manectric's moves and can deal heavy damage with STAB Overheat. Special tanks such as Blissey and Snorlax are barely scratched by Manectric, and can wear it down with Seismic Toss and Body Slam, respectively. Yache Berry Garchomp and Landorus are not OHKOed by Hidden Power Ice, and can destroy Manectric with STAB Earthquake; they need to play cautiously if Manectric has an intact Air Balloon, however. Excadrill has no qualms about outspeeding and OHKOing Manectric with Earthquake in the sand, but Manectric can still survive the hit with Focus Sash and KO back with Flamethrower or Overheat. Lastly, Trick Room teams can exploit Manectric's high Speed and put it at a huge disadvantage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Thunderbolt is Manectric's most reliable STAB move, and also has a useful paralysis chance. Overheat destroys most Grass- and Steel-types, but the drop in Special Attack drastically reduces Manectric's offensive clout, meaning Flamethrower is a viable alternative; it is much weaker, but is more reliable as it maintains its Base Power and still does reasonable damage to the aforementioned Grass- and Steel-types. Hidden Power Ice is the preferred option for the third moveslot as it provides valuable coverage on Dragon- and Ground-types, but Hidden Power Grass can be used so that Manectric isn't walled cold by Gastrodon. Protect is, as always, helpful in VGC as it enables Manectric to save itself from an attack, provide an opening for your partner, or scout for whatever move your opponent will use.</p> <p>Due to Manectric's frailty, Focus Sash is the item of choice as it guarantees that Manectric will be able to attack for at least two turns, but Life Orb is usable if you prefer the extra power it delivers. The EV spread simply maximizes Manectric's Special Attack and Speed, with a Timid nature being used as it allows Manectric to outpace a majority of threats in VGC, such as Garchomp, but you can run Modest if you prefer the extra power and have a means of countering these fast threats. In case you decide to use Hidden Power Grass, you should shift 4 EVs from Special Attack to Defense to compensate for a Special Attack IV of 30, as 248 Special Attack EVs round up to the same Special Attack value as it would if it had 252 EVs. Also, the extra 4 EVs in Defense gives Manectric a slightly better chance of surviving most priority moves.</p> <p>Lightning Rod is useful for teams that are weak to Electric-types and Thunder Wave, as Manectric can draw their STAB moves toward itself for a free special attack boost. Due to this benefit, Water- and Flying-types such as Gyarados enjoy having Manectric as a partner, as its presence eliminates one of their main weaknesses, while they can in return aid Manectric by clearing out the Ground- and Grass-types that give it trouble. You can also pair up Manectric with a Volt Absorb user such as Jolteon, and they can both spam Discharge to benefit each other while having a good chance to paralyze both targets. Thundurus makes a good partner too as it is immune to Ground-type attacks, and by being faster than Manectric, it can use Discharge to give Manectric a Lightning Rod boost before it moves. Zapdos makes a good partner as well for the same reason, but it also has access to Tailwind to ensure that both Manectric and itself can outspeed faster threats such as Terrakion, Thundurus, and Latios.</p>"

  "Wailord": {
    "overview": "<p>Wailord isn't as big of a threat as it looks, but it is certainly a force to be reckoned with. Its stat distribution is good, with decent bulk and reasonable offense, but poor Speed. The only niche it has is its access to Water Spout, and it is an excellent one: a full-HP rain-boosted Water Spout can OHKO or 2HKO pretty much every Pokemon in the metagame. Wailord's support options are lacking, but its powerful Water Spout helps to make up for that. All in all, Wailord has its pros and cons, and can be useful on a rain or Trick Room team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wailord has a few other sets that it can pull off effectively. If you're looking for a fast Pokemon to spam Water Spout on a rain team, Choice Scarf Wailord is a viable option. Wailord doesn't have the best defenses, but it can take hits reasonably well thanks to its enormous base 170 HP, making a more defensive set viable. If you plan on using Wailord on a hail team, Blizzard should be used over Ice Beam. Life Orb and Water Gem are also two other items to consider. Life Orb gives Wailord a much appreciated power boost, but Water Spout will decrease in power thanks to recoil damage; alternatively, Water Gem- and rain-boosted Water Spout OHKOes almost all Pokemon in the metagame. Wailord also has a decent base 90 Attack stat, allowing it to utilize a Choice Band set with Waterfall, Double-Edge, Earthquake, and Selfdestruct. Hidden Power Grass and Hidden Power Electric can be used over Protect to hit opposing Water-types. Additionally, Wailord can set up Rain Dance on its own, so it is a viable option over Protect. Selfdestruct can be used as a reasonably powerful last-ditch attack, but it's generally not powerful enough to be really useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Sun teams make Water Spout pitifully weak, and the common Chlorophyll users are able to do huge damage to Wailord with their STAB Grass-type attacks. However, in Trick Room, Wailord can outspeed and OHKO most Chlorophyll users with Ice Beam. Priority moves can be problematic for Wailord, as they can do significant damage to it before it attacks, reducing Water Spout's Base Power. Water Absorb Jellicent is the best counter to Wailord as it regains health when hit by Water-type moves and resists Ice Beam. Dry Skin Toxicroak can also take anything Wailord has to offer and retaliate with priority Fake Out and Sucker Punch, or restore its own HP with Drain Punch. Taunt users such as Tornadus can stop Wailord's teammates from setting up Trick Room. Ferrothorn is another notable counter as it resists both of Wailord's moves and can sap large amounts of health from Wailord with Leech Seed, or do huge damage with Power Whip. Almost all bulky Water-types, Lanturn and Milotic to name a few, can wall Wailord.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>While Wailord possesses decent offenses and defenses, it lacks Speed. With Trick Room set up by a teammate, though, Wailord will be able to outspeed almost all Pokemon in non-Trick Room teams and do massive damage with Water Spout. Water Spout is a powerful STAB move that should only be used when Wailord is at or close to full HP. Surf and Hydro Pump are less powerful STAB attacks that can do good damage when Wailord's HP is too low for Water Spout to be effective. Surf hits all Pokemon on the field, including its teammates, which can work well if Wailord has a teammate with Dry Skin or Water Absorb. Hydro Pump is more powerful but less accurate, and hits only one Pokemon on the field. Protect should be used on the first turn to conserve HP, while a teammate sets up Trick Room. This ensures that Wailord will outpace almost all Pokemon during the next four turns, allowing it to freely spam its powerful moves. Ice Beam 2HKOes most common Dragon-types, such as Latios and Dragonite, that might try to come in on a resisted Water-type move.</p> <p>Wacan Berry reduces the amount of damage Wailord takes from Electric-type moves, allowing it to take a Thunderbolt from Zapdos or Thundurus, and hit back with a super effective Ice Beam. Sitrus Berry is another option as it gives Wailord some extra health to boost the power of Water Spout. The EV spread used is fairly simple; it maximizes Wailord's Special Attack and Special Defense, allowing Wailord to take special Grass- and Electric-type attacks more easily, as well as hit opposing Pokemon hard. A Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs make Wailord as slow as possible, meaning that it will be blindingly fast when Trick Room is up. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD can be used to increase Wailord's overall bulk. As for teammates, Politoed is an amazing choice, as it can summon permanent rain to boost Water Spout. In addition, teammates that can set up Trick Room, such as Bronzong, Musharna, and Cresselia are a must, as this set is only meant to be used under Trick Room conditions. Musharna is an amazing partner due to its immunity to Surf through Telepathy. Lightningrod Rhyperior is also a great teammate, as it can absorb all Electric-type attacks aimed at Wailord.</p>"

  "Camerupt": {
    "overview": "<p>In single battles, Camerupt has a very hard time getting anywhere due to its low Speed and sub-par defenses. But due to the rising effectiveness of Trick Room in the VGC 2012 metagame, Camerupt has received a new lease on life. See those volcanoes on Camerupt's back? They serve a very clear purpose: Camerupt is the best Eruption user for Trick Room teams. Boasting a reasonable 105 base Base Special Attack and low Speed, this fiery camel should find a good spot on any Trick Room team, though it requires some support to be effective, seeing how it is, as mentioned, very slow and frail.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A completely different EV spread can be effectively run with Camerupt, with 252 EVs in Attack instead of HP. This way, it can use Rock Slide and Explosion, two very effective moves. If you are afraid that Camerupt won't be able to shoot off its most powerful Eruption, Flamethrower or Fire Blast can either replace or complement it, though note that these moves provide greater accuracy, they lack the power and potential that Eruption carries. Focus Sash can also be used if you truly want to be sure about Camerupt's survival.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>When not paired with Gastrodon, Camerupt is soundly beaten by rain teams. In general, Water-types such as Gyarados and Kingdra make great checks to Camerupt, as they will only take neutral damage from Camerupt and can OHKO it with their STAB attacks. Aqua Jet users such as Azumarill also end Camerupt's reign abruptly. Tyranitar also gives Camerupt trouble, comfortably sponging Earth Power with its excellent special bulk and hitting it with a super effective Earthquake. Teams meant to specifically counter Trick Room also shut down Camerupt, as spamming Eruption becomes nearly impossible with its low Speed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Camerupt's main move on this set is Eruption. Boasting a massive 150 Base Power not including STAB, Eruption OHKOes almost any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, and with the boost from Fire Gem, few threats will be able to soak it up. The other main STAB move is Earth Power; it lacks the raw power of Eruption but it can get rid of Heatran, Chandelure, and other Fire- or Rock-types in Camerupt's way. Hidden Power Ice allows Camerupt to counter Salamence, non-Yache Berry Garchomp, and Hydreigon. Heat Wave is also highly recommended as it is a nice backup STAB, however, in case Camerupt has already taken large damage. Protect needs no explanation; Camerupt is pretty frail and it needs a move to stick around while allowing its partner to take out a threat.</p> <p>Solid Rock is the chosen ability because having a little extra resistance to Earthquakes is always appreciated, but note that almost any Water-type move will end Camerupt right there and then. The EV spread maximizes Camerupt's HP and Special Attack, giving it optimum bulk and firepower. Camerupt works better as a third or fourth choice than as a lead; without the absolutely necessary Trick Room, it's far too slow to ever use Eruption. Bread-and-butter Trick Room leads such as Cresselia, Musharna, and Bronzong can set up the said move, and are also bulky enough to help Camerupt when it switches in. Outside of the mentioned Pokemon, however, the best partner for Camerupt is probably Gastrodon. Gastrodon draws Water-type attacks such as Surf and Water Spout away from Camerupt, putting a major monkey wrench in the opponent's plans, and also makes Ground-type moves Camerupt's only weakness. Anything that can counter a rain team, such as Tyranitar or Hippowdon, also helps out tremendously. Camerupt works well in a sun team as its Eruption can become even more powerful, but this is difficult because it absolutely needs a Trick Room supporter.</p>"

  "Cacturne": {
    "overview": "<p>Cacturne is certainly an odd Pokemon in VGC. With base 115 Attack and Special Attack, its stats are geared towards offense, but its low defenses cause it to take damage as hard as it can deal it out. Its base 55 Speed is fairly low, but can be seen as a blessing in disguise: it can be effective both in and out of Trick Room based on how its Speed is managed. Cacturne's unique Grass / Dark typing, along with Sand Veil and Water Absorb as abilities, gives it several niche roles on teams. Potentially usable in rain, sand, and Trick Room, this cactus can become dangerous if underestimated.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cacturne has a number of support moves to choose from, though it doesn't necessarily have the stats to use them effectively. Taunt is useful for stopping Trick Room and for forcing opponents to switch out or get hit with Sucker Punch. 252 Speed should be run if using Taunt in order to outspeed Cresselia. Teeter Dance can catch the opponent off guard, confusing both of their active Pokemon. Substitute can be used in tandem with the threat of Sucker Punch; with the right timing, Cacturne can get away with setting up Substitute without taking a hit. Switcheroo is another interesting move for Cacturne; however, it is impossible to have Switcheroo, Seed Bomb, and Water Absorb on the same Cacturne. Running special attacks on Cacturne is possible, but Water Absorb Cacturne is currently unable to learn Dark Pulse or Giga Drain, mandating the usage of Sand Veil. While Sand Veil isn't bad, an immunity to Water-type moves is more useful, even on a sand team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Cacturne is not particularly difficult to take out, but taking a Sucker Punch isn't always desirable. Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Toxicroak and Hitmontop, can handle Cacturne with minimal risk to themselves. Flying-types, such as Zapdos and Tornadus, can give Cacturne some trouble, but are hit pretty hard by Sucker Punch. Steel-types, especially Heatran and Scizor, have fairly little to worry about and can KO with Fire- or Bug-type moves respectively. Lastly, Follow Me or Rage Powder users, such as Amoonguss and Togekiss, can safely divert Cacturne's attacks and only fear the odd Taunt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sucker Punch": {
        "description": "<p>Sucker Punch makes up for Cacturne's underwhelming Speed, providing a powerful STAB priority move. Seed Bomb acts as a secondary STAB move for Cacturne, and does heavy damage to Politoed and Tyranitar. Low Kick gives Cacturne a way to damage Steel-types, but if these threats are covered well by its teammates, Payback can be used as it hits harder against faster Pokemon. Lastly, Protect is used to stop incoming attacks, many of which will KO the cactus.</p> <p>132 Speed EVs give Cacturne 92 Speed, allowing it to outrun uninvested base 70 Speed Pokemon, such as Metagross, Hitmontop, and Politoed. Outrunning these Pokemon is important as it allows Cacturne to move first with Sucker Punch over opposing priority moves. The rest of the EVs are placed into Attack first, then HP. Although Cacturne holds a Focus Sash, the small amount of HP can help it handle weak or resisted attacks.</p> <p>252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD can be used instead of the listed EV spread to help Cacturne take non-STAB Ice Beams and be bulkier in general. This opens up its item spot for alternative choices, such as Dark Gem or Life Orb, to increase Cacturne's damage output. If Cacturne is on a Trick Room team, a Brave nature and 0 Speed IV should be used.</p> <p>Because Cacturne has Water Absorb, it works well in rain teams. Its partner can use Surf freely, while Cacturne's STAB attacks make short work of Pokemon that resist Water-type moves, such as Latios, Gastrodon, and Jellicent. Cacturne's Water Absorb also makes it a great check to rain teams, as it can hit hard against the Water-types, such as Politoed or Ludicolo, while disrupting their primary offense option.</p>"

Its low base Speed of 55 lets it shine in Trick Room. However, weaknesses to Electric-, Grass-, and Fighting-type moves make Crawdaunt very hard to use. Its Dream World ability, Adaptability, gave Crawdaunt a significant boost in BW; however, it doesn't quite make up for Crawdaunt's many weaknesses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fling is an interesting option that must be used with Iron Ball to work best. Iron Ball Fling normally has a Base Power of 130, but thanks to STAB and Adaptability boosts, Fling's power is doubled to 260, so it's definitely not to be taken lightly. However, it's a one-shot move, and if you get out-predicted, you will effectively have wasted a moveslot, an item slot, and a turn. The Hyper Cutter ability can be used to prevent Crawdaunt's Attack from being lowered, particularly by Intimidate; however, Adaptability is more useful all around. Crawdaunt can use Rock Slide for a spread attack, hitting common threats such as Zapdos and Dragonite super effectively. Its downside, though, is its lack of power. All in all, Crawdaunt doesn't really have many other useful options offensively, and trying to play it defensively is very gimmicky and risky.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As said before, Fighting-types, such as Hitmontop, Hariyama, and Conkeldurr, can be huge problems for Crawdaunt. Zapdos can take pretty much anything Crawdaunt can hit it with, except maybe Iron Ball Fling; Rotom-W fares similarly against Crawdaunt. To make matters worse, both of these threats can swiftly KO Crawdaunt with Thunderbolt. Scizor is a problem for Crawdaunt because the latter can't hit hard enough to KO, and Scizor can retaliate with Bug Bite, which OHKOes Crawdaunt. Crawdaunt also has trouble dealing with common Grass-types, such as Ludicolo, Ferrothorn, and even Amoonguss, because Crawdaunt can't do much to hurt them. Breloom in particular is nearly impossible for Crawdaunt to handle; the punching mushroom can easily outspeed Crawdaunt and either cripple with Spore or KO with either of its STAB attacks, Seed Bomb or Drain Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>The combination of Crawdaunt's high Attack and low Speed make Trick Room a natural choice for it. Crunch is Crawdaunt's strongest and most reliable STAB move; it can gain a power boost from either Life Orb or Dark Gem to hit the enemy hard. The second moveslot is dedicated to Crawdaunt's secondary STAB. Crabhammer is the stronger choice, but misses can be costly, making Waterfall an equal option. Superpower is mainly for coverage, and the fact that Crawdaunt doesn't have much else to use for this slot. Protect is a common utility move to use in VGC; it enables Crawdaunt to stall out burn or poison damage, prevent damage from an obvious Fake Out, scout out an opponent's moves, or simply enable Crawdaunt to evade damage for a turn.</p> <p>A Brave nature optimizes Crawdaunt's stats, giving it as high an Attack and as low a Speed as possible. Similarly, as is standard for Trick Room abusing Pokemon, maximum Attack investment lets Crawdaunt hit as hard as possible, and the rest of the EVs are put in HP for some added bulk. 0 Speed IVs should also be used to maximize Crawdaunt's Speed when under Trick Room. Crawdaunt's most useful ability is Adaptability because of the boost it gives to Crawdaunt's STAB moves. Life Orb grants all of Crawdaunt's moves a nice boost, while Dark Gem gives Crawdaunt's main attack, Crunch, much more power the first time it is used.</p> <p>Rain support in the form of Drizzle Politoed would be nice to have, so as to ensure Crawdaunt hits harder with Crabhammer or Waterfall. More importantly, Psychic- or Ghost-types that set up Trick Room are necessary to maximize Crawdaunt's potential. Pokemon that can provide excellent Trick Room support include Cresselia, Dusknoir, Jellicent, and Reuniclus. Fighting-types hold as steady checks to Crawdaunt, so Psychic-type teammates might be preferred to Ghost-type ones. Lightningrod support from Pokemon such as Marowak and Seaking will also be handy, as they draw in Electric-type attacks that could otherwise KO Crawdaunt.</p>"

  "Armaldo": {
    "overview": "<p>Armaldo is one of those Pokemon that gets less use than it deserves. With great offensive typing—only Steel- and Fighting-type Pokemon resist both STABs—and a base 125 Attack, Armaldo has the power to rip through unprepared teams. It also has a niche over other Bug-types thanks to access to Swift Swim via Dream World, which makes it a great physical attacker in the rain. Moreover, unlike other Swift Swim physical attackers, such as Kabutops and Qwilfish, Armaldo can take care of Pokemon such as Latios, Cresselia, Latias, and other Pokemon that tend to give rain teams trouble. It also has great defensive typing as well; with only three weaknesses and 75 / 100 / 80 defenses, it'll be on the field for a while. However, it isn't all raindrops and gumballs for Armaldo. With weaknesses to the common Water- and Rock-type attacks, the former even receiving a boost under rain, Armaldo will have problems executing its offensive role properly. To make matters worse, its low base 45 Speed makes it dead weight against other Swift Swim users such as Ludicolo and Kingdra. However, Armaldo isn't a Pokemon to be underestimated, as it has enough weapons in its arsenal to wreak havoc.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Armaldo has a few extra options that can work out for it. Aqua Tail, while illegal with Swift Swim, can be used on the Trick Room set to hit Rock-type Pokemon harder, though it lacks general coverage with Armaldo's STABs. Bulldoze can lower the opponents' Speed, which helps both it and its partner, but it is generally outclassed by Earthquake. Rock Blast can be used with Rock Gem to bypass Pokemon that try to prevent Trick Room from going up, such as Chandelure. Superpower can be used on the Trick Room set (it's illegal with Swift Swim) to always have a reliable Fighting-type attack against Pokemon that aren't very heavy, such as Ferrothorn, though the Attack and Defense drops are a real killer. Swords Dance can be used to boost Armaldo's Attack to eye-popping levels, though this requires extensive team support. Item-wise, Focus Sash is usable on the Swift Swim set to ensure it can take an attack from faster Swift Swim users, such as Kingdra and Ludicolo, giving Armaldo time to retaliate.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Despite the armor Armaldo sports, it still has problems against common VGC 2012 Pokemon. Steel-type Pokemon such as Scizor and Metagross can Bullet Punch Armaldo before it does anything, and the latter can just Meteor Mash it as well. Ferrothorn can take any attack, and proceed to either strike with Gyro Ball or sap away at Armaldo's health with Leech Seed. Amoonguss can also take any attack and then use Spore to put Armaldo out of the picture. For the Swift Swim set, faster Swift Swim Pokemon such as Ludicolo, Kabutops, and Kingdra can all outspeed Armaldo in the rain and OHKO it with powerful Water-type STAB attacks. Bulky Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Machamp and Hitmontop, resist both STABs and can use powerful Fighting-type attacks to put Armaldo down; both Pokemon even have Wide Guard to block Rock Slide and Earthquake, making it even harder to deal with them. To make matters worse, Hitmontop has Intimidate, which lowers Armaldo's Attack, weakening it for as long as it stays in. Finally, Trick Room screws over the Swift Swim set, as it relies on Speed to be effective.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rain Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>By using its Dream World ability, Swift Swim, Armaldo becomes a powerful sweeper in the rain. X-Scissor is its main STAB, as it hits the numerous Psychic- and Dark-type Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame, such as Latios, Latias, Cresselia, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon, for super effective damage. Rock Slide is another great STAB move for Armaldo, as it has great coverage alongside X-Scissor and gives Armaldo a spread move to use. However, Stone Edge can be used for more power, as it OHKOes 140/0 Zapdos, 252/140 Gyarados (if you avoid Intimidate), and 252/0 Togekiss, though it comes at the cost of accuracy. There are two options for the third moveslot; Earthquake is there for coverage against Steel-type Pokemon such as Metagross, Heatran, and Empoleon. However, Brick Break can be used to hit Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Tyranitar harder. Finally, Protect is used so Armaldo can avoid damage from moves such as Fake Out and Bullet Punch, which gives its partner time to take out the threat or set up rain.</p> <p>The EVs given in conjunction with a Jolly nature are used to outpace positive-natured Choice Scarfed Smeargle in the rain, as that is the main threat Armaldo needs to outpace. It also outpaces Choice Scarf Politoed, Metagross, and other fast Pokemon such as Aerodactyl and Jolteon, all of which outpace Armaldo if it runs an Adamant nature. In any case, Adamant isn't that bad of an idea, as it provides Armaldo with more power and lets it Speed tie with Weavile and Swellow. Life Orb is the primary item as it provides Armaldo with a significant power boost, especially with a Jolly nature being recommended.</p> <p>Considering that Armaldo is using Swift Swim as its ability, Pokemon that can set up rain are a must for this set's success. As such, Politoed is a must, using Drizzle to activate Swift Swim without any setup whatsoever. Pokemon that can take care of Water-, Fighting-, and Steel-types also make good partners. Zapdos can take care of both Water- and Fighting-type Pokemon with its STAB moves, as well as using Tailwind to ensure that Armaldo will outspeed Pokemon such as Kingdra in the rain. Thundurus is another good choice; the only difference is that it uses Thunder Wave instead of Tailwind to ensure that Armaldo outspeeds its checks. Thundurus can also set up Rain Dance reliably thanks to Prankster. However, both Pokemon share a common Rock-type weakness with Armaldo. Ludicolo can not only use powerful Hydro Pumps and Surfs to take care of Steel- and Fighting-type Pokemon, but also Giga Drain to take care of Water-type Pokemon. Gastrodon makes a good partner as well, as Storm Drain will redirect Water-type attacks away from Armaldo, while Armaldo's X-Scissor can handle Grass-type foes. Gastrodon also can use Earth Power to deal damage to Steel-types. Finally, Amoonguss makes a great partner, drawing away Water-type attacks with Rage Powder while using Spore to prevent Trick Room from going up, which would cripple Armaldo.</p>"

      "Trick Room Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>For some people, using Armaldo in rain is a dumb idea. However, there's an alternative to the fast sweeper set: a slower, bulkier Trick Room sweeper. Though the moves are similar to the rain sweeper, it uses Trick Room instead of rain in order to outspeed the opponent and attack. X-Scissor is Armaldo's strongest Bug-type STAB, working well when going for coverage against Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Latios, Latias, and the ever annoying Cresselia. The choice of Rock STAB is up to the user; Rock Slide gives Armaldo a spread attack, while Stone Edge should be used if you'd like OHKOs against Pokemon such as Zapdos and Togekiss. The third moveslot is based on what your team needs coverage on the most. Earthquake gives coverage against Steel-type Pokemon such as Metagross and Heatran, while Low Kick can nail Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Terrakion harder than Earthquake can. Finally, Protect is used to stall for a turn as Armaldo's ally sets up Trick Room or clears a threat.</p> <p>The EVs listed are the typical EV spread for an Trick Room abuser. 252 HP EVs give maximum balanced bulk, while 252 Attack EVs are used to make it hit as hard as possible. To make sure Armaldo is as slow as possible, 0 Speed IVs and a Brave nature are used. Again, a Life Orb is recommended as it provides Armaldo with the power to blast through teams, though a Sitrus Berry can be used instead, as Armaldo's defenses are good enough to make use of the berry.</p> <p>Trick Room users that have trouble against Tyranitar, such as Musharna and Cresselia, make great teammates as they can boost Armaldo's attacks with Helping Hand, while Armaldo takes care of those pesky Dark-type Pokemon that give them trouble. Like the Swift Swim set, Pokemon that can take care of Water-, Fighting-, and Steel-types make good partners. Eelektross takes care of Water-type Pokemon due to its STAB moves, has Acrobatics for Fighting-types, and can use Flamethrower against Steel-types. Breloom takes care of Steel- and Water-types due to its STAB moves, and has Spore as well, which can cripple an opposing Pokemon. Amoonguss makes a great partner, as it can draw away Water-type attacks with Rage Powder, or use Spore to cripple Pokemon that give Armaldo trouble.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hydro Pump gives Gorebyss a devastatingly powerful attack. A +2 Hydro Pump in the rain easily OHKOes 4 HP Latios and Cresselia. However, Hydro Pump's accuracy is somewhat unreliable, making it a less attractive option. Baton Pass passes off the Shell Smash boosts to another Pokemon, but makes setting everything up quite lengthy. Psychic deals with Toxicroak, while Hidden Power Electric or Grass tears through opposing Water Types. A Focus Sash can be used over Life Orb, trading the extra offense for a guarantee to survive any one attack, but Gorebyss will lose out on a lot of OHKOes. Alternatively, a White Herb can be used to counter the defensive stat drops, but once again, Gorebyss will lose out on a number of its OHKOs.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Finding a way to keep Gorebyss out of the rain, or from using Shell Smash, will keep the damage it can deal to a minimum. However, with Pokemon that have Follow Me often alongside Gorebyss, this can be a difficult task. The easiest way to do this is to use Pokemon with multi-targeting moves, Discharge in particular. These attacks bypass Follow Me support Pokemon and hit Gorebyss hard, preventing it from properly setting up.</p> <p>If Gorebyss has managed to set up, there are still ways to handle it. Setting up Trick Room can help as it makes making Gorebyss's Speed work against it, leaving it vulnerable. Pokemon that have Wide Guard, such as Hitmontop, can block Muddy Water or Surf, creating an offensive opening. Lastly, Pokemon like Abomasnow, Ludicolo, and Kingdra can be used as they can withstand Gorebyss's Water attacks and can KO back with Grass- or Dragon-type attacks respectively, although the first two have to watch out for Hidden Power Bug.</p>",

      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<p>Shell Smash is the biggest reason to use Gorebyss, doubling its Speed and Special Attack at the expense of its survivability. After one Shell Smash, Gorebyss reaches 202 Speed and 364 Special Attack. Muddy Water makes good use of Shell Smash boosts, hitting both opponents on the field. Surf can be used over Muddy Water so Gorebyss doesn't miss with its main attack, but the heavy damage it will do to Gorebyss's ally makes it somewhat undesirable. Ice Beam allows Gorebyss to take on Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Water. Finally, Protect gives Gorebyss a way to defend itself for a turn if an unfavourable situation arises. If you prefer an offensive move for the fourth moveslot, Hidden Power Bug can be used instead of Protect.</p> <p>228 Speed EVs give Gorebyss 101 Speed, allowing it to outspeed positive natured base 130 Speed Pokemon after a Shell Smash. The EVs then maximize Gorebyss's Special Attack, with the remainder added into HP for a bit more survivability. Once set up, Gorebyss will do massive damage to just about everything, even more so if Rain is set up.</p> <ul> <li>Multi-target Surf vs. 252/0 Metagross: 91.98-109.1%</li> <li>Multi-target Surf vs. 252/0 Hitmontop: 92.36-109.6%</li> <li>Multi-target Surf vs. 252/0 Tyranitar w/ Sand: 102.4-121.7%</li> <li>Multi-target Surf vs. 4/0 Latios w/ Rain: 69.87-82.69%</li> <li>Multi-target Surf vs. 252/252+ Cresselia w/ Rain: 63.44-74.45%</li> <li>Hidden Power Bug vs. 252/0 Abomasnow: 120.8-142.1%</li> <li>Hidden Power Bug vs. 252/0 Ludicolo: 111.2-131.6%</li> </ul> <p>Gorebyss will need support if it ever expects to pull off a Shell Smash. Pokemon with Follow Me or Rage Powder, such as Togekiss or Amoonguss, are best for the job; though Fake Out users can work too. After it has set up, Pokemon that can handle opposing Water-types, such as Ludicolo or Zapdos can also be helpful. Using Shell Smash right from the start isn't always the best option; if Gorebyss is partnered with Politoed, it can become an immediate threat, as the rain boosts its Speed and Water-type attacks.</p>"

  "Relicanth": {
    "overview": "<p>Relicanth is an underappreciated Swift Swim Pokemon, similar in role to Kabutops. While it lacks the Speed and power of its ancient brethren, it makes up for this with a sizable amount of added bulk and access to Head Smash. While Relicanth's Water / Rock typing doesn't do it many favors, making it weak to many of the common types in the metagame, it can become a serious threat if taken lightly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Relicanth's alternate ability, Rock Head can be utilized, negating the heavy recoil of Head Smash and allowing Relicanth to act as a Trick Room attacker. Relicanth's Dream World ability Sturdy can also be used, providing Relicanth a safety net against any one attack, but due to its sizable bulk, its other abilities are better suited for it. Relicanth has a few support moves in the form of Safeguard and Icy Wind, stopping the threat of Thunder Waves and slowing down the opponent, respectively. Double-Edge may be used when running Rock Head, providing a decently powerful attack that hits most things for neutral damage. Stone Edge can be used on a Swift Swim set if you feel that the recoil from Head Smash is too much. Lastly, Relicanth can use Substitute on its moveset, as it will find a number of opportunities to set up when in the rain.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ludicolo is Relicanth's biggest hurdle, easily outrunning it and draining it dry with Giga Drain. Zapdos, Thundurus, and Rotom-A are also dangerous due to their STAB Thunderbolts; however, they do not like taking Head Smashes straight on. Toxicroak, Ferrothorn, and Gastrodon are immune or resistant to Relicanth's STAB moves and can hit back hard with their own STAB moves. While Trick Room can stop Swift Swim Relicanth, one must be wary of slower varieties of Relicanth that can function well under the influence of Trick Room.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swift Swim Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Waterfall is Relicanth's primary STAB move. In the rain, it is effectively a 120 Base Power STAB move with an added chance of flinching. Aqua Tail can be used instead of Waterfall, trading the flinching and some accuracy for a bit more power, but as Relicanth's other moves aren't 100% accurate, it will lose out on its only reliable attack. Rock Slide allows Relicanth to hit both of its opponents for decent damage and, once again, cause the opponent to flinch. For Relicanth's third move, it has a bit of choice. Head Smash can used for its sheer power, hitting even harder than a rain boosted Waterfall, but the recoil from it can really add up. Alternatively, Earthquake provides Relicanth with a secondary spread move and allows it to damage Pokemon it couldn't otherwise, such as Toxicroak and Empoleon. However, it is a bit unwieldy to use due to many of Relicanth's best partners not being immune to Ground-type moves. Lastly, Rain Dance can be used as a way to manually set up the weather. Relicanth's final move is Protect, a staple move on many Pokemon in the VGC metagame.</p> <p>204 Speed EVs provide Relicanth with 101 Speed, allowing it to outrun base 130s, such as Crobat and Jolteon, in rain. If you don't worry about those Pokemon, a bulkier spread of 156 HP / 236 Atk / 116 Spe can be used, outspeeding Pokemon such as Latios and Thundurus and having enough bulk to survive a Jolly Terrakion's Close Combat when at full HP. Life Orb is the preferred item, boosting all of Relicanth's moves; however, other items such as damage-boosting Gems, type-resist Berries, and Sitrus Berry make good substitutes.</p> <p>As Relicanth will often need the rain, Politoed aids it tremendously. Dragon-type Pokemon, such as Dragonite, Hydreigon, and Latios, can provide a switch-in opportunity for Relicanth, as they are able to take most types of attacks that are threatening to it. Lightningrod Pokemon, such as Manectric or Seaking, can redirect away harmful Electric-type moves, but must be wary of oncoming Earthquakes. Gravity users, such as Cresselia and Starmie, can remove the risk of Relicanth missing with its attacks. If you manage to get both rain and Gravity set up, Relicanth can go all out without worrying about Speed or accuracy. Finally, Pokemon with Transform, namely Ditto and Smeargle, can work as partners for Relicanth to pull off the legendary Double Relicanth strategy.</p>"

  "Salamence": {
    "overview": "<p>Salamence is one of the more intimidating dragons usable in VGC, and said intimidating quality is naturally one of the main reasons to use it. Great attacking stats and a wide movepool allow it to be very versatile, and its respectable 95 / 80 / 80 defenses give it decent bulk. While its defenses may be undermined by weaknesses to Rock- and Ice-type attacks, this is less of an issue thanks to Intimidate. Similarly, while its base 100 Speed leaves it outsped by Garchomp and Latios, Speed is not as important in VGC due to moves such as the ever-so-common Trick Room and Tailwind twisting turn order around. These are relatively trivial faults, and Intimidate as well as a strong, versatile Dragon STAB is reason enough to seriously consider Salamence on just about any team; just keep it away from Abomasnow and company.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Salamence's movepool is quite expansive, so there are quite a few other options you can consider. Roost is useful for preserving Salamence's health, though the main issue is finding a slot for it. Aqua Tail is usable under rain, though it has mostly redundant coverage with Earthquake and Dragon Claw; it only hits Air Balloon Heatran, Gliscor, and similar opponents. Thunder Fang is fairly weak, but if you hate Water-types with a burning passion, it's worth considering. With proper support, Dragon Dance is a great option to bypass both Salamence's Speed and power issues in one turn of setup; however setup usually isn't worth it due to the amount of support it needs, but it can be devastating in the right circumstances. Rock Slide is always a great move to deal consistent damage to the opponent, and perhaps more importantly, flinch a Pokemon in the middle of a game-changing turn. Stone Edge has the same coverage as Rock Slide, but as it hits only one target, it can OHKO standard Thundurus, where it would be a 2HKO with Rock Slide. If you want a powerful Dragon-type move with no recoil or don't want to be locked into one move, Dragon Gem is a perfectly usable item for a quick and deadly Draco Meteor or Dragon Claw. Moxie may be tempting to use, given Salamence's massive Attack stat and access to a powerful Earthquake, but using Moxie means you lose the utility of Intimidate and Tailwind.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In general, faster Pokemon that carry Hidden Power Ice or Ice Beam make short work of Salamence if it's not holding a Yache Berry. Starmie, Focus Sash Jolteon, Thundurus, and Choice Scarf Rotom-W are great examples of this, and all of them can take a Dragon Claw or Earthquake if worst comes to worst. Hail teams are Salamence's kryptonite, though Salamence always has the option of using a Fire-type move. Mamoswine can OHKO Salamence before it can move with priority Ice Shard and residual hail or Fake Out damage. Weavile is well above Salamence in terms of Speed, and can cut it down to size with Ice Punch. Cresselia and Dusclops are both defensive standbys that provide a full stop to most Salamence, and can cripple it with Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, Trick Room, or in Cresselia's case, simply KO it with Ice Beam. Trick Room teams have no shortage of Pokemon that can deal with Salamence, such as Rhyperior, Glaceon, Slowking, Slowbro, Druddigon, Jellicent, and Gastrodon. Occa Berry Metagross can take anything Salamence can throw at it rather nicely and hit back with Ice Punch or a combination of Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch. Lastly, Latios and Garchomp can check Salamence provided it doesn't have Tailwind or Choice Scarf.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>A specially inclined Salamence may seem weaker than a physically attacking Salamence, but in practice, it can be deadlier than its physical counterpart, mainly due to the way Outrage randomly picks its targets. Other specially attacking Dragon-types, such as Latios and Hydreigon, seem to overshadow Salamence. But this isn't the case: Salamence can be a superior team player with Intimidate. Moreover, it makes an excellent Hitmontop check, since it resists Mach Punch and is neutral to Sucker Punch, and can KO it with Hidden Power Flying.</p> <p>A Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor can leave massive craters in the opponent's HP bar, OHKOing anything with equal or less bulk than max HP Gastrodon, Politoed, or standard Zapdos, while leaving bulkier Pokemon such as Cresselia languishing with only half of their health. However, if the drop in Special Attack is too much to pay for such power, Dragon Pulse is a decent alternative, though it needs a Dragon Gem boost to OHKO other Dragon-types, such as Dragonite (without Multiscale) and support Latias. While a Dragon Gem nets KOs that would otherwise be tantalizingly close, one mustn't forget how common Ice-type moves are, and how deadly they can be to Salamence and its cold-blooded brethren. A Yache Berry may just be its saving grace against an unexpected Blizzard from the likes of Choice Scarf Abomasnow, or a Hidden Power Ice that you mistook for another type.</p> <p>Heat Wave is an excellent coverage move, hitting two Pokemon at once and complementing Salamence's STAB moves. However, Heat Wave can become troublesome for your side as well, considering its lowly 75 Base Power and 90% accuracy, along with the possibility of activating your opponent's Pokemon's Flash Fire, such as Chandelure or Heatran. Flamethrower solves both of these problems, scoring 2HKOs and OHKOs on important Pokemon, such as Occa Berry Metagross and Abomasnow. While it may be tempting to use Fire Blast instead of Flamethrower, it is important to note that most targets of Fire Blast would still be OHKOed or 2HKOed by Flamethrower, making Flamethrower the more reliable and better option. Hidden Power Flying is not only useful against Hitmontop, but also takes down other Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Scrafty. Hidden Power Flying also hits Volcarona hard, and does more damage to Amoonguss than Flamethrower would. Tailwind is an incredibly useful move; not only does it allow Salamence to get the jump on faster Dragon-types and weather utilizers, but it allows its teammates to do so as well. Choosing between it, the ever-useful Protect, and Hidden Power Flying is akin to choosing between paths in a fork in the road. All three options are entirely viable, and in the end, it comes down to what your team needs: faster teammates, better coverage against Fighting-types, or a healthier Salamence.</p> <p>The EVs compensate for the required IVs for Hidden Power Flying. If Salamence is not using Hidden Power Flying, it would be prudent to change the spread to 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe since the main spread would miss out on a point of HP and Special Attack with full IVs. An alternative, more bulky spread of 144 HP / 248 SpA / 116 Spe (or 140 HP / 252 SpA / 116 Spe without Hidden Power Flying) is a better option for Salamence that opts to use Tailwind and/or a Yache Berry if you feel you don't need to Speed tie with Pokemon such as Zapdos and Ninetales. Although a Modest nature enables Salamence to do more damage to most Pokemon, a Timid nature allows it to stay aloft against Pokemon such as Jolly Haxorus, Timid Hydreigon, unboosted Yanmega, and other dangerous Pokemon that sit at 90 base Speed and commonly use a positive Speed nature. Hydro Pump is perhaps the only other notable special move in Salamence's repertoire outside of various Hidden Powers. Hydro Pump can be useful against Heatran and Tyranitar, does well in the rain, and provides good neutral coverage with Draco Meteor. However, Hydro Pump's iffy accuracy and forcing Salamence to lack a Fire- or Flying-type move can leave it or its teammates open to Ice- or Fighting-types.</p> <p>Unlike some Dragons, Salamence is a great team player, and as a result can work well with many Pokemon, such as Tyranitar, Volcarona, and Mamoswine. Although Tyranitar's sandstorm undermines Salamence's defenses, Intimidate cushions Mach Punch and similar moves while Tyranitar puts the rocks on Ice-types, all while preventing them from using perfect accuracy Blizzards by stopping the hail. Mamoswine is in a similar boat but instead targets other Dragons with Ice Shard, enjoys Tailwind, and uses Earthquake without hitting Salamence. Rage Powder Volcarona is a great partner for luring away Ice Beams and takes advantage of Intimidate and Tailwind, though the duo have little to protect themselves from stray Rock Slides. It should go without saying that Cresselia enjoys Intimidate to make her defenses nigh impenetrable, and Cresselia can support her comrade with various supportive moves, such as Icy Wind and Helping Hand. Hitmontop can shield Salamence from Blizzards or simply bring the fight to the Ice-types with Close Combat while forming a double-Intimidate combination, ensuring most physical attackers won't do any major damage to them or their teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>While this set may not capitalize on Salamence's great type coverage, it makes up for it with the sheer utility of Intimidate and Tailwind. Equipped with a Life Orb and Tailwind at its back, Dragon Claw makes mencemeat (pun intended) out of Latios and Garchomp, Pokemon who normally check Salamence by virtue of only their Speed. Salamence can still OHKO either of them without a Life Orb, though its chances of doing so to Garchomp drops to around 30%. Yache Berry doesn't simply ruin your chances with Garchomp though; it protects Salamence from an unexpected Ice Beam, Blizzard, or Hidden Power Ice, all of which are notorious for dropping Dragon / Flying Pokemon in one hit. As your team may still need Intimidate and Tailwind, keeping Salamence alive and well is important, especially when a KOed Pokemon out of the gate is every VGC player's nightmare.</p> <p>Earthquake is a generic coverage and spread move, ensuring Salamence isn't caught with its pants down against Pokemon such as Heatran and Metagross. The third slot is flexible; Crunch lets Life Orb Salamence 2HKO specially defensive Cresselia and Dusclops, though you'll have to be on your toes as both of them can cripple Salamence with Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp, respectively. Alternatively, Salamence can use Tailwind and Protect in the same set. If you do end up picking an attacking move in the third slot, the fourth move will pose a dilemma. In the end, however, it largely depends on what your team requires—a healthy Salamence ready to Intimidate the opponent into submission, or Tailwind support.</p> <p>Salamence's Special Attack is good enough to use Fire Blast effectively with a hindering nature, as the main targets of Fire Blast are Abomasnow and Ferrothorn, two Pokemon that are otherwise huge threats to Salamence. Besides those two, however, you won't find much use for it, as Earthquake hits Steel-types such as Metagross hard enough already. If you feel Salamence is too frail, use a spread of 140 HP / 252 Atk / 116 Spe; this spread allows Salamence to outspeed Mamoswine and everything below a base Speed of 80, and gives Salamence room to take a few Water-, Fighting-, or even Ice-type moves with Yache Berry.</p> <p>Fighting-types supporters, such as Hitmontop, Lucario, and Conkeldurr, make great teammates for Salamence. Hitmontop and Conkeldurr protect Salamence from dangerous Blizzards with Wide Guard, and if you're pairing Salamence with Intimidate Hitmontop, your team will take practically nothing from physical attacks bar those such as Metagross, who can negate stat drops. Lucario can utilize Follow Me to draw in Ice-type moves, which is especially useful if you're not using a Yache Berry. Given its subpar Defense, Gallade appreciates Intimidate support, and can reverse Trick Room should the situation arise. Chandelure can also reverse Trick Room, appreciates Tailwind support, and can give hail teams heartburn with its all-powerful Heat Wave. Cresselia is immune to Earthquake, and with Intimidate support, it becomes nigh untouchable, giving it plenty of time to fire off Helping Hand or any other support move.</p>"
      },
      "Special Choice": {
        "description": "<p>The main drawback to using a Choice item in VGC is that you have to switch out to change moves. However, when your Choice user has Intimidate, this problem is somewhat mitigated, as you're probably switching in and out anyway to maximize its effect! Choice Scarf is the main option due to the surprise factor, allowing Salamence to foil Latios's and Garchomp's plans of taking it out before it can move. On the other hand, Choice Specs supplies Salamence's Draco Meteor with enough power to not only OHKO many common Pokemon, such as Zapdos, Rotom-W, and even Haban Berry Kingdra, but also severely dent anything that doesn't resist it or invest heavily in Special Defense.</p> <p>If you absolutely loathe the Special Attack drops from Draco Meteor, Dragon Pulse is an option, but the drop in power is very apparent as Salamence can now only 2HKO all of the aforementioned threats. Heat Wave is a fairly obvious spread move, as it complements Salamence's Dragon-type STAB. The 75 Base Power may be unappealing, however, especially as it makes Choice Specs Salamence lose the OHKO on Metagross, so Flamethrower is a suitable replacement. Hidden Power Flying takes advantage of Salamence's resistance to Fighting-type moves, allowing it 2HKO or OHKO bulkier Fighting-types, such as Hitmontop, depending on which Choice item Salamence uses. Finally, Hydro Pump douses Fire-types and erodes Rock-types, 2HKOing Tyranitar in a sandstorm while it cannot OHKO Salamence in return because of Intimidate.</p> <p>The EV spread accommodates for the IV drop for Hidden Power Flying. While using a Modest nature, however, you might find that there isn't much of interest Salamence can outspeed. Given this, you can opt to change Salamence's spread to 144 HP / 248 SpA / 116 Spe to outspeed base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Mamoswine, moving the EVs to HP, going a long way to extend Salamence's longevity.</p> <p>Choice Salamence works well rain or shine, so it easily fits into a variety of team archetypes. Sun teams don't particularly care for another Rock-type weakness, but they do enjoy Intimidate and another Heat Wave user, as well as the added bonus of being able to take care of Tyranitar should it rear its ugly face. Rain teams also enjoy Intimidate, but they particularly love a check to Shedinja and Ferrothorn, two Pokemon they often lack reliable checks for. Again, Lucario, Hitmontop, and Conkeldurr make great partners for Salamence, protecting it from dangerous Blizzards or Ice Beams. The latter two can also use Feint, which can ensure a kill on Latios and Garchomp should they be extra cautious and Protect on Draco Meteor. Taunt and Safeguard are also incredibly useful to keep Salamence from being paralyzed or its Speed turned against in Trick Room. Cresselia is an excellent user of Safeguard, and can use Helping Hand, Icy Wind, and Thunder Wave to alleviate Choice Specs Salamence's Speed problems and power up Draco Meteor to an awe-inspiring 210 Base Power. Terrakion makes short work of a wide variety of Ice-types with Close Combat and Rock Slide, and breathes more easily when it isn't as threatened by Mach Punch.</p> <p>Defensively speaking, Heatran, Bronzong, and Metagross make great partners for Salamence to switch into, as they resist Ice- and Rock-type attacks while Salamence is immune to Earthquake and resistant to Fire-type attacks. In a similar vein, Water-types such as Suicune and Rotom-W make good partners, though they resist only Ice-type attacks.</p>"

  "Metagross": {
    "overview": "<p>Metagross is a dominating physical attacker in VGC 2012. Its Steel typing allows it to check hail teams and resist Rock Slide, while its bulkiness prevents it from being OHKOed by common spread attacks. In past years, Metagross was closely associated with Explosion. However, Explosion no longer halves the Defense of Pokemon before it hits, so it is less useful than before. Despite the nerf, Metagross is incredibly difficult to take down without it dishing out serious damage beforehand.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zen Headbutt gives neutral coverage on Zapdos, Politoed, and Ludicolo and also hits Hitmontop for super effective damage. Iron Head is a decent alternative to Meteor Mash, improving Metagross's accuracy, at the cost of power. If Ferrothorn becomes a problem, Hammer Arm is a good coverage move that can hit Ferrothorn; it can also lower Metagross's Speed, allowing it to function in Trick Room. If Trick Room Metagross is appealing, a Brave nature with 0 Speed IVs is recommended, allowing it to be one of the \"fastest\" Pokemon on the field in Trick Room. Metagross can make use of ThunderPunch or Ice Punch on any set to deal with Gyarados or Garchomp, respectively. Lum Berry is a solid item choice, protecting Metagross from being frozen by multiple Blizzards, being put to sleep by Spore users, or being burned by Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Metagross hates battling against physically bulky Pokemon who resist its powerful Steel-type moves. Exceptional counters to Metagross are those who resist or are immune to Earthquake on top of its Steel-type attacks. Zapdos, Rotom-W, Garchomp, Suicune, and Gyarados render almost all of Metagross's attacks useless. Zapdos and Garchomp deserve special mention because of their ability to hit Metagross with a super effective Heat Wave or Earthquake, respectively. Ninetales (and sun teams in general) give Metagross all kinds of trouble; Fire-type Pokemon such as Heatran resist Meteor Mash and can KO Metagross through Occa Berry if sun is up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<p>This is a straightforward set focusing on pure damage output. Metagross's ability, Clear Body, prevents Intimidate and other stat-reduction strategies from crippling it. STAB Meteor Mash deals enormous damage to anything that does not resist it. Bullet Punch is a useful priority attack for dealing with Focus Sash users and fast, frail Pokemon. Earthquake somewhat rounds out coverage. It gives Metagross a way to hit opposing Metagross, Jolteon, and Fire-type Pokemon. Earthquake is not always the best option for Metagross, however. Explosion still has 187.5 Base Power when factoring in how spread moves' Base Powers are calculated in double battles. As such, Explosion may be necessary in order to deal heavy damage to Pokemon such as Zapdos, Gyarados, and Rotom-W. Occa Berry allows Metagross to survive most Fire-type attacks. This is especially important because of its lower base Special Defense and the widespread use of Heat Wave. Normal Gem is also an option in conjunction with Explosion, drastically increasing its damage output.</p> <p>An Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs are preferred to give Metagross as much power as possible. Meteor Mash followed by Bullet Punch grabs a 2HKO on a huge portion of Pokemon in VGC 2012. Bullet Punch alone 2HKOes Abomasnow, Weavile, Terrakion, and Froslass. If a Normal Gem is given to Metagross, Explosion's power will surpass that of a 2x super effective Earthquake. Normal Gem-boosted Explosion OHKOes most Zapdos, Garchomp, and Rotom-W, some of Metagross' best counters otherwise.</p> <p>Metagross requires a teammate that can handle Zapdos, Garchomp, and Fire-type Pokemon. Latios provides superb offensive and defensive coverage. Latios can OHKO Garchomp and resists Fire- and Electric-type moves. It is also immune to Ground-type moves, forcing the opponent to think again before using Earthquake. Cresselia functions a lot like Latios, but focuses on support more. Cresselia can use Icy Wind or Trick Room to help Metagross overcome Zapdos while also having a Ground-type immunity. Both of these Pokemon are also immune to Metagross's own Earthquake.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Metagross is rarely seen as a Pokemon who can outspeed its enemies. This set is situational, but it yields an incredibly high reward if it pays off. With a Choice Scarf, Metagross outspeeds many of its counters and hits them with a super effective move. Many prominent Pokemon in VGC 2012 have trouble dealing with fast Steel- and Ice-type attacks. Iron Head is a decent STAB attack, and the flinch rate is even more useful with Choice Scarf. Ice Punch deals heavy damage to Zapdos and Garchomp. A super fast Explosion can catch teams completely off-guard. With the Explosion nerf, double Protecting to scout for it has become quite rare, allowing a first-turn Explosion to be more effective. Earthquake can be used to get coverage on Heatran and opposing Metagross. Trick is extremely useful as Metagross can Trick its Choice Scarf onto support Pokemon, such as Cresselia. Getting rid of the Choice Scarf also allows Metagross to switch attacks if the matchup becomes unfavorable.</p> <p>With as much Speed investment as possible, Metagross hits 201 Speed, outspeeding Jolteon, Aerodactyl, and Crobat while equipped with a Choice Scarf. Iron Head is preferred over Meteor Mash for its accuracy. Risking two Meteor Mash misses against a Focus Sash user can put Metagross and your team at a major disadvantage; however, the additional power that Meteor Mash brings may be worth it in some cases.</p> <p>Dusclops and Dusknoir work the best with Choice Scarf Metagross, as it is easy to mistake a team with this combination for a Trick Room team. As such, this draws the attention of the opponent to Dusclops and Dusknoir in an attempt to prevent Trick Room from going up, allowing Metagross to fire off unexpected attacks. Dusclops and Dusknoir can also boost Metagross's attacks with Helping Hand. They have an immunity to Explosion also, allowing them to boost it or use any number of supporting moves the same turn. Ironically, Dusclops and Metagross also cause this set the most trouble. Metagross's best option against Dusclops is to use Trick; nevertheless, Dusclops can still use Will-O-Wisp, crippling Metagross, and then switch out. Opposing Metagross resist Iron Head, Ice Punch, and Explosion, putting your own Metagross at a disadvantage.</p>"

  "Latias": {
    "overview": "<p>Latias's role is slightly different from that of her twin brother, Latios. Although they share a similar stat spread, Latias was given a bulkier edge, as opposed to Latios's more offensive one. Because of this, Latias is rarely seen in VGC 2012. However, for those looking for a bulkier Pokemon with a great movepool, Latias is your girl.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Latias has access to many moves, so there are tons of other options that may be worth exploring. For starters, she receives Rain Dance and Sunny Day, with which she can support a weather abuse team if auto-weather isn't your style, or if you just want some extra security. Latias also has Roar, which can mess with Trick Room setters because it has higher priority, but it's very situational. Latias has access to both Reflect and Light Screen, but Cresselia sets up dual screens much more reliably. A ChestoRest can also be used, but with Recover there isn't much need. Latias can also make use of a Colbur Berry in order to lessen the damage of Dark-type attacks, specifically to survive Adamant Tyranitar's Crunch. Charm is a more gimmicky option to use; lowering the Attack of hard-hitting Pokemon can be useful in certain situations. However, it can end up being useless if Latias isn't up against strong physical attackers. Reflect Type is an interesting move choice as well, providing a way for Latias to change her typing to buffer hits from strong attackers, such as Metagross and Tyranitar. It may not always be the best move, however, as Latias might end up sacrificing the STAB boost on her attacks, so it should be used with caution.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Steel-types wall Latias by resisting both of her STAB attacks, so she will rarely be able to beat them. Tyranitar is also a problem for Latias, as it has massive Special Defense in the sand, in addition to STAB Dark-type attacks to decimate Latias. Most specially defensive walls, Blissey and Cresselia in particular, cause problems for offensive Latias.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Latias has a great support movepool. Helping Hand is as always a top-notch supporting move in doubles, allowing Latias to help her partner deal more damage that turn. Dragon Pulse is a great move for Latias, preventing her from becoming Taunt bait while also hitting most other Pokemon for decent neutral damage. Icy Wind is another choice to consider, supporting slower Pokemon and hitting both opposing Pokemon to lower their Speed. Recover is great for Latias because she has some staying power; however, if you feel Protect is more useful, it is a good option.</p> <p>A Sitrus Berry is a useful item for Latias, allowing her to regain some HP without having to spend a turn Recovering. However, some may find this unnecessary because of Latias's access to the move Recover, so a Haban Berry is another option to consider. This allows Latias to take damage from opposing Dragon-types that threaten her, such as her speedier counterpart Latios, and hit back with Dragon Pulse. Yache Berry is another good resist berry for Latias, enabling her to live common Blizzards and other Ice-type attacks.</p> <p>Latias is best paired with Pokemon that deal heavy damage. Metagross is often a common partner because it resists Ice- and Dragon-type moves and hits with incredible power. Other Pokemon such as Mamoswine also complement Latias well because Helping Hand can boost its priority Ice Shard, and with Levitate, Latias is immune to Earthquake. Nearly all Earthquake users pair well with Latias because of Levitate and the Helping Hand boost. Heal Pulse is a new move for Latias, and is a very interesting one as well. Heal Pulse allows Latias to heal up her ally, but if that Pokemon faints before Heal Pulse lands, it will target the opposing side and benefit them. This makes Heal Pulse require some timing and prediction, because healing an opponent can be devastating. Pokemon who are decently bulky but lack recovery often benefit from Latias's Heal Pulse, although it's important to watch out for Follow Me or Rage Powder users, which can redirect Latias's attack and aid the opponent.</p> <p>As Tyranitar is one of the best Latias counters, great teammates for Latias are Steel- and Fighting-types. As mentioned before, Metagross makes a great partner because of its STAB Steel-type attacks that hit Tyranitar hard. Fighting-type Pokemon, particularly Hitmontop and Terrakion, also pair well with Latias because their STAB Fighting-type attacks will also remove Tyranitar. Hitmontop also has access to Sucker Punch, with which it can take down Latios, who is a bane to Latias as well. All in all, because Latias functions so well as a supporter, she can pair with almost any Pokemon. Every Pokemon can benefit from a Helping Hand boost or Heal Pulse recovery, so Latias is never short of options for teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Throwing Latias into an offensive role may seem very odd considering her great supporting movepool, but Latias's attacking stats still enable her to pose a significant threat. Life Orb allows Latias to gain many OHKOs she would normally miss out on with a Timid nature, such as on both Latios and Garchomp with Dragon Pulse. Draco Meteor gains even more OHKOs, but comes at the price of a Special Attack drop, which might be unappealing. Psyshock gains STAB and hits common opponents such as Hitmontop for super effective damage, which can be devastating. In the third moveslot, Hidden Power Fire is recommended for extra coverage, especially against Steel-types, who resist both of Latias's STAB attacks. Protect is always a useful move in VGC 2012, providing a damage-free turn for Latias.</p> <p>There might not seem to be any reason to use offensive Latias over Latios, but the former's bulk can give her an edge against certain threats. For example, Latias can always survive a Mamoswine's Ice Gem Ice Shard, something Latios can't boast. Latias is also able to take Quiet Abomasnow's Blizzard, as well as hail damage at the end of the turn, which can be very useful. Yanmega's Bug Buzz won't OHKO Latias, but Latios might very well faint. Overall, Latias's bulk is able to get her out of quite a few sticky situations, while her attacking stats enable her to hit nearly as hard as her more offensively based counterpart.</p> <p>The EVs provided are the most efficient distribution when using Hidden Power Fire, outspeeding max Speed Infernape, Virizion, and Terrakion. However, if you wish to run max Speed to Speed tie with Latios and Gengar, other usable options include Thunderbolt, Surf, and supporting moves such as Helping Hand and Icy Wind. Latias's diverse movepool will leave you spoilt for choice even if you find Hidden Power Fire undesirable. Hidden Power Ground can also be used to hit Heatran while still maintaining super effective coverage on Steel-types.</p> <p>Steel- and Fighting-types are still some of Latias's greatest allies, so Pokemon such as Terrakion, Metagross, Hitmontop, and Heatran are excellent partners. Ground-types such as Mamoswine and Garchomp can also pair well as they are able to abuse strong Earthquakes without fear of hurting their partner. Latias's main issues are specially defensive walls, so Pokemon that hit on the physical side can overcome them and can prove to be a great aid. Great examples of these are Tyranitar, Breloom, and Terrakion which can take out Cresselia, Gastrodon, and Blissey, respectively.</p> <p>Latias can also use a Choice Scarf along with a Modest nature. Latias ordinarily Speed ties with her brother Latios, so a Choice Scarf can remove the luck factor of the tie. With the boost in Speed, Latias can run a Modest nature without worry in order to gain her offensive edge back. Unfortunately, with a Choice Scarf, Latias's versatility is severely limited, and since the Speed tie is very situational, winning it might not be of much use. Nonetheless, teams that have trouble with Latios might appreciate the surprise factor Latias can provide. If using Choice Scarf, Trick can be used instead of Protect in order to cripple support Pokemon. Tailwind is also an option on this set when not using Choice Scarf, as it can eliminate threats of Speed ties by simply boosting Latias and her teammates' Speed.</p>"

  "Latios": {
    "overview": "<p>Looking for a fast and powerful Dragon-type Pokemon to use in VGC 2012? Well search no further, as Latios is just that...and more! Boasting a sky-high base 130 Special Attack and a supersonic base 110 Speed, combined with its fantastic Dragon-type STAB and fair coverage, Latios will very often leave an agonizing scar on its victims. Furthermore, Latios's moderate overall bulk, coupled with its fantastic resistances to Fire-, Fighting-, Grass-, Psychic-, Electric-, and Water-type attacks, along with its immunity to Ground-type attacks due to Levitate, grant it a decent degree of survivability and allowing it to continue its rampage.</p> <p>However, Latios does suffer from several drawbacks. It has a somewhat wide list of weaknesses which, when combined with Latios's subpar physical bulk, means it is in constant danger of being dispatched. As a result, Latios relies heavily on its Speed to take out many threats, which can be somewhat of a liability as many common battle conditions in VGC 2012 can alter turn orders. Despite these setbacks, the aforementioned positives are more than enough to secure Latios's place as one of the most devastating special attackers in this metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Latios's wide movepool grants it a fair number of other choices to utilize to keep itself from being too predictable. Substitute can be used to take advantage of free turns as well as to avoid Sucker Punches and status attacks. However, Latios might find itself hard pressed to remove one of its valuable moveslots. Recover can be used to maintain Latios's presence in the battlefield, while also avoiding Sucker Punch. Latios's bulk might not be very impressive, but it does have an incredible number of useful resistances. This works best with a type-resist Berry such as Haban. Grass Knot 2HKOes Tyranitar and Gastrodon, and OHKOes Rhyperior. Latios has access to many supporting options. It learns Heal Pulse, Icy Wind, Helping Hand, Thunder Wave, Reflect, and Light Screen, but Latias generally performs that role better.</p> <p>Latios has several other item choices it can consider. It can utilize Choice Specs rather well due to its insanely high Special Attack stat, and can also open up the possibility of using Trick to cripple a target. However, as Latios gets locked in and is unable to use Protect, the danger of being KOed increases. Choice Scarf is also a viable option to make Latios faster than virtually anything outside of Trick Room. White Herb is an option to restore Latios's Special Attack one time after using Draco Meteor, and can also aid it against Icy Wind. Beware of Intimidate, however, as it will simply waste the White Herb and Latios would have almost certainly preferred receiving the Attack drop anyways. Latios's weaknesses can be temporarily fixed via the aid of a type-resist Berry. Haban Berry allows Latios to live against an otherwise fatal Dragon-type attack such as Garchomp's Dragon Claw and Kingdra's Dragon Pulse. Colbur Berry grants it a one-time protection against Sucker Punch from the likes of Toxicroak and Hitmontop, and allows it to survive Tyranitar's Crunch. Alternatively, Focus Sash can let Latios survive any fatal hit provided that it was struck at full HP.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Tyranitar is a solid counter, being able to usually live two hits from Latios and OHKOing back with Crunch. Keep in mind though—if Tyranitar does not invest very heavily in Special Defense, it will be 2HKOed by Life Orb Grass Knot. Bronzong resists Latios's STABs and Hidden Power Ground, and can use Trick Room to nullify Latios's Speed advantage. Latios also does not enjoy taking multiple Iron Heads or Gyro Balls. Beware of Hidden Power Fire in the sun, however, as it can deal massive damage. Metagross needs to watch out for Hidden Power Ground and Hidden Power Fire (if it is not raining). However, it can tank everything else reasonably well and deal major damage with Meteor Mash. Though Latios will survive the Meteor Mash, it will not survive the following Bullet Punch. Scizor beats those without Hidden Power Fire. It can swiftly dispatch Latios with its powerful STAB Bug Bite. Ferrothorn also defeats Latios without Hidden Power Fire (and can beat one with it in the rain). Its added resistances to Surf and Thunderbolt means that Latios will have a tough time breaking through it, while Ferrothorn can 2HKO Latios with Gyro Ball. Snorlax's incredible special bulk allows it to absorb Latios's attacks without too much of a hassle, but Snorlax must be wary of Psyshock. In return, Latios fears Body Slam, Crunch, or Return. Chansey can easily absorb Latios's attacks and stall it out with Toxic and Soft-Boiled, but Chansey is rather rare in this metagame.</p> <p>Faster Pokemon such as Weavile, Choice Scarf Abomasnow, Choice Scarf Garchomp, and Yanmega (after a Speed Boost) are troublesome, and Sucker Punch from the likes of Hitmontop and Toxicroak will inflict heavy damage. Latios despises paralysis, as it relies on its Speed very much due to its weaknesses and poor physical defense. Beware of Thunder Wave from Pokemon such as Cresselia, Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Gyarados, as it will likely render Latios useless for the remainder of the match. Trick Room also does it no favors as well, for reasons similar to the above.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>This might be Latios's only featured set in this analysis, but there is no denying that Latios draws much of its destructiveness from this set alone. Although Latios is a very one dimensional Pokemon in this metagame, it performs that one role exceptionally well such that predictability is almost never an issue!</p> <p>Latios's primary offensive potential comes from its powerful Dragon-type STAB attacks. Draco Meteor is the very portrait of such strength, capable of OHKOing or severely injuring most Pokemon, especially if they lack resistance to it. For instance, Life Orb Draco Meteor has a very good chance of OHKOing 252/0 Rotom-W! However, the harsh Special Attack reduction after it is used can leave Latios quite vulnerable, and thus should be used sparingly. Another option would be Dragon Pulse, which does not have a drawback and can be thrown around more safely, but is nowhere as powerful as Draco Meteor.</p> <p>The remainder of Latios's moveslots focus on coverage. Psychic will OHKO Terrakion and Conkeldurr, and has a 56.25% chance of OHKOing Hariyama, while Psyshock grants Latios an alternative STAB that lets it beat down Fighting-types (bar Scrafty), Amoonguss, and can dent Snorlax and specially defensive Gastrodon. Psychic also has a higher base power and a chance for a Special Defense drop. Hidden Power Ground dents Metagross, Excadrill, and can OHKO Heatran. Hidden Power Fire has even greater coverage, as it hits Metagross, Excadrill, Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Abomasnow for super effective damage, but can be weakened by rain and leaves Latios hanging with 30 Speed IVs, making it vulnerable against opposing base 110 Speed Pokemon. If running Hidden Power Fire, the EVs should be changed to 4 HP / 4 Def / 248 SpA / 4 SpD / 248 Spe to account for the IV drop. If coverage isn't a big issue, Tailwind is an alternative over Hidden Powers. Latios's raw power ensures that it can easily make use of the Tailwind it sets up, and its high base Speed allows it to outrun virtually every speedy weather abuser, with the exception of the rare Jumpluff in the sun (with whom Latios Speed ties), and the even rarer Floatzel in the rain. Substitute provides a way for Latios to avoid the common Cresselia's Thunder Wave, and prevents Icy Wind's Speed drops. Substitute also can aid Latios in stalling out Trick Room and Tailwind.</p> <p>Latios has two very notable item choices. Life Orb grants Latios a consistent power boost, but causes it to suffer from recoil. On the other hand, Dragon Gem is a viable alternative to boost Latios's Dragon-type attack of choice even further. For instance, a Dragon Gem boosted Draco Meteor can OHKO the standard Reuniclus. However, it is consumed after one use and does not power up the rest of Latios's attacks, and Latios might find itself unable to 2HKO Metagross with Hidden Power Ground as a result.</p> <p>Latios can also make use of Thunderbolt and Surf for additional coverage. However, the majority of Pokemon hit for super effective damage by these attacks will run resist Berries. Because of this, Thunderbolt and Surf should be used only if you feel that your team is lacking the coverage necessary to take care of Pokemon such as Togekiss, Gyarados, Heatran, and other Water-, Flying-, and Fire-types.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Speed and Special Attack under the assumption Hidden Power Fire is used. The rest maximize the usage of the few EVs left. If, for some reason, Latios's divisible-by-4 HP does not appeal to you, simply take it out. Keep in mind it has nowhere else to place it. Hidden Power Ground variants should use 4 HP / 4 Def / 248 SpA / 252 Spe. Use 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe if you don't plan on using Hidden Power.</p> <p>In general, Latios's best partners are Fighting- and Steel-types. Excellent Fighting-type choices are Infernape and Hitmontop. The former rounds out Latios's coverage very well with its Fire- and Fighting-type attacks, helping it against pesky threats such as Metagross, Abomasnow, Bronzong, Weavile, and Scizor. The latter can increase Latios's lifespan with Intimidate support. Hitmontop can also opt to specialize in priority attacks, which helps mostly against Weavile and Choice Scarf Abomasnow. Notable Steel-type partner choices include Metagross and Scizor. Metagross is also an excellent partner as it can take out Tyranitar, Weavile, Snorlax, and Abomasnow. It can also take advantage of Latios's Levitate and use Earthquake. Scizor performs similarly, but it can not use Earthquake and must watch out for Snorlax's Fire Punch. Latios also aids these Pokemon with some of their problems. For instance, Latios can take out Rotom-W and Gyarados, both of whom trouble Metagross and Infernape, respectively.</p>"

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Normally, Gastrodon would be seen as a fairly average Pokemon. It doesn't have great stats, but what sets Gastrodon apart from other Pokemon like it is its access to Storm Drain. With this fantastic ability, Gastrodon has an immunity to Surf and Water Spout. Its secondary Ground-type allows it to function in a sandstorm as well, taking no residual damage each turn. Its low Speed stat means it can be used under Trick Room, making Gastrodon extremely versatile.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gastrodon can also make use of a few other support moves. It has access to Rain Dance, which can be useful for surprising your opponent, as most people expect to see auto-weather rather than individual moves. Scald can also be used, but it only hits one target. Gastrodon may also make use of Yawn, which forces your opponent into a tough position of either choosing to switch or choosing to let their Pokemon fall asleep. With no sleep clause in VGC, this can be a very useful tool. Gastrodon can also make use of Blizzard if used on a hail team or if you're feeling lucky with its accuracy. Gastrodon can also utilize Hidden Power Fire to hit Grass-types that counter it, such as Abomasnow and Ferrothorn. Double Team is another option, as its bulk allows it to stick around for a few turns, making it a threat with +1 evasion. Stockpile is another option worth exploring, as it allows Gastrodon to become even bulkier with its +1 boost to Defense and Special Defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Abomasnow and Ferrothorn are great examples of counters for Gastrodon. They shrug off Gastrodon's STAB moves and are able to hit it back with their own STAB Grass-type attacks. Gastrodon is also worn down over time by many hits from the opposition. Although it is bulky, it isn't able to hit very hard without Storm Drain boosts, so it ends up just getting worn down with proper playing from the opponent.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>This set capitalizes on Gastrodon's bulkiness and also provides some offensive capabilities with Storm Drain. The Special Attack boost gives Gastrodon some offensive power, while still allowing for an EV investment in the defenses. Surf allows Gastrodon to utilize its best STAB spread move, but the fact that it hits your other Pokemon on the field might make you wary of it. If you are worried about hitting your own Pokemon at a crucial time, Muddy Water is an excellent replacement option. Muddy Water has a 30% chance to lower the opposing Pokemon's accuracy, which could be enough reason to use it despite its 85% accuracy. Ice Beam is recommended because of its 100% accuracy and the fact that it isn't blocked by Wide Guard. Icy Wind is another option, because it hits both opposing Pokemon and can lower their Speed, which could be an asset in the battle. Earth Power allows Gastrodon to utilize its other STAB, and hits Steel-types for more damage. It also hits harder if Gastrodon is forced to play in the sun. Toxic can be used if you feel that hitting Steel-types is unnecessary, as it will take its toll on the opposing Pokemon. Recover is useful on Gastrodon because it takes hits well and can just get HP back rather than using Protect and being dead weight for a turn.</p> <p>This set is Gastrodon's best because of its versatility. It works exceptionally well under the rain, and works well in Hail, Sand, and is able to survive in Sun. With plenty of coverage moves, Gastrodon is able to take on most physical attackers in the metagame. Rindo Berry is used in order to survive Grass-type moves such as Power Whip, SolarBeam, Wood Hammer, Grass Knot, and Energy Ball, but Sitrus Berry is another option if you're not worried about those moves.</p> <p>Gastrodon's other abilities aren't nearly as potent as Storm Drain. Sticky Hold doesn't have much use in doubles, as Trick and Knock Off aren't seen all that often. Sand Force also doesn't benefit Gastrodon much because its offensive stats aren't high enough to merit the use of it over Storm Drain. Gastrodon could also use the same set but with a spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD for a specially bulky set. A Calm nature would be more optimal with that spread. Another more offensive spread with a 252 SpA EV investment is able to KO Terrakion with a +1 Muddy Water, and Thundurus with a +1 Ice Beam. With this, it can also OHKO 252 HP Metagross with a +1 Earth Power. Gastrodon can also be given a speed IV of 0 and used under Trick Room. Gastrodon's movepool is fairly shallow, although it has enough for good coverage and support. Gastrodon has great use in VGC 2012 because of its resistances to Heat Wave, Discharge, Surf, Water Spout, and Rock Slide.</p> <p>A good partner for Gastrodon is Politoed, which can set up rain and use Surf to activate Storm Drain. Pokemon with Water Absorb are also good partners, as it is mutually beneficial to both Pokemon. Abomasnow can be a good partner as well, because its STAB Blizzard hurts Grass-types that threaten Gastrodon. Electric-types such Zapdos, Thundurus, and the Rotom formes are also very good partners, because they can launch off Discharge without fear of hurting their own ally.</p>"

  "Ambipom": {

However, it is one of the few Pokemon that has a base 115 Speed, which allows it to outrun some of the most common Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame. With access to Technician and a variety of moves, Ambipom is a viable Pokemon and can easily fit into any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ambipom has several other offensive options such as Pursuit, Payback, and U-turn. However, these moves are situational and should only be used to counter specific Pokemon such as Chandelure or Latios. Ambipom also has access to several support moves such as Taunt and Thunder Wave. However, Thundurus, a bulkier Pokemon, has access to all the same support moves and Prankster, outclassing Ambipom in every way. Nevertheless, Ambipom can use these moves to catch your opponent off guard and shut them down. Ambipom can even learn Rain Dance and Sunny Day and is a wonderful weather supporter. It also learns Last Resort, which when paired with only Fake Out, can KO almost anything that doesn't resist it. It can even use Natural Gift and Covet to counter your team's weaknesses and to steal your opponent's items.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ambipom is rather frail and cannot take many hits. For example, strong STAB attacks such as Latios's Draco Meteor and Tyranitar's Crunch easily OHKO Ambipom. It also has problems dealing with priority attacks, namely Mach Punch and Bullet Punch. Ambipom loses most of its power if your opponent sees Fake Out coming and Protects to prevent it. Most Pokemon with Choice Scarf are also able to outspeed Ambipom before it can even attack. However, if you're looking for a specific counter to Ambipom, Hitmontop Intimidates Ambipom and KOs it with a Close Combat. Ghost-types force Ambipom to attack with Acrobatics or Aerial Ace and limit its offensive options.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Ambipom's excellent Speed and great moveset make it an excellent lead. Fake Out is Ambipom's most important move. It does a surprisingly large amount of damage to anything that does not resist it, and allows for its partner to either attack the opponent or support Ambipom. Double Hit breaks through your opponent's Focus Sash while doing a decent amount of damage. Return, however, deals more damage but restricts Ambipom from taking out opponents that carry a Focus Sash. Low Kick hits several Pokemon that will otherwise wall Ambipom such as Tyranitar. Acrobatics is preferred when using a Normal Gem, as it will always do more damage. However, if a Life Orb is used, then Aerial Ace should always be used. Protect prevents Ambipom from taking damage, allowing its partner to KO threats.</p> <p>Ambipom runs a Jolly nature along with max Speed EVs to outrun common Pokemon with a base Speed of 111 or lower, such as Tornadus and Thundurus. A Normal Gem allows Fake Out to do a substantial amount of damage and leave the opponent in range of a KO the following turn from either Ambipom or its partner. However, Life Orb can also be used if you do not like Normal Gem's one-time boost.</p> <p>Because Ambipom isn't able to take many attacks, it works great alongside Cresselia. Cresselia is able to use a variety of support moves such as Icy Wind, Reflect, and Helping Hand in order to assist Ambipom. While opponents double Protect to prevent Ambipom's Fake Out from damaging them, Cresselia can use the time to set up screens to prevent Ambipom from being OHKOed. Cresselia also has Psychic in order to take out Fighting-types, which generally give Ambipom trouble. It can also be paired with sweepers such as Latios, Tyranitar, and Metagross to quickly damage threats before its partner finishes them off.</p>"

With a wide movepool that consists of one of the best priority moves in the game, Sucker Punch, Honchkrow can easily pick off weakened opponents. When Honchkrow isn't using Sucker Punch, it can rip teams apart with Brave Bird, which hits an unbelievable 180 base power after the STAB boost is calculated. Also, unlike most Flying-type Pokemon, Honchkrow can hit Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon with Superpower, which has a chance to OHKO even Chople Berry Tyranitar. If that didn't make Honchkrow good enough, it also gets two viable abilities, one that makes it immune to sleep inducing moves; the other giving Honchkrow an Attack boost after every KO it gets, making that base 125 Attack stat look even scarier. However, Honchkrow has its faults. With a very disappointing (for a Flying-type, at least) base 71 Speed and thin defenses, finding an opportunity to outspeed and KO the mafia bird isn't very hard to do, especially for Pokemon that resist Sucker Punch. However, it's called the Big Boss Pokemon for a reason, as teams without an effective check to Honchkrow will get torn apart with ease.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There isn't much Honchkrow can use that is better off on another Pokemon. Thunder Wave can be used to slow down faster Pokemon, meaning that Honchkrow can outspeed and sweep easier, but Pokemon such as Murkrow and Cresselia pull this off better thanks to Prankster or better bulk, respectively. Power Herb + Sky Attack can be used as a one-time powerful attack, but if the opponent uses Protect as you use Sky Attack, the Power Herb is wasted. Honchkrow can set up its own Tailwind, but this means Honchkrow loses a coverage attack or Protect, so this is usually done better by bulkier Pokemon. With base 105 Special Attack, a special set can be useful, especially since it gets moves such as Air Slash and Heat Wave. Taunt can be used to stop an opposing Pokemon from setting up, like Trick Room teams, Spore users such as Breloom, or any other boosting Pokemon in the metagame. Lastly, Super Luck can be used with a Scope Lens and Night Slash to abuse the high critical hit rate. However, this is very luck based and is not recommended.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Even a Pokemon as awesome as Honchkrow has its fair share of checks and counters. Tyranitar and Heatran make good checks, as Chople Berry and Focus Sash variants can take a Superpower and OHKO with Rock Slide or Heat Wave, respectively. However, a Life Orb Honchkrow can OHKO even a Chople Berry Tyranitar, so caution must be used if Tyranitar is your check. Zapdos is also a great check, as it resists Brave Bird and can OHKO with a STAB Thunderbolt, but a Life Orb boosted Sucker Punch will hurt. Metagross takes any attack other than the rare Heat Wave, and it can OHKO with a combination of Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch. Gyarados has Intimidate, cutting the mafia bird's Attack stat, meaning it can take a Brave Bird and also deals good damage with Waterfall or Stone Edge. Gyarados can also slow Honchkrow down with Icy Wind or Thunder Wave.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This set maximizes the sheer power of Honchkrow by using a Life Orb. Brave Bird, boosted with a Life Orb, hits very hard and puts dents in just about anything that doesn't resist it. However, since it is resisted by Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon, Superpower is highly recommended, as it allows Honchkrow to clear out Pokemon such as Heatran and Tyranitar, which resist the Dark / Flying type combination. However, even with these powerful attacks, taking out faster Pokemon such as Latios and Chandelure is very difficult to do. Therefore, Sucker Punch is used to attack faster Pokemon such as the Lati twins, Chandelure, and Tornadus hard, OHKOing the Lati twins and Chandelure. If used with Moxie, Honchkrow gets an Attack boost while KOing a threat, which is always useful for a team. Protect is a staple in doubles as it allows Honchkrow to avoid damage, allowing its partner to take care of any threats.</p> <p>If using Superpower, Honchkrow cannot use Moxie. Don't worry though, as Insomnia makes it immune to sleep, allowing it to check Pokemon like Breloom and Amoonguss better, as well as take on sun sweepers with Sleep Powder, such as Venusaur and Jumpluff. Moxie is the best for this set, as Life Orb + Moxie boosts turn Honchkrow into an absolute monster. Using an Adamant nature means that Honchkrow has as much power as possible, as most base 70 Pokemon don't use a positive Speed nature anyway. Maximizing Speed is only useful for checking Breloom, as Honchkrow will not be able to take any of the mushroom boxer's hits. Utilizing Tailwind support Pokemon such as Whimsicott and Suicune means that Honchkrow keeps its maximum power while outpacing the opponent's team regardless of match up, and both Suicune and Whimsicott can take care of Rock-type Pokemon. In addition, Whimsicott can use Encore to make Honchkrow's sweep easier.</p> <p>Night Slash can be used if you don't decide to use Superpower, clearing up the slot for Moxie. Drill Peck can be used if the Brave Bird recoil is just too much to handle, though there is a very noticeable power drop. If using Drill Peck, Focus Sash is now the item of choice, as it allows Honchkrow to take an attack at full health, and this is especially useful with Honchkrow's frail defenses. A Dark Gem can also be used in this set, which is really good if your team is built around Honchkrow getting a late-game sweep. Also, Honchkrow will take a lot of damage thanks to Brave Bird and Life Orb, so a Pokemon with Heal Pulse, such as Lucario or Latias, makes a great partner, especially Latias as she can set up Tailwind. Choice Scarf and Moxie pair really well together, but if running a Scarf, use Jolly to outspeed Scarf Politoed and Metagross by 1 point, which can determine to tide of the match.</p>"

  "Bronzong": {
    "overview": "<p>With a fabulous Steel typing, a Ground-type immunity, a great movepool, and decent stats, one might wonder why Bronzong is not seen very often in the VGC metagame. The answer is simple: its low HP stat lowers its bulk tremendously, and its low Speed restricts it to being used on Trick Room and anti-Trick Room teams. Its only weakness to common Fire-type moves does not assist Bronzong either, as any STAB Fire-type move, especially in sun, will likely make quick work of it. However, these shortcomings should not deter one from choosing it. Bronzong is perfectly capable of providing support to any team, and can be a major nuisance for the opponent.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bronzong can run a dual screen set consisting of Light Screen, Reflect, Explosion, and Gyro Ball, but Cresselia normally outclasses it in this regard, due to its much higher bulk and access to Helping Hand and Icy Wind, which make it much more than dead weight after it has set up screens. Bronzong also has a slew of attacking options it can use in the support set such as Rock Slide, Zen Headbutt, Earthquake, and Iron Head that can offer more coverage, or in Iron Head's case, a more reliable STAB move. Bronzong has access to Rain Dance, Sandstorm, and Sunny Day, and can use these moves to support the team, if desired.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Whimsicott and Imprison Chandelure are arguably the only Pokemon that can usually prevent Bronzong from setting up Trick Room. The former can break Bronzong's Mental Herb with Taunt and force it to revert the dimensions with Encore, while the latter can utilize Imprison to stop all variants, or utilize Heat Wave in the sun to OHKO any variant lacking an Occa Berry. Bronzong's bulk might be decent, but it lacks the HP to take double STAB-boosted Surf and Heat Wave, making Ninetales and Politoed very good counters due to their weather setting abilities. Tornadus and Thundurus are also very good counters, as they can stop non-Mental Herb Bronzong with a priority Taunt, and are capable of stalling out Trick Room with a priority Substitute, should Bronzong manage to set Trick Room up. The latter deserves a special mention, as it resists Gyro Ball and can maim Bronzong with a STAB Thunder. Overall, Bronzong's bulk, although respectable, will fall to the might of several STAB-boosted moves due to the robot's lack of reliable recovery.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Bronzong's Steel typing, its Levitate ability, low Speed, access to Gyro Ball, and good defenses help it to distinguish itself as an exceptionally useful Trick Room supporter. Trick Room is the crux of the set, setting up the distorted dimensions for itself and the team, enabling it to outspeed the majority of the VGC metagame when Trick Room is in play. Gyro Ball is a reliable and very powerful move that usually has a massive Base Power due to Bronzong's low Speed, and is capable of OHKOing frailer threats such as Gengar and Terrakion. Imprison enables Bronzong to stop opposing Trick Room teams and, when used in conjunction with Protect, prevent the opponent's access to the staple move of doubles. Light Screen temporarily increases the team's Special Defense, easing the damage taken from common spread moves such as Surf and Heat Wave. Lastly, Bronzong has the ability to use Explosion in order to get a teammate in safely. If one does not want this robot to have its death hastened, then you can use Protect, a staple move in Doubles that has many uses.</p> <p>Bronzong likes to have a Mental Herb to get through Taunt and not be deemed worthless by Whimsicott's Encore; however, if you have a method for dealing with Whimsicott and are running Bronzong on a rain team, then a Sitrus Berry is recommended to maximize Bronzong's longevity. Lastly, an Occa Berry enables Bronzong to take one sun-boosted Heat Wave from Ninetales and then proceed to set up Trick Room.</p> <p>Bronzong's low HP stat prevents it from surviving a STAB Surf from the likes of Drizzle Politoed, and also prevents it from living a STAB Heat Wave from Fire-types such as Ninetales without the help of an Occa Berry. Bronzong likes Fake Out support to stop these moves for one turn so that it can set up its Trick Room, and later set up Light Screen to help itself and its teammate set up. Hariyama sets itself apart from the crowd of Pokemon that can use Fake Out, thanks to its Guts ability and massive Attack stat that allows it to apply pressure to the opponent, while Bronzong aids itself and the team. If this cannot be achieved, another Trick Room user that can withstand these moves, such as Jellicent, is recommended. Lickilicky deserves a special mention as it prevents the STAB Water-type moves from being boosted by Drizzle, thanks to its ability, Cloud Nine, therefore making them much more bearable.</p> <p>Bronzong's supporting ability not only lies in using Trick Room, but having the ability to stop it. Bronzong enjoys partners that can apply pressure to the other team that appreciate the removal of Trick Room. Garchomp stands out among these Pokemon due to its ability to eliminate Chandelure, one of Bronzong's most threatening enemies. In return, Bronzong can OHKO opposing Ice-types that try to freeze Garchomp. Should Bronzong want to more heavily damage these Ice-types the alternative spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD can be used to swap Bronzong's Special Defense for a damage boost in its moves.</p>"

  "Garchomp": {
    "overview": "<p>Garchomp has been a force to be reckoned with since its release in DPP, and not much has changed going into BW. Its very high base 130 Attack, clutch base 102 Speed, and natural bulk allow it to be a potent threat in VGC 2012.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Garchomp's other options are limited, but it does have a few. As previously mentioned, Crunch and Focus Sash are both viable options over the standard set if they fit your team better. Dual Chop can be used to break through Focus Sashes, Substitutes, and Haban Berries. However, there is very little that Garchomp will be able to KO through Focus Sash or Haban, and Substitute isn't common enough to warrant the drop in Accuracy from Dragon Claw. Garchomp's only other real offensive option is a Fire-type attack: either Fire Fang or Fire Blast. The extra coverage on Steel-types such as Bronzong, Scizor, and Ferrothorn can be useful. Garchomp can use Sandstorm to activate its own Sand Veil and remove opposing weathers, but it is often easier to bring in Tyranitar. Dragon Tail can be used to check Trick Room, as its priority is slightly higher than Trick Room's, allowing Garchomp to force the Trick Room user out before it can set up. A choice set with either Choice Band or Choice Scarf is viable. A boosting set with Swords Dance can be used, but Garchomp will rarely find the time to set up. Finally, Double Team in conjunction with Substitute, Leftovers, and Sand Veil can make Garchomp very difficult to take down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Choice Scarf Abomasnow makes one of the best checks to Garchomp, often outspeeding both Garchomp and its partner and threatening them with a 100% accurate Blizzard. The fact that Garchomp is usually paired with a Flying-type does nothing to help the situation. Icy Wind Cresselia is one of the most solid counters to Garchomp, breaking Garchomp's Yache Berry, dropping its Speed, and dealing some damage. Latios outspeeds and poses an immediate threat with Draco Meteor, but if Garchomp is able to get a Speed boost (such as Tailwind from Zapdos), then Garchomp is the one threatening the knock out. Finally, Bronzong stops Garchomp cold and can use the turns to set up screens, set up Trick Room, or just use Gyro Ball.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Garchomp is a fairly straightforward Pokemon. Earthquake is Garchomp's main offensive option, providing powerful spread damage. Dragon Claw is Garchomp's other STAB, and it hits Pokemon that are immune or resistant to Earthquake such as Ludicolo and Zapdos. Rock Slide provides more spread damage and also hurts Flying-types. Because of the reduction in power to spread moves, however, Rock Slide actually does less damage to a single target than Dragon Claw. Therefore, Substitute can be used instead as it eases prediction for Garchomp against slower foes and can give you a huge advantage on a predicted Protect. Finally, Protect serves its standard purposes in doubles: giving Garchomp's partner time to take out threats, easing prediction, and stalling out field effects.</p> <p>Yache Berry protects Garchomp from the extremely common Ice Beam and Blizzard, as well as Hidden Power Ice. The extra protection allows Garchomp to live much longer. If you are unconcerned with guarding Garchomp from Ice-type attacks, a Dragon Gem can be used instead. Dragon Gem allows Garchomp to OHKO other Garchomp, a huge advantage on an otherwise neutral playing field. Another item choice, Haban Berry, allows Garchomp to handle Latios better. In general, Yache is the better option because Ice-type attacks are much more widespread than Dragon-type ones. Even if Garchomp holds a Haban Berry, Latios still OHKOes with Dragon Gem and comes close to guaranteeing an OHKO with Life Orb. Additionally, opposing Garchomp will not OHKO Haban-less Garchomp with Dragon Claw unless they have an Adamant nature, which does not even guarantee an OHKO. Focus Sash can be used to save Garchomp from both of its weaknesses, but it requires you to keep Garchomp safe from Fake Outs, Rock Slides, Heat Waves, and other weak attacks in order to work. Hail damage will also break Garchomp's Focus Sash, making it nearly useless against Abomasnow. Despite the fact that Jolly Garchomp will actually lose 1v1 to Adamant Garchomp, Jolly is used because of the numerous Pokemon that fall between the two Speeds, such as positive Speed Landorus and Volcarona. Sand Veil is the superior ability if Garchomp has sandstorm support, as it provides an opportunity for a potentially game-breaking miss against Garchomp. However, without sandstorm being present, Rough Skin is the superior ability as Sand Veil would be useless.</p> <p>Crunch is a viable option for Garchomp if you dislike both Rock Slide and Substitute. It does more damage to Cresselia than anything else in Garchomp's arsenal aside from the unreliable Outrage and also allows Garchomp to do at least decent damage to Bronzong while hoping for Defense drops. Garchomp's best teammates are obviously Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake, whether it be through Levitate or a Flying typing. The most famous partner is Zapdos, which completes the well known \"ZapChomp\" combo when paired together with Garchomp. Other competent partners include Yanmega, Gengar, and Cresselia. Cresselia is especially noteworthy because it can use Icy Wind to drop Latios's Speed so that Garchomp can outspeed it. Cresselia can also use Helping Hand to power up Garchomp's Earthquake. Tyranitar provides good support to Garchomp, especially if Garchomp is using Substitute. Tyranitar activates Sand Veil for Garchomp and gets rid of hail which, combined with Substitute damage, can eat through Garchomp's HP quickly. Clearly you don't want both Tyranitar and Garchomp out at the same time often due to Tyranitar's weakness to Earthquake, but as a switch-in to Blizzard Tyranitar functions well.</p>"

  "Lucario": {
    "overview": "<p>Lucario is certainly an oddball in the circle of Fighting-types. It can use special and physical attacks to great effect, courtesy of its great offensive stats, and while at first glance it is subpar defensively, its typing lets it survive more onslaughts than one would imagine at first. Lucario's movepool gives it a lot of room to work with as well; the highlights of its unique movepool include the rare Follow Me, Heal Pulse, and plenty of priority moves. These combine to make Lucario a versatile threat. However, its base 90 Speed is somewhat lacking when compared to common Pokemon, such as Terrakion, and its defenses are overshadowed by bulkier Fighting-types, such as Hitmontop and Conkeldurr. Given this, Lucario isn't the kind of Pokemon that can be slapped on a team without any thought behind it. Rather, it is best used as the glue for a team. Keep this at the back of your mind and play Lucario to its strengths, and your opponent will wish they never crossed the aura guardian.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Without a doubt, Lucario's movepool spans even greater depths than the main options. Bullet Punch is another good priority move to use on physical sets, as it hits Rock- and Ice-types, namely Weavile and Terrakion, respectively, super effectively. Blaze Kick and Thunder Punch are nice extra coverage moves, though they are situational. Rock Slide and Earthquake are generic spread moves, though Lucario usually has something better to do with its moveslots. Dragon Pulse has good neutral coverage and can hit Kingdra harder than Hidden Power Ice, but beyond that, an Ice- or Dark-type move is more useful. Shadow Ball can be used over Dark Pulse, but the flinch chance is more worthwhile in short VGC matches. As far as supporting attacks go, Lucario receives Low Sweep, Force Palm, and Feint. Low Sweep and Force Palm can be used over Drain Punch on the support set, though Low Sweep unfortunately only hits one target, and Force Palm requires a little luck. Feint can prevent Pokemon from Protecting against your Latios's Draco Meteor, but is usually outclassed by Extreme Speed due to Feint's 30 Base Power. If you want to draw in more attacks with Follow Me on any of the sets, resist berries, such as Occa and Shuca Berries, can make your Lucario more sturdy. Focus Sash also does this, but Lucario is bulky enough to forgo the item. Steadfast and Justified are Lucario's other abilities, though Steadfast boosts aren't as useful for short matches, and Justified requires that Lucario give up the ability to use its egg moves, and to a lesser extent, the level up moves it receives as Riolu.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Lucario may have good bulk against neutral attacks, but it can't stand the thought of STAB super effective ones. Bulky Fighting-types, such as Conkeldurr and Hitmontop, can sponge most of Lucario's attacks and hit back with STAB Drain Punch or Close Combat, or if Lucario is at low enough health, Mach Punch. Sun teams have plenty of Pokemon that are capable of taking on Lucario; Volcarona and Chandelure are but a few. Chandelure, as well as Shedinja, are especially big problems for Lucario if the aura guardian lacks Crunch or Dark Pulse, though it would be wise to scout out one of those moves before boldly switching either one in. Garchomp can take Lucario's priority moves well and can negate Follow Me with Earthquake; it also commonly holds a Yache Berry so it can survive an Ice Punch. Toxicroak in rain can take any of Lucario's attacks not named Psychic or Zen Headbutt and KO it with Drain Punch. Finally, bulky Ground-types are Lucario's worst enemy, though Gastrodon won't enjoy too many Close Combats, and Hippowdon doesn't like Hidden Power Ice.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>A physically based set is Lucario's standby in any metagame, and it's not hard to see why. Access to Extreme Speed and the powerful Close Combat solidify this set's usefulness, and Crunch makes sure Lucario isn't walled by Ghost-types. Of course, using Crunch means Lucario has a hard time getting past the likes of Salamence and Dragonite, but pairing Lucario up with Latios, Garchomp, or Weavile can remedy this. The same could also be said of Ice Punch, so use whichever move your team requires in the third slot. Follow Me is a great move to have in general, though if you want Lucario to last longer, Detect is a viable alternative.</p> <p>Life Orb is a staple item simply because it allows Lucario to hit as hard as it can without being locked into a move via a Choice item. However, if you feel this undermines Lucario's ability to utilize Follow Me, resist berries, such as Chople or Occa Berries, as well as elemental Gems—Fighting Gem in particular—can help Follow Me reach its full potential. Alternative Fighting-type moves, such as Cross Chop, are options over Close Combat if the Defense and Special Defense drop worry you. Although an Adamant nature is usually preferred to let Lucario hit as hard as possible, a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed neutral base 100 Speed Pokemon.</p> <p>Cresselia makes an excellent partner for Lucario, as it takes pitiful damage from common Fighting-types, particularly Hitmontop, and can slow down faster threats, such as Terrakion, with Thunder Wave and Icy Wind. Both Cresselia and Tornadus can smack said Fighting-types with their respective STAB moves, but Tornadus just barely misses out on OHKOing Terrakion with Acrobatics, requiring Lucario to finish it off with Extreme Speed. Gengar, while not directly being able to counter Fighting-types, enjoys Follow Me support against users of Sucker Punch, Shadow Ball, and other super effective attacks. Additionally, with good prediction, Gengar can use Disable to put a stop to moves that are dangerous to Lucario, such as Mach Punch, most notably from Hitmontop, since it is frequently the only Fighting-type move Hitmontop carries.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>While this set forgoes the powerful Close Combat and Extreme Speed, it focuses on Lucario's slightly higher Special Attack stat, and renders useless the Attack-lowering effect of the common Intimidate. Aura Sphere and Vacuum Wave should be self-explanatory; one is a strong, reliable STAB move that never misses, and the other is a STAB priority move that is used in a similar vein as Extreme Speed. Dark Pulse and Hidden Power Ice are Lucario's coverage moves, and which one you choose should reflect what your team needs to cover. Hidden Power Ice provides coverage against Dragon-types, such as Garchomp and Dragonite, while Dark Pulse hits common supporters, such as Dusclops and Cresselia, for super effective damage, possibly flinching them in the process. Follow Me is slightly more effective on a special set than a physical one due to the lack of defense drops caused by Close Combat, and is in general a great move to have in the doubles environment. However, you might need Lucario itself to stay alive for an extra turn, so Detect is available as well.</p> <p>If you don't like Life Orb's recoil interfering with Follow Me, resist berries and Fighting Gem are viable items as well. As always, Psychic-types, such as Cresselia, make excellent Lucario partners, as do Flying-types, such as Tornadus. Togekiss has the rare ability to paralyze Ground-types, such as Garchomp, can provide Lucario with its own Follow Me or Helping Hand support, and can handily defeat most Fighting-types with Air Slash. Dusclops enjoys protection from Shadow Ball, can burn opposing Fighting-types, and can help Lucario score OHKOes with Helping Hand; for example, Lucario can decimate Terrakion with Vacuum Wave in a sandstorm after a boost. Latios can make a good offensive partner as it can smite other Dragon-types with Draco Meteor while Lucario diverts their attacks or finishes off survivors.</p>"
      },
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>While this set may look odd at first given Lucario's poor defenses, it takes advantage of Lucario's excellent support movepool, unique typing, and great priority move in Extreme Speed. With resistances to Dragon-, Ice-, Dark-, and Grass-type moves, Lucario makes the perfect Follow Me supporter to use alongside Dragon-types or on rain teams, or even both, in Kingdra's case. No longer must your fast sweepers fear priority moves or super effective attacks from common checks, as Lucario delivers a Follow Me and lives with enough health to take more punishment. Drain Punch is Lucario's main source of healing, and still has a respectable 75 Base Power. Extreme Speed is of course Lucario's main priority, and since it has +2 priority instead of the usual +1, it will even finish off threats packing priority moves themselves, such as Weavile, Hitmontop, and Abomasnow. The last slot is delegated to the other interesting support moves Lucario has to offer, mainly Helping Hand and Heal Pulse. Heal Pulse can be used to heal up your Politoed or Latios, but it is especially annoying with a Spore user, such as Breloom. Helping Hand has a more immediate effect: it turns already deadly moves, such as Draco Meteor and Thunder, into pure, uncontrolled balls of wrath with Base Powers of over 180. Detect, the most conservative choice, keeps Lucario safe from gang attacks and spread moves, such as Earthquake. A Sitrus Berry is usually preferred to allow Lucario to take two Heat Waves from Infernape, and other similar attacks, but Chople Berry allows Lucario to survive at least one Close Combat from common enemies in Hitmontop and Terrakion.</p> <p>As you have probably noticed, this Lucario normally has no moves to touch Ghost-types with. This can be remedied by using Crunch over a given move, using a special set with Vacuum Wave and Dark Pulse, or simply equipping your partner with moves to handle Ghost-types; this is all the more reason for not plopping support Lucario on any team without any thought. Pokemon that can take advantage of Lucario's Follow Me, Extreme Speed, Helping Hand, or Heal Pulse support make good teammates. Politoed, Latios, Kingdra, and Haxorus make good teammates in this regard, as each appreciates protection from respective super effective attacks. Dragon Dance Haxorus can take advantage of the surprise factor that support Lucario generates to nab at least one boost, but due to Lucario's typing, it'll have to be careful when using Earthquake. Latios appreciates protection from Sucker Punch, a move commonly used to check the jet dragon. Politoed and Kingdra soften Fire-type attacks with Drizzle and Rain Dance, respectively, and appreciate protection from Grass- and Dragon-type moves, respectively.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Lucario's Special Defense, allowing it to take moves such as Heat Wave and Ice Beam more easily. For example, Volcarona needs a Quiver Dance, Helping Hand, or sun boost to OHKO this Lucario with Heat Wave, though there's a chance even then that it will hang on by a sliver of health. A spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def with an Impish nature can be used if Lucario wants to take physical moves, such as Dragon Claw, more easily.</p>"

  "Hippowdon": {
    "overview": "<p>As the slowest fully evolved weather inducer with a base Speed of 47, Hippowdon can typically be relied upon to set up its sandstorm, as well as function in Trick Room. While Hippowdon's support options are less useful in doubles play than in singles, the sand hippo takes physical hits like a boss thanks to its great physical bulk, and retaliates back with an above average base 112 Attack and powerful spread moves. Although Tyranitar is most often picked as the sandstorm inducer for a sand team, Hippowdon is still worth considering.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hippowdon does not have a great offensive movepool, and its great support movepool is admittedly more useful in singles than doubles. Rock Slide, Fire Fang, and Thunder Fang are options that can be used over Ice Fang and Crunch. As with Ice Fang, Rock Slide complements Earthquake well, together forming the QuakeSlide combo, which provides great neutral coverage barring Pokemon such as Breloom. Fire Fang is an option because a max Attack Hippowdon can OHKO a 252 HP / 0 Def Abomasnow with Fire Fang, while surviving Abomasnow's assaults. In addition, Fire Fang hits Steel-types super effectively, most notably Bronzong, which resists both Earthquake and Ice Fang. Thunder Fang alternatively gains super effective coverage on Water-types, most notably Gyarados, which can Intimidate and wall Hippowdon. Yawn can be used over Crunch to force switches, and is especially effective due to the lack of sleep clause. Roar or Whirlwind can be used in order to phaze Trick Room setters that threaten your team.</p> <p>A specially defensive set consisting of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD Sassy nature can be used with a Sassy nature to help take on rain teams. With this EV spread, Hippowdon can survive a Rain boosted Surf without any recovery moves, and can survive two Surfs outside of rain from Kingdra. However, there is a small chance of being 2HKOed, so a Sitrus Berry or Passho Berry can be used to reliably survive. In addition, outside of rain, Hippowdon holding a Passho Berry can survive an assault of Hydro Pump followed by Surf.</p> <p>Rindo Berry can be used to take Grass-type attacks, but Grass-type attacks are not common in VGC 2012. If you want to make absolutely sure that Hippowdon sets up Sandstorm, Iron Ball can be used. This will drop Hippowdon’s Speed to a paltry 23, making it slower than all weather starters bar the virtually nonexistent Snover, along with most Trick Room sweepers.</p> <p>Hippowdon's Dream World ability is Sand Force, which boosts its Ground-, Rock-, and Steel-type attacks by 30% in sandstorm. This will boost Hippowdon's Earthquake and Rock Slide, but another Pokemon will have to set up sandstorm for Hippowdon to abuse this ability. In addition, this removes Hippowdon's niche in the metagame as the slowest weather inducer. On the other hand, the lack of sandstorm may be a boon to some teams that need a physically bulky Pokemon but do not appreciate the introduction of the residual damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Powerful special attacks such as Hydro Pump and Grass Knot can take down Hippowdon. The majority of bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Gyarados, can shrug off Hippowdon's attacks and swiftly KO with their own STAB moves. In addition, burn hurts Hippowdon badly, depleting its health and limiting its damage output.</p>",

      "Physical Tank": {
        "description": "<p>This set utilizes Hippowdon's slow speed and strong attack to function as a bulky physical sweeper. Earthquake is Hippowdon's strongest STAB spread move, as well as its most reliable way of dealing damage. Ice Fang complements Earthquake nicely, hitting the Flying-types that are immune to Earthquake, as well as Latios. In addition, Ice Fang decimates Garchomp, which has high bulk to take Earthquake and has Sand Veil to abuse sandstorm. Crunch hits bulky Psychic-types for super effective damage and Levitate Bronzong for neutral damage. Protect is a staple for doubles, but Slack Off can be used to provide Hippowdon with recovery. Leftovers is recommended in conjunction with Slack Off in order to assist in stalling.</p> <p>Sitrus Berry is the recommended item for Hippowdon due to the instant recovery it provides. However, if you already have Sitrus Berry on another Pokemon, Passho Berry is a useful alternative, allowing Hippowdon to take common Water-type attacks. However, a 252 HP / 0 SpD Hippowdon can survive even relatively strong STAB Scalds, such as from Politoed, Ludicolo, and Suicune without relying on Passho Berry.</p> <p>252 HP EVs and 4 Def EVs give Hippowdon more bulk, buffering it against the likes of a Dragon Claw from Garchomp and a Close Combat from Terrakion. 252 Attack EVs along with a Brave nature allow Hippowdon to hit as hard as possible. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def can be used with a Relaxed nature, to increase Hippowdon's physical bulk, although its damage is decreased significantly. Another alternative spread is 252 HP / 36 Def / 220 SpD with a Relaxed nature; this enables Hippowdon to easily survive a max Special Attack Abomasnow's Grass Knot and Blizzard, allowing Hippowdon to survive and switch out, living to start the Sandstorm for another day. In addition, when armed with a Passho Berry, this Hippowdon can survive a rain boosted Hydro Pump from Kingdra.</p> <p>Hippowdon appreciates Trick Room support due to its low base Speed. Therefore, partners such as Bronzong, Cresselia, and Musharna are great teammates because they not only can set up Trick Room, but are also immune to Earthquake thanks to their abilities. Furthermore, they have high bulk and access to Light Screen, which allows Hippowdon to take more special attacks. Cresselia and Musharna both have Helping Hand, increasing Hippowdon's damage output.</p> <p>Zapdos can help Hippowdon by striking Water-types with its strong Electric-type moves and by OHKOing Abomasnow with a super effective Heat Wave. Conversely, Hippowdon can support Zapdos by threatening Rock-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar with Earthquake. Furthermore, Hippowdon and Zapdos can utilize the Discharge and Earthquake combo due to immunity to each other's STAB moves.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With poor defenses, above-average Attack, and mediocre Speed, some might wonder why Toxicroak should be considered at all on a competitive team. However, Toxicroak's Dry Skin ability allows it to recover some of its HP every turn rain is falling. In addition, Water-type attacks heal Toxicroak up to 25% of its original HP. Add Toxicroak's array of useful priority moves to this mix, and you have yourself one Pokemon that takes great advantage of rain.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to the trouble Toxicroak has with Flying-types, Ice Punch can serve as a viable option to hit them for super effective damage; it also gives coverage on Grass-types. However, be warned that Drain Punch and Ice Punch on the same moveset is illegal, so you'll be forced to use either Cross Chop or Brick Break instead. Poison Jab provides Toxicroak with a secondary STAB move, although it gives little additional coverage and leaves Toxicroak without a way to significantly damage Psychic-types. If one is looking for priority, a set of Fake Out, Vacuum Wave, Sucker Punch, and Bullet Punch will allow Toxicroak to go first almost always, but its damage output will likely leave much to be desired. One might look to Swords Dance or Nasty Plot to boost Toxicroak's stats, but the fast-paced VGC metagame leaves little time for stat-boosting moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>One of the main counters to Toxicroak is not a Pokemon, but a weather condition. Dry Skin actually depletes Toxicroak's health every turn that sun is in effect, while also increasing the amount of damage it takes from Fire-type assaults, meaning that sun teams give Toxicroak a lot of grief. Flying-type Pokemon such as Tornadus and Togekiss can push around Toxicroak lacking Ice Punch, hitting it hard with a super effective Flying-type move and taking little from its counterattacks. Additionally, Psychic-types are often hard counters to Toxicroak; Cresselia in particular can tank even a super effective Sucker Punch with ease and fire back a 4x super effective Psychic. Pokemon such as Garchomp both outspeed and OHKO Toxicroak with Earthquake, making its life difficult.</p>",

      "Fake Out Lead": {
        "description": "<p>With Fake Out, Toxicroak gives its partner time to set up a move such as Tailwind, or eliminate a dangerous threat to your team. Drain Punch gives Toxicroak a reliable STAB attack as well as additional healing, increasing its lifespan by several turns. Low Kick, however, generally has a higher damage output, although Blissey and Chansey are among the few notable exceptions to this rule. Sucker Punch gives Toxicroak a fantastic priority move, allowing it to pick off weakened foes or damage Choice-locked opponents before they can attack. If used in combination with Taunt, Sucker Punch forces Trick Room users such as Dusclops to attack; as most of them are weak to Dark-type moves, Toxicroak can smack them hard with a super effective Sucker Punch.</p> <p>A Focus Sash allows Toxicroak to stay alive for an additional, crucial turn. If one finds Toxicroak's attacking power lacking, a Life Orb can be used to boost its damage output, at the cost of reduced longevity. Toxicroak does not benefit from a Speed-boosting nature; instead, it should boost its Attack with an Adamant nature.</p> <p>Dry Skin is the main draw of Toxicroak, so a teammate who can set rain up is naturally needed. Politoed is the best Pokemon for this, as Drizzle lets it summon eternal rain. Additionally, Politoed can use Surf to both deal damage and heal Toxicroak. Parasect is an ideal partner for Toxicroak as well, as it draws off Psychic-type attacks with Rage Powder and can hit Psychic-types super effectively with its STAB X-Scissor.</p>"

      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With this set, Toxicroak is able to stay on the field for an extended period of time, and act as a counter to opposing rain teams. Fake Out buys time to get in an auto-rain Pokemon such as Politoed, but if you want additional rain support, Rain Dance is a satisfactory alternative. While Low Kick might have been viable on the former set, Drain Punch is too good to pass up on this set, which revolves around recovery. As before, Sucker Punch gives Toxicroak a strong priority move with which to damage Ghost- and Psychic-types that give it trouble. From behind a Substitute, Toxicroak is difficult to stop, as it recovers HP from rain, Drain Punch, and Black Sludge, as well as teammates that utilize Surf. All these traits allow Toxicroak to wall opposing rain teams to no end, as well as take on some of its more dangerous counters, such as Cresselia.</p> <p>Black Sludge allows Toxicroak to recover some of its health every turn, which works well in concert with Drain Punch and healing from Dry Skin. If for some reason this is found to be undesirable, a Focus Sash is a viable alternative, as the constant healing allows for multiple uses. 252 EVs are invested in both HP and Attack to power up Toxicroak's moves and increase the amount of damage it can take. Toxicroak has little to worry about in terms of Speed, however, and as such is able to run an Adamant nature with no worry.</p>"

  "Abomasnow": {
    "overview": "<p>In every year of VGC where it has been allowed, Abomasnow has been an excellent Pokemon. With its unique ability, Snow Warning, it is able to shut down most weather strategies, which nullifies several threatening playstyles in the metagame. In addition, hail allows Abomasnow to use an extremely powerful STAB Blizzard that hits both opponents. Although Abomasnow may not have the greatest defensive typing or stats in the metagame, its excellent ability combined with its powerful moves makes it an effective Pokemon on most teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire is an option on the Choice Scarf set in order to hit Steel-types, such as Scizor and Metagross, super effectively. However, it lowers Abomasnow's Speed IV to 30, which can be terrible for Abomasnow in a mirror match. Wood Hammer can be used over Abomasnow's Grass-type move of choice, as it hits certain Pokemon such as Blissey much harder. Earthquake is another option to hit Steel- and Fire-types super effectively, but usually will not hit hard enough off of Abomasnow's uninvested Attack stat. Due to Item Clause, there may be instances where Abomasnow is unable to use Focus Sash. If this is the case, Occa Berry and Chople Berry are options to allow Abomasnow to survive some weaker super effective moves.</p> <p>Abomasnow gets Soundproof from the Dream World. While it can allow you to use Abomasnow without having your team damaged by hail, and render Abomasnow immune to Bug Buzz, compared to Snow Warning it is practically useless.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Changing the weather will significantly nerf Abomasnow's main attack: Blizzard. Ninetales and Tyranitar are the best options, as Ninetales resists both of Abomasnow's STAB attacks and both can hit it super effectively with STAB attacks of their own. Tyranitar needs to watch out for Grass Knot while switching in, however. Scizor and Metagross can take any of Abomasnow's attacks (except Hidden Power Fire) and take it out with Bullet Punch and Meteor Mash, respectively. Occa Berry is also helpful as it lets these Pokemon survive Hidden Power Fire. Hitmontop can also cause problems for Abomasnow, being able to use a combination of Close Combat and Sucker Punch to defeat it. Abomasnow is extremely frail, and nearly any super effective attack will either OHKO it or bring it down to its Focus Sash.</p>",

        "description": "<p>With this set, Abomasnow can abuse its most useful quality in Snow Warning while dishing out large amounts of damage to many Pokemon in the metagame. Blizzard is an amazing move, hitting both opponents. In addition, it hits common Pokemon such as Zapdos and Garchomp for super effective damage. Giga Drain is a secondary STAB attack, hitting Water-types, which resist Blizzard, super effectively. Grass Knot can be used to hit heavy Pokemon such as Tyranitar harder, but Abomasnow will miss the healing provided by Giga Drain. Although this Abomasnow has no EVs in Attack, Ice Shard is still an excellent STAB priority attack and can finish off weakened Pokemon, especially with added damage from hail; it can also do a reasonable amount of damage to Pokemon that it hits super effectively. Ice Beam is an option if you are concerned about the weather changing after Abomasnow has been sent out, and also hits a single opponent harder than Blizzard due to the power drop caused when multiple Pokemon are targeted. Protect is a standard move on many Pokemon in the metagame, and Abomasnow is no exception—not only does it allow Abomasnow to avoid Fake Out, but it also allows Abomasnow to preserve its Focus Sash for an extra turn and add extra residual damage via hail.</p> <p>A Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs give Abomasnow a better chance of getting hail up on a double switch or at the beginning of the battle. The EVs maximize Abomasnow's Special Attack, as it is somewhat mediocre; the rest of the EVs go into HP, as Abomasnow does not want Speed. If being faster than opposing Abomasnow is a more important priority than getting hail up, an alternative EV spread of 156 HP / 252 SpA / 100 Spe with a Modest nature can be used. If you still want to be faster than opposing Abomasnow while not giving up too much weather control, Abomasnow can run 2 Speed IVs to outspeed standard Abomasnow. Focus Sash allows Abomasnow to survive nearly any hit. Even though this set uses HP EVs, Abomasnow is still extremely frail; Focus Sash alleviates this to some degree, however.</p> <p>Because this Abomasnow is quite slow, it works well in Trick Room. Cresselia is an excellent partner for this reason—not only can it set up Trick Room, but it can also use Helping Hand to strengthen the power of Abomasnow's Blizzard, and Psychic to weaken pesky Fighting-types that would otherwise easily OHKO Abomasnow. Fire- and Steel-types wall every one of Abomasnow's moves, so a Water-type, such as Rotom-W, or a Ground-type can be a good partner to help to take out these Pokemon.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf, Abomasnow can overcome its mediocre Speed in order to spam its powerful STAB Blizzard. As Blizzard is such a good offensive move, hitting both opponents, it should be Abomasnow's main move. Giga Drain allows Abomasnow to take out Water-types that resist Blizzard, as well as Tyranitar, which might switch in to prevent consistent usage of Blizzard. Grass Knot, despite hitting Rotom-W for only a measly 20 Base Power, does a huge amount of damage to Tyranitar. Although it may seem strange to use it on a Choice Scarf set, Ice Shard is used because Abomasnow is not extremely fast even after the Choice Scarf boost. Sheer Cold is a desperation move, and should only be used when Abomasnow would otherwise have to freeze the opponent with Blizzard to win. Because Sheer Cold's 30% accuracy is still higher than Blizzard's 10% chance to freeze, it can increase your chances of winning in certain circumstances. Light Screen, while unorthodox, can allow Abomasnow's teammates to survive important attacks. It should only be used if it is vital that a teammate survives or if both opponents resist all of Abomasnow's other moves.</p> <p>The EVs and nature maximize Abomasnow's Speed in order to take advantage of the Choice Scarf boost. The rest of the EVs go into Special Attack so Abomasnow can deal as much damage as possible with Blizzard.</p> <p>Helping Hand helps the Choice Scarf set much more, as Abomasnow will usually be able to use Blizzard with the Choice Scarf Speed boost. Terrakion, while usually not seen running Helping Hand, is a great partner for Abomasnow, as it can defeat Tyranitar and Ninetales without much trouble—two Pokemon that prevent Abomasnow from using Blizzard. Garchomp also works well with Abomasnow, as it enjoys the lack of Flying-types created by Blizzard in order to use Earthquake more effectively; this strategy becomes even more effective as Abomasnow resists Earthquake.</p>"

Unfortunately, its below-average defenses and weaknesses to two of the most common priority attacks, Mach Punch and Bullet Punch, prevent Weavile from completely dominating the scene. A lack of spread attacks also means that Weavile is incredibly predictable. Nevertheless, Weavile's ability to pick apart offensive teams is what sets it apart from other Fake Out users.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt works very well on Weavile, stopping Trick Room from rendering its high Speed useless. Substitute is a decent option if a double Protect is predicted, but this is more risky due to the common spread and priority attacks. Ice Gem is a viable item option too, powering up Ice Punch or Ice Shard for one turn without locking Weavile into one move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Steel-type Pokemon who do not take super effective damage from Low Kick are Weavile's best counters; Metagross and Scizor are the best options, quickly 2HKOing Weavile with Bullet Punch. Conkeldurr and Hitmontop OHKO Weavile with Mach Punch after using Protect against the Fake Out. Choice Scarf Fire-type Pokemon, such as Chandelure, Charizard, and Heatran, only let Weavile use Fake Out before being KOed by Heat Wave. Although its Fake Out is slower, Infernape takes negligible damage from all of Weavile's attacks and can OHKO back with a STAB move of choice.

However, it excels at grabbing OHKOs after turn one, something which many other Fake Out users fail at. STAB-boosted Night Slash does heavy damage to common VGC 2012 walls such as Cresselia, Latias, and Dusknoir. Ice Punch is a fantastic STAB attack to have coming off of base 125 Speed, as Garchomp, Zapdos, and other Dragon- and Flying-type Pokemon are on almost every team. Ice Punch also gives coverage on Amoonguss, one of the most annoying defensive walls in the metagame. Ice Shard is another STAB option, and its added priority is a useful tool against faster Pokemon, such as Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Garchomp. However, Ice Shard's lower Base Power is an issue, and it thus does not get the same KOs that Ice Punch does. Low Kick hits Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon for serious damage, and serves as a decently powerful coverage option as most of them are heavy and are hit by Low Kick at 120 Base Power.</p> <p>Weavile will always win the Fake Out war against Hitmontop, Infernape, and Scrafty due to its higher Speed. Pickpocket is the better ability choice over Pressure, allowing Weavile to actually get some use out of it's ability. However it only finds use when holding items such as Focus Sash and other consumable items. A Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs are used to Speed tie with other Weavile and positive-natured Swellow.

Water-type Pokemon work very well with Weavile, as they provide a Heat Wave resistance and appreciate the removal of Zapdos. Tailwind users or slower Pokemon that use strong spread attacks can also benefit from Weavile's fast Fake Out.</p>"

Its stats aren't much to show off, but with Base 110 HP, Lickilicky has the bulk to stay in the battle and mess around with your opponent's weather.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Other options for held items are Normal Gem and Grass Gem. Normal Gem allows Return or Explosion to be boosted, while Grass Gem allows Lickilicky to always OHKO 252 HP Politoed, which is incredibly useful. Lickilicky can also make use of Body Slam as a solid STAB move over Return if getting to max happiness proves to be too difficult. Chople Berry is another option for a held item, as it weakens the blow of super effective Fighting-type attacks, which can certainly help Lickilicky in tough situations.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Lickilicky has a whole group of counters and checks because it really doesn't have any great stats or resistances to boast. Anything that lives its attacks and hits hard enough to weaken it or OHKO it can be a counter since Lickilicky really isn't capable of throwing out masses of damage consistently. Against well-played weather teams, Lickilicky will often be the first thing your opponent would want to remove, so it can end up just being a giant pink target, and can be taken down with ease.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The move selection on Lickilicky might seem a little odd at first, especially to those expecting something a little less offensive. However, this set serves its purpose well. A Life Orb-backed Power Whip almost always OHKOs 252 HP Politoed, which certainly messes around with weather. Return provides a strong STAB attack, which can hit Abomasnow for high damage, something which Power Whip and Earthquake can't do. Earthquake hits Ninetales and Steel-types for high damage, although the reduction in power caused by hitting two Pokemon makes it much less powerful than expected. Explosion is another option instead of Return, although a Normal Gem would be useful in that case to make up for the lack of a Defense drop this generation along with the spread move power reduction. Protect is useful for stalling out your opponent and scouting for dangerous moves.</p> <p>Lickilicky isn't anything too incredible. Its most reliable way of getting rid of Politoed, Tyranitar, and Hippowdon is Power Whip, which has a lacking 85% accuracy. Return is easy to use in simulator play, but in cartridge play, raising its happiness to the max is a long process and can be very tedious. Earthquake is weakened in doubles since it is a spread move and so it doesn't hit too hard, especially coming off of Lickilicky's base 85 attack stat. If using Explosion, be sure it will definitely KO what it needs to hit, as otherwise weather will return to normal without any benefits to your side. Without its ability, Lickilicky would probably never see much use.</p> <p>Lickilicky is extremely slow, only having 50 Base Speed. Because of this, it appreciates Trick Room support. If using Lickilicky under Trick Room, a 0 Speed IV is recommended in order to be sure you can outrun common threats under Trick Room. Common Trick Room setters such as Cresselia and Musharna pair well with Lickilicky because they aren't hit by Earthquake and also provide Helping Hand support. In addition to that, they also resist Fighting-type moves and can hit back with super effective Psychic-type attacks. Pokemon like Togekiss and Zapdos can also be great partners, since Zapdos has a Fighting-type resistance and and both have the ability to hit back hard. Pokemon that hit Steel-types for super effective damage, such as Heatran, Hitmontop, Garchomp, and any other Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-types also serve as good partners. Setting up Trick Room can also counter weather as well, as weathers like rain and sun can be used to abuse Swift Swim and Chlorophyll, respectively.</p> <p>Against hail and sand, Lickilicky appreciates partners that can aid it in countering the setters and abusers. Pokemon such as Bronzong fill that role well, with moves such as STAB Gyro Ball to take care of Tyranitar and Abomasnow. Lickilicky loves Helping Hand support to make up for its lacking attack power against common threats.</p> <p>Lickilicky's best asset isn't a strong offense. Its niche in the VGC 2012 metagame is its ability: Cloud Nine. Lickilicky really just wants to stay alive and on the field for as long as possible to mess with your opponent's weather. If your team handles weather nicely, then it probably won't need Lickilicky's assistance. It serves a very specific role, and if your opponent doesn't run weather, you pretty much only have 5 other Pokemon to choose from because you won't want to be using Lickilicky.</p>"

Sadly, Rhyperior's lacking Special Defense allows many special attackers to check it. Rhyperior's ability, Solid Rock, helps that weakness somewhat, though. Overall, Rhyperior's excellent HP and Defense stats are what really aid his survivability in battle.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rhyperior's large movepool includes some interesting alternative options such as Avalanche, the elemental punches and fangs, and Hammer Arm. In most cases, using these moves is inadvisable due to the difficulty of finding space on a set. Rhyperior already has pretty good coverage and using these moves ruins that. Rock Blast can break Substitutes, sashes, and Charti Berries, but Rock Slide is a must-have and Rhyperior is usually better off with more coverage moves instead of two Rock-type attacks. If you are using Rhyperior on a Trick Room team Rock Blast can be especially useful to stop Prankster Pokemon from stalling out your Trick Room with Substitute. Hammer Arm would fit the best if any of these moves were to be used, however, because of the additional effect. It hits Dark-types and Ferrothorn harder, and actually makes Rhyperior \"faster\" with each use under Trick Room. Lastly, a Lum Berry could be used to give Rhyperior an answer to Will-O-Wisp and other status conditions.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Rain teams will absolutely demolish Rhyperior, as it has no hope surviving a rain boosted Surf from common rain abusers. Bulky Ghost-types with Will-O-Wisp, such as Dusclops, can cripple all Rhyperior lacking a Lum Berry. Breloom and Virizion resist Rhyperior's STABs, and can retaliate with Spore and Giga Drain, respectively. Intimidate users such as Gyarados and Hitmontop can weaken Rhyperior's attacks and pick on his weaknesses. Without the right type-resist berry, Rhyperior is also vulnerable to a 2HKO from certain attacks, such as Garchomp's Earthquake when it isn't holding a Shuca Berry, and Metagross's Meteor Mash when it is without a Babiri Berry.</p>",

Protect is a necessity in VGC for prediction and scouting, and Rhyperior is no exception. When considering Rhyperior's weaknesses to common attacking types, Protect's ability to shield it from all attacks for a turn and allow its partner to take out the threatening foe makes it all the more crucial.</p> <p>The EVs are pretty straightforward. They maximize bulk while preserving offensive prowess. A Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs are needed to \"outslow\" as many other Pokemon in battle as possible. Lastly, Lightning Rod is a great ability in doubles. It lures away Electric-type attacks from Pokemon that have trouble with the likes of Thundurus and Zapdos. If this doesn't interest you, Solid Rock can be used to take less damage from super effective attacks. Even with 252 HP EVs, Rhyperior still has trouble surviving certain attacks. Type-resist berries can fix that dilemma. Chople Berry helps Rhyperior survive STAB Close Combats from Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Infernape, Babiri Berry helps Rhyperior survive Metagross's Iron Head or Meteor Mash, while Shuca Berry allows Rhyperior to avoid a 2HKO from almost any Earthquake. Some damage calculations below show how much type-resist berries aid Rhyperior in battle:</p> <ul> <li>252 Atk Adamant Metagross Meteor Mash vs. 252 HP Brave Rhyperior with a Babiri Berry: 35.1% - 41.9%</li> <li> <ul> <li>Fighting Gem 252 Atk Adamant Hitmontop Close Combat vs. 252 HP Brave Rhyperior with a Chople Berry: 49.1% - 58.1%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>252 Atk Jolly Garchomp Earthquake vs. 252 HP Brave Rhyperior with a Shuca Berry: 23%-27.5%</li> </ul> </li> <li></li> </ul> <p>Obviously, in order for Rhyperior to pose a major threat with this set, Trick Room support is needed. Pokemon that can fit this role include Dusclops, Reuniclus, Musharna, and Cresselia. Cresselia receives a special mention for this role; it is immune to Earthquake and can destroy troublesome Fighting-types with Psychic. Dual Screen support can also be used to increase Rhyperior's longevity in battle. Rain teams can destroy Rhyperior with no problem, making Abomasnow a fantastic teammate; it can change the weather, and also destroy Grass- and Water-types with a STAB Grass Knot and Blizzard. Pokemon that take very little to no damage at all from Rhyperior's Earthquakes make great partners. Gyarados is particularly effective because of its fantastic ability, Intimidate, which allows Rhyperior to tank physical hits even better. In return, Rhyperior can lure away Electric-type attacks with Lightning Rod.</p>"

  "Tangrowth": {
    "overview": "<p>There is a plethora of Chlorophyll Pokemon, but Tangrowth sets itself apart from the rest of them for a number of reasons. It has incredible physical bulk, excellent offenses, and access to the crippling Sleep Powder. Its Speed, while low, is high enough for it to just outspeed a good portion of the VGC metagame in sunlight. Tangrowth can't take special attacks at all, though, and can have coverage issues. Nonetheless, it is still one of the better offensive Chlorophyll Pokemon in VGC.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>220 Speed EVs can be run to outspeed Weavile in sun, but some bulk must be sacrificed in order to do so. That being said, Weavile generally doesn't give sun teams much trouble. Tangrowth can opt to run a physically bulky set abusing Substitute and Leech Seed to stall out physically oriented teams. Rage Powder is useful for drawing the opponent's attacks away from Tangrowth's teammate for a turn, especially if the moves in question come from physical attackers. Synthesis restores a large amount of health in sunlight, making Tangrowth more difficult to kill. Knock Off can rob an opponent of their item, disrupting Pokemon relying on a resist Berry, such as an Occa or a Rindo Berry. Leaf Storm is Tangrowth's most powerful move, but the Special Attack cut can be crippling. Stun Spore can slow down opponents, but Sleep Powder is preferable in most cases. Finally, Snatch can steal the effects of valuable moves such as Tailwind, turning the tables on the opponent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Tangrowth has the Special Defense of a wet paper bag, so any fairly powerful special attacker threatens it. Abomasnow is Tangrowth's worst nightmare, robbing it of sunlight and threatening it with Blizzard. Politoed can also threaten Tangrowth with Ice Beam, and sets up its teammates, such as Kingdra, to pose a serious threat to Tangrowth's team. In general, Tangrowth hates losing its sunlight. Special attackers and weather changers aren't the only way to deal with it, though. Without heavy Speed investment, Weavile can outspeed even in sunlight and smash Tangrowth with Ice Punch. Steel-types can usually take everything Tangrowth has to offer and wall it, while Sap Sipper Bouffalant fears nothing from Tangrowth, not even Sleep Powder. However, all of these threats sans Bouffalant must be wary of Sleep Powder if they are not carrying a Lum or Chesto Berry, or are not in a position to outspeed and KO Tangrowth.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sun Support": {
        "description": "<p>Tangrowth's physical bulk allows it to tangle (get it?) with Garchomp, one of the biggest threats to sun teams. Sleep Powder is an incredible move due to the lack of Sleep Clause in VGC, and Tangrowth is just fast enough in the sun to abuse it. Grass Knot is the primary STAB as it hits Pokemon such as Tyranitar for a good chunk of damage, but Giga Drain and Solar Beam are also options worth considering. The former can be much weaker than Grass Knot but provides recovery, while the latter is very powerful but risky against opposing weather teams. Hidden Power Ice OHKOes any non-Yache Berry Garchomp, but Hidden Power Rock is also an option for nailing Chandelure and Flying-types. Due to Tangrowth's physical bulk, it fears little from Tyranitar and can use Sunny Day against it to gain an advantage in the weather war. Protect is a staple move in VGC and shouldn't require much explanation to justify its viability. If Tangrowth finds a free turn it can use Growth to set up, but stat-boosting moves are usually not worth the turn of vulnerability required to use them. Tangrowth does have the option to use this, though, if it can put both opponents to sleep.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Tangrowth to be offensive while still retaining some bulk. Specifically, the Speed EVs allow Tangrowth to outrun Tornadus and Thundurus and anything slower than them in sun. Special Attack is maximized alongside a Modest nature to increase offensive presence, and the rest of the EVs are dumped into HP and defenses to increase bulk. A Yache Berry can allow Tangrowth to set up Sunny Day against a Politoed attempting to KO it with Ice Beam. Unfortunately, it doesn't do much to stop Abomasnow. A Sitrus Berry is an option to better handle physical threats.</p> <p>Ninetales support is mandatory for Tangrowth, as Amoonguss outclasses it otherwise. Hidden Power Fire can be used to nail Abomasnow and Steel-types, but Abomasnow usually beats Tangrowth anyway, and Tangrowth's Fire-type teammates should be more than capable of dispatching opposing Steel-types. Fake Out support from a teammate, such as Infernape or Shiftry, can allow Tangrowth to beat a lead combination employing Trick Room and Fake Out. Tangrowth's partner can use Fake Out itself to flinch the opposing user of Fake Out, and Tangrowth can put the opponent's Trick Room inducer to sleep, blocking the set-up.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Tangrowth is one of the most powerful physical attacking Chlorophyll Pokemon, and just so happens to pose a threat to Tyranitar and Politoed, because it can hit them off their weaker Defense stats. Power Whip is ridiculously powerful, but Seed Bomb is also an option as Power Whip can miss at critical times. Rock Slide provides coverage most notably against Abomasnow, the genies, Chandelure, and other Flying- and Fire-types that resist Tangrowth's Grass-type STAB move. Sleep Powder incapacitates any Pokemon that could prove to be troublesome, and Tangrowth has the bulk to put multiple Pokemon to sleep. Earthquake is an option for enabling Tangrowth to threaten Steel-types such as Metagross, but it comes at the cost of putting Tangrowth's Fire-type teammates at risk, and as such Protect is usually the more reliable option.</p> <p>With the given Speed EVs, Tangrowth can outpace the genies in sunlight. Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature increase its offensive capability, and the remaining EVs are invested in bulk. A Life Orb provides plenty of raw power for when Tangrowth is throwing around its STAB move, but a Sitrus Berry helps Tangrowth stick around longer.</p> <p>Ninetales support is very important for this set. Iron Ball Ninetales can help to ensure that Tangrowth is faster than Tyranitar and Politoed at the beginning of the match, as Ninetales will be slower than Tyranitar and Politoed—provided they don't carry Iron Balls themselves—causing sun to be the last weather to come into effect and therefore the one that stays in effect. Air Balloon is also an option on Ninetales so that Tangrowth can use Earthquake with less risk to its most valuable teammate. Ninetales is the principal means of increasing Tangrowth's Speed, but Tailwind support from the likes of Tornadus or Latios is also helpful in this regard. If Tangrowth can find a free turn—not a common occurrence in VGC—then it can use Swords Dance to go on a rampage. Fake Out support is valuable for disrupting faster sweepers in the early game so that Tangrowth can get in a hit or fire off a Sleep Powder, and is also useful for disrupting Trick Room team openings in tandem with Sleep Powder.</p>"

  "Yanmega": {
    "overview": "<p>Yanmega is a frail, offensive Pokemon that can demolish unprepared teams if given the chance. Its great coverage is complemented by Speed Boost, one of the scariest abilities to play against. Sadly, Yanmega has low defenses and weaknesses to common spread attacks such as Rock Slide, Blizzard, and Heat Wave. Placing Yanmega on a team thus requires good prediction and support, but it will pay off more often than not.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An EV spread of 108 HP / 4 Def / 248 SpA / 148 Spe can be used to better handle weaker spread attacks, such as Garchomp's Rock Slide, while still outspeeding Crobat and Weavile after a Speed boost. Yanmega can also utilize attack-boosting Gems. For example, Bug Gem Bug Buzz puts a serious dent in common bulky Psychic-types such as Cresselia; the absence of Life Orb recoil also helps Yanmega survive Sucker Punches. Hidden Power Ice is a solid option too, to deal more damage to Zapdos and Garchomp. If running Hidden Power Ice, the EVs should be changed to 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe (or 108 HP / 252 SpA / 148 Spe) to account for the IV drop. Frisk is Yanmega's hidden ability, and although it is handy in double battles to scout an item before moves are even chosen, Speed Boost is Yanmega's main selling point.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Flying-type Pokemon in general give Yanmega problems. Zapdos and Thundurus resist everything Yanmega can throw at them and retaliate with super effective Electric-type attacks. Terrakion handles Yanmega with relative ease, but must be wary of Hidden Power Ground. In rain, Ludicolo in the rain is a huge threat to Yanmega, who is hard-pressed to get in two Speed boosts against a rain team. Trick Room teams also give Yanmega much grief, as Trick Room reverses the benefits of Speed Boost.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Yanmega's Life Orb-boosted attacks OHKO a huge number of Pokemon in VGC 2012. Speed Boost and Detect work very well together on this set, as not only does Detect prevent Fake Out, it also allows Yanmega to grab a Speed boost and initiate a sweep. Bug Buzz and Air Slash are Yanmega's main STAB attacks; they provide decent coverage, with the latter also packing a useful flinch rate. Rounding out the moveset is Hidden Power Ground, which severely dents the Fire- and Steel-type threats that take Yanmega's STAB moves all day. Detect is preferred over Protect as the former will not be locked out by an opponent's Imprison.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Yanmega's Special Attack and Speed, allowing it to hit as hard and as fast as possible. Modest is the nature of choice as a Timid nature would cause Yanmega to miss out on some important OHKOs, and even with Modest, +1 Yanmega outspeeds and can OHKO Latios, Weavile, Heatran, Infernape, Abomasnow, as well as Hitmontop that do not fully invest in bulk. Outside of rain, Bug Buzz OHKOes Ludicolo as well. Maximum Speed EVs let +1 Yanmega outpace Timid Choice Scarf Chandelure and Togekiss, Adamant Choice Scarf Heracross, all non-Choice Scarf base 130 Pokemon, and tie with other Yanmega.</p> <p>In addition to having low defenses, Yanmega is also weak to many common spread moves, making building a team around it extremely difficult. In order to function properly, Yanmega needs to have at least one turn to get a Speed boost. Fake Out users help Yanmega immensely, targeting threats such as Zapdos to ease prediction. Additionally, Zapdos is the perfect Yanmega counter, as it resists both of Yanmega's STAB moves, is immune to Hidden Power Ground, and can OHKO Yanmega with Thunderbolt. Weavile and Rhyperior therefore make excellent partners for Yanmega. Weavile provides Fake Out support and can handle Zapdos, while Rhyperior can fend off Zapdos with STAB Rock Slide and draw in Electric-type attacks thanks to Lightningrod.</p>"

  "Gliscor": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Gliscor seems like a poor choice for a sandstorm team compared to its competition. Sure it can Earthquake and it's immune to other Earthquakes, but why would you use Gliscor instead of Landorus? Besides, you'd just be racking up your Water- and Ice-type weaknesses, right? However, upon closer inspection, one finds that Gliscor can be immune to status, has access to the powerful Acrobatics, and can support the entire team with Tailwind, all of which are most appreciated on sandstorm teams in a metagame where Abomasnow reigns and sleep clause is non-existent. Make use of these assets, and you'll find that Gliscor can prove to be a very handy teammate in just about any sandstorm team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gliscor has a few more interesting options such as Screech, Struggle Bug, Aerial Ace, and Substitute. Screech softens the opponent up so Gliscor's and its partner's Earthquakes do more damage. It also pressures the opponent to switch, which is always a risky thing to do in Doubles. Struggle Bug is perhaps a more quirky option, but it reduces the power of attacks such as Surf and Ice Beam, making Gliscor even more annoying. Aerial Ace is an option over Acrobatics if you can spare a slot, boasting 5 more points of Base Power than an unboosted Acrobatics. Gliscor can hide behind a Substitute to stall out Trick Room and rack up residual damage, but Gliscor usually can't find time to set up continuous Substitutes when it could just be firing off Tailwind and Earthquake. Facade in tandem with Toxic Orb has a whopping 140 Base Power, but Gliscor has problems fitting things into a set already, and running Earthquake and Facade as your only attacking moves leaves you powerless to Levitating Pokemon such as Bronzong and Gengar. Feint breaks enemy Protects, allowing for a surefire KO, along with being a good move to break Focus Sashes. Yache Berry can help Gliscor overcome its fear of the cold, but Gliscor finds it hard to replace Flying Gem or Toxic Orb with it. Roost can go over Protect or Tailwind when you're using Sand Veil for instant healing, though it isn't as good in practice as on paper. Gliscor can run 188 Speed EVs to outspeed Timid Rotom-A, but most Rotom-A that run Speed EVs are also equipped with Choice Scarf, so you're better off just using Tailwind or Protect against it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>If there's anything that Gliscor hates, it's rain teams. Swift Swim abusers such as Ludicolo and Kingdra can nullify Gliscor's Tailwinds before KOing it with Ice Beam; Ludicolo even resists Earthquake. In fact, anything with a strong Ice Beam or Hidden Power Ice is a threat to Gliscor due to its Ground and Flying typing. Hail teams are fine examples of teams that contain Pokemon that can obliterate Gliscor, as Abomasnow can wipe the floor with any Gliscor not carrying Rock Slide or Acrobatics. Mamoswine and Cloyster can KO Gliscor without much trouble with Icicle Spear, even if Gliscor happens to have a Substitute up. Outside of Ice-types, bulkier Water-types such as Gyarados and Suicune can give Gliscor heartburn even without Ice-type moves. Gyarados takes pitiful amounts of damage from Rock Slide thanks to Intimidate, and can proceed to KO Gliscor with one or two Waterfalls. Suicune is in a similar boat; worse still, it hits Gliscor's weaker Special Defense.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Acrobat": {
        "description": "<p>This is the more offensive version of Gliscor, taking advantage of its amazing STAB move: Acrobatics. Thanks to Flying Gem, Acrobatics skyrockets from a modest 55 Base Power to a monstrous 165 Base Power. Even after Flying Gem has been consumed, it still reaches a respectable 110 Base Power. With such a powerful attack, Gliscor is suddenly able to take on top tier threats such as Hitmontop and Abomasnow, OHKOing the former most of the time even after an Intimidate Attack drop. Tailwind can also be a great boon to your team, enabling it to outspeed threats and KO them before they can move. Earthquake is a staple on any physical Ground-type, and Protect allows Gliscor to scout an odd Hidden Power Ice or Ice Beam. The EVs allow Gliscor to hit as hard as possible while allowing it to take Dragon Claws and weaker specially based moves more easily.</p> <p>If your Gliscor has a need for speed, you can opt for a spread of 124 HP / 252 Atk / 132 Spe, which allows Gliscor to outspeed neutral base 80 Speed Pokemon. If you really want Gliscor to outspeed Pokemon such as Timid Chandelure and Jolly Mamoswine before Tailwind, you can use a spread of 12 HP / 252 Atk / 244 Spe, but it detracts from Gliscor's good defenses. If your team doesn't need Tailwind, Ice Fang can go in Tailwind's place to hit most Dragon-types harder than Acrobatics. Sand Veil can help Gliscor get a Substitute up, and can go over Protect if you're feeling lucky; if you don't, however, Hyper Cutter can be used over Sand Veil to suppress Intimidate. This is especially helpful against Salamence and Arcanine, allowing Gliscor to deal nice chunks of damage to either of them with a super effective move.</p> <p>Offensive Gliscor enjoys Tyranitar's Sand Stream to help guarantee some OHKOs and break Focus Sashes. Gliscor can help Tyranitar out as well, given its talent for KOing the Fighting-types that Tyranitar loathes. With Tailwind, Garchomp finds itself able to outspeed and OHKO Latios before the latter can respond, allowing it to spam Earthquake to its heart's content. Zapdos is able to use Heat Wave, which can prove useful against hail teams, and can also form a combination of Discharge and Earthquake with Gliscor. Terrakion and Infernape can KO Ice-types that give Gliscor shivers with their respective STAB moves. Since your opponent might try to stall out Tailwind with Protect, Choice Scarf Rotom-W can lock them into Protect with Trick, while being able to zap rain abusers with an Electric move of choice. If you really want to abuse Poison Heal with this Gliscor, you can Toxic your own Gliscor with one of your Pokemon.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Tank": {
        "description": "<p>This set capitalizes on Gliscor's brilliant tanking skills, immunity to status, and good coverage. Earthquake is any physical Ground-type's favorite move, and Rock Slide complements it by hitting Flying-types super effectively. However, you might find that Gliscor's partners have Rock Slide as well, making its Rock Slide somewhat redundant. Ice Fang is another good move that complements Earthquake, and it even 2HKOes Dragonite with one turn of sandstorm damage. Protect is a staple on any Poison Heal Gliscor, allowing it to activate its Toxic Orb and annoy the opponent in general. Tailwind is a Dream World exclusive move (in conjunction with Poison Heal, that is) that any non-Trick Room team appreciates having. However, Tailwind cannot be used with any of its Egg moves, such as Feint. The EVs make sure Gliscor outspeeds neutral base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Chandelure and unboosted Blaziken. The HP EVs make Gliscor's HP divisible by 8, which garners more Poison Heal recovery, while the leftover EVs are put into Attack.</p> <p>If you want your Gliscor to pack a little more punch, you can use an EV spread of 116 HP / 252 Atk / 140 Spe. 132 Speed EVs for Adamant Gliscor and 140 Speed EVs for a Jolly variant is probably the lowest you'd want to go since it will still let Gliscor outpaces the myriad of Pokemon that sit at the base 80 Speed tier. Tyranitar is an excellent partner; it enjoys Tailwind and can help Gliscor out with passive damage. Gliscor hates Ice-types and hail teams, so strong Rock Slide users or Pokemon such as a Tyranitar with Fire Blast or Low Kick are much appreciated. If you're running a sand team, chances are you're using several Water-weak Pokemon. Gastrodon and Thundurus can help Gliscor and the rest of your team out by discouraging the use of Water-type moves. Metagross can also help Gliscor overcome its fear of the cold with Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch, while being able to run ThunderPunch to take care of Water-types. Rotom-W can also make a great partner since it is immune to Earthquake and possesses a great STAB Electric-type move for Gliscor's Water-type phobia. Since this Gliscor isn't running Acrobatics, it would be a good idea to look into a partner such as Terrakion or Chandelure. Chandelure is weak to Gliscor's Earthquake, but can OHKO many common hail abusers with a Fire-type move. Chandelure can also be used to reverse Trick Room, meaning Gliscor's Tailwind won't be wasted.</p>"

It also can pick off faster Pokemon and deal severe damage to a multitude of common threats with its STAB Ice Shard. Mamoswine has a usable Defense stat, but its Ice typing and low Special Defense means it can't take too many hits. Mamoswine also has rather low Speed, so it's somewhat reliant upon either Tailwind, Trick Room, or Thunder Wave support. Overall, Mamoswine's excellent Attack stat and fantastic coverage make it a hugely powerful attacker if given the right support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stone Edge may seem redundant with Mamoswine's Ice-type STAB, but it 2HKOes Gyarados even after an Intimidate, unlike Icicle Crash. Endeavor is gimmicky, but can work quite well with a Focus Sash thanks to Mamoswine's immunity to sandstorm and hail, as well as its access to Ice Shard. Thick Fat is usable, but Mamoswine can't use Icicle Crash or Ice Shard with it, which greatly reduces its effectiveness.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most of the Pokemon that resist Earthquake are hit incredibly hard by Icicle Crash, which makes Mamoswine difficult to counter. However, a multitude of checks exist thanks to Mamoswine's low Speed and only reasonable defenses. Most Fighting-types such as Infernape and Hitmontop can take Mamoswine out before it attacks, but will have some trouble taking a powerful STAB Earthquake to the face.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set is intended to be a standard physical attacker, hitting as hard as possible before dying. Mamoswine's brilliant dual STAB makes it practically unwallable and hits a multitude of common Pokemon for super effective damage. Earthquake and Icicle Crash have almost perfect coverage together, with Icicle Crash OHKOing almost everything that resists Earthquake. Ice Shard allows Mamoswine to pick off weakened opponents, and can even nab some OHKOs. Protect allows Mamoswine to avoid damage for a turn, and can be used to stall out opposing Trick Room and Tailwind.</p> <p>Icicle Spear is only 8.3% less powerful on average than Icicle Crash, and breaks through Substitutes (which is especially useful against Prankster users such as Thundurus), Focus Sashes, and resist Berries, making it a viable alternative to Icicle Crash. Mamoswine can effectively use a multitude of different items as well. Ice Gem is preferred, nabbing an OHKO on 4 HP Thundurus with Ice Shard and giving Mamoswine a very powerful single-target attack which does a ton of damage to Abomasnow and other bulky Grass-types. However, Life Orb boosts all of Mamoswine's attacks, whereas Focus Sash allows Mamoswine to abuse its immunity to both hail and sandstorm to bypass its multitude of weaknesses and average defenses. The EV spread is flexible; because Mamoswine can work with such a large number of team archetypes, it can alter its Speed stat to suit whatever sort of team it's on, and rather than use 252 Speed EVs, Mamoswine can invest a bit in HP or its defenses to let it take a few more hits.</p> <p>Good partners for Mamoswine are those that allow it to get around its Speed problem, and can either boost its power or complement its STAB Earthquake while being able to take out the Pokemon that threaten Mamoswine. Fighting-type opponents can take out Mamoswine with their STAB attacks, so a Flying-type Pokemon makes an excellent partner. Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Thundurus in particular have excellent synergy with Mamoswine, thanks to their Earthquake immunities, access to either Thunder Wave or Tailwind to slow down threats to Mamoswine, and their ability to take out fast Flying-types that are immune to Mamoswine's Earthquake. Zapdos can also take out Ferrothorn with Heat Wave, a Pokemon which would otherwise easily OHKO Mamoswine with Power Whip. Aerodactyl deserves a special mention as a partner for Mamoswine, as it is immune to Earthquake, can set up Tailwind, and has Unnerve to nullify any Yache or Shuca Berries the opponent may have. If being used on a Trick Room team, good partners for Mamoswine include Musharna and Cresselia, thanks to their immunities to Earthquake, access to Trick Room, ability to boost Mamoswine's moves with Helping Hand, and access to STAB Psychic to take out Hitmontop and other Fighting-types that may threaten Mamoswine.</p>"

However, Porygon-Z provides a niche that Porygon2 cannot. This niche is Porygon-Z's high Special Attack for strong offensive capabilities. Although Porygon-Z lacks the bulk to stay around for a while, it can hit like a truck with its massive base 135 Special Attack. Because players often underestimate Porygon-Z, it is a great choice if you are looking to catch the opponent off-guard and punch holes in their team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Porygon-Z can also make use of Thunderbolt to hit Flying-types, although it misses out on super effective coverage against Zapdos and Thundurus. Another move option is Shadow Ball, which not only has similar coverage to Dark Pulse but also has a chance for a Special Defense drop. Porygon-Z can also make use of Magic Coat to prevent moves such as Spore or Thunder Wave from hitting it, although this requires some prediction and isn't always recommended. Analytic is another option and can be used with a slower Porygon-Z set with no Speed investment in order to utilize its 30% boost; however, due to its lack of bulk, Porygon-Z wants to be one of the first to attack and hit hard, so Analytic may not be the best option. Hidden Power Fire can also be of use for hitting Steel-types that ordinarily wall Porygon-Z. Choice Specs Hidden Power Fire will OHKO specially defensive Ferrothorn, which can make it quite useful. Hidden Power Water can also be used for hitting Terrakion if Porygon-Z is being used on a rain team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Porygon-Z has a few counters and many checks. Steel-types are able to counter it fairly well, such as Ferrothorn and Metagross. Other specially bulky Pokemon also do a fairly good job, as they can set up on Porygon-Z while it only does small bits of damage to them. Most of its checks are simply Pokemon that live its hits and are able to hit hard back, which aren't too uncommon in the VGC 2012 metagame.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>This set capitalizes on Porygon-Z's great Special Attack. With this moveset, Porygon-Z hits nearly everything in VGC'12 for huge damage, with only a few notable exceptions such as Ferrothorn and other Steel-types. Normal Gem- and Adaptability-boosted Hyper Beam hits even the bulkiest of foes for incredible damage. Tri Attack is another option, if Hyper Beam's recharge turn is unappealing, although Porygon-Z will then miss out on a large number of OHKOs. Dark Pulse is a great move for Porygon-Z, as it gives coverage not only on the common Psychic-types such as Cresselia, but also on the Ghost-types such as Chandelure that switch in to absorb Porygon-Z's Normal-type attack. Ice Beam hits common Flying-type Pokemon such as Thundurus and Zapdos super effectively. Protect is an important move, as it gives Porygon-Z a turn to avoid damage either from your own spread move such as Earthquake, Discharge, or Surf, or from the opposing Pokemon.</p> <p>This set uses Porygon-Z's offensive capabilities to the max. All the moves deal hefty damage to the opposition, and this can make it a dangerous playing field for your opponent. However, Porygon-Z often falls short of OHKOs, which means it can be revenge killed without much difficulty.</p> <p>Download can work on this set as well, potentially giving Porygon-Z a boost in its Special Attack, which can be crucial to the match. Although it is less reliable, it can be interesting to try out and watch how it wreaks havoc on the best of the special walls.</p> <p>Porygon-Z isn't the fastest either, so it definitely appreciates Tailwind support. Good partners for setting that up are Togekiss and Tornadus, which can beat Fighting-type Pokemon that threaten Porygon-Z as well as set up Tailwind extremely well. In addition, Pokemon with Helping Hand are very useful to Porygon-Z. Dusclops and Togekiss are both notable users of the move, among other Pokemon. Porygon-Z's bulk is also lacking, so users of Reflect and Light Screen are appreciated, most notably Cresselia.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>This set makes Porygon-Z quite threatening. Putting a Choice Scarf on it will give it the edge in Speed against many threats. With Choice Scarf bringing Porygon-Z up to a 234 Speed stat, it is guaranteed to launch a powerful Hyper Beam off at nearly any foe. Dark Pulse allows Porygon-Z to hit common Trick Room Ghost-types such as Dusclops and Chandelure. Ice Beam hits Flying-types and Dragon-types that threaten Porygon-Z, and Hidden Power Fire is for the Steel-types that the set misses out on.</p> <p>Choice Scarf makes up for Porygon-Z's slightly lacking Speed; however, being locked into one move is dangerous. Steel-types can take advantage of Porygon-Z's uselessness when it is locked into Ice Beam, and Pokemon such as Terrakion with Justified can take advantage of choice-locked Dark Pulse. Although the Speed boost is nice, it requires some good prediction and playing to be used to its full potential. Hyper Beam is necessary in order to OHKO Latios and Yache Berry Garchomp.</p> <p>Adaptability is crucial for this set, because the boost for Hyper Beam is very important. With its high power offense, a Choice Scarf gives Porygon-Z just what it needs; a reliable boost in Speed. Helping Hand support is still always welcome, because with the lack of Normal Gem Porygon-Z's Hyper Beam still falls short of KOing many Pokemon. Porygon-Z also appreciates Light Screen and Reflect; however, it is less necessary as this Porygon-Z won't be sticking around for very long. Choice Scarf Porygon-Z outspeeds even positive-natured base 130 Pokemon, which can catch opponents off-guard.</p>"

  "Froslass": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite her unique typing and impressive base 110 Speed, Froslass's poor defensive abilities and reliance on hail restrict her potential in the VGC 2012 metagame. However, she is still an excellent fit for any hail team, with the ability to spam Blizzard while outspeeding most common Pokemon, including Garchomp and Zapdos. Although Froslass's stats are rather mediocre, they allow her to take a couple of hits while still dealing a great amount of damage. When utilized correctly, she is a perfect fit for any hail team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Froslass also has access to many interesting and somewhat useful moves that can be used to catch your opponent off guard. Icy Wind is great for doing decent damage to Pokemon that are weak to it, as well as slowing down threats. Confuse Ray has an impressive 100% accuracy and can cause incredible frustration to your opponent. Ice Shard can be used to finish off Pokemon that have very little HP remaining. Other offensive moves that give Froslass coverage include Ice Beam, which enables her to attack reliably outside of hail, Psychic, and Thunderbolt. Some other interesting support moves Froslass has access to include Hail, Light Screen, Thunder Wave, and Trick.</p> <p>Froslass can also be used with a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs. Choice Scarf allows Froslass to outspeed Latios and the genies and OHKO them with Blizzard, but leaves her very vulnerable to attacks. Because Froslass already has an impressive base 110 Speed, she can also use Choice Specs to dish out massive Blizzards turn after turn; however, it also leaves her wide open to attacks. Both Choice Scarf and Choice Specs can be used in conjunction with Trick to render Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Cresselia, and Amoonguss useless. BrightPowder and Snow Cloak make it incredibly hard to even touch Froslass, but a single super effective move will take her down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Because Froslass has very mediocre defensive stats, she will often go down to any non-resisted attack in two or fewer hits. Common moves that hit for super effective damage, such as Tyranitar's Rock Slide and Crunch, Zapdos's Heat Wave, and Scizor's Bullet Punch, will easily OHKO if Froslass does not have a Focus Sash. Pokemon that are not damaged a lot by Blizzard or Shadow Ball, such as Heatran and Scizor, can easily wall Froslass and KO her. Pokemon such as Politoed, Tyranitar, and Ninetales all change the weather, tank hits from Froslass, and make it a lot more difficult to attack with Blizzard. Froslass also hates dealing with Sucker Punch, which restricts her abilities. Wide Guard completely shuts down Blizzard for one turn.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Hail Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>This set allows Froslass to work on a hail team to her full potential. With access to STAB Blizzard, Froslass is able to dish out massive damage to common Pokemon weak to Ice-type attacks, such as Garchomp, Zapdos, Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus, and Latios. Shadow Ball allows Froslass to hit Pokemon that resist Blizzard, such as Metagross, and Pokemon that are weak to Ghost-type attacks, such as Chandelure, Cresselia, and Jellicent. The third move is a toss-up between Taunt and Destiny Bond. Taunt allows Froslass to shut down defensively based Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Cresselia, but falls short if the opponent carries a Mental Herb. Destiny Bond is an interesting move that can be used in conjunction with Focus Sash, taking down massive threats in one shot. Finally, Protect is used to shield Froslass while letting her partner take down common threats.</p> <p>Froslass's EVs are straightforward but effective. With a Timid nature and maximum investment in Speed, she can outrun anything with less than 110 base Speed while Speed tying with common Pokemon such as Latios. With a Focus Sash, Froslass is able to take hits from anything and dish out at least one powerful Blizzard before going down. It also prevents Froslass from being KOed by Latios's Draco Meteor before it can retaliate with Blizzard for an OHKO. However, with Tyranitar running rampant in the VGC 2012 metagame, it can often go to waste. An Ice Gem-boosted Blizzard is incredibly strong and allows Froslass to OHKO many threats, but leaves Froslass wide open to attacks. Snow Cloak should be used over Cursed Body, Froslass's Dream World ability, to make it harder for attacks to hit Froslass under the hail. Paired with a Focus Sash, Froslass can often be frustrating to take out.</p> <p>Froslass should obviously be paired with Abomasnow to increase Blizzard's accuracy and take advantage of the hail; Blizzard's 70% accuracy is awfully unreliable and should be avoided outside of hail unless absolutely necessary. Froslass and Abomasnow can spam Blizzard repeatedly without having to worry about it missing.</p>"

  "Rotom-Heat": {
    "overview": "<p>Even though it faces stiff competition from its other forme, Rotom-W, Rotom-H is a good Pokemon in its own right. With great offensive typing and 105 Special Attack, Rotom-H can bake its opponents. It is also a very bulky Pokemon, with a base stat of 107 in both defenses being well above average. Rotom-H also has a Ground-type immunity, meaning that it can partner up with a Ground-type Pokemon and form the powerful \"DisQuake\" combo. However, this is where Rotom-H's warranty expires; even though it has only two weaknesses, they are two of the most common types in VGC 2012: Rock and Water. It also has a mediocre base 86 Speed, meaning that faster Pokemon such as Latios and Terrakion can dispose of it before it can attack. It is also very predictable, as an Electric-type attack, Overheat and a Hidden Power comprise its typical offensive movepool. However, don't underestimate the Easy Bake oven, it can roast a team easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With a decent movepool, Rotom-H has quite a few options. Will-O-Wisp can be used to weaken physical attacks, while Reflect and Light Screen can both be used to make Rotom-H's team bulkier. However, thanks to Rotom-H's great offensive typing, it should focus on attacking. Sunny Day is still an option for Rotom-H, as it can abuse the sun to make its Overheats overpowering while weakening Water-type attacks. Shadow Ball can be used to hit the Lati twins, as well as Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon, but that's about all it does. Item-wise, Rotom-H can use a Charti Berry to take attacks such as Rock Slide better, which can be useful in getting a KO on a Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Even the most durable of ovens eventually get rusty, and there is one Pokemon that can speed up this process: Gastrodon. It's immune to Rotom-H's Electric-type STAB moves, and is resistant to Overheat. It can also retaliate with a STAB Water-type attack, which will hurt even more in rain. However, Gastrodon must be wary of Hidden Power Grass. Dragon-type Pokemon, such as Latios, Latias, and Hydreigon, resist both of Rotom-H's STAB moves, and all have powerful attacks to hit Rotom-H with. However, Hidden Power Ice can keep them at bay. Tyranitar gets a Special Defense boost in sand, so it can take a Hidden Power Grass, and then it can break the oven with a Rock Slide. Terrakion outspeeds and deals massive damage with Rock Slide, and is also bulky enough to take a Hidden Power Grass, especially in sand. Lastly, Trick Room can prove problematic for Rotom-H, especially Choice Scarf variants.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<p>This is Rotom-H's bread and butter set, as it provides both bulk and power. Overheat is the main move on any Rotom-H set, as it is the reason to be using it over other Rotom formes. Thunderbolt is STAB, and it also hits very hard. However, Discharge can be used for a great STAB spread move, and works great with a Ground-type partner to form \"DisQuake\". The choice for the third moveslot depends on what Rotom-H needs to accomplish. Hidden Power Ice nails Dragon-type foes that are resistant to Rotom-H's STAB moves, such as Latios, Garchomp, and Haxorus. Hidden Power Grass hits Ground-type Pokemon that are again resistant to Rotom-H's STAB moves, such as Gastrodon and Rhyperior. Finally, Thunder Wave can be used to slow down faster Pokemon such as Infernape and Weavile. Protect is used to keep Rotom-H from taking unnecessary damage from moves such as Fake Out.</p> <p>The EVs for this set are very straightforward: maximum Special Attack provides the power for this set, while maximum HP provides bulk and survivability. However, an EV spread of 124 HP / 252 SpA / 132 Spe can be used to outspeed 252 Speed Politoed, Metagross, and Cloyster, which is crucial as Cloyster and Politoed have STAB Water-type attacks that can KO Rotom-H, and KOing Metagross before it can attack is nice as well. A Sitrus Berry gives Rotom-H more survivability, which is useful considering that it has two common weaknesses. Alternatively, an Electric Gem gives Rotom-H a single-use powerful Electric-type attack, which is very useful in getting the extra power to grab a KO.</p> <p>Rotom-H partners should be able to rid the field of Rock- and Water-type Pokemon. As such, Ground-type Pokemon work well, as their STAB attacks can get rid of Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Terrakion. Gastrodon is a perfect partner, since it can beat Rock-type Pokemon thanks to its Water / Ground typing, while drawing Water-type attacks away from Rotom-H thanks to Storm Drain. Meanwhile, Rotom-H helps out by KOing Grass-types. Torterra is another decent partner, as it can use its Grass-type STAB moves to clear Water-types and Ground-type STAB moves to clear Rock-types, while Rotom-H deals with Ice- and Flying-type Pokemon. Other great partners include Mamoswine and Garchomp; the former can put pressure on opposing Latios and Garchomp with its priority Ice Shard, while Rotom-H KOes Scizor and Metagross; the latter can get rid of Rock-type Pokemon, especially Tyranitar.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>With Rotom-H's great offensive typing, it is a wonderful Choice item user. With a Choice Scarf, Rotom-H hits 227 Speed, and 258 Special Attack with Choice Specs, meaning that Rotom-H can either outspeed or overpower its usual checks. Overheat wrecks Steel- and Grass-type Pokemon, such as Metagross, Abomasnow, and Chlorophyll users such as Jumpluff and Venusaur. With Choice Specs, Thunderbolt wrecks 252 HP Jellicent, 252 / 252 Togekiss, 4 HP Kingdra, and Politoed sans Wacan Berry. Hidden Power Ice nails Dragon-type Pokemon that would be safe from Rotom-H's STAB moves, such as Latios and Haxorus. On the other hand, Hidden Power Grass nails Gastrodon and Rhyperior, who can cause problems for Rotom-H. Finally, every Choice item user that has access to Trick should use it, as Trick deters defensive Pokemon, such as Cresselia and Musharna.</p> <p>The EVs are again straightforward: maximum Special Attack and Speed are used so Rotom-H can make the most of its Choice item. While Rotom-H is a great Choice item user, one must keep in mind that Rotom-H cannot use Protect, and therefore major support is needed. Follow Me and Rage Powder users such as Amoonguss and Lucario work great, as Amoonguss beats Rock- and Water-type Pokemon, while Lucario beats Tyranitar. Toxicroak also helps, as it beats Rock-type Pokemon as well as gaining health back when hit by a Water-type attack, and can use Fake Out to buy Rotom-H time to attack. Ninetales works as well, as a sun-boosted Overheat is very powerful; few Pokemon can take it. Gastrodon is another great partner, since it can beat Rock-type Pokemon thanks to its dual Water / Ground typing, and has Storm Drain to keep Rotom-H safe from Water-type attacks. Torterra makes a great partner as it can use its powerful Grass-type moves to deal with Water-types, and decimate Rock-types with Earthquake, while Rotom-H deals with Ice- and Flying-type Pokemon. Rotom-H appreciates teammates that can handle Dragon-type Pokemon, so Mamoswine is a solid partner.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-W's excellent typing and stats allow it to function as both an offensive and defensive threat in VGC 2012. Through its Electric / Water dual typing, and the ability Levitate, Rotom-W has merely one weakness in the form of Grass-type attacks. Its typing and ability also allow it to resist common spread moves such as Surf, Heat Wave and Blizzard while being immune to Earthquake. These many advantages make Rotom-W an excellent team player and a threat to any team not prepared for it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rotom gets Will-O-Wisp, which allows it to cripple physical attackers, especially those who utilize Rock Slide and Earthquake. Signal Beam allows it to hit Psychic-, Grass- and Dark-type Pokemon super effectively such as Latios, Hydreigon and Whimsicott. Thunder is a viable alternative to Discharge or Thunderbolt, but only if you are running a rain team. Water and Electric Gems can also be used as the boost to Rotom-W's STAB move gives them immense power. An alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 160 SpA / 96 SpD allows Rotom-W to survive at least two Dragon Pulses from Kingdra and two Thunderbolts from Timid Zapdos, which is particularly useful if Rotom-W is needed to combat rain teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Abomasnow resists both of Rotom-W's STAB moves and can either hit it super effectively with its STAB Giga Drain or Grass Knot, or stall it out with Leech Seed and hail, fearing only Hidden Power Fire. Latios, Latias, and Hydreigon also resist both of its STAB moves while doing major damage with their Dragon-type STAB moves. Amoonguss resists both of Rotom-W's STAB attacks and does not really fear a super effective Hidden Power. It can easily draw away Rotom-W's attacks with Rage Powder or retaliate with a super effective Giga Drain. Gastrodon is immune to both of Rotom-W's STAB attacks, but can only hurt it back in return through Toxic. Latios resists both of Rotom-W's STAB attacks, is faster, and can quickly dispatch Rotom-W with Draco Meteor, but must be wary of Thunder Wave. Ludicolo can withstand a Thunderbolt, outspeeds Rotom-W in the rain, and hits it very hard with its STAB Grass-type attacks. However, like Latios, Ludicolo must be wary of Thunder Wave, as paralysis cripples it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Rotom-W's incredible power and bulk, also allowing it to act as a supporter with Thunder Wave. Thunderbolt and Hydro Pump are Rotom-W's primary STAB attacks, doing solid damage to opponents which do not resist them. However, you may opt to use Discharge over Thunderbolt, as it hits both opponents and has a higher chance to inflict paralysis upon the foe. Be aware, however, that Discharge will also hit your teammate, and it is thus recommended that Rotom-W's teammate is either immune to Discharge, or packs Protect. Thunder Wave allows Rotom-W to instantly paralyze anything that is not immune to it, enabling it and its teammate to outspeed their opponents without any EV investment. Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Ice are also options for the third moveslot; the former gives it a way of dealing with Abomasnow and Ferrothorn who otherwise both wall this set, while the latter hits the omnipresent Dragon-type enemies super effectively. Protect is a staple in the VGC metagame and allows Rotom-W to avoid taking damage while its teammate takes out the threat.</p> <p>A Modest nature and 252 Special Attack EVs allow Rotom-W to hit its enemies as hard as possible, while 252 HP EVs maximize Rotom-W's bulk, increasing its longevity on the field. Investment in Speed is unnecessary for Rotom-W as it will outspeed nothing significant, and is thus better off maximizing its bulk. Rotom-W has excellent synergy with Ground-type Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Garchomp, taking advantage of their immunity to Electric-type attacks to spam Discharge while allowing them to do the same with Earthquake, thanks to Levitate. Mamoswine also eliminates the Grass- and Dragon-types which wall Rotom-W with its powerful STAB Ice-type attacks, making a particularly good partner.</p>"

      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Rotom-W is the most straightforward way to use Rotom-W, as it simply aims to either outspeed or overwhelm the opponent with its powerful STAB moves. The choice of item (no pun intended) is mostly speed versus power. When equipped with a Choice Scarf, Rotom-W's wash cycles shoot up from 151 to 227 RPM, allowing Rotom-W to wash away tough stains such as weakened Dragon-types and Terrakion, not to mention those tough Focus Sash users that are a real pain to get out of your blue jeans. On the other hand, when equipped with Choice Specs, Rotom-W gains the power to wring out the annoying 252 HP Tyranitar, freeing your undergarments from that awful chafing Sand Stream 70% of the time, assuming Rotom-W has a Modest nature and sandstorm is in effect. If that weren't enough, a Modest Rotom-W's Thunderbolt absolutely electrifies 252 HP Jellicent, max SpD Togekiss, 4 HP Kingdra, and any Politoed foolish enough to even step out of the swamp without a Wacan Berry. Hidden Power and Trick are mostly fillers, though that doesn't necessarily mean they aren't useful. Trick may be a quirky move to use in VGC, but it discourages Protect, cripples Pokemon that can't use Rotom's item, and scouts what set (or at least what item) the opponent has elected to use. Hidden Power Ice is useful for the ever-present Dragon-types, though Hidden Power Fire is usable if you feel your team is too vulnerable to Ferrothorn, Abomasnow, or hail in general.</p> <p>On its own, Choice Rotom-W will often find itself in a messy situation. As it is unable to use Protect, Follow Me users, such as Togekiss, make excellent teammates to redirect any Grass-type moves aimed at Rotom-W. Fake Out users can also buy Rotom a little time to shuffle items or clean the opponent's clock with its mighty Hydro Pump. Toxicroak is a good teammate in this regard, as it not only takes very little damage from Grass-types, but also knocks in heads with Poison Jab or Ice Punch. If you're feeling gutsy, you can even elect to target Toxicroak with Rotom-W's Hydro Pump to restore its HP. Politoed's everlasting rain and Rotom-W's Hydro Pump is a match seemingly made in the heavens, and while it's raining, you can elect to use Thunder to secure OHKOs, but wait, there's more! Thunder even comes with the added bonus of a 30% chance of paralysis, and you won't have to worry about the rare-but-annoying Moody Smeargle or Minimize users quite as much. Lastly, Garchomp, Metagross, and general Earthquake users like having Rotom around so they can spam Earthquake to their hearts' content while Rotom smites anything that is immune.</p>"

It should be considered on any hail team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs can be a very good alternative Choice item. A Choice Specs-boosted move can deal serious damage to just about everything; however, Choice Specs Rotom-F might be too slow to be very effective. Other good items are resist berries. A Chople or an Occa Berry makes Rotom-F harder to take down with Fighting- or Fire-type attacks, respectively, and can allow it to get an extra hit off. A dual screens set is possible, and it can be effective in VGC if you are able to get both screens up in time. Discharge could replace Thunderbolt if paired with a Ground-type, such as Garchomp.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Rotom-F unfortunately has multiple weaknesses to popular VGC Pokemon. STAB Flamethrower or Heat Wave from the likes of Chandelure and Volcarona, as well as Blaziken's Flare Blitz, can OHKO Rotom-F with ease. Both Rock Slide and Close Combat from Terrakion will OHKO it, and Mach Punch from Hitmontop, Breloom, or Conkeldurr will 2HKO it. A Scizor's Bullet Punch, however, only 3HKOes Rotom-F.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Rotom-F may not immediately stand out as an excellent sweeper, but with a decent base 105 Special Attack and enough Defense to take a Bullet Punch, it has great potential in the VGC 2012 metagame. Blizzard is Rotom-F's best STAB attack, as it hits both of the opposing Pokemon. It also does a huge amount of damage to Pokemon that don't resist it, especially when boosted by an Ice Gem. Thunderbolt is another powerful STAB move that can seriously hurt threats such as Kingdra and Politoed and possibly leave a Pokemon paralyzed. The third moveslot has two good options. Hidden Power Fire is useful for taking out popular Bug- and Grass-type Pokemon, such as Scizor and Abomasnow, while Thunder Wave allows Rotom-F to paralyze anything that is not immune to Electric-type moves, enabling it and its teammate to outspeed their opponents. A Choice set should obviously go for Hidden Power Fire, but a non-Choice user should decide between Hidden Power Fire and Thunder Wave based on personal preference. Protect is a staple VGC move; it allows Rotom-F's partner to take out threats to Rotom-F while protecting Rotom-F from damage, and it lets Rotom-F scout out potential moves its opponents could have. If Rotom-F is using a Choice item, however, you should use Trick instead. Tricking a Choice Scarf to a Trick Room starter or a support Pokemon, such as Cresselia, will probably force a switch and render them useless for the rest of the battle.</p> <p>An Ice Gem is the best option, as it would increase the power of Blizzard, allowing Rotom-F to sweep Pokemon from the beginning of the match, while maintaining its ability to switch moves. However, a Choice Scarf is a viable option as well. With base 86 Speed, Choice Scarf Rotom-F can be an excellent revenge killer, as it outruns Pokemon such as Tornadus and Thundurus. Rotom-F should be paired with an Abomasnow, as hail ensures a 100% accurate Blizzard while dealing residual damage. Rotom-F also works well with Tailwind inducers such as Tornadus. With Tailwind support, Rotom-F easily outspeeds all opposing Pokemon. A great offensive partner would be Garchomp, as it can Earthquake opposing Steel-types without damaging Rotom-F due to Levitate, and it also resists Fire-type attacks, particularly Heat Wave, which Rotom-F is weak to.</p>"

With an average base HP and superb defenses, Uxie is rather bulky and can tank a couple of hits before going down.

Mental Herb can be considered if you are afraid of Uxie being Taunted, while Lum Berry prevents Uxie from being afflicted with a status condition.</p> <p>Uxie has access to several other support moves, such as Reflect, Light Screen, Magic Coat, Thunder Wave, Rain Dance, and Sunny Day. Reflect and Light Screen assist the rest of your team, but the bulkier Cresselia completely outclasses Uxie in setting them up. Magic Coat can turn your opponents' moves against them, bouncing back support moves such as Taunt and Spore. Thunder Wave can cripple faster threats and allow slower sweepers to come in and take them out. Rain Dance and Sunny Day can even be used to surprise your opponent and set up weather to assist your team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Although Uxie is relatively bulky, it will still fall to super effective attacks. Tyranitar easily takes care of Uxie, as it is immune to Psychic and KOes Uxie with a powerful STAB Crunch. Scizor can steal Uxie's Sitrus Berry with Bug Bite and resists Psychic. Chandelure can use Imprison before Uxie can, then quickly take it down with Shadow Ball. Dark-type Pokemon in general give Uxie trouble, as they are immune to Psychic and can retaliate with a super effective STAB attack. Any Pokemon carrying Taunt can also severely limit Uxie's abilities.</p>",

Additionally, Imprison prevents your opponents from using Protect, which is found on nearly every Pokemon in the metagame. Although Trick Room is mainly on the set for Imprison, it can also be used when facing faster Pokemon such as Garchomp and Zapdos. Psychic is Uxie's strongest STAB attack, which hits common Pokemon, such as Hitmontop and Toxicroak, for super effective damage. Helping Hand can be used instead to support Uxie's partner, but as Taunt will easily shut down Uxie if it does not run Psychic, this is not recommended.

For example, Garchomp has great synergy with Uxie, as it can dish out fast Earthquakes that will not affect Uxie. Tyranitar is a great partner as well, as Uxie has Psychic to take care of the Fighting-types that trouble it. Uxie can even set up Trick Room to patch up Tyranitar's low Speed. Metagross also works well with Uxie, taking advantage of Trick Room with its low Speed.</p>"

  "Azelf": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Azelf is blessed with superb offensive stats and speed, its weak defensive stats do not allow it to survive very long. However, it can still pack a punch with its wide variety of moves. Its base 115 Speed allows it to naturally outspeed common Pokemon, such as Tornadus, Thundurus, Terrakion, Garchomp, and Zapdos, and do massive damage. When supported correctly, Azelf can easily destroy many unprepared teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Azelf also has access to several moves you might want to consider. For example, it learns several support moves, such as Taunt, Imprison, Sunny Day, Light Screen, Reflect, Safeguard, Thunder Wave, Helping Hand, and Trick. Azelf is able to take advantage of its Speed and surprise your opponent with a support move rather than an attack. Taunt shuts down Trick Room, Protect, Thunder Wave, and other support moves. Azelf is the fastest user of Imprison and can shut down specific moves such as Protect and Trick Room. If Imprison is used, Protect is necessary over Detect, as Protect is more common. Sunny Day can catch other weather-based teams off guard. Light Screen and Reflect can be used to protect the rest of your team from strong attacks. Thunder Wave can paralyze Pokemon before they are able to get an attack off. Trick can be used with a Choice Scarf or a Choice Band to shut down common bulky Pokemon, such as Cresselia. Helping Hand, when partnered with a strong offensive partner such as Latios, can turn moves that otherwise do not KO into OHKOs. However, there are several other Pokemon, such as Whimsicott and Thundurus, that have access to similar moves and the Prankster ability, which gives support moves priority. Nevertheless, Azelf can catch opponents off guard with specific support moves that assist the rest of your team. Azelf might also want to consider a Choice Band variant that uses the moves Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, and Fire Punch for incredible coverage. However, Choice Band limits Azelf to only one move. Azelf cannot do enough damage without a Choice Band to KO common threats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Azelf is relatively frail and has a lot of problems dealing with super effective hits. For example, Tyranitar can OHKO Azelf with Crunch as Azelf cannot first OHKO Tyranitar. Hitmontop has access to Sucker Punch to OHKO Azelf before it is able to attack. Hitmontop also learns Wide Guard, which can prevent Azelf from using Explosion and causes you to lose one of your Pokemon without damaging your opponent's. Choice Scarf Ghost-type Pokemon, such as Chandelure, can also give Azelf trouble, as they can KO it with Shadow Ball. Occa Berry Metagross can also KO Azelf with a combination of Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch, while Azelf can only do a small amount of damage with Fire Blast. Latios and Latias can completely wall Azelf that do not run Shadow Ball, and can easily KO it with Draco Meteor. As Azelf is not a very bulky Pokemon, it often only survives for a turn or two before going down.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set utilizes Azelf's physical offenses as well as possible. Zen Headbutt is used to hit common Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Hitmontop and Toxicroak. Ice Punch allows Azelf to hit Dragon- and Flying-types, such as Latios, Tornadus, Thundurus, Garchomp, Zapdos, and Hydreigon. Explosion is an incredible move that, when used correctly, can often take out both of your opponent's Pokemon. Unlike most Explosion users, which are often slow and use it as a last attempt to do damage, or have to use a Choice Scarf, Azelf outspeeds most Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame and can use a Normal Gem to do massive damage. An unexpected Explosion early on in the match can often result in your opponent losing both of their leads. However, for those that do not like giving up one of their Pokemon in return for massive damage, U-turn can be used to let Azelf escape from Pokemon that give it trouble, while hitting Pokemon such as Latios, Cresselia, Ludicolo, and Tyranitar for super effective damage. Detect is necessary to protect Azelf from attacks as it is so frail.</p> <p>Azelf has several teammates that it works well with. For example, it partners well with Ghost-types, such as Chandelure and Jellicent, that are immune to its Explosion. This allows for Azelf to use Explosion while letting its teammate get an attack off rather than using Protect. Metagross is also an excellent partner, as it is able to take out Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Weavile, Latios, and Hitmontop, which give Azelf trouble.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set focuses on Azelf's Special Attack, and packs moves that allow Azelf to hit a variety of different Pokemon. Either Psychic or Psyshock can work as Azelf's STAB attack. Both are powerful moves that hit several Pokemon for large amounts of damage, and OHKO Fighting-type Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Toxicroak. Fire Blast is used to hit Abomasnow, Scizor, and Ferrothorn, and will always OHKO them unless they are holding Focus Sash or Occa Berry. Grass Knot can be used to eliminate Water-type Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Swampert, and also dents Tyranitar. However, Shadow Ball can also be considered in order to hit Ghost-types, particularly Chandelure. As above, Detect is an important move in the doubles metagame; even more for Azelf considering its frailty.</p> <p>As with the physically based variant, one of Azelf's niches is that it is able to outspeed most Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame, and do massive amounts of damage as well. Therefore, Azelf should use a Timid nature and max Special Attack and Speed EVs to do as much damage as possible while retaining its excellent speed. Life Orb can be used if you want the extra damage. Because Azelf is so frail, the 10% recoil won't matter much as Azelf will easily go down to any attack. However, a Focus Sash may be considered to allow Azelf to survive a super effective hit, such as Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Infernape and Garchomp are excellent partners that give incredible coverage. Infernape is able to hit Tyranitar, which otherwise gives Azelf a lot of trouble. Garchomp also has great synergy with Azelf thanks to Azelf's ability, Levitate, which allows Garchomp to spam Earthquakes without damaging Azelf. Both Infernape and Garchomp are speedy Pokemon, and when paired with Azelf, can KO threats before they are even able to respond and strike back.</p> <p>For those that do not like Fire Blast's risky accuracy, Flamethrower can also be used, as it still OHKOes Abomasnow and Scizor while retaining accuracy. Thunderbolt enables Azelf to hit Water- and Flying-type Pokemon, such as Politoed and Gyarados, for large amounts of damage. Colbur Berry can be used to protect Azelf from powerful Dark-type moves, such as Hitmontop's Sucker Punch or Tyranitar's Crunch. A Modest nature can considered for maximum damage, but is recommended only if Azelf has Tailwind support.</p>"

However, behind the facade of a harmless giant is a monster with massive defenses and excellent supportive options. Sporting excellent 110 / 110 / 110 defensive base stats that rival even Cresselia's, and access to moves such as Thunder Wave, Wide Guard, and Icy Wind, Regigigas is excellent at performing a supportive role on a team. Consider this colossus dead weight at your own peril.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Regigigas has a number of other support options to choose from. Swagger and Confuse Ray allow it to cause further disruption to the opposing Pokemon, while Safeguard can be used to prevent the opponent's Pokemon from fighting back with status moves of their own. Substitute can act as a... substitute for Protect. Gravity can allow for some interesting options, letting Regigigas's ally use low accuracy attacks without worry. Weather moves, such as Rain Dance or Sunny Day, can be used to provide Regigigas with manual weather control. Regigigas can use Knock Off to remove an opponent's item. This can be useful in disarming type-resist Berries, Life Orb, or Leftovers. In addition to support moves, Regigigas has a large number of physical attacks to choose from, such as Earthquake, the elemental punches, and Superpower; however, due to Slow Start, it's not worth trying to use them. Finally, even though it's a gimmick, one can use Simple Beam, Worry Seed, or Mummy to try to get rid of Slow Start, as this will allow Regigigas to take on an offensive role.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fighting-type Pokemon can easily crush Regigigas by slamming it with powerful Close Combats, however it can often survive a Fighting-type move if it is holding a Chople Berry. Taunt can help against Regigigas by disabling Thunder Wave and Wide Guard, but it can still slow down its opponents with Icy Wind. Ultimately, the easiest way to handle Regigigas is to attack it with strong STAB attacks, such as Meteor Mash or Draco Meteor, as one can be certain that it will not use Protect, nor can it heal itself. Keep in mind that Regigigas's role doesn't change too much even if the duration of Slow Start somehow expires. You shouldn't ignore it, but don't think that it's the end of the world if five turns have passed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Supporter": {
        "description": "<p>Regigigas's access to Wide Guard provides it with a niche over its fellow support Pokemon, Cresselia, allowing it to block spread moves that are very common in the VGC metagame. Aside from Wide Guard, Regigigas has both Thunder Wave and Icy Wind. Both moves aid in slowing down the opponent's Pokemon, providing a speed advantage to Regigigas's partner. For its final move, Regigigas can run either Rock Slide or Return. Rock Slide doesn't do much damage, but can buy time by potentially flinching targets after they have been paralyzed with Thunder Wave. Return, on the other hand, allows Regigigas to deal a bit of damage to opposing Pokemon, and becomes quite respectable as an offensive option should Slow Start be lifted in five turns.</p> <p>The EVs focus on maximizing Regigigas's special bulk. This allows Regigigas to take on powerful special attacks, such as rain-boosted Hydro Pump or Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor, with HP to spare. Sitrus Berry and Chople Berry further improve Regigigas's survivability by providing some HP recovery and allowing Regigigas to take Fighting-type moves, respectively. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD, with an Impish nature, can be used to focus on physical defense; the EV spread nearly guarantees that Regigigas can survive a Fighting Gem-boosted Close Combat from Hitmontop without the use of a Chople Berry. Naturally, defensive EV spreads in between the two extremes can work as well; what works best will depend on the needs of your team.</p> <p>Regigigas's only weakness is to Fighting-type attacks, so Pokemon such as Metagross, Latios, and Togekiss, which can handle Fighting-type Pokemon well, make decent partners. When it's not being threatened by Fighting-type Pokemon, a partner that can take advantage of Regigigas's support moves is preferred. For example, Pokemon such as Metagross, Zapdos, Chandelure, and Abomasnow, which are vulnerable to a number of spread moves and aren't particularly fast, can take full advantage of the support options that Regigigas has to offer.</p>"

  "Musharna": {
    "overview": "<p>With an ability perfectly suited for the VGC metagame, overall decent stats, and a very useful support movepool, one may question why Musharna is not used in nearly all VGC teams. The answer is simple: when looking for a dedicated team supporter, Cresselia is usually preferred due to its better bulk and arguably better ability. This should not lead one to think Cresselia is superior to Musharna, however. Musharna's ability, Telepathy, enables it to fearlessly boost all its partner's spread attacks, a feat that Cresselia finds difficult to accomplish. Unlike Cresselia, Musharna also maintains the ability to remain a threat even after being Taunted, courtesy of its base 107 Special Attack stat. Furthermore, Musharna's ability to stop Trick Room teams with Imprison, a move Cresselia lacks, makes it a good candidate for a Trick Room or anti-Trick Room team. Couple this with its base 29 Speed stat and you will find Musharna to be the perfect weapon for and against Trick Room teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Musharna has a slew of options that it can run, but it often has trouble finding a spare moveslot. Musharna can dual screens or Thunder Wave support but Cresselia is often preferred thanks to greater bulk and Levitate. Psyshock and Shadow Ball are other moves that Musharna can utilize if it wants to damage Taunt users. Musharna can utilize Telekinesis in conjunction with a partner that uses low accuracy moves, but more often than not the opponent will find himself getting a free turn instead of being KOed. Lucky Chant prevents critical hits, but they are too rare to make this tactic anything more than a gimmick. Musharna can use Safeguard and Magic Coat to bounce back status effects, but it is generally very difficult to find a spot for these two moves on a set. A Calm nature is preferred if Musharna is used in an anti-Trick Room team to help outspeed opposing Trick Room foes. Musharna utilizes Hypnosis well due to its defensive stats and Telepathy. However, Hypnosis's accuracy is too unreliable and Amoonguss is a better choice for sleep support. Lastly, Musharna receives Moonlight and can use it as a form of recovery, but not only is it too unreliable to use, it is also less useful due to the faster pace of the doubles metagame.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Whimsicott is arguably your best bet for preventing Musharna from using Trick Room: it packs priority Taunt and Encore to prevent Musharna without Mental Herb from setting up Trick Room, while Encore forces ones that do to restore the dimensions to their original state the subsequent turn, after Mental Herb has been broken by Taunt. Imprison Chandelure is also a handy annoyance; it is capable of stopping all Musharna's attempts to set up Trick Room through Imprison, and can quickly dispose of Musharna with STAB Shadow Balls. Tyranitar and Politoed are also annoyances as their abilities reduce the effectiveness of Musharna's only reliable recovery move, Moonlight; worse still, they can smack the dreamer with a powerful STAB move. Although Musharna's bulk is by no means shabby, it can be disposed of with multiple STAB attacks, and its lack of reliable recovery will prevent Musharna from recovering damage it takes.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>With the item Mental Herb getting a buff, Trick Room teams are even harder to counter than they were last generation, and are nearly impossible to stop from setting up, which can be problematic for teams packing speedy and frail Pokemon. Musharna, along with a few select other Pokemon, gained the ability to completely shut down these devastating foes by using Imprison in conjunction with Trick Room. Musharna shines as the one of the only two users of this combination to also possess the ability Telepathy, and among those two, the one with much higher bulk.</p> <p>Trick Room is the crux of the set, enabling Musharna to distort dimensions to suit its teammates. Psychic provides a reliable and powerful STAB, prevents Musharna from being helpless in the face of Taunt, and softens foes up for a teammate's attack. It is one of the only ways Musharna can get past Whimsicott without excessive team support, and enables it to dent Amoonguss, who otherwise has no trouble putting your team to sleep via Spore. Helping Hand works wonderfully with Telepathy, as it allows Musharna to boost the power of its partner's attacking move, such as Earthquake or Surf without fear of taking damage. The last slot can be difficult to decide on. Protect is a staple move in doubles, scouting and stacking passive damage against the opponent, while protecting Musharna from harm. Imprison enables Musharna to easily stop opposing Trick Room teams and prevents any enemy support Pokemon from using Helping Hand. Lastly, Musharna can use Light Screen to assist its partners and itself by easing the damage from all special attacks, rain-boosted Surfs and sun-boosted Heat Waves in particular. Protect may be used in conjunction with Imprison to cause massive disruption to the opponent and to stall Trick Room turns, but it generally is not recommended as Musharna already has enough trouble deciding which four moves to use.</p> <p>Although Musharna may appear to need all the recovery it can get, one should not forget that it dislikes being Taunted, as it prevents this from setting up Trick Room. Mental Herb enables it to avoid this catastrophic scenario as well as beat Whimsicott. It is recommended that you only use Sitrus Berry if you are using Musharna with Fake Out or Follow Me support, so that it will not be Taunted or Encored into Trick Room.</p> <p>When using Musharna for support, one must make sure to differentiate it from other Trick Room supporters. Cresselia's defensive stats outshine Musharna's, and its ability, Levitate, enables it to avoid not only its partners Earthquakes, but enemy Ground-type moves as well. For instance, if Musharna is only being used to power up Earthquakes, Cresselia would probably be the superior choice. When using Musharna in an anti-Trick Room team, one must ensure that it is not outclassed by Gardevoir as a supporter who boasts greater Speed and access to Heal Pulse. Musharna's advantage, however, is its significantly better bulk.</p> <p>Musharna dislikes having to take multiple STAB Surfs or Heat Waves; therefore, Fake Out support is much appreciated. Hariyama is an excellent option, as it can flinch one of the enemies as Musharna uses Trick Room, giving your team an immediate advantage by letting Hariyama spam massively powerful STAB Guts-boosted Close Combats. Musharna's ability to power up its allies' moves with Helping Hand makes it a fine teammate for Politoed and Ninetales, since it can power up their Surfs and Heat Waves without fearing friendly fire.</p>"

  "Zebstrika": {
    "overview": "<p>Zebstrika has an impressive base 116 Speed, but its other stats fall a bit short, and it has a shallow movepool. One thing Zebstrika can do well, nonetheless, is make use of Lightning Rod. By having a partner use Discharge to boost Zebstrika's Special Attack—while also dealing damage to the opposition—Zebstrika can quickly become a destructive force, despite its low base Special Attack. Lightning Rod's added benefit of stopping Thunder Wave means that it isn't easy to slow this zebra down once it hits its stride.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As stated earlier, Zebstrika's movepool is quite limited. Discharge provides Zebstrika with a spread move, but it will damage and possibly even paralyze Zebstrika's own ally, so it can be tricky to use. Thunder can be useful if Zebstrika is used on a rain team. Access to Me First grants Zebstrika a few interesting options, such as a boosted Draco Meteor against Latios, but it is a bit too situational. Thunder Wave and Light Screen provide Zebstrika with a few options as a support Pokemon, allowing it to do something even if it doesn't manage to get any Lightning Rod boosts.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Although Zebstrika is rather frail, it typically has enough durability to take one neutral attack; to illustrate, it takes roughly a neutral 120 Base Power STAB move to OHKO Zebstrika. Choice Scarf Garchomp can easily handle Zebstrika, as it can switch in on Thunderbolt or Overheat, outspeed, and KO with Earthquake. Gastrodon, Lanturn, and Seaking can wall Zebstrika fairly easily if Zebstrika does not run Hidden Power Grass. Latias and Latios can take a +1 Hidden Power Ice and KO back with Draco Meteor, but they will run into trouble if Zebstrika has gained more than one Special Attack boost. Dark Gem or Life Orb Bisharp can OHKO Zebstrika with Sucker Punch, but will have trouble switching in safely. Lastly, Trick Room kills any hopes that Zebstrika has of attempting a sweep, as its high Speed will hinder it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lightning Rod": {
        "description": "<p>Thunderbolt is Zebstrika's main offensive move. After one Lightning Rod boost, Zebstrika's Thunderbolt hits a bit harder than that of Zapdos. Overheat provides Zebstrika with coverage on Grass-type Pokemon, namely Amoonguss; a boosted Overheat will OHKO all but the most specially defensive of Amoonguss. Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Grass moves that provide for extra coverage. The former enables Zebstrika to take on Dragon-type Pokemon such as Latios and Garchomp, while the latter grants Zebstrika a harder hit on Ground- and Water-type Pokemon immune to Electric-type moves, such as Gastrodon, Rhyperior, and Seaking. Finally, Protect allows Zebstrika to block incoming attacks, and is a staple move in the VGC metagame. This is particularly useful on Zebstrika as the opponents will be pressured to take it out after it manages to get a few Special Attack boosts.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Zebstrika's Speed and Special Attack, while a Life Orb improves Zebstrika's damage output. A Focus Sash can be used instead to guarantee that Zebstrika survives an attack.</p> <p>Zebstrika isn't much of a threat without a partner to boost it with Discharge. Unfortunately, Zebstrika's Speed works against it a bit here as it needs a faster partner to power it up before it attacks, thus limiting the number of Pokemon that are compatible with Zebstrika. Jolteon and Electrode are two Electric-types that are naturally speedier than Zebstrika. Raikou can also work if Zebstrika limits itself to 236 Speed EVs. Lastly, Thundurus can work as a partner if Zebstrika runs 204 Speed EVs, but this will cause Zebstrika to Speed tie with Latios, so it isn't recommended. More options are open for the Discharge partner if it can run a Choice Scarf. A Choice Scarf would allow Rotom-A, Thundurus, and Zapdos to move before Zebstrika and boost it with Discharge.</p> <p>While Zebstrika must be paired with a Discharge user to pose an offensive threat, it can still provide great support with Lightning Rod. Water-type Pokemon such as Politoed and Gyarados, who don't take too kindly to Electric-type moves, greatly appreciate Lightning Rod taking away the threat of a super effective attack. In addition to this, as Lightning Rod absorbs Thunder Wave, Zebstrika's presence assures that faster Pokemon such as Latios and Terrakion, as well as Choice Scarf users, such as Abomasnow, Chandelure, and Rotom-A, can maintain their Speed over the opponents. Keep in mind, though, that Lightning Rod will redirect an ally's Electric-type moves. Therefore, while the opponent can't use Thunder Wave against your team, Zebstrika's partner will not be able to use any Electric-type move either, except for Discharge.</p>"

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Excadrill is a powerful Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame due to its good typing and base 135 Attack stat. It has a respectable base 88 Speed stat that can be boosted greatly by one of Excadrill's abilities, Sand Rush, which doubles Excadrill's Speed in sandstorm. Excadrill's other ability, Sand Force, increases the power of its Rock-, Ground-, and Steel-type attacks by 30% when sandstorm is in effect. However, this is less useful due to Excadrill's relatively weak defenses; it rarely survives an assault from the opposing Pokemon to strike back with a Sand Force-boosted attack. Excadrill's true strength comes from its ability to fire off powerful STAB Earthquakes at Speeds higher than any unboosted Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As stated before, Excadrill's movepool is rather small, but it does have a few options outside of the ones listed. Although Excadrill learns both Swords Dance and Hone Claws, set-up moves are difficult to get off safely due to the fast-paced nature of double battles. If Excadrill can nab a Swords Dance boost, however, it becomes quite difficult to stop. Drill Run is an option over Earthquake, but Earthquake's ability to hit both opponents makes it more attractive in most situations. Bulldoze is another possibility, but unless Excadrill's teammates will benefit greatly from the potential Speed drop, it is not worth it. Brick Break and Aerial Ace are viable options, although their uses depend largely on Excadrill's teammates and what type coverage is necessary. It is possible to use Sand Force instead of Sand Rush and try to set up Trick Room to allow Excadrill to move before its foes, but this is a lot of work as neither Tyranitar nor Hippowdon learn Trick Room, and thus this strategy would consume 3 of your teamslots. The greater problem with this, however, is that Rhyperior and other naturally slow Pokemon are generally much better at this job than Excadrill. As for items, both Ground Gem and Focus Sash are reasonable choices for Excadrill, with the former giving Excadrill's first Earthquake an extra boost in power, and the latter making up for Excadrill's weak defenses. Both Occa and Shuca Berry are options as well, helping Excadrill handle certain Pokemon more easily. Mold Breaker can be a solid option for a Pokemon like Excadrill, who have Earthquake as a STAB boosted move. Allowing it to hit anything that would normally avoid Earthquake with the ability Levitate. Even though Sand Rush and Sand Force may seem to outclass it, Mold Breaker can be used with Excadrill on a team that doesn't feature sand.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake and pack strong, super effective attacks against Excadrill are the best counters to it. Good examples include Zapdos, Gyarados, Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Hitmontop—the latter is not immune to Earthquake but often carries Intimidate to lower Excadrill's Attack. Garchomp makes a great check to Excadrill as it can KO the latter with STAB Earthquake, but it has to be wary of Excadrill's own Earthquake, which can 2HKO most variants of Garchomp. The same can be said for Terrakion; it can OHKO Excadrill with Close Combat, but must be wary of being outsped—even with Choice Scarf—and OHKOed by Earthquake.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Earthquake is Excadrill's most powerful attack, receiving a STAB boost and hitting every Pokemon on the field (including its teammate). Unfortunately, Excadrill's movepool is somewhat lacking, so the third move can be any number of mediocre choices. X-Scissor hits popular Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, and Cresselia hard, making it the most desirable option. Finally, Substitute is a viable option over Protect because of Excadrill's high Speed in sandstorm, protecting it from status moves, such as Spore and Will-O-Wisp. The EVs listed allow Excadrill to outpace max Speed Choice Scarf Terrakion in sandstorm.</p> <p>Excadrill works best with a teammate that can set up sandstorm easily, which means Tyranitar or Hippowdon due to their Sand Stream ability. A Tyranitar that is paired with Excadrill should carry Air Balloon, allowing it to avoid Excadrill's Earthquake until it is hit by another attack. Other good teammates are Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake, such as Flying-type Pokemon and Pokemon with Levitate. Excadrill often has difficulty with opposing Flying-types such as Zapdos, which is not OHKOed by any of Excadrill's attacks and can do heavy damage to Excadrill with Heat Wave, so Pokemon that fare well against Zapdos, such as Latios, work well with Excadrill. Conveniently, Latios also has Levitate, enabling it to evade Excadrill's Earthquake. Fighting-type Pokemon are often huge threats to Excadrill, as the latter cannot OHKO many of them and is hit super effectively by their STAB Fighting-type attacks. As such, Flying-type Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Gyarados and Salamence, are particularly good teammates for Excadrill. Cresselia is another Pokemon that is immune to Earthquake, and it can decimate Fighting-type Pokemon with STAB Psychic. Another useful teammate for Excadrill is Thundurus, as it can deal with threats such as Gyarados and Zapdos easily, and can also use Thunder Wave to slow down other Pokemon so that Excadrill can outspeed them should sandstorm be absent.</p>"

  "Conkeldurr": {
    "overview": "<p>Conkeldurr draws many comparisons to its fatter cousin Hariyama. Both are bulky, slow Fighting-types with access to Guts and priority, and both make excellent attackers. Conkeldurr's main draws over Hariyama are STAB Mach Punch and a bone-shattering Base 140 Attack stat. Conkeldurr does have problems against common Psychic-types however, and is very easy to wear down through recoil damage. Due to its low base Speed, Conkeldurr functions best on a Trick Room team, where its teammates can more effectively deal with fast Psychic-types such as Latios that can make life difficult for Conkeldurr. It can be difficult to use, but Conkeldurr's raw power will often make up for the effort needed to utilize it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Conkeldurr can use an Iron Ball and Fling to deal tremendous damage to Psychic- and Ghost-types, but this is often an impractical choice as Guts is one of Conkeldurr's biggest draws. Conkeldurr has considerable physical bulk, so Counter can be used to get the upper hand against physical attackers. Coba Berry is a gimmicky option alongside Counter, as with it Conkeldurr can survive an Acrobatics and KO back in retaliation. Brick Break isn't any stronger than Drain Punch, but its ability to remove the effects of Reflect and Light Screen can be very useful in certain situations. Earthquake is also a possible coverage move, but Rock Slide is generally superior in terms of the targets that it hits, and does not have the unwanted side-effect of hurting Conkeldurr's grounded teammates. Foresight takes away a Ghost-type Pokemon's immunity to Fighting-type attacks, but VGC is generally too fast-paced for Conkeldurr to make any use of this.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Reuniclus is the biggest threat to this set, not being overly bothered by Conkeldurr's standard moves and OHKOing with Psychic. Psychic-types in general, such as Latios, and other fast special attackers also provide problems, as Conkeldurr does not have the special bulk required to take repeated special attacks, especially when considering burn damage. Ghost-types can often deal with Conkeldurr with little risk as well, assuming that they aren't as frail as Gengar. A Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics from most Pokemon will OHKO or severely damage Conkeldurr, and burn damage is soon to finish it off almost immediately if Conkeldurr does survive. Intimidate diminishes Conkeldurr's Attack and therefore its usefulness, meaning Conkeldurr can become dead weight, especially if the opponent brings out two Pokemon with Intimidate at the same time. Lastly, if Conkeldurr is burned and a damaging weather is in effect, then it will be losing 3/16th of its HP per turn, causing it to faint fairly quickly.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Status Orb": {
        "description": "<p>Guts is a fantastic ability in VGC. With a status Orb equipped, Conkeldurr gains an immunity to sleep and a permanent boost in Attack, a major advantage over Gems. Guts also negates the decrease in Attack burn causes, making Flame Orb the preferable item over Toxic Orb, as switching is often disadvantageous in VGC. This means that in the long run a burn will generally do less damage to Conkeldurr than severe poisoning. Drain Punch helps offset the burn recoil damage, and is also a decently powerful STAB move. Hammer Arm hits much harder, though, and makes Conkeldurr \"faster\" under Trick Room. Rock Slide provides good coverage, especially on Flying-types. Payback is an option on a set being used outside of Trick Room, as it is Conkeldurr's strongest option against Latios. Mach Punch is a powerful priority move and is Conkeldurr's main niche. Detect is an excellent move in VGC, being less likely to be shut down by enemy Imprison users than Protect. It is also essential for guaranteeing that Conkeldurr has a turn for Flame Orb to activate.</p> <p>The given EV spread reduces passive damage due to the HP number that the HP EVs give, meaning Conkeldurr has better survivability than it would with a simple 252 HP spread. Attack is of course maximized, and a 0 Speed IV helps Conkeldurr to move first under Trick Room. Facade is an extremely powerful move with good neutral coverage alongside Conkeldurr's chosen Fighting-type STAB move, only missing out on Ghost-types. Wide Guard is also an option over Detect, as many common moves in VGC, such as Surf and Blizzard, hit both Conkeldurr and its teammate.</p> <p>As stated earlier, Trick Room support is highly recommended. Conkeldurr can support Psychic-type Trick Room users, such as Reuniclus, by handling the Dark-types that plague them. Dark-type Pokemon themselves, such as Bisharp or Weavile, pair well with Conkeldurr for their ability to deal with Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon. Tyranitar is a notable exception to this, as its Sand Stream ability further decreases Conkeldurr's longevity. On that note, Politoed and Ninetales can also be used alongside this set, as their respective weather-inducing abilities alleviate Conkeldurr from the passive damage of sand or hail. Conkeldurr works especially well with rain teams for its ability to threaten Ferrothorn, a common threat to the playstyle.</p>"

  "Darmanitan": {
    "overview": "<p>A high Attack stat, above-average Speed, and a fantastic ability seem to set Darmanitan up for great things in VGC 2012. Unfortunately, this is the exception rather than the norm. Common spread moves such as Rock Slide, Surf, and Earthquake land super effective damage on Darmanitan, and its poor defenses further decrease its staying power. While this may turn off one's interest in Darmanitan, proper support and correct strategy will turn it into a premier attacker in VGC 2012.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt may seem like an attractive option, but Darmanitan's poor defenses and middling Speed mean it would rather be attacking, and bulkier, faster Pokemon utilize Taunt better in most cases anyway. A Choice Band turns Darmanitan into an unstoppable machine; Choice Band Flare Blitz OHKOes 252 HP Musharna, and has an excellent chance to OHKO physically defensive Cresselia in the sun, something no other Pokemon can boast. Stone Edge looks like a powerful alternative, but it has low accuracy and can only hit one opponent, making it inferior to Rock Slide. Brick Break may be used over Superpower if one finds the Attack and Defense drop unsuitable; however the drop in power is so great that Superpower or even Earthquake is usually the superior choice. U-turn has a niche on the Choice Scarf set, hitting Psychic-type Trick Room users hard and allowing Darmanitan to switch out before they have a chance to Trick Room and neuter it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Terrakion just avoids being OHKOed by Superpower, and can hit Darmanitan hard in return with a combination of Rock Slide to weaken it, and Quick Attack to KO. Other Rock- and Ground-types that resist Flare Blitz, such as Rhyperior with its high Defense and Garchomp with its Dragon typing, are able to take a hit and respond with a super effective Rock Slide or Earthquake. Gyarados walls Darmanitan to the end of the earth and back, lowering its Attack with Intimidate and taking next to nothing from Darmanitan's assaults outside of Rock Slide, while responding with a super effective Waterfall of its own.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Darmanitan's base 95 Speed is often not suitable for VGC, where many Pokemon reside at a base Speed of 100 or higher. However, Darmanitan is able to patch this up by donning a Choice Scarf, which boosts its Speed at the cost of it being able to use only one move. Thankfully, Flare Blitz is such as powerful move that this handicap is often not a handicap at all. Still, some Pokemon resist or are immune to Fire-type attacks, meaning Darmanitan can't run away with the game just by spamming Flare Blitz.</p> <p>Darmanitan does have several useful coverage options to fall back on should the foe resist its powerful STAB attacks. Tyranitar and Heatran give Darmanitan massive problems, the former resisting Darmanitan's STAB move and the latter being immune to it. Thankfully, Superpower is super effective against both of these Pokemon—Tyranitar being 4x weak—and with its Choice Scarf, Darmanitan easily outspeeds and OHKOes them. Rock Slide takes on Pokemon that otherwise wall Darmanitan, such as Chandelure. Earthquake rounds off Darmanitan's coverage, completing the QuakeSlide combo and hitting both foes at once; this can be utilized to great effect with an immune partner such as Cresselia. However, the recoil from Flare Blitz may be unattractive, and Fire Punch has certain situational uses, such as OHKOing the genies Tornadus and Thundurus, making it an option over Earthquake.</p> <p>With a Choice Scarf, a Jolly nature, and 252 Speed EVs, Darmanitan is able to outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Terrakion, which it would fail to otherwise. The remaining 252 EVs are placed in Attack to boost Darmanitan's damage output even further.</p> <p>Moves such as Rock Slide, Earthquake, and Surf threaten Darmanitan constantly, and as such it appreciates a partner that can mitigate this problem somewhat. Hitmontop provides both Intimidate and Wide Guard support; Intimidate lowers the power of Rock Slide and Earthquake, while Wide Guard blocks the effects of the previously mentioned spread moves for a turn. Cresselia is a great partner for Darmanitan, providing it with Helping Hand support while also being immune to Earthquake, if it is used. Ninetales brings sun to the field with its ability Drought, and once Flare Blitz has been powered up by sun, little can stop it.</p> <p>Powerful attackers also pair well with Darmanitan, as they can take out the Pokemon which threaten it while also cleaning up the remains after Darmanitan has sufficiently weakened the opposition with Flare Blitz. Expert Belt Weavile, in particular, is a great partner for Darmanitan; Fake Out + Flare Blitz OHKOes Pokemon such as Thundurus, which would otherwise cripple Darmanitan via a priority Thunder Wave. Weavile also OHKOes Pokemon that trouble Darmanitan, such as Heatran, Terrakion, and Tyranitar with Low Kick. Water-type Pokemon are a real annoyance to Darmanitan; this can be remedied by providing sun support and putting Darmanitan alongside Chlorophyll users such as Shiftry, which handle Water-types with ease. Any Fighting-type will aid Darmanitan greatly, as the Rock-types that threaten it are easily handled by their STAB moves. Zapdos and Thundurus also handle the Water-types that plague Darmanitan with ease, making them wonderful partners.</p>"

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Though Darmanitan's middling Speed becomes more predominant in the absence of a Choice Scarf, a Life Orb set can provide the sheer firepower which the Choice Scarf set lacks. STAB-, Life Orb-, and Sheer Force-boosted Flare Blitz has a mind-boggling Base Power of 304, destroying everything that doesn't resist it. Superpower deals with pesky Rock-types, as well as Heatran, which is immune to Flare Blitz via its ability Flash Fire. However, Earthquake deals damage to both opponents at once, and with an immune partner that can also provide Helping Hand support, such as Cresselia, it still gets the same KOs Superpower does. Keep in mind though that even with a Helping Hand boost, Earthquake won't OHKO Tyranitar, which will KO back with its STAB Rock-type attacks. Rock Slide, while granting little additional coverage, grants Darmanitan the ability to hit two opponents at once without harming its partner. Protect is vital to Darmanitan's well-being, allowing its partner to eliminate a threat and granting it a crucial additional turn of life.</p> <p>With its ability, Sheer Force, Darmanitan takes no recoil from Life Orb—while still receiving the boost—when using moves boosted by Sheer Force. This allows it to utilize a Life Orb relatively risk-free, as Life Orb will only cause recoil when Superpower is used. Darmanitan sits at an odd base Speed of 95, something very few other Pokemon have. A Jolly nature would thus be wasted on Darmanitan, as a Speed-boosting nature outspeeds nothing important, allowing it to run an Adamant nature and further boost its massive Attack. The given EV spread simply maximizes Darmanitan's Attack and Speed, as its poor defenses render any investment in its defensive stats useless.</p> <p>Base 95 Speed is relatively slow, as many of the Pokemon that stop Darmanitan are faster. Because of this, Darmanitan appreciates a partner that can slow the opponent down through moves such as Thunder Wave. Cresselia thus makes a fantastic partner, as it can utilize either Icy Wind, which slows down both foes, or Thunder Wave, which reduces Speed by 75% and has a chance to incapacitate the victim for a turn. On the other hand, Tailwind can be used to speed Darmanitan up, allowing it to outspeed and deal massive damage to its usual counters. Whimsicott sets up Tailwind with priority thanks to its ability, Prankster, and can Charm physical attackers that want to cause Darmanitan pain. Thundurus can paralyze faster foes with Thunder Wave and take on Water-types with its STAB Thunderbolt, making it a prime choice for a teammate. Zapdos can set up Tailwind as well, in addition to taking on Water-types with its powerful STAB Thunderbolt.</p>"

While it has more competition than it had in VGC 2011 from Hitmontop and Hariyama, it's still a great dual purpose Pokemon, helping set up Trick Room and then tearing opponents apart under its effects with its great dual STAB and Moxie.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Although its movepool is not too broad, there are definitely some interesting options hidden away in Scrafty's deep pockets. Shed Skin can be used in place of Moxie if you fear burn, but Scrafty enjoys accumulating Moxie boosts and it would be a shame to let free Attack boosts go to waste. Scrafty has Zen Headbutt, Rock Slide, Stone Edge, and even Smack Down to rid itself of troublesome Fighting- and Flying-types, but its partner Trick Room user should have something to deal with said Pokemon. Scrafty can learn Snarl to augment its bulk, but it's hard to find a slot for it. Payback can be used over Crunch if Scrafty is caught without Trick Room, but Crunch is overall more reliable. Fire Punch and ThunderPunch are available, but they don't offer much that the main options don't do already. Ice Punch is a perfectly viable move, allowing Scrafty to hit Flying-, Dragon-, and the oh-so-annoying Grass-types super effectively if you needed. Bear in mind, however, that with Ice Punch, Scrafty can't do anything to Shedinja. Hi Jump Kick can be used if only for the sheer power it provides, but Pokemon tend to use Protect against Scrafty due to Trick Room and Fake Out, so the recoil is off-putting.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Flying Gem and Acrobatics, especially from Pokemon that don't usually carry it such as Mienshao, Blaziken, and Gliscor, tend to KO Scrafty. Scrafty must be especially careful around those that are expected to carry it, such as Tornadus and Crobat, the latter having Inner Focus to prevent a flinch from Fake Out. Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Conkeldurr can KO any Scrafty that don't carry Chople Berry, and Conkeldurr can deal massive damage to Scrafty even with Hammer Arm and KO it next turn with Mach Punch. Metagross can use Hammer Arm as well to nail Scrafty, or it can just Meteor Mash it a few times, as Scrafty can't do much to Metagross outside of Fire Punch. Gyarados can spam Waterfall, taking little damage from Scrafty's attacks since Intimidate makes Scrafty next to useless. However, Gyarados must watch out for the rare ThunderPunch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Tank": {
        "description": "<p>This is Scrafty's best set, which both takes advantage of and helps to set up, with Fake Out, Trick Room. Drain Punch is Scrafty's Fighting STAB of choice, keeping it healthy and dealing hefty amounts of damage, especially after a Moxie boost. Crunch is the best move for the third slot, seeing as it receives STAB and provides great neutral coverage with Drain Punch. Chople Berry is the main item, protecting Scrafty from the Fighting-type moves most opponents use in hopes of KOing Scrafty. However, if you have a spare Sitrus Berry, that would help keep Scrafty in tip-top condition as well.</p> <p>If you need a little more power behind your attacks (and to help keep Scrafty's pants up), Expert Belt helps Scrafty secure crucial OHKOs and 2HKOs that it could not do with Chople Berry without a Moxie boost. The following are examples of Expert Belt's utility:</p> <ul> <li>Crunch vs. 252 HP / 4 Def Cresselia: 53.74% - 64.32%</li> <li>Crunch vs. 4 HP/4 Def Latios: 107.69% - 128.85%</li> <li>Drain Punch vs. 252 HP Abomasnow: 85.28% - 102.03%</li> <li>Drain Punch vs. 252 HP Tyranitar: 117.87% - 141.06%</li> </ul> <p>Scrafty is one of those Pokemon that doesn't need much support, but it is always appreciated. Scrafty hates strong Fighting-types, even with Chople Berry, so pairing it up with a Psychic- or Ghost-type Trick Room user is a good idea. Reuniclus, Cresselia, Slowking, Slowbro, Chandelure, and Dusclops are just a few examples of good partners in that regard. Scrafty can also make use of Politoed's Drizzle, which keeps hail and sandstorm from sapping Scrafty's HP, but such support isn't required.</p>"

It has low Speed, amazing defenses, and fewer weaknesses than other Trick Room users, such as Cresselia, Reuniclus, and Jellicent. However, in the VGC 2012 metagame, Cofagrigus is overshadowed by Dusknoir and Dusclops, two similar Pokemon that possess both higher defenses and superior movepools. Furthermore, many players prefer using Chandelure or Jellicent to set up Trick Room, as they can sweep more effectively with their dual STAB moves. In truth, the only reason to use Cofagrigus over its competitors would be its unique ability, Mummy, which can cripple the likes of Scizor, Conkeldurr, and Heracross, who rely on their abilities to do anything of note.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cofagrigus can run a more offensive Trick Room set with Calm Mind or Nasty Plot to boost its Special Attack, and with Hidden Power Fighting over Protect. Unfortunately, Cofagrigus's shallow movepool, along with its lack of secondary STAB, makes this option very unattractive, especially in such a fast-paced metagame. When Trick Room is in play, Cofagrigus can effectively use Disable to lock an opponent out of an attack; this can potentially remove a huge threat to your team or force Choice-locked Pokemon to Struggle or switch out. Cofagrigus has access to Destiny Bond and Memento, but those moves are better left to faster, frailer Pokemon that can make better use of their effects. Toxic is an option to cripple bulkier Pokemon such as Suicune or Blissey, but Will-O-Wisp is the more useful support move as it cripples physical attackers such as Tyranitar, who give Cofagrigus trouble. Finally, although Cofagrigus is bulky enough to run a ChestoRest set, this is often best left to other Pokemon as Cofagrigus's sole purpose is to set up Trick Room.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Even if Cofagrigus runs Hidden Power Fighting, Tyranitar is a serious threat as it can can OHKO Cofagrigus with a Dark Gem- or Choice Band-boosted Crunch. However, Tyranitar should be wary of Will-O-Wisp, which will leave it pretty much useless. Chandelure and Gengar can OHKO Cofagrigus with a Ghost Gem or Choice Specs attack, and can also use Imprison to prevent the use of Shadow Ball and Trick Room. Hydreigon can hit Cofagrigus hard with a Life Orb or Dark Gem Dark Pulse while taking little damage from Shadow Ball. Alternatively, bulky variants of Hydreigon can set up Substitute to block Will-O-Wisp, and then wreak havoc on your team. Houndoom, while very uncommon in the VGC 2012 metagame, completely walls all Cofagrigus that lack Hidden Power Fighting. Houndoom can also nab a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp and hit Cofagrigus hard with STAB Dark Pulse or Sucker Punch. In general, as Fire-type Pokemon are immune to Will-O-Wisp, any physical Fire-type sweeper, such as Infernape, Arcanine, or Darmanitan can potentially cause Cofagrigus trouble. Moreover, while Mental Herb can allow Cofagrigus to evade Taunt once and set up Trick Room, the opponent can Taunt a second time to block Will-O-Wisp and leave Cofagrigus helpless.</p>",

This, combined with Cofagrigus's immense bulk, almost guarantees that it will be able to set up Trick Room on turn one. Will-O-Wisp takes care of physical attackers that would normally pose a threat to Cofagrigus, most notably Tyranitar. Shadow Ball is Cofagrigus's best attacking move, and does a decent amount of damage to Pokemon such as Latios and Cresselia. Protect can come in handy to avoid an obvious super effective attack while Cofagrigus's ally attacks or sets up. On the other hand, Hidden Power Fighting allows Cofagrigus to dent the Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon that give it trouble.</p> <p>A Sassy nature and maximum Special Defense EVs nearly even out Cofagrigus's defenses, allowing it to survive strong super effective attacks, such as Shadow Balls from Chandelure and Gengar. As Cofagrigus's only real strength is setting up Trick Room, any item that makes this easier is a viable option. Mental Herb is the best item for Cofagrigus, as it is an obvious target for Taunt. However, Spore and Sleep Powder also hamper its ability to set up Trick Room, making Lum Berry a viable option if you are afraid of Amoonguss, Breloom, or Venusaur ruining Cofagrigus's day. A Kasib or a Colbur Berry can be used to weaken Ghost- or Dark-type attacks, respectively, such as Choice Specs boosted attacks from Chandelure or Hydreigon. A Sitrus Berry can also help Cofagrigus stick around for longer, especially if it has Fake Out support to stop incapacitating moves, such as Taunt and Spore. Finally, Hidden Power Fire and Ice are both good options to use in place of Hidden Power Fighting, depending on the needs of your team.</p> <p>Pokemon with Fake Out and the ability to hit Ghost-, Dark-, Normal-, and Steel-types super effectively, such as Scrafty and Hitmontop, are ideal partners to Cofagrigus. Follow Me and Rage Powder users can also aid Cofagrigus in setting up Trick Room by redirecting super effective attacks away from it. Lastly, Amoonguss is a great partner, as it has low Speed to work well in Trick Room, as well as the ability to reliably put opponents to sleep with Spore.</p>"

Archeops's impressive base 140 Attack and 110 Speed are held back by the combination of its poor defensive typing, subpar defensive stats, and Defeatist, which halves Archeops's Attack and Special Attack stats when its HP falls below half in battle. This makes life difficult for the ancient bird, as just about any attack will cause it to give up on the battle—provided that it doesn't just outright faint from the attack. To make things worse, with Steel-type Pokemon such as Metagross and Scizor making a return in VGC 2012, there are a lot more Pokemon that are able to take Archeops's moves head-on. Although Archeops can be tricky to use, it can be a powerful force if you can provide support to it and keep it from giving up on the battle too early.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Archeops has a base 112 Special Attack stat and a number of usable special moves, such as Earth Power, Focus Blast, and Hidden Power. However, because Archeops lacks a decent special STAB move, it is difficult to justify running a special set. A mixed set is possible, but Archeops fails to OHKO Pokemon without a Life Orb, and it cannot run Acrobatics with that. Other than the aforementioned special moves, Archeops can run Taunt to stop Trick Room or other setup moves, or U-turn to switch out while dealing a bit of damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Taking away Archeops's Speed advantage in any way will leave it in a tough spot. Archeops is murdered by STAB Bullet Punch, making Pokemon such as Metagross and Scizor excellent choices for shooting the prehistoric bird out of the air. Likewise, Pokemon with STAB Sucker Punch and Ice Shard, such as Bisharp or Mamoswine, respectively, will also keep Archeops at bay. Thundurus surpasses Archeops by one point of Speed and can OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Swift Swim Pokemon such as Ludicolo or Kingdra can outspeed Archeops and KO if in the rain. Sableye can cripple Archeops by Tricking a Lagging Tail onto it or burning it with Will-O-Wisp. Lastly, setting up Trick Room will leave Archeops a sitting duck in the battle.</p>",

As previously stated, Flying Gem makes Acrobatics an extremely powerful attack, and also has the benefit of allowing Archeops to use Acrobatics from the start. A Rock Gem can be used instead of a Flying Gem, but it means that Rock Slide must be used once before Acrobatics can be used properly. Quick Guard can be used by Archeops, as it is faster than all Fake Out users with the exception of Weavile and Ambipom; it also can save an ally from being picked off by Sucker Punch or Bullet Punch. Head Smash is also a valid option for Archeops to run; while the recoil will almost always lead to the activation of Defeatist, Head Smash is extremely powerful and frees up Archeops's item slot. A Sitrus Berry or a Choice Scarf is a good option if you decide to run Head Smash on Archeops.</p> <p>Archeops values support from its ally. Icy Wind and Tailwind support from Pokemon such as Cresselia and Zapdos, respectively, allow Archeops to keep ahead of the opponent and continue to strike hard and fast. Pokemon that can handle Steel-types, such as Heatran and Garchomp, are appreciated so that Archeops does not have to worry about being shot down by Bullet Punch. Tyranitar and Hitmontop can also be helpful, as sand and Intimidate support improves Archeops's survivability. Lastly, a Heal Pulse Latias or Latios can make a decent partner for Archeops, healing it back above 50% of its HP, thus maintaining its offensive power.</p>"

  "Zoroark": {
    "overview": "<p>With a respectable base 105 Attack and base 120 Special Attack, and enough of a movepool to utilize them, Zoroark can do some serious damage if left alone. However, with its poor base 60 / 60 / 60 defenses, Zoroark can be OHKOed by powerful STAB moves. Fortunately for Zoroark, its unique ability, Illusion, helps it out both offensively and defensively. Illusion lets Zoroark masquerade as the last Pokemon selected in a team of four. However, thanks to Team Preview, the opponent will still be alerted to Zoroark's existence. While some might say that Team Preview ruins Zoroark's surprise factor, simply knowing that Zoroark might show up does not say anything about when it will actually reveal itself, or if it is even in the battle at all. With the right timing and the right Illusion, this master of disguise will leave the opponent wondering what just hit them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Grass Knot can be useful to hit Water-types super effectively. Hidden Power Ice can be useful as Zoroark can outrun Pokemon such as Salamence, Garchomp, and Landorus, and hit them hard. Substitute is an interesting option for Zoroark, as damage dealt to a Substitute does not break Zoroark's Illusion. Substitute variants of Zoroark also pair well with Fake Out users. However, a few issues arise: Zoroark's frailty means that just about anything will be able to break its Substitutes, and the opponent will likely get suspicious if the Pokemon Zoroark is masquerading as suddenly outruns something it should not normally be able to. Zoroark can use Taunt to disrupt support moves, particularly Trick Room or Tailwind, and from behind an Illusion, can catch opponents off-guard. Lastly, Counter can allow Zoroark to deal the ultimate surprise attack against physical attackers, but it is extremely risky.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>It can be a bit difficult to try to handle Zoroark without knowing if it is even present on the field. About all that can be done is to wait for it to show itself, or show that it's not around. A bit of caution can go a long way. Once Zoroark has shown itself, Fighting-types tend to be best in confronting it. Hitmontop, Conkeldurr, and Terrakion in particular can easily take Zoroark's attacks and OHKO it with Fighting-type moves. Tyranitar and Heatran can also wall Zoroark as long as Zoroark doesn't run Focus Blast.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Zoroark tends to get one good surprise attack on the opponent before he or she becomes aware of Zoroark's presence on the field. Sucker Punch is extremely effective, surprising opponents with an unexpected STAB priority attack. Dark Pulse is used in tandem with Sucker Punch for a secondary STAB move. It is also useful for striking down Trick Room users, as many are weak to Dark-type moves. Night Daze can be used over Dark Pulse if you're willing to trade a bit of accuracy for a bit more power; the choice between these moves is personal preference. Flamethrower allows Zoroark to catch Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Scizor off-guard and deal heavy damage to them. Focus Blast can be used over Flamethrower, as it still hits Steel-types hard, while also enabling Zoroark to take on Pokemon such as Heatran and Tyranitar. However, Focus Blast's lackluster accuracy is a major issue. The last move for Zoroark is Protect, which is especially useful as it blocks incoming attacks while keeping Illusion intact. Using Protect will not give away Zoroark, as it is a common move on many Pokemon.</p> <p>76 Speed EVs give Zoroark 135 Speed, allowing it to outrun neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon, as well as positive-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon. The rest of the EVs are invested into Zoroark's offense: maximize Attack and place the rest in Special Attack. If outrunning the aforementioned Pokemon is of no concern, the Speed EVs can instead go into Special Attack. Holding a Focus Sash allows Zoroark to get away with not investing in its defenses. An alternative EV spread along the lines of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpA can be used; the added survivability lets Zoroark hold a Life Orb without worrying as much about being OHKOed by strong STAB moves, such as Zapdos's Thunderbolt or rain sweepers' Surf. Life Orb balances out the lowered Special Attack, while boosting the power of Sucker Punch. Night Slash can be used over Dark Pulse or Night Daze as it will do more damage to most Trick Room users, who tend to be specially defensive. However, the two special attacks are slightly more powerful against Pokemon with equal defensive stats and have more useful secondary effects. Night Slash is recommended if running the alternative spread provided, though, as the Special Attack EVs are removed.</p> <p>Illusion makes running Zoroark reliant on its team members in order to bring out its full potential. Its role can change drastically depending on what it is masquerading as and whether or not it leads in the battle. Masquerading as a Trick Room user, or Gastrodon against a rain team, for example, can draw attention away from Zoroark's partner, letting Zoroark play a more supportive role on a team. If it pretends to be a Fighting-type, Zoroark can draw Psychic-type moves to itself and waste the opponent's turn, while posing as a Ghost-type improves enables Zoroark to increase its survivability, and stops opponents from using Fake Out against it; both of these situations allow Zoroark to take on an offensive role. A word of caution when choosing a Pokemon for Illusion: Pokemon that have ability activation messages upon entry, such as Zapdos and Porygon2, make poor choices for Illusion, as Zoroark will not display these messages when it enters the battle, thus giving itself away before it gets to do anything. Zoroark partners well with Pokemon that have strong priority moves. Double-targeting an opponent with priority moves is a good way to grab quick KOs against many speedy Pokemon. Bulky Pokemon can use the diversion that Zoroark creates to soften the opponent up for surprise Sucker Punches. Lastly, it is usually not a good idea to pair Zoroark with a Fake Out user, as this increases the risk of Zoroark running into a Protect and its Illusion being broken.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set focuses on putting Zoroark's base 105 Speed to use. Dark Pulse serves as Zoroark's main attack and is interchangeable with Night Daze, trading a bit of accuracy for extra power. Flamethrower and Focus Blast provide good coverage, allowing Zoroark to hit hard against many common Pokemon, such as Tyranitar, Metagross, and Abomasnow. Sucker Punch can be used instead of one of these moves as it can still do some respectable damage, and priority moves are always welcome on any moveset. However, it will leave some gaps in Zoroark's offensive coverage. Lastly, Protect allows Zoroark to block incoming attacks and maintain Illusion.</p> <p>The EVs allow Zoroark to hit as hard and as fast as possible. Zoroark's high Speed makes it less dependent on Illusion, although it still appreciates the offensive openings that are created by its ability. Focus Sash allows Zoroark to take a hit without the worry of being OHKOed. A Dark Gem or Life Orb can be used over a Focus Sash to provide some extra firepower behind Zoroark's moves, but leaves it at the mercy of the many Pokemon that can outpace and and OHKO it, such as Latios, meaning that Zoroark will have to rely heavily on Illusion in order to avoid being OHKOed. If Sucker Punch is used, a Hasty nature should be used instead of a Timid one. 44 Attack EVs along with a Life Orb guarantees that Sucker Punch OHKOes 4 HP Latios.</p> <p>Zoroark is at its best when outrunning and KOing an opponent, while pretending to be a Pokemon that normally cannot do much in the given situation; a few ways to accomplish this include having a lead setup that makes foes weak to Dark- or Fire-type moves drop their guard, or using Zoroark as a revenge killer. For example, if Zoroark impersonates a Fighting-type, it can lure Psychic-type enemies into wasting a turn using a STAB attack on Zoroark, while it strikes at them with a Dark Pulse. Alternatively, Zoroark can use Illusion to act as a diversion, such as by posing as a Trick Room user. Keep in mind when choosing a Pokemon for an Illusion that Zoroark does not display ability activation messages upon entry. Thus, letting Zoroark pose as Pokemon such as Dusclops or Zapdos will immediately alert the opponent that Zoroark is on the field. Fast Pokemon, especially Latios, can work well with Zoroark, as they can cover each other's weaknesses, while maintaining decent Speed control over the opponent. Bulky Pokemon can also be used alongside Zoroark as Zoroark can provide a great diversion. Lastly, Fake Out users tend to not work well with Zoroark, as they encourage the use of Protect, which is counterproductive as Zoroark mainly tries to get the opponent to let down their guard.</p>"

  "Solosis": {
    "overview": "<p>While most people will think that Solosis is just a gimmick that should never be used, it actually performs quite well in VGC 2012. Solosis is one of the few Pokemon that can be used as a FEAR Trick Room user, and it has a niche over others such as Whimsicott and Smeargle. Thanks to Solosis's unique ability, Magic Guard, weather such as hail and sand doesn't affect Solosis. On the contrary, it actually helps Solosis, as it KOes Pokemon that Solosis uses Endeavor on. Another factor that separates Solosis from other FEAR Pokemon is that it gains Imprison, so it can also be used to stop Trick Room from being reversed or stop Protect once Trick Room is up. However, Solosis isn't a perfect Pokemon. Due to its being Lv. 1, it isn't hard to beat, and after its job is done, it's dead weight. Also, because it's at Level 1, your opponent will know its function. However, Solosis is a cool blob; use it!</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The moveset provided above showcases the most useful options Solosis can use. However, there are a few other options Solosis can use. Attract, Confuse Ray, and Swagger can be used to leave the opponent crippled; however, Attract won't affect Pokemon of the same gender, confusion won't always work, and Solosis has better things to do anyways. Charm can be used to make Solosis weaken other Pokemon, which can prove useful for Solosis's teammates. Explosion may seem like an odd option, but it can be used to ensure a safe switch in for Solosis's teammates and KO Pokemon that Solosis has hit with Endeavor. Reflect and Light Screen can be used to help boost the Defense or Special Defense, respectively, of Solosis's teammates, though Solosis can't afford to run both, as it suffers from four-moveslot syndrome. Rain Dance can be used to activate rain, activating rain-related abilities and boosting Water-type attacks while weakening Fire-type attacks, but Solosis tends to love sand and hail more, as both can KO its foes that aren't immune to said weathers. Finally, Trick can be used to take away the opponents item once Focus Sash is used up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Because Solosis is at Lv. 1, it isn't hard to beat, so true counters are Pokemon that stop it from doing its job. Chandelure is its best counter, as it can use Imprison to stop Solosis from using three moves out of its movepool and it is immune to Endeavor. Ghost-type Pokemon in general beat Solosis due to their immunity to Endeavor. Ferrothorn is another good check, as it can break Solosis's Focus Sash after Solosis uses Endeavor and KO it with an attack. Taunt ruins Solosis, especially as Solosis has to use a Focus Sash, meaning it has no protection from Taunt. Pokemon with priority moves, such as Scizor, Conkeldurr, and Metagross can just use the moves to break Solosis before it can react. Pokemon with multi-hit moves, such as Cloyster, will plow right through Focus Sash.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "FEAR": {
        "description": "<p>Even though this moveset looks plain to the naked eye, it does so much to help its team win. Trick Room and Endeavor are staples of this set, as Solosis's base 20 Speed gives it an advantage in Trick Room, and Endeavor severely weakens the opponent. Additionally, Solosis's base 20 Speed is lower than any other FEAR Pokemon, including Whimsicott and Smeargle. Protect ensures that Solosis will keep its Focus Sash intact, especially because opponents will double target it to prevent Trick Room from going up, meaning its partner can set up Trick Room instead. Imprison prevents Trick Room from being reversed once it's up and stops Protect, which makes Solosis usable in this metagame.</p> <p>Because Solosis is at Lv. 1, EVs and Nature don't matter. Also, Focus Sash is a must, especially because it's at Lv. 1. The ability choice isn't hard either, as Magic Guard outclasses Overcoat because it does what Overcoat does and much more, such as evading damage from status such as burn and poison.</p> <p>The one Pokemon that has Solosis's number, Chandelure, can shut it down with Imprison. To make matters worse, Chandelure is immune to Endeavor, the only move Solosis can use once it is hit with Imprison. As such, Pokemon such as Rock Gem Rock Blast Rhyperior, Gigalith, or Armaldo work wonders, as they can use Rock Gem boosted Rock Blast to OHKO Chandelure though Focus Sash, ensuring Trick Room can be set up. Armaldo also beats Dark-type Pokemon, so it is useful in trying to keep Solosis alive. Tyranitar is useful too; Crunch and Rock Slide will finish off Chandelure on the first turn, with Sand Stream killing off Chandelure after its Focus Sash is broken. Ghost-type Pokemon, such as Chandelure and Jellicent, also partner up well, as they are immune to Fake Out and can set up Trick Room if Solosis is threatened by a Fake Out user, though Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar will be tough to face. Fake Out users, such as Scrafty and Hariyama, work well because they buy Solosis time to set up Trick Room. Scrafty is the most notable example because it can use its Dark-type STAB attacks to beat Ghost-types. Follow Me and Rage Powder users such as Togekiss, Lucario, and Amoonguss work well because they draw attacks away from Solosis. Finally, Tyranitar and Abomasnow's weather summoning is useful, as the residual damage can finish off foes that have been hit with Endeavor.</p>"

  "Reuniclus": {
    "overview": "<p>Reuniclus is one of the best offensive users of Trick Room in VGC 2012, boasting an excellent Special Attack stat, great bulk, and a fantastic ability in Magic Guard, allowing Reuniclus to ignore damaging weather and make very good use of the one Life Orb allowed per team. It is not without fault though; it is not as bulky as more dedicated Trick Room users and can be OHKOed by certain attacks, such as a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor from Latios. It is also susceptible to most Steel-types, especially Scizor and Metagross. Reuniclus is also unable to do much about Taunt or Encore. Still, there are few users of Trick Room that are stronger than the little gelatinous embryo, and it should be one of the first Pokemon considered when looking for someone to fill such a role.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fighting is far weaker than Focus Blast and misses out on important KOs, but is still an option for its accuracy. Hidden Power Fire mauls Scizor and Ferrothorn, and outdamages Focus Blast against most other Steel-types, but it can be useless if it is raining. Reuniclus has the bulk to use Reflect and Light Screen, but there are better users, especially when it comes to dual screens users that can set up Trick Room, such as Cresselia. Recover can be used to heal off damage, but Pokemon rarely have a chance to heal in the fast-paced metagame of VGC 2012. Snatch can steal Safeguard or Tailwind, but Reuniclus will generally want the standard moves over this option, and there are Pokemon that can make better use of Snatch. Reuniclus can opt to run a Modest nature and Thunder Wave over Trick Room, allowing it to fulfill a similar role to its Trick Room set on faster offensive teams without being a hindrance. Reuniclus can also abuse Trick and Flame Orb, crippling a physical attacker while also protecting itself from being put to sleep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Pokemon that disrupt Reuniclus's attempts to set up Trick Room are a threat, whether through Fake Out, Taunt, or an attack strong enough to OHKO Reuniclus. Priority Encore from Whimsicott can also cripple Reuniclus, forcing it to waste two turns; the first as it is locked into Trick Room and forced to use it a second time, removing the field effect, and the second when it attempts to reset Trick Room. Powerful attackers also pose a serious threat. Latios can OHKO with a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor, while Reuniclus can do little back without Shadow Ball. Scrafty can disrupt Reuniclus with Fake Out and do serious damage with a STAB Crunch, OHKOing if it carries a Dark Gem. Iron Ball Tyranitar \"outspeeds\" Reuniclus while Trick Room is up and can OHKO with Fling. Scizor is only threatened if Reuniclus carries Hidden Power Fire and can OHKO with its STAB Technician Bug Bite, or deal serious damage with Bullet Punch if Trick Room is already up. Double-targeting or attacks that hit multiple targets can also make set-up that much more difficult for Reuniclus. Opposing Trick Room users can also opt to use the move themselves, removing the field effect and leaving Reuniclus a sitting duck.</p>",

      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Trick Room is the most important aspect of this set, as Speed is one of the most important factors in the VGC metagame, something Trick Room easily takes advantage of. Psychic is Reuniclus's most powerful attack, able to put a dent in anything that doesn't resist it. Psyshock is a slightly weaker move, but it hits specially bulky Pokemon such as Amoonguss harder. Focus Blast provides the necessary coverage on Tyranitar and other Dark-types, as well as most Steel-types, although more common Steel-types such as Metagross only take neutral damage from it. Lastly Shadow Ball provides coverage on other Psychic types, notably Latios and Cresselia, although Reuniclus will be hard-pressed to beat either on its own. For this reason, Protect is a viable alternative, allowing Reuniclus to scout the opponent's moveset or build up residual damage if sand or hail is out.</p> <p>The EV spread provides Reuniclus with nice overall bulk, helping it to survive attacks it might fall to with a simple 252 HP spread. Magic Guard makes Life Orb an ideal hold item, as Reuniclus can make better use of the one allowed per team than most other Pokemon. However, Life Orb sometimes falls short in power, so a Psychic Gem is also an option, notably allowing Reuniclus to OHKO Thundurus or Tornadus with a boosted Psychic. Mental Herb can prevent Taunt from foiling Reuniclus's attempt to set up, but it is often put to better use on a bulkier user of Trick Room, such as Cresselia or Musharna. Thunder is an option if Reuniclus is paired with Politioed, as it hits most Steel-types with the same amount of power as Focus Blast and, while it is raining, does not suffer from the same accuracy issues.</p> <p>Dark-types are the biggest threat to Reuniclus: Tyranitar and Scrafty in particular, the latter of which can disrupt Reuniclus's first-turn attempt to set up Trick Room through Fake Out. Reuniclus itself threatens Fighting-types, so the same Pokemon that threaten Reuniclus make great partners for it. Scrafty is a deadly Trick Room sweeper thanks to Moxie, and also makes setting the field condition up easier thanks to Fake Out. Tyranitar effortlessly disposes of Latios and Cresselia and also benefits from Trick Room, especially Iron Ball Fling variants. Reuniclus does not mind the sand Tyranitar brings either. Pairing Reuniclus with another Trick Room user can help to extend the duration of Trick Room, as if both Reuniclus and its teammate successfully use it on the same turn, Trick Room will first be deactivated, then reactivated, resetting the turn counter to five. Reuniclus can also be fit onto a faster team in order to steal back momentum from very fast Pokemon, such as Swift Swim Kingdra. It can be dead weight if its remaining teammates are faster than their opponents, however.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Escavalier's combination of bulky defenses, high Attack power, and low Speed make it an excellent Trick Room abuser. However, even with its massive Attack stat, Escavalier has a very small movepool, limiting its options for coverage moves. This doesn't mean Escavalier is without uses though; it actually fills a great niche in being able to OHKO one of the bulkiest Pokemon in the metagame: Cresselia. Escavalier also has a 4x weakness to Fire-type attacks, so Pokemon such as Volcarona and Chandelure can be problematic. However, this doesn't mean Escavalier isn't good at being an offensive Trick Room tank.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Escavalier can use one of the vast majority of Normal-type moves it gets, such as Return and Headbutt, to deal neutral damage to those that don't resist Normal-type moves. Bug Gem used in tandem with the move X-Scissor can be used as a more reliable option over Megahorn, being able to hit just as hard and not miss as often, but only once. Knock Off can be used to get rid of the items on the opponent. Substitute is a cool move to use if Escavalier's given the opportunity to use it. With Escavalier's bulky defenses, Substitutes tend to be hard to break. Life Orb is a nice item for Escavalier to boost the power of its moves and hit harder.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fire-types, such as Chandelure and Volcarona, run around Escavalier all day with resistances to both of its STABs and the ability to KO it with Heat Wave or Flamethrower. Steel-types, including Scizor and Excadrill, are hardly even damaged by both of Escavalier's STABs and can hit back for neutral damage with moves in their arsenal. Zapdos is by all means a counter to Escavalier, with its advantageous typing and access to Heat Wave. Pokemon that can cause burns generally mean trouble for Escavalier, as with a burn it's almost completely useless.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Megahorn is Escavalier's strongest move. An already strong attack boosted by STAB, it allows Escavalier to KO many threats, such as Ludicolo, Abomasnow, and Cresselia. Iron Head is Escavalier's second STAB to abuse. Even with terrible Steel typing, it still hits lots of common Pokemon hard with neutral or super effective coverage. Double-Edge gives Escavalier coverage to hit Pokemon such as Zapdos, and makes it easier to be put in Swarm range. Quick Guard is also an option, as it can protect teammates from annoying priority moves, such as Sucker Punch and Mach Punch. Protect is standard on any Pokemon being used in VGC, giving Escavalier the ability to stall and not collect damage for the turn, helping against serious threats to it such as Chandelure, Zapdos, and Volcarona, all of which can OHKO it with Fire-type moves.</p> <p>An Occa Berry can soften the blow of a single Fire-type move to help Escavalier last longer. Bug Gem can be used to let Megahorn hit amazingly hard against anything, especially if Swarm is in effect. Swarm is the best ability for Escavalier, as Shell Armor doesn't help all that much. A Brave nature optimizes Escavalier's Attack while decreasing its Speed for optimal Trick Room use. Maximum investment in HP helps Escavalier have all-around bulk to go with its nice 105 / 105 defensive stats, and full investment in Attack allows Escavalier to hit harder. Having a Speed IV of 0 ensures Escavalier will be as slow as possible for Trick Room use.</p> <p>Pokemon that set up Trick Room are obviously great teammates, making Escavalier the fastest Pokemon on the field while Trick Room is active. Jellicent is a particularly good partner with great typing synergy and the ability to set Trick Room. Iron Ball Politoed is a good partner because it can set rain, making Fire-types less of a threat, and it can abuse Trick Room itself. Escavalier can use Quick Guard to stop Sucker Punch or other priority attacks from hurting Escavalier's partners. Rock Slide users, such as Terrakion and Rhyperior, can clear lots of the Pokemon that might threaten Escavalier, such as Zapdos and Chandelure.</p>"

It's one of the few Pokemon in the game to have access to Spore, which is great for removing a threatening Pokemon by putting it to sleep. Its abysmal Speed makes it a force to be reckoned with under Trick Room; moreover, it receives Rage Powder, which allows its partner to set up Trick Room safely. All of Amoonguss's advantages makes it a perfect support Pokemon in doubles, and it should never be overlooked.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stun Spore can be used alongside Spore for double status, but it is usually an inferior choice considering its shaky accuracy. Toxic shuts down most other support Pokemon, but it's usually an inferior option because Amoonguss is usually better off shutting down its opponents completely with Spore. Synthesis instantly regains a significant portion of Amoonguss's health, but with the prevalence of rain, sandstorm, and hail, it is discouraged. Hidden Power Ice is a possible options over Protect as it hits Flying- and Dragon-types for super effective damage, such as Zapdos and Latios.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>If Amoonguss is lacking Mental Herb, Taunt shuts it down completely by preventing it from using Spore and Rage Powder. Amoonguss is threatened by most users of Flying Gem Acrobatics, and must carry a Coba Berry to avoid being OHKOed. Powerful Fire-types, such as Chandelure, Infernape, and Heatran, can deal a lot of damage to Amoonguss with their STAB attacks, but this can be remedied by providing Amoonguss with rain support. Physical Psychic-types, such as Metagross and Gallade, can hurt Amoonguss badly with Zen Headbutt, and can even Trick it a Choice item to shut it down. Pokemon with the Sap Sipper ability can also be problematic as they are unaffected by Spore and Giga Drain, receiving an Attack boost when hit by them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set brings out Amoonguss's full potential as a team player and a defensive Pokemon. Spore is a staple on Amoonguss, as it allows Amoonguss to instantly put a threatening foe to sleep, rendering it helpless for several turns. Rage Powder, which redirects any attack aimed at Amoonguss's partner back to itself, is another non-negotiable move, as it is especially helpful for allowing Amoonguss's teammate to set up safely. Giga Drain is Amoonguss's STAB move of choice; not only does it prevent Amoonguss from becoming dead weight if Taunted, it also ensures that Amoonguss's health is as high as possible. Protect is generally a useful move in doubles, as it allows Amoonguss to avoid a possible attack from either opponent. Sludge Bomb is a stronger STAB move and stops Amoonguss from being walled by opposing Grass-types and Pokemon with the Sap Sipper ability. Sitrus Berry capitalizes on Amoonguss's bulk, restoring Amoonguss's health when it drops below half. Mental Herb prevents Taunt's effects for one turn and guarantees that Amoonguss will pull off one Spore.</p> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense is the best spread, allowing Amoonguss to stay alive for as long as possible.

Such a spread would also give Amoonguss a better chance of surviving Zen Headbutt from Metagross and Gallade so it can put them to sleep. A Sassy nature allows Amoonguss to be as slow as possible should it be used on a Trick Room team, as it makes Amoonguss as fast as possible under Trick Room. Coba Berry and Occa Berry reduce the damage Amoonguss takes from powerful Flying- and Fire-type attacks, respectively. Black Sludge and Leftovers give Amoonguss gradual HP recovery, but due to the fast-paced nature of doubles play, the slow health recovery is not that beneficial. 68 Speed EVs and a neutral Speed nature allow Amoonguss to outpace Quiet Abomasnow and put it to sleep or nail it with Sludge Bomb. Rock-types, such as Tyranitar and Rhyperior, appreciate having Amoonguss as a partner, because it can divert Grass-, Water-, and Fighting-type attacks aimed at them. In return, they can deal with most Fire- and Flying-types that plague Amoonguss. Amoonguss also works well with Trick Room users, such as Slowbro, Slowking, and Jellicent, as it resists Electric- and Grass-type moves aimed at those three. Lastly, Amoonguss works extremely well on Drizzle teams as the rain reduces damage it takes from Fire-type attacks, and it can use Rage Powder to redirect Grass- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Politoed.</p>"

  "Jellicent": {
    "overview": "<p>Jellicent was a superstar of VGC 2011, and it's no different in 2012. Nice bulk, along with reliable forms of recovery, makes it last longer for maximum utility. Due to this bulk and immunity to Fake Out, Jellicent makes a great Trick Room setter for the many Pokemon that can use it effectively in this metagame, such as Hariyama, Marowak, and Reuniclus. Additionally, Jellicent greatly appreciates rain support to take advantage of STAB Water Spout. However, sun teams will completely stop this if you aren't prepared. Without proper support, Jellicent is an easy target for Electric-type attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jellicent can use a Choice Scarf to outspeed threats without needing Tailwind support, but being Choice-locked into a move can put it in a tough position. To make matters worse, Jellicent will lack power if using a Timid nature. Pain Split is a recovery option, but it's very circumstantial. Safeguard can be used to prevent Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Breloom from messing up your whole team with Spore. Confuse Ray is an option for a bulky set, but while it can stop some threats, it is also a risky tactic. Blizzard can be used over Ice Beam on an offensive set if Jellicent is paired with Abomasnow. Double Blizzard spam can be extremely effective due to the freeze chance, as well as the high power. However, Jellicent isn't immune to hail recoil, so it's definitely something to watch out for. Finally, Jellicent can run a bulky Trick Room supporter set with an EV set of 188 HP / 164 Def / 156 SpA and a Quiet nature.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Jellicent has a major weakness to moves that hit it super effectively. As such, Pokemon to watch out for include Tyranitar, Bisharp, Ferrothorn, Breloom, Zapdos, Ludicolo, and Chandelure. Jellicent is also easily checked by bulky threats: for example, Calm Mind Cresselia can boost up and hit Jellicent hard, while Leech Seed Ferrothorn can drain Jellicent's health and stall it to death. Always be aware of Sucker Punch users when using Jellicent; Jellicent can try and make an obvious kill, but get finished off by a surprise Sucker Punch from an opposing Hitmontop or Honchkrow.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Setter": {
        "description": "<p>The main goal of this set is for Jellicent to provide team support in the form of Trick Room, so naturally Trick Room is in the first moveslot. Jellicent has a miserable time handling physical attackers, such as Bisharp and Tyranitar; therefore, the burn chance from Scald can come in handy. Alternatively, Water Spout is a more powerful STAB move, which lets Jellicent deal huge damage to the opposition if Jellicent is at full health and given rain support. Shadow Ball provides coverage against common Trick Room counters that can plague Trick Room teams, namely Musharna, Azelf, and Chandelure, who can either reverse Trick Room or Imprison your Pokemon. Shadow Ball also hits Latias and Latios harder than Ice Beam would. Finally, Protect allows Jellicent to stall for more burn damage, or just lets you keep Jellicent out of harm's way while your partner does work. You can run Ice Beam for added coverage against Grass-types, such as Whimsicott and Amoonguss, and Dragon-types, such as Garchomp, Salamence, and Dragonite, but common teammates will more than likely have Ice-type coverage moves, so this is a lesser option. Unlike Scald, Will-O-Wisp guarantees a burn if it hits, which can be useful.</p> <p>Jellicent has a terrible time handling strong Electric-type attacks. Hence, Jellicent can use Wacan Berry to take some of the strongest Electric-type attacks, such as Electric Gem Thunder from a Modest Zapdos. However, if through team support of some sort, Jellicent doesn't need to worry about Electric-type attacks, Sitrus Berry is a great item to help with longevity. Water Absorb is a useful ability that gives Jellicent a real reason to be on a rain team. With it, Jellicent recovers 25% of its health when hit by a Water-type attack, which means Jellicent's partner can spam Surf while Jellicent not only avoids damage, but in fact gains more health to live longer. A Quiet nature gives two benefits: first, it powers up Jellicent's offensive moves, ensuring maximum damage on foes, and second, it decreases Jellicent's Speed stat, making it faster under Trick Room. Special Attack investment is maximized to ensure Jellicent's attacking moves hit as hard as possible, and with the defensive EVs given, Jellicent gains enough bulk to last longer against strong special attackers, because physical attackers lose a lot of power after being burned. A 0 Speed IV gives Jellicent as low a Speed stat as possible for best use under Trick Room.</p> <p>Politoed makes a good partner as it is able to summon rain and fire away Surf, which gives Jellicent recovery. Jellicent loves Lightningrod supporters, such as Marowak and Seaking, because with them on the field, Jellicent has no worry of being harmed by Electric-type moves outside of Discharge. Users of Explosion or Selfdestruct, such as Snorlax, Metagross, and Lickilicky, work well with Jellicent, who is immune to those attacks. Rage Powder or Follow Me users pair well with Jellicent too, as they draw in powerful attacks that the opponent will try and use to KO Jellicent before you get to do anything with it. They can even draw in Sucker Punches so Jellicent can fire away offensive attacks. Fighting-type Fake Out supporters, such as Hitmontop, Hariyama, and Scrafty, make great teammates because they can handle Dark-types with Fighting-type STAB and make them flinch with Fake Out.</p>"
      },
      "Water Spout Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>In VGC 2011, Jellicent was a menace with Water Spout; VGC 2012 is no different. Water Spout is a powerful STAB move that gets easy KOes on all who do not resist it. Shadow Ball is another STAB move, and though it doesn't nab many notable OHKOs, it does 2HKO most Latios and Latias. As Water Spout is weakened over the course of a game, however, Shadow Ball becomes the STAB move of choice after Jellicent takes a hit. Ice Beam gives Jellicent super effective coverage to hit Dragon- and Flying-types, Tornadus and Garchomp. Protect is a common utility move in VGC; it can be used to stall, keep Jellicent protected for a turn, or prevent damage from the rare Scrappy Fake Out from Kangaskhan.</p> <p>Water Gem gives Jellicent the power to hit the opposition hard with Water Spout. However, Sitrus Berry heals up Jellicent so Water Spout can still be strong after Jellicent takes some damage. Water Absorb grants Jellicent an immunity to Water-type attacks, and also allows it to replenish health when hit by a Water-type move. Water Absorb makes Jellicent a great fit for a rain team as well. Cursed Body is a nice option if team support means the Water-type immunity isn't needed. Modest is the nature of choice as Jellicent needs all the power it can get. It can run Timid, but the boost in Speed is small and not helpful. The EV spread makes Jellicent as fast and strong as possible.</p> <p>Tailwind support is needed so Jellicent can outspeed the opponent and hit hard with a full-powered Water Spout. Tornadus and Whimsicott are great teammates as they bring priority Tailwind. Fighting-types who provide Fake Out support, such as Hitmontop, Hariyama, and Scrafty, work well because they can handle Dark-types with Fighting-type STAB and make them flinch with Fake Out. As a bonus, their STAB attacks decimate Dark-type Pokemon, such as Bisharp, Hydreigon, and Tyranitar, as well as Ferrothorn, all of whom otherwise threaten Jellicent with super effective STAB moves. Jellicent also appreciates support from Rage Powder or Follow Me users, who draw in powerful attacks targeted at Jellicent. They can even draw in Sucker Punches so Jellicent can fire off attacks with impunity. In a similar vein, Lightningrod support from the likes of Marowak and Seaking lets Jellicent better stand up to foes such as Zapdos and Thundurus.</p>"

  "Galvantula": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Galvantula looks like a frail Bug-type. However, it gets two abilities that work well in VGC 2012. One of them is Unnerve, which makes the opponent's type resist Berries and status Berries useless; the other is Compoundeyes, which makes the accuracy of Thunder become a usable 91%. A great STAB combination of Bug and Electric lets Galvantula hit Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Latios with Bug Buzz, whereas other Electric-type Pokemon have to rely on Hidden Power Grass or Ice. However, that's just about all it gets; 70 / 60 / 60 defenses mean Galvantula is really frail, and base 97 Special Attack means its attacks aren't as powerful as one would think. To make matters worse, Galvantula's movepool is quite limited, necessitating the use of low Base Power moves, such as Energy Ball and Hidden Power, for coverage. While Galvantula can be a force to be reckoned with, don't expect it to take your opponents by storm.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sadly, Galvantula has a shallow movepool, so there isn't much else it can pull off without it being outclassed. Electroweb and Thunder Wave allow Galvantula to support the rest of its team by lowering the foe's Speed stat; however, this is better done by a bulky Pokemon, such as Cresselia. Discharge could be utilized along with a Ground-type Pokemon to hit both targets, but Thunder has more power and the same paralysis rate, and can be used even if a Ground-type isn't on the field. Swarm can be used, however even if Galvantula can get low enough HP to collect the Swarm boost it doesn't provide any significant KOs.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Terrakion 2HKOes Galvantula with Rock Slide (and OHKOes without Focus Sash). The same goes for Tyranitar, as it can take a Bug Buzz in sand and OHKO Galvantula with Rock Slide (even with Focus Sash, as the sand damage will finish the job). Zapdos and Volcarona can also take a Thunder, resist Bug Buzz, and OHKO with Heat Wave. Zapdos, however, must be wary of Hidden Power Ice. Trick Room is also a good way to deal with Galvantula, as its excellent Speed means it will probably be moving last. Additionally, Pokemon with Thunder Wave, such as Cresselia, can paralyze and cripple Galvantula. Lastly, Tornadus outspeeds Galvantula and can simply OHKO with Acrobatics. However, most faster Pokemon, such as Weavile and Latios, must be wary of Galvantula's coverage moves when switching in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<p>With its two STAB moves, Galvantula has nearly all the coverage it needs. Bug Buzz is great as it hits Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, Cresselia, and Tyranitar, as well as the Grass-type Pokemon that resist Thunderbolt, for super effective damage. Thunderbolt then hits Pokemon such as Politoed, Jellicent, and Gyarados for super effective damage. Hidden Power Ice hits Pokemon such as Gliscor and Landorus, which resist both its STABs, and as Unnerve takes care of their Yache Berries, Galvantula has a good chance to OHKO them. Protect is there to prevent unnecessary damage, and to let Galvantula avoid damage for a turn so its partner can take out a threat to it.</p> <p>A Timid nature allows Galvantula to Speed tie with the musketeer trio. Focus Sash lets Galvantula take a hit and attempt to KO back, which is especially useful against Tornadus, Latios, and Latias. Life Orb gives Galvantula a much needed power boost; however, it's incredibly frail, so a Focus Sash is usually the best item to use. Electric Gem also works well, giving Thunderbolt a chance to OHKO max specially defensive Politoed or Jellicent, as Unnerve nullifies their Wacan Berries. When using Unnerve, Thunderbolt must be used, as it will be much more accurate than Thunder.</p> <p>The choice of ability is up to what the team needs to accomplish. Compoundeyes increases the accuracy of Thunder, and also allows Galvantula to hit Pokemon such as Sand Veil Garchomp more accurately. Unnerve enables Galvantula to beat the likes of Wacan Berry Gyarados and Politoed, as well as to possibly OHKO Yache Berry Garchomp and Landorus with Hidden Power Ice. It also provides team support, as Galvantula's allies can now beat Chople Berry Tyranitar and Rindo Berry Gastrodon.</p> <p>Speaking of team support, Galvantula will appreciate a teammate to take care of Terrakion. Cresselia works well, as it can give Helping Hand boosts, use Icy Wind or Thunder Wave to deal with the likes of Tornadus and Latios, and take care of Terrakion with Psychic. A Pokemon that can stop Trick Room, such as Imprison Chandelure, works well with Galvantula; Chandelure can also take Heat Wave from the opponent thanks to Flash Fire. However, note that both of these Pokemon are weak to Rock Slide. Finally, Galvantula really appreciates rain support, as it weakens Fire-type attacks, and also grants Galvantula an accurate Thunder even when using Unnerve.</p>"

  "Eelektross": {
    "overview": "<p>Eelektross was one of the more popular VGC 2011 Pokemon, and it returns in the VGC 2012 metagame to reclaim this fame. It isn't hard to see why Eelektross was so popular; thanks to its ability, Levitate, Eelektross is immune to Ground-type attacks, meaning it has no weaknesses. This means that Eelektross can partner up with a Ground-type Pokemon to form the \"DisQuake\" combo. However, Eelektross is separated from other Electric-types not only because of its ability, but because of its great offensive stats. With base 115 Attack and 105 Special Attack, Eelektross is very unpredictable when it comes to what set it might have. It also has a great offensive movepool with physical attacks such as Acrobatics, Crunch, and Brick Break, and an even better special movepool with Flamethrower, Discharge, Hidden Power Ice, and Grass Knot, making Eelektross that much harder to predict. To make Eelektross even more intimidating, it has 85 / 80 / 80 defenses, which aren't bad when one considers that Eelektross has no weaknesses. However, that’s just about as good as Eelektross gets, as with only base 50 Speed, it finds it hard to use its offensive presence on the field. Trick Room fixes this to an extent, though it’s hard to rely on Trick Room alone for Eelektross to outspeed faster Pokemon. Moreover, thanks to Pokemon such as Zapdos being allowed in VGC 2012, Eelektross looks to be outclassed, as Zapdos and even Thundurus are faster and stronger on the special side, meaning that both are stronger competitive threats. However, don't underestimate the eel—it's beating the ground in anticipation of a fight.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Eelektross has decent base stats in each of its attacking areas to pull off a mixed set and have phenomenal coverage when doing so. However, using a mixed set limits Eelektross's available investment, which can be a huge turnoff. Choice Specs can be used to allow Eelektross to hit many of its normal counters quite hard. However, the use of Choice Specs means that Eelektross is outsped by many common threats, and having to deal with being locked into a non-spread attack can be very game-breaking if not played right. Rock Slide can be used on a physical set, but with lack of STAB and the weakening of spread moves, it can be very weak and underwhelming. Crunch can be used on a physical set as well, hitting Ghost- and Psychic-types—especially Chandelure and Cresselia—super effectively, which can otherwise annoy your team with Heat Wave or Icy Wind. Eelektross also has a vast majority of supporting moves that it can abuse such as Acid Spray, Light Screen, and Thunder Wave, but Eelektross is not bulky nor fast enough to pull off a supporting set better than Pokemon such as Murkrow, Sableye, and Cresselia, which are all great supporters that easily outclass Eelektross. Charge Beam can be used to collect Special Attack boosts, but setting up in VGC is next to impossible in the face of a skilled opponent. U-turn and Volt Switch can be used on attacking sets for easy switching, but can be flat-out wasted if the opponent Protects that turn, making more offensive options a better choice over wasting a slot for these kinds of moves. On a special set that is used on a rain team, Thunder can be used over Thunderbolt or Discharge for a stronger single-target hit attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The Special set is walled fairly easily by Rotom-H and bulky Rock- and Ground-types such as Tyranitar and Swampert, especially without Grass Knot. In fact, most Pokemon that are bulky physical attackers can KO Eelektross with little effort due to it lacking a solid option for beating them. Haxorus is a notable counter to Eelektross, as Mold Breaker nullifies the Levitate immunity and it is able to OHKO even with non-STAB Earthquake coming from its monstrous base 147 Attack. Faster hard-hitting attackers are just overall threatening to Eelektross. Even with no weaknesses thanks to Levitate, it's still not the bulkiest Pokemon around. Some rare, but possible, things to ruin Eelektross's Ground-type immunity are Gravity, Cofagrigus and Mummy, and Gastro Acid. Though uncommon, these options will still remove one of Eelektross's biggest benefits.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to the overall coverage this set provides, it's easy for Eelektross to nail common VGC 2012 threats hard. STAB Thunderbolt coming off of base 105 Special Attack is nothing to laugh at, and it hits key Pokemon in VGC 2012, such as Politoed and Suicune, hard. Alternatively, Discharge can be used if Eelektross is being partnered with a Ground-type Pokemon or a Telepathy partner, as it is a great spread move thanks to a 30% paralysis rate, potentially crippling Pokemon for the match. Flamethrower gives Eelektross much-needed coverage, as it allows it to hit the Grass-type Pokemon that resist Electric-type attacks, such as Amoonguss; it also nails Steel- and Ice-type Pokemon such as Scizor, Metagross, and Abomasnow. Hidden Power Ice is to make sure Dragon-type Pokemon, such as Haxorus and Garchomp, don't completely wall Eelektross, as well as retaining coverage against Ground-type Pokemon. Finally, Protect ensures that Eelektross won't take unnecessary damage, while Grass Knot can be used to hit heavy Pokemon such as Tyranitar.</p> <p>The EVs are obvious, giving Eelektross maximum overall bulk as well as maximum attacking strength, making it a decent tank as well. An EV spread of 160 HP / 252 SpA / 96 Spe can be used to outspeed 0 Spe Jellicent and Tyranitar, giving Eelektross the opportunity to KO with Thunderbolt on Jellicent or Grass Knot on Tyranitar. However, Eelektross loses some much-needed bulk, so you need to take that into consideration when deciding on the EV spread. A Speed IV of 0 in tandem with a Quiet nature can make Eelektross an excellent Trick Room abuser coming off of a base Speed of 50. Sitrus Berry is the preferred item, allowing Eelektross gain lost HP mid-battle. A Modest nature helps Eelektross hit as hard as possible.</p> <p>Eelektross doesn't have perfect coverage, walled by threats such as Rotom-H and Tyranitar (if lacking Grass Knot); to solve this issue, Eelektross can be paired with Pokemon such as Terrakion, Landorus, and Garchomp, which can defeat those two Pokemon. Garchomp and Landorus are especially good, as they can also allow Eelektross to fire off Discharge at will. Water- and Ground-types such as Gastrodon and Swampert are great assets, providing added coverage, easy Discharge use thanks to typing, and support to Eelektross in the form of Storm Drain and Wide Guard, respectively. Because Eelektross is painfully slow, Pokemon such as Togekiss, Tornadus, and Thundurus make great partners with support moves such as Tailwind or Thunder Wave to help Eelektross outrun more of the threats on the field. Togekiss is especially good as it can provide Follow Me support.</p>"

      "Physical": {
        "description": "<p>This set was fairly well-known in VGC 2011 and widely effective; in this VGC season, however, with almost every other Pokemon to choose from, it can be done better by so many other Pokemon, such as Tyranitar and Scizor. However, that doesn't mean this set is bad at all. Eelektross's most powerful STAB move is Wild Charge, dealing heavy damage with the only drawback being recoil. Flying Gem Acrobatics is an excellent combination that hits extremely hard against Pokemon that are weak to it. Brick Break allows Eelektross to gain coverage on more Pokemon, including Tyranitar and Terrakion. Dragon Claw could also be used instead for coverage against Dragon-type Pokemon such as Garchomp and Salamence. Protect is a standard go-to move for VGC.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes bulk on Eelektross as well as keeping Eelektross's damage output at a maximum with an Adamant nature. Like the special set, an alternative EV spread of 160 HP / 252 Atk / 96 Spe can be used to outspeed Pokemon such as 0 Spe Tyranitar and Jellicent. A Flying Gem is used in conjunction with Acrobatics to be used as a one-time shot to put dents in a variety of Pokemon. 0 Speed IVs, in conjunction with a Brave nature, can be used to allow Eelektross to function well under the influence of Trick Room.</p> <p>Bulky Rock- and Ground-types can easily take a Brick Break from Eelektross and some can even prevent the use of Wild Charge, such as Rhyperior or Marowak. To help with this, Eelektross can pair up with Water- and Ground-types such as Swampert and Gastrodon, which can use both of their STAB moves to get easy KOs on Rock- and Ground-types. Both can also pair with Eelektross to fire off Earthquakes at will thanks to Levitate. Grass-type Pokemon such as Venusaur and Ludicolo are also nice to have if your team abuses weather, as both can be very useful at taking out slow, bulky Rock- and Ground-types. Because Eelektross is painfully slow, Tailwind and Thunder Wave support are nice to have to help Eelektross outspeed and wreck the opposition.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Many people don't even consider Beheeyem for their team, as other Pokemon, such as Chandelure, Jellicent, and Cresselia, can do its job better. However, Beheeyem has a niche in the metagame due to Ally Switch. Moreover, its low HP and Defense stats mean it won't be taking as many hits as some other Pokemon. Don't be put off by these disadvantages, though, as Beheeyem has low Speed and high Special Attack, making it an exceptional Trick Room setter and supporter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With a Modest nature, you can outspeed other set-up users and use Imprison while still being slow enough to function under Trick Room. Thunderbolt is a great move that can take down common Flying- and Water-types. Simple Beam is risky and gimmicky, but is another option. Disable is also good to stop Bug Buzzes from Volcarona and other super effective moves. Another option is Energy Ball, which is a great move against Gastrodon. Hidden Power Fighting will allow you to hit Tyranitar hard. If you use Analytic over Telepathy, you will get a power boost by 30% if Beheeyem moves last in battle.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Scrafty can tear apart Beheeyem, as it is slow and strong under Trick Room, has STAB Crunch, and is immune to Psychic-type moves. Volcarona can OHKO it with Bug Buzz after a Quiver Dance. Tyranitar is also another threat, as it has access to STAB Crunch. Chandelure and Scizor can also tear apart Beheeyem with Shadow Ball and Bug Bite, respectively. Metagross doesn't care about Beheeyem's attacks too much, as it is relatively slow, bulky, and can crush it with a repeated Meteor Mash.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Setter": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Beheeyem's low Speed with Trick Room. Because Beheeyem is a Psychic-type, Psychic or Psyshock is a strong, reliable, STAB attack. With STAB Psychic and 52 EVs in Special Attack, there is a slight chance you can OHKO most Hitmontop. Ally Switch is what makes this set unique, allowing Beheeyem to switch places with your second Pokemon. It can potentially help partners weak to Fighting-type attacks, as no spread Fighting-type move currently exists. Beheeyem should always run Ally Switch, as otherwise Cresselia and other bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types completely outclass it. For the last slot, you can choose Shadow Ball to hit Chandelure, Cresselia, and other Psychic-types or Protect to salvage an extra turn. Mental Herb makes sure Trick Room is up unless the opponent uses Imprison or has a Sitrus Berry to let it live a little longer. Because Beheeyem has low HP, a 252 EV investment HP is necessary to withstand at least some attacks. Some EVs in Special Attack are vital to boost its powerful STAB attacks and KO Fighting-types, while 204 Special Defense further increases Beheeyem's ability to take hits. Telepathy is by far the best ability to use with it.</p> <p>252 HP and 204 Special Defense EVs allow Beheeyem to take a Shadow Ball from Reuniclus or Chandelure, set up Trick Room, and strike back. 52 Special Attack EVs allow it to have as much power as possible while also retaining its bulk. Mental Herb is very helpful due to the fact many Pokemon carry Taunt; however, Sitrus Berry allows Beheeyem to survive longer. Telepathy is one of the best aspects of this Pokemon, allowing it to avoid taking damage from the very common Surf, Earthquake, and Explosion when used from its partners. Because of this, Beheeyem can avoid wasting a turn Protecting during an Earthquake from an allied Rhyperior or Metagross and attack instead. Normal types, such as Snorlax, are great partners, as they take minimal damage from a Shadow Ball or Crunch, respectively.</p> <p>Scrafty pairs up great with Beheeyem; with Ally Switch, it can take Ghost- or Dark-type attacks and Beheeyem can take Fighting-Type attacks. Fake Out support makes it relatively easy to set up Trick Room. Also, with STAB Drain Punch and STAB Crunch, Scrafty can deal with Pokemon that are threats to Beheeyem, such as Chandelure. Hitmontop also has great synergy with Beheeyem; it has all of the same features of Scrafty except Dark-type STAB while also having access to Sucker Punch. Amoonguss and other Rage Powder or Follow Me users, such as Togekiss, can make it relatively easy to set up Trick Room.</p>"

Given this, you'd think everyone would be scrambling to put Haxorus in their teams. However, there are a few drawbacks to using it. Its odd base 97 Speed, decidedly average defenses, and shallow movepool don't give Haxorus much to work with, especially when most Dragon-types are faster than Haxorus. Its destructive potential is enough to overshadow these drawbacks however, warranting Haxorus a spot on any team willing to accommodate it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Haxorus's movepool isn't very deep, but there are a few things worth considering. Haxorus is one of the few Pokemon in VGC that is able to pull off a boosting set with either Swords Dance or Dragon Dance. The catch to using a boosting set is that it requires a turn to set up, more team support, and a moveslot, though Haxorus has decent coverage with Earthquake and Dragon Claw anyway. Substitute is risky, but if used right it allows Haxorus to evade status, and can be used to set up on a predicted Protect. Haxorus is bulky enough to forgo the use of a Focus Sash, though the option is always there if you don't trust your Haxorus to take a hit. Reversal and Endeavor pair well with Focus Sash, but Haxorus is still susceptible to priority moves and damaging weather. Night Slash hits Ghost-types harder than most of the moves Haxorus commonly uses, but beyond that, X-Scissor is more powerful and hits everything else that Night Slash covers. Dragon Gem boosts Outrage to a whopping 270 Base Power, which is sure to dent anything unfortunate enough to be on the receiving end. However, Haxorus usually has better items to hold, though again, taking a STAB Dragon Gem-boosted move from Haxorus is a frightening prospect indeed. Return is a usable 102 Base Power move, but it doesn't do much to help Haxorus's coverage. While it may be tempting to use a Jolly nature on any of Haxorus's sets—especially Choice Scarf—it doesn't outspeed anything notable besides neutral nature base 100 Speed Pokemon, and Haxorus's main draw is its power, which a Jolly nature detracts from.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As powerful as Haxorus is, its Achilles heel is most often its Speed. Faster Dragon-types, such as Latios and Salamence, will tear Haxorus limb from limb before it has a chance to respond, but they must be wary of Choice Scarf variants. Thanks to its Swift Swim ability, Kingdra can easily outrun Haxorus during pouring rain, but must use boosting items or Draco Meteor to guarantee a KO. Ferrothorn can take most of Haxorus's attacks with ease, and either take Haxorus out itself with Gyro Ball or cripple it with Thunder Wave. Usual defensive standbys Cresselia and Dusclops can't take an Outrage too well, but can survive and cripple Haxorus with Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp, respectively. Metagross is a sturdy defensive tank known for its ability to take even Excadrill's Earthquakes, and can beat down Haxorus with Bullet Punch, Meteor Mash, or Ice Punch. Pokemon with the Intimidate ability, such as Hitmontop, can soften up Haxorus for a teammate's retaliation attempt, but Haxorus's Attack stat is so colossal that even after an Attack drop its assaults will leave a mark. Hail teams, especially those with faster Ice-types, such as Weavile and Mamoswine, give Haxorus a hard time, though it can OHKO or 2HKO most Ice-types with Brick Break or Rock Slide.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>By equipping a Choice item, Haxorus can unleash the beast within and maul its usual checks with its awesome power. By holding a Choice Scarf, Haxorus outspeeds and KOes faster Dragon-types, such as Garchomp and Latios, before they can act, which gives Haxorus more room to switch in and out so it can switch moves. Choice Band makes Haxorus a bit more reliant on team support, but boosts its already potent 218 Attack to a massive 327, which allows Haxorus to 2HKO threats such as 140 HP Zapdos, specially defensive Cresselia, Dusclops, and Togekiss with Dragon Claw or Dual Chop. Outrage is even more destructive with a Choice Band, OHKOing each of the aforementioned threats even if they have not sustained much prior damage. Unfortunately, Outrage isn't all that reliable because it selects its target randomly, but any opponent hit, bar Steel-types, probably won't enjoy taking huge amounts of damage. Earthquake is a staple spread move, but unlike other Earthquake users, Mold Breaker allows Haxorus to hit Levitating Pokemon. This is of course a double-edged sword, as this affects your own Levitators as well. Rock Slide is another staple move, but you might find its paltry 56 Base Power unappealing. Haxorus also has access to Brick Break and X-Scissor, which can be used to hit the occasional Ice- and Steel-types and Grass- and Psychic-types, respectively.</p> <p>Dual Chop and Dragon Claw share the same 80 Base Power, though Dual Chop has a better chance to critical hit, and can hit through Substitutes, resist Berries, and Focus Sashes.However, Dual Chop has only 90% accuracy as opposed to Dragon Claw's 100%, and has higher chances of activating abilities such as Flame Body. The EV spread ensures that Haxorus outpaces neutral nature base 95 Speed Pokemon, such as Darmanitan, as well as Timid Smeargle. If you're concerned about opposing Haxorus, you can use a spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe to outspeed those with the standard spread.</p> <p>Choice Haxorus is more reliant on team support than other variants. Togekiss and Hitmontop spring to mind as good partners, either paralyzing and redirecting attacks or flinching the opponent and protecting Haxorus from Blizzard, respectively. Additionally, both Togekiss and Hitmontop have the option of boosting Haxorus's already devastating attacks to almost unimaginable heights with Helping Hand. Haxorus also appreciates having Zapdos or Thundurus as partners, as they are immune to its Earthquake, can support Haxorus with Tailwind or Thunder Wave and, in Zapdos's case, use Heat Wave to melt opposing Ice- and Steel-types. Feint, Taunt, Imprison, and Encore support is helpful to ensure that opponents don't Protect their vital Pokemon, ensuring a kill under Haxorus's claws. Because Haxorus might be switching in and out frequently to change its moves, it is important to have a Pokemon that can sponge, or is immune to, the attacks that Haxorus attracts. Shedinja, Ferrothorn, Suicune, and Rotom-W make great switch-ins, and the latter three can even slow down the opposition with Thunder Wave or Icy Wind.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Though this set lacks the extra power granted by a Choice Band, it gives Haxorus more freedom to use its moves, as well as being able to use different—and in some cases more useful—items. Haxorus is constantly threatened to be paralyzed or burned by common supporters, such as Zapdos, Cresselia, and Dusclops, and cannot KO them in time to avoid being statused. Lum Berry remedies this, giving Haxorus enough time to KO said threats, and emerge from the conflict relatively unscathed. Yache Berry is useful to help Haxorus check Ice-types more easily, and allows Haxorus to stand up to a surprise Ice Beam. Life Orb is of course a more offensive item, turning 2HKOs such as X-Scissor against Abomasnow into OHKOs at a cost of 10% of Haxorus's health for each successful hit. The first three moves are fairly self explanatory; reliable STAB, spread, and coverage moves make for a fairly standard physical attacking set. Protect is the recommended fourth move simply because it is 'exclusive' to non-Choice Haxorus, but a fourth attack can be used in Protect's place if needed.</p> <p>There are a few more things worth mentioning on a regular physical attacking set, namely Haban Berry and Taunt. Haban Berry allows Haxorus to check Dragon-types that would otherwise give it a hard time, and while Taunt may seem like a bad idea due to the prevalence of Mental Herb, it can still prove useful for foiling attempts to status Haxorus or set up Trick Room. Outrage is an option here as well, though it doesn't have the same hope-shattering power as the Choice Band set. The given EV spread allows a resist Berry to be used more effectively, while still letting Haxorus outspeed Timid Smeargle and neutral natured Excadrill outside sandstorm. If you're not using a resist Berry and don't hold much stock in Haxorus's defenses, a spread of 12 HP / 252 Atk / 244 Spe enables it to outspeed neutral base 95 Speed Pokemon.</p> <p>Being one of the slower Dragon-types, Haxorus naturally appreciates paralysis or Tailwind support. Whimsicott and Togekiss can provide both, as well as being resistant and immune to Earthquake, respectively. Zapdos and Thundurus supply paralysis and can check rain teams that give Haxorus a headache, and in Zapdos's case, provide Tailwind support as well. Hitmontop can flinch opposing Pokemon with Fake Out, soften blows with Intimidate, and check most Ice-types who can freeze Haxorus to the spot. Arcanine is in a similar boat, except it has access to STAB Flare Blitz and Heat Wave as well as the mighty ExtremeSpeed.</p>"

  "Accelgor": {
    "overview": "<p>Fast and frail, Accelgor tries to make the most of the short time it has. While Accelgor's offensive movepool isn't the best in its class, moves such as Final Gambit, Encore, and Acid Spray let it become extremely dangerous if underestimated. If you're looking for a Pokemon with some quick and dirty ways of harassing the opponent, Accelgor is the Pokemon for you.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As mentioned earlier, Hydration can be used. However, there are two issues: rain needs to be active, and it's only useful if Accelgor is afflicted with a status effect. Feint can be useful to provide a different way for Accelgor to punish those who Protect often, but it is illegal with Encore. Accelgor has a few other special attacks, such as Focus Blast, Giga Drain, and Hidden Power, making a special attacker set viable. If you plan to do this, it is suggested that Accelgor run a Modest nature with an EV spread of 20 HP / 252 SpA / 236 Spe and hold either a Life Orb or Focus Sash. Lastly, due to its high Speed, Accelgor can use Rain Dance to set up for a rain team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Due to Final Gambit and Encore, Accelgor is a Pokemon that should be handled with caution. Ghost-type Pokemon such as Chandelure and Jellicent are unaffected by Final Gambit; they can either hit Accelgor back hard or set up Trick Room, both of which will put Accelgor in a tight spot. Pokemon with priority moves, such as Metagross and Scizor, can remove the danger of Final Gambit by striking Accelgor first. Lastly, users of Choice Scarf, such as Garchomp, Rotom-A, and Terrakion, can surprise Accelgor by outrunning the bug and crippling it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Final Gambit": {
        "description": "<p>Final Gambit provides Accelgor with a niche role on a team by outrunning and going kamikaze on bulky targets. This allows a team to have a quick answer to Pokemon such as Ferrothorn or Garchomp. Bug Buzz allows Accelgor to attack without sacrificing itself; with a Bug Gem boost, it OHKOes Latios and deals sizable amounts of damage to many other Pokemon. Encore allows Accelgor to disrupt the opponents. Because Accelgor is faster than many of the Pokemon in the metagame, it can make the opponent think twice about using Protect. Alternatively, Acid Spray can be used; it allows Accelgor to support special attackers by halving the opponent's Special Defense and breaking Focus Sashes. Lastly, Protect allows Accelgor to defend itself from the opponent's attacks and scout for priority attacks.</p> <p>Accelgor's EVs first go into maximizing its HP to improve the usefulness of Final Gambit. 36 Speed EVs allow Accelgor to hit 187 Speed, which lets it outrun Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Abomasnow, in addition to any Pokemon with base 115 Speed or less. The remainder is placed into Special Attack to strengthen Bug Buzz. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 108 SpA / 148 Spe can be used to allow Accelgor to outrun positive-natured base 130 Speed Pokemon, and positive-natured Choice Scarf base 70 Speed Pokemon. Unburden allows Accelgor to invest less in Speed and invest more in bulk or its Special Attack while still allowing it to take advantage of its huge Speed and outspeed plenty of the common threats.</p> <p>When using Accelgor for Final Gambit, Fake Out partners, such as Hitmontop or Infernape, are effective as they can flinch one opponent while Accelgor uses Final Gambit on the other, or force a Protect that Accelgor can lock down with Encore. Users of Follow Me, Rage Powder, and Quick Guard, such as Togekiss, Amoonguss, and Terrakion, respectively, can also help in ensuring that Accelgor doesn't get sniped by priority moves before it can attack. Accelgor works well with Heatran, as it can take out major threats such as Chandelure and Scizor; in return, Accelgor can take out foes that threaten Heatran by using Final Gambit. If Accelgor is running Acid Spray, Pokemon such as Latios, Thundurus, and Choice Scarf Abomasnow become good partners, as very few Pokemon will be able to survive a special attack at -2 Special Defense. Lastly, other fast sweepers, such as Garchomp and Terrakion, are effective as they allow you to continue to place pressure on the opponent's team.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Mienshao might appear to be another run-of-the-mill Fighting-type Fake Out user, but upon closer inspection, it has a few key moves let it stand out from the crowd. Access to Wide Guard lets it offer team support, the ability Inner Focus grants it protection from faster Fake Out users such as Weavile, and its base 125 Attack gives it significant offensive potential. When using Mienshao, however, bear in mind that there are many other competent Fake Out users, so be sure to play to Mienshao's unique strengths.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mienshao doesn't have many more tricks up its sleeve, but there are certainly a few worth mentioning. If you want Mienshao to stick around longer than when using Wide Guard, Detect is a viable move. Knock Off and Feint are situational moves, but an Eviolite-less Dusclops or an Abomasnow that can't Protect itself makes for a good match-up. Mixed or purely special sets with Aura Sphere and Hidden Power Ice could be usable, hitting Dragon-types and Gliscor super effectively. U-turn can help get a teammate in safely while renewing your Fake Out, and can work well with Regenerator. Speaking of Regenerator, it also helps keep your Focus Sash operational; if you expect your opponent to forgo using Fake Out in fear of Inner Focus, it is the best ability to use. Mienshao gets anti-weather options in the form of Sunny Day and Rain Dance, but it is better off being paired with another Pokemon that needs Mienshao's support to set up the respective weather, such as Zapdos.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Mienshao despises bulkier Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Dusclops, as it cannot do enough damage to 2HKO either before getting crippled by Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp, or even flat out OHKOed by Psychic. Flying-types such as Tornadus and Crobat give Mienshao heartburn, but they can be hit hard by Rock Slide. Metagross can KO Mienshao with a combination of Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch, but will take a lot of damage from Low Kick. Anything that can outspeed Mienshao and packs a reasonably strong STAB or super effective move is instantly a threat. Examples of this are Blaziken after a Speed Boost, Chople Berry Terrakion, and Starmie. Trick Room gives Mienshao nightmares, so when running a Trick Room team, it's best to have a solid attacking lead such as Scrafty or Chandelure when going up against a Mienshao.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Attacking Support": {
        "description": "<p>Mienshao's quirky movepool allows it to play a surprisingly effective offensive-support hybrid role. Wide Guard and Fake Out are great together, and form the supportive core of Mienshao's moveset. Flying Gem in tandem with Acrobatics allows Mienshao to KO other Fighting-types with ease, save for Focus Sash users and max HP Intimidate Hitmontop, to whom it does a crippling 96% maximum. If you want Mienshao on the field a little longer, Focus Sash is appreciated. Mienshao unfortunately does not receive moves such as Close Combat, and thus has to rely on Low Kick for its main STAB move. While Low Kick hits most of its targets hard, Politoed and Ninetales are exceptions, so Drain Punch is an alternative if you need more assurance against the two. Keep in mind, however, that Drain Punch misses out on the OHKO on Terrakion and Abomasnow, as well as the guaranteed OHKO on Chople Berry Tyranitar.</p> <p>If you want more power and consistency, Hi Jump Kick is the next best move Mienshao has to offer, OHKOing the aforementioned Chople Tyranitar 80% of the time and Ninetales and Politoed 100% of the time with minimal prior damage, which can be provided with Fake Out. Hi Jump Kick comes with a nasty drawback however; it chips off half of Mienshao's health if it misses or gets blocked by Protect.</p> <p>Pokemon that can take advantage of protection from Rock Slide and other spread moves appreciate Mienshao's support; Pokemon that can ward off Psychic- and Ghost-types also make excellent teammates. Such Pokemon include Chandelure, Metagross, and Yanmega. Hail teams love Wide Guard support and a check to Fighting-type Acrobatics users, roles that Mienshao can perform admirably. Sun teams also enjoy Wide Guard, and the absence of damaging weather makes Focus Sash a viable alternative.</p>"

  "Druddigon": {
    "overview": "<p>Druddigon certainly stands out from its Dragon-type brethren. The main reason for this is its sluggish base 48 Speed, the lowest of any fully evolved Dragon-type, making it optimal for a Trick Room team. Even though its movepool is relatively shallow, with no Draco Meteor-esque move to strike fear into the hearts of the populace, but it does have two moves its scaly cousins would beg to have: Sucker Punch and Superpower. Resistances to Fire and Water, combined with chip damage in the form of Rough Skin, mean that Druddigon also has acceptable defenses; however, its dependency on Trick Room also gives it a rough time against its Dragon kin, and if your opponent has methods to prevent Trick Room, Druddigon will be fighting an uphill battle.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Druddigon may have a shallow movepool, but that doesn't mean it's lacking in good moves. Fire Fang is the only other Fire move Druddigon has outside of Flamethrower, but it's still rather weak and can't hit two Pokemon at once, unlike Rock Slide. Nonetheless, Fire Fang is still a viable option if you're plagued by Ferrothorn. Sunny Day is situational, but it removes hail — and by extension the threat of Blizzard —from the field. Outrage is risky as its target is random, but the 120 Base Power is very appealing compared to Dragon Claw's 80. Crunch is a good move, though outclassed by Sucker Punch. If you want Druddigon to hit supporters such as Cresselia more reliably, it's still an option considering supporters are less likely to attack. Mold Breaker is a solid ability by itself, but on Druddigon it is fairly outclassed by it's other abilities.</p> <p>Lum Berry is a more defensive item Druddigon can use; it protects Druddigon from burns and sleep—and to a lesser extent confusion—from common supporters such as Amoonguss and Dusclops. It can even form a Swagger-Lum combination with numerous Pokemon. If you want a guaranteed OHKO on Garchomp and Salamence without Life Orb recoil, a Dragon Gem can cater to your needs, though it's only good for one use. Dark Gem can be used in a similar manner, OHKOing Latios or simply doing more damage without Life Orb recoil.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Cold-blooded creatures notoriously hate winter or other cold conditions, and Druddigon is certainly no exception. Abomasnow is as big of a threat as ever, as it tears through any Druddigon with its mighty Blizzard, and doesn't mind Trick Room as much as Druddigon's other nemeses. Mamoswine is another troubling opponent for Druddigon as it can use Ice Shard to bypass Trick Room, though it and Abomasnow don't like taking Superpower. Dusclops can avoid being hit by Sucker Punch by using Will-O-Wisp, and from then on shrug off Druddigon's feeble attempts to do damage before succumbing to burn or Night Shade. Cresselia can also cripple Druddigon by removing Trick Room, and has Ice Beam to damage it if need be. Ferrothorn gives Druddigon a taste of its own medicine with Iron Barbs and its unbreakable defenses, whittling away its HP with Leech Seed while it fails to do damage with a progressively weaker Superpower. Stalling out Trick Room is probably your best bet if your team lacks all the above Pokemon or moves, especially if you have a Dragon of your own. Intimidate is a big help here as it makes sure Druddigon doesn't KO your Pokemon before it's too late, but at the same time, you should make its Trick Room supporter public enemy number one. Gyarados has access to Taunt and Intimidate, making it an excellent candidate for the job; it can possibly also flinch the supporter with Waterfall.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Like most Trick Room attackers, Druddigon aims to be as slow, powerful, and bulky as possible. Dragon Claw is Druddigon's main STAB move and can usually secure a 2HKO or OHKO on other Dragon-types if Druddigon is holding a Life Orb. Sucker Punch is another of Druddigon's main selling points, as the priority allows it to hit first outside of Trick Room; this is something Druddigon may have to do from time to time, as most teams are prepared for Trick Room. The third slot is mostly coverage, but you can't go wrong with Rock Slide's ability to hit Ice- and Flying-types and 47% chance to flinch at least one Pokemon. Superpower still hits Ice-types and in most cases OHKOes Tyranitar, which can otherwise be a major problem for your Psychic- or Ghost-types. Earthquake is a slightly more powerful spread move, though it requires your partner to have Levitate, a Flying-typing, or to use Protect in order to avoid friendly fire. Protect is mainly filler, but it allows Druddigon to avoid damage while its partner sets up Trick Room if need be.</p> <p>A Life Orb is required for a clean OHKO on Garchomp and Salamence (factoring in Intimidate) a clean OHKO on Latios with Sucker Punch. However, it undermines Druddigon's bulk and leaves Druddigon open to the likes of Haban Berry Kingdra. A simple fix to this is to equip it with its own Haban Berry, which enables it to survive an attack and reliably 2HKO (or in some cases OHKO after Rough Skin damage if they use Dragon Claw) other Dragons. Similar protection can be offered by Yache Berry, buying it time to fire off Superpower or consecutive Rock Slides.</p> <p>Being a Trick Room sweeper, Druddigon naturally requires Trick Room support. Bronzong is the best user type-wise as it resists Ice- and Dragon-type moves while Druddigon resists Fire-type moves; with proper prediction, this allows Druddigon to enter the battlefield relatively unscathed. Of course, Druddigon isn't picky about where its support comes from, so Pokemon such as Cresselia, Chandelure, Dusclops, and Jellicent can all work as Trick Room supporters. It is also important to support your Trick Room users with Pokemon such as Scrafty, Hariyama, Amoonguss, and Clefable. If you can manage it, Druddigon appreciates Helping Hand support to further boost the destructive potential of Sucker Punch and Dragon Claw. Not only can Gallade provide Trick Room and Helping Hand support, it can attack alongside Druddigon and check Steel- and Ice-types such as Ferrothorn and Rotom-F with its choice of Fighting-type move.</p>"

  "Bisharp": {
    "overview": "<p>Bisharp is a Pokemon with many draws—it possesses high Attack and Defense and has quite a few resistances as a result of its Steel typing. Moreover, its Speed allows it to function both in and out of Trick Room. Bisharp is lucky to possess the second-strongest Sucker Punch in the game as well as Defiant, a rare ability that raises Bisharp's Attack two stages when a stat is lowered, allowing it to gain Attack from Intimidate. However, Bisharp is not without its flaws; its typing gives it an enormous weakness to Fighting-type moves and, in tandem with its movepool, also curses it with STAB moves that have low base power.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Brick Break is the best move that Bisharp has against Steel-types, but ends up feeling weak in the end. Swords Dance makes Bisharp incredibly strong, but takes up a turn. Substitute can punish double Protects, among other things. Taunt can be used to stop Trick Room and Spore as well as other status moves, while forcing your opponent to use an attacking move, allowing Bisharp pull off a guaranteed Sucker Punch. Guillotine is a last resort move in situations where Bisharp will lose no matter what unless it hits. Steel Gem allows Bisharp to hit harder with Iron Head, Chople Berry allows Bisharp to survive Hitmontop's Mach Punch, and Focus Sash can do the same as the latter, but is made useless by Fake Out or Hail. Life Orb allows Bisharp to do great damage to whatever it hits at the cost of HP every turn. Inner Focus can be used to avoid the flinch from Fake Out, but will not work against users of Hitmontop. Against Hitmontop with Intimidate, Bisharp with Inner Focus will not have Defiant activated in response to Intimidate, so the Hitmontop user can reasonably conclude that Bisharp has Inner Focus. Technician Hitmontop does not need to use Fake Out against Bisharp and can just use Mach Punch for an OHKO assuming Bisharp does not hold a Chople Berry or Focus Sash. Bisharp can use Pressure, but it's other awesome abilities outclass it completely in usefulness.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Because Bisharp relies on a priority Sucker Punch to attack, any Pokemon that is faster than Bisharp that resists Sucker Punch is immediately a threat. Pokemon such as Terrakion and Infernape are prime examples, as both Pokemon are resistant to Sucker Punch and can OHKO Bisharp with their STAB attacks. Terrakion even has Justified, meaning it gains an Attack boost from a Sucker Punch. Bulky Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Krookodile also make great counters, as they can use their STAB attacks to beat Bisharp. Hydreigon and Heatran only fear a Brick Break and both can retaliate with a Fire Blast. If you don't have a Dark-type resist to beat Bisharp, don't worry; any Pokemon with decent bulk and a super effective attack can beat Bisharp. Zapdos and Garchomp can use Heat Wave and Earthquake, respectively, to rack up damage on Bisharp, eventually beating it. Lastly, any Pokemon with the move Substitute can use it on a Sucker Punch, making it easier to defeat Bisharp.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<p>Sucker Punch is Bisharp's most useful move and allows it to OHKO many things that have weaknesses to it—both Chandelure and Latios are felled in one hit, for example. Night Slash provides a more reliable STAB move and Iron Head hits most things that resist Dark-type moves for at least neutral damage; it is also notable in its ability to KO 4 / 0 Toxicroak in tandem with Sucker Punch outside of Rain. Protect, which is useful to keep Bisharp alive while its teammate moves, is a move that fits onto every VGC Pokemon; Bisharp is but one of many that benefit from it.</p> <p>Dark Gem is the item of choice and allows Bisharp to maim something with Sucker Punch the first time it uses it. Sitrus Berry is also an acceptable item, as it restores a quarter of Bisharp's health when it loses more than half of its HP. The EVs and nature make Bisharp hit as hard as possible while giving it maximum bulk. 4 more Speed EVs can be added to ensure that Bisharp outspeeds Hitmontop and Metagross; similarly, a Brave nature and a 0 IV in Speed can be used to go before them in Trick Room. Rage Powder users, especially the hardy Amoonguss, are great because they can draw away Fighting-type moves. Chandelure pairs fantastically with Bisharp; while both are weak to Ground-type moves, Chandelure can switch in on Fighting- and Fire-type moves, set up Trick Room against faster teams, and KO the Steel-types that trouble Bisharp. Levitating or Flying-type Pokemon such as Latios discourage the opponent from using Earthquake to KO Bisharp. Psycho Cut can be used over Protect in order to OHKO Toxicroak and do more damage to Fighting-types than Iron Head does.</p>"

  "Bouffalant": {
    "overview": "<p>Bouffalant is one of those Pokemon that are hardly ever seen in the VGC 2012 metagame. It has three advantages over other Normal-types: high Attack, a strong STAB, and two amazing abilities. Bouffalant's bulk isn't lacking either; 95 / 95 /95 defenses are quite good. Unfortunately, its Normal typing leaves it with a weakness to Fighting-types, one of the most common types in the VGC metagame. Bouffalant's Speed also isn't anything to write home about, but that's just a small defect that can be used to Bouffalant's advantage with Trick Room support. You are probably thinking, \"Why would I use Bouffalant over Snorlax?\" The answer lies in Bouffalant's abilities: Reckless and Sap Sipper. Sap Sipper gives Bouffalant a useful immunity to Grass-type moves, as well as an Attack boost when hit by one. This helps Bouffalant against Spore users such as Amoonguss. However, this does not mean that Bouffalant outclasses Snorlax, as Snorlax has its own useful traits. All in all, Bouffalant is a decent Pokemon that can fit nicely onto any team that needs a strong physical attacker.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Normal Gem can be used to increase Head Charge's damage output once. If you do not want to use Bouffalant on a Trick Room team, an Adamant nature should be used over a Brave nature; keep in mind though that Bouffalant works best on a Trick Room team. Megahorn can be used over Wild Charge for better coverage against Grass-, Psychic-, and Dark-type such as such as Whimsicott, Cresselia, and Hydreigon, respectively, but you will lose super effective coverage against Water-type Pokemon. Iron Head is an option if you're looking for coverage against Ice- and Rock-types. A Chople Berry can allow Bouffalant to survive one hit from a Fighting-type, such as Hitmontop and Terrakion. A Sitrus Berry can be used to heal Bouffalant's health, as Head Charge's recoil will often bring Bouffalant's HP down. A Choice Band can be used for immediate power, but being locked into a move can be a huge headache. Swords Dance is a viable option thanks to Bouffalant's good bulk, and a +2 Head Charge will severely damage almost every Pokemon in the VGC metagame. Bouffalant has access to Taunt, which can stop slower Pokemon such as Reuniclus from setting up Trick Room. However, Bouffalant is too slow to stop faster opponents from setting up Tailwind or paralyzing a teammate.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Hitmontop is an amazing counter to Bouffalant; Intimidate cuts Bouffalant's Attack stat, while its Fighting typing allows it to hit Bouffalant super effectively with a STAB Close Combat and possibly OHKO if it isn't carrying a Chople Berry. Likewise, many other Fighting-types, such as Terrakion, stop Bouffalant's dreams of sweeping by OHKOing it with a STAB move. Sableye can cause quite a lot of problems for Bouffalant by burning it with priority Will-O-Wisp; it is also immune to Bouffalant's STAB Head Charge. Rock- and Steel-types, such as Metagross and Heatran, can take Bouffalant's STAB moves with ease, but they must be wary of Earthquake. Strong offensive Pokemon, such as Electric Gem Zapdos, can quickly dispose of Bouffalant before it gets a chance to hit back. Thanks to its low Speed stat, Conkeldurr is a major threat to Bouffalant, as it can easily OHKO Bouffalant with STAB Drain Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Due to its low Speed stat and high Attack, Bouffalant's only viable set is that of a physical Trick Room attacker. Head Charge is a powerful STAB which hits everything that doesn't resist it for large amounts of damage. Wild Charge provides super effective coverage against Water- and Flying-types, such as Politoed and Tornadus. Earthquake hits Steel-types, such as Metagross, that resist Head Charge. Because Earthquake affects everything on the field, use it with caution to avoid damaging your own Pokemon. Rock Slide is a weaker alternative over Earthquake which only hits opposing Pokemon and has a nifty flinch rate. Lastly, Protect is used mainly for scouting purposes and to avoid Fake Out. It is also used to shield Bouffalant from damage on the turn its teammate attempts to set up Trick Room.</p> <p>The EVs are quite simple: they give Bouffalant as much Attack as possible while maxing out HP to give some bulk, also making sure it takes less from its recoil moves. A Brave nature increases Bouffalant's Attack and reduces its Speed, which makes it faster when Trick Room is up. There are two options for Bouffalant's ability: Sap Sipper and Reckless. Sap Sipper gives Bouffalant an immunity to Grass-type moves, as well as an Attack boost when hit by one, allowing it to easily switch into Amoonguss's Spore. Reckless, on the other hand, gives Bouffalant's recoil moves a nice power boost. Life Orb is the preferred item as it gives Bouffalant a much-needed power boost, but decreases Bouffalant's longevity. Teammates that can set up Trick Room, such as Cresselia, are essential because, without Trick Room up, Bouffalant is not much of a threat. Fighting-types that work well in Trick Room, such as Conkeldurr and Hariyama, are good teammates to have, as they can take out Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon that trouble Bouffalant. Ghost-types such as Dusclops and Sableye are also very good teammates because they can burn opponents that threaten Bouffalant. Chandelure is a good teammate as it can both provide support with Trick Room and take down Pokemon that trouble Bouffalant, such as Cresselia, Sableye, and Steel-types (bar Heatran).</p>"

  "Durant": {
    "overview": "<p>When you think of Durant, you think of that one annoying Pokemon that appears on Victory Road. However, it is much more than that; Durant is one of the most underrated Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame. With the right support and effective play, Durant can be one of the most unexpected threats in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If running the Hustle set, Faint Attack can be considered. While it has 20 less Base Power than Crunch and no secondary effect to lower Defense, it is guaranteed to hit. Also, with Hustle, Durant can use Hone Claws, though it is tricky to pull off due to its overall frailty. Stone Edge has less accuracy and lacks the damage spread of Rock Slide, but it's still powerful enough to be considered. Thunder Fang is also an option, but Rock Slide is generally the better move for getting rid of Flying-types. Durant can also use a Choice Scarf or Choice Band with Hustle for extra Speed or power, respectively. If you're still having issues with the accuracy loss, Wide Lens can be an option, but Focus Sash is the safer and generally better choice. Durant can use it's ability Truant to some success with the use of the move Entrainment.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Heatran, Infernape, Blaziken, Conkeldurr, Hariyama, and Lucario take minimal damage from Durant's STAB attacks and take neutral damage from the rest of its moves; they can then take Durant down to its Focus Sash and KO it the next turn with ExtremeSpeed, Mach Punch, or another priority move. Nearly anything with a high Special Attack stat will knock Durant down to its Focus Sash with a neutral move, and Durant's awkward base 109 Speed stat means that special attackers such as Latios, Latias, and Thundurus will easily outspeed it. Priority attacks, such as Scizor's Bullet Punch, and hail will also KO Durant after its Focus Sash is activated. If Durant cannot knock out a Trick Room user, Trick Room teams will walk all over it. Defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and most Steel-type Pokemon will cause trouble, although Durant can hit Metagross and Scizor neutrally for respectable damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Durant's power and potential vary depending upon which ability you use; with Hustle, it gets a free Attack boost at the cost of a drop in accuracy, negating the effects of Intimidate. With Swarm, Durant's Attack is still respectable, but the only move that receives a boost when Durant's Focus Sash activates is X-Scissor. Iron Head is Durant's best STAB move, as it has a chance to flinch an opponent. Its other aforementioned STAB move, X-Scissor, can do massive damage to many common VGC 2012 Pokemon such as Latios, Tyranitar, Cresselia, Ludicolo, and many others. While Rock Slide is risky with Hustle, it gives trouble to most of Durant's counters, such as Chandelure and Volcarona. A set with Hustle should use Crunch in the last moveslot because attacking prowess is necessary, but a set with Swarm always appreciates survivability, so Protect is the alternative option.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is necessary in order to outspeed common threats such as Terrakion, Garchomp, Zapdos, and other fast Pokemon. 252 EVs are put into both Attack and Speed to emphasize Durant's two best stats, and the remaining 4 EVs are put in Defense due to Durant's naturally high Defense.</p> <p>Almost any Fake Out user, such as Hitmontop, Infernape, and Toxicroak, can allow Durant to hit faster opponents, such as Latios, Ludicolo, and Thundurus, on the first turn that the teammate is sent out. Gastrodon helps Durant tremendously by absorbing most Water-type moves that would normally deal massive damage due to Durant's extremely low Special Defense, and Chandelure gets rid of most of the Steel-types that give Durant a lot of trouble. Other Pokemon with Flash Fire can be considered, but Chandelure is the best at the job. A partner that can use Telekinesis or Gravity is useful if Durant is using Hustle in order to alleviate the accuracy loss. Partners that can use Helping Hand will make sure that Durant gets an extra boost in Attack even without using Hustle. Fighting-type partners are also good as they take out the Steel-type Pokemon that wall Durant.</p>"

  "Hydreigon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hydreigon certainly looks like something that would tear you limb from limb, and one glance at that massive 125 Special Attack should leave no doubt in your mind that it is capable of doing so. Although its Draco Meteor is slightly weaker than Latios's and its Speed is lacking, Hydreigon boasts STAB Dark Pulse to eliminate dangerous support Pokemon such as Cresselia and the powerful Fire Blast, while Latios has to rely on non-STAB Shadow Ball and the significantly weaker Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>Even in light of its perks, however, Hydreigon is in constant danger of being dispatched by faster Pokemon that can take advantage of its Fighting- and Dragon-type weaknesses due to its awkward base 98 Speed, and it also runs the risk of being outclassed by older Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Latios. When using Hydreigon, it is important to use it for what its competitors cannot do.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hydreigon's special movepool doesn't extend very far beyond the listed options, but it does get Focus Blast, Earth Power, and Charge Beam. Focus Blast is great for dealing with Tyranitar, but that's really all you'd cover with it. Earth Power is unfortunately illegal with Dark Pulse, but it can still hit Steel-types and Tyranitar. Hydreigon can also use Charge Beam, but it is an unreliable and slow way of boosting. Hydreigon has a fairly large physical movepool which includes Acrobatics, Rock Slide, Earthquake, and Crunch, and a respectable base 105 Attack with which to abuse it. Unfortunately, it does not get Dragon Claw, and will have to use the unreliable Outrage or Dragon Rush for physical Dragon-type STAB. A mixed set consisting of Draco Meteor / Crunch / Fire Blast is also viable, but as with a purely physical option, isn't as destructive as the main set. Choice sets are very attractive, but they are generally outclassed by Latios, who can do the same thing with higher Speed and Special Attack, although it misses out on Fire Blast. Surf, while considerably weaker than Fire Blast due to the doubles power drop, can still be used to take advantage of a teammate's Water Absorb, Storm Drain, or Absorb Bulb, while dealing decent chunks of damage to the opposing Pokemon. Chople Berry is good against Pokemon such as Infernape and Terrakion, but Hydreigon needs all the power it can get.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Latios and Terrakion make Hydreigon stop in its tracks, as they are both faster and can OHKO it with powerful STAB attacks; the latter can even switch in on Dark Pulse and get an Attack boost. In the sand, Tyranitar can take Hydreigon's attacks fairly well and can strike back with Low Kick or Superpower. Opposing rain teams give Hydreigon trouble as the opponent is likely carrying more than one Pokemon with Ice Beam. Hail teams pose similar issues, though Abomasnow has to watch out for Flamethrower. Fast and powerful Bug-types such as Volcarona and Yanmega can threaten Hydreigon with STAB Bug Buzz, though Yanmega needs to be careful not to get hit by any of Hydreigon's moves because of its meager Special Defense.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Oftentimes, Hydreigon's main role in a team is to hit hard off its Special Attack, and this set is its best bet for doing so. Dark Pulse is the move you're probably going to fire off most often, 2HKOing even max Special Defense Eviolite Dusclops 85% of the time when using a Timid nature, and 100% of the time when Modest. Draco Meteor is the main option due to its sheer power; while Dragon Pulse is an alternative if you don't like the Special Attack drop, the drop in power is very noticeable. Fire Blast is Hydreigon's best coverage move, allowing Hydreigon to perform admirably in sun. Under the sun, Fire Blast destroys even max Special Defense Bronzong and deals a minimum of 87% to 252 HP Occa Berry Metagross. Speaking of Fire Blast, if you don't like the 85% accuracy, you can always use Flamethrower. While it misses out on a little more power, Life Orb Flamethrower can still 2HKO Occa Metagross and max Special Defense Amoonguss. Protect is fairly self-explanatory as it keeps Hydreigon safe from Mach Punches, Draco Meteors, and Ice Shards.</p> <p>The EVs are fairly straightforward, but if you're not concerned about opposing max Speed Hydreigon, you can use a spread of 12 HP / 252 SpA / 244 Spe which, along with a Timid nature, allows you to outpace Jolly Haxorus. Modest Hydreigon must run max Speed in order to outpace neutral-natured Haxorus, but if you're also not concerned with Haxorus, you can use a spread of 56 HP / 252 SpA / 200 Spe for both Timid and Modest in order to outpace base 90 Pokemon such as Lucario. Defensive items such as Haban Berry and Focus Sash are perfectly acceptable, but unless you invest heavily in your defenses, resist berries rarely do much good. For example, Life Orb or Dragon Gem Latios will KO Hydreigon right through its Haban Berry.</p> <p>Due to its awkward Speed tier, Hydreigon loves paralysis support; Prankster Thunder Wave and Stun Spore from Thundurus and Whimsicott are especially good choices. Pokemon that are capable of taking on Fighting-types are also a huge help. Cresselia, a solid option, can provide Thunder Wave support as well. Tailwind support is also welcome, but most of the Pokemon that set it up share an Ice-type weakness with Hydreigon, so you may have to take a few measures to stop hail teams, such as Wide Guard Fighting-types or a reliable Fire-type, in addition to using Fire Blast.</p>"

  "Terrakion": {
    "overview": "<p>While Terrakion was one of the best and most common sweepers in VGC 2011, many new checks and counters to it have risen in VGC 2012. Despite this, Terrakion retains its title as a top-tier threat in VGC play. Terrakion possesses several key qualities that many other Pokemon would die for, the most obvious being its brilliant dual STABs: a strong Rock Slide puts the hurt on both opponents, while Close Combat can badly hurt a single opponent. Together, they form a STAB combo that is resisted by only a few Pokemon. Complementing this is Terrakion's towering Attack stat, high Speed, and decent bulk, which enables it to survive most neutral attacks. However, said bulk is compromised by Terrakion's many common weaknesses, most notably to Fighting-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks. Consequently, there are many common Pokemon that threaten it, particularly as all forms of weather run rampant in VGC 2012. Team support thus becomes even more important this year, as it helps Terrakion overcome its many counters and lets it reach its full potential.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Chople Berry is an option to provide protection against the common Fighting-types attacks that could otherwise OHKO Terrakion; it is also a good choice if Terrakion's teammates are already holding Focus Sash and Life Orb. Terrakion can use a Choice Band for extra power, but its many weaknesses make this less appealing, as Choice Band means that it can’t effectively utilize Protect or the Speed provided by Choice Scarf to overcome its checks and counters. Finally, Lum Berry is another option to remove paralysis, burn, and sleep, all of which severely cripple Terrakion.</p> <p>Sacred Sword is an option to avoid Close Combat's defense drops while ignoring defensive boosts, though the latter effect will rarely be utilized. Close Combat is usually the superior move choice due to its raw power. Stone Edge deals significantly more damage to one foe than Rock Slide does, but Rock Slide is generally more useful as it hits both targets, has superior accuracy, and has a good flinch rate. Stone Edge can be used in conjunction with Rock Slide if you're willing to give up a coverage attack, though. Safeguard is useful against Amoonguss and slow, bulky Ghost-types that might use Will-O-Wisp and take little damage from Terrakion's attacks, but Terrakion is usually better off just attacking other status-inducing foes. Taunt can disrupt your opponent's strategy, and Terrakion has the Speed to pull it off, but Pokemon with the ability Prankster can utilize the move better. Taunt's best use is against Trick Room users, but if they're not Porygon2 or Dusclops, they might be holding a Mental Herb, rendering Taunt useless. Terrakion also gets Helping Hand, but it is usually better off attacking than giving a teammate a power boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Despite Terrakion's solid offensive typing, it has a large number of checks and counters. Amoonguss can shrug off whatever Terrakion uses and put it to sleep with Spore, or even hit it hard with a super effective Giga Drain. Any moderately bulky Ghost-type without a weakness to Rock Slide, such as Jellicent, Dusclops, Dusknoir, or Golurk, completely wall Terrakion. In return, they can either hit Terrakion hard with their super effective attacks or cripple it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Fighting-types that can take a Close Combat are also effective counters. Hitmontop is arguably the best counter to any Terrakion without Quick Guard, as it can possibly KO Terrakion with the combination of Life Orb- and Technician-boosted Fake Out and Mach Punch, both of which bypass Terrakion's superior Speed. Alternatively, it can lower Terrakion's Attack with Intimidate instead while still dealing good damage with its Fighting-type STABs. Conkeldurr and Toxicroak are the next two big threats; the former bypasses Terrakion's Speed with Mach Punch, while both shrug off Terrakion's attacks with good bulk and resistances, respectively. The latter loses if Terrakion has Earthquake, however. Reuniclus and Musharna are not OHKOed by X-Scissor, and can threaten to OHKO with Psychic in return. Cresselia can only 2HKO Terrakion with Psychic, but her massive bulk enables her to survive even two consecutive X-Scissors. Terrakion hates rain teams as they commonly run multiple Water-types, most of whom can OHKO it. Swift Swim users are even greater problems as they outspeed Terrakion, with some able to outrun even Choice Scarf Terrakion. Other Water-types, such as Rotom-W, can OHKO Terrakion outside of rain, while surviving any of Terrakion's attacks.</p> <p>Finally, it should be noted that many of the Pokemon that Terrakion could normally defeat easily might be holding either a Chople or Charti Berry to survive a super effective hit and could retaliate with a super effective attack of their own; one such example is Chople Berry Scrafty.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This is Terrakion's standard set. Close Combat and Rock Slide form a nearly unresisted STAB combo, one hitting an individual target very hard, and the other hitting both opponents, albeit for less damage. Quick Attack can finish off weakened opponents, and is the usual choice for the third moveslot. An alternative option to Quick Attack is Quick Guard, as Terrakion is weak to Mach Punch, Bullet Punch, and Aqua Jet, with the first two priority moves being very prevalent. If you have teammates that are also weak to common priority attacks, Quick Guard can protect both Terrakion and your teammate from them. It also provides protection against Fake Out from Pokemon that are slower than Terrakion, and temporarily shuts down Technician Hitmontop, whose only form of offense is in the form of priority attacks. Protect is a staple move in doubles play, as it keeps Terrakion safe from harm as a teammate eliminates a potential threat to it, and lets Terrakion stall out at least one turn of Trick Room or Tailwind, in addition to guarding it from priority. Quick Guard can also be used over Protect, but this isn't recommended as Protect is generally superior to either of the moves in the third slot.</p> <p>Focus Sash is a great item for Terrakion in doubles play, as it allows Terrakion to survive common super effective attacks. Life Orb gives Terrakion a major boost in power and is a viable alternative to Focus Sash, however. As far as EVs are concerned, always maximize Speed to Speed-tie with Infernape and other Terrakion. 4 EVs each in HP and Defense enable Terrakion to always survive Jolly Tornadus's Flying Gem Acrobatics. 244 Attack EVs give the same Attack as 248, so the remaining EVs are thrown into Special Defense, as they are of no use elsewhere. Earthquake can be used in the third moveslot if the listed options aren't to your liking, but the only notable Pokemon it hits harder is Toxicroak.</p> <p>Terrakion enjoys teammates that can take out Fighting-types, as it cannot do so itself. Terrakion especially fears Mach Punch from Hitmontop and Conkeldurr, as the move bypasses Terrakion's superior Speed. Flying-types such as Tornadus and Staraptor are thus great teammates, as they both outspeed and OHKO the common Fighting-types, as well as Amoonguss that lack Coba Berry, which walls Terrakion while simultaneously threatening it with Spore and STAB Giga Drain. Speaking of Tornadus, Terrakion loves the Tailwind support it provides, as it enables Terrakion to outrun almost everything. Beat Up support gives Terrakion a +4 Attack boost thanks to its ability, Justified, making it a very deadly sweeper. Whimsicott is easily the best Beat Up supporter, as it can also provide Tailwind, Charm, and Helping Hand support. Furthermore, Whimsicott appreciates Terrakion's Quick Guard, which lets it avoid Fake Out from opponents slower than Terrakion. Keep in mind, however, that Focus Sash is counterproductive with the Beat Up strategy.</p> <p>Sandstorm support helps Terrakion survive even super effective STAB special attacks. The weather is best set up by Tyranitar, who deals with the Psychic-types that threaten Terrakion. Tyranitar can remove the rain set up by Politoed as well, preventing Swift Swim users from outspeeding and OHKOing Terrakion with their rain-boosted attacks. Latios is another excellent partner, as its typing and special bulk provide your team with durability against Water-type attacks. Additionally, Latios can OHKO Water-types with either Thunderbolt or Draco Meteor, and remove Fighting-types (barring Scrafty) with its STAB Psychic-type attacks. Finally, Fire-type partners can take out Scizor and Metagross, which threaten Terrakion with priority STAB Bullet Punch. Ninetales is notable as it also sets up sunshine to remove Terrakion's weakness to Water-type moves. However, while Terrakion usually enjoys sunshine, it enjoys sandstorm support even more. If using Ninetales, be careful of opposing Chlorophyll users that can outspeed Terrakion and hit it super effectively with Grass-type attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf, Terrakion outspeeds almost everything without more than a +1 boost in Speed, enabling it to take out certain opponents, such as Low Kick Weavile, before they have a chance to attack. Close Combat and Rock Slide are staples for great coverage; Earthquake deals less damage than STAB Rock Slide and might possibly damage your ally, but nets extra coverage and functions as another spread attack when Rock Slide wouldn't be as useful or if you really need the 100% accuracy; it forms the infamous QuakeSlide combo with Rock Slide as well. Earthquake is also notable for hitting Toxicroak super effectively; as it resists all of Terrakion's other attacks, it otherwise walls Terrakion while posing a threat with STAB Fighting-type attacks. X-Scissor hits Psychic-types harder than any of Terrakion's other moves do. Just keep in mind that it won't OHKO bulky Psychic-types such as Reuniclus and Musharna, while 252+ Musharna has a 81% chance to OHKO Terrakion with Psychic, and Reuniclus will OHKO for sure.</p> <p>Jolly is the preferred nature to outspeed Choice Scarf Garchomp and Modest Ludicolo in the rain, as well as any other Choice Scarf users with a base Speed less than 108. Jolly Terrakion also Speed-ties with neutral-natured Shiftry and Venusaur in the sun, along with +2 Blaziken. However, an Adamant nature is a viable option for the extra power. The EVs are the same as the previous set for the same reasons listed.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Terrakion shares similar checks and counters as non-Choice Scarf Terrakion. However, Earthquake and X-Scissor dent many would-be counters, such as Toxicroak, while the extra Speed makes Terrakion more difficult to revenge kill, but this comes at the price of being locked into one attack. Choice Scarf Terrakion doesn't need Tailwind support, but hates Trick Room even more than usual. Tyranitar sets up sandstorm to support Terrakion, and is a great answer to the many Ghost- and Psychic-types that set up Trick Room; with its low Speed, Tyranitar also benefits from Trick Room should the opponent set it up. Terrakion appreciates both Wide Guard and Quick Guard support to avoid many super effective attacks such as Earthquake and Mach Punch, even more so than the previous set as it doesn't have Protect. Unfortunately, most of the users of those two attacks share Terrakion's Fighting typing, meaning the team will be doubly weak to Psychic-type attacks. Nevertheless, Hitmontop is the best user of both those attacks because it has Sucker Punch to dent Psychic-types and can use Fake Out as Terrakion uses X-Scissor.</p>"

  "Virizion": {
    "overview": "<p>Virizion is an excellent Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame. It has great STAB coverage against many common Pokemon, such as Tyranitar and Politoed. With base 108 Speed, Virizion outspeeds a large portion of the metagame, which makes it an excellent choice to attack quickly with great power. High Special Defense and decent HP stats, coupled with key resistance to Water-, Rock-, Ground-, and Electric-type moves—which are often seen in the form of spread moves—in addition to resistances to Grass- and Dark-type moves, enable Virizion to be both an effective wall and a supporting Pokemon as well. However, Virizion is limited by average offensive stats, a shallow movepool, low physical bulk, and weaknesses to Fire- and Ice-type moves. Overall, Virizion is an incredibly versatile Pokemon that can fit many roles on your team effectively if used wisely.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Virizion could make use of any Choice item, but the lack of versatility of these sets can be crippling, especially in fast-paced VGC matches. Virizion's shallow movepool further limits the viability of a Choice item; it will usually have to rely on Hidden Power for coverage. Virizion has access to Calm Mind, Work Up, and Swords Dance, but these moves aren't very viable in VGC and often reveal your set, which makes them mediocre options at best. In conclusion, a fairly shallow movepool leaves Virizion with little to work with outside the listed sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky walls tend to cause trouble for Virizion, especially if they only take neutral damage from Virizion's STAB attacks. Intimidate can cripple the physical set, and special walls will be able to take Virizion's hits with relative ease. Users of Drain Punch, such as Conkeldurr, can hit Virizion hard and regain HP at the same time, and they only take neutral damage from Virizion's STAB attacks. Virizion also has trouble with Dragon-type Pokemon. Even with Hidden Power Ice, Virizion will usually be unable to OHKO common Dragon-types; Latios, Dragonite, and Salamence can thus make quick work of Virizion. Flying-type Pokemon such as Tornadus and Fire-type Pokemon such as Infernape can take down Virizion with their STAB attacks as well.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Leaf Blade is Virizion's only physical Grass-type attack, and allows it to take down many common members of rain teams, such as Politoed, Jellicent, and Gastrodon, as well as other Water-types, such as Slowbro, Suicune, and Starmie. Leaf Blade also hits many Pokemon commonly found on sand teams, such as Hippowdon, Krookodile, Tyranitar, and Rhyperior, very hard. Sacred Sword and Close Combat provide Virizion with a strong Fighting-type STAB. Close Combat hits much harder and can gain KOs that Sacred Sword would miss out on, but the Defense and Special Defense drops leave Virizion extremely vulnerable to most attacks. Thanks to its Fighting-type coverage, Virizion is able to hit Excadrill and Heatran for super effective damage, and also dent other common Pokemon, such as Metagross. Although its accuracy is shaky at best, Stone Edge provides coverage against Flying-type Pokemon, such as Togekiss, Tornadus, Thundurus, and Zapdos. If Stone Edge doesn't cut it for you, X-Scissor is another option that allows Virizion to hit Grass- and Psychic-types, such as Ludicolo, Latios, Latias, and Cresselia, for super effective damage. Protect is a vital move in VGC that enables Virizion to avoid a turn of damage while its partner takes out an imminent threat.</p> <p>Life Orb is the preferred item for this set thanks to the 30% boost it gives to all of Virizion's attacks; however, if you find the 10% recoil unappealing, Grass Gem or Fighting Gem are both viable options to boost one of Virizion's STAB moves for a one-time hit. Expert Belt is another option that boosts Virizion's super effective hits without any drawbacks. Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature enable Virizion to Speed tie with other base 108 Speed Pokemon, such as Infernape and Terrakion. Virizion can also run Safeguard or Helping Hand in place of X-Scissor, Stone Edge, or Protect; however, losing the coverage or protection granted by those moves can be dangerous and might not be worth your while. Virizion can also run Hidden Power Ice with a Naive nature to hit Landorus, Garchomp, and other Dragon- and Flying-types super effectively.</p> <p>Fire-types are good partners thanks to their ability to take down Ice-type Pokemon that threaten Virizion. Heatran and Chandelure make for exceptional partners to Virizion due to their Flash Fire ability, which gives them immunity to Fire-type moves, as well as their resistance to Ice-type moves. Virizion also appreciates Fake Out support, as it allows Virizion to take out threats while they are incapable of attacking; Hitmontop therefore makes for an excellent partner thanks to its access to both Fake Out and Wide Guard. Wide Guard can block the Heat Waves and Blizzards that plague Virizion, and Fake Out can give it a free turn in which to attack. Hitmontop also has Intimidate, which makes up for Virizion's lack of physical bulk. Furthermore, Hitmontop's access to Sucker Punch allows it to take out Chandelure and Latios, who pose major threats to Virizion. Follow Me and Rage Powder users can make for good partners to Virizion as well; however, Rage Powder users tend to be Bug-type Pokemon, who might be weak to the Flying-type moves that they are redirecting.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With a Special Attack stat equal to its decent Attack stat, Virizion can also run a set that capitalizes on its specially based movepool. Giga Drain provides Virizion with a strong Grass-type STAB in addition to recovery, which is something the physical set lacks. Focus Blast is Virizion's only special Fighting-type move, and its low accuracy is a major detriment to the set. However, thanks to its 120 Base Power, Focus Blast hits very hard and makes up for Virizion's merely decent offensive stat. Hidden Power Ice provides coverage against Salamence, Garchomp, and Landorus, all of which Virizion outspeeds. Protect allows Virizion to scout for moves and protect itself from damage for a turn.</p> <p>Once again, Life Orb is the recommended item for Virizion. The attack boost is appreciated because Virizion's Speed stat requires it to use a Speed-boosting nature in order to keep up with common metagame threats such as Infernape, Terrakion, Garchomp, and Landorus. If the 10% recoil is unappealing, Expert Belt is once again a viable item to boost Virizion's super effective attacks by 20% at no cost. Grass Gem and Fighting Gem are also options, but their one-time-use might make them unappealing. The EVs maximize Virizion's Special Attack and Speed, which allows it to hit hard while keeping pace with speedy metagame threats. If you want Virizion to be slightly bulkier, a spread of 28 HP / 252 SpA / 228 Spe is viable; however, the reduced Speed only allows Virizion to outspeed base 105 Speed Pokemon, such as Mienshao.</p> <p>Virizion will appreciate partners that can break through special walls, such as Cresselia and Blissey, whom it fares poorly against; the likes of Tyranitar and Hitmontop fill this role excellently. Tyranitar resists Flying-, Fire-, and Psychic-type moves, and can hit those three types for super effective damage with its STAB moves, while Hitmontop has access to Fake Out, Sucker Punch, Wide Guard, and Close Combat, which either dent special walls or prevent spread moves and normal attacks from harming Virizion. Virizion is very susceptible to weather when running this particular set, and particularly dislikes the Special Defense boost Tyranitar gains from sandstorm. Therefore, physical attackers who can OHKO Tyranitar, such as Hitmontop and other Fighting-types, make for very useful teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Dedicated Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Virizion's vast support movepool. Reflect and Light Screen help lessen the damage that Virizion and its teammate might take. Virizion's Speed enables it to get these screens up before many strong slower attackers get a chance to move. Giga Drain stops Virizion from becoming Taunt bait, and also enables it to recover HP as it attacks, while Helping Hand can aid its partner in getting OHKOs it might not have been able to score without the boost, which makes Virizion a powerful ally. However, if Helping Hand isn't needed, Protect is a valuable tool to help keep Virizion safe from harm.</p> <p>The EVs and nature enable Virizion to outspeed Pokemon with base 105 Speed or less, and provide ample bulk to cushion hits. Other support options include Taunt, Quick Guard, and Safeguard, all of which might be worth considering over a screen if your team isn't particularly weak to either physical or special hits. Virizion can also run Sacred Sword instead of Giga Drain to hit a little harder, but without Giga Drain's HP recovery, Virizion will be forced to run Leftovers, which is usually an inferior option to Sitrus Berry. Leftovers can replace Sitrus Berry if it is being used by another Pokemon, but seeing as VGC matches don't run for very many turns, Sitrus Berry is preferred.</p> <p>As Virizion is a supporting Pokemon, its teammates will have to make up for its lack of offensive presence. Strong attackers, such as Dragonite, Latios, Terrakion, Volcarona, and Metagross, all appreciate screen support and Helping Hand's boosts to pick up a few extra KOs. Without a strong offensive partner, Virizion's support efforts will generally be wasted.</p>"

  "Tornadus": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Tornadus's Incarnate forme appears to be outclassed by its Therian form, as Tornadus-T has better bulk and higher Speed. However, normal Tornadus has access to the incredibly useful Prankster and Defiant abilities, as well as better Attack and Special Attack stats. Even though it's slower than its Therian forme, Tornadus still has a blistering fast base 111 Speed and can outpace most of the metagame. Furthermore, access to an incredibly powerful STAB Acrobatics allows Tornadus to deal major damage to any Pokemon that doesn't resist it.</p> <p>Tornadus didn't get much love after the VGC 2011 season ended. Intimidate's popularity took off, Tyranitar and Metagross were (and still are) everywhere, and because of its one-dimensional coverage, which consisted of Acrobatics and... Acrobatics, a lot of teams could easily handle Tornadus without going out of their way. However, with the release of its Dream World ability, Defiant, and the addition of Superpower to its movepool courtesy of BW2, Tornadus found its way into more teams. While it still has issues with old foes, Tornadus remains as a great pick to offset the influx of Intimidate spam goodstuffs, or just Fighting-types in general.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tornadus is strapped for physical Fighting-type moves, with the only other options being Hammer Arm and Brick Break. Brick Break can help out against Light Screen Cresselia and doesn't lower your stats, but is laughably weak, being unable to OHKO Chople Berry-less Tyranitar. Hammer Arm is stronger and might seem appealing to \"counter\" Trick Room, but is generally a bad idea, especially since max Speed Tornadus will often need to use it twice before it's actually slower than anything on a Trick Room team. Crunch is another interesting option, as it hits the ever-present Psychic-types super effectively, but isn't worth it unless you're keen on preserving your Flying Gem, because Acrobatics will hit harder than a super effective Crunch. Other supportive moves, or more accurately moves that receive the Prankster boost, include Swagger, Rain Dance and Role Play. Swagger boosts your teammates's Attack with no side effects if they're holding a Lum or Persim Berry, or are protected by Safeguard. It also functions defensively to spread confusion to your opponent, potentially preventing huge Draco Meteors or annoying Thunder Waves from landing. Rain Dance is useful for setting up rain should your Politoed suffer a premature demise, and could be used in conjunction with Hurricane. In a similar vein to Skill Swap, Role Play allows Tornadus to copy your partner's or the opponent's Intimidate, Storm Drain, Lightningrod, Sand Stream, and for the adventurous, Contrary abilities. The main reason this isn't terribly useful is because of how situational it can be, requiring the right opponent should you lack partners with said abilities, and the fact that it doesn't transfer abilities like Skill Swap does, (for instance, you can't remove opposing Gastrodon's Storm Drain to hit its partner with a Water-type move) making it less versatile than Skill Swap.</p> <p>Tornadus has a much better special movepool compared to its physical, as well as a higher Special Attack. The reason none of those are used however, is because special Tornadus is largely outclassed by its brothers, Thundurus-T and Landorus as well as other Pokemon such as Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Cresselia because of either bulk and access to Speed control or more reliable, higher Base Power moves such as Thunderbolt and Earth Power. Special Tornadus can be used to great effect, however, as long as you keep supportive moves on it and take advantage of Prankster.</p> <p>Unfortunately, while Tornadus has a myriad of usable special moves, the vast majority of them don't exceed 80 Base Power. These moves are Dark Pulse, Hidden Power, Heat Wave, Grass Knot, and Icy Wind. Heat Wave is a useful spread move, considering how Tornadus hates Steel- and Ice-types, but is still weak due to the 25% power drop when hitting two Pokemon. Grass Knot can surpass 80 Base Power on Tyranitar and Terrakion, though it can't OHKO Tyranitar and has little utility outside of that. Dark Pulse isn't used for the same reason as Crunch, but in this case, it can cause timely flinches and is stronger than Air Slash when hitting super effectively. The most useful Hidden Power would probably be Ice, but it suffers from being woefully weak. Icy Wind is useful for Speed control as it trips Yache Berries and still does a reasonable amount of damage, though it doesn't get a Prankster boost while Tailwind does and accomplishes mostly the same thing, albeit only for three turns. Tornadus's most powerful special attacks, Hurricane and Focus Blast, would rocket special Tornadus to the top of its sets in terms of usage if either one was more accurate than 70% in any weather. Hurricane is still a useful option for rain teams, but again, it is outclassed by Thundurus there and rain can be cancelled in the blink of an eye with Abomasnow and Tyranitar. Air Slash is therefore the most reliable STAB, but it suffers from a horrendous 75 Base Power, which isn't enough to OHKO things it's supposed to, such as Hitmontop, though it does have a 30% flinch chance working in its favor.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Like any other Flying-type, Pokemon that resist its STAB moves and threaten it with super effective STAB moves of their own are Tornadus's natural predators. Zapdos, bulky Thundurus, and Rotom-W (as well as every other Rotom except Rotom-C) spring to mind, as the only thing that Tornadus can threaten the former two with is the rare Hidden Power Ice, and even with minimal defensive investment, it misses out on the OHKO. Tornadus can only hope for a critical hit with Superpower, should it be unfortunate enough to be left alone against a Rotom forme. Tyranitar with Chople Berry is another great check to Tornadus, as it isn't as afraid of Superpower as Dark Gem or Passho Berry variants are, and resists Acrobatics. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can straight-up outspeed Tornadus and threaten it with Rock Slide, although Jolly Tyranitar's Rock Slide misses out on OHKOing Tornadus at full health without Sand Stream damage or Helping Hand support, and Adamant Tyranitar only has a 50/50 shot at OHKOing it, which aren't exactly betting odds. Metagross can switch in on the first Acrobatics with ease, making Tornadus easier to deal with for the rest of the match, and can use Ice Punch or a simple Meteor Mash to bring it down to Bullet Punch range, or even Feint range should you have another Pokemon with it. Lastly, Tornadus hates getting burned or paralyzed; Sableye is especially good at burning Defiant variants, which are easy to pick out if you pay attention to the Poké Ball it was released from, but it has to be wary of Prankster Tornadus that use Taunt. Cresselia is the prime user of Thunder Wave, and has the option of using Ice Beam to nail cheeky Tornadus that think they can get away with simply Taunting a Cresselia. Cresselia also has the option of using Icy Wind, which can't be blocked by Taunt and can deal around 20% to Tornadus, making it easy pickings for the aforementioned Tyranitar. It should be noted, however, that by slowing Defiant Tornadus with Icy Wind, you risk an incredibly powerful Acrobatics next turn, so make sure you're able to KO it afterwards.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defiant Acrobat": {
        "description": "<p>Behold the majesty of Defiant Tornadus. This set boasts a whopping 165 Base Power STAB move, utility with Taunt and Tailwind, and of course the very real possibility that Tornadus will receive an Attack boost without having to do anything thanks to the popularity of Intimidate. Superpower picks up Acrobatics's slack, nailing troublesome Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Bisharp, though it is interesting to note that a Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics hits Pokemon such as Rotom-W just as hard as a neutral Superpower would. If the Attack and Defense drops seem too risky, U-turn is perhaps a safer option. U-turn still hurts Tyranitar, softening it up for a more capable teammate to take care of it, and keeps Tornadus safe until the coast is clear and it can continue to fire off Acrobatics.</p> <p>Taunt is a mainstay from its 2011 Prankster set, especially with Cresselia running around everywhere using annoying moves such as Swagger and Thunder Wave. It is also a good way to halt Trick Room setup with a little help from a Fake Out user. Tailwind is another move you might recognize. The boost it provides to Tornadus and its teammates' Speed allows them to go toe-to-toe with Swift Swim, Sand Rush, or Choice Scarf Pokemon, even if only for three turns. However, Tailwind is still, and always will be, a risky play for Tornadus as long as Trick Room and Thunder Wave remain popular, so as always, use it in moderation. Substitute is slightly less useful without Prankster backing it up, but since Tornadus outspeeds all of its threats bar Choice Scarf users and the surprisingly uncommon max Speed Thundurus, Substitute is a great move that can block troublesome Will-O-Wisps, Sucker Punches, and weakened Draco Meteors. Protect is a staple for Defiant Tornadus because the most common Intimidate Pokemon —Hitmontop and Scrafty— also carry Fake Out, which can leave Tornadus wide open and vulnerable to Rock Slides or Thunderbolts.</p> <p>A Jolly nature and max Speed allow Tornadus to outspeed many common threats, most notably Latios, Terrakion, and Garchomp. This makes it easy for Tornadus to fire a Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics without having to worry about getting hit first. Slightly bulkier spreads could be an option, but dropping even one Speed point or too much Attack power means Tornadus either Speed ties with Latios or misses out on OHKOing it, respectively.</p> <p>This Tornadus functions best as a no-frills physical attacker, and appreciates support from its partners to deal with bulkier Pokemon that can sponge Acrobatics. Terrakion can use Rock Slide, Close Combat, and Earthquake to take care of many Rock-, Electric-, and Steel-types that give Tornadus trouble. Slower partners, such as Tyranitar and Metagross, appreciate Tailwind support and can provide chip damage via Sand Stream and Bullet Punch, respectively. Cresselia is an excellent partner for using Helping Hand and providing chip damage and Speed control with Icy Wind, and has access to Trick Room to reverse an opponent's Trick Room, or perhaps use it to outspeed your opponent should the situation present itself.</p>"
      },
      "Prankster Acrobat": {
        "description": "<p>The new Defiant Tornadus might be more popular than the old Prankster Tornadus, but Prankster is by no means outclassed; in fact, against teams without Intimidate, Prankster Tornadus is arguably more useful. Priority Tailwind is useful for turning the tables on Swift Swim and Choice Scarf Pokemon and turning lumbering tanks into Speed demons. Priority Taunt is also a great move to have in the unfortunate event that Trick Room is set up and Amoonguss is threatening to Spore your entire team. It also shuts down most Cresselia, although they'll still threaten Tornadus if they have Ice Beam and Special Attack investment. Substitute can be a makeshift Protect because of priority and has the potential to linger for more than one turn, should the opponent not attack Tornadus, and also acts as a nice barrier against status moves such as Thunder Wave and Spore. However, Tornadus's Substitutes can't take more than one attack most of the time, and spread moves such as Rock Slide allow the opponent to break the Substitute without having to predict; in such cases, Protect is the superior and safer option. Acrobatics is here for obvious reasons and Superpower can round out its coverage. An offensive Prankster (pun intended) is certainly viable, though it would be best to make use of Tailwind in this case.</p> <p>Much like the Defiant set, Tornadus works best with the listed EV spread. Unlike the Defiant set, however, Prankster Tornadus can viably use a slightly different Adamant spread because of Tailwind. However, it requires a massive amount of investment to survive heavy hits such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T's Stone Edge or various Draco Meteors, so if you drop Jolly for Adamant, the initial spread would probably be best.</p> <p>Tornadus pairs especially well with Fake Out users such as Hitmontop and Scrafty, who provide windows to set up Tailwind. Sweepers that appreciate Tailwind support, such as Zapdos, Thundurus, Tyranitar, and Metagross, also pair well with Tornadus. Terrakion can use Rock Slide, Close Combat, and Earthquake to take care of many Rock-, Electric-, and Steel-types that give Tornadus trouble.</p>"

  "Thundurus": {
    "overview": "<p>One of the most dominant Pokemon in VGC 2011, Thundurus is just as strong in VGC 2012. Its ability, Prankster, makes it one of the few Pokemon that have access to priority Rain Dance, and with a movepool including excellent options such as Thunder, Hidden Power Flying, and Thunder Wave, Thundurus can function as a sweeper or a team supporter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thundurus also has access to several other helpful moves, such as Discharge, Psychic, Grass Knot, Focus Blast, Embargo, and Swagger. Discharge can be useful if Thundurus is paired with a partner that is immune to Electric-type attacks, such as Garchomp. With a 30% chance of inflicting paralysis, there is a 51% chance that at least one of the two opposing Pokemon will be paralyzed if both are hit. Discharge can even be used with an Electric Gem to deal massive amounts of damage. However, because Discharge damages everyone on the field, Thundurus's partner must be immune to it, or else risk getting paralyzed. Psychic hits Fighting-types for more damage, but unlike Hidden Power Flying, loses super effective coverage on Grass-types. Grass Knot removes Gastrodon and the less common Swampert, who otherwise wall Thundurus. Focus Blast allows Thundurus to hit Tyranitar, but is risky because of its low accuracy.</p> <p>Embargo is an alternative that often catches people off-guard by disabling their items. However, it must be used correctly because Thundurus often does not last longer than two turns on the field. Swagger allows the opponent to attack only 50% of the time, and can be used in conjunction with Substitute to not only stall out Trick Room, but also to slowly cause damage via confusion. However, because of confusion's unpredictability, it is risky.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Regardless of its set, Thundurus has major problems against Pokemon that resist its attacking moves. Tyranitar is one of the greatest problems to Thundurus, as it resists Hidden Power Flying, takes little from Thunder, and can hit back hard with Rock Slide, which is a guaranteed KO after sandstorm damage. Rotom-H resists both Thundurus's STAB attacks and can 2HKO it with Thunderbolt, while Rotom-F fears only a surprise Focus Blast and can OHKO Thundurus with Blizzard. Unless Thundurus is running the rare Grass Knot, Gastrodon and Swampert also cause it problems, as their bulk and Electric immunity let them wall Thundurus easily. Although it is weak to Hidden Power Ice, Garchomp often carries a Yache Berry and can hit Thundurus hard with Rock Slide.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard Support": {
        "description": "<p>This is the most straightforward and effective set for Thundurus. Thundurus's primary offensive potential comes from its STAB Thunderbolt, which lets it dish out consistent damage every turn. Both Hidden Power Flying and Hidden Power Ice have their uses, and the choice should depend on how well Thundurus's teammates deal with the following threats. Hidden Power Flying allows Thundurus to hit Pokemon such as Hitmontop, Ludicolo, and Toxicroak for a large amount of damage, but leaves it walled by the likes of Tyranitar and Landorus. Hidden Power Ice covers several different threats, including Landorus, Garchomp, and Salamence, but loses coverage against Fighting-types. Because of Prankster, Thundurus receives priority on Thunder Wave, enabling it to paralyze even boosted threats before they have a chance to attack. The toss-up between Substitute and Protect once again depends on user preference and playstyle, and both have their strengths and weaknesses.</p> <p>252 Special Attack and Speed EVs grant Thundurus maximum power and speed; it wants to hit as hard as possible while disrupting opponents with Thunder Wave, allowing strong sweepers to finish off the foe late-game. Charti Berry lets Thundurus better tank the common Rock Slide, although a Yache Berry is an equally viable alternative.</p> <p>Thundurus can work well with a variety of teammates; as Thundurus's main role is to cripple your opponent while still doing as much damage as possible, it can easily fit into any team. In particular, Thundurus is great alongside Garchomp, as it is immune to Garchomp's Earthquake and can paralyze anything faster than Garchomp, helping it sweep. Hitmontop also has great synergy with Thundurus, thanks to its ability to provide Intimidate support and remove counters to Thundurus, such as Tyranitar.</p>"
      },
      "Rain Dance Support": {
        "description": "<p>This is the most straightforward and effective set for any Rain Dance team. Thunder, although a risky move to use outside of rain, is necessary because of its sheer power. Prankster makes Thunder Wave a superb support move, as it lets Thundurus paralyze threats such as opposing Swift Swim Pokemon. Rain Dance can also be considered in this moveslot if maintaining rain is very important to your team. Hidden Power Flying hits several common threats—namely Ludicolo, Toxicroak, Abomasnow, and Hitmontop—for a large amount of damage.</p> <p>Lastly, Substitute and Protect are both viable options, and your pick should depend on your playstyle and team. With Prankster, Thundurus can always set up a Substitute before the opponent is able to attack, which can be handy when facing Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteors, as Substitute not only wastes their Gem, but also causes their Special Attack to drop needlessly. With proper prediction, Thundurus can sometimes even set up a free Substitute, making it more difficult to take down. For example, if Thundurus is paired with a Fake Out user, the opponent might double Protect to negate the Fake Out, letting Thundurus set up a Substitute unscathed. However, for those that do not like the 25% HP loss along with the prediction that comes with Substitute, Protect is a safer alternative. It is a rather straightforward move, but unlike Substitute, cannot be reliably used every turn.</p> <p>Thundurus's unique typing and ability, along with its superb Speed, sets it apart from Electric-types such as Zapdos, Raikou, Rotom-W, and Jolteon, and makes it a better fit for rain teams. Thundurus is immune to Earthquake, which single-handedly makes it better than most other Electric types. Thundurus also gets access to Prankster, Thunder Wave, and Rain Dance—a combination not found on any other Pokemon.</p> <p>Thanks to its excellent Special Attack and Speed stats, Thundurus is able to outspeed several threats and damage them severely. A Timid nature and 252 Speed EVs take advantage of Thundurus's stellar Speed, allowing it to outrun common threats such as Garchomp and Terrakion, avoid being flinched by Rock Slide, and take them out with its powerful moves. Alternatively, Thundurus can use a spread of 252 HP / 248 SpA / 8 Spe with a Modest nature; although this reduces Thundurus's Speed, it grants Thundurus excellent bulk and allows it to survive almost any attack.</p> <p>As this Thundurus is built for use on a dedicated rain team, recommended partners to it include Politoed, Ludicolo, Kingdra, and Toxicroak. Pairing lead Thundurus with a Fake Out user is a very viable strategy against opposing weather teams; this allows for several options depending on your opponent's leads. For example, should they lead with a weather inducer of their own, a simple switch into Politoed not only gives you weather control, but also forces your opponent to switch out. If they don't lead with their weather inducer, Thundurus still has a variety of options, including spamming Thunder Wave and slowly crippling your opponent's team. As a first-turn Fake Out is a nuisance to many players, they often opt to double Protect, allowing Thundurus to use Rain Dance, set up a Substitute, or even switch out.</p>"

  "Thundurus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Since its Incarnate form is used almost exclusively as a bulky Thunder Wave user, Thundurus-T is what people think of when they hear \"Offensive Thundurus\". Sporting a staggering base 145 Special Attack, decent coverage and Speed, as well as a great defensive typing and ability, Thundurus-T was always destined for greatness. Although it does face some competition from the likes of Zapdos and Rotom-W for the role of bulky electric, mainly due to its reliance on Hidden Power for extra coverage, Thundurus-T has made a name for itself despite its late arrival.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thundurus-T has a few tricks up its cotton-candied sleeve, but unfortunately the vast majority of them are very situational. Flash Cannon is actually rather useful to hit both Abomasnow and Tyranitar super effectively, but it still can't KO either consistently, even with a Choice Specs boost. Focus Blast would be a great option for those two as well if it didn't have an atrocious 70% accuracy, which might seem like a fair trade, but in reality it isn't worth it because both Pokemon usually hold Focus Sashes or Chople Berries to mitigate their Fighting-type weakness. Superpower has more appealing accuracy and still has Thundurus-T's overlooked base 105 Attack to work off of, but requires investment to OHKO anything, and even then it's vulnerable to Intimidate Attack drops. Taunt and Nasty Plot can be useful in the special attacker set, where Grass Knot is used even less often. Taunt can shut down Trick Room or Amoonguss (since Thundurus-T can't OHKO specially defensive variants), which is actually very helpful, but is still a rather situational move especially considering how frail Thundurus-T is. Nasty Plot, when given a turn to set up, can mow down Pokemon that usually check it, such as Cresselia, Tyranitar, and Rotom-W, and OHKOes its bulky Incarnate counterpart. The problem lies with Thundurus-T actually getting the boost and staying alive afterwards after the opponent starts to focus fire on the suddenly very threatening Therian.</p> <p>In terms of items other, the regular attacking Thundurus-T has a lot to choose from, including Focus Sash, Ice or Flying Gems, and Expert Belt. Focus Sash is attractive, but usually not worth the drop in power unless you're interested in OHKOing Terrakion or Landorus-T without having to lock Thundurus-T into Grass Knot or Hidden Power. Flying and Ice Gems provide a Specs-esque boost, but only to their respective Hidden Powers, which don't usually have much to gain from a Gem boost. Expert Belt can provide power and versatility, but more importantly it can bluff Choice items. Expert Belt requires a super effective hit however, and even when it does, it doesn't provide a boost like a Gem or Life Orb would, which means Thundurus-T might miss out on some KOs on Pokemon such as Metagross.</p> <p>A bulkier EV spread might seem like a waste and overshadowed by Thundurus's bulky spreads, but can actually be useful against common attacks, especially if you're using Thundurus-T's excellent synergy with Water-types. A spread of 96 HP / 32 Def / 248 SpA / 8 SpD / 124 Spe allows Thundurus-T to survive attacks such as Bisharp's Dark Gem Sucker Punch and Timid Latios's non-Life Orb or Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor, allowing Thundurus-T to actually KO the two or at least heavily damage them without having to worry about Speed or priority ruining its day. Of course, that spread is for Hidden Power Flying, so you should use 92 HP / 32 Def / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 132 Spe when using Hidden Power Ice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>While Thundurus-T might be able to poke massive holes in your team, if you've EVed your Pokemon to take powerful Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteors, you've won half the battle already. Pokemon such as Cresselia and Tyranitar can already take such attacks and either OHKO Thundurus (you might want to Protect to rack up a turn of sandstorm damage to maximize your chances) or slow it down for other Pokemon to KO it. Simply outspeeding it and smacking it with a powerful STAB move is sometimes all it takes to quell the Thundur, which is precisely what Mamoswine, Terrakion, Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Weavile do from the start. Fast Draco Meteors are also great deterrents for Thundurus, and they mostly come from the likes of Latios or Kingdra in the rain. Kingdra can be especially dangerous because it's usually in a rain team's best interest to KO Thundurus as soon as possible. Choice Thundurus are easy to predict around if you have reason to believe it is in fact Choice-locked, as Thundurus has a tendency to lock itself into an undesirable move early-game. Pokemon that can take advantage of this misfortune are Gastrodon and Metagross, as well as just about every Pokemon previously mentioned. Trick Room is deadly with the right attackers, which more often than not, includes Tyranitar or Abomasnow, both of which obviously OHKO Thundurus-T with little hassle.</p> <p>As far as counters go, Lanturn is the #1 anti-Thundurus-T Pokemon. Not only does it resist or is immune to every move Thundurus can throw at it (besides unorthodox options such as Focus Blast), Thundurus-T's Grass Knot only hits for 40 Base Power, which only pulls out a 4HKO, without even factoring in healing. With this extra time on its hands, Lanturn can casually slow Thundurus with Icy Wind or chip away at it with STAB Water-type moves or Ice Beam. Lanturn is also a potential problem for rain teams, but doesn't fare too well against other teams that happen to include Thundurus-T. Perhaps ironically, Hidden Power Flying Thundurus-T are susceptible to Thundurus-T that opt for Hidden Power Ice because Volt Absorb negates its primary STAB. Similarly, Hidden Power Flying Thundurus-T is also effectively walled by Jolteon, Zebstrika, Raichu, and sometimes Rhyperior, though all of these examples are hard to fit onto a team. Rotom-H is another great candidate, as it resists all of Thundurus's moves and can OHKO with Overheat or if in the rain, 2HKO with Hidden Power.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Thundurus-T is fairly one-dimensional. With its STAB Thunderbolt and Hidden Power backed by a Choice Specs boost, Thundurus-T is more than capable of ripping holes in the opponent's team, provided it doesn't get caught out with the wrong move in the wrong situation. Thunderbolt is self-explanatory, but Volt Switch might need more explanation, considering the rarity of such moves in VGC. The premise behind Volt Switch is this: although Thundurus-Therian hits hard, in a metagame where everything is either EVed to take Dragon Gem Draco Meteors, some Pokemon need softening up before Thundurus is ready to knock heads. Furthermore, Volt Switch hits almost as hard as Thunderbolt does, making it a safe move to throw out in the beginning of the game. The choice of Hidden Power largely depends on how well your team takes on Fighting-types or Dragon-types, but due to STAB, Hidden Power Flying is naturally the more powerful option. Hidden Power Ice, however, gives you the edge against other Thundurus-T that chose Hidden Power Flying, and it is powerful enough to OHKO Yache Berry Garchomp at about the same rate as Scald burns (and we all know how often that is), which is something normally only Ice-types such as Mamoswine and Abomasnow can claim to do. In the same situation, Garchomp cannot OHKO Thundurus-T without resorting to the inaccurate Stone Edge.</p> <p>As for the third slot, Grass Knot is the best that Thundurus-T's rather shallow movepool has to offer, but it can be useful in situations where Thundurus-T is left alone against Tyranitar or Gastrodon. It might also be wise to study up on the weights of some Pokemon before haphazardly locking yourself into Grass Knot. A prime example is Rotom-W, which only takes about 25% from a 20 Base Power super effective Choice Specs-boosted Grass Knot. If you have trouble memorizing weights, pay attention to the 'slamming' animation that most Pokemon make when entering the field.</p> <p>This analysis has so far listed a few examples of Thundurus-T's power. It should be noted, however, that those examples are the work of a Choice Specs boost, which means you won't be getting the same mileage out of Choice Scarf. Choice Scarf is still a great option though, as it outspeeds Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Landorus-T, Latios, neutral +1 Volcarona, and other such Pokemon that Thundurus-T might have interest in outspeeding. This makes Choice Scarf Thundurus-T most useful in revenge killing, especially if you have Fake Out users or Pokemon that can easily soften up the opposing team.</p> <p>Thunder is a viable option when using Thundurus-T with Politoed, especially because of its 30% paralysis chance. Thunder should go over Volt Switch however; because of Tyranitar and Abomasnow, there will be times where Thundurus-T just can't afford to risk them switching in and causing Thunder to miss. A Timid nature could be used, but is mostly only good for outspeeding other Thundurus-T, and in Choice Scarf Thundurus T's case- Timid Volcarona after a Quiver Dance. The power drop usually isn't worth it because of this, as Thundurus-T barely ekes out a 2HKO against 4/0 Timid Volcarona with Hidden Power Flying, and it'll obviously be in a tight spot against Volcarona that opt for a bulkier spread. Another thing to note is that, when using Hidden Power Ice, you should use an EV spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe to avoid wasting EVs.</p> <p>As mentioned earlier, Politoed is an excellent partner for Thundurus-T for many reasons. First and foremost, Thundurus-T's Volt Absorb takes advantage of Politoed's Electric-type weakness, making it easier than ever to preserve your precious frog. Secondly, Politoed provides speed control and Helping Hand support, boosting Thundurus's destructive prowess. Finally, rain brings with it Pokemon such as Kingdra and Ludicolo, which are more than happy to deal enough damage for Thundurus to be able to clean up later.</p> <p>Like Politoed, Cresselia has Helping Hand and speed control in the form of either Icy Wind, Thunder Wave, or Trick Room, the latter of which can actually benefit Choice Specs Thundurus, as it might find itself outsped by the aforementioned Speed demons. In fact, if you're feeling cheeky, you can even heal Thundurus-T with Cresselia's Thunder Wave. Other anti-Trick Room Pokemon are also appreciated because of Thundurus-T's relative frailty. Amoonguss is a great example of this, as it can outspeed some, if not most Trick Room attackers with a Sassy nature and put everything to sleep to stall out Trick Room or, in a more general sense, it can keep the heat off of Thundurus while the latter plugs away at the opposing team.</p> <p>Tyranitar is an odd option, but it — along with Excadrill — appreciates a STAB Thunderbolt working against nasty Water-types, especially Politoed. Excadrill and Thundurus-T can also serve as a \"fast mode\" with Excadrill spamming Earthquakes to its heart's content while Thundurus-T takes no damage and spams its own STAB moves. Fake Out users are also much appreciated, especially those with Feint, which allows Thundurus-T to nab some unexpected KOs or simply ease prediction. Examples of these are Infernape, Hitmontop, and Sableye. Other useful Feint users include Scizor and Heracross, both of which take care of Tyranitar, Cresselia, Abomasnow, and sometimes Mamoswine, all of which are threats to Thundurus-T.</p>"

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>While lacking in Speed or attacking prowess, specially attacking Thundurus-T is unique in its versatility. Being able to switch between moves is incredibly useful, considering how Choice Specs or Choice Scarf Thundurus-T is easily walled should it lock itself into an unfavorable move. It also isn't forced to switch moves and has increased longevity thanks to Protect, which is useful to avoid double-targeting.</p> <p>Even though this Thundurus-T is more versatile in its playstyle, its moveslots aren't very flexible. The standard Thunderbolt, Hidden Power, and Grass Knot core is hard to replace, as it is really all Thundurus-T needs in the first place. The question of which Hidden Power to use is the same as the Choice sets; do you want to hit Dragon- or Fighting-types? There is no wrong answer to this question because it depends largely on your team, so you might find yourself bouncing between the two in practice. Protect is almost non-negotiable, as one of the main draws for a non-Choice set is the ability to use it, but if you don’t feel the need for it, you can easily switch it with Volt Switch to make a miniature Choice set.</p> <p>Again, Thunder is a great move if you’re using Thundurus-T with Politoed, but beware of weather inducers such as Tyranitar, Abomasnow, and miscellaneous Sunny Day users. A Timid nature drops Thundurus-T's damage output even further, but can help out with opposing Thundurus-T and other Pokemon that might run odd Speed spreads. Because of this Thundurus’s increased longevity, a Timid nature isn't such a bad idea considering it might stick around longer to play out those 2HKOs.</p> <p>Life Orb is generally the more useful item as it consistently boosts all of Thundurus-T's attacks, but if the recoil is a turn-off, Electric Gem provides a one-time boost that is comparable to that of Choice Specs. Additionally, Electric Gem might enable Thundurus-T to bluff a Choice set as long as you don't immediately use Thunderbolt, as it doesn't announce itself otherwise.</p> <p>The partners for this set don't differ as much from the Choice set, except Tyranitar is a slightly weaker option considering how quickly Life Orb and Sand Stream damage can accumulate. Helping Hand is especially helpful because of the power difference, and chip damage is all the more useful. Thunder Wave support is not only helpful for speed control, but also to offset Thundurus’s Life Orb recoil. Feint is slightly more helpful if you reveal the fact that Thundurus-T isn't Choiced, which makes opponents more reliant on Protect to stave off Thundurus’s powerful Thunderbolts and coverage moves.</p>"

  "Landorus": {
    "overview": "<p>Landorus has two things going for it: a strong STAB Earthquake, and a good defensive typing. While it may seem outclassed by Garchomp, with its better secondary STAB typing and superior Speed, Landorus distinguishes itself from Garchomp with access to Explosion, lack of a weakness to Dragon-type attacks, immunity to Ground-type attacks, and Sand Force, which can make its attacks ridiculously powerful. Similar to Garchomp, though, Landorus has a 4x weakness to Ice-type attacks, which makes it susceptible to a multitude of common attackers. While it has its downsides, Landorus's huge power, excellent speed, and spread coverage makes it a powerful attacker in its own right.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf set with an Adamant nature provides an unexpected check to a ton of faster Pokemon, including would-be checks such as Weavile. U-turn cuts down on prediction, especially against Trick Room teams, and hits Abomasnow hard while escaping Blizzard. Imprison can stop Protect and Earthquake, which can be quite handy, and Sandstorm can be useful if your Tyranitar or Hippowdon is KOed, stopping rain and sun teams while activating Sand Force. Bulldoze acts as a pseudo-Icy Wind, and still hits reasonably hard, but it's somewhat difficult to use effectively since so many Pokemon are immune to it. Hammer Arm OHKOes non-Chople Berry Tyranitar, but has overlapping coverage with Earthquake and lowers Landorus's speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ice-types, especially Abomasnow, are Landorus's worst enemy, easily OHKOing with their STAB attacks unless Landorus has a Yache Berry, although Rock Slide will do a number on any Ice-type. Bulky Water-types, and rain teams in general, can cause problems for Landorus as well, although Grass Knot from a special set will hurt. Breloom takes little from Earthquake or Rock Slide, and can use Spore to incapacitate Landorus, but it is easily KOed by Explosion or Psychic. Latios outspeeds and KOes Landorus, while Latias takes little from most attacks and can do good damage in return. Thundurus and Zapdos can severely damage or KO Landorus with Hidden Power Ice, but are damaged in return by Rock Slide. Rotom-W easily OHKOes with Hydro Pump, but is KOed by a Normal Gem or Helping Hand Explosion.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Landorus's Speed and coverage make it a good check to most Rock- and Fighting-type attackers. Earthquake and Rock Slide have amazing type coverage, and with a Sand Force boost, Landorus hits incredibly hard with Earthquake, OHKOing or 2HKOing literally anything that doesn't resist it. Explosion is quite powerful and does good damage to Pokemon such as Abomasnow that Landorus can't normally beat. Explosion also has good synergy with Earthquake, as Earthquake does huge damage to the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Explosion. Protect is a staple move in VGC play.</p> <p>An Adamant nature boosts Landorus's Attack. While a Jolly nature allows Landorus to outspeed a few more Pokemon, its awkward base 101 Speed stat make the Speed increase just about useless. A Yache Berry lets Landorus take Blizzard and Ice Punch or an Ice Shard, while Normal Gem gives Explosion an extra boost to KO reasonably bulky stuff such as Abomasnow. Jolly Landorus outspeeds base 100s, but Adamant hits noticeably harder. Because Landorus still loses to a number of faster Pokemon such as Weavile and Latios with Jolly, an Adamant nature with less Speed investment is usable, giving Landorus greater power and bulk in exchange for some Speed. Landorus really loves Musharna as a partner; it can use Thunder Wave to slow down faster opponents and Helping Hand to boost Landorus's spread attacks, while being immune to Earthquake and Explosion due to Telepathy. Cresselia is just about as useful, with greater bulk but without an immunity to Explosion. Gengar is another good partner for that same reason and an immunity to Explosion. It can also use Icy Wind to slow down opponents, all while efficiently checking Latios, as long as Gengar holds a Focus Sash. Good teammates for Landorus are immune to Earthquake and preferably Explosion, and can complement Earthquake's coverage by hitting Flying-types and Levitate users. Pokemon that can provide Speed support for Landorus through Tailwind or Thunder Wave are also useful, since Landorus isn't extremely fast. Aerodactyl is a good example, with STAB Rock Slide to hit Flying-types and Tailwind to boost Speed.</p>"

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>While often overlooked in favor of its higher Attack stat, Landorus does possess a base 115 Special Attack stat, and can run an effective special-based set. This enables Landorus to surprise its normal counters and threaten many of the most common Pokemon in the tier. Earth Power provides a reliable STAB move, and unlike Earthquake, does not hit Landorus's ally, allowing any Pokemon to be run alongside it. Hidden Power Ice gives Landorus a way to hit Zapdos and Dragon-type Pokemon, who otherwise wall this set, for super effective damage. The last attacking move comes down to what the team needs. When using Psychic, this set is able to counter Hitmontop, one of the most common Pokemon in the metagame, with ease. Psychic 2HKOes Hitmontop, while Intimidate doesn't bother Landorus at all. On the other hand, Grass Knot allows Landorus to damage Pokemon such as Swampert, Jellicent, and Gastrodon, who can normally survive Landorus's assaults. Protect is generally recognized as a necessary move for any VGC Pokemon, and for good reason. This is because with Protect, Landorus can stall out the effects of Trick Room, wait for its partner to take out a threat, or let a weather condition whittle down its opponent's HP.</p> <p>Because of Landorus's gaping 4x weakness to Ice, a Yache Berry must be used to allow it to survive one Ice-type attack. However, a Yache Berry may already be in use elsewhere, however, in which case a Life Orb is an acceptable alternative for the power boost provided. A positive Speed nature is wasted on Landorus, as it outspeeds nothing important with its peculiar base 101 Speed stat, so a Modest nature is used to raise Landorus's Special Attack.</p> <p>Landorus greatly appreciates sandstorm support, weakening the omnipresent Blizzard and strengthening Earth Power, thanks to Landorus's ability Sand Force. Because of this, Tyranitar makes for a great partner, bringing permanent sand and the ability to hit the Special Defense beast Cresselia with Crunch. Any Pokemon who can take out the Ice-types that threaten Landorus would be a greatly appreciated partner, especially to defeat the deadly Abomasnow. While Landorus can run Rock Slide on the physical side to take care of these Pokemon, hitting with its unboosted Attack stat makes this method ineffective. Water-types are a constant bug to Landorus, so Electric-type Pokemon, such as Zapdos, make for great teammates. Zapdos is able to utilize STAB Discharge, thanks to Landorus's Ground-typing, while Landorus can use Earth Power to wreck the Rock-types who want to ruin Zapdos's fun.</p> <p>Because of Landorus's inability to hit Ice-types, Focus Blast is an option. Whilst its 70% accuracy is less than desirable, it does give a way to take out the Ice-types who make Landorus's life miserable. Hidden Power Flying provides a secondary STAB and hits harder than Psychic, though the drop in power towards Dragon-types and other Landorus is noticeable. Hidden Power Fire is a decent choice if one is overly worried about Scizor or Abomasnow, but the sacrifice in coverage makes this a less attractive option.</p>"
