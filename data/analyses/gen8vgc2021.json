        "description": "<p>Venusaur's fantastic coverage, offensive typing, Chlorophyll, and access to G-Max Vine Lash turn it into one of the best Pokemon in the metagame. Frenzy Plant gives Venusaur the most powerful G-Max Vine Lash possible, but it trades flexibility outside of Dynamax by needing a turn to recharge. Leaf Storm, on the other hand, is a slightly less powerful Max Move and decreases Venusaur's Special Attack, but it's more flexible outside of Dynamax. Sleep Powder can disrupt the opposition and lets Venusaur potentially take the upper hand in unfavorable matchups. Weather Ball allows Venusaur to make use of the weather setup by Pokemon it's nearly always used alongside. When paired with Groudon or Torkoal, Venusaur gets Max Flare, which has a roll to OHKO most Zacian-C, and when paired with Kyogre, it gets Max Geyser, allowing it to slam Fire-types like Incineroar and Charizard. Earth Power turns into Max Quake, allowing Venusaur to threaten a KO onto Coalossal after fairly minimal prior damage and lets Venusaur boost its Special Defense. Sludge Bomb turns into Max Ooze, allowing Venusaur to boost its teams Special Attack, and it hits Grimmsnarl for a hefty amount of damage. With Life Orb and a Modest nature, Venusaur has the ability to 2HKO Rotom-H with G-Max Vine Lash and OHKO Zacian-C with Max Flare. Coba Berry improves Venusaur's matchup against Flying-types such as Landorus-T and Thundurus. Focus Sash helps against Pokemon such as Coalossal and Charizard, allowing Venusaur to threaten them with Sleep Powder after surviving any hit. When running Weakness Policy, consider running a bulkier EV spread such as 132 HP / 44 Def / 76 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Timid nature, which survives Thundurus's Life Orb-boosted Max Airstream unless it gets the highest possible roll. This spread also pairs especially well with dual screens support to survive powerful super effective attacks under Dynamax, (RC) and retaliate harder. A Timid nature allows Venusaur to outspeed Regieleki and +1 Thundurus under sun, whereas Modest removes these luxuries but allows Venusaur to score more OHKOs and 2HKOs, such as G-Max Vine Lash 2HKOing Rotom-H after the residual damage from the move and Life Orb-boosted Max Quake scoring an OHKO onto Gigantamax Coalossal.</p> <p>Due to Chlorophyll, Venusaur pairs well with Pokemon that are able to easily set sun for it, such as Groudon and Torkoal. Paired with Groudon, Venusaur is able to check Water-types such as Rotom-W and Kyogre that threaten Groudon, while Groudon is able to threaten Fire-types such as Rotom-H, Incineroar, and Charizard that threaten Venusaur. Torkoal, on the other hand, is the best non-Restricted Pokemon to set sun for Venusaur, freeing the team to run another dangerous Restricted Pokemon such as Zacian-C or Kyogre, and it can provide additional support with Yawn or Burning Jealousy. Venusaur also pairs well with another beneficiary of the sun in Charizard because it's oftentimes able to weaken the opposition with its sheer power, allowing Venusaur to clean up. Kyogre is an amazing partner for Venusaur; although contradictory to Chlorophyll being a rain setter, it's able to take advantage of Venusaur’s Max Ooze boosts and threaten Fire-types that Venusaur struggles against. Grimmsnarl is capable of setting dual screens to help Venusaur's fairly mediocre bulk and can provide speed control with Scary Face or Thunder Wave, leaving Venusaur not completely reliant on sun. Venusaur pairs excellently alongside Porygon2 for its ability to help handle threats to Venusaur such as Landorus-T with Ice Beam and weaken Rotom-H via Eerie Impulse. Landorus-T can also be a nice teammate for Venusaur, being able to threaten opposing Charizard and Rotom-H with Rock-type coverage.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Gigantamax Charizard is among the metagames best Pokemon for its ability to melt nearly everything under sun, access to G-Max Wildfire, and positive matchups versus other common Pokemon such as Venusaur and Zacian-C. Due to Heat Wave's spread move status and Charizard's power, its generally the best option for it to use outside of Dynamax, and during Dynamax it grants Charizard access to G-Max Wildfire and its incredibly powerful residual effect. Hurricane grants Charizard the strongest Max Airstream, allowing it to boost its Speed and snowball with its immense power. Hurricane's poor accuracy in the sun isn't much of a problem, since Charizard rarely needs to use it outside of Dynamax. Alternatively, Air Slash is a decent alternative option that gives Charizard a move with greater consistency; however, the situations where Air Slash is better than Hurricane are niche, but the additional power Hurricane grants is also fairly niche. Blast Burn grants Charizard the strongest possible G-Max Wildfire, making it capable of OHKOing Porygon2 when holding Life Orb under sun. Due to Blast Burn's recharge penalty, its only reasonably justifiable to run it alongside another Fire-type move. Ancient Power is specifically useful to take out opposing Charizard with Max Rockfall, though Max Rockfall does replace sun and weakens Charizard significantly. Scorching Sands gives Charizard access to Max Quake, which destroys Dynamaxed Coalossal under sun, one of the few Pokemon it fails to very meaningfully threaten otherwise, and it's also useful for boosting Charizard's Special Defense. Life Orb grants Charizard cataclysmic levels of power, allowing it to OHKO both Incineroar and Dynamaxed Landorus-T under sun with G-Max Wildfire and Max Quake, respectively. Safety Goggles is immensely useful for an immunity to Venusaur's Sleep Powder. Lum Berry protects Charizard from the aforementioned Sleep Powder as well as Thunder Wave from support Thundurus and Grimmsnarl, but the downside of being a one-time use leaves Charizard susceptible to being hit by multiple status moves after it's been used. Assault Vest is another good option to improve Charizard's matchup versus special attackers such as Regieleki, Calyrex-S, and opposing Charizard. With Assault Vest, consider a bulkier EV spread such as 4 HP / 4 Def / 188 SpA / 60 SpD / 252 Spe with a Timid nature, which survives Dynamaxed Regieleki's Max Lightning. Wacan Berry is a niche option that helps against Regieleki and Thundurus, though Charizard's other options are generally more useful.</p> <p>Charizard's longing to be under sun makes Drought Pokemon such as Groudon and Torkoal great teammates. Torkoal is the best non-Restricted Pokemon to set sun, freeing the team to run another dangerous Restricted Pokemon, usually Zacian-C. Venusaur is phenomenal alongside Charizard, as both love being under sun, with Venusaur checking some of Charizard's biggest threats like Regieleki and Kyogre. Regieleki is another great teammate to Charizard for being one of best answers to Kyogre teams and providing speed control with Electroweb. Ground-types such as Groudon and Landorus-T make good partners for Charizard, as they check Coalossal effectively, while Charizard can tackle common Ice- and Grass-types such as Calyrex-I, Rillaboom, and Kartana. Charizard pairs well with Grimmsnarl thanks to its dual screens support helping with Charizard's mediocre bulk, and it can also provide Charizard speed control via Thunder Wave or Scary Face. Prankster Pokemon with access to Sunny Day such as Sableye and Whimsicott can be used in lieu of a Drought Pokemon, both providing the weather and speed control that Charizard demands.</p> "

Blastoise is able to dish out large amounts of damage with G-Max Cannonade's powerful residual effect, and Hydro Cannon gives Blastoise the strongest possible G-Max Cannonade, and being inflexible outside of Dynamax doesn't matter much since Blastoise often is the one Dynamaxing on the team. Blizzard gives Blastoise the strongest possible Max Hailstorm against threats such as Venusaur, Dragapult, and Rillaboom, 2HKOing Dynamaxed Dragapult. Ice Beam can be used for more consistency outside of Dynamax, which is especially relevant given that the hail set by Max Hailstorm is often replaced, leaving Blizzard inaccurate. Blastoise can pressure Dynamaxed Pokemon with Yawn reliably thanks to its natural bulk, threatening to waste their Dynamax turns. Fake Out, Helping Hand, and Terrain Pulse are all more niche options that can be run over preferably Protect but also Yawn. Fake Out gives Blastoise's teammates opportunities to set up or get a strong attack off. Helping Hand allows Blastoise to boost the power of its teammates such as Zacian-C unimpeded due to its high priority. Terrain Pulse allows Blastoise to hit Water-types such as Kyogre, Gastrodon, and opposing Blastoise super effectively when paired with Rillaboom's Grassy Surge. Aqua Jet is an alternative option over Yawn on Coalossal teams so that Blastoise can best position itself to activate Coalossal's Weakness Policy and Steam Engine. Wacan Berry improves Blastoise's matchup against Regieleki and offensive Thundurus. Alternatively, Life Orb boosts Blastoise's damage output immensely, enabling it to 2HKO Gigantamax Venusaur and Dynamaxed Rillaboom with Max Hailstorm. Blastoise's given Speed investment outspeeds paralyzed Calyrex-S and also outspeeds it at +2, both of which are relevant given that support Thundurus and Landorus-T that can boost its Speed with Max Airstream are common partners.</p> <p>Blastoise is most commonly paired with Zacian-C to pressure Pokemon such as Incineroar, Rotom-H, and Landorus-T for it, while Zacian-C checks Rillaboom for Blastoise. Furthermore, the residual damage from G-Max Cannonade can set Zacian-C up to sweep late-game. Incineroar checks Grass-types such as Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Rillaboom and offers Blastoise Fake Out pressure. Grimmsnarl's dual screens support and speed control allow Blastoise to pressure foes more easily. Support Thundurus pairs similarly well with Blastoise, as it can provide speed control and support in Eerie Impulse to help Blastoise better take on threats such as Venusaur and Regieleki. Landorus-T is very frequently paired with Blastoise, as it checks Regieleki and Grass-types. Rillaboom smacks Water-types such as Gastrodon, Tapu Fini, and Kyogre, which Blastoise struggles to damage. Coalossal deals with threats to Blastoise like Thundurus and Venusaur, and Blastoise in return can check Ground-type threats to Coalossal like Landorus-T, as well as activate Coalossal's Weakness Policy and Steam Engine via Aqua Jet.</p> "

Waterfall is Gyarados's main STAB move, hitting prevalent Fire- and Ground-type Pokemon like Entei and Landorus. Power Whip provides Gyarados with coverage for Water-types, hitting Kyogre and Urshifu-R for a 2HKO, as well being the strongest option to hit Groudon with in the sun. Icy Wind offers speed control for letting Gyarados and its teammates surpass fast threats such as Zacian-C, Calyrex-S, and Landorus. Lash Out makes Gyarados a solid check to Calyrex-S and Lunala, notably OHKOing the former. Lash Out is used over Crunch or Payback in order to always get the OHKO on Calyrex-S, even if Gyarados is worn down by opposing Intimidate. Stone Edge gives Gyarados an option to OHKO Volcarona and ignore its Flame Body and the ability to 2HKO Entei in the sun, which is especially relevant, as Entei is sometimes paired with Groudon. Assault Vest significantly improves Gyarados's ability to take on powerful special attackers such as Calyrex-S and Kyogre. These EVs allow Gyarados to survive Kyogre's Thunder and make Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage a 3HKO. The Speed investment allows Gyarados to get past maximum Speed Incineroar and -1 Landorus.</p> <p>Zacian-C is Gyrados's best restricted partner and is capable of destroying Nihilego for it.

Entei and Incineroar have great synergy with Gyarados, as they can thwart problematic Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Rillaboom, and Gyarados can check Ground-types like Groudon and Landorus. Landorus is solid alongside Gyarados for its ability to thwart Electric-types like Zapdos and Regieleki.</p> "

Foul Play takes advantage of the high Attack stats of Restricted Pokemon and deals very acceptable damage to them, such as on Groudon and Calyrex-I. Snarl allows Umbreon to slow down strong specially attacking threats such as Calyrex-S and Kyogre. Yawn makes Umbreon demand respect unlike most other defensive Pokemon, as sleep is generally an oppressive mechanic and can also completely shut down Dynamax for at least a turn, forcing the Pokemon to switch out in order to prevent it and wasting their Dynamax. Moonlight semi-reliably heals 2/3 of Umbreon's HP under sun, which is fantastic for a defensive Pokemon that is usually paired with Groudon. Moonlight can prove to help Umbreon win against Pokemon such as Calyrex-S and Kyogre under sun due to being able to play a very long game with them, 2HKOing the former and slowly chipping the latter down. Helping Hand allows Umbreon to bypass its lack of offensive presence by powering up an ally such as Groudon. Protect helps Umbreon stall opposing Dynamax turns more effectively. Sitrus Berry allows Umbreon to heal off a good amount of damage immediately, while Leftovers allows it to play the slow game when healing alongside Protect or Moonlight. The EV spread allows Umbreon to always survive Modest Kyogre's Water Spout under rain and Brave Calyrex-I's Max Hailstorm.</p> <p>Umbreon appreciates partners such as Groudon that can set sun, helping Umbreon heal a substantial amount with Moonlight, and Umbreon in turn gives Groudon room to set up with Swords Dance via Yawn and can shoot its damage up even higher with Helping Hand. Charizard is another good Umbreon partner that also loves being in the sun. It offsets Umbreon's weakness to Zacian-C and both Urshifu formes with its G-Max Wildfire and Max Airstream, respectively. Grimmsnarl makes Umbreon even more problematic by bolstering its bulk via dual screens support and serves as a secondary check to both Urshifu formes.</p> "

Trick Room is invaluable speed control for almost any team, and Porygon2 sets Trick Room reliably thanks to its immense bulk. Recover gives Porygon2 longevity, letting it stall out Dynamax turns and potentially help it serve as a late-game wincon, outlasting foes. Eerie Impulse is immensely useful to impede the metagame's various special attackers such as Calyrex-S, Rotom-H, and Kyogre. Tri Attack is oftentimes less critical than Porygon2's other options, but its the best option versus Pokemon such as Urshifu-R and Incineroar that aren't vulnerable to Porygon2's coverage or Eerie Impulse. Ice Beam makes Porygon2 one of the best checks to one of the metagame's most potent threats, Landorus-T, and it also deals decent damage to the likes of Groudon and Venusaur. Foul Play allows Porygon2 to threaten a 2HKO onto Calyrex-S and hit boosted Weakness Policy users such as Solgaleo, Calyrex-I, and Metagross quite hard. Download is good because it gives Porygon2 a Special Attack boost pretty often, considering common Pokemon such as Incineroar, both Urshifu formes, and Landorus-T have higher Defense stats. Trace should only be run if Porygon2 chooses Eerie Impulse and Foul Play as its last two moves. Trace will be more advantageous than disadvantageous most of the time, mainly due to the potential of copying Intimidate from users such as Incineroar and Landorus-T. Thunderbolt is an option for Porygon2's third moveslot, giving Porygon2 BoltBeam coverage with Ice Beam and allowing it to more immediately threaten the likes of Charizard, Blastoise, and Kyogre, and unlike Eerie Impulse, its not shut down by Taunt. However, its overall less useful then Eerie Impulse. Note that when running Thunderbolt, Porygon2 should elect for a Modest nature to best make use of its BoltBeam coverage. Icy Wind is alternative speed control over Trick Room, though oftentimes Trick Room is simply going to be more valuable. Shadow Ball has the advantage over Foul Play of being able to OHKO Calyrex-S after a Download boost, but it's worse versus boosted Weakness Policy users. Ally Switch is an option over one of the last two moveslots, giving Porygon2 the ability to redirect attacks from its teammates, though its incredibly difficult to justify Ally Switch due to it taking a valuable slot. A physically defensive EV spread is preferred for Porygon2 to better set Trick Room in the face of powerful physical attackers such as Urshifu-S and Zacian-C, and the given EVs allow Porygon2 to survive Adamant Zacian-C's Close Combat with the remainder thrown into Special Defense. A specially defensive EV spread such as 252 HP / 144 Def / 112 SpD with a Sassy nature is also a good option, which allows Porygon2 to live extremely powerful special attacks such as Calyrex-S's Helping Hand- and Life Orb-boosted Max Mindstorm and Kyogre's Mystic Water-boosted 150 BP Max Geyser. A Modest nature with some Special Attack investment can make Porygon2 notably more threatening with a Download boost, though this of course compromises its bulk.</p> <p>Porygon2 makes a great fit on sun teams with either Torkoal or Groudon alongside Venusaur because they greatly appreciate its role compression as a check to Landorus-T with Ice Beam, as well as Calyrex-S and Rotom-H with Eerie Impulse. Furthermore, the combination of Porygon2 with the aforementioned Pokemon is quite flexible between Porygon2's ability to set Trick Room or swap into a Drought setter to activate Venusaur's Chlorophyll, which has the threat of both Dynamax and Sleep Powder at its disposal. Incineroar pairs extremely well with Porygon2 with its Fake Out capable of helping it set Trick Room. Other good Restricted Pokemon to pair with Porygon2 are Kyogre and Zacian-C, the former being a heavy hitter that can benefit greatly from Trick Room and the latter appreciating its ability to check Landorus-T.</p> "

Shadow Ball threatens Calyrex-S, one of the metagame's most dangerous Pokemon. Ice Beam on the other hand lethally threatens Landorus-T and deals good damage to the likes of Groudon and Venusaur. Running either Trick Room or Icy Wind is invaluable for speed control and should be used respectively of which would benefit your team more. Recover is incredibly useful, granting Porygon2 longevity and allowing it to serve as a late-game wincon by outlasting foes and stalling out Dynamax turns. Alternatively, Ally Switch allows Porygon2 to redirect attacks from its partners, but this gives up Recover's longevity. Thunderbolt is a coverage option that slams the likes of Charizard, Tapu Fini, and Blastoise fairly hard, though its difficult to justify over Porygon2's generally more important coverage options.

The former has a great Landorus-T matchup, freeing Porygon2 from running Ice Beam, while the latter also packs other useful support moves like Fake Tears to help Porygon2.

Body Press takes advantage of Torkoal's high Defense stat, allowing it to ignore Intimidate and heavily damage Incineroar. Yawn allows Torkoal to threaten to waste opposing Dynamax turns and slow down the momentum of opposing strategies thanks to its good bulk. The EV spread allows Torkoal to survive three +1 Sacred Swords from Zacian-C, a +1 Earth Power from Venusaur, and a Wicked Blow from Choice Band Urshifu-S.</p> <p>Zacian-C is Torkoal's most common Restricted partner, which takes care of Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Urshifu-S against which Torkoal can't do much. Torkoal in turn handles opposing Zacian-C. Torkoal is very commonly paired with Charizard and almost always with Venusaur as Drought allows the former to deal very large amounts of damage with its powerful Solar Power-boosted G-Max Wildfires and the latter to fire off fast Sleep Powders and G-Max Vinelashes. In the case of a team with a Trick Room setter, Whimsicott and Calyrex-I are good partners for Torkoal, as Burning Jealousy will always burn against Zacian-C since it burns Pokemon that have had a stat boost, allowing Calyrex-I to better resist Behemoth Blade.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Through the combination of Charcoal, Drought, and STAB Eruption, Torkoal is capable of acting as one of the most powerful Trick Room sweepers in the Series 11 metagame. Eruption is an incredibly powerful option for Torkoal, especially since under Trick Room it will almost always act first, allowing it to act as a mini-Kyogre and fire off a 150 BP STAB weather-boosted spread move, OHKOing even the bulkiest of Zacian-C and heavily damaging Dynamaxed Calyrex-I. Consequently, offensive Torkoal tend to opt for Charcoal as their item instead of Life Orb, since they will almost always be using Fire-type moves and do not want to reduce Eruption damage with Life Orb recoil. Charcoal Torkoal often opts for a second spread Fire-type move as an alternative choice for after it has been weakened enough to meaningfully reduce Eruption damage. Heat Wave is the most common choice due to its superior power, but some offensive Torkoal will opt for Burning Jealousy instead due to its perfect accuracy and ability to work as a support option against leads such as Zacian-C and Defiant Thundurus. However, a major downside for Burning Jealousy is that it runs the risk of missing out on KOs that Heat Wave would be able to reach, such as against Zacian-C with 4 HP EVs. To round out the moveset, many Charcoal Torkoal opt for Earth Power as a means of providing an attacking option against Incineroar, Coalossal, and opposing Torkoal, while others choose to run Yawn to put pressure on Dynamax Pokemon and provide a supportive option if Torkoal has its Special Attack dropped or if the weather gets changed from sun. While Charcoal is typically the preferred item for offensive Torkoal, which will run Protect as the fourth move, some opt to instead run Choice Specs in order to maximize the power of Eruption and will use a fourth attacking move instead of Protect such as Solar Beam.</p> <p>Due to having one of the lowest Speed stats in the metagame, offensive Torkoal excels on teams that are either wholly dedicated to Trick Room or have a strong Trick Room option. Consequently, it is almost always paired with one of the three common non-Restricted Trick Room setters in the format: Porygon2, Mimikyu, and Dusclops. Common Restricted partners for offensive Torkoal are those that excel in Trick Room, such as Calyrex-I and Necrozma-DM, although it is also possible to use offensive Torkoal on teams using a Restricted Pokemon such as Zacian-C alongside a Trick Room mode. Many teams using offensive Torkoal will also opt to run Gigantamax Venusaur, giving the team an alternative \"fast mode\" where Torkoal can both support the incredibly strong Gigantamax Venusaur outside of Trick Room and act as a Trick Room attacker during different phases of the match. Some teams will opt to go all in on sun and run Gigantamax Charizard alongside, or instead of, Venusaur to provide massive damage potential with double sun-boosted attacks.</p> "

Water Spout is a devastating spread move, being able to OHKO the likes of Zacian-C, Calyrex-S, and Incineroar. Origin Pulse is a powerful, although inaccurate, backup to Water Spout after Kyogre has been harmed, while Scald is a weaker but consistent option with a chance to burn threats like Zacian-C. Ice Beam is mainly useful for Max Hailstorm, to let Kyogre best contend with the likes of Gigantamaxed Venusaur and Dynamaxed Dragapult, threatening a 2HKO on both. Alternatively, Thunder hits opposing Kyogre and turns into Max Lightning, blocking Yawn from Umbreon and Spore from Amoonguss but leaving Kyogre more vulnerable to Grass-types. Mystic Water boosts Kyogre's Water-type attacks with no drawbacks, as opposed to Life Orb's recoil lowering Water Spout's damage. A Timid nature allows Kyogre to outspeed Calyrex-S and Zacian-C at +1 from Tornadus's Max Airstream, as well outspeed them when they are at -1 from Regieleki's Electroweb, while Modest lets Kyogre OHKO Thundurus with Water Spout while also having a chance to OHKO Zacian-C.</p> <p>Tornadus is a staple partner to Kyogre, as it can offer speed control with Tailwind and Max Airstream and check Grass-types such as Venusaur and Rillaboom. In return, Kyogre's rain turns Hurricane into a sure-hit move. Dragapult helps handle threats to Kyogre like Venusaur and Regieleki and offers speed control with Max Airstream. Venusaur, although near requiring the support of the anti-synergistic Torkoal, is an amazing partner for Kyogre, as it checks Regieleki well, while Kyogre can help deal with Ground- and Fire-types such as Landorus-T and Incineroar. Grimmsnarl's dual screens support and speed control help Kyogre pressure the opponent more safely. Porygon2 can weaken threats to Kyogre such as Zapdos and Venusaur with Eerie Impulse and set Trick Room, meaning Kyogre should exchange its speed for bulk if paired with it. Incineroar can check Venusaur and Amoonguss for Kyogre and also offers Fake Out pressure. Regieleki pairs excellently with Kyogre, for it provides speed control with Electroweb while Kyogre can destroy Ground-types.</p> "

While Groudon is certainly threatening by itself, it's so good more because Drought serves as a catalyst for two of the metagame's most dangerous Pokemon, those being Charizard and Venusaur. Precipice Blades is Groudon's strongest STAB move and gives it access to Max Quake to boost its weaker Special Defense. Groudon has more consistent STAB options, but there is simply too much opportunity cost to reasonably justify them. Rock Slide gives Groudon means to hit Flying-types such as Zapdos and Yveltal, and most critically it threatens an OHKO against Dynamaxed Charizard via Max Rockfall. Swords Dance is useful for offsetting Intimidate from the likes of Landorus-T and Incineroar, and thanks to Groudon's bulk, it can oftentimes get one or even multiple boosts. Sitrus Berry improves Groudon's longevity as a bulky Swords Dance user and support Pokemon to Charizard and Venusaur. Alternatively, Groudon can run White Herb in order to offset Intimidate and make itself generally more threatening; however, Groudon oftentimes doesn't need to be more threatening because its teammates do that job. The given EV spread allows Groudon to outspeed -1 Thundurus and outspeed Tornadus while at +1, both of which are relevant given Groudon is often paired with Charizard, which can use Max Airstream, and Electroweb Regieleki.</p> <p>Groudon should always be paired with Venusaur and almost always with Charizard; there is simply little reason to not use Pokemon that are so powerful in the sun. Venusaur helps Groudon by thwarting Water-types such as Rotom-W, Blastoise, and Kyogre. In return, Groudon can thwart Fire-types like Incineroar and Coalossal. Charizard can assist Groudon by checking Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Venusaur, while Groudon can check Regieleki and Coalossal for Charizard. Regieleki is a great teammate for being one of the best answers to Kyogre teams, and it can also provide Groudon speed control with Electroweb. Grimmsnarl can provide dual screens to bolster Groudon's already good defensive stats, which can help it set up with Swords Dance more safely. Grimmsnarl can also mitigate Groudon's middling Speed via Scary Face or Thunder Wave. Porygon2 is a great partner for Groudon because it's a great check to Landorus-T with Ice Beam, most importantly, and also Calyrex-S with Eerie Impulse, which are both Pokemon that can greatly trouble Groudon teams. Porygon2 can also provide speed control to Groudon with Trick Room. Incineroar supports pretty much every Pokemon well and Groudon is no exception, appreciating Incineroar's ability to keep the likes of Venusaur, Rillaboom, and Calyrex-S in check if it's running Assault Vest. Umbreon is one of the best answers to Calyrex-S and also a solid answer to Calyrex-I, both of which can greatly trouble Groudon and its common teammates. Note that running Umbreon gives up the ability to reasonably justify Porygon2, which compromises the matchup against Landorus-T.</p> "

Close Combat does good damage, taking on the likes of Incineroar and Stakataka, and Mienshao isn't particularly affected by the defensive drops due to its already low defensive stats. Fake Out allows Mienshao to pin down opposing Pokemon for common partners such as Calyrex-S and Nihilego to attack them more freely, with Mienshao notably being able to use it before other common Fake Out users such as Incineroar and Rillaboom. Wide Guard is a must-have utility option that blocks some of the most threatening moves in the game like Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage, Kyogre's Water Spout and Groudon's Precipice Blades. Feint breaking all forms of protection is particularly helpful alongside Calyrex-S, allowing it to click Astral Barrage against most Wide Guard users. Taunt allows Mienshao to disrupt other utility Pokemon such as Volcarona, Amoonguss, and Whimsicott. Knock Off applies heavy pressure to Dark-weak Pokemon such as Aegislash and Calyrex-S. Focus Sash makes up for Mienshao's lack of bulk being the only item viable as a result.

There are two common ways to check Landorus; bulky Water-types like Kyogre and Suicune can tank Landorus's attacks and retaliate with an OHKO, while foes like Yveltal are immune to Earth Power and take neutral damage from Sludge Bomb, leaving Landorus with minimal ways to deal heavy damage to them.</p> "

Earthquake deals massive damage to staples like Incineroar, Zacian-C, and Coalossal while also getting around redirection from Indeedee-F. It turns into Max Quake under Dynamax, allowing Landorus-T to boost its and its allies' Special Defense. Rock Slide complements Earthquake well by giving good coverage against Rotom-H, Charizard, and Zapdos. Swords Dance counteracts Intimidate and turns Landorus-T into a massive offensive threat, punishing passive leads. Fly turns into Max Airstream under Dynamax, allowing Landorus-T to hit Pokemon such as Urshifu-R and Rillaboom while also boosting its and its allies' Speed. Lum Berry offsets Sleep Powder from Venusaur and Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Rotom-H and Mimikyu, and alongside Grimmsnarl's dual screens, it makes Landorus-T a major threat to most sun compositions. Life Orb gives Landorus-T more immediate offensive presence at the cost of more vulnerability to status conditions.</p> <p>Landorus-T complements Zacian-C well by checking sun teams, especially checking Groudon and Venusaur. Zacian-C helps check Calyrex-I in return with its Ice-resistant typing and super effective Behemoth Blade.

Incineroar has good type synergy with Landorus-T and provides it with Fake Out and Intimidate support, allowing it to set up Swords Dance safely. It also helps by pivoting around with Intimidate and Parting Shot against Landorus-T's biggest nemesis, Calyrex-I. Rillaboom helps Landorus-T hit bulky Water-types such as Kyogre and Lapras while aiding it with Fake Out in a similar way to Incineroar.

A mixed set avoids being slowed down horribly by Intimidate from the likes of Incineroar and Landorus-T. Even with low Attack investment Sunsteel Strike still hits hard, being able to 2HKO Xerneas and Grimmsnarl. Earth Power crucially hits Incineroar and OHKOes Stakataka. Photon Geyser OHKOes Urshifu-R and gives Necrozma-DM a strong STAB attack unaffected by Intimidate. Trick Room takes advantage of Necrozma-DM's middling speed, allowing it to turn the battle into its favor. Prism Armor and Necrozma-DM's massive bulk make it a good Weakness Policy user often able to stomach super effective attacks, such as Yveltal's Foul Play or Landorus Earth Power. Safety Goggles is an option that protects Necrozma-DM from Amoonguss and Venusaur's sleep moves and bypasses Volcarona and Amoonguss's Rage Powder, though without potential boosts from Weakness Policy Necrozma-DM's damage output can be underwhelming. Expanding Force can be run over Photon Geyser if Necrozma-DM is paired with Indeedee-F or Tapu Lele. Necrozma-DM has a higher Special Attack stat than Attack on this set to ensure that Photon Geyser will be special.</p> <p>Necrozma-DM is severely threatened by Calyrex-S, so it appreciates help from Dark- or Normal-type Pokemon such as Indeedee-F, Incineroar, and Galarian Moltres. Kyogre can take a few attacks from Necrozma-DM, outspeed and easily 2HKO it in return, so Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Amoonguss can help keep it in check. Redirection users like Volcarona, Indeedee-F, and Amoonguss or Fake Out users such as Rillaboom and Incineroar can help Necrozma-DM set up Trick Room. Urshifu-R is a great partner that appreciates Necrozma-DM's ability to handle Xerneas and in return can check Fire-types such as opposing Volcarona and Incineroar.

Stone Edge hits Fire-types like Incineroar and Entei and notably OHKOes Volcarona. Rock Slide is an alternative for spread damage, but it fails to OHKO maximum Defense Volcarona. Since running Rock coverage unfortunately leaves Necrozma-DM walled by Urshifu-R and Kyogre, Photon Geyser is an option for OHKOing the former and hitting the latter hard; however, this leaves Necrozma-DM walled by Incineroar. Swords Dance can offset Intimidate from the likes of Incineroar and Landorus-T and boost Necrozma-DM's Attack to insane levels, for example OHKOing Yveltal with +2 Sunsteel Strike or +1 Stone Edge. Trick Room can turn the battle in Necrozma-DM's favor due to its middling speed. Weakness Policy has good synergy alongside Swords Dance, enabling you to discourage your opponent from attacking Necrozma-DM in respect to the item and punish them. Alternatively, Safety Goggles lets Necrozma-DM bypass redirection from Volcarona and Amoonguss whilst protecting it from the latter's Spore.</p> <p>Necrozma-DM appreciates redirection users such as Indeedee-F, Amoonguss, and Volcarona and Fake Out users such as Incineroar and Rillaboom to help it set up Swords Dance and Trick Room. Urshifu-R is an amazing teammate for its ability to thwart Fire-type threats to Necrozma-DM like Volcarona and Incineroar; in return, Necrozma-DM checks Xerneas. As Kyogre outspeeds and 2HKOes Necrozma-DM, Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Amoonguss can help keep it in check. Nihilego and Landorus-T are good teammates for their ability to check Fire-type threats towards Necrozma-DM such as Incineroar and Volcarona. Calyrex-S threatens Necrozma-DM immensely, so Dark- and Normal-types such as Indeedee-F, Incineroar, and Galarian Moltres can help keep Calyrex-S in check.

Body Press lets Stakataka 2HKO Incineroar while being unaffected by Intimidate, and only gets stronger with each KO it takes thanks to Beast Boost raising Stakataka's Defense. Trick Room helps versus the mostly fast-paced meta, and can turn the battle in Stakataka's favor extremely quickly. Finally, Wide Guard is able to ward off threatening spread moves such as Astral Barrage, Water Spout, Electroweb, and Precipice Blades. Wide Guard can be switched out for Protect to avoid Fake Outs and other hits or Rock Slide for situations where teams need Rock-type coverage against Pokemon such as Yveltal and Volcarona. Chople Berry helps Stakataka survive Fighting-type hits from Urshifu-S, Urshifu-R, Mienshao, and Zacian-C. Safety Goggles can be an option to deal with Spore Amoonguss and Sleep Powder Venusaur, as well as ignoring Rage Powder from Amoonguss and Volcarona. Lastly, for more offensive variants, Life Orb is an option, boosting the power of Stakataka's already powerful attacks. The given EV spread allows Stakataka to survive a Helping Hand-boosted +2 Moonblast from Xerneas or a Life Orb- and Helping Hand-boosted Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S, as well as a chance of living Close Combat from Choice Band Urshifu-S and Urshifu-R should it be holding Chople Berry.

Stakataka also pairs well with Groudon and Palkia, as Stakataka covers Xerneas and Yveltal for them and uses Wide Guard to block threatening spread moves. Groudon covers Stakataka's Water weakness with Drought, while Palkia covers Stakataka's Ground weakness with STAB Water-type attacks to threaten Groudon, Landorus, and Landorus-T.</p> "

However, while less common, Urshifu-R can run other items such as Mystic Water, Choice Band, and Choice Scarf to boost damage output or Speed and will opt for U-turn over Detect on Choice item sets.</p> <p>In Series 11, Urshifu-R is most commonly used as an offensive support Pokemon on Coalossal teams, as it can utilize Aqua Jet to activate Coalossal's Weakness Policy and offer strong damage output to KO Pokemon weakened by G-Max Vocalith damage. The pair also have strong synergy, as Coalossal and Urshifu-R can threaten each other's most common checks, such as Landorus-T for Coalossal and Grass-types like Venusaur for Urshifu-R. The best choice for a Restricted Pokemon on these teams tends to be Zacian-C or Yveltal, and the rest of the team is typically filled out with Dragapult, Incineroar, and one of either Amoonguss or Rillaboom. However, Urshifu-R can also be a strong Pokemon on other teams that don't use Coalossal, as it still offers stellar offensive pressure that can compliment many Pokemon.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With the highest Speed stat in the game, immensely powerful attacks, and incredible speed control in Electroweb, Regieleki is one of s11's top-tier Pokemon. Elecrtoweb is invaluable speed control that deals decent damage, ignores redirectors such as Amoonguss and Indeedee-F, and usually goes first with Regieleki's Speed. Thunder should only be run over Thunderbolt on teams with a rain setter. Thunder Wave and Eerie Impulse are niche support options that can be run over Thunderbolt or Volt Switch. Thunder Wave slows foes more severely than Electroweb and is particularly useful against Clear Body Dragapult, while Eerie Impulse weakens special attackers such as Venusaur, Rotom-H, and Coalossal. Magnet and Life Orb further increase Regieleki's incredible offense; Magnet lets a teammate such as Landorus-T, Dragapult, or Venusaur run Life Orb, but Life Orb is otherwise superior. Focus Sash is an especially useful item given Regieleki's frailty and makes it a great check to the combination of Tornadus and Kyogre.</p> <p>Regieleki's many positive qualities and strong synergy with other top-tier Pokemon allow it to fit on a wide variety of teams. Incineroar can threaten Grass-types such as Venusaur and Rillaboom, while Regieleki can thwart Water-types like Blastoise and Kyogre. Water-types are also strong teammates, able to check Ground-types like Landorus-T and Groudon for Regieleki. Zacian-C greatly benefits from Regieleki's Electroweb and ability to keep Water-types and Charizard in check. Landorus-T and Groudon appreciate Regieleki's speed control and Water-type checking, and Landorus-T can check Grass-types for Regieleki.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With Dynamax and bulk investment, Regieleki has better survivability and cataclysmic power. Rising Voltage gives Regieleki the most powerful Max Lightning, and Rising Voltage becomes even stronger in the Electric Terrain set by Regieleki's Max Lightning. Electroweb supports Regieleki's team outside of Dynamax. Hyper Beam is most useful for Max Strike, which is Regieleki's best way to hit pertinent Ground-types like Landorus-T and Groudon, and it has utility in lowering Speed. Life Orb grants Regieleki immense power, allowing it to 2HKO even Amoonguss. The given EVs are optimal for Life Orb recoil and allow Dynamaxed Regieleki to always survive Adamant Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade after Life Orb recoil. Regieleki also outspeeds +1 Landorus-T with the given Speed. Regieleki's EV spread is fairly flexible, and it can very viably forgo bulk for more Speed.</p> <p>This Regieleki set fits well on Calyrex-S hyper offense teams and Calyrex-I Trick Room teams. Regieleki and Calyrex-S have a limited pool of mostly different answers and are immensely powerful, which makes them strong together. Calyrex-I is an excellent Regieleki partner, as it can destroy Ground- and Grass-types like Groudon, Landorus-T, and Rillaboom, while the slow Trick Room teams Calyrex-I fits on appreciate having a fast and powerful Pokemon for increased flexibility. Helping Hand makes Regieleki capable of incredible feats such as OHKOing Porygon2 and Dynamaxed Calyrex-S. Indeedee-F and Whimsicott are good options to provide Helping Hand on Calyrex-S teams, and Dusclops can provide it on Calyrex-I teams.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Incredible bulk, one of the highest Attack stats in the metagame, a highly diverse movepool, and success both under and outside of Dynamax make Calyrex-I one of the premier Restricted Pokemon and Trick Room sweepers in the Series 11 metagame. Glacial Lance is arguably the best spread move in the game, and its synergy with As One allows Calyrex-I to quickly snowball under Trick Room, with very few Pokemon able to withstand a boosted attack. High Horsepower hits Fire- and Steel-types, which resist Glacial Lance, for super effective damage. Calyrex-I's third and fourth moveslots are more flexible. Heavy Slam is mainly useful under Dynamax to hit opposing Calyrex-I, and it can pair with Max Quake to provide whichever defensive boosts are needed. Protect allows Calyrex-I to avoid damage, as opponents often focus on it to take it out quickly before it tears through teams, while Trick Room instead ensures that Calyrex-I isn't fully dependent on a partner to have a speed advantage. Many Calyrex-I opt for Weakness Policy as the item, which can work both with an activator partner or just taking foes' attacks, the latter being helped by Calyrex-I's immense bulk and several weaknesses. Other common options include Life Orb, which trades the massive damage potential of Weakness Policy for a more consistent offensive boost, and Lum Berry, which allows Calyrex-I to avoid burns and other statuses that are used to try and neutralize it. Other common set option include an Assault Vest set, which will typically run Close Combat alongside Heavy Slam in the final two moveslots, and faster sets on teams that use speed control methods other than Trick Room.</p> <p>Calyrex-I relies on several common partners to maximize its potential. It is most often run alongside a Trick Room setter: Dusclops and Mimikyu are common options that can support Calyrex-I with various moves, such as Haze on Dusclops to neutralize Intimidate drops and Safeguard on Mimikyu to deter status effects, as well as activating Weakness Policy with Shadow Sneak. Porygon2 has a less exhaustive support movepool but is much stronger against Calyrex-S teams due to not sharing a Ghost weakness with Calyrex-I like the Ghost-type setters do. Other common supportive partners for Calyrex-I include Tapu Fini, which protects Calyrex-I from status effects, redirectors such as Amoonguss, which can draw attention away from Calyrex-I while it sets up Trick Room or deals damage, and Fire-types like Incinceroar or Torkoal, which can pressure problematic Steel type Pokemon like Zacian-C, Solgaleo, and Necrozma-DM. Some teams will also opt for a secondary Dynamax or Gigantamax option that both covers some of Calyrex-I's weaknesses and gives the team an alternative \"fast mode\" that doesn't rely on Trick Room, like Venusaur (usually paired with Torkoal) or offensive Thundurus.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Boasting two of the highest Special Attack and Speed stats in the game and the ability to snowball via As One after every KO it gets, Calyrex-S is one of the strongest, most dangerous Pokemon in the VGC metagame. The combination of its Ghost- and Psychic-type STAB moves hits almost the entire metagame for at least neutral damage, barring Grimmsnarl, Urshifu-S, and staple Incineroar, which are its biggest nemeses. Astral Barrage hits both targets, 2HKOing almost the entire unboosted metagame. It allows Calyrex-S to hit the likes of Zacian-C, Dragapult, and Calyrex-I hard. It also turns into Max Phantasm when Dynamaxed, dropping the Defense of both opposing Pokemon for strong physical allies such as Urshifu-R. Expanding Force becomes a spread move under Psychic Terrain provided by an ally such as Indeedee-F and OHKOes Pokemon such as Urshifu-R and Venusaur. Max Mindstorm also sets up Psychic Terrain, blocking Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Urshifu-S's Sucker Punch. Mud Shot allows Calyrex-S to hit Incineroar and becomes Max Quake when Dynamaxed, which consistently deals substantial damage to Incineroar while raising Calyrex-S's and its allies' Special Defense. Draining Kiss allows Calyrex-S to hit problematic Dark-types such as Urshifu-S, Grimmsnarl, and Yveltal. Hyper Beam is used mainly to turn into Max Strike when Dynamaxed, allowing Calyrex-S to lower the Speed of both opposing Pokemon. Trick Room is an alternative option, allowing Calyrex-S to support slower teammates such as Torkoal on specific team compositions. Life Orb boosts Calyrex-S's damage output to high levels, allowing it to 2HKO just about anything that doesn't resist its attacks. Alternatively, Focus Sash helps Calyrex-S in the mirror matchup while also giving it at least two opportunities to attack in every other matchup thanks to its naturally high Speed.</p> <p>Calyrex-S appreciates Tailwind support from Whimsicott, allowing it to wreak havoc with its powerful moves. Indeedee-F is helpful for its ability to set up Psychic Terrain so Calyrex-S can deal huge amounts of damage with Expanding Force and Max Mindstorm. Indeedee-F also provides Calyrex-S with redirection support in the form of Follow Me, as Calyrex-S is rather frail, and Helping Hand support to boost Calyrex-S's damage output to astronomical levels, especially under Dynamax. Calyrex-S is also accompanied by Pokemon such as Thundurus and Urshifu-R that can thwart its biggest check, Incineroar, by punishing its Intimidate with Defiant and Surging Strikes, respectively. Urshifu-S is also dealt with, as both of the aforementioned partners have super effective moves for it. Calyrex-S lowers the Defense of opposing Pokemon with Max Phantasm for them in return, allowing them to clean up late-game.</p> "
